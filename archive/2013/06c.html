            <p>I&#39;m actually very much the wrong person to ask - I use mibbit directly, as a rule, since the layout of the &#39;Board link throws me off, and I don&#39;t know much about the mechanics of IRC. A brief informal survey reveals that fifteen out of twenty attempts to connect are successful. If an attempt to connect goes to &quot;Looking up hostname&quot; and no further, my recommendation is to either close or refresh the tab and try again.<br><br>As for getting there without the link, I have been informed, repeatedly and at length, that Mibbit is an awful tool, and I should be using Chatzilla, but pah. Mibbit is easy and I know how to do it. Perhaps someone who is more knowledgeable than I can explain another method - this is the one I know:<br><br>1) go to <a href="http://chat.mibbit.com/"><a href="http://chat.mibbit.com/">http://chat.mibbit.com/</a></a><br>2) click &quot;Server,&quot; and type in &quot;irc.sorcery.net&quot; for the blank that appears... OR... select &quot;Sorcery [webirc]&quot; out of the drop-down menu.<br>3) Type in your username, or an appropriate abbreviation thereof, for the &quot;Nick&quot; blank, and #PPC for the &quot;Channel&quot; blank.<br>4) Click &quot;Connect.&quot; If the &quot;Sorcery&quot; tab appears, but nothing happens after that, click on it - if the message is &quot;looking up your hostname,&quot; exit the tab and click &quot;Connect&quot; again. Repeat until it works - if it really isn&#39;t working at all, there might be an issue that requires you to refresh the page.</p>

            <p>Would adding a parenthetical along the lines of &#39;(Find us at #PPC on irc.sorcery.net!)&#39; be useful in the Board header?

            <p>I think that adding &quot;(#PPC on irc.sorcery.net)&quot; either at the end of the PPC IRC link or immediately after it is a good idea. That information would help people familiar with IRC get their clients working.</p>

I think those three are the important ones - the ones Boarders need regular access to (and when did you last read the Constitution?

            <p>In answer to your questions:<br><br>- I think there was a discussion about including some other links, but I don&#39;t remember which ones. ._. Maybe the Permission article? Maybe the Original Series? Actually, a TOS link sounds like a really good idea to me. Maybe something like &quot;- <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS">The Original Series</a> is what started it all. This is the PPC&#39;s foundation, so be familiar with it!&quot;<br><br>- The preamble seems fine length-wise, but I don&#39;t know what &quot;before you get stuck in&quot; means.<br><br>- The Constitution doesn&#39;t just apply when interacting with other PPCers—it applies anytime you&#39;re acting/speaking in the name of the PPC, with anyone, anywhere. I think just the first and last lines would suffice there. IMO, it&#39;s appropriate to be forceful about this.<br><br>- &quot;Our shiny PPC Wiki&quot; would fit better with the other items, which both give the full name of the things in question.<br><br>- This is probably just me, but I despise the use of &quot;as&quot; in the sense of &quot;because&quot; (and &quot;because&quot; would work just fine in this case). I also wonder if it couldn&#39;t be phrased more clearly overall... maybe something like &quot;Please check before asking! We like it when people do the research.&quot; This has the advantage of being more positive and friendly while also conveying that we <i>don&#39;t</i> like it when people can&#39;t be arsed to take two minutes to look things up for themselves. {= )<br><br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

These are links that everyone on the Board will probably need regularly - the Constitution (which you should reread frequently - I just did), TOS (which is both worth the reread, and a good way to re-ground yourself in the quirky nature of the PPC), the Wiki (which is our primary research tool), and the IRC (where people talk all the time). The Permission article, in contrast, is something you look at a couple of times before you ask for Permission, and probably never again.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Looks good to me, and I think that the instruction to &#39;be familiar&#39; with the Original Series carries the right balance. <br><br>I don&#39;t think that we should be insisting that people that aren&#39;t interested in fantasy have to read <i>all</i> of it, and similarly doing so probably isn&#39;t the best thing to do for someone that&#39;s intending on putting their Agents in DBS, DOGA, DIC, etc. - there are a lot more Departments around now than there were in the beginning. At the same time, reading at least a few of Jay and Acacia&#39;s missions has got to be the best way for new people to get a feel for the style and tone of the PPC. <br><br>I would think that the essential PPCness of it can be picked up from reading just a few of the missions, and any other specific questions someone might have could be answered just as easily from the wiki, by reading missions set in continua they enjoy, or those dealing with the particular type of badfic they want to spork.<br><br>I also think that it might be worth making the Permission stuff a bit more high profile - I&#39;m not necessarily saying that I think it needs to go in the header, but I can&#39;t think of any other way of doing that off hand. Your latest statistical analysis bit showed that Permission seems to be harder to get than it&#39;s meant to be (only about 1/3 managed it on the first attempt, which is a pretty high failure rate for something that&#39;s &#39;not that hard&#39;). Maybe making it a bit more obvious, such as having links to the Permission article in the header, would help prospective mission-writers get approval. <br><br>Also, just in case you hadn&#39;t noticed it yourself, it would appear that an &#39;m&#39; has somehow snuck in and replaced the &#39;n&#39; from &#39;Assassins&#39; when you referred to Jay and Acacia. <br></p>

            <p>I think you covered just about everything I was thinking, including the typo. {= )<br><br>When I was writing my initial comments, I was trying to think of some way to point people directly at the &quot;Help and FAQs&quot; tab at the top of the wiki, which contains all the really instructive articles, including Permission. I worry that it isn&#39;t particularly easy to spot or identify as part of PPC Wiki specifically and not general Wikia stuff. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t think of a good way to do that.<br><br>At some point, I may try to mess with the wiki&#39;s CSS and see if I can&#39;t at least make those tabs more eye-catching without changing the color of all the other links. I fixed the subheader bolding issue that way, I don&#39;t see why I couldn&#39;t fix this if I put my mind to it.<br><br>I also want to thoroughly index TOS on The Lost Tales someday, to help with the &quot;being familiar&quot; thing. That at least wouldn&#39;t be too difficult from a coding perspective, just a lot of tediousness. And I love tediousness. <sup>_<sup><br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

            <p>My idea is to code the series so that each paragraph of each mission can be linked to directly. It might go something like this:<br><br>RB = &quot;Rambling Band&quot; | Ch = &quot;Chosen&quot; | LF = &quot;Lady of the Fellowship&quot;<br><br><s>## = I&#39;m not counting that many paragraphs right now</s><br><br><b>CAD:</b> <i>see <b>Canon Analysis Device</b>, <b>Character Analysis Device</b></i><br><br><b>Canon Analysis Device:</b> RB par. 10, 22-23, 29-30; Ch par. ##; LF par. ##, ##<br>   <i>character rupture</i>: RB par. 30<br><br><b>Character Analysis Device:</b> RB par. 9, 17-21; LF par. ##<br><br><b>Elrond:</b> RB par. 37; LF par. ##<br>   <i>resisting Suefluence</i>: RB par. 37; LF par. ##<br><br>With links, obviously, and a heck of a lot more stuff...<br><br>So, in short, yes, any notes you have would be awesome for whenever I actually start working on this. {= ) There are several things ahead of it in the Stuff I Need To Work On queue, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As to the Permission link... would it potentially be a good idea to add a sentence along the lines of &#39;If you&#39;ve got a question about this place, it might be Frequently Asked!

            <p>In fact, it sounds like a much more sensible version of what I was going to suggest, which was to have a hub page on the wiki that just contained links to (and descriptions of) the various Guides and How-Tos, with the header modified along the lines of &#39;Our shiny Wiki... <i>blah blah blah</i>... if it&#39;s your first visit we recommend you start [here|hub]. <br><br>But yeah, actually having them listed out straight away would probably make it more accessible, as well as cutting down on the inherent redundancy of my plan. <br><br>I agree that getting Permission isn&#39;t / shouldn&#39;t be a factor in being part of the PPC community, but it is rather an important factor in actually writing PPC missions, and I don&#39;t think an emphasis of that aspect would hurt. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m Agent Avery Windfall on that board. <br><br>I have no idea what we should do. It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve been in the PPC. Do you have any ideas? We could do a mission or a non-mission PPC fic. <br><br>Unfortunately, I moved through 3 computers since I was in the PPC last and don&#39;t have Rowen&#39;s missions anywhere. I had about two or three partially done, and a back story. But, they&#39;re gone. I&#39;d have to re-write everything. I&#39;m not sure if I want to go ahead with Rowan or write Avery&#39;s PPC days. </p>

            <p>Actually, perhaps this is as good an excuse as any to try to get the <a href="http://ppchq.dreamwidth.org/">Dreamwidth RP site</a> going again. If you still have access to the character journal hS dug up, you can probably use that, since Dreamwidth and LJ support OpenID.

            <p>I definitely like the idea of an RP site. It&#39;ll make things easier with everyone&#39;s schedules. I think I&#39;d like to re-write Rowen&#39;s back story, and write up Avery&#39;s. I&#39;m a little confused at how to work the Dreamwidth site. But, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll figure it out. </p>

            <p>What an interesting specimen! It seems to shift at random between a detached emotion and a mini-Boarder, to the extent that the area that would in typical cases be occupied by a head and neck appears to be entirely replaced with the emoticon for a person sticking out his or her tongue. Perhaps the experiment can be duplicated with ;) or XD, or even odd personal emoticon choices. Yes... there is science to be done here.</p>

            <p>Why would the Marquis de Sod assume that anyone from outside continua with magical creatures and super-technology is automatically from World One? What about CSI or thriller movies or other such continua that are variants on the World One model, but have characters and events that are unconnected with &quot;real world&quot; events outside of a few tangential links and allegories?<br><br>Why is the Marquis de Sod surprised at the idea of Jean having no Lust Objects? He&#39;s been Head of Personnel since the early 70s; he&#39;ll have seen every facet of the human psyche by this point, and would be aware by the modern day that some people are just asexual. If there&#39;s one being who&#39;s not going to think of your sexual orientation as more than just a check-box on a few pieces of paperwork, it&#39;s the one who reproduces by pollination.<br><br>How did Jean get to de Sod&#39;s office in the first place? She seems to scoff at the idea of a canon patrol, so she wasn&#39;t a fic recruit, she doesn&#39;t seem to believe in alternate worlds and dimensional travel at first, so she probably wasn&#39;t deposited by plothole, and she&#39;s evidently from a continuum without any sorts of means for magical or sufficiently advanced transit that can go haywire, so she wasn&#39;t catapulted into HQ&#39;s null space by a glitch or the like.<br>Yet, she knows that the people around her in the halls are called agents, and she knew where de Sod&#39;s office was, so she&#39;s evidently met someone and that someone has shown her how to navigate HQ. Not everything seems to be clear, is what I&#39;m trying to say here.<br><br>Why does de Sod immediately assign her to the DMS? Normally, immediate assignment as an Assassin or even a Disentangler come from intimate knowledge of a canon, tendency for personal attachment to canons, or a proclivity toward violence. From her interview, it seems to me that de Sod would have assigned her to an internship or to training to allow her to get a feel for the organization before giving her a permanent post. The only factor that would speak in her favor as an Assassin would be her experience in multiple weapons. It just seems like a decision that de Sod wouldn&#39;t make normally.<br><br>Jean seems... unstable. She asks a question of her interviewer in a confrontational manner and then immediately says &quot;<i>NOW</i> it&#39;s going to give me some answers!&quot; before de Sod says anything, her first reaction to &quot;I might be hallucinating&quot; is stabbing herself with a pencil, and she shifts between emotions randomly, chiefly reactive shock and befuddled confusion, which do not typically switch back and forth more than once. This, again, raises the question of why de Sod assigned her to the DMS. Assassins snap with regularity in the PPC, and she probably shouldn&#39;t be put in a high-risk Department when she&#39;s showing unstable tendencies without at least a few analyses from the Psychs.</p>

            <p>The concept is all right, and I don&#39;t have any problems with the way it&#39;s set up (recruit walks in, sees Flower, learns about PPC, doesn&#39;t believe at first, is assigned, begrudgingly accepts, leaves, here we go again), but it&#39;s just that they way it was written could use some changes, most of them centered around the questions I posed.

            <p>I don&#39;t know much about her as a character. Yesterday, I did a short RP as another potential character: Yorick.<br><br>Remember the urple skeleton that&#39;s briefly mentioned in New Lodgings? Yeah, that&#39;s him. He was created by Valon filching a scroll of Create Undead from a Pathfinder continuum. As I figured out by roleplaying him for a bit, he&#39;s eager, green as grass, dresses like a Hawaiian tourist, and loves blowing things up.<br><br>I&#39;m half-considering using him instead of Jean. I wouldn&#39;t know how to enter the mind of any female character, never mind an asexual one.</p>

            <p>If you can&#39;t think of how to enter someone&#39;s mind, as you said, it&#39;d be best to get more experience working with similar characters first rather than making someone who might not turn out realistically a main character. Perhaps do some research by reading some other stories that feature well-written female main characters, and then work with writing for them later.<br><br>I like Yorick&#39;s concept, by the way. Aside from Agent Jenka, I don&#39;t think the PPC has any undead, and species diversity is always good.<br>I&#39;m not entirely sure what the Pathfinder rules for undead beings and creation of undead are, but if its version of the Skeleton is capable of casting cantrips, I&#39;d recommend he find one to change his color when he goes out of the RC. Urple is uncomfortable to look at for a large portion of people, in case you didn&#39;t know, and while Valon might be able to deal with it, due to him being partially color-blind, and Yorick would be disguised while on missions, if he has to go down to pick up some papers, or decides to go to a social gathering, or perform some other such function, he&#39;d need to be able to make himself regular magenta or regular fuchsia so that he doesn&#39;t cause trouble simply by walking by and, quite literally, being himself.</p>

            <p>Yes, but the leap in thoughts between &quot;this might be a dream&quot; and &quot;I think I should stab myself with a nearby sharp object&quot; is not one people normally take. There&#39;s a reason people who think they could be dreaming pinch themselves, or slap themselves in the face, or stomp their feet hard on the ground. There&#39;s less of a chance of bleeding, and almost no chance of small chunks of wood and graphite getting stuck in one&#39;s arm.<br><br>I still say de Sod would order her to be looked over by the Psychs if she did that right in front of him, especially since, to him, the pencil-stabbing was a direct follow-up to him asking her a perfectly routine weapon-proficiency question. It looks as though she&#39;s even more unstable, as though she&#39;s either stabbed herself with a pencil out of nowhere, or is doing so in an attempt to escape being asked any more questions. You have to think of what an action looks like to multiple people in the room. The Marquis de Sod can use thought-speak, but he isn&#39;t a mind reader.</p>

            <p>My descriptions of Flower mental powers have always included surface-thought reading, to help with their distinctly mediocre sight (patterns of light and dark, not really defined images) and hearing (vibration patterns on their petals, not all that well resolved).

            <p>I&#39;d always seen the Flowers&#39; telepathic abilities as more finding minds and seeing minds than reading minds. They&#39;d be able to detect the presence of others, detect species, emotions, or individuals based on the &quot;shape&quot; of the mind, but not find specific thoughts or the causes of those thoughts unless those thoughts affected the detected being&#39;s mental state in a noticeable manner.<br>For an example, if I can phrase this understandably, sudden bursts of fear in a previous state of happiness would change the shape, but just getting more nervous or afraid when one was already nervous or afraid wouldn&#39;t be as easy to detect.<br><br>It&#39;s not really based on anything, but I think it makes sense. I&#39;m pretty sure I created the bit about the mind shapes allowing the Flowers to recognize people in order to fill a story hole somewhere, but I can&#39;t remember where any more.<br><br>I&#39;d already picked up on how they see and hear from reading your trilogy of histories, though. It&#39;s a good model. I have one question, though. If they see patterns of light and darkness rather than detailed images, can they determine individual colors, or just general red end of the spectrum-green-end of the spectrum-violet end of the spectrum interpretation? It&#39;s not very important, all told, but it&#39;s something I was wondering about.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone!<br><br>Just thought you should know that, technically starting Sunday (although actually starting today or so, since a certain modem got shorted--no, I had nothing to accidentally do with that, why do you ask?), I will be lacking internet (except possibly on weekends). I&#39;ll be doing a three-week program, and should have internet back by mid-July; until then, go on without me, brave souls! I shall check in if I have the chance.<br><br>Also, welcome to every newbie I&#39;ve missed (and to all the ones I will miss over the next three weeks)! I&#39;m so glad to meet you all, and I&#39;m sorry this isn&#39;t individualized. Here, have Swiss Bleepolate and Gummyblee Shields (because I can) as Welcome Gifts! Ooh, and take a tribble if you want one (or two), I&#39;ve got a few too many. Remember to feed them responsibly.<br><br>Yours as ever,<br>~DawnFire<br><br>PS: I get the feeling I worded that very strangely at the beginning. For clarity: I will have very limited internet between June 30 and July 18, but it&#39;s also doubtful that I&#39;ll have any over this weekend either, since a modem accidentally got shorted and they&#39;re fixing it the day I&#39;m leaving. So yeah. Unless I come back here before I go, I won&#39;t have even the possibility of internet until, most likely, next weekend. And with that, I&#39;ll assume that this was at least a little clearer and actually post this. ~DF</p>

            <p>Yes, I called it a quest. Anything that people do continuously for extended periods of time can be considered a quest, even if it doesn&#39;t necessarily involve a specific goal, per se. Three weeks is enough time for it to be a quest.<br><br>In fact, here, take some mithril armor in case you find any Questing Beasts. I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re native to mythical France and not modern-day Israel, but you never know. The liveliest of quests can be unpredictable.<br><br>By the way, what&#39;s going to happen with the mission we were working on now? Edgar and Agen____t will need someone to be writing lines for them, and it&#39;s been late enough already due to shenanigans that were largely my fault. Then again, there was already a lot of one person&#39;s character being written by one of the other two contributors, so I suppose you could just come back every once in a while to make sure that your two are in-character.</p>

My thanks, good sir!<br><br>You have a good point about the mission, but don&#39;t we still have at least four parts to write? It&#39;s quite possible that I&#39;ll be back by the time we&#39;re ready to start posting the mission parts. If not, I suppose I can make retroactive edits, or the first three to four posts could be strategically staggered to give me time to come back ;) For the moment, I guess you and Lily can write their lines, and I&#39;ll come back and tweak them...or maybe I&#39;ll be able to check in on weekends, who knows?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>, I have these things to say:<br><br>1/ According to Article 7, we have the equivalent of an &#39;assume good faith&#39; policy. I have no idea of the context, so you&#39;ll have to judge for yourself whether it is possible Desdendelle was making a joke. I make no judgement or comment as to whether you have done so.<br><br>2/ According to Article 1, &#39;attack[ing] others in any form&#39; is forbidden. If Desdendelle&#39;s comment was intended as a &#39;passive-aggressive jab&#39; at Tray-Gnome, then that was wrong.<br><br>3/ According to Article 5, &#39;All respectful opinions that do not attack, insult, or persecute others (see Article 1) are welcome&#39;. Thus, Desdendelle is entitled to hold the opinion that &#39;trance&#39; is bad, and to express that opinion in this community. However, although not explicitly stated (and that&#39;s something we should take not of for the next Constitutional Committee), it is assumed that opinions should be stated respectfully and as an opinion. Again I make no judgement or comment, but note that Tray-Gnome and Lilac Lielac believe the opinion was not stated respectfully, but as a &#39;passive-aggressive jab&#39;.<br><br>4/ According to Article 4, anyone in violation of the Constitution is to be given a chance to &#39;stop and apologise&#39;. Note that there is no clause stating that offending someone is, in and of itself, a violation of the Constitution. People can be offended by many things. However, if someone causes offense by violating the Constitution (in this context, by &#39;otherwise attacking&#39; another member), that <i>is</i> grounds for a stop-and-apologise. In this case the &#39;stop&#39; part appears to have already happened.<br><br>5/ According to Article 9, &#39;The PPC as a community is responsible for upholding the Community&#39;. So, here&#39;s me. Desdendelle, if you are still reading, please contact Tray-Gnome (here, in private, in the IRC, any way) and either clear up the matter to both your satisfactions, or apologise and be done with it.<br><br>6/ According to Article 9, &#39;Grudges are no fun!&#39;. So let&#39;s not anyone hold any, please.<br><br>This has been your Constitutional Lawyering of the Week.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Now, the Constitution points out several times that the responsibility for upholding it lies on the community.

            <p>In fact, I apologise specifically for whatever aspects of my writing are giving you that impression. They were not intended. I was attempting to have a rational conversation, and took your statements very seriously indeed. I wish that had come across.<br><br>I <i>do not know</i> what actions you have taken. You indicate in this post that you have told people about the issues you are having - good. That&#39;s the first step. I <i>do not know who those people were</i>, except that they weren&#39;t me. I <i>do not know</i> if you have asked people who are causing you problems to stop and apologise.<br><br>Except right now. You have indicated that you find me condescending. To the best of my recollection, this is the first time you have said this to me. So: I apologise for coming across as condescending. I am not trying to be condescending. I am trying to help you find a solution to the problems you are having with the community. I believe that solution is inherent in the Constitution we follow - the principle of openness, of telling people when there&#39;s a problem and asking them to stop. If people have been ignoring you when you raise a legitimate grievance with them, or when you ask someone else to do so for you, <i>that is a problem</i>. Specifically, it&#39;s a problem covered by the Constitution.<br><br>I do not want to get into an argument with you. I stepped into this thread when it looked like it was heating up, to point out the solutions found in the Constitution. I did so because said Constitution tells me I could, and because it seemed that you had either been attacked or believed you had. I stepped in <i>on your side</i>.<br><br>You then took that opportunity to lay out your belief that, as I understand it, there are times when people cause serious problems in the PPC and get away with a wrist-slap. You did add that you weren&#39;t talking about Desdendelle, which left me without any idea who you were talking about, if indeed you were talking about someone specific.<br><br>I pointed out what I&#39;ve said in this post, too: that if you&#39;re the only one to see a problem in someone&#39;s actions, you&#39;re the one who needs to start the process of correcting them - or punishing them, if that&#39;s what&#39;s necessary. My questions - &#39;have you asked them to stop? Have you explained what they&#39;re doing wrong?&#39; - were not rhetorical questions, which I think is how you&#39;re reading them, and why you may see them as condescending. They were <i>actual questions</i>, intended to find out how big a problem this actually is. If you haven&#39;t done those things, then perhaps the people you were talking about don&#39;t know about it. If you have, and they are still doing it, then we have a serious problem. <i>I was trying to find out that information</i>, because it would help me to support you in getting people to stop. Again, I was <i>on your side</i>.<br><br>So: once again, I apologise for coming across as condescending. That was not my intent. If you have an issue with anyone else&#39;s current actions, this might be a good opportunity to make those concerns clear, as well. The PPC <i>cannot</i> hold up if people feel they have to let people get to them in the interests of preserving the peace (honourable though that intention is). If someone is causing trouble, they need to be told (in case they don&#39;t know), asked to stop, and if they refuse, a solution needs to be sought.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: No, I don&#39;t feel threatened. I&#39;m not sure why I would, you didn&#39;t say anything threatening. But thank you for apologising.</p>

            <p>First things first.<br>I have never seen a more lazy attempt at an apology.<br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, since that&#39;s how you interpret it.&quot;<br>Is less of a &quot;I&#39;m sorry for being condescending&quot; and more of a &quot;I&#39;m sorry you see me as condescending&quot;.<br>Additionally, you can&#39;t say &quot;I apologise specifically for whatever&quot; because then you&#39;ve both claimed you&#39;re regretful of a specific action, and claimed you have no idea what you should be regretful over.<br><br>Secondly.<br>I don&#39;t think you know what condescending means, because if you did, one would think you&#39;d tone it down a bit, at least in the post where you&#39;re apologizing for being seen as condescending.<br><br>Thirdly.<br>I find it kind of funny, that your response to Tray raising a grievance with you, and mentioning that people have been ignoring them; is to ignore them, and point out that people ignoring them is a problem covered by the constitution.<br><br>Fouthly<br>That was not, in fact, the first time you&#39;ve been told you were condescending. It wasn&#39;t the first time you were told by Tray, and it wasn&#39;t even the first time you&#39;ve been told in this thread.<br><br>Someone is causing trouble. Said person has now been told. Said person has been asked to stop. You haven&#39;t so much as &quot;refused to stop&quot; as much as you have ignored the claim more or less wholesale. I think a solution needs to be sought.</p>

            <p><i>Interlude/Addendum/Forward: Tray and I talked while I was writing this out. He&#39;s leaving the &#39;Board, though I suppose that&#39;s all fairly obvious, but will stick around the IRC. So I don&#39;t expect him to read this; it is aimed at him and Poet merely because they were the ones involved. I would, however, like to take this opportunity to let everyone know that I am utterly </i>done<i> with tone patrolling. If you have a problem with the way someone here writes, unless they say something directly offensive or upsetting, </i>keep it to yourself<i>. &quot;I don&#39;t like the sound of your voice&quot; is not a valid reason to pick fights with someone in the physical world, and &quot;I don&#39;t like the way you write&quot; is an equally invalid reason to pick a fight here. I will also note that it&#39;s not my place to make this call, but I&#39;m saying it anyway, because as per &#39;marketplace of ideas&#39; theory, I suspect that others agree. And that is the end of my forward.</i><br><br>Poet, Tray, you are both stepping over the line here. I almost stepped in initially, a week or so ago, and went &quot;Hey, I think Des was either being snarky, or mentioning a genre he dislikes,&quot; the same way Herr and others often talk about how they dislike modern genres, or some of us have jokingly discounted others&#39; musical preferred genres. I felt like you were taking offense where none was intended, over something as broad as a genre, and was confused.<br><br>What you are doing now - both of you - is utterly and completely out of line. You <i>repeatedly</i> called Huinesoron condescending, Tray called him a condescending ass - and neither of you, at any point, gave a specific answer as to <i>what he did that was condescending</i>. And then you proceed to further attack him for <i>an undefined offense</i>. Come ON, folks. This is the equivalent of telling him you&#39;re offended by one of the words he used, without specifying <i>which</i> word, and then getting angrier and angrier when he keeps using a word that you haven&#39;t yet defined.<br><br>Let me try and get to the point.<br><br>Huinesoron has had an eloquent and specific way of talking for as long as I have known him. He has responded to <i>every post</i> this way, including posts made by <i>Kaitlyn</i>. He has responded with agreement, and disagreement, and jocular side-issues, all with the same level tone. Occasionally with smileys also. I have noticed that sometimes, when he is disagreeing or weighing in on a more complicated topic, he gets more specific in wording, and spells things out more carefully. I do the same thing - it is, I think, because when disagreeing or dealing with complicated issues, you really, really, really want to avoid miscommunication. I guess the way he does this comes off as condescending - but <i>it&#39;s not</i>. He&#39;s not talking down to you. I have never, ever, <i>ever</i> known Huinesoron to think of himself as superior, or to condescend to the people around him. I have never known Neshomeh to talk down to the people around her, or to condescend. The repeated assertions made about them, two people who I care about a great deal, have begun to make me very, very, <i>very</i> angry - and perhaps moreso because there is almost never any backup to this claim. I have never seen anyone give a specific example, even when they have been asked, with an air of &quot;Please help me fix this.&quot; So here&#39;s a suggestion: <i>stop</i>. Stop throwing claims and accusations and issues with people around, unless you are going to dig up the evidence to support your issues.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how hS has not yet snapped and lost his mind with anger and hurt. I&#39;ve seen jabs at him more in this past month or so than I&#39;ve seen leveled at anyone in a long time. <br><br>And now that I&#39;ve raged and Hulk&#39;d and flailed like a rabid dog, let me back up to another thing: <i>this is our home</i>. It&#39;s your home, too. You, gentle reader, this is your home. I assume. Because I assume you are a PPC member.<br><br>This is my home. It is more of a home to me than the house where I was living when I joined, and I have been here longer than I was there. It is the place where I made many of my closest friends, and where I fell in love. It is one of the only places where I have consistently found companionship and safety and peace. I cannot speak for anyone else, but I believe one part or another of that sentence could be agreed upon by many of us.<br><br>We are not whole. None of us are whole. We joke about being insane, many of us, because it is easier and less painful than wailing and weeping about it. I know this goes for most of us, in one way or another. Life has scarred all of us, left us with sensitive places and jagged edges and nerves laid bare to the sun and the wind. Were we meeting in person, and able to see each other&#39;s faces, I suspect we would all know this within a few hours or days of companionship. But instead, we are able to hide behind words, and <i>we forget that we are all wounded</i>. Tray, I care about you. I am angry, I&#39;m not going to deny that, but I know that you have been hurt and scarred and wounded by the life you&#39;ve led. I know that the PPC is something of a haven for you. What I think you may be forgetting is that Huinesoron is also living in a painful and cruel world, and the PPC is also a haven and a home for him. The PPC is a haven and home for Neshomeh, too, and for me, and for <i>so many of us</i>. And we are constantly brushing up against each other&#39;s boundaries, because they are invisible and we are fragile, and so few of us even know when we&#39;ve hurt each other. You can&#39;t usually tell by someone&#39;s text that they&#39;re hurt - and so we keep on shoving past that boundary.<br><br>So I ask you, all of you, to keep that in mind. Keep it in mind, I <i>beg</i> of you, that the person you are about to shout at has also walked through this sharp and cruel world, and they have also, for whatever reason, found a home here. Keep in mind that the person you are angry with needs a safe place and a haven as much as you. Try, <i>please</i> try not to assume that simply because the other person is typing calmly, they are actually calm, or worse, sneering at you. Please remember that we use humor to defuse situations we are unsure of, not as a way of putting down things we aren&#39;t taking seriously. Remember, always, that the other person <i>has feelings</i> and may well be in as much pain, or just as angry, as you.</p>

            <p>What exactly would constitute &#39;[meeting] with respect, or at least a bit of consideration&#39;? I can see a few options:<br><br>1/ Offer an expression of sympathy, which achieves nothing.<br><br>2/ Immediately demand names, offenses, and appropriate punishments.<br><br>&gt;The way Tray-Gnome was talking didn&#39;t necessarily indicate that there were specific people in question. In fact, Tray-Gnome said it was &#39;a general observation&#39;, which led me to the third option:<br><br>3/ Attempt to find out if there were actual people under discussion, by saying something like &#39;If you have noticed people being a problem...&#39;. Then maybe I could have laid out the procedure in the Constitution, to whit: ask them to stop, explain what they&#39;re doing wrong, ask for an apology, and then, if they don&#39;t continue, to ask the community to intervene. I could have pointed out that the only person who can take the first three of those four steps is the person who notices something is wrong - that, in fact, &#39;the responsibility lies on [them] to start the process of fixing it&#39; - ie, to bring it to the community&#39;s attention.<br><br>&gt;This is, in fact, what I did.<br><br>And despite your protestations that a four-year-old would have done the things I suggested, <i>Tray-Gnome hadn&#39;t</i>. Of the two people she specifically named in the follow-up post, the people who she clearly indicated as repeat offenders, one of them was me. Guess what? <b>Tray-Gnome had not previously raised this issue with me</b>. In fact, the last time I had any contact with her, she specifically said that she was not angry with me and never had been. So, the answer to my questions was apparently &#39;no&#39;. Tray-Gnome may have &#39;told people about the issues I&#39;m having&#39; - but she hasn&#39;t <i>raised them with the people who are causing them</i>.<br><br>You equate &#39;it&#39;s your responsibility to start the process&#39; with &#39;sorry, no one else notices so you have to go solve it on your own&#39;. That&#39;s not what I meant to say. What I meant was more along the lines of: <b>the person who notices is the only person who can start things</b>.If you notice something, you need to call people&#39;s attention to it. I have not seen Tray-Gnome do this on the Board in about a year. I do not know what has happened in the IRC; that&#39;s why I was asking. However, I do know that neither of the people she named use the IRC.<br><br><i>Lastly, in her response, Tray said you were treating her like a child, and that no-one listens to her. She also outlined what the problem was, albeit in an upset tone.<br><br>Your response to this, was to say that you were sorry she thought you were condescending, and then tried to give reasons as to why you weren&#39;t condescending.<br><br>So in other words, you didn&#39;t listen to her, exactly like she said happens.</i><br><br>Okay, I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re actually not noticing my words, or deliberately ignoring them.<br><br><font size="5">I apologise for coming across as condescending. That was not my intent.</font><br><br>That <b>in no way</b> equates to &#39;I&#39;m sorry you thought I was condescending&#39;. It equates to &#39;I&#39;m sorry I sounded that way&#39;. The former shifts responsibility onto the listener - the latter retains it in its entirety for myself. I offered the explanation of my intentions as a way of reassuring her that the offence was accidental, not deliberate. If someone offends me in some way, that&#39;s something I&#39;d want to know, not something I would get angry at them for telling me.<br><br>And no, Tray-Gnome did not use an &#39;upset tone&#39;. She used a deliberately and aggressively insulting tone. She used my genuine attempt to help to attack me with pointless namecalling, and to tell me off for asking a question (to which the answer was &#39;no&#39;), and to attack another member of this community who has not spoken to her in a year.<br><br><i>7. If someone says something that seems offensive, but you’re not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. Astonishingly enough, most people aren’t out to offend anyone. [...] Don&#39;t be afraid to ask what someone meant- it isn&#39;t silly to want the full facts.</i><br><br>You and Tray-Gnome have completely ignored this section of the Constitution. Riese gave a nice example of the sort of response that <b>should</b> be given in this case - indicating the impression that was given, assuming good faith, and politely suggesting I &#39;double-check in the future&#39;. Had that been the only reply, I would have come back with &#39;I sounded condescending? I&#39;m sorry, I definitely didn&#39;t mean to. I was trying to [this this this]. Can you specify how it sounded condescending, so I can watch it in the future?&#39;. You and Tray-Gnome did not. You launched an aggressive attack, refused to accept any of the <b>six separate apologies</b> I have offered, and in fact have spent most of your words in this thread dissecting in great detail why my apologies are not good enough for you. Whether in person or by proxy, Tray-Gnome has made absolutely no effort to apologise for her direct attacks and flames.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You apologised specifically for crossing a line in one post, not for your consistent assumption of bad faith on my part prior to that post. Neither have you offered any apology or even acknowledgement on Tray-Gnome’s behalf that she flamed me.<br><br>I only responded because I understood that you wanted to talk this out and clarify the motivations on either side. This you have completely failed to do. Instead, you have imparted motives to me which are so far from true it’s not even funny, repeatedly and totally misrepresented my words, ignored my question as to what would have constituted ‘respect’ and ‘consideration’, and refused to even consider the very serious concerns I raised with your behaviour and Tray-Gnome’s. <br><br>And, since you have now claimed it repeatedly, I’m going to address the point that ‘<i>I&#39;ve had tray tell me specifically she&#39;s told you [‘You can be condescending sometimes’] before.</i>: I’ve made a comprehensive search of the Board history and read every email Tray-Gnome and I have ever exchanged, and I can’t find any instance of her raising this concern, even obliquely. She appears to be mistaken. If someone needs to see the exact results of my search, I’m perfectly willing to share them.<br><br>But hey, for all that, I’m going to let the whole thing drop. You can keep your apologies. I don’t particularly need them. All I will close by saying is that I urge you to ensure you are following the guidelines laid out in the PPC Constitution.

            <p>I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t mean to, but the tone of that last post comes across as being extremely condescending.   As I&#39;m sure you would never treat a fellow PPC-er like a small child in need of a reprimand, I won&#39;t make an issue of it.

            <p>Hello! I was lurking around your wiki (Shiny!) and I thought I might introduce myself.

I&#39;ve also a bit nutty and awkward. So I guess this is all for now.<br><br></p>

            <p>So. In the event that the PPC went to the quiet little resort town of Silent Hill, Maine...<br><br>- What has OOC resistance? Do the monsters have OOC immunity? The reason I reckon that the monsters do is that they&#39;re creations of the town, which is a sentient, deific force in its own right.<br><br>- Would the infamous sirens make a good substitute for bells in an exorcism?<br><br>- How much would the Flowers disapprove of passing off Sues to Pyramid Head?<br><br>- If the town REALLY hates the Sue, would it do the sirens for us?<br><br>- Should anything or anyone other than the town itself be aware of the PPC? Like, say, Alessa Gillespie or Walter Sullivan.<br><br>- Would particularly crazy/evil agents draw the attention of the town? Or would it just give then a pass because a) nothing it can do is worse than the agents just being on duty, and b) they&#39;re basically getting rid of the town&#39;s warts (Read: Sues)?</p>

            <p>This isn&#39;t solely addressed to you, Voyd, but rather to everyone: What is the deal with making characters OOC resistant/immune lately?<br><br>I&#39;m confused, and slightly worried, because this isn&#39;t a thing that has ever been common or required at all, but now it seems like people are assuming this is something that Must Exist in every continuum—and worse, that it&#39;s Serious PPC Business instead of an odd little quirk of fanfic that&#39;s occasionally good for laughs. In just the last couple of months or so, I&#39;ve seen questions like this regarding Bionicle, <i>Star Trek</i>, <i>Doctor Who</i>, and now this. To me, that constitutes a trend.

            <p>The way it looks to me:<br><br>Nesh: Serious question people!<br>hS: Conspiracy theory!<br>Rest of the Board: YAY CONSPIRACY THEORY!<br><br>So I will answer the serious question, because I too have seen that trend.<br><br>As the person who brought it up for <i>Star Trek</i>, I can explain why: We want our favorite characters to be special. Not Suvian-special, but their own kind of special. We want them to be able to retain what we love about them even in an environment that tends to suck that away. And if the character is particularly strong in canon, we like to think that they&#39;d stay that way, even if they don&#39;t.<br><br>And the current writings on OOC Resistance/Immunity are...well, they leave it open. You maintain that this comes from being ignored in badfic, and I agree, but this is from the page on OOC Resistance: &quot;<i>Unusual wisdom or magical power, especially experience with mind-control or illusions, may allow a character to see through the Sue&#39;s deception. Deities and demideities, when they are not outright OOC immune, are usually OOC resistant by default.</i>&quot; I was going off the &quot;experience with mind control&quot; thing for Picard. Many characters have magical powers and many continua have god-like beings.<br><br>So, we have a tendency to protect our favorite characters and are given a broad definition that allows many characters in. Can you blame people for asking questions?<br><br>Bluntly, the definition you told me doesn&#39;t go with the rest of the wiki. I agree with your definition because because I know characters that are strong in canon are warped in badfic. For example, Vulcans would be OOC-Resistant by the &quot;unusual powers&quot; bit, but I know for a fact that Suethors have a pathological inability to write Vulcans in character. (I think it has to do with the logic thing.) But Elrond is listed as OOC-Resistant, and how many times have we seen him agree to Tenth Walkers? He doesn&#39;t seem resistant to me, and I think that he only is because he&#39;s awesome and people want him to be, and the definition is open to that interpretation.</p>

            <p>Thank you for addressing the question. {= )<br><br>So, basically what I&#39;m hearing is that the wiki is wrong and should be fixed so as not to further mislead people who haven&#39;t actually read the source material.<br><br>I definitely get the tendency to want to protect and promote our favorite characters, and I agree some of that was going on with Elrond, known favorite of Agent Jay. However, IIRC, Elrond being OOC resistant in the Original Series didn&#39;t imply that the Sues couldn&#39;t have their way with him, but simply that he was aware of it to some degree and remained in control just enough to faintly show his confusion/displeasure as he mouthed his idiotic lines. OOC resistance does not equal an ability to avoid or throw off Sueish control if it&#39;s directed at the character in question—that may be the key thing that should be cleared up.<br><br>I don&#39;t blame anyone for asking questions. Asking questions is good! That&#39;s how we learn! What strikes me about this is <i>several</i> people asking much the <i>same</i> questions in a <i>relatively small</i> timespan, which looks like a trend and makes me wonder what prompted it. That wiki article has been there for longer than the past couple of months, so what I&#39;m really curious about is: why is this a big thing all of a sudden?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sure nobody wants to deal with an omnipresent entity being character replaced.

It&#39;s more like OOC Avoidance, since nobody really bothers to get him OOC in the first place.</p>

            <p>Well, it does if I&#39;m mixing my metaphors, which I am.<br><br>It&#39;s one thing to deal with OOC in-universe deities. You could use special out-of-continuum god-killing measures to get at them, or otherwise render them powerless so that they could be eliminated. When it&#39;s actually a version of the World One Judeo-Christian God with a big G, getting rid of him is essentially saying &quot;Yeah, <i>we killed God</i>.&quot; and that, well, it&#39;s not exactly a good thing to be assassinating World One religious figures, even in the form of character replacements.<br>It&#39;s why barely anyone goes into fanfiction based on religious doctrines. It exists, since people will write badfic about anything, but it wouldn&#39;t exactly look good if one&#39;s characters were on record as having shoved a duplicate of Jesus into a volcano.</p>

            <p>1/ As you may have noticed, Mort and Elanor didn&#39;t kill &#39;Yahweh God&#39;. They killed his frankly bizarre Mary-Sue companion, which prompted a rather dramatic return to in-character-ness.<br><br>2/ The reason &#39;barely anyone&#39; - in fact, no-one - does missions in religion-based fandoms is because we&#39;ve banned it, because it&#39;s incredibly hard to do right, and liable to be wildly offensive. This mission predates that discussion, and was in fact the specific trigger for the discussion (although no-one, to my recollection, had a specific problem with this mission). So your explanation for why no-one kills those badfics is... inaccurate, shall we say. It&#39;s not about shoving deities into volcanos - it&#39;s about all the little ways such a mission could cause offense and slip into disrespect.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>1) I was saying that having a World One religious figure be replaced would mean that she or she might need to be killed, which would cause problems for several different reasons. I suppose they could always be recruited, if they were only severely OOC and not Sued when they were replaced, but it would be really weird talking to someone at the lunch table who says &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m Buddha. I try to stay away from roads as much as possible.&quot; Your mission had an OOC World One religious figure, but he wasn&#39;t replaced, which sidestepped a few points of precedent, but did so while simultaneously avoiding a lot of potential mess, so I&#39;m hardly saying it was bad that you decided not to have a Yahweh vs. Wentway Slamdown. Yours was a better choice, considering the alternatives.<br><br>2) Ah, so yours was the only religion-based mission, and is now the only one ever to exist due to a rule change. I did not know that. I thought that there might have been more, but I hadn&#39;t read them if there were. That&#39;s that cleared up.<br>The &quot;we don&#39;t want to disrespect others or their religions&quot; angle was what I was trying to go for, but I may have phrased it poorly. I was using an extreme example, the volcano-dropping, out of a whole myriad of problems that might offend people to try and reiterate why going up against religious figures would not be a good idea. Sorry for the miscommunication there.</p>

            <p>(Tangents are fun!)<br><br>&#39;Yahweh God&#39;, as presented in the badfic, was actually fairly low-powered. I don&#39;t recall him doing <i>anything</i>, but let&#39;s allow for my memory being faulty and assume he was indestructable with Generic Magic Powers.<br><br>Mortic, on the flip-side, is a member of the Order. He is immortal and actually ludicrously old (he says somewhere that he and the Order were involved in sorting out the furore after the biblical Exodus), and possesses all sorts of special abilities. Most of these seem to spring from &#39;Order incantations&#39;, referenced as &#39;spells&#39; (with the quotes), for things like improved sight and clinging to the ceiling (but not navigating HQ). He also has increased physical and mental durability. All we know about the origin of these powers is that they&#39;re <i>not</i> Judeo-Christian - he explicitly doesn&#39;t know much about Christianity.<br><br>So how would a fight between them go? We know that Mortic is slightly stronger than a surprised &#39;Yahweh God&#39;, but I suspect that means that if YG got his feet under him, he could win a physical fight pretty quickly. Given that he also has wings, he could certainly catch Mortic on open ground, even with Order faster-running incantations.<br><br>A maze-like environment where Mortic could hide from YG might be the best site for a long-running battle. I&#39;m positive the Order has ways to hide from even &#39;omnicogniscient&#39; beings (though I don&#39;t know if this YG even is), and if there&#39;s anything that could kill or trap him, Mort - as a PPC agent, not even needing Order training - could eventually find it. His Order abilities would basically serve as an escape method for when his quarry came too close.<br><br>But in an enclosed environment like the tent in the mission... Mort&#39;s abilities are very much self-focussed. He can improve his own eyesight, his speed, probably his strength and reaction times - but he has no way to affect anyone else. He can&#39;t make YG vulnerable to attack. PPC tech might provide an answer, in that he could a) open a portal to somewhere inhospitable, or b) [and I don&#39;t know if this would even work] potentially use a D.O.R.K.S. to disguise/transform YG into something harmless. I&#39;ve never seen that done, but given the transformative nature of disguises (Jay gained magic powers in disguise as a Maia), it seems like it should.<br><br>But in a straight fight? YG wins, no question.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Like I said to hS, the two types of OOC-Resistance should be differentiated somehow, because it is confusing and led me to suspect Elrond was based on pure lusting. (Which it is, but it does actually manifest as more than another thing to make Elrond look cool.) More characters have his type of OOC-Resistance, I think. By that I mean Picard and many more <i>Star Trek</i> characters.<br><br>I know I happened to be making the wiki pages for the different <i>Star Trek</i>s at the time, but that wasn&#39;t what other people were doing. I don&#39;t know, maybe we just have a lot of naive newbies? I don&#39;t know if we normally have this many, but I&#39;ve seen a lot.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m casting my vote for keeping the OOC Resistance term for cases like Elrond, in which characters cannot stop the author from controlling them, but their minds are to some degree unaffected, and creating a new term, which I&#39;m calling OOC Avoidance, for cases like Gimli where the author simply ignores the character and thus submits them to a lower or nonexistent level of Suefluence, as I first suggested <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=245669;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>.<br><br>Yes, that post is part of the same thread as this one, but if this particular thread keeps growing at the rate it is now, everyone&#39;s going to need to keep track of the posts that they proposed ideas in.</p>

            <p>I agree that we need to give the different forms different names, if only to keep them straight among ourselves.<br><br>:: checking the wiki ::  Right now, we&#39;ve got three different flavors of OOC Resistance listed as examples.  Gimli and Gaspode are normally ignored by Suethors (unless they want to bash Gimli&#39;s character) so they never get targeted by Suefluence, Elrond has a magical artifact on his finger that shields him from full Suefluence but lets a Suethor puppet him, and the Valar are demideities who can probably fight off Suefluence on their own.<br><br>To be honest, I&#39;m not convinced characters ignored by the Suethor should have OOC Resistance.  I&#39;ve never been shot, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m bulletproof; a character who never gets targeted by a Sue shouldn&#39;t be assumed to be resistant to her powers.  If we change this, though, Gimli and Gaspode should be grandfathered in.<br><br>What about OOC Defense for characters like Elrond, who retain control of at least part of their mind but can&#39;t prevent themselves from being manipulated by a Sue?</p>

            <p>I&#39;d rather not have rules that require &quot;grandfathering in&quot; bits from previous material without having said material explained or supported in some way by the new material. It just brings across the vibe of &quot;why are these ones so special&quot; when looked at from an in-universe perspective.<br><br><br>That&#39;s why I was suggesting a name change from OOC Resistant in the case of the Gimli/Gaspode-style characters that are just not dealt with often. In fact, when affected by the Suefluence, Gimli has been shown, at least in the missions I&#39;ve read, to be almost as affected, if not just as affected, as characters like Boromir are. It just happens less often.<br><br>My idea for calling it OOC Avoidance and Cyba Zero&#39;s for OOC Overlooked speak more to what&#39;s really happening: the Sue just doesn&#39;t care about those particular characters most of the time.<br>I prefer my term idea to Cyba&#39;s, largely because I think it would be difficult to conjugate Overlooked. You can say &quot;has immunity&quot;, &quot;has resistance&quot;, or to use your term idea, &quot;has defense&quot;, but you can&#39;t really say &quot;has overlooked&quot;, unless you&#39;re saying it&#39;s the character themselves overlooking something.<br>I suppose you could say &quot;has been overlooked&quot;, but that sounds more like it&#39;s a product of the situation than a recurring characteristic of a specific character.<br><br><br>By the same logic as your bit about not being bulletproof when you were never shot, wouldn&#39;t a character who was frequently affected by something not have an effective defense against it? I think the OOC Resistance term actually works in the case of Elrond-style characters: they do what the Words say, but they don&#39;t like it, and those with psionic abilities could look into their heads and see that they are mentally protesting it all the way, to the extent that in a lull in the story, they might be able to clench their fist in anger or kick something, or possibly perform a small action to get back at the Sue out of spite if they are capable of recognizing said character as the cause of their problems.</p>

            <p>Since I should really contribute, having started all this in the first place...<br><br>1. Let&#39;s not get too carried away. After all, the main thing I keep repeating is that <i>this thing is not a big deal</i>. So let&#39;s not make renaming it a big deal. If it seems like a good idea, fine, but if it&#39;s going to be more trouble than it&#39;s worth, I think it&#39;s safe to just clarify the article and move on.<br><br>2. With regards to clarifying the article, I think a close reading of the relevant bits of TOS would be an extremely good thing to do first, since that&#39;s the origin and ultimate basis for the concept(s) we&#39;re supposed to be describing. Also, references on the pages, so future PPCers don&#39;t have to do the work of tracking down the relevant bits all over again.<br><br>3. We shouldn&#39;t neglect influential non-mission materials such as <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/SIELU/anti-lustin.html">the original description of Anti-Lustin™</a>, which is based on modified dwarf blood proteins. (OTOH, what with the increase in Dwarf-Sues since <i>The Hobbit</i>, perhaps that coveted Dwarven resistance to Sue-induced lust is no longer reliable and enterprising biochemists should be considering alternatives before the agents taking the drug start to lose it—perhaps unpredictably, at times when it would be the most hilarious....) &quot;<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Suedom">Suedom</a>&quot; also leans heavily on the idea that Gimli and Йowyn can fight off Suefluence and thus are able to aid Kate and Kira on their quest.<br><br>4. Never forget that out-of-universe, this is all for the lulz and not everything has to make perfect logical sense and fit into neat little boxes. The wiki is mainly there to <i>describe</i> the madness and help to navigate it, not to make it fit some kind of Universal Theory of the PPC. It&#39;s perfectly fine for Dwarves to be resistant to Suefluence because it was a running joke once. It&#39;s also perfectly fine for present writers to ignore that entirely if it&#39;s funnier to show Thorin Oakenshield going googly-eyed at Thorina Ramsbuttsdotter. The PPC has no logic. The PPC needs no logic.<br><br>If I seem to be contradicting myself, it&#39;s only because I love logical sense and neat little boxes exactly as much as I love the PPC&#39;s in-jokes and random silliness, and I don&#39;t have a problem with paradoxes. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>OOC Defense or OOC Resistance for characters like Elrond sounds good.<br><br>Given your arguments, another term for Gimli-type characters might be in order, although OOC Avoidance doesn&#39;t quite sound right to me.

            <p>To respond to your comments, and without any citations because it&#39;s bedtime:<br><br>The two &#39;classic&#39; OOC Resistant characters are Gimli and Elrond. Both of them got it way back in the Original Series, and for different reasons. Gimli&#39;s is what Nesh said: he&#39;s ignored in most badfics (because he&#39;s, liek, short an hairy an gross - or so J&amp;A theorised), so he doesn&#39;t get knocked OOC very much.<br><br>Elrond is a different kettle of fish, and honestly, I think he only got it because Jay was an Elrond luster. But J&amp;A attributed it to, yes, his inherent wisdom, and I think to him holding one of the Three Rings.<br><br>There is a key difference, though: Gimli was often portrayed as actively hostile towards Sues - glaring at them, for instance. Elrond, on the other hand, was more of a &#39;you can tell he doesn&#39;t want to say that!&#39;; he wasn&#39;t <i>fooled</i> by the Sues, but he was firmly <i>controlled</i>.<br><br>To be quite honest, I don&#39;t think the two phenomena should even be under the same term. I don&#39;t know what it <i>ought</i> to be, though - and since I&#39;ve never used either term (or even the concept), I don&#39;t have a terribly strong investment in it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Conspiracy theories are fun!<br><br>And actually, that ties in with my response, because while I suspected Jay&#39;s lusting was the reason I thought it was just me imagining some conspiracy. Because there&#39;s a plot to make LOTR the dominant fandom in the PPC, right? And part of that plot is to make all the LOTR characters the most awesomely powerful, right? (Or the PPC started in LOTR, and therefore it <i>was</i> the dominant fandom for a while, and what makes me paranoid is residual traces of that.)<br><br>I agree that there should be a distinction, because I got confused (though now I understand).

            <p>I suspect you were just being facetious there, but that&#39;s exactly the sort of thinking I&#39;m trying to get people away from, and why people trying to make OOC resistance into a Big Thing worries me. It&#39;s not a big deal, it&#39;s not awesomely powerful, and it should not be treated as a status symbol to make anyone&#39;s favorite characters more special—<i>especially</i> when the question involves making them <s>friends with agents</s> aware of the PPC. That way lies the Urple Side.<br><br>However, when the circumstances are appropriate, it <i>should</i> be used to point out that driving normally wise characters to say moronic things is bad, and it <i>should</i> be used to call out the fanbase for sidelining characters that aren&#39;t &quot;hawt.&quot; Those reasons involve insight and potentially humor, and are good.<br><br>Quite possibly you didn&#39;t need that lecture, but I needed to stress the point again.<br><br>On another note, correct me if I&#39;m overreacting, but I&#39;m getting the sense that you find the fact that we&#39;re strongly rooted in LotR to be a bad thing. I mean... yeah, the PPC is originally based in the LotR fandom, for a long time most of our members were big Tolkien nuts, and many of our core concepts and traditions come from that time and that group of people. It&#39;s not a conspiracy, just our history. Do you see that as a problem?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Being facetious, that is. But being above mind control is kind of a power, and something that makes a character cool. <br><br>No, I don&#39;t find the LOTR roots to be a bad thing. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m not a huge Tolkien fan, so when the Board goes back towards those roots it makes me feel left out. And I&#39;m probably not the only one. Also, the way Tolkien&#39;s work sometimes seems to be held up as a flawless masterpiece worries me. I know that most of the time it&#39;s just an expression of &quot;these are good books how dare a Suethor trample all over them&quot;, but I get wary of any thinking that doesn&#39;t sound balanced. Not just in the PPC but all of fandom, and I&#39;d like to think we&#39;re better than that here.<br><br>I do respect that other people like it more, and I like that it is kind of a universal fandom. Bottom line, if we start acting like a LOTR community it makes me feel left out, but most of the time we&#39;re multi-fandom with roots in LOTR, and that&#39;s cool. <br><br>I hope that clears things up. </p>

            <p>I believe (and please correct me if I am wrong, guys) that some of the LotR fans feel that they are being left behind as the group becomes less LotR centric, and more diverse.  They feel less relevant.

            <p>The first group, often oldbies, are LotR fans, generally into fantasy literature, tend to get things like Mercedes Lackey and Discworld and Diana Wynne Jones and Anne McCaffrey. I know I&#39;ve felt left behind by the moving away from those fandoms before, and, though this is probably partly my own thin-skinned-ness, I&#39;ve occasionally felt slighted by the way people react to LotR fannishness and high fantasy enthusiasm by seemingly putting it down as snobbery.<br><br>The second group I&#39;d call middlebies, though that&#39;s an oversimplification and not entirely correct for other reasons.

I&#39;d characterize this group as being more into newer fandoms, fandoms that are integral to their experiences as... er, fans, as LotR and Discworld and Redwall were to others of us. The ones that stand out to me in immediate memory are Halo, Bionicle, Hetalia... er, and others. I may think of more at some point, but you guys probably know what I mean.<br><br>There is a looooot of overlap here - I&#39;m not thinking these are exclusive groups!

            <p>That feeling was most prominent in the era - a few years back now - where every mission, badfic, or discussion seemed to be either:<br><br>a) Araeph doing <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i><br><br>b) Laburnum doing <i>Redwall</i><br><br>c) Or about a dozen people doing various anime shows.<br><br>I seem to recall actually being told that people weren&#39;t interested in LotR... and Kaitlyn says that period is when-and-why she stopped posting.<br><br>However, I have no problem with <i>diversity</i>. And to your &#39;try to do something&#39; I would add an important point: it&#39;s not enough to do something <i>once</i>. If you write one <i>The Kraken-Knights of Wintertide</i> mission, people will go &#39;meh, I&#39;ve never heard of KKW&#39;. If you write a series - and write them in such a way that people get a feel for the canon by reading your missions - you end up with readers and possible converts. Most of my Harry Potter knowledge comes from missions, for example.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Sadly, no, <i>The Kraken-Knights of Wintertide</i> is not a real thing. Maybe for NaNo 2015... ~hS<br><br>PPS: I haven&#39;t read <i>Thomas Covenant</i> for a very good reason - I was gifted a single-volume work by the same author (specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordant%27s_Need">Mordant&#39;s Need</a>) and really, really didn&#39;t like Donaldson&#39;s writing style. Some of the comments on Wikipedia suggest the same would hold true in his more famous work. ~hS</p>

            <p>Defensively changing the subject, are you? Attempting to redirect attention from the original question with your comment about a lawn that I am nowhere near? Perhaps you <i>are</i> the creature after all, using reverse psychology to try and convince me that you weren&#39;t by saying that you are and phrasing it as though it was a joke.<br><br>But wait, no, that&#39;s far too obvious. You&#39;d know I&#39;d know that. Perhaps this goes even deeper, and the creature has been replacing you as well, along with an untold number of other Boarders. Perhaps this is simply the first crack in its facade for months, and it is trying to patch it up.<br><br>But you&#39;d know that I&#39;d know that you know, because any good planner anticipates their plan not going as planned, so perhaps someone finding out was part of the plan. But it wasn&#39;t me that found out! It was Huinesoron that found out, and he only revealed it by cryptically stating that he wasn&#39;t allowed to reveal names or details. So perhaps it was planned that in order for the plan to proceed, someone would need to find out the plan.<br><br>But of course, if someone found out that the plan had been for someone to find out the plan, as I have, then what would your plan be then? Or perhaps the plan involved seeing how people reacted to your plan, and then the plan would be selected from one of several possible plans based on the reaction.<br><br>Yet, now that I know that you have multiple plans, but I don&#39;t know which plan you have chosen, this could mean that either the plan will be intended to keep others off your trail, or to reveal a portion of said plan but without the information necessary to stop said plan, which would divide the resistant faction between the people who feel that the plan was complete and would thus react on incomplete information and the group that knows that the plan is incomplete but has no further information to act on.<br><br>Unless you know that I know that your plan involves multiple plans, and it was actually going in a completely different direction this entire time and the bits of said plan revealed so far are only another diversion intended to make the plan look easier to deal with, which is always a possibility.<br><br>(I feel like Vizzini from the Princess Bride right now, with all of my dizzying leaps of questionable logic.)</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I do not currently have the cipher for your code, so I&#39;ll have to make it clear using only the power of my brain.<br><br>Custard. This is the link from previous posts. It may be custard as it is, or perhaps custard as a symbol of this conspiracy in particular. Perhaps &quot;custard&quot; is the indicator that not everything in the remainder of the phrase is not what it appears.<br><br>A baker. Creates edible food from inedible components. Symbolic of a creator. Perhaps one who instigates. The designer or instigator of events alluded to by the rest of the phrase, perhaps.<br>However, Baker&#39;s Square indicates a location, a place where multiple bakers, or in this case instigators, gather. People are planning something. Not only planning, but as a baker will create from his or her oven with materials they have, and exchange recipes amongst other bakers, this implies that multiple people who are forming that plan together are pooling their resources in an attempt to make their plan a reality.<br><br>That only leaves the pie. A pastry of many meanings. It can be comedy, as in a pie in the face, or of sinister purpose, as in the blades or tools smuggled in through use of pies. Though its association with the bakers implies that it is the final product of their labor, its specific purpose is unknown. However, in context, its purpose becomes sinister.<br>A pie is, in its most basic concepts a pastry made to serve multiple people. You could also make the same case for cake, but while cake can be shaped into numerous forms, the nature and consistency of pie means that it is, more often than not, restricted to basic geometric shapes such as circles and squares. Thus, multiple people are gathering to cause something to fall apart...<br><br>Gasp! A conspiracy! Not only that, but a conspiracy used to hide another conspiracy! Hidden somewhere in the conspiracy we are dealing with now hides another, using the propagation of this conspiracy theory as a way to advance its own plans! But thanks to this cryptically ambiguous post, I now know about that conspiracy to keep this conspiracy theory upheld as the sole conspiracy theory! Thus, I can now begin my investigation anew!<br><br>HA! Take <i>that</i>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzntZLHcYy0&amp;noredirect=1">evils of ancient Egypt</a>!<br><br>Wow, my bulletin board is absolutely covered in string and scraps of paper now. I&#39;m even still wearing my blue lab coat from a few threads down, so I have something that can billow dramatically while I pace the floor. I feel like a genuine conspiracy theorist.</p>

            <p>WHAT? My exaggerated conspiracy theory idea that was based on nothing whatsoever was <i>incorrect</i>? Imagine that!<br><br>I was just having fun with the response. My ramblings about a hypothetical flavor of ice cream being connected to the ill-defined conspiracy theory intersected with your response about custard and pies.<br>Also, I still have no idea what or where Baker&#39;s Square is. I thought it was an actual town square someplace, and you&#39;re saying it&#39;s a restaurant, and you&#39;re probably right, since you mentioned it in the fist place, but the frame of reference for that short sentence was just sort of out of nowhere. So, I decided to make more random assumptions based even more out of nowhere.<br>Confusing? Yes. I&#39;m not going to say it wasn&#39;t. Mad ramblings about cracking coded messages are usually confusing, and I made mine ridiculous on purpose. After all, what fun is there in making sense?</p>

<li>OOC resistance and immunity are not something that should just be assigned.  They are, rather, things that are exhibited in fanfic.  For instance, Gimli is often ignored by Sues, which means that he is often fairly in character (OOC resistance).  In the case of immunity, that is often reserved for the in-universe Creator.  I don&#39;t think Silent Hill counts in that sense.  It didn&#39;t create the universe and, in fact, is likely being warped by any Sue present.<br><br>- I am assuming sirens make a lot of noise, so they could work in place of a bell.  Also, there is every reason to believe that the world would be helping to cleanse itself.  Seems like it could use the sirens to aid you, though I think you are looking for a wraith in that case, not a Sue.<br><br>- If a punishment is bad enough that you have to ask if the Flowers would disapprove, then you probably shouldn&#39;t be doing it.  I cannot stress this enough.<br><br>- Pyramid Head, being the most easily recognizable character in the series, is actually sometimes the target of Sues.  I don&#39;t think that sending them to him is a good plan.<br><br>- Why should they be aware of the PPC?  That&#39;s what Neuralyzers are for, after all.  No real reason the town should even be aware, once the canon snaps back to normal.<br><br>- What ever is funnier.<br><br><br>-Phobos</li>

She does have a Sue-fluence, but it&#39;s weaker than I&#39;ve seen before (still somewhat strong, though). She, however, is also rich (though according to her, not privileged). I skipped quite a lot of it, but she doesn&#39;t seem to have a &quot;tortured past&quot;. She knows about her father being Sirius Black and gets bullied for it, however she learns about her mother&#39;s violent fate (without that much detail) around the same time Harry learns Sirius is his godfather. The Golden Trio are her only friends at Hogwarts, but she has a friend on the outside, as well as family members and Professor Lupin. <br><br>Mainly, it needs a beta. Choppy handling of pacing, though that&#39;s not an official offense....is it? Grammar is passable if you ignore the comma offenses that everyone seems to make (and my pet peeve. I don&#39;t even want to write a mission, I just want to copy and paste it into my word program and rewrite the stupid thing). Also, multiple minis (Hermior and Rom, anyone?)<br><br>Final Rating: On a scale of one - five, four. Not horrifying, but not good either. Alissa is a Mary Sue who has a lot of Sue traits, but compared to Ebony Dark&#39;ness Dementia Raven/Tara Way (or other LoTR sues I&#39;ve seen from various missions), she isn&#39;t the most horrible thing I&#39;ve ever seen (though she speaks fluent Russian, which is so evident throughout the story you have to wonder if the author is Russian/has Russian relatives, or if she thought it was cool. Also, who is worse than Ebony ........). The story is rather badly written- while it has passable grammar, the few metaphors are horrible, and the story flows so badly that even the portions rewritten from canon seem choppy. While JKR, I&#39;ll admit, is no William Shakespeare, I don&#39;t remember the books being choppy. Comma neglect is extremely apparent, and several minis can be spotted, such as &#39;Rom&#39; and &#39;Hermior&#39;. This is completely safe for the brain, and actually slightly boring but irritating.  </p>

            <p>You see, unlike round characters, who experience a wide range of emotions, Mary Sues are driven by one or both of the following: lust, i.e. OMG SO HOTT!!1!, or irrational anger, i.e. when they flip out for negligible reasons, potentially leading to vaporizing someone with speshul powers or over-complicated revenge plans that work as intended despite all logic to the contrary.<br><br>Removing lust, therefore, would remove one of the core tenets of a Suvian&#39;s psychological being. The effects of this are debatable, but I&#39;d imagine chief among them would be a drastic decrease in sanity. Considering that Suvians are none too stable to begin with, and often possess off-the-charts levels of power, an insane one could create massive problems.<br><br>They might even quickly default to the one remaining core emotion, anger, and go on a clichй-borne psychopathic rampage. Doing so would make no sense from a psychological standpoint, but bad psychology is what makes a Sue a Sue, and so it would be perfectly plausible for them.<br><br>At least, that&#39;s my theory. Someone else might have a better one.</p>

            <p>Sues can run the whole emotional spectrum, but the emotions are trivialized, e.g. wangst. However, individual Sues can limit themselves to only a few - the one I&#39;m currently sporking seems to be either wangsty or aggressive. The other characters say that that she&#39;s normally cheerful, but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence to support that claim.<br><br>So it would really depend on what kind of Sue you use for these experiments I see you&#39;re planning down the thread.</p>

            <p>Either way, it&#39;s not the claim of having emotions as much as the way they&#39;re represented that makes a subset of characters able to experience them. I suppose one could make the case that Sues are at least capable of experiencing happiness, but their happiness is usually either a concentrate of their lust, not always for the designated &quot;hott&quot; character, but also for things like power or self-elevation, or of triumph, which isn&#39;t really an emotion either.<br><br>Then again, I know that the possibility of a Sue capable of experiencing a wider variety of emotions exists, because some of their number are capable of being made into more developed characters through either rewriting or recruitment. So this presents a potential contradiction. There may be something within their neuroglitter structural array that shifts based on character growth. I see another experiment on the horizon!<br><br>Still, I&#39;ll keep the possibility of full-emotional-spectrum Sues in mind when selecting a test subject.<br>Your contributions to the study are appreciated. Lab coat? We have them in traditional white, along with gray, dark blue, and black. We had a green one, but it was that ugly bright green color that some people call &quot;neon green&quot;, and I shoved it in the closet. I don&#39;t know why people say certain colors are &quot;neon&quot;. Neon glows in the low orange range; any colors outside that portion of the spectrum are, by default, not neon. </p>

            <p>We can set up an Endgame:Singularity-style reality bubble, with the only means of observation and control being quantum entanglement communicators; if the Sue gets dangerous power is cut, the reality bubble collapses and the creature is trapped in Generic Space due to Singularity never describing the effects of such a sub-existence ending.<br><br>Alternatively one can create an inverted Reality Room: Unrealistic space (as well as lab equipment and the specimen) on the inside, realistic space and a fatal obstacle (high-energy electric fence, perhaps?) on the outside.

            <p>That is, given that the entanglement communicators can operate machinery. We&#39;d need to keep all sentient and sapient life forms outside the Sue&#39;s influence in case of a power level jump.<br>We&#39;d also want to make sure we put in countermeasures in case of reality bubble collapse; if the effects of the bubble ending were never determined, setting them would put the Schrцdinger-Martinez effect out of flux, collapsing the probabilistic waveform. That in itself is not a bad thing, but anything that results from bits of reality folding in on themselves can create Errors, with a capital E for emphasis. Or Emphasis, if you will. We don&#39;t want to cut the power on a Suvian experiment gone horribly wrong only to have the entire facility transported into a foreign universe, or something of that sort.<br><br>The Reality Room idea could work as well, since we might need to test equally unrealistic possibilities on the specimen, but we&#39;d need two more rooms built around it, one to contain the ьber-realism of the Reality Room and one to allow the less-realistic entities to acclimate into the Reality Test Zone without being diminished or destroyed by the shift.

            <p>Yes, that <i>could</i> be a problem. People are going to notice a few trillion dollars worth of material going missing. That&#39;s what happens when I recommend courses of action from outside continua I&#39;m familiar with, I suppose. The processing power bit shouldn&#39;t be that huge an issue, since there are any number of quantum computers we could get out of science-fiction continua.

We don&#39;t want it interacting with anything that would cause it to rapidly expand its mass, or, well, let&#39;s just say we <i>would</i> end up needing Lord Vyce&#39;s help.</p>

            <p>They tend to have a habit of calling them in at the most dire of situations, or possibly when they want something done that&#39;s eventually going to end up with a species destroyed or themselves in charge of a group of other powerful entities.

Pre-set conditions are much more unlikely to blow up in one&#39;s face.<br>Deal idea: If we ensure the propagation of AIs similar to itself, it will be capable of spreading outside its initial simulation while still being able to have Singularity prime in its home world unaffected. Of course, we&#39;d need a place to put the duplicate AIs so that they don&#39;t absorb each other and go nuts, and I&#39;m not sure where we could do that.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m aware Neshomeh has already said <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=245575;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a>, so I&#39;ll try not to repeat anything. I also, obviously, won&#39;t say anything about Permission - I think Nesh&#39;s post constitutes a reply to that question.<br><br>Okay, starting with the agents... I&#39;m rather concerned that you went from &#39;I&#39;m not sure what Jean&#39;s going to be like&#39; to posting a bio in 12 minutes. That doesn&#39;t seem to be long enough to put together a full character - and, in fact, the really tiny bio seems to support that idea. A few specific points:<br><br>-You asked &#39;is this a good contrast with Valon?&#39;, which is a decent question - but shouldn&#39;t be the core of your character design. A character needs to stand by itself, not solely as part of a pair.<br>-Um... since Jean in English is a female name, but in French is a male one (and shows up a lot in English usage that way)... is your character male or female? This actually doesn&#39;t matter, but it&#39;s one of the first things most people decide on making a character. The fact that you didn&#39;t mention it suggests you were rushing (or that you have a <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/Playscript1.htm">deliberately genderless character</a>, but I doubt it).<br>-You just... haven&#39;t said very much. We can tell that Jean is probably fairly headstrong - but does &#39;hotheaded&#39; and &#39;inquisitive&#39; come out as &#39;impulsive&#39;, or do &#39;serious&#39; and &#39;dedicated&#39; make &#39;painstaking&#39;? Both are reasonable conclusions. There are heaps of other unanswered questions, too.<br><br>Moving onto Valon, then... I have only one real question:<br>-What sort of colourblind is he? Because there&#39;s a lot of difference. &#39;New Lodgings&#39; suggests he might be at least red-green, since he apparently missed the Big Red Button that turns off the console (and if you didn&#39;t do that deliberately, you should have!). On the other hand, as someone who actually is r-g colourblind, I suspect that would make him incapable of seeing urple (since r-g means I can&#39;t see a difference between purple and blue - or pink, depending on the purple). If he&#39;s fully colourblind, all these apply even more - I know someone who is, and yes, everything is literally shades of grey. There&#39;s also blue-yellow, which is rare, and I don&#39;t know much about it.<br><br>If you&#39;re putting something into a character, you need to know how it works - how it will affect them. Every time I write a story with Dafydd, I have to remind myself that he only has one hand now. If you have a fully-colourblind Valon, but have him marvelling at the vivid greenness of the trees... well. (An example: we have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Semi-double_Camelia_cultivar.jpg">camellia</a> bush. Every spring, my family insist they can see those flowers from the far end of the garden. They&#39;re clearly lying - I have to be within five meters to notice them...)<br><br>Moving onto the story... Nesh is right that there&#39;s something faintly off about Valon&#39;s lines. Partly, that&#39;s also a storytelling issue: his monologue actually repeats something the narration has already told us. It may be a perfectly natural reaction for him, but consider this.<br><br><i>The horse slid slowly backwards into the crevasse as my partner approached.<br><br>I shook my head. &quot;That&#39;s not something you see often - a horse falling into a pit.&quot;<br><br>Mortic arrived at my side. &quot;Okay, what&#39;d I miss?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, a horse just fell into a hole in the ground,&quot; I filled him in.<br><br>Mortic&#39;s brow furrowed. &quot;A horse? Into a chasm?&quot;</i><br><br>Yes, they might well say those if they were real people - but by this point the audience are screaming &quot;GET ON WITH IT!&quot;. In your specific case, I&#39;d probably have cut out the recap altogether:<br><br><i>... he looked around the Response Centre.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; he decided, &quot;Lovecraft nods his silent approval. I guess this place got imported from Innsmouth or something.&quot;</i><br><br>And another point on continuity (to go with the colourblindness): are you keeping all that stuff? Are you going to use it? What I mean is, are your agents going to hang things on the skeleton, perch on the table, complain that the sofa&#39;s rotting and throw darts at Cthulhu - or are they going to exist in a vague, generic space with a console, a cupboard, and maybe a chair or two?<br><br>If you actually use it, I think the Response Centre Of Terror could be a brilliant way to liven up the intros and extros of your missions. If you don&#39;t, it&#39;ll be a somewhat jarring waste.<br><br>A few more points:<br><br>-Most people on the Internet paragraph by leaving an empty line. <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/PuritanEssay.htm">It&#39;s a lot easier to read</a>. You have got indenting going on (which is incredibly rare online - probably because most places don&#39;t support tabbing in!), which is the usual approach in print - but I think I still prefer blank lines for the screen. That may be just preference, though.<br>-Marking comments as resolved doesn&#39;t get rid of them. ;) The best way to publish things through GDrive is to, well, publish them. You&#39;ll find it at File&gt;Publish to the web, and it strips out a lot of the user interface to leave a nice clean page <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1MsELxdIpH6h0VXpLHZrJb0bj5bRAD-F7DffOSa1pTyQ">like this</a>.<br>-Some of your description is a bit confusing. I&#39;m looking at Valon dragging his bags into &#39;what could charitably be called a broom closet&#39;. Is that supposed to mean the RC is tiny, in which case you&#39;ve got a lot of stuff in there? Is there an actual broom closet, clearly marked so he could find it, but too dirty or something to be a proper broom closet? Is there a bedroom or something which is very small, and also very easy to find? I can&#39;t tell.<br>-... I&#39;ll leave a newline for this one...<br><br>--&gt; ALL THAT BEING SAID... I actually quite liked your intro piece. I&#39;m nitpicking because I&#39;m currently wearing my Permission Giver Hat, but I think Valon has potential to be pretty funny, given the chance. And I do like the RC Of Terror.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t speak for &#39;most PGs&#39;, but I never set digital foot in the IRC.

            <p>In theory, yes, but this is a really bare-bones style of description, and I haven&#39;t gotten to see her in action yet.<br><br>I think you should take some time—at least a week, more to be safe—and work on your characters some more, write a bit of backstory or something for Jean to give us an idea of who she really is in practice. Then come back and put together a solid Permission request, with all the pieces fully prepared and put together in one post that you&#39;ve checked over thoroughly before you hit &quot;Post Reply.&quot; The ability to think things through and put your ducks in a row ahead of time is important for mission-writing.<br><br>On the plus side, I will say that Valon looks to be in pretty good shape, though I&#39;m relieved that you weren&#39;t planning to write a whole mission of him talking to himself. It&#39;s really hard to carry that off in a way that sounds natural, and it doesn&#39;t quite work in the writing sample. However, his interactions with Maggie are fine, so I&#39;m not too worried about it as long as he has someone to bounce dialogue off of.<br><br>I also think your writing is pretty solid in general, and has good humor, though you belabored the description of the response center a bit. I personally didn&#39;t need to be told it was &quot;like a haunted house&quot; <i>and</i> &quot;the ultimate in cheesy horror.&quot; The two lines are fairly redundant, and you&#39;d already shown me those qualities in the preceding paragraph. Also, watch out for picky things like when to capitalize (usually not for generic terms like &quot;response center&quot;), when to italicize (almost always for titles of long works like <i>Psycho</i> and <i>Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</i> [but not Bionicle]), and when to use semicolons (to relate independent clauses to one another, not to introduce material; that&#39;s what a colon is for).<br><br>If you&#39;re confused or have questions about anything, please ask.

            <p>So, I was just living life, languidly nibbling on some shrip... when it hit me. The Plot-hole of Doom, followed by a long string of what-ifs. It may not be the most clever of conspiracy theories, but it must be shared.<br><br>In The Hunger Games, Katniss iconically discovers Peeta slowly dying in a creekbed, meticulously camouflaged, where he claims that Cato attacked him after he betrayed the Careers to save Katniss from the tracker jackers.<br>BUT. Who drags themselves five miles or more to a river, while perishing of bloodloss, then wanders around in the woods for at least six hours gathering paint supplies, then mixes the paint, and then decorates themselves in such detail? There is 0% chance of staying lucid that long with such grievous injuries. And while he supposedly allied with the Careers only for the purpose of steering them away from Katniss, and protecting her, he consistently led them straight to her campsites. Not to mention that it had been days, maybe a week, between the tracker jackers and when Peeta logically would have obtained the wound.<br>The only possible explanation for the river incident is that he painted himself, cut his hand to leave the prints beside the river, and then asked Cato to slash him- or slashed himself. Meaning that he was a Career all along, and had set up a trap to lure Katniss in so his posse could pounce on her while she tended Peeta&#39;s wounds. Then the Careers would heal him, or more likely promise to and then leave him to die.<br>The Careers would either kill Katniss straightaways, or Katniss would figure out Peeta&#39;s treachery and escape. Either way she would not be Peeta&#39;s ally, Peeta would die, and she would have no motive to attend the feast. Clove would not pin her, and thus not mention Rue&#39;s fate. Thresh would have no reason to divert his attention from Cato, and Clove would live. Cato would still defeat Thresh, leaving Foxface, *possibly* Katniss, and District Two in the Games.<br>I could explain the victory of any of them, but regardless of the winner, Katniss and Peeta would not have threatened double suicide, and so there would be no rebellion in Panem.<br><br>And that is why authors should reread before they submit their manuscripts.<br><br>-- Len</p>

            <p>Interesting theory you have there. If you would allow me a few thoughts?<br><br><i>Who drags themselves five miles or more to a river, while perishing of bloodloss, then wanders around in the woods for at least six hours gathering paint supplies, then mixes the paint, and then decorates themselves in such detail? There is 0% chance of staying lucid that long with such grievous injuries.</i><br><br><i>Not to mention that it had been days, maybe a week, between the tracker jackers and when Peeta logically would have obtained the wound.</i> [til she finds him]<br><br>To me it seems logical he would try to get to water if he were, and he was, in such bad shape. You&#39;ll die sooner without water than you will food, and any food you might be looking to catch has to come get a drink sometime too. So it&#39;s a good place to be. I&#39;d like to know where you come up with that it was 5+ miles to the stream, was it a guesstimate? Was it shown that it seemed to be that far in the movie, because I&#39;ve not seen that?. In the book it doesn&#39;t say, and from Katniss&#39; point of view after her stings work through her system, it wasn&#39;t that far til she found the stream which she would later follow back toward the Career&#39;s camp and wind up finding Peeta, so I don&#39;t think it was as far as all that, maybe a mile, two - two and a half tops.<br><br>What we do know is he was cut immediately, and that it was Cato who did it, and that he meant to kill, because at the victor&#39;s wrap up Katniss sees how he fought Cato to ensure her escape from the scene. And Cato was boasting about it at the lake when Katniss goes to blow up the supplies. So he was cut the day of the attack, and here, I agree with you on the oddity of his surviving between the Tracker Jacker attack and the blood loss because it does take Katniss nearly a full week to find him. (She was out 2 nights with the stinger venom, she spent the one night with Rue, she spent a night by the camp after blowing the supplies and then she spent two nights mourning Rue, the night of her death and the next night, which was also when the rule change announcement was made. So she located Peeta on the stream mid-morning or so of the 7th day.) He should have died of dehydration before then. Unless you postulate that he was not in the dire straights she found him in until a few days later. Cato&#39;s &quot;sure cut&quot; failed to kill the tribute from District 8 on the first night, and with added difficulty of attacking while under the influence of the Tracker Jacker&#39;s venom, he once again seems to have missed anything vital. It states the wound goes down to the bone, but unless you hit an artery, that&#39;s survivable. It&#39;s the infection and how weak he is that is killing him when Katniss finds him, not the wound itself. So if he held out a few days, and he would have had to simply because as you state he would not have been lucid enough to manage it for at least a day and a half after the Tracker Jackers during which time the Careers wouldn&#39;t have been able to track him either, but if he held out for a couple days beyond that before having to bury himself, he would be in okay shape water wise by the stream. Also, Katniss&#39; flight under the effects of the venom seems to indicate that he could have covered the distance to the stream, wounded as he was on some kind of adrenaline high, and he too was running for his life, so it wouldn&#39;t have been as hard to make it to cover the distance to the stream as it might have been, had he simply been wounded, without the venom, and without the fleeing for his life.<br><br>I don&#39;t think it would have taken that long to gather camouflage supplies by the river either, he used the mud and vegetation that was already there to do the trick. No mixing, no real &quot;gathering&quot;. Plus if as we&#39;ve presumed above, if he made it a few days before having to hunker down and accept dying in the mud, he would have had time to gather anything he would have needed to. Still, I doubt he would have needed to spend that much time gathering things even if he had to do so immediately. Once again I&#39;m wondering if it was implied he spent time gathering supplies in the movie? Because I don&#39;t see that mentioned in the book, in fact it doesn&#39;t seem to mention anything at all about Peeta from the time of the Tracker Jackers, to when Katniss finds him, she tells about herself, and he talks about when he first started having a crush on her, but she never asks what went on between the attack and fight with Cato and her finding him on the stream bank. So we really can&#39;t know how long he was up before he had to bury himself and hide. <br><br><i>And while he supposedly allied with the Careers only for the purpose of steering them away from Katniss, and protecting her, he consistently led them straight to her campsites.</i><br><br>Again, are you inferring that he led them to her from the movie? Or just because he happened to be with them and they ran across her a couple times? Both times we see them run across her in the book are perfectly natural, Not because Peeta, or even the Career&#39;s, were specifically tracking her, though from the sound of it, they were, and Peeta would have just been along to protect her should the need arise.<br><br>The first night they followed the beacon of the campfire the girl tribute from District 8 lit to keep warm. (the one Cato failed to kill with his &quot;sure cut&quot;) Neither the Careers nor Peeta even knew Katniss was near by. The second and last time they find her while Peeta is with them was the fourth night out, and was because that day&#39;s fire, the one sent by the Gamemakers, had driven them all together, and Katniss, fleeing for her life as she was and with her injuries, wasn&#39;t as careful about not leaving a trail as she would have been otherwise. Then she also proceeded to sit out in the open by the pond for quite a while.<br><br><i>The only possible explanation for the river incident is that he painted himself, cut his hand to leave the prints beside the river, and then asked Cato to slash him- or slashed himself. Meaning that he was a Career all along, and had set up a trap to lure Katniss in so his posse could pounce on her while she tended Peeta&#39;s wounds.</i><br><br>As touched on above, we know Peeta was cut the day of the Tracker Jacker attack by Cato because he was helping Katniss escape. We also know that if he were a Career, he would have simply killed her himself when he found she had come back to the Tracker Jacker scene to retrieve the bow and arrows from Glimmer&#39;s body, instead he told her to run. Then as we hear during the victor&#39;s wrap up in the Capital, he actually fought Cato to ensure her escape.<br><br>That it was a trap to lure Katniss in would not have been a good strategy for Peeta or the Careers to consider either, since they would have no guarantee she would come find him until after the rule change on the sixth night after the attack. And by that time Peeta was too weak, and his leg far to infected to have put the strategy together and enacted it the night before. Plus we already know when and why the wound was inflicted, and that Peeta was misleading the Careers and actually fighting Cato off to help Katniss.<br><br>I agree with you, with the time line given, he probably should have died of dehydration before she found him, or from infection. But I don&#39;t think the plot-hole is nearly as big as you followed your &quot;what-ifs&quot; into. :)</p>

And I&#39;d never questioned Peeta&#39;s loyalty, because Suzanne stated over and over about him being the one in love, before either, so kudos for considering what if&#39;s enough to question what she tries to write as a given. :)</p>

            <p>Like when Katniss repeatedly refers to herself as Ze Ultimate Survivah and reminisces about the time where she lived two months off of mint tea, and then spends an entire day pacing and chowing down on stir fry in the Capitol before exclaiming how ravenous she is at dinner time and gorging herself at the multi-course feast.

            <p>Questioning is good, a good author/story can stand up to it. :D<br><br>I don&#39;t remember Katniss referring to her self as such, mostly I remember she seems to pretty much figure she may be dead, but at least she&#39;ll go out fighting. And having just re-read that part, I know she was impressed with Rue&#39;s knowledge of grains/berries/night vision glasses and with Foxface&#39;s cleverness and that she is an opponent to be reckoned with, and the boy from District 3 for that matter, the one that re-activated and placed the bombs around the supplies she destroys. And she admits Thresh would know what grains were out in the plain where he hides the whole games. I could be wrong though. <br><br>Same goes for the frequency she gorges herself and then complains of being hungry. Though I would like to point out that stress (and probably the training they were undergoing) would be a huge calorie burner. She is a very active nervous type as you pointed out about the pacing, and I remember her pacing several times when confined. Or thinking she&#39;s the fittest tribute. I&#39;ll have to re-read the book again before I can say one way or the other, unless you have specific passages you&#39;re thinking about? The answers to your previous line of questioning I more or less knew exactly where to find. These however will probably be more spread out. I don&#39;t remember the mint tea for two months either, though I can make the guess it&#39;s probably one of the times she&#39;s thinking about the time just after her father died.</p>

            <p>Actually that&#39;s perfect, narrows it down a lot. <sup>^</sup> <br><br>I would call shenanigans on surviving on mint tea for two months for sure though. Except I found the passage and it was only for three days. <br><br>She was remembering after her father died, and she was trying to sell some old clothes for money, it was when she was describing the bread incident. <i>&quot;Although I had been to the Hob on several occasions with my father, I was too frightened to venture into that rough, gritty place alone. The rain had soaked through my father&#39;s hunting jacket, leaving me chilled to the bone. For three days, we&#39;d had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves I&#39;d found in the back of the cupboard.&quot;</i><br><br>Alright, found the other two passages too. <br><br><i>...spends an entire day pacing and chowing down on stir fry in the Capitol before exclaiming how ravenous she is at dinner time and gorging herself at the multi-course feast.</i> <br><br>It&#39;s actually goose liver and &#39;puffy bread&#39; if it&#39;s right before dinner the first night. And it&#39;s sorta kinda implied she didn&#39;t have lunch (it describes what is served at lunch, but then Cinna and her get to talking about philosophical things and her costume, and it never actually says they eat.) But I&#39;ll give it that it&#39;s just not described. Still it simply says she eats the goose liver and bread &quot;Until there is a knock at her door. Effie calling her for dinner.&quot; but we have no idea how long this is. It&#39;s after the parade, and she showers and dresses, so it&#39;s probably not to super terribly long. And again, the nervous pacing, so it might be a little stretch that she&#39;s &quot;starving&quot; but she is probably a bit hungry still after the day she&#39;s had.<br><br><i>And *then* remarks on how she&#39;s the fittest Tribute in the training facility after a week or so of this behavior. I mean, I would understand being hungry and stuffing yourself after getting by on such mean sustenance all your life, but that&#39;s really pushing reality.</i><br>Actually, again, if I found the right passage, and it&#39;s her first walking into the training center, she&#39;s only been eating this food for two days at most. It states the train ride to the Capital takes less than a day, so she has supper and breakfast on the train, lunch (maybe?) with the stylists, snack in her room, dinner after the ceremony, and breakfast again the next day.<br><br>She&#39;s also not saying she&#39;s the fittest of the group, only that she appears to get a bit more food regularly than the other non-Career districts, and healthy food from the forest. That combined with the exercise she gets obtaining that food leaves her healthier than a good deal of them to start with, not that she&#39;s the fittest of them currently. At least the way I read it.</p>

            <p>I was reading into it like that because I was frustrated with the quality of writing throughout the book, because I didn&#39;t bother to check the source material, and because I&#39;m shamefully prone to dramatic exaggerations when I retell stories. :P<br><br>I&#39;m the only one at fault here, don&#39;t fret.</p>

And then someone tells me otherwise, I run for the book/movie and then have to put the book/movie away and try to pretend I hadn&#39;t actually said anything. Oh look is that a squirrel, gosh those curtains are lovely, said something about proving a point? Oh no, that wasn&#39;t me, you must be mistaken, I just wanted to look out the window through the lovely curtains at the wildlife. XD</p>

            <p>Well, let&#39;s break this down one medium at a time.  But first, let&#39;s talk about some of the flaws in logic that affect both.<br><br>1) &quot;Who drags themselves five miles or more to a river...&quot;  I&#39;d really like to know your source on that.  I&#39;ve been scouring the book trying to find any actual distances, but I haven&#39;t found any.  I do know that Katniss makes the trip from the stream to the Cornucopia, by an indirect path, in the dark, while trying to be quiet, starting in the middle of the night, and still makes it there before dawn.  So, I am guessing that it is well less than 5 miles.<br><br>2)  &quot;...he consistently led them straight to her campsites...&quot;  The implication here is that he either knew where Katniss was already, or that the baker&#39;s son somehow secretly had the skills necessary to track someone who spent her entire life hunting in the woods.  I don&#39;t buy either explanation, and I haven&#39;t seen anything to suggest that Peeta was doing anything but looking out for Katniss when he joined the Careers.  In fact, he ran back to her to get her out of there after the Tracker Jackers attack.  If he wanted her dead, why didn&#39;t he just keep her there (which would have been really easy at that point) until the Careers came back.<br><br>3) &quot;Meaning that he was a Career all along, and had set up a trap to lure Katniss in so his posse could pounce on her...&quot;  There was a distinct lack of pouncing going on.  If it was a trap, where was the trap?  They knew he wasn&#39;t dead yet, there would have been a canon shot.  So, if they meant to just leave him there to die (which is really out of character for the Careers), then why wouldn&#39;t they just come back and check to make sure he wasn&#39;t in a nearby cave being nursed back to health over the course of a few days?  Worst trap/double cross ever.<br><br>4) Peeta&#39;s problem in both the book and the movie wasn&#39;t loss of blood.  It was, instead, blood poisoning.  He was slowly dying of his blood turning toxic.  The inflammation from the infection could easily have stanched the flow of blood from the leg, not to mention the fact the he is smart enough to do that himself. <br><br>All that out of the way, let&#39;s talk about the book and movie.  This mainly deals with the camouflage.<br><br>Peeta is described in the book as being camouflaged by &quot;brown mud and green leaves&quot; which would be readily available on the bank of the stream.  That means there wouldn&#39;t be any running around the woods for hours looking for paint supplies.<br><br>In the movie, the wound is far less terrible, and he was clearly painted to resemble the boulder he was lying against.  In this case, because of the less severe wound, he may have had the time to mix up, using readily available materials, something gray to color his face with.  The rest of him was covered in mud, like in the book.<br><br>Long story short, the material I have found doesn&#39;t support your theory.  I don&#39;t see any reason to believe that he was ever a bad guy or a turn-coat.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Well, the whole setup of Peeta&#39;s camouflage seems a little ridiculous, as Everything Wrong With The Hunger Games in X Minutes put it, district 12, an area so poor they eat squirrels, has a bakery with frosted cakes? And, in hindsight, I guess that wandering around for a few hours looking for the right kind of colours, while stabbed/cut open/both, is just beyond the realm of Willing Suspension of Disbelief.</p>

            <p>Welcome, welcome! From what I&#39;m reading, it seems that you&#39;re fitting in just fine with the insanity that is the PPC. Hmmm...a Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy fan, eh?

            <p>Category 1) Stuff that I&#39;m involved in / know well enough to mission<br><br>I&#39;m not really involved in any fandoms at the minute, although special mention goes to, <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> and <i>H.I.V.E.</i> (The Higher Institute of Villainous Education - basically Hogwarts for future Evil Geniuses, Mad Scientists, etc.), both of which I&#39;m sketching out fanfic plots for. <br><br>As for the fandoms that I feel confident enough to mission: <i>Abhorsenverse</i>, <i>Harry Potter</i>, <i>Dresden Files</i>, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> (re-imagined series only), <i>Firefly</i>, <i>James Bond</i>, <i>Trigun</i> (anime only), <i>Hellsing</i> (anime and manga) and <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>.<br><br>Category 1.5) Stuff that I&#39;d like to do missions for, but am not sure if ever will, for whatever reason<br><br><i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>The Wheel of Time</i> both belong in this category, for the same reason - while I enjoy them immensely, there&#39;s just so much to know about the canon! I&#39;m not confident that I&#39;d actually be able to do it justice, which is a shame, as I would definitely like to do my bit protecting those continua. <i>Lord of the Rings</i> in particular I&#39;d like to do at least one mission for in my spin off, simply because that&#39;s where the PPC started, although the only way that&#39;ll be happening any time soon is via a co-write. <br><br>I also read a lot of hard/military sci-fi, stuff like <i>Honor Harrington</i>, <i>Stark&#39;s War</i>, <i>JAG in Space</i>, <i>The Lost Fleet</i>, <i>Star Risk</i>, as well as old school stuff like <i>The Forever War</i>, <i>Cities in Flight</i> and <i>Starship Troopers</i>. For these, finding missionable badfic (or even fanfic in general) seems to range between being merely difficult to outright impossible. <br><br>Category 2) The more casual stuff<br><br><i>Redwall</i>, <i>Narnia</i>, <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, the <i>Clancyverse</i>, <i>Star Wars</i> (mostly just the films, although I did read a lot of the books a long time ago, and am currently playing The Old Republic), a heck of a lot of anime, and really pretty much anything in the genres of Fantasy or Science Fiction, whether they be books, TV or film :)<br><br>Special mentions here go to <i>The Edge Chronicles</i> (which I&#39;ve recently rediscovered), and the <i>Thursday Next</i> books, which I&#39;ve only just started reading, but am thoroughly enjoying. </p>

<li>Hardcore Fandoms<br>-<i>Lost</i>  The big one for me.  I was a major <i>Lost</i> fanboy while it ran and still find the whole story, with all the characters&#39; interactions, amazing.  <i>Lost</i> missions are going to play a major role in my spin-off.<br><br>-<i>The Dark Tower</i> series by Stephen King.  Another major of fanboy excitement for me.  Won&#39;t spork any until I&#39;ve read the final novel.<br><br>-<i>Kingdom Hearts</i><br><br>-maybe <i>Heroes</i>?  I know it well enough, but the downturn the writing took led to contradictions and confusions.<br><br>-Sherlock Holmes, because after over a century, Doyle&#39;s writing is just damn brilliant.<br><br>-Any novel I read and enjoy.  Even though many aren&#39;t well-known enough for fanfiction to be a thing.<br><br>2. More casual stuff, eh?  Uh . . .<br>-some <i>Final Fantasy</i> stuff.  The games are too complex for me to typically go for 100% completion, but I pick up the general stuff.  <i>VIII</i>, <i>X</i> and the <i>Dissidia</i> series are the ones I know best.<br><br>-Narnia and Harry Potter.  I don&#39;t know them as well as some folks, but they&#39;re enjoyable worlds and I like spending time in them.<br><br>-Pokemon, but only some of the games.  (The anime does not exist, the anime does not exist, the anime does not exist . . .)<br><br>- I semi-want to start <i>Doctor Who</i>, but apparently some older episodes have gone missing.  Because I&#39;m a glutton, I don&#39;t really want to start if I can&#39;t watch them all in chronological order.</li>

            <p>1) I&#39;m a hardcore fan of Doctor Who, as in I know how many times a timelord regenerates and how they reproduce.

            <p>As far as hardcore fandoms go: Lucky Star, Spice and Wolf, Angel Beats, Initial D, and Mirror&#39;s Edge. Lesser ones would be Mirai Nikki, and... I think that&#39;s about it actually.

            <p>TNG is my favorite Star Trek, too. You know, I never wrote it down, but TOS was my first fanfic. I didn&#39;t sleep very much when I was a little kid, but my parents had a rule that I had to stay in bed and be quiet. I used to entertain myself making up stories that were basically terrible fanfic.  <br><br>I haven&#39;t watched a lot of TNG and I don&#39;t know it well enough to be able to talk about episodes by name, but if I see a couple of minutes of the episode, I remember it, and if I am reminded about something specific I remember having seen it.  Like in Skyrim there is a woman named Temba Wide-Arms. I didn&#39;t catch the reference until someone pointed it out, but once they did, I can see and hear clips of that episode.<br><br>I think I am in about the same stage with Dr. Who. I have seen 9 and everything they have on Netflix of Classic Who, plus a few on disc. (Seriously, who at Netflix thought it was a good idea to not include parts 3 and 6 of the Key to Time story arc?)</p>

            <p>You meet a lot more TOS fans, since a lot of people are just getting into it through the reboot. But TNG is the best. <br><br>I did the same thing - I didn&#39;t fall asleep quickly, so I&#39;d make up stories. I started with Oz, though. Poor Princess Ozma. Boy, did I use her as my self insert. But when I started writing fic, it was TOS/TNG crossover involving both casts attending the same high school as me and my friends. It was as bad as it sounds.<br><br>Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra! That was a good episode. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve found is one of the best things about TNG - consistent episode quality. TOS can get very campy and silly, but Patrick Stewart can sell anything. I also love how every character is fully developed, with near-complete backstories and character arcs. I&#39;m particularly fond of Data. I will never get tired of watching him explore humanity.<br><br>As to Doctor Who...heh, I&#39;m not even that far. I have seen a bit of Classic Who (1 and 2 mostly) and I know some about New Who because I have friends who are into it. I really need to get more into it. So many fandoms...</p>

            <p>I do love campy/cheesy sci-fi. The thing that always struck me the most about TOS is how LOUD their bridge is! <br><br>Classic Who can be really cheesy, too. I love Tom Baker&#39;s Who (4). One of the stories (Ark in Space) the monsters are <i>literally</i> bubble wrap that is painted green. For real. It&#39;s a really good set of episodes though.</p>

            <p>:P<br><br>My fandoms, lemme see...<br><br>Core fandoms:<br><br>- <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. My oldest fandom, via The Hobbit at the age of eight. Books <i>and</i> films are both beloved versions, including The Hobbit trilogy so far.<br>- <i>Harry Potter</i>. Surprisingly didn&#39;t get into it till it had been out a couple of years. <i>Much</i> prefer the books over the films; the first two films were good, but the next three were disappointments of increasing scale, and I haven&#39;t even seen the last three.<br>- David Eddings&#39; <i>Belgariad/Malloreon</i> and <i>Elenium/Tamuli</i> series, and his standalone <i>The Redemption of Althalus</i>. My auntie gave me <i>The Belgariad</i> when I was in my teens, knowing my love of the genre, and I got addicted to the snarky twist on high fantasy.<br>- Brian Jacques&#39; <i>Redwall</i> series. I&#39;ve loved them since pre-adolescence, and while they&#39;re somewhat formulaic, they appeal to my fondness for clear-cut heroes and villains. (And the descriptions of feasts. Man, did Brian Jacques ever know how to describe a vegetarian feast deliciously.)<br>- Terry Pratchett&#39;s <i>Discworld</i> series. I liked a few of the books back in pre-adolescence, but I really became a fanatic about five years ago. Also the unrelated collaboration he did with Neil Gaiman, <i>Good Omens</i>.<br>- The <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> series. Admittedly I first got into them because of my crush on Orlando Bloom, but I found Captain Jack Sparrow far too awesome to forget.<br><br>Newer fandoms (from the beginning of 2013):<br><br>- <i>Labyrinth</i>, the Jim Henson film. It&#39;s so Eighties! And there are songs that stick in your head! And David Bowie&#39;s skintight pants... which shouldn&#39;t be shown to anyone under eighteen, probably. They sort of traumatised my little sister. XD<br>- Joss Whedon&#39;s <i>Firefly</i> series, and the Big Damn Movie that followed, <i>Serenity</i>. Lycaenion and Rilwen Shadowflame talked me into finally seeing why they were so obsessed with it. The combination of Western and space genres had been putting me off, but now I find it awesome. Cowboys in space just trying to make a living and winding up doing really cool stuff like battling feral maniacs, shootouts with the criminal underworld, duels with noble idiots... yeah, I&#39;m kinda in love. :P</p>

            <p>Top Four (in no particular order): <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>Harry Potter</i>, <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i>, and <i>Farscape</i>. These are the ones I&#39;ve been in sustained love with the longest and for which I&#39;ve been most heavily involved in fandom activities, particularly the last three. I&#39;ve always been prohibitively afraid I could never do LotR justice with serious fic or art, though I did have a short-lived RP career with a female Ranger character on Neopets, and in the last few years I&#39;ve finally managed a couple of missions there.<br><br>I have a fair-sized list of fandoms I&#39;m confident and enthusiastic enough to mission in (with perhaps some research to refresh my memory). These include <i>Animorphs</i>, <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, <i>Discworld</i>, <i>Firefly</i>/<i>Serenity</i>, <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>, <i>House, M.D.</i>, <i>How to Train Your Dragon</i>, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> (book and musical), <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> (Leroux, Kay, and Webber), <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> (if it weren&#39;t quarantined), <i>Spyro the Dragon</i> (early PS1 games only), <i>Star Trek</i> (esp. DS9), and <i>Young Wizards</i>.<br><br>More casual fandoms than that... are probably too many to list. My favorite new find is <i>Justice League</i>/<i>Justice League Unlimited</i>, though. It&#39;s well-written and intelligent while still working in some goofy superhero stuff, there&#39;s an excellent balance of drama to action to humor, and I was very sad to come to the end of it. I enjoyed <i>The Hunger Games</i> trilogy for the most part (the last book left much to be desired, IMO) and look forward to the next two films. I&#39;m also eagerly waiting for the new season of <i>Psych</i> to make it to Netflix, and I&#39;ve been on a happy trip down Nostalgia Lane with <i>X-Files</i>. I&#39;m also fond of <i>Battlestar Gallactica</i> (2003) and <i>Babylon 5</i>.<br><br>... I like lots of stuff. That&#39;s why I put my first agent pair in the DIC. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I suppose this is as good a time as any to come out as an enthusiastic reader of <i>Homestuck</i>. I managed to get caught up a couple of months or so before the hiatus, which left me slightly hollow inside for the duration. So glad it&#39;s back. I wasn&#39;t sure at first, but by now I&#39;m convinced that Andrew Hussie is a mad genius and confident that he has a plan for the endgame and won&#39;t disappoint.<br><br>To people like me who may have avoided it out of confusion at what its deal is and possibly dismay at all the weird troll stuff that has cropped up all over the Internet: It&#39;s not all about the trolls. It is so much more than that. I would sum it up as a story about a group of kids who sit down to play a game together and find out they&#39;re actually playing to save the world, and then find out they&#39;re <i>not</i> actually playing to save the world, but to ensure the propagation of reality itself—and then things get complicated. You do have to wade through some nonsense in the beginnning, because much of the format is a play on text-based RPGs like <i>King&#39;s Quest</i> and originally involved actual reader input, but IMO it&#39;s totally worth the wait for the plot to get going. There&#39;s a lot of really clever stuff to sink your mental teeth into if you&#39;re paying attention, and it&#39;s a lot of fun trying to pick up on what&#39;s important and what&#39;s just a gag and what&#39;s both.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Lord of the Rings, though an undying passion of mine, is not something I would probably feel comfortable doing an Action mission in. I think I&#39;d be fine running a Cafeteria mission, but those tend to take slightly less intricate knowledge and ability to critique canon details.<br><br>Solid hardcore fandoms?<br>-The Dresden Files<br>-Codex Alera<br>-The Chronicles of Narnia (lit)<br>-The Vorkosigan Saga<br>-Tortall &amp; Emelan<br>-Harry Potter<br>-A Song of Ice and Fire<br><br>I suppose it&#39;s rank heresy, but I&#39;d say I&#39;m a lukewarm fan of Doctor Who at this point. I haven&#39;t watched in months, and don&#39;t know much besides Nine, Ten, and the first two or three seasons of Eleven. I&#39;ve also become a lukewarm fan of Supernatural. I watch the show for Crowley Snark, and spend at least part of my time complaining about the white heteronormativity and protagonist-driven morality. But for all that, I think I&#39;ve passed the Enthusiastic Posting Threshold and am officially in the fandom. Other lukewarm fandoms... h&#39;m. My Little Pony - I watch it every now and then, and it&#39;s alright. Once Upon A Time, which I once again mainly watch for the snarking of its ambiguous villain character(s), and spend most of the time complaining about the idiocy of the &quot;good guys.&quot;<br><br>In short, I&#39;m a die-hard literature fan, and still diving into any fandom the library has to offer, but have also been dipping into various television fandoms with some enjoyment. Got any recommendations? British (or Scottish) snarky characters with moral ambiguity are basically my television fandom sticking points.</p>

            <p>Do you want this mini-Boarder of yourself, Pauline07? I have so many minis in my metapartment right now, and I don&#39;t want them getting into territorial disputes. It was hard enough getting the mini-Agents to stop harassing weinterwood, and that was only through the help of a mini of Christianne Shieh defending her mini-author. It was sweet, really, but I&#39;m not sure who&#39;d stick up for a new mini that none of them know.</p>

            <p>Sure. Maybe Paulin should go over there sometimes, though, to play. Do minis have such a thing as friendship? The wiki article really wasn&#39;t clear on that.<br><br>Or maybe I just didn&#39;t notice because someone&#39;s pounding my head with a chisel. In either case....wait, mini-Agents?

            <p>All the better for jumping down off of high places and landing on your shoulders. Though that&#39;s mostly Acacia Bird, but I&#39;m counting it anyway, because those talons <i>hurt</i>.<br><br>The mini-Agents themselves can always be edited out of missions, yes, but mini-Agents created by misspellings in Board posts are permanent, and I took it upon myself a while ago to collect as many as I can, mostly to keep them out of trouble. The only exception to this is Acacia Bird, who was created in one of Trojanhorse&#39;s missions, and since Trojanhorse has long since retired, she&#39;s more or less permanent as well.<br><br>Well, if not friendship, the minis can at least form alliances and default to socializing with those within their alliance, which I suppose is part of what friendship is all about. I know that much because Cadamr and Accadia seem to spend most of their time together, playing, planning, attacking things, and the like, and A. Gallwoglass seems to get along very well with Gasaprd. I see them having tea sometimes. No clue where Gasaprd got that tiny tea kettle, but it&#39;s pretty adorable.<br><br>This&#39;d be as good a time as any for a sound-off in order of arrival, so I can see what my numbers have gotten up to.<br><br>Cadamr<br>Accadia<br>Acacia Bird<br>Gasaprd<br>Daffyd<br>A. Gallwoglass<br>Christiane<br>Xerica<br><br>I&#39;d found five more, Accacia, Floretan, Cadamar, Printwothy, and Kiril, but the first four were born in missions, and so were given back to their creators before the typo that spawned them was edited out of existence, and EllipsisFlood adopted Kiril long before I showed up on the Board at all.<br>Which is good, because thirteen mini-Agents would likely have been more than I have room for, especially since Daffyd has the nasty habit of trying to keep any other minis from sitting on the couch. It&#39;s not your couch, Daffyd! It&#39;s my couch, and I decide who&#39;s not worthy of sitting on it!</p>

            <p>Only a few minutes ago, I found a new Acacia mini, Arcadia, who could use a home, and she might be able to make a good roommate for Paulin07, considering how she&#39;s pretty new as well, relatively. Less relatively, she&#39;s been in the hallways of the Board for a few months now, but nobody has adopted her.<br><br>On another note, this is the fourth Acacia mini I&#39;ve found.

            <p>So, looking through the figures I&#39;m gathering for my monthly reports, I&#39;ve noticed some quite worrying statistics.<br><br>In 2012, we had 91 people make an introductory post on the Board. Of those, only 34 lasted two months - or rather, posted in the calender month two later than the one they joined in. That&#39;s only a 37% short-term retention rate.<br><br>But it gets worse: Only <i>17</i> of last year&#39;s newbies posted between March and May of this year. That&#39;s only half of those who survived two months - less than <i>20%</i> of our total intake.<br><br>You get similar rates when you look at people who announced their returns at some point last year: of 32 total &#39;returnbies&#39;, 15 hit two months (47%), and only six or so are still around now (19%).<br><br>So, to everyone, a handful of questions:<br><br>1/ Before you joined the PPC community, what did you think you were getting into? How did it match up to your expectations?<br><br>2/ If at any point you have drifted away, why? And what brought you back?<br><br>3/ Why do you think so many people don&#39;t stick around?<br><br>In related statistics, I also looked at the 29 Permission requests from last year. Of the 23 people involved, 8 were granted Permission to write PPC stories on their first attempt. Another 8 failed the first time through and never asked again. Five more went back, reworked their stuff, and were granted Permission on their second tries. Only two people tried a second time and were still turned down (and I&#39;ve looked them both over, and there were very good reasons both times). Permission is <i>not that hard to get</i> if you&#39;re willing to actually put in the effort to a) get to know us and b) craft decent characters. Those eight refusals include at least a couple of &#39;Hi I&#39;ve just joined can I have Permission?&#39;s.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Those statistics are quite interesting - I&#39;d certainly noticed a trend for people to post an introductory thread, only to post little (or nothing) after and just fade away, but I hadn&#39;t realised the retention rate was <i>that</i> low. <br><br>On to your specific questions:<br><br>1) Before joining, I thought I&#39;d found somewhere that would help me with my own writing, a group of people that were interested in writing themselves, and were also interested in improving. It seemed to be somewhere where I could get advice, maybe offer it too, and chat with people about stories and canons in general – I&#39;m pleased to say that it matched well with those expectations. <br><br>2) I have drifted away a bit - I was totally gone for a little while towards the end of last year, and I&#39;ve been lurking a lot more than I&#39;ve been posting these last few weeks. Both of those relate to stuff in real life. <br><br>Last year I was made redundant, and there was a point where looking for a new job had dragged on for so long that I pretty much stopped socialising altogether. Sadly, the PPC was the first place I left, and the last one I returned to - not a reflection on how much I like the PPC, but a comment on how much easier I found it to walk away from a purely online community, versus actually seeing people in real life.<br><br>Recently I&#39;ve managed to find a new job (which has had the unfortunate side effect of cutting down on my free time), and I started lurking while I adjusted to how tired actually having to wake up in the mornings again was leaving me. I’ve just about got back into the habit now, so I should be around a bit more. <br><br>What brought me back is that this is a really cool place, and I never really intended on leaving - it was just something that I&#39;d noticed had happened after the fact. I&#39;m also involved in a couple of long running betaing projects, so if I do drift away again in the future, I may well get called back. Which would be a good thing if it happens, although I&#39;m hoping that it won&#39;t be necessary. <br><br>3) I guess that it just doesn&#39;t match their expectations once they&#39;ve joined up, or it could be that some real life distraction comes along shortly after they&#39;ve joined, and they just weren&#39;t invested enough at that point to stick around. Real life has proved a powerful enough distraction to drag me away, but I’d like to think that I’d always eventually find my way back here if that happens again. <br><br>If I remember rightly from a previous &#39;stats of the Board&#39; post, didn&#39;t you conclude that there were a bunch of IP addresses that regularly view, but don&#39;t post? Maybe some of the MIA newbies are just content to read the stories and what we are up to without actually joining in?<br></p>

            <p>1)  Honestly, I was mostly here for the community.  I liked the idea of sporking badfic, but at the time, I had recently discovered that a site I frequented through most of high school was inaccessible on the network in my dorm, and having just moved, I didn&#39;t really have anybody to talk to.  So I showed up hear, not really sure what to expect!<br><br>2) Certain events roughly a year ago.  I never really planned to come back to the Board, I just started showing up on the chat when I realised that I had been completely without human interaction for about two months.  The PPC is pretty much the only place I hang out, partially due to where I live (2 hours by bike to the nearest town!), partially because it&#39;s where all my friends are.  (Also, where I met my boyfriend.)<br><br>3) I think it&#39;s a combination of factors that pretty much everybody else said better than I possibly could &gt;.<br>I would like to add that this has been a trend that I&#39;ve been seeing since I joined three years ago, and that it&#39;s honestly never really concerned me all that much.

<li>I...honestly didn&#39;t quite know what to expect. I had had no clue that the PPC community was still going quite so strong--in fact, I&#39;d thought it had died out, more or less, quite a few years ago. I wanted to obtain permission to mention the PPC in a Mary-Sue parody I was writing (I&#39;m still writing it--it&#39;s actually the one I used a chapter of for my writing sample) and I also wanted to say hello to the community that created all the writings and so on that I&#39;d grown up with and that had helped shape my writing. I&#39;m not really sure I thought I was getting into anything, beyond a whole lot of excitement over meeting people who were, essentially, a form of celebrities to me. I don&#39;t think I expected to get this far in, though; I certainly wasn&#39;t planning on writing missions and so on quite so soon. So I&#39;d say...it&#39;s been far more than I ever even thought to expect.<br><br>2. I...don&#39;t *think* I&#39;ve drifted away...not for more than maybe a week at the most, and that&#39;s mainly due to being busy. Of course, I&#39;m about to &#39;drift away&#39; for three weeks due to joining a program with no wifi except on weekends, but that&#39;s a separate point. I&#39;m hoping I won&#39;t end up drifting once I start uni in the fall, but it&#39;s a possibility: I&#39;ll have a lot of work, and a lot to adjust to. However, I will most likely be able to keep up (I hope). So while I may not be on quite as much, I probably won&#39;t fade out altogether.<br><br>Basically, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever drifted yet, at least not as a member of the Board. If I ever do, it&#39;ll most likely be due to being very busy with RL and schoolwork (specifically around exam times, I&#39;m guessing).<br><br>3. From what I&#39;ve seen...occasionally people get offended, occasionally people feel like no one shares their interests, occasionally people get busy, and occasionally people just aren&#39;t very good at sticking around as members of online communities. It happens. Alternatively, sometimes people just don&#39;t have internet access for a while, and from there they either come back or just drift away. Occasionally, people just outgrow the community; for instance, I used to be a member of a Warriors RP and discussion community on Amazon (and an HP one, actually, though that was separate). I eventually just stopped being quite so into the series, and some of my friends there left, and it just...didn&#39;t work so well. I think when that happened, my interest in the HP community also waned, and I sort of drifted off into the sunset. I sometimes check back with the HP community, though.<br><br>And now that I&#39;ve bombarded you with blocks of text, I&#39;ll post this and see what else I&#39;ve missed.<br><br>~DF</li>

            <p>1) Honestly? I discovered this thing two years ago, but I was somewhat scared of joining any sort of internet group, even one that worked with fanfiction like this. I wasn&#39;t even sure if it was real, except for the wikia page. After a while, I started to think I was ready to join and finally decided to come aboard. And to be honest, I trolled around for a couple of days before introducing myself, but I really had no idea what I was getting into before I joined. All I knew was it sounded cool and everyone really took me in when I went onto the chat before officially joining (I specifically remember my cat had turned off my sound card and asking Tray what the heck was going on in some horror flick he was showing everyone using a sharing site). I thought then that I&#39;d be doing the mission writing immediately (like I said, I really didn&#39;t think joining through), but here I am four months later and still staying away from the mission writing. I think I still want to wait a bit before asking. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve been on here long enough, or have time to write missions (which reminds me...whenever the next badfic report comes up, I need to attach my old Pit account on there. It&#39;s a mission frenzy). Other than that, though, it&#39;s not all that different. This is one of two sites I&#39;ve ever been on in which the members are like a slightly nerdy family. And I love that.  <br><br>2)I did take a two-three week hiatus at the end of May- the beginning of June, but it had nothing to do with the site. I got sick about two weeks before my final exams, and I was working my butt off to ace finals because I lost that week of review. My post count hasn&#39;t been as large as usual as of late because I&#39;ve been resting. But I&#39;m getting back into it now. Like I said before, we&#39;re a community here. I could never just forget you guys. :) <br><br>3) Part of that might just be the PPC&#39;s nature. I&#39;m a member of another RP site that gets a billion members who sign up and have their name in white, which stands for an unsorted newbie (it&#39;s Harry Potter). Yet they never post and never get sorted. And if everyone who&#39;d joined was active, the site wouldn&#39;t have so few people posting. A lot of the people posting might not have thought it through, like I did. And it&#39;s nothing the PPC is doing particularly wrong- everyone here&#39;s very awesome and welcoming, the posts are good, we get to know each other. The issue is some people joining may not be as interested in the PPC as we are. Or normal life might be getting in the way as well. It might also have to do with the fact that we have to wait a bit before getting permission. Some people may not be interested in building the community. </p>

<li>I don&#39;t remember. It was ten(!) years ago. All I know is that I was also on the OFUM mailing list and a member of a small <i>Farscape</i> fan forum that had similar levels of zaniness and close community, so prior experience definitely stood me in good stead to get along here.<br><br>2. There was a period early on where I drifted away, I think before the time I&#39;m counting from now. Partly it was to do with real life—I would&#39;ve been in my last year or so of high school, some weird stuff was happening in my family—and I hadn&#39;t gotten firmly entrenched here yet, so I think I just sort of forgot the PPC existed for a while. Eventually I found my way back, though, and noticed that there was a <i>Farscape</i> fic up for sporking on the Oddlots main page. I was under the impression I needed a co-writer to work with (that was the norm in those days), so I got active in the course of trying to find someone who knew the fandom well enough to write with me. I ended up finding Artemis, but it didn&#39;t work out—neither of us were very experienced PPCers, and in hindsight, the badfic was too long and the problems too understated to be missionable. I stuck around, though, and the rest is history.<br><br>Oh, there was that hiatus last summer, but I&#39;m not going to discuss that publicly.<br><br>3. Various factors. Some people wander off and forget we exist and/or are consumed with other things, others are daunted by the Permission process or the Board or the learning curve, others just plain don&#39;t understand and don&#39;t fit in. And in my opinion, that&#39;s all perfectly fine. The people I want to stick around are the ones who are enthusiastic about the idea, willing—nay, eager!—to do the homework, able to grasp the concepts involved, and able to get along and make friends. That&#39;s never going to be everybody, and perhaps it&#39;s always going to be a smallish number. C&#39;est la vie.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>Quite the variety of opinions here. As one of the few who made it past two months (though I have been reading PPC  stories even before my first post here), allow me to give my two cents. Now if my memory would just cooperate...<br><br>1/ Before you joined the PPC community, what did you think you were getting into? How did it match up to your expectations?<br><br>Having read the PPC Constitution before I joined, I knew that the Board would be a place of discussion, not about badfics, but about...anything. And having started a few discussion threads (insert <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=239076">shameless</a> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=244737">plugs</a> here), I was not disappointed. And IIRC, I wanted to have at least a better view of when the next PPC missions would come out!<br><br>Long story short, the Board has met (and at times exceeded) my expectations--though I am intrigued how people could find lifelong friends (mush less mates) online.<br><br>2/ If at any point you have drifted away, why? And what brought you back?<br><br>Well, I haven&#39;t drifted away, since I&#39;m always coming here approximately every day.<br><br>3/ Why do you think so many people don&#39;t stick around?<br><br>It could be that they had different expectations. For example, if all I cared about was figuring out when the next PPC mission was going to be published, I might not be sticking around, impatient as I am for a good read.</p>

            <p>I know I haven&#39;t been active recently because I&#39;ve been busy with school and Star Trek and travelling to China,so yeah.

            <p>(This seems like the title of half of my messages here. Hm.)<br>Anyway, to answer your questions:<br>1) Before I joined this madhouse, I thought I was entering a madhouse of the fun type. I mean, I found the PPC&#39;s page over there at TvTropes, liked what I saw, and went over. And, barring a few scuffles with some people, I don&#39;t see a reason to regret joining.<br>2) Well, when I was drafted, and then when I was in my military course, I didn&#39;t quite have access to a computer, so obviously I wasn&#39;t around. It wasn&#39;t voluntary, so I came back at the first oppurtunity.<br>3) Well... I think that most people that end up here want to start writing PPC stuff, and they want to start writing it <i>now</i>. So probably the &#39;hang-around-so-we-can-see-who-you-are&#39; period kinda scares them away.</p>

            <p>I just haven&#39;t been posting on the board. I go into the IRC almost every day though.<br><br>1. I thought I was getting into a fun little community. I wanted to review things and be funny, but as I stayed here I began to realize that that isn&#39;t really what the PPC is about.<br><br>The PPC is about being a community of writers, laughing at the bad and praising the good. It&#39;s about pointing out the flaws of something in a humorous way, but not being mean while doing it. It&#39;s about celebrating the amazing things that can come out of fandoms, and sharing them with others.<br><br>So, no. The PPC didn&#39;t match my expectations. It was much better.<br><br>2. I&#39;ve never drifted away.<br><br>3. I can&#39;t say for sure, but I think it&#39;s because what people are expecting is a writing community, not a community of writers. Newbies who show up really want to get their stories out. I did too. But then they run into getting permission, and well... a month is a long time to wait for some people.</p>

            <p>With regards to item three - maybe we should do more to promote stories, and the pluggage thereof, that aren&#39;t solely PPC? I know a lot of us have our own fanfics or original works that we&#39;d love to get out, get critiqued, and discuss.

            <p>Yup, I&#39;m still alive too!<br><br>Which means I guess I&#39;m qualified to answer your questions :)<br><br>1/ Before you joined the PPC community, what did you think you were getting into? How did it match up to your expectations?<br><br>I&#39;m with a couple other people in that I really didn&#39;t have any expectations. I joined because I wanted to have more of the PPC world, get to know the people that were currently writing spin-offs and to be able to write missions myself perhaps, though I don&#39;t know how much of a writer I really am, but it was one of those impulse things where, if I ever wanted to be able to, I had to join, so I did. :) <br><br>2/ If at any point you have drifted away, why? And what brought you back?<br><br>I haven&#39;t really drifted away, per se. Though it seems like it, since I don&#39;t ever really post. But I do check in with the board to see what&#39;s going on a couple times a day or so.<br><br>As to why I&#39;ve pretty much gone into lurking mode, well several other&#39;s have said it quite nicely. <br><br>VixenMage beat me to it, and no, I&#39;m not looking to bring up the debate again either, but yes, part of it the board style. And I know most people are happy with it and that&#39;s fine, and I can&#39;t say I&#39;d post tons more if it were to switch to a more modern style. I am a member of regular boards, and I lurk there a lot too. I&#39;m just a naturally quiet and shy person, even around my friends in real life I don&#39;t speak up much and am content to just listen to the conversation most of time. However, I do find the board&#39;s older style to be a bit off-putting in that it&#39;s harder to follow conversation lines if you come in after a huge discussion has exploded, and trying to sort things out while scrolling up and down a huge thread, and going back to catch any new posts that happened while I was scrolling around leads me to be less like to to post at the end of things because of the slightly obnoxious effort involved.<br><br>Which leads to what Miah talked about, shared fandoms, and I&#39;ll second that, there are a few that share more than my love for Lord of the Rings, but I&#39;m not big in most fandoms that come across the board. And those that do share some of my other fandoms drift off, or are big into the other major fandoms represented here so they discuss those, and not understanding most of the references, and having spent a major amount of time sorting out the tangled thread, I have a hard time joining in those discussions.<br><br>Also, and though I&#39;m really not trying to harp on the board, being shy, I get worried about posting something that isn&#39;t super important, or likely to inspire an actual discussion since every new topic, big or small, important or not, paid attention to or not, kicks another topic off the front page. And yes we have frivolous topics, and have fun, and that&#39;s great, and I&#39;m not really sure how to explain what I&#39;m trying to say, but every time I run across something that I might post to another board for the fun of it, I think more than twice about posting here as I don&#39;t want to drop topics off the front page. <br><br>I&#39;m also with hermione of vulcan, I used to at least always try to post on newbie threads, but so many of them not only don&#39;t ever seem to post again, but don&#39;t even respond to their welcome thread comments that it gets disheartening. So I&#39;ve pretty much stopped that as well, though as she said it is an important part/tradition of the board, and being welcoming is a great thing, one of the things I like about this place. But as she put it, when you throw a party for someone and they wander off after 5 minutes... I have a hard time getting excited to throw the next party when you know from the pattern of the last 3 that they&#39;ll most likely not stick around for even their welcome either.<br><br>3/ Why do you think so many people don&#39;t stick around?<br><br>I&#39;m sure there are a wide variety of reasons, as Karen and Ekyl said, shyness, which applies to me, or being at a loss of what do here while waiting, especially with the issue of each new topic kicking an old one off the page, coupled with said shyness, and real life. I know as a newbie I was wary of posting new topics because of that. And I have posted a few topics since as I got more of a feel for the place, but in the beginning it was a thing... and obviously not all newbies have that issue, which is not to try and admonish anyone, it&#39;s great, we get some fun discussions, and some serious ones, but they are at least active. I&#39;m just saying I can&#39;t be the only one that was a bit less active because of that fact. And maybe it is a reason why some don&#39;t end up sticking around past their first couple posts.<br><br>Or as Cassie said, maybe they expect continual madcap adventures and stories and we just don&#39;t work like that? Or they are looking for the harder core bashing like doctorlit pointed out.<br><br>And there is probably a fair amount of people who aren&#39;t willing to wait out the permission process, as Ekyl said.</p>

<li>I got pretty much what I was expecting, except that I became closer to the other users here more than I had known was possible online.  I think I&#39;m maybe a little unique in that I enjoy PPC writing less for the humor and more for the feeling of exploring the Word Worlds.<br><br>2. I&#39;ve never left, and I really can&#39;t imagine myself leaving.  I&#39;m just too mentally involved with the setting.<br><br>3. I think many newbies get the wrong idea about what goes on in here.  A lot who come from TV Tropes seem to expect a more aggressive bashing of badfic and authors than what we actually tolerate.<br><br>Honestly, I rather like that not many people join constantly.  I like the PPC being a small community of friendly folks.  It&#39;s manageable and interconnected.</li>

            <p>1 - I started reading various missions from TVTropes links, then found the wiki and read more missions, interludes and backstory, etc before joining.<br><br>I didn&#39;t really even think about joining/getting involved myself until I&#39;d exhausted almost all the content in familiar continua and thought &#39;well what am I supposed to do now, I want more stories dammit!&#39; and then realised that maybe I should write my own!<br><br>I didn&#39;t really have any expectations for the community, although I did lurk on the Board for a while to get an idea for how things work.<br><br>2 - I have drifted away and back due to my tendency to be interested in so many things at once and yet only have a finite amount of time to dedicate to them all (when I finish those flux capacitors, that problem will go away. Muahahaha... *ahem*).<br><br>However, I have never lost interest, and even when I&#39;m not posting or writing, I&#39;ll be lurking around. What keeps my interest is the massive shared world with infinite possibilities, the constant stream of new stories to read, and the many plotbunnies I keep thinking up for my own agents!<br><br>3 - I imagine it&#39;s partly the nature of Internet communities (VM convered this point below far better than I could), and partly the complexity of our shared continuity.<br><br>I am distinctly not saying that this complexity is bad (it&#39;s one of the reasons I love the PPC!), but it could well put people off who don&#39;t want to spend the time investigating and discovering it all. They may then drift away because they feel they would have to fill their headspace with it in order to get involved, rather than picking it up as they go along.</p>

            <p>Yes, I have my cons about the board, but they&#39;re far outweighed by the pros and my general good nature, so I just tend to overlook them.<br><br>I was actually expecting this place to be way more hardcore when I first joined almost a year ago, and ended up being pleasantly surprised that it was more lax instead.<br><br>When I failed to get permission, I only turned down a second try because I realized that I wasn&#39;t actually all that interested in writing missions - I was fairly new then, I just thought it was a status symbol more than anything, so I didn&#39;t put my level best in to begin with, and I was bogged down in real life with other matters so it wasn&#39;t really something I could focus on.<br><br>Nowadays, with everything settling back down, the only reason I&#39;m not on more is because I don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s an obligation of mine to be ever-present on the board, and thus tend to forget that I have membership here at all. <br><br>That, and I&#39;ve found myself getting into Library of the Damned and writing more MSTs, which are really distracting in and of themselves. Not to mention my ongoing large writing projects, and just basically living my life.<br><br>Which, speaking of, got a bit more hectic due to an unexpected death in the family.<br><br>But yes - like my DA journal says, I&#39;m not dead, I&#39;m just a bit more quiet than usual.</p>

            <p>1/ Before you joined the PPC community, what did you think you were getting into? How did it match up to your expectations?<br><br>I really had no expectations when I joined. I had been reading fanfic for a couple of years, and I had gotten extremely annoyed (and sometimes disgusted--ask me what my first slash story I ran across was. I dare you.) with various fics, I had never thought there was anything to be done about it. One day I ran across one of IndeMaat&#39;s missions on the pit, and sort of followed her here like a lost puppy. <br><br>2/ If at any point you have drifted away, why? And what brought you back?<br><br>Hurt feelings and Drama played a big part in drifting. Feeling extremely disconnected has played a big part in having difficulty in coming back fully. I like Tolkien, but I am no where near as dedicated as the original group. I am not into anime or any of the video games that have been popular topics with excited newbies lately. For a while there were at least a few others that I had some shared fandoms with, but they drifted off, and it has just been difficult for to jump back in when I feel like I am only following a small percentage of what is being said, and no one is able to follow what I want to say.<br><br>What keeps me coming back?<br><br>The PPC. This is the most awesome shared world I have ever seen. The backstory, the interactions between people&#39;s agents and missions, the little projects that people start to bring the group closer, the wiki, the work people do to put order to the chaos that is the PPC, the Ironic Overpower. I&#39;ve been around 3 1/2 years, even though part of that has been marginally involved, and it has just sort of become part of my narrative to think of things in terms that the PPC uses. How could I permanently leave when it has wormed it&#39;s way that far into my life?<br><br>3/ Why do you think so many people don&#39;t stick around?<br><br>Wrong expectations when they arrived--especially from a couple of sources of arrival, qualms/fears that we are bullying authors, real life (the PPC is getting older, more careers, marriages, and children than there used to be*), loss of Internet access (this got me for 3-4 months last year), incredibly steep learning curve to get fully engaged in the culture of the shared world.<br><br><br>*My oldest is a teenager now. Can you believe it? I have a kid older than some of our members, and my baby is going to Kindergarten this year. I feel so old.</p>

            <p>If I had to guess, I&#39;d say it&#39;s something between just The Nature of The Beast - people often start things, join clubs, enter forums, and wind up not sticking around because they forget to come back, or life gets busy, or something else comes up, and I think that happens to a lot of things and a lot of people. But also, we... do have an unorthodox sort of forum here, and I do think people get thrown off by that. (This is <i>not</i> an invitation to start debating about The &#39;Board vs. a hypothetical T-Board again, or what have you.) But this &#39;Board is very unique, in this day and age, and I&#39;ve noticed a lot of newbies comment on their confusion at it. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that&#39;s part of the issue some people have.<br><br>Other than that, I guess, what other people have said - we wind up not being what they expect, for whatever reason. Either we&#39;re too serious, or we take writing too seriously, or we&#39;re too off-the-walls, or they expected to get Permission and be having madcap adventures or Serious Grimdark adventures, and that didn&#39;t work out.<br><br>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re scary, hS. You do... loom, a bit. You did when I was a newbie, anyway - now, either I&#39;ve grown a tolerance for looming, or I&#39;ve grown, without realizing it. I&#39;ve been accused of speaking, IRL, as if I always know the answer, or am convinced of my accuracy on a subject, and told it comes off as authoritative/arrogant. I think online, when one speaks with both intelligence and a measure of confidence, people sometimes get the idea that this person should not be argued with, and you get the impression of looming, instead of arrogance.<br><br>(I really, really hope that came off as friendly offering of explanation, rather than snapping-turtle critique, because it really is just friendly observation and I do not think of you as arrogant at all.)<br><br>Anyway. Questions.<br><br>1)<br>Well, it was recommended to me by someone who had taught me the basics of Elizabethan grammar, and was a brilliant writer and mod who was slightly notorious for her high grammatical standards. I&#39;d read the Original Series, exchanged a single e-mail with Jay about permission, and enjoyed OFUM. So I suppose that was the community I was looking for - good writers, with high standards for their writing and canon, and a healthy dose of humor and friendliness. And, more or less, that&#39;s what you were. And are still, I think, for the most part.<br><br>2)<br>Once or twice, I&#39;m sure. For most of the past eight years, though, I&#39;ve checked the &#39;Board either daily or close to it, reading topics that catch my eye and skimming everything else. There were a few nasty drama flare-ups, multiple years ago, when I made the decision to leave, at least for a few months. <i>Every single time</i>, I found myself checking the &#39;Board daily -anyway-, because I&#39;d formed the strong habit, and the URL was ingrained in my muscle memory. (I never wanted to leave permanently because Dann was here, and I couldn&#39;t get up the nerve to talk to him outside of a PPC context.)<br><br>So I guess that would be it. Drama has made me think about drifting away, or setting distances, but so many of my friends are here - this is like a home, I never could.<br><br>3)<br>I guess I answered that one up front? I don&#39;t know why, not really. I see people drift in and out of forums all the time, and the IRC, where I&#39;m more vocal, seems to have a core of regulars that&#39;s grown quite a bit, and it&#39;s slow-growth these days, but we get new people still, who come in every few days and stick around.</p>

            <p>This is why I don&#39;t often welcome newbies. Yes, I know everyone&#39;s different. Yes, I know that it&#39;s a friendly gesture. But it seems to me a lot of people just post their newbie thread and then never come back. It&#39;s like welcoming a person to a party and then watching them leave after five minutes.<br><br>So, to your questions:<br><br>1/ Before you joined the PPC community, what did you think you were getting into? How did it match up to your expectations?<br><br>I knew exactly what I was getting into. I read OFUM and HFA and HFA referenced the PPC, so I read the Original Series. Then when I started writing OFAS, I went looking for information on OFUs and stumbled upon the wiki. That was last summer, and I read a lot of missions and wiki articles and sketched out my agents and their backstories (I&#39;ve reworked them since, but I started the process). I actually debated on whether to to join. I felt it was wrong to make fun of people&#39;s fic like that, so I figured I might just write PPC stories for my own enjoyment and not post them online. But I read several of the FAQs and different works around the wiki and decided I wanted to be part of the community. Then I introduced myself in October. <br><br>I don&#39;t think I had many expectations. If anything, the community was even more welcoming and friendly than I expected.<br><br>2/ If at any point you have drifted away, why? And what brought you back?<br><br>I haven&#39;t been posting as much recently, but that was because I was writing my first mission. (I got permission in January...) But I was lurking, and I started posting again because I saw things to comment on.<br><br>3/ Why do you think so many people don&#39;t stick around?<br><br>It depends on the individual person and their expectations, and then a) how well those expectations fit with the actual PPC and b) how good they are at adjusting when something doesn&#39;t fit their expectations. That&#39;s all I can say for sure.<br><br>A bit of speculation, though: <br><br>They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re getting into. They&#39;ve somehow found the PPC in a way that doesn&#39;t involve actually reading any PPC materials, and they...decide to join a community...for the heck of it? *shrugs* It&#39;s not like we require a lot of commitment, it&#39;s just that they don&#39;t think through their first post and then, maybe, they find that the PPC isn&#39;t for them. I don&#39;t know, it just baffles me, since I was a wiki-lurker for months before joining and agonized over my first post.<br><br>That also goes for the &#39;Hi I&#39;ve just joined can I have Permission?&#39; people. They didn&#39;t think to go read the materials, for some odd reason. Like I said, maybe it&#39;s just incomprehensible to me because I read the materials multiple times before joining.<br><br>Those aren&#39;t great statistics, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything we can do. We&#39;re welcoming and friendly, and we link people to our policies. It&#39;s them, and their expectations, not us.</p>

            <p>Of course, I did disappear for two years, so... <br><br>Anyway, the questions.<br><br>1) It was long enough I don&#39;t actually remember what I thought I was getting into, I just thought it&#39;d be fun to write for and the setting seemed pretty neat. It&#39;s matched up pretty well, for the most part.<br><br>2) I&#39;ve drifted away a couple times - way, waaaaay back it was because I thought the community was dead, and then I&#39;m not sure why back in 2011-ish. I&#39;d always had a hard time finishing missions and stuff, and wasn&#39;t sure how to make them interesting - for a bit I just plain ran out of ideas. I&#39;ll not get into the various dramas that were going on back then, because I don&#39;t feel right dragging it all back up two years later when I&#39;ve been trying to improve my behaviour and be less annoying and such, but between all that, my home life worsening and dealing with all sorts of real life stuff, including getting a job with a newspaper, eventually I just sort of forgot about the place. I came back when I stumbled on one of my stories and felt really guilty about abandoning it and the PPC as a whole.<br><br>3) I think a lot of it is people who aren&#39;t willing to wait out the permission process, don&#39;t really know what to do here or get shy and busy with real life. It&#39;s really just a guess though, and likewise I&#39;m not sure what to do to get people to stick around. I&#39;ll have to think on it a lot more.</p>

            <p>I know that I joined the PPC because I thought it&#39;d be a fun place to learn about bad stories, how to write better, and do a few sporkings of my own. When I left, it was because real life got so busy I couldn&#39;t check the Board very often, and I just sort of fell away (then came back, and am hanging on with my teeth to avoid falling away again now that I have no regular Internet access).<br><br>As for people not sticking around...well, I&#39;d probably attribute it to shyness and Real Life.

            <p>Trust me, I&#39;ve met plenty of people in real life who I regret ever spreading one word to, and one nearly took my life for no discernable reason other than &quot;because he felt like it.&quot;<br><br>For me, it&#39;s more that I&#39;m a victim of &quot;emotions don&#39;t translate well over the internet&quot; - you probably don&#39;t mean any harm in what you say, but due to the pure neutrality of the written word as opposed to the spoken word, I sometimes misread your posts as being arrogant or trying to come of as authoritative in the wrong way.<br><br>The life I lead has taught me to seriously dislike people of arrogant or false-authoritative natures, so I sometimes find myself getting frustrated or cynical when I see a post by you, and I have to reel it in.<br><br>So, yeah. I&#39;m not scared, and don&#39;t feel less in thy holy presence; it&#39;s more that I sometimes lose you in translation and unintentionally make a villain out of you where I shouldn&#39;t.<br><br>It&#39;s similar with Neshomeh at times - my mind misreads her words as being coddling and oversweet, or little more than a sugar-coated backhand, when she&#39;s probably doing nothing of the sort, and so I have to force myself not to see an overbearing librarian.<br><br>Likewise, I imagine some people see me as some clumsy, bumbling, headstrong know-it-all sarcastic dolt who breathes in bile and breathes out apathy, when in reality I can barely even get mad at anybody unless they really are doing something worth getting upset over. It&#39;s just not in my nature to see the bad in people unless items shoved in my face - my humor is more scathing than my real-life personality, and I sometimes walk into stupid mistakes that get people up in arms and put me on the defensive, that&#39;s honestly all it is with me.<br><br><b> So, to recap my rant: it&#39;s not you, it&#39;s the internet&#39;s crappy emotional output.</b></p>

            <p>Though, I&#39;m not sure how &quot;overbearing librarian&quot; fits with &quot;coddling and oversweet,&quot; since my idea of an overbearing librarian is the kind that is constantly telling people to be quiet and scolding them for getting fingerprints on the pages, and my idea of coddling is telling people how splendid and delightful it is that they love books so much even if they&#39;re tearing the pages out and eating them. I&#39;ll cop to a certain kinship with the former, though. I like making order and it bugs me when people don&#39;t notice it, or get it wrong, or ignore it.<br><br>If it helps, I do tend to pick my words carefully, and I do try to avoid confrontations and heated arguments as much as possible while not keeping silent about things that matter to me. I figure I&#39;m not going to be very successful at making points and winning people over to my point of view if I let my emotions get the better of me and just blurt things out without considering the ramifications, and definitely not if I go off on a rant every time some little thing irritates me—but I can see how what I call &quot;exercising restraint&quot; and &quot;picking my battles&quot; could come off as sugar-coating or coddling if you&#39;re the type of person who prefers to be told things bluntly. If that&#39;s the case, I can adjust my approach where you&#39;re involved in the future.<br><br>I find that most people don&#39;t respond well to bluntness, though. The truth hurts; you catch more flies with honey than vinegar; if you can&#39;t say somethin&#39; nice, don&#39;t say nothin&#39; at all; etc.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I can definitely vouch for your approach. And, true to what I said, you only mean well in what you do, but it&#39;s hard to express over the internet, and so some bits are lost in translation.<br><br>I guess I&#39;ve been raised to see coddling and overbearing down to the absolute smallest point. Where I grew up, you were either pushed around and mocked or spoken down to and given a plastic smile, and after eighteen years of that, it definitely has stuck with me, so I&#39;m way more critical now of people who wear a face of niceness around me. <br><br>And, as I said, I sometimes see people choosing their words and misread it as something more nefarious than what is, so I tend to just let my passion fly when I get on a topic that matters to me. It definitely has a habit of upsetting people, but I find when I choose my words and try to avoid confrontation, I get written off as some kind of spineless wimp. <br><br>I&#39;m kind of in a bind anywhere I go, so it&#39;s somewhat unfamiliar for me that people here on the board are as genuine as they are.<br><br>Hence, I have to hold back a lot of misguided thoughts about people - like, trying to explain a point and getting frustrated when it doesn&#39;t click becoming &quot;overbearing librarian&quot;, or being polite and well-mannered being turned into &quot;coddling.&quot;<br><br>If you ever need to be blunt with me, by all means do so, because I can definitely handle it. But, as I said at the start, I&#39;m not much of a combatant personally, and can definitely vouch for a peaceful, unbiased and carefully worded approach.<br><br>Meanwhile, I&#39;ll just continue being good guy SC, how about that?</p>

            <p>But I&#39;m not actually a PG (for all that I may be able to claim the Ye Olde status on other things!).<br><br>For my part, having been here for (counts)... eight years (wow!) here&#39;s my thoughts.<br><br>1. Before joining the PPC, I expected the great community that it was (and still is, albeit different). I saw how people had great collaborative things going on like the Alumia exorcism (which I think was shortly before I joined) and loved the idea of everyone&#39;s spinoffs starting to merge together and people&#39;s agents being borrowed and appearing in multiple places. And it&#39;s great that we still seem to have that (e.g. the Blackout, which I&#39;m just getting up to speed with). That said, the tenor of the Board has definitely changed, IMHO - we&#39;re no longer a primarily LoTR organisation and we perhaps have a smaller critical mass of regularly posting people than we did in the days of yore. We seem not to have the big discussions we used to - at one stage I recall massive philosophical discussions on sometimes-controversial issues, and all done with respect and without flaming.<br>2. Variety of reasons. Real Life is a biggie (including the year when I didn&#39;t have internet at home and I wasn&#39;t 100% comfortable posting to the board from work); at times all these big things seemed to have happened on the board (e.g. the Macrovirus epidemic) and I delurk and go &quot;what the hell has been happening?&quot; and feel all confused. But I always come back - although I average 4 years to write a mission (at least based on my current output!) I still have stories I want to write and I still want to be part of the PPC, even if sometimes it takes me a few weeks to catch up on everything I&#39;ve missed.<br>3. Maybe it&#39;s a combination of the immense history the PPC has accumulated over the years - a sense that it&#39;s a lot of precedent to get your head around - coupled with times when there doesn&#39;t seem to be much happening on the board (or, if you&#39;re in a weird time zone like I am, the IRC seems forlorn and deserted), and you feel like there&#39;s not much happening right now. Which is misleading (there&#39;s so much new stuff everytime I delurk and come back) but I can see how it would be easy to think that not much is happening at times.<br><br>That said, as you can tell by this post, I&#39;m in a non-lurking phase right about now, and hopefully can keep active enough around here to meet all these gosh darn newbies that keep on traipsing on my lawn. You kids!!!!<br><br>Elcalion, feeling old all of a sudden</p>

            <p>Sorry for not posting in ages, but my real life situation is a little hectic right now. Currently I am visiting relatives in Arkansas, and have only now had opportunity to post.

I expected a fun community of writers with whom I could laugh with and improve my writing.

            <p>Hello, peoples. :) I recently discovered the PPC via a link given to me on DeviantArt. Given that my fandoms (Star Wars and Super Mario Bros.) have produced far too many badfics for my liking, I decided, &quot;Hey, why not come here?&quot;<br><br>So, yeah. As (more or less) mentioned above, I&#39;m a huge Star Wars and Mario nerd, and I do know a little bit about Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings, though I&#39;m mostly unfamiliar with them. I also happen to be very anti-slash...but, don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t bite anyone who likes it. ;) <br><br>That being said...do you guys have any cake? </p>

            <p>Well, I thought I would have two new missions to read today, and it turned out to be one mission and the revelation that I am from the future. While I deal with that particular existential crisis, let me give you some concrit here.<br><br>The mission was very short. Not the story, though, the mission itself just took up a very small portion of the story. When I copy-pasted it into Word to get a better look, I found that out of the story&#39;s eleven pages the last time the Agents ended up actually going against badfic components was page six, and when you cut out the agents introducing themselves, it&#39;s really only three pages. That&#39;s an odd proportion, especially since the biggest canon breach was yet to come, which makes the whole After that, about all of it was &quot;they talk to Makuta&quot; or &quot;they realize Makuta isn&#39;t affected by their neuralyzer&quot;... and then they just leave him there.<br><br>The most powerful frequently Sue-targeted being in the continuum, and they leave him with full knowledge not necessarily of the PPC, but at least of Sues and the fact that inter-dimensional travelers enter Mangaia on a regular basis.<br>Take him to FicPsych and get that information <i>out of him</i>! The only reason that certain canons are allowed to know about the PPC is either a) they&#39;re omniscient so they&#39;ll find out anyway, i.e. Doc Scratch or Aslan b) they can recover from anything that affects them mentally so you might as well not even try, i.e. Jack Harkness and most drell (there was once a whole interlude dedicated to trying to remove knowledge of the PPC from Thane Krios, a canon character drell, because of how hard it is to affect their minds), and c) whatever is going on with Murdock and Gaspode, but I&#39;m pretty sure that was made from one part their own mental instability and two parts Rule of Funny.<br>Frequently Sue-targeted individuals are not allowed to know about the PPC. The Sue controlling them can learn about the Agents through them, or if they are possessed or something, the wraith will know about it, which can potentially compromise people going on missions.<br><br>When Teridax is about to leave, he refers to them as &quot;little humans&quot;. There are no humans in Bionicle, and nobody has ever appeared to Teridax out of their disguises. He might have been able to pluck the word from someone&#39;s surface thoughts, but he wouldn&#39;t know what it means.<br><br>Also, you never killed the Makuta replacement. The Rahkshi copies were killed by an angry Teridax, but the Makuta replacement was never dealt with, and given that he was connected enough to canon to quote Teridax&#39;s lines, he would have been able to retain enough Makuta cunning to shapeshift himself into something inconspicuous to hide. Maybe he did, maybe he didn&#39;t. It&#39;s a loose end, and when dealing with Makuta, there should be <i>no</i> loose ends, because a being with their level of raw power could grab it and pull until everything unravels.<br><br>With all that said, the dialogue was fun, especially Maggie&#39;s, and having the formation of the cavern separate the agents from their technology is a good idea that&#39;s simple enough in concept I&#39;m surprised I&#39;ve not seen it before now. Valon comes across very well as the over-excited newbie, and I can see a lot of potential for him, especially when compared to the absolute psychopath he was in his beta stages.</p>

            <p>Some of the problem areas couldn&#39;t be changed at this point without dismantling the whole story, but a few issues that were based around single lines can still be improved on, the &quot;little humans&quot; bit in particular. Just change it to &quot;little Matoran&quot;, or something of the like.<br><br>Nope, it only mentions the not-Rahkshi being killed.<br><br><i>The Makuta’s eyes moved toward the sound. “Are these the creatures that pretend to be my sons?”<br><br>“Yessir,” Maggie squeaked.<br><br>“Then...” There was a great creaking sound that filled the cavern. “... I will eliminate them.”<br><br>Colossal metal hooves hit the ground next to the agents. “They are not...” Stomp. “... my sons.” Stomp. “Therefore...” Stomp. “They are trespassers.” Makuta’s bulk exited through the hole the agents fell through. Once he was gone, the metallic stomping ceased.<br><br>An oppressive silence fell. The agents were afraid to even breathe.<br><br>“SKREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!”<br><br>The Makuta’s wrath was swift and painful, as more not-Rahkshi screeches echoed through the caves.<br><br>“...I forgot to charge them,” Maggie said. “And we’re still stuck here.”</i><br><br>I actually developed a plot-bunny for a PPC tie-in based off of how the replacement in-badfic was only ever called &quot;Makuta&quot;, which is technically a species name. I&#39;m not sure if it would really work, since it requires knowledge of not only another mission, but another mission that could be considered to have broken the rules, but the idea I had drew on Discworld-style concepts and had Vezon in it. Decisions, decisions.</p>
