            <p>The PPC Board is a fluid place. People join, people leave, people post, people stay silent... not exactly unique to the PPC, I know, but there it is.<br><br>What <i>is</i> unique about the PPC is that I&#39;ve taken the time to quantify that fluidity. Through immense effort* and toil** I have crafted a series of graphs and lists to show everyone exactly how the members of this Board work.<br><br>Some of this data goes back to the beginning of the year, and will be presented month by month. Some of it only goes back to the 9th March, since it that&#39;s how far the stats page went back when I found it.<br><br>*&#39;looking at the stats page&#39;<br>**&#39;mucking about with Excel&#39;<br><br><hr>
<br><br><u>General Graphs</u><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/TheChart.png"><br><br>No, sorry, that&#39;s something else. Ignore that.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ViewsPerDay.png"><br><br>This is one of the simplest graphs: the number of pageviews across the Board on any given day. We can see a gradual climb over the course of the last two months, with occasional spikes, presumably when something interesting happened. Right in the middle of the plot is the Blackout RP, of course.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/IPPerDay.png"><br><br>This is the number of IP addresses visiting the Board each day. Again, we see that gradual increase, but no spikes this time.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ViewsPerIP.png"><br><br>This shows why there are no spikes on that last graph. When we get lots of views, it&#39;s because the same people are visiting more often, not because more people are showing up. Perhaps that&#39;s obvious, but it&#39;s nice to see the graph.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PostsPerDay.png"><br><br>The number of posts made per day, going back to January 1st. Once again we see that gentle increase, although whether that&#39;ll be sustained, or is an artefact of the Blackout and its stories, remains to be seen.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I&#39;ve also run Excel into the ground extracting as much as I can about each day. What follows is a summary for each month, including the top ten most frequent posters, newbie counts, returnbie counts (ie, people who made an &#39;I&#39;m back!&#39; post), mission/PPC story counts, Permission requests, and a look at what the active Permission Givers were up to. (Why PGs, when we&#39;re no different to anyone else? Because we&#39;re the only clearly-defined group I could think of. No other reason. And &#39;rank&#39; simply refers to each person&#39;s spot on a list organised by number of posts that month)<br><br><u>January</u><br><br><b>Top 10 Posters          Posts</b>              <br>SpecstacularSC ----------- 164<br>KittyNoodles ------------- 154<br>DawnFire ----------------- 72<br>hermione of vulcan ------- 70<br>World-Jumper ------------- 68<br>firemagic ---------------- 63<br>Lily Winterwood ---------- 61<br>Kaite20 ------------------ 60<br>Great Basil Pasta -------- 48<br>Ellipsis Flood ----------- 40<br><br>Total Posters ------------ 78<br><br>Newbies: Ostlusha, Mind Tool, Kaite20, Blu, DawnFire, Rina, Lynne Lloyd, samanthaheartz.chobotscoop, son<em>of</em>heaven176, Rats, Forestiger<br><br>Returnbies: Constellation, Silverwind, the Irish Samurai, Bronwyn, HerrWozzeck, Tawaki<br><br>Permission Requests: Great Basil Pasta (denied), Duothimier (granted), Blu (denied), hermione of vulcan (granted), Kaite20 (denied)<br><br>PPC Stories: 1x LilacLielac &amp; Tray-Gnome, 1x SeaTurtle<br><br><b>Permission Giver  Posts  Rank</b><br>Cassie ----------- 11 --- 34<br>Huinesoron ------- 4 ---- 52<br>Laburnum --------- 2 ---- 61<br>Neshomeh --------- 17 --- 23<br>Phobos ----------- 14 --- 29<br>VixenMage -------- 10 --- 39<br><br><hr>

            <p>You&#39;re actually not in the active/inactive check - you only joined in April, apparently - but even if you were, it&#39;s not a definitive judgement.

            <p>I think newbies are a bit of a cycle - there&#39;s a, say, 80% high turnover rate, but the remaining 20% usually wind up hanging around for a few years, at least.<br><br>And since these are all &#39;Board stats... probably not.

            <p>I&#39;m very glad that I stayed active too. The PPC is so much fun, and while I expected to be cranking out missions and just about only missions, I find that I want to explore this world a little more then I was expecting. If I had more time to write, I would get that bloody mission out of the way so I could get the interludes I am planning out of the way. I am writing a blackout story, but I need to get the first mission done first for it to make sense. Once I bring in Jumper though... Well, things are going to get interesting.<br><br>I love this community, and while I should probably spend more time on school work and less on the Board, I do have fun while being irresponsible.

            <p>I&#39;m pretty glad I remained active too! But then again, I kind of grew up with the PPC, so it figures that when I finally ended up with the chance to join, I ended up being active. On the other hand, the sheer amount of my activity has been enabled by the fact that I&#39;m on a gap year...I&#39;m not entirely sure what will happen once I start university in September, but I&#39;m guessing I&#39;ll unfortunately be around a little bit less. I&#39;ll still stick around, though; and if I leave, past history has shown that I&#39;ll be back, so that&#39;s something!<br><br>I&#39;m amused by the fact that I&#39;m in the top five for all four months, including the one I joined in, and so proud that I have Permission. Actually, let&#39;s take a short break for some gleeful and ecstatic jumping up and down to the cries of &quot;I&#39;m a PPCer! Aaaah!&quot;<br><br>...ok, jumping over. For now.<br><br>(I probably really need to get a life). On the other hand...<br><br>This is my life now :)<br><br>... XD Ok, I couldn&#39;t help it. Anyone here ever read Dan Bergstein&#39;s &#39;Blogging Twilight&#39;? It&#39;s hilarious, and in the...13th chapter, I think, he comments hilariously on this &#39;You are my life now&#39; line. He says something about always signing his notes like that...and then gives a sample note about something like going out to buy tomatoes, and how the dishes in the washer are clean--and then he signs it, &#39;You are my life now&#39; and his name. It&#39;s just--it&#39;s really hilarious. A bit less so out of context, but in context...tears of laughter.<br><br>I really do need to get started on that article-thing about how the PPC affects young writers, don&#39;t I? Sorry it&#39;s not going to be done quickly, hS.<br><br>(I can&#39;t even believe how long I&#39;ve known about and been vaguely involved in the PPC for. I mean, it&#39;s been *years*. That&#39;s what all the jumping up and down is about: it&#39;s kind of like if your favorite childhood writer suddenly decides to co-write a book with you, or you get to join a band that&#39;s influenced the way you write your music, or something like that. It&#39;s just--it&#39;s pretty amazing. Does anyone else have a story like this? I&#39;m curious...)<br><br>Here&#39;s to being in the top 5 posters for May as well! XD<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>The two in the bottom row are, of course, well known.  I am not familiar with the one top left (other than it being very similar to the cutie mark on a theoretical pony agent that I have rolling around in my head), but I believe I am familiar with the one below and slightly to the right of it.  I could be mistaking it for something else entirely, though.  It all kind of depends on if it is feline or canine, which is a little difficult to tell from the picture.  I think it is a cat, which would add weight to my guess.  On the other side of that particular scale is the fact that it is in a different box than the one bottom left.  The boxes are a mystery, but also a clue, I should think.<br><br>I also have a hypothesis involving the pair in the top middle.  Two different boxes, but both using a book as a central image.  For some reason, I have always associated an open book in a crest with religion and, more specifically, with paladins.  So, that is the direction my brain is taking when I look at those.

            <p>I will not, of course, venture to judge whether your conclusions regarding these hypothetical symbols be anywhere near the mark. Rather, I will restrain myself to three comments, regarding the three sigils you have noted.<br><br>-The emblem which could be either feline or canine may indeed be considered in such light; however, its hue may also merit discussion.<br><br>-That book-centred device to the left is a reinterpretation of an older device, which may perhaps be found in the deep places of time.<br><br>-The other device to the right is, of those which can be found on the Internet, perhaps the most difficult to locate. I will say but this: all these symbols, if symbols there were, would have been drawn by hand in the simplest of programs, MS Paint. In the specific case in question, some distortion of dimensions may have taken place... mostly because I honestly haven&#39;t the faintest idea what&#39;s meant to be depicted on it. ;)<br><br>-A fourth point, for what good is consistency without inconsistency? The boxes may be considered a clue, but they may also be futile...<br><br>hS, having fun</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll just put this here in case someone does not want anything spoiled:<br>THERE ARE SPOILERS UP AHEAD PEOPLE. YE BE WARNED.<br><br>OK, so I have not managed to figure out all of them, but I have some theories and some that I know. The ones I know, surprisingly, are mostly from the pink box, aka, Mary Sue&#39;s. Going from left to right in the pink box, we have: <br>Enforcers of the Plot Continuum<br>I think that&#39;s Sparklev, or something like that. It was featured in the PPC musical, that&#39;s all I know.<br>League of Mary Sue Factories<br>PPC Bioengineering Inc<br><br>In the black box, I have less then no idea, but I have a sinking suspicion that the white dog has to do with the Black Cats. A sort of anti-Black Cats society, probably found within the PPC. The one with the book in it I suspect has to do with the Trans-Canonical Defense Authority. I don&#39;t know why, but I feel like it does. That or the OFU&#39;s. This would be the ones more directly connected to the PPC universe.<br><br>In the blue, we have the Discworld being peeled apart. At least, I think it&#39;s the Disc. Perhaps some wizards who have spent far too much time in the library stumbled across Word Worlds, and formed their own PPC of a sort. Then again, it also looks like Santorini, the island there Atlantis is rumored to have been.  We also have something seeming to do with plotholes.<br><br>In the yellow, we have the Fairy Tale Police Department. Thought we would not know that one, didn&#39;t you? Well, jokes on you! Because of this, I suspect the yellow is not only the &#39;neutral&#39; ones, but canons made to protect other canons or stories.<br><br>That is all the puzzle I have managed to decipher so far. If I find out more, I will let you all know. I can tell this is going to have to do with the PPC multiverse expanding a little, and hyjinks ensuing because of which. If so, Jumper and his &#39;section of the multiverse&#39; might want to come in sooner rather then later. I&#39;ll keep this in mind.</p>

            <p>You know, cause &#39;there is no spoon&#39;, and &#39;the cake is a lie&#39;, and this spanner (as you call it) looks <i>very</i> similar to something else I&#39;ve seen recently, which I was assured didn&#39;t actually exist. <br><br>If this were to exist, then I would be able to recognise 3 of the symbols (incidentally, the ones in the top left, bottom left, and middle of the group in the bottom right), and could take some guesses based on the heraldry of the others.

            <p>Once again, there will be spoilers ahead if anybody does not want to read any spoilers. So stop reading them. Now I&#39;m just filling the space that is shown in the little preview section. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...<br><br>Thanks Sweetie Derail. Now, onto what I think I know. Well, my theory on the atomic symbol with the book inside having to do with the TCDA was shot down, but replaced with one that absolutely must have to do with them. Come on, a gear around a book? It HAS to be them, has to. Therefore, my theory on the black box stands.<br><br>In the pink box, we have... Gondor!? No, wait, that can&#39;t be them. Who is it then... Oh, this must be the Mary Sue city. Afterall, the pink box is Mary Sues. It has to be them, there is no other explanaton.<br><br>Now, with the new symbol in the yellow box... It has to do with Star Treck, that much is evident. If I am correct, we have two different possibilities. One, we will interact with Mary Sue herself, the one who named all the Sues that have came since. Or, we will have a crossover with Ensign Sue Must Die. Which would be amazing.<br><br>As for the location of the symbols on the axis, that much is obvious. The only hesitation I have is: restricted access to what? Word Worlds? The PPC universe? No idea at the moment. We shall see...</p>

            <p>I&#39;d take Sweetie Derail, too, but I don&#39;t know if misspelling an internet meme creates a mini.

I am incredibly angry at my inability to detect most kinds of puns.<br><br>While I would be just as excited as you if we were to be mentioned in Ensign Sue Must Die, that symbol in the center of the yellow box could just as easily be Metroid as Star Trek. (faints after imagining a Star Trek/Metroid/PPC crossover) It&#39;s the two ovals balancing on a triangle in the blue box that has me stumped.</p>

            <p>Have fun with this one, Hermione of Vulcan! Be as mean as you want! :)<br><br><br>Name: Raven Crowe (Raven for short).<br><br>Race: Reman.<br><br>Gender: Female (obviously).<br><br>Select the ones that you are familiar with/have written for: Star Trek: 2009<em>, Star Trek: The Original Series</em>, Star Trek: The Next Generation x, Star Trek: Voyager x.<br><br>Favorite of the above: The Next Generation.<br><br>Lust Object: Shinzon.<br><br>Favorite Character: Shinzon. I mean come on, he&#39;s sooo badass!<br><br>Favorite Pairing: Shinzon/Raven.<br><br>Favorite Pairing of canon characters (skip if same as above): Erm... Picard/Borg Queen?<br><br>Select one: Command<em>, Security</em>, Science x, Engineering<em>, Non-Starfleet</em>.<br><br>Do you have an OC? Yes, that&#39;s who I&#39;m writing about right now... you didn&#39;t think I&#39;d tell you my real name, did you?<br>If so, describe their appearance and personality: Slim, Reman female, cunning, the best tactician ever... Oh, and yes she is psychic.<br><br>Do you know what a Mary Sue/Gary Stu is? Yes.<br><br>If so, have you written one? Of course not! Well, I don&#39;t think so...<br><br>Do you write slash? Definitely not.<br><br>If so, for whom? See previous answer.<br><br><br>A/N: Raven Crowe is quite intelligent and not easily spooked. She relishes a good intellectual challenge and is guilty of Hermione Granger tendencies. Things that might dissuade other people are likely to make her more determined, because she sees it as a challenge. Without sufficient challenge provided, she will quickly get bored of the matter at hand and resort to scheming. She takes pride in her good SpAG (but is at OFAS thanks to bad characterisation and Mary Sue-writing). She is rather taken with the idea of Badass!Picard - while she admits to fancying Shinzon, she&#39;d probably go for Locutus of Borg as well, given the chance.<br>I can imagine she will find being psychic is not as fun or easy to control as she might hope. Oh, and feel free to feed her to the Borg if you want... it would probably serve her right (although it still might not stop her scheming - an intellectual challenge is an intellectual challenge, after all, and having implants is cool/badass).</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad that I skipped over the Star Trek TNG movies. Of course, I did watch Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and that wasn&#39;t exactly a gem either.<br><br>If Nemesis is the blight on the universe that every Star Trek fan I&#39;ve ever talked to says it is, I might actually watch it one day just to see how bad it is. Since the entire Internet seems to passionately hate it, the &quot;badness meter&quot; is immediately narrowed to the top end of the scale, but that still leaves a lot of categories. Is it Star Wars: Episode II bad? Is it full-on Night of the Lepus bad? I&#39;ll never know unless I find out, but then again, I might not want to.<br><br>Maybe it would be just as beneficial to have Star Trek Nemesis as the never-observed monster in the background. Once you see something, exactly how awful it is is set. But if whatever would have been seen is never observed at all, only heard from by the rumors and rages of the world, one&#39;s imagination can fill in, like what happens in the better caliber of horror movies, only with disgust instead of fear.</p>

            <p>Generations is decent, First Contact is epic amazing, Insurrection is meh, and I made my feelings on Nemesis abundantly clear. You can skip Insurrection, but definitely see Generations and First Contact. <i>Most definitely</i> First Contact.<br><br>I too delayed watching Nemesis because of what I heard. Then I did, and I actually don&#39;t regret it (that much), because now I understand what they&#39;re talking about.<br><br>I agree with you on the Slow Motion Picture, though.

            <p>Thanks :)<br><br>Seriously, it shows the Enterprise. For five minutes straight. And then it shows a ten minute reaction shot. And then twenty more minutes of the Enterprise.

The Time Engineer and I and the friend we watched it with...well, let&#39;s just say we mocked it.<br><br>The ending wasn&#39;t too bad, though, if I remember correctly...<br><br>(Haven&#39;t seen Nemesis yet, hence my lack of commentary).<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>In a contrived way, too. Just because Brent Spiner didn&#39;t want to play him anymore. Um, it&#39;s the last movie, Spiner. You <i>totally</i> have to keep playing a character after the series is over.<br><br>Also, the movie spent less time developing what could be a good plot (Picard is cloned by the Romulans, and meets the younger, more evil version of himself) and more time on <a href="http://www.hungh.com/upload/SkullBot/picard_dune_buggy.jpg">Picard in a dune buggy</a>. Because you know, they don&#39;t have shuttles or any other form of cooler transportation in the future. The dune buggy is just the most egregious example of spending too much time on special effects and not enough on characterization and, well, plot. <br><br>And all of it can be explained by some of the comments from the director, that I saw because I saw Nemesis on DVD. He stated outright that he wasn&#39;t a Trekkie, and that he directed it like an action movie, not a Trek movie. Because you don&#39;t direct a Trek movie like a Trek movie, no sir.<br><br>Sorry about all the Sar-Plasm coating the walls. But yeah, that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with Nemesis. </p>

            <p>Was the result of a brainstorming session for OFAS between me and my sister. We tried to think of the race that would be least likely to be submitted, that would be most unattractive to Suethors, and one of us - I don&#39;t know who - said &quot;Borg!&quot; And then we came up with Eight. Apparently we were wrong to think no one would submit a Borg student.<br><br>The Borg Queen teaching has turned out to be such a brilliant idea. I can&#39;t think what it would have been like without her. Less conflict, less awesome. I thank you.</p>

            <p>...but I don&#39;t really know what to make him/her. It can&#39;t be me, because there are too many versions of me running around the Canon Protection Initiative already, but--oh. OH.<br><br>Nevermind. I&#39;m going to take one of my goodfic characters and warp her. That should work. (Ok, on second thought, I&#39;m taking an earlier version of her and turning her into a World One fangirl. Should be interesting.)<br><br>(Applications haven&#39;t closed yet, right?)<br><br>Name: Sylvia Silverson, but you can call me Syll if you like ;)<br><br>Race: Liek, half-human, half-Vulcan, and half-Romulan. And I grew up with Klingons.<br><br>Gender: Female, of course! How many guys do you meet named Sylvia?<br><br>Select the ones that you are familiar with/have written for: Star Trek: 2009<em>X</em>, Star Trek: The Original Series<em>X</em>, Star Trek: The Next Generation<em>X</em>, Star Trek: Voyager<em><br><br>Favorite of the above: AOS and TOS!<br><br>Lust Object: Ooh, um...Kirk *giggle* and Spock, of course, and...and...and Uhura and Checkov and AOS-Sulu and McCoy. And Geordi, because he&#39;s so cool!!<br><br>Favorite Character: Oooohhh....I don&#39;t know...that&#39;s such a hard question!! Like, Kirk, I guess, because he&#39;s so tortured! He was on Tarsus, you know. It was <i>awful</i>.<br><br>Favorite Pairing: K/S all the way! But sometimes McSpirk, because they&#39;re awesome together. And, and Scotty/Uhura. They&#39;re totally underrated.<br><br>Favorite Pairing of canon characters (skip if same as above): Spock/Nyota in the new movie!! They&#39;re so cute togehter! I just can&#39;t stand most of the fic about them.......<br><br>Select one: Command</em>X<em>, Security</em>, Science<em>, Engineering</em>, Non-Starfleet_<br><br>Do you have an OC? Uhhhhh.....maybe. I barely use her, though. Her name&#39;s Sylvia Dupont ;)<br><br>If so, describe their appearance and personality: Well, she&#39;s got honey-brown hair, and pretty eyes, and she likes really old music. And she&#39;s strong and tortured and sad and happy, and Kirk rescues her and they fall in love!!! But only in one fanfic, because I like writing without OCs better. And she&#39;s been a Captain twice and her parents were divorced and she was on Tarsus too!! But like I said, I don&#39;t really use her much.<br><br>Do you know what a Mary Sue/Gary Stu is? Liek, totally!! The PPC hunt them down, and your character shouldn&#39;t be one. I totally ran Sylvia through a Mary-Sue test, but I think it was lying......<br><br>If so, have you written one? Liek, no! Ew. Who would want to write a Mary-Sue???<br><br>Do you write slash? Didn&#39;t you see my favorite pairings list?<br><br>If so, for whom? Same answer!!!<br><br>A/N: Yup, one of her lust objects is a mini-tribble/mini-Gorn. Do with that as you will.<br><br>Also, Syl&#39;s been warped pretty far. In fact, she&#39;s been warped so much that I think she&#39;s going to become the author of the goodfic once she&#39;s graduated. Wow. I love it when things work out like that!<br><br>Anyway. Syll Silverson has light brown hair and grey eyes, although who knows what that&#39;ll be distorted into now that she&#39;s put such a mishmash of species on her application form. She&#39;s a fangirl with a lot of canon knowledge, who prefers to write slash rather than OCs (although when she does write OCs, she tends to be blind to Mary-Sues in her own writing). She&#39;s a fan of the PPC stories, and will totally fangirl over any agents who happen to be at OFAS. Her SPaG isn&#39;t <i>terrible</i>, but she does make mistakes and have a tendency to over-punctuate. She also has an unfortunate tendency to write canon characters OOC just to make her stories work, even though she loves the way they are in canon and will jump on anyone else who writes them OOC.<br><br>...in other words, she&#39;s a hypocrite.<br><br>She also knows relatively little about TNG, so some concepts will get her fangirling and some will just make her go &quot;Huh??&quot; She often gets along with people, as long as they don&#39;t get in the way of her fangirling.<br><br>--<br>If you&#39;re curious, Sylvia &quot;Syll&quot; Silverson&#39;s OC was made by taking the most Sueish traits of Syl Dupont, as well as some bits that got thrown out for obvious reasons, and throwing them out of context and making them even worse. Syll has checked Command because Communications wasn&#39;t there and she&#39;s a complete Kirk fangirl...and this was so much fun to write, you have no idea. I mean, Syl&#39;s barely recognizable, but that was kind of the point.<br><br>So! Warp away! And I&#39;m sorry if I rambled in places, I&#39;ve been having some concentration problems due to my cold (which, thankfully, is going away...I think...I hope...ugh.) (I also like to babble, but that&#39;s beside the point.) I do hope this submission hasn&#39;t come too late...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been looking forward to this for ages!<br><br>I see Her Majesty has made an appearance, heeheehee.<br><br>I also found a couple of errors, notably:<br><br>1. Troi&#39;s line ending in &#39;... is that clear!&#39; could probably do with a question mark.<br><br>2. Alli&#39;s line &#39;and then I came out here&#39; has a random newline in the middle.<br><br>3. Nora&#39;s line &#39;&quot;We can lust after who we want&quot; is missing a newline... well at least we know where it went! :D<br><br>4. The line below, Alli seems to be &#39;scowling at ths Borg hallways&#39; instead of &#39;the&#39;.<br><br>5. You seems to be alternating a little between &#39;the Borg Queen&#39; and &#39;The Borg Queen&#39;; best to pick one or the other (I dread to think what minis of her would be like). Also, I do not think the Borg Queen would use contractions (like &#39;what&#39;s&#39;).<br><br>Apart from that, very good indeed - nice and long, too. I particularly enjoyed the repeated worry every time they came across the Borg corridors. Oh, and the students seem to have a quandry... they need to pass all classes to pass the course, but who wants to be considered worthy of assimilation? I feel sorry for poor Troi, as well.<br><br>I would also be happy to beta for you in future, should you wish.</p>

            <p>And I was so sure I got everything. Especially the spelling error.

            <p>The next issue of the Multiverse Monitor will probably come out in early June or so, but it&#39;s good to get the ideas on the table first and add and change as necessary. These are all the pages I&#39;ve got down so far:<br><br>Pages<br>0 - Front Cover<br>1 - Advert <br>2 - Briefing <br>3 - Canon character of the issue - Spock<br>4 - Spock (cont.)<br>5 - Feedback page<br>6 - either Feedback continued or the Editorial (moving it up from the next to last page). The Editorial would be on the Kill and Scram debate<br>7 - Blackout Cleanup - Coverage of the Ypurescue and other events<br>8 - Cleanup cont.<br>9 - Advert<br>10 - OFU-squared - Teaching Credentials through Pain<br>11 - OFU-squared cont.<br>12 - Canon scenery of the issue - Hogwarts<br>13 - The Sue Lord - A New Species of Sue<br>14 - How to defeat the Sue Lord, by Agent Jacques Bonnefoy<br>15 - Cover story 4 (no idea what to put for this one; make your suggestions today! or better yet, do something newsworthy.)<br>16 - Cover story 4 cont<br>17 - Gossip<br>18 - Reviews - Missions, goodfics, food, I dunno<br>19 - Back advert<br><br>All of these are subject to change with the introduction of newsworthy material.<br><br>Obviously for some of these articles I&#39;m leaning towards certain people - hS and other OFU writers involved in the OFU-squared story for that article; hS&#39;s Terri Ryan for the Kill and Scram debate editorial; hermione-of-vulcan for the Spock article; DawnFire for the Sue Lord article; Fish Custard, DawnFire, and other Blackout writers for the cleanup article. And, of course, there&#39;s a blank spot for a fourth cover story that can be filled accordingly.<br><br>As for adverts, feedback, and gossip, anyone can contribute. Feedback is simply Agents and other staff reacting to the previous issue and/or submitting random short opinions; gossip is Agents and other staff submitting gossip which may or may not be true. Since they are in-universe, Permission is required. Adverts are given by suggestion, picture, and possible text.<br><br>If you&#39;re interested, give me your email so I can add you to the google doc. Thanks!</p>

            <p>First you claim a story that hasn&#39;t already been claimed. Some of the stories have been claimed but aren&#39;t listed as such on the document, so there&#39;s that. Others are partial contribution, which means you too can help write a portion of the story, or help edit it, or something.<br><br>And no, people just haven&#39;t been putting the stories in. It&#39;s early days; the deadline&#39;s more or less in June and people have finals and testing and stuff.</p>

            <p>So, my friend and I found this: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/905456/1/Time-Travel"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/905456/1/Time-Travel">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/905456/1/Time-Travel</a></a> We have decided that it&#39;s a badfic of...well, perhaps not the <i>highest</i> order, but it&#39;s pretty bad. It features Angela Jackie (occasionally Angela-Jackie) Chandler, a nine-year-old girl from 1942 who ends up on the <i>USS Enterprise-D</i> and immediately charms Crusher, Picard, and, apparently, Ambassador Spock. Her grammar is atrocious; she creates the &#39;hollowdeck&#39;, and then pulls in Q and is somehow related to Picard. I&#39;m thinking of taking it.<br><br>What do you think? How horrible is it? (Comments and outrage are welcome, since I&#39;m not really up-to-date on TNG--although even I can tell that Picard is OOC).<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I wish I was kidding, but I&#39;m not.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108490/1/Meet-Black-America">This</a> is a rather annoying Hetalia fic that ended up very Sueish at the end, which is why I&#39;m bringing it here for your viewing...pleasure. It features &#39;Black America&#39;, or Addy, America&#39;s wife. She&#39;s able to shut up the other nations by yelling—apparently, she&#39;s a force to be reckoned with—even though her SPaG is so bad that it looked like America was the one who was yelling (complete with random gender change). It&#39;s short, but it&#39;s bad. Read at your own risk.<br><br>As to &quot;Lady America&quot; (listed as <i>Avengers</i>, but it&#39;s really )...I&#39;m not actually sure, and I&#39;d like a second opinion (also open to third, fourth, etc). I clicked on it expecting to be confronting a Sue of epic Sueness; instead, I met Marty Barnes, who was actually pretty likable, beyond the occasional historical/military issues, the SPaG, and some tense shifts left over from rewrites. Considering the author was 14 years old for most of the story (apparently she celebrated her birthday somewhere in the middle), it&#39;s...actually, that doesn&#39;t really have much bearing on anything, I just thought I&#39;d mention it. While it is a Steve/OC romance, the romance part was progressing quite naturally and realistically, apart from the occasional (although surprisingly not painful) use of a cliched plot device. There is extremely little Peggy bashing (although she does come across as slightly OOC to me), and most characters are kept impressively IC. Even the language isn&#39;t jarringly modern; the worst anachronism I can think of is when Marty puts on capris.<br><br>So, it was progressing quite nicely, for the most part. I was all prepared for Bucky to fall off the train, and for Steve to have someone to mourn with; I was even wincing at the thought of reading it, because the author had managed to make me care about Marty, and about fic!Steve, and I was sure that it was going to be sad, and that I might even sniffle a bit. But then...<br><br>She saved him. Out of the blue, she managed to save him, when <i>Captain America failed under the same circumstances</i>. And without any explanation of she succeeded where Steve failed canonically. And from there it&#39;s just been going downhill.<br><br>On the other hand, I really do like pre-chapter 17 Marty (although I&#39;m a bit curious as to whether her nickname is at all reasonable for the era). Honestly, I&#39;d like to recruit her. But on the other hand, it&#39;s quite possible that I&#39;m blinded by the fact that she reminds me a lot of Bucky, and that Bucky&#39;s one of my favorite characters, so...second opinion, please?<br><br>I wrote down an analysis/charge list thing. You can find it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHLDO4Hq_DKO4lvboY-60R_0KeHF8VCtbzF4ag7NlME/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, along with a link to the actual fic. It&#39;s quite short—just a page and a quarter (my analysis, not the fic). I think I&#39;ve made it so you can comment on the doc, if you like, but here on the Board also works :) Basically...help?<br><br>And, as a &#39;bonus&#39; of sorts, have a <i>Twilight</i> badfic! It&#39;s ridiculously short, and, in short, utterly ridiculous. It seems to be some sort of AU. I don&#39;t even know. <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7138327/1/Lady-Tanya">This</a> is it, if you&#39;re curious.<br><br>I have some other potential badfic (it came up when I searched &quot;Lady America&quot; on FFN) but I haven&#39;t gone through it all yet. I may make another post later...<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t tackle the Hetalia one, because it&#39;s kinda... racially sensitive? Like, I would personally feel really uncomfortable having my Agents kill Addy because honestly as problematic as the fic is (making America so bloody lecherous, throwing people OOC, bad SPaG, suggesting that Alfred is incapable of representing an entire nation by himself while not having these alt-race representations of other countries as well), killing it would open another can of worms.<br><br>Like I know the idea has its merits, since Hetalia itself is pretty darn whitewashed which may affect fanwriters who want to write an America that isn&#39;t a white male like Alfred, but it was poorly executed. Concrit might be good for the author, but a PPCing seems a bit too much.</p>

            <p>I was looking on the Hetalia wiki just now, and apparently there are several micronations(Apparently they chose to include Principality of Hutt River, which made me smile, but not Talossa, which I didn&#39;t like. Talossa is hilarious. They staked a claim to the east side of Milwaukee, a beach in France, and an eighth of Antarctica.) that manifest as small children. Is this related to their national prestige or something of the sort? Will a country-person(or Nation, as you implied their species name is) grow to maturity once it is accepted as another country by the other Nations, and then age into an old man when their country is no longer influential or well-remembered?<br><br>As for the whole just-showing-up-when-the-country-begins aspect of their creation, I understood that, at least. Of curse, this means that the entire show is about American Gods-level tulpae, but that&#39;s actually kind of awesome. That would also explain why they don&#39;t age past a certain point, too.</p>

            <p>Me, I just saw a Sue and made the report, but there you have it.

            <p>Considering the history of racism in America, the European-influenced culture in this place has been pretty exclusionary to people of colour, which would create the modern phenomenon of the &quot;tossed salad&quot;. Instead of everyone being melted together, America is a place where you can be African-American, Chinese-American, Mexican-American, etc. Thus the subsets of culture in America could conceivably be personified as something akin to Black America, etc, since Black culture in America has been (until recently) looked down upon by the predominant culture. <br><br>That, and Alfred can&#39;t even begin to understand what it&#39;s like to be a minority because of his portrayal in canon.<br><br>So yes, poorly executed idea.</p>

            <p>What exactly are all of the country-people?<br>Are they supposed to be anthropomorphic personifications of their country&#39;s overall identity like the Grim Reaper or Father Time, are they supposed to be real people behaving similarly to how a person from their country might behave, or what?<br>Also, can they act without prompt, or are their actions supposed to always represent historical events?

            <p>They&#39;re kinda like the old-time country personifications. Instead of Britannia/John Bull and Marianne you have Arthur and Francis. Instead of Uncle Sam you have Alfred. They&#39;re said to be working for the current leader of the country, so Alfred&#39;s boss is President Obama.<br><br>I don&#39;t think all of their actions are supposed to be historical events, or else all the fanservice shenanigans during the holidays would have to be mirrored with real life. But since they are personifications, the majority of their characteristics and friendships must at least refer to history/current events to be believable. <br><br>I believe they retain a degree of autonomy because while they claim to represent a nation and they have the basic stereotypes of said nation, they aren&#39;t fully bound to it as you&#39;d expect. Ludwig (Germany) once said he thought Hitler was nuts, after all.<br><br>The countries can interact with people; there&#39;s an entire arc where Francis meets a random girl in France and has a conversation with her, thinking her to be Jeanne d&#39;Arc reincarnated. It was really sweet, actually.<br><br>Um, there&#39;s Gilbert (Prussia); he&#39;s a character even in the modern strips/anime despite Prussia not being a country. However, nations like Ancient Rome and Holy Roman Empire have vanished, but Holy Roman Empire&#39;s implied to be a younger Ludwig, so there&#39;s that.</p>

Now, I&#39;m not sure who came up with mini-tribbles (although they&#39;re quite adorable), but I know that Hermione of Vulcan, author of OFAS (the ST OFU), wrote Q turning them into mini-Gorn so as to be more helpful in corralling students.

            <p>The minis of a canon tend to be something that is easily recognized to those who are familar with the fandom. I&#39;ve known Star Trek for years, and I&#39;ve never heard of a targ before you mentioned them just now.

First of all, OFU stands for Offficial Fanfiction University, which is exactly what it sounds like - the canon characters teach badfic writers to write better.

            <p>Yeah, I&#39;ve seen her deviantART page, and the Blood Raining Night website (as well as managing to watch a few - I can&#39;t remember how many excatly - of the youtube episodes). <br><br>It&#39;s impressive, in a twisted sort of way, all of the extra stuff that&#39;s sprung up around the fic (although it would be more impressive if all of the artwork wasn&#39;t so samey).<br><br>It&#39;s kind of making me wonder if it really is a troll or not. I mean, you read the fic, and it&#39;s <i>got</i> to be a troll, right? But then there&#39;s animated episodes, pages of artwork... it&#39;s own frakking <i>website</i>. It just seems like an astonishing amount of time and effort (well, OK, maybe not so much on the &#39;effort&#39; side) to go to just to get a rise out of people. </p>

            <p>Connecting to what SeaTurtle said, we tend to post most reported badfics to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Unclaimed_Badfic">Unclaimed Badfic</a> page, so before posting something to the Board, make sure you check that it isn&#39;t there or on the <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2013/ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic">Claimed Badfic</a> or <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2013/ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Killed_Badfic">Killed Badfic</a> pages, because if it&#39;s already there, we&#39;ve already seen it.<br><br>Enthusiasm is always welcome, though, so I&#39;m not saying to stop looking for things to post.

            <p>Hello!<br>I&#39;m the Time Engineer, and I&#39;d like to introduce myself to the PPC Board. <br>I am in  first year Engineering at McMaster University, and I was shown this PPC universe a couple of days ago. <br>My areas of expertise include Doctor Who, Star Treks TOS, TNG, DS9 and ENT, Torchwood, Big Bang Theory, Elementary, Sherlock, Supernatural, Quantum Leap and cooking dinners. I&#39;m a pretty good researcher, both in the Real World and in different universes, so you can call on me if you need anything looked up.<br>That being said, this place looks extremely cool and I&#39;m excited to join the Community!<br>~TE<br></p>

            <p>Glad you decided to join! I wasn&#39;t sure if you&#39;d end up liking the PPC, or just thinking I was crazy, so I was quite relieved (and excited) when you said it was awesome and proceeded to dissect a badfic with me :)<br><br>Welcome to the Board! Here, have some Swiss Bleepolate and a tribble (I have a few too many of them from when Hermione started throwing them around at my Permission Granted party), as well as a bottled Fallen Angel!Mary Sue&#39;s Grace (no idea what it&#39;ll do, but it could power some interesting experiments, don&#39;t you think? Be careful, though, it&#39;s rather pink and sparkly, which never bodes well).<br><br>For anyone reading this who isn&#39;t the Engineer (I&#39;m trying to find you a nickname, I&#39;m not really sure what to go with yet), I (and you?) have him to thank for introducing me to <i>Doctor Who</i> (and therefore <i>Torchwood</i> as well) and the <i>Avengers</i>. (To be honest, he kept referencing DW, and I started watching it to find out what he was talking about. I ended up liking it, so I continued watching.) So...thanks, Time. (No, I like &#39;Engineer&#39; better. &#39;Time&#39; makes you sound like an anthropomorphic representation of time, which would be very interesting in HQ--and on missions, presumably in ESAS--but means it&#39;s not so great as a nickname).<br><br>So, again, welcome to the Board :) Glad to have you here.<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not certain how one could fake eating a gun, but you have to admit, the camera angles <i>were</i> suspicious. <br><br>Everybody seems to think that the bouncy ball had something to do with preventing John from getting the pulse on a (presumably live and genuine) Sherlock-on-the-sidewalk, but I&#39;m somewhat suspicious: it seems too obvious for it to be anything other than a red herring.

            <p>My idea is that he fired a blank bullet into his mouth and had a small tube with blood attach to the back of his head through his hair. There would have been a seal that ruptured when his head hit the ground, and the pressure of his back on a sack of blood in his coat would keep it flowing. Bear in mind that we don&#39;t see his body get taken away.</p>

            <p>Of course, I just watched &quot;The Menagerie&quot; this morning, so I&#39;m not very far in. I have managed to keep myself from laughing (much) at the styrofoam rocks, and I quite like it now that they&#39;ve started having plots besides &quot;thing impersonates crew members&quot; or &quot;strange powers are dangerous.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m also thinking that the McCoy &amp; Spock dynamic is seriously flanderized by all the fanfiction and spinoff works I&#39;ve seen: they really do get along, in a way, because they clearly trust each other and will defend each other, and the only reason McCoy keeps trying to wind Spock up is because it doesn&#39;t actually work.<br><br>...

            <p>Marvin: Sounds like a bad ship name.<br><br>Printworthy: Agreed. Honestly, Rainbow Dash/Twilight Sparkle is a very unlikely pairing. I cannot think of how that particular relationship would reasonably work.<br><br>Marvin: Says the pony who was shipped with Rainbow in his home fic. Being a little defensive are we?<br><br>Printworthy: First of all, all you know of my origin story is what I have told you. Second of all, upon review of the specific wordings, it was more of a, what do you call it, &#39;ship-tease?&#39; Further feelings were played with, not firmly established.<br><br>Marvin: Whatever you say Printworthy. Besides, I know several TwiDash shippers.<br><br>Printworthy: And were their fanfictions any good?<br><br>Marvin: ...Not really...<br><br>Printworthy: My point exactly. <br><br>Marvin: Hold on, look, in the second half of the cookie name! Look closer.<br><br>Printworthy: What, I don&#39;t...Oh. I see what you mean. Sueblood.<br><br>Marvin: Yep, which seems like a shipping between Mary Sue and...<br><br>Printworthy: Blueblood. Interesting, I never thought I would feel sympathy for that poor excuse of a character.<br><br>Marvin: Yeah. I never thought I could feel sorry for a Sue either.<br><br>Printworthy: Her glitter reserves are going to be stretched quite thin trying to make him kind and gentle, rather than a royal pain.<br><br>Marvin: Is that the only insult people-erm, ponies, can use against him?<br><br>Printworthy: Well, I could call him a pompous, arrogant, moronic, spoiled failure of royalty, and that it astonishes me that even a sixteenth of a drop of Celestia&#39;s blood runs through his veins, but &#39;royal pain&#39; seems to condense that statement a little. <br><br>Marvin: I see what you mean.<br><br>((I know that was not what you were intending to say, but it just would not get out of my head.))</p>

            <p>I can tell that much.<br><br>0. Aw...You should, if you have the chance, especially Portal. It&#39;s a puzzle game and is amazing with the space-warping ability of the portals. If you stop and think about it too much, it starts to hurt your head. Besides, who does not love a crazy computer telling you terrible yet hilarious things while you are trying to solve puzzles?<br>1. Excellent. I hope you like Lord of the Rings, because that is pretty much all they work with. OK, so they go to the Discworld once or twice, and at one point works with a LoTR crossover with Star Wars, but other then that, pretty much all LoTR.<br>2. Good.<br>3. Aw...We could use somebody who knows technobabble though. Ah well, if you do stick around, I&#39;ll make sure to ask for the sciencey-sounding explanation when I need it.<br>4.

            <p>The Dilithium Crystals bring the deuterium and anti-deuterium together in the proper intermix. You always hear about getting the intermix ratio correct, which at first glance seems to be nonsensical i.e. if you have matter and antimatter, then shouldn&#39;t the ratio be 1:1? The deuterium is injected in greater amounts than the anti-deuterium, and the energy released by the annihilation is transferred through the Dilithium into the leftovers, which powers the ship via the EPS (electro-plasma system) grid.<br><br>Thanks! Trek talk is one of my favorite things to do.<br>I&#39;m not altogether sure which ones my favorite. I&#39;m currently in the middle of Enterprise, I liked DS9 and TNG.

            <p>I&#39;m kind of not sure where &#39;Basically anything except a PPC story&#39; comes from in that link... as far as I&#39;m aware, people are still allowed to write an interlude (usually their agents&#39; introduction) as their writing sample.

            <p>My &quot;agents&#39; introduction&quot; piece sort of collided with my Blackout interlude, and the latter swallowed the former and incorporated all of its story ideas.

            <p>Or perhaps &quot;no, but&quot;?<br><br>Well, either way, the problem I personally have is that Floaters ostensibly take any kind of mission in any fandom, but in practice most of them seem to end up taking lots of Mary Sues in maybe two or three fandoms. IMO, what Floaters ought to be doing is filling in the gaps between what the other departments are covering, not selectively mirroring them.<br><br>So, for you, you want to take bad crossovers and Sues. That&#39;s cool, but considering how often Sues are behind bad crossovers (believe me, it&#39;s hard to find a bad crossover without at least some kind of possession at the heart of it), you could just as easily pick one of those departments and cover the same stuff without pretending not to specialize in the meantime.<br><br>So, that&#39;s where I stand on it. I wouldn&#39;t deny Permission just for putting your agents in Floaters, though. I <i>will</i> melodramatically groan and roll my eyes if you do, but unless there are worse problems, that&#39;ll be the extent of it. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I know I can&#39;t really speak for anybody else here, but the reason I picked Floaters for my agents is not a matter of the missions I&#39;m doing right now, but a question of the missions I have planned in the future.<br><br>What you seem to see as the issue -the flexibility, if I&#39;m reading right- is <i>exactly</i> why I use it.  I <i>want</i> to be able to have my agents go on missions in bad slash, Sue elimination, crossovers, and actually have these missions planned out in advance.  They&#39;re just a matter of finding the <i>right</i> fic to do the missions with.  The reason why I tend to do Sues is... well, mostly because Suefics that fit the tone I want to write with are much easier to find then, say, a slash mission that fits what I want to write.</p>

            <p>My Agents are DMS, but they like working with agents from different Departments (as long as it&#39;s not Rosalie - shut up, Eledhwen muse). <br><br>It&#39;s mostly because I get some Suefics with bad slash, or Suefics with bad crossover tossed in, so getting help from specialists would be fantastic. Although for the Suefic with bad slash I think my Agents just winged it by themselves, since by the time they agreed to exorcise Sherlock and John they had already been busy killing the Sue. Or something.<br><br>This next mission of mine, for example, is a co-op between my Agents and my newly adopted Time Lord Agents for the DIC, so I basically can have my Suvian cake and eat the Bad Crossover one, too.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m collecting badfic from a large amount of fandoms, just to make sure that I don&#39;t get in a rut mission-wise.<br>Now that you mention it, I might just find out which of my two selected badfic types I&#39;m better at writing after a few missions, and then transfer my agent pair to that Department permanently once it&#39;s discovered and I find enough missionable badfics in the category I chose. Heck, the way my agents&#39; personalities are, they&#39;d see it as a promotion.<br><br>I&#39;ve been working on more characters for other Departments, but the majority of those seem to be more recurring side characters than anything at this point. I plan to have only a few main characters, at least at first, to help with independent characterization, and I didn&#39;t want to write two or three agent pairs for different Departments and then run the risk of abandoning one later once I find what direction my writing style works best in.</p>

            <p>Floaters are supposed to handle all <i>types</i> of missions, too—that&#39;s including but not limited to implausible crossovers, trans-dimensional hopping/snatching, bad slash, bad het, geographical aberrations, improbable AUs, trolls, bad parodies, technical errors, temporal offenses, and disturbing acts of violence. If you wanted to go old school and extend the floating thing all the way to its logical conclusion, you could make your Floaters circulate with the Infrastructure departments, too, as if the DF were a temp agency.<br><br>Actually, that&#39;s a good analogy: Floaters are like temps, getting assigned wherever there&#39;s a gap in the workforce. Sues are pretty well covered in the DMS, which has a freelance division for people who don&#39;t want to be restricted to one fandom, so IMO, the bulk of a Floater&#39;s missions ought to be in all those other areas I listed, <i>without</i> a Suvian as the primary problem. Anything else (again, IMO) is just a waste of the department&#39;s potential.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Looking back at what I found, only one can be classified as a Suefic only, and I&#39;ve been wanting to kill that one since I found out it existed. Still, it&#39;s in a less-than-common fandom, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that implausible that it would be assigned to Floaters. I remember precedent for a mission being sent outside its Department because there weren&#39;t many people inside the Department it would be most relevant in who knew the canon well, though the PoorCynic mission &quot;A Night at the Movies&quot; is the only one I can remeber off the top of my head, and it was another Department assigning something to Mary Sue specialists, not the other way around.<br><br>There are Suvian entities in several of the other badfics I chose,  as you said, a lot of badfics have one at their core anyway. As for the others, I found crossovers, geographical aberrations, a few trolls, and two improbable AUs. I think I will be all right for a while without getting into a rut.<br><br>It would actually be pretty funny to have an interlude where their number came up for Infrastructure and they had to spend a few days helping out Building Maintenance, so I might use that idea at some point.</p>

            <p>Think about it. The first movie was basically the Hero&#39;s Journey IN SPACE, and it was well-enough made that lots of people liked it. It kicked around for a while, surviving the Christmas Special (if you don&#39;t know about the Star Wars Christmas Special, lucky you) and the conflicts in creating the next two movies. After it was all over, people did what comes naturally to them when they see something good: they start writing fan fiction. Then, someone gets their fanfiction published. &quot;Hey!&quot; says a random aspiring writer. &quot;I liked Star Wars! This might be just as good!&quot; So he reads it, decides he can do one better, and writes more, gets it published, presumably by the same desperate publishing house, and eventually the Thrawn trilogy happens (translated: a really influential series of Star Wars books that kicked off the Expanded Universe proper) and people started making all sorts of new stories in the Star Wars universe.<br><br>Every writer being separate and yet everything being linked up meant that people could make their own factions, build on each other&#39;s work, construct social systems based on terms the movies had only thrown out to avoid some minor plot problem, etcetera. Even the prequels couldn&#39;t dampen their style, because now they could just make new stories in the far-flung past about the early days of the Galactic Republic.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to claim I understand the Star Wars EU as it is, because it&#39;s complex, convoluted, and has so many loose ends it&#39;s frayed on all the edges. But, Star Wars was never really my beat anyway. <br><br>Fast forward to decades in the future, and Star Wars has the largest and most well-known Expanded Universe of basically any franchise, with hordes of fans working endlessly to assemble everything into a coherent timeline and a working picture of affairs in their galaxy. People can get involved at any point in time, write stories for any of its probably-pushing-a-thousand species and multiplicity of worlds, and build a little fortress on a sea of much cooler fortresses in the hope that someone else will come along and say &quot;Oh, I like the architecture of your fortress. I think I might take a few cues from you when building mine.&quot;<br><br>And then, J. J. Abrams happened. Yeeeaaahh. Not gonna pass judgement on that until I see what comes out, but the guy hasn&#39;t really shown proper respect for established canon and common sense before, and so I can be forgiven for bracing myself rather than waiting excitedly. I know that the new movies wouldn&#39;t actually be about the Expanded Universe, because it&#39;s still fanfiction and not even Disney would make a movie based on a series of fan works, but some people would be likely to work in the gaps, or make something that causes only a fraction of the older stories to be mutually exclusive to the new timeline. J. J. Abrams does not strike me as one of those people. At all.</p>

Anyway...)<br><br>Since no one else seems to have asked yet, here are some standard questions:<br><br>1. Have you read the Original Series?<br><br>2. Have you read the Constitution?<br><br>3. Do you plan on eventually getting Permission and writing agents?<br><br>4. Who&#39;s the friend who introduced you to the PPC? (ok, that&#39;s mostly curiosity...)<br><br>5. Most importantly, what are your thoughts on the color orange?<br><br>And for a Welcome gift I give you...a miniature lightsaber! I seem to be handing them out (in honor of May the 4th, which...was yesterday, but still). Also, my customary gift of Swiss Bleepolate: the high-grade chocolate provides a distraction while the bleeprin gets to work erasing the horrific details of whatever you&#39;ve just read/seen. Plus, it tastes better. Also, since it seems you like Naruto, have a...bother, what&#39;ve I got from that fandom...um, here! Box of ramen :) Some badfic had Naruto leave before he ate it, which ended up as a charge...but the ramen was, uh, confiscated anyway. Several boxes of it were confiscated, actually, but...the agents got tired of eating it fairly quickly, so...<br><br>Ok, looks like I&#39;m babbling. Sorry about that. I have a cold, and it feels early to me (even though it&#39;s noon...go figure). Hope you enjoy being a Boarder!<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I remember it being mentioned in the ask-an-agent questions the Other Board had a while ago, but when I looked back at the RP where it was first mentioned, the only mentions I found of what it was and did said that it regenerated itself, it was brought from the future, and it attached to skin and augmented it somehow.<br>What is it for?

            <p>Well, you already know my opinion on OFUDisc, although it&#39;s probably worth repeating - I&#39;m really enjoying the story, and looking forward to reading the rest of it and finding out where some of those plotlines are going.<br><br>As for the Trousers of Time, I thought it was a pretty cool piece, and I especially liked how excited the unnamed Floaters agent was at the thought that there would be news from the future of how great they were, only to be cut off by the Sunflower Official like that. I really like your portrayal of the SO here - he seems to have a touch of menace to him, as if he&#39;d be willing to go to any lengths to stop the Department of Efficiency from coming about. <br><br>However, that timeline chart you produced is <i>far</i> too simple for my tastes :P<br><br>I&#39;m tempted to write something up involving my agents getting caught up in a pre-Trousers Sundering - after all, it&#39;s a pretty common theme in stuff involving time travel/prophecies for the very actions taken to avoid some event actually setting them up.<br></p>

            <p>Sadly, I haven&#39;t had a chance to read the OFUDisc story, yet, so I can&#39;t comment on that.<br><br>However, I did get to read End of the Beginning.  Though short, it is quite interesting and kind of a refreshing take on the whole time-travel/future information thing.  It is nice to see characters who, rather than being secretive with the information and trying to enact the necessary changes subtly, are upfront about what they are doing and why they are doing it.  &quot;We have information that X is going to happen if we do nothing.  We are taking Y action to prevent it.  End of story.  Go about your business.&quot;  The usual cloak and dagger approach just ends with no one being able to learn from the other timelines&#39; mistakes because they don&#39;t know that mistakes were made.<br><br>So, yeah, I liked the story.  Well done.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ve been working on a future-AU for a little while now.  So that chart you posted further down the thread is going to be outdated soon.

            <p>Okay, looking back at what I wrote, there are big spoilers in here, probably. Not much of this is said beyond exposition in the End of the Beginning itself, but it&#39;s worth noting since the vague question means that I can go on at length about continuity, which I love.<br><br>I&#39;m not entirely certain how it started, but it&#39;s essentially a continuation of the histories of the Protectors that Huinesoron and some older, now-inactive writers made back around 2006 or so. The End of the Beginning builds off of the Ten Years Hence idea that writers of early and/or influential spin-offs liked to do to show their agents in new periods of time as older and occasionally wiser versions of themselves for character purposes. Huinesoron uses the format to create a theoretical future that would map out the families of the characters from his old DOGA spin-off. I&#39;m not entirely sure how the idea for the Department of Efficiency came about, but it provided a founding reason to change up the possible future in a big way so that it wasn&#39;t just a story about brief moments in the lives of characters we&#39;ve rarely if ever seen before.<br><br>Now, DE history and potential spoilers follow: a group of Floaters headed by an obscure Flower known as the Foxglove(not to be confused with the Foxglove Official of the All-Purpose Department in the same way that the Marquis de Sod is not to be confused with the Daisy) decided to create a way to increase the productivity of the PPC; it was a fine idea at first, but the DE began to abuse its power, imposing mandatory and occasionally arbitrary rules on most of the organization in the name of efficiency, but in effect using their semi-monopolistic power as a handhold to seize control of the Protectors.<br><br>Eventually, the Department of Efficiency allied with a resurrected version of the Department of Author Correspondence, one of the dead Departments from the early spin-offs, which quickly became the corrupt and sadistic Department of Author Correction, headed by the Cherry Tree(who had/has not been seen before or since, by the way), and Something Bad Happened. It&#39;s not been shown what it was, but it involved the capture and torture of people from World One on the order of the Cherry Tree and supported by the DE.<br><br>The Crocus, Head of the old-spin-off-era Department of Author Correspondence(which had basically been DMS-light, for reference) now Head of Operations, teamed up with the Sub Rosa, the Last of the Firstborn, and started a war against the DE-sympathizing Flowers. The DAC was driven out, and the DE was almost completely purged, but since the latter had ingrained itself in just about every aspect of PPC workings by the time of the war, its destruction caused several Departments to split into factions, while the Protectors developed extensive rivalries with other groups, leading the grounds for the factions and Departments going separate ways.<br><br>The Sub Rosa resigned, and she, her surviving sympathizers(no word on whether the Crocus survived as well), and an unknown number of followers retreated elsewhere in the multiverse, leading to all but a select group of the fragmented PPC to abandon HQ. As to what the Sundering is, it could be either the Flower-versus-Flower civil war, the fragmentation of the Department cohesiveness, or the abandonment of HQ; I&#39;m not sure which.<br><br>The last story, the Seventy Years on period, deals with the Paladins, an alliance of former factions of DMS, DBS, and DOGA, and the Rangers, the remnants of Intel. They had decided during the unrecorded time span to team up and kill Sues like their ancestors did, and this led to the Time Will Decide For Us story, which isn&#39;t finished, and the Door To The Future RP, which pollinated the Twisted Skein Alternate Multiverse(actually, since the Twisted Skein hosts two alternate multiverses, I&#39;ll just call it the Sundering alternate multiverse after this post) with the undesignated &quot;prime&quot; multiverse, giving the former some of the lost technology of the latter and, as of Trousers of Time, preventing the latter from effectively becoming the former.<br><br>Actually I&#39;m excited about the new development and the full-on confirmation that the Sundering took place in an alternate multiverse. Now that the world that underwent the Sundering is no longer &quot;the real future&quot;, it&#39;s not going to be the bare-bones world it made itself to keep from stepping on the toes of future writers. That means we can write in the Seventy Years on time period now! Again, I&#39;m excited. I&#39;ve got some good ideas on some other factions and such, and there&#39;s a plot thread that hasn&#39;t been touched since 2008(real time, not AU time) that I&#39;ve been dying to pick up ever since I found out about it.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t remember the specifics, to be honest (this was about four years ago), and may be oversimplifying, but there was indeed a rash of people going on about how hS was the high and mighty new owner of the PPC due to how much he was writing at the time and how much everybody got behind it all. The logic somehow switched from &quot;hS writes something -&gt; everybody likes it -&gt; it&#39;s a thing&quot; to &quot;hS writes something -&gt; it is law; we must obey.&quot; So, when people started making uber-powerful, super-serious agents and writing ever-darker, grimmer, squickier missions, supposedly inspired by hS&#39;s stuff, some of them rather objected to being told that&#39;s not what we&#39;re actually about, and then the finger-pointing and insults started.<br><br>This was around the same time we started making the various FAQs and Guides to the PPC.<br><br>So yeah, people assuming they have to do things just because hS writes stuff leads to the Dark Side of the Board. Learn from history and don&#39;t start that again, and I won&#39;t have to deliver another lecture. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Doesn&#39;t this have the same application as everyone&#39;s missions working a little differently? I mean, if I see someone have the a/ns be edible, I can use that, but I can also have them nearly take my agents&#39; heads off. It&#39;s my choice. The main framework is that the agents need to gather charges, witness the major ones, and kill the Sue at the end (if we&#39;re talking about the DMS). And their RC can be very plain and only one room, or it can be a suite; the consistent part is that there has to be a console that alerts them when they get new missions or messages. Within that, I can make up whatever I like, as long as it works and doesn&#39;t go against the general PPC canon. And, following from that, if hS writes something I happen to like, I can reference it, or have my agents be around during the same events; but I can also forget it happened, or assume it happened in a different dimensional part of HQ, or even just assume it&#39;s an AU. In fact, I might not even know about it, and my writing may reflect that! No one&#39;s stories bind anyone else to following their exact rules. We even write variations on TOS--in fact, that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re about! We take the general idea and a lot of the concepts from Jay and Acacia, and adapt it and tweak it to suit what we want to tell. And as long as we don&#39;t, for instance, make the SO ridiculously OOC and make HQ easy to navigate even if you *do* notice (I totally want to write a conspiracy theory story where the SO is a collective hallucination, or something now...), we&#39;re fine; we&#39;re still writing PPC stories. Just because my agents use a Crash Dummy when Jay and Acacia didn&#39;t doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m not allowed to do that! Ok, time to wind down the rant.<br><br>I guess I just don&#39;t quite understand why people would have this viewpoint--ok, I understand *why*, but it doesn&#39;t fit with the rest of the PPC. I think it&#39;s even in the How-to for mission-writing that you can adapt as you wish (you know, within limits). It just...doesn&#39;t really work.<br><br>Ok. Rant over now.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you made the FAQs and Guides. They&#39;re very helpful, and pretty clear.<br><br>(Dark Side of the Board. XD )<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>There are two main ones, the &quot;all worlds are almost identical until something major happens&quot; model, and the &quot;the universes were never very similar, but they may have looked that way from a certain point of view&quot; model.<br><br>In the former, famously used in Michael Crichton&#39;s book <i>Timeline</i>, any action in a universe that parallels another universe will cause a similar and/or equal action in<br>its parallels. In that model, the Agent DawnFire has bring in the Teselecta would coincide with another Agent in the Sundering Alternate Multiverse bringing in a Teselecta. Since there hadn&#39;t been a big enough split to distance the two universes from each other, both would allow the same event to occur from the same cause, though admittedly some of the details would be different because of quantum singularity and probabilistic matters.<br><br>In the latter, everything is genuinely different in each timestream. Chaos in decisions, motions, and chances has made it so that no event can be duplicated, and while similar events can occur, nothing can ever be exactly the same, with the same reason, and creating the same reaction, in two separate timestreams. In some streams, not much may appear to be different on the surface from another similar stream, because raw chance has caused an alignment of moments in a way that allows all of the important players to retain the same positions. Still, anything can change at any time. Universes following this model often have notoriously mutable timelines, since the appearance of a person in the past can have far-reaching ripple effects rather than having that person&#39;s time travel become part of a predestination cycle as the more rigid <i>Timeline</i>-style multiverse system would do.<br><br>Likewise, if the descendant of your two Assassins had found the Paladins, she would have found it in either universe, regardless of whether or not it was an AU, but the number of instances of that descendant that found the Paladins and the number of instances of Paladins that would exist to be found would vary depending on the type of simultaneity that&#39;s used.<br><br>... I like to talk about this sort of thing. Time travel, alternate universes, dimensional models... I can go on and on sometimes. A little late for the heads-up but... yeah.<br><br>I&#39;m actually planning on writing a story set in the Mirror Multiverse, and the hinges of the plot are going to depend on which one of those is used for the PPC&#39;s multiverse format. I can make it work either way, but if it could be either, it would be a mess trying to make it fit both ways.</p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Timelines.png"><br><br>Basically, as I understand/envision it, the PPC uses a &#39;splitting&#39; model. It&#39;s not that the universes were almost identical - they were <i>the same world</i> until &#39;something major happens&#39;. That&#39;s not quite the <i>Timeline</i> model, which as you say explicitly drops everything into a parallel universe.<br><br>On the chart, the space between 2012 (Door to the Future) and 2025 (Trousers of Time) is technically incorrect. The universes <i>split</i> in 2012, as soon as the Door opened. However, the <i>effects</i> of that split were limited to the Sub Rosa writing a report, and a handful of agents playing with an Exonet, until 2025. Hence my drawing it the way I did.<br><br>As to how time and universe travel intersects with all this... there are three colours of arrow on there. Blue arrows represent intersections between versions of the PPC. They don&#39;t appear to cause AUs, at least most of the time.<br><br>Secondly, the red arrows. These are the time travel used by the Illian family and their friends. The Sheaf of Worlds was very careful to come up with something that <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> create AUs. So every red arrow simply creates a closed loop - when Jasmine went back to join the Black Cats, she did so because she had already done so.<br><br>The single green arrow is portal-based time travel. (Yes, it&#39;s marked as coming from an AU - that&#39;s because the prime universe really should stay in the centre, despite being technically a derived universe now). When something went wrong in the future and dropped a handful of Paladins and Technomancers into 2012, <i>that</i> created an AU. That&#39;s something that didn&#39;t happen in the universe of the Paladins - only in ours.<br><br>As to the effect other forms of time travel would have - I&#39;d say that&#39;s up to whoever writes it first.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Considering that a portion of IAHF2&#39;s last arc deals with the Mirror Multiverse and all I should probably be used to confusing, but yeah.<br>I think the IAHF stuff falls under the &#39;every change to the past creates an alternate timeline&#39; school of thinking when it comes to alternate timelines, so the main characters managed to create an Alternate Venice when they went back in time, and eventually with enough travel the alternate timelines would just kinda bleed over into a Mirror Multiverse setting where the very foundation of the universe is set in reverse. <br><br>Not sure how I&#39;d plotted to resolve the damn thing, though; this was done about a year ago.

            <p>I&#39;ve not seen any Mirror Multiverse stories, aside from Tawaki&#39;s &quot;Oh bother, I guess we&#39;re in another multiverse, guys.&quot; one, and it was, in case you couldn&#39;t tell from how I described it, pretty underwhelming. Plus, I read the thing twice and I&#39;m still not sure how Tawaki&#39;s characters actually got there. The closest thing to an explanation I could put together was that alt-Makes-Things decided to switch their minds with those of their Mirror Multiverse counterparts using a machine to create sleeper agents for an invasion, but he for some reason didn&#39;t tell the agents whose minds would control the intended sleepers beforehand.<br>That makes <u>no</u> sense.<br><br>So, in short, I&#39;d like to see a story taking place in the Mirror Multiverse that can actually tell me something new about the Mirror Multiverse. It would help if I knew some precedent before writing events there.</p>

I can only assume they were let in because of some purpose that I&#39;d plotted down a year or so ago and forgotten ever since. </p>

            <p>So this makes, let&#39;s see... three alternate timestreams now. Arthurverse, Twisted Skein, and the Shipverse world that Luxury came from.<br>Of course, there&#39;s also the AU PPCs like the Transcanonical Defence Authority based on steampunk and the version simply called called The Organization that was based on Magical Girl anime, but there are a lot of those and they have varying levels of connection to the prime multiverse, so they aren&#39;t as major. I may need to make some sort of chart for this.<br>What was MAXinsanity&#39;s point that made you write Trousers of Time? I&#39;m curious.<br><br>When the main PPC universe split from the Twisted Skein multiverse, does it retain the ability to interact with it, or can the alternate multiverses only fully connect to other versions that share similar pasts to theirs?<br>Wait, if the latter is true, then perhaps the reason the Mirror Multiverse is difficult, but not impossible, to contact is because it shares a past with the PPC that is now utterly divorced from its own present and future. Hmmm. Plotbunnies breeding.<br><br>Oh, and I liked the new OFUDisc chapter, too! Well, chapter<i>s</i>, because I hadn&#39;t read any new ones for a while for whatever reason.<br>I&#39;m not entirely sure why the leader of a transdimensional organization would disguise herself as an fangirl to enter the University if she thought it was an elf-harming society, though. Maybe it&#39;s foreshadowing something.<br>For a short while in Chapter 9, I thought there would be the first sign of an invading force of some sort, but nope, just the one ship with a talking platypus. I might want to read the ISPACE story to get some context on that, but then again, it&#39;s funnier without any.<br><br>If you&#39;re still operating the Mini-Luggage Adoption Centre, would I be able to adopt Hexxx?</p>

            <p>Mary-Sues, and Gary Stues are typically hominid.

            <p>Here&#39;s the thing: Sues and the like are above psychology and basic rules.

            <p>A Sue&#39;s influence affects any entity within their story, or in the case of certain powerful Sues and Higher-order Sue-wraiths, even the Agents that try to kill them. A non-human psychology would hardly slow them down; in fact, since a large variety of non-humans are Sue Lust Objects, the Aura of Smooth might not even need to account for the difference.<br><br>As for foresight, you assume that most breeds of Sue would display any in the first place. They&#39;re incredibly reactionary creatures, and it&#39;s rare that one even plans to run away or plan an attack. Plus, like MAXinsanity said, exposure to any species or continuum could generate Sues affecting that continuum, that species, etcetera.<br>They develop quickly, because the Assassins kill so many of them.

            <p>Play-by-post RPG&#39;s are basically internet web boards. The role players make different characters and different posts for different sections, and then just rally the story back and forth. <br><br>For example, in a play-by-post, you play a character. Writing the story is like a joint story- you write the story from your characters perspective and they write theirs, and you both decide about external plot/conflict. Does that make sense? It&#39;s kind of like doing a play through the internet, and writing it while you&#39;re doing it, except it&#39;s in story form, so you&#39;re examining inner thoughts as well. <br><br>At least, that&#39;s what my experience has been.  </p>

            <p>And most play-by-post RPs are indeed story-based. A former PPCer ran one a while back, at an academy for Mary Stus; basically, as said below, one person sets the scene - depending on the rules, this could be an empty scene, a prompt, done by a mod, or one of the characters doing something. Then somebody else posts a response on that thread, generally another character interacting somehow either with the scene or the original poster. And so on, and so on, adding characters (or not) until the scene is ended.<br><br>It can also be done by chatroom, which tends to be a much faster mode of play, but by the same sort of rules. The general thing to keep in mind is that the game is not run by points, but by story. It can be far better for your character to <i>lose</i> fights than win them, because what you want is character development, not high stats.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure what thread I should have hijacked to ask questions, so I just picked a recent response by you to attach this to.<br><br>After relocating one possible Permission piece, scrapping another, and merging two into a story that was going to be too long, I&#39;ve got an idea for a viable Permission story.<br>However, there are Intelligence agents in it, and I don&#39;t know a lot about their Department. Since it seems you&#39;ve adopted Intel, you&#39;d be the most likely person to have high-quality information about it. So...<br><br><br>How they are visually distinguished from Agents in other Departments? I know they have a flash patch, but those tend not to be that prominent, and the character I was planning on having encounter the PPC Agents wouldn&#39;t know about Intel, or any other Department, at first. Is there anything in particular that the Intelligence Agents tend to have in common, so that they could be picked out from a group?<br><br>How can one tell which colored team an Intel agent is on? Is there an armband or a team uniform or something of the sort?<br><br>Furthermore, does each team deal with a specific duty, and how are Agents assigned to their team?<br><br>Divisions are briefly mentioned in a few of the reports. How many are there, and what does each deal with? (This one doesn&#39;t play into my story; I was just curious about it.)</p>

            <p>*Cracks knuckles* Okay, here&#39;s the lowdown.<br><br>Visually speaking, the only thing that distinguishes Intel agents from the rest of the group would be their flash patches. When on duty, they&#39;re usually wearing a canon-appropriate disguise and acting like a background character (if background characters have a tendency to follow a Suvian around while making gagging noises and swallowing copious amounts of Bleeprin, that is). <br><br>As for my own headcanon, Intel agents are often quite discreet, meaning that you have to actively <i>look</i> for them in a crowd. It&#39;s a habit formed from actively hiding from Suvians, monsters, and canons, wot. They also tend to have more self-restraint than other agents, given the fact that Spies are forbidden to muck with the Suvian when on an Intel run. <br><br>Colour teams are just a method of organizing Spies, so no armbands or anything. They are randomly plonked into a team by the Department of  Personnel.<br><br>There are three duties to perform in Intelligence: sorting badfic in the Sorting Room, assigning fics to agent teams (done from a Spy&#39;s own RC), and Action duty (where the Spy goes to a cubicle in the Action Room and waits to be assigned a fic to investigate). There are six teams in Intel, and each is rotated in and out of each duty on a daily basis.<br><br>The cycle consists of four straight days of Sorting, one day of Assignment, and one day of Action before the cycle repeats.<br><br>Infrastructure agents work in shifts, so there is a &quot;nine-to-five&quot; feel to their job than Action Department agents who are &quot;on call&quot; 24/7 (or whatever time distortion HQ uses). Each colour team has a day shift and a night shift so that an entire team just doesn&#39;t walk out at the same time. <br><br>As for your last question, most Intel divisions were rendered obsolete with the shift to the colour-team system. Technically speaking, the only divisions that are left would be the DoI&#39;s administrative staff and the folks down at the supply depot that&#39;s connected to the Hub. <br><br>I hope this helps! Don&#39;t hesitate to ask more questions, I can go on forever about Intel n&#39;stuff. </p>

            <p>The times of the various RPGs do happen regularly - just with a unit of time measured only on a planet orbiting a massive plothole, so time gets a bit wibbly-wobbly there.<br><br>In seriousness, they basically pop up whenever someone has an idea.

            <p>There aren&#39;t any set times for them, nor set topics. If you have an RP idea, I&#39;d suggest broaching it to the Board in general, say, a day or so before you start it, just to let people know and figure out if they want to join. Also, Board RPs are odd beasts when it comes to general PPC canon. For example, the most recent one with the Blackout/Meatloaf Monster named Slorp has actually been integrated into several Agents&#39; personal canons, so I think it&#39;s been generally accepted as a Thing That Happened. Not all RPs are, though.<br><br>Oh, and if you have any non-PPC-related RP wants/needs, feel free to ask. I personally do a lot of <i>Supernatural</i>-based RPs myself, but I&#39;m sure there are people who would be willing to do other fandoms as well.</p>

            <p>Ok, ok, sorry. I know Gilbert &amp; Sullivan wasn&#39;t a part of everyone else&#39;s childhood like it was of mine; same with Shakespeare. I shouldn&#39;t assume that everyone automatically knows G &amp; S.<br><br>Gilbert &amp; Sullivan were a writer and composer who collaborated famously in the Victorian Era. They wrote amazing operas, among the Iolanthe (which has been performed by the PPC, according to one of Tawaki&#39;s missions), Pirates of Penzance, HMS Pinafore, The Mikado, and...hm, what&#39;s another well-known one...actually, those may be the best-known ones. They often satirized political figures, and sometimes situations, as well as society and a lot of other things. They were very well-known, and very well-liked, and, actually, still are today, albeit in a rather smaller circle than they had in the Victorian Era (at least, that&#39;s what it seems like. If someone wants to prove me wrong, they&#39;re quite welcome to).<br><br>Basically, I love them. They&#39;re a large part of my childhood--my grandmother sings in operas and musicals, including G&amp;S (and My Fair Lady, I got to see that one, it was awesome), and my parents bought some of the music (and my grandmother sent more of the music) and they also bought me a wonderful book called The Complete Annotated Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, which is wonderful and has all sorts of notes on their process, the critiques they received, what they were satirizing, and various performance gags. It&#39;s a really great book :)<br><br>Does that help?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Hi everyone!<br><br>As some of you* may know, a new Creative Curse has been discovered, and is in the process of passing into use**. It was first mentioned in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=242747;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a> post, and jumped on in the subsequent replies. It comes from the <i>Star Trek</i> movie <i>Nemesis</i>, and is &quot;Picard in a dune buggy&quot; (there&#39;s a picture in the linked post). From what Hermione of Vulcan said (paraphrased), more time is spent on on Picard in a dune buggy than the potentially good plot. <br><br>(In the spirit of the Multiverse Monitor: <i>&quot;The dune buggy is just the most egregious example of spending too much time on special effects and not enough on characterization and, well, plot,&quot; wrote Hermione of Vulcan in her original post on the Board.</i> ((And, less in the spirit of the MM and more in the spirit of, shall we say, Shakespeare:)) <i>&quot;&#39;Picard in a dune buggy&#39;?&quot; quoth DawnFire thereafter. &quot;Is that joining the list of Creative Curses? Because I&#39;d use that. We need some Trek ones.&quot; And, following that, Outhra said--well, something that is best seen in its <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=242803;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">entirety</a>.</i>)<br><br>So, what say you? Shall &quot;Picard in a dune buggy&quot; join the PPC&#39;s list of Creative Curses? Let all in favor raise their hands into the air and shout &quot;Aye!&quot; or a variant thereon!<br><br>~DawnFire<br><br>*Alright, probably just Hermione of Vulcan, Outhra, and I, unless you&#39;ve been reading our posts and not replying.<br><br>**Ie, on last count, Hermione and I are both planning on using it, and Outhra supports it.</p>

            <p>My question is: is this really something that should be decided by committee? I think, and I could be wrong, but I think that most of what else is on that list got there because of actual popularity in usage. Like, if you go through LotR missions, you&#39;re going to find some &quot;Flaming Denethor!&quot;s and &quot;Glaurung!&quot;s in more than a few. They&#39;re not listed arbitrarily.<br><br>Heck, I&#39;m not even sure &quot;Thranduil on a moose!&quot; deserves to be up there, and it was my idea. So... maybe see if people actually like this enough to use it <i>in stories</i>, then talk about putting it on the wiki?<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. If you&#39;re looking for good, serviceable Trekverse curses, why not <s>Zoidberg</s> Klingon? I know for a fact Trekkie agents have used Klingon expletives before.</p>

            <p>Sorry I didn&#39;t make that clear.

For example, <i>jiSaHbe&#39;</i> (roughly pronounced ji-SHAKH-be) means &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot;, while <i>jiSaHbe&#39; jay&#39;</i> is &quot;I don&#39;t [bleep]ing care&quot; or, more loosely translated, &quot;I don&#39;t give a [bleep]!&quot;<br><br>Certainly, you can consult me.

            <p>Maybe we can go with, once it&#39;s been in at least one mission, or enough people are using it on the Board, it gets added? I tried the committee way because it seemed like a logical idea, but I don&#39;t think I was a Boarder when the last Creative Curses came into use (hence this).<br><br>As to Klingon...I&#39;m writing a Klingon agent, so he&#39;ll most likely swear in Klingonese at some point.

            <p>I don&#39;t think a use in just one mission counts as popularity, but general Board and/or mission use, or extensive use by just one person (e.g., I think it was just Tawaki who used &quot;Jadis in a block of ice!&quot; a lot), that would count.

            <p>The wiki definitely raises awareness. {= ) It&#39;s kind of a double-edged sword, though, since it can raise awareness of <i>anything</i>, whether it deserves awareness or not. That&#39;s actually one reason I created the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category%3ANo_Links">No Links</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category%3ASource_Needed">Source Needed</a> categories. Especially in No Links, there are a lot of instances of people adding agents they <i>planed</i> to use, and then never got around to for whatever reason, leaving behind dead-end articles destined to frustrate anyone who comes across them. Source Needed is about helping people find where specific ideas come from, and also to discourage people from making stuff up and playing it off as &quot;official&quot; just because it&#39;s on the wiki.<br><br>To be fair, most of the Source Needed stuff and even some of the No Links articles probably can be substantiated; I just don&#39;t always know where to go looking.

            <p>That makes a lot of sense, if you found it in an English-Yiddish dictionary--the word is Hebrew, but it would be pronounced differently in Yiddish, although it kind of looks like you know that. And I think there would be some Yiddish speakers who would pronounce it as &#39;neshomeh&#39;; it certainly sounds right in my head.<br><br>Seriously? Oh, wow. That sounds...interesting. I may even have read that mission--let me check. Yes, I have. I just don&#39;t remember much about the Sue herself.

            <p>Sorry I didn&#39;t reply, but yes, the application is accepted. Geordi has a luster! Yay for Geordi. Of course, he&#39;ll be disappointed that she knows so little about TNG, but still, Geordi is the Gimli of TNG - friends with the most popular Lust Object, but shunted off whenever the Sue wants to be with them.  </p>

            <p>Just wanted to be sure, since I didn&#39;t get that reply :)<br><br>Really? But--but the actor&#39;s reasonably attractive, and he&#39;s got the VISOR for a Cool Factor, and--and--no, doesn&#39;t compute that he wouldn&#39;t have many lusters. I mean, I like Data, Data&#39;s cool, but...Geordi&#39;s also pretty cool...and...well, actually, together they make for an interesting team, but I don&#39;t see why Geordi has so few lusters. Do you have an explanation for this phenomenon? I&#39;m honestly kind of baffled by it.<br><br>On the other hand, maybe Data just gets more character development?<br><br>As for the lack of TNG knowledge, meh. She can learn. I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be happy to spend some time marathoning TNG; I&#39;d do that if I had the time and energy and had already finished TOS (yes, yes, I know. I&#39;m at the end of the third season. I&#39;m a terrible fan, I know. Go away.) (Maybe at some point she misses class to marathon TNG and is found on a sugar-and-lack-of-sleep high several days later? And then all she does is babble about canon facts and all sorts of things about the plot and the characters and all the ships she now, er, ships? I don&#39;t know. Your choice, obviously. You&#39;re the author).<br><br>But, Picard on a dune buggy, this was fun to write. I know I&#39;ve said that several times already, but it was seriously fun to write. Mostly because I kept putting in references to the actual story and giggling at it.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>On FFN, there are 20 stories filtered through Geordi and romance. (This is out of 3,000+ TNG stories) Of these:<br>10 of them are Data/Geordi<br>3 are slash with characters I don&#39;t recognize, possibly one episode characters (All of these are written by the same author)<br>2 are het with one shot characters<br>1 is a Data/OC/Geordi love triangle<br>And 2 are actually Geordi/OC.<br><br>In contrast, there are 109 stories filtered through Data and romance. Of these:<br>26 are Data/Yar<br>10 are Data/Geordi<br>This means roughly 64 are minority pairings (e.g. Data/Troi) and Data/OC. Even half of that is 32 Data/OC fics.<br><br>So, it seems to be true. The only theory I have is this: in initial drafts of the show, Geordi was gay, and perhaps some of that sneaked into his characterization and subtextually puts off lusters. <br><br>That feels like I&#39;m going out on a limb, but more than half of Geordi&#39;s romance fics are slash. Maybe I&#39;m actually onto something. (Or I&#39;m just biased because I sort of support Data/Geordi.)<br><br></p>

            <p>But, look, a character being gay doesn&#39;t exactly put off lusters.<br><br>I mean, have you ever taken a look at Glee fanfics? Admittedly, the characters there are openly gay on the show, but the fandom is full of slash pairings AND het pairings, and they don&#39;t really seem to care much about the sexual identity of the characters--Kurt, for instance, is paired with Blaine, Karofsky, Quinn, Rachel, and, in earlier days of the show, Finn--and that&#39;s only to name a few. Santana gets paired with plenty of people as well. I don&#39;t really know the status of OCs in that fandom, but if we ignore that...a character being gay doesn&#39;t really seem to put people off these days.<br><br>On the other hand, what do I know? I haven&#39;t even seen that much of TNG. I just remember thinking that Geordi&#39;s a pretty cool character, and he and Data amuse me when they have conversations. I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Although, can you explain to me the attraction to Data? Because the character is interesting, but I don&#39;t really think I&#39;d start writing romance fics with him in them. It just...doesn&#39;t quite work.<br><br>On the other hand, I may just have an older conception of what an android is? Most of my knowledge <i>is</i> from TOS...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Most Federation matters are dealt with in English after it became the dominant human language for some reason, but the other languages still exist. Captain Picard knows French, for instance. Even the other alien races have multiple languages sometimes, for that matter. I remember someone saying that Romulans had three languages, and the Xindi had at least two.<br><br>I&#39;ve never heard of a Federation Standard, but I&#39;d guess that if it&#39;s the diplomacy-based language its name implies that it is, it would probably be modified English to make it more convenient for alien speakers. That&#39;s just a guess, though, because like I said, I don&#39;t know where that term came from.</p>

            <p>Because, there are some characters who will always resort to &#39;Fudge&#39; (Only I didn&#39;t say <i>Fudge</i>. I said it. The Queen Mother of all dirty words. The F dash dash dash word... Sorry guys, I just realized that my &quot;A Christmas Story,&quot; paraphrase needs some work...) but there are other characters who will be more interesting.

            <p>Let&#39;s look at curses in the real world and the PPC.<br><br>Most popular, by far, are single syllable curses, most of which I won&#39;t reproduce here.  They are quick and easy to say.  Some cleaner choices would be &#39;Frak&#39;, &#39;Frell&#39;, or &#39;Shards&#39;, which are all used around here on occasion.<br><br>Then you have two syllable curses.  Still pretty easy to say without thinking.  &#39;Glaurung&#39; is a good example.  You can also add -ing to the end of many of the one syllable curses.<br><br>Three syllables works well, too.  &#39;Bocce Balls&#39; is one of my favorites from an episode Family Guy.  Not the most explicit, perhaps, but it got the point across.<br><br>The upper end, for me, is really about 5 syllables.  &#39;Flaming Denethor&#39; is something I could imagine someone actually shouting.<br><br>Looking at the list of Creative Curses on the Wiki, I am actually not sure how many of them would actually work if spoken out loud.  They tend to be long and cumbersome.  They might work, for some, when on a page, but curses were meant to be yelled/shouted/bellowed or otherwise shared with the neighborhood.<br><br>But that is just me.  Being in theatre, my expertise is in the spoken word, not the written.  In fact, I have to say everything I read or write in my head before it can make the transition between the page and my brain.  So, when I read something like that, I read it as it would be spoken, and something that is seven syllables long just doesn&#39;t work very well.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not going to claim to be an expert, but I have experience in the most effective ways to shout things, so I think I can weigh in here.<br><br>Most multi-syllable shouts and curses rise and fall in emphasis.

            <p>After saying &#39;Picard in a dune buggy&#39; and several other similar phrases out loud, I think I see what you&#39;re talking about. On the other hand, I&#39;m not really proposing that it should be used out loud; I&#39;m proposing that it should be used on a page, in-universe. I find that on a page it works quite well, and that it also works very well in my head (probably because I can think faster than I can speak). That coupled with the various properties of HQ means (in my mind, anyway) that the somewhat unlikely both works and is plausible. (Also, if we deny &#39;Picard on a dune buggy&#39; based on its length, then we should also deny phrases like &#39;Jadis in a block of ice&#39; and &#39;Radagast on a bunny sled&#39;, which, while newer than Flaming Denethor, have already passed into common use and are therefore rather difficult to remove.) Of course, this is my opinion, and that&#39;s yours...I guess we&#39;ll just have to see what everyone else thinks?<br><br>You&#39;ve made some very interesting points about swearing, though, so thanks for that :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I think it might have something to do with the fact that occasionally one&#39;s singing ability is considered a replacement for a character trait - basically instead of describing personality or whatever you get &#39;good singer!&#39;. So singing ability with other character traits is well and good, but the annoyingness crops up when it&#39;s their only character trait.<br><br>It might also have something to do with descriptions. If someone has a voice like bells or a flute or whatever, it&#39;s not fun to hear that noise distorted into English words.</p>

            <p>In that it&#39;s a combination between overall speshulness and Aura of Smooth.<br><br>The Aura of Smooth effect would probably manifest in the slavish devotion that canon characters suddenly manifest in the Sue after hearing her sing, which ties into the &quot;singing is speshul&quot; option very effectively.<br><br>In some cases, the psychic Sue-song can even cause possession in the canons, and I&#39;ve found one badfic where a character was completely replaced after hearing it. or, if they aren&#39;t posessed, the singing tends to be chgaracterized by urple prose or Suvian traits in canons.

The problem is, that&#39;s a mind-altering psychic power that most Agents need Glopsnerch or some sort of anti-psionics training to fend off properly.

            <p>They&#39;re PPC terms, not badfic terms, but if you read enough badfic, you tend to start picking it out. Once a character starts acting especially OOC after a certain point, it&#39;s safe to assume that, from the standpoint of the Protectors, a wraith or replacement just got involved. Within the fic itself, the badfic writer often doesn&#39;t know or care how OOC everyone is, so they don&#39;t talk about it.<br><br>If you were asking specifically about the &quot;singing made them more speshul and made the canons love them&quot;, well, it&#39;s basically up there with &quot;when their eyes first met, love happened&quot; and &quot;she was the most beautiful person he had ever seen&quot; in the list of top Mary Sue clichйs.

            <p>It made me a little uncomfortable, because I take pride in my singing voice (I&#39;m not great, but I can carry a tune without hurting people&#39;s ears) and don&#39;t like to see anyone mocked for being a good singer. <br><br>However, after giving it some thought, I&#39;ve come to a few conclusions.<br><br>1.

            <p>Well, I found a few instances of a Sue-wraith forcing a canon character to sing songs that they wouldn&#39;t in a voice that doesn&#39;t suit them because it belongs to a wraith, but that&#39;s not really what I was looking for.<br>It was short notice, but I&#39;ve got one mission in which the Sue-song is described as &quot;unpleasant and jarring&quot;, but it manages to enthrall a canon character beyond his previous Suefluenced state:<br><br><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ppcasterloreone/"><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ppcasterloreone/">https://sites.google.com/site/ppcasterloreone/</a></a><br><br>and one where an ex-God Mode Sue accidentally enthralls a large collection of unprotected agents using mind-altering Sue-song, showing that Sues are capable of producing the effects even when self-aware and that the effect isn&#39;t just restrained to canon characters.<br><br><a href="http://the-ppc.livejournal.com/49098.html"><a href="http://the-ppc.livejournal.com/49098.html">http://the-ppc.livejournal.com/49098.html</a></a><br><br>I might be able to find more if I had more specific search terms with which to locate them, but these are still examples nonetheless.<br><br>As for the &quot;you would probably need anti-psionic training to combat it&quot;, I admit that&#39;s speculation on my part, since the PPC doesn&#39;t have a lot of psionic agents for some reason and thus it would be hard to test. I&#39;ve seen Sue-song referred to as &quot;telepathically enhanced&quot; before, and built my statement off that combined with the fact that a psionically trained mind would be much less susceptible to external influence than an untrained one just as a matter of principle.</p>

            <p>we have <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/ramblingband.html">this</a> bit of Sue song:<br><br>&quot;As night finally fell, Laurel and her happy little band walked out onto the dais. Laurel was escorted by a blushing Frodo, obviously bespelled. Legolas met her eyes from across the room, looking painfully lovestruck. Laurel and the two men took their places together, and began to sing, a modern song (Led Zeppelin, if Jay had any guess.) <br><br>It......wasn&#39;t that good. Led Zeppelin just wasn&#39;t meant for the harp.&quot; <br></p>

            <p>&quot;Acacia made a face at the sound of the music. It wasn&#39;t even as if she had anything to drown it out- she had finally been forced to turn off the sound on her Analysis Device, or risk being deafened by its by-now-constant shrills. <br><br>As the music ended, all of the canon characters beamed at the band.

            <p>Well, wait, let me back this up. SCP is an online organization that creates things called SCP&#39;s. They are all based off this creepypasta found called <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-173">SCP 173</a> . That was it, nothing more. Then people thought, well, what else can we do with this.

            <p>And unfortunately I come bearing a Warcraft Sue known as <a href="http://lunastraszacrescent.deviantart.com/gallery/38420495?offset=24">Lunastrasza</a>.<br><br>Her crimes include being the Aspect of Light AND an uber-speshul daughter of Alexstrasza and Korialstrasz, being an incredibly violent and ill-tempered Red, shoving a tauren into a cage for talking about something she wasn&#39;t in the mood to discuss, calling Lor&#39;themar, Halduron, and Rommath her advisors, turning Lor&#39;themar into a slavering, awkward teenager, being married to Lor&#39;themar... the list goes on.<br><br>A tumblrbuddy put Lunastrasza through the Warcraft litmus test. She scored 179, apparently.</p>

            <p>I know nothing about World of Warcraft other than the most basic of basic information, so forgive me if this seems brusque, but are those six names you mentioned representative of what the entire naming system is? From my perspective, it looks like Kingdom Hearts and Boggle had a baby.<br><br>I suppose Halduron and Rommath aren&#39;t bad, especially not Halduron, but how is Alexstrasza even pronounced? a-LEX-trass-ZUH? No, that doesn&#39;t seem right, either. I haven&#39;t flinched that much from non-meshing consonants since the Eye of Argon&#39;s Mrifk, which still holds the record for least-effective consonant meshing because it&#39;s Eye of Argon and so of course it does.</p>

            <p>I just finished up with finals last week and they were a nightmare. For me, taking breaks to just chat or go out and eat a quick meal actually helped a lot. Switching between subjects whenever I felt too stressed over one exam was also pretty useful.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m the best person to give advice on handling stress though, I ended up pulling several all-nighters because I was too stressed to sleep xD</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t found any easy ways to completely get rid of stress,  but one thing that works to some extend is to have a cup of hot milk with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and honey before bed. It will help calm your stomach, lull you into a sleepy state of mind, and help you to get a restful night. <br>There is nothing worse than being kept up all night before a big exam.</p>

            <p>Mostly time management n&#39;stuff.<br><br>I usually go for one-hour study blocs separated up by fifteen-minute &quot;recesses.&quot; In those fifteen minutes, take some time to eat a snack, drink some water, go for a walk <s>and maybe browse YouTube for a fluffy kitten video</s>.<br><br>Avoid doing super-intense solo four-hour cramming sessions (they don&#39;t work, trust me).

            <p>I started watching an anime called <i>Kotoura-san</i> the other day. The main character, Kotoura, is a girl who can read minds. However, instead of making her Speshul and having her be loved for her talents, it shows a more realistic version and it&#39;s consequences. Kotoura ends up revealing the secrets of the people around her, causing her friends to hate her and her parents to get divorced. She ends up being labelled a monster for reading thoughts without permission, even though she can&#39;t block out the thoughts.<br><br>Anyway, this got me thinking... how many fandoms are there where a typically Sue-ish power, like mind reading or seeing the future, is shown in a more realistic manner, with all of the consequences as well as the benefits? <s>I&#39;ve been needing more fandoms, haha.</s></p>

            <p>Just two? Yes - otherwise I&#39;d be here forever.<br><br>1/ <i>The Dark is Rising</i> sequence by Susan Cooper. I know it&#39;s already been mentioned, but <i>these books are fantastically awesome</i>. If you read them (read them!), it&#39;s often best to skip <i>Over Sea, Under Stone</i> on first readthrough, or maybe read it just before <i>Greenwitch</i>. It&#39;s a somewhat different book to the rest, and <i>The Dark is Rising</i> itself serves as a better intro to the series.<br><br><i>When the Dark comes rising, Six shall turn it back<br>Three from the Circle, Three from the track<br>Wood, bronze, iron, water, fire, stone<br>Five will return - and one go alone...</i><br><br>-- oh, and I do mean read the books. <i>Do not watch the movie</i>. It is a horrible travesty.<br><br>2/ <i>Heroes</i>. Seriously, has no-one mentioned this yet? Back in 2006 this show was <i>the</i> show if you were on the internet. It&#39;s basically exactly what you said - superpowered people in the real world.<br><br>(On this topic - Series 1 is universally regarded as awesome. After that, Your Mileage May Vary)<br><br>... all right, three.<br><br>3/ The <i>Night Watch</i> series by Sergei Lukyanenko. Russian urban fantasy. If the translations are available where you are - I think there&#39;s a couple of versions, although obviously the ones I&#39;ve read are the best - they&#39;re worth tracking down. A bit dark in places, but amazing. Currently there&#39;s four books.<br><br>Oh, and two films. Can you guess what I&#39;m about to say?<br><br>Apparently the (Russian) producers looked at the books, said, &quot;They&#39;ve got vampires in? That makes them HORROR!&quot; and filmed it on that basis. That&#39;s... not what the books are. They&#39;re fantasy. So don&#39;t watch the films.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I would say Artemis Fowl, (has anyone read this), Artemis is a genius and has access to a huge amount of technology (almost Stuish in its awesomeness) he frequently feels the results of being a criminal mastermind, mostly in alienation from his friends and, well, not really having many (human) friends. <br>Skulduggery Pleasant (Great series, anyone read it?) I would hesitate to mention, as its heroine shows quite a few blatant Sue traits (beauty being commented on by evil villains, bad-ass, kick ass, so on)but a better portrayal of human emotions than most thrillers make up for it. Mostly. And who can resist a skeleton in a suit?</p>

            <p>Amazing books. I started reading them years ago, and read each new one as it came out (I think I started when there were four out).

            <p>Buffy Summers. The Chosen One. One girl in all the world (er, at the start of the series, anyway) with the power to...slay evil things. So sue me, I don&#39;t remember the speech. But still.<br><br>Buffy, as the Slayer, is stronger and faster than other humans, and is responsible for saving people from vampires, demons, and other things that go bump in the night. Sound Sueish? Meet Joss Whedon. He&#39;s the one who wrote it. Sueish...doesn&#39;t really happen.<br><br>The show Buffy the Vampire Slayer deals with all sorts of--wow, did I actually forget to recommend every superhero show ever? Ok, I&#39;ll get there in a minute. BtVS deals with all sorts of plots and subplots about responsibility, growing up, magic, and being a hero. It&#39;s an amazing show, with ups and downs, and has an entire host of wonderful characters. I highly recommend it.<br><br>Also, in terms of superheroes: for the moment, I&#39;m just going to recommend the Avengers movie and its prequels because, well, it has the potential to be filled with Stus and Sues. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really feel like analyzing it right now, but...it&#39;s very good. And there&#39;s character development. And I don&#39;t think that, in all six or so movies (I think it&#39;s six? I&#39;m estimating), I&#39;ve ever felt like I was watching someone who wasn&#39;t human, who didn&#39;t have flaws and motivations, who wasn&#39;t a well-rounded character. Then again, they have decades of history to draw on, so I should hope they&#39;d be well-rounded characters by now.<br><br>Another series (of movies and otherwise) to look at would be X-men. Seriously, it&#39;s about two groups of mutants who have different views towards regular humans. And all of them have superhuman powers. It&#39;s pretty much the definition of potential Sues and Stus. And yet, for the most part, it&#39;s handled quite well (I&#39;m not an expert. I&#39;ve seen maybe two or three movies in the fandom. On the other hand, I loved both of them). I think it&#39;s worth a look.<br><br>And with that, I shall leave you for now...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Well, there&#39;s the Dark is Rising Sequence by Susan Cooper, which has as a main character (well, sort of-- he&#39;s only introduced in the second book) a boy called Will who finds out on his eleventh birthday that he&#39;s the last of the Old Ones, immortal, time-travelling beings with various other powers, and that he must complete the Circle to help the Light drive back the Dark at its final Rising. (Oh, and it was written at least a decade before Harry Potter was conceived.) But anyways, obviously he has very much Stuish potential, but Susan Cooper handles it all so very marvelously... Her writing&#39;s as rich and delicious as high-quality dark chocolate, and it has a sort of etheral, otherworldly quality while still being completely believable. <i>No one</i>  can write time-travel like her, and she&#39;s my second-favorite author ever after JRR Tolkien. But, well, I could go on forever about her and her books, so I shall shut up now.<br><br>Next, I wish to recommend <i>The Books of Pellinor</i> by Alison Croggon. They <i>are</i> rather heavily influenced by Ardaverse, perhaps more so than necessary, especially in the first book, but I still enjoyed them a lot. The main character, Maerad (Although... Well, no. Spoilers.) has a very large potential for Canon Sueness, but I think her ridiculous amount of power and Chosen One-ness was handled very well, down to most people being very afraid of her. And she makes mistakes. A lot of them. To the point of killing someone when they were just trying to stun her and she knew it, though she denied that afterwards. Another thing she does is lose three fingers to frostbite. How often do you see <b>that</b> happen to the hero?<br><br>Thirdly, The Enchanted Foest Chronicles by Patricia C Wrede. Like Chrestomanci mentioned below (and I&#39;ll vouch for that series, too), it&#39;s written for younger readers, but it&#39;s definiely worth the short amount of time it&#39;ll take to read. Just-- Morwen is awesome. Cimorene is awesome. Kazul is awesome. For that matter, <i>every single</i> female character is awesome. A lot of the male ones too, for that matter. Especially Telemain, Mendanbar and that snarky gargoyle. And wizards steal magic, but can be defeated by a hilarious, unconventional means that makes perfect sense in a completely backwards way. Not to mention the <i>constant</i> poking-of-fun-at-fairy-tales.<br><br>And finally, one of my friends recently got me into Neil Gaiman&#39;s <i>The Sandman</i> comics, which I finished the last of on Saturday. They&#39;re pretty much a new obsession for me, and I <i>never</i> read graphic novels. Period. And then I opened <i>Preludes and Nocturnes</i>... It focuses on Dream, one of the seven Endless, who, from eldest to youngest, are as follows: Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction-who-quit, Desire, Despair, and Delirium-who-was-once-Delight. And Death is amazing. <br><br>...But now I&#39;m going to sleep, so look it up yourself. &#39;Night!<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>I love that anime! It is so cute and funny and I want a Manabe.<br><br>Since Tamora Pierce has already been mentioned, I will have to recommend the <i>Temeraire</i> series. It&#39;s reminiscent of Eragon in that it&#39;s about a guy who&#39;s chosen as a <strike>rider</strike> captain by a newly-hatched dragon, and even the dragon itself ends up being a Super Speshul breed of dragon. On the other hand, it takes place during the Napoleonic wars and a lot of the conflict concerns the social and personal sacrifices that the main character is forced to make for the sake of his new role, along with racism, sexism, classism, the fetters of social expectations and standards, and the cruelty and amorality of war. Also the dragons are really big and are basically flying, sentient ships that require crews which I think is really awesome.</p>

            <p>The plot is actually nothing like Eragon, really. It can get quite political, and like I said there&#39;s a lot of the -isms. Racism, classism, sexism, though sexism is played with because there&#39;s one breed of dragon that only ever chooses female captains, so the Aerial Corps does train girls. Doesn&#39;t take away the sentiments, of course. And I love that there are consequences to becoming a dragon&#39;s captain; the main character Laurence doesn&#39;t want the role at first because it&#39;s basically social suicide, he has to give up his beloved position in the navy, he immediately loses his chance to marry his would-be fiance, and he&#39;s very nearly disowned by his family. It&#39;s okay though, since he finds his place and he loves his dragon, but... CONSEQUENCES. I love consequences.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m right there with you on the Eragon movie. You wouldn&#39;t think it would be possible to be worse than the books, but when the movie fails at storytelling in a way that does nothing to patch the problems from the book while simultaneously voiding the possibility of a sequel, everyone involved has failed. Except Jeremy Irons. I&#39;m fairly certain by this point that he takes roles in terrible movies on purpose, so I can&#39;t really blame him for showing up in another one.<br><br>So, if those are the coolest things you can think of, what would happen if you saw Alan Rickman, wearing a top hat, riding a dragon?</p>

            <p>Would a clockwork werewolf be a normal man that turns into a clockwork creature at certain times, a clockwork creature that turns into a wolf at certain times, or a werewolf enhanced by clockwork components?

            <p>For one thing, it sounds very creepy if someone can read your mind.  It means that they have full access to your privacy without having to sneak into your house.

You don&#39;t want a mind-reading ability if you don;t want to know what&#39;s in some people&#39;s heads.

            <p>Doctor Who and Torchwood both do a lot with the idea of being either immortal or very long-lived--and, in a way, perpetually young. In Doctor Who, the Doctor outlives most of the people he knows, and is often shown having to deal with that. He&#39;s also telepathic, and very smart, although those two aren&#39;t dealt with quite as much. (Here, when I say &#39;perpetually young&#39;, I mostly mean his most recent incarnations--the earlier ones tended to be somewhat older-looking). In one episode his youth is actually suspended, and the 900-year-old Doctor is revealed to be, well, <i>really, really, really old</i>, as opposed to his current (at that point) youthful David Tennant form. He&#39;s also a compelling character, have I mentioned that yet? No? Well, he is.<br><br>In Torchwood, Captain Jack Harkness can&#39;t die. Or rather, he can--he just can&#39;t stay dead. He was originally a regular human from the 51st century, but something happened to him in an episode of Doctor Who and he can&#39;t stay dead anymore. He also barely ages--after over a century, he mentions that he&#39;s getting the odd gray hair. He spends the entire 20th century on Earth, waiting for the Doctor. Over that time, he fights in wars, he loses everyone due to wars, sickness, and old age, and he...well, he&#39;s very lonely. Not all the time, but a lot of it. He falls in love several times, is even married once, and each experience is different. They&#39;re also spoilers, so I won&#39;t tell you (even though there&#39;s every chance you know both of these fandoms already...) One of them actually says to him, &#39;Ten thousand years from now, you won&#39;t even remember me.&#39; He&#39;s also occasionally shown dealing with cultural differences, but by the time Torchwood is actually set in, he&#39;s gotten used to a lot of things. Then again, he was also pretty much trained to blend in in different time periods for his former job, so that may have something to do with it.<br><br>And there ends my analysis of two TV shows you may have already seen.<br><br>If you want good and generally realistic handling of magic, try Tamora Pierce&#39;s books. If you want an especially good example of the responsibilities and years of study that actually come with being a powerful mage, try the Circle of Magic series (and its sequels) by the same author. Diana Wynne Jones&#39; Chrestomanci series also does a good job of showing the responsibilities and dangers of magic, although they are technically aimed at slightly younger readers. If you don&#39;t mind that, though, I recommend them very, very highly. Other than that, there&#39;s something that&#39;s slipping my mind right now; if I remember it, I&#39;ll let you know.<br><br>(As to why I&#39;ve included these: the Chrestomanci is a position held by a nine-lived enchanter. They&#39;re very rare, and very powerful. The series deals mostly with young nine-lived enchanters--in two different generations--being taught, well, responsibility, mostly. Tamora Pierce also has a tendency to write about unique magic users: Alanna is actually <i>the chosen one of a goddess</i>--which, believe me, is explored in depth--Daine is the strongest Wild Mage in...centuries, I think, and Kel--well, Kel doesn&#39;t actually have magic. She is the first openly female knight-contender in over a century, though. In the Circle books, Briar, Sandry, Tris, and Daja are extremely powerful at a young age, and use a type of magic that&#39;s often ignored or not even known about. The books focus a lot on the benefits, disadvantages, and responsibilities that come with their magic. ...this is all a lot more interesting than it sounds. Basically, Tamora Pierce is an amazing author, and she handles Sue-ish ideas so well I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever even thought of accusing her characters of being Sues. In fact, the only character I&#39;ve heard the fandom accuse of being slightly Sueish was Daine, and, well...I don&#39;t know. I like her. And the people who said she was Sueish meant it more in the way of &#39;Sue-like tendencies&#39;. Not to mention that her world is still detailed and well-written. It&#39;s a matter of opinion, I suppose.)<br><br>Does that help? Or rather, is any of that what you were looking for, preferably in addition to being something you haven&#39;t read or watched already?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Tamora Pierce is wonderful. I think her books may have been the first fantasy series I ever read, though I don&#39;t remember too well anymore, with the amount of books I get through.

It may even have been the first of her books that I read. I think Howl, the Power of Three, and the Chrestomanci series are my favorites, though. She was an absolutely amazing author, and I do think her books are accessible to pretty much all ages, if older audiences don&#39;t mind a slightly simpler writing style in places. They&#39;re just...the plots are lovely, the worlds are described in enough detail to make you see them without trouble, and the characters are ridiculously lively and alive. I love them.<br><br>And I would totally go check out that collection of short stories if I was anywhere near my library alsdkhgadh;<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Or, if it helps: Himochi, I hereby <i>forbid</i> you to check out any of these new fandoms until after you&#39;ve finished your exams. If you break this solemn covenant, you will be doomed to... *gasp!* Give up all your cookies!<br><br>...ok, I may have failed at the seriousness there.<br><br>Well, if you want fandom recommendations, I&#39;m glad to advise. <s>I&#39;m in far too many.</s> Actually, here&#39;s one more.<br><br><i>Once Upon a Time</i> sort of falls into the &#39;deals well with a Sue trope&#39; idea because the main character, Emma Swan, literally has to save a town full of fairy-tale characters from, well, not remembering who they are. She is the only one who can do this--and she doesn&#39;t even believe it. (She&#39;s also the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming. She doesn&#39;t believe that, either.) The thing is, she&#39;s grown up entirely in our world. She doesn&#39;t believe in any of this. And yet, she gets involved in this town, mainly because the son she gave up years ago is there, and she wants to look out for him. He&#39;s the main proponent of the fairy-tale world; she repeatedly applies Real World logic to everything he tells her is true. It&#39;s a serious show, possibly aimed at a slightly younger audience (no idea why, considering the topic) and it does sort of deal with a Sue trope? I mean, a Sue in Emma&#39;s position would probably either be inconsistent in her denials, or accept the fairy-tale world without any logical proof. And then she&#39;d save the world, and sparkle while she did it.<br><br>Also, if you just plain want a good series, I&#39;d recommend Gerald Morris&#39; Squire&#39;s Tales series. Er, if you have even the slightest interest in the King Arthur stories, that is. Which reminds me: <i>Merlin</i> is also a great TV show, and I&#39;m really doing an excellent job of showcasing the too-many fandoms I&#39;m in, aren&#39;t I? Anyway, the Squire&#39;s Tales series is hilarious, magical, and full of feels, as they say on Tumblr. And that&#39;s where I leave you for now, even though I could also recommend Lloyd Alexander&#39;s Chronicles of Prydain series, and, in fact, pretty much all of his writing...<br><br>Yup. Time to stop writing.<br><br>Enjoy?<br><br>Also, good luck with your exams! :) Sorry for giving you potential distractions...maybe the sheer number of them will deter you from actually checking them out until later?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>In True Blood (tv-series, I haven&#39;t gotten around to reading the books) the main character can read minds and unless she focuses very hard, she can&#39;t block out other people&#39;s thoughts and it&#39;s very stressful for her. I&#39;m pretty sure that it&#39;s not that unusual for mind reading to come with the disdvantage of being unable to turn it off, but True Blood is the only canon that springs to my mind.<br><br>As for seeing the future it sometimes comes with the &#39;Cassandra-curse&#39; in that they can&#39;t get other people to believe their visions and/or are unable to change the future. Again, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that uncommon, but the only example I can think of is Cloud of Sparrows by Takashi Matsuoka.</p>

            <p>So, I ran across this comic the other day:<br><br><a href="http://psuedofolio.tumblr.com/post/25864010106"><a href="http://psuedofolio.tumblr.com/post/25864010106">http://psuedofolio.tumblr.com/post/25864010106</a></a><br><br>Most people find this to be the most heartwarming thing on the internet that doesn&#39;t involve anime-styled disabled girls.<br><br>Me? It actually makes me sad... not the thing itself, but because it reminds me of how utterly cruel I am in my own writing. I believe I&#39;ve mentioned creating a universe on the IRC, but I feel I should mention that I could count the characters in it that HAVEN&#39;T gone through hell on one hand. One of them is heavily implied to be God, so that thing barely counts.<br><br>It&#39;s not trivialization on my part, either; said in-character experiences have traumatized at least two of them. One of them is a Holocaust survivor; in the story&#39;s present day, he&#39;s completely and totally insane. His own father did that to him. Yeah, Heinrich Hцllenhund just wants a hug, and the Big Bad is perfectly willing to do that... and he&#39;s got his own problems, namely that his very job description involves absorbing the negative emotions of an entire race of lunatics. He&#39;s been doing that for five million years.<br><br>Yeah. Am I the only person that&#39;s done this to their creations?</p>

            <p>First of all, before anything else, I must say that that comic is one of the sweetest things I&#39;ve ever seen. <br><br>Moving on, now.

            <p>I&#39;m going to name-replace for the sake of clarity here.<br><br>Hmmm... lets see, out of the main characters in just one story-world, we have:<br><br>1) The Narrator, a girl whose childhood wandering around the country with her (probably bipolar) single mother resulted in her not having any friends until the age of seventeen, after which she blamed herself for not being there when her mother attempted to commit suicide. Her mother survived, but was critically brain damaged from the amount of time that she spent without oxygen. She does not remember her daughter. The Narrator feels simultaneously guilty that she hadn&#39;t gotten home <i>sooner</i> and guilty that she sometimes wishes that she&#39;d gotten there later, because her mother as she knew her is gone. The Narrator flees her problems by running away with The Wizard.<br><br>2) The Wizard had a happy childhood with her sisters, the Knight and The Genius. However, while she was staying with her aunt and her childhood friend The Inventor during a middle-school break, she and The Inventor decide to have a look around one of the local abandoned houses. It turns out that The Inventor&#39;s ancestors managed to create not only one immortal, Frankenstein-type monster, but four of them, three of which are completely loyal to the fourth. None of them have any conception of the real world, having been locked in the house for decades following the death of their original creator, and they hold both children captive and cook up a scheme to get their &quot;father&quot; back, which involves sacrificing the children. When the children try to escape, The Inventor suffers an extremely nasty concussion and The Wiizard is injured as well, leading her to panic and kill all four of the constructs with fire. (This leads to her parents taking her home and to her eventually traveling far away to the school where she meets The Narrator.)<br><br>3) The Inventor, in addition to the above, was severely injured by the blow to the head (and the hours and hours before anybody found them,) and now, even in adulthood, suffers from intermittent, crippling migraines and loss of motor function on his left side. Despite this, he managed to recover enough in the four years after the injury that he could go to college and live a somewhat normal life... until his mother died while he was away at school and his inventions were dismissed as being impossible to create. Eventually, he got desperate enough to test one of his devices on himself...<br><br>4) The Knight still doesn&#39;t know what happened to her twin sister, The Wizard, and is perfectly ready to fight her older sister, The Genius, if she ever implies again that the fire might have been The Wizard&#39;s fault. Since neither of her sisters are fit to inherit the family&#39;s responsibilities (namely, negotiating with other families that have wizards or land,) she becomes the default heir and has to take up all the responsibilities that The Wizard abandons when she runs away with The Narrator. (Other than that, though, The Knight has had it relatively easy until the story actually starts.)<br><br>5) The Genius lost her best (and almost her only) friend when her younger sister, The Wizard, nearly died. The two have not spoken since The Wizard&#39;s fateful run-in with the Frankenstein creatures, almost a decade ago when the story starts. The Wizard, however, does not know that her big sister investigated the scene of the incident and was able to determine that she started the fire herself, but not why. This puts a lot of strain on The Genius, because she doesn&#39;t want to admit that her sister could kill, especially at age thirteen... but all available evidence suggests that she did.<br><br>Okay, that&#39;s enough to be getting on with, I think, but the secondary characters certainly get enough grief. Let&#39;s see, I have a soldier from the mages&#39;-war who became a cop so that she could recapture the adrenaline, a necromanceress who was wrongfully accused of using black magic and who was condemned without a trial to a slow death by having her magic removed (she clearly <i>lived</i>, but yeah, enduring any of that process wasn&#39;t fun,) a guy who was forcibly suspended in time for fifteen years and who can&#39;t ever go home even after he avenged his father&#39;s death, because he&#39;s fifteen years younger than he should be, and another guy who  is currently watching his elderly father succumb to Alzheimers, being daily mistaken by his dad for his dead, decade-older war hero brother. <br><br>And this group right here? They&#39;re some of my favorite characters ever, and I&#39;ve had them for nearly four years now. I&#39;m not even going to go into the ones that I got this year. (Also, I&#39;m aware that all gets confusing, but there are multiple stories in this world, so it fits together better with more information, I promise.)<br><br>So, what&#39;s the worst thing anybody here has ever done to a character?</p>

            <p>I called this continuum Midnight Sun (no relation to the Stephanie Meyer novel, I came up with this first). Let&#39;s run through the character histories:<br><br>The tertiary protagonist, Voyd Kyoujin. He evolved from a self-insert. Subject of parental favoritism... which led to his dad (the Big Bad) doing something horrible to his brother. Voyd went somewhat insane, and is VERY much a loose cannon who has to develop into friendship with the other protagonists. He is also almost completely repressed emotionally, and even at his most psychotic, he never loses his dull-eyed frown.<br><br>The big bad, Sh&#39;tennin: No, that&#39;s not his real name. First off, he&#39;s the king of his race. Doesn&#39;t sound bad, right? Here&#39;s the catch: the monarch has to absorb the psychosis and negative emotions of the race so that they don&#39;t drive themselves extinct. Most rulers go insane after a few centuries. He&#39;s been alive for five million years. Besides all that mess, he values his family, and rather misguidedly tormented one of his sons, thinking Voyd wouldn&#39;t have a problem with that. He also had a third child; his queen went batshit and killed it right after it was born, and he had to kill her. Halfway through the story, Voyd has a cosmic meltdown, killing himself and driving Sh&#39;tennin further into his own torment. Yeah. His goal is actually kind of noble: He wants to transform all life into his race... to take their negative emotions as well, so that there won&#39;t be any more war or conflict. If he succeeded, he&#39;d seal himself into an eternal sleep so that he wouldn&#39;t lose his mind. He&#39;s risking a LOT to get peace.<br><br>Then we have the antagonists&#39; mad scientist, Heinrich Hollenhund. Born to an evil human made ageless by cosmic interference, Heinrich had the misfortune of being pansexual in 1920&#39;s Germany. His father Albert, tired of this life and wanting to move on to a new one, sent both Heinrich and his mother to Auschwitz. Albert then joined the Reich and transferred to Auschwitz to torment his wife and son himself. Anyone who knows anything about WWII knows how that goes, and Albert shot Heinrich&#39;s mother in front of him. Heinrich got left behind when Auschwitz was overrun, and Sh&#39;tennin (traveling the universe in secret) found him going out of his mind. He took the poor guy in, and Heinrich basically serves as that third son he never had.<br><br>Heinrich does get his revenge on Albert, by the way. Very brutal vengeance. <br><br>There are more, but I&#39;d be rambling more than I already am. Let&#39;s just say one thing: You know that thing that I said was implied to be God? One of its &quot;offspring&quot; (term used very loosely) has it just as rough as Sh&#39;tennin or Heinrich.<br><br>Fear the Midnight Sun universe. It is filled with sorrow, fury, and bizarre alien morality/biology.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s take my newest agent characters for examples.<br><br>Kozar was a slightly unusual Klingon, and was a bit ostracized and looked down upon in his home world. In the PPC, I&#39;ve put him through working with someone who presents herself as insane, half a month of dealing with the same partner&#39;s new tribble (the Klingons view them as horrible parasites), a new partner who he ends up caring enough about to adopt into his family--who dies, and a new partner who could, at any moment, be killed and turn into a completely different person. I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;ve been particularly kind to him.<br><br>The Reader (Kozar&#39;s latest partner) recently found out that her planet and her people had been destroyed in a horrific war that she actually saw part of, and that there are two people of her species remaining outside the PPC (and a somewhat larger number inside it). She&#39;s not dealing so well with that. Her partner is also still trying to deal with losing his previous partner, who, as I mentioned, was family, and he keeps seeing bits of his former partner in her (it doesn&#39;t help that her current regeneration is of a similar height and coloring to the dead partner). She wants them to get along and be able to work together, but they mostly end up arguing or focusing on work. She also repeatedly makes missteps in Klingon culture, which she doesn&#39;t know very well. And, on top of all that, her TARDIS is missing.<br><br>So you tell me. Have I been particularly kind to these characters? I mean, on the one hand, yes, but on the other hand...no, I really haven&#39;t.<br><br>And while I wouldn&#39;t say that this is typical of my work, it&#39;s not particularly atypical, either.<br><br>In terms of the comic...it&#39;s a cute idea, but only if you don&#39;t look too closely at the message it&#39;s sending.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Most of the characters I&#39;ve created a full backstory for have had pretty much terrible lives. The mage who couldn&#39;t control his magic properly and accidentally killed his mother. The man who, even into his adulthood, was hated by everyone he knew because of things his father had done. The girl who was forced to work as a slave because of the meaning of her name. The old man who was born with the illegal power to alter emotions, who only ever allow his son to come near his to avoid accidentally using the power.<br><br>Hm, I just realised how few characters I actually planned out in this universe. Maybe I should stop creating the mythology and history of the place and start working on more actual people, haha.</p>

All right, yes, and dying and being resurrected - but he doesn&#39;t remember that.

            <p>You know, I&#39;ve always thought that it&#39;s nice to have characters who go through things that normal people don&#39;t go through, both good and bad. That&#39;s probably because I write mostly fantasy, so when there&#39;s a character whose moral dilemma is exactly what kind of magic it&#39;s ethical to use on another person without their knowledge, it&#39;s supposed to make people think, and then maybe later apply the parallels to something that actually exists, not respond with &quot;hey, I had that exact moral dilemma last night at dinner!&quot; Not that I don&#39;t read (and like to write) things where people have mostly average lives in terms of the realism of the problems that they face, but my favorite stories to write are the ones that I hope people will come out of thinking about things that no other author will ever make them think about.</p>

            <p>I have an original continuum that I&#39;ve been writing since I was 15, and dreaming up since 13 (I&#39;m now 24). I can say that pretty much all of the main characters have to suffer through all sorts of terrible things, although they usually end up stronger afterwards... eventually.<br><br>There is one character, though, who would look upon five million years of pain as small fry compared to her billions. A large part of it delves into her psychology, so hopefully she is quite well characterised (some of the earlier, less powerful, mains seem a bit bland, and I&#39;m not sure how to fix them) - especially given she has the power level to take down the equivalent of deities.</p>

            <p>Good grief, I think I&#39;ve been sheltering my lot. <br><br>I always have a tendency to write these really... <i>average</i> characters. Like, &quot;Arthur Dent ьbermuggle&quot; average, where the focus is more on the world and the character&#39;s companions. Average to the point of writing (but never really finishing/publishing) about the daily life of a half-blood Hufflepuff fifth year at Hogwarts. The main thing that set this story apart was that I got to explore each house&#39;s attitude toward Hufflepuff, which is seriously under-appreciated by the way.<br><br>I&#39;ve always been more of a world-builder than a character builder, so that&#39;s probably the explanation.</p>

            <p>I also have an idea about a character that is so <i>not</i> magical that he is shrouded by an anti-magic aura. In a world where practically everyone uses magic or magitek, he&#39;s basically a freak of nature. Direct and indirect spells don&#39;t affect him because anything within a two-metre radius of the guy behaves normally, to the point where he can sit at the centre a magic firestorm with nothing but an oxygen tank, fire-resistant clothing, and sunglasses and come out completely fine. <br><br>The obvious downside to this is that healing or beneficial spells won&#39;t work on him-- or will stop working whenever he comes close to them. <br><br>Hm. I might have to expand on this later on.<br></p>

            <p>However, it was a very badly written book, and it often ended up contradicting that fact anyway.

            <p>For at least a few characters in practically everything I write, I give them something awful in their past, good reason to believe that something awful will happen in the future, or both. Of course, I usually pair them with a more idealistic or happy-go-lucky character and watch the two of them bicker, but sometimes I just pile so much nasty stuff on the entire story.<br><br>In one of the biggest cases of the latter, which I wrote about a year ago, I had originally intended as a deconstruction of the clichйs of Internet paranormal fiction like the creepypastas. It turned into what is probably the darkest story I&#39;ve ever made.<br><br>One of the main characters ended up with his mind and personality destroyed, with its remnants piloting a body that had been twisted, enthralled, and &quot;modified&quot; by a humanoid abomination called the Gentleman, and became a central antagonist for the second third of the story before his nervous system started breaking down during one of his fights and he ended up being turned on by the other modified once-humans.<br><br>The protagonist, who had an ability to see events in possible futures in his dreams in reference to the old clichй(though I subverted it by making it a plot device exactly once and a problem every other time his clairvoyance showed up), was driven close to madness as it became more and more probable that he&#39;d fail, which caused him to have steadily increasing nightmares where he watched alternate versions of himself get killed, often at the claws of the once-humans, all the while with the knowledge that what he was seeing was actually happening in a potential world, and that one of the dying versions he saw might be him.<br><br>His love interest was later aged to death by the Gentleman, and since the abomination was planning on healing itself by draining the minds of a nursing home(it makes a lot more sense in context, I swear, the Gentleman didn&#39;t mind-drain the elderly just to be extra-evil), and the protagonist had to burn it down to keep his enemy from coming back to full strength.<br><br>No, I don&#39;t usually write nearly as dark as that any more, because that story was incredibly over-the-top as it was, though it <i>was</i> very fun to write.<br>Actually, since the protagonist ended up charged with arson and later deemed legally insane after recounting his experiences, and the Gentleman was alive at the end, that story may not have been the best choice to put in a thread about what seems to largely be about characters <u>succeeding</u> after undergoing their traumatic events at this point.</p>

            <p>One of my friends and I wrote a comedy/deconstruction of mary-sues a couple years back, actually pretty much right before I joined the ppc. We&#39;d been dared to see if we could come up with a character and a story which would score the maximum number of points on the mary sue litmus test over at springhole, which would still make any sort of logical sense. God, it was fun making stupid shit happen to that character on the way to making her more believable. Oh, and having fun with the footnotes. <br><br><a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/s/2904328/1/The-Redemption-of-Fyre"><a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/s/2904328/1/The-Redemption-of-Fyre">http://www.fictionpress.com/s/2904328/1/The-Redemption-of-Fyre</a></a><br><br>It was so over the top that I&#39;m just going to put it up for everyone to mock... and now that I think of it, we did to some degree succeed in making a somewhat human character in a world made of ridiculous.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s my headcanon that Agent Christianne&#39;s past romantic life was... not very rosy. That in turn has led to her general cynicism and reluctance in her relationship with Eledhwen (platonic or not) because she&#39;s scared of it repeating. Oh, and also because her previous partners (as mentioned in the Monitor) went insane and/or died, and she doesn&#39;t want that happening to Eledhwen. (And also the classic immortality thing too, but that&#39;s been addressed.)<br><br>But in a less romantic scenario - well, I&#39;ve had my author avatar at IAHF constantly get landed in detention for small infractions, put on a kangaroo trial and thrown in a internment camp, fall through thin ice, sexually assaulted by a fellow student, be denied a fair trial because of such (yet Belgium punished that student in the end anyway, so justice was served in the end), have her own roommate and best friend turn on her, have her romantic interest get killed by a giant snake, come face-to-face with her phobia (said snake) and her worst fears, and suffer through a maze while in the middle of a Mary Sue invasion. Granted, it&#39;s an OFU, but I think OFUs are a great place to dump terrible things on a character to watch them become a better person. And I think my self-insert&#39;s done that.</p>

But essentially, to me a character isn&#39;t interesting if all their conflicts are with defeating &quot;evil&quot; people, rescuing princesses, etc. They need to learn how to be wrong, how to let other people be wrong with style, how to chose their battles when nobody is really right, and how to give themselves the kick in the ass they need to get things done. <br><br>I think my problem with Mary Sues in general is they&#39;re presented as people who are always right (or if they&#39;re not, it&#39;s not their fault,) rather than people who have things that they can work on.</p>

            <p>Back when I was writing borderline sues (and way over the line sues, for that matter) I used mental torture galore. You aren&#39;t the only one. Heck, sometimes I still catch myself doing it a little bit. Not the same kinds of things, but maybe I see a friend who&#39;s got parents she clashes with, so I slap my character with clueless parents. Or maybe her Dad&#39;s one of the evil mediums. The list goes on.....<br><br>I seriously think the only main character. I haven&#39;t slapped with some outside issues like that is probably Katty, and that&#39;s because in her case, I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s worth it. Well- Annette too, but she doesn&#39;t count, she&#39;s a role play. <br><br>It sort of creates something that you need to explore, I guess. As a writer, I kind of feel like writing stories is my way of understanding. It tends to be hard for me to see things unless they&#39;re put in my perspective. </p>

            <p>Some of you may know of my Agents Deuce and Adder; they&#39;re both characters of the same original story of mine. One of them was abandoned (one way or another) by his mother and twin brother and left alone with a sociopathic father who raised him to be an instrument of revenge, and continued down that path until the aforementioned brother returned and stopped him by killing him (though he would later be resurrected and given a second shot at making things right). The other took a magical proverbial bullet to the head when she was little and as a result must contend with infrequent but barely-controllable berserk rages. She then became an exile from her people at the tender age of nine, after she witnessed her mother&#39;s murder and barely escaped with her own life. She was born a member of the group of people designated as villains, a secret she hides from her friends every day.<br><br>I think that if I make a character suffer, it mainly happens when I&#39;m really, really attached to them. This may seem ironic, and I used to think it was, but I really don&#39;t anymore. One of my favorite aspects of writing and reading fiction is watching characters experience positive growth. It&#39;s so beautiful and I love it. And, well, some of the best positive growth starts at rock bottom, and you can&#39;t have good development without bumps and stumbling blocks along the way. It&#39;s impossible, and just unrealistic.<br><br>So yes, I kick my characters while they&#39;re down. I tear their families apart, take away the things they love, and beat them into the dust. And then when I&#39;m done, I stand back, and I watch as they curse and cry and then catch their breath and get back up. Some of them stagger up, bruised and bleeding and barely standing, and go on to drag someone else up with them. I love to see them be strong. I love to see them make one another strong. And that&#39;s why I torture them: because I know they can take it.<br><br>In short, I&#39;ll see your comic and raise you another one. <a href="http://mindofgemini.deviantart.com/art/TGf-Mog-Comic-Crossover-My-Writing-Process-332939062"><a href="http://mindofgemini.deviantart.com/art/TGf-Mog-Comic-Crossover-My-Writing-Process-332939062">http://mindofgemini.deviantart.com/art/TGf-Mog-Comic-Crossover-My-Writing-Process-332939062</a></a></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve done plenty of horrible things to my characters. Not all of them start out like that, but I really really love tearing them down to see how they take it.<br><br>Like that one character whose little brother killed her because she was fated to be the consort of an evil god, but he had twisted mommy issues and she&#39;d been his mother figure all his life (all six years of it...) and he couldn&#39;t take her ignoring him for someone else. <br><br>Wow that story was fun to write I need to see if I have a copy floating around on my computer anywhere...</p>

            <p>I mean, there&#39;s over-the-top suffering too, but the thing to remember is that characters&#39; psyches and their responses are shaped by what they&#39;ve experienced. If you need your character to distrust lawyers for the plot, having a bad experience with a lawyer is usually the right answer. As long as people try and realistically portray the extent of the consequences, and don&#39;t pile on so much suffering that I want to concuss myself with 7,000 pages of Russian literature, a bit of suffering is good for the character&#39;s soul.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s all nice and easy for you to say when the worst thing that can happen in your missions are overpowered Mary Sues - we&#39;ve got to deal with Sues and Canon characters in continua where they shouldn&#39;t be!

            <p>And that&#39;s where I come in, I&#39;m afraid. I do apologize for the late response, but it took rather a while for your original message to come through--something about timelines, I believe? The rest of the report was unintelligible. I think perhaps my TARDIS needs to spend some time in DoSAT for repairs; she hasn&#39;t exactly had the easiest time of things.<br><br>I do understand your viewpoint, believe me. What we had become by the end...well, I was still there by the middle of the end, and it wasn&#39;t very fun, to say the least. I won&#39;t tell you that I believe myself to be any different; I believe that I have the potential to become just like them, as do we all--yourself included, Agent Morgan, if you&#39;ll forgive me for saying so. That&#39;s actually what made me leave the Academy, and eventually Gallifrey itself, in the first place.<br><br>I don&#39;t have any insurance against becoming like the rest of us did, and that terrifies me more than the Nightmare Child did, to be honest. What I do have, though, is a monitoring system in my TARDIS, and a partner who knows what to look out for. And unless you want to stand by with a gun as well, then I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much more to be done.<br><br>If it helps, I&#39;m only about 120 years old, and left the Academy before I absorbed too much propaganda. And, well, there are other Time Lords in HQ who haven&#39;t followed the rest of the Time Lords into insanity; perhaps there&#39;s hope for us.<br><br>-Reader</p>

            <p>Welcome welcome! <br><br>As no one else has got to it yet, have you gotten the chance to read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Constitution</a> and the <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">Original Series</a>? Also, do you have any favorite fandoms? For example most people around here like Lord of the Rings, and I also have several anime/manga fandoms I claim, as well as Stargate (SG-1 and Atlantis), Chronicles of Narnia, Hunger Games, Artemis Fowl and varying levels of familiarity with Doctor Who, Star Trek (Voyager and TNG particularly) and Firefly. *grumbles a bit* And Twilight, which through some quirk while I&#39;m not a fan, I do have a fair familiarity with it and do intend to send my agents (when I get permission) into the little touched minefield that it is. <br><br>As to joining the board as an agent or as something else, really you just join as yourself :) Many on the board write missions and have agents they&#39;ve created, and being a board member here is one of the requirements for getting <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> so you can write your own missions with agents you&#39;ve created. The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a> is also a great source of information! :)<br><br>And now welcome gifts!!! Since you didn&#39;t list any favorite fandoms I&#39;ll start with a chunk of generic stuff. Makes a great book-end, door-stop, paper weight or projectile for sibling or Mary-Sue control. And if you figure out what it is it may be even more useful! You also get, *digs through closet &#39;o doom* an assortment of candy from Honeydukes (don&#39;t mind the newt eye it&#39;s sterile) and an acorn in a small dirt filled glass box.</p>

I found an old notebook of mine the other day and nearly wept. Any one of the characters would literally check off any charge list you cared to name.
