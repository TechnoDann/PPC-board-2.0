            <p>Is a mini solely created when a character or place is misspelled/ uncapitalized? Because in the Harry Potter fic I&#39;m working on sporking, there are a number of spells that are either misspelled or uncapitalized when canonically they should be capitalized (ex: the fidelius charm). Should these just be written off as SPaG errors, or do they create minis? </p>

            <p>I deal with minis quite often, considering I&#39;m writing an OFU. <br>About capitalization: I think it only matters if the capitalization is important to the spelling. For example, there&#39;s a Star Trek: Voyager character named B&#39;Elanna Torres. B&#39;elanna is a mini, and so is b&#39;elanna (and Belanna, for that matter). But torres is incorrect capitalization, not an actual misspelling. Also, something like DAta instead of Data is a mini.<br>Whether spells make minis: I&#39;m not sure. For Trek I&#39;ve been collecting misspellings of starships and gadgets and making them miniature versions of those things. So maybe spells would fall in a similar category, or have some entirely new property when misspelled or mis-capitalized (is that a word?). I think somebody suggested that the spells backfire, which is a good idea.<br>Hope this helps.<br></p>

            <p>Basically, all of the vocabulary that was canonically capitalized is lowercase, such as the word/job Auror and a bunch of spells. These aren&#39;t necessarily proper nouns, just words that JKR made up herself.  </p>

            <p>And by the wiki, I mean <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Portal:Main">WoWWiki</a>. It&#39;s not exhaustive, but it&#39;s a terrific place to start.<br><br>The general storyline focuses mainly on the interactions between the Horde and Alliance during some of the main planetary setting&#39;s darkest hours - like the first attack of the Burning Legion on Azeroth, the Sundering, the opening of the Dark Portal, the Cataclysm, etc.<br><br>That&#39;s the quickest way to sum it up, methinks.

            <p>To all Livejournal users and followers of me on Deviantart, and you silly folks in between:<br><br>I have decided to make me a Livejournal account!<br><br><a href="http://specssc.livejournal.com/586.html">You can find it, and more info about it, here.</a><br><br>I intend to use this Livejournal page for a lot of my writing - both on my DS and whatever alternative posting outlet I can find - including a big, multi-story series called the Chronicles of Zeyr.<br><br>For those interested, here&#39;s part of the prologue of the first story, which breaks down what the series is about:<br><br>&quot;<i>I sit within the confines of a room, alien to me, with pen in hand, so as to transcribe the end of our world as I recall it.<br><br>The world of Zeyr was once a beautiful place, crafted from the minds of the gods themselves. This world was a creation more grand in design than any galaxy. The gods loved this world, and sought to protect it, and the virgin humans and elves who lived upon it; so they created the Immortal Eldraec - Children of Fate, Peace Keepers, Guardians of Order. In our young, uneducated days, we called these wise and powerful mentors gods, blind as we were to the existence our true masters. <br><br>The Eldraec never objected; such was not their way to fight. All they wished to do was safeguard their world, and those mortal beings who called it home.<br><br>Eventually, we mortal beings evolved.<br><br>The First Kingdom of Elvenkind - Kai&#39;Nitians, they called themselves - had existed long before the First Kingdom of Man, but it was the Kingdom of Man who took on the name of the world as its own, a name it earned and rightly deserved by the might of its armies and under the guidance of its powerful line of kings. The Kingdom of Zeyr was revered as a perfect kingdom, welcoming and sheltering to all, rich or poor, and boasted a society far ahead of its time. <br><br>This society grew only stronger with the discovery of an ancient power that existed in dormancy in all beings: Magic. None had been able to harness it before, but when a young man by the name of Arcadas Veria was brought before the King, studies and tests were launched in great haste across the world. Eventually, magic became the power of all Zeyr&#39;s technology, and the ancient kingdom of stone and steel was raised into the future. Mages sprang up throughout the world, and a city was raised by the Humans and Elves in dedication to their investigations: Sanctuary, built with the repurposed ruins of a massive and legendary temple.<br><br>With magic&#39;s discovery came as well a new class of soldier: Vanguardians.<br><br>Born from the mind of Kraig Lescarr, the Vanguardians were men and women whose lives were destined for an early conclusion, taken in, mentored and trained by Kraig Lescarr as powerful defenders and humble servants of the people. They were the first mortal beings to employ magic as a tool of war and healing, and they quickly became the envy of the armed forces of the world.<br><br>In short, every aspect of life was once grand - even the bloodshed was honorable. <br><br>But all of this began to change with the death of the last king, Haaldenfrost.<br><br>As his son, Prince Hjorleif, was still young and untrained when his father passed, the Council of the King enacted an emergency protocol, thus placing themselves in power alongside the Prince so as to aid him in ruling the kingdom. But this countermeasure soon turned on its head, and the Council ran the Prince off the throne, denounced him as a monarch, and transformed Zeyr into a republic. Suddenly, the great advances of the world came under fire - mages were treated with spite and fear, and the Council enforced a decree that outlawed magic&#39;s use unless by Council-appointed mages, and refused to acknowledge Sanctuary as an established government. Those who broke this law were hunted by the repurposed Vanguardians and executed on sight, or brought in and forced into the Council&#39;s employment.<br><br>Kraig Lescarr tried to keep his Vanguardians from falling into this spiteful, greedy life, but it was clear that his hold as General over them was beginning to fail. More and more, these once honorable keepers of the peace became corrupted by the lustfulness of their bodies and minds, and the Council only fed this hunger further.<br><br>Racism began to take its hold as well. After a war between former allied kingdoms Fayn, Gozai and Numine, Zeyr treated any members of their kingdoms as enemies of the Council, and when caught, many were tortured, harassed and killed. This extended as well to the Elves, who could barely escape the beatings of the public without a hood over their heads to hide their ears.<br><br>Those of Zeyr&#39;s Kingdom who spoke out against this horrible treatment of other people were considered traitors and run out of their homes or killed, thus forcing the people into silent compliance if they valued their lives.<br><br>Zeyr had become an evil place.<br><br>And I, and eleven others, lived in the midst of the beginning of the end of all things.</i>&quot;<br><br>There you go, something to wet your appetites with.</p>

            <p>The best way to kill a Sue is to use an ironic, canonical method. And the safest way is to use a ranged weapon. So, if you can find an ironic, canonical ranged weapon? Go for it. Legolas fangirl Sues can usually be taken down very well by an Elven-made bow, for example. Or an Orcish bow or crossbow (I think the Uruk-Hai had crossbows, didn&#39;t they?), which could well be part of the disguise.<br><br>Of course, your agents have to be proficient in the weapon in question. Most agents will have some kind of training, but newbies may be reduced to simple weapons anyone can use, and even the most experienced ones may have to improvise. If worst comes to worst, a heavy rock to the skull will take down most Sues.<br><br>In some cases, the Sue is so flat that she is unable to comprehend that the agents are going to assassinate her. It could literally be possible to grab her, tie her up, and throw her off a cliff without encountering anything but misspelled protests. But some Sues will fight back, and if they fight back, your agents should fight dirty. Thankfully, Sues are not very creative combatants, since most of their writers don&#39;t know how to write battle scenes and simply hand their Sue the victory, with or without just-for-show flourishes. The biggest danger from Sues in combat is just that they are overpowered, so it&#39;s a bad idea to take them on head-on. Creativity, stealth, and dirty fighting should be the order of the day.<br><br>It&#39;s really not the Sues that are so dangerous; it&#39;s the canons. A well-written canon under Suefluence does not suffer from the lack of creativity that Sues have. Those who are mostly in character aren&#39;t too much of a threat because of the SEP field, but if they&#39;re OOC enough to notice or the Sue calls them into the fight on her side, your agents have the problem of dealing with sometimes very skilled combatants who should not be killed. This is why you want the Sue alone for the assassination. Otherwise, you may end up with an infuriated, Sued Aragorn chasing you through a mysteriously spiderless Mirkwood, convinced that you are out to kill the girl he loves so much that he has completely forgotten about Arwen.<br><br>Not that this wouldn&#39;t be amusing to write about. Unlike Sues, agents are not perfect and do not have their battles handed to them on a silver platter.</p>

            <p>I feel you might have overlooked some admittedly-minor-but-important things. If not, it&#39;s still good for the question asker to know them, right?<br><br>In Lego Lord of the Rings, there are unlockable Uruk Crossbowmen, which you also end up fighting in Helm&#39;s Deep, and they have a primative Sniper/Spotter system with trolls throwing big rocks on the Uruk&#39;s call, so I assume this all happens in canon as well.<br><br>Although Jay and Acacia and the other early agent writers did make it a habit to inform readers of agent capabilities, nowadays, it seems that so long as there is plausible evidence of proficiency with a certain weapon, nobody is apt to complain about why this agent was using a flux capacitor cannon McWhatever to kill the sue.<br><br>Ironic deaths are still well and good, though.<br><br>It seems that more and more Sues are going the flat route, as an aside here.<br><br>Nothing to say about canons, all has been said.<br><br>Aaand that&#39;s my response here.</p>

            <p>Another good one is turning the &#39;Sue&#39;s/&#39;Stu&#39;s own powers against them. It can be tricky to do, and is only possible under certain circumstances, but it is very ironic and downright hilarious when it works. It is also a useful way of weakening a combat-capable &#39;Sue so your agents can pin them down to read the charge list.</p>

            <p>In one of my missions, a character had turned into basically a combat machine that curbstomped everyone into oblivion and was an absolute hypocrite who bore no resemblance to ANYTHING in the canon and....<br><br>Nevermind. Anyways, partway through she randomly got a freaking Gundam upgrade (Gundam had not shown up before, since, or in any other capacity other than happy present from the author) and basically upgraded herself with tech from three different canons (that was of course so super speshul and so much better than her native canon who ARGH.) So my and Des&#39; agents gave her a virus-laden chunk of tech that later crippled her to the point where Ari could go toe-to-toe with her without getting instantly curbstomped (though Ari is still in Medical. I need to make an Interlude for that...)</p>

            <p>I know nothing about Puella Magi or any powers that Kyubey might have but you cannot separate conjoined (the phrase &quot;Siamese&quot; is kinda outdated and inaccurate) twins without a scar of some sort. If they were attached somewhere in the chest region, as I would assume from Yamika&#39;s muteness, then there would have been way more complications. And why did the mother die? There was nothing wrong with her.<br><br>Second point: orphanages. I have heard real-life stories about twins getting separated and adopted by two different families, which would have explained their severe difference in personalities (although being a bit speshul and dramatic) but they were together the entire time. Studies have shown that with identical twins, who share the same DNA, the differences in appearance and personality only occur because of a difference in environments, mostly in the first six months. They have had basically the same environment their entire lives. This is not plausible.<br><br>Third point: I really effing hate &quot;shared souls&quot; and &quot;twin telepathy&quot;. The reason (I assume from my experiences as a twin and from knowing other twins) for all those theories is because most twins have lived extremely similar lives, which conditions them to think and act the same way. If you shared almost all of your experiences with someone and saw them every single day of your life, you would end up with a lot of inside jokes and things like that, which make people on the outside think you&#39;re sharing thoughts or something.<br><br>I would advise leaving them alone, because they&#39;re not going to be changing any time soon with that attitude. The way they put your username in quotation marks struck me as really rude for some reason.</p>

            <p>Really, what&#39;s even more annoying to me (than the huge breaks in canon) is that &#39;Gugarts&#39; is the one replying.

            <p>Are you asking how to remove a Sue from your own work, or what&#39;s that best way to kill a Sue in a PPC mission? If it&#39;s the first, I guess the best analogy is a surgical operation--remove the traits from the character that are Sue-y and re-mold the story around them. A good rule of thumb is that if the OC is the main character and the main characters from the continuum are in the story, the OC is probably a Sue. So what you&#39;d have to is rework the story to make canon characters the focus. Or, conversely, make the fic a &quot;lower decks&quot; story, showing a different slice of life in the continuum. For example, Harry Potter focuses on Gryffindor house, so a story focusing on some OCs in Hufflepuff that only have brief contact with the Golden Trio wouldn&#39;t be Sue-y.<br>In a PPC mission, the way the agents kill the Sue is up to the author of the mission, but there is a format. The agents go into the fic, observe the Sue&#39;s transgressions as they watch the plot of the Suefic play out, then, when they have enough charges, they interrupt the narrative and charge and kill the Sue. They  might simply use canonical weapons on her, or maybe they&#39;ll come up with something appropriate. For example, if the Sue survived a fall that she shouldn&#39;t have, the agents might drop her off a cliff.<br><br>Hope I&#39;ve answered your question! Thanks for asking!</p>

            <p>Er, I wish to request permission to write stories in the PPC continuum. Uh... this is my info, according to the wiki...<br><br>1.) My agent is named Basil. He looks like this: <a href="http://www.tektek.org/avatar/52279353"><a href="http://www.tektek.org/avatar/52279353">http://www.tektek.org/avatar/52279353</a></a>  He is ten years old (formerly twenty, due to a mishap involving an age-regression device.)

            <p>Permission denied. But don&#39;t sweat it. You&#39;re not the first to jump the gun, and you won&#39;t be the last. {= )<br><br>A few pieces of advice:<br><br>1) Waiting until you are confident enough to type without stammering and going &quot;er&quot; and &quot;uh&quot; every other sentence is a good idea. Exhibiting a lack of confidence in one&#39;s self does not inspire confidence from others. (Also, why go to all the trouble to deliberately type out a stammer? I don&#39;t get it.)<br><br>2) The Department of Floaters is becoming rather overused. Like, a lot. I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t put your agent(s) there, but I AM encouraging you to shop around a bit and see if there isn&#39;t something with a narrower scope that still fits your sporking interests. If you&#39;re thinking about Floaters because you don&#39;t know what your interests are yet, waiting until you&#39;ve gotten a handle on it is a good idea.<br><br>2.5) Read lots of different spin-offs to see what&#39;s been done before, what works, what doesn&#39;t, what you like, and what you don&#39;t.<br><br>3) There&#39;s nothing wrong with only writing one agent. A few exceptions aside, though, it IS expected that all agents should have a partner, so you might want to find someone to write with you if you don&#39;t want to come up with a second agent yourself. Co-writing is fun. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh </p>

            <p>What do you want to do? If you have a wide variety of fandom interests and want to spork all different types of badfic, then Floaters is a good choice for you, despite it being heavily populated. If you&#39;re only interested in Sue-slaying and don&#39;t particularly want to deal with crossovers, bad slash, or whatever else, then the DMS is a better choice. But, there are <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department">lots of departments</a>, as you can see. Some of them have divisions, too, which are handy if you want to specialize in a certain fandom or a sub-type of fic. It&#39;s best to PPC in areas you know well and enjoy when written skillfully. The idea is really to find humor in the badness, after all, not to just get angry at things you don&#39;t like. {= )<br><br>Anyway, you don&#39;t have to make up your mind right now. Part of the point of waiting a while to ask Permission is so that you have plenty of time to figure things out.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Firstly, you&#39;ve only just joined.  As Specs said, you&#39;ve got to be around for a bit before we give you free rein to write PPC things.  It&#39;s nothing personal - we&#39;re just making sure you&#39;re on the level.  Post on the Board, hang out in the IRC, make some friends.  You&#39;ll be ready before you know it.<br><br>Secondly, your Agent intro needs work.  It&#39;s painfully short, and doesn&#39;t really tell us anything except that your Agent had a mishap with some sort of wibbley wobbley, timey-wimey thing.  I would suggest reading some older Permission requests, to give you a general idea of what we&#39;re looking for.<br><br>Finally, I would strongly suggest making another agent.  Agents normally work in pairs, primarily because it&#39;s damned difficult to keep Missions interesting if there&#39;s nothing but one Agent bemoaning the horribleness of the fic, followed by a Sue dying painfully.  If you can do it with just one Agent, and keep it funny and interesting, feel free to disregard this lat paragraph.  If you&#39;re not sure that you can, I really do suggest you write up another.<br><br>If you need help with any of this, feel free to let me, or someone else, know.  We won&#39;t bite, and can be quite helpful.</p>

            <p>TF is shorthand for &quot;Transformation&quot;. A lot of furries (like me) like it. Basically, TF is just what it sounds like- something becoming something else. I write a lot of stories about it.</p>

            <p>I would like to direct you to the Permission page of the PPC wiki.<br><br>The problem is, on the wiki, it is advised that you wait a few weeks to let people get to know you before you try for Permission. <br><br>If I&#39;m correct, it&#39;s only been a few days. You joined the day before New Years Eve.<br><br>The other problem is, tge wiki also makes note that mission-writing isn&#39;t our whole deal. Like I said when you first joined, hanging out on the board makes you just as valued a member as mission writing. If you&#39;ve only joined to write missions, it makes me think that you need more time to settle in and really honestly learn about the PPC. Hey, I&#39;m still a rookie too. I can help you if you need it. <br><br>I&#39;m no Permission-giver. But, they&#39;ll likely have a similar thought.<br><br>Relax; make some friends. Plug some writing work! Read missions, volunteer for group writes, make an MST! Save Permission for when you&#39;re truly comfortable and ready to go for it. We can wait, honest!</p>

            <p>Ah, but I don&#39;t have an iPhone. The phone I was originally using was a Samsung Illusion, and it died on me.

            <p>You remind me of me a month or two ago. Questions are loverly things, don&#39;t worry; I think the others like the chance to refresh their knowledge.<br><br>I would say run any potential agent by a beta reader/character tweaker or two - just to be safe. Sometimes it can be difficult to know how a character will be received when you&#39;re the only one guessing. I know when I created Gilbert and Fiona, it was in an IRC conversation with Riese, LilacLielac, and a few others all offering tips and pointers on everything from their names to their personality quirks! I image the same would work with any preexisting character; heck, it might even make a preexisting character <i>stronger</i>, in the sense that his or her personality and overall characterization are more believable to the typical reader.<br><br>Also, &#39;agent&#39; doesn&#39;t always have to be capitalized; when it&#39;s a title (such as in Agent Bobby Flay or Agent Nina Tambourine, neither of which exist to my knowledge), then it should be capitalized because a title is a proper noun (it&#39;s the same reason you write &#39;Officer Hicks&#39; rather than &#39;officer Hicks&#39;; in this case, &#39;Officer&#39; is the person&#39;s title, which is sort of like part of their name - at least, that&#39;s how I always remember it).<br><br>But when you&#39;re just referring to the job, or discussing creating a character with that job, then you just type &#39;agent&#39; (sort of like how you write &#39;Ten officers arrived on scene&#39; instead of &#39;Ten Officers arrived on scene&#39;; in this case &#39;officers&#39; is a regular noun, so it doesn&#39;t get capitalized.)<br><br>Hope this was helpful! :D</p>

            <p>Oh, we all have probably like several hundreds of OCs between ourselves. It&#39;s perfectly fine if you want to go that route.<br><br>And to help allay your fears about being annoying? You&#39;re not - it&#39;s perfectly fine to have questions that need answering, or even just to be overly chatty like me.<br><br>But, one thing you need to know now: You should keep your topic count to two at max. I got a warning once for having four running threads. It&#39;s out of courtesy to other boarders with pressing issues of their own, and it keeps things tidy and manageable on the board.<br><br>If you REALLY need to post another question, don&#39;t feel too bad about hijacking a thread that doesn&#39;t seem to be going anywhere, or has already had its problems resolved. We do it all the time, and it&#39;s a lot easier than constantly making threads.</p>

But it was still fun to read - and not just because I am a fan of long descriptive bits, no sirree. I absolutely didn&#39;t put little bookmarks into the descriptions of Calypso&#39;s pretty island or the shiny sword or anything...<br><br>Conversely, though, long <i> badly-written </i> descriptive bits become so much worse and yet so much more fun to make fun of.

            <p>Of course lavender is encouraged (I think.) The PPC approves of everything from lavender to violet! As long as it&#39;s, you know, readable and not over-the-top, and the thing being described is worthy of description. Describing an amazing sunset over a huge waterfall in flowery language is absolutely fine, as long as it fits with the piece&#39;s style and that point in time. Describing in great detail the thread count of your character&#39;s jeans is not. And be sure that the description fits with where you are in the plot, too - don&#39;t go describing the sparkly water if you&#39;re in the middle of a pitched battle... Unless you&#39;re juxtaposing the two, I guess? The point is use your best judgement.  <br><br>A clothing description can work in certain cases, like for very special clothing - maybe if a character is about to be sacrificed, then the ceremonial clothing would work - or for if the character is unused to that kind of clothing, like a Fae appearing in elaborate, battle-scarred, rune-engraved war armor in front of a high-school student from a Small Town Where Nothing Ever Happens.<br><br>Alyxx&#39;s clothing descriptions were bad because they were boringly-written, completely unnecessary for the story, broke the flow, and made no logical sense as actual clothes. Also, at least one was just a palette-swap of a canon costume with glittery bits added - and it&#39;s clothing completely normal to Alyxx. So there&#39;s no purpose to it. </p>

            <p>So... would the paragraph below count as a good description of a character?<br><br>&quot;Jayden&#39;s black T-shirt and jeans were soaked. His normally-poofy black hair was equally drenched, now limp from the muddy water he&#39;d been thrown into by the school bully.

            <p>The description doesn&#39;t break the flow, and the bits about him being soaked take precedence over the details about his clothes. Plus, they advance the plot and inform the character. So it works. Something like this, though:<br><br>&#39;Jayden wore a black T-shirt with a grey skull picture and his favorite band&#39;s logo on it, paired with dark jeans and sneakers. He had poofy black hair and bright green eyes that were annoyed. <br><br>His clothes were soaked because he&#39;d been thrown into a puddle by the school bully.&#39;<br><br>...it&#39;s kinda obvious what&#39;s wrong with that, since the description breaks the flow and don&#39;t add anything. </p>

            <p>I just need to think of a way to make them all fit together. Hm. Maybe the sparkly waterfall is where she&#39;s being sacrificed... Perhaps she&#39;s got some special quality that makes her the necessary sacrifice to do X Magical Thing, and the Fae warrior wants to get to her first because she&#39;s on the opposite side of the sacrificers. Though the Fae can&#39;t be the always-good-and-pure, either, though I don&#39;t want both sides to require a sacrfice. Let&#39;s see, something that is not more &#39;moral&#39; or obviously good-er than being sacrificed... <br><br>Oh, idea for a game on the Board: People toss up little snippets (like those three there) and other Boarders have to work them into short passages!

            <p>That way they are literaly his toys, under his complete control. Cliche? Just a little, but it is effective. Since he is child like, perhaps he can even animate corpses/bring back the dead. Afterall, if they are his toys, surely he can fix them, right? Just some thoughts.<br></p>

            <p>Well, I guess I would need to know more about the type of dragon you are working with. Jumper, you are the dimension hopper, care to do the honors?<br>(Absolutely. There are several dragons throughout the multiverse. In classic legends and fantasy tales, they were the ultimate villain for any hero to vanquish. In fact, they were so powerful, it was considered legendary to put up a good fight against a dragon and LOSE. As with most fantasy, guess who changed that? The Hobbit, with Smaug, being defeated by a regular human from some small village, only becoming a hero after he killed it.  But that is beside the point. As for your villain, I need to know: how vain is he? He is a dragon god, but what kinds of dragons are there? Now, one idea is to make him have ALL the abilities of the dragon species, usually shown through their &quot;dragon breath.&quot; These are usually fire, ice, poison, or electricity, though water has shown up occasionally too. Also, is he closer to a european or Chinese dragon? Actually, most important of all, what continua is he from? Know this, and I can craft a baddie for ya.)<br><br>Also, yay, I got you chatting with your OC too! Use him to add flair to your post, as well as lampshade some ignorant statements of yours.<br>(So what, I&#39;m some pet now? A stupid pet from a video game that gives you bonus stats?)<br>No, of corse not, I was just saying that as a tool-<br>(So what, I&#39;m a tool now? Is that it?)<br>Jumper, you&#39;re not usually this aggressive. Sarcastic, yes, but not aggressive.<br>(So now you calling me out of character! HERE&#39;S OUT OF CHARACTER!)<br>AAAH!!! *fight breaks out, goodfeathers style*</p>

            <p>Well... uh...<br><br>(allow me to answer: Levia ain&#39;t from any of the usual continuities: he&#39;s part of an original story called &quot;Nornir- Fate Unwound&quot;. He&#39;s a European dragon. In that story, there are only three dragons: himself, his European brother Behemo, and his other brother, Seiz, who looks kinda like Quetzalcoatl from Aztec myth.)<br><br>Y-yeah. He&#39;s got pale blue scales, where Seiz has dark green feathers and Behemo has golden-brown fur. (Behemo is nice, and Seiz is a mystery, BTW.)<br><br>(He&#39;s pretty vain- he likes to turn humans into animals to be his slaves. But he sometimes feels guilty and fixes them back up, especially after he&#39;s gotten drunk. He says &quot;NEVER listen to me when I&#39;m drunk&quot; in his story.)<br><br>He has a LOT of abilities, though he&#39;s given Nicky Anderson, his Chosen One (also known as a Nornir), the ability to use ice and earth magic.<br><br>(Pleasure to meet you, Jumper.

            <p>In my NaNovel, the main villain is a megacorp called Prometheus, and they exist partially so I can write out really genre-savvy Evil Science people, of sorts. They have underground bunkers equipped underneath their legit facilities, have ridiculous safety measures that only get escaped in the first place by two magical girls who have never worked before (and who in Prometheus&#39; eyes shouldn&#39;t even be aware of each others&#39; existance) working together to make a semi-SEP field, and escaping by being absolutely unsubtle and ripping a chunk of lead wall out of the wall. They also will have very good employee treatment (if I ever write that Christmas-parody-Sue piece...) with excellent benefits, overall being a nice place to work. If, of course, you ignore that they kidnap teenage magical girls and perform experiments on them.<br><br>(Yeah, if you ignore that one thing that ended up traumatizing me, Sylvia, Claudia, Suleika...)<br>Rezia? How are you even here? Iliya is the one I wrote to be the author-talking-to-one!<br>(And that should stop me? And did you really need to have original helicopter designs that can rip magical girls like us to shreds? Even if they do fall apart when you twist the metal into them into a knot.)<br>Well, I asked for help from Sergio Turbo, and he is studying that sort of thing, and they are very useful. Besides, if I didn&#39;t have a serious villain, how could anyone take the story seriously? Your metal-powers would be kinda story-breaking otherwise.<br>(Really. So, who are these guys anyways?)</p>

            <p>Sounds like you&#39;ve got a magical girl Bond villain going, there. &quot;GRR! Why do my extensively complicated and pointless traps and countermeasures fail me?!&quot;<br><br>My villains... tend to be horrible bastards.<br><br>Case in point: Chronicles of Zeyr&#39;s main antagonist, Councilman Gangaiza.<br><br>You know the trope &quot;Kick the Dog?&quot; Well, Gangaiza hasn&#39;t stopped kicking the dog since I first designed his character.<br><br>To start, he ascended to the King&#39;s Council by kidnapping the Chairman and murdering him. After that, he corrupted the council and ran the incumbent Prince off the throne and took it for the council&#39;s self, effectively turning a strong kingdom into a tyrannical republic. <br><br>Next, he outlawed all mages not appointed by the council, and disavowed recognition of the established government of Sanctuary, the chief mage stronghold. Then, he kidnapped Sanctuary&#39;s revered Prelate, the strongest mortal outlet of magic in existence, and tortured her relentlessly until her magic revealed his future to him, where a group of ex-cons hunted him down and killed him, thus leading to mass racism, arrests for nonexistent crimes, and executions, the most notable being nine criminals who had done nothing wrong whatsoever, but managed to escape. <br><br>After that, he went to the leader of the military elite, Adecor Demara, who had been standing in for the arrested General Kraig Lescarr, and brainwashed him into killing his own wife after his son Denestra - one of the nine criminals - had been arrested, so that she wouldn&#39;t be able to fight back by declaring her husband unfit for duty and leading the Vanguardians to Gangaiza&#39;s door, and so that her son would hopefully lose the will to fight. <br><br>Next, he began construction of the Omega Rod, which was the ultimate mechanical conductor of magic, and claimed it to be a defensive weapon, right before using it in a test run to call down a lightning storm on the Isle of Kai&#39;Ni, effectively destroying the First Kingdom of Elvenkind.<br><br>The list goes on and gets more and more horrible, such as mass-killing the Eldraec - immortal protectors of the world - leaving all but three of them remaining, torturing the strongest allies of the Champions - now reduced to five, from twelve - until they fell into a protective amnesia to block out the pain, thereby rendering them useless to the cause, and mass-killing pretty much the whole main cast at some point, from death only a few manage to return. <br><br>All this eventually culminates in the end of the world, forcing the mass majority of humans and elves to relocate to friendly alien worlds by the strength of their primative space programs.<br><br>So, yeah. My villains tend to leave people Not Amused.</p>

            <p>The &#39;traps&#39; usually work quite well, actually. When they captured a group of MGs, they did it by shooting them with snipers, taking advantage of the fact that the MGs have a pain-sharing thing - <br><br>(Yeah, thanks for that. It really helps my psyche to know exactly how badly my friends are being tortured.)<br><br>Shut up. And they used grenades and the like, and used metal-less weaponry since Zia can sense it and manipulate it. And really, in pretty much every other situation their measures would work very, very well. And, after the last battle with them in the NaNovel, they do know that at least three groups of magical girls are now working together, so they&#39;ll be preparing for a bunch of teams coming at once.<br><br>(Oh, that&#39;s comforting. Pretty much our only advantage was surprise. Couldn&#39;t you give us a name of someone to assassinate?)<br><br>Um, no. Anyways, the individual people of Prometheus are probably quite nice - they&#39;re friendly with each other, they tease each other. And the heads of Prometheus have probably spread some propaganda of some sort through the ranks, either dehumanizing the magical girls that are experimented on, saying that it&#39;s for the best in the end [ie, wouldn&#39;t it be great if we could figure out the healing factor that they have? What about the apparent ability to create energy from thin air or &#39;the power of friendship?&#39;] or similar.<br><br>So, Prometheus is the main villain. They&#39;re supposed to be competent, but not uber-evil, because that&#39;s rather counterproductive. They see the magical girls as very, very unique lab mice, I think.<br><br>(And there&#39;s also the assorted monsters you toss in. Though at least we haven&#39;t had to deal with any overarching villain organizations sending them yet.)<br><br>For now. Suleika&#39;s magical symbols had to have been stolen and corrupted into monsters by <i> someone </i> right?<br><br>(Screw you.)<br></p>

            <p>Ah. So, it&#39;s kind of more of a villain with a sympathetic goal, rather than Bond Villain. Okay, I see where this is going now, I think.<br><br>Still though, your villain is a heck of a lot more reasonable than Gangaiza. I swear, when I let go, I can make some horrific things.

            <p>(Oh please, the day those guys qualify as &#39;good&#39; will be when our system of magic stops having creepy side effects.)<br><br>It&#39;s not really that bad. For the magic system&#39;s backstory it makes perfect sense...<br><br>(You still make us feel each other&#39;s pain, made it nigh-impossible for me to get ANY sleep, give us what is basically schizophrenia, and rewrite parts of our brains.)<br><br>All of which had a point back in Amneris&#39; day. Anyways, Prometheus as a whole is about as sympathetic as, well, most other megacorps that have less-than-moral ways of running things. They are probably a mixture of those above megacorps and CADMUS from the JLU cartoon (note that I have not seen all of JLU, so this is a generalization.) They still have human experimentation as one of their major things.<br><br>On the other hand, they are supposed to be fairly genre savvy and pragmatic. They&#39;re the kind of people to make the Evil Overlord List and its various spinoffs required reading (well, not officially, but someone probably posts copies in the cubicles). The puppy-kicking one who beats up test subjects and tortures them pointlessly would get fired immediately (possibly literally depending on how much he knows and how badly he screwed up.) Illusions that don&#39;t cause lasting harm over giant Aperture death-traps, keeping the subjects healthy through IVs and SCIENCE over than locking them in cells. There are probably a few scientists with screws loose (there&#39;s a GLaDOS expy somewhere, I just know it) but they are being watched to make sure nothing goes into the Complete Monster territory.<br><br>(Except for that those illusions still cause psychological damage and the girls are being held against their will and treated like test rats.)<br><br>The individual workers are more &#39;misguided good/normal people.&#39; They are friendly to each other, they have families, they chat and poke fun at each other, they complain about their bosses. To them, it&#39;s a job, and actually I&#39;d bet that a large portion of the employees don&#39;t even deal with magical girls on a daily basis, or do so only with them as cargo or something. And the ones who get bothered by it will be-<br><br>(Shot?)<br><br>No, because that would make everyone else suspicious and would waste good talent. They&#39;d get sent to psychs who would listen to them and reassure them. Heck, if it&#39;s a problem that is one to Prometheus, it might actually be fixed if it&#39;ll in the end add to their goal.<br><br>(Comforting.)<br><br></p>

            <p>I keep getting &quot;I know who you are thinking of, but I believe this is not for children&quot; on completely safe for work things, like Adam Savage and the main character of this really unknown duo of books, <i>Green Angel</i> and <i>Green Witch</i>. It also guessed Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler when I was thinking of Twoflower, so it was in the general vicinity (Same book series, but I&#39;m not sure if the two have ever met), but not what I consider close.<br></p>

He did.)<br>Octavia (my first true attempt to get him. It did not work.)<br><br>Try your luck if you want, he is realy, realy good.

I&#39;m not sure if I know them well enough to try, but if someone else thinks they can try, why not throw it his way?

            <p>So, if you will look a few threads below, I recently got into a discussion with Basil Pasta about descriptive bits, and used three examples of what might deserve long prose describing it. And then I realized that I wanted to write a story involving all three, and that figuring out how to fit together a couple random snippets was fun and a bit hard. So, shall we play?<br><br>Basically, you write a short piece - a standalone or an excerpt from a larger story that hasn&#39;t been written yet - involving various snippets. Or, if you can&#39;t think of any, you can put up your own examples for others to try and write around! Either works.<br><br>So, the first three that I used for Basil are:<br>A gorgeous sunset over a sparkling waterfall <br>A battle-scarred Fae warrior in rune-engraved armor<br>A sacrificial costume<br>I&#39;ll be posting a piece involving these three later on (I hope)<br><br>And three more:<br>A girl who is the incarnation of the Snow Queen of Hans Christian Anderson&#39;s story<br>A blade forged in underwater volcanoes<br>A community of dryads in the California redwood forests.</p>

            <p>The waterfall sparkled as the orange sunset highlighted it with its calm glow.

Then his eye was painlessly hit with a sliver of glass, and his entire view changed<br>The orange glowing waterfall looked brown and ugly. The plants lying around him were weedy and evil looking. Then something completely unexpected happened, as the now muggy air turned fresh and cold, and snowflakes started falling. Dylan looked into the distance and saw a sled carrying a pale girl with long blond hair towards him. She smiled,and Dylan forgot the beauty that had been the waterfall, the girlfriend he had loved, and his entire life. In an almost zombie state, he joined the beautiful girl on the sled.<br><br>So a gorgeous sunset over a sparkling waterfall and shirk who is the reincarnation of the Snow Queen. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll use these three prompts:<br><br>A sudden escape<br>A hectic conflict<br>A chance meeting<br><br>---<br><br><i>(Sudden escape)</i><br><br>Kraig Lescarr had stiffened without warning, and his eyes seemed to lock in one position. His stillness drew the attention of the eight other prisoners.<br><br>It was almost as though he was preparing for something.<br><br>And preparing he was, as an ear-ringer of an explosion blasted through the silent forest. The cart seemed to be ripped away into a firey oblivion at every angle, and the nine occupants were thrown in every direction, some slamming into trees; others, the ground.<br><br>As the heavily dazed and confused prisoners tried to recover their senses, a second explosion sounded off, and every manner of weapon spun through the air.<br><br>Seth Beldan looked up as his sword nearly impaled him at the neck, and stumbled back, only to be clobbered by his incoming shield, which then bounced heavily against his armor, thus rendering him momentarily breathless; not for long, however, as he sprang forth and grabbed his weapon, then slid his arm through the straps of his shield and ran as fast as he could.<br><br>Denestra looked and saw Seth run past, but was knocked back onto his face as a third explosion went off, sending a piece of a wheel through the air that slammed into the back of his head. He was frighteningly still.<br><br>Seth&#39;s heart nearly stopped as he watched the boy, young enough to be called his son, go down and stay there. But, as he shouted Denestra&#39;s name and made to turn around, his arm was wrentched by Juden Praes.<br><br>&quot;No! Leave him! If he isn&#39;t moving, there&#39;s nothing we can do for him!&quot; The ex-soldier then shouldered his massive sword and ran quickly after the retreating, broadsword-carrying form of Kraig Lescarr.<br><br>Seth found himself torn between running and staying back to try and drag Denestra, but was eventually forced to realize that Juden, sadly, was correct, and ran.<br><br>---<br><br><i>(hectic conflict)</i><br><br>Azin Realgia watched as the explosion within the gates triggered the guards, who opened the heavy portal and werenspeared immediately by arrows fired by Iris and Drake. Immediately, the mercenary charged in with sword drawn. The first soldier he saw found a sword through his back as Azin stabbed him from behind, then kicked him away in time to knock the knife out of the hands of his next foe - actually, he simply removed the man&#39;s hands altogether, but those were just details, right? Besides, by the time that argument could be made, he had already offed six more foes.<br><br>Drake and Ris seemed to have a problem with constantly being surrounded. Drake was trying as hard as he could not to use his secret alternative weapon, but he was running out of arrows, and the time it would take to draw his boot knife could be fatal. And it seemed that every man he killed was instantly replaced. On the other hand, Ris was very much abusing his powers to create doppelgangers as distractions so that he could snap necks from behind.<br><br>And as for Iris - well. Fate had finally decided that it remembered it hated her, and she was suddenly holding off twelve soldiers and three commanders on her own. For each one she damaged, another would try and swing, forcing her to dodge quickly, and then block the next combatant in the very same instant. <br><br>Iris didn&#39;t know her arms bent certain directions on their own.<br><br>---<br><br><i>(chance meeting)</i><br><br>Sinclair walked slowly towards the tree. He was certain the noise had come from there.<br><br>In the blink of an eye, he darted around the corner and found the barrel of a rifle in his gut.<br><br>The man behind it was nearly faceless under his large, wool hood save for his mouth, and it was relaxed, as though emotionless. Small wisps of red hair poked out as well, and appeared ragged - like they were thinning and falling out.<br><br>Sinclair&#39;s eyes went to the rifle barrel against his stomach, and slowly looked up to the cloaked arms that were holding it. He could faintly see a sword at the man&#39;s belt, and could only imagine what other unpleasant secrets this stranger had up his sleeves - more literally than figuratively.<br><br>The hooded man pushed Sinclair back with his rifle. <br><br>&quot;Easy, mate,&quot; he nearly whispered, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to do anything stupid.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>So? Did I pass?</p>

            <p>&quot;Milady?&quot; the dwarf asked, frosted beard dragging along the icy ground as he ventured near the throne. &quot;The child is drawing closer.&quot;<br>The woman seated in the throne lurched up, raising one fine eyebrow and regarding the dwarf with clear blue eyes. &quot;Which child?&quot; she growled, voice like the howling wind of a snowstorm. Frissions of cold ran up and down the dwarf&#39;s spine and he resisted the urge to tremble.<br>&quot;The... the human girl-child,&quot; he said.<br>The woman rose fluidly from her throne, drawing herself to her full height. Her dark skin and hair contrasted with her pale furred robes, which sparkled and tinkled like a million small icicles. Slowly, imperiously, she strode down the steps of the throne to the now quaking dwarf, a trail of frost following in her wake. <br>&quot;You must stop her,&quot; she commanded in her icy, icy voice as one icicle-thin finger rested on his forehead, and the dwarf gulped and nodded. <br>&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; he said.<br>She smirked at him, almost wolf-like, and he could feel the beginnings of frostbite on his forehead from her touch.<br>&quot;It&#39;ll be your heart next if you don&#39;t,&quot; she breathed.<br><br>...okay that wasn&#39;t brilliant. I just had Jadis going off in my head, and I liked the idea of a contrast between her skin tone and her clothing.<br>Also, it&#39;s not entirely related to Snow Queen, I suppose, given that I more or less skimmed the tale, but yeah.</p>

            <p>Even if Hussie wasn&#39;t joking, it&#39;s sort of implied that Fruit Gushers are made from troll larvae. Probably the Fan Trolls before they had a chance to grow up. Given that, should we come across any Sue-Fan Trolls, we are free to murder them (and preferably turn them into Fruit Gushers) since they&#39;re breaking canon by still being alive. Also, Alternia blew up and Beforus was wipe out by the scratch, so all the Fan Trolls should have died anyway.</p>

            <p>Andrew Hussie rarely takes fan questions seriously, and it was a clearly sarcastic and joking answer.  Of course all fantrolls aren&#39;t really canon (and even if they were, they should all be dead: cf the destruction of the universe and everything...)<br><br>There are still godawful Homestuck Sues out there.  I don&#39;t see it as any kind of quarantining.

            <p>Hussie proclaimed Fantrolls canon to prove that he could introduce more trolls any time he wanted. The direct quote is:<br><br>&quot;Do we need twelve more? I mean, if I introduced twelve more trolls, I might as well introduce another hundred. Right?<br><br>Which might be fine??? Hey, who wants me to introduce a hundred more trolls? Any takers?

It has already been posted to FanFiction.net, however, so if I post it here, I might be advertising it instead of posting for beta-reading. So, is advertising, or linking fanfics here legal?

            <p>So, a few threads down, folks got to discussing some of the more... flashy ways that they&#39;ve killed a sue, either in a story of their own or as a PPC mission.<br><br>So: What stories, of your own or in the PPC, have you sporked where the sue was... er... worse than dead?<br><br>I&#39;ll post an example: A long time ago, I wrote a character who could control the fabrics of space and time. She turned out to be terrible, so I later wrote a self-spork where, much to the chargin of that particular character, an otherworldly assassin who travelled through ripples in the fabrics of reality (we&#39;ll call him Derek) appeared and challenged her to a fight.<br><br>End result: reality-warper assassin jumped through a time attack that called forth past and future clones of the sue, and used his sudden super speed (because the time attack slowed down the world to allow the clones to pop up seemingly instantaneously) to kill all the clones while they weren&#39;t expecting it, and then when the attack finished, the sue was too confused to see the assassin&#39;s hands grab her neck and snap it.<br><br>After that, he disappeared into nothingness and has since not appeared again.<br><br>As Lily put it earlier: LET US SHARE WAR STORIES. <br><br>Minus the destroying of tables with bleepka mugs, of course.

            <p>&quot;Well, Cyba has a couple of mini-Colossi,&quot; said Eagrus, taking the straw gratefully, &quot;but they mainly just prank you.&quot;<br><br>Cyba scowled. &quot;Like hacking your alcove while you&#39;re trying to regenerate and swapping which body your minds are in,&quot; she muttered crossly.<br><br>Eagrus snickered, and Zouh the mini-Hun poked his head out from under the trailing fabric of Eagrus&#39; helm to see what the fuss was about.<br><br>&quot;Oh yes, and this is Zouh,&quot; Eagrus introduced him. &quot;He&#39;s rather useful; we watch each other&#39;s backs. Now, there are two problems with Phi&#39;s minis: one, they&#39;re mini-Stus, and two, they&#39;re Borg... properly.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What he means to say is that one of them stung him - not that they&#39;re powerful enough to do much - but it made Eagrus even more paranoid than he is usually,&quot; expanded Phi. &quot;Of course, that side of them cancels out the &#39;Stu part nicely - well, with a bit of training - but Eagrus has this whole thing about tech and...&quot;<br><br>&quot;And I am trying to forget about the mission we just acquired them from,&quot; said Eagrus pointedly.<br><br>&quot;Hey, it spawned us too!&quot; put in Sigma and Phi.<br><br>&quot;Yes, Cyba raised to the power of three, but driving me at least ten times as crazy,&quot; muttered Eagrus.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but Eagrus, you have to admit that we did a good job with that &#39;Stu,&quot; said Cyba.<br><br>&quot;And then there was what came after,&quot; mumbled Eagrus, before resignedly downing his drink as fast as he could to numb the tale that was probably coming.</p>

            <p>&quot;No, I&#39;m not talking about it any further,&quot; declared Eagrus. &quot;I&#39;m trying my best to forget.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s interested now,&quot; pointed out Phi. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t do to disappoint him and not continue.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not revisiting it,&quot; said Eagrus stubbornly.<br><br>&quot;Then you&#39;d best shut your ears,&quot; advised Cyba, and began the tale.<br><br>&quot;Eagrus and I work for the Department of Technical Errors, so it&#39;s our job to go deal with bad spelling, missing punctuation and ugly grammar. It&#39;s mostly been exorcisms since I joined, but we had this Star Trek Gary Stu - you know the drill: best captain ever, gets off with every woman going, single-handedly takes on hoards without getting so much as a scratch - all the usual. Thing is, there was not much as one line of description attributed to him with regard to character or appearance, and he brought with him some really interesting spellings...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Borg cubed,&quot; snickered Phi and Sigma.<br><br>&quot;One of which raised the Borg to the power of three,&quot; continued Cyba, &quot;including one of the agents sent to deal with the &#39;Stu.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hence us,&quot; said Sigma and Phi cheerfully.<br><br>&quot;Unfortunately for him, in his course of sending pretty much every canon character wildly OOC and thrashing every &#39;bad guy&#39; he came across, I noticed a little something about his powers - immunity to weapon fire, extreme strength... Well, about the point the list expanded to surviving space without a space-suit, I had this little idea about how to weaken his unbeatable combat skill such that we could finish him.&quot;<br><br>Sigma and Phi snickered again.<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s say that I - er - may have tricked him into thinking he was Borg, such that his plot-warping abilities coupled with no description started - um - actually turning him into one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Having a powerful hive mind invading your thoughts can be VERY distracting,&quot; pointed out Phi.<br><br>&quot;So we managed to pin him down, charge him and throw him into a recycling vat,&quot; finished Cyba.<br><br>&quot;We figured the Borg didn&#39;t deserve a fate worse than death,&quot; explained Phi.<br><br>&quot;And we pinched his ship,&quot; added Sigma. &quot;Still have it, incidently.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And then canon snapped back into place; Cyba, Sigma and Phi lost control and nearly assimilated me, and THEN I had to fly the flaming space-ship while being chased by very much in character undead villain tech monsters...&quot; ranted Eagrus.<br><br>&quot;I thought you weren&#39;t going to remember that,&quot; mused Sigma.<br><br>&quot;He was going to ask sooner or later,&quot; Eagrus grumbled. &quot;Might as well get it over with. Just don&#39;t remind me in the morning.&quot; He produced another couple of coins. &quot;SC, you got any more of these?&quot;<br><br>Cyba, Sigma and Phi exchanged glances, then started on their coffee.</p>

            <p>&quot;I can definitely say getting punched through a wall by a jumpy as hell Eldric War-Prince hurts a lot less than what you had to go through, although if that motherf***er ever hits me again, I&#39;ll unmake him out of existence,&quot; SC said. &quot;I do have one of my own, though. A mix of Assassin&#39;s Creed and my own tomfoolery.<br><br>&quot;So, once upon a two years ago, I decided to write a fanfic. Mistake number one was that I was writing a fanfic, and mistake number two was letting Glasses and Specs - don&#39;t mind the names, it&#39;s what they call themselves; I have to babysit eight of these guys - help me write it. You know, because two fanbrats of the AC continuum are totally going to stick to the canon, right?<br><br>&quot;Well, I get going in the Brotherhood period, when Desmond was beginning to see Animus-ghosts due to the trauma of being forced to live the memories locked in every molecule of his mind. At the time, I had no clue how to comprehend Revelations because AC2 had stuck mainly to Italy, and I pretty well knew the lay of the land by then. So, cue Monteriggioni, pre-you-dun-got-raeped-by-da-Borgias.<br><br>&quot;Pretty much, Ezio was doing his usual thing - being completely unmatched both in war and sex. Problem: fricken&#39; Specs had convinced me to make an OC Assassin that &quot;helped&quot; Ezio out. And right like that, Stefanio di Roma was born.<br><br>&quot;I guess Specs believed that all white-hooded people were automatic super-badasses, because this guy could match Ezio blow for blow. Of course, all he ever did was counter-attack - fitting for a game-verse AC fic.<br><br>&quot;So blah blah blah, Monteriggioni gets screwed over royally by the Borgias, thank you Cesare, and Ezio and Stefanio wake up in Rome. Of course, Rome is pretty accurately portrayed as being down on its luck, but that&#39;s about where it ends in terms of the fic being good.<br><br>&quot;All of a sudden, Stefanio starts showing up Ezio in everything. Got a new base? Mine now! Your sister and mother run the local strip joint? Nope! Bartolomeo D&#39;Alviano is the mercenary commander? Not in MY Rome! It gets worse and worse until I finally decide enough is enough and go in to end it.<br><br>&quot;Well, that&#39;s all well and good, but what is Ezio if not a walking tank with a squad of other walking tanks? And, since this is only half my fault, I can only use half my full power, so disguises are in order. I disguise myself as a Borgia sniper - it makes sense because I suck at close quarters. Glass Cannons are like that. We can&#39;t take a punch, but Aeldra help you if you find yourself on the wrong end of our weapons.<br><br>&quot;Which Stefanio did. It almost seemed too easy to pick him off, despite him being with Ezio, who should have alerted to me the second I aimed my rifle and put a bullet of his own in my skull. But, he didn&#39;t, and my shot damn near took Stefanio&#39;s head clean off, and with medical assistance being somewhat shoddy in the Renaissance... you get the idea. He died.<br><br>&quot;Reality snaps back in then, and all of a sudden holy crap, I&#39;m surrounded by nothing but white hoods! Ezio called in the cavalry on me because I killed a nameless assassin he had never met, but who was still an assassin nonetheless. I had just enough of my powers left to run like hell and get back out to the real world, but man if it didn&#39;t wipe me out.&quot;<br><br>SC drank some water. &quot;Long story short: I don&#39;t tamper with the AC continuum anymore.&quot;</p>

            <p>Captain Navare walked over to the bar as well, talking animatedly with the black-armoured woman beside him. They were an odd pair: he was tall, heavily-muscled and blue-haired, and wore a slightly modified <i>Nanoha</i>-verse Barrier Jacket (slightly modified as in &#39;a normal one with a lot of spikes&#39;); she was short, thin, and her black armour, cape and mask hid her whole body.<br>“So, you see, Orchid,” he said, “my magic is more like math than anything else. That&#39;s why back home genius magi are also usually math genii.”<br>The woman shook her head. “Truly you come from a weird world, Navare.”<br>Navare opened his mouth to reply but noticed Ari. “Order me a cup of beer, will you?” he asked his partner and turned to the ex-Sue. His partner nodded and caught SC&#39;s attention by rapping her fingers on the bar.<br>“You,” she told him, “please give us a mug of beer and a cup of your cleanest water.”<br>Navare, meanwhile, saluted. “Ma&#39;am! May I offer my assistance, ma&#39;am?” he asked Ari.</p>

            <p>Her...? Her...? The word echoed through the mage&#39;s head, and he began shaking uncontrollably. Partly from fear, partly from rage.<br>&quot;I might do a better job of explaining... if it is fine with you, Orchid,&quot; he said, thankful for the change of subject. The black-wearing woman nodded, and he continued. &quot;Orchid has some enchanted items - her weapons, her armour - but she also seems to be inherently magical. Look; Avegaar, if you will.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; the Device said, a light pulsating inside the ring&#39;s gem in time with its speech. It displayed a complex diagram - Ari would recognise it as a mana emission test&#39;s results - in the air above it.<br>&quot;As you can see, Orchid&#39;s body produces something that is equiv. to mana,&quot; Navare said. &quot;However, she does not seem to have a Linker Core...&quot;<br>At that moment, a certain duo - an Elf wearing green clothes and a human wearing an ankle-length, grey longcoat - entered the bar and walked up to Ari, Navare, and Orchid. Navare saluted, and Des (for that was the human) returned the gesture before taking a seat at Ari&#39;s other side. &quot;Hello there,&quot; he said.<br>Anebrin, banging his sword&#39;s sheath so it would shut up, sat at Des&#39; other side, saying nothing.</p>

            <p>&quot;I... kinda overused my magic. By, uh, all of it. There was this Sue, see, and she was overpowered so much that literally every battle was &#39;Nova kills everything that moves.&#39;&quot; Ari glanced out of the corner of her eye, and pitched her voice lower to keep Navare from hearing. &quot;Navare over there was recruited from the same fic. Nova&#39;s mooks cut off his arm to &#39;restrain&#39; him even though every single minute made it clear that the people Navare sided with - the Nanohaverse people - were absolutely outclassed and used wimpy magic. He still managed to take out one of them, though,&quot; she added. <br><br>She sighed. &quot;Anyways, we managed to knock out some of her tech, so I went sword-to-sword with her. Since my blade&#39;s magic, I had to keep focusing it thinner and thinner, while pushing more magic into it, so that it&#39;d be sharp enough to actually cut her, but Sonnenstrahl - my sword- really wasn&#39;t designed to do that, so it was breaking apart in my hand the longer I went on, and Nova still outclassed me in raw power. I had to fuse myself with an incredibly hastily-made program to stay alive. Still, it was absolutely worth it when I chopped off her arm.&quot; Ari grinned. &quot;Managed to impale her, too. And then, right at the last second, I managed to focus one of my massive Buster spells into a sphere the size of a penny and explode it inside her. Of course, I was standing right next to her.&quot;<br><br>Ari grimaced in memory. &quot;So I basically ended up in a hospital bed for days. My magic&#39;s still recovering, but if I use too much of it I might end up crippling my ability to use it ever. So I can&#39;t go on missions right now, and I&#39;m shuffling papers.&quot; <br><br>She shook her head, clearing her thoughts. &quot;Heroic Spirit, huh? I&#39;ve only ever seen the Nasuverse through Carnival Phantasm and Prisma Illya. Must be handy to be immune to magic, though. Once I get to actually test out whatever I can do now, I&#39;d like to spar with you.&quot;</p>

            <p>Having lost Ari&#39;s attention, she drank her water, taking care that no-one will see what&#39;s beneath her hood, and observed the tavern. It seemed that there was an Elf that was trying to drink herself to oblivion... the Orchid shrugged.<br>Des, meanwhile, waved at Mike. &quot;Hi there. I&#39;m Des,&quot; he said. &quot;Y&#39;know, you look awfully similar to Jeanne D&#39;arc. Or to the Nasuverse version, anyway.&quot;<br>Navare saluted again and introduced himself. &quot;Captain Navare, formerly of the Time-Space Administration Bureau, now of the PPC,&quot; he said.</p>

            <p>&quot;Isn&#39;t that from Game Theory? The one that Mei used?&quot; She asked. She looked at Mike. &quot;Nanoha-verse magic is mostly built around math, and while you can cast some spells without them, all the equations you have to keep constant in your head makes it hard. So the AI does it, and if they&#39;re Intelligent they can advise you for tactical decisions and such.&quot;<br><br>She moved her cane so Mike could get a better look at it. &quot;I use Belka.

            <p>&quot;Well, first off it&#39;s a version of an already-weird canon artifact called Schwertkruez. Now, that artifact works in the Belkan style of magic, which involves cartridges that give short bursts of power, but the Schwertkruez doesn&#39;t, and it only has one combat mode, when nearly every other high-quality Device has three. Even in canon it&#39;s weird, which makes sense as it&#39;s a part of a unique artifact.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sonnenstrahl started out as a copy for that artifact, but one with a couple combat modes. So it&#39;s weird. Understand?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;The Schwertkruez does. The Belkan system of magic involves compressing magic into a cartridge, like a bullet, before a battle. In the battle, you use a cartridge and it releases magic, giving you a boost. Plus, the Belkan system is designed for melee combat. But the Schwertkruez doesn&#39;t use cartridges, it has only one mode, and uses long-range spells, so it&#39;s a weird device for Belkan magic. Sonnenstrahl was originally a duplicate of Schwertkruez, but one with a bunch of modes that could do any-range. Most of that&#39;s been blocked, though. I have a sword mode, a staff mode, and an ax mode for combat, and for non-combat I have this cane mode and a necklace mode.&quot;</p>

            <p>Trust me, all bronies who read your mission felt satisfied at Replacement!thou-hath-no-right-to-call-thyself-Dash&#39;s death. She was an abomination that needed to die. However, there are two that are better in my opinion.<br><br>Second best assassination would have to go to the &#39;Death by Poe&#39; one. I cannot remember spesifics, but I know they yanked her into one of Poe&#39;s poems, and the poetic justice delivered was nothing short of phenomenal.<br><br>However, the best has to go to the Cupcakes assassination of replasement!pinkamina. The struggle with this crazed pony murdering replacement thing, cumulating to a quick death, something the monster never gave. The way that was written; Rainbow Dash whimpering about how she wants to go home, the snap of the agents, one strugling to keep Rainbow alive while the other has to force himself to read the charge list and not kill her immediately, and finally ending with all but one poor pony thinking it was just a wicked party Pinkie threw that they could not remember. That was very emotional for me.<br><br>(Don&#39;t forget me. Pinkimena was going to be my worst enemy, one that no matter how hard I tried, because of the fanfiction and tumblrs, just would not die. Hundreds of lives on my hands, because I was unable to stop her. She would hunt me down, with all of the forth-wall and cartoon physics Pinkie has, and a bloodlust unmatched by any creature I have ever encountered. Then, this happened. Suddenly, she was severely weakened, her  source of power, gone. Further, I read the killing of THE Pinkimena, my most feard enemy. To say I cryed tears of joy...that would be the largest understatement I have ever uttered.)</p>

It is a pirates of the Caribbean mary sue fic where the Mary Sue is a prostitute (though she refuses to admit it) who falls in love with Bootstrap Bill (pre barnicalification, thank god) and is the &#39;mother&#39; of Will.

            <p>No, honestly, I don&#39;t know which is worse: the fact Aurora thought this was a good idea, or that so many people on Fim-fiction think it is also a grand idea. Kitty, this one is all on you. Have fun tackling this beast that refuses to die.<br><br>My gut reaction is to kill it while it is weak, but let&#39;s keep this under surveillance until she&#39;s good and finished. After all, while it is dark, it may well not be bad, per-se. If it has acceptable grammar and a better story, (HA! Like that would happen) then it should just be left for you to rage at.<br><br>(However, if it IS as bad as Rainbow Factory, then I would be happy to offer my services against this foul beast.

            <p>...Rainbow Juicer was just not good! I have read good grim dark, and it just... was not. I started thinking about how the real Rainbow Factory would work, and the more I thought, the less sense it made. Plus, you and me are not the only ones who thought it was bad. Plenty of others did too. Now it sounds like they are going a more &#39;Cupcakes&#39; route, which is even worse! <br><br>*sigh* I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not about to rant against the author or the readers more than I already have. I&#39;m not going to say it to their face. It just seems that it is gore for the sake of gore, and if you want gore, put that in a different fandom, or at least put some effort into trying to make it sound logical that a pony would be gutting somepony up. But... That&#39;s just me. Perhaps it is a case of YKNMK, with more gore and less kink, but that does not help me against thinking that it is a bad story.<br><br>Happier news!

            <p>But I finally decided to post the first half of my <i>Warriors</i> mission, starring Gilbert Beckett and Fiona Darcy (and with some help from Agent!Caroline)!<br><br><a href="http://kitty-noodles.tumblr.com/post/39618756798/shadowclan-is-not-amused">&quot;ShadowClan is not Amused&quot;</a><br><br><b>Warnings:</b> The only thing that comes to mind is the swarm of minis my agents have already encountered.

            <p>I&#39;m waiting for the second part now. You really pinned down the ShadowClan cats&#39; personalities. I get rather annoyed with people&#39;s tendencies to turn them into B-movie villains instead of cats with their own personalities and (hostile) culture.<br><br>Dedicated Warriors agents should probably be carrying small digital voice recorders. One assumes that since the Warriors cats talk, they should be able to record their voices...? Or maybe, since cat language involves so much body language and not much noise, a video recorder would be needed?<br><br>What does Warriors do with cat romance, by the way? I know that in real life, cat romance simply doesn&#39;t exist--they just go into heat, mate, and go on with their lives; the closest cat relationship is the bond between friends, siblings, or mother and kitten. Does the series stay consistent with that, or do they add human-like pair bonding? Or do they just ignore it altogether? I&#39;ve only read a few of the books, and kittens seem to just belong to their mothers, with fathers mostly out of the picture.<br><br>By the way, you have a typo in &quot;...sent Sorrelpaw of to get Cherrystar...&quot; There&#39;s an f missing in &quot;off&quot;.</p>

            <p>Minis! They sound so cute! Can I have one? Or two? Maybe Firestars and Longwisker? (Longwisker sounds like...a stretch limo with vertical silver stripes to me, by the way. Not sure why). I promise to love them and feed them and take very good care of them...<br><br>Also, I read the mission--well, the half you posted, anyway--and it looks good :) I mean, the mission part looks good. The story looks...wretched. Good luck wading through the rest! It was interesting to see how agents would have to deal with cat disguises, and Agent Caroline&#39;s entrance was pretty funny :)<br><br>And of course, although I never thought about it, it definitely makes sense that the minis for the Warriors verse would be cars...I mean, other than that, I guess they could have been badgers, but cars work a bit better, I think. They&#39;re very characteristic of the continuum--because badgers are just a different (and hostile) kind of animal, but cars are giant metal *things* that go roaring down the roads.../end ramble</p>

            <p>That is impressive. Well, I too am a Percy Jackson fan, so have a celestial bronze weapon of your choise, depending on your fighting style. No, it is not enchanted, so don&#39;t expect Riptide. Do celestial bronze weapons kill sues? I hope so.<br><br>(Here, just in case they don&#39;t work on Sues, have the instructions for how to make Luke&#39;s sword, though be warned, it requires blood, a soul, and a fair amount of magic, so it probably won&#39;t work.

            <p>Most Percy Jackson Sues are demigods, so it stands to reason they could be killed by celestial bronze. Better yet, their <i>own</i> uncanonical celestial bronze weapon. Which will then be taken by the agents as a Suevenir, of course.</p>

            <p>Now I am going through all these shows I watched as a little guy. Blues Clues, which my mother loves still. Steve taught so much while having fun. Cyberchase, which if you remove most of the blatent &#39;we are teaching math!&#39; elements, is still a good show. Magic School Bus, my first science teacher, and arguably the best. Bear in the Big Blue House, from which I named my ever-disapearing dog Shadow, because of, well, Shadow. Others, slowly coming back. Man, good times as a little Jumper.<br><br>Then again, I would also stick around to catch House of Mouse, which was arguably the best thing the Disney Channel ever did. I watched a lot of cartoons as a kid.<br><br>But recently, I found an old disk case from when I was a kid. Pajama Sam, Spy Fox, and Put Put, all from Humongous. Carmen Sandiago, for whom I wrote my first, unknowing, fanfic. No, I do not have it, but I was about seven or eight when I wrote it, so there you go. Do you guys remember these games? How about other computer games from your nerdy youth?</p>

            <p>I still enjoy rewatching it. To think I used to watch it for the <i>science</i>, when the characters are really interesting. (There&#39;s actually a thriving teenage fanbase, mostly based around &quot;which of these kids will get with the other kids when they&#39;re in high school&quot; Ship wars galore.) <br>And Blue&#39;s Clues--over the summer, my sister and I babysat for a two year old girl, and we watched Blue&#39;s Clues with her. And we were laughing more than she was. Memories...</p>

            <p>The three main characters would be summoned into Cyberspace by the Motherboard, this cgi-d sorta-Zordon character, who would send them to thwart Hacker and his two minions, who would be messing around with something in Cyberspace. And it would be solved with math, though that kinda varied - I remember one of the episodes had tangrams, and another involved the black girl character beating this monk guy in a sorta-chess strategy game. <br><br>It also had a ridiculously catchy theme song that, years after I watched thee show, will still come into my head at the word &#39;Cyberspace.&#39;<br><br><a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9wfQ2KnCMJY"><a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9wfQ2KnCMJY">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9wfQ2KnCMJY</a></a></p>

            <p>I still do, actually.  It makes me so sad that it&#39;s not on regular TV anymore.  I think what I loved most was the ridiculous trouble they always had with the snack machine.  Zobooland was sweet too.  </p>

            <p>I do honestly plan to finish my MST and work on other ones. But, I&#39;m still just a little bit stuck, at least until I find a device with a proper word editor that I can utilize. The DS lacks such a feature.<br><br>And, there&#39;s the problem of Book Specs&#39; bathroom &quot;break&quot;...<br><br>Warning: Mild/strong language.<br>---<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s been in there since Thanksgiving. Thanks-f***ing-giving. I am not expected to believe that he&#39;s just constipated.&quot; Contacts crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow.<br><br>&quot;Yeah! He even missed out on our present giving at Christmas!&quot; Glasses&#39; bottom lip poked out sadly. &quot;I was gonna give him a scarf. Bifocals even helped me knit it.&quot; <br><br>Glasses held up the scarf and pouted dejectedly.<br><br>&quot;The only normal gift you would&#39;ve handed out, and it&#39;s to the guy who didn&#39;t even show up. Why am I not surprised?&quot; SC grumbled.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s kind of bullcrap, though? Come on, how constipated could he really be?&quot; Contacts asked.<br><br>&quot;It could happen. It&#39;s not like you guys are human, or anything,&quot; SC replied.<br><br>&quot;Still, he does have a point. The guy&#39;s been in there for almost two and a half months, something&#39;s up,&quot; Sports Shades said.<br><br>Specs didn&#39;t seem to hear. He was too busy cackling over Lego!Boromir&#39;s death by way of giant banana. Lego Lord of the Rings was proving to be very disrespectful of the more serious bits of the story - such as Frodo versus the Nazgul, wherein Frodo caught the morgul blade under his arm and pretended to be fatally wounded.<br><br>Izzy watched over Specs&#39; shoulder. He looked a bit thunderstruck by the blatant herecy of the game.<br><br>&quot;Tell you what, if Bren were here, that fancy miniature computer of yours would be right bally buggered,&quot; Izzy said.<br><br>SC opted to ignore the two and beat on the bathroom door.<br><br>&quot;Booky! Booky, it&#39;s been three holidays, now! I want you out of there by Spring Break, you hear?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh god, it burns like the fires of a thousand suns!&quot; Book Specs screamed, agonized.<br><br>&quot;I love that song, but we do not plan on installing another bathroom, got me?&quot; SC sighed and glanced back at the others.<br><br>By now, Sports Shades had joined in with staring over Specs&#39; shoulder. He cackled at the sight of Gandalf the White narrowly ducking an arrow and Gimli&#39;s thrown axe before turning Aragorn&#39;s sword into bananas.<br><br>&quot;Please come out! I have to deal with their sh*t on my own now! It&#39;s very difficult!&quot; SC sighed heavily. &quot;I should&#39;ve stayed in the tavern; they couldn&#39;t reach me there...&quot;<br><br>Book Specs, meanwhile, was reading quite comfortably on the toilet&#39;s pink fuzzy lid, having long since finished his business by this point. Now, he was just screwing with everybody.<br><br>It was glorious.<br><br>---<br><br>So, yeah. Complications.<br><br>Thankfully, his comeuppance will be just and well-earned when I drag him out kicking and screaming for the eventual part four.<br><br>In the meantime, I&#39;ll just have to put up with whatever new inevitable otherworldly threat comes up with just Specs and hope I don&#39;t get destroyed.<br><br>(Also, the song I was referencing was The Catalyst by Linkin Park. That band is among my top favorites, especially with their whole sci-fi gig.)</p>

            <p>Welcome back. My oh my, all these folks coming back. Do you think it is a sign of the worst fanfic we have ever faced? One that makes C*l*eb*ian and That Seres seem tame? Nah... I hope....<br><br>Anyway, sorry to scare yall like that. So you&#39;re irish? I must admit, I love irish culture and their people.<br>(Me too.

            <p>Well, one of you owes the other some bits, although I&#39;m not saying who. My earlier comment to Specs might just be a clue though... (by the way, pretty sure that &#39;Irish&#39; should always be capitalised). Of course, if you really wanted to bet the long odds, you&#39;d be placing bets on whether or not I&#39;m a real <i>samurai</i>.<br><br>I still have plenty of shamrocks and pints of Guinness over here, feel free to take one. <br><br>Hopefully we&#39;re not in for any more Legendary badfic, although I expect the recent Hobbit film is causing another fanfic-explosion, I haven&#39;t gone looking for any yet, but I&#39;m sure my curiosity will get the better of me soon. </p>

            <p>Thanks, but no, it&#39;s the Tekkaman Blade universe, specifically taking place during the Black September of Prague event that serves as a significant part of the backstory of several major characters, including the main villain, of Tekkaman Blade II.

            <p>That was a <i>very</i> impressive sample, Duo! I don&#39;t know the canon, so I&#39;ll have to give you the &quot;unless-someone-who-knows-it-contradicts-this&quot; clause. But just reading it at a surface level, your syntax is good, your hold on the English language is very good - your style flows well. The only thing that threw me off was the present tense - it was a little distracting form the narrative, at times. But otherwise, it was quite good. I like your agents as well - it&#39;ll be interesting to see Johnny, who reacts strangely to alien-ish life forms, deal with not only the PPC, but an Equestrian partner (I assume they&#39;re going to be partners?).<br><br>Anyway, in case this is too ambiguous thus far, permission granted!</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know much about the continuum, so I can&#39;t really help there. Your agents seem good, though I&#39;m kinda confused by Burning Heart. The fact that, as an adult, he&#39;s a blank flank seems weird - most adults do have them. You&#39;d think that, by the time he leaves home, he&#39;d have found something he&#39;s good at and realized it. Plus, the whole cutie mark thing is a big part of Equestrian society - an adult without one, even a young one, would be seen of as weird, and he&#39;d likely have some self-confidence issues about it.</p>

            <p>The cutie mark shows up when the pony who&#39;s earned it figures out their destiny - what they&#39;re best at and love to do the most. It&#39;s possible that an adult hasn&#39;t found his or her destiny yet; it&#39;s just never been done in the show.<br><br>As far as self-confidence, though, you&#39;re right, such a pony would probably be at least a little bit shy about the fact that they&#39;re a blank flank. On the flip side, since it&#39;s an adult with no cutie mark, he or she could also have grown used to blank flank comments by now and possess the maturity to handle the predicament more easily than, say, Applebloom does.<br><br>Just some thoughts.</p>

            <p>What firemagic is getting at is that it&#39;s good to point out and specify certain details like that, while still keeping to the point of your profile.<br><br>Like: SC wears glasses because he can shoot lasers out of his eyes, due to an incident involving comic book-style toxic waste. He also wears glasses due to somewhat poor vision.<br><br>(The toxic waste thing is total bull, but I&#39;m sure I could work it into SC&#39;s personality somewhere.)<br><br>The main idea is that SC wears glasses. The detail was he shoots lasers from his eyes, which I explained (bullsh*t my way through). I then returned to my main point.<br><br>You don&#39;t have to make it an essay, just give a reasonable explanation that you can build on later.</p>

            <p>Well, yes, the entire thing shouldn&#39;t be all about his blank flank, but that&#39;s not what I was saying. Right now, his cutie mark or lack thereof is the last sentence of the profile, and that&#39;s all it is. Something like a cutie mark is an important part of a FiM character&#39;s identity, and while a standard one like Kindheart&#39;s (the heart-and-cross) is normal for her profession and doesn&#39;t need explanation, a blank flank IS weird by the standards of this world. So it would make his character weird in ways that need to be examined more. His flank shouldn&#39;t take up the whole thing, but it should take up more than one sentence at the very end.</p>

            <p>A lot of agents could possiblt have self-confidence issues when first recruited.

            <p>But the self-identity of a pony does have a lot to do with their mark (or the other way around.) So while self-confidence issues are normal for HQ, Heart&#39;s (and I hope for entertaining bits with his name being confused with Dr Kindheart)lack of a mark should still have enough of an impact on his mind to show up in the profile, but it doesn&#39;t.<br><br>The lack of a mark is very rushed in, I think, and really shouldn&#39;t be. I expect you have plans for him to get his cutie mark in a mission, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, but I think his character&#39;s idea of why he doesn&#39;t have a mark needs to be explained more. Does he obsess over it? Does he try and pretend he doesn&#39;t care? Does he just not care at all and figures it&#39;ll come eventually? All that needs to be laid out.</p>

            <p>Well, I actually created the character for an RP a while back, with the idea of making a shonen hero-style pony OOCly influenced by things like Zettai Hero Project and History&#39;s Strongest Disciple Kenichi, in other words having him start out as a blank slate in terms of skills and abilities. To go along with that thematically, I also made him a blank flank. I did have a character arc planned out for him involving getting his cutie mark, but I&#39;m not sure how much of it I&#39;ll use in the PPC.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! I hope you have fun. I&#39;m sure you will, actually, because you thought we were funny. Since you appreciate our sense of humor, your newbie gift is some more recommended reading: the Official Fanfiction Universities. They are affiliated with the PPC and have a similar style and craziness level. The idea is exactly what it sounds like--a school for fanfiction writers, where they learn to write good fanfiction from their favorite canon characters.<br>The Lord of the Rings one is <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/644826/1/">here</a> and the Sherlock one is <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8083780/1/">here</a>.<br>Enjoy!</p>

            <p>So, Neshomeh and I are connected to a college anime and gaming group in Michigan that runs a family-friendly charity convention every year.  What do I mean by &quot;charity&quot;?  You do not pay to attend, and any money made through the con goes to the Relay For Life.  It is three days, Feb 8-10, of awesome that you don&#39;t have to pay to get into (beyond what you pay for lodging, travel, food, and impulse buying from the many vendors, of course).<br><br>&quot;That is amazing, Phobos, who is awesome and also very stylish,&quot; I hear you saying from...wherever you are able connect to the internet.  &quot;But where can I get information about all the cool stuff that is going to happen at this thing?&quot;<br><br>I can help with that.  Check this page out: <a href="http://almaconmi.com/index.html">The Convention</a><br><br>Some things that aren&#39;t on the web yet, due to some really bad luck with servers and whatnot, are the schedule and list of events, which they are finalizing right now.<br><br>However, I can tell you that I will be hosting two panels during the con and also hanging out, playing games, and generally being awesome.  So, that should have all of you planning on attending, right?<br><br>Right?<br><br>No?<br><br>Okay...<br><br>Anyway, if you happen to be in the Great Lakes region (or want to travel to the Great Lakes region), and have the time and resources to make it to the con, you should consider it.  It is a lot smaller than other cons, but that is actually a good thing.  It is a great con for people who have never been to a con before, and you can get some real interaction with the guests.<br><br>It is a lot of fun, and I hope that some of you can make it out.<br><br>-Phobos, Conman (That&#39;s the right word, isn&#39;t it?)</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a relatively centralized location (Seattle, Boston, Chicago), and a date/time that work for the PPCers in the area, and people show up as they can. Often, Gatherings are plotted around Conventions, as with the last Seattle Gathering, or take place when a PPCer is traveling near others, as with some of the British Gatherings.</p>

Double-Yay!<br><br>The two remaining are parts of potential series!

            <p>Hello, I am Mind Tool (sometimes prefaced with &quot;the&quot;) and I&#39;ve been occasionally lurking on and off for quite a while now. I look forward to getting to know this community better, but may not have the time for a while, so don&#39;t be surprised if I don&#39;t post for long lengths of time.<br><br>Like many of you, I am an amateur writer with hopes of getting better and a dislike of bad fanfiction. I&#39;ve already read TOS and OFUM in their entirety as well as the occasional mission released last year. At some point I may attempt to get permission, but not for a while.<br><br>My fandoms include: Star Trek, Firefly, Doctor Who, The Big Bang Theory, Sonic the Hedgehog, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Legend of Zelda, the writings of Isaac Asimov and countless others that I have forgotten to mention. I am partway through reading book IV of Steven King&#39;s &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series and am probably going to get into the Warhammer 40000 universe (through the dawn of war series). My favourite author is Isaac Asimov.<br><br>Once again, I&#39;d like to add that I really look forward to getting to know the community you have here.<br><br>P.S. I found this place through TV Tropes... just realised I needed to add that and couldn&#39;t find a suitable place to insert it earlier.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t seen much of Next Generation beyond a few movies and three episodes of season two, but I prefer it over the original series&#39; style in many ways. I haven&#39;t seen any Voyager at all, but plan on watching it at some point. Similarly, I haven&#39;t seen much of Enterprise and am slightly nervous about watching it given all the hate it gets, but I still plan on checking it out (if only to find out why everyone hates it). Finally, we get to Deep Space Nine, which is definitely my favourite out of what I have seen. I also enjoy Star Trek Online, although I haven&#39;t been on much lately.</p>

            <p>No, my name is actually from an early stage of an original fiction idea and is just something I kept from it because nobody else on the internet used it as a handle. The &quot;Tool&quot; in question is actually a sentient AI.

            <p>Hello, I&#39;m an aspiring fanfic author.  For awhile (some 7-5 years ago), I wrote truly terrible fanfiction, but had no idea, because all I got were generically positive reviews left by people who expected the same in turn.  Fortunately, I read my own work at the end of every year, and tend to recognize when it is truly bad.  However, knowing that it was bad didn&#39;t help me improve, so when, at 14, I finally recognized my first novel-length story as being terrible, I was so disheartened I stopped writing.  Last year, however, after years of not writing, I tried my hand at it again, and am finally producing work I feel I can be proud of.  Sadly, I&#39;m still somewhat hindered by only having a few reviewers who really review.<br><br>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to tear my most recent work to shreds and give me an objective criticism of what I&#39;m doing right, and, more importantly, what I&#39;m doing wrong.<br><br>Fair warning, as well: My work tends to be pretty NSFW.  It&#39;s not porn, but the violence can be fairly intense, I don&#39;t shy away from describing graphic injuries, and the source materials themselves are known for being pretty grimdark (one actually being the trope namer).  Sexual content in my work isn&#39;t prevalent, but it does show up, though not in actual sex scenes.<br><br>The fanfic I&#39;d like criticized is Ascendant Sun, Burning Moon.  It&#39;s a crossover of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Exalted, so ideally I&#39;d like someone familiar with both.  If not both, though, you should probably be at least familiar with Exalted, as I&#39;m told my story is more friendly to non-Buffy fans than non-Exalted fans.<br><br>Here is the link, and I thank you in advance for any aid you can offer: <br><br><a href="http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28231/InDrk+Ascendent+Sun+Burning+Moon.htm"><a href="http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28231/InDrk+Ascendent+Sun+Burning+Moon.htm">http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28231/InDrk+Ascendent+Sun+Burning+Moon.htm</a></a><br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Fenrir666/Indrk (depending on which site you find me on)</p>

            <p>First off, I don&#39;t know either canon. I heard about both, and I get the gist of BTVS, but know jack about Exalted.<br><br>In the prologue, we see both Buffy&#39;s, as well as some serial killer guy from the last century&#39;s exaltation (word?). That&#39;s good, as it establishes the connection between Buffy and Exalted.<br>We also see the club of ominous people talking about ominous fate things. This would be the point where you could establish further how the mechanics of the &#39;verses work in each others context, but the only thing we find out is that Buffy is a Solar Exalt(ed), which means that she could turn evil.<br>You say that you will explain things later on, but there&#39;s a difference between keeping things interesting and confusing everyone.<br><br>In the first real chapter, the first thing you do is to deny the existence of a character for... reasons. I think.<br>This chapter also seems more Buffy-centric, which sets the focus for the story. Thing is, if it&#39;s really Buffy with Exalted elements, then I&#39;d go and give some more exposition about how the latter works.<br>Also, you kind of run rampant with the POV switches. The Xander paragraph could have been cut (especially since it wasn&#39;t even truly his POV, or does he know Buffy&#39;s name by then?) and there&#39;s two Buffy parts right after each other.<br>In general, this is a chapter for Buffy fans to judge in terms of character interactions. Also, no matter what a few of your reviewers say, causing confusion in the reader is a bad thing.<br><br>From then on, things get too specific to say anything.<br><br><br>And by the way, on the topic of confusion: Do you want us to give you concrit, or do you want us to do a mission on this?</p>

            <p>Well, honestly, if you know enough about Buffy, you can get by.  It&#39;s just that, well...a well-done Exalted fanfic will at first seem like a well-written badfic.  Exalted is an RPG known largely for being ridiculously over the top and awesome, and the main &#39;heroes&#39; of it, the Exalted themselves, will seem like Mary Sues at first.  I don&#39;t think I can really explain it that well, so I offer you a link to the TVTropes page: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted</a></a><br><br>I recommend reading it just to check out Exalted.  It&#39;s a mega-awesome series of total coolness, and is just...well, check it out.  You&#39;ll like it, I promise.</p>

            <p>So I was perusing the wiki one day, when I noticed that Percy Jackson has no page. Which means, if it has no page, there was no badfic sporked. So I decided to look at Percy Jackson fics at fanfiction.net... yeesh.<br><br>Daughters of Poseidon and Zeus to the left of me, re-imaged Percy to the right, and shipping all around. As many bad Daughter of Poseidon or &#39;Percy&#39;s lost sister&#39; fic there are, one stood out to me. I WOULD add it to the Unclaimed Badfic list on the wiki, but it seems to be locked at the moment. So, here is: <br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3571363/">Daughter Of Time</a><br>Rated T, Romance &amp; Adventure<br>AU: Fem!Percy. Wouldn&#39;t things be more interesting and more dramatic if Percy is the daughter of Kronos? Torn between loyalty to her father or saving the world. Apollo/Fem!Percy. Luke/Fem!Percy. Percy harem.<br><br>A HUGE amount of the fic is stolen from the book word for word. There are some chapters are more original then the others, but you will still find direct paragraphs from the book slapped in. Rule 63 strikes Percy, but nobody else, simply so the author does not technically write slash. Oh, and she is not the daughter of Poseidon, but the daughter of Kronos, the Big Bad of the seres. This Mary Sue/replacement Sue controls time AND water, for some reason, is angry for no reason, and is NOT killed by the gods, and somehow gets one to love her. Her existence is a massive breach of cannon. If someone takes it, have fun. Grammar is bad too, but the spelling seems good, so she knows how to use spell check. </p>

            <p>Seriously, I read further, and my mind started to shut down. I think some of the Aura of Smooth seeped out of the fic and onto me, because I caught myself thinking once or twice, &#39;Well, it&#39;s not THAT bad. I mean, it could be worse...&quot; Then I hit myself over the with the Lightning Thief, saying (quietly, so I did not disturb the family) &quot;OUT DAMNED SUE!&quot; If the Sue had grabbed me, I was going to make sure she did not stay inside.<br>(You think he&#39;s kidding. He really isn&#39;t. He hit himself over the head with the book in a form of self-exorsism. It was supposed to be more of a ritual then anything, but it helped clear his mind and look at the fic for what it was. Trust me, I should know: I&#39;m living in his head.)<br><br>Anyway, in case it is not clear, I want this thing dead based off premise alone. However, I do not currently have permission, and do not feel that seeking permission at this time would be a good idea. I&#39;m not sure if I am a good enough writer, and I don&#39;t have a huge amount of free time at the moment. However, I would be highly interested in a co-write mission with someone who does know Percy Jackson, so I can get my feet wet, and perhaps get a feel for writing missions. Mostly though, I want the Sue dead.</p>

            <p>Stealing your thread to post this Hobbit Sue:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8846715/1/An-Unexpected-Companion">An Unexpected Companion</a><br>Rated T, Romance/Adventure.<br>A WIP from a rusty Fanfic writer. Kestrel, who&#39;s perfect life is nothing more then an act, comes across a mysterious necklace. By the lamp-light of the city, she is transported to middle-earth. Many adventures await, after the original quest to defeat Smaug and reclaim the lonely mountain, and mysteries to be uncovered. Thorin/OC, Fili/OC, Kili/OC. AU, Fluffy and T rated (for now)<br><br>So, the very first word of the story is a mini-Balrog, which really gives me <i>high</i> expectations of the rest of the story. And then it goes downhill from there with spatial-temporal distortions, Twoo Wuv At Fuhst Saight, and the very  very disconcerting notion that Thorin, Fili, and Kili had all somehow survived the Quest for Erebor. And that Bilbo would be totally up to visiting Erebor again despite, you know, nearly losing Bag End to his adventuring. <br>That&#39;s not even factoring in the Sue with her Deus Ex Machina necklace. </p>

            <p>He is very protective of his daughter, manipulating time to make sure she can evade danger. The moron of a Sue looked directly into Medusa&#39;s eyes because she was curious, and Kronos appeared AS A PHYSICAL BEING, and stopped her from turning to stone. I&#39;m going to say Kronos would be able to see agents, either because he is a Titan, or due to his lack of being chopped in hundreds of pieces and trapped in Tartarus in this fic making him a replacement too. </p>

            <p>So not only do we have to deal with the most powerful &#39;mortal&#39; to walk the earth, we also get to have fun with a being of divine power with the ability to manipulate time and a good chance that he see agents. One wonders if the PPC has any god killer weapons and/or ammunition available for use. On the bright side, we do have a good way to kill the Sue and get a nifty (or incredibly tacky depending on how the Sue is dressed) statue out of it.</p>

            <p>If Percy was the daughter of Kronos... and also had water powers which would mean that she&#39;s the daughter of Poseidon... Then the only &quot;logical&quot; explanation was mPreg... And Kronos doesn&#39;t actually have a physical body until the third or fourth book... So this makes no sense.</p>

            <p>Her grandmother is Tethys, the titaness of the sea. Ladies and gentleman, not only are the Titans, who both in cannon and in mythology are trapped in Tartarus and cannot escape, having demi-titan kids, but the gods don&#39;t bat an eye. Worse, she snares Apollo into loving her.<br><br>Annabeth is very OOC, becoming a touchy-feely emotional girl (if she gives a reaction at all) who acts more like a daughter of Aphrodite then Athena. At one point she becomes disgusted at the idea of killing somebody (Percy, due to being the child of Kronos, is to be killed if she acts up), despite the fact canon!Annabeth has been trained all her life to kill monsters like replacement!Percy, and in the final battle kills rebel demigods without hesitation.<br><br>Grover is pushed to the side as &quot;the goat who freaks out, but we don&#39;t really hear about even when he is freaking out.&quot; As such, he is fairly OOC, but not near as bad as Annabeth.<br><br>Then there&#39;s Apollo... This lovestruck loon picks up not only the luv bug, but the idiot ball, even forgetting the fact that he is an almighty god of the sun and could teleport out of a bad situation. Yeah. However, mission wise, he seems to have part of his canon self still inside him, as he gives these gems:<br>&quot;She was petite and delicate looking, long brown lashes framed beautiful golden-colored eyes and—<br>Whoa—Apollo stopped himself before he can go further. What was he doing checking a twelve year old girl out?&quot; <br>and:<br>&quot;&#39;I&#39;ll talk to them about it, they will listen to me.&quot; Apollo said firmly, in a rare moment of seriousness Percy looked genuinely surprised that he would do that for her; he didn&#39;t fault her. He himself was confused as to why he even volunteered for someone he didn&#39;t know except in his dreams.&quot;<br><br>Still, up to the person who does the mission, if they think it is bad enough to do a mission. Mechanically, the fic is bad, but not atrocious. However, for the amount of cannon it brutally murders, I believe it is bad enough under the Canon Protection Initiative to be itself brutally murdered.<br></p>

            <p>Honestly, after reading the Chapter 2 author&#39;s note (which basically translated in my mind as &#39;I need Percy to still be able to control water so that I can carry on ripping off the plot directly&#39;), I figured that&#39;d be the only explanation we got. <br><br>Having said that, the actual reason seems to be even worse than my expectations. </p>

            <p>Ouch. Really, ouch. My brain.<br>(And I thought the movie had issues. Not terrible ones, just...a few small things. But, when all&#39;s said and done, IT&#39;S NOT THIS FIC!)<br>And again, ouch.<br>I&#39;m also betting the author doesn&#39;t know about that other explanation...unless I missed something and it was actually taken from the story/an a/n?</p>
