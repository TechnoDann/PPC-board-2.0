            <p>Knowing the series and its fairly whimsical tendencies, Ollivander probably has it accounted for. Or maybe they could have an ьber-epic two-handed wand that they could spin around like a double lightsaber. Or they could use one with a straight handle, although it would be rather anticlimactic.</p>

            <p>I imagine he would be delighted by an unusual and therefore &quot;tricky&quot; customer. <sup>^</sup> I&#39;m not sure about wand lore in general, but with Harry Potter wands, they seem to be based more on personality of the witch or wizard rather than things like being right or left handed, or ambidextrous. So firemagic is probably right that the question is simply to help start with a smaller selection. <br><br>The Harry Potter wiki has some interesting information about wands. <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wandlore">Wand Lore</a> and <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Subtle_laws_of_wands">more specifics on the &quot;laws&quot; of wands</a>. <a href="http://bardwood.com/lore.html">This guy</a> actually makes wands, so his lore is probably more general than specific to a fandom, he even has a book about it!<br><br>And <a href="http://wizardingrealm.net/index.php?showtopic=208">this forum</a> is for Harry Potter wands, it has a lot of interesting information about wand woods, cores, etc. <br>*grumbles at my wand woods and their characteristics*<br><br>On another note, and apologies if this has been answered, or come up in a mission, I haven&#39;t read many Harry Potter missions. I was thinking as I went to answer the question, &quot;If I ever do a Harry Potter mission that ends up in Diagon Ally, I&#39;m going to have my agent go get their own wand.&quot; And that left me wondering if that was allowable. So if one&#39;s agents were in a Harry Potter mission could they go purchase their own wands? I know several agents have Sue wands they&#39;ve nicked from defeated Sue&#39;s but could an agent buy their own, or for that matter anything else out of wizarding shops, if they had some downtime in Diagon Ally? If so, would they have to be a witch or wizard agent to pull it off, or would it be enough that they were in disguise as a student, and therefore a witch or wizard in world? As to the lack of pay that cause most agents to just pick up free stuff from a Sue over buying it, they could either nick it from the Sue, or if they had a small reserve of their own, we know Gringotts changes money, so it would purely be a problem of whether the world recognized them as magical and therefore Ollivander wouldn&#39;t be thrown for a loop when muggles come looking for wands, or if it were possible, but only for witch or wizard agents. </p>

            <p>First of all, nobody is truely ambidextrous. There is one hand that is ever so slightly dominant, but for ambidextrous folk, the difference is so slim they hardly notice it. So, perhaps, Ollivander knows a spell that determines the dominant hand.<br><br>Another answer is that it truly does not matter which hand you use, but he asks for the comfort of the user. If you could use both hands equally, and are comfortable using either hand, then just grab some wands and we shall find the one for you! Or something like that.<br><br>The third is that there are no ambi wizards, and you are doomed to go wandless forever, becoming the Harry Potter equivalent of Rincewind. This is the least likely option of them, but there you go.</p>

            <p>Okay, I just got an image of Rambo Potter with dual tommy wands, and it is awesome.<br><br>But, all joking aside, I think he would just find a wand that could be used in both hands. I&#39;m certain, being a wand crafter, that he could pull it off - it&#39;s never said in-verse that it isn&#39;t possible, or that it is possible, leaving the readers to infer what they will.</p>

            <p>Well, in the first place &#39;the wand chooses the wizard&#39;. It always seemed to me like the whole measuring thing was to narrow down the choices. So there are probably sets for right and left handed people, and sets for ambidextrous, and whatnot. <br><br>It&#39;s not like he just goes &#39;oh, wait, you use both hands? Get the f*ck out of my store.&#39;<br><br>Or maybe he just goes with whichever one you favor? Even with ambidextrous people I&#39;d expect them to have one hand that they use a bit more over the other.</p>

            <p>I guess this is more a question on wandlore. Are they sets specifically for left/right/ambi people? Or can they be switched for either hand? Does a magical core go more strongly through the dominant hand, and is that why he asks? If they&#39;re ambi, do they have to test it on both hands before ruling it out? <br><br>I just thought the responses would be interesting. I have no idea what to guess. I&#39;m ambi, actually :)</p>

            <p>Harry tries it with both hands, IIRC, but when wizards talk about giving oaths and doing things, they say &quot;wand hand,&quot; which seems to be shorthand for &quot;dominant hand.&quot; I would imagine an ambidextrous person would just use whichever hand was more comfortable. I doubt the wand they end up with depends on it.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.quotev.com/story/1146982/Pharaoh-Love/">Pharaoh Love</a>, by PiecesBurnUp. So far, seems T but might contain lemon. It&#39;s a Yu-Gi-Oh! badfic written by someone who seems to be rather... smitten with Yami Yugi.<br>Where to begin... <br>1) This fic apparently gives Tea Gardener cancer and kills her off offscreen so the Sue will be able to pair with the Pharaoh.<br>2) The fic&#39;s SPaG is consistently bad and has tense shifts.<br>3) The Sue cries a Single Tear.<br>4) The Sue has an uncanon Millennium Item called, I kid you not, &#39;millennium belt&#39;, which is also a capitalisation-created Mini.<br>5) The Sue is a five-time duelling champion while still being in school. (Remember: this is a continuum where duelling is as important as the economy and politics. It&#39;s like have a highschooler for president multiple times.)<br>6) The Sue invents a card, gives it a cat-on-keyboard name, makes it Forbidden (which means it&#39;s probably OP) and her Spirit Partner for no reason whatsoever.<br>7) Said Spirit is also quite a jerk, his response to people saying that she can&#39;t beat Yugi being calling them idiots.<br>8) The Sue fails forever at being a Tsundere toward Yami Yugi.<br>9) The fic contains dumb metaphors and purple writing in general.<br>10) The fic has a confusing, non-linear episode order.<br>11) The fic separates Yami Yugi from Yugi&#39;s body for no reason.<br>12) There&#39;s also a possible second Sue.<br>And all of that? From the first three chapters. This needs to die in a fire. Badly.</p>

            <p>Hello hello, and welcome!<br><br>Looks like we share a couple of fandoms, Tolkien and The Hunger Games to be exact. I&#39;m a little confused why were ranting about the tahr though. Did someone dishonor it? Did they insult its heritage? Are they trying to say there are more adorable mountain goat, lion hybrids out there? Did someone claim it&#39;s a figment of imagination?<br><br>Let&#39;s see, welcome gifts. Hmm... *digs through closet with suspicious TARDIS like abilities* Ah, here we go, a book on fishing, three strawberries and a packet of my limited edition Atlantian sponge capsules.

            <p>Thank you! I&#39;m more of a book person, honestly. As I mentioned before, I kind of roam around from one fandom to the other. Right now I&#39;m kind of obsessed with Tolkien, but I&#39;ve written for a few different canons, like The Hunger Games, Divergent/Insurgent, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, even a Harris Burdict painting, which was a strange story.<br><br>I have only ever watched one anime- Last Exile- and I enjoyed it, but never found the time to finish the series. As far as manga goes, I&#39;ve not read any, but I draw in the style (not well, but I try).</p>

            <p>It&#39;s just an in-universe reference. There was a character briefly mentioned in the original PPC series with Jay and Acacia who ran around with a flamethrower one day shouting for Mr. Rogers. At some point, somebody dubbed him Len. That link I sent was to his page on the wiki.<br><br>By the way, nobody&#39;s going to look down on you or anything for your fandom choices. Warriors was a good book series, though granted I haven&#39;t read any of the books in years, so I don&#39;t know how the story quality went past the end of Power of Three, but... I&#39;m going to stop here before I start rambling.<br><br>In fact, I don&#39;t think we have any completed missions in that continuum, or Hunger Games and Percy Jackson for that matter(though Percy Jackson has a long-abandoned OFU), so if you&#39;re still up for it, you might be able to spork some badfic for any of those and be the first one to do so.<br>That is, if you are planning on making PPC stories. Some people aren&#39;t, and that&#39;s fine too.</p>

            <p>I read them too, see. I think I stopped somewhere around halfway through the New Prophecy arc? That sounds about right. I stopped when...actually, I won&#39;t write the names, because I&#39;ll get at least one of them wrong, but I&#39;m fairly sure I stopped reading while at least one of the three was still an apprentice. My screenname comes from that, though--I just capitalized the first letter of &#39;fire&#39; randomly (or because I thought it looked cool when I started using the name, who knows.

            <p>Dagorlad, but no Morgoth. Stupidly trusting hobbits. A non-elvish name. Purple descriptions, an angsty past, and, once again, nymphs. Ugh. And that&#39;s only a few of the problems. For instance, why is she swearing by Aule? How has she failed to Fade, be really traumatized, or sail to Valinor?

Actually, I&#39;d be happy to take it on anyway, but I do have rather a lot of missions planned right now, so I&#39;ll let someone else take it, if they want it.

            <p>I concur with DawnFire that you&#39;ve described it pretty well. You actually got me interested in the series. (BTW, did you know that someone posted the entire series on YouTube?)<br><br>Either way, what made you decide to write the interlude in the Knightmare continuum? And what, pray tell, were <i>those monsters</i> that Agent Cyba was so apprehensive about?</p>

            <p>...that is an outcome, yes. I&#39;ve seen some PPC missions where they change the format so they look at the action to avoid being temporally disfigured. Still, I think it&#39;s actually more fun if the PPCer goes with the script format for the mission--particularly if the author can&#39;t make up his/her mind.</p>

            <p>I should have posted this two days ago, but I at least got it in before the thread-drops-off-the-Board deadline. It&#39;s my first OFU-student submission, so if I left something out or didn&#39;t make him badfic-writer enough or there&#39;s something I need to clarify, or you take issue with the fact that his last name is another first name(I&#39;m not the best with making names), don&#39;t hesitate to tell me what I did wrong.<br><br><br>Name: Jason Gregor<br><br>Species: Zaldan<br><br>Gender: Male<br><br>Select the ones that you are familiar with/have written for: Star Trek: 2009<em>(does it count as familiar if I hate it)</em>, Star Trek: The Original Series<em>X</em>, Star Trek: The Next Generation<em>X</em>, Star Trek: Voyager<em><br><br>Favorite of the above: TNG<br><br>Lust Object: It’s not something I’ve ever really thought about.<br><br>Favorite Character: Lieutenant Worf. If the rest of the ship had listened when he talked, they probably wouldn’t have had half of the problems they did.<br><br>Favorite Pairing: I would have liked to see more of Worf/Troi in the show, but I&#39;m not going to make shipfics about it. Shipping Troi with anything would just be more to add to the pile.<br><br>Select one: Command</em>, Security<em>, Science</em>X<em>, Engineering</em>, Non-Starfleet_<br><br>Do you have an OC? Only in terms of making lots of new members of species that never showed many. I suppose that counts, doesn’t it? It’s practically what an OC is, but on a larger scale.<br><br>If so, describe their appearance and personality: This question is more for individual OCs, isn’t it? Let’s see if I can scribble out something on the sheet… nope, can’t. Those two Ferengi must have given me a bad pen. I’ll leave this one, since I’m running out of space.<br><br>Do you know what a Mary Sue/Gary Stu is? Yes. They’re what happens when people decide to make up the eight-millionth new subspecies to something stupid like the Vulcans instead of using what was there already. No skill at all.<br><br>If so, have you written one? Star Trek’s got enough races already without me making more. Which is to say, no.<br><br>Do you write slash? Why bother? There’s so many things more interesting to write about than whether some crew member suddenly decides to go for Kirk’s loins. I don’t know why it’s such a big deal anyway.<br><br>Jason is one of those who thinks that if he sticks to names and places mention in canon sources, he can do whatever he wants with them.<br>As such, he’s developed extensive fanon based around the time-worn “nobody said that it wasn’t like that” principle, making his fanfiction ridiculously complicated and drawing on a history that he made up based almost entirely around a series of species that he swears up and down aren’t OCs because he heard their names one time on an episode.<br>This was, of course, what got him sent to OFAS.<br><br>In terms of personal traits: he has a large amount of canonical knowledge in the series he follows, but since he often misuses it, he’s developed a bit of a disconnect in what was the canon and what was only fanon.<br>He tends to be stubborn and prone to speaking without thinking, which can lead to problems. He possesses massive, bordering on morbid, curiosity, and would probably spend most of his off hours trying to figure out how everything works in the OFU. Of course, this would likely lead to him or the people he bribed getting chased out of the more restricted parts of the ship by the minis more than once, but he’d find it worth the trouble.<br>He is very decisive and relatively resourceful, though he often feels that the ideas or contributions of others would be inferior to his own, and has a tendency to get verbose when irritated.<br>He hates the Star Trek reboot movies because of a combination between the series eliminating all of the previous canon material helter-skelter via implausible time-traveling black hole and him having seen the movies in a theater that was absolutely packed with people that talk when the characters are talking, shriek at inopportune times, keep changing seats, and the like. What no this isn&#39;t based on my own experience watching it what are you talking about.<br><br>Species note: Zaldans are a TNG Alien-of-the-week. I ended up getting attached to them and writing fanfic about their culture because I thought they were fun.<br>Since Jason is an exaggerated badfic-writer version of myself, he likes them too, but in this case, they’re a prominent part of his hilariously convoluted alternate Starfleet, which is quite different.<br><br>The two Ferengi were members of the traditional OFU acceptance &quot;welcome&quot; crew, which is to say they showed up in his room one night and said &quot;Hey, badfic-writer, fill this out right now&quot;. Just clarifying there in case you were wondering about that.</p>

            <p>I am coming out of lurking (temporarily) to notify you of <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/r/8846715/"> this</a>. The fanfiction linked to above was sporked by Lily Winterwood.

            <p>Because I really don&#39;t think &#39;why do you believe you have the rights to notify a unsuspecting author about the PPC&#39;s existence and &quot;PPCing&quot; of this fanfiction&#39; is a good thing to have said. It gives the impression of The Secretive PPC, Sneaking Around - along with The Fandom Police Will Stop You Talking To Each Other. It smacks of several gallons of elitism.<br><br>Guys. <i>People are allowed to talk about us</i>. &#39;Many members have agreed that what you just did is a Bad Idea&#39;? This sounds like it&#39;s verging on a <i>threat</i>. I know it isn&#39;t, but - can you see how it sounds?<br><br><hr>
<br><br>As to the topic at hand: there was discussion back in &#39;05 or &#39;06 about whether we actually ought to be telling <i>everyone</i> we wrote missions of. The theory was that it would help them to improve. That died pretty quickly, mostly because several authors got very angry (I think there&#39;s a comment on the Wiki about authors trying to get missions taken down - yeah, that happened), but that doesn&#39;t mean we enacted a What Happens On The Board Stays On The Board rule or anything.<br><br>Regardless, I think the appropriate response here would be either to ignore it, or to post a friendly review outlining:<br><br>1/ Some of the points that you (probably Lily in this case) found needed improvement in the story - and also what you liked! Concrit is awesome.<br>2/ An explanation of who the PPC is - that we are a group of writers who use &#39;missions&#39; to explore what needs improving in fanfics, as a combination of entertainment and learning to improve our own writing. I think that&#39;s a fairly accurate description, but if you think the key words I&#39;ve avoided (&#39;killing&#39; and &#39;badfic&#39;, mostly) are needed, put &#39;em in.<br>3/ (Potentially, and if you have time and inclination) Offer to beta-read any changes or future chapters of the story.<br><br>I <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> link to anything - wiki or mission. If she(?)&#39;s that interested, she can hunt it down herself (and besides, I&#39;m not sure FFN allows linking in reviews).<br><br>Oh, and take a backup of your mission in case it does get attacked.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I really do not think that what we do, largely, is bullying. We don&#39;t go and link to missions in the comments, going &quot;Nyah, nyah, you suck we rock, Look upon our awesomeness and weep!&quot; But I do think that we could stand to give more concrit - when you see a &#39;fic that looks awful, <i>tell the person</i> before you go in for a mission! It&#39;s like, I dunno, making fun of someone&#39;s terrible awful caricature skills while not bothering to point out to them that they&#39;re holding the pen wrong. Maybe, if they know what they&#39;re doing wrong, they&#39;ll want to change it!<br><br>But... telling people not to talk about us, because we&#39;re too busy mocking them to actually converse, that&#39;s... that&#39;s pretty bad, and puts us way over the line into bullying territory, I think.

            <p>I had one that found the mission because of a tag back feature on LJ. She called me a name or two and set all her stuff to private.  It might have been not as it could have been, because I had made a point to say that I liked other things she had written, and I don&#39;t think the mission was very harsh.<br><br>Another one found it through one of those linkers and he was angry.

            <p>I used to be <i>so</i> bad at writing emotions, really. Of course, I was pretty young, so, I&#39;m inclined to just sweep everything under the rug. <br><br>Interestingly, though, a lot of the stuff from the Random Crap Dump has mutated, grown new legs, and crawled into the current group of stories. One universe that I&#39;m working on right now is in mach six, and I&#39;m fairly certain that one of the characters in it has been with me for the past ten years, though a bit different now than she used to be. (For that matter, her husband&#39;s been around since I was at <i>least</i> thirteen, but considering that he is no longer the stereotypically sexy elven hunter and he got a name and a back-story that aren&#39;t stupid and actually exist, respectively, he&#39;s changed quite a bit.)<br><br>I had some fun with the springhole Mary Sue litmus test the other day - something I wrote in the fifth grade, which involved the young heroine defeating laser-weilding baddies with a suit made out of tinfoil. Believe me, I swear I didn&#39;t know anything about how lasers worked at the time. I think the final score (before they updated the test, so not the other day) was somewhere north of 100. And do you know what? &quot;Redwing&quot; still scored less than Bella Swan. I went from being mortified that I still had that computer file to retroactively proud of my middle-school self. I have proof now that even at the age of eleven, I could write a less sueish and more feminist character than Stephanie Meyer. :)</p>

            <p>My typical offenses result from thinking I&#39;m being clever when I&#39;m really, really not: baffling leaps of logic, overwrought metaphors and similes, bizarre sentence structure, etc. I don&#39;t always see it right away, because at the time I know what I mean, but then months later, I&#39;ll re-read a particular passage, cringe, and wonder what the hell was wrong with me.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t help that I occasionally like to hint at things without overtly saying them, like planting Easter eggs for anyone paying enough attention.

            <p>I&#39;ve recently stumbled upon my old scrapbook. Did it give me a shock... There were some nice pieces of writing, though, but if remember correctly, those paragraphs were written and rewritten dozen of times before I was satisfied with them enough.<br><br>As for other stuff... first try at serious writing - it was supposed to have twenty main characters and I just kept adding and adding every single idea that crossed my mind.

A story about werewolves, with total lack of understanding about characterization and trivialization of slavery. Yeah... I scrapped it.<br><br>There were some more jewels in the various scrapbooks over the time, but I can&#39;t think of them right now. Not like they are important, anyway.</p>

            <p>Hi, Ekyl/KG here. Hope you&#39;re all doing well. As part of hS&#39;s PPC documentary, I am working on a feature involving the New Caledonia city, the MyMiniCity stuff that surrounded it, and its effects on our community and the shared universe we write in. I will, however, need a bit of help, which is why I&#39;m opening it up a little to the community; if anyone is willing to submit to a quick interview on the matter, I would love to hear from you. If interested, please reply here and leave a means of contacting you, or e-mail me at <a href="mailto:kyle.garrett41@gmail.com">kyle.garrett41@gmail.com</a> - sorry for the abrupt post, but I figured this would be a good time to involve some of the community in this project, hopefully in a fun way. Thanks for your time!</p>

            <p>But, to be fair, I did look at it and did not find any errors. So yeah.<br><br>Now, as for the mission. This was really, really good. Outside of killing an awful fic that simply hearing about made me sick, the massive amount of character development was handled very well. It was very smooth in the revelation of Christianne&#39;s past relationship, and the banter of the two Tile Lords was brilliant. May I say, I am a huge fan of the Disentangler. She is very funny, and wonderfully snarky.<br><br>Now, did I notice a reference to a Blackout story that I have not written yet? <i>next thing you know GLaDOS is going to show up and try to take over the place or something.</i> That was exactly what I was planning to do. Man, now I have to get on with writing the darn thing. Or pass it on to someone else.<br><br>Now, if I may, I would love to acquire the Amulet of Gryffindor.

            <p>So, me and Lielac wrote (but didn&#39;t put up anywhere) a mission in a Bionicle badfic, where the Sue and replacements were dealt with by retrieving the actual Makuta Teridax, who was replaced.<br><br>An interesting problem came up: Makuta is telepathic, has an incredibly complex mind, and his actual body is a gas. Thus, he cannot be effectively neuralyzed. Even if it worked, he could just pick up the missing memories from the agents right in front of him.<br><br>This brings me to another question: Should Teridax have OOC Immunity? The Bionicle fics featuring him are almost always replacements, from what I&#39;ve seen. That, coupled with his immunity to neuralyzation and (in our mission, anyway) acceptance of the PPC as long as they don&#39;t interfere with him seems like it would add up to somebody who doesn&#39;t take crap from badfic.<br><br>I&#39;m sure that made sense somehow.</p>

            <p>As far as I&#39;m aware, complete OOC immunity is reserved for deities such as Eru and Aslan. Being God in their universe basically makes them more powerful than even the most overpowered Sue, so that&#39;s why they get it. Merely being telepathic and non-corporeal does not begin to approach that level of power.<br><br>Also, funny thing about neuralyzation: it&#39;s not actually necessary to make the canon characters forget things 100% of the time. You may notice that Jay and Acacia didn&#39;t resort to it much, if at all. The reason for this is that the canon resets itself once the majority of badfic influences are removed. Do the PPC exist in canon? No? Then, barring any convincing and preferably funny extenuating circumstances, a canon character can&#39;t remember what doesn&#39;t exist.<br><br>Neuralyzation is actually meant to be used when the memories themselves are strong enough to keep canon bent out of shape until they&#39;re gone—particularly traumatic events may need neuralyzation (and/or FicPsych); a story predicated on an angsty backstory that never happened might need neuralyzation. And yeah, it doesn&#39;t hurt to use the neuralyzer even if it isn&#39;t strictly necessary. But, if you can remove enough uncanon without it, the snapback will do the rest. Don&#39;t forget that restoring the canon is the goal of every PPC mission.<br><br>Also, speaking of FicPsych, they do have more resources than the average field agent when it comes to modifying unusual minds, so that&#39;s always an option if your tale demands complications.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The TARDIS protects, creates, and destroys, and contains a pocket universe inside itself.

            <p>The TARDIS is about two parts sufficiently advanced technology, one part powerful psychic, yes?

I mean, it can be funny when granted to the least likely candidate (see <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Gaspode">Gaspode the Wonder Dog</a>), but it seems to me that it mostly just makes for an unresolvable conflict, which has no payoff in terms of storytelling, and I worry that it opens the door to agents getting a bit too cozy with powerful characters. It&#39;s hard to put my finger on it, because I can&#39;t really think of any examples of this being abused, but it just seems a little too convenient if any sufficiently powerful canon character automatically knows about the PPC and (I presume) is on the agents&#39; side.

            <p>It&#39;s far more common than outright Immunity, and it is easier to handle in missions.<br><br>The first such character was Elrond, by reason of his wisdom and his ring of power. Gimli is often ignored in badfic.<br><br>OOC Resistance comes from several sources:<br>--The character is not &quot;hott&quot; enough to be focused on by fanbrats and is simply ignored. Gimli the dwarf was one of the first established to be resistant because of this.<br>--The character is a minor character who is often present, but usually ignored. Gaspode, for example.<br>--The character is particularly perceptive or mentally resilient. Batman and Sherlock Holmes are both slightly resistant, though for them it may be more that they are capable of taking even the smallest traces left behind by agents and putting together two and two very quickly when they see more evidence of agents being around.<br>--The character is mildly insane--just nutty enough to entertain the idea that something like badfic could exist, and just sane enough to think straight about it. Murdoc from The A-Team, for example.<br>--The character is very genre-savvy and regularly breaks, or approaches breaking, the fourth wall. Elan from &quot;Order of the Stick&quot; would probably take agents&#39; presence in stride as yet another feature of the story he knows he lives in.<br><br>OOC-resistant characters will usually be aware that something is off, and will struggle against possession or Suefluence, though usually not with much success. The benefits as far as your agents are concerned is that these characters are less likely to see them as enemies, more likely to understand that something is wrong and that the Sue is dangerous.<br><br>But you don&#39;t *have* to make such characters resistant. Sometimes it&#39;s funnier if they&#39;re not. Resistance is on the border--if the Sue is bad enough or the crossover is tangled enough, their resistance can get overwhelmed and they can go as badly out of character as you like. That&#39;s the beauty of OOC resistance instead of immunity; it gives you more flexibility with what you can do with the characters, rather than just forcing replacements.<br><br>If a character can&#39;t be neuralyzed, there are other options. Many magical and technological verses have memory-modification tech or spells. Harry Potter-continuum spells are probably the best bet unless the target is immune to magic. If it has a nervous system, some form of technology can probably do it.<br><br>And if you can&#39;t do any of that, then the agents might run around getting rid of everything else that doesn&#39;t fit and hope the canon itself gives them a hand.<br><br>I think it&#39;s kind of funny when agents get in way over their heads and have to solve a problem they never realized they were going to have to solve, like neuralyzing a creature that doesn&#39;t have a physical body.</p>

Because the Sue can hear her in her head, and the Doctor outright states in that story that normally only he can hear her.<br><br>Of course, based on canon, the TARDIS doesn&#39;t seem to actually speak--more like convey emotions. Otherwise &quot;The Doctor&#39;s Wife&quot; makes absolutely no sense--if she&#39;s been able to talk to the Doctor all along, why on earth would it be such a big deal for her to finally be able to tell him &#39;hello&#39;? Good grief. The *entire point* of that episode is that she normally *can&#39;t* talk using words.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure the TARDIS really can become a deus ex machina to that extent--for one thing, most human agents would have a hard time communicating with her. I mean, I could probably figure out how to exaggerate it, but it wouldn&#39;t fit in a PPC mission...but maybe that&#39;s just me.<br><br>I wonder where the real TARDIS has been shoved in that mission...look for giant plotholes, I guess.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>...the Disentangler&#39;s favourite is the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS, so she gets protective of her if a Sue messes with her, and throughout this mission (that I may post later today) the TARDIS has been expressing her annoyance at the fic through humming and groaning, and reducing the compression from the bad dialogue spacing.<br><br>I don&#39;t think it should be a regular feature; it&#39;s just that there are upcoming missions where the TARDIS is affected by Sues, so it&#39;d be nice to see her sane (can ships be sane?) before those missions happen.</p>

            <p>One: Teridax is essentially Bionicle&#39;s version of Satan. He hijacks the body of the Matoran god, Mata Nui (who happens to be the entire setting). I think Terry is ALMOST deific in power, akin to a titan or demigod.<br><br>Of course, this also guarantees Mata Nui possessing OOC Immunity.

            <p>Well, I don&#39;t think almost-deific qualifies for OOC immunity, or else you could make the case that a character like Q (who is not a deity, despite what he wants us to think) should have it. OOC resistance, maybe. But, these aren&#39;t traits that too many characters really ought to have; otherwise, it kind of reduces the threat posed by badfic and makes us look silly for getting all worked up about it. Plus, traditionally, OOC resistance is determined in large part by how much the badficcers ignore a particular character, thus leaving them free to notice the warping going on around them; that&#39;s why Gimli and Eowyn have it. (And also, as always, because it&#39;s entertaining for them to have it.) If badficcers are constantly going after this guy and getting him wrong, it seems to me he&#39;s probably been worn down some by the assault and <i>more</i> vulnerable, not less, despite his canonical power. A ton of bad writing can nerf just about anybody; that&#39;s one reason it needs PPCing.<br><br>Hm, I&#39;m not sure if being the universe is the same as being god of that universe. Gods are typically somewhat separate from their creations. If he literally <i>is</i> the canon, then isn&#39;t he himself being distorted by the badfic, and thus in need of restoration by removal of all things uncanon? The canon itself shouldn&#39;t contain knowledge of an organization that doesn&#39;t exist within it, should it?<br><br>I guess a question like that requires another question to come up with the best answer: is it funnier if he remembers, or funnier if he doesn&#39;t?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Mata Nui contains the Matoran Universe inside his original body, but he isn&#39;t the entire canon. The Matoran Universe is just the main location that most of the canon-native species are from. It&#39;s not really the whole continuum; there are other planets and locations outside of it, but it&#39;s all that the main species, the Matoran, know, thus the name. Mata Nui, when controlling the Matoran Universe, has the power to bestow life to new species, manipulate the land and gravity inside the Matoran Universe, and control the destinies of beings born within the Matoran Universe, so that&#39;s pretty godlike, at least in my opinion. When the story advances, he loses the Matoran Universe body, and the nigh-on-divine status that goes with it, and would thus lose the OOC Immunity. It&#39;s sort of like the reverse of what happened to Madoka from Puella Magi Madoka Magica, who gained OOC Immunity by ascending to godhood.<br><br>Rule of Funny should still come into play for whether or not Mata Nui-as-Matoran Universe remembers them, though. That&#39;s always best.<br><br>When you brought up Q, I suddenly realized how awful a time agents would have killing a replacement for just about anything in the Q continuum. Other than getting another Q to remove its powers, there&#39;d be little that could weaken it, and charging it would draw its attention long enough for it to teleport its assailants into space. I do not envy the agents who first encounter one.</p>

            <p>The synthezoid-mind Mata Nui, the being who contains all of the Bionicle setting, would likely be OOC-immune, in part because his character was never really described in the story and also because he&#39;s a nigh-on-deified machine the size of Asia with power over the entire setting.<br><br>Mata Nui the confused and separated being hiding inside the Mask of Life would not be OOC-immune, because he&#39;s an independent entity and no longer the consciousness of the Matoran Universe. Same goes for Mata Nui after he crashes on Bara Magna and builds himself a new body. He&#39;s still not a god anymore.<br><br>Also, on the matter of Teridax, you&#39;re right that neuralyzation would likely not work well on a Makuta due to their physiology, but Teridax in his original body is also not a god, and he only even qualifies to be considered as such after he hijacks the Matoran Universe body. Original Teridax would not be OOC-immune, and in fact is one of the most likely characters to be OOC that I&#39;ve ever seen in Bionicle fanfic.<br><br>I&#39;d say send him to FicPsych. The Psychs managed to remove the memories of the PPC from one of Mass Effect&#39;s drell canon characters before, and it&#39;s normally impossible for a drell to forget <i>anything</i>.</p>

            <p>I must say that this is a complex bit. As with most of the other replies, I would say it depends on what exact point this is in the canon.<br><br>If, for instance, the fic is set in the first two years, Makuta Teridax would be a being of god-like power, but he would have a physical form. At the end of the second year (Nuva storyline, I believe) that&#39;s when Makuta&#39;s body is destroyed in a very complex string of events (involving being turned into a mutated combination of Toa and Makuta, and then getting squashed) and he becomes a malevolent cloud of gas.<br><br>But, if this is set in the Metru line, which is a prequel to the first two lines, then Makuta is back in his old physical form. <br><br>After the climax of the Nuva line, Makuta remains a cloud of gas until after the Mahri line, at which point he takes over the Mata Nui robot and ejects Mata Nui inside the Mask of Life. <br><br>Then during the climax, he gets his head busted in by a falling moon.<br><br>So yes, in culmination, it would definitely depend on what line of Bionicle this is. (And yes, I&#39;m also an extreme Bionicle nerd.)</p>

            <p>When a character is ruptured, that&#39;s often a sign that they&#39;re being possessed by a Sue-wraith, but when a Makuta is outside its body, it&#39;s in a gaseous form. Makuta can be charater-ruptured just like anything else, but what would one do about the wraith? How would a wraith possessing a gaseous Makuta be exorcised?

            <p>The only Bionicle canon-native methods I can think of for expelling spirits are a few voluntary astral projection-style ones and others that would be incredibly dangerous for the Makuta in question, so that&#39;s out, at least until someone can think of something better.<br><br>A giant whisk might work, though. The wraith certainly wouldn&#39;t be expecting it.<br><br>Your mention of a proton pack reminded me of the Luigi&#39;s Mansion-inspired idea I&#39;d had for defeating Ghost!Sues.

My initial impression was that a Poltergust would be too situational to keep around the lab, but then I thought that there could easily be a technician researching its properties or something of the sort, so I decided I&#39;d need a second opinion.</p>

            <p>I cannot speak to what things will be like for me in August - that&#39;s around the time when classes will start up for me again and I&#39;ll either be looking for a new apartment or looking to get a new lease on the one I&#39;ve got now - but if a date can be set, I could certainly investigate the possibility of popping over.

            <p>... any thoughts on a date? We traditionally go for Saturdays,  since more things are closed on Sundays. In August, that gives us the 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th and 31st. I&#39;d be tempted to go for one of the middle three, myself - anyone have any thoughts at all?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So far we&#39;ve got a &#39;no&#39; on the 24th, a handful of preferences for the later part of the month, and a couple of responses which might suggest an earlier Gathering.<br><br>So: Ekyl, how likely are you to attend? Your &#39;maybe&#39;s don&#39;t sound all that convinced, and I don&#39;t want to schedule around an offchance.<br><br>Lily: How likely are <i>you</i> to attend? Your response seems more firm, but see above. Additionally, what constitutes &#39;late July&#39;? The only Saturday that month which would be possibly workable is the 27th July - is that the right timeframe?<br><br>Karen: And how likely are <i>you</i> to attend? Additionally, would an earlier date in August - the 3rd or 10th - be better for you? Would the 27th July work for you?<br><br>Everyone who&#39;s actually in the country: My current shortlist of dates is the 31st August (if Ekyl is pretty solidly coming and the other two aren&#39;t), the 27th July (if that works for Karen and/or Lily, and Ekyl isn&#39;t likely to come), or the 17th August (per Cassie&#39;s preference, and assuming none of the furriners show up). Are any of those dates problematic for anyone? If so, when would be better?<br><br>Regarding location: I&#39;m saying London, and specifically central London. The traditional meeting place is the sundial next to Tower Hill station, since it&#39;s a very small location right on the main transport routes (ie, half an hour to get to anywhere else). Any thoughts on that?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have no idea how likely I am to make it due to a variety of factors, such as when I can get a passport, classes, getting people to let me go, and just how expensive a flight to England is, but I <i>will</i> put in an effort to get there, and if things look like they&#39;re not going to work I&#39;ll put in notice of such.</p>

            <p>We&#39;ll strike you from the planning for the Gathering, since you don&#39;t have a where or when. Then, if you end up coming to Britain, and you have Internet access, let us know (probably on the Board is easiest) and we&#39;ll see if we can throw together a quick mini-Gathering. That is, if you tell us where and when, anyone who can get there (probably myself and Kaitlyn, depending on the day) will show up and say hi.<br><br>We&#39;ve successfully run such quick-fire Gatherings before; given the rather haphazard nature of Gatherings in general, they don&#39;t need all that much planning to start with.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Makes-Things does, in fact, make all sorts of things.

I seem to recall someone wanting to have one built into an original Gameboy case, though I don&#39;t remember who or when.

            <p>So you&#39;re saying that an accordion is all fine and dandy (I can imagine it being played to dispense analysis, which is pretty hilarious), but something like a laptop, or maybe one of those gauntlet-computers from GI Joe Sigma 6 would work much better.<br><br>(seriously, I never see references to that show.

            <p>Makes-Things mostly makes plothole technology, but he does have knowledge of tech from a wide variety of continua. I&#39;ve seen stories where he works on Star Trek tech and TARDISes, for example. Standard equipment is most of what he deals with personally, but it&#39;s hardly all he can do.<br>There are other DoSAT techs that will be more helpful with technology from individual continua, but Makes-Things is still good for general knowledge and damaged equipment in most cases.<br><br>CADs can be modified to go into basically whatever would fit them without breaking. Heck, I&#39;ve seen an agent who had installed one in her body. She was a synthetic life form from an anime continuum, but the precedent is out there. I don&#39;t know who you&#39;d be bribing to install one into an accordion, but as long as there was some way that the CAD could actually still be used(it&#39;s hard to point an accordion at something, for example), it could potentially still work.<br><br>Of course, the problem of the CAD overheating, exploding, and/or having its parts fused together would come up, so you&#39;d better have a really good reason why your Agent has to have it embedded in a musical instrument, especially one that will be basically unplayable if the CAD melts inside it.</p>

            <p>So I&#39;ve watched the first six of the seven Saw movies, and was thinking about them today after watching 5 and 6 again. The movies are incredibly complex. I love them for their psychological manipulation of the characters and viewers. There&#39;s gore, yes, and I often close my eyes or look away when that happens. When I watch the Saw movies, I watch them for the way the story plays out, for how complex the stories are. <br><br>And I would like to ask. Out of everyone on the Board who has seen the Saw movies, even just one, what did you think of it? Do you not the movies, and why?</p>

            <p>Two of my DIC missions were in the Saw continuum. Yeah, I watched all seven movies just about back to back, to the point where I saw Saw VII in theaters. So my thoughts?<br><br>Well, let&#39;s get started!<br><br>[SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!]<br><br>Saw: This is a horror classic. Great tension, compelling story, and the twists were awesome and unexpected. So yeah, love this movie.<br><br>Saw II: A pretty good follow-up. Not as good as the first one, but still quite cool in its own right. Loved the twists that it took, too.<br><br>Saw III: Not a bad movie, but not great. Personally, I think this one suffered the most from executive meddling, as I would&#39;ve liked it better if they had gone with the original ideas that the writers had gone with--which would&#39;ve been a major deconstruction of Jigsaw. But of course, since Lionsgate wanted sequels... Still, the movie we got isn&#39;t that bad, so I don&#39;t complain too much.<br><br>Saw IV: This is where it started getting a bit too torture-porny for me, and it started going downhill from here. The twist at the end was kinda dumb, honestly, and came too out of nowhere in a way that just didn&#39;t work at all. It&#39;s not really a good movie, so I wouldn&#39;t watch it again. Also, it&#39;s got my least favorite trap in the franchise. Hey, Tapp, here&#39;s a suggestion: CUT HER ...ING HAIR WITH SOMETHING!<br><br>Saw V: It sucks. Hard. In my opinion, this is the worst movie in the entire franchise. Unfortunately, I think a big problem is that it has the unenviable task of having to cover up Saw IV&#39;s plotholes. I wouldn&#39;t have minded so much, except that the other main part of the movie was basically a poorly executed rehash of Saw II, with the most unlikable characters of the whole franchise.<br><br>Saw VI: The only Saw movie after III that is worth watching in any capacity. Seriously, this one is actually quite good. It also helps that it contains my favorite trap of the whole franchise: the carousel trap, which embodies everything Jigsaw is about.<br><br>Saw VII: The only reason to see this movie is for all the callbacks to the first movie that occur within the last ten minutes of the whole thing (and because Cary Elwes is a freaking <i>god</i>). Otherwise, it&#39;s a mess. The traps are kinda cool, but they&#39;re a little on the torture porny side, and it doesn&#39;t help that one of the franchise&#39;s most horrifying deaths is reserved for a character who is COMPLETELY INNOCENT. (Granted, it&#39;s a Hoffman trap, but still!) And the complexity of the canon gets so out of hand that the denoumont doesn&#39;t really add up. Still, the last ten minutes make it a pretty good conclusion, so I can&#39;t complain.<br><br>So yeah...</p>

            <p>It seems we agree on quite a lot when it comes to Saw. I wouldn&#39;t consider Saw V the worse movie of the bunch - I did enjoy seeing Hoffman&#39;s transformation into what he is, though admittedly it was lacking in some areas and him killing Seth Baxter like a Jigsaw game feels like it came out of the blue for him - but yeah, after III the series just declined. :/ Kramer should have had more screentime, even if he was dead, and it couldn&#39;t have hurt to expand more on Amanda&#39;s past and role as John&#39;s apprentice. <br><br>Then Hoffman. He might possibly be my favorite character, and CostasMandylorhasgreatlipsshutup. But seriously, I&#39;m intrigued by how he went from (apparently) a guy who loves his sister and was a cop to a guy who kills cops just to get a chance at killing Jill. The series might have been better for me if there was more &quot;let&#39;s see how the characters turned into what they are&quot; and &quot;let&#39;s see how the victims deal with the traps and how it affects them psychologically&quot; instead of, in 3 and after, &quot;let&#39;s toss out a bunch of blood and gore and roll in moolah!&quot; Seriously. Saw wasn&#39;t gory. There was gore, yeah, but the movie itself was really psychological in nature, with Lawrence and Adam working on what they were going to do to get out and trying to save themselves while not killing the other. <br><br>I think what I&#39;m getting at here is that the Saw franchise was, pretty much, okay in my book. It just should have stayed true to the first movie&#39;s atmosphere and such, focused more on the characters and less on the blood and gore.<br><br>Also. Link me to those missions pwease? :33</p>

            <p>What if it&#39;s a very obvious Sue--so obvious that the summary says &#39;this is a Mary-Sue--if you don&#39;t like Sues, don&#39;t read&#39;?

            <p>It has a pair of Sues in it, back-to-back. One gets killed, the other one appears. Also, tremendous OOC-ness, Fourth wall breaking, and general dickery.  The author seems to think that it&#39;s a good idea to comment on the story that he&#39;s writing as he&#39;s writing it, without bothering to label his comments in any way.

            <p>I&#39;ve seen a few quotes about this in the last few days (there&#39;s a thread on the way in the middle future), and what I&#39;ve taken away from them is this:<br><br>We have to be very clear on what makes a Mary-Sue. And for me - and I think for the PPC - one key component is that <i>she is badly written</i>. I don&#39;t believe there is such a thing as &#39;a well-written Mary-Sue&#39;, because that&#39;s like saying &#39;a brand-new scrapheap&#39;. It&#39;s an oxymoron. Mary-Sues are a product of bad writing.<br><br>How does this reflect on your question? It means that summary, <b>if accurate</b>, can be rephrased like this:<br><br>&#39;this is a badly-written story--if you don&#39;t like badfics, don&#39;t read&#39;<br><br>Now, it may be that the author in question is using a different definition of &#39;Mary-Sue&#39;. Some people do that. Some people, I&#39;m sorry to say, use it to mean &#39;female character I don&#39;t like&#39; - or even, &#39;any original female character&#39;. I disagree vehemently with those definitions, and I don&#39;t think many people (any?) in the PPC would use them. For us, &#39;Mary-Sue&#39; has always been about writing quality. That&#39;s why we have charge lists.<br><br>So, the fact that the author says she&#39;s a Sue doesn&#39;t mean she fits the PPC definition. If she <i>does</i> fit the PPC definition of a Sue - if she is a 1-dimensional character who warps everything around her to make her story work, and doesn&#39;t manage to make it sound realistic by decent storytelling - then (if you can make it funny) she&#39;s mission-killable.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>To the first question, it would depend on how the &quot;deliberate&quot; Sue is written.  If it&#39;s something intentionally satirical, like &quot;A Trekkie&#39;s Tale&quot; or the fic Lily just wrote an Intelligence Report for, then no (unless it were really badly executed, I suppose).  These Sues are pretty much doing what we do: using Suvian characters to show why they tend to produce bad writing.<br><br>If it was something like a trollfic, a bad parody, or what the Wiki calls an anti-Sue, then these would typically be fair game for missions (unless they were particularly well-executed and legitimately funny).<br><br>To the second question, Jay and Acacia established that if a Sue dies as part of their own story, that event continues to affect the canon as part of the Sue&#39;s influence.  As a result, such missions should generally have the Agents assassinate the Sue before their own planned death.</p>

            <p>... the rule is that if writing a mission about it is funny, it is doable. A deliberate Suefic is usually - though I suppose not always - a troll; they&#39;re technically in the remit of the Department of Bad Parody: Troll Division.<br><br>As to Sues who die during the story - remember, missions aren&#39;t just about killing a Mary-Sue. They&#39;re about witnessing the effect of a badfic on the canon and then making it right. That&#39;s why we have other departments, of course - but it&#39;s also why a dead Sue still needs sporking.

            <p>I&#39;ve never seen a troll handled in the Department of Bad Parody(but I&#39;m hardly going to claim that I&#39;ve read all of the spin-offs, so there could just be one I&#39;m unaware of).

            <p>Where was he/she from? Judging by the way it was phrased, and by a few implications earlier in the chapter, it isn&#39;t their Head of Division, but what is it? Was that the head of one of the Departments that was shut down? RPF, maybe? That one seems important enough to be mentioned in the manual, but isn&#39;t around any more.

            <p>As all or most of you probably know, Deleterius was a badfic-sporking community on Livejournal, which was deleted and purged sometime last year (to the best of my knowledge). I recently updated the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Deleterius">wiki page</a>, and posted the seven pages of quotes that I found saved in a document on my computer on <a href="http://dawnfire360.livejournal.com/1203.html">Livejournal</a>. But I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more material lurking around, so to that end...<br><br>This is a general call for any and all material that was posted in the Deleterius community. Sporkings, pieces of sporkings, comments, bits of comments--even the OT posts. Anything and everything is welcome; if you have it, send it in or give me a link. With any luck, we can reconstruct some of Deleterius as it was--a funny, insightful community of intelligent people who were outraged enough at badfic to share it with other people and make it funny.<br><br>It may have been purged, but it doesn&#39;t have to remain lost.<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Anyone remember <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=240579;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=75">this</a>? A fair few people signed up to help out, but it&#39;s been a month and I&#39;ve barely heard from anyone. In fact, the only person to have actually sent me any recordings is Myrddin (and thank you for that); apart from that, I have a partial contribution from hermione of vulcan (for which, again, thank you), and a note from DawnFire that she needs more time (which is fine). Everyone else... are you still there? There&#39;s even still some empty spaces in the list, guys...<br><br>So here&#39;s how it works. People can contribute a video of them talking about their subject, a sound recording of the same, or a written text for someone else to read out. That obviously requires volunteers to do reading - I had a few before, but not many specific volunteerings. There are also a handful of excerpts which need reading out. Anything which is marked as [VACANT] needs someone to say something. Any reading marked with ??? needs someone to read it. Anyone with [TEXT] after their name - I believe that&#39;s currently Neshomeh and hermione of vulcan - needs someone to read their contributions. <b>Please volunteer</b> for these - if you can, please choose something specific (ie, a person or a reading).<br><br>In addition, there are a handful of questions at the end which I would like everyone who&#39;s contributing to answer. It is allowable to make that your only contribution.<br><br>In order to try and get this sorted out, I&#39;m going to request three things:<br><br>1/ If you are on the timeline, <b>please reply</b> to say if you&#39;re still interested. If not, I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re not, and will find someone else to fill the slot.<br><br>2/ If you want to contribute, whether you&#39;re already on the timeline or not, <b>please email me</b>. My email address is above. Mention your Board name, please - as I&#39;ve noted before, real names <b>will not</b> be used in this documentary.<br><br>3/ If you intend to contribute, please email whatever you&#39;re making - a video, a sound file, or a piece of text - to me by the <b>15th of June</b>. If you have a specific reason to need longer, please tell me so I know. Hopefully, given that date is a month away, it should be long enough. I&#39;m not asking for hours of footage here - Myrddin&#39;s OFUM piece is about three minutes long, and it works just fine.<br><br>If you have any questions, please do ask them. If you want me to look over something you&#39;re planning on reading, email it to me - I&#39;m perfectly willing to do that. <br><br><hr>

            <p>Yes, I&#39;m still interested. I&#39;m sorry, hS - things have exploded a bit on the IRL side.

            <p>I&#39;ve got several things to say, so I&#39;m abandoning cohesiveness and jumping right in.<br><br>First, something to add would be something on the reboot of the Multiverse Monitor. I&#39;d suggest Lily Winterwood for it (if she wants to) or anyone else involved heavily in the process, preferably from the very beginning of the reboot. The differences between the old MM and the new version could be mentioned, as well as some of what&#39;s been published so far.<br><br>Second, I&#39;m still down for the PPC and young writers article, as well as the everyone questions--funnily enough, I read this post, got inspired, and actually started writing. I don&#39;t know when it&#39;ll be done, but at least it&#39;s started...and timelines are really annoying for it, especially as I&#39;ve lost potential information due to a hard drive crash. There goes ever being sure of when I discovered the PPC. Oh well. So that&#39;s happening. I&#39;m also happy to give writing about the Blackout a go, although, actually, I haven&#39;t read all of the Interludes yet, so possibly someone else should do it. If no one else takes it, I&#39;m willing to, though.<br><br>So yes. I shall work on things...but I&#39;m still in.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>... Ugh, that is a godawful punctuation cluster at the end there. &gt;.<br>So, I&#39;m sorta kinda toying with a Blackout story set in FicPsych, and as such it would be useful to know who&#39;s there at the time. I&#39;m mostly looking for canon characters, so if your agents or anyone you know of had dropped anyone off around then, let me know, and please point me at the mission where it happened. Otherwise, if you know of a canon who&#39;s being particularly mistreated in fanfic at the moment, let me know who they are and what their damage is, and that&#39;ll work just fine, too.<br><br>I&#39;ll also take agent suggestions. If you want to volunteer yours, let me know who they are, why they&#39;re there, and (optionally) which nurse they normally see.<br><br>I&#39;m not guaranteeing I&#39;ll use every suggestion I get; it just depends on where the story goes. Still, the more I have to work with, the better, so don&#39;t hesitate to throw ideas at me. {= )<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My characters were in FicPsych before my first story starts, you connected the Blackout and FicPsych, and I connected my characters to the Blackout. So I&#39;m essentially starting with a Blackout interlude.</p>

            <p>So, they&#39;re not going to be in FicPsych at all, then, or is it going to be another story set there during the Blackout? I&#39;m a little confused by the connections. I apologize if I&#39;m being dense—I&#39;m in the home stretch of the &quot;Blood Raining Night&quot; mission (first draft; it&#39;s gonna need an overhaul and about 25% cut for length even before it goes to beta), and the writing bug is playing absolute havoc with my sleep and my ability to think about other things. &gt;.<br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Confused, that is. By my own thought processes. Basically, what you did was open my mind to the idea that I don&#39;t need to stick with the scene that just doesn&#39;t work, I can start someplace totally different. So I played around with the Blackout, but then decided that I didn&#39;t want to interfere in anyone else&#39;s continuity. But now I was thinking of new possibilities, and I&#39;ve decided to make my agent&#39;s backstory mission the actual first mission, rather than just the scary event in the past that I was having trouble hinting at. They will leave for this mission right before the Blackout, and come back as FicPsych is cleaning up from whatever-it-is. But you don&#39;t have to worry...it&#39;ll be part of my story and will only have to reference your interlude.<br><br>Bottom line, you made me brainstorm about stories, and some of the randomness that comes with brainstorming leaked onto the Board.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll make a note the mission&#39;s just before the blackout, it&#39;s probably going to be a really short one because the fic is a tiny gorram thing. Wash is there because he was in a fic where he was flying the skiff Mal shoots down in Firefly&#39;s pilot. He was put in a POW camp, raped in prison by Mal (who&#39;s undoubtedly a character replacement) and years later, when he&#39;s looking for work, he makes it three steps onto Serenity before Mal spots him and shoots him. The fic is here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3405993/1/Come-Around"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3405993/1/Come-Around">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3405993/1/Come-Around</a></a><br><br>Also, an agent if it helps. Agent Cham of the DAVD is exposed to one of the most extreme departments and mission types out there, and to make it worse he&#39;s allergic to Bleep. It&#39;s established he doesn&#39;t go down to FicPsych terribly often, but this could be an exception. Here&#39;s his wiki page, with links to an appearance: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Cham"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Cham">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Cham</a></a><br><br>I&#39;ve also got a mission in progress with him and Kalmer I just found in my gdocs, if it would help to see that.</p>

            <p>As for Cham and Kalmer, yes. We were sharing those characters to begin with, and since she&#39;s kinda been unable to do much with the PPC due to stuff going on in her life, she handed the pair off to me.</p>

            <p>Some of it&#39;s also capitalizing on &quot;when Twilight/some pony turns into an alicorn&quot; fanfic ideas from before the Season 3 finale, and most of those are <i>really</i> stupid.

I estimate ninety percent replacements, including... including...” his voice broke down. He took a gulp of tea and changed the subject. “There might be a few possessed canons, especially from the <i>Halo</i>-verse, but I might think that because I know jack squat about it.” <i>Taptaptaptap. Taptaptaptap.</i> “Third, last, and most horrid...” his voice dropped to a whisper, and he grabbed his axe. There was an anomaly of sorts around the axe’s head - it looked like it was moving in a different speed than it should be - and little sparks were jumping around the blade. “Trivialisation. Of. Of. Mass murder.” He got up and put both of his hands on the table. “Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to face a mass murderer Sue.”<br>Tera made an odd coughing noise. <i>“Not just one. Almost every </i>Nanoha<i> canon, save for Carim Gracia, Ixpellia, and Schach Noeura, is replaced.

Just about every character with more than a line is replaced, and the rest are OOC.<br>2.1) One of the most OP, violent, hypocritical and plain idiotic Replacement!Sues I&#39;ve even seen.<br>3) Trivialised mass murder and disgusting cruelty and violence.<br>There are other charges as well, but the last two are what makes that fic truly horrible.</p>

            <p>There is indeed a relatively small in-patient section. Ideally, I imagine the nurses prefer to get people stable enough to send home rather than keep them penned up forever, because that is both inhumane and a drain on their resources, but with the kind of crazy you get in the PPC, sometimes letting them go is just not possible. They don&#39;t keep them in a basement, though.<br><br>HQ <i>does</i> have basements and sub-basements—the DAVD is located in one, the <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> Division was/is in another, and I think one account has the pool deep beneath all other basements, reachable only by an absurdly long flight of stairs.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Does anyone here have a hypothesis on why procoptodon goliah went extinct? After several hours of research, and analyzing aboriginal cave/rock drawings, I myself belive humans are resposible for the extinction a short faced kangaroos, however, they didn&#39;t kill all of them off, as some went extinct from other causes before humans came to Australia.

            <p>Dear Sir (I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re a sir, correct me if I&#39;m wrong but I have a sixth sense for these things,)<br><br>Upon quick research into the matter of Procoptodon Goliah, (I wikipedia&#39;d it, okay?) I submit that human activity, while probably part of the equation, may not have been the sole reason for the kangaroo&#39;s unfortunate demise. Geologic changes associated with the end of the Pleistocene epoch, such as the sudden lack of glacial and interglacial periods, are often stated to be a factor in the demise of other interesting species, such as the giant ground sloth, saber-toothed cat, and other such wonderful megafauna whose scientific names I can&#39;t be bothered to spell. Though short-faced kangaroos are hardly megafauna, I think that a relative decline in grasslands as large regions of Austrailia warmed and dried out decreased their available habitat, and that their demise culminated in their apperent status as a hopping barbecue for the locals.<br><br>I&#39;m actually an Environmental Science Major, so I&#39;m going to summarize this as &quot;if climate change + humans, then extinction.&quot;</p>

            <p>But that&#39;s a very interesting introductory post (although I could have sworn I&#39;d seen your name before...) Hi! Welcome to the Board! Here, have some Swiss Bleepolate. It&#39;s very good for erasing details of horrific badfic (or brain-breakingly nonsensical hypotheses, to whit: maybe these kangaroos went extinct because the Doctor traveled back in time, only he was actually the Valeyard, and then the dinosaurs attacked him, but his companion at the time--a short-faced kangaroo--sacrificed herself so that he could live. And then the Doctor flew into another universe and became Darth Vader, who then decreed that short-faced kangaroos should all be eaten, and so they went extinct before they could really get started. But in a different universe, Rose Tyler refused to eat kangaroo, and started a rebellion against the Gelth, which wanted to take over the penguins. However, the penguins had been cross-bred with Daleks, and so the Gelth ended up destroyed, but Merlin felt sorry for the penguin-Daleks and adopted them and convinced King Arthur to raise one as his heir. And so it was that Camelot fell to Mordred the penguin-Dalek, and England was left in ruins. And then Mordred the penguin-Dalek&#39;s great-great-great-uncle married a short-faced kangaroo--the last one in existence--and the short-faced kangaroos were made extinct but survived in the short-faced kanga-pengui-leks. So there you go, that&#39;s my hypothesis. Did I give you enough Swiss Bleepolate? Here, have some more just in case.)<br><br>...I claim no responsibility for any brain-damage caused by the above hypothesis.<br><br>~DF </p>

            <p>Let me take a crack at it.<br><br>The initial breed of short-faced kangaroos had been bred from the standard-issue marsupials, like wallabies, for example, by a group of hyper-advanced entities in an attempt to purify the kangaroos&#39; genetic base. The Earth marsupial gene-manipulation was a crucial portion of a test to see if the methods used there were viable before tests on sapient beings.<br><br>Once the method had been perfected, the kangaroos were left on Earth and the entities launched off a galaxy-wide genetic manipulation program, working outside the lines to allow bloodlines with preferable genes to crossbreed in an attempt to create a group of individuals specially born with enhanced abilities, including high-level psionic powers.<br><br>However, they were just too good. Some of the psionic science-children were much more powerful than expected, and many of those had so little control over their abilities that they often ended up warping time itself. A certain unscrupulous member of the hyper-advanced entities began using them as weapons, brainwashing them to serve him and using them to erase his enemies from history. However, due to that warlord&#39;s lack of thought to temporal consequences, the past of the massive genetic program that created the children was being disrupted, making the timeline unstable, which led to the warlord being discovered. Other members of the hyper-advanced entities managed to capture one of the warlord&#39;s time-warping mutants, which had their abilities enhanced even further by its master&#39;s experimentation, and, seeing no better choice, imbued the growing fetus of one of their own race with the psionic child&#39;s power. The power could not be implanted into an adult, since the sudden introduction of that level of psychic power could potentially destroy the mind of the recipient, and the entities weren&#39;t willing to have an insane time-warping entity running around the place.<br><br>The imbued child, however, resented his role as the chosen one, and after one of his mentors was removed from history by one of the warlord&#39;s attacks, which caused everyone but the time-separated child to forget about him, the imbued child stole a ship and transported himself to Earth, intending to manipulate the past of the breeding program and stop the time-manipulating abilities from ever appearing.<br><br>However, in his unstable emotional state, he botched it, and ended up skewing the past results of the program too far, causing it to fail rather than grow in a different direction. His powers spiraled out of control as causality attempted to catch up with the new history, which intersected with the previous time-instability caused by the warlord to set off a temporal chain reaction that ended up destroying large pieces of the timeline.<br><br>At the end, almost the entire program was removed from history, and only the first forms of the short-faced kangaroos, early test subjects created to make sure the genetic isolation equipment was working as intended, remained on the planet. Eventually, since the developments that stabilized their genetic structure were removed from history, the short-faced kangaroos began to fall prey to chromosomal diseases, and eventually began to die off. A small group was able to cling to life through beneficial mutations, but the interference of humans led to the extinction of that group as well later on.<br><br>Did you really read this far down, or are you just looking to see how long this gets? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m done. Here you go, anybody that finished reading all that, have a cookie for putting up with me!</p>

            <p>You know, around halfway through I started wondering if you were about to create the Time Lords.

I&#39;ve been following that timeline for a while now.<br>Time Lord #1: Yes, but it&#39;s been branching out recently.<br>Time Lord #2: Ah, yes, so it has. Oh no, they&#39;re warping time! Should we--?<br>Time Lord #1: No need. See there, that child&#39;s going to fix it.<br>Time Lord #2: Oh, I say...<br>Time Lord #3***: Well, that&#39;s it, then. It&#39;s taking care of itself. Problem solved.<br>Time Lord #1: Indeed. Later, gentlemen.<br>Time Lord #3: *mumbles* I was a lady in my last regeneration...<br>*they leave*<br>Time Lord #2: ...we could have prevented this.<br>(Time Lord #2 eventually became the Doctor.

            <p>Besides, if they were able to manipulate time with their thoughts, they wouldn&#39;t need time machines. TARDISes would be a fad, nothing more, and the Doctor wouldn&#39;t have his blue box. They wouldn&#39;t really be Time Lords at all, then. They might call themselves that, but it wouldn&#39;t be the same.<br><br>You&#39;d think that a group of Time Lords would be more concerned that big chunks of time were being ripped up and rearranged by a massive cosmic temper tantrum, but then again, the Classic Who Gallifreyans never seemed that concerned with most events, so it&#39;s probably just some early-era Time Lords looking for something interesting out in the worlds.<br><br>Unless they&#39;re espousing the &quot;ours is the only reality of consequence&quot; philosophy and just watching noncommittally as the other timestream rips itself to shreds. For shame, hypothetical Time Lords. For shame. All that power, and you wouldn&#39;t do anything with it.</p>

            <p>Provided that someone, somewhere, has written about thylacines. A lot of people have characters from failed original stories that migrate over, and nobody objected when I wanted to bring in a Dinotopia Velociraptor, though my permissions piece is on a permanent backburner. :)</p>

            <p>The penguins went in because I needed something *really* random. It&#39;s kind of hard to make something nonsensical, you know? I have this tendency to actually try and keep things in the same universe, so I had to subvert that. Quite interesting, really.<br><br>Also, you&#39;ve forgotten several more questions that are traditionally asked at this time:<br><br>4. Do you plan on writing missions? If so, do you have a department in mind?<br>5. What is [redacted]<br>Okay, so question #5 would normally be something seemingly unrelated, such as &#39;do you like cheese&#39;, or &#39;what do you think of the color orange&#39;.

Lord of the Ring, of course, but also Fablehaven, though I&#39;ve not been able to lay hands on any but the first two books so far. I also have a fair knowledge of several Anime/Manga series and love everything by Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli. Your dad sounds fun, there are people I&#39;d love to sit him down with and just listen to the discussion, as well as having questions of my own I wouldn&#39;t mind starting someone like talking with. <sup><sup><br><br>Now</sup></sup> welcome gifts!

            <p>Ahh... to Karen: I enjoy LoTR, Phineas and Ferb, Fablehaven (to name an obscure one) and several others I don&#39;t have the time to name here. I don&#39;t have any LO&#39;s (thank God). I found the PPC by way of older sister, and I like freshly baked home made chocolate chip cookies. <br>I know of Doctor Who because my older brother is a forever going on about it, and I know almost everything there is to know about LoTR. My dad is practically a scholar on the subject. (If you&#39;re ever unsure about something, just ask him and belt yourself down for a lecture.) ...And to finish the list, I do enjoy Anime/Manga, especially Naruto and everything by Studio Ghibli. <br><br>To Ailavyn Siniyash: Neat! I like infinite notebooks! (The one I have is running out of room.) And an Urple gel pen? Maybe for doodling...<br><br>To KittTheCat: Thanks for the NMs, and (seeing as I answered one of your questions to Karen) I&#39;m an easy-going fellow who decided to join the PPC out of hatred of Sues, and a love of all things funny. I also have two older siblings who aided in introducing me to the PPC and hooking me on it *very* well. <br><br>To Desdendelle: I&#39;ve gone over the Constitution twice, the (very!) shiny Wikia dozens of times, read a good number of the Original Series... and NOT yet dropped by the IRC chat. <br><br>Now for a question of my own- how do I change my user name from... what it currently is?</p>

            <p>Oh, please do. I ranted about that one on the Board a while back--when it was discovered, that is. I couldn&#39;t get through it, either--it was really bad. And annoying. And I spotted plotholes in the very first chapter--if I remember correctly, she meets Gandalf and several minutes later he invites her to come with him to Hobbiton. And then she tags along some more. On the other hand, I could be remembering a different badfic...<br><br>Yup. Bad nickname. Horrible one, in fact. Tell you what, send Rooney in, and if it&#39;s bad enough (or too bad to live) I will write or co-write a mission into it. It would be my honor and my pleasure.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>It&#39;s good to see a DoI mission dealing with not-so-badfic. It&#39;s the one Department that would go through everything, goodfic and bad, but thus far I&#39;ve not seen it cover anything that isn&#39;t mission-quality badfic already. That trend seems a bit against its potential, in my opinion.<br><br>I liked how Rooney&#39;s personality came through in the report. There were several spots where I could easily picture his reactions to fic events and his subsequent attempts to put them into words, which was good because just about any mental image of an Eldar muttering to himself and crossing things out on a notepad is a good mental image.<br><br>I have one notable typo to report, though: in &quot;(or un-reubttaled, if that’s a word)&quot;, &quot;un-reubttaled&quot; should be &quot;un-rebuttaled&quot;, even though that isn&#39;t actually a real word. Approximations deserve proper spelling, too!</p>
