            <p>I am currently working on an OFU for Doctor Who. Now since an OFU is coming, I was wondering would it be okay to introduce new...uh items that could be utilized in the PPC?<br>One of the items is Logic Water. Logic water is a glowing blue...well water. It drips from any kind of plothole at somewhat random times, though there are plotholes that just spit out Logic Water. However, when applied to Suvians/Sue-possessed beings, Logic Water can initiate SOCS. Sue wraiths will leave the host. However Logic Water is not 100% effective due to some Sues and Sue wraiths being vaccinated/ trained to resist the effects of SOCS. If a non-Suvian drinks Logic Water, it should clear their head of illogical thoughts, though it does not function like any of the Bleep products. On a side note, Logic Water can be used in place of water.<br><br>The second item would be Crystals of Plausibility. The Crystals come in a variety of sizes and colors, but are naturally shaped like an icosahedron. On the Moh&#39;s scale of hardness, they rank about 7 to 7.5. The Crystals function like Logic Water, but their ability to initiate SOCS is limited. Instead, they act as a sort of Sue repellent. The Crystals can be used as a Sue repellent, though it won&#39;t last forever.<br><br>Okay, now that I&#39;m done with that, if you are interested in joining this OFU, I have a registration form. Please copy-paste the questions into an email (And fill them out!) and then send it to <a href="mailto:kittythekatty@gmail.com">kittythekatty@gmail.com</a><br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16WKJnkdlnTkItaCc1IZzyiqyG3R2Ypdjt8MiUzf13jw/"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16WKJnkdlnTkItaCc1IZzyiqyG3R2Ypdjt8MiUzf13jw/">https://docs.google.com/document/d/16WKJnkdlnTkItaCc1IZzyiqyG3R2Ypdjt8MiUzf13jw/</a></a><br><br>Thanks for putting up with this somewhat boring message!

            <p>It&#39;s not unfortunate! Anyways, SOCS is a suvian disease/condition thought of by Lily Wintewood. If you read her International Hetalia Academy of Fanfiction,  you&#39;ll find out how SOCS works.<br><br>SOCS is an acronym for Suvian Overheated Cerebellum Syndrome. Basically, from what I&#39;ve read, SOCS is when a Suvian doesn&#39;t understand something and they undergo a mental meltdown. Since the very existence of Suvians is illogical, the Water and Crystals counteract the illogical presence of Suvians.  However, some Suvians have been vaccinated/trained to resist SOCS.</p>

            <p>There is a whole lot of paradox proofing. Unfortunately, the proofing is not 100% effective and as a result, plotholes (mostly supply in origin) pop up a lot. Most of the time, they are temporary,though if you aren&#39;t careful; you&#39;ll get sprayed and or pelted with Logic Water/Crystals of Plausibility.</p>

            <p>Except for a few weird continua like Timecop, past selves and future selves <i>are</i> able to interact, though the extent varies from continuum to continuum because of pre-established concepts and occasionally the individual continuum&#39;s magic rules, if time travel is caused by or a product of some form of sorcery. The Doctor&#39;s done it before, usually in Classic Who. He often restricts himself to interacting with only one version from each regeneration, though, because it&#39;s easier for the viewers to tell them apart that way. The Eleventh just hates the idea of interacting with other versions for some reason, but he&#39;s got all kinds of crazy time-superstitions that are never really backed up. I&#39;m thinking most of those are just him being paranoid.<br><br>Still, the latent paradoxicality of a school existing across multiple time periods and bringing alternate versions of characters from varied points in time and space, coupled with the numerous semi-incompatible ways Doctor Who has handled the effects of time travel over the years, would definitely cause plothole-spawning problems, and it has comedy potential, so don&#39;t think I&#39;m disparaging the concept.<br><br>By the way, if you could find some way to work in the Davros-versus-Davros concept from the last time the Doctor WhOFU was brought up, that would be awesome.<br>For clarification, that would be the Dalek Emperor!Davros from the later stages of Classic Who and the mutilated!Davros from New Who constantly fighting over who deserves to be the true creator of the Daleks. Imperial Daleks would fight for the former, Vault Daleks for the latter, in a combat of increasing scale that would almost certainly cause the WhOFU students no end of trouble.</p>

            <p>Every instance of the Doctor meeting his past/future selves in the original series - the Three Doctors, Five Doctors and Two Doctors incidents - were deeply meshed in Time Lord technology. In the first instance, they nearly drained their own power supply keeping the three Doctors stable. Even the fourth incident - <i>Time Crash</i> - was the result of the TARDIS&#39; shields being down. There are a few later examples, which I think are all Eleven running around in time loops and bumping into himself (off the top of my head - <i>The Time of Angels</i>, <i>Time/Space</i>, and <i>Night and the Doctor</i> all did this one way or another).<br><br>More generally, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinovitch_Limitation_Effect">Blinovitch Limitation Effect</a> comes into play. Specifically, this version:<br><br><i>...it is a physical effect that occurs when two versions of the same person from different time periods make physical contact. This results in an energy discharge, shorting out the &quot;time differential&quot; between them. The Mawdryn Undead storyline establishes that the younger version of the character involved in the discharge, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, is traumatized by the event and, for the next several years, loses his memory of the Doctor.</i><br><br>This has been inconsistently applied over the run of the series: in the new version, Rose held herself as a baby and summoned the Reapers, but Amy Pond has come into contact with her younger self numerous times with no ill effects. It&#39;s all a bit wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey.<br><br>That said, OFUs are (and always have been) free to play fast and loose with the canon in order to get the staff together - OFUM has Morgoth and Sauron being painted urple by Merry and Pippin, which is just a <i>bit</i> unlikely, don&#39;t you think? They&#39;re humour stories, so like the PPC, it&#39;s all in the name of Funny.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Stable from what? Collapsing? Vanishing from existence? The past selves should be able to hold on to existence if only due to the ontological inertia that means they would inevitably have to become their future selves. I suppose that it could be stretched to say that the &quot;present&quot; version could be adversely affected by his own past selves, but since he would have future selves that he would also need to become, which would make the &quot;present&quot; self a past self, that doesn&#39;t really work, either.<br><br>Though I knew that the extent a past and future self would be unavoidably affected by the continuum&#39;s rules, which would include the Blinovitch Effect you mentioned, I&#39;ve not seen past selves of anyone, Time Lord or otherwise, averse to physical contact with future selves, or any memory-erasing wave of dangerous energy coming out of such contact. Maybe it&#39;s just one of those concepts the writers forget about most of the time. That can happen with long-running shows.<br><br>Well, the Reapers were already there when Rose held herself as a baby. The timeline was impossible anyway, because the presence of one Rose&#39;s actions interrupted the timeline of her recent past self and the past self of the timeline that would have now grown up with a living parent, which compounded on the existing vulnerabilities in time and made it something the Reapers had to deal with. I&#39;d say more on this variation on the subject, but it would start overlapping with my fan-speculation on what the Reapers do in the context of the Doctor Who universe, and thus is a bit off-topic.<br><br>Still, though, Rule of Funny is Rule of Funny, and if things need to get all paradoxy to get a few good jokes in, they might as well. The WhOFU&#39;s going to have several experienced world-savers on staff if things get rocky.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not as though sudden portals that may or may not shoot pointy crystal are any more dangerous than keeping several known omnicidal maniacs on staff.

            <p>I&#39;ve made references on here, or aloud to IRL friends, to Starships &amp; Sorcery, a &#39;verse* I&#39;ve been working on semi-quietly since February. It&#39;s sort of grown to the point where it leaks into almost every short story I&#39;ve written since then, and most of my plotbunnies wind up there. But in the meanwhile, I find myself mentioning in-universe threads and ideas and theories in casual conversation, and then remembering, too late, that such starships are not, in fact, real. Whoops.<br><br>More problematic, though, is the way the slang and oaths from that &#39;verse like to crop up in other writings. I have to remind myself that most people don&#39;t say &quot;Frozen hell&quot; as a mild expletive, nor swear by/on &quot;dead gods,&quot; nor cuss out someone by shouting &quot;Stars rot your eyes/guts/soul,&quot; because it&#39;s... just a bit of a breach of canon.<br><br>*It actually turned out too big to write alone, so I&#39;ve opened it up to folks who&#39;re interested in the premise. If you&#39;ll allow a minor plug... thus far I&#39;ve only really opened it up on the IRC and to interested friends, but the general background is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/159g8PwP9b959r_gH_ALB0ZQap5_Gwlf6BJXPczg15HE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>, and there&#39;s a couple samples <a href="http://vmthecoyote.tumblr.com/tagged/starships-%26-sorcery">on Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://thulcandran.dreamwidth.org/?tag=starships/sorcery">Dreamwidth</a> - so feel free to poke through and see if anything strikes your fancy.

And then the first scene ends with the line &quot;Kylie Ramirez was falling in love with Geordi La Forge!&quot; The fic seems to be set post-Nemesis when Data is captain of the Enterprise, however it places Geordi as his first officer, which is uncanonical but <i>should</i> support slash (the TOS quote &quot;at his side as if you&#39;ve always been there and always will&quot; seems appropriate). I&#39;m especially irritated since the rest of the results for filtering through &quot;romance&quot; and &quot;Data and Geordi&quot; is mediocre slash. Not &quot;Department of Bad Slash&quot; bad, but not good either. I could keep complaining, but I&#39;ll stop.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8553399/1/I-am-the-daughter-of-chaos"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8553399/1/I-am-the-daughter-of-chaos">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8553399/1/I-am-the-daughter-of-chaos</a></a><br><br>I can&#39;t even read it since the author forgot that the enter key existed.

Poor Anubis.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8599234/1/Black-Magic"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8599234/1/Black-Magic">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8599234/1/Black-Magic</a></a><br><br>The first chapter&#39;s...okay. The Sue&#39;s running through a rough part of New York City and talks about how people go through hard things, and it&#39;s decently written, which makes it meaningful enough. It&#39;s not great, but not bad. <br><br>And then the second chapter happens.<br><br>She ends up at Brooklyn House, acts completely disrespectful to Carter, teasing him worse than Sadie does, and she doesn&#39;t have the excuse of being his sister who actually cares about him. She calls him Cat. <i>Cat</i>. She also has to explain Hathor and Sekhmet to him. He was there! He defeated Sekhmet with salsa! And the Sue starts mouthing off to Sadie about dying her hair. Then she punches Anubis in the &quot;family jewels&quot;. Yes, we&#39;re all going to love you when you insult our favorite characters!<br><br>Also, she seems to be hosting the female form of Anubis, Anput. She seems to have done her mythological research but not her &quot;actually read the books research&quot; which clearly states that Walt is the first person to follow the Path of Anubis, which I would assume includes the same powers. Also, people don&#39;t have to host a god that&#39;s the same gender as them.<br><br>I&#39;m done complaining about these fics now.</p>

            <p>I don’t even write stories in German, but I had some good discussions in an international forum, so my reasons to write stories in a language I’m not completely fluent in would be:<br>1.  I would reach many more readers than when I write in German.<br>2.  This would increase my chance to be read by people I would actually like to meet.<br>3.

            <p>One of the characteristics appears to be a regular dropping of the definite article - &quot;heir to potter family&quot; - which feels like the work of someone who speaks a language which doesn&#39;t have them. Then there&#39;s the author&#39;s email username, which is &#39;swatiraviteja&#39; - which, again, looks non-English (a personal name like &#39;swati raviteja&#39;, or &#39;swatira viteja&#39;).<br><br>Unfortunately I can&#39;t get past the language barrier to see whether the story itself is any good - but we don&#39;t pick on people for not speaking the language well, at least when we know about it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Huinesoron, Storme Hawk, I agree with both of you. This writer may not be a native English speaker. However, it is really the OOC-ness that is present in the second and third chapter that made me wince. Lily, or rather &#39;Lilly&#39;, and James presenting their children like trophies, Albus Dumbledore &#39;scanning&#39; the children as if they were barcodes, Harry suddenly becoming a squib...etc. Also, as seen in the first chapter, can Seers really write down prophecies they make? I thought they aren&#39;t self-aware when they make a prophecy, as seen in Prisoner Of Azkaban.</p>

Apparently she&#39;s 1800 years old, and living in a &#39;parralell reality&#39;, having been sent there by Galadriel to keep her safe. Why Galadriel would do this for her and not for, you know, anyone else in the history of Middle-earth (sorry, &#39;Midell Earth&#39;), goes unexplained. My guess is she wanted to get rid of her.<br><br>The story is a fairly generic girl-falls-into-Arda tale, with the (again, common) quirk that Evelyn is the child of a canon character, specifically Elrond. As is usual, she&#39;s been transformed into a human for her stay on Earth - I&#39;m sorry, I have to ask, <i>why</i> did Galadriel think the Earth of CE 1000 was safer than Third Age Arda? Given that she calls her supposed granddaughter back when the Ring is uncovered, I think my &#39;get rid of her&#39; theory is looking more and more likely.<br><br>I duck out of the way as Evelyn sees a familiar face - Haldir of Lorien. Yes, the Haldir who canonically had never left the Golden Wood. Here he&#39;s Evelyn&#39;s guard and only visitor. Quirkily, he&#39;s transformed into a human for his visit to Earth, although this is barely mentioned.<br><br>Haldir explains the backstory to Evelyn, and she demonstrates spooky levels of &#39;empathic&#39; abilities. They&#39;re actually fairly well presented - she reads emotions, not thoughts. Unfortunately, they&#39;re in such detail that it pretty much counts as telepathy; she can read &#39;joy, joy to see me, and joy that I could return home&#39;.<br><br>A portal opens all by itself - because Galadriel apparently has portal technology now - and Evelyn and Haldir step through, followed closely by &#39;Gabriell&#39;, Evelyn&#39;s friend. As Evelyn points out, &#39;What kind of an idiot jumps in an unknown portal?&#39;.<br><br>We walk to Rivendell, which is now a city or town in a forest - it&#39;s funny how the &#39;riven&#39; part never seems to register, isn&#39;t it? As the chapter rolls over, I read ahead to see parenthetically translated Grelvish, Elvish servants, Celtic designs, and a bizarre statement that seemed to imply the author thought Galadriel and Elrond were of the Valar, or rather Valor. That was followed with Designated Mysoginist Boromir, &#39;she elf&#39;, and ultimately an &#39;Eleven companions&#39; line.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen enough. The main character is a Mary-Sue - she hits all the regular cliches, and she has absolutely no narrative depth. Her reactions to traumatic and joyous events are equally nonexistent, and she&#39;s quite happy to remake the entire world to allow her story to exist. I take a portal home, grateful for once to be back in my own body.<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>PPC Intelligence Report</b><br><br>Fic: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9055520/1/">The mistakes we made</a><br><br>Description: A Mary-Sue daughter of Elrond, having lived a thousand years on Earth, is brought back to Middle-earth in order to join the Fellowship. She drags a random human woman with her, who may turn out to be a secondary Sue.<br><br>Plotholes: Galadriel can create portals. Evelyn is special for reasons not very well defined. She also seems to grasp a thousand years of missed history very quickly.<br><br>Problem Passages:<br><br>1) But most of all I remembered my grandmother, who had me hidden here, to protect and prepare me of a prophercy she herself made. A prophercy that fortold the wakening of a great evil. I was kept safe, but my home, my Rivendell, my family and the entire Midell Earth wasn&#39;t. I was safe in this parralell reality, where my gradmother sent me, but I had to return one day , to destroy a great king, destroy or be destroyed.<br><br>2) &quot; It has been forseen by both me and your grandmother &quot; my fahter started, &quot; that great things will happen tomorrow, every race has sent their representatives, and after a brief discussion with your grandmother it has been decided that you will represent Rivndell.&quot; I noded my head in understanding. This could be expected, I was in fact a lady of Rivendell, and by birthright had, as any of my sibilings, the right to represent my home. I briefly wondered why the Valor would have it that I was the one to represent it, but quickly dismissed the thought. The will of Valor was not to be questioned.<br><br>Primary OC: Evelyn (daughter of Elrond)<br><br>Type: Mary-Sue. Half-elven, though I don&#39;t think she knows that. Absolutely no emotional depth.<br><br>Secondary OC: Gabriell (human female)<br><br>Offenses Against Canon: The aforementioned portals, Haldir wandering the world, Rivendell is a forest, Boromir is a Designated Mysoginist, most other characters OOC, the Mary-Sue exists as a &#39;special&#39; daughter of Elrond, two extra members of the Fellowship, vast numbers of mini-Balrogs.<br><br>Additional Comments: It should be noted clearly that the author is a non-native English speaker. The generally strange and often incorrect English spelling and grammar should be excused - for the circumstances, it&#39;s actually quite good. However, the same doesn&#39;t apply to the proliferation of mini-Balrogs, or the use of Grelvish - especially since it is translated in-line, which has never been a good idea. Lack of familiarity with the language doesn&#39;t excuse the rather feeble &#39;look what I can do <i>now</i>!&#39; plot, either...<br><br>~|/~ Kyaris, DoI ~|/~<br><br><hr>
<br><br>From Kyaris, who was doing things in the Department of Intelligence before SeaTurtle made that cool.<br><br>Also, while I&#39;m here: Autumn, the front page of the Board holds 25 threads. We try to avoid adding too many new ones when the content can go into an old one instead. This post, for instance, would have worked just fine as a reply to your previous thread (which is immediately below it), or (if there had been one, which there doesn&#39;t seem to be) another thread on badfics near the top of the Board. And if you find anything interesting on Quotev, that should probably go as replies to this thread, rather than as a new one, too.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>We have badfic report threads, where one person will start off and everyone else will jump in with recently found badfic.

            <p>Hello. As for getting familiar with the Board, the first step, of course, is telling us a bit more about yourself. For starters (as you&#39;ve been asked twice now), what are your fandoms?<br><br>For example, mine include Pokemon, Artemis Fowl, Star Trek: Voyager, Final Fantasy VII, X, XIII, and XIII-2, and (just recently) the <i>39 Clues</i> series.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve actually got two - the main one, which is mostly fandom oriented, with <s>occasional</s> <s>frequent</s> constant interruptions for various activism leanings, is <a href="http://vmthecoyote.tumblr.com">VMtheCoyote</a>, and the other, which is a more text-heavy proper blog, deals with birds generally, crows specifically, and life in a small town 2800 miles west-northwest of where I was born, is <a href="http://talkingtocrows.tumblr.com">TalkingtoCrows</a>. I follow a bunch of people and shall add you to the list (though I have occasionally unfollowed because my dashboard has become six-pages-long every time I leave it alone for an hour, and I honestly just don&#39;t have that kind of time - so don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything personal if I unfollow).</p>

            <p>Generally speaking, I&#39;m pretty sure we just remove them from the list and either breathe a sigh of relief or pout at the lost opportunity. I think if they were in Claimed Badfic we might try to track them down, but given that they&#39;re in Unclaimed...well, thanks for the list; I&#39;ll go get rid of them :) (And if I&#39;ve somehow missed something and that&#39;s not actually how we do things, the edits can always be reversed!)<br><br>Pity about Amy Virtue, that was an interesting one.

            <p>Linking this in because I don&#39;t want to create another thread. The PPC Agent I&#39;m creating for my Permission Request is coming from an old original story I created a year or so ago that I&#39;ve stopped working on (and scrapped) for several reasons, in this story the Character has a super power (well power) of perfect vision (ie being able to see in the dark, through a smokescreen etc.) is that considered too OP for an Agent? considering otherwise he&#39;s a pretty standard human being (with a fondness for ranged weaponry) </p>

            <p>I know that&#39;s not very helpful, since it applies to just about everything, but it&#39;s true.<br><br>However, speaking as someone who writes a guy with a perfect memory (who has to keep up a heavy Bleepka habit to stay sane after all the bizarre and disturbing things he&#39;s witnessed), I&#39;m inclined to think you can make it work. You just have to consider what limitations and drawbacks the ability might have in this environment. For instance, how does your character cope when confronted with urple and other contradictory colors? Can he perhaps see the Words <i>all the time</i>, not just when he wants to? What about the simple, everyday things most of us don&#39;t see just because we&#39;re focused on something else, or not specifically looking for them? How frustrated does he get with normal people who refuse to bloody notice what&#39;s right in front of their stupid faces?<br><br>In other words, &quot;perfect&quot; isn&#39;t always perfect, and it&#39;s a lot more fun when it isn&#39;t. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(I should&#39;ve posted this three days ago. Ugh, being distracted...)<br>Patience. I had to try about four times for Permission. Those tries are spread over a whole year, with a lot of close work with people - VM, Nesh, EF - who write better than me and a lot of concrit in between. The difference taking concrit to heart makes is enormous. The downside? Good concrit points your exact failures, and it hurts. Nobody likes to be told exactly what they did wrong. Still, it&#39;s for the best.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>First off: this is not a question to ask <i>after</i> you&#39;ve posted a Permission request. This is something you make absolutely sure you understand long before you put an agent in writing and submit them. That said:<br><br>Yes. I am really not cool with an agent who is invulnerable, and moreover, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve thought him through on that count - for example, how long would a skeleton last in a Minecraft &#39;fic? Shoot him three times, and you&#39;ve got urple bonemeal, and he may dissolve in a puff of green sparkles on a sapling, or live on forever in the form of tall grass and scattered flowers.<br><br>But what really bothers me is that you didn&#39;t ask this question <i>before</i> you applied; on that count alone my impression would be to say no, because it makes me think you are not putting enough thought into your agents and requests. My second impression would be to say no because it&#39;s been two and a half weeks since your last request, and one of the things said to you was that you needed to participate more in the community. I&#39;ve already said this to you elsewhere, but I think it bears repeating: Participation is not just posting threads. You&#39;ve posted a lot of threads - actually, to the point where it&#39;s bordered on thread-spamming, pushing other topics off the edge before their time. But I have not seen you reply to anyone else&#39;s threads, and even on your own threads, I have seen you outright ignore any replies disagreeing with you. This is Not Okay. The PPC is not a sounding box to hear your own voice echoed, it&#39;s a forum for discussion from all sides. To that end, I would like to see you stop posting all your own threads, and start engaging other people. Allow your interest to be engaged by new things! This is an important part of being a part of a community.<br><br>I know you&#39;ve said this is the Last Time you will ask for permission, but I&#39;d like you to reconsider that, and to hang around and work on your participation within the community. Give it another couple months or a year or somewhat, and <i>work on your writing</i>. You&#39;ve said things on the IRC that make me wonder if you&#39;re really serious about improving your writing, and I cannot stress this enough. If you want to be a writer, if you want your stories to be any good at all, you need to work on them often, and be prepared to improve. Write things that are not PPC-related. <i>Work on your dialogue</i>. Take criticism - your first reaction to multiple people saying &quot;This doesn&#39;t seem right&quot; should not be an explanation of why they are wrong, it should be to consider their critique and try to look at the piece objectively. Every writer starts out writing badly. Just keep going.<br><br>So. I said all that to say this: for now, I would say no, based on your community interactions, and the fact that one of your agents does not seem to be thought through very well, and your dialogue needs some work. But I urge you to continue working on your writing and your interactions, and to try again someday when you are confident that you have improved. Good luck, and I hope to see you around.</p>

            <p>Last night I was working on a story/background/origin type thing, and developed this exorcism for Mary Sues. My Latin isn&#39;t very good (I used Google Translate), so I would really appreciate people&#39;s opinions. <br>The text is:<br><b> Maria spiritu exsecrabбntur Sue. Tu tibi fama habitant abieris, et fuge in extrema inferni. Sint pura, pulchra canonicus, libera </b><br><br>which means<br><b>Detested Mary Sue spirit. You shall vacate the story you are inhabiting, and fly into the furthest reaches of hell. Be pure, fair canon, be free</b><br><br>If you like it, I would be honored if you&#39;d use it in any stories or Sporks that you&#39;re doing.<br><br>~TE</p>

            <p>I hardly ever see people drawing the chalk circle in the more recent missions, instead opting to restrain or surprise the possessed character before leaping at it and shouting. Also, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen the bit about the whisk in a mission. Normally, agents just hurl things at the Sue-wraith and break it apart, or the wraith flies out and vanishes after a few seconds of whining. I&#39;m not sure what carrying around a big whisk would be most useful for, really. Would someone need to perform the stirring motion in order to keep the wraith down, or just wave the whisk around in there? Would an incomplete stirring just give the wraith vertigo rather than destroy it? Wouldn&#39;t a whisk be too small for dispelling a wraith, assuming we aren&#39;t talking about an oar-sized stirring implement here?<br>And the bit at the end about the secondary method of ripping a page out of a book, shoving it down a possessed character&#39;s throat, and then hitting the character over the head with the rest of the book is not only sort of excessive, but it would ruin the book.</p>

            <p>This is really late now, because I thought I posted this several days ago. <br><br>That Latin translation is something that I think Kelok would actually use. He is good with languages and it&#39;s appropriate to canon. All the well educated people spoke Latin in Sherlock Holmes&#39; time. I bet I could even find a fic that throws in a few Latin terms to make it extra appropriate.<br><br>None of my agents have ever used a whisk, but they do normally draw the circle, and often light the candles depending on time and strength of their foe. They usually have some sort of large bell or other source of noise, and canon source materials that they whack the affected canons about the head with while shouting various imprecations. Then they fairly frequently lob the canon source material through the wraith (phantom) to dissipate it.  Of course, tying up the canons before setting this ritual up is always a good idea, too.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve mentioned that I&#39;ve been working on rewriting the Mary Sue article on the wiki again, because the current version has some flaws and doesn&#39;t quite say what it needs to say.

I need this definition challenged with specific examples to see how well it holds up—further, I&#39;m expecting this to rule out some enjoyable, well-constructed characters that might have been considered Sues under previous definitions, so I need to see how well that works. I need suggestions for how to make the writing more clear. I need questions if you have no idea what the heck I&#39;m talking about. I could definitely stand suggestions for how to trim it down, because I&#39;ve thrown an awful lot of words at this one, and I don&#39;t know how many of them are strictly warranted.

            <p>I like it. But, honestly, if I had come to this article trying to find out why the PPC killed my wonderful original character calling him a Mary Sue, I would have stopped reading after “We of the PPC are attempting a fairly unique thing in that we&#39;re seeking to define &quot;Mary Sue&quot; not in terms of what it <b>does</b>...” For Eru’s sake, I just came from the mission report, where the agents rant about what my OC <b>did</b> to the poor canon. I would never see the sixth paragraph of your chapter “Flat vs. Dynamic”.<br><br>Maybe it would help to say, somewhere near the top, where everybody can see it, something like “For most practical purposes of the PPC&#39;s agents, Mary Sues and Gary Stus are original characters in fan fiction, who, rather than fitting into the world where their story is assumed to happen, warp this world until it fulfills their needs”, and then give the more detailed explanations.<br><br>I seconde what Huinesoron said concerning Primary and Secondary Traits, specifically “What I think we need is a section that specifically debunks the idea that these traits are anything other than common characteristics of Sues.”<br><br>Your use of the word “Stus” (already pointed out by doctorlit) stood out to me because you never mentioned that a male “Mary Sue” is sometimes called “Gary Stu”, so readers may not understand what you are talking about.<br><br>May speaking about “Sues and Stus” in plural help to avoid the he/she/it-problem?<br><br> I spotted a mistake: <i> we&#39;re only shown that <b>the</b> she is more powerful than weaklings and fools.</i> “The” shouldn’t be there.<br></p>

            <p>We definitely need to mention the name Gary-Stu, and probably the other variants (I&#39;m pretty sure Jay and Acacia used &#39;Marty-Sam&#39; back in the day).

As an example from a mission I&#39;m working on at the moment: the scene I&#39;m playing with was a very boring sequence of Anneliese opening some presents... stupid presents:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Anneliese unwrapped her presents, beginning with the smallest one. It was a ring. More specifically:<br><br><i>It was the ring that my father proposed to my mother with. I had the same ring size that my mother did. I put the ring on my finger, it was an unusual ring though. The ring was in the shape of the dragon, with emerald green eyes. When I put the ring on my finger, a small green shock went through my hand.</i><br><br>A shock went through me, too, and not a small one. “That’s Finrod’s ring!” I hissed to Nyx. “I’d know it anywhere! She’s filed down one of the snake heads and broken off the flowers, but it is! ‘Like to twin serpents, whose eyes were emeralds, and their heads met beneath a crown of golden flowers, that the one upheld and the other devoured’.”<br><br>“You mean the Ring of Barahir?” Nyx asked. “The one Finrod gave to him after that one battle? I thought Aragorn was meant to have that…”<br><br>“He is,” I growled. “Filthy Sue – don’t take things that aren’t yours!”<br><br>“We’ll get it back to him,” Nyx assured me. “What else has she got?”<br><br>The Sue opened a dragon-shaped pendant next, and I grimaced. “Why don’t they realise using dragons for decoration would be like painting a jolly Hitler mural?” I asked – then gaped as the picture in the locket changed with what the Sue was thinking. “And that is not-!”<br><br>Nyx’s hand clamped over my mouth. “Not so loud!” she hissed. “We’ve got a long way to go before we can kill her.”<br><br>I grunted, and she released me. “Maybe that’s why she got the boots,” I muttered. “But no, it has to be a big mystery, doesn’t it? And… oh, my.”<br><br>According to the Words, <i>In the giant wrapped package, there was a gleaming silver and black sword. I looked closer at it, and on the blade it said: Simarillion. As soon as I held the handle, it..it buzzed. Like it was coming to life..?</i><br><br>“That’s…” Nyx was as stunned as I was.<br><br>“It can’t be.”<br><br>“It <i>is</i>! ‘Silver and black’, with writing on the blade, and it buzzes… it’s an <i>electric carving knife!</i>”<br><br>Sure enough Anneliese’s new prized possession (presumably she needed it after having dropped her sword,bow at the Council) was a brand-new ‘Simarillion’-brand stainless steel carving knife, with a handy motor built into the handle. I couldn’t contain myself any longer: whatever the danger of discovery, I burst out laughing.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Anneliese doesn&#39;t grow as a character by getting these presents: she just ups her &#39;mysterious coolness&#39; quotient. To take the example of being given her mother&#39;s engagement ring: she doesn&#39;t react to it at all. When, later, it (I think) turns out to be magic, it&#39;s not because she&#39;s spent any time trying to understand it: she was just handed it on a plate. In this case, the actions are symptoms, and by looking at and discussing them, we dissect the disease itself (flatness).<br><br>I think one word which might help to sort out the difference between &#39;do&#39; and &#39;be&#39; is &#39;unrealistic&#39; - or specifically &#39;unrealistic for the setting&#39;. That is actually paraphrased in Neshomeh&#39;s first full paragraph, as &#39;It achieves its goals with minimal effort, out of proportion to what the audience would expect given the setting(s), culture(s), and other natives of the universe it inhabits&#39;, which is also a paraphrase for your &#39;for most practical purposes&#39; suggestion. I think that (as the first sentence that isn&#39;t &#39;this is the subject of the article&#39;) is the line that needs to be edited into the ground. As on Wikipedia, the lead should summarise the entire article - not just the &#39;Expanding the Definition&#39; section.<br><br>hS talks too much </p>

            <p>after reading lots of them. I also understand why all these details must be there.

I want a short explanation of what they mean by “Mary Sue” (because I have heard that Mary Sue is a beautiful girl loved by everybody, but my OC is a dude), and why being a “Mary Sue” is a death-worthy crime. What I find is a highbrowed essay which doesn’t seem to relate to my recent experience, and it’s no fun to read all these sophisticated and super-scientific sentences, but I do understand that Mary Sue can be male, but then I feel mocked again when it says that it doesn’t matter what Mary Sue does, it’s all about how he’s written, but they just killed my OC for what he did, like joining the fellowship, inventing an un-canonical spell, putting (totally imaginary) antlers on Capt’n Jack Sparrows head and causing an even more imaginary punctuation storm. So they’re all nuts and I don’t need to read further – ”<br><br>and it is really difficult for me to rant on in this alien language, but I hope you see what I mean.<br><br>Maybe this imaginary fourteen-year-old just looks in the wrong place, it’s all covered in the “FAQ: for Other People”?<br><br>Nyx Nightingale in an actual mission and her partner seems to be a Noldor?

            <p>(Well, I don&#39;t know, but I gave you the benefit of the doubt, and now I <i>do</i> know, so yes) I just really like giving examples.<br><br>I think the key is that the Wiki is primarily for <i>us</i> to use, as a reference guide. If I were a new PPC writer who wanted to do a mission in the DMS, I&#39;d want to know how we define &#39;Mary-Sue&#39; so I didn&#39;t get it messed up. It&#39;s also very useful next time someone starts telling us how we hate women (not recently, thank the stars, but it&#39;s happened a few times).<br><br>All of which means that the answer to &#39;why did my awesome character get a PiPiSee story written about it?&#39; <i>should</i> be in the FAQ For Other People. And, indeed, it may well be buried in there somewhere - but that FAQ is, er, raaaaather confrontational. I&#39;m not sure it really serves its intended purpose. That should probably be worked on...<br><br>On the other leaf (er, hand - sorry, writing about Flowers right now), we probably need to discuss exactly that point in the &#39;Mary-Sue&#39; article: that missions will probably talk (and charge) about physical traits and actions, rather than fundamental flaws... I think it&#39;d be good to encourage doing both, so I&#39;m trying to do so myself:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>“The interesting thing,” I commented to Nyx, finding a place on a convenient rock, “is that she’s basically describing the movie, but <i>still</i> manages to mess it up.”<br><br>“That applies to about half the chapter,” Nyx agreed. “Of course, then she has to be clumsy and get her cloak tangled in a bush…”<br><br>“Now, be fair,” I chided her, as the ‘Crebain from Dunland’ scene played out. “She may just be legitimately clumsy. Frodo certainly is. And in this case, it puts the Fellowship in actual danger.”<br><br>“Possible,” Nyx agreed, glancing over to where <i>Legolas tried his best to untangle my black and green cloak without tearing it.</i> “However, I have three… no, four counter-points. Firstly, she’s an elf – I don’t think they’re capable of being clumsy.”<br><br>“True enough.” I grimaced. “I’d been doing my best to forget she’d claimed that.”<br><br>“Secondly, she’s using the scene to throw Legolas out of character – note how he tried <i>not</i> to rip her cloak, even though failing would mean the potential failure of the entire Quest. I don’t care how special it is – he should have grabbed his dagger and cut her free.”<br><br><i>“Aistaraina..stay completely still..” Legolas whispered to me. Thinking quickly, I pulled my cloak over my head. A few crebain flew right by me. My cloak wasn’t camouflaging with the background. I was frozen on the spot…..</i><br><br>“Thirdly,” Nyx went on, ignoring the flock of crows, “she just followed ‘thinking quickly’ with an immediate realisation that she wasn’t actually hidden. That’s not quick thinking, that’s stupidly doing the exact wrong thing.”<br><br>“I’ll add it to the charge list,” I promised. “And since I’m now suitably chastened-“<br><br>“And <i>fourthly</i>,” Nyx cut me off as the next chapter opened to Anneliese mysteriously not being mobbed by crows, “the whole incident only happened to make her more Speshul.”<br><br><hr>
<br><br>And since you asked... how long that mission takes depends on lots of factors. The current holdup is that I need to check something in <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> - specifically, whether in the film the Fellowship leave the Chamber of Mazarbul through the same door they entered - but in general, it&#39;s taking a long time to write. It will be released eventually, though - hopefully not <i>too</i> far in the future.<br><br>(And yes, he&#39;s a Noldo. His <i>first</i> mission will probably come out before that one, actually...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I just finished re-watching the extended editions so it&#39;s pretty fresh in my memory. When they enter the Chamber you can see clearly the shaft of light coming down to illuminate Balin&#39;s tomb from the far wall. After the battle (as Gandalf says &quot;To the Bridge of Khazad-Dыm&quot;), the next scene shows the Fellowship entering another pillared hall with the light beam shining above them across the hall. <br><br>Ergo either they exit the Chamber via the rear wall or else PJ made a continuity error and had a suddenly-appearing beam of light. <br><br>Elcalion </p>

            <p>It emphasises the main points of Sue and really hammers out why we see them as anti-feminist, amongst other things. Also, will the final be using the meme drawing I posted months ago?

            <p>I very much like this.  I think it&#39;s comprehensive enough to alleviate outside readers&#39; concerns about us specifically hating on female characters.<br><br>That said, in the sentence: &quot;Other Sues, and Stus in particular, may be described as being unnaturally buff . . .&quot; I think maybe &quot;Stus&quot; should be changed to &quot;male Sues&quot; to match up with the use of &quot;female Sues&quot; in the previous sentence.  As it is, it feels a bit contradictory of the earlier statement that the PPC uses &quot;Mary Sue&quot; as a blanket term for all Suvians.<br><br>Also, the reference link to &quot;A Trekkie&#39;s Tale&quot; is broken.

            <p>First of all, I think it&#39;s really, really good. I like all the examples, because they really do the show, not tell. That, I think, is where the &quot;awful lot of words&quot; come from. I don&#39;t think it needs to be trimmed, because more explanation helps to cover more complexities.<br><br>A few things, though:<br><br>It&#39;s bugging me to keep seeing &quot;it&quot;. I know there&#39;s no good gender-neutral pronoun, but well, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing">&quot;it&quot; is dehumanizing</a>. While Mary Sues can be labeled as &quot;it&quot;, I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s just me, but I think of good characters as if they are humans (or whatever living species), not as objects. Maybe &quot;they&quot;? Or, since it&#39;s specified at the beginning that female pronouns are used as blanket nouns, maybe use those?<br><br>In conclusion, the English language needs a gender-neutral pronoun.<br><br>2. About the &quot;I&#39;m expecting this to rule out some enjoyable, well-constructed characters that might have been considered Sues under previous definitions&quot;, I think overall this succeeded. I love the sentence &quot;The traits discussed here are symptoms, though, not the disease, and any individual one can be written in a way that works.&quot; However, that sentence is on top of primary traits. I&#39;m a bit confused - how can writing characters OOC be done well, except in parody? (And I don&#39;t count, for example, a situation where Spock shows his emotions as OOC unless it&#39;s badly explained, which it usually is.) Perhaps that sentence should be moved to the top of secondary traits.<br><br>Also, I feel like labeling good characters as Sues for superficial traits is something very common, so it might be good to make the sentence more forceful. Something like &quot;It&#39;s very important to remember that the traits discussed here are symptoms, not the disease, and any individual one can be written in a way that works.&quot; Possibly bolded.<br><br>Then again, that could be just me hating that Seven of Nine gets called a Mary Sue because she&#39;s hot and has a tragic past (written well).<br><br>So yeah, those are my thoughts for now.<br></p>

            <p>I agree that the article needs pronoun consistency. Despite the fact that we say that &#39;she&#39; is used generically (which it is), I don&#39;t think we should use it that way in the article - it makes too many implicit statements. Equally, &#39;he&#39; shouldn&#39;t be used generically here (also, using &#39;he&#39; to talk about &#39;Mary-Sue&#39; would be kind of weird).<br><br>When it comes to &#39;it&#39; and &#39;they&#39;... well:<br><br><i>When a Mary Sue faces a problem, either it overcomes the obstacle easily with the powers or abilities it already possesses...</i><br><br><i>When a Mary Sue faces a problem, either they overcome the obstacle easily with the powers or abilities they already possess...</i><br><br>There&#39;s nothing <i>wrong</i> with the second version - it&#39;s grammatically correct these days - but I don&#39;t like it. ;) That said, it&#39;s not as awkward as I was afraid it was going to be. Given that this article is about distinguishing &#39;Sues from good characters, &#39;it&#39; wouldn&#39;t be appropriate in the case of a character who could go either way (and it would be jarring to change halfway through a sentence: &#39;Either it is flat, or they are dynamic&#39;).<br><br>With all that in mind, I think I&#39;d vote for singular &#39;they&#39; throughout (despite my objections), shifting to &#39;he&#39; and &#39;she&#39; where it is specific to one or the other, and never using &#39;it&#39; of a character.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Actually, I think that the one solution that you overlooked is the best solution in this case: the plural &quot;they&quot;. Since the article talks about Mary-Sues in general, I think that using a plural &quot;they&quot; unless a singular subject is absolutely necessary resolves all problems: there are no gender issues, and it is not as grammatically awkward as a singular &quot;they,&quot; thus:<br><br><i>When Mary Sues face a problem, either they overcome the obstacle easily with the powers or abilities they already possess...</i><br><br>BUT<br><br><i>In Sue stories, instead of [gender bias] being something that forces the character to struggle and work extra-hard to achieve her goals, a Sue will instantly remove the obstacle by humiliating a token biased man...</i><br><br>So I&#39;d go for plural &quot;they&quot;, switching to the requisite singular pronoun whenever needed.</p>

            <p>First off, I definitely prefer plural-&quot;they&quot; over singular-&quot;they,&quot; and I can switch over to that if people feel really strongly about it. However, there are some reasons I used &quot;it&quot; in the first place:<br><br>1. I don&#39;t have a problem with dehumanizing Mary Sues, which are neither real people nor even good characters. They aren&#39;t treated as real people/characters anywhere in the PPC—which is one reason assassinating them is not considered murder—and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason they should be.<br><br>2. &quot;It&quot; is forcefully a-gendered, which I think is really important here. A fictional character doesn&#39;t have a gender until it&#39;s assigned one by its author, so while we&#39;re talking about the abstract concept of a Mary Sue, I don&#39;t want to give anyone the slightest chance of assuming we mean all girls all the time just because the concept happens to have a girl&#39;s name. I think using &quot;it&quot; is a very efficient way to force the brain to discard gender assumptions.<br><br>3. This doesn&#39;t directly have anything to do with the article, but it&#39;s healthy to be able to look at your own characters objectively, as the role they play in the story rather than the emotional connection you have with them. It&#39;s a lesson a lot of authors, including Suethors, have to learn in order to accept criticism and use it to improve their writing. If there&#39;s a chance that using this language can snap anyone&#39;s mind out of the notion that Mary Sues are precious little darlings that shouldn&#39;t be criticized because of the emotional damage to their authors who love them so, I think we should do it.<br><br><br>To sum up, I&#39;m deliberately trying to mess with people&#39;s heads in order to create new understanding. If it doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;ll discard it, but that&#39;s why I did it this way.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I would move the two bits in Expanding the Definition down to Primary Traits, the bits that are currently in Primary Traits down to Secondary Traits, and get rid of the current Secondary Traits entirely.<br><br>Here is my reasoning.

How many times has someone come to us and said &quot;I found this character with all of these Secondary Traits.

            <p>Disagreement first: I don&#39;t think &#39;Expanding the Definition&#39; should be &#39;Primary Traits&#39;. It is what it says - an expansion, with specific contrasts and discussion. It&#39;s a &#39;this is what we mean by that&#39;, not a set of traits per se.<br><br>However, I do agree that &#39;primary&#39; should be moved to &#39;secondary&#39;. To answer hermione&#39;s question about when OOC characters can be well-written - most of the current primary traits are very much workable in an AU setting. How would the Ring War have been different if Aragorn had been more like Boromir - ie, somewhat arrogant, and very susceptible to the Ring? Heck, what would have happened if the hereditary leader of the Rangers of the North had been a cruel, cold character (let&#39;s call him &#39;Aragorn&#39;, since that&#39;s his name) - and then happened on four hobbits and a magic Ring in Bree?<br><br>But they are, usually, bad things. That doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a Mary-Sue involved. A perfectly good character can still be in a story where the rules of the world are ignored.<br><br>Actually, the way they are explained on the page, the &#39;Primary&#39; traits pretty much <i>are</i> inexcusable. A little tweaking to add a few &#39;without explanation&#39;s and the like would make them purely indicative of bad writing - without, of course, necessarily making for a Suefic.<br><br>I would suggest, then, retitling &#39;Primary Traits&#39; to something like &#39;Other bad writing&#39; (only better phrased ;)) and letting it stand as a &#39;This sort of bad writing doesn&#39;t necessarily make for a Mary-Sue, but it does mark a badly-written story of the sort in which they often appear&#39;.<br><br>As to the &#39;Secondary Traits&#39;... I don&#39;t think removing them is the right answer. Like it or not (and I don&#39;t, particularly), people in and out of the PPC will see things like &#39;a flowing waterfall of gold-and-violet curls&#39; and think &#39;Mary-Sue&#39;. If we don&#39;t mention that fact, people are going to be rather confused as to why we&#39;re using the word.<br><br>What I think we need is a section that specifically <i>debunks</i> the idea that these traits are anything other than common characteristics of Sues. That is, something that points out firmly that a) a non-flat character cannot be a Mary-Sue, b) Mary-Sues can only be identified by the quality (or lack thereof) of their writing, c) <b>but</b> that many people will assume that any character with the following traits is a &#39;Sue, even though any of them - or all of them together - can be written well.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My conception is that the traits are the various ways the flatness and &quot;tell&quot;iness of Mary Sues tend to express in practice. The Primary Traits are things that almost always happen to allow Sues to get through their stories without developing. The Secondary Traits are a selection of things we&#39;re often told about Sues to trick us into thinking they&#39;re interesting. I can definitely spell that out more clearly. Also, I agree that adding some &quot;without explanation&quot;s and some debunking is needed.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It seems like you got the traits of a Sue mainly correct over the course of the article. However, I disagree somewhat with the definition: &quot;an unintentionally flat fictional character.&quot;<br><br>I think that your usage of &quot;unintentionally&quot; is in order to separate Sues from trollfic characters. If so, my opinion is that that distinction needs to be fleshed out in the article, but not necessarily mentioned in the definition.<br><br>Also, since you distinguished between Sues and bits (&quot;It&#39;s perfectly fine to intentionally design a one-note character to enter, play their part, and exit, but if the main character—the one who has to engage the readers and carry them through the story—never develops, that&#39;s a sign of poor characterization and story-telling.&quot;) then maybe your definition should say &quot;an unintentionally flat fictional <i>main</i> character.&quot;<br><br>However, I have been quite a fan of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=239059;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the formulation that you made quite a while ago</a>: a Sue &quot;A. does not behave like a believable-for-the-context person, B. does not get believable-for-the-context treatment from others, and C. is successful just because the plot says so.&quot; So let me suggest this to the Board: perhaps <i>that</i> should be the definition, since I believe we all agree that that is the essence of what a Sue is and does.</p>

            <p>The fact that Sues are usually main characters is expressed in the line &quot;It is almost always the central focus of its story.&quot;  I&#39;m not sure why I wrote it that way instead of saying &quot;It is almost always the main character of its story,&quot; so that&#39;s something I can change.<br><br>As for the definition, the ABCs there are only half the picture. I think they don&#39;t quite cover the &quot;show vs tell&quot; problem that results in what we call speshulness.<br><br>That&#39;s part of why &quot;unintentionally&quot; is in the definition, actually. Sues tend to be loaded down with attributes that are supposed to make them interesting, but it doesn&#39;t work, because interest comes from actions and growth, not attributes. They are flat despite the fact that they are emphatically meant to be the most interesting, coolest, bestest characters ever, so &quot;unintentionally&quot; is an important word. The fact that it also distinguishes Sues from bit characters, trolls, parodies, etc. is incidental.<br><br>I hope that makes sense. Thanks for the feedback!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>&quot;We&#39;ve got another one!&quot; Ranger Christianne Shieh shouted at her co-pilot Eledhwen Elerossiel as the alarm began to blare. &quot;Category Four Kaisue in Lord of the Rings!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Category Four?!&quot; demanded Eledhwen as she sat up on her bed and stared incredulously at her co-pilot. &quot;We have never taken on a category four Kaisue.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re finally giving us the big fishies, Ellie, come on.&quot;<br><br>They -- the Sunflower Marshall, amidst others -- had seen odder pilot pairings in the Jaegers of the Plot Continuum; an elleth and a human was almost normal in comparison to others. However, Christianne had seen more than a reasonable amount of co-pilot deaths; she had survived the death of two previous co-pilots and forced to finish missions solo twice. Medical kept on insisting that she be barred from her Jaeger, the Plenary Fanatic, because surely the next mission would be her last.<br><br>Losing two people who had seen all of her and her baggage when they entered her mind had left mental scars. But Eledhwen seemed to have healed them well enough. As Christianne and Eledhwen geared up in the Drivesuit Room, as they initiated their neural handshake in their Conn-Pod, Christianne dove into the elleth&#39;s mind and felt the elleth do the same to her, and relished in the tranquillity of her co-pilot&#39;s headspace. <br><br>Together, they could take down any Kaisue in their way.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s cool to see the level of trust your Agents - sorry, <i>Rangers</i> - have with each other, and the confidence that it gives them.<br><br>You also inspired me to write a piece. Sadly, my Rangers have <s>compentence</s> trust issues...<br><br><br>Jaegers of the Plot Continuum: The Dysfunctional Duo
<br>“Beginning drift test 37.” There was a certain weariness to the voice from Mission Control that suggested it had already been a long day, with no end in sight. <br><br>Skeet looked across at Amy, both of them strapped in to their piloting harnesses. According to their initial aptitude tests, they were drift compatible – and they could easily initiate the drift, it was just maintaining that level of trust and depth of connection that was proving insurmountable. <br><br>“Let’s try not to screw up this time, shall we?”<br><br>Amy’s only response was to glare at him.<br><br><i>Yeah, this is gonna go sooooo well</i>, thought Skeet. <br><br>“Initiating drift synch test in 3... 2... 1... drifting.”<br><br>The two experienced a weird sense of dislocation, almost like being in freefall, and then they were each stumbling around the slightly familiar landscape of their partners’ mind. <br><br>::Neural handshake established. Jaeger ready for combat.:: The voice of the support A.I., known as the Ghost in the Machine, echoed throughout the control centre and the Conn-Pod. <br><br>In Mission Control, the Marquis leaned forward, a slight adjustment of his petals giving the impression that he was scrutinising the readouts. <i>Well, they’re holding it together. For now.</i><br><br>If the two of them could just make it through the tests successfully, then Logistics and Personnel would have another unit that could be assigned to active duty. <br><br>“Beginning movement test. Bring your unit forward slowly please, pilots.”<br><br>Skeet felt the neurons fire in Amy’s mind as she complied with the instruction, and he responded in kind.<br><br>Those in Mission Control watched as the Jaeger, named Pax Fictionala, began to move. Unfortunately it stumbled as it tried to step off with its left leg and right leg simultaneously. <br><br>Automatic restraints activated, preventing the Jaeger from falling, and returned it to the rest position. The drift bond dissolved.<br><br>“What the hell was that?” Amy asked, “The instructors said to lead with the left leg!” <br><br>“Well, I always lead with my right.”<br><br>The airlock to the Conn-Pod opened, and a group of DoSAT technicians filtered in, silently helping the prospective Rangers out of their harnesses while they continued to bicker. Hot on their heels was a swarm of cat-like creatures, who congregated around Amy while managing to remain just shy of tripping up any of the technicians. <br><br>“And what do the instructors know anyway?” Skeet continued, “They’re not Rangers. I bet they have the wrong sort of brain for piloting – that’s why they became instructors. I bet they’re all analytical and fluffy, over-thinky types. You need focus and determination to pilot a Jaeger.”<br><br>“Yeah, well, for reference: your brain? <i>So</i> not like that.”<br><br>“At least mine’s not all pink and fluffy!” <br><br>“Not fluffy? Have you seen how easily you get distracted?”<br><br>“It’s not my fault; mechs are awesome – the fact that I&#39;m actually piloting one, it’s just makes me fanboy a little, that’s all. I can control it.” Skeet said, sounding defensive. <br><br>“Wait, so you’re saying that the fact that you’re <i>piloting a Jaeger</i> is a <i>distraction from</i> piloting the Jaeger. Do you even <i>listen</i> to yourself!?”<br><br>“Ummm... if I&#39;m honest, not so much.”<br><br>Amy threw up her hands in exasperation and stalked off, her menagerie of minis picking up on her mood and thrashing their tails in agitation.<br><br>Something hit Skeet in his shin, and he looked down to see another mini-Mogget, this one with sleek black fur, headbutting him again in greeting. <br><br>“Hey Garth, how you doing?” Skeet crouched down and began fussing over the mini, first stroking the top of his head and chin, then playing a game with him. The mini rolled over onto his back, inviting Skeet to scratch his belly, but every time Skeet’s hand got too close, Garth nixes would swipe at it. Skeet could avoid the ‘attacks’ for the most part, and their movements settled into a comfortable rhythm. Whenever he was too slow, Garth would retract his claws before the contact.<br><br>“Huh, I’ve probably got a better synchronisation rate with <i>you</i> than I do with Amy...”<br><br>The human and the mini looked into each other’s eyes, then turned to look down the corridor where the Pax Fictionala waited, then back at each other.<br><br>“This is a spectacularly stupid idea, isn’t it?” said Skeet.<br><br>“Meow?”<br></p>

            <p>And also because those robots are controlled by two pilots, not one, and they need a way to effectively coordinate their actions. The Drift enables them to become one mind, each pilot controlling half of the robot&#39;s mind.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not about giant robots and cool toys. It&#39;s about the humans that pilot them. The Drift is merely a new level of trust that allows the pilots of the Jaeger&#39;s to trust each other like no other. If you had just one guy piloting the thing, then there&#39;s no use for the emotional aspect of the film with all of that chemistry and friendship between Mako and Raleigh. There&#39;s no absolute pain and devastation at Raleigh&#39;s brother&#39;s death because he didn&#39;t share that mental bond with Raleigh.<br><br>So while the Drift might seem superfluous to you, I think it represents the heart of the film. The film&#39;s about trust and teamwork and takes it to a new level by adding that human element to what would normally seem to be a detached job, battling monsters with giant robots. <br><br>Also, it clearly stated in the opening that the neural load for one pilot was lethal and that they have lost Jaeger pilots trying to drive the thing alone. I believe they go into detail in the comics.<br><br>Sorry if that seems snippy; the Drift is my favourite part of the film, and without it I feel like a great deal of the rest of the story would not have been as good or as compelling. It would&#39;ve just been another giant robot movie, and that&#39;s not exactly exciting.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m so confused right now. I don&#39;t know who this guy is, so I looked up his IMDB page and I saw that he haven&#39;t been in anything I&#39;ve seen, except for Torchwood, where he can&#39;t have made a big impression since I don&#39;t remember him at all.<br><br>And then my higher brain functions come back from coffee break and kick me. He was in Torchwood? But that&#39;s the same canon as Doctor Who! Aren&#39;t they the same? Mostly separate but definitely the same? So how can someone who have already played a role in the canon (and it was across multiple episodes, so it can&#39;t have been a small one) play the Doctor?<br><br>Do you think they&#39;ll reference it somehow? Or will they just never mention it?</p>

            <p>The Doctor is almost always a virtually unknown actor.

            <p>Oh, I know that they choose a relatively unknown actor for the role (which does not stop me or anyone else from participating in the who-do-you-want-to-see-as-the-new-Doctor?-game). I&#39;m just puzzled by the fact that this time the role went to someone who has already had a role in the canon, albeit in a different series.<br>I know it&#39;s not the first time, but with someone like Eva Myles, she only had a small first role, before being recast as Gwen. Also they had an in-universe explanation (that Gwen was a descendant of the other character) and I&#39;m really curious to see, whether they will address the recasting here or never mention it.</p>

            <p>Colin Baker played a Gallifreyan guard named Maxil in a Fifth Doctor story before being cast as the Sixth Doctor, and that was never mentioned again, despite how much fun a story dealing with that could be. Just think about it: two incarnations of the Doctor, working at the same time in the same place, but working to fight off threats just different enough that neither can reveal their identity to the other, but every once in a while, it could overlap their stories to show what the other was doing in the previous episode/other side of the conflict.<br>Of course, since the Doctor Who-canon characters played previously by Peter Capaldi were indisputably human, and one of them died, that&#39;s not something that can happen now, either, but there&#39;s always a possibility of an actor allusion at some point.</p>

            <p>From the few examples we have, all of the Clara copies shared many of her personality traits. Amy is very little like Clara, even if it can be assumed that the process that threw Claras across time-space made some of them look like different people.<br><br>At any rate, what would distinguish Amy in that way? Because she was the Doctor&#39;s companion? Would your idea being true mean that every companion was also Clara, or would every woman who helped the Doctor secretly be Clara? Where would it end? Would every human in the universe secretly be Clara Oswald? Or would every single humanoid, regardless of species or gender, simply be versions of Clara that strayed farther and farther from the template and had their physical and genetic structure warped as they strayed from Clara Prime?<br><br>But if everyone is Clara... no one would be.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not saying, specifically, that this is a Suefic; just that it&#39;s okay, in general, to like them. Personally, I do consider this protagonist to be somewhat of a Sue - definitely not worthy of sporking, and not completely a Sue, but possesses some Sueish traits. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the fic itself is bad, however; the SPaG seems to be fine, as does the characterization (mostly). So, overall, I think the story itself is decent, but that the main character is a bit of a Sue.</p>

            <p>I admit, I&#39;m not far in, but while she does slightly come off as a bit &#39;sueish&#39; it&#39;s hardly a crime (so far as I&#39;ve seen). And if you still enjoy the fics, more power to you. <br><br>Though this personal opinion might change later as I continue reading; the way I see it, if you like it, then you like it.

Metal Gear?<br><br>5) Eragon can&#39;t see the future. Only Angela can.<br><br>So, we&#39;ve got canon inaccuracy, but SPaG, forgetting that a large island is lethal just to be on, a possible Sue, and a Dragon Rider because obviously that&#39;s where this was going.</p>

            <p>I just read the first chapter. There&#39;s some undoubtedly-bad writing there (the sentence fragments, they burn!) and a few breaks with canon (Vroengard etc) but my overall impression (admittedly from one chapter) is that it&#39;s perhaps not bad enough to be PPC-worthy.<br><br>Remember that we aim to only spork fics that are undisputedly-bad, and that when picking a fic to be sporked you should be thinking &quot;will this be funny if I spork it?&quot;.<br><br>This is especially timely with the discussion down the Board sparked by Polite Dissent - the fact that a fic has some inaccuracies or deviates from canon does not automatically mean the PPC comes in and smacks it down. We take on fics that are undisputedly bad, and <i>which will be amusing when sporked</i>.<br><br>Just having bad SPaG, or a few breaks of canon, or being a girl-falls-into-Alagaesia story is not really enough to justify going to the effort of sporking it, IMHO - a mediocre fic that is just generally bad but not amusingly bad is unlikely to be an entertaining PPC mission.<br><br>Elcalion, kinda-ashamed to admit he&#39;s read the entire Inheritance Cycle.</p>

            <p>There are canon breaks, most definitely, and pretty major ones at that. There are technical errors here and there. The MC is bland, and the plot is clichй. But I don&#39;t think it qualifies as badfic. I read about three chapters in, and while thoroughly mediocre, it&#39;s definitely not spork-worthy, and I&#39;ve written worse things in past years. :D<br>This seems like the writing of an improving author, not a true Suethor or badfic writer.

            <p>I&#39;d say it sounds like the sort of name someone would bestow on themselves after they rise to a position of power, and felt that they no longer would should be tied to their previous one, which would probably have been something mundane, with only one or two syllables.<br>It&#39;s an overblown sort of name, like the being who created it and expected it to be said alongside a few grandiose titles. So, it gives the preface for arrogance and ego in the character. Of course, whether he acknowledges that the name is overblown or whether he thinks it&#39;s fitting for him would be important bits of reference for further analysis.</p>

            <p>It seems interesting, a bit fantastical. Honestly, my first thoughts were &quot;overkill&quot; and &quot;What if you have fans who want to rave about him/her who can&#39;t spell it?&quot; I suppose you could have a catchy nickname, like Zara or Rathy, and if it does have a fitting meaning that will be explained in the story, then I think it would be fine. Overall, it&#39;s a bit elaborate for my taste, but it could work, especially if it was indeed significant to the plot or char-dev.<br><br>-- Len</p>

            <p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.dorktower.com/2013/01/07/make-good-gaiman-dork-tower-07-01-13/">this Dork Tower</a>, I can&#39;t help but wonder what other authors&#39; grocery lists look like. Here&#39;s a few that VM and I put together:<br><br><b>Tom Clancy:</b><br>Straightforward, but good. You could swear that the handwriting changes on every one of them, though...<br><br><b>J.R.R. Tolkien:</b><br>The list is written in three languages that he invented for the purpose. Once you get through the hundreds of pages of appendixes and supporting material, though, even a simple  cantaloupe holds unfathomably deep meaning.<br><br><b>George R.R. Martin</b><br>The list looks wrong. While digging out your phone to call home and check, you drop the eggs. When you get to the correct aisle, it&#39;s already sold out. Your phone&#39;s battery dies. You get run over by a car on the way home.<br><br><b>Neal Stephenson</b><br>It&#39;s the size of a phone book. While you&#39;re at the grocery store until well after their closing time, by the time you&#39;re done, you understand the computerization of industrial agriculture, Sumerian mythology, and the evolution of the common cold.<br><br><b>Corey Doctorow</b><br>Corey leaves grocery lists lying around. You find yourself buying groceries in the hopes that he&#39;ll write more of them.<br><br>Add your own!</p>

            <p><b>Dan Brown</b><br>The items on this list look quite interesting at first glance and it seems its author knows a lot about cooking - then you notice all of his lists follow the same format, half of the ingredients don&#39;t actually taste like he wrote they would, and the other half is just plain uncookable or not even edible.<br><br><b>My own</b> - yes, I am like that.<br>You see pages upon pages of scribblings detailing meals ranging from simple to elaborate, but no actual grocery list. There are no ingredients nor instructions on the papers you have.<br>You also notice most of these meals are variations on each other, with either one method of preparation or key ingredient changed in each iteration.<br>Some of it appears to be strange modifications of other authors&#39; dishes - odd attributes, food items that must certainly be toxic and are sometimes noted as such, the mention of a substance rendering the entire dish completely inedible, and so on.</p>

            <p>(Specifically, the <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i> series.)<br><br>The list is arranged in several parts, and the ingredients are rather exotic. Dragonfruit, descaled for easy handling, features heavily throughout. As you think about it, you realize some of the ingredients may be more exotic than they really need to be, and they drive up the price a bit. However, the meal itself is amazingly rich and colorful, and you can&#39;t help but go back for seconds.<br><br>Oh, and there are some extra pages tacked on the end in different handwriting, but after reading through the first couple (which make for dishes that are respectively moderately tasty and cliched yet bewildering), you decide to give the rest a miss.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My feeling about the difference between Anne and Todd is that Anne was a compulsive worldbuilder. It feels like she had a burning need to add something Big And New to each new book, and I actually think some of the later ones suffered from it - <i>Dolphins</i> and <i>Skies</i> in particular.<br><br>Todd, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t seem to want to add anything new - he just wants to explore what seems to be the entire lifespan of a handful of characters. Which isn&#39;t a bad notion - it&#39;s just not what we expect from Pern. This isn&#39;t helped by the fact that he writes the blessed things out of order.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the fact that fire lizards seem to pop up every book despite the fact that no-one ever knows they exist...<br><br>hS</p>

I couldn&#39;t enjoy it at all because I was groaning too much. I liked <i>Dragon&#39;s Kin</i> all right, though; learning more about watch-whers was fun. I just never recovered from <i>Dragonsblood</i> enough to want to find out what else Todd got up to with Pern.<br><br>I definitely agree that <i>Skies of Pern</i> suffered for reaching too far for the next big reveal, and I&#39;ve always disregarded dragon telekinesis in my headcanon. I was not convinced that was a thing that needed to happen.<br><br>I liked <i>Dolphins</i>, though. Perhaps mostly because I just like dolphins. And then I got to visit the Dolphin Research Center in the Florida Keys, which is where Anne did her research for the book, which was <i>awesome</i> even though I had a terrible cold the whole time.

            <p>The only thing that would be more awesome is if you met the dragons the ones in the book were based on. ;)<br><br>I agree that <i>Blood</i> stuck out a lot - you might be pleased to know that it&#39;s the only one of his (I think) that abuses timing it so shamefully. They <i>do</i> a fair amount more (y&#39;know, because it&#39;s common knowledge! That&#39;s why Lessa and Moreta had to discover it by accident!), but it&#39;s mostly the same as happened in... well, whenever it was they sent the hatchlings back to grow a new Weyr. My impulse is that it might even have been <i>Dragonflight</i>.<br><br>Dragon telekinesis? <i>What</i> dragon telekinesis? There can&#39;t be any such thing - no way would the Pernese have not noticed that any dragon which has something annoying crawling towards it can just move it out of the way. Nope, it was... you see, swamp gas, reflecting the light from Venus...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s see...<br><br><b>Terry Pratchett</b><br>The ingredients all look conventional at first glance - at second glance, you see he&#39;s got physically improbable items listed right after comically shaped vegetables, and you&#39;re laughing so hard you don&#39;t realize until you&#39;re nearly done that the ingredients also spell out heavy social commentary.<br><br>(Meh. Somebody else should take a crack at it, I don&#39;t think that quite hits it.)<br><br><b>James Joyce</b><br>Even if you <i>could</i> read the list through all the words you&#39;re pretty sure he made up and the strange not-quite-rhythm he&#39;s got going, you&#39;re pretty sure you don&#39;t want to know where you have to go to <i>get</i> all this stuff. And then you realize what the list is actually for, and you wind up too depressed to go to the store anyway.<br><br><b>Kim Stanley Robinson</b><br>Most of the ingredients on the list don&#39;t exist yet, but they&#39;re so realistic, you&#39;re sure someone will invent them by the time you get to the store, if we could just figure out <i>how</i>.<br><br>(And then you realize that someone has to start the industrial revolution so that we can actually <i>get</i> to the store, and it might as well be you, and I&#39;m losing track of this metaphor aren&#39;t I.)<br><br><b>Tamora Pierce</b><br>The list looks pretty traditional at first, but then you realize that most of the ingredients are clever alternatives to the usual commodities; when you&#39;re done, you find normal grocery lists disappointingly conventional.<br><br><b>Guy Kay</b><br>His lists look suspiciously like history lessons, but there&#39;s a flavor of Tolkien, somewhere, there, deep in the wording, and the language isn&#39;t quite of this world. And then, when you reach for the jars, you realize that the list is in your head. Again.<br><br><b>The Brothers Grimm</b><br>Everyone keeps talking about how clever and delicious their meals are, but you&#39;ve been staring at the list for ten minutes wondering why there appears to be blood spattered all over it, and where the goblins came from...<br><br>(Dann reminded me of some of the ones we had earlier.)<br><br><b>Shakespeare</b><br>It&#39;s all in iambic pentameter. And you could swear that he&#39;s making half these words up as he goes along to fit the meter.<br><br><b>C. S. Lewis</b><br>It looks like all the ingredients for a delicious meal, and it&#39;s only as you&#39;re finishing and clearing up that you realize the whole thing was actually an allegory...<br><br>---<br><br>Also, I think Doc&#39;s take on Lahaye &amp; Jenkins may be one of my favorites on the thread, but that can be blamed on Slacktivist&#39;s awesome takedown of the series. If you haven&#39;t read it, it&#39;s a most excellent (and utterly hilarious, and occasionally heartbreaking) blog series, some of the best matter-of-fact critiquing of bad (awful) (no, seriously, <i>utterly terrible</i>) literature (and theology - don&#39;t even get me <i>started</i> on the bad theology) I&#39;ve ever seen. Because it&#39;s gone on so long, the index is the best place to start: <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2011/08/07/left-behind-index-i-posts-1-50/">First</a>, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2011/08/09/left-behind-index-ii-posts-51-100/">Second</a>, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2011/08/10/left-behind-index-iii-posts-101-150/">Third</a>, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2011/08/11/left-behind-index-iv-posts-151-200/">Fourth</a>, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2011/08/16/left-behind-index-v-posts-201-250/">Fifth</a>, and <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2011/08/25/left-behind-index-vi-posts-251-300/">Sixth</a>. The series is ongoing, but after 300 you&#39;re on your own - they&#39;re pretty easy to find in the tags, and he&#39;s slowed down with them a bit lately.</p>

            <p>Techno-Dann&#39;s Tolkien and hermione of vulcan&#39;s Susanne Collins are great. Just so spot-on. :D<br>Um...

It&#39;s written in epically spidery handwriting. Every time you get to the end, you realize you&#39;ve forgotten everything that was on it and you have to read it again.<br>MY OWN GROCERY LIST: The writing tends to wander on and off the lines, and it uses a disproportional number of adverbs. It gets as far as &quot;superbly creamy milk... painfully sweet sugar... flawlessly smooth eggs...&quot; and then is left to fester on the kitchen table for all eternity.</p>

            <p><b>H.P. Lovecraft</b><br>The list starts off innocuously enough. However, as you get the ingredients, you start to notice something is horribly wrong with the list, as the ingredients are all weird items that seem to point at something sinister that is lurking beneath the surface. Eventually, you get to the end of the grocery list, and are confronted with a horror that then ends up becoming some variation on &quot;indescribable&quot;.<br><br><b>William Shakespeare</b><br>The list uses language so archaic you need to reference a different page just to know what the hell the first page is referring to.</p>

            <p><b>Robert Jordan:</b><br>The list has three pages, with pretty standard ingredients for the kind of meal you are shopping for.  Two hours later, when you inexplicably find yourself on the 8th page you are wondering if all these ingredients are really necessary.  There are many sub-lists built around various recipes that seem to have varying levels of relevance to the larger meal.  After spending the afternoon reading, you make it to the 12th page and find that the handwriting is different.  The good news is that the last three pages are full of spices that work really well with the ingredients from the previous pages.  In the end, you will have one massive feast featuring every ingredient on the list, no matter how irrelevant it seemed at the time.  That is...if you can even make it through the list.</p>

            <p>I would add to Rowling that everyone wants to borrow her list.<br><br>And my version of Rick Riordan:<br><br>Nothing is simply what it is - everything on the list has some connection to ancient mythology, and it&#39;s enthralling to see how much of our culture is based on ancient traditions. It&#39;s written from the point of view of a snarky teenager, which makes it so entertaining that you remember the list even after you&#39;re done shopping.<br><br>Suzanne Collins:<br><br>You start the list, and everything&#39;s in perfect sequence, right next to each other in the store so you&#39;re racing through. Through it all, you learn about unethical food practices. Then the list starts to become less clear- though it&#39;s still moving quickly, you find yourself squinting at the items, not sure whether you&#39;re getting the right thing. You might have repeated something. Then the list becomes nigh-incomprehensible, and you feel like giving up on trying to understand. Depending on who you are, you either stick it through or give up. Maybe after you&#39;re done shopping you go try to rewrite the end, so you can use that instead. You feel disappointed, because it was so good at first.<br><br>Stephenie Meyer:<br><br>She feels the need to describe everything in unnecessary detail, and you feel like there are things missing, despite the list being incredibly long. You get the sense that there are some unethical food practices she supports and promotes.<br><br>(whoever wrote Fifty Shades of Grey, can&#39;t remember at the moment):<br><br>She borrowed Stephenie Meyer&#39;s list, but changed some of the names of things and the unethical practices take up even more space, if possible.<br><br>All I&#39;ve got for now.</p>

            <p>Author-minis take on the mini from the continuum they wrote, like <a href="http://lilywinterwood.tumblr.com/post/35034276137/ppc-the-strange-life-of-isabella-holmes">Stephanie</a> from the Twilight continuum or <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/ramblingband.html">Tolkein</a> from the Lord of the Rings continuum. I imagine they&#39;d be a lot more imperious than the average misspelling, especially to other minis, since they created the world the other minis are from and in many cases the species that they resemble, but there&#39;s nothing showing the disposition and other specifics of author-minis that I can find.</p>

            <p>I was in a place without readily available Internet for eight days or so, so I&#39;ve not rewritten it in that time, but I&#39;ve got more down than I had when I last sent you an update. Still not finished, though. All of the endings I could come up with seemed either rushed, sort of corny, or give someone information that they would have no way of knowing in order to work, so I tabled it for a while.<br><br>On the plus side, I watched several episodes of Supernatural while I was gone, and now I understand Ariel&#39;s home canon a bit better. Plus, I am now motivated to find and watch more of the show, because I wandered in during the middle of a season involving the Leviathans with practically no previous experience to build on, and I need some context. I liked what I saw, though, and I would probably be watching the rest of the season right now if my Netflix wasn&#39;t out again.</p>

            <p><b>Joseph Heller</b><br>You may only use the shopping list if you&#39;re hungry.  However, if you <i>can</i> read it, that only shows you&#39;re not too distracted by hunger to concentrate on reading, which means you aren&#39;t hungry at all and you may not use the shopping list.<br><br><b>Herman Melville</b><br>The shopping list is a long description of the history of grocery stores, and how people conducted shopping during the nineteenth century.  The food only shows up at the very end.<br><br><b>Thomas Mann</b><br>The list is so long that you wind up strangling most of the early food items because you can&#39;t bear to hear them talk anymore about how hard life is outside the grocery store.<br><br><b>Stephen King</b><br>Each shopping list contains subtle nods to all the others, until eventually, the readership understands that all the lists are really taking place during a single, massive shopping trip.  The Man in Black flees across the bakery section, and the Gunslinger follows.<br><br><b>J. Robert King</b><br>Leaves so many unfinished shopping instructions on the first list that Wizards of the Coast asks him to write an extra shopping list that explains all the inconsistencies and fills in the missing information.<br><br><b>Anthony Burgess</b><br>Instead of putting groceries in your cart, you smash them on the ground or throw them at other shoppers.  The speaker system only plays classical.<br><br><b>Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins</b><br>For some reason, you&#39;re shopping on an airplane.  Most food items have been crossed off and replaced with phone numbers.  The children all go missing, but no one seems to notice or care.  You start to shop from the Antichrist&#39;s shopping list instead because it has better food.</p>
