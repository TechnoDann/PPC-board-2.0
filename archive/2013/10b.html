            <p>I can understand <i>one</i> trailer that&#39;s just trying to be mysterious and raise excitement for the special, but this makes two in a row that have revealed basically nothing at all, only basics like the title, date, and just now, the addition of a standard &quot;this is a big deal&quot; narration. If you add the Comic-Con trailer, which hasn&#39;t been leaked in full (to my knowledge, at least), but reportedly didn&#39;t contain information above the &quot;There will be Daleks in it&quot; and &quot;that  other-Doctor you saw in The Name of the Doctor is going to be in it too, because why wouldn&#39;t he be&quot; caliber, it makes me think that the Doctor Who production team isn&#39;t just keeping this under wraps for the sake of dramatic mystery.<br>Are they afraid saying anything at all about it is going to be disappointing? Because they&#39;ve been stirring up so much hype for the special, and yet revealing essentially nothing on any front above rumors and Moffat-misdirections, it makes me think that they&#39;re less than confident with the final product, which in turn makes me less confident that they did a good job with it.<br>I hope I&#39;m just jumping to conclusions. I hope it&#39;s awesome. It deserves to be awesome.</p>

            <p>Though I am rather perplexed when faced with the concept of a story being a character. <br><br>Can you provide an example of a story which has been labeled as such? <s>the Speaker of the Vast Croak does not count</s><br><br>Or perhaps the reviewers are bringing up the &quot;mood&quot; and themes that <i>characterize</i> the story as opposed to referring to it as a living, breathing, sentient being?</p>

            <p>-Middle-earth as the &#39;main character&#39; of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> (or at least a major character).<br><br>-&#39;Serenity&#39; as the tenth main character of <i>Firefly</i>.<br><br>There&#39;s two ways this can be applied, really: either the setting is so frequently and lovingly described that it can overshadow the animal characters (Tolkien), or the &#39;setting&#39; is a frequent plot-driver with its own quirks (often this is a spaceship - both Serenity and the Millennium Falcon count, I think).<br><br>Can you have &#39;Sue versions of these? Well, in the latter case, probably yes: if your characters are pretty good, but the spaceship (or whatever) just keeps suffering from &#39;coincidental&#39; breakdowns in just the right place to advance the plot - and then they fix themselves without the characters having to - that&#39;s a Setting-Sue. Usually we&#39;d call one of the characters on it (for manipulating their environment), but if they&#39;re not Mary-Sues in themselves, it might well be better to pin it on the setting.<br><br>The former case is a bit more tricky, because it overlaps so completely with urple prose. That said, I think it could work - a location that gets Suvian levels of description, and possibly is personified to some degree (&#39;Silvermoon will miss you!&#39; &#39;The power/spirit of Silvermoon is with me!&#39;), could well be referred to as a Setting-Sue. Again, this is a new term, so yes, we&#39;ve previously called it other things - but I think it works.<br><br>And for my money, they&#39;d be DOGA&#39;s responsibility. Apart from Alumia, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever had to exorcise a location before - but we&#39;ve certainly assassinated them. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><a href="http://artic-blade.livejournal.com/1065.html">Robecca</a> not only managed to possess the landmass itself, but also possessed hundreds of sapient plants and animals that were nearby as she did so. I&#39;m still not sure how the Agents dealt with it, even after reading the story. Apparently Kingdom Hearts magic could split the possessed portions off into mini-Sues, which then merged with the original Robecca after she was removed and charged, allowing her to be permanently killed. I don&#39;t know enough about the Kingdom Hearts continuum to determine whether that makes any sense.</p>

            <p>There was a case where <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1-s7LIQsH6vWklzYLPriCMYS5CWQDIsUdtRXJ5qHdgCM">Arda itself</a> had to be exorcised.

            <p>No, you wouldn&#39;t have created them. It would be the <i>Suethors</i> who created them, through purple prose and poor establishment gone wild. You don&#39;t need to have any sort of breakdown for bringing it to our attention. Unless you have, in which case this message has come woefully too late.<br><br>The Pyros should be able to deal with the Sue-settings as they are now, I think. They just might need some big guns to wipe them out completely. I&#39;d recommend bringing in something from the Spore continuum. The high-level Space Stage races there sell weapons that can turn an area the size of a city to a crater in seconds. They&#39;re also good for freezing or exploding an entire planet, in case that ever needs to be done.<br><br>Actually, in most of the PPC stories I&#39;ve seen where a setting is altered beyond recognition, the setting returns to its usual state as part of the snapback to canon after the altered location is destroyed and/or the badfic entity responsible for the changes is killed. There have been one or two times when a few buildings or an entire planet had to be pulled out of a plot hole, but I don&#39;t remember the specifics.<br>I suppose that it would just be too difficult to remove an entire island or city from a plot hole and place it back in the crater made by the badfic locale before the snapback hits, not to mention all of the problems of displacing the material that filled in the spot after the altered island or city was destroyed, particularly if that material was water or some other liquid. At least whole planets don&#39;t need to be attached to much. They need to be put in the right spot to resume their orbit, but that shouldn&#39;t be too difficult in comparison.</p>

            <p>Sadly, I don&#39;t think the mission is accessible at the moment, but I can tell you about it. The trollfic in question was in first person, so Agent July tossed a crash dummy into the fic, and it took on the form of the troll, which was masquerading as Drew Pickles from <i>Rugrats</i>. July watched it do terrible things to a McDonald&#39;s kitchen, then dropped a book of matches into one of the fryers, charged the troll with trolling, and burned it.<br><br>So, the procedure there is basically the same as a standard assassination, except that the target is a troll instead of a Sue. Dunno how much that squares with the original idea, but there it is.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You know, most departments also have nicknames for agents, like &quot;Unentanglers&quot; or &quot;Assassins&quot;.<br>The DAVD also doesn&#39;t have one.<br><br>If it doesn&#39;t matter to the rest of you, I propose &quot;Sadies&quot;- short for &#39;Sadists&#39;, and because a good way to survive watching Disturbing Acts of Violence may be to develop a strong sadistic streak.

            <p>Calling DAVD agents “Sadies” would totally put me off.<br><br>The agents are “nicknamed” for what they do: the Assassins assassinate, the Exorcists exorcise and the Unentaglers disentangle, so it isn’t even a nickname, it’s their profession. Only the Pyros of the <i>Department of Geographical Aberations</i> seem to be nicknamed for their preferred method rather than their profession of destroying.  <br><br>So what do you think DAVD(a) agents do or which methods do they use?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>We know a lot of people in HQ who don&#39;t actually work in the department find DAVD agents kinda creepy, and in such a massive place with so many beings bumping shoulders every day, with the kinds of stress levels agents build up, you&#39;re going to have people who don&#39;t like each other, so I could imagine sometimes people from different departments make up derogatory nicknames.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m again sorry for the whole &quot;sadism&quot; fiasco, but I&#39;ve decided to just own up to it before I have to go for a few weeks (thanks to impending technical problems) instead of run away like a coward right now.<br><br>Anyway, with THAT cleared up...<br><br>The Disturbing Acts of Violence Department would I guess be <i>Medics</i> (after the class from TF2).<br><br>They&#39;re there when a Suethor or badficcer has done actual <i>physical</i> harm, possibly in lethal quantities, to a canon and its characters, far beyond what the rest of the PPC, even with FicPsych and Medical, can fix, and THEY can set things right in those scenarios- expecially when the canon doesn&#39;t snap back of its own accord like it does in Cupcakes/Snapback (which, in my opinion, should&#39;ve been handled by the DAVD.)<br><br>That miraculous quality is from its medical team, DAVD(m). From one source, DAVD(m) can reglue on a decapitated head and the character comes back to life. Try getting Medical to repeat THAT feat and see what you get.<br><br>On top of that, a DAVD(i) or DAVD(a) agent has to witness a LOT more violence in one fic than many Spies, Assassins, Exorcists, Unentanglers, ect. have to deal with in thier careers, and DAVD(a) usually would have to deal with Mary Sues, Sue-Wraiths, Replacements, ect. that can fight back, as opposed to an Assassin&#39;s Mary Sues and Replacements, or an Exorcist&#39;s Sue-wraiths, which usually don&#39;t.<br><br>Hence, a name based off of the name of a class in a violent first-person-shooter video game.<br><br>With that being said, I suggest the divisions take on medical-sounding names to fit with that theme.<br><br>For instance:<br>&gt;DAVD(a) could be &quot;Battle medics&quot; (after the nickname used in TF2 for Medics that fight the enemy directly instead of healing teammates), since they actually confront the Sue or whatever directly as well as get the bodies/wounded to DAVD(m))<br>&gt;DAVD(i) could be &quot;diagnosers&quot; (or &quot;diaggers&quot; for short, this one should be obvious)<br>&gt;and DAVD(m) could be &quot;Doctors&quot;, which relates both to the fact that they&#39;re aparrently a lot better than the Nurses from Medical and to the &quot;mad-scientist-crazy&quot; cures they perform (I mean, gluing a decapitated head on? Really?)<br><br>Hopefully these suggestions are a lot better than the insensitive &quot;sadies&quot; thing...</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think this is stated anywhere, but I figure Fizz R the Bizarre&#39;s practice is so highly specialized he&#39;s not good for anything else. You wouldn&#39;t go see him for a simple broken bone, and it&#39;s probably been so long since he last saw a case of the flu he&#39;d be just as likely to kill you as cure you. On the other hand, if you need to reattach severed limbs, repair mangled organs, or remind a canon character that no, they&#39;re <i>not</i> dead, and certainly not <i>un</i>dead, we promise—then he&#39;s your guy. Sure, the Medical Department&#39;s got an Igor, but Fizz is a lot more personable in that he is an actual human person.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the meta explanation that the PPC was far less cohesive back in the day, and people pretty much did their own thing without worrying too much about what was happening in other spin-offs as long as they didn&#39;t outright contradict the Original Series. Plus, originally, it was unusual for the Medical Department to treat canon characters, whereas canons were DAVD(m)&#39;s main clientele. But I like my theory.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Just slow down and take some time to tread water before you try to dive deeper. You&#39;re currently suffering from what I call Newbie Keenness, which is basically just a lot of enthusiasm untempered by experience. Enthusiasm is good, you don&#39;t want to lose that, but you want to use it to go out there, read what&#39;s already been written, and learn how things work before you try to do it yourself. Otherwise, you&#39;ll just keep running up against stuff you don&#39;t know yet, and it&#39;ll stop being fun pretty quickly.<br><br>So, let this lie for now, go read the original DAVD stories, the Original Series, and some other spin-offs, and relax. You&#39;re not going to be writing missions this week, or next week, or probably even the week after that. You&#39;ve got time. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I like enthusiastic people that are coming up with ideas! Coming up with ideas is part of the fun of writing, and I think you&#39;re taking a step in the right direction.

            <p>I think, if you read the original DAVD stories by Katharine, you may note a lack of sadism and, rather, the presence of <i>compassion</i> for the characters being forced to suffer though such horrible things at the whim of some author. In fact, I&#39;d go so far as to say the DAVD is anti-sadism. There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s called the <i>Disturbing</i> Acts of Violence Department. Nobody is there because they enjoy watching their favorite characters suffer, and *puts on Permission-Giver hat* that&#39;s not something I would ever want to see in a PPC agent in <i>any</i> department. */hat*<br><br>Also, what makes you think it&#39;s unrealistic for someone to be in the DAVD for a reason other than enjoying other people&#39;s pain?

            <p>At this point, there have basically been two people who write with DAVD - the original creator (who Miss Cam&#39;s site tells me was &#39;Katherine the Great&#39;), and me (because I used them extensively in <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/ReorgTitle.htm">The Reorganisation</a>, <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/CrashTitle.htm">Crashing Down</a>, and a <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/DAVD2009.htm">handful</a> of stories since - actually, maybe only one, but I have another half-written). Oh, beg pardon, there&#39;s also one mission featuring <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/buffyverse/highway.htm">Ginmar</a>, who I don&#39;t know who was written by.<br><br>And... well, Katherine and Ginmar wrote before &#39;everyone has flash patches&#39; was a thing, and I&#39;ve never found a reason to create one. We don&#39;t really have a system for making new patches for departments which lack them, so I&#39;m going to suggest the honour goes to the first person to write a mission and want to make a patch. If you get that far, that could be you.<br><br>That said, DAVD is an... interesting department. They have their own Intelligence and Medical divisions (I know Fizz R the Bizarre showed up in a recent mission, I think Neshomeh&#39;s), and are basically their own little world. They have a nice cast of Flowers, although their human staff are mostly unnamed (Ginmar might still be around, and Rile X is still alive - though the rest of the DAVD(i) lot are dead or retired, as are almost all named DAVD(a) characters). So it could be a challenging department to work with.<br><br>That also means it could be very rewarding. What sort of direction are you thinking of taking them? Are you planning a set of DAVD(i) characters to back up the action team - or, indeed, are you thinking of following Dour K&#39;s footsteps and writing an Intel agent?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m actually planning on creating at least one DAVD(a) agent (which is pretty much needed since, as you said, they&#39;re out of named agents), a Pikachu named Shocker from the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series (which means sentient and able to talk), but I actually hadn&#39;t thought of DAVD(i). The reason I&#39;d need a flashpatch is because Agent Shocker would have a very minimal uniform consisting of a black shirt with the division flashpatch and a hat with the department flashpatch.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t planning on any DAVD(i) agents...<br><br>If the honor&#39;s going to me (which by the way I don&#39;t have permission yet- I actually just joined- so someone could, at any rate, beat me to that), I think the department flashpatch would be a drop of blood, and the division ones would be:<br>DAVD(a): Drop of blood, with a dagger overlaid on top<br>DAVD(i): Drop of blood under a magnifying glass<br>DAVD(m): Drop of blood, with a red cross overlaid on top<br><br>The blood thing is &#39;cause another term for violence is &quot;bloodshed&quot;.</p>

            <p>At least, so says the guy with two DAVD(A) agents who&#39;s working on a mission for them among many, many other projects.

            <p>Back in the day, flashpatches made no sense. DMS had a potted cactus, DBS had a rubber ducky, Personnel had a flaming stickman, Bad Roleplay had a swift (or something).

Then...<br><br>... well, from what I recall, then I showed up, and gave the Pyro Department a flame insignia.

            <p>...(and hoping this hasn&#39;t been brought up already):<br><br>The trailers are showing the non-palace-y quality of Mirkwood, as well as its giant spiders.

Legolas&#39; &#39;Do not think I will not kill you, dwarf&#39; line, coupled with the sneering facial expression...kind of hurts (in a good way), because a) yay irony! and b) ouch. You haven&#39;t changed your tune yet and aaaah you&#39;re actually younger here and I know what you&#39;ll become, but...yeah. Anyway, I think the line was done well. And Thranduil&#39;s design is very good, I think, although perhaps not exactly like the books? Pretty cool-looking, though. And the way they&#39;ve done Smaug&#39;s voice is great, although I&#39;m not so sure about the dragon&#39;s design yet...I guess we&#39;ll find out! <s>and get Dragon-Slayer!Sues into the bargain who make him look easy to defeat argh. Oh well, we can always take them to meet Glaurung! :D</s>)<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s my two cents. And even with the promised fangirl/fanfic explosion, I think it&#39;ll be good to see Legolas again--and to meet Tauriel. (Also, maybe we&#39;ll get a bit of a character arc for Legolas?

            <p>You seem to forget that causing Fanfic Explosions is what Peter Jackson does best- right after enraging die-hard Tolkien fans.<br><br>But yes- the combination of pre-movie hype and cute looking guys will be too much for the fangirls, and the adrenaline pumping action will be too much for the fanboys.

            <p>I think so. <br>Especially since they used so much advertising to promote Thranduil, Bard, Tauriel, and Legolas. (I think that most of the fanfic will be written about Legolas, though.)</p>

            <p>I figure that pretty much everyone with a rudimentary knowledge of the Hobbit canon will be pulled in to help out. Generally it&#39;ll be the Action Departments, though, not Infrastructure, which is what DoDAEG is classed as.<br><br>Besides, DoDAEG works whethere there&#39;s badfic near it or not - they&#39;re hooked up directly to authors turning in their graves. I&#39;m fairly sure Tolkien is generally in overdrive as it is these days, with the residual issues from the LotR films plus the relatively recent <i>An Unexpected Journey</i> release.

            <p>Ah f**k it, let&#39;s get this over and done with...<br><br>--Agent Apollo--<br><br>-Real Name: James Pierson<br>-Age: 28<br>-Gender: Male<br>-Race: Powered Human<br>-Home: Winchester, Hampshire, England/ Ryde City, Isle of Wight, England<br>-Appearance:  James stands at six foot exactly. His short black hair extends into two short sideburns coming down to just below his earlobes. He has light blue eyes. His overall build is similar to that of an athlete, years of exercise, doing both running and archery means that he is quite fit. <br>-Personality: Overall James is quite warm and welcoming. He can (and quite often does) shut down his emotions whilst performing a specific task. Tactically minded he was initially looked upon to be the Leader of the second group of Guardians, although he didn’t like the role and was happy when Atlas (another character, not the Titan) stepped in to take up the role.<br>History: Coming from a scrapped original story James Pierson was one of what was called the first Generation, the first powered humans to evolve on an unkind and xenophobic Earth. Luckily for James his power was not as obvious as others and so he was able to live in a relatively loving family until he moved to Ryde City for university, or at least that was his ruse. For James was also known as Apollo, his power being perfect vision, able to see in darkest night or through a smokescreen with next to no trouble. As Apollo James utilized a bow and a baseball bat, a simple yet effective weapon that was easy to use and maintain. James was a part of a larger team of superheroes known as the Guardians who tried to not only help the world but also bring in peace and equality for all Powered. James was able to escape having been left ‘on a solo mission’ when the story was scrapped. The plothole deposited him in the HQ. <br>-Preferred Weapons: Bow (and thereby arrows) and baseball bat.<br>-Department: DMS, Freelancer Division<br>-Main Fandoms: Harry Potter, Pokemon, Starcraft, LOTR, Percy Jackson, Warhammer 40K, Narnia, Redwall. <br><br>Writing Piece: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14NdXmaWzxlEHCO_U56yDbK9OK6eJQz-p16hzYODi1do/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14NdXmaWzxlEHCO_U56yDbK9OK6eJQz-p16hzYODi1do/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/14NdXmaWzxlEHCO_U56yDbK9OK6eJQz-p16hzYODi1do/edit</a></a><br><br>Hit me with your worst.

            <p>I am sorry to say that, for now, I think the answer has to be no.  There are a few reasons for this.<br><br>1) Preparedness - You only have one character, and there is no indication that you have another agent in mind or another PPCer to write with at the moment.  Your original link didn&#39;t work.  You also forgot the badfic link.  All of those are small, by themselves, but together they point to a lack of preparation.<br><br>2) Writing sample - There are a couple of problems that I would like to point out.  The first being word choice.  You have a tendency to use the same words over and over again.  &#39;Whilst&#39; and &#39;hidden&#39; are the two that stand out in my mind.  Why is nothing ever obscured or out of sight?  Always hidden.  It leads one to consider what they might be hiding.<br><br>Another problem is the pacing.  The story is, at once, moving too fast and too slowly.  I attribute this to what is sometimes known as the &quot;info dump&quot;.  I understand the need to get information out to the audience.  However, you need to balance that against the need to keep the audience engaged.  I found it difficult to read on through the background information to get to the too-fast plot.<br><br>On a more structural note, you need to work on your punctuation.  There are a lot of commas missing from that story.<br><br>3) The badfic - It isn&#39;t really that bad.  The spelling, punctuation, and grammar are pretty good.  The story is not a new idea, but it does have some twists that could make it interesting.  The characters are, more or less, in character.  It does suffer from terrible pacing and awkward dialogue, but really it&#39;s just boring.  I didn&#39;t see anything in the first two chapters that struck me as being mission-worthy.<br><br>Part of writing for the PPC is knowing what makes a fic bad.  To quote the FAQ: For Other People, &quot;The stories we make fun of are not the stories that are mostly canonical, but have one or two flaws, or the stories that perhaps might be disrespectful towards the original work. We deal with the most awful, Sueish, worst-written, canon-warping fanfiction there is.&quot;  Unless there is something that I haven&#39;t seen yet (and let me know if there is), then I have to call this one mediocre at worst.<br><br><br>So, all of that tells me that you are not yet ready to write in the PPC.  The key word there being &quot;yet&quot;.  Work on your writing.  Come up with a partner for your agent or find another PPCer to write with.  Find a fic that is worse than mediocre.  When you&#39;ve done all of that, come back and try it again.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t able to get a really good read on his personality in the story, due to some of the things we&#39;ve already talked about. I think he has potential, and he might play well with a partner who is less serious.  His power is useful, but not broken.  He has a strategy that utilizes his strengths and he seems to think things through.  All of that is good.  I would like to see him in a scene that isn&#39;t so background heavy, though, (maybe one of PoorCynic&#39;s workshop prompts) just to get a better idea of what he is like.<br><br>One thing I wonder about (not because it is at all important, but because this is the kind of thing I think about) is his use of a baseball bat.  There is nothing wrong with a bat as a weapon, of course.  As you said, it is effective and easy to maintain.  However, it doesn&#39;t seem to work with his style, at least in my mind.  His style seems to rely on stealth.  The bow works well with that idea.  On the other hand, a baseball bat is about as subtle as a...well, a baseball bat.  It is hard to hide and kind of awkward to carry around.<br><br>In my mind, it makes more sense for him to have something that can be used in a stealthy manner, but also be used if stealth fails.  So, what options are there?  If you want to stay with blunt weapons then you could go with a billy-club/nightstick/baton, especially a telescoping version.  For bladed weapons, you are probably down to daggers and knives.  There is, of course, a third option: no weapons.  Maybe he knows jujutsu, which uses no weapon, or just a short weapon,to take down armed and armored opponents.<br><br>Anyway, that was a lot of words to devote to something that is pretty unimportant, in the grand scheme of things.  Let me know if you have any other questions, or if I can make something clearer.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Thanks, won&#39;t say I&#39;m happy about that, but I think I can understand you&#39;re reasoning.<br><br>1) There is another Agent down the line (my Time Lord alter-ego) however I want to know more about the Whoverse before I write it, rather than cocking things up left right and centre now. The only time I&#39;ve used google docs in the past are for RPing Pokemon battles so I&#39;ve never had to share it and the link with others, it&#39;s more of me simply not knowing how to do it than anything else. And I&#39;ll admit, forgetting the badfic link is kinda bad.<br><br>2) Thanks, I suppose it&#39;s one of my writing tics, I&#39;ll try to improve it in the future.<br><br>I suppose I&#39;m trying to explain a whole world and the story in a chapter, I&#39;ll take it on board.<br><br>Noted, I understand that.<br><br>3) I was kinda thinking that if I can do a more mundane mission to start off then I can work on worse missions as I get more experienced. If the story isn&#39;t that bad should it be removed from the list of badfic then? <br><br>Thanks once again<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>It is good to see you taking my comments to heart and looking at how you can improve your writing.<br><br><br>1) Getting a handle on the canon before writing that character is a great idea.  GDocs are useful, so learning a little more about how to use them is a good plan.  And forgetting the badfic link is not a huge problem, by itself.<br><br>2) I know a thing or two about writing tics.  I have a few of them, myself.  You just have to be aware of them, and work to overcome them if they are getting in the way.<br><br>Like I said, it&#39;s a balancing act.  I would recommend looking through the information in the first half of the story and finding the minimum that you need to make the story make sense.  The rest can be sprinkled in as you need it.  A good example of what could be cut is this bit: <br><br><b>&quot;Why they were called the Guardians was not widely known besides that they were guarding something. From their actions speculations and rumours hinted that said thing could be anything from Ryde City, to Britain to the other Powered to King Arthur himself, although that last one and others like it were often scoffed at and dismissed.&quot;</b><br><br>It doesn&#39;t really add anything to the story at that point, it is never referenced again, and it could easily be added in to some dialogue later.  Something like this, perhaps:<br><br><b>&quot;So, I get that we&#39;re supposed to be the Guardians and all but...what are we guarding, exactly?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I heard it&#39;s, like, King Arthur or something.&quot;</b><br><br>That takes less space, and we get the information from the characters rather than the narrator, which shows that people in-universe are wondering about it.<br><br>As to the comma issue, a good beta is your best friend.<br><br>3) I wasn&#39;t aware that it was on the list of unclaimed badfic.  I definitely think it doesn&#39;t belong there.  While it isn&#39;t great, I didn&#39;t see anything that says it is really bad.<br><br>I think you have the right idea, here.  Starting small and working your way up is a good plan.  Keep looking and find a story that you think you can make into a funny mission.<br><br><br>You are, understandably, not happy about the result, but you are reacting in a constructive manner to the comments that I gave you.  That is a very good thing.  If you keep this attitude, and work on the things we&#39;ve talked about, then I am sure you will get permission in the future.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>1) Yeah, the only other Agent I can think of creating at the moment is a version of real world me, but I&#39;m not sure I want to do that. I think I&#39;ll spend an hour or so playing around with GDocs just to get a feel for things. <br>2) I could mention their naming again it&#39;d just need a lot more writing or a timeskip to sensibly do so really. The conversation you suggested would only work between two of the initiates really, in what I suppose would be there &#39;downtime&#39; in the Guardian HQ. The original name came from protecting Ryde City and then other Powered, the King Arthur name drop is something I&#39;m working on in the current incarnation of the story, to the point where most of the surnames for the characters have some link to the knights (Gawainson, Tristan, De Bors for Thorne, Nova and Clone for example). It doesn&#39;t really need to be there I suppose, but as I&#39;ve been writing the sample I&#39;ve been changing between one incarnation and another and so ideas plots etc. have become kinda mixed up, but also because I have such a short space (comparatively) to put it all in I&#39;ve added new plots and stuff just for the story (for example Spammer running off when she did, hell Spammer only really appears in the latest incarnation). I think I&#39;m babbling so I&#39;ll shut up and move on.<br>3)OK, although having looked further into it, there are a couple of really annoying points in it (OC learning shield charm by end of first year for instance) but I get that it&#39;s not really bad enough.<br><br><br>Thanks for the comments<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>As some of you might have noticed, ff.net has recently implemented a feature that prevents copy-pasting text from their stories. As this kinda makes life hard for us, I asked EllipsisFlood for her help, and she came with this nifty piece of code:<br>javascript:%20(function()%20{$(&#39;.nocopy&#39;).removeClass(&#39;nocopy&#39;).parent().css({&#39;-moz-user-select&#39;:&#39;auto&#39;,&#39;-webkit-user-select&#39;:&#39;auto&#39;,&#39;user-select&#39;:&#39;auto&#39;})})()<br>What you need to do to make it work is to bookmark the code (highlighting it and dragging it to the bookmarks menu worked for me), then click on the bookmark, and voilа, you can copy from ff.net again!</p>

            <p>The Circle uses a different method althogether, so EllipsisFlood&#39;s script unfortunately doesn&#39;t work for it.<br><br>There&#39;s a way around it if you are using Firefox, however. It&#39;s a plug-in called RightToClick. Once activated, it manages to bypass any kind of copy or right-click block.<br><br>Oddly enough, regular copypaste still doesn&#39;t work for the circle, but click-and-drag near the first letter of the paragraph after activating the plug-in will result into taking the entire paragraph, thus enabling the possibility of dropping it into your document.<br><br>It was probably done as another layer of protection, since text is treated as several single elements instead of... well, text and so it can&#39;t be highlighted.

It&#39;s been several months since I rejoined, but now I&#39;m finally getting around to posting some of the stuff I&#39;ve written since then!<br><br>And on that count, I have two interludes to get things back in swing for my two RCs.<br><br>First up, we have Eusabius going on that date with Zerenze, while Florestan greets a new member of RC 1810: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQA_Cdm9Ikso1i1Kk4f0WY7RmUC972UJKEN30rnJxFQ/pub"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQA_Cdm9Ikso1i1Kk4f0WY7RmUC972UJKEN30rnJxFQ/pub">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bQA_Cdm9Ikso1i1Kk4f0WY7RmUC972UJKEN30rnJxFQ/pub</a></a><br><br>And then we jump over to RC 2183 as they deal with being transferred to the Department of Mary Sues: The Hunger Games Division, as well as other things in life: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_3bf5la5gXOugLP2RgyutgSCrwPYqjvTdw0pT8HwRU/pub"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_3bf5la5gXOugLP2RgyutgSCrwPYqjvTdw0pT8HwRU/pub">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_3bf5la5gXOugLP2RgyutgSCrwPYqjvTdw0pT8HwRU/pub</a></a><br><br>So yeah, there we go. I&#39;d like to thank Outhra and Neshomeh for beta&#39;ing each interlude, and also to thank Neshomeh for cowriting a scene in the RC 2183 interlude.<br><br>And hopefully, I&#39;ll be able to get some missions in soon. I hope you guys enjoy!</p>

            <p>Hieronymus Graubart already pointed out a lot of the mechanical stuff I noticed in the RC 1810 interlude, so I&#39;ll just add a reminder to watch out for redundancies and overuse of adverbs and other modifiers in your writing. Hopefully you know the kinds of things I&#39;m talking about by now, so I won&#39;t get into it. {= )<br><br>In response to the piece itself, I have to say my overall impression is that of awkwardness. This is not a bad thing! I like that you take the time to deal with how out of place Zerenze feels in the whole situation: alien body, alien world, alien language, alien courtship... I&#39;d complain if it <i>wasn&#39;t</i> awkward for him. Also, I can totally relate to having no idea what the hell you&#39;re doing, but wanting to see it through anyway just in case it turns out to be awesome (which, as my shiny wedding ring attests, it did!).<br><br>I would like to know even more of his thoughts and feelings in all this, though. Seeing as it is so bizarre, not just for him personally but for Sangheili as a race, what is it about Eusabius that makes him worth it for Zerenze to stick his neck out so far, and what is it about Zerenze that allows him to? Are Sangheili capable of physical intimacy in the way we understand it, but just generally choose not to engage in it? Is Zerenze somehow different from other members of his species if he&#39;s capable of this kind of relationship? If so, why? How? I know I&#39;m speaking from deep ignorance since I&#39;m not familiar with the canon, Zerenze&#39;s origins, or how this relationship got started, but it&#39;s an important set of questions. I don&#39;t want to declare this is happening just because the plot says so, since I haven&#39;t done my homework, but when you point out that it&#39;s not typical and proceed to do it anyway, one must wonder.<br><br>I&#39;d also like to know more about the Sangheili side of things, just out of regular curiosity. If they&#39;re not big on physical intimacy, how <i>do</i> they go about having relations? Maybe this could be grounds for another interlude, where Zerenze gets to take Eusabius out on an Elite-style date. Turnabout is fair play, right? {= D<br><br>A question: does Maria la O routinely let gay couples meet at her place, like a clandestine service she provides, or is it just because she&#39;s friends with Eusabius? Maybe I missed the explanation of this in the Spanish... I&#39;m afraid mine&#39;s not great, though some of it did come back to me trying to read the Spanish dialogue here. I guess it just felt a little odd to me personally, especially since she hung around for a while to play records and hand out cigars. If I were trying to have a safe, private tryst with a new lover, I&#39;d be really weirded out by even a really good friend hanging around watching us have cute bonding moments on her balcony. Like, thanks, really appreciate the safe space, but go away now? O.o;<br><br>A point that could be clarified: I think I recall you saying somewhere (maybe the mission I looked at?) that Zerenze and Eusabius don&#39;t actually have any kind of intercourse at this time, but between the way Eusabius talks up his big plans and the fact that we jump to them mostly naked in bed together, it&#39;s not at all clear. You miiight wanna do something about that, because based on their date, I do think that would be moving way too fast for poor Z. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>Oh,</sup></sup> I enjoyed getting some of Eusabius&#39; backstory in this. It&#39;s not a lot of information, but it&#39;s just enough to imagine the broad strokes of what his life was like for a while, and I admire his coping skills. He seems like the kind of person who always manages to land on his feet and seems to sail along like nothing can touch him, even if you know he has to be tied up in knots on the inside. He&#39;s a pretty cool guy.<br><br>---<br><br>For the other one, I can&#39;t believe I missed this, but it appears that Annie is wearing nothing but a bathrobe during the whole visit. <sup>_<sup>;</sup></sup> I mean, theoretically we can assume she changes in the scene break between when she invites Xanthus to stay and the post-dinner bit, but it strikes me that she might want to do that <i>before</i> she starts making dinner.<br><br>Otherwise, I think the whole &quot;Relocation&quot; interlude works really well, even if they don&#39;t actually relocate physically. There&#39;s nice symmetry with the agents furiously packing and then furiously-in-a-totally-different-sense unpacking (darn Flowers!), and the two parts tie into each other well, what with Cindy and Anneli talking about Ilraen getting Xanthus thinking about visiting Annie. It&#39;s a solid little piece, and I&#39;m happy to have been a part of it. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I only had time to skim the story so I can&#39;t provide an in-depth answer to every question (I am, in fact, reading through <i>A Cage Of Butterflies</i> right now!), but regarding Elites and physical intimacy:<br><br>Sangheili culture is extremely conservative, but that in and of itself indicates that the Elites have something to be conservative <i>about</i>- I know for a fact that Elites do... &quot;couple&quot; to produce offspring, and that there are males and females different enough for humans to differentiate them on sight*. They do have institutions of marriage, although some Elites are described as having multiple wives and others as monogamous (I think this varies depending on regional subculture). However, certain &quot;swordsman&quot;** Elites with significant martial prowess are allowed to spread their genes... basically <i>wherever</i>: whether that means they are simply exempt from monogamy or exempt from <i>consent</i> is something I don&#39;t want to think about.<br><br>More to the point, there is little to no information on canon Sangheili attitudes towards homosexuality, or even if such a thing exists in their neurology. Furthermore, the actual... &quot;mechanics&quot; of producing more Elites are anybody&#39;s guess. What is known is that while they do in fact have a nudity taboo, males don&#39;t appear to possess external genitalia.<br><br><br>*Sangheili appear to have a patriarchal culture, but the sheer size of their all-male military makes me think that the biological ratio of male to female Elites is highly skewed as well.<br><br>**There are mentions of &quot;swordswomen&quot; and female Weapon Masters existing in Sangheili history, but that the positions are males-only now. This, interestingly, implies that the creation of &quot;gender roles&quot; in Elite culture is a relatively new development, perhaps originating from the Covenant?</p>

            <p>I mean, damn...<br><br>A lot of the things about Zerenze&#39;s thoughts and feelings are things that are explained in Halo canon. A lot of it is stuff that I could&#39;ve explained, but talking about everything I found out through wiki-surfing in all likelihood would&#39;ve <i>crippled</i> the pacing of the interlude. (The Halo Wiki is friggin&#39; <i>extensive</i> on this subject, and there&#39;s no way I&#39;d be able to include everything there.) Long story short, the sense I got from wikisurfing was that sangheili look at intimacy the same way a scientist might look at genetics (and yes, I <i>do</i> mean to use that comparison exactly): there are those that do get married and there was a short in <i>Halo: Legends</i> that does confirm that they&#39;re capable of intimacy in the sense that humans would understand, but there&#39;s quite a bit of stuff in there that implies that their societal structure and their culture demands that the institution of marriage--and their capacity for intimacy--be a touch more fluid than in most human cultures.<br><br>But your turnabout idea... Hm... The plotbunnies are already attacking. I&#39;ll have to follow up on that at some point.<br><br>As for the progression of the relationship... honestly, I&#39;m aware that this isn&#39;t a great thing, but I did go into that with the idea that their relationship was building over all the previous times they saw each other. I think the most extensive it got was in the previous interlude, but they talk to each other at other points too (Zerenze even tagged along for Mission 6 of this RC, mostly &#39;cause DoSAT ended up needing some tech from the Cameron!<i>Avatar</i> continuum.). But yeah, they&#39;ve had plenty of interaction by this point, so... yeah.<br><br>Maria la O... Actually, the deal with her was that her existence, and in some ways her function in the interlude, was kind of an in-joke. The problem is that it&#39;s an in-joke that <i>nobody</i> outside of my ethnicity would really get. I actually did almost explain it when Eusabius and Zerenze leave the apartment, but I ended up leaving it out in the name of narrative pacing.<br><br>The gist is this: Maria la O was the name of a tragic prostitute character from a zarzuela Lecuona wrote by the name of... well... <i>Maria la O</i>. In fact, she&#39;s also the name of one of Lecuona&#39;s more well-known tunes-- you can actually find it here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yqGgIF6K70"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yqGgIF6K70">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yqGgIF6K70</a></a>. The idea was that, since she was originally a prostitute, Eusabius would&#39;ve been more comfortable confiding in her, especially since she turned out to be a pretty good friend to him in the end. There is actually a hint of this in the Spanish, too: Maria generally uses a pet name whenever she talks to Eusabius (&quot;ganso lindo&quot; is &quot;handsome goose&quot;), and she also uses the informal form of &quot;you&quot; whenever she addresses him. But yeah, the idea was that Eusabius knew she probably wouldn&#39;t mind, and I&#39;m sure you know by now that there is very little that can faze Eusabius. But... um... yeah, I&#39;ll admit I didn&#39;t really think about it from Zerenze&#39;s point of view.<br><br>The mention of no sexual relations might&#39;ve been from my currently in-revision-phase mission, so... I dunno. The plan was originally to get it to that point, but I ended up scrapping it &#39;cause I figured &quot;no, Eusabius is the kind of guy who would take it slower than that&quot;. I probably should&#39;ve changed the dialogue a touch to reflect that, so that&#39;s an oversight on my part.<br><br>Yeah, Eusabius just floats over everything. You know how it is.<br><br>Thanks for all the feedback on that!</p>

            <p>The tender moments were wonderfully done, and the emotions were all so very real. It was touching and sweet, both of them, but it kept the humour that is so very PPC. Watching <br>Zerenze trying to figure out 1940&#39;s Havana and interacting with Eusabius is utterly adorable, and I definitely ship them. The Ilraen-Cindy conversation was also very sweet, as well as Xanthus going to check on Annie.

            <p>That was an interesting little story.  I like how you start it out with Killroy seeming to be just as horrified as the reader, but then showing more and more that Killroy himself is no stranger to murder and dead bodies, forcing the reader to grow away from him as the comic unfolds.  Adding the wife character later and showing her lack of surprise adds to the unsettling feeling I got looking at these characters&#39; lives from outside.<br><br>I also like how the story is both in prose and traditional comic form.  It gives it a bit of a storybook feel, which contrasts sharply with the subject matter.</p>

            <p>As the title states in any given RP setting Mary/Gary Sues are going to techincly be canon. I speak from experince as I have been a roleplayer online for over a decade and started out on AOL with Red Dragon Inn a PPC style multiverse set in a dungeons and dragons style world. The biggest sue races at the time were Sayjins (This was the late 90s and DBZ was still cool) and Vampires. MMO canon also seems to fall under the same vein I saw some canon-sueness in Star Trek Online most notably in the Story-Mode for the fedration and the Romulans mostly in the sense of &quot;Your the only captian in starfleet who can save the federation..despite having no command training  and starting out as an Ensign who only got command of your ship because you were lucky enough to be a one man away team when the enitre senior staff of your ship was killed by the Borg. At least the Romulans and Klingon Empire did it a bit better Romulans you are an officer who is at least in charge of a colony secuirty team and KDF your a badass who passed the needed rituals to command. <br><br><br><br>  That being said, Roleplaying can be a bit of a grey area so don&#39;t really rely on &quot;Being a mary sue&quot; as your main charge. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>I do like that game. However, I can see what you mean about the early Federation storyline (although it still isn&#39;t as bad as Into Darkness!Kirk, who is a SERIOUS &#39;Stu).<br><br>Then there&#39;s the endgame. Most people play Tactical, because they like insane amounts of DPS (damage per second) in space. Many players don&#39;t like the ground; this is because very few players play Science class. Science is not designed for DPS, or is considered &#39;the healer&#39;, so most players are not interested. I use the healing kit, but I don&#39;t consider my Science characters healers. Rather, they are excellent tanks, and they make quite a difference in ground missions when there are a lot of fragile classes (Tactical) on the team.<br><br>Science tanks often get called invincible on the ground. This is not entirely true, but they can take a serious pounding and can solo some bosses. Does that sound Suvian to you? The drawback is that it takes *ages*; tanks don&#39;t do much DPS. Tactical is the polar opposite: good damage, but fragile. Engineering is probably the most adaptable.<br><br>I suppose, then, that any endgame character could have Suvian tendencies for power level, but being specialised in that particular area at the cost of others is probably a saving grace. It all depends on game balance, I guess: when the developers get it right, nobody&#39;s a &#39;Sue. MMOs are about teamwork and covering each other&#39;s weaknesses, after all.<br><br>(Oh, and I think there is some discussion about changing the first Federation mission on STO to something based at the Academy, so the &#39;Sueness of a level one character stopping the Borg might go away.)</p>

            <p>...is that if you post it on the Board and someone says it&#39;s not badfic, you don&#39;t add it to the wiki. Also, if someone claims it on the Board, they (or a proxy) should add it to the wiki on the Claimed Badfic page. So go ahead.

            <p>...so nonplussed right now you have no idea.<br><br>Recently, thanks in part to PoorCynic&#39;s awesome writing workshop, I&#39;ve been developing a new agent. She may soon make an appearance in a short mission, along with some older agents of mine, although that&#39;s still in the works. However, she likes Shakespeare and Gilbert &amp; Sullivan...so I thought I&#39;d go looking for badfics, since watching agents go crazy is kind of fun. Also, I wanted to see if there was anything out there.<br><br>Of course, the moment I started on the Shakespeare category of the Pit--and believe me, this is the first time I&#39;ve ever felt like using that term--I spotted a fic called <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9695996/1/ShakespearexLoki">&quot;ShakespearexLoki&quot;</a>. It&#39;s rated T, and has the following summary:<br><br><i>What happens when Shakespeare and Loki are in the same room? ;) WARNING: for mature audiences only. May contain beastiality and sad ending may trigger self harm It is by Raveen.</i><br><br>I figured this would be odd, if not badficcy, and, well...I clicked.<br><br>And read.<br><br>And stared.<br><br>Long story short, it&#39;s a very odd trollfic. I don&#39;t think I ever want to understand this kind of troll; my brain would melt and then implode. The trollfic is all of two paragraphs, features Shakespeare the...monkey, I believe, and Loki, who, well...um.<br><br>Here, have a quote.<br><br><i>All of a sudden Loki bellowed, &quot;I AM THE LOKI- full time grim reaper at hell, part time model, Brazilian Master Chef AND leader of the Rolftang Mafia!&quot; I will bring down your kingdom with my dark sinister magic with a mixture of gum disease. If you do not kneel I will kill Shakespeare!&quot; Loki abruptly stopped and glared at Shakespeare who squeaked, &quot;What did I do?&quot;</i><br><br>And another quote:<br><br><i>Shakespeare didn&#39;t kneel because he had swag.</i><br><br>I just. I can&#39;t.<br><br>Basically, Shakespeare&#39;s bride dresses up as Loki and kills Shakespeare. And I wish the plot made as much sense as that, because it really, really doesn&#39;t.<br><br>...any takers?<br><br>*stumbles off in a daze*<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>...but you seem to be claiming quite a lot of badfics without updating the &#39;Claimed Badfic&#39; list. Can this be because you forgot (or haven&#39;t had time) to update it, or simply because you haven&#39;t heard of it?<br><br>Also, I think this will come in useful for you: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide</a></a><br>If you haven&#39;t read it, <i>do</i> read it.

Also, <i>Elves don&#39;t use the names of Eru or the Valar in their own names.</i> According to realelvish.net, doing that is considered to be an attempt to impersonate a god. Oh dear, the charges are just piling up...and all from one sentence! Also, considering that Elves of the Third Age normally give out Sindarin names, and that Fлanor (/muffles giggles) is a Sindarin-ish name in any case, her first name ought to be Eruglнhel, or something along those lines. Which...looks kind of awful, actually, I can see why an English speaker wouldn&#39;t choose that.<br><br>WELL! This just got worse!

            <p>How mean do you want me to be?<br>No, just kidding.<br>*coughs*<br><br>Now, to get serious here...<br>As a fellow &quot;steampunk&quot; (most of the time) writer, I applaud you for your effort to write. However, I did find some errors/points that should be edited.<br>1. The idea in general is very interesting - however, your summary is a little too cheerful for the idea in my opinion. It should reflect the idea, main points, and feel of the piece of writing.<br>2. The first paragraph is a mix of run-on sentences and confusing sentences. For example, in the first paragraph, you wrote &quot;Two men were patrolling on the beat...saw an interestingly bad stream...interestingly white cloud...heard the maker...went into action.&quot; (I didn&#39;t write the whole sentence down, my apologies.) &quot;Interestingly bad stream&quot; does not make sense to the reader. What stream? Why is it bad? <br>Also, the whole sentence is what I dub a &quot;info dump&quot;. Too much information will confuse a reader, and (in worst cases) get them to stop reading altogether.  Since the first sentence is the most important, I would advise you to find a way to make it more cohesive and not give too much information at once. (I would split it into two sentences.)<br>3. Many of your sentences are info dumps. Edit them. I won&#39;t get into much detail here, because I want you to fix them.<br>4. Many of your sentences are also run-on sentences. (Usually, info dumps and run-on sentences go hand in hand.) If you fix your info dump problem, I think the run-on sentences will go away. Remember, periods (.) are your new best friend.<br><br>*Looks at writing done*<br>Geez! I wrote a lot! Sorry for bothering you with this long post.<br>~Green Armada</p>

            <p>The Thresher Maw&#39;s rough size of 60-90 meters in length gives it a severe size disadvantage to the sandworm, which is reportedly 400 meters long when full-grown. However, the sandworms are not built for speed or maneuverability, preferring to dig around  while the thresher maw can move very quickly and with great force if it&#39;s in a location that allows it to burrow. Since the sandworm would be less-than maneuverable in a place consisting of solid and impassable material, and the fight would be very boring as the two creatures flail and coil rather than actually engaging in combat, the fight would need to take place in a location where they could both burrow.<br><br>Since the sandworm&#39;s main method of prey location involves detecting and following vibration, it would be safe to say that the thresher maw&#39;s movement could be easily followed, due to its aggressive movement and almost seismic method of locomotion. Thus, most of the battle would take place underground, where the thresher maw has the advantage of speed, but loses its preferred attack method of thrusting itself aboveground and using its body mass against the opponent. Still, its belowground speed and physical power essentially makes up for that, and it would be just as able to find its opponent as the sandworm would, since it possesses a similar vibration-based detection system, so the sandworm wouldn&#39;t be able to change directions and come at it from a different angle without it noticing. <br><br>However, the sandworm is very difficult to entirely destroy. The only ways to kill them permanently involve attacking the spread-out vital segments(The wiki says that the humans killed them by applying electricity to each segment at once, so sandworms may be able to change which segments are most vital, or regenerate, or something of the sort. It wasn&#39;t very clear.), which the thresher maw may not have the capacity for, nucleic weaponry, which would kill the thresher maw as well, or introducing it to water. I have no idea how the water kills it, as the wikis only say something along the lines of &quot;The water, upon entering the sandworm&#39;s body, fatally accelerates its metabolism&quot;, so I&#39;m not sure whether it would be an easy kill for the thresher to just aim in the sandworm&#39;s open mouth. Possibly not, because of the pH difference between water and any sort of fast-acting acid, but it bears consideration nonetheless.<br>They balance this out with a rather small offensive capability. They have their teeth, yes, but since their mouths are structured in a trifoil formation with inward-facing jawlines, they aren&#39;t exactly able to bite anything; their mouths are more suited to swallowing objects whole and letting their furnace-like digestive system deal with the details, which won&#39;t exactly work on the threshers. Not only would the thresher maw be able to see, or rather feel, it coming, the sandworms&#39; mouths aren&#39;t large enough to swallow a full-grown thresher, especially if it&#39;s fighting to get away. In fact, even if it did manage to swallow the thresher, blood or other circulatory fluid is close enough to water that it can give the worms trouble, and be just as fatal in quantities above a few random humans that get caught in a truck the worm swallowed when it surface. The thresher would have enough blood to kill the sandworm outright, assuming it&#39;s chemically akin to blood on Earth, which usually stays at around 7.4 pH. If the blood isn&#39;t similar enough, however, the thresher&#39;s body would be so lodged in the worm&#39;s system that it would very likely end up strangling its digestive system the creature, which would end the fight in a draw.<br><br>Overall, however, I&#39;m giving the thresher maw the win here. The sandworm would be hard to kill, but it could still be incapacitated and eventually worn down, while the sandworm simply doesn&#39;t have the right kind of offensive capacity to take out a full-grown thresher. A thresher maw, on the other hand, is enormously powerful offensively, and, while  not as defensively powerful as the sandworms, it would still be able to take a lot more punishment than the sandworm can give it. It would be a very long fight, since it&#39;s a battle between two resilient behemoths instead of smaller and quicker beings, but I still say the thresher wins out at the end.<br><br>Admittedly, I&#39;m not terribly proficient in either fandom; I got the information here from wiki-trawling and from reading a few of the Dune books a while back, so I could easily have missed something important to tip the scales one way or the other. Anyone have any corrections to make? </p>

            <p>My one issues is that you seem to have assumed the pH of water to be its primary means of harming sandworms. Given that the creatures exist in very dry environments and water kills them by &quot;accelerating [their] metabolism&quot;, I think that any electrolyte or solvent would have a similar effect. Furthermore, if they are evolved for fast water uptake, they would likely have a difficult time of preventing something like Thresher acid from entering their systems. Doesn&#39;t really change the outcome, but it probably tips the odds further in favor of the Maw.</p>

            <p>You do make some good points, admittedly, but I think you are missing some key things.<br><br>1) The Rancor has long, thin fingers attached to its claws.  Easy to grip.

            <p>I liken tough skin to something that most of us, I think, are familiar with: chain mail.  Chain mail was invented to stop a select group of weapons that were causing no end of trouble for people with inferior armor.  Swords and, to some extent, arrows fall under that category.  Chain mail is very effective protection against a sword.<br><br>The problem with chain mail is that it is not rigid, like plate armor (which was invented to fix this problem).  It is flexible, like skin.  So, if someone comes along with a big club, the chain mail (tough skin) will be fine and not break.  The same cannot be said for the bones beneath the chain mail/tough skin.  The best weapon against chain mail is a mace or other blunt instrument.<br><br>Now, to get back to the debate at hand.  The Rancor and Cave Troll both have tough skin.  That means that claws and, to some extent) teeth are much less effective against both of them.  It was brought up that the Rancor has claws, and it seems to have sharp teeth.  Therefore, the Cave Troll&#39;s tough skin is an effective defense.  On the other hand, the Cave Troll has blunt nails and a small mouth with blunt teeth (making it possibly herbivorous?).  It uses clubs, chains, and spears, at the least, to fight.  So, the Rancor&#39;s tough skin is a far less effective defense.<br><br>Consider this, a blow from the Cave Troll&#39;s club to the Rancor&#39;s knee (or elbow/back/neck/ankle/wrist for that matter) which is large and at the perfect level for the Troll to smash it, would be devastating to the Rancor&#39;s ability to fight.  A blow from the Rancor&#39;s claws would need to hit a small, vital area (the eyes for example) to have the same hindering effect.<br><br>As for blaster bolts...I think it is safe to assume that a sword is less damaging than a blaster.<br><br>-Phobos, bringing a Cave Troll to a knife fight</p>

            <p>Why is the Cave Troll allowed to use blunt weaponry in this scenario, while the Rancor is not? I realize that the Rancor has claws on the ends of its fingers, but that&#39;s a comparatively small advantage considering that, as you said, claws that will not penetrate the thick hide of the Cave Troll that are situated on the thin and easy-to-potentially-damage fingers of the Rancor make for a small, if not near-negligible, advantage.<br><br>However, the Cave Troll, when allowed to use its choice of blunt weapons, will almost certainly have a sizable tactical advantage, especially if it&#39;s a smart enough Troll to take advantage of how top-heavy the Rancor is and swing those blunt and heavy weapons at its knees, which as you said, are perfectly within its reach given the size differential between the two creatures.<br>The Cave Troll is still capable of fighting the Rancor without its club, but it would lose a bit of its fighting prowess without it, due to a necessity to change its usual combat style of &quot;swing whatever&#39;s in your hand at the opponent&quot;. It&#39;s debatable whether that decrease would give the Rancor something of an unfair advantage itself, but we can&#39;t remove all of the factors or we&#39;ll have two of the same creature going against each other.</p>

This is incorrect - Yakuza can be women; an example is Goto Mayuki, the partner of Goto Kenji from the Kyokoto-kai Yakuza family of Tokyo, who sometimes, to quote Yaakov Raz&#39;s book <i>My Brother the Yakuza</i>, has to be stronger than a man.</p>

            <p>I figured that out about the time I was deciding whether to bother gender-bending a character who doesn&#39;t much care about what bits she has. {= ) I found out that women in the yakuza are the exception rather than the rule, though—all the big organized crime organizations I&#39;ve heard of come from very patriarchal cultures and are basically boys&#39; clubs—and I didn&#39;t think it would set a good example for me to go &quot;Well hey, it <i>can</i> happen, so it&#39;s totally okay for me to do it!&quot; Plus, if it&#39;s okay for my character, it should be okay for Rachel, and that makes her just a bit less ridiculous, which is no fun.<br><br>In other words, I think a generalization is appropriate here.

            <p>Sorry, just had to get that out of my system :)<br><br>As I&#39;ve said before, I think this is brilliant. I&#39;m still slightly in awe of the fact that you managed to write such a cohesive mission from such an incoherent fic. <br><br>Ilraen&#39;s line about the &#39;angle wings&#39; is one of my favourites, and I also (obviously) really like the &#39;KHAAAAAAAAAN!&#39; scene. Jenni&#39;s description of the &#39;bath&#39; was really well done, although I do have to agree with Nume a little bit - still some very nice wordsmithing though.<br><br>I think you did a good job of balancing the attention given to each of your agents throughout - they all had different strengths, and they had some great character interactions along the way.<br><br>Using logic to do the Duty, and (perhaps even more importantly) render the Sue helpless <i>first</i>, was fantastic.   <br><br>I really enjoyed reading this. </p>

            <p>To be fair, given the number of canons dragged into the fic, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it did eventually pull in some <i>Star Trek</i> (I still haven&#39;t read it all the way through), although I guess that wouldn&#39;t really fit in with the &#39;anime night at the Pit&#39; theme that it currently has.</p>

            <p>Nah, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any <i>Trek</i> in the badfic (so far). I know FMA gets dragged into it, though. See, Rachel has to sacrifice her arms at some point—this is to show that she&#39;s not a Sue, because bad things happen to her and she has to suffer consequences—and then Winry hooks her up with automail, which I guess is kinda uncomfortable for a few minutes, so see, totally not a Sue! Because getting automail could not in any way be construed as cool, a badass upgrade, or making the sacrifice totally meaningless. *rolls eyes*<br><br>I love this fic. <sup>_<sup><br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

            <p>Man, you have just done an overall excellent job with this mission.  It has so many parts, and the badfic itself threw you so many problems, but you&#39;ve worked everything together so seamlessly!<br><br>First of all, <i>six animes</i>.  If I weren&#39;t such a completionist PPC worshipper, I wouldn&#39;t even have read this mission, because I hate anime and know nothing about these ones.  But I didn&#39;t have any trouble in this mission keeping track of all the different ones because of how well-informed your agents kept me through the their dialogue.  Even better, these explanations <i>felt</i> like dialogue, and not like narrative info-dumping.  (Lucy/<i>Elfen Lied</i> is the one aspect of the crossover that I didn&#39;t learn about as much.  A bit more info on her would have been nice, unless Nume&#39;s vagueness was to avoid spoilers?)<br><br>Supernumerary+Ilraen+Jenni makes an utterly excellent team of agents, banter-wise.  The back-and-forth between Nume and Jenni, with Ilraen refereeing, made the mission seem to go fast, despite its length.  You might want to consider having Jenni tag along more often.  &gt;_&gt;  It&#39;s also good to see that Ilraen is taking more responsibility for what goes on, not only within the mission, but in generally taking care of his partner as well.  (Although I shudder to imagine what the results of that last paragraph will be.)  Speaking of shuddering, I&#39;m also very glad that you used Jenni&#39;s own confrontation with way-too-gross-for-her to give her a better respect for when Nume&#39;s squick buttons get pushed too far.<br><br>You also handled well the badfic&#39;s switching back and forth between hilariously stupid plots and dialogue and horrifyingly offensive events and behaviors.  The agents&#39; reactions to both stayed realistic, and avoided trivializing the bad stuff while still having fun with the dumb stuff.<br><br>Two little errors!<br><br>&quot;Jenni glared daggers at Nume, who only glared back Ilraen kept a firm pressure on her shoulders, keeping her pinned to the table.&quot;  (missing period)<br><br>&quot;In frustration, Nume threw his notepad to the floor a satisfying slap.&quot;  (missing . . . something)<br><br>Also, this might seem like a piddling little thing to complain about, but I&#39;m disappointed that you didn&#39;t do <i>something</i> with &quot;Les Tacos,&quot; the Mexican restaurant that&#39;s apparently also partly French?  I laughed harder at that incorrect-language pronoun than anything else!  Just. . .<br><br><i>Les Tacos</i>!  XD  Frog leg taco, anyone?  Or perhaps escargot with chili in a croissant burrito?</p>

            <p>I always look forward to your reviews. {= )<br><br>Aw, how come you hate anime? I totally get not being into it—you have to be willing to accept a lot of bizarre stuff to enjoy most of it—but why the hate? Also, what have you seen, and can I recommend some that are not overly weird?<br><br>Still, I&#39;m glad you were able to enjoy the mission regardless. I didn&#39;t get into Lucy as much mostly because I didn&#39;t feel like I could take the time to discuss her in detail that late in the mission, and it wouldn&#39;t have made the fic make more sense anyway. But yeah, fully explaining her would spoil the show, which is all about the mystery of what her deal is.<br><br>Jenni is not allowed to tag along more often, I&#39;m afraid. She&#39;s supposed to be doing her time as not-the-main-character, and it&#39;s a struggle to keep her that way—she has a tendency to dominate any given situation, partly because that&#39;s her personality, partly because she was my avatar for a very long time and writing her comes more naturally than writing anyone else. On the other hand, this story was a great way to make her not be right about everything and suffer consequences for making assumptions. Though, in her defense, Nume made it really easy for her, and he has an equal share in everything that went wrong.<br><br>Ilraen will be stepping up to the plate more from here on out. Working with other agents and generally being exposed to new people and situations has opened his eyes to some of what he&#39;s actually capable of. Don&#39;t worry about the last paragraph too much. {= ) I&#39;m not sure exactly where I&#39;m going with that yet, but I can at least promise it won&#39;t involve Lux beyond him maybe reading her book. That would be way too obvious.<br><br>Re. Les Tacos, I left it alone mostly because (again) I didn&#39;t feel like I had time to delve into it at that point, and also I didn&#39;t have any great ideas for it. I figured it was stupid just because it&#39;s uninspired as well as incorrect Spanish (didn&#39;t occur to me that <i>les</i> is French), but it seems like it&#39;s possible to find lots of different reasons to laugh at it. Phobos tells me he thinks it sounds like a lesbian hangout, for instance. Perhaps it&#39;s best that it&#39;s left up to the readers to put their own spin on it?<br><br>I&#39;ve had fish tacos (which were okay aside from being too spicy for me), but I dunno about frog tacos. Not sure how you&#39;d coax a croissant into a cylindrical shape, either. Maybe snail chili could work, but that would take a lot of snails. {X D<br><br>Thanks for catching those typos!

            <p>It&#39;s not the content of anime that turns me off to them, so much as the animation style.  Most of the stuff I&#39;ve seen on TV has such sketchy, cheap-looking animation.  Things like the mouths barely moving, the over-dramatic emotional cues (giant sweat drops, falling over, etc.) make me feel like the animators didn&#39;t put as much work into the show as they could have.  I guess I&#39;m just spoiled, growing up on Disney movies?<br><br>And I realize that&#39;s not true of all anime, and that the Studio Ghibli stuff is pretty solid.  I just have difficulty even approaching the genre as a whole anymore.</p>

            <p>I recommend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moribito:_Guardian_of_the_Spirit"><i>Moribito</i></a>. It&#39;s more serious and period-piece-like than most of what you see on TV, and has a more sober animation style to match. The story, characters, and world are all really strong, and the series isn&#39;t all that long; just 26 episodes. Sadly, I&#39;m not quite sure where to find it at the moment. It used to be on Netflix, but it wasn&#39;t there when I searched yesterday. {= (<br><br>There&#39;s also stuff like <i>Princess Mononoke</i>, <i>Spirited Away</i>, <i>Cowboy Bebop</i>, <i>Trigun</i>, and <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>, all of which are more stylized than <i>Moribito</i>, but widely regarded as high-quality and not too opaque to be enjoyed by newcomers. <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> is worthwhile for the soundtrack alone, IMO, and heavily influenced by American music and films, so it&#39;s almost more American than Japanese overall. <i>Bebop</i> and <i>Trigun</i> are both space westerns, actually, though the latter is not very heavy on the &quot;space&quot; aspect.<br><br>I will say that things like sweat-drops, stress marks, nosebleeds, etc. are just part of a different set of visual tropes than we&#39;re used to in Western animation (where we have legs turning into wheels to indicate really fast running, fights represented by dust clouds with limbs randomly popping out, and people&#39;s whole heads turning red and exploding with rage), so it may help to keep that in mind if you come across stuff that sounds interesting on paper. Also, I learned recently that the big eyes, small mouth aesthetic got into Japanese animation by way of artists who were inspired by Disney, so it&#39;s at least partially Disney&#39;s fault that modern anime looks the way it does. <sup>_~</sup> Still, that stuff can be overused just like any other trope, and you can&#39;t help it if it turns you off regardless.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Most of the stuff that goes on TV IS cheap - a lot of shonen (think about Dragonball) or Magical Girl stuff is aimed to children or teens, and so is quantity over quality.<br><br>The gems are usually those that either get broadcasted at improbable hours, or don&#39;t get aired out of Japan at all.<br><br>I think you should really try to watch some of the widely recognized good series, possibly in Japanese with subtitles (a lot of things get lost in the dubs).

            <p>That was awesome. Granted, I only knew one of the continua involved (Hetalia), but I don&#39;t think I need more. It seemed to me that the mission was more about the agents, as all good missions are. I like how even someone like Jenni has a point when she can get squicked, and where that point is, and I like  Ilraen being mature because we/I have a tendency to coddle him but we/I need to remember that he is an adult. (I don&#39;t know whether other people know him as adorable naive blue centaur alien.) And Nume is always awesome - I&#39;m not so much of a fangirl anymore, but he&#39;s still one of my favorite agents. I love his interactions with Jenni.<br><br>Considering all the other amazing things, I&#39;m rather ashamed to admit that my favorite part was the Khan joke. <br><br>Oh, and speaking of Star Trek, two things:<br><br>1. You said something a while back about being disappointed with Into Darkness, and the more I think about it the more I don&#39;t like reboot. So even though I seemed rather gushy then, I&#39;ve come to see its flaws. Now I regard it as a guilty pleasure.<br><br>2. I seem to recall you saying something about particularly liking DS9. I&#39;m on season 3, and it is just so awesome. It&#39;s rare that I can&#39;t decide on a favorite character, but in this case everyone is just too interesting and neurotic. Actually, I lied, I think my favorite character is Garak, but I can&#39;t decide of the main cast. So you were right, it <i>is</i> great. :)<br><br>So yeah, great mission, and it&#39;s awesome to have you back!</p>

            <p>Thanks! I&#39;m glad you liked it, and I don&#39;t think you should be ashamed of particularly enjoying the Khan joke, since it was pretty much aimed at you. {= )<br><br>I <i>hope</i> people have known Ilraen as &quot;adorable naive blue centaur alien,&quot; because that&#39;s how I&#39;ve written him. He&#39;s slowly emerging as a pretty awesome dude, though, especially if what we see in stuff like &quot;Catastrophe Theory&quot; has any resonance at all with the prime timeline. (I think it does.) Nobody quite realizes what a badass they have on their hands, but they may yet. We&#39;ll see.<br><br>Not surprised to hear the rose-colored glasses have faded with regards to Nume. I love him, but he&#39;s a big jerk. <sup>_~<br><br>I&#39;m</sup> writing some backstory with him and Jenni, which seems like it will please people. BRN really got me thinking about how they got to be the way they are; i.e., why they associate with each other despite apparently not being able to go two minutes without arguing. It makes me happy to know that people besides me like their dynamic, so it won&#39;t just be a self-indulgent project.<br><br>Now, <i>Star Trek</i>:<br><br>1. I hope that&#39;s not on my account. <sup>_<sup>;</sup></sup> I do like the first reboot movie a lot, just to clarify. I&#39;m not against the overall idea; I just thought it was lazy of <i>Into Darkness</i> to ride on the coattails of its predecessor rather than taking the opportunity to do something completely new.<br><br>2. OMG Garak is the most awesome ever you have no idea!!1one! ... *cough* Ahem. That is, yes, I concur that DS9 is highly enjoyable and so is our resident genteel tailor. Also, I love his relationship with Bashir, and I ship that. Of the main cast... heck, I don&#39;t know, either. I do like Bashir, but he occasionally suffers for <i>Trek</i>&#39;s tendency to play fast and loose with how biology works. Kira kicks so much ass, and so does Cisco. I used to like Odo more, but now I think he&#39;s best taken in his dynamic with others, especially Kira and Quark. The first few seasons are pretty Quark-heavy, as I recall. That bugged me, but he ends up rather likeable overall, IMO, so it&#39;s worth it.<br><br>And that&#39;s enough of that for this post, I think. <sup>_<sup>;</sup></sup> I&#39;m glad you&#39;re enjoying it so far. There&#39;s loads more awesomeness ahead! {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Of course, the fact that he&#39;s likely going to be covered in shortening will make it more difficult for him to take sharp turns than the other mini-Gorn, but considering that the shortening will probably leave stains on the fangirls&#39; outfits when he tackles them, I say it&#39;s a good exchange.<br><br>Alternatively, the coordinators could just wash him off, but where would the fun be in that?<br><br>(P.S.

            <p>Seriously, do you remember when writing a mission <i>didn&#39;t</i> inevitably lead to staring at a 26-page document and exclaiming, &quot;But I&#39;m only halfway through!&quot;? I&#39;d better get back to that one, actually...<br><br>This was a departure from the missions I usually read, simply because I don&#39;t know any of the canons in the slightest. But despite that, you peppered it with enough stuff that I had a good time. I liked the agents&#39; interaction - the scenes around the first blood explosion and the baths stood out on that score - and the way you managed to get Nume to give most of the charge list without it being a charge list yet. Yes, someone noticed you doing that. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This is at least shorter than &quot;Ring Child,&quot; if Tripod&#39;s file size count is to be believed... but yeah, I&#39;m deliberately gunning for a smaller fic next time around. The Lichen is going to cut them a break. It&#39;s not totally heartless like some of its colleagues, after all. *cue evil laughter off-screen* {; )<br><br>I had fun writing the not-a-charge-list, so I&#39;m glad you noticed! Nume does declare that he&#39;s charging her early on, though. I felt I had to make sure everything he says to her afterward is technically official, if you squint at it sideways.<br><br>Sounds like not many people are familiar with these continua. I&#39;d strongly recommend <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> and <i>Princess Mononoke</i> to anyone. <i>Avatar</i> is an all-around fantastic show with a fully developed world, strong characters, and really great writing. <i>Princess Mononoke</i> (and pretty much anything else by Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli) is widely regarded as a good starter anime—it&#39;s approachable and has a complex morality that makes you think instead of just shoving the answer in your face. You can sympathize with everyone&#39;s side of the conflict to some degree, which I love. The English voice cast is pretty star-studded, if that counts for anything.<br><br>Anyway, thanks!

            <p>That reminds me, I need to add it to the list of assassination methods.

I was trying to come up with a way to explain why the whole Word World doesn&#39;t instantly go *poof* when Rachel and Elaine vanish, taking the agents with it. The best I could come up with was a ripple effect, but then Phobos showed me the slinky video and I thought that was perfect for visualizing how the bits of the world furthest from the point of collapse remain stable until the shock wave gets there. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s noticeable, but I even wrote the escape sequence so that the quakes take a little longer to start each time the agents jump backward scene-wise as they&#39;re rounding up the canon characters.

            <p>I haven&#39;t considered the humor aspect of PPC writing my strongest suit, so it&#39;s great to hear you found the mission so funny. <sup>_^</sup> What were your favorite bits?

            <p>The MST style Star Trek refence was probaly the best joke out of all of them. As well as the sudden terror at the attempt at fan service was pretty good. As for some of the stuff you could have done better, You missed a great chance for a Ghostbusters shout-out when &quot;God&quot; mentioned how the sue and Inuyasha were two halves needed to create one whole which also could have given you a way to kill the sue and techincly be within the canon of the badfic. That is if you remember how the heroes defeated the &quot;God&quot; creature that resulted in the union aslo catgirls are a fairly common race for japanophile fangirls though this one wasn&#39;t ditzy and prone to mewing and saying nya.  <br><br>She did have the rule of sexy/coustume porn sterotype. If you want a canon example try to find a hentai series called Dragon Pink or look and SFW Darkstalkers for the best examples. </p>

            <p>Are you talking about the original <i>Ghostbusters</i> movie, or something else? TBH, the thing I remember the most about the first movie is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. {= / There was something about the Gatekeeper and the Keymaster (I think?), but weren&#39;t they Bill Murray&#39;s girlfriend and Rick Moranis, respectively? I don&#39;t recall either of them needing to die to defeat Zuul or whatever.<br><br>I don&#39;t agree that &quot;KHAAAN!&quot; was the best joke, considering it&#39;s probably the one that took the least actual thought on my part, but hey, I can&#39;t complain if people enjoyed it that much. {= )<br><br>Oh, Reicheru says &quot;nya&quot; all the freaking time, especially later on in the badfic. Actually, she says &quot;nya-on!&quot; (with or without the addition of tildes), which I suppose is her putting her own unique spin on it. I just didn&#39;t feel like getting into it in the mission, since there were so many more important things to worry about.<br><br>Not personally into hentai/porn, but thanks, I guess?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The mission is of course long, but it kept its pace thanks to the factor of sheer &quot;<i>What the f*** am I looking at</i>&quot; that pervaded the mission.

            <p>I had actually finished looking over the RC 1810 interlude a while ago. As in, late July. Did you post an addition to the story a while back that I hadn&#39;t looked over yet? I&#39;m checking the Google Doc now, and it doesn&#39;t look like you did, so I&#39;m not sure what prompted the extra waiting. The only issues I had left with it that weren&#39;t either altered or explained related to why exactly the Marquis decided to change around the RC 1810 dynamic, which had never really been addressed, and I concluded eventually that it wasn&#39;t supposed to have been addressed at all, and was simply to be put down to the Flowers&#39; odd assignment methods or something of the sort.<br><br>However, if you were referring to a second beta that simply hasn&#39;t shown up, then I apologize for presuming you were talking about me.

            <p>I&#39;ve seen this issue come up on the Board time and time again: hopeful writers presenting would-be that fail to meet the standards of the PPC in their bids for permission. It&#39;s a tricky thing, trying to make a good character without falling into a few pitfalls. So, as I mentioned wanting to try my hand at a few workshops in my return message, I decided to start off with character creation. I&#39;l begin with a few tips and tricks of my own and conclude with a writing challenge for all of you.<br><br>NOTE: The following is geared mostly towards making PPC agents, but can be applied to creating characters for works outside of our little group as well.<br><br><b>The Premise</b><br><br>Typically when one creates a new character, one has at least a basic idea of what said character is going to be like. It can usually be parsed out into a short and simple description, like &quot;lazy and reluctant upper-class soldier&quot; or &quot;aggressive gamer girl.&quot; Those lines are good places to start, but you should never get too attached to them. You might find yourself taking the character in a different direction as they become more developed. If said direction seems like a good one, then you should pursue it to its end.<br><br>Notice how neither of the descriptions mentioned in the previous paragraph said anything about appearance. That should be your last concern when making a character. If you&#39;ve ever made a model car or figure, then you know to never paint it first. Plus, you might find something in the fleshing-out process that affects the look of your character. That&#39;s where Laura&#39;s broken nose came from.<br><br><b>Fleshing It Out</b><br><br>A simple line is all very well and good for a background character with one or two bits or dialogue, but agents need more. That means you need more. The best way I&#39;ve found to flesh out a character is to free-write them into very short scenarios -- drabbles, if you will. The first thing that comes to your mind regarding how your character would react? Write it down. The nature of their reaction can aid in shaping their personality. Using this new aspect of your character, write another random scenario drabble. Repeat the process until you feel like you&#39;ve got a good grip on what this character is all about.<br><br>You should also know as much about your character&#39;s past as possible. What events shaped them in their childhood? In high school? In college? Did they even pursue an education? What&#39;s their family like? And so on and so forth. I&#39;m not saying create a timeline (although that might help you), but you might want to consider writing short stories about some of those major events. The best way to know your characters is to write about them.<br><br><b>From Elsewhere and Elsewhen</b><br><br>Obviously, the nature of the PPC means that agents can be from just about any piece of fiction to have ever come into existence. If you&#39;re going to make an agent from another reality, then you should bone up on the various aspects of said reality. That goes double if you&#39;re making a character from a continuum that you know is popular amongst the community you&#39;re writing for, like <i>Lord of the Rings</i> or <i>Harry Potter</i> for the PPC. Fans can be, well, fanatical about the little details.<br><br>At the very least, you should comb through any specific wikis relating to the nature of your character. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of the <i>Halo</i> series -- played parts of some of the games and read a few of the novels -- but I looked up everything I could on <i>Halo</i>verse AIs when creating Cornelius.<br><br>Making a character with powers -- magic, metahuman abilities, chi, or whatever -- is a bit more complicated. I&#39;ll get into the nuances of that in a follow-up post.<br><br><b>Find Their Voice</b><br><br>A good character has something distinctive in their voice that sets them apart. It might be something big, like an accent or a verbal tic, or small, like what specific words they choose. A lot of swear words might indicate a coarse character who doesn&#39;t care what other people think. Strictly structured speech can reflect an equally structured mind. Basically, if you&#39;re writing or reading back-and-forth dialogue between two people without descriptors like &#39;he said&#39; or &#39;she said,&#39; you should be able to tell who is who based on how and what they say without having to look back at the beginning of the conversation.<br><br><b>The Final Details</b><br><br>Keeping everything you&#39;ve learned about your character throughout this process in mind, you can finally get to work on their overall look. Constantly ask yourself questions throughout this process. How does the character move? How do they walk? Are there any familiar gestures they use? Do they smoke? Do they drink? Do they have tattoos or piercings? Anything that can reflect on the nature of your character should be considered at least for a moment.<br><br>You should consider the hairstyle and clothing choices of character as reflective of how they are, and not how you think they should be. I wrote Danny as being a somewhat serious-minded lover of literature, so I put him in the sweater-shirt-tie combination. Gremlin the athletic street thug would obviously have clothing aimed at free movement as well as a few tattoos. The only reason she would wear something even remotely formal would be for flirtatious reasons.<br><br><b>Your Challenge</b><br><br>Take a character -- it can be a concept you&#39;ve had brewing in your mind or a pre-existing figure, although I would prefer the former -- and pick one of the following scenarios to write a few paragraphs on.<br>[Character] is late for an important event.<br>[Character] is helping a friend with a favor.<br>[Character] is going through their morning routine.<br>[Character] has suffered some momentary setback.<br>[Character] is responding to criticism.<br>Did that help you understand your character a bit better, or perhaps uncover some part of them you didn&#39;t know about? (You can see why I now prefer you use a concept rather than a character you already know.) Read and critique other entries as well, just because. I put it to you, PPC!<br><br>Have fun and good writing to you all. Stay tuned for future workshop/advice/things in the future!<br><br>PoorCynic</p>

            <p>Theodore was awake before his alarm went off, and as such was able to swing himself out of bed and shut the clock up before it had finished its second beep. <br><br>He moved from his bed to the door in near total darkness, grabbed his dressing gown from the hook it was hanging on, and walked out into the main area of the RC. He advanced cautiously into the living room, groping along the wall for the lightswitch – while his bedroom floor was perfectly safe to navigate in darkness, the same could not necessarily be said of the shared areas.<br><br>The lights came on, revealing a typical RC. Like many others, it was furnished in a somewhat haphazard manner - although the typical look of an RC could be summarised as ‘whatever we found that we wanted’, leading to an inevitable clash of styles, in this case there seemed to be a deliberate theme of contrasting technology. An ornate grandfather clock kept time next to a top of the line 3D TV, and various other odds and ends were a mix of archaic and high-tech. <br><br>The floor was mercifully free from hindrances such as discarded clothing and takeaway wrappers – either his partner had returned unusually sober, or hadn’t made it back yet. Faint sounds of snoring as he passed the door to the other bedroom indicated the former. <br><br>He had a light breakfast of orange juice and toast, before dressing in sweatpants and a vest; ready for his morning run. He left his RC and went out into the DIA wing: Central was pretty quiet, but that was hardly surprising considering that his alarm was set to go off a couple of hours before the early shift began. Theodore nodded to the few night shifters still around, and headed out into the rest of HQ.<br><br>He paid no attention to where he was going, running with his head down – he hated having his morning run interrupted, and deliberately ignored his surroundings, in case he saw something that he’d have to take official notice of. <br><br>One he’d worked up a good sweat, not to mention a gnawing hunger, he quickly made his way back to his RC. DIA agents seemed to be less affected by HQ’s notoriously difficult to navigate corridors, probably thanks to Legal. <br><br>When he got back to his RC, he wasn’t exactly surprised to see that the door to his partner’s bedroom still hadn’t been opened, in fact, if volume of snores was anything to go by, he was sleeping even deeper than when Theo had left. <br><br>He stripped out of his sweat-stained clothes and showered, in water so hot he could only just stand it, steaming up the small bathroom till it seemed foggy. The mirror had steamed up, but a brief press of his finger against the touch sensitive panel in the corner of the glass and it instantly cleared. As far as Theo was concerned, some aspects of modern/future technology were nothing short of miraculous, but then there were other times when the old ways were best. <br><br>Grey eyes regarded him momentarily, before he looked away to gather his shaving tools. Modern shaving foam was paired with an antique cut-throat razor, and he began working with careful and deliberate motions, eyes closed, relying on the feel of the blade gliding over his skin. <br><br>When he was finished, his skin was completely smooth, and he regarded himself critically in the mirror before washing up. His hair, a similar colour to his eyes now that he’d turned forty, was getting a little long and unruly by his standards, and he made a mental note to get it cut sometime soon. <br><br>Refreshed and clean, he headed out into the kitchen again, and fixed himself a heavier second breakfast of cold meats, cheese and bread. The smell of brewing coffee, from hand-ground beans, pervaded through the RC.<br><br>While Theodore was finishing his second breakfast, a beeping from elsewhere in the rooms indicated his partner was getting up, although the number of slaps and thuds suggested that he was having difficulty finding the ‘snooze’ button, and would likely be late to start again. <br><br>With his breakfast finished, and the small amount of washing up it had generated done, Theodore poured himself a fresh cup of coffee and moved over to his writing desk. The desk was relatively clear: a notepad and old fashioned fountain pen were on the left, and a tablet computer was on the right. Between them was a framed ferrotype, showing an image of himself and beautiful young woman – his sister, long dead now, killed by the same Assassins that had recruited him. It served as a daily reminder of why he’d joined the DIA, and not the DMS or one of the other Action Departments.<br><br>He gave his sister a moment of silence, raising his coffee in salute to her – she’d always drunk more of the stuff than he did anyway, before turning to the business of the day. He made a note about visiting his barber on the pad, while waiting the few seconds for the tablet to power up, then began flicking through his e-mails. <br><br>A few were personal, but the majority were work related. A black market shipment of Bleeprin had turned out to be nothing more than sugar pills, resulting in several hyperactive agents spending the night in the DIA ‘cells’, actually repurposed RCs, until they were calm enough to be let out. <br><br>While he was reading and replying to those that needed it, every ten minutes or so his partner’s alarm went off, followed by the thuds of an at best half-awake person trying, and failing, to find the snooze button again. This continued until the grandfather clock chimed, at which point Theodore knew he had to get ready to leave. <br><br>He went back into his room and dressed in pinstripe trousers, a white shirt with black sleeve garters, and a black waistcoat – his usual attire when on duty. <br><br>There was still no sign that his partner would be up any time soon, so he grabbed his tablet and lever-action shotgun and headed out into DIA Central. The weapon may have seemed like overkill for a patrol officer, but like other aspects of Theodore’s life, his weapon of choice was a study in contrasts. The antique weapon was typically loaded with high-tech Tazer rounds, allowing him to take down a flamethrower crazy Agent relatively safely, both for him and them. <br><br>He made his way to his desk, hoping that it would be free – the DIA had to be ready to respond to events at any time, day or night, and so worked in shifts and hot-desked. Fortunately on this day his predecessor hadn’t overrun, and had even finished with enough time to tidy up and clear away properly.  <br><br>Theodore slid into the still warm seat, secured his shotgun in a rack at the side, then clipped his tablet into the docking station. He unlocked his drawer, one of four identical ones that were part of the desk, and took out his stationery and the reports he was working on. The last thing that he took out was his nameplate, which he placed on the corner of the desk, angled so that anyone walking down the aisle could see his name: T. Shacklemore. <br><br><br><br><b>Author&#39;s Note</b>: <br>I&#39;ve had ideas for writing a DIA Agent for a while now, but didn&#39;t really do anything about it. This seemed like a perfect oppourtunity to take the idea further, and I have to say that I found it very useful for coming up with his character - I&#39;ve got half-completed Interlude involving Theo actually interacting with some other agents, and notes for some more stuff that I can do with him. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d normally have such detailed plans at this early stage. <br><br>So thanks, PoorCynic, for posting this workshop - I look forward to seeing what other topics you cover.<br><br>While on the subject of this workshop in particular, I would just add that most agents come in pairs - when developing ideas for agent characters, it&#39;s probably a good idea to think about them in terms of interactions with their partner, as well as purely as individuals (and yes, I realise that my piece featuring a single agent does somewhat undermine the point I&#39;m trying to make). Think about where their attitudes/outlook might be similar, and where they&#39;ll be completely different - just a little bit of extra advice for anyone thinking about their first agent pair. <br><br></p>

            <p>I seem to know Theodore Shacklemore quite well already, and although there was no direct interaction, I got some ideas how his partner and their relationship might be. I specifically noticed that Theo made no attempt to make his partner get up in time, and I expect to find out whether he doesn’t care or had bad experiences in a future story.<br><br>I know that this cannot be edited here, but in case you want to post it again elsewhere:<br><br><i>One he’d worked up a good sweat,</i><br>You meant &quot;Once&quot;, right?<br><br><i>showing an image of himself and beautiful young woman</i><br>There is an &quot;a&quot; missing between &quot;and&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot;.<br><br>HG </p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you think it worked. It was interesting trying to characterise his relationship with his partner without the partner actually being present.<br><br>Yup, I will probably be posting this as an actual Interlude at some point, or using it as the intro to a longer piece (it&#39;d be a waste of Theo&#39;s characterisation if I didn&#39;t do something with him now), so thanks for pointing out those mistakes. </p>

            <p>Wizards. Superhumans. The gifted. Whatever you&#39;d like to call them. Crafting characters with special abilities is a task with a few special hurdles of its own. It&#39;s not that powers themselves make a character a Sue or Stu; even the most powerful heroes and villains can be balanced and well-crafted characters. It is, however, easier to create a Sue or Stu with powers if written poorly. As such, there are a couple things to keep in mind during the character creating process.<br><br><b>Knowing Their Limits</b><br><br>Whenever I make someone with special abilities, I make sure to give them clear(ish) limits on what they can do. It&#39;s too easy to allow the limits of someone&#39;s power to creep up over time as the threats escalate. The <i>Dragonball</i> series is a prime example of such a phenomenon taking place, as is Silver Age Superman.<br><br>There are two kinds of limits I use: physical and mental. Physical limits are just as they sound. The character in question can&#39;t use their power in certain ways, or if they do they run the risk of hurting or killing themselves. Mental limits are things that a character could do with their power but don&#39;t because it violates their personal code. The psychic who doesn&#39;t read other people&#39;s minds because it&#39;s an invasion of privacy. Mental limits are obviously easier to push past, but doing so might open up an entirely new can of worms. Maybe they become wracked with guilt. Maybe they start questioning the rest of their moral code and start on their way to the Dark Side (so to speak).<br><br>For example: I used both physical and mental limits when creating Gremlin. She has the ability to manipulate electricity and electrical fields, which by itself could have a pretty broad application (electromagnetism, weather manipulation, technopathy, and so on). I put a physical block on her by making her ability a subtle and unflashy one. She can&#39;t hurl lightning bolts or fly or anything like that. At most, she could manipulate existing electrical phenomena. I wrote an (as of yet unpublished) interlude where she &#39;pulled&#39; the electrical arc out of a stungun and was able to shape it into a marble-sized bit of ball lightning. Even then, doing so caused electrical burns to her hand. That&#39;s pretty much as showy as she can get.<br><br>Her mental limit is a bit more interesting. I decided when refining Gremlin for the PPC that she could, with a great deal of focus and effort, manipulate the natural electricity in creatures she happened to be touching. That is, she COULD but WOULDN&#39;T. Despite being a thief and something of rebel, Gremlin isn&#39;t a psychopath. Puppeting someone around by their own nervous system, tightening their muscles so hard that their tendons tear and their bones break, stopping their heart with a thought: those are the acts of a lunatic. It&#39;s invasive, brutal, and horrifying. The only way I could see Gremlin doing something like that was if her life (or someone she truly cared about) was in imminent mortal danger. Even then, she&#39;d definitely not be okay afterward.<br><br>Limits don&#39;t just apply to things like superpowers. Certain types of magic might require personal risk or sacrifice, like blood magic or bartering with a demon. Maybe learning certain spells means you can&#39;t learn others, in the vein of classic D&amp;D. Chi techniques might require mediation and adhering to strict personal vows like chastity or solitude.<br><br>Limits. Know &#39;em. Get &#39;em. Use &#39;em.<br><br><b>The Most Important Rule</b><br><br>Characterization always takes precedence over the power. ALWAYS. If you want to make a metahuman because you think that someone with a certain power would be cool or awesome, you&#39;re doing it wrong. Ask yourself if this character really needs a power or an ability.<br><br>A method I will sometimes use is I will craft a version of my intended powered character sans powers. The World Prime version of that individual, as it were. Then, knowing what I do about their character from that process, I add in a power. An origin story, as it were (if such a concept applies).<br><br>You shouldn&#39;t be afraid of creating characters with powers, nor should you automatically be suspicious of OCs with them. It might be easier to slip down the path into Sue or Stu-dom, but it&#39;s not a given. The most important thing to remember is to make them a real character, and not just a set of cool abilities.<br><br>PoorCynic</p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently (for the umpteenth time) in the process of writing a bit of original fiction, it&#39;s about the emergence of superheroes into a society much like our own only more xenophobic. Basically there are two teams of seven that the story will focus on, the Guardians and The Beta&#39;s (second-gen Guardians). Whilst the Guardians are a firmly established idea in my head the Beta&#39;s are relatively new, and its only in this incarnation of the story that there will actually be seven of them (opposed to 5 the rest of the times they&#39;ve appeared) however I&#39;m trying to work on a power for the seventh member of them that doesn&#39;t seem to overpowered but also ties quite nicely into the pool of powers the team has as a whole (being Perfect Vision (the ability to see fine through Fog, Fire, Liquid, Darkness but not Solids), Fog Generation and Manipulation, Rock Manipulation, Hydrokinesis, Wing Generation and (thereby) Flight, Super strength and Rock hard skin). I&#39;m trying not to be too influenced by either Generic superpowers or heroes from either DC or Marvel comics, making it harder for myself I know, but I don&#39;t want to write a story that has a Superman rip-off in it.<br><br>I suppose what I&#39;m really asking is that a) do you (and by you I mean person reading this) think that the combination of powers above or even any one power is too prone to become Sue&#39;s or Stu&#39;s (each person is separated by a comma) especially considering that with the world they&#39;re in it&#39;s more likely that there opponents will outnumber them but be normal humans? and b) what power would you add to that group that is not only different to them but would work with the above powers as well? <br><br></p>

            <p>Or maybe I just didn&#39;t communicate it well enough. It&#39;s not necessarily the powers that make a character a Sue or Stu, it&#39;s how well or poorly they&#39;re written. It would be easy to call Superman a Marty Stu with all his powers. And he can be at times, but that&#39;s not because of all the powers. It depends on the skill of the writer behind Superman.<br><br>All you&#39;ve given me is a list of powers. That means nothing to me. What are the characters using those powers like? How do they live their lives? Why should I care about them? The character should come first. Not the power.</p>

            <p>Five prompts, eh?  I happen to have exactly five planned-but-mostly-unwritten agents!  Eeeeeeeexcellent.<br><br>Only a couple done right now; more to come as I find the time to write them.<br><br>1. <i>Late for an important event . . .</i><br><br>The four sat down in the warmly lit study, as the servant closed the doors behind them.  As Bruce began to pour a cup of tea for his master and each visitor, Johnathan sighed and declared, “It&#39;s getting chillier and chillier every night!”<br><br>“That does tend to happen in Massachusetts in autumn, Johnathan.”  Edward, never smiling, rested his head in his hand as he leaned further into his seat, ignoring the glares from Edward&#39;s wife.<br><br>“I only hope Tabitha gets here soon,” Edward&#39;s mother croaked.  “It&#39;s not like her to be late, and it&#39;s much too cold for a lady to be outside by herself.”<br>* * *
<br>Tabitha Queens did not feel cold; she felt, in fact, as though her sides would burst with all the heat she had worked up running.  She slowed only slightly to turn as she reached another intersection between two streets, barely lit by gas lamps that flickered in the cold night.  Immediately upon starting down this new street, she spun around and continued running back to the previous one, in response to the scrabbling sounds already approaching from that direction.<br><br>She should have known these streets.  She had walked from her home to Ophelia&#39;s numerous times in the past two years, yet this night, she had somehow become lost.  No way she turned had led to a familiar path.  Now, she may as well have been in London instead of Boston, as though a whole new set of streets had been<br><i>highways in</i><br>hiding inside the buildings and under the cobbles, waiting for someone overly confident and foolish to wander in at just the right time.<br><br>Just the right time for the things with the red eyes that glowed in the night to find her.<br>* * *
<br>“Rather shocking, the whole business about that painter.”  Edward casually tapped the charred matter from the end of his cigar into an ashtray on the end table next to his chair.<br><br>Ophelia continued, her arthritic hands shaking.  “That artwork was so morbid!  I nearly fainted after seeing two paintings.  How an American gentleman could have such a morbid fancy.  Oh!”<br><br>“But what was in the paintings to be so alarming?” asked Josephine as Bruce refilled her teacup.<br><br>“Oh, monsters!  Awful, awful monsters . . .”<br><br>“Oh, madam,” said Johnathan, “I&#39;ve seen fantastical portraits of monsters before.  They—”<br><br>“This was different!”  The strength in Ophelia&#39;s voice made even Edward turn to look at her, his usual frown deepening slightly.  She continued, “You said, &#39;portraits of monsters,&#39; and that&#39;s it, precisely!  It was like a portrait, so . . . so . . . the muscles, the sinews, the <i>sweat</i>, even . . . it looked as though Richard Pickman had drawn the beasts from life.”<br>* * *
<br>Tabitha stumbled into a slightly larger intersection, slightly better lit.  Her skirts were now ragged from being stepped on too many times, and Tabitha was quite ready to eschew propriety and tear the bulky thing straight off.  Let the red-eyed creatures be distracted by finding it.  She would do the same to her long, brown hair, too—she had been certain that any moment something would grab it from behind and pull her back into the dark.<br><br>A renewed scratching behind her made Tabitha aware she had stopped running.  She moved as quickly as she could into the light in the center of the open roads.  She heard a ship&#39;s bell toll nearby—<i>could I really have run that close to the harbor?</i>—and took in her new surroundings, searching for news means of escape.  The walls and street here were terribly cracked and broken; it seemed impossible that anywhere in Boston could have been neglected by repair work long enough to reach this level of degradation.  She noticed with relief the dark, muscled figure of a man hunched underneath one of the gas lamps.<br><br>“Sir!” she called, her voice pitched high from adrenaline.  “Sir, help!  Flee!  There are wild beasts in the streets!”<br><br>The man stood up and turned around.  Tabitha halted so quickly that she fell to her knees and hands.  The black silhouette before her was only superficially that of a man.  Muscled arms and legs ended in clawed toes and fingers.  A canine head transfixed her gaze with glowing red eyes.  In one hand, the figure held a shattered human tibia, dripping with rotten, grey marrow.<br><br>Marrow which also dribbled from its toothy muzzle.<br><br>Later, Tabitha wouldn&#39;t even remember getting back to her feet.  She would only remember the ghoul throwing its head up, opening its mouth and howling, except not really howling, but making a high-pitched, whining giggle.  Other ghouls answered as Tabitha ran pell mell towards the docks, ready to plunge into the deathly cold water to avoid the red eyes that now peered from every shadow, every corner, every rooftop.<br><br>She forced herself to keep going, even as she scraped against and bounced off of the close-set buildings in the tight alleyway that led to the waterfront.  She emerged on the dock, startling two musket-bearing men with tri-cornered hats and red coats (unfortunately, she wouldn&#39;t remember that later, either; otherwise, she might have realized how odd it was) and finally reached the end of the wharf, new panic setting in too late to stop her from careening towards the sharp rocks below.<br><br>She instead tumbled down a small flight of steps, crying out as one of the stair&#39;s edges cut into her knee.  She opened her eyes, and immediately looked around the new street for more of the ghoulish creatures.  The creak of a door opened behind her.<br><br>“Tabitha?”  Johnathan smiled warmly as Tabitha Queens turned to face her companion.  “Are you quite all right?  You nearly missed tea!”<br><br>2. <i>Responding to criticism . . .</i><br><br>The Floating Hyacinth regarded the agent sitting on the other side of her desk.  Not visually, of course.  Even if she had eyes, her view would be obscured by the water droplets condensed on the side of the tank that housed her body.  Nonetheless, much could be observed about a human by examining its thoughts.<br><br>In this case, the waves of cold that reached the Flower&#39;s mind indicated the agent was probably leaning back against the back of the chair, arms crossed defiantly over his chest.  Beneath that obvious, conscious emotion of resentment was the sensation the Hyacinth had learned to identify this particular individual by: the grey, dull feeling of flatness in his mind, the disinterest with which he met most tasks that didn&#39;t appeal to him.  This was how the Hyacinth could imagine his messy and unkept hair, the expressionless stare in his face.  Along with that flat apathy, however, was a spike of energy in the center, the resentment at being called away from what <i>did</i> interest him.  That spike flared up briefly, making the Hyacinth aware of the impending outburst before he began to speak audibly.<br><br>“Did you call me away from my RC to actually talk to me, or were just planning on letting me sit here staring at your aquarium until my next mission?” demanded agent Paul.<br><br><i>I may just do that, if only to see if it improves your performance on it.</i><br><br>Paul scoffed—the Flower felt it as the spike of resentment flaring up, pointing directly at her mind this time.  “My performance does NOT need any improvement.”<br><br><i>On the contrary, agent Paul, Legal has sent me several displeased memos detailing inconsistencies in some of your recent charge lists.</i><br><br>“Enlighten me.”<br><br><i>Simply put, you are charging Sues and Trolls with charges that are</i> not <i>charges.</i><br><br>“Bullcrap.  I see a mistake, I point it out.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.”<br><br><i>Well, let&#39;s just take a look at some of these . . . mistakes, shall we?</i>  A laminated sheet of paper that had been floating in the water on the Hyacinth&#39;s left side floated closer to her.  <i>It seems that three missions ago, you charged a Misty replacement with &#39;having a Dewgong use Icy Wind.&#39;</i><br><br>“The fic was set in the first generation.  Icy Wind didn&#39;t exist back then.”<br><br><i>The date has the fic being written after the Icy Wind move was released.</i><br><br>Confusion—like bubbles drifting out of Paul&#39;s mind—drifted into the Hyacinth&#39;s perception.  “It doesn&#39;t matter!”<br><br><i>You also charged that same replacement with &#39;still only having a Wartortle.&#39;</i><br><br>“All her other Pokйmon evolved in the mid-level thirties.  The Wartortle was the only one that didn&#39;t follow suit, even though it evolves at level thirty-six.”<br><br><i>I&#39;m given to understand that trainers can have their Pokйmon wait to evolve.</i><br><br>“What idiot would do that?”  Paul made a spitting noise with his lips.  “Certainly not a gym leader.”<br><br><i>On a similar note, this last mission, you charged a Sue—Kamanita Tohjo—with &#39;having a Monferno use Flame Wheel at level fourteen.&#39;</i><br><br>“It happened right after it evolved from Chimchar,” Paul explained.  “Chimchar evolves at fourteen, and Monferno doesn&#39;t learn Flame Wheel until nineteen.”<br><br><i>I think that was just a bit of artistic license.</i><br><br>“Well, it&#39;s not acceptable.”<br><br>The Floating Hyacinth said nothing to this.<br><br>After a few moments of silence, Paul went on.  “<i>Pokйmon</i> is all about numbers.  If authors can&#39;t get the details right, I&#39;m going to charge them for it.”<br><br><i>The</i> Pokйmon <i>anime frequently plays fast and loose with all of that and more.</i><br><br>“Well, the anime is stupid.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t accept it as canon.”<br><br><i>Your job, agent—our job—is to enforce that canon.  Not to enforce piddling details from strategy guides.</i><br><br>The Hyacinth could feel Paul&#39;s irritation swelling—that one spike of resentment was swiftly being joined by others.  “That&#39;s what the canon is!  That&#39;s how it works!”  He stood up and slammed his hands palms down onto the desk.  “Why isn&#39;t Vania here?  She was on these missions; she should be getting chewed out too!”<br><br><i>I am well aware of who writes the charge lists when you and your partner are in the</i> Pokйmon <i>continuum, agent.  In fact, Vania has requested more missions into musicals and other stage productions lately.  I think I&#39;ll honor that request for a while, see if some time away from</i> Pokйmon <i>improves your judgment when collecting charges.</i><br><br>Paul sneered.  “At least make it other video games.  I have no interest in wasting my time on any dorky crap like that.”<br><br><i>You WILL do your job as instructed, agent.</i>  The Floating Hyacinth&#39;s mental presence suddenly flooded around Paul&#39;s mind, making her intentions very clear indeed.  <i>Or you can transfer to All-Purpose and let Legal bother the Foxglove Official about your shenanigans.  Better yet, go home, and save the whole PPC the trouble.</i><br><br>The frustrated spikes representing Paul&#39;s thoughts abated for just a bit, replaced with uncertainty.  “You wouldn&#39;t send me back.  You&#39;re too understaffed.”<br><br><i>Let me assure you, an agent of your caliber can and will be replaced.  With ease.</i><br><br>The spikes returned, ballooning into a full spiny ball of fury.  Paul grabbed at the desk, barely restraining himself from trying to flip it.  He spun around, and finding the chair blocking his way, lashed out with his leg and kicked it over and across the floor.  Then he marched out of the room and through the Hyacinth&#39;s door.</p>

            <p>I really enjoyed both of these stories.<br><br>The &quot;late for an important event&quot; fic put me in mind of both Lovecraft and a horror tabletop RPG called <i>Deadlands</i>. The juxtaposition of the people in the study and Tabitha running through the streets was very well done. Each of the characters had some little detail about themselves presented to the reader: Edward never smiles, Ophelia&#39;s arthritis, and so on. I assume Tabitha is the planned-out character?<br><br>The &quot;responding to criticism&#39; fic strikes me as something that could stand in the PPC all by itself. Not only could, but should. We don&#39;t typically see the kinds of agents who adhere so strictly to one version of the canon; agents that considered even the slightest deviation for the purposes of entertainment wrong. It&#39;s an interesting concept that I really want to see more done with.<br><br>I like the back-and-forth between the Hyacinth and Paul. It&#39;s sharp and to the point.<br><br>One minor thing: &quot;...the things with the red eyes that glowed in the night&quot; struck me as being a bit awkward in its structure. If she can see that the eyes are red at night, doesn&#39;t that already indicate that they&#39;re glowing?<br><br>I hope my tips and prompts helped you get a tighter grip on your characters. Nice work!</p>

            <p>(And also sorry for posting after the topic has rolled off the front page.  I know it&#39;s semi-frowned upon, but after spending most of my work shifts this past week working on these, I wanted to show something for it.)<br><br>I pulled a rather stupid on that first prompt.  I really should have posted a note on that one, because it does indeed take place (partly) in the Lovecraft universe, and the ghouls are the canon ones from the same.  So, uh, those belong to Lovecraft.  &gt;_&gt;  And yes, Tabitha is the future agent there.<br><br>Paul is basically an antagonist in Vania&#39;s past.  He&#39;ll show up a bit in flashbacks.  He is not a nice guy, not a very good PPC agent, but not actually evil, either.  Just a bit . . . tunnel visioned.<br><br>Now for another!  I had this character designed as a one-of with no real backstory; just an experiment with putting an over-the-top, grandiose 60s comic villain into a protagonist&#39;s role as an agent.  When I started writing this . . . man, there was a WHOLE WORLD lurking just behind him.  I may need to write more there now!<br><br><i>has suffered some momentary setback . . .</i><br><br>Even those as great as I must still suffer through the occasional moment of ignominy!  What matters is using them as steps towards a greater purpose.  As an example, let me speak of one particular crime I committed on my home world; some time before Doctor Dimensional&#39;s experimentation led to my current station as a PPC agent.<br><br>There I stood, in the lobby of the biggest bank in Metroburg City; Master Maximus, resplendent in my usual costume.  Great white boots and gloves, to represent the power I wielded against the world, and to show how it dirtied me whenever I interacted with it!  My purple suit—the color of royalty, for when one is Master, others must learn to recognize that Mastery at a glance!  My black crown and tie, to indicate my absolute dominion over the common—”<br><br>What?  Yes, I&#39;m well aware it&#39;s the same thing I&#39;m wearing right now.  I&#39;m describing myself to set the scene in Metroburg First National, to help understand why the employees and other citizens there that day were cowering before me, shivering on the floor on ducked behind their little desks.  My regalia was only part of it, however; in addition to my intimidating costume, I had brought along a very particular sort of device, shaped more like a box than a proper laser gun.  I had nonetheless bluffed the tellers into surrendering the collection of gold bars housed inside the banks&#39; vaults.  I say bluffed, you see, because my plan and the machine were both useless until after I had secured the gold.<br><br>Once I obtained my prize, however, I explained to the sniveling peasants around me that my device was a fear ray, then demonstrated its purpose.  I dropped several bars of gold inside the aperture in the top, and it radiated a shockwave of blue energy.  Well, of course, the crowd cowered away.  (You can&#39;t spell “cowered” without “crowd,” after all.)  I began to make a show of throwing gold into the machine, loudly proclaiming that the city outside those walls was degenerating under a fugue of terror.<br><br>As I had expected, a band of the so-called “superheroes” who constantly trouble my efforts eventually arrived on the scene.  Fortunately, my arch nemesis, La Desperada, was absent that day.  I had only to deal with some of the lesser pests: the Pauper Prince, a mere street brawler in patched-up rags; Mr. Fugu, an old fishmonger who utilized toxic balloon fish to—even I must admit—ingenious purpose; and Pixel Staff, the only one with any real sort of power.<br><br>They entered through a back window; I had intentionally come alone to ensure unguarded access to the bank.  Mr. Fugu said something in Chinese, and I responded by announcing my fear ray plot, then making a big show of dropping the last bricks of gold inside it.<br><br>Pixel Staff and the Pauper hesitated, wondering if unnatural fear was already seizing control of their hearts.  Mr. Fugu, however, charged at me (I always assumed he could understand English.  Perhaps not?), wielding a wooden pole with balloon fish at either end, dried and preserved to deadly solidity.  I easily blocked his blows with the wind pulse generators in my gloves.  The other two heroes quickly joined us.  We skirmished; I won&#39;t bore you with the details.<br><br>Eventually, one of Pixel Staff&#39;s 8-bit fireballs hit my machine (I had allowed myself to be driven away from it, you see).  It was obliterated in a blue, electrical flash . . . Now that I think about it, the floor tiles underneath the machine vanished along with it . . . At the time, I assumed they had simply been destroyed in the explosion, but knowing what I do now about plotholes and the true nature of Doctor Dimensional&#39;s experimentation . . . Interesting!<br><br>But back to my tale!  After the destruction of my device, I gave a bit of the old “Curses!” and the “How can this be?” for the heroes&#39; sakes.  The MCPD then entered and led me away in chains.<br><br>Failure?  It may sound as such to a lesser individual, I suppose.  But there are as many ways out of Metroburg prison as there are in.  Being arrested was only a temporary setback—a delay, really, which I had practically planned for anyway.  It made for an excellent distraction, a satisfactory ending to the scene.  No one suspected the true epilogue: you see, when I got out, I had waiting for me at home all those gold bars the teleporter had sent there.</p>

            <p><i>going through their morning routine . . .</i><br><br>She awoke to pitch darkness.  She slid her body through the contours of her rough, stone shell, wriggling her tentacles as they exited the shell&#39;s opening into the light of the room outside.  She dabbled the tips of the tentacles in the salty water filling her home, a blue plastic pool meant for human children to play in.<br><br>Her movement in the water made small waves splash against the scales of the wading pool&#39;s other occupant.  “Karp!” he said, waking up.  “Magikarp!”<br><br>A couple of yards away, their trainer sat on a bean bag chair on the floor, playing on a Game Boy Advance.  When he heard their voices, he put the game down and got up to walk to the pool.  “Good morning, Magikarp!” he said, smiling.  “Good morning, Omanyte!”<br><br>The trainer pulled two small bottles from a little cardboard box next to the pool and sprinkled fish flakes and hermit crab feed into the water for his two Pokйmon.  Magikarp swam to one pile of flkaes and began repeatedly opening his mouth next to it, letting water pour in and pull the food with it.  Omanyte reached out with her tentacles and began pulling the little pieces of crab food into the mouth at the center of her ring of tentacles.<br><br>While they ate, their trainer rubbed Omanyte&#39;s shell and Magikarp&#39;s head, watching them.  Omanyte could still feel him petting her through her shell, even though it was made of fossilized rock.  Omanyte and Magikarp loved their trainer.  He always took care of them; feeding, cleaning, or just paying attention.  The Pokйmon even got to go on missions with him and his partner a lot, since they mostly went to the <i>Pokйmon</i> universe.<br><br>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!<br><br>Omanyte withdrew back into her shell as the noise started, and Magikarp flailed around in the water.  Their trainer tried to calm them with whispered words while his partner moaned and got out of bed.  She walked over the large computer that gave them missions and hit a large button to stop the sound.<br><br>“Good morning,” she said quietly.<br><br>After a few moments, the trainer grunted in response while he got up.  He crossed to the equipment rackfor the Pokй Balls his Pokйmon stayed in.<br><br>“Sorry, Paul,” said Vania.  “This is a <i>Hairspray</i> mission.  No Pokйmon today.”<br><br>Paul spun around and glared at Vania.  “That stupid Hyacinth!  How does she expect me to level up my Pokйmon if she keeps sending me to these namby-pamby emotional worlds where I can&#39;t battle anything?”<br><br>Vania sighed.  “I really doubt she cares, Paul.  Leveling up Pocket Monsters isn&#39;t her job.”  She looked at him over her shoulder and narrowed her eyes.  “Or yours.”<br><br>Paul walked over and stood over the seated Vania.  “I decide what I do with my life.  No one else.”  he slowly reached over her shoulder to hit the portal button.<br><br>After the humans left, Magikarp began to swim in distressed circles.  But Omanyte stayed calm.  She knew Paul would be back soon.  He was never very nice to his partner, but he was always nice to his Pokйmon.<br><br>And they loved him very much.<br><br><i>helping a friend with a favor . . .</i><br><br>Somewhere inside PPC HQ—it&#39;s useless to give directions; just don&#39;t think about it—is a game room to put even Chuck E. Cheese&#39;s playlands to shame.  Skiball, mini basketball hoops (not to be confused with any species of mini), sit-in racing games and shooting games with built-in plastic guns.  (The very large ball pit was frequently closed due to damages sustained from violence perpetrated therein.)  A hallway to the left (or sometimes right) led to the console party games.  Another hallway (usually to the right, but sometimes left) led to the arcade.<br><br>Classic machines--<i>Pacman</i>, <i>Primal Rage</i>, <i>Dr. Mario</i> . . . and the pinball machines.  A collection spanning the histories of multiple worlds, with licensed themes both known and unknown to World One.  There were rare, out-of-production tables, some acquired from unpublished continua.  Wooden machines from the eighteenth century.  Tables from alternate universes bearing bizarre magitech, clockwork and biologically augmented technology.  Even a copy of SCP-1825 in a side room of steel-reinforced generic surface, that only admitted one player at a time.<br><br>With such a span of complexity, frequent shutdowns were inevitable.  DoSAT understandably disliked dedicating time to repairing leisure devices, and so, repairs boiled down to whatever the attendant agents could manage.<br><br>They couldn&#39;t always manage—as in the case of the <i>Humpty Dumpty</i>.  The model was the first pinball table to include flippers operated electrically rather than manually.<br><br>But today, the machine had no power.<br><br>Regular players and a small cluster of arcade attendants gathered around the antique device.  The battery was freshly purchased and portalled in from the late 1940s, and should have had a full charge.  Yet no lights lit, no buzzers buzzed.  The machine would dispense no pinballs upon insertion of a nickel.<br><br>An attendant unlocked the front of the case, but neither the coins nor the balls were jammed.  Some of the stronger players gently tilted he machine first one way, then another.  But no change came.  It seemed that all the attendants and all arcadesmen couldn&#39;t get <i>Humpty</i> back working again.<br><br>Whispers began from the back of the crowd, by the entrance from the main game room.  The crowd began to part as something approached the group immediately near <i>Humpty Dumpty</i>.  As the something drew near, the whispers became more coherent.<br><br>“<i>It&#39;s the wizard.</i>”<br><br>“<i>The wizard!</i>”<br><br>He had a long white beard and dark, sun-tanned skin.  He wore spectacles and a pointy black hat.  His robes were purple, with game-related symbols covering them—video game icons, the suites of playing cards, chess pieces.  He wore a tie, shaped like a flipper from a pinball table.<br><br>The attendants stood aside to make way for their most frequent and dedicated patron.  He stepped up to <i>Humpty Dumpty</i>.  He skipped all the tests previously performed by others—if the fix was easy, it would have already been done.  Instead, he peered down through the glass at the playing field.<br><br>Beneath the bumpers and flippers, he saw the familiar images.  At the bottom, multicolored stars next to holes denoting different point values.  Humpty Dumpty himself balanced next to the 10,000-point hole.  Higher up, near the top of the machine, the images of two armored, mounted knights appeared ready to begin jousting, lances held at the ready.  The right-side knight&#39;s horse was draped in a red and gold cloth, looking like a member of Gryffindor house.  The left-side knight could have been standing for Slytherin, except that his horse wore green and gold, not quite completing the coincidence.<br><br>The left-side knight also sported a tail.<br><br>The wizard moved around to the left side of the machine and tapped very gently on the glass just above the green knight.  “Come out of there,” he said.  “There are people waiting to play.”<br><br>Flying out of the cartoon drawing came the form of a mini-Discord.  It passed directly through the glass screen, laughed and disappeared in a puff of smoke.  (One agent present would later discover his toenails had been painted bleen.)<br><br>The wizard turned and left through a cheering and applauding crowd of PPC agents.  He didn&#39;t smile.  He had planned on staying to play, but now he only wanted to leave.<br><br>The called him the “Pinball Wizard.”  Well, he certainly enjoyed pinball.  Was rather good at it, he had to admit.<br><br>But the miniature Draconequus&#39; magical antics had reminded him once again that he was no true wizard.<br><br>(<i>Pokйmon</i> belongs to Nintendo and Game Freak.  Discord belongs to Lauren Faust and Hasbro.  SCP-1825 belongs to . .  someone named Fantem, apparently.)</p>

            <p>This is a really helpful, coherent guide on character-writing! Thank you for putting it together, these are really useful suggestions. I was going to start replying to the challenge, but I&#39;ve got mostly NaNoWriMo characters bouncing around my head right now, and the remaining Starships &amp; Sorcery ideas are unlikely to wind up as agents. I may put the whole thing down in Google Drive for reference in further writing, though, if you don&#39;t mind - it&#39;s an awesome reference for character-building in any &#39;verse.</p>

            <p>“Pygmalion!”<br><br>The old man looked up from the battered hardback edition of <i>Hermione Granger and the Inter-Species Treaty</i>. “Androia,” he croaked, “I didn’t hear you knock.”<br><br>“Your hearing is getting as bad as your eyesight,” shouted Androiaavata, shoving the door shut with her heel while she still kept her eyes on the man. “Plug your device in! I yelled enough at you while we were partners, I don’t need to continue this!”<br><br>“It’s nice to have some quite while reading.” The ex-agent fumbled for the ear plugs of his hearing aid. “Now, what are you doing here?” he inquired. “When I retired, I didn’t expect to see you ever again.”<br><br>“I was busy with all this Hermione Granger badfic and a new partner who doesn’t have a clue. But didn’t you imagine that I am kind at heart? I cannot just abandon you, that’s not how you made me.”<br><br>The wheel-chair creaked as the old man, whose name was not Pygmalion, moved uncomfortably. “Lots of what I imagined never came true,” he muttered.   <br><br>Androia stepped forward and cowered to meet his gaze at eye level. “This is because you allowed your dark side to take over your imagination. You tried to occupy me, and I couldn’t have this. But you also gave me the strength to fight back. And after all we’ve gone through together, you’re a kind of friend. I got a day off and came here to do you a favor.” For the first time, the old man smiled. Never before had she called him a friend. And he was not blind yet. Of course he had noticed that she was not wearing the black uniform. So this was not just a two minutes visit between assignments. <br><br>The young woman stretched, stepped aside and swirled around to make her long skirt fly. “How do I look? Good enough for taking you out?” <br><br>“Get yourself a mirror, there’s no sense in asking me. Since I created you, I would never admit that you are less than perfect – in any aspect. So what’s the plan?“  <br><br>Androia’s face went blank for a moment, but then the ‘any aspect’ got to her, and she broke into a broad smile. “The movie comes out tonight,” she said, winking at the book in her friends lap. “We’ll go to the cinema.”<br><br>“That’s not a favor,” grumbled the old man. “You know that I never liked any of these movies.”<br><br>“I know that you want to see it anyway, so you can rant about what they got all wrong this time.” Androia grabbed the wheel-chair’s handlebar. “Let’s have some fun and spork the hell out of them!”<br><br>_________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Author’s notes: <br>Like Joanne K. Rowling, I wrote the epilogue in advance, so that I know where I want to take these two. Now I have to write them an origin story which is better than: <i>In an AU, Bad!Hieronymus snatched Androiaavata out of the </i>World of Warcraft<i> realm where he had created her. She lived with him, because she had no other place to go, but it was not quite like he had imagined it. In an attempt to overcome his frustration, Bad!Hieronymus wrote <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=248493;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=50">fanfiction</a> about how it <b>should</b> have been. Unfortunately he had told Androia that he intended to write them both into the PPC, so she looked it up and she wasn’t <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=248550;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=50">enthused</a>. Then they both fell through a plothole and <b>were</b> in the PPC.</i><br><br>Since they still aren’t in the PPC and I don’t even have permission, I don’t know which date ‘ten years hence’ is based off. I assume this may happen in about 2030 HST.<br><br>I deliberately avoided to show where this happens, because I don’t know this either. Is there a retirement home for agents in New Caledonia?  </p>

            <p>The overall tone between the two agents seems pretty casual despite their not apparently having seen each other in some time and not being on spectacular terms. Plus, the paragraph that starts &quot;Androia stepped forward...&quot; feels a bit too expository; something of an &#39;as you already know&#39; moment.<br><br>Still, the characters seem interesting and I like that you started with the ending first.

            <p>I&#39;ve never been good about using prompts—I like to RP to flesh out new characters when possible—but these are pretty good ones. Not only do you have to think about how the character would behave in the situations listed, you have to think of what the character would consider an important event, or a setback, or criticism, or worth doing as a favor or first thing in the morning. Even if I don&#39;t get around to writing anything down, I&#39;ll be thinking about these for a while. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Not exactly what I was looking for when I asked for someone&#39;s &#39;morning routine,&#39; as Hieronymus mentioned. Still, did you find this useful? Did you learn anything about your character by writing this?<br><br>Also, one quibble. Luxury seems somewhat out of character considering her background and past appearances. She&#39;s been serving as a Bad Slash agent since 2001 HST. I can&#39;t believe that she&#39;s so dim as to not know what a TARDIS is. But maybe that&#39;s just my take on her.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it helped. It evolved from &#39;morning routine&#39; to &#39;morning not!routine&#39; while I was writing it, and lots of stuff just popped up - The Librarian hating being touched, the fact that his tablet has an admittedly unimaginative name and can speak, his manner of speech...<br>Also, re: Lux: there&#39;s no specific point of time for this... quibble? so it might as well be from, Iunno, 2001 HST or whatever.

            <p>Yes, Time Lords sleep.<br>&quot;Tablet&quot; is indeed the tablet&#39;s name - I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s sentient, has an AI, or just has automated voice functions.<br>Obviously, falling through a plothole into HQ and being glomped by Lux is not part of the Librarian&#39;s morning routine, which mainly consists of stumbling from the library to his bed (he&#39;s a night owl with a tendency to stay up all night researching things and sleep at day... unless he&#39;s needed by his compatriots, that is).</p>

            <p>It looks good though. I&#39;m trying to cut down on caffeine, so fruit teas are a great alternative. :)<br>I tried to see if they had a goodfic tea blend, but they didn&#39;t.

            <p>I currently have these on my shelf:<br><br>Blood Orange (Herbal) - Very sweet and smooth, almost silky.<br><br>Dancong Aria (Black) - This is the best tea I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Although it&#39;s just black tea leaves, it&#39;s so complex you get hints of other things in it, like grapefruit. It has a great aroma and a finish that sticks with you a while. This tea taught me to recognize flat, boring, one-note crap for what it is. I am forever spoiled.<br><br>Earl Grey Lavender (Black) - Nice and smooth, a little sweet; but the lavender is quite strong. I like to combine it with another Earl Grey.<br><br>Forest Berries (Black) - I really like this. It&#39;s great if you want something more than just plain black tea without getting too fancy.<br><br>Gunpowder (Green) - Very strong green tea. Great if you like that.<br><br>Irish Breakfast (Black) - Okay; not very strong for a breakfast blend. Fine on its own, but if you want to add sugar and milk, it doesn&#39;t hold up too well.<br><br>Jasmine Yin Hao (Green) - I love jasmine, but this will kick you in the teeth if you oversteep it.<br><br>Masala Chai (Black) - A solid, simple mix of spices, but a bit harsh for me. Not sure if it&#39;s the tea or the spices.<br><br>---<br><br>I also recommend the fandom blends of Cara McGee. I&#39;ve tried a few of her <i>Harry Potter</i> and <i>Sherlock</i> blends, and I can&#39;t think of one I hated.<br><br>~Neshomeh, hopefully-not-snobby tea connoisseur.</p>

But did you really understand it?</i> [. . .] <i>This is the kind of image that got Frances taken off Kurt and Courtney in the first place</i> [. . .] <i>It’s not even like he was someone in a book or a movie – Kurt Cobain was a real person, depressed, maybe, drugged, sometimes, but not deserving of this defamation of his character. And as for what you’ve done to Courtney . . . well, yeah, maybe Courtney wasn’t meek and mild, but she wasn’t like this. And you have to accept that they loved each other. Maybe it wasn’t some Elizabeth and Mr Darcy or Romeo and Juliet written-in-the-stars thing, but they chose each other and you have NO RIGHT to talk about their personal life like you know what was going on.</i>&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s a bit of an extreme example, to be sure, but the main point is still there.  Just as the PPC doesn&#39;t flame authors--because hurting the feelings of real people lies far outside the realm of literary critique--neither do we want to imply knowledge of others&#39; private thoughts and personalities and present it as fact.  That, too, could lead to hurt feelings and a misrepresentation being taken as true.</p>

            <p>...that by &quot;allow RPF&quot; you mean &quot;Why we don&#39;t spork bad RPFs.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s a bit complicated, but I think the biggest factor is that the entire concept of the RPF is kinda weird to begin with. We base our humour on pointing out inconsistencies with a canon work and raging at the sight of mangled masterworks. We can&#39;t really reproduce that effect with fics that deal with real-life people. I mean, Real Life doesn&#39;t have canon, right? Furthermore, it feels really odd to write dialogue for someone who&#39;s... well, real and alive. It&#39;s almost like putting words in their mouth. </p>

            <p>Now, for a very long time, I&#39;ve been thinking and writing snippets for a Harry potter Fanfic that takes place in a universe slightly different from the original universe and events in Real Life, with a Point of Divergence earlier than 1970.  If this is too implausible, feel free to call me out.<br><br>Now according to HP-canon, Voldermort&#39;s reign of terror began in 1970, and I am wondering if its plausible that when he meant Wizarding World, it mean Britain or Europe?  Could North America have been excluded from the terror?  <br><br>So the story goes that one Paul Samuel Greengrass was a friend of James Potter and Sirius Black prior to Hogwarts, though a few years older than Potter or Black.  The Greengrass family is traditionally Slytherin or Ravenclaw, though many members in the 20th Century had left Britain, disillusioned by the backwardness of Magical Britain.  In Hogwarts, since Paul was in Slytherin, he became an unofficial Maurader, becoming their inside man within the Snakes;  after several years, he gradually became a friend of Remus Lupin.  However, because Peter Pettigrew was considered a loose talker and might spill about Greengrass, the Rat was left out of the Loop about Paul.  <br><br>After graduation, Paul have had enough the Purebloods and their views having, suffered seven years of listening to their bigotry, and followed the path of relatives by immigrating to Canada.  Soon after, he enlisted within a Magical Branch of the Canadian Forces and by 1980, he had fought tooth and nail to join a covert ops unit based on the SAS, called the Canadian Special Magic Service.<br><br>In Britain, Midnight on October 31, 1981, after Harry is attacked by Voldemort, Dumbledore was contacted by Paul (informed by a friend within Canadian intelligence about the deaths of James and Lily), who then convinces Albus that Sirius and Remus could not be the traitors.  That causes Dumbledore to think carefully and realize that no one was keeping tabs on Pettigrew. When Sirius arrives at Godric&#39;s Hollow, Dumbledore manages to smack some sense in a sobbing Sirius just before he could leave and confront Peter.  Dumbledore then tells Sirius to contact Paul, knowing about the secret friendship between James, Sirius, Remus and Paul.  Paul, calling in many favours, arranges for Sirius and Harry to leave Britain quietly, and helps them settle down in British Columbia, near where Paul and his new family is living.  Canadian Officials interrogate Sirius and clear him of any links to Voldemort&#39;s Terrorist Group.<br><br>Remus is later found by Paul and is later reunited with Sirius and Harry.  By 1988, Paul had left military service and joined the Canadian Magical Intelligence Service, along with Sirius and Remus, the trio enduring piles of paperwork and the occasional field assignment.  Throughout the 80s, Harry is raised up by Sirius and his girlfriend-and-later wife, a Canadian Witch who teaches Kindergarten at a school for Magicals.  Harry becomes a childhood friend of Daphne Greengrass (no, I will not be pairing anyone until Harry is 16 or 17, so none of that silly shipping like in other fanfics), with both being raised up on Star Trek: TNG, Star Wars, Mister Rogers Neighborhood, Hockey Night in Canada, and other contemporary shows.  Harry is rather impulsive, and ever so often gets in trouble in school for beating down bullies, often leading to long chats between Sirius and Harry, with Sirius wanting to get Harry to gain self-control and not follow his own example.  Daphne also gets into some trouble for various revenge pranks, though being raised by a Slytherin helps her get away with most of them.<br><br>Then I hit writer&#39;s Block as I wonder if I should keep them in the Magical Canada&#39;s public education system or put them on a one year exchange at Hogwarts.<br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ll be plain here and say that I don&#39;t particuarly like it. That won&#39;t stop me from trying to help you but the idea is fairly overused IMO, as it seems to consist of &quot;Take Harry out of England. Put him wherever author comes from. Show that Author&#39;s country is way better on the magical side than Britain is. Have Harry beat the **** out of Voldemort/Dumbledore/Britain in General because of the awesomeness of Author&#39;s country. Go home have tea and cake (or regional variants).&quot; Like I said, this seems to be the general idea/basic plan that happens, most often done by Americans (no offence intended) who then display America as this great shining light that has no underage magic restrictions, isn&#39;t bound by the ICW, etc. etc. (FYI this isn&#39;t just my patriotism speaking, I&#39;ve beaten the **** out of Magical Britain in one of my fics(as awful as it was)). <br><br>If you&#39;re going to do this sort of fic properly you need to make it work in several ways. One is the correct connection between the characters who takes Harry and leaves England and, well, Harry. I&#39;ve seen this done with Sirius and Remus and work best although a well written OC/minor character/slightly major character if its a crossover can do well once again if they have the right reasons. Ignoring the latter (because from what you&#39;ve said this is a straight HP story) you&#39;ve gone for someone in between the two, who also manages to be a Fifth Marauder (something I&#39;m never comfortable with unless it&#39;s Lily) and saves Sirius from Azkaban. <br><br>Personally I think you&#39;re reasons for Paul to leave Britain are sketchy (I&#39;ll come to Paul the name later), he&#39;s an upcoming Heir/Head of his house in all likelihood, and unless he&#39;s like Sirius (whereby he&#39;s the only &#39;good&#39; guy in the family and that&#39;s highly unlikely due to the circles he seems to be in from his friendship with James) he&#39;ll probably have some support in his family, a family that would in all likelihood stay in Britain else the whole of House Greengrass would move, pretty much removing them from the story at this point. <br><br>Now for the name. In a world where most purebloods (James seems to be an exception or more likely a shortened form of something like Jameson) are named something along the lines of Lucius, Sirius, Regulus, Theodore, Rudolphus, Abraxius,Fabian etc. Paul seems way too much like a common name compared to them, hell even Snape has more of a pureblood name than Paul despite being a half-blood.      <br><br>Anyway back to the plan. So we have a foreign soldier (effectively) who hasn&#39;t been seen or heard from in X years, who&#39;s family is the sort ho would support Voldemort (most likely) that contacts Dumbledore and tries to convince him that Sirius and Remus aren&#39;t traitors that&#39;s fairly sketchy by itself. Now in the grand scheme of things the night of October the 31st 1981 has a fairly uniform timeline after Voldemort dies. Sirius is the first on the scene, followed shortly after by Hagrid. The time it takes for information to travel (even by magic) wouldn&#39;t be fast enough for &#39;Paul&#39; to contact Dumbledore, to get to Godric&#39;s Hollow to stop Sirius chasing Pettigrew. If you want to stop Sirius getting thrown in jail then your best bet would be to scrap what happened that night and have Dumbledore raise the points at Sirius&#39; trial after he gets caught. However that raises the problem of Harry being at the Dursley&#39;s for X days, but if you then could throw in some sort of way for Sirius to claim Harry once he is found innocent in the trial and then for Harry to be collected from the Dursleys then all well and good. <br><br>Unfortunately for your plan this leaves &#39;Paul&#39; and Sirius (and thereby Harry) in 2 different countries. How you connect them up I don&#39;t know, especially as you&#39;ve also got to consider that by this point &#39;Paul&#39; must have a wife with a daughter (Daphne) of one/two year(s) old (roughly) and dependent on where you put Astoria potentially another child on the way. The best way I can see of connecting the two would be to have Sirius move to a Black property in America (a leftover from before the revolution say or if you don&#39;t mind making America more like Britain, a place bought X generations back, although this would depend on America being a suitable place for pureblood families such as the Blacks moving to at least for holidays.) Then having the two meet up somehow (once again up to you really).<br><br>Finding Remus is a nice touch but I think logistically it&#39;d be a nightmare, maybe not even worth the effort.        <br><br>Growing up, would be interesting however I don&#39;t think all the pop culture should be integrated into it, some maybe but don&#39;t have them living as muggles or having technology work fine around them, I feel it&#39;s almost like trying to brag or bring your own upbringing into the story.<br><br>In answer to your last point, there is a very simple way of answering it. Have them as full time Hogwarts Students. How? Simple, there&#39;s a book at Hogwarts that records the name of every witch or wizard born in Britain so that they attend Hogwarts, having Harry and Daphne born in Britain means that they go to school in Britain, tying in nicely with the plots from the books themselves, and not forcing them to have one year to solve everything if they had just one transfer year. Another added bonus is that you can use Hogwarts and its students rather than having to make up your own school and characters for all the staff and students for said school, something that is not only challenging but can also make a fic bad if not done right.<br><br>I&#39;d say as to where to go from there, maybe put Harry in a house other than Gryffindor, Slytherin would work as he wouldn&#39;t have the prejudice from the books or maybe Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff. From there go on as you want but at least keep most events from canon in, although say you could avoid the Troll event at Halloween (after all even if it happens it&#39;s unlikely to have anything to do with Harry or Daphne.)<br><br>Hope I&#39;ve been a help, and once again sorry if I&#39;ve offended/insulted anyone or any of their works both in Fan and Original Fiction<br>Storme Hawk<br><br>P.S. Make sure to include at least one Python reference ;P      </p>

            <p>Thank you for your honesty, Storme Hawke.  I really appreciate your candid advice.  Is there anyway to email you for other advice?<br><br>Now, the Magical Community in Canada will have its fair share of internal issues, but to be honest, it pales in comparison to what we saw in Britain within the HP-canon.  There are recriminations over the treatment of First Nations, plus there are sharp arguments between Canada and the United States.  In my story, there is quite a few more Magicals in Canada than in the United States, due to the discrimination of Wizards and Witches in America dating back to the Puritans and the Salem Witch Trials.  There is also some issues within Quebec, where there are families that still have the mindset of Royalist France.  There are age restrictions, banning the use of Magic in Non-Magical Areas like Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal.  While accidental magic is tolerated, wand waving is a big no no for anywhere with people that don&#39;t know of Magic. <br><br>The Canadian Department of Magical Affairs is a founding member of the ICW, and the Canadian Government is obligated to follow ICW resolutions, though that doesn&#39;t mean covert ops is off the Table.  Based on the Parliamentary System, they have a Legislature and a Senate, and occasionally there are calls for abolish the senate.  <br><br>Paul(maybe short for Paulus) is the son of Jeremiah Greengrass, who is the head of the family.  Jeremiah circa the 70s had been a fence sitter, though slightly towards the plight of non-Purebloods.  Their family has had a variety of people supporting opposite sides, with a distant relative or two dead while serving Voldemort.  Paul&#39;s family in 1974 (Paul was in 6th Year) was threatened by Death Eaters (who implied Torture if they didn&#39;t comply), leading to debate within the Family over staying or leaving.  Ultimately, the family, which had property in Canada, decided to leave, though Paul would finish one more year, and was given the choice to stay and help maintain the remaining family assets or join everyone else.  Basically, the bigotry just confirmed his intentions to move.  Unfortunately, some of their properties was bought out by the Malfoys and other supporters of Riddle.<br><br>Paul wasn&#39;t an official Maurader, lacking an animagi form, plus in the public he more or less ignored the Mauraders.  To maintain plausible dependability, Paul was affected by the more harmless pranks like getting his hair turned green or pretended to be in the bathrooms throwing up during more vengeful pranks by the Mauraders.  He knows about the Maurader&#39;s Map but cannot access it.  I&#39;ll take your advice, and have Harry be sent to the Dursleys for a few days, while Sirius was arrested.  Perhaps after the arrest, Dumbledore gets an earful from Paul, who insists that something was fishy about the arrest, and decides to reveal to Dumbledore the Animagi forms of James, Peter, and Sirius.  <br><br>Paul would remind Sirius that the family had property in Canada, a large cedar cabin build on 5 hectares of land bordering the Pacific coast, the land purchased back when British Columbia was a separate colony of Britain.  Located by the coastline, they do have floo connections for access to various places in Canada. <br><br>Now perhaps Remus, hearing of the acquittal of Sirius, might then move to Canada, with Remus getting some treatments to mitigate his transformation and long term health effects.<br><br>Harry and his friends in Canada will get some exposure to popular culture, though Magical Canada has its own stuff as well, with a limited form of TV (and for proper continuity, that is the old analog sets).<br><br>If Harry was going to Hogwarts, he&#39;ll either be Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, with a remote chance of Gryffindor.  He&#39;ll be decently smart, brave, and quite loyal.<br><br>Harry will still play some role against Voldemort, but I am planning to have Tom Riddle and his followers get most of their ass-kicking from the Magical Branch of the Canadian Forces.  I don&#39;t think Death Eaters know how to deal with infantry armed with automatic weapons and refurbished Centurion tanks.<br><br>Mikelima (aka mingli0777; forgot to change username)</p>

            <p>Now I&#39;m back in my own room...<br><br>It&#39;s good to see that you&#39;ve got a slightly gritty background for Canada. One problem I see however is that the ICW was formed sometime in the 1690&#39;s latest, whilst Canada was only formed in 1867. So it can&#39;t really be a founding country of the ICW if it wasn&#39;t even formed then. <br><br>Good to see a more in depth background over why the Greengrass&#39; leave, I&#39;ll assume that this could be seen as the main diverging point for your story with them in canon staying in Britain. Although how Paul marries and has two kids is still a mystery.<br><br>As Dawnfire correctly pointed out (and I forgot because a) I haven&#39;t read the books in a small while and b) I&#39;ve read way too many HP fanfics) Sirius doesn&#39;t actually get a trial, so working out how he get&#39;s given one could be interesting but doable. One extra thing I missed out from my first run through is that it would be more plausible to have Paul in the Magical Intelligence from the start rather than going through the army then the SAS style thing, it also makes a lot more sense that he would hear the news of Voldemort&#39;s demise then rather than hearing it from a &#39;friend&#39; (who you&#39;d really have to give more detail on). Anyway, if Dumbledore then pulls Sirius out of Azkaban, gives him a trial (it&#39;d last more than one day, mind and Paul would probably have to come back over to Britain to speak on Sirius&#39; defence). I don&#39;t see what revealing the animagi forms would do. Maybe that&#39;s just me though.<br><br>Once again my problem with Sirius moving to Canada is why? assuming that like the Greengrasses the Blacks have more than one property in England, then they probably wouldn&#39;t move into Grimmauld Place (can&#39;t remember if that&#39;s spelt right, so I&#39;m sorry for any Mini-Aragogs) but into another house the Blacks own. Besides potentially owing Paul one for helping him get out Sirius will have no obligation to move to Canada and even then, if you owe someone it&#39;s not like you&#39;ll move to be right next to them when you still have a place where you are. <br><br>Remus I&#39;m still not sure about. But that&#39;s just me, if you want him to be contacted by Sirius to help him raise Harry that&#39;s probably the best way to go. <br><br>Assuming Harry gets to Canada then yeah, the I suppose the old black and white TV sets would probably be the most advanced they&#39;d get. <br><br>Hogwarts, yeah I think that&#39;s probably a good idea, you&#39;ve then got to include Daphne into it, and all the canonical characters as well. Think how Snape, Draco, Ron etc. will react (within reason). <br><br>&quot;Harry will still play some role against Voldemort, but I am planning to have Tom Riddle and his followers get most of their ass-kicking from the Magical Branch of the Canadian Forces. I don&#39;t think Death Eaters know how to deal with infantry armed with automatic weapons and refurbished Centurion tanks.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve quoted the whole paragraph for a reason. I&#39;ve seen quite a few fics where muggle weaponry is used to obliterate the Death Eaters, and whilst yeah it&#39;s cool to use a tank to blow them apart you&#39;ve got to think about it and get it to work. As with most technological things I generally stick with the rule introduced by Harry Dresden in the Dresden Files, basically wizards can&#39;t use anything that&#39;s new than the 40&#39;s or 50&#39;s without it not really working for them, because I think it&#39;s a good rule and work well. This would mean that the upper limit of stuff the Canadian Magical service could use if they did use muggle weaponry would be from WW2, so yeah I suppose the Centurion could be used. One of the other things that comes up is the (relatively) simple Shield Charm and its variants. When cast in Canon it&#39;s been seen to at least stop Centaurs, Snatchers and even Hermione so it&#39;s not impossible to make the jump that if it can stop bodies as big as that it can also stop bullets, tank shells etc. Meaning that if two Death Eaters worked in tandem (one with a Shield Charm the other with say the Blasting Hex) they could easily blow up a tank without receiving any damage themselves. And against men, well the AK can kill them off whilst a Shield charm stops their weapons from doing the same. <br><br>In effect the only way to counteract wizards is to use wizards. I think the only real way of defeating Wizards through muggle means are long range bombardments and/or planes dropping bombs (but even then both have a Wizard counter (so long as a man on a broom could counter a plane)). Or Snipers, they could work quite well. <br><br>I hope I&#39;ve given you some things to think about. I&#39;ve certainly thought about the last point as I tried to do it for one of my fanfics before realizing the counters that could be taken.<br><br>Storme Hawk (The guy who spends way too much time reading Harry Potter fanfiction)      </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think Britain-style magicians would be that good at counteracting guns-armed special forces... because they simply know nothing about the Muggle world. I&#39;ll explain everything here, as I&#39;m knowledgeable both about Harry Potter and firearms<br><br>This excerpt from the third book (Daily Prophet&#39;s article about Sirius being on the loose) is a good example:<br><br>&quot;While Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse.&quot;<br><br>This means that most wizards don&#39;t even <i>know</i> what a gun is, let alone how it works. Besides, you make a worng assumption with the Shield Charm. Not only it requires a skilled mage and powerful hexes can break it, but your example takes into consideration the wrong paragon - with tank shells and rifle bullets we&#39;re talking about penetration power. A Centurion tank&#39;s shell, depending on fitted gun and loaded shells, can easily penetrate at least 150mm thick armor. Which means aty least fifteen centimeters, or six inches, of solid, tough steel. I really want to see a charm block that.<br><br>Also, assault rifles and most other modern guns are still purely mechanical, so they don&#39;t &quot;fizzle out&quot; with magic, as HP magic affects electronics. FN Herstal&#39;s P90 would be extremely effective against Death Eaters, thanks to its high rate of fire, accuracy, and penetration.<br><br>(Besides, a well-trained tank crew can still kill the two Death Eaters even if their Shield charms work against tank shells. Load high explosive shell, aim near their feet, shoot, proceed to next target.)<br><br>And we&#39;re not yet talking about tactics. Special Forces hve, as the name says, special training. If a Shield Charm stalls an operative... there&#39;s bound to be one who is going to maneuver and attack the Death Eaters from the side or the rear. And there&#39;s going to be snipers, too.<br><br>There&#39;s a reasons why wizards hide in their well-hidden communities. And it would is because if a muggle-wizard war breaks out, wizards wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a reason why wizards hide away from the Muggle world – but is it fear? I have always seen this as an act of humanity. It was the only way to make the Muggles forget that magic exists so that they would not longer burn each other.<br><br>It’s true that most British wizards don’t even know what a gun is. But most British Muggles are not allowed to have a gun. For the average wizard, the risk to be attacked by a gun-wielding Muggle is negligible. Ordinary wizards and witches don’t need to know anything about guns, just like they generally don’t need to know much about Muggle technology. <br><br>On the other hand, Death Eaters aren’t ordinary wizards, they are supposed to be Voldemort’s Special Forces, prepareing to take over the world – or at least Britain. I wouldn’t expect that they just stand in the line of fire not knowing what to do. The Death Eaters may have been too arrogant to learn anything about Muggle police and Muggle weapons, and they may be not smart enough to adapt their tactics when somebody shoots at them, but basing all the ass-kicking on this assumption would feel like a simple cope-out to me.<br><br>A wizard surprised by a sniper doesn’t stand a chance, but a well-armed soldier AK’ed by a sniping wizard also doesn’t stand a chance. In a classic dueling situation, everything depends on the Muggles ability to draw his gun and pull the trigger faster than the wizard can draw his wand and cast a spell to disarm or kill the gunslinger – which is obviously much more efficient than an attempt to deflect the bullet with a shield charm.<br><br>On the battle field, wizards could confund or imperio the soldiers to make them use all this awesome firepower to shoot each other rather than the wizards. Is it possible to vanish a tank? What happens when a tank’s gun is fired while the tank is levitated? For most spells used in the books the wizard needs to see the target and aim at it. But as every sniper knows, having a line of sight to the enemy shouldn’t mean that he can see and shoot you first.<br><br>Peter Pettigrew could blow up thirteen persons with one spell, so there seem to be spells of mass destruction that don’t need to be aimed carefully? Or the “gas explosion” wasn’t just a lie for the Muggles, and Wormtail did ignite an underground gas pipeline to cause this crater. May it then be possible to ignite a tank’s ammunition although the wizard cannot see the shells inside the tank like Wormtail couldn’t see this pipeline underground? Would it be necessary to see the tank?<br><br>There&#39;s a reason why the Death Eaters will be defeated by the <i><b>Magical Branch</b> of the Canadian Forces</i>, who know what they should expect and can take magical countermeasures. Muggle Special Forces wouldn’t even know what hit them. <br><br>An outright muggle-wizard war obviously couldn’t even happen if the Muggles weren’t, at least to a certain extent, aware of what magic can do, but I’m not so sure who would win. What I’m sure about is that it would be horrible and might destroy the world as we know it. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>In fact, my analysis was entirely from a Magical Brnch point of view - of course a smart wizard can use the suprise effect of magic on muggles at his advantage.</p>

            <p>Particularly about the difference between magic being able to interfere with <i>technology</i>, and just being able to interfere with <i>electricity</i>. <br><br>You also make a good point about the penetrating power of various projectiles, although I&#39;m not sure how relevant that is, given that the shields are magic - they could have a basically infinite capacity to absorb/deflect incoming energy. Personally, I would expect a bullet to be able to penetrate a Shield Charm, but I can&#39;t think of any comparable incident in the canon to actually base that on. <br><br>However, (from what I can remember) when they&#39;re in combat, wizards in <i>Harry Potter</i> don&#39;t just start off by casting a shield on themselves and having it protect them throughout the fight, they cast it in response to an attack. Given that Muggles now have automatic weapons... well, I&#39;d like to see a wizard try and cast a shield at a rate of 700 rounds a minute.<br><br>As for the tactics, yeah, even a squad of regular soldiers should be more than a match for an equal number of wizards. With big fights, the wizards always seemed to split off into seperate Wizard&#39;s Duals, whereas a squad of soldiers will have been trained to work together, provide support, and take out their targets. I simply can&#39;t see the wizards having the right mindset to fight effectively against actual military forces. <br><br>As you&#39;ve said, there&#39;s a reason that wizards hide away from the Muggle world - at that reason existed hundreds of years ago, when the most dangerous Muggles had were things like swords and crossbows. We&#39;ve got a whole lot more dangerous since then. </p>

            <p>Now while vehicles would likely be a generation or two behind the modern counterparts (for the early 90s Leopard C1 and C2 main battle tanks with 105mm cannon, and due to being an ATL this Canada is procuring ex-German Leopard 2A6s starting int the latter half of the 90s), Canada&#39;s infantry weapons, aside from surface to air missiles and possibly the M72 LAW, should not be affected by Magic.<br><br>By the mid 80ss, the real life Canadian was already replacing the C1 and C2 assault rifles (license built FN FALs) with the Diemaco C7 Rifle, an improved M16.  By the mid 90s, the C7A1 was introduced along with the C79 Optical Sight.  This sight wouldn&#39;t be affected by Magic as it uses Tritium for illumination, and I don&#39;t think Magic can affect nuclear physics.<br><br>As well, rifles typically fire rounds at supersonic velocities and contrary to some fanfics bullets don&#39;t leave a streak of light unless its a tracer round.

            <p>As someone who fired an M16 I can tell you that it makes a loud, distinctive sound - it sounds like a balloon being blown up, only much louder. People wear earplugs in firing ranges for a reason, and usually those ranges&#39; walls are covered in noise-absorbent materials so people passing by won&#39;t go deaf because of the noise. So you&#39;ll probably know if someone fired a rifle at your vicinity, but your window of opportunity to dodge or do something would be very, very small.</p>

            <p>First of all, I&#39;m intrigued that you&#39;re using Canada. Pretty cool. However:<br><br>First of all, Mikelima, you mentioned that Paul was unknown to Peter. The problems with that...well, first of all, unless Paul was only ever being the man on the inside in their seventh year or something, that&#39;s a pretty big secret to keep from someone you trust so completely. Remember, while Peter was chosen to be the Secret Keeper because that way Sirius could act as decoy, he would never have been chosen for such an important task if he wasn&#39;t trusted completely and absolutely. Sirius, James, and Lily trusted him to guard Lily, James, and Harry with his life if necessary; they believed he would never betray them. They suspected Remus at the time, not Peter; that rather indicates that Peter could keep his mouth shut, and that he didn&#39;t have a history of blurting out secrets, either--first impressions do tend to last, and if Peter had originally babbled out every secret entrusted to him, that would have remained a concern, no matter what had changed. Also realize that Peter was working for Voldemort for at least a year without being caught. Now, while I suppose he could have been unaware that James and Paul had kept up their friendship of sorts post-Hogwarts (due to timing, it not seeming important, I don&#39;t know), he would not have been so completely out of the loop. It just doesn&#39;t make sense. I know that, as people who know what Peter eventually does, the temptation is to make him obviously untrustworthy or lesser or uninvolved, but...he was a Marauder. He was a follower, yes, but one who was completely trusted, never suspected, and, I hope, treated as a friend. Remember, the Marauders can&#39;t see the future; all they knew was that Peter wasn&#39;t above average in terms of wit, and that he was easily impressed by James (and probably Sirius as well). Bottom line, he was their friend, and they trusted him with their most important Secret.<br><br>Second, Storme Hawk--Sirius never got a trial. I can find the quote, if you like, but Dumbledore would have had to specifically insist that there be a trial if he&#39;s to raise points about Sirius&#39; possible innocence. In canon, Sirius was never tried; he was just sent straight to Azkaban.<br><br>I do rather like this idea, though--Paul, the &#39;connection&#39; in Slytherin (although, why is he helping to play pranks on his own House? Or was that explained and I forgot?) and all the stuff about Canada...you just need to get the details completely believable, which, I suppose, is why you asked for advice in the first place.<br><br>But yeah, I agree with Storme Hawk about the Hogwarts bit--exchange years just...don&#39;t really seem to make sense. He could get an acceptance letter as a British wizarding citizen, though, and then have to decide between that and staying in Canada with his friends, where he would also have received an acceptance letter...poor kid.<br><br>Also, bear in mind that there&#39;s a good deal of prejudice against Remus because of his furry little problem...although a recently-pardoned Sirius might be able to get away with more things than usual, I suppose...especially with Dumbledore&#39;s backing...but I get the feeling the Daily Prophet would raise a stink about Harry living with or near a werewolf either way.<br><br>This has been a message from DawnFire, Harry Potter fan and fanwriter (who had to work out a Fifth Marauder AU so it made sense and had to give a lot of thought to Peter. And yes, I am completely guilty of sidelining Peter as well; I just...came to realize it made no sense in canon).</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for your comments:<br><br>I guess yeah it might be hard to deal with Peter.  Considering that the point of divergence with Canon will be around 1970 or even earlier (The four Mauraders in Canon according to the Lexicon entered Hogwarts in 71), perhaps we see a few minor butterfly effects happening, maybe Peter had a little thing here and there.  <br><br>I was thinking that Paul would firmly ask Dumbledore to see that Sirius gets a trial.  After all, even if Sirius is Guilty, they need to pronounce justice, and properly sentence him.  Paul&#39;s possible motivation may be overhearing an argument between his father and a Pureblood Supremacist, maybe Lucius&#39;s Father or another family like the Notts.  Perhaps he might have been bullied by Lucius prior to entering Hogwarts.  Now, I typically write Alternate History stuff, and when in that genre when you use earlier and earlier points of divergence from Our Timeline (&quot;OTL&quot;), many many changes that can happen.<br><br>I was thinking an alternative on Hogwarts or Canadian Education is that He and Daphne decide to go to Hogwarts, and endure the ire of Slytherin and etc.  A few butterflies lead to perhaps a less traumatic confrontation with Quirrell, and Dumbledore gets the confirmation that Riddle is Back.  Dumbledore has a slight epiphany and decides to tell the Prophecy to Sirius, asking him to tell Harry that there was a Prophecy made, and that if Harry wants to, he can listen to it.<br><br>For second year, I was thinking of either Harry staying in Canada, after informing Sirius or Remus about the Warnings from Dobby, or he might think about still going, despite Dobby&#39;s Efforts.  I was leaning to the latter, as I intend for Dubledore to be honest to the parents of Hermione Granger (and no they are not going to get the cliched names of Dan and Emma) and they consider getting Hermione to Withdraw.  Paul offers an alternative, and Hermione may or may not join Harry and Daphne for one normal year at a Canadian school.<br><br>For fourth year, everything would be normal until Holloween, when well...<br><br>I&#39;ll continue more later.</p>
