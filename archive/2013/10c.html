            <p>To those who celebrate it, at least. To those who don&#39;t, Happy October 30! It&#39;s a bit grey and wet here in Chicago, but maybe it&#39;s nicer where you are. {= )<br><br>Also, I have an RP-bunny that I&#39;d like to pitch, especially to anyone whose agents have kids in the Nursery. I can&#39;t believe this has never been done before, but what say you to a little HQ Trick-or-Treat dealie? I think we could set up on the other Board kinda like we did for the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=2755;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">Agent Mailbox game</a>, where everyone who wants to have their agents participate posts their RC number and agent names in response to the original post, and people with kids can reply to those posts one at a time to knock on doors. Does that make sense?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I don’t expect trick-or-treaters to knock at a door that isn’t decorated for Halloween, and since I don’t know when Androiaavata did or will arrive in the PPC, she probably didn’t get the message, had no time to set up any decorations, doesn’t know what Halloween is or doesn’t even have a RC. Read: Real Life became much more demanding than I had expected some months ago (that’s also the reason why you don’t see me do anything at the wiki), and I don’t want to make the kids wait some days before Androia answers the door. So I won’t participate. <br><br>But I cannot stop thinking about how Androia would react to trick-or-treaters, especially if one of them were a little green dragon, and that’s probably a good thing.  <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>If so, I have a question that&#39;s been bothering me for some time concerning the Scratch.<br><br><br>Needless to say, spoilers ahoy.<br><br><br>Right. So, our story follows John, Rose, Dave, and Jade as they play Sburb and eventually find out that their session has/is/will be caught in an extremely convoluted web of stable time loops with Fun things like Jack Noir, Lord English, and the Condesce lurking in the shadows. They Scratch their session in hopes of getting a more favourable set of starting conditions and end up with Crockercorp taking over the B2 Earth.<br><br>My question is: what happened to the other Sburb sessions that launched around the same time as John&#39;s session <i>after</i> the Scratch? We know that Sburb went into open beta three days before John&#39;s birthday and it&#39;s been mentioned that houses all over the world have been struck be meteors during that time. Rose discovered in the Skaianet lab near her house a map that displayed a tonne of meteor impact zones, ostensibly centred on players&#39; houses.<br><br>Supposing that some groups managed to prototype their Kernelsprites before impact and bring their coplayers into the Medium, there should be several other human Sburb sessions in parallel with John&#39;s, each trying to create a new universe. Sure, they&#39;re fighting an uphill battle with things like the Jack-Noir-Cancer running loose in their session, but they&#39;re in the Medium, they&#39;ve got their session up and running, and they&#39;re safe from other sessions&#39; Scratches, right? After all, having a &quot;pan-session suicide button&quot; is just plain counterintuitive.<br><br>But that&#39;s what seemed to happen in the post-Scratch universe: given the fact that the B2 Earth kept the Sburb Alpha under wraps and only allowed a single session to launch, the other sessions never happened in B2.<br><br>Did the B1 human sessions just poof out of existence or is this like the trolls&#39; session and the players are betting everything on the outcome of a single session?<br><br><br>...I think I&#39;ve used the word &quot;session&quot; too much in this quesion.</p>

            <p>There are going to be a few layers here, but given that it&#39;s a Homestuck question, that&#39;s far from unusual. Oh, and in case anyone is reading this post and hasn&#39;t this post and hasn&#39;t caught up with Homestuck yet, or at least reached Act 6 Act 3, spoilers of the largest sort will follow.<br><br>Initially, in the B1 universe, multiple copies of the game existed and were distributed(I&#39;m not counting the Alternia universe as &quot;initially&quot;, even though it created the B universe set, for reasons I&#39;ll get to later). Since Sburb has been compared by Word of Hussie(I don&#39;t remember whether it was in the story itself or through Formspring) that the game exists as a sort of cosmic reproductive system, this makes sense. The Genesis Frogs would need to be able to multiply themselves, rather than just existing and creating a new version of themselves every time one dies. There was <a href="http://mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002774">a map in Act 3</a> that showed that while there are numerous sessions, there are far more meteors than there are active sessions, but there still are active sessions. The prevalence of the meteors is probably because there are multiple sessions&#39; worth of meteors aimed at the same planet. While The Battlefield is always destined to be destroyed during the Reckoning and the Prospit side is always destined to lose, Skaia still needs to exist to provide the alchemy cradle for the formation of the Genesis Frog, so some, but not all, of the meteors are sent through; ones sessions&#39; worth which would heavily damage a large planet like Earth or Alternia, but not kill it all on its own.<br><br>Compare the trolls&#39; world, A2, which only had one session, and the B2 universe, which only had one session, to B1 Earth. The troll world is, compared to the B1 Earth, almost undamaged when shown in the post-session era. Sure, most of its society has been destroyed due to the corrosion of troll cities and infrastructure following Gl&#39;bgolyb psychically killing the planet&#39;s population, but a lot of what it is in the Exiles&#39; time is almost the same as it was in the trolls&#39; time. Even <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003174">the deserts that the trolls&#39; exiles operate out of</a> are still present and widespread in the pre-session days. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004231">They can be seen most frequently during Kanaya&#39;s segments, as Kanaya lives smack in the middle of said desert.</a> Granted, she lives in an oasis, but she <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=004223">made it herself</a>, so it&#39;s not representative.<br><br>Both the A2 and B2 planets weren&#39;t as badly hurt, and in fact managed to rebuild their societies, albeit through the influence of the Felt(which included an omnipotent First Guardian among their numbers) and a space conqueror respectively, but B1 Earth is irreparably damaged by the onslaught. The only thing we see of it is a continent-wide desert, which means it&#39;s likely that the rest of the world is devastated or uninhabitable. So, why is the B1 Earth torched completely while the B2 Earth only has widespread flooding and climate shift? Simple. The B2 Earth existed as an extension of the session played by John, Dave, Jade, and Rose, while the B1 Earth existed to be the starting point for their session and all of the other human sessions.<br><br>The Scratch resets only a single session, because as you said, resetting every single session for an entire species because one session isn&#39;t working out would be pointless. What if the flawed session was simply unable to win for a reason that was out of anyone&#39;s control, as happened in the main story? So, the Scratch creates a new planet with shifted-around versions of the null session&#39;s players in an attempt to correct the problem, and retroactively inserts it in the universe set&#39;s Genesis Frog.(Remember, when Bec Noir attacked the B universe Genesis Frog, it was revealed that all worlds in the Homestuck continuum containing Earth and its population exist within the Frog&#39;s body. All timelines, all doomed timelines, all offshoots, and the like. Since a scratched world contains ts own alpha timeline, it would be an offshoot rather than a doomed timeline, but could still potentially create more doomed timelines itself.)<br><br>The B2 universe only had one session, with all of Sburb under wraps, with a closed beta, etcetera, because it only <i>could</i> have one session. It doesn&#39;t exist to propagate on its own merits. It&#39;s the path of a single ovum, if you&#39;ll allow me to compare this to real-world mammalian/amphibian terms here for a moment. The ova cannot create more of themselves after the construction of the ovaries, and thus there is a maximum number of possible successes. Likewise, the scratched universes cannot create more than one new universe, but they can finish where their predecessors failed. Not a perfect comparison, because ova can&#39;t go back and try again if they weren&#39;t fertilized the first time, but it&#39;s the closest I could come up with.<br><br>This fits into the setup of the Alternia universe. It is a post-scratch world, designated A2, and was the result of one of the A1 universe&#39;s sessions encountering a dangerous and session-fatal glitch. It has not been revealed whether Beforus had more than one session attached to it, but I think it&#39;s a likely scenario. And, regardless of what hundreds of fanwriters will tell you, in the Alternia that produced Sollux, Karkat, Kanaya, and all the rest, there was only one session, and it succeeded, creating B1, a new, fertile life form that would eventually produce numerous sessions of its own.<br><br>So, to sum it all up, the other B1 sessions do in fact still exist. In fact, they wouldn&#39;t have been affected by the Scratch for the same reason the rest of the Medium wasn&#39;t affected by it; the Scratch only hits a single Incipisphere, and they&#39;re outside its range. We just haven&#39;t seen any of them because we&#39;re following, in the words of Hussie, &quot;a boy and his friends and the game they play together&quot;. Granted, those were circa-Act 4 words and it&#39;s a little more complicated now, but they still hold up. The other B1 kids probably either died when the universe&#39;s cancer hit the session(likely), performed a scratch of their own(less likely, but distinctly possible), or won(enormously unlikely), so their stories probably wouldn&#39;t have even been as fun as the tri-layered, quad-universal adventure Homestuck&#39;s been telling us.</p>

            <p>Those other sessions never got off the ground.  No one ever figured out how to prototype their kernel sprites.  There problem here is that you assume that the meteors are supposed to spur the other players into starting the game, like they are with the John and the rest.  However, there is another explanation.<br><br>It could be that the meteors that hit the other players houses were meant to keep them out of the medium because they aren&#39;t John and Co.  Skaia knows what it needs to make this whole thing work, after all.  It needs John, Rose, Dave, and Jade.  It doesn&#39;t need Tom, Dick, and Harry.<br><br>So, where are all the other kids who are playing the game?  They are all dead in meteor impacts.  If, by some twist of fate, they did manage to get to the medium, I would say that they probably ended up in eternal void sessions and were reset with the rest of the universe.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>The meteors don&#39;t come because you start playing the game, per se. They come because events later on trigger the Cataclysm (I think it was called that?), they all go hurtling at Skaia in an attempt to destroy it, and Skaia&#39;s last-ditch attempt to save itself involves opening up a bunch of portals across time and space, resulting in the meteors hitting Earth instead. Skaia probably knows what it&#39;s doing opening up portals to those particular times and places, but it&#39;s not a direct cause and effect thing. As with everything in <i>Homestuck</i>, it&#39;s more convoluted than that. {= P<br><br>But yeah, the upshot is that life on Earth is utterly destroyed, leaving the four kids and their guardians as the only survivors and the planet itself as a barren desert wasteland. Then later, the Carapacian Exiles show up and begin to rebuild something resembling civilization. In theory.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Someone other than me remembers it exists! (blows noisemaker) Okay, that&#39;s a bit of an exaggeration. I know at least Lily Winterwood also remembers it exists, because she writes an agent for it, but I&#39;ve hardly if ever seen it even referenced in recent stories, so I&#39;d been planning on doing something with it once I got Permission, however far away that will be. Maybe we can collaborate at some point.<br><br>Well, considering that &quot;he/she/it/they fell through a plot hole&quot; is among the most common reasons for someone or something to wind up in HQ(and actually is going to be the centerpiece for the DMFF story that I&#39;m planning), having a canonical basis for a character suddenly disappearing and reappearing somewhere else provides a justified prompt to take advantage of the trend. So, yes, it would be possible.<br><br>As for plausibility of recruitment opposed to extradition, that would depend on a few factors, but just in general, I&#39;d say so long as he&#39;s sapient, capable of interacting with other beings and the PPC technology, and reasonably non-hostile, I&#39;d say chances are high they&#39;d let him in. The PPC is perpetually understaffed no matter how many agents it has, after all.<br>What is he, by the way? I don&#39;t know Spiral Knights, so I don&#39;t know what the species are, who can become a knight and how, what their power levels are, and the like, so I can&#39;t say much about the matter for certain.</p>

            <p>meh it looked cool, I put/DOGA on there co I wasn&#39;t sure just how many fics there&#39;d be to spork for the DMFF alone. Collabing would be fun.<br><br>Well the Spiral Knights, aren&#39;t really a named species (if they are they&#39;re called Knights or something like that), they&#39;re reasonably non-hostile and sapient enough to be in the PPC. <br><br>The basis of Spiral Knights is that you start off as an Apprentice of the Spiral Knights who flew through the cosmos on their ship The Skylark, well did. Having crashed on a mysterious world called Cradle they&#39;re basically trying to rebuild the Skylark and explore cradle to its fullest annyoing/defeating various monsters, slimes, constructs and ghosts on their way. You rank up dependent on certain &#39;Rank&#39; missions (for example I&#39;m currently a Knight Elite and I&#39;m on the Rank 6-1 Missions, you start as an Apprentice on Rank 1-1 and the highest atm is a Champion on rank 9-4) In terms of power they don&#39;t actually have anything besides their abilities to create the weapons and armour they need. They have a choice of Swords, Guns and Bombs as weapons (only have 2 weapons at a time but in any combination) and various different types of Weapon and Armour that each do different things. The weapons and armour have a level between 0 and 5 stars, the more stars it has the higher rank required to wield it (for example as a Knight Elite I can use up to 3 star items) <br><a href="http://wiki.spiralknights.com/Main_Page"><a href="http://wiki.spiralknights.com/Main_Page">http://wiki.spiralknights.com/Main_Page</a></a> <br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>Do you mean a spin-off? Torchwood is one, though it is8s a bit more mature than Doctor Who. There&#39;s also the Sarah Jane Adventures. And K9 and Friends, though that one isn&#39;t sponsored by the BBC.</p>

            <p>As a gift, I virtually give you a Fanon Pinkie Pie Party! What is the difference between a Pinkie Pie Party and a Fanon Pinkie Pie Party you ask? Well, I&#39;ll tell you! Due to the My Little Pony brand being made primarily for little girls, Hasbro has forced the canon to restrain Pinkie&#39;s partying abilities to those for a five year old little girl. While this is all well and good for said five year olds, those much older then that can only find so much enjoyment from them that is not based on nostalgia. <br><br>Enter the Fanon Package, where fanfics do right by semi ignoring canon to break the shackles enforced by corporate onto our favorite Party Pony. Now she can use that cutiemark and throw you what is quite simply the BEST PARTY EVER! Music, drinks, snacks, party games, and quite simply the most delicious cake you will ever taste!<br><br>Due to being a member of the PPC, extended bonuses are given to you! Pinkie Pie uses a mixture of her fourth-wall breaking abilities and an RA she managed to get her hooves on to bring in ANY CANONS YOU WANT! Indeed, even the party can be set wherever you so wish, and no canon will question it for this day! Get drunk with you favorite characters, glomp your Lust Objects without (much) consequence, and anything else you can think of!<br><br>By the end of the party, specially programed robots with Neuralyzers will sort out all of the canon mess left behind, so worries about any damage to the continua. They will even neuralyze you, making the party seem like it never happened and that all you were doing was sitting at a computer screen reading about this fantastic, though fictional, package deal. The robots even have time travel abilities, due to being based off of the T-1000, so you won&#39;t even notice the time difference! This is quite simply the best party you will never remember!</p>

            <p>What part of &quot;the best party you will never remember,&quot; do you not understand? <br><br>Although, the robots <i>did</i> report that there were some problems neuralizing you, so it <i>is</i> possible you <i>may</i> have some latent memories buried in your subconscious. Perhaps if you were to, I don&#39;t know, write a story about the party that you should not remember, we can locate those memories and finally wipe them from your mind properly.

            <p>My two favourite musicals (both of which I&#39;ve had a part in when we did them at school/college) are Grease and Pirates of Penzance, I probably prefer Pirates but Grease has a special place in my mind after I performed parts of it (including a badass Grease Lightning routine) in front of over a thousand people at the nearest theatre.</p>

            <p>...mostly &#39;cause I&#39;ve always been an opera junkie myself more than a musical theater one. Even if they are technically the same thing.<br><br>So... my favorite musical would probably be <i>Sweeney Todd</i>. Not only is it a really intense musical, but everything about the score is just... Oh man, I could hum that score forever. Besides, I am a bit... <i>stringy</i> about it. (And no, I&#39;m not a piccolo player, &#39;cause I&#39;m not piping hot.)<br><br>As for favorite opera... Hands down, Alban Berg&#39;s <i>Wozzeck</i>. If <i>Sweeney Todd</i> is intense, then <i>Wozzeck</i> is even more so. <i>Wozzeck</i>, while it might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea (it&#39;s an incredibly dissonant work and you do have to get used to Berg&#39;s non-tonal language) it&#39;s absolute pure genius in every single way. Love it, love it, love it, and I would murder kittens if it meant I could see it live.</p>

            <p>Here, I&#39;ll link you to a <i>really</i> good filmed production of Wozzeck to get you started. It&#39;s close to the stage directions, brilliantly sung, and just great all around. (The interpretation in the orchestra is a little on the clinical side, but it gets the complexities of the score across very well.) So here you go:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlHpLH0-NMU"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlHpLH0-NMU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlHpLH0-NMU</a></a><br><br>If you&#39;re a Wagnerian, you&#39;ll probably latch on pretty quickly. Just keep in mind that you may need to get used to the harmonic language, mainly because it&#39;s a <i>very</i> dissonant score. You did mention Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, though, so I think you should be good for Wozzeck. (Fun anecdote: Berg oversaw a performance of Wozzeck that was staged in Leningrad in 1927. A young Shostakovich was present at that performance, and was profoundly affected. In fact, Shostakovich probably would&#39;ve gone in this direction if Stalin hadn&#39;t been such a twat.)<br><br>And also, oh cool, a fellow internet Wagnerian! Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to see a Wagner opera live. I got to see two of the Metropolitan Opera&#39;s broadcasts of their recent production of the Ring, though, and that was an incredible experience.</p>

            <p>Hmm, let&#39;s see, I&#39;ve played in pit orchestras (violin and viola; in one memorable amateur show where we couldn&#39;t get an oboe I actually played the oboe and cor anglais parts on violin/viola!)<br><br>The list, to the best of my recollection, is:<br><ul>
<br><li>Godspell<br>
</li>
<li>The Mikado<br>
</li>
<li>Aspects of Love<br>
</li>
<li>Les Miserables<br>
</li>
<li>Dracula Triumphant (it was a flop, which is why no-one&#39;s heard of it!)<br>
</li>
<li>You&#39;re A Good Man, Charlie Brown (where in addition to violin and viola, I had to play alto recorder, tambourine and kazoo!)<br>
</li>
<li>South Pacific<br>
</li>
<li>The Producers<br>
</li>
<li>West Side Story<br>
</li>
<li>Into The Woods (I actually only just played that show last weekend!)<br>
</li>
</ul>
<br>I may have done one or two more, but if so I&#39;ve forgotten.<br><br>My favourite musicals that I&#39;ve done were Les Mis, Producers and West Side Story, all for different reasons. Les Mis has the best story (Act II is so intense), Producers is just simply good fun, and West Side Story has some amazing music, possibly the best music in any musical.<br><br>Including shows that I haven&#39;t played, Wicked is a big favourite (Defying Gravity is such a great showpiece), and I&#39;m quite a fan of Next to Normal, which I saw earlier this year when a friend was playing in it.<br><br>Elcalion, musical</p>

            <p>I have been in my fair share of musicals.  &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, &quot;You&#39;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;Footloose&quot;, &quot;Schoolhouse Rock Live!&quot;, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, and &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot;, to name all of them.  So, I do have a fondness for them.<br><br>What is my favorite, though?  That is a difficult question.  Let me try to break it down.<br><br>Musical I would most like to star in: <b>&quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot;</b>  I sing a mean &quot;Confrontation&quot; and I know I can do better than Hasselhoff.<br><br>Musical I would like to star in opposite my brother (he was the Seymore to my Audrie II in Little Shop):  <b>&quot;Les Miserable&quot;</b>  With him as Valjean and me as Javert.  Our &quot;Confrontation&quot; (odd that that title keeps coming up) is formidable.  Also, I am looking for any excuse to bring this look back:<br><br><img src="http://i60.photobucket.com/albums/h27/diceanddagger/Facialhair.jpg" alt="The Chops" height="300"><br><br>Musical I just like to listen to:  <b>&quot;Avenue Q&quot;</b>  (NSFW) What can I say?  I am a big fan of raunchy puppets.  Also, I like to poke fun at Neshomeh with &quot;What Do You Do With a BA in English?&quot;<br><br>Other musicals I think are worth checking out:  <br><b>&quot;Aida&quot;</b> I saw it on-stage when I was in high school.  It is a classic &#39;choice vs fate&#39; story and the music is great, with a few exceptions (I&#39;m looking at you &quot;My Strongest Suit&quot;). This one is overlooked most of the time, and I think that&#39;s a shame.<br><br><b>&quot;Urinetown&quot;</b>  If you are looking for ridiculous meta-humor, look no further (It starts out with a song called &quot;Too Much Exposition&quot;).  I never got to see it, but the soundtrack spells out the story clearly enough.<br><br><b>&quot;I Love You, You&#39;re Perfect, Now Change&quot;</b>  This one is a series of short scenes that explore various aspects of relationshipes; from first date to growing old together.  It is often hilarious and sometimes touching.  Worth a listen, if you get the chance.<br><br><b>&quot;Songs for a New World&quot;</b>  This is another series of songs without a central plot.  They all revolve around the moment of decision.  Do you take a stand, back down, run away, or something else?<br><br><br>-Phobos, who is still waiting for someone to write a leading role for a bass.</p>

            <p>I want to know; what is the worst fic you have ever read?

It&#39;s awful both in its subject matter and because it&#39;s technically well-written enough that it just drags on and on, without any humorous typos, malapropisms, or mangled meanings to get in the way of the yucky things going on. There was an attempt to PPC the thing in 2006, but it didn&#39;t get very far because there&#39;s so little to work with in the humor department.

            <p>Oh yes, I have read that particular fic. While I would not say it is one of the worst fics I have ever read, it is rather infuriating. The song this was based off of I actually enjoy, and still listen to it. However, you know what I think of when I hear that song? The Rainbow Factory shown by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PjIhs72l0A%E2%80%8E"> BronyDanceParty in his PMV,</a> where they suck out the color from ponies for use in the rainbow. The visual that creates is morbid, and very, <i>very</i> uncanon, but interesting, and makes much more sense then having it be foals. Watching the color be drained from bright, pastel colored ponies, leaving behind grey, lifeless bodies is a fantastic visual. Grinding foals into P8 juice is not, and is only sickening.<br><br>I will say one good thing about Rainbow Factory though. <a href="http://www.dawnsomewhere.com/rainbow-dash-presents/rdp-rainbow-factory/"> It gave us a fantastic Rainbow Dash Presents.</a> </p>

            <p>Hands down, THE NEW GIRL on Voyager (Star Trek: Voyager)  Where to begin? The SPaG is hilariously horrible, leading to interesting turns of phrase like &quot;nanaprobes&quot; and &quot;the Bog Queen&quot;. The plot is nonsensical, involving a transdimensionally hopping Mary Sue who is caught in a love…something with all the young men on Voyager (including one she de-aged into a teenager). But she&#39;s &quot;Christian&quot; and therefore doesn&#39;t hang out with boys EVER and can&#39;t make a commitment to any of the boys fawning over her! She&#39;s so dedicated to her ideals! Also the Borg have taken Captain Janeway, but that&#39;s not important. At least, not as important as Harry, Icheb, and a de-aged Chakotay all vying for beautiful, pure Shaundrah&#39;s affections! It&#39;s so stupid that it actually gets funny after a point. <br><br>However, the fic that made me the most mad was Red Dragon (Star Trek: TNG). The Mary Sue is a whiny immature teenager who somehow has the rank of Commander and also is the last of her kind, a race called the Draconians that can shapeshift into dragons. Riker is turned into a rapist,  bringing up memories of her last commanding officer who raped her - and of couse she couldn&#39;t press charges in a progressive society because then she couldn&#39;t angst about it to her boyfriend Data, who, by the way, is suffering strange fits of emotion and hits her during one of them. Then she breaks the laws of physics by transforming into a dragon and using her weight to crush a ship IN SPACE and then being rescued from the explosion by Lore, who makes her a cybernetic hand and half-brain to fix her up. Cyborg shapeshifter-dragon teenager. Yep. <br><br>Sorry to rant, but like I said, it made me mad.</p>

            <p>The terribadest fic I&#39;ve ever read? Well, excluding bleepfics and legendary badfics and the like, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966278/1/TSAB-DOWNFALL-Halo-War">TSAB DOWNFALL: Halo War</a> (<b>NSFW, NSFB, Not Safe for Nanoha fans</b>) which is eleven chapters of alternating horribly bland boringess and trivialised genocide. Yes, you&#39;ve read that right, trivialised genocide. And torture. Not to mention that every canon that has more than one line is gods-below-damned replaced. This &#39;fic actually caused me to cry.

            <p>The fic is called Pinkamena: The Pink Shadow, supposedly set in the MLP universe, though Ponyville is neigh unrecognizable in this fic.  I would link to it, but for some reason I am unable to access the google doc that this monstrosity is archived on, so I will have to link to the main doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uJ8FqW1zBIzsYZoe4M1ILS9H8wgk2zjEEGQqmgNsfIg/"> here</a>, and tell you to click on the name of the fic. Now, it is a half-finished MST, and has been for several months, so don&#39;t expect the full snarky goodness of a proper MST. <br><br>So, why is it the worst fic I have ever read? Well, the grammar, while not the best, is leaps and bounds ahead of what most would consider the worst fanfiction. That is the <i>best possable thing I can say about this sticking piece of-</i><br><br>The characters are so insanely Out Of Character it makes me sick. Pinkamena is back from the infamous Cupcakes, and everypony says, &quot;Welp, that&#39;s just crazy old Pinkie Pie! No harm done, except for the pony she just gutted! Just don&#39;t eat any cupcakes for a month or so!&quot; Equestria is thrown completely out of sorts. Religion for some stupid reason comes to Equestria. So, is this religion a ponified version of several different religions brought together in one world, causing some conflicts in interests? No, it&#39;s only Christianity and Satanism directly from earth, brought to Equestria through the main character Dark Slash after he returned from Earth. <br><br>Oh yeah. The main character.<br><br>Dark Slash. <br><br>Where do I begin with this guy? He is a red and black alicorn with a katana as a cutie mark to represent his natural affinity for cutting ponies with swords, along with a second cutie mark behind it of 666, representing his deal with the Devil for supreme power. Yes, The Devil, as in Lucifer, Christianity&#39;s favorite villain. As a reward for his imortal soul, he now has a demon in his hooves which he can call forth whenever he wished, as well as superpony speed, strength, and- wait, did I say that the demon was in his hooves? Yes, I did, and not figuratively: his hooves are now white because they are the prison of one of Hell&#39;s greatest demons. This demon is a complete asshole. I&#39;m sorry, I know I should not curse here, but that is the nicest thing I can say about that festering little...mmph, <i>thing</i> that dares even GLANCE at Equestria and it&#39;s citizens.  Another thing about Dark Slash is his horn, another gift by the Devil. Oh yes, he was a pegasus before his little deal, and now he is an alicorn. Now, this should be fantastic news for him, right? WRONG! He hates alicorns, and anything to do with them! He constantly angsts on and on about how, &quot;Boo ho, I am an alicorn now! I am going to BRUTALLY MURDER ANYPONY WHO MENTIONS IT! Because I am so torcherd by the fact that I AM A GOD NOW!&quot; Further, he is married to Twilight Sparkle, has adopted Spike as a son, has brought not only earth religon but earth military with him from the other world, has a mashine that can trasport him &quot;through the fourth wall,&quot; and...<br><br>You know, I think I will stop there though there is plenty, PLENTY, more I could yell about. The thing about this particular fic is the emotion it brings out of me. Most badfics make me shake my head, or laugh, or grumble about the poor writing ability of the authors (sorry, I know, don&#39;t rage against the authors, but I don&#39;t demean them personally when I grumble) or something along those lines. This fic, at the very thought of it, makes me angry. Very angry. Like, I punched things repeatedly to vent out anger levels of angry. I <i>never</i> get that mad, but this thing...<br><br>So yeah. This is the absolute, no questions asked, <i>worst</i> fic I have ever read.</p>

            <p>This is a massive tie on my end. It seems that I have the absolute <i>worst</i> luck in finding terrible fanfiction, &#39;cause I just gravitate towards it even if I&#39;m not <i>trying</i> to find something bad.<br><br>I&#39;d say that the worst fic I&#39;ve ever read is a three-way tie between <i>Subject 23</i> (a <i>Mass Effect</i> self-insert with a main character who was loved by all despite the fact that he&#39;s a complete <i>psychopath</i> and <i>extreme</i> character bashing that the author even tried to justify by intentionally ignoring some parts of canon), <i>If You Don&#39;t Have Something Nice to say</i> (a <i>Fire Emblem</i> fic with one of the whiniest Mary Sues ever and an Idiot Plot that boggles the mind--and let&#39;s not get into how it romanticizes <i>sexual harassment</i> after the halfway point), and <i>From Another World</i> (a tale set in an alternate universe of <i>Mass Effect</i> where it&#39;s AU in name only and the only thing that happens is lots of plot regurgitation and a lot of a massive, self-aggrandizing Gary Stu who <i>says</i> he&#39;s doing a lot of good for the galaxy when he really is just acting like an idiot while coming up with numerous excuses to stick to the canon plot--oh, and <i>the author plagiarized a vast majority of it</i>).</p>

            <p>So, yeah. I&#39;ve hung around the PPC for several months now, I&#39;ve read all the required stuff, and held conversations on the board. I now feel reasonably confident in asking for Permission. (Mwahaha.)<br><br>So Permission givers, please take a look and tell me if there&#39;s anything I need to work on.  Here we go:<br><br>Agent A: Legacy<br>Gender: Male<br>Department: Department of Floaters <br>Partner: Zarathustra<br>Physical Description: Somewhat tall (about 5’ 9”) and skinny, crazy white hair and purple eyes and an impish face. Wears a jacketless white suit and combat boots.<br>Personality Description: Sometimes calm and observant, but is more often a hyperactive, bouncy annoyance. (This is thought to be a conscious decision, rather than sugar high, meant simply to annoy people.) Intelligent, but rather headstrong and prone to arguing with other peoples ideas if they disagree with him. He’s extremely pro-recruit Sues, given his past. Other than that he’s kind hearted and loves to read.<br>History: Legacy was formerly a nigh all-powerful shapeshifting Gary Stu from a badfic that was written three years ago, but then forgotten about. When the author came back, he deleted the whole thing, but the idea for the main character stuck around. When the author discovered the PPC, he decided this was a chance to redeem this character, and resurrected him as a former Stu agent. His shapeshifting powers were downgraded from a point where they made him near godlike to a much more limited point.<br><br>Agent B: Zarathustra<br>Gender: Female<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Partner: Legacy<br>Physical Description: Tall, (about 6’1”) African, and well muscled. Wears her hair in cornrows, and has dark brown eyes. Wears dark blue hoodie and cargo pants with sneakers. (When she’s angry, or distressed, orchestral music will begin to play.)<br>Personality Description: Calm and reserved, with an affinity for music, especially orchestral stuff. Is also headstrong, which leads for some rather interesting conversations with Legacy.  Is used to getting her own way, and often doesn’t realize that if she and Legacy put their heads together they can come up with much better plans.<br>History: An author’s misconception of the name Zarathustra. The author, when first listening to the song ‘Thus sprach Zarathustra,’ thought of an African princess, and went with the idea, developing her to the point she is now. When the author learned what Zarathustra really meant (something along the lines of ‘He who drives camels’) he dropped the idea. A nearby plothole decided to be froggy and nabbed the idea, popping her right into the PPC HQ.<br><br>The above agents stay in RC number 2012.<br><br>Agent C: Tristan MacRory<br>Gender: Male<br>Department: Department of Mary Sue Experimentation and Research<br>Partner: Paige<br>Physical Description: Somewhat tall (around 5’ 8”) and somewhat chubby. Has mouse brown hair and eyes.  Wears large glasses (which he often exchanges for a large pair of goggles) and t-shirt and jeans under his lab coat. (His lab coat, for reference, is sewn full of hammer-space pockets which he carries a large supply of meat cleavers in, for some reason.)<br>Personality Description: Rather absentminded and a bit of a conspiracy theorist, but is really quite brilliant. Is often confused by external variables, (often angry superiors and agents) who come in and mess up his work. Would be completely nowhere if he didn’t have Paige.<br>History: He and his partner/creation/daughter are escapees from a particularly insane Phineas &amp; Ferb badfic. Something went wrong with his teleporter escape-rout, however, and he ended up in the PPC HQ.<br><br><br>Agent D: Paige<br>Gender: Technically female<br>Department: Department of Mary Sue Experimentation and Research<br>Partner: Tristan MacRory<br>Physical Description: An AI inside a floating softball-sized orb of black glass. She can project expressions onto the ball, usually in the form of cartoonish eyes and freckles. She sometimes does troll-faces to irritate Tristan.<br>Personality Description: Since an accident in her crazy fic of origin, Paige has become rather sarcastic and cynical, (just like most PPC technology) and acts much like a bratty ten-year old. She refers to her current form as an ‘overly expressive bowling ball’ and is currently bugging her ‘dad’ (as she calls him) for a new body.<br>History: An android invented by Tristan MacRory, her original form was destroyed in a rather strange incident in a crazy Phineas &amp; Ferb fic. She came with her ‘dad’ to PPC HQ.<br><br>So there we have it. As for a link to some stories I&#39;ve already written, here&#39;s a link to my Fanfiction profile: <br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3812905/The-Dark-Lord-Duroth"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3812905/The-Dark-Lord-Duroth">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/3812905/The-Dark-Lord-Duroth</a></a><br>Also, here&#39;s a link to a few badfics that I intend to spork:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8344912/1/The-Fifth-Horseman-of-the-Apocalypse"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8344912/1/The-Fifth-Horseman-of-the-Apocalypse">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8344912/1/The-Fifth-Horseman-of-the-Apocalypse</a></a><br>and:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9684344/1/the-newest-nerd"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9684344/1/the-newest-nerd">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9684344/1/the-newest-nerd</a></a><br><br>There we are.

            <p>Partly because I don&#39;t feel I have a good sense of who you are as a PPCer, partly because I think these are good kinds of questions for anyone to think about:<br><br>1. Why the Department of Floaters? It it just because you don&#39;t have a firm idea of where your sporking interests lie yet, or is there something about it that specifically appeals to you?<br><br>2. All of your agents except Paige seem to have a characteristic about them that exists &quot;just because,&quot; randomness for the sake of randomness: Legacy&#39;s appearance and style of dress, Zarathustra&#39;s background music, Tristan&#39;s hammerspace meat cleavers. Do you think these traits can be used for more than one joke without getting old? If so, how do you see them playing into your stories and affecting your characters long-term?<br><br>3. I&#39;m not familiar with the continua in the badfics you&#39;re eyeballing, so tell me, what&#39;s so bad about them? They both have some shaky mechanics, definitely, but why do they deserve death by sporking?<br><br>4. I like that you&#39;re looking at doing something with the DMSE&amp;R, but it seems like people typically do one, maybe two things with it and then drop it. That&#39;s not a crime or anything, but I&#39;m curious about what you have in mind and whether it&#39;s just a single idea or longer-term plans. Also, are you thinking of using the lab report format, or something else? What&#39;s your relationship to science in your real life?<br><br>Just to be clear, I&#39;m not trying to put you on the spot or quiz you or anything like that. Mostly what I&#39;m trying to do here is get a sense of what you&#39;re all about, since I don&#39;t know you very well. I&#39;ve been in and out for the last few months, and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever talked. I&#39;ll commence with the actual feedback and decision-making pending your responses—unless, of course, a better-informed PG gets around to it first. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>In answer to your questions:<br><br>1. I chose the Department of Floaters mostly out of the desire to spark anything I come across, regardless of the type.<br><br>2. Well… this is a bit complex:<br>    -I was thinking Legacy would be ribbed every now and then about how his suit isn&#39;t exactly PPC standards, and then have a few things where he tries different styles and fails miserably.<br>    -Zarathustra&#39;s background music is a side effect of her being the authors misconception of the name &#39;Zarathustra&#39; as it&#39;s the name of an orchestral piece. I was going to have people question her about its origins occasionally, but other than that it was just going to be some music that played whenever she got frustrated. Good point though; I should probably be careful with it so as to not overplay the joke…<br>     -Tristan&#39;s knives weren&#39;t going to come up often, probably during the few fights he&#39;d get into… I was going to play it for laughs just once, and then have it as a fact of life.<br>Phew. I hope that answers all of 2.<br><br>3. The first one, &#39;The Fifth Horseman of The Apocalypse&#39; is a crossover between Percy Jackson and the Outsiders. It completely trashes both stories. (Percy&#39;s parents die in the first two paragraphs, ancient god-like beings act like brainless teenagers, and so on.)<br>The second one, &#39;the newest nerd&#39; is one for the book series NERDS. It also completely trashes the characters, and the main character is a… horribly written character at best. (The team reduced to… cardboard cutouts, there are random and completely unexplained happenings, and so (#<sup>%)</sup> on.)<br><br>4. Mwahaha… Just the question I wanted to answer! I have dozens of experiments lined up to test the limits of glitter, and I have a lovely new peice of technology I&#39;d like to introduce to the PPC for immobilizing Sues. And, well, DMSE&amp;R is apparently the best place for all that.<br><br>Well, there we are. I hope that answers all your questions! </p>

            <p>Some questions do remain, though:<br><br>- PPC standard? What&#39;s that? O.o Also, that doesn&#39;t speak to Legacy&#39;s odd eyes and hair—assuming he&#39;s human and not terribly old, that is. You didn&#39;t specify either of those things. You should do that. Also, I forgot to ask: what is the extent of his abilities, exactly? &quot;Downgraded from godlike&quot; isn&#39;t necessarily saying much, y&#39;know?<br><br>- I got that the music playing was related to Zarathustra&#39;s background. I was more wondering what the exact nature of the relationship is; i.e., why you, the author, decided to include that as part of her character. I don&#39;t understand how, in your thought process, her origin as an interpretation of a musical piece necessitates that piece playing from nowhere when she&#39;s in a certain emotional state. What&#39;s the reasoning behind it? If there isn&#39;t any, that concerns me.<br><br>- I have similar concerns regarding Tristan. Why does an absentminded, socially bewildered scientist need cleavers (or knives? which is it?) at all, let alone ones that magically appear from hammerspace? What kind of fights do you/he expect him to get into, exactly? How would they come about? Why knives/cleavers and not something else?<br><br>- What is this piece of technology you want to introduce? I&#39;m leery of anything that would make the agents&#39; job too easy and therefore boring to read about.<br><br>For the record, I don&#39;t have any big concerns about your actual writing. In your published pieces, there are a few SPaG hiccups and a tendency to fall into a dry sort of &quot;this happened, then that happened, and then another thing came after it&quot; rhythm, but that&#39;ll easily improve with time and some effort toward including more sensory details and strong verbs.<br><br>I really want to caution you against randomness for its own sake, though. Random <i>can</i> be funny, but not all by itself, and not if that&#39;s all you&#39;ve got going. The value of it is in its unexpectedness, and it&#39;s only going to be unexpected once.<br><br>All in all, I&#39;m inclined to go ahead and say Permission granted. I think I&#39;d like you to send your first story from each set of agents to me before you publish, though. My e-mail is neshomeh (dot) soul (at) gmail (dot) com, with the obvious substitutions.

            <p>Woohoo! That&#39;s awesome, I&#39;ll go ahead and answer your questions now.<br><br>1. PPC standard I thought was wearing black. Legacy&#39;s outfit sort of goes against that. And as a shapeshifter, he&#39;s only technically human. He has the white hair and purple eyes because he wants a base to stick to. By &#39;Downgraded from godlike&#39; I mean that he used to be able to become whatever he imagined and copy its abilities perfectly. Now he can only become what he&#39;s seen, and can only copy it&#39;s abilities if they&#39;re not technology based (cyborg or robot) or magic based (magician, certain forms of dragon). He also has especial trouble becoming something like a spirit or an animate inanimate object. (Like a golem, for instance.)<br><br>2. Zara&#39;s music was added because I had a base idea for dramatic music playing when she was upset, and a trusted confidant told me to go with the idea.<br><br>3. Tristan is going to need his knives because, as a DMSE&amp;R agent who deals directly with Sues, which are notorious for breaking controls, in a controlled environment… He&#39;s going to need some form of protection.<br><br>4. Not anything that makes their jobs that much easier. I call it the AGNeS; the Anti-Glitter NanitE System. It&#39;s, as the name states, a system of nanites injected into the bloodstream through a control bracelet to monitor levels of Glitter and prevent Sueification. It would be used for keeping Sue agents and Mary Sue experiments under control, though there are a few applications for it in the field.  Say, for instance, slipping one onto a God-Modder in order to make her more manageable during charging. (Of course, there&#39;s the problem of getting it onto her in the first place…)<br><br>But… well… Thanks! I&#39;m going to go into the other room and squee my head off for all it&#39;s worth now.</p>

            <p>I have never watched this series, so my perception of this may be incorrect.<br>But still, this fanfic made me want to pull my hair out and scream and cry and to erase what I was reading.<br>They are writing in <i>incorrect</i> Janglish (japanese+english). As a native Japanese and English speaker, this kills me to no end. (Besides, even if she used correct Janglish, I bet the story would still kill me because of grammar usage.)<br>And, although I don&#39;t know who this &quot;Minto&quot; person is, (if she cannon) I can almost bet that she is not the way described here.<br>I really feel bad for any agent sporking this.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;ve been following my posts for a while, you may have noticed that I&#39;ve been hyping a very good Phoenix Wright/MLP crossover on YOutube called Turnabout Storm. If you&#39;ve followed it, you know that fans have been waiting for the finale for quite some time.

            <p>I haven&#39;t watched Free! yet, but it&#39;s slice-of-life about a swim team full of eyecandy dudes, yeah? So I guess a character who was way better than any of the main characters at swimming, and whose presence threw any or all of their personalities out of whack in order to fulfill some shipping fantasy or other would be a couple of qualifiers. Or perhaps there&#39;s an OC who really likes boys who play basketball, so one of the dudes (like, say, Haruka Nanasae, who according to MAL &quot;always loved to be immersed in water, and to swim in it&quot;) give up swimming to join the basketball club impress the character, that OC is prooobably a Sue.<br><br>Basically, just take whatever makes Free! what it is, and add a character who turns that on its head for no good reason. I wish I knew more about the show, so I could have a more informed opinion XD</p>

            <p>Well, it looks as though Autumn_68 already gave you most of the links, save the one to the Constitution, and that&#39;s up at the top of the Board, and so that just leaves giving out some welcome gifts.<br><br>Let&#39;s see... for Olivia, a Flintlock of Zillyhau, one of the legendary weapons of the cherub race! Use it wisely.<br><br>And since I don&#39;t know any of Rachael&#39;s fandoms and I have an abundance of spider robots running about the place, you can have... gotcha! This little green one. It&#39;s fast, durable, and good for scouting and general assistance work, but I didn&#39;t give it any weapons because its body is set too low to the ground to aim them, and I didn&#39;t want to build it any new limbs to hold something with. Though, you could always attach a taser or some other electric weapon to the tapering bit at the front. That could work.</p>

            <p>Why Daphne Greengrass has been addressed - it&#39;s probably because she&#39;s such an open canvas, for better or worse. As for why &quot;Ice Queen,&quot; my guess would actually be that a few of the more well-known fanworks involving her portray her that way. Sorta like how a really well-known fanfic can establish itself as nearly canonical in other places: a LotR fanfic posted here that involved Lindir would, presumably, use the characterization given him in Don&#39;t Panic! and Okay, NOW Panic, despite neither of those being canon, technically speaking.<br><br>Ron!Bashing is... I don&#39;t know, just irritating. But Dumbledore, you must admit, was <i>written</i> as a fairly manipulative character. Fandom just takes it up to eleven.</p>

            <p>...younger sister. I can&#39;t remember if or when she was mentioned in the books...so I&#39;ll just go check the HP lexicon, hold on.<br><br>...well, it&#39;s a good thing I looked that up. Daphne Greengrass is Astoria Greengrass&#39; <i>older</i> sister. She took her OWLs at the same time as Hermione.

            <p>Especially if it&#39;s taken to preposterous extremes like the Hollywood kung fu that allows people to have iron-hard skin and backflip twenty feet into the air. Potterverse wizards can already shoot beams of energy from their wands that can melt solid wood or turn people into wine goblets. Combining that sort of power with Hollywood kung fu would make them basically unstoppable.<br><br>...I wonder who the Bruce Lee of Potter-fu would be. Probably Dumbledore. I always thought that there must have been some reason that even other wizard-lords feared him. And since he&#39;s dead, he can even have a movie based on him in which wizards clone the former master of high-level magic and physical combat to create a team of martial arts secret agents, just like Bruce Lee had!<br><br>Now this image of a trio of secret agent Dumbledore clones making triumphant martial arts poses is going to be hanging around in my head all day, whether I want it or not.</p>

            <p>I read a lot of the fanfictions that pair Harry with rarer girls like Daphne, there aren&#39;t that many compared to say, Hermione or Ginny pairings but compared to pretty much every other &#39;rare pair&#39; it&#39;s probably got the biggest backing. <br><br>I agree with Karen DuLay in that one of the most appealing reasons to pair Harry and Daphne is that she&#39;s really a blank slate for writers. However there are other reasons for it, I believe, moving into the others things you&#39;ve said. <br>By wanting to make Harry different and stand out compared to the canon fanfic writers want someone different to be his love interest, if its another Gryffindor it&#39;s hard to stay away from Hermione and Ron because he&#39;ll still be spending time with Gryffindors, unless something along the lines of Lords Quarters are used (or Harry is in a different house, but that&#39;s a whole different kettle of fish). If he&#39;s with a Ravenclaw (Cho or Luna are the only two I&#39;ve really seen it with although there are plenty of other girls mentioned in Ravenclaw if they have been paired with Harry in a story it hardly ever gets finished), with Cho it seems to carry on as if they never broke up in OotP and Luna is already part of his friendship group from 5th year onwards really and so things don&#39;t change. Hufflepuff gives a few decent girls, but considering most of their reactions to him in the books (Chamber of Secrets and Goblet of Fire especially) combined with Harry&#39;s usual new persona in these stories (unforgiving of those who&#39;ve betrayed him etc.) means they don&#39;t really work. Now the only house left is Slytherin, which is the least obvious choice (and most shows Harry &#39;breaking away&#39; from his old life). Of the mentioned girls in Slytherin Pansy is generally a no (besides being with Draco for most of the books) Millicent is generally seen as a barinless, slightly ugly minion of Pansy&#39;s leaving (really) Tracy and Daphne, Tracy isn&#39;t actually mentioned in the books, whilst Daphne is, making her the more obvious choice.     <br>There&#39;s also the fact that most writers (including me at one point) seem to want to prove that Slytherins aren&#39;t always evil (something that canon seems to leave out, unfairly one might add). by pairing Harry (the usual epitome of good) with a Slytherin means that along with any statement of &quot;We&#39;re not evil we&#39;re neutral&quot; or something similar gives the writer (and maybe the reader) some sort of relief. <br>Moving on from Daphne, Ron is seen as the weak link of the  Golden Trio, the stupid one, the lazy one, the one who betrays Harry the most etc. etc. and in canon no matter what Ron&#39;s done Harry doesn&#39;t seem to care and immediately accepts him as a best friend again once the apology is through (Remember this isn&#39;t my view point). In Harmony fics Ron bashing gives Harry and Hermione a way to fall in love and in other fics it gives Hermione a way of seeing how evil Ron is and join Harry&#39;s side. Manipulative Dumbledore is easy, it&#39;s pretty much written all over Canon and most people love to extend that and make it worse. Whilst I do write a manipulative Dumbledore I don&#39;t bash him or make him evil, (I tried once and realized how wrong it was) He fulfills more of a supporting role, reduced to that because of his manipulations and plans, but still on the side of good. And there are a few fics that do that. <br>There are Hermione bashing fics about, normally more severe betrayal ones but there are a good number if you search hard enough. <br>Manipulative Draco? No, I hadn&#39;t thought of that, but then again it may not really fit his character. Manipulative Lucius? Now that sounds like a good idea. <br>Err, why not? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve seen them named Monica and Wendell as well (after the names they &#39;adopted&#39; after Hermione memory charmed them). But then I&#39;ve also seen them have different names as well.<br><br>Well, I&#39;ll stop with the wall of text for now<br><br>Storme Hawk     </p>

            <p>I suspect one reason the Daphne/Harry pairing is popular is because we know so little about Daphne, and thus fanfic writers can essentially take a canon character and give her whatever traits they want. As for her Ice Queen nickname...it may be because she was a Slytherin?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve no idea about Daphne Greengrass, having only ever seen passing mentions of her in fanfic. It might just be that people associate her strongly with Draco/the Slytherin creed, but know very little about her - therefore making her perfect for &quot;development&quot; by pairing her with the hero.<br><br>However, the Ron-bashing has some theories behind it. The most enduring one I&#39;ve seen is that he&#39;s not &quot;special&quot; the way Harry and Hermione are; Harry is the Boy Who Lived, the hero, the central figure, and Hermione is brilliant, pretty (they&#39;re usually going off Emma Watson&#39;s looks) and confident. Therefore, Harry is better than Ron because he&#39;s special, and Ron is ordinary and only bickers with her and is piggish (remember how much he likes his food?) and clearly does not deserve such a paragon of womanhood as Hermione. Essentially, Harry is the bigger prize because he&#39;s the hero and therefore Hermione must only ever settle for the bigger prize. But because canon says she and Ron love each other, people have to bash Ron to make Harry actually look like the more suitable partner and force Hermione into his arms.<br><br>Manipulative!Dumbledore is generally a way for people who want Harry to do his own thing <i>let</i> him do it. It&#39;s true that there was a fair bit of manipulation going on in the series by our twinkly-eyed Headmaster to get everything ready for the ultimate elimination of Voldemort - but it was done with good intentions. A lot of ficwriters ignore that, or blow it out of proportion, or twist it to make Dumbledore Teh Evulz so that Harry will break free and go on his merry way, building up his own power base and challenging people to gain even more power. Basically, it&#39;s to give Harry a power trip, because that&#39;s exactly what modest, unassuming, loving Harry really wants. Yup.<br><br>Hermione&#39;s parents being named Dan and Emma is just a bit of fandom meta, I guess - &quot;LOL, we&#39;ll name them after Harry and Hermione&#39;s actors, aren&#39;t we original and witty?&quot; seems to be the idea.<br><br>My apologies for the slight Wall O&#39;Text... I get verbose about the Potterverse.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m assuming I&#39;m doing this whole introduction thing right by just making a thread for it. I tried to check the Wiki and stuff to make sure, but couldn&#39;t find a definite yes or no.<br><br>So, yeah. Hi. My name is Xortberg, and I only recently found out the PPC was even a thing. As a perpetually grumpy anime fanboy who enjoys criticizing things, I feel as though the PPC was calling out to my very soul, so I&#39;m currently reading up on the Original Series and various pages on the Wiki so that when I get around to asking for permission to write, I&#39;ll hopefully be fully prepared.<br><br>Hmm... I really dig anime, as made evident in the above paragraph, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be most eager to talk about. I do have other interests, though! Like games. Or maybe some books, though with my massive, ever-growing list of anime I need to watch (which is literally impossible for me to make progress on, since every one I cross of the list makes way for three new shows that strike my fancy) means I don&#39;t often get around to reading all the things I should. I also like tabletop games like D&amp;D and other such shenanigans, even though I&#39;ve never gotten a chance to actually play any for any serious length of time.<br><br>I could probably ramble on about pointless things until I hit the 16 KB limit for text here, but I&#39;ll spare you guys the wall of text. If you wanna know anything else, I&#39;ll answer absolutely any questions. </p>

            <p>Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, Nekomonogatari Kuro (a 4 episode sort-of-movie), and now the strangely named Monogatari Series Second Season (despite it being the third full season).<br><br>And yeah, it&#39;s hella good. Really weird, though. I mean REALLY weird. But it&#39;s got a lot of great dialogue, really cool environments, and some wonderful music.

            <p>Yaaaay, Keyblade! Kingdom Hearts used to be my fandom of choice, so this pleases me.<br><br>Unfortunately, I&#39;ve never gotten around to watching any Bakugan stuff (though it is on the list!), so I&#39;d be hella lost. Perhaps I can make it my next priority, though. As for Pokemon, I really dig the world, but I absolutely hate Ash so I never watch the anime. Did watch that Pokemon Origins stuff, though, which was pretty freakin sweet.</p>

            <p>I would absolutely love to have Pokemon X, but I don&#39;t have a 3DS and lack the funds to get one. Woe is me. I&#39;d definitely go with X over Y, because Xerneas reminds me of the Deer God from Princess Mononoke.<br><br>And that&#39;s true. Origins NEEDS to be expanded on. Hell, they don&#39;t even have to ditch the cash cow anime they have right now. Just, give us something else. A full series in the style of Origins, or maybe an adaptation of the manga.

            <p>I can see us getting along nicely.<br><br>Ah, then there is still so much for you to explore. Beware, a lot of the spin-offs only have one or two missions before they cease entirely. Luckily, most of those that, at least in my opinion, are really good ones, have a sizable number of missions and interludes and the like, so you can see the more interesting characters in a much wider range of situations. Win-win. I would give a list of my personal spin-off recommendations, but a lot of my favorite PPC writers are still active(One even posted in this thread already. Hi, Herr Wozzeck!), so making that list would be a little awkward.<br>At least, it would be awkward for me. The other writers might not feel the same way about it.</p>

            <p>Yeah, there&#39;s a bit of history behind the name. I was just Xort for a while, which was inspired by some silly Kingdom Hearts parody video or something. I forget the details. Then, there was this really big argument going down on a forum I frequented, and I was on a Futurama kick, so I had someone change my name to Xortberg and changed my avatar to an angry Zoidberg picture. The whole argument got derailed by people commenting on it, and it stuck XD<br><br>As for fandoms I&#39;m into, I&#39;m not really big into any at the moment. I used to be WAAAAY into Kingdom Hearts, and even wrote some preeeetty bad fics of my own back in the day. Then I had a Digimon phase, but since then I haven&#39;t really settled. Maybe I&#39;ll find my place as I look for badfics to write about in the future.</p>

            <p>Madoka, Madoka, Madoka. Many, many manly tears were shed. I actually had no idea what I was getting into when I started it. I was just looking for a typical magical girl anime, because I was curious to see if they were all as bad as Sailor Moon, and the image I saw for Madoka looked cute. Figured it&#39;d be, at worst, just a mindless little adventure following cute anime girls fighting evil with the Powers of Love and Friendship.<br><br>Oh how wrong I was.</p>

            <p>Just a thought I&#39;ve had whilst trying to create a second Agent. in various books (and movies, although it&#39;s a lot easier in them) there are generally characters that whilst referenced once are never seen from or heard of again, but unlike minor characters aren&#39;t even given names to identify them. (for example in &#39;The Last Olympian&#39; Hermes says he has two daughters in LA however said daughters are never mentioned again, even (so far) in the Heroes of Olympus series. <br><br>What I&#39;m ultimately wondering is, could characters like the above mentioned demi-gods be recruited into the PPC (somehow, I don&#39;t know exact details) in a similar fashion to how Bit Characters from badfics can? <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>If you extend the definition of bit character a bit to just mean &quot;a person who lives in that continuum and never had a major role in the canon work&quot; then we&#39;ve got tonnes of agents like that, so in some cases I don&#39;t see why not. Thinking about it, my worry with that specific example is you&#39;re taking two minor canons who were never really given an identity by the author and forcing a fanon identity onto them, though.</p>

            <p>though I suggest that you take my suggestions with a grain of salt, since I don&#39;t even have Permission:<br><br>I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a problem with creating an agent with a backstory in established canon.

            <p>Well, maybe.<br><br>Basically, I&#39;ve got an idea--no, hey, come back here! No running!<br><br>So, my mom is in charge of a program for people who need or want to improve their English (mainly foreign students--this is university level, by the way), and she&#39;s always on the look-out for games she can use. Today she brought home some English Slang Cards that a colleague of hers had bought.<br><br>Yes, I&#39;m leading into something. Patience, young Padawan. What do you mean, you may be older than I am? Sit down, son, I&#39;m talkin&#39; here--yeah--no, <i>your</i> father was a hamster--oh yeah? You want a shrubbery? You want a shrubbery? Well, I&#39;m fresh out of shrubberies, only albatrosses left here--whaddaya mean, this isn&#39;t the time for a Monty Python quote-off? You can just--<br><br>...sorry, got carried away there.<br><br>Anyway. These slang cards...are ridiculous. I went through them and found only three cards that used current slang--and one or two of those choices were terms I wasn&#39;t actually sure so many people were using after all, when I thought about it. (Why did the colleague buy these, you ask? Well, they came sealed. She probably didn&#39;t realize). I made a number of other piles of cards, but that&#39;s not important right now (beyond the fact that &#39;jawn&#39; went into my small pile of absolutely hilarious cards--along with &#39;steeze&#39; and &#39;dunzo&#39;**), because I&#39;ve got an activity for you.<br><br>While I may eventually post pictures of some of these cards (for your amusement and to see if any of us actually use these--maybe I&#39;m limited by being uni-age and Canadian and some of them are actually popular), this moment&#39;s idea is as follows:<br><br>Name some slang terms (5-10, or more, or fewer--whatever you like, the numbers are just there for people who like having guidelines) that you use, and/or some that you hear the people around you using. Don&#39;t forget to give a definition and/or example, so we can all get an idea of what they mean and how they&#39;re used! The terms don&#39;t necessarily have to be in English--some English slang isn&#39;t composed of English words, and I also don&#39;t want this to be completely limited to people from English-speaking countries--but they should be terms you hear a lot. Feel free to comment on other people&#39;s posts saying if you&#39;ve heard, or haven&#39;t heard, some of the terms they&#39;ve posted!<br><br>My brain&#39;s a bit muddled right now from all the really old/potentially non-existent slang I&#39;ve been reading off the cards, but I&#39;ll do my best:<br><br>1. What&#39;s up?<br><i>Used as a greeting. Frustrating in that the answer can be &#39;fine&#39; or &#39;nothing&#39; and is not generally expected to really give any idea of what&#39;s actually going on.</i><br><br>2. Sayonara!<br><i>(Okay, fine, this isn&#39;t current. I&#39;m going to provide a mix of current and from-the-cards terms; feel free to throw in very old slang as well, just specify it as such.) A version of &#39;goodbye!&#39;, almost definitely originating in Japanese. According to my mother, it was popular around the 1940s and continued to be used into the 60s and 70s--mostly by people who had grown up or been born in the 40s, such as my grandmother. Something I wish would come back, as I rather like it.</i><br><br>3. Cool.<br><i>This means...cool. Um. Popular, awesome, wonderful, good. Sometimes used to indicate agreement, such as &#39;See you later, then.&#39; &#39;Cool, I&#39;ll be there.&#39; Has been around since at least the 1970s, possibly older.</i><br><br>4. Down [with it/that]. Also, &#39;I&#39;m cool with that.&#39;<br><i>Indicates agreement. According to the slang cards, it also means that you&#39;re cool; I&#39;ve never heard it used that way. If you say &#39;I&#39;m down with that&#39;, it means that you&#39;re okay to do something--argh! It means that you are willing, or would like, to do whatever&#39;s just been suggested. Look how much slang we use without realizing it!</i><br><br>5. Okay to do.<br><i>Similar to &#39;I&#39;m down/cool with that&#39;. If you say &#39;I&#39;m okay to go to the party&#39;...well, it means you&#39;re willing to go to the party. These latest three entries should have been listed together in one giant clump, shouldn&#39;t they...</i><br><br>6. [I&#39;m] fine.<br><i>&#39;Fine&#39; has a number of meanings, as I hear it used (and use it myself). If someone says, &#39;Hey, how are you?&#39; or &#39;Hey, what&#39;s up?&#39; you might reply with &#39;Fine&#39;--which, while a nice placeholder, really doesn&#39;t give anyone any idea of what&#39;s going on. My friend used to always repeatedly ask me &#39;how are you?&#39; until I gave her a proper reply (generally this was over the telephone). &#39;I&#39;m fine&#39; can also be used to mean &#39;no, thanks&#39;--as in, when someone says, &#39;Do you want more lasagna?&#39; and you reply &#39;No, I&#39;m fine[, thanks]&#39; or someone says, &#39;Want to go for a walk?&#39; and you reply, &#39;Nah, I&#39;m fine.&#39; You can probably tell that these two example exchanges happen between me and my mom...repeatedly...although I normally do go for more lasagna, which is very tasty.</i><br><br>I&#39;m going to end it here. Basically, give me a list of your favorite slang/the slang you&#39;re hearing/the slang you&#39;re really not hearing and wish you were/some awesome slang that&#39;s actually really, really old but worthy of a mention because it&#39;s amazing or hilarious/hilarious slang/something you&#39;ve seen somewhere that no one you know uses or has ever used and you think is insanely funny/just slang.<br><br>So, with all those options...go crazy!<br><br>Later,<br>~DF<br><br>--<br><br>**These words may be giving you a sense of just how outdated most of the slang on these cards is; whatever you&#39;re thinking, multiply it to include the majority of the deck.***<br><br>***If you actually use &#39;jawn&#39;, &#39;dunzo&#39;, or &#39;steeze&#39; as they&#39;re defined on the slang cards I&#39;ve got, sorry for calling your slang outdated. (It&#39;s still hilarious, though--especially &#39;jawn&#39;.)</p>

Can also be an accusation: &quot;Yo, watch it!&quot; Basically interchangeable with &quot;Hey!&quot;<br><br>- Chill, e.g. &quot;he&#39;s pretty chill,&quot; &quot;this scene is pretty chill&quot;<br><br>Variation on &quot;cool,&quot; generally meaning relaxed, easy-going.<br><br>- Sweet!, e.g. &quot;dude, that&#39;s sweet!&quot;, &quot;sweet moves, bro!&quot;<br><br>Basically synonymous with &quot;cool.&quot; See also &quot;sick,&quot; &quot;wicked,&quot; and (I&#39;m told) &quot;ill.&quot; See also also &quot;rad,&quot; if you&#39;re a dweeb from the <code>80s or so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Dweeb&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While we&#39;re on the subject... a dweeb is a socially inept, uncool person, much like a dork. Dweebs and dorks don&#39;t necessarily need to have the obsessively honed expertise and/or IQ of nerds and geeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Mad skills&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone with mad skills is really, really good at what they do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Killer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An intensifier. Can be positive or negative: &quot;killer moves,&quot; but &quot;killer workload.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Lame, bogus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uncool. Note that &quot;lame&quot; may be considered offensive and &quot;bogus&quot; may make you sound like a dweeb from the</code>80s or so.<br><br>- Right on!, rock on!<br><br>Approval, agreement.<br><br>- My ride, my wheels<br><br>Slipping into idiom a bit here, but these are pretty common expressions referring to a car or other personal vehicle. May be used with slang, e.g. &quot;sweet ride&quot; or &quot;sick wheels!&quot;<br><br>- This rocks!<br><br>This is great, awesome, exciting, the best. Can be escalated to &quot;this <i>totally</i> rocks!&quot; Also, &quot;this rocks my socks!&quot;<br><br>- This sucks!, this blows!, this bites!<br><br>Oddly enough, these are all the opposite of &quot;this rocks!&quot; &quot;This bites!&quot; usually stands alone, but the others have infinite variations: &quot;this sucks hardcore,&quot; &quot;this sucks balls/[unpleasant, inappropriate, and/or humorous thing]&quot;; &quot;this is sucktastic&quot;; &quot;this blows chunks/monkeys/[unpleasant, inappropriate, and/or humorous thing]&quot;, etc. Also, &quot;you suck!&quot; is common, but not &quot;you bite/blow!&quot; However, &quot;bite/blow me!&quot; is used... but I digress.<br><br>- Epic, epic win, epic fail<br><br>&quot;Epic&quot; has by now lost its original meaning and simply become an intensifier. An epic win is an impressive victory, accomplishment, or display of talent; an epic fail is an impressive display of stupidity, clumsiness, lack of talent, etc. Something described as simply &quot;epic&quot; is probably cool, awesome, sweet, etc.<br><br>- Screw-up, to screw up<br><br>Someone who just committed an epic fail probably screwed up. If they screw up a lot, they may <i>be</i> a screw-up.<br><br><br>... I think I&#39;ll stop there for now.

            <p>&quot;Dibs&quot; is still in use on this side of the pond, but I haven&#39;t run across &quot;shotgun&quot; as a synonym.

            <p>...and thankfully, the presentation makes the fanfic.<br><br>I&#39;ve sometimes wandered over to the comments sections of some more politically-inclined websites, and I do have to say that you hit it right on the nose in terms of the kinds of comments you might find there. Some of the comments were really crazy: in particular, I tended to roll my eyes at the religious idiot who <i>completely</i> misinterpreted one of the poleepkwan comments on choice as it refers to reproduction. I also loved how some of the less well-spelled comments come from the unintelligent people: as far as I&#39;m concerned, that tends to happen quite a lot on these websites. So reading this comment track was great.<br><br>And overall, I think it tapped into the wonderful world-building that made <i>District 9</i> such a great movie in the first place. It did a wonderful job of giving us a potential window into what the rest of the world might think, and it did so without hammering us in the face with a ton of exposition. That, good sir, is one of the <i>hardest</i> ways to build a world, and you hit every cue exactly right.<br><br>So overall, this was a really good fic. Well done!</p>

The vast majority of the mission was summary, with barely enough ficbit to qualify as a proper PPC mission.  <br><br>And yes, I get that End in Tears was less about the Suefic and more about the culmination of Anebrin&#39;s snapping, but I feel that you could indeed still have gotten that across even while showing a little more of the Suefic. I don&#39;t know: I get your intent, but at the same time I feel like your intent basically sacrificed the fic being sporked for the sake of character development, which is not something I feel should be done in a PPC mission.<br><br>I don&#39;t know.

            <p>I actually had a less emotional reaction to Ends In Tears. It felt sort of like the whole thing was on fast-forward, and you progressed though everything too fast. Since I don&#39;t know Agent!Des and Anebrin particularly well, I didn&#39;t have enough time to get emotionally invested in them. The ending in particular felt rushed.

            <p>The problem is, there are lots of ways to make names. Leaving aside the question of whether the character should be named in Quenya, Sindarin, or Sindarin-accented Quenya - or, indeed, Telerin, Doriathrin Sindarin, or Nandorin - you have the fact that the traditional Internet &#39;slam two words together&#39; method, while making technically valid names (sometimes), doesn&#39;t cover all the ways you <i>can</i> make names. Check out my <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=248947;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">mini-discourse on the name &#39;Eredan&#39;</a> for some of the complexities.<br><br>My general method is to check whether a name:<br>1/ Has the right letters, clusters, and general structure for the language it should be - so no, Sindarin named don&#39;t have terminal -es, and Quenya names don&#39;t finish in -n (usually).<br>2/ Can be made to be a combination of two or more words from the language in question. Elven names mean things.<br>3/ Don&#39;t mean something stupid.<br><br>Oh, and 0/ Aren&#39;t just random words from the languages. &#39;Aniron Sauron&#39;, anyone?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The &#39;lordly&#39; ending in Quenya, from all I can tell, is -on. It&#39;s one of the only non-vowel, non-r Quenya endings I know of, and I can&#39;t think of a whole lot of uses of it. Aldaron, as you say, but even the Sindarin names like Fingon and Turgon are actually from Findekano and Turukano. Soron, &#39;eagle&#39;, has the same -n (and I guess derives from something like sъrл-on, &#39;Wind-Lord&#39;).<br><br>Actually, -n can also be the ending for &#39;I&#39;, or -on can be (apparently) the genitive plural. But yeah, Quenya doesn&#39;t end in consonants too often... on the <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/wordlists.htm">Quenya Reverse Wordlist</a>, of the 77 pages:<br>-25 are words that end in -a<br>-20 are words ending in -e<br>-2 are words ending in -i (but a lot of plurals use this)<br>-5 ending in -o<br>-9 end in -r<br>-And the remaining 16 pages cover the other 21 letters of the alphabet (all right, Quenya lacks the letter B, but still...)<br><br>Yeah... Quenya <i>likes</i> certain letters.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Also, according to the Encyclopedia of Arda, Christopher Tolkien has since said that &#39;Aldaron&#39; was an outdated word he shouldn&#39;t have put in the published Silmarillion.

            <p>We never see what they actually <i>do</i>, only that Agents find them unpleasant. I&#39;m thinking they generate a powerful, jarring sense of deja vu, due to a small &quot;overlap&quot; during the switch in which everyone in the fic is currently <i>doing</i> whatever it is they do, and simultaneously has just <i>done</i> it. Repeated tense shifts might cause Agents to:<br><br>be uncertain about their own place in time (sanity-harming);<br><br>actually <i>become</i> partially unglued in time (imagine trying to hold a conversation with a partner who responds to everything you say half a second before you say it!);<br><br>develop uncanny knowledge of the immediate past or future (of course, if they try to act on it, the Ironic Overpower would ensure that it works only to their detriment).<br><br><br>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>I know that I&#39;ve interpreted tense shifts as causing nausea and headaches, due to the stress of a different paradigm being imposed on the mind and brain.

That is, I&#39;ve done something similar myself, on and off, and haven&#39;t quite figured out how to deal with it yet, beyond deciding I&#39;m doing what I can and that&#39;s that.

It just sometimes means that your lives have stopped intersecting for the foreseeable future, and that&#39;s something that&#39;s going to happen a lot over the course of your life; but that doesn&#39;t make things pointless, or meaningless, or not worth doing. And it doesn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t care about the friends you&#39;ve made and may no longer be keeping in touch with.<br><br>But that&#39;s just what I was told at one point (when the program was ending) by a very smart woman who was one of our main teachers.

            <p>It&#39;s really not something to worry about. A number of the people who&#39;ve been here for quite a long time have gone through phases of posting a lot, then disappearing and coming back (yours truly included).

            <p>We generally shouldn&#39;t be having a lot of canon characters with PPC knowledge. It can mess with the whole modus operandi of &quot;keeping the multiverse safe from threats it knows nothing about&quot;, and having the agents go into a badfic knowing beforehand that a potentially powerful character, in Pinkie Pie&#39;s case one of the main leads of the canon, is going to be on their side, seems to skew the basic set-up of hard-won victories and sanity only kept intact by snark and distractions.<br>Having Jack Harkness on the list is bad enough, since not only is he a main lead in Torchwood, he&#39;s usually immortal. Plus, I have no idea why he&#39;s even there. Does his brain heal from the effects of neuralyzation? That doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense, since the logical extension of that would mean he can&#39;t forget anything, and we know that isn&#39;t true. Whatever. There&#39;s too much precedent to remove him anyway, so... moving on.<br><br>A new canon character should really be added to the list if there are complications, for example if the character is all-knowing in-canon. Omniscience is a big complication, since it means the character can&#39;t be neuralyzed, which is why Aslan and Madoka are on the list. Doc Scratch, from Homestuck, would probably be up there as well, since he&#39;s not only nigh-omnipotent and omniscient, but he doesn&#39;t have any eyes to flash the light in.<br>Fourth-wall sight equalling knowledge of the PPC would make for a cognizant character in every third continuum or so, and since the fourth-wall-breakers usually tend to be less attached to sanity than their compatriots, that would create a scenario constantly on the precipice of spiraling horribly out of control. I don&#39;t think anyone would want that.</p>

            <p>In this case, Pinkie knows about Mary Sues, Agents, the PPC, all of that... When it is funny for her to do so. Afterwards, she completely forgets about them.

            <p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to continue your chemistry analogy, but here&#39;s what I know:<br><br>There are three kinds of crossovers - the two you mentioned, and the type I call &quot;Holodeck&quot; - basically, one continuum is kept fictional and someone in the other continuum is a fan. Some continua play well in certain types and not in others. Some continua play very well with others. <br><br>There are three levels: Plays Well With Others, Plays With Friends, and Plays Best Alone. <br><br>Examples:<br><br><b>Plays Well With Others:</b><br><br><i>Star Trek</i><br><br>There are three reasons:<br><br>1.  Random weird things in space that connect to other dimensions<br>2. Holodecks<br>3. Time Travel<br><br>The risk is that your continuum really wouldn&#39;t appeal to any characters, and the others can be overused. Star Trek doesn&#39;t play as well with magical continua, but I&#39;ve found that if you explain something in a way that sounds vaguely scientific it fits with the universe. They literally managed to justify turning some characters into kids. <br><br>Of note is that Next Gen and Voyager play well with MLP:FiM, because DisQord.<br><br><i>Doctor Who</i><br><br>This is the most friendly continuum I have found, because it involves a device that can literally go anywhere in time and space. The risk, again, is that it can be overused. <br><br><b>Plays With Friends:</b><br><br><i>Harry Potter</i><br><br>Harry Potter plays well with other magical continua, especially others set in World One, like Percy Jackson. Unless the laws of that universe directly contradict the laws of Potter-verse, it can work. It&#39;s not particularly compatible with sci-fi due to the canonical &quot;magic and tech don&#39;t mix&quot; rule.<br><br><i>Sherlock</i><br><br>It plays well with other continua set in World One, and has enough outlandishness to let fantastical continua like Potter or Avengers meld with it. Better with sci-fi than Potter, but the sci-fi continuum has to be the one providing the means of transportation to the other continuum.<br><br><b>Plays Best Alone:</b><br><br><i>Lord of the Rings</i><br><br>It&#39;s not possible to share a setting, and there aren&#39;t really ways for characters to leave the universe. I used to think the elves were sailing to some vague nondescript place that could be another continuum *cough* Vulcan *cough*, but I seem to recall reading somewhere that their destination is actually specified. In order to get characters there, you need your other continuum to be a friendly one.<br><br><br>It&#39;s important to remember that &quot;holodeck&quot; type is very easy as long as:<br>-The other continuum would actually appeal to the characters of the other continuum. For example, a Star Trek/BBC Sherlock crossover of this type is plausible, while a Star Trek/Twilight crossover is not.<br>-It would be possible for that fiction to exist in universe. For example, Star Trek characters can play LOTR on the holodeck, but LOTR characters can&#39;t watch Star Trek. <br><br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got. SCIENCE!!!</p>

            <p>IF you are going to find anything in this fandom, good or bad, you go to <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/">FIMfiction</a>. While I should brave the Pit more often for ponies while looking for badfic, I know this site is where everybody posts their fanfics about ponies. Anyway, if you want to find Star Trek crossovers, I would start at <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/group/1191/star-trek-ponies"> this online group made for Star Trek crossovers.</a> Mostly it is if the crew of the Enterprise were ponified, but there are others. Are the fics any good? Some of them are... less then favorable, but surly there are some good ones here! Personally, I have never looked for any Star Treck crossovers before now, but you feel free to see for yourself. <br><br>Hey, speaking of pony crossovers, you know what everybody here needs to read, like, right now? <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/400/binky-pie"> Binky Pie </a>, a crossover with Discworld. While it is unfinished, this fic is one of the best crossovers I have ever read, and I have read several crossovers. Pinkie Pie becomes the new steed of Death after Binky retires to Equestria. Why Pinkie Pie? Well, read it and find out! (A big hint is in the title.)</p>

            <p>So continuing the chemistry analogy, the Plays Well With Anyone and Plays Well With Most Others types would be the most reactive elements, the Plays With Friends are less reactive, and the Plays Best Alone are Noble Gases?<br><br>Also, I think the Holodeck type is stretching it as a crossover...</p>

            <p>Referencing another continuum isn&#39;t a crossover, but I think if the character&#39;s fandom is the focus of the story, to the point where you have to know both continua to understand the story, then it&#39;s a crossover or should be marked as such.<br><br>Personally, it&#39;s my favorite crossover method to write because it&#39;s fun to have characters being fans of things the way you&#39;re a fan of them.</p>

            <p>MLP is in the &quot;Plays Well With Others&quot; category or in the Plays with Friends category, depending on how you do it.<br><br>Crossover fics that involve simply turning all characters into MLP-style ponies are &quot;Plays well with others&quot;--because you can do that to almost any universe. Even Lord of the Rings is plausible.<br><br>But if you are keeping not just the species of MLP but also the universe, then it will only fit in some continua. Equestria would fit nicely as a lost island in the world of Narnia, for example. Or a planet in a sci-fi world that has just enough quasi-magical power to make it plausible.<br><br>There ought to be a category for &quot;Plays with Anyone&quot;, though. Some worlds can literally accommodate anything, even the most isolated and specific worlds. It&#39;s a small category, but it exists, and it&#39;s mostly metafiction. The PPC verse is one such continuum. Thursday Next is even more extreme; it includes not just published stories but manuscripts that the authors have kept secret, and it once went into an instruction manual for household appliances. Anywhere that has extreme cross-reality travel qualifies.</p>

            <p>Because it&#39;s fun.<br><br>OK, I think this needs a little more explanation. With ponies specifically, the nature of pony physiology makes things much more interesting to cross over. Specifically: technology without hands, pony colorization, pony species, and cutie marks. Imagine the world of Fallout, but with ponies. Well, that sounds strange, but it is interesting to think about because of these factors (less colorization for fic, but the other three stand). How are guns used without fingers to fire them? What would the cutie marks be for assorted characters? After all, cutie marks are a visual symbolism of what makes you special, of who you are. What advantages and disadvantages of each species lead to variety that humans just don&#39;t have in the other worlds? Unicorns have magic, and the ability to use things more or less like we do. Pegasi can fly and manipulate weather. Earth ponies are stronger and have a deeper connection to the earth. What would different characters be like if they were any of these races?  All of these variables make ponification much more interesting as a concept then most other fandom conversions.<br><br>Well, that and some fans are just way too attached to multi-colored horses. Now, if you will excuse me, I have to get back to my Avatar: The Last Airbender ponification fic.</p>

            <p>If you find it annoying, that may be mostly because of its omnipresence. It is a rather sturdy continuum with good writing and well-rounded characters, and if it had stayed a show for kids instead of exploding into a much bigger fan base, no one would have any complaints about its quality.<br><br>There are much more annoying things that this could have happened to. What if MLP were a poorly-written, cliched world with flat characters and lots of plot holes? I think that would be a hundred times worse.<br><br>I&#39;m not a particular fan, but I do enjoy the occasional episode if someone happens to link me to it, and I&#39;ve read some fan fic. It may be obnoxious to some people because of how widespread a phenomenon it is and how everything&#39;s getting turned into ponies--but it could be a lot worse.</p>

            <p>Seems to me our definition of a badfic is kind of impossible. DF is at its core a fantasy-world generator, which essentially means any &quot;fics&quot; written in that continuum are more like original fics in a setting created by the game. Unless we&#39;re talking fics of stories and Let&#39;s Plays like Boatmurdered.</p>
