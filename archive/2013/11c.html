            <p>For this occasion, I shall break out a skill I actually do have: wood carving!<br><br>For Pretzel, I bestow a sculpted replica of the Serenity.

            <p>It&#39;s a nice little story with some good character moments (like the Lichen twitching his rock), but I can&#39;t help but feel a bit disappointed that you didn&#39;t keep the quirks I gave Admiral Pansy <a href="http://vgdivision.dreamwidth.org/2599.html">here</a>.

            <p>The reason is that I&#39;d never even seen that mission - it&#39;s outside my fandoms. As far as I was aware, Admiral Pansy had never actually appeared on-screen. Looks like I ought to have checked the Wiki...<br><br>Anyhow. I&#39;m reading his &#39;Britishness&#39; as mostly an exaggerated act (it slips a bit in the middle of that mission), but can definitely rework to put it in. (Although some of the things he says physically hurt - particularly &#39;lads and lassies&#39;, that&#39;s... just weird. He&#39;s never been to England, has he?)<br><br>hS, off to rewrite</p>

            <p>It seemed to me that Admiral Pansy was in something of a bad mood during Minor Gods. I imagine he&#39;d have more of the interjected British mannerisms and general enthusiasm when he was feeling a tad more chipper, as he&#39;d put it. Admittedly, it was still a little jarring for me to see him given the same basic personality as the Big Thorn here, since my only experience of the Admiral Pansy came from your mission.<br><br>Another thing that I didn&#39;t quite get: what exactly was the &quot;Hole&quot; that the Big Thorn kept referring to? I might have thought he was referring to a plot hole, or maybe the holes dug in the ground to allow saplings to be planted, but the use of the phrase &quot;Hole knows&quot; implies that Hole is some sort of actual entity capable of thought, at least in the mind of the Big Thorn. Was there a well-respected Flower or Origin mythological entity that was known as Hole?<br>Does anyone know?</p>

            <p>This was a nice, simple piece to read over dinner!  You&#39;ve got so many little details to show that this conversation takes place between psychic plants: the &quot;food,&quot; the mental gestures, the way they talk about humanoid agents--even the server&#39;s lack of description, like they aren&#39;t even on the Flowers&#39; minds.  (Might like to hear a bit about the waitstaff at some point, though.)<br><br>I hope the &quot;future Plot&quot; bit was about Selene Windflower disappearing!  I&#39;ve always thought she was cool, even though I wasn&#39;t around reading her during her &quot;active years.&quot;  In general, it&#39;s nice to see less frequently-used agents and departments get mentioned and discussed.<br><br>One nitpick: I assume the League mentioned at the end is AHAIRQL, in which case it should be spelled Quiddich, not Quidditch. </p>

            <p>And adding to that, I&#39;m not entirely familiar with the Naruto continuum, and haven&#39;t seen much MST3K(though I&#39;ve watched enough derivative videos/read enough fan-inspired works to know how riffing works).<br><br>But from what I did see, it wasn&#39;t <i>all</i> bad. There were some funny moments, like the &quot;When did it take it? Last poker night?&quot; line at the beginning, and the &quot;Unlike the gates of the town, which were unlocked and wide open.&quot; bit on one of the later pages, and you seemed to have the back-and-forth of the dialogue down pretty well in most places, but it did have its problems.<br><br>One problem I noticed: a lot of references that didn&#39;t add to the momentum or humor. Some of them weren&#39;t even entirely necessary, like the Starcraft reference that you immediately explain(references are usually intended as shorthand for certain concepts in this context, so if it&#39;s something that&#39;s <i>easy</i> to explain, the reference wouldn&#39;t have been needed at all) and a lot of others were obscure or confusing.<br>For an example of the latter, I had to look up what the Horseman&#39;s Word was on Google while I was reading the MST to get the joke that involved it, and now I&#39;m just confused as to why you assumed that most of your readers would be in the know on Scottish secret societies from the 1800s. By the time I was done wondering, any humor that the joke might have had was dissipated. There were a few other references you made that I couldn&#39;t even find Wikipedia pages for, and I&#39;m still lost on what the joke was on those. Like with &quot;Pixy Gale&quot;. All I was given from the Google search on that was the information that it was a manga, as well as a few pictures attached to the top of the search screen(unprompted, mind you; I had intended on a Web search) that made me contemplate clearing my browser history.<br><br>Another thing: you talk about the canonical details just, at length. Since I don&#39;t know the continuum very well, that stands out to me even more. A riffing, as I know it at least, tends to have several brief humorous moments that react to specific flaws in logic, individual lines and/or dialogue to mock, what have you. True, in the video formats I&#39;m most familiar with, it&#39;s kept brief to keep from covering up anything else the riffers would like to mock, but it&#39;s a good principle in general.<br>Talking about canonical details, while helpful in determining what the story does wrong, isn&#39;t really that entertaining. That&#39;s why it&#39;s best for recounting what just happened to occur in short bursts, interspersed with jokes, reactions, puns, what have you. I spent most of those asides looking for some sort of comedic payoff, or punchline, or running gag, or something, but nothing came up. Look at the page right after the &quot;Chapter 2&quot; heading to see what I mean there. I&#39;m not going to copy the whole dialogue here, because I made my point and that would be too many extra words.<br>Addendum to this: Dragging something on too long, even if it&#39;s a joke anyone can understand, will make it less funny. This didn&#39;t crop up a lot here, but given this writing style, it&#39;s something to watch out for.<br><br>Oh, and one last thing. You explain a lot of the jokes. Cut that out. I had actually briefly laughed aloud at &quot;Poor Foot. He was a good man once.&quot;, and then you went and explained it in the next few lines, roping in more canonical details in the process, and I could feel the laugh die in my lungs. It kind of stung. Sometimes you just have to let a joke stand on its own grounds. You even mention this problem in the dialogue at one point, but don&#39;t do anything about it.<br><br>I was going to say something else, but now that I&#39;m at this point, I&#39;ve forgotten what it was. Oh, well. This post is long enough as it is.</p>

            <p>Ooh, thank you!  It&#39;s wonderful to get lots of feedback about what we&#39;re doing wrong.  I&#39;ll see what we can do about fixing those in future chapters.  Since we were primarily waiting for negative feedback, we&#39;ll probably start on the next chapter soon.  Again, thank you for being so clear!

            <p>That&#39;s fine!  Just feedback is very welcome - did you find it funny, or was it just clichй and boring?  You don&#39;t have to be good at MSTing to know whether or not you liked a piece, and even an &quot;I didn&#39;t like it but I&#39;m not sure why&quot; tells us something we don&#39;t know about our writing.  Suggestions are lovely, but all feedback is very welcome.  Thanks for the reply and the suggestion!</p>

There is just one problem: I can&#39;t end it. I don&#39;t mean that I just keep going and going without end, I mean that I cannot think of a satisfying ending to it. Nothing I do  feels right, but I want to get this thing done so I can move on to the second mission and finally start this story arc that I have planned. Its been, what, eight months since I started this thing? Too long is the point. So, I&#39;m asking for help. <br><br>If you want to help, just respond with your email, and I&#39;ll send a copy of the mission and the badfic being killed. While helping with the ending, if you would not mind reading over the rest of the story and proof-read it too, I would be ever so thankful. Seeing as Marvin and Printworthy are in the All-Purpose, MLP department,  knowledge of Friendship is Magic would be a good idea.<br><br>Thank you so much for helping a guy out. I promise, the second mission will go over much smoother then this one did. I hope.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m posting this at the request of one of our lurkers, who contacted me by e-mail and wishes to remain otherwise anonymous. I figured I&#39;d put it here and see if anyone knows this fandom rather than just sticking it on the wiki to rot if no one&#39;s even potentially interested.<br><br>The fic is &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9643826/1/Night-Rain">Night Rain</a>&quot; by laughtillyourstomachhurts. Our lurker friend reports the following issues:<br><br>- Chapter 1 OC description:<br><br>Sound like an extra powerful Mary Sue to me, with a weird and generally useless power (changing eye colours) other than just frightening the regular humans.<br><br>- Chapter 2:<br><br>The OC (Amaya Kuran) reads the actual <i>Vampire Knight</i> manga, and then attends school there. This appears to be a merging of the OC&#39;s world and <i>Vampire Knight</i>&#39;s. I don&#39;t quite know how to explain this.<br><br>- Chapter 3:<br><br>Bashing of <i>Vampire Knight</i>&#39;s heroine, Yuuki Kuran. It seems that the OC does this on purpose since she had already read the actual <i>Vampire Knight</i> comic and knows how Yuuki feels towards Kuran Kaname and spites her on purpose.<br><br>- Chapter 4 and the rest:<br><br>Generally speaking, getting cozy with other vampires. Which shouldn&#39;t even be happening, rendering vampire characters OOC.<br><br>Even if Yuuki Kuran is annoying (I don&#39;t think so, there&#39;s so many other character that are more annoying than her), I don&#39;t think that she deserves this sort of treatment.<br><br>---<br><br>Any takers, have at it!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve watched it, but I remember liking it, and I have been hoping to send my agents into some anime continua.<br><br>Let&#39;s have a look at what this Sue&#39;s like then...<br><br>Wow, OK, that is one hell of a Sue. The super-speshul colour changing eyes are possibly one of the <i>least</i> Sueish aspects of this character. The highlights include: <br><br>- controls all 4 elements (now, maybe it&#39;s just that I haven&#39;t watched the anime in a while, but I don&#39;t remember there being elemental magic in this continuum)<br>- make you bend to her will (well she sounds <i>lovely</i>)<br>- telekinesis<br>- can make someone live forever (maybe it&#39;s just me, but that &#39;make&#39; someone live forever almost sounds like a threat)<br>- can fly (of course she can)<br>- force field<br>- deflect anything (anything, you say? That sounds like a challenge and/or an excuse for some scientific testing)<br>- hyper and weird (oh yay! another &#39;quirky&#39; character)<br>- manipulates people for fun (I repeat - she sounds <i>lovely</i>)<br>- sadistic when you least expect her to be (... what!? Sadistic when you <i>least</i> expect it - so, at a small child&#39;s birthday party or something? I really hope we&#39;re not going to be expected to empathise with this character...)<br><br>As for the actual fic itself, I&#39;d have to refresh myself on the canon before I could comment on that aspect of it, but from the purely technical side it doesn&#39;t look good. There&#39;s a lot of short, choppy sentences that really break the flow of reading, and some <i>very</i> odd descriptions. Apparently, people&#39;s blood tastes like &#39;apples and cinnamon&#39;... y&#39;know what? I&#39;m pretty sure that it doesn&#39;t. <br><br>I won&#39;t claim this myself just yet, because I&#39;ve got a list of fics for my next few missions, and I&#39;m not finding much time for writing at the minute. If someone else gets to it first, they&#39;re welcome to it. But if it&#39;s still unclaimed when I next go looking for badfic, then I just might have to do something with this. </p>

            <p>Hello, I&#39;m WolfsbaneX. I am a Power Rangers fanfiction writer that specializes in Original Ranger Teams (taking the concept of the show and creating a entire story from scratch: I make my own rangers, concepts, Zords, villains, supporting cast). I&#39;m also a fan of Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, Garo, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Digimon (up to season 4), and a bunch of other stuff I can&#39;t think of off the top of my head. I hope I can contribute to the community and eventually write my own PPC story.</p>

            <p>Wow, you like many of the same shows I do!

            <p>Pokemon is one of the fandoms I&#39;m a part of (though I&#39;m quick to point out that I just play the games; I haven&#39;t watched the anime since the beginning of Black and White). Bakugan, eh, I liked the first one and the second one. After that, it seemed to become a jumbled mess.<br><br>1. I have a friend who&#39;s a fan of the PPC.<br>2. Yes, I have read the constitution.<br>3. I haven&#39;t quite read all of it yet.

            <p>Have a pair of Chrono Sabers from Power Rangers Time Force! It was one of the better seasons, if my admittedly sparse knowledge of Power Rangers is anything to go by, and the swords themselves are capable of shooting beams of energy when held in &quot;the position of clock arms at 3:00&quot;, according to the wiki.<br>I&#39;m not entirely sure what that means(maybe you hold one arm out to the side and swing the other vertically to use the beam?), but even if you don&#39;t know, either, they&#39;re still nice-looking swords that cause sparks and explosions when you hit things with them, as is standard for all Power Rangers weaponry. Long live the Power!</p>

I do not find them attractive in that way, and the use of sex in any literature is a massive personal sin. Unless it is used <i>really</i> well, I do not like it. Now, with that out of the way:<br><br>I have glanced into the void of clopfics. I took a look on a dare, as well as reading some MST&#39;s on Ponyriffs, and I have found some of the worst things ever composed. I would not care if some of these were edited to become completely original works, they need to be burned. Here are just some of the more...interesting ones.<br><br>I&#39;m not gonna bother with ratings, as they are all very NSFW, and possibly NSFB. Gore, sex, you name it, we got it here. Here, let me say it again so there is absolutely no confusion:<br><br><b><i><u>THESE ARE ALL NOT SAFE FOR WORK. THESE ARE ALL NOT SAFE FOR SANE MINDS. DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE NOT READY TO SEE THINGS YOU PROBABLY SHOULD NOT.</u></i></b><br><br><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/27325/Apple-Slices"> Apple Slices </a> A clopfic between Applejack, Big Mac, and Apple Bloom. Notable not only for how it throws the Apples OOC, but Applebloom&#39;s cutiemark. No, it does not have to do with sex. It has to do with...De-sexing, if you catch my drift. By the end of this, you will know far more about the process of castration then you ever, EVER, wanted to know.<br><br><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/36981/120-days-of-blueblood"> 120 Days of Blueblood. </a> Have you ever heard of 120 days of Sodom? No? Neither did I when I read the MST of this. Well, part of the MST of this, as the fic is so NSFW that it made me too sick before I could finish. I went a piece at a time, but had to stop eventually. Apparently, 120 days of Sodom is an infamous french book that was never officially published, as the text follows people who engage in insane orgies, rape, and pedophilia. At the end of the intercourse, those who were raped are brutally murdered. Take that, make it with ponies, and you have quite possibly the worst thing ever made.<br><br>You know what? I was going to link more, but I cant bring myself to dispose more onto this board. I feel dirty enough as is. If you want more examples, just look at anything riffed by Fallen Prime, <a href="http://ponyriffs.weebly.com/fp-riffs.html">HERE</a> or just about any fic riffed by anybody on the Ponyriffs site <a href="http://ponyriffs.weebly.com/">HERE.</a><br><br>Now, if you excuse me, I have to go and soak in some holy water and read some good books to detoxify myself from these...things.</p>

            <p>Hey, I&#39;m working on my first mission (see fic link below). The fic seems to either have been written by two people with incredibly similar writing styles or one person who only gets half their chapters Beta&#39;d. <br>The problem is in the even chapters, where elves become elleths and the occasional elf becomes an elleth. What Charge does this fall under? I&#39;m tempted to put it under a general Spelling Error, but I&#39;m not sure if it would create a Mini or not.<br><br>My other problem is potentially unique, instead of describing their clothing to the minutest detail there is literally no description of their clothing at all, besides the fact we&#39;re told they&#39;re wearing some. Does this mean they are covered in a Generic Material (or something like that) which would become a Charge or what?<br><br>badfic:  <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6272813/1"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6272813/1">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6272813/1</a></a>   </p>

            <p><i>Elleth</i> is Sindarin for a female elf. The male version is <i>ellon</i>. However, the plurals are <i>ellith</i> and <i>ellyn</i>, respectively, so &quot;elleths&quot; is incorrect.

            <p>&#39;Elleth&#39; is Sindarin for &#39;female elf&#39; (you may already know this?). I think the masculine equivalent is &#39;ellon&#39;, but that&#39;s not used very much in stories. I <i>think</i> the author doesn&#39;t want to say &#39;women&#39; about a pair of elves - similar to not wanting to call Haldir a man, even though, as a male humanoid, the term applies reasonably well - so tries to use the Sindarin.<br><br>Unfortunately, &#39;elleths&#39; is absolutely <i>not</i> how &#39;elleth&#39; would pluralise. My Sindarin is a bit rusty, but <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/sindarin.htm#vow-e">Ardalambion</a> seems to suggest &#39;ellith&#39;. Good luck getting that past English speakers. ;)<br><br>I&#39;d charge it for &#39;abusing Elvish languages&#39;, myself. When I asked a few months ago, I was told misspelled canon-language words (such as Sindarin terms) do <i>not</i> make a mini: they&#39;re just a mistake.<br><br>Which allows me to continue a long-running gag of mine: the mini-Word. Mini-Words are formed by things that wouldn&#39;t normally make a mini, in a situation where they clearly would. The first one to be observed was Aaragog - which came from a misspelling of the term &#39;mini-Aragog&#39;. He looks like this:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/mini-Typo.png"><br><br>Of course, as was pointed out, that typo would just make a mini-Aragog of its own, albeit a rather meta one, so he doesn&#39;t exist.<br><br>The second was a badfic which misspelled the Sindarin word &#39;aen&#39; as &#39;sen&#39; (it&#39;s in the first line of the FotR prologue). Here she is looking rather tragic in the Mode of Beleriand:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Sen.png"><br><br>Of course, as just discussed, Sindarin typos don&#39;t make minis, so sen doesn&#39;t exist either.<br><br>And neither does &#39;elleths&#39;, the remarkably English mini-Word who would otherwise look like this:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/elleths.png"><br><br>(Yes, she smokes a pipe. Why does that surprise you?)<br><br>In summary: mini-Words don&#39;t exist. But if they did, &#39;elleths&#39; would be one, and would be an adorable pipe-smoking string of runes.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Assuming that&#39;s the general rule and not an exception, that&#39;s remarkably similar to Hebrew plurals. Which is weird, because Khuzdul is supposed to be similar to Hebrew, not Sindarin (which is sorta like Welsh, IIRC; Quenya&#39;s Finnish).</p>

            <p>Well, this weekend was exciting for fandoms. The Day of the Doctor aired, season four of My Little Pony premiered, and Hunger Games: Catching Fire has its opening weekend. Yes, I know it opened on Thursday, but it still counts! So, in light of all this stuff, I want to know people&#39;s thoughts on these three events. How did they go? Were they any good? Was it fun? Tell us all!<br><br>Now, if you excuse me, I have to get to work. It&#39;s 1:40 now, and I have been going around having fun since 5:30. Got to live stream the pony premiere, and watch the Day of the Doctor in a theater for free. It was very, very fun.</p>

            <p>I found it rather interesting. Very hilarious. It&#39;s written and directed by Peter Davison, who played the Fifth Doctor. They managed to drag Sir Ian McKellan and Peter Jackson in, too, y&#39;know, because Sylvester McCoy plays Radagast <s>on a bunny sled</s> in <s>The Fangirl Magnet That Used To Be</s> The Hobbit. And I suppose it&#39;s something to do with Sir Ian providing the voice of the Great Intelligence in <i>The Snowmen</i> too.<br><br>~Autumn</p>

            <p>I liked the bit where the three &quot;Doctors&quot; produced their John Barrowman CDs to get admitted into the Doctor Who Experience. That one was, as we all say, &quot;lol&quot;. <br><br>It saddens me that some fans doesn&#39;t even know what Classic Who is. Eg. Ashley from OFWho by Kittythekatty (a fictional example, but there must be fangirls like her in the Real World).

            <p>...but I am making plans to see Catching Fire with my mom... next weekend.<br><br>If I believe the critical buzz, it&#39;s that Catching Fire the movie is even better than the original Hunger Games movie. I mean, the first movie was really only competent, but it sounds like Catching Fire is really good. I&#39;m personally looking forward to it as Catching Fire is my personal favorite book of the whole trilogy, and I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing Jennifer Lawrence on screen again.<br><br>Also, Season 4 of MLP is something I&#39;ll need to get to.

            <p>How would they determine which network/venue showed which version? They couldn&#39;t just transmit it to random stations with a fifty-fifty chance of either one showing up on any given television, because that&#39;s not how television transmission works. I suppose they could have one version on television and another on Internet livestreaming, but the former would probably massively outweigh the latter, and the gimmick would be not only lost, but figured out almost immediately.<br><br>And which would be canon? Both? It couldn&#39;t be both, because the retroactive resurrection of the Time Lords means that they will almost certainly be showing up again in future seasons, especially since Gallifrey not being blown up means the Master is still alive, while destroying Gallifrey on-screen more or less voids all chance of seeing any Time Lords again ever, unless one or two TARDIS out in the last few seconds before the time lock hits and renders that impossible. And if it was decided to be ambiguous which was the canon version, then nobody would even be able to <i>mention</i> the Time Lords again in future episodes, because the Doctor&#39;s response to that mention would be radically different depending on what happened, and we&#39;d miss out on one of the bigger parts of the Doctor&#39;s personal lore.<br><br>If that was a &quot;just for fun&quot; hypothetical instead of an &quot;I wonder what would happen if they did this&quot; hypothetical, then I apologize for ruining said fun.<br><br>Oh, and speaking of retroactivity, Gallifrey not being destroyed finally closes a plot hole in the &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; reveal from Ten&#39;s era. Namely, how would the Face of Boe have known about the Master?<br><br>It was presented as though, despite the Time Lords travelling across all of time and all of space, the only &quot;actually alive&quot; ones left were the Doctor and the Master, the latter of whom was disguised as a human at the end of the universe, hidden in such a way that not even the past selves of the Time Lords couldn&#39;t detect him. How would the Face of Boe know he was there? We can&#39;t say that he would have had information from when the Master was running around Earth in the 21st century, because all of the Master&#39;s activity was wiped from history when his paradox machine was destroyed, which also wipes out all possibility of the Face simply remembering that information from his time as Jack Harkness(if we&#39;re going with the Jack-is-the-Face-of-Boe route here and not the the-Face-of-Boe-is-a-member-of-a-different-species route), since Jack was the one who destroyed it and was right next to it when the temporal reboot happened, so we can&#39;t say he would have escaped its effects.<br><br>But, if most of the Time Lords are still alive, the Face wouldn&#39;t have needed to know about the Master. He could have just heard about the true fate of Gallifrey at some point in his long, long life, as well as the Doctor&#39;s belief that Gallifrey was destroyed, and then tried to use his last seconds to tell the Doctor what really happened. Of course, all he got out before his death were four cryptic words, but that falls true no matter what he was talking about, whether it would have been a warning about the Master or a message of hope about Gallifrey.</p>

            <p>Alright, always wanted a scale model of Vaes Dothrak! It even has the ashes of foreign enemies falling upon it.<br><br>As for why I call myself that, it started when I decided to shed off an earlier moniker I had and start fresh on the internet, after a string of poor decisions and bad writing.

            <p>1: I ran across the PPC around 2009, during a crawl of the TVTropes Wiki. I thought the idea was interesting, but never actually joined up, and gradually forgot its existence until, oh... a week ago. I have been lurking up until this point.<br><br>2: I have read and fully understand the Constitution, however, I am only 2/5 through the Original Series. &#39;Tis slow-going.</p>

            <p>The picture reminded me of Cumberbatch, but that&#39;s probably because of the moustache. But Tom Hiddleston is as much a fangirls-magnet as Cumberbatch, so the point remains the same. (And that sounded a bit flippant; they are both amazingly talented actors, who just happen to be knicker-dropping dreamboats.)<br><br>Anyway, the hypothetical badfics wouldn&#39;t be about Tolkien himself (the PPC also has a policy against doing missions in real-person fanfics, though I can&#39;t recall the details) but about a fictionalized version of him if that&#39;s any comfort?</p>

            <p>In fact, odds are I&#39;d be twice as annoyed--I greatly admire the real Tolkien, and if the fictionalized version were to have fangirls, he&#39;d probably be pretty likable, meaning that I&#39;d probably like him too, and so the protectiveness would be amplified--real Tolkien plus fictionalized Tolkien, the second of which one could feel a little closer to...yeah.

            <p>...is that Professor Tolkien had the students write a story in about an hour, perhaps more, perhaps less. While most students thought about something to write about, some could not.

            <p>It might help to note here that Tolkien wasn&#39;t marking <i>his own</i> students at all. To earn a bit of extra income, he took the job of marking essentially random papers over the summer. I believe he did this for quite a few years. It was one of the unused sheets from a paper he was marking that he scribbled that line on. (Interestingly, a fair amount of his manuscript work was done on exactly those spare bits of paper. Makes you wonder if he partly took the job for the office supplies...)<br><br>Ah, here we go:<br><br>&quot;On a blank leaf I scrawled: &#39;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&#39; I did not and do not know why.&quot; - Tolkien, letter to W.H. Auden, dated 1955<br><br>Another version:<br><br>It was on a summer’s day in the 1930s, and he was sitting by the window in his study, laboriously marking School Certificate exam papers. Years later he recalled: “One of the candidates had mercifully left one of the pages with no writing on it (which is the best thing that can possibly happen to an examiner), and I wrote on it: &#39;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&#39; Names always generate a story in my mind. Eventually I thought I’d better find out what hobbits were like. But that’s only the beginning.” <a href="http://hmhbooks.com/hmh/site/hobbit/home/bio">Source</a><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well... I haven&#39;t heard of the Charlie Chaplin movie, and I live with members of the fangirl genus, though no extremely dedicated RJD fans. (We&#39;ve got Thor girls, Hiddleston girls, Whovians, and Agents of Sheild girls on my floor.) Take that news as you will.<br><br>... I dunno, I think the Sherlock Holmes movies have mostly had their fandom moved or stolen and absorbed into BBC&#39;s Sherlock. We&#39;re putting on our helmets for the January premiere of season 3, so the fandom was having a bit of a silly season all fall. :D</p>

            <p>He&#39;s almost done refurbishing his space station, but he needs to tighten a few of the outside bolts so that his kitchen doesn&#39;t fly off mid-orbit. The problem is that the bolts are all septagonal for a reason that no one at the hardware store can fathom, so none of the wrenches or other tightening apparatuses he has at home will work. He&#39;d heard the Board was a place where strange and unusual objects were commonly excavated from crowded closets and handed off to newcomers, so he&#39;s sought us out for a device that can evenly secure septagonal objects. He promises not to shed scales on the carpets, and he&#39;s brought his family-recipe lasagna as a first-impression offering.<br>He apologizes for the scorch marks on the hallway tiling, by the way. The transmat beams can be a little... overenthusiastic, on occasion.<br><br>(Hey, since hazeleyeddemon doesn&#39;t know what a Yergi is either, maybe we can make a game out of this!

I do lurk around on an RPF bandfic website sometimes, not because I like the band (I&#39;m not a fan), but because the Mary Sue problem is so rampant that it makes me laugh. <br><br>Right now I&#39;m on a crime noir kick, but I have more than a few fandoms. Animorphs, Artemis Fowl, Warehouse 13, Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys, Lorien Legacies... and a lot more. <br><br>I&#39;ve never done something like this before, so you&#39;ll have to excuse my newbie-ness.

Just a tip: make an effort not to post too many threads as possible. The front page of the Board only allows a limited number of 25 threads. If you have a badfic to report and there is a badfic thread already available, please post the link to the fic in reply to the thread. If you have more questions, please refer to the links to our FAQs on the top of this page. Another option is to ask the Boarders in this very thread.<br><br>Enjoy the PPC!<br><br>~Autumn</p>

            <p>The Board used to have every post in a single thread available to view and select when I clicked on any individual post in that thread, which made it easy for me to follow multiple paths at once, and proved incredibly useful when I was catching up with the RPs a while back and when I needed to look through threads from a few years ago for information.<br><br>Now when I click on a thread, the only posts that appear are the ones immediately following the post I clicked on, with no other paths visible at all. I can&#39;t even click on the earlier posts in the path I&#39;d been reading without going back to the front page and selecting them from there.<br><br>While this isn&#39;t so much of a problem when I&#39;m looking at a thread that&#39;s currently on the front page, if I&#39;m looking through a past thread from an unknown number of pages ago, it makes it impossible for me to trace back to the initial post, which is the only one that still lets layout behave as it originally did.<br><br>On the technical side, my computer runs on Windows Vista, and I look at the Board from Firefox and occasionally Google Chrome. It&#39;s been happening on both browsers. Not sure how much that will help, though, because I&#39;ve also seen this issue when I checked the Board from two entirely different computers. Maybe I accidentally disabled something, or our Board is being used as a test for some new code. Nobody else has mentioned this issue, though, which is making me think that it might only be a problem that I&#39;m experiencing.</p>

            <p>Er, sorry, channelling Clippy...<br><br>Anyhow. The usual reason for that is that when you loaded the Board, it didn&#39;t load up the style sheet which tells it how to do... all those things. Why not? Because... reasons.<br><br>I honestly don&#39;t know. The CSS is stored on my webs.com domain, so it may be a problem over there, but I seem to recall it happening back when it was on, uh, dropbox or something, too. I&#39;ve never been able to detect any pattern to it. Ultimately, my guess is that the slow loading is the cause, rather than an effect - it loads slowly, so it never bothers to load the CSS. Why it&#39;s loading slowly? Eh... return to top of paragraph.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Hey, someone mentioned the light grey! What do you think of it? I was trying to put in something that would break up the Great White Page without changing the aesthetic too much - how&#39;d it work?</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t seem to load anything there, not your Webplex, not their main site.

            <p>The collapsing threads thing was YourWebApps coming up with a brilliant idea, and implementing it across the board.

            <p>According to the <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Vortex">TARDIS data core</a>, the energy within the Time Vortex is summed up in E=mc<sup>3,</sup> which suggests that there&#39;s a great deal of energy in there or something (don&#39;t look at me I&#39;m not a physicist).<br><br>If that armoursuit can survive ten minutes of exposure to a great deal of energy that also doesn&#39;t follow the laws of normal space-time, then I guess you could use it?</p>

            <p>...or studying to be one, at any rate. I think I can explain the modified Einstein equation thing going on here...<br><br>What we mean by E=mc<sup>2</sup> is simply: &quot;the faster you go, the heavier you get&quot;. It&#39;s the main reason why we can&#39;t go faster than light: when reaching speeds near c, it takes an exponentially greater amount of force to simply <i>accelerate</i> your mass.<br><br>Remember: F=ma, and a=F/m. <br><br>As velocity--&gt; c, m--&gt; ∞, and so a--&gt; 0m/s<sup>2</sup> for a constant force F. <br><br>Science fiction usually gets around this by either having a ship jump into hyperspace (Star Wars), create a pocket distortion that bends space-time around it (Star Trek), or decrease the ship&#39;s mass itself and therefore push the light-speed asymptote back (Mass Effect). It also conveniently eliminates the time dilation effect that is predicted by Einstein&#39;s special relativity (aka: the faster you move, the slower time passes by for <i>you</i>). To an outside observer, a ship at FTL velocities looks like this:<br><br><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sgfq-FGDr7k/UkhIqHuTpaI/AAAAAAAAZ_k/sozCBk6Rfmo/s1600/3116175811_1_9_vAKm7dku.gif" alt="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sgfq-FGDr7k/UkhIqHuTpaI/AAAAAAAAZ_k/sozCBk6Rfmo/s1600/3116175811_1_9_vAKm7dku.gif"><br>Notice the correct use of the Doppler effect: everything behind the ship is red-shifted and everything in front of it is blue-shifted.<br><br><br>...but that&#39;s enough about FTL, let&#39;s talk Time Vortex.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m going to be completely honest and say that I have no idea what E=mc<sup>3</sup> will do the the light-speed-limit. It may very well be that it will dramatically affect the speed of light by increasing the slope of the original E-over-mc<sup>2</sup> curve. What will this do? Well, c has been redefined and suddenly everything has more potential energy. I have no idea how this will affect classical mechanics, let alone quantum theory. I think we can all agree on that it is a Very Bad Thing to be caught up in...<br><br><br><br>Upon reading the entire article on the Vortex, one thing that I found to be very clever is the fact that it takes less energy to go to the future than to travel to the past. Why?<br><br>It&#39;s because you&#39;re riding on entropy&#39;s coattails.<br><br><br>Anyhoo, thanks for the answer! I&#39;ll do some extra research on this...</p>

            <p>Would anyone like to kill the fic that adds in something called Sylvari, apparently from a continuum called Guild Wars, forces Treebeard out of character, has a Sue <br>called Ceres who is speshul, in-jokes that make no sense, etc. And this is from the first two chapters. It&#39;s called Wild Growth and it&#39;s on the Pit. <br></p>

            <p>And specific, for that matter.

            <p>I should have guessed that the suevasion would head into Rise of the Guardians. I mean, Jack Frost is freaking adorable and there&#39;s chosen ones, a variety of powers, and it&#39;s a fandom small enough that suethors probably count on having some attention...<br><br>But the <i>tense shifts</i> in this thing... And the fact that the sue is the &quot;daughter of Mother nature&quot; are quite annoying.</p>
