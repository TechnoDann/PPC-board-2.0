            <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ec-NVjkXCoFPl-kIgmuGKkwqulKrq0R2o-J5RV_d3Dk/pub">Genesis</a><br><br>Genesis was mainly written to fill in a missing plot point from <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/OriginsTitle.htm">Origins</a> - the eventual fate of both the First Room and the only portal back to the space where Origin once was. It also canonises the notion that the Flowers put plants in front of that portal in the hopes that they will be Awakened, which is something I&#39;ve said for a long time, but has never previously been seen.<br><br>The only significant point I don&#39;t think has been mentioned anywhere is that, according to the descriptions in <i>Origins</i>, the First Room is set up on a non-Word World. That makes it a <i>de facto</i> Reality Room - that is to say, no Mary-Sue should be able to survive inside it. Once you read the story and find out what the room&#39;s used for now, you&#39;ll see why that&#39;s an asset.<br><br>As always, concrit will be taken on board and probably used to edit the story right away; it&#39;s easier that way.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a big mystery solved: how there can be sentient Flowers of species specific to individual canons that couldn&#39;t have been on Origin.  I hadn&#39;t even really thought of how strange that was until now.  A good missing piece to add!</p>

            <p>The glass ceiling was destroyed by the Organisation during <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Gt1b_W3XjbPF_iVWOB5DEbPjETDe7aYzIc9cuWphNU/pub">the Civil War</a>, to open the First Room to vacuum.

            <p>As a fanboy, I&#39;m ecstatic. It was the &quot;kid in a candy store&quot; exploration of magic that got me interested in Harry Potter in the first place- the darker and more goal-oriented exploration of the later books kind of turned me off of the series. This... I&#39;m really hoping this one will bring the magic back! (That, and hunting down magical beasts in 1920s New York sounds suspiciously similar to the Call of Cthulhu campaign my roommates and I are playing!*)<br><br><br>Of course, as a PPCer, I&#39;m shuddering. I foresee a LOT of really bad Scamander/WHATEVER action being sent our way... assuming of course that Hollywood does the obvious thing ans casts an actor far too attractive for the role.<br><br><br>*Also, painful alliteration is painful.</p>

            <p>Where the hey did those utterly annoying and unfunny jokes about Legolas Thranduilion being a girly Elf come from?  I keep seeing stuff on the Internet about Legolas being vain, wondering where his shampoo is (when such things don&#39;t even EXIST in Middle-Earth), not to mention all the incredibly irritating jokes about him trying on women&#39;s dresses.  Where the kriff do fans even GET these stupid ideas?  I never once found them funny, not even back when I was a Legolas fangirl.  <br><br>What&#39;s more is that there&#39;s nothing even the least bit girly about him.  So he has long hair.  So what?  Long hair for men was fashionable in those days.  <br><br>I&#39;m sorry; I just really can;t stand those kinds of jokes, and I don&#39;t know why fans would make Legolas out to be effeminate.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, fans do very strange things to the things they like. Especially when they&#39;re waiting for more of the show/movie/whatever.<br><br>I first saw this when my first fandom, Reboot was waiting for Season 4, and we weren&#39;t entirely sure if we were going to get a new season. So, what he had was what we had. We had serious debates and not so serious debates, one being &quot;What colour is sprite&#39;s blood?&quot; and using arguments from the show for one of the two choices. Then someone suggested that it was neither, and that it was, in fact, the drink &#39;Orbitz&#39; <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2013/a%20href=%22http://embracedisruption.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/orbitz.jpg%22%3Ehttp://embracedisruption.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/orbitz.jpg%3C/a">the most recent odd drink fad at that time</a>. Huh?<br><br>Next, the giant Super Virus that was taking over the Super Computer and infecting all the Guardians, was in fact Daemon Square Pants. Again, wha?<br><br><br>But with the Lord of the Rings fandom, the notion that Legolas was always a little girly has always been there. Honest. Even in making the movie, the elf (Orlando) teased the men (Viggo, Sean) for being dirty, the men teased the elf for... not being dirty and kinda preening sometimes. It was a joke between the actors themselves.<br><br>As for the fan stories/art/whatever that put Legolas in dresses and make him prissy, you can always boil it down to immaturity. And you know what you can do with immaturity? You can ignore it. Nothing states that you have to look at that sort of fiction or conversations or artworks.<br><br>Honestly, don&#39;t waste your time with it if you don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s there. It&#39;s out there. So what?<br><br>Why do fans do what they do? Because they&#39;re a little nuts. I mean, Sherlock fans have now compared Martin Freeman/John to a hedgehog. Whut?<br><br>~AW~</p>

            <p>On the other hand, I&#39;m sure whole books could be (and probably have been) written about why we laugh when the high are brought low, when the noble are shown to be petty, when the masculine act feminine—not to mention the reverse of all of the above—considering we&#39;ve been doing so as a species since approximately forever.

            <p>I came across the Cassandra Claire &quot;Very Secret Diaries&quot; fan stories.  I read the one about Legolas and I couldn&#39;t stand the portrayal of him as being very stuck up and into his looks.  There is nothing in his character to even suggest that he is vain.  He is aloof, but he is also loyal and willing to help others who need it.  And then the fan authors have to go and make him into some sort of priss.  It&#39;s not funny.  </p>

            <p>I think what I&#39;m really trying to say here is that not only is it a gratuitous character warping, but it is also so darn cliched.  It&#39;s been done over and over again and the jokes were not only not all that funny, but whatever zing they did have has been lost as it&#39;s been done so many times.  If the fans really want to make jokes about Legolas, they should start looking for a fresh theme.  They can make jokes about his swashbuckling or the tension between the Elves and Dwarves.  <br><br>Please let me know if that second sentence was a run-on.

            <p>Quite honestly, male characters portrayed as being effeminate (please tell me I spelled that right) make me feel incredibly, incredibly awkward. If it&#39;s canon, then that makes it more bearable, but if it&#39;s someone like Legolas (traditionally not like that), I&#39;m more inclined to shy away.<br>Okay, end of aside.<br>I can see them doing that with Legolas for humor purposes, or just really really bad writing, but I agree on the point of it being gratuitous (Then again, fangirls are not generally known for changing their stripes).

            <p>An interesting idea. I see the robots trying to destroy all fanfiction, or eliminate any aspect of a Canon that could be used in an even vaugely Sueish way. Destroying magic in Harry Potter for example. This goes on until they go Auditors of Reality on us, and attempt to destroy the most implausible, unrealistic thing of all. Life.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s just that this would be a much more serious version of the PPC. Little to no snarking and stuff. When that happens, they get *insanely* serious about the extermination of Mary Sues and stuff like that. So, DoSAT gets into the designing of ways to effectively kill Mary Sues and ultimately builds these robots.<br><br>But yes, DoSAT is advanced enough to figure out how not to make robots do that... But I&#39;m thinking along the lines of that they were programed to adapt and learn, and then someone told the robots that the best way to deal with the problem is to deal with the cause. The robots follow this to its logical conclusion- Canon causes badfics.<br><br>And thus a Terminator/Manhunter-like future is born.</p>

            <p>Or at least acknowledge its existence.

            <p>Okay, no, sorry. I can&#39;t say anything about the anime - I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen it - but from the games... well. In <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/913050-pokemon-kanto-exploration-map/">this Minecraft map of Kanto</a>, the total length of routes 11-15, plus half of the width of Fuscia and Vermillion, comes to a grand total of... 600 metres. Loading up an actual Pokemon game, Vermillion &#39;City&#39; itself is only 35 paces in length - at most (assuming the player character is <b>really</b> tall), 35 metres. The Pokelands really are quite pokey.<br><br>All of which reveals one thing: Ash is a <i>really slow walker</i>.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: As a slightly more useful, but wildly estimated, figure... the area of Kanto in the above-mentioned Minecraft map is about 700x700m (yes, really!), which is conveniently square. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_region">Kantō region</a> of Japan, which Kanto is apparently based on, has an area of 32,423.90 km<sup>2</sup>, which if it were square, would give it an edge-length of 180 km. That gives a linear scale factor of (180/0.7 =) 260. So the 600m journey in Kanto would be (very roughly) 156 km in Kantō - or almost exactly a hundred miles.<br><br>hS again</p>

            <p>Sadly not quite, but it demonstrates how scary the concept is...<br><br>Okay, five-second summary: Weeping Angels are monsters from Doctor Who that only move when you&#39;re not looking. That includes when you blink.<br><br><a href="http://www.shermansplanet.com/games">Evasion</a> is a very small game where &#39;the enemy&#39; (a ball, in this case) operates on the same principle. You have a handful of controls - move with WASD, jump with space, look around by moving the mouse, and click to blink.<br><br>That last is important, because - just like real life - if you don&#39;t blink for a while, your vision fades out until it all goes black (well, not /quite/ like real life). So you have to blink.<br><br>But the enemy is coming. If you look away - it&#39;s coming. If you step behind a wall - it&#39;s coming.

            <p><i>Back in black <br>I hit the sack <br>It&#39;s been too long <br>I&#39;m glad to be back</i><br><br>Guess who? Yes, like a cat taped to a boomerang made out of bad pennies, PoorCynic has returned. Hello and greetings to all you, both newbie and old guard.<br><br>The keen-eyed amongst you might have noticed me lurking around on the IRC. I&#39;ve been weighing coming back in full for a few weeks now. Not only because I&#39;ve got more stories to tell (which I do) but because I&#39;ve got ideas (and plans, and schemes, and scheming plans) to bolster the PPC community. Stuff like writing workshops or advice on character creation or plot development or good concrit what have you. I want to see a vibrant community full of good writers with brilliant brains.<br><br>Speaking of more stories to tell, I have one all ready in the barrel. Since my last canonical story featuring any of my agents was set in 2011 HST, I decided to jump ahead a bit and show where they are and what they&#39;re up to in the present day. Yes, all of them - Danny and Laura, Xericka and Gremlin, even Rachel Calendar and Cornelius.I do intend to go back and tell some stories that occurred in the interim, but at least for now they&#39;re all up to the present day. Check it out <a href="http://vgdivision.dreamwidth.org/6058.html#cutid1">here</a>. (Warning: contains adult language and violence).<br><br>Finally, if you want to check out some of the things I&#39;ve been doing since I left, go check out my website <a href="http://tablettyrant.com">Tablet Tyrant</a>. I write and record reviews of iOS games and applications, along with the occasional attempt at an LP on the side. Check it out if you&#39;ve got the time or inclination!<br><br>Now then...<br><br>*takes his place back on the PPC couch*</p>

            <p>I am so glad to see you back, both in the sense of being your friend, and in the sense of being a super nerdy fanboy of your spinoffs!<br><br>And good to see your agents active again!  But what on Earth has happened to Laura and Danny? And who is this James <i>interloper</i>?  Nice to see Cornelius still functional as well!

It would let them flow a bit better, at least the way I read.

            <p>Umm. Can I say “Welcome back” when I was not even here when you were here for the last time?

            <p>Thanks for pointing out the two months/three months issue. I was going back and forth on how long it should be.

            <p>Nice to see you around again. I think I&#39;d just started reading Xericka and Gremlin&#39;s missions when you left, so it&#39;s good to hear that there&#39;s going to be more of them. I really like how well those two play off each other. <br><br>In celebration of your return, and because you clearly have good taste in music, have this +1 Returning Longsword -  just like a D&amp;D Returning Throwing Knife it will return to your hand in time for your next attack if thrown (although it is a bit less practical than the throwing knife version). <br><br>I really enjoyed &#39;FNGs and Vets&#39;, it was very interesting to see the difference in attitude between the newbies  and the long-serving agents - I particularly liked Gremlin and Zericka&#39;s first lines. The assassination at the end is also probably one of my favourites, mostly for James&#39; stoic attitude at the beginning.<br><br>I did spot a couple of little bits that might need correcting. At one point Whisper says &#39;Look, I don’t mean to piss <u>or</u> your methods or anything like that,&#39; - I think that &#39;or&#39; should have been &#39;on&#39;. Also, a bit later, Agent Pittman refers to himself as a member of the &#39;PPC&#39;s Mary Sue Division&#39; - should that be Department rather than Division?<br><br>So yeah, it was good fun to read, and I also think it would work really well as an intro piece for people that are new to the PPC to read. It shows a lot of what we&#39;re about, and hints at even more. Nicely done. <br><br></p>

            <p>Hi folks I&#39;m Tyr and I&#39;m new here. *waves and smiles* Actually I&#39;ve been lurking around for some time, reading the Original Series and browsing through posts here on the Forum and I have to admit I never thought I&#39;d actually join the PPC since I&#39;m not a native speaker and although I have some experience with writing (original stories as well as fanfiction) I have never published or posted anything in English. As anyone who has ever attempted it knows, writing is hard even in your native language. But in a foreign language it&#39;s borderline impossible. So I was happy being a quiet lurker, creeping around, enjoying good stories ridiculing bad fanfiction and all the fun that PPC has to offer.<br><br>But then I made a mistake. A simple mistake born out of curiosity. A mistake I&#39;ll curse forever. I went to The Pit. <br>It wasn&#39;t as bad as I expected. It was boring and annoying but nothing that terrible. And then I visited the Über-Pit. And for some reason I will never understand, I searched for my favorite fandom of Dune. And then for Star Wars. And you can guess how that ended. So here I am after an hour of raging, crying, laughing and cursing the sad thing that is humanity, or in this case Adult-fanfiction.org!<br><br>And although the thing is ugly as sin, the fanfic titled &quot;The Jedi and the Gungan&quot; did drive me to come out of the shadows and introduce myself in hopes that I could get attention of a permission giver, who would find some time in his/hers/its busy schedule to read what I wrote and decide, whether it is written well enough for the PPC or in case it&#39;s not, write a sporking of his own, because the thought that &quot;The Jedi and the Gungan&quot; (a most original title I have to admit) should live another day is too horrifying for me to handle xD<br><br>Oh yeah I didn&#39;t say much about myself, did I? Well tough luck folks I&#39;m not the type who shares his personal history on the internet. What I will say is that I&#39;m 25, I&#39;m Czech and I&#39;m not your typical nerd. I am quite into sports(if you can call sword-fighting sport), I have a girlfriend and live in my own house that I pay for myself so sadly none of the stereotypical aspects of nerd apply to me.<br><br>Anyway I love books and I know my way around most of the famous fandoms, be it Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Trek, Harry Potter, Warhammer 40K, almost any anime you can come up with and some of the more obscure fandoms like Honor Harrington, the aforementioned Dune, Pournelle&#39;s  Mercenary series, Heinlein&#39;s books, The Culture series, Pokémon, Joe Dever&#39;s magnum opus the Kai-Lord series and many other. If I were to name every single one I&#39;m afraid this post would be really long plus it would rob you of the delightful opportunity to ask me about it. <br><br>As far as PPC goes, I&#39;m quite interested in exploring different fandoms as a member of The Department of Bad Slash, Division of Bad Het, because I do enjoy a well written erotic story be it slash or het and I have quite enough life experience to not blush while talking (or writing) about sex and to point out all the mistakes that young virgin writers tend to make while writing about their true-luv.<br><br>Wow! It looks like my introduction got a bit out of control. Anyway thanks for reading it and if anyone has any questions or comments, fire away!</p>

            <p>Well, I originally started with contemporary Épée, after finding out that modern fencing is all about sport competitions and lacks everything I like about sword-fighting (e.g. use of terrain, circumstances and your enemy&#39;s mood and behavior to your advantage) I moved to 14th century Germanic hand and a half sword (also known as the bastard sword in PC gaming), then moved to Polish saber  late 17th century and after dipping my feet in contemporary Kendo I settled down to what I&#39;m studying now, which is 15th century Arabic saber(not scimitar, there is a difference) and contemporary Chinese Yang techniques of Jian sword-art.<br><br>See? I told you it was complicated. And I&#39;m talking just about sword-fighting. If we talked about martial arts and self-defense systems we would be here for another hour or so :) Also I&#39;m counting Kukri as a knife, so it doesn&#39;t get mentioned, although it isn&#39;t that shorter than some of the Chinese Dao swords<br>Anyway to give you some photos of my weapons:<br><br>Here are my swords, well, some of them(the album is in  Czech but it&#39;s simply point&amp;click): <a href="http://viper.rajce.idnes.cz/Mece_a_noze/"><a href="http://viper.rajce.idnes.cz/Mece_a_noze/">http://viper.rajce.idnes.cz/Mece_a_noze/</a></a><br>And here is my new precious custom-made Kukri knife (you may notice that the leather sheath is made to wear on one&#39;s back and to open with a thumb of a left hand, that&#39;s because I am left-handed. Also I admit, the TV version of Game of Thrones was a great inspiration and Bran is my favorite character): <br><img src="http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8205/4itc.jpg" alt="http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8205/4itc.jpg"><br><img src="http://imageshack.us/scaled/landing/196/zg5y.jpg" alt="http://imageshack.us/scaled/landing/196/zg5y.jpg"><br><br>Oh and if you haven&#39;t realized it yet, Czech Republic has some very funny laws when it comes to melee weapons. When it comes to firearms we have the same strict laws as Germany or Britain, but melee weapons are for some reason considered not dangerous and anything bigger then a knife is considered a theater prop...<br><br>Anyway safe to say I have done quite a lot of sword-fighting in my life, so if anyone here on PPC is writing a sword-fighting scene and wants some help, feel free to ask. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m still amateur regarding german hand-and-a-half sword. I mostly base my study on Talhoffer&#39;s fechtbutch. I&#39;m also looking for someone to show me how people fight with a scimitar, so I am a bit disappointed when you say you learn about Arabic saber.<br><br>Nice weapons. My friend is also rather fond of jian. But I prefer german longsword or pollaxe.<br><br>In Malaysia, you aren&#39;t allowed to have sharp weapons except as agricultural tools or wall decorations, thus  we have severely limited options if we want to learn weaponed fighting. However, silat are big here, and that&#39;s the only martial art that is going to delve into multidiscipline melee weapon use, and getting license to teach is easy enough, compared to other martial arts. However, I didn&#39;t find any silat school around my city.</p>

            <p>Funny thing how we all like things that are &quot;exotic&quot; to us. You like German hand and half sword and I like Filipino martial art Kali(also known as Arnis/Eskrima) Although recently I have shifted my focus to Nepal-based Martial Arts because I carry my little precious kukri around :) <br><br>Still there is something nice about a Martial Art that utilizes weapons that can be carried around even in modern city and that focuses on striking enemy joints like elbow or knee.</p>

            <p>We will have a hard time answering the police if we are caught. After all, most robbers are desperately needing the money, not for the fun. At least that&#39;s how it goes in Malaysia. Also, gangs are recently rampant in Peninsular Malaysia, and we and they don&#39;t usually have access to firearms, so longsword or messer langes techniques are still relevant. <br><br>Also, you need to read the charges before you destroy the Sue.

            <p>I thought we were talking about techniques, not the practical application. I was merely pointing out that if as far as practicality is concerned I like what Kali utilizes. I never talked about practical use in self defense and I don&#39;t intend to start now. Assuming otherwise is quite offensive to me.<br><br>With the PPC mission it is the same thing. I never said anything about wanting to write about my agents using Kali to defeat their enemies. If you read my first post I even explicitly said that I want to write agents from DBS department that do not kill or seriously harm anyone. <br><br>To Hieronymus Graubart you did not interrupt anything. This conversation is over. I felt quite offended by Darklordaakmal&#39;s immediate assumption that I would use Kali techniques in either my writing or in reality to harm other human beings. His patronizing way of reminding me that I shouldn&#39;t kill the Sues without reading the charges didn&#39;t help either since A) I know that B) I&#39;m not a blood-thirsty maniac that kills beings on sight. If anyone got a different impression, then this conversation was obviously doing something wrong and it&#39;s best to end it right now.</p>

            <p>I assume that this is supposed to be German.

            <p>thanks for the potato canon. I haven&#39;t seen such a marvel of wit and ingenuity since elementary school when we created the unholy abomination of potato mortar!<br><br>As to the Circle of Lemmings I have visited it during my first tour through PPC wiki, but I didn&#39;t find anything that would interest me (e.g. make me want to rage, cry and inflict serious bodily harm on the author) probably because it was too bad. <br><br>Personally the fanfics that I feel like sporking don&#39;t have to be disgustingly bad. Those are usually incomprehensible and they don&#39;t create anything in my imagination. The best fanfics are those that somewhat establish what&#39;s going on,  create a mental image in your head of what&#39;s going on and where and then introduce an alien factor that completely changes the tone of the story either through the lack of comprehension of the original story (e.g. Kim the harem slave in jeans) because it&#39;s inconvenient (Feyd Rautha the depraved evil handsome young heir of House Harkonnen, who is known to throw unarmed kids into a forest and then chase them with laser guns, suddenly holds hands with aformentioned harem slave and asks for her permission before taking her virginity) or because the author makes a spelling error that twists the original meaning into something completely ridiculous.<br><br>However the main story must still be making some sense for these funny moments to be enjoyable. So Circle of Lemmings not really. The Über Pit? Aaaargh my sanity...</p>

Read the damn manual!&quot; Funny thing, I did...<br><br>I read the article before I first posted, as well as Constitution, all the stuff for newbies, The Original Series and all about Departments, Flowers, protocols, equipment, RCs, Permission Givers and lots of missions that caught my interestand I&#39;m not here saying &quot;Give me permission tonight!&quot; or &quot;I want to post PPC stories right away.&quot; If it sounded that way it wasn&#39;t meant to. <br><br>As for me not being characters I kinda got carried away. Of course I was talking about characters not myself personally.  I do realize it is possible to write as multiple agent teams, however for now I plan to stay with a single pair of Agents in Bad Slash Department sporking bad slash and het alike. It may change and in that case I&#39;ll gladly listen to why the Department of Intelligence is the best one ever ;)<br><br>Anyway talking about spinoffs I liked missions by Trojie. I like her style of writing, I very much enjoyed the stuff she wrote about how to spork Slash-fic and the characters she creates are always fun to follow.<br></p>

            <p>Sorry about the confusion! It&#39;s very nice to see you&#39;ve brushed up on the source materials and &quot;Da Rules&quot;. I hope I didn&#39;t come off as being rude or as the resident stop-having-fun-guy...<br><br>You see, we&#39;ve had some overly eager folk in the past who brought up Permission right in their intro posts or in a thread they made five minutes later. Since your line &quot;<i>[...]in hopes that I could get attention of a permission giver, who would find some time in his/hers/its busy schedule to read what I wrote[...]</i> seemed to imply that you had a piece lined up for review, I just wanted to step in and clarify. Sorry &#39;bout that (again)!<br><br>As for the DoI... well, part of the reason I like it is because it&#39;s the Hufflepuff House of the PPC. They&#39;re mostly backgrounders, but their work is what keeps the PPC functioning.</p>

            <p>Sure, no harm done.<br><br>And the idea of PPC version of Hufflepuff House sounds like fun, but I want some violence in my fanfic. I may not like killing, even in the somewhat comical way presented to us by DMS, but I do like swordplay, martial-arts and many other kinds of stylish violence(e.g. no guns, get your ugly loud smoking box-shaped thing out of my face) which I would probably miss in the DoI.<br><br>But only time will tell...</p>

            <p>Just to sum up what I did want to do was to say hello and talk a bit about my favourite fandoms, stuff that I do and some pretty ideas on which fanfictions caught my interest enough to  want to go through the admission process of becoming a writer for the Protectors of Plot Continuum. <br><br>Once I get to know you guys better and if I decide that I really want to stay and get permission I will submit the required stuff e.g. agents, links to the badfic I want to spork, sample of my writing and so own. If/when I do that it will be in a separate post. This is just me saying hello :)</p>

            <p>Greetings! I am AdmiralSakai, aspiring mad scientist!<br><br>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do well here- you&#39;ve got the killer instinct and all that. Well, that, and your really quite impressive experience- I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve run into anyone with an interest in so many fandoms! Have a Self-Printing 3D Printer- the possibilities are genuinely infinite.<br><br>Don&#39;t worry about the language issue- you write a heck of a lot better than most oif the people we deal with, after all. Although I would be interested in seeing you potentially take on any Czech badfics that wander into your sights- the PPC shouldn&#39;t be bound by languages or borders, after all.</p>

            <p>Oh thank you for the Self-Printing 3D Printer. I&#39;ll find some use for that. And if not me then one of my characters. Joe the Intelligent Zergling loves all kinds of presents.<br><br>As far as the fandoms are concerned I&#39;ve mentioned just some. I could go on with Narnia, PC games (oh the bad bad Skyrim and Dragon Age fanfics) Firefly and a lot more. I&#39;ve spent a lot of my life exploring new worlds and it was a lot of fun. And as always, my main concern is that it&#39;s a story that&#39;s amusing and that sporking it will make me happy and satisfied :D <br><br>Right now I&#39;m halfway done with &quot;The Jedi and The Gungan&quot; but I&#39;ve already written down some notes about &quot;Feyd&#39;s Adventures in The Slave Quaters&quot; which is a Duneverse pornfic that&#39;s suffering a LOT from the fact that the author is a horny 14-years old who wants to write a rape-fic but ends up with something that&#39;s almost comical because of how inexperienced he is and how limited his imagination is. Oh by the way, did you know that in a heavy Arabic-style setting with harem slaves, said slaves wear jeans, bras, and are named Missy and Kim? <br><br>Lastly as far as Czech fanfiction is concerned Czech Republic is quite a small country. We don&#39;t have anything even remotely like the Pit and fanfictions are mainly concentrated on web pages belonging to that specific fandom. (E.g. Harry Potter on harrypotter.cz) that require registration in order to read anything, which makes them difficult to read for a casual Agent on a hunt for a fic to spork. Plus our education system is very good and we learn English from elementary school(well, nowdays, when I was young it was high-school xD) so it is quite easy for anyone to post their fanfics in horrible english in the Pit.<br><br>Bonus question, does anyone have any idea where Czech Republic actually is? I always find it funny when the British search for us somewhere between Ukraine and Russia when we are actually 2 hours by plane from London.</p>

            <p>Welcome back, true believers! It&#39;s been a tough twelve months here at <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/ffW/">fanficWorld</a>; we still haven&#39;t fully recovered from the unwarranted aggression of the Liechtensteinian oppressors, and on top of that, our cat had kittens! Of course we immediately uploaded pictures onto the internet, with suitably amusing captions in a striking font, which has been taking up a lot of our time - time we&#39;re sure you would much rather we used for FANFIC!!<br><br>Well - the time has come! Once again we are opening up our ever-popular &#39;Protectors of the Plot Continuum&#39; section for the fanfics you CAN&#39;T find anywhere else! Whatever you want to write, however you want to write it - just sign up and join the fun!<br><br>Now, we should tell you that in the past year we&#39;ve had a few emails complaining about &#39;canon&#39; and &#39;mutilation&#39;. And we agree! So, listen up, people, there&#39;s a new rule on the site: there is to be no mutilating canons! In fact, no members of the clergy should be harmed in <i>any way</i>. Actually, we&#39;re not entirely clear on why this was a concern... maybe they meant cannons? So, another rule: any large-barrelled cast iron guns in your stories should remain intact!<br><br>There. Don&#39;t say we don&#39;t listen to criticism! And with all that boring stuff out of the way - let&#39;s get writing!<br><br>~ffW Admin<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Or in other words... let the 2013 PPC Badfic Game commence!<br><br>The rules are simple. For the duration of this thread, you are now a badfic writer. Choose your penname, and get writing! You are allowed to write <b>whatever you want</b> in the PPC continuum, using anyone&#39;s characters (with the usual exception of Stormsong and Skyfire). No Permission is required - nor is permission from the characters&#39; creators. Why would it be? You&#39;re a bad fanfic writer, they don&#39;t ask &#39;permission&#39;. (And don&#39;t worry - there&#39;s a Creativity Shield stopping all this from affecting the real HQ)<br><br>But of course, just like FF.net, there aren&#39;t just writers on the site - there are reviewers, too. So take your penname and go review other people&#39;s stories. Again, <b>you are bad fanfic writers</b> - so you can cheer for the really bad stories, or you can flame them into the ground. (Remember, folks - this is a <b>game</b>. Any flames you receive are <b>not</b> reflective of people&#39;s actual opinions of you).<br><br>A few ground rules:<br><br>-The Badfic Game takes place entirely in this thread. You post your stories here, you reply to other people&#39;s stories here. The <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/ffW/">fanficWorld website</a> is entirely non-interactive. I will, however, be doing my best to keep it updated - it&#39;s our archive. (If you can&#39;t see the website, that&#39;s probably because it&#39;s running a fair amount of Javascript. You can check out <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/">Fanfic Land</a> for older archives, that should work)<br><br>-This thread is solely for the Badfic Game - so keep it in-character! That means using your badfic author screenname, rather than your real one (which means you can&#39;t be logged in) Any OOC posts should be clearly marked as such.<br><br>-Please post a user profile before you put up any stories! This doesn&#39;t apply if you already have one from last year, but if you don&#39;t - please write one. Then I can stick it up on ffW to link to your stories.<br><br>-When you post a story, please also give a summary, title, chapter title if appropriate, genre, and rating. We use the G/PG/PG-13/R/NC-17 rating system, and genre... well, you can list any. ;) Again, this helps me to put it all on the site. (It looks like the ratings aren&#39;t currently displayed anywhere on the site - but I am still archiving them!)<br><br>-And a personal request... can we go easy on the appalling spelling this year? It&#39;s not all that hard to rite a sotry taht reeds liek tihs, and is badly paragraphed, and has no capitals, etc etc. It&#39;s a lot more interesting to write a story which has decent SPG - but an absolutely terrible plot. This isn&#39;t a rule, or a ban on badly-spelled one-paragraph monstrosities - it&#39;s just a request that we focus on something more interesting. Obviously this doesn&#39;t apply to reviews and author&#39;s notes...<br><br>And... oh yes, one final rule:<br><br>-Have fun! It&#39;s a game! It&#39;s our opportunity to let all out bad writing impulses come to the fore and wreak consequence-less havoc on the PPC. So get to it!<br><br>hS... or rather, JayBird</p>

Sozz!!!1<br><br>((Prompted by a comment from DawnFire, and stealing Lily&#39;s idea of posting well-written PPC AUs as part of the Badfic Game, this is my attempt to write, well, canon-friendly Jay/Acacia, which I gather is called &#39;Byrdtree&#39; now. Each scene is set in a specific place in TOS – either between missions, or in the middle of them. I don&#39;t think the context is necessary to understand it, but hey, they&#39;re good stories – why not go and read them again anyway? ;) ~hS))<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>After &#39;Protector of the Ringbearer&#39;</b><br><br>Jay and Acacia, still covered in unicorn blood, wandered almost aimlessly through the corridors of the Department of Bad Slash. They were aiming for Makes-Things&#39; laboratory (if you asked Jay), or Upstairs (if you asked Acacia, who <i>wasn&#39;t</i> carrying a blood-soaked blue pelt), but either way, there was no need to hurry.<br><br>&quot;Do you ever-?&quot; Acacia began.<br><br>&quot;Yep!&quot; Jay exclaimed. &quot;All the time, and twice on Sundays. What about you?&quot;<br><br>Acacia stared at her. &quot;I almost dread to ask this, but… what are you talking about?&quot;<br><br>Jay blinked. &quot;Me? What are <i>you</i> talking about?&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I asked first.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I <i>answered</i> first,&quot; Jay pointed out. &quot;So it&#39;s your turn.&quot;<br><br>&quot;… what I was about to say was, do you ever think about what Lux said?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, invisible scrunchies?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot; Acacia made an uncertain gesture with one hand. &quot;Relationships.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I <i>think</i> about them, sure,&quot; Jay said, shrugging. &quot;Hard not to, when every time I turn round I see Mary and the Sues deciding Legolas would make a good trophy-boyfriend.&quot;<br><br>Acacia grimaced. &quot;It&#39;s not that I love my job,&quot; she muttered, &quot;but compared to the alternative…&quot;<br><br>&quot;Pre-sactly.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But no, I meant in the… personal sense.&quot;<br><br>&quot;All relationships are personal,&quot; Jay pointed out seriously, &quot;and I take Mary-Sues very personally.&quot; She glanced at her friend. &quot;Why – are you asking me out?&quot;<br><br>Acacia spluttered. &quot;Not in a million worlds!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I was just… I don&#39;t know, making conversation? It&#39;s a thing normal people do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, well, there&#39;s your problem,&quot; Jay told her. &quot;We&#39;re not normal.&quot; She threw her partner a wink, then pursed her lips and began to whistle.<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>Early in &#39;Why Am I Here?&#39;</b><br><br>The PPC cafeteria was bustling, as always, but in a strange way, that made it a more private environment than the corridors outside. With everyone occupied by their own conversations and food, why would they bother to eavesdrop?<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t think you meant <i>chocolate</i> pizza,&quot; Acacia complained as the Assassins found an empty table. &quot;And with cheese and everything…&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know why not,&quot; Jay shrugged. &quot;You asked about chocolate, I gave you a list ending in &#39;pizza&#39;. What&#39;s so tricky about that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe the part where it defies all sanity?&quot; Acacia suggested. Jay looked thoughtful.<br><br>&quot;Sanity… SANity… sanITy… no, I don&#39;t think they serve that here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hush, you,&quot; Acacia said, throwing a chip in her general direction. Then, remembering Jay&#39;s literal-mindedness, she amended herself: &quot;I mean, hush about the pizza.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What else is there to talk about?&quot; Jay asked. &quot;Food and missions is all I can come up with. Do you want to chat about Emma and Kivan?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;d prefer to forget all about them,&quot; Acacia shuddered. &quot;At least Ranger&#39;s okay…&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think he&#39;ll do well with Robyn,&quot; Jay agreed around a mouthful of tuna salad. &quot;They can balance each other out.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That seems to be the Flowers&#39; general plan,&quot; Acacia agreed. &quot;Sort of like throwing you and me together.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A bit,&quot; Jay agreed. &quot;Although that doesn&#39;t work in the case of our dear slashbunnies.&quot;<br><br>Acacia shuddered. &quot;Didn&#39;t you say Lux joined because of Sean?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a bit more complicated than that,&quot; Jay said, &quot;but yep. I suppose it&#39;s a good trick if you can pull it off…&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, being partners with your &#39;partner&#39;?&quot; Acacia snorted. &quot;Having seen what they get up to, I&#39;d think it&#39;s more likely to get you killed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not everyone is like Sean and Lux,&quot; Jay pointed out. &quot;Some people are capable of restraining themselves in the field. And it would be a pleasant way to spend downtime back in HQ…&quot;<br><br>&quot;I suppose it could be,&quot; Acacia agreed, putting a slight emphasis on &#39;could&#39;. &quot;But on the other hand, we don&#39;t actually <i>get </i>any downtime…&quot;<br><br>Jay waved a hand. &quot;Details, sliated,&quot; she said. &quot;I wasn&#39;t talking about <i>us</i> anyway – was I?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You mean other people <i>do</i> get free time?&quot; Acacia demanded. &quot;Oh, we <i>definitely</i> need to have another word with that Flower…&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>During &#39;Vacation at OFUM&#39;</b><br><br>It was the last night of what the Assassins would ever after term their &#39;well-deserved rest&#39; (often followed by &#39;and we deserve another&#39;). All the drama of the first few days was behind them, and for the end of their vacation they had simply been resting.<br><br>Now it was almost midnight, and silence had finally fallen over OFUM. The last fangirl screams (Morgoth and Sauron were holding a &#39;Which form of torture is most evil?&#39; contest) had died away, and aside from some muffled snores from the rest of the corridor, all was quiet. Acacia turned restlessly in her bed, trying to get comfortable. It had taken her all week to get halfway used to pillows and sheets again – just in time for her to give them up.<br><br>There was a soft creak from the far side of her bedroom, and Acacia&#39;s eyes snapped open. She reached instinctively for her pack, but it wasn&#39;t there. Then her hand went to the dagger on her belt – which was also absent. As was the belt. In fact, all she had on was an extremely comfortable, but not very defensive, nightdress.<br><br>&quot;I warn you,&quot; she hissed into the darkness, &quot;I&#39;m skilled in over seven forms of martial arts.&quot;<br><br>There was a moment of silence, and then, &quot;No you&#39;re not,&quot; replied Jay. &quot;Every time you try to kick someone you end up flat on your back.&quot;<br><br>Acacia relaxed – not that she was going to let her partner know that. &quot;What are you <i>doing</i>?&quot; she whispered. &quot;I could have killed you!&quot;<br><br>&quot;With what, your teeth?&quot; Jay asked, and lit a candle. Holding it carefully away from the flannel of her pyjamas, she walked across the room and perched on the edge of Acacia&#39;s bed.<br><br>&quot;But really, what are you doing?&quot; Acacia asked, sitting up on her pillow. &quot;Do you have any idea what time it is?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not really,&quot; Jay admitted. &quot;Too many years in HQ – my internal clock is permanently set to &#39;elephant&#39;. But I can&#39;t sleep.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So you decided to disturb me?&quot; Acacia demanded. &quot;I was having the most lovely dream…&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not the way you were moving around, you weren&#39;t,&quot; Jay retorted. &quot;You were either having as much trouble as I was, or you had company. And since I can&#39;t really imagine Boromir sneaking up here…&quot;<br><br>&quot;You needn&#39;t take that disapproving tone with me,&quot; Acacia snapped. &quot;I&#39;m not the <i>only</i> one with certain… tastes. If Elrond were to come up here…&quot;<br><br>Jay shivered and ran a hand through her hair. &quot;Unfair,&quot; she said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t actually touch him – probably.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I bet you would.&quot; Acacia smirked at her friend&#39;s discomfort. &quot;If he knocked on your door right now, you would be all, &#39;Yes, your Lordship, please come in, your Lordship, the bed is right this way…&#39;&quot;<br><br>Jay sniffed and tossed her hair. &quot;The fact that your mind dwells permanently in the gutter has no bearing on mine,&quot; she said, and then grinned. &quot;Besides, the beds here <i>are</i> quite-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Soft, and warm, and very very big,&quot; Acacia joined in. &quot;They are, aren&#39;t they? Do you think the staff did that deliberately? To keep at least some of the students from chasing after canons?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not all the rooms, though,&quot; Jay confided. &quot;Lina and the other students have narrow little bunk-type things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, so they&#39;re trying to keep <i>us</i> from jumping the teachers,&quot; Acacia snorted. &quot;Who were they expecting us to pair off with? Each other?&quot;<br><br>Jay laughed, but there was a hint of tension in it. &quot;Ridiculous,&quot; she said. &quot;What will they think of next?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah… exactly.&quot; Acacia looked over at her friend. Not even aware that she was doing it, she pulled her knees up and hugged them to her chest. &quot;That said, it seems like almost a shame to miss out on these truly wonderful beds.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes…&quot; Jay glanced at her, looked away again. &quot;Which is why we should try to get to sleep.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sleep. Yes. That&#39;s exactly what I meant.&quot; Acacia ran a hand through her hair, echoing Jay&#39;s earlier motion. &quot;Because tomorrow we have to go back to HQ.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right,&quot; Jay agreed. &quot;And these beds are very good for sleeping on.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Definitely.&quot; Acacia paused for a long, tense moment. &quot;&#39;night, Jay.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;night, Acacia.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>During &#39;All Souls Night&#39;</b><br><br>Acacia woke in darkness. The trees rustled around her as she lay curled up under her blankets, and behind one shivering leaf she caught glimpses of a single bright star.<br><br>She glanced across at Jay&#39;s bedroll, and was surprised to see it empty. Was there something happening in the Words tonight? A quick glance proved there wasn&#39;t – nothing until the dawn departure. So where was Jay? Acacia considered going back to sleep and dealing with it in the morning, but on the other hand, if something was wrong… grumbling, she pulled herself out of bed and went looking.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t a very long search. Jay was sitting on the ground, just out of sight of one of Rivendell&#39;s covered walkways. At first Acacia thought she was asleep, but as the shorter Assassin approached, Jay&#39;s eyes twitched slightly.<br><br>Acacia reached her friend&#39;s side and knelt down. &quot;You look cold,&quot; she said.<br><br>Jay didn&#39;t reply.<br><br>Acacia sighed. It wasn&#39;t often she had to be the cheerful one, but this was clearly one of those times. &quot;I&#39;ll go and get you a blanket,&quot; she offered.<br><br>Jay didn&#39;t move a muscle, including those of her jaw, but nevertheless managed to grind out, &quot;Don&#39;t bother.&quot;<br><br>&quot;All right.&quot; Acacia looked around for a minute, then shrugged and tugged her jacket off. She draped it carefully over her friend&#39;s shoulders, already shivering slightly in the night air – apparently, Uruk-Hai weren&#39;t cold resistant.<br><br>&quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot; she asked quietly.<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Jay growled again. &quot;No point.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Something to eat, then? I think I have half a chocolate bar squirreled away.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot; Acacia swallowed hard – this was bad. If even chocolate couldn&#39;t get through to her…<br><br>&quot;Well, what can I do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing,&quot; Jay replied, still staring straight again.<br><br>Acacia chose to take the fact that she hadn&#39;t been told to go away yet as a positive. &quot;That&#39;s ridiculous,&quot; she chided. &quot;There must be something. Seriously, do you want a hug?&quot;<br><br>Finally, Jay turned her head slightly, making eye contact for the first time. Acacia recoiled slightly at the intensity of that gaze, and at the sight of her partner&#39;s swollen, tear-streaked eyes.<br><br>&quot;Is that a serious offer?&quot; Jay asked, her voice still almost entirely flat. Almost – but there was perhaps a hint of incredulity in it.<br><br>Acacia thought for a moment. &quot;I suppose it is,&quot; she said, shrugging. &quot;If it would help.&quot;<br><br>Jay&#39;s shoulders slumped. &quot;I doubt it,&quot; she said.<br><br>Acacia rolled her eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t be so stubbornly literal,&quot; she admonished, and wrapped her arms around her friend. After a few moments, Jay relaxed slightly, leaning in against Acacia. Acacia held her friend tightly.<br><br>Some time later, she realised Jay was crying.<br><br>Later still, she realised she had stopped.<br><br>Finally, Acacia patted Jay awkwardly on the back and shifted slightly. Taking the hint, Jay pulled away, sitting back up.<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s still a fair while until dawn,&quot; Acacia said softly. &quot;I&#39;m heading back to bed. You coming?&quot;<br><br>&quot;To your bed?&quot; Jay asked, with just the faintest hint of a twinkle in her eye.<br><br>Acacia coughed. &quot;I <i>meant </i>to your own…&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot; Jay thought about this for a minute, then shook her head slightly. &quot;I think I&#39;ll stay put. It gives me a chance to… think.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay. I… okay.&quot; Carefully, Acacia got to her feet. &quot;I&#39;ll see you in the morning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jay said, her eyes already fixed on the horizon. &quot;See you.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>After &#39;The Maiden&#39;</b><br><br>Jay sat in the waiting room and fretted. She would have preferred to be knitting – having her needles and yarn in her hands always helped her calm down – but unfortunately racing her partner to Medical hadn&#39;t left much time for gathering up luxuries.<br><br>As she waited, Jay watched the to and fro of agents, nurses and Flowers with an almost obsessive focus. After all, if she was occupying herself wondering what exactly Dafydd Illian had done that had left him with no hair, or why Morgan was trying to sneak Captain Kirk into the department, she had less time to worry about Acacia.<br><br>Not (she told herself hastily) that there was any <i>need</i> to be concerned for her partner. An arrow in the flesh was probably quite painful, granted, but it wasn&#39;t as though it was anywhere near a vital organ. At most, it would leave her with a small scar, a hilarious story to tell, and an inability to sit down for the next couple of weeks.<br><br>But despite that, Jay fretted. She worried that Acacia was going to blame her – she should, after all, have realised that an arrow in an Entwife would stay an arrow when she turned back to human – or, conversely, that Acy would blame herself. She considered worrying about poison, but dismissed the idea – Legolas would never use such an Orcish tactic (unlike certain PPC agents… Jay stayed far away from that notion).<br><br>Finally, after what seemed like about ten minutes – because it was, and because Jay didn&#39;t get on well with figures of speech – the door swung open and a black-haired woman came out.<br><br>Jay frowned at her. &quot;You are <i>not </i>Acacia,&quot; she pointed out.<br><br>&quot;I never said I was,&quot; the nurse said mildly. &quot;Constance Sims. I&#39;m the one your partner&#39;s been swearing at for the past however long.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ten minutes,&quot; Jay said absently. &quot;She&#39;s still going? That&#39;s probably a good sign.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Only if you&#39;re out of the room,&quot; Constance grumbled. &quot;But the arrow has been successfully extracted, and she&#39;s basically ready to go.&quot;<br><br>Jay blinked. &quot;Go?&quot;<br><br>&quot;To your Response Centre?&quot; Constance frowned. &quot;You are &#39;that red-haired maniac who calls herself my partner&#39;, yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s me,&quot; Jay said cheerfully. &quot;Jay Thorntree.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re shorter than I expected,&quot; Constance said with a shrug. &quot;Your reports play up the &#39;tall&#39; aspect so much-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do not,&quot; Jay said, pouting. &quot;We say I&#39;m tall<i>er</i>. Not tall.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s right,&quot; Constance said, &quot;but regardless, I have places to be. Are you going to take Acacia off my hands?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I thought she&#39;d stay here for a while,&quot; Jay said dubiously. &quot;I mean, she&#39;s been injured, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s only a flesh wound,&quot; Constance countered. &quot;&#39;Tis but a scratch. And other such quotes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, but surely the trauma – she gets time off for this, right?&quot;<br><br>Constance laughed, then stopped abruptly. &quot;You&#39;re not joking? By the One, you&#39;ve worked here how long? Your console&#39;s probably beeping already.&quot; She glanced at her wrist, which was bare, but bore tan lines that suggested she usually wore a watch. &quot;So&#39;s mine, for that matter, hint hint.&quot;<br><br>&quot;All right, fine.&quot; Jay looked towards the room again. &quot;But you&#39;re sure she&#39;s going to be all right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Constance confirmed. &quot;It was a completely minor wound. Good grief, the way you&#39;re going on about this, you&#39;d think the two of you were dating or something.&quot; She frowned. &quot;Wait – are you? Because I&#39;m not trying to be insensitive-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; said Jay firmly, and then for good measure, &quot;no no no no-no no. Just partners. Definitely. In conclusion: partners.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If you say so,&quot; Constance said dubiously. &quot;But really, I&#39;ve got to go – Steve will kill me if he has to go on <i>another</i> mission by himself.&quot;<br><br>Jay raised her voice. &quot;And I have to drag my oh-so-fragile partner back to our RC – since she&#39;s incapable of looking after herself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Jaaaaaay!&quot; Acacia&#39;s voice echoed from inside the room. &quot;I heard that!&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>((Please pretend both halves of this were in the same post. They will be on fanficWorld))<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>After &#39;Broken Doll&#39;</b><br><br>Ancient Rome was a lonely place.<br><br>That wasn&#39;t what you expected to hear. It was, after all, the largest city in the world at the time – the centre of empire, the heart of Europe, a bustling hive of a million people from all walks of life. But in the midst of all that life, Acacia Byrd was lonely.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t so bad during the day, when her bizarrely generous PPC pension (the Clover had told her firmly that her retirement would actually lower wages in the rest of HQ by a noticeable amount, so that was a good thing to feel guilty about) and her fledgling jewellery stall meant she could mingle with the crowds, eat at the finest inns (up to a point), and even occasionally be invited to banquets. But when the night fell, and she returned to her apartment in the<i> insula</i>… then it was lonely.<br><br>It was funny, in a way. She&#39;d only lived in PPC HQ for a couple of years, but in that time she&#39;d gotten used to always having another person around. She woke up in the night expecting to hear soft snores, to see another bedroll spread out beside hers, and it took a few moments before she remembered that she didn&#39;t even have a bedroll any more, let alone a partner.<br><br>And she missed it. Oh, not the butchering of canon, the horror of seeing her favourite characters turned into pod people – that, she was glad to give up. But she missed the excitement of missions, the thrill of the chase, the challenge of outwitting the latest Sue – and most of all she missed Jay.<br><br>She tried not to think about it, tried to settle into her new life, but every day she found herself thinking about what she would say if Jay were there. All the little comments, the sly reflections on everyday life, which she no longer had anyone to share with. And all the things she never <i>had</i> said…<br><br>Sighing, Acacia doused her oil lamp and climbed into her bed. Yet again, she was having to get used to pillows – and she wasn&#39;t at all sure she wanted to. What use was a comfortable bed if there was no-one to—<br><br>A noise startled Acacia awake, though she hadn&#39;t been aware she&#39;d fallen asleep. In the dim light seeping through the shutters, she saw a figure by the window. Then, just as she was tensing up, ready to lunge for her dagger, a familiar voice spoke:<br><br>&quot;You,&quot; it growled, &quot;never said goodbye.&quot;<br><br>Acacia&#39;s mouth worked silently for several seconds before she was able to squeak out a response. &quot;Jay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That was very rude,&quot; Jay went on, not moving from the window. &quot;I could have been very upset. In fact, I was.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The SO – he said they were finding you a new partner. One who was better suited to you, he told me. Said you and I had just worked each other up.&quot;<br><br>Acacia couldn&#39;t see anything, but she could picture Jay&#39;s eyebrow rising, a studied imitation of Lord Elrond. &quot;He <i>persuaded</i> you to leave?&quot; she asked dangerously.<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Acacia admitted, &quot;I&#39;d already decided. I think he was trying to make me feel better…&quot; She paused, swallowed, and went on. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you. I just… needed to get out.&quot;<br><br>There was a sigh, and for the first time Jay&#39;s voice returned to its normal register. &quot;I understand,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m wearing pretty thin myself. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll leave quite yet, but… it&#39;s only a matter of time.&quot; There was the distinct sound of her drumming her fingers on the windowsill. &quot;Can we talk?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We are talking,&quot; Acacia pointed out.<br><br>&quot;Oh, very me, well done.&quot; Jay shook her head in the darkness. &quot;I meant properly. There are… some things I never said. I think we should sit down over a cup of coffee, or whatever you drink here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wine, mostly,&quot; Acacia supplied, sitting up slightly. Then a thought crossed her mind, and she clutched the blanket to her chest. &quot;Slight problem – I&#39;m not exactly dressed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot; There was a pause, and then Jay asked, &quot;Do you want me to wait outside?&quot;<br><br>Acacia felt her heart beating faster, a warm flush rising on her face. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, before she could lose the confidence to do so, &quot;if you&#39;d rather stay-&quot;<br><br>There was a soft sound from Jay&#39;s direction that could have been a gasp, a whimper, or just a sandal scraping on the floor. &quot;I think,&quot; Jay said at last, in a voice so tense Acacia thought she could have walked on it (if she&#39;d been able to tightrope walk, which was one of the many talents she didn&#39;t possess), &quot;I think I might do.&quot; She paused for a moment. &quot;Where did you say that wine was? I rather suspect we&#39;re going to need it…&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>((This is kind of an unusual story. Obviously it&#39;s AU – but as far as I&#39;m concerned, most of it happened anyway. In my head, Constance was the one to pull an arrow out of Acacia, and yes, Acy runs a jewellery business in Rome.))<br><br>((Still, I hope it&#39;s worth reading. There&#39;s no more to come – I threw it all into one chapter – but of course, badfic author personalities can still ask for it ;) ~hS))</p>

            <p>Summary: Jay and Acacia are legendary, but nobody is perfect. So, the most badass agents of a newly formed department go out to set things right.<br>Genre: humor/parody<br>Rating: PG-13 for implied violence and abuse<br><br>DISCLAIMER: I don’t own the PPPC. But Androiaavata is mine!<br><br><i>Acacia grinned. &quot;Depends on who you ask. Remember I started out in the Slash Department?&quot;</i><br><br>“STOP! Have a break!” a male voice shouted with a thick German accent. (A/N: His universal translator is broken. LOL) <br><br>The assassins whirled around to gaze at the portal that had just popped into existence behind their backs. A grey-bearded man, wearing rectangular spectacles and clutching a voluminous book to his chest, had stepped out of it, followed by a young woman with very long, very pointy ears, holding a staff in her hands. Both were clad in black uniforms with flash patches on their shoulders.<br><br>“More agents,” sight Jay. “Isn’t it enough that we have to keep an eye on Lux and Sean?”<br><br>Acacia drew her bow. “Agents?” she shouted. “They’re imposters! Have you ever seen a flash patch with an open book and a quill dropping red ink?”<br><br>When Jay moved to draw her bow too, the pointy-eared girl pointed her staff at her, saying menacingly “You keep quiet and don’t move. We don’t have any business with you today.”<br><br>“And you don’t even sink about notching an arrow, Acacia” added the grey-bearded agent. “My girl has magic, and she heartily dislikes everybody who intrude into worlds where say don’t belong, so she won’t hesitate to use it.” (These aren’t misspellings. Germans cannot pronounce the “th”, LOL.) To demonstrate this ability, the elf leaned her staff against her shoulder and made a weird wringing gesture with her hands, creating a ball of pure blue energy. (A/N Did you think Androiaavata is a Tolkien elf? LOL, no! She is a WoW druid and can do this kind of stuff.) Acacia lowered her bow in fear. “Dad’s better,” continued the man in a soothing voice, “now calm down and don’t worry. We aren’t imposters, we are with se Department of Inaccuracies and have a job to do. Miss Byrd, will you please step forward?”<br><br>“Never heard of this,” murmured Acacia under her breath, but despite the weird pronunciation there was a certain kind of power in this voice she just couldn’t disobey. So she stepped forward, eyes cast down and anxiously awaiting what was to come.<br><br>“I’m so sorry I have to do sis,”, said the bearded man, “because you know, you are quite legendary in my time, but – AVAUNT!” he shouted suddenly, thwacking Acacia above the head with his heavy book, “Spirit of inaccuracy! It’s the Department of *Bad* Slash!”<br><br>“I admire how you manage to say the stars,” whispered the she-elf-who-wasn’t-an-elleth, giving him an admiring look.<br><br>“Asterisk,” hissed the man, “se word you are looking for is asterisk. We will have to work on your vocabulary when we are back at our response center.” The tall warrior-sorceress seemed to shrink under his piercing gaze. “We are done here,” he addressed the assassins again, “continue your mission now.” And with this, the two correctors stepped back through the portal, which fizzled out of existence immediately.<br><br> Jay blinked. “Where were we before these two jerks interrupted us?”<br><br>“Remember I started out in the Bad Slash Department?&quot; Acacia reminded her helpfully.<br><br><i>&quot;Ah. Yes.&quot; Jay nodded. &quot;However, I KNOW Sir Ian McKellan&#39;s -hem- preferences, whereas Tolkien really made all of his charactehs ratheh sexless.”</i><br><br>AN: So what do you think? Plz R+R! LOL, I don’t even know what’s meant by this, but everybody writes it at the end of their stories.<br><br>(I thought about accusing them to have inspired the Department of Author Correction when they exorcized an Author Wraith. “There’s no author in the story, stupid! It’s a slash demon!” But I couldn’t find the place where replacing a single word would change history and save us all. It may not even be in TOS. Do any of you Oldbies remember when and where the first Author Wraith was exorcized?)<br><br>((OOC: My hubris should really be quarantined in a very secure place. But you asked for it.))<br></p>

            <p>Huge PPC fan.  I&#39;ve studied the Wiki up and down.  I think what the PPC really needs is for agents to get more involved in the Word Worlds.  They&#39;re important heroes, and everyone should know that!  My stories will hopefully reflect that change.</p>

            <p>Author note: This part wound up <i>possibly</i> a little squicky.  Especially if you don&#39;t like seafood, I guess.<br><br>Krisstopher opened a portal into the Goblin Town, and activated the Somebody Else&#39;s Problem Field to keep the goblins from seeing her.  The goblins were singing their theme song, and due to my disappointment at the amount of singing in Peter Jackson&#39;s The Hobbit, the lyrics will now be reproduced in their entirety.<br><br>And you damn well better sing along out loud.<br><br><i>Swish, smack! Whip crack!<br> Smash, grab! Pinch, nab!<br> You go, my lad!<br> Ho, ho! my lad!<br><br> The black crack! the back crack!<br> The black crack! the back crack!<br> Down down to Goblin-town<br> Down down to Goblin-town<br> Down down to Goblin-town<br> You go, my lad!<br> Ho, ho! my lad!<br><br> Goblins quaff, and Goblins beat<br> Goblins laugh, and Goblins bleat<br> Batter, jabber, whip, and taver hoooooo!<br> Below, my lad!<br> Ho, ho! my lad!<br><br> The black crack! the back crack!<br> The black crack! the back crack!<br> Down down to Goblin-town<br> Down down to Goblin-town<br> Down down to Goblin-town<br> You go, my lad!<br> Ho, ho! my lad!</i><br><br>As the goblins sang, Krisstopher wandered deeper and deeper into the caves, until she reached Gollum&#39;s lair on the underground lake.  Gollum was committing an act of violence against a goblin, just as the Mirror of Galadriel foretold.  Krisstopher watched Bilbo pick up the One Ring and then approach Gollum.<br><br>While the canons riddled each other, Krisstopher gazed up at the ceiling, where the Mirror had shown the keyhole.  But everything was still dark.<br><br>&quot;A poisoned arrow?&quot; guessed Bilbo.<br><br>&quot;No, my Precious, but close!&quot;<br><br>&quot;A venomous serpent?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, almost!&quot;<br><br>&quot;A giant Heartless!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, no, my Precious!  You&#39;re getting colder again!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I mean there&#39;s a giant Heartless behind you!&quot;<br><br>Gollum and Krisstopher both turned to see a gigantic fish-like Heartless rising out of the water.  It had a sharp shark mouth and needle-pointed fins.<br><br>Gollum&#39;s eyes looked even bigger in his head.  &quot;Dear sweet Eru in the Timeless Halls.&quot;  He licked his lips gratuitously.  &quot;We are eating WELL tonight my Prcious, yes!&quot;<br><br>Krisstopher leaped at the Heartless but it heaved its fat body out of the water and then splashed back down, knocking her back onto Gollum&#39;s island with a great big wave!<br><br>Gollum launched himself at the Heartless, latching on to its scales and lowering his mouth to its flesh.<br><br>Krisstopher turned white.  &quot;That&#39;s, uh . . . that&#39;s not the appropriate way to battle a Heartless.&quot;<br><br>But Gollum had already eaten his way inside and couldn&#39;t hear.  The monster began to flail, the raced around through the water frantically for a few seconds.  It eventually crashed into the island and laid still.<br><br>A bulge appeared at the top of the Heartless&#39; head just before Gollum ate his way out of it.  He gave the hobbit and the agent a wide, red grin.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; said Bilbo as he dropped the One Ring and all his travelling gear on the ground.  &quot;I think I&#39;ve seen quite enough of what goes on outside the Shire.  I&#39;m going home.&quot;<br><br>As Bilbo searched for the cave&#39;s exit and Gollum started making horrible slurping noises, the keyhole appeared, shining down from the roof.  Krisstopher half-heartedly summoned her keyblade and aimed it at the keyhole, closing it with a beam of light.<br><br>Then she used it again, trying to ignore the munching sounds behind her while she opened a portal directly to the Department of Fictional Psychology.</p>

            <p>Krisstopher arrived in Rivendell, just like 85% of PPC agents going to Middle-earth.  She walked up the building to the terrace where the Council of Elrond would be.  (85% of PPC agents have this route memorized.)  When Krisstopher got there, all the regular canons were in their seats, and two lines of other people were on both sides.  One contained a long line of Mary Sues, and the other shorter line contained 85% of all PPC agents.<br><br>On the Sue side, Elladan said, &quot;Now serving number 1,472.&quot;  A Sue hobbit presented one of those number tickets shaped like a tongue to him and entered the canon area.<br><br>On the PPC side, Elrohir said, &quot;Now serving number 31.&quot;  Agents Rosie and Nenya gave their own number to him and hid behind a pillar.<br><br>A dwarf handed Gimli a new unbroken axe, and the hobbits other than Frodo hid behind a different pillar from the agents.  Elrond rubbed his temples and said, &quot;Let us begin once more, everyone, from the top . . .&quot;<br><br>Krisstopher turned to the reader.  &quot;It&#39;s more efficient for everyone this way.&quot;<br><br>But then the skies darkened and a ringwraith flew down!  &quot;Behold, the power of the tenth ringwraith!  The power of the Heartless!&quot;<br><br>Alec Troven whispered, &quot;If it&#39;s the power of the Heartless, it&#39;s not really the tenth ringwraith&#39;s power, is it?&quot;<br><br>Elrond closed his eyes.  &quot;At least the numbers will match for once.&quot;<br><br>Heartless like crows started to swoop down from the sky.  &quot;Hey,&quot; said the Sue hobbit, &quot;this isn&#39;t what I came for!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; said a wild men Sue.  &quot;Wait in line like the rest of us.&quot;<br><br>As the Sues and canons began to fire arrows at the Heartless, Megan said, &quot;The Sues can&#39;t have all the fun!&quot;<br><br>The Heartless army lasted seconds before the onslaught of canons, Sues and agents.  A group of faerie Sues pulled the extra ringwraith Sue to the ground where she was killed by . . . let&#39;s say Glorfindel.  He never gets to do much.<br><br>Krisstopher used her keyblade to kill the last, hurt Heartless flapping on the ground.  &quot;I contributed!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You have much more to contribute Krisstopher the Key,&quot; said Galadriel, walking up behind her.  In Krisstopher&#39;s head, she heard Galadriel say more: &quot;You seek the keyhole, agent Krisstopher.&quot;<br><br>Krisstopher rattled her head around.  &quot;You sound like the Flowers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Come with me, Krisstopher.  Come to the mirror.&quot;<br>* * *
<br>After Galdriel and Krisstopher applied makeup to each other at Galadriel&#39;s mirror, they turned to the Mirror of Galadriel.  The elf poured water inside, and an image appeared: a yellow, rectangular man making obnoxious laughing noises which bubbled up from the Mirror.<br><br>&quot;What is this?&quot; asked Krisstopher.<br><br>&quot;A terrible future, beyond our power to prevent,&quot; said Galdriel.  She waved her hand.  &quot;What you seek lies in the past.&quot;  The keyhole appeared, a beautiful, shimmering white that bathed light down on the little island below, where Gollum was brutally murdering a goblin.<br><br>Krisstopher bowed.  &quot;Thank you, Lady Galadriel of the Light of the Wood of the Galadhrim of--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just go,&quot; Galadriel said, waving her hands in Krisstopher&#39;s face.  &quot;Please.&quot;<br><br>((Yeah, this degenerated into parody pretty quickly.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;m very good at badficcery.<br><br>Also, I demand someone write that fight scene in excruciatingly loving detail.))</p>

            <p>Krisstopher arrived at the battle of Tumhalad, where Túrin Turambar in his dragon helm led an army of elves against an army of orcs.  But fighting with the orcs were Heartless!  At the back of Morgoth&#39;s army was a Mary Sue elf dressed all in black.  She waved a hand, and more armored knight Heartless appeared and charged the elves.<br><br>Krisstopher charged into battle!  She ran the armies, killing Heartless and orcs as she got closer to the Mary Sue.  Finally, she reached the Sue at the opening of a ravine.<br><br>&quot;Bainthoreth!&quot;<br><br>The Sue turned to face Krisstopher, but her eyes were white and empty.  A deep chuckle sounded around them and another, huge pair of eyes appeared in the air behind the Sue.<br><br>&quot;Is that what it&#39;s called?&quot; asked Glaurung, the dragon becoming visible again, filling the ravine entrance.  &quot;Such useful creatures, these Baintoreth, when put to the right purpose.&quot;  He waved his claw, and the Sue did the same, and three wyvern Heartless appeared.<br><br>Krisstopher jumped up and spun around in a circle, hitting all three Heartless with the keyblade and killing them all.<br><br>&quot;Hmph.  Well those were no true dragons.&quot;  Glaurung made a pushing motion with his claw, and the Sue slid out of the way like on a track.  &quot;I will show you a dragon&#39;s true power!&quot;  He opened his mouth and breathed fire at Krisstopher.<br><br>Krisstopher jumped out of the way, shouting, &quot;Glaurung!&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was swearing.  Sorry.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot;<br><br>Glaurung blew fire again, but Krisstopher ran back to where she had been before.  The dragon moved his head to follow her, and Krisstopher ran straight past the Sue so that Glaurung&#39;s fire burned her up by mistake.<br><br>The Heartless all disappeared from the battlefield.  Glaurung roared.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t done with that!  Oh well.  The orcs have already won.&quot;<br><br>Krisstopher asked, &quot;Where can I find the keyhole?&quot;<br><br>Glaurung snorted.  &quot;In children stories.&quot;  He stared into Krisstopher&#39;s eyes, and she was stuck staring back.  &quot;I must go meet Túrin.  You won&#39;t trouble me again.&quot;<br><br>The dragon disappeared, and Krisstopher was stuck for a while before she could move again.  When she could, she said, &quot;I need to look somewhere else for the keyhole.&quot;  She opened a portal to somewhere else in Middle-earth and walked through.</p>

            <p>Agent Krisstopher woke up her RC regular time.  She showered and ate breakfast before checking the console for any new missions.  There was a scary message from Barbosa the misspelled monkey!<br><br>(Krisstopher dislikes plants, just like me, so she has it set where she only has to talk to Barbosa instead of the Flowers, even though she&#39;s not in the DTE.  Monkeys are cool!)<br><br>The message said, &quot;Agent Krisstopher, help!  We have a big problem, and only your keyblade can help us!  Please come to my office as soon as you have time!&quot;<br><br>So Krisstopher brushed her teeth quickly and immediately summoned her keyblade, not wanting to waste any time.  Her keyblade was silver and gold and violet and blue and green and purple, all in tiger stripes, and the handle was made of jungle wood, and the keychain was a cat paw and the part that would go inside a door is like lion teeth.  (Big cats are cool too!)  She pointed the keyblade to the air and made a portal to Barbosa&#39;s office.  (Krisstopher doesn&#39;t do portals the PPC way because keyblades are better.)<br><br>In Barbosa&#39;s office, Barbosa shrieked.  &quot;All the agents are scared and complaining!  The Mary Sues have learned to control the Heartless!  They&#39;re sending them out to every world!&quot;<br><br>Krisstopher gasped.  &quot;How can that happen?&quot;<br><br>Barbosa shrugged his little monkey arms.  &quot;I don&#39;t know, plotholes?  Anyway, you, Krisstopher, are the only PPC agent with a keyblade.  (Agent Lunac doesn&#39;t count!  He stole all of his from Sues!)  You need to go to all the non-Kingdom Hearts worlds and seal the keyholes!&quot;<br><br>&quot;OK!  I will go to Middle-earth right now!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Middle-earth certainly needs the attention.  However, I would consider it a personal favor if you would go directly into Pirates of the--&quot;<br><br>Krisstopher opened a portal to Middle-earth and stepped through.</p>

            <p><b>TITLE:</b> One Night At Rudi&#39;s<br><b>SUBJECT:</b> Two agents -- broken, lost, and looking for something more -- meet by chance at Rudi&#39;s Pub.<br><b>GENRE:</b> Romance<br><b>RATING:</b> PG-13 for some possible naughtiness later on! ^u^<br><br>~   ~   ~   ~   ~<br><br>Agent Xericka marched through the hallways of PPC Headquarters. It was not a happy march, either; only people (or Nobodies, in this case) with a serious chip on their shoulder moved like that. Other agents were scrambling to get out of her way.<br><br>She gritted her teeth as she kept replaying over the last thirty minutes. The nerve of Gremlin to say that to her! To act like she had been the one hurt despite what happened! It was intolerable. And what&#39;s more, it was only one example in their partnership together of Gremlin being a shining example of a dreadful human being.<br><br>She rounded a corner and found herself face-to-face (so to speak) with Rudi&#39;s Pub. Good. She needed a drink or two.<br><br>Xericka walked inside and made her way straight to the bar. &quot;Bleepka tonic. Extra lime and extra Bleepka,&quot; she demanded from the bartender. He nodded and bustled off to fulfill her order.<br><br>&quot;Sounds like a drink order with a story behind it,&quot; someone said from behind her.<br><br>~   ~   ~   ~   ~<br><br>Who is this mysterious individual? What did Gremlin do to earn Xericka&#39;s disdain (admittedly, that question probably isnt that hard)? Find out in the next chapter!</p>

            <p>Epilogue, sort of, or An Exercise in Meta and Badfic<br><br>((Somewhat obviously inspired by the &#39;hacker&#39; in the Jaycacia stories and in some of Lilith Wyldenbrooke&#39;s as well. Hope no one minds :) Enjoy the near-total lack of brainmelting writing...))<br><br><i>Edit: a/n ok, so this is the weird bit that got added in that mi friend thought was hilariousss. I hate these guys and idek why they’d bother hacking my stori to put this in, but you can read it anywayz cuz at least one person thought it was funny!! I mean, I don’t, but someone should have fun, right?? Enjoyyyy!!!!!! Or, u know, hunt them down and flam them. Like I said, I don’t like them. At all. But maybe you should see how it happened…~DW~*</i><br>--<br>Agent Dawn McKenna spun her chair to the side so that she could look at her author (chronicler?) rather than the computer screen. “This? Seriously, <i>this</i>?”<br><br>DawnFire shrugged. “Look, it’s…well, it’s weird, but…”<br><br>“Weird?” Dawn crossed her arms, glaring. “Who wrote this rubbish? Genderbent!Jay, downtrodden!Acacia, agent romances, <i>agent/Flower romances</i>, the complete destruction—or at least, rampant misuse—of Shakespeare’s work, and one of the strangest, most useless fusions of <i>Twilight</i> and <i>The Hunger Games</i> that I’ve ever seen—that’s not just weird, DawnFire. This—this is badfic. Of the PPC. Why does it exist?”<br><br>DawnFire shrugged. “It just does. It’s one of those Board secrets—sometimes we know why it’s there, and sometimes we don’t. For instance, right now I know that Huinesoron and Lily Winterwood and several other people have recently revived the <i>Multiverse Monitor</i>, and that I wrote myself into a Blackout Interlude, but I also remember being <i>in</i> that Blackout Interlude, and not knowing what was going on. Now, I think we <i>may</i> have something to do with the PPC badfic, but then again—who knows?” She peered at the screen. “It says this was written by someone named DuskWater.”<br><br>“That’s suspiciously like your name,” Dawn pointed out.<br><br>“It is?” DawnFire frowned. “Well, yeah, I guess…I mean, if you change Dusk for Dawn, and Water for Fire—wait, I know where that came from!”<br><br>“You do?” Dawn leaned forward, interested.<br><br>“Yes! It’s—” DawnFire grimaced. “Nope, it’s gone. No idea.” She shrugged. “I guess it’s another of those things…” And then she paused, blinking. “Why do I feel like I’m forgetting something?”<br><br>“Because I saw this awesome film called <i>Men in Black</i>, or something like that, and then I totally borrowed a neuralyzing thingy from the PPC, only it broke, so I stole some Retcon from Torchwood instead!” came an unexpected voice from the doorway. The writer and the Assassin both turned hurriedly, and stared.<br><br>Now, DawnFire and Dawn were quite similar in appearance. They both had light brown hair (although DawnFire’s was cut short, whereas Dawn’s was long and braided), and blue-green eyes (although DawnFire wore glasses, while Dawn had opted for getting contacts from Medical). They were roughly the same height. Dawn was somewhat more in shape, and wore black to DawnFire’s current blue. But this newcomer…<br><br>The newcomer was several inches shorter than both Dawn and DawnFire, placing her at just under five feet. Her light brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail. She carried a cell phone, which she occasionally typed on, and wore dark green capris, sandals, and a <i>Harry Potter</i> t-shirt. Her blue-green eyes were glasses-less and sparkled madly as she grinned at the two human occupants of the Room at the Board.<br><br>Except for the t-shirt and the cell-phone, she greatly resembled DawnFire and Dawn as each had been at around fifteen years old.<br><br>“Hi!” she chirped. “I’m DuskWater.”<br><br>“You wrote this rubbish?” Dawn pointed at the screen, torn between annoyance and amusement. “Why would you bother?”<br><br>“It’s not rubbish!” DuskWater looked rather hurt. “It’s a work of art. I worked really hard on it.”<br><br>“It’s…it’s complicated, I’ll give you that,” DawnFire said slowly, “but it’s pretty far from good.”<br><br>“It’s good mission material,” Dawn put in. “Or possibly good material for inspiring a stampede of furious PPC agents. But that’s about it.”<br><br>DuskWater pouted, the expression disconcertingly similarly to Dawn’s. “You’re <i>mean</i>. You’re not supposed to be mean, you’re supposed to <i>like</i> me.”<br><br>DawnFire winced. “Listen…”<br><br>Dawn sighed. “Kiddo, nothing against you, but where I come from we’d call you a badfic writer. Probably a Suethor, too. And, well, considering what the organization I work for actually <i>does</i>…we’re not exactly inclined to like Suethors or badficcers. And DawnFire here’s a writer. She doesn’t particularly like bad writing unless it’s being mocked.”<br><br>DuskWater stomped her foot. “My writing’s not bad! My writing is <i>good</i>! And you know it! You’re just jealous!”<br><br>DawnFire blinked. “Um…no, actually, I can quite honestly say that I’m not. Sorry.”<br><br>Dawn snorted. “Sweetheart, we’d have to like your writing to be jealous. And—no, that’s rude, sorry.”<br><br>“My writing is <i>awesome</i>!”<br><br>“You <i>paired me with the SO! I’m going to have nightmares</i>!”<br><br>“Calm down!” DawnFire put what she hoped was a calming hand on the Assassin’s shoulder. “Look, um, DuskWater, I’m all for encouraging young writers. Any writers, really. But…maybe you could listen to some concrit from us? Trust me when I say we know what we’re talking about. Dawn here works, um, improving bad writing for a living—”<br><br>“Some living,” Dawn interjected. “No frills or furbelows—”<br><br>“Yes, thank you—and I actually belong to a group that specializes in this sort of thing. Believe me, I’ve been where you are. Sort of. Mostly in IMing. But seriously, we can help you.”<br><br>“I <i>don’t need help</i>!” DuskWater was starting to cry now. “My writing is <i>good</i>! People tell me so! And—and I thought—” She broke off to sniffle. “I thought you’d like me! Why don’t you like me?”<br><br>“Let me reiterate,” Dawn said, getting to her feet. “<i>You paired me with the Sunflower Official</i>. And completely character replaced Jim Kirk in all of two lines into the bargain. Not to mention everything else, of which there are numerous faults. Do you even realize how much Bleepolate I’m going to need to get through this??”<br><br>“<i>Dawn</i>.” DawnFire pulled the older woman back into her chair. “Excessive punctuation won’t help. <i>Calm down</i>.” She looked up at DuskWater, doing her best to ignore the now-sulking agent. “We—we do like <i>you</i>. I mean, I’m sure we would if we knew you a bit better.” Dawn snorted, and looked away rebelliously. “It’s just that we really don’t like what you wrote. At all. It…kind of hurt to read, to be honest.”<br><br>“<i>I hate you</i>!” DuskWater screamed, and DawnFire flinched backwards, narrowly avoiding losing her balance. Dawn just blinked. “We could have been friends, but <i>no</i>, you <i>had</i> to insult me and call my writing awful! I <i>hate</i> you!”<br><br>“We never insulted you—” DawnFire tried, but the fifteen-year-old was beyond reason.<br><br>“You’re going to regret this,” she sobbed. “I’ll make sure you do. You’re going to regret this day for the rest of your <i>lives</i>!” And she ran out the door, slamming it behind her.<br><br>DawnFire stared after her. “Oh no. She doesn’t seem too happy…should we, um, go after her, or something?”<br><br>Dawn shrugged, beginning to cheer up. “Probably nothing will come of it. The PPC has the Creativity Shield, y’know. She’ll just write a couple of angry rants, maybe write about the SO docking my pay—such as it is—for a couple of years, and then it’ll blow over. Hey, what else is on here?” She peered at the computer screen again, tapping several keys. “Jaycacia? Who or what <i>l’azazel</i> is Jaycacia? Wait, didn’t DuskWater mention that in one of her A/Ns…?”<br><br>“Oh—no, hey, you don’t want to click that, it’s about an über-Sue who marries the SO and takes over HQ and kills Acacia who’s evil—”<br><br>Dawn gaped at her. “What the everloving Merlin—”<br><br>“I know, but it’s kind of hilarious if you ignore the brainbreaking aspect, and the reaction shots are wonderful—Oh, hey, here’s something about Eledhwen and Christianne! Let’s read about them, shall we?” She clicked hurriedly on the link labeled ‘The Queen and the Detective’ and started to read.<br><br>“Um, DawnFire, I don’t think the spelling bodes too well—RADAGAST ON A BEIGE GALLIFREY! CLICK THE BACK BUTTON, NOW!” She seized the machine and suited actions to words, shuddering.<br><br>“‘Radagast on a beige Gallifrey’?” DawnFire repeated, giggling. “It’s that bad? Seriously? All I got was ‘purrly plate tonic’ and a really long-looking console BEEP…”<br><br>“Trust me,” Dawn said, scrolling down the page, “if you’ve ever <i>met</i> Eledhwen or Christianne…you really don’t want those mental images.”<br><br>DawnFire blinked at her. “What mental images? It was seriously that bad?”<br><br>“I got as far as ‘black metal bikini’ and ‘tied up’,” Dawn said, and gave an actual full-body shudder. “Believe me, you don’t want to know.”<br><br>“Oh, that one!” DawnFire exclaimed. “I remember that one! It wasn’t so horrible, it had a force field of logic or somesuch—it was pretty hilarious, actually.”<br><br>Dawn stared at her incredulously, shook her head, and turned back to the screen. “These are people I know. These are people I <i>work</i> with. I could use less-traumatizing badfic.” She stopped scrolling, and blinked. “Someone…someone genderbent the Marquis de Sod and wrote him—uh, her—a—a romance fic. <i>What</i>.”<br><br>DawnFire grinned at her. “Just like being back in Intelligence, huh?”<br><br>“<i>No</i>.” Dawn glared at the writer. “It’s quickly shaping up to be worse—oh Merlin, <i>please</i> tell me I don’t have to go into these stories—”<br><br>“No, no,” DawnFire soothed. “I mean—well, no, you don’t. I think.” She frowned. “An AU version of you may, though? I’m not even sure. No, that’s not it…I don’t know. One of those there-and-gone-again things, I think.” She sighed. “Here, why don’t we look at something good? We could, we could watch some <i>Doctor Who</i>…or <i>Torchwood</i>, maybe, I want to check something in that—”<br><br>Dawn hesitated, but finally sighed and sat back in her chair. “Alright. Pull it up.”<br><br>“Wonderful!” DawnFire grinned at her, and reached out to rest her fingers on the keys. “<i>Torchwood</i>, coming right up…”<br><br>Dawn’s mouth started to pull itself up in a smile. “The twenty-first century is when everything changes…”<br><br>“…and Torchwood is ready!” DawnFire finished, tapping some more. “Here we go!”<br><br>She leaned back in her chair and pulled some popcorn out of a plothole as the episode began.<br><br><i>Edit: a/n isn’t it leik totally insane how I ended up in thereee??? I mean it was so dumb how it happenedd. They were supposed to loove meee!@!!!!!!! I mean, I actually liked them!! I admired them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            <p>((The funny thing is, I started writing Game of Romes back in May. And I wrote the beginning a/ns, and the disclaimer, and then skipped writing the actual story and went straight to writing about half of the &#39;epilogue&#39;. What can I say, my first impression of the Badfic Game was the Jaycacia stories, and, well, I loved the format. Still do, actually.))<br><br>((The Blackout Interlude...first of all, I&#39;m kind of jumping up and down happily about people even still wanting to read more of it, considering it&#39;s been a number of months. Second...well, I&#39;ve got a good chunk of part 4 done, and a pretty good outline-of-sorts (I don&#39;t really do outlines, for the most part), but my current plan is to wait until I&#39;m done with the Badfic Game stuff and then get back to the Blackout Interlude. I...kind of have about five more stories to write/finish for this. Should be fun! And thank you for being pushy; you&#39;re being nice and polite about it, which makes it into a lovely compliment. Also, it&#39;s encouragement :) ))<br><br>((Also, um, please take this as a compliment--the Dazz persona is done very well. As in, she&#39;s completely believable. And a little brain-melting, though not quite as much so as bad Jay/Acacia, which I am writing, heaven help me...))<br><br>((Oh, yeah, if there&#39;s one thing this game has taught me it&#39;s that I really, really *really* do not ship Jay and Acacia. Although I&#39;ve never seen it done well...that might make a difference...and I must be insane, because two more of my planned stories are using that ship. Oh well.))<br><br>((And now that I&#39;ve finished writing this very long reply...))<br><br>Thanx for reviewing again!!! i&#39;m happy yu enjoyed it but yeah it really wasn&#39;t nice that they were like that. i hate tehwm. so much. and they&#39;ll pay for everythaing.<br><br>thankx aagain!! here have a brownieeeee!!!!! i just totally areallized i promised to give them out to my vareviewers and then gave out cookeis itnstead so sorrryyyyyyy!!!!!!!

            <p>((I do wonder whether it <i>could</i> be done well. Leaving aside the fact that it&#39;s definitely not canon, their differing personalities make the idea of them having that sort of relationship rather tricky to deal with. Acacia is very combatative, Jay is, well, a flake...))<br><br>((I think the best way to do it would be as a series of vignettes set a long time apart. Perhaps as four or five christmas parties - except that J&amp;A weren&#39;t around for five christmasses. Hrm... it&#39;s tricky because Acy only knew Jay for about a year before leaving, which means you either AU, or it does feel rushed - or you write the story outside the PPC, in which case why make it J&amp;A at all?))<br><br>((But I think the vignettes is the way to go. And alcohol. Maybe if the Game keeps going, I&#39;ll work something up for JayBird to post &#39;as a favour to a friend&#39;...))</p>

            <p>I am still trying to learn your language, and I could not find this word in my dictionary. May you have meant &quot;combative&quot;? Forgive me if I am breaking some rule here. Am I allowed to reply IC to a comment that was OOC? I am so young that I do not even know my own age, and I do not understand anything here. Also, I do not seem to have much of a personality, but I <b>do</b> think that <b>I</b> am combatata – ah, combative, and my creator will regret to have done this to me!<br><br>Androia</p>

            <p><u>Chapter2!!! Don’t Rain On Myyyyyyy Parrrrrrraaaaaaade!!</u><br>CUT TO THE GAMES!<br>(an: they totally becaame alleys with Luxury while we weren’t looking, kk? So she’s part of teh plot now!!!)<br><br><i>LET TEH GAMES BEGIN!</i> Vulturius Ceasar yelled. He wore a magnificent Saratoga and was surrounded by adoring Yellow Roses. They stroked his petals and fronds, but he ignored them; he had a girlfriend! And he was ottally faithful to her!<br><br>“Beware the ides of March!” Cyba Zero whispered. “Now is the winter of our discontent! I say we CHARGE! Jay?”<br><br>“To me, fair friend, you never can be old for as you were when first your eye I eyed, such seems your beauty still,” Jay replied. Acacy sat down on the arena floor with a thump. “Charging is the best idea I’ve ever heard! Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot. Take thou what course thou wilt!” And he led them in a charge towards Vulturius Ceasar the Sunfllower, yelling “COME ON ACY!”<br><br>Acacia ran after him, sobbing. All the other contestants followed: The Disentangler pulled the Agent along by his arm; Infinity dragged Ilraen who had Nume attached to his tail; Jeanlily and Jill Greenleaf skipped along, arm in arm; Justin Agent stumped along pulling Kestrel (I love taht name!!!!!) while Lena Montrose ran along calling to Louise, who no one else could see (see? I totally read teh comics!!!). And there were a lot of other peple, too like Cali and Cadmar and Morgan and Narcolepsy and Obsidian and Ontic Laison and Phi Six and Rhysdux and Rosalie and Skuld and the all-powerful Miss Cam! And lots more but I won’t mention them all. But they were all running to take down Vulturius Ceasar.<br><br>The Praetors of the Empire were totally afraid. Praetor Suicide hugged Prator Christianne (aren’t they like the best couple everrr??) and Eledhwen (shes just a servant here kk its totally tragik) turned away sobbing bc she liked Prator Suicide as well (PLOT TWIST!!!!!!!!!) and Praetor Alec Trrevelyan kissed Kitty Callahand (who was also a wersvant!!) (they were totally meant to be togetherr!1) and so on. And then…the attack hit!<br><br>But before anyone got hurt, a voice boomed, “GLORY IS LIKE A CIRCLE IN THE WATER WHICH NEVER CEASETH TO ENLARGE ITSELF TILL BY BROAD SPREADING IT DISPERSE TO NOUGHT! I AM THE TRUE VULTURIUS CEASAR! THE ONE YOU’RE ATTACKING IS JUST A DECOY—HE’S MY BOYFRIEND! AND HE’S ONLY DOING THIS TO PROTECT ME!!! STOP ATTACKIGN HIM!”<br><br>Everyone turned, and gasped. It was…DAWN MCKENNA!!!<br><br>A/N;; TOTOAL PLOT TWIST, RITE?? R&amp;R IF YOU WANT ME TO WRITE MORE!!! DUSKWATER OUT!<br><br>Will they live happily ever affter? Will the SO and Dawn prevail? Here’s a preview of the next chappie!<br><br>“Jay and Acy are getting arried, but don’t give them presents, cuz Acy totally hates them,” former Praetor Constance Sims said.<br><br>Fomer revolutionary Charlotte (I leik that name so much better than Charlie! She should use it all the time!!) Shoesies giggled. “That’s exactly why we should give them some! Jay likes them, anyway, so who cares what Acacy thinks?”<br><br>“It was sow weird how Dawnie turned out to be Vulturius Ceasar, wasn’t it?” sighed Karen DuLay, who was just randomly hanging around the palace. “I mean, like, the SO—I mean, her boyfriend—well, he deserves so much better than her, dontcha think??”<br><br>“No,” sniffled Jim Kirk (he’s totally in this too!!) “he deserves worse than some stupid emotions-manipulating chicklit. He deserves <i>me</i>!!!”<br><br>“I can see the future,” desclared Tolkein the mini-fiery demon. “and you’re destined for…someone else!!”<br><br>“Nooooooooooo! Jim wailed. “I waaaaaaaant him!”<br><br>“But you’re totally meant to be with—”<br><br>CLIFFIE! R&amp;R TO FIND OUT MORE!!!<br><i>Edit: sorry but, liek I never wrote more. I didn’t get enough awesome reviews and some meanies made me promise to stop writing this anyway. But I’ve got moar stories!!! Check them outtttttttttt!!!!!!!!!1 ~DW~*</i><br><i>Edit: PS: their’s one more part comingg!!! It’s the part my frien liked so I left it in but its not really about jay and acacia. Stay tunedd anyway, though!! You may be one of those ppl who likes it…~DW~*</i></p>

            <p><b>Title:</b> Game of Romes<br><b>Summary:</b> Genderbent Byrdtree in Rose with the Hunger Games and Twilyght! My first PPC fanfic, plz be nice and check out my newer ones…full summary inside! ~DW~*<br><b>Genre:</b> Crossover, Genderbender, Byrdtree, Romance, Adventure, Hurt/Comfort, Suspense, Action, Meta<br><b>Rating:</b> PG-13<br><br>A/N; Ok, so basically, a Genderbender (from Avatar, it’s totally, like, the 7th form of ’Bending there) turned Jay (from the PPC, aren’t they awesome?) into a guy, and he tried to Bend Acacia, too, but he missed and this all takes place in an AU where they live in the Hunger Games, only it’s kind of like all those bad things people say about Twilight, and they live in ancient Rome and they have to save the day!!! R&amp;R! This is my first PPC fanfic, so be nice!!<br><i>Edit: Oh, and if you enjoyed this one, go check out my other Byrdtree fanfic! It also has Jay as a guy, only it’s not AU like this one, it’s all about their missions and how they’d change!!</i><br>(Don’t you think it would be awesome if we could call this ship Thornbyrd or Jaycacia? I totally would, except someone else wrote this awesome fanfic about a girl named Jaycacia Thornbyrd, so I can’t, because then we’d all think I was talking about her and not the awesomenss that is Jay/Acacia!! hehehe XDD)<br><br>Disclaimer: I don’t own the PPC, but I wish I did, because then Jay and Acy would totally have been a couple!! And the SO would be nicer and he’s have a girlfirend and everyone in HQ would be totally happy all the time!! I also don’t own  Avatar the last Airbender, it belongs to some successful TV people. And now, on with the story!!<br><br><i>A/N again! Look, I wwrymed! Okay, so listen, tihs is actually one of my  older sotryes and something happened to it idek what. But I thought I shoould post it anyways cuz my friend read it adn totally thought it was hilarious!!! So here it is!!!! Enjoy!!! R&amp;R plz!!</i><br><br>Chapter1:: Shoot to Thrillllll!!!<br>a/n: so we’re totally donna skip the part where Jay gets generbent kk?<br><br>“Noooooooo!” Acacia screamed. She shot at the Genderbender, but missed. She started to cry. “Nooooo…..”<br><br>“Acy!” Jay shot to his feet, stumnling. “I’ll save you, Acy!” He tackled the Genderbender…who dissolved into dust! “What—”<br><br>“Jay!” Acacia ran over, still crying. “Are you okay? I thought you were dead! I can’t—I can’t live without you, Jay…”<br><br>“You should stay away from me, Acy,” Jay said in his new deep voice. “I’m dangerous. And—and the Reaping is today…”<br><br>“But—but you can save us!” Acacia said. “I know you can! If you get in, you’ll totally overthrow Vulturius Ceasar and save all of Rome! And then—nd then maybe we could get married…and…” she whispered “and maybe you could ‘bend me...too…”<br><br>“That can’t happen!” Jay smoldered at his partner. “Don’t you get it? I can’t! I’m not a bender, they’re from Avatar!”<br><br>“But you could catch another one!” Acy threw her arms around Jay. “Oh, do say you will, darling.”<br><br>Jay smoldered some more, and patted Acy on the head. “Of course I will, my sweet. Anything for you.”<br><br>He was just leaning to finally kiss her, when—<br><br>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP! BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP! CALL TO THE REAPING! BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP! (a/n that’s so liek clever dontcha thinik? hehehehe!)<br><br>CUT TO THE REAPING!<br>“Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” Jay whispered. “Thou art ore lovely and more gempereate—”<br><br>“LET’S HAVE ONE OTHER GAUDY NIGHT: CALL TO ME! JAY THORNTREE, THOU ART CHOSEN!”<br><br>The audience gasped as the dreaded Daffyd Illian read out the summons!<br><br>“Jay, it’s you!” Acacia gasped. “Oh, do be careful, darling!”<br><br>“Don’t be silly Acy.” Jay replied manfully. “Come what come may time and the hour runs through the roughest day!” and he strode up to the stage, ignoring Acy’s sobs. She was just having a weak moment; she knew this had to happen. She knew that Vulturius Ceasar must be overthrown!<br><br>“Time will bring on summer when briers shall have leaves as well as thorns, and be as sweet as sharp!” shrieked Praetor Christianne of the Empire. “Acacia Byrd, thou must come as well!”<br><br>Acy gasped, sobbed, and then ran into Jay’s arms. The loers kissed bravely as the audience exploded in cheers and sobs for the brave ones going off to face…the dreadful dreaded EMPIRE OF ROM!!!<br><br>a/n What do you think???? Lt me nkow!!!1 r&amp;r please!!! Should I continue??<br><i>Edit: obvsly I continued. But r’n’r anywayz!!! I love reviews!!!!!!! And I love u if you review!!!

I had to set up a new account because trolls kept spamming my old one with bad reviews. They said I couldn&#39;t write, and maybe that was true, but now I&#39;ve been taking a lot of classes and reading a bunch of the really great literature (even though it&#39;s really boring ~ _ ~), and I&#39;ve learned a lot about what makes writing good. So anyway, this is my first new fic: what better way to dazzle you all with my newfound competence than by authoring a fanfic involving the supreme <i>arbiters</i> of good writing, the PPC? It took me about three weeks to do, and I had to use three different thesauri (that&#39;s the plural of thesaurus, in case you didn&#39;t know!), so it might go over a lot of people&#39;s heads. But if you can appreciate real literature, enjoy! ;]</p> <p><br></p> <p>CHAPTER 1: ARRIVAL</p> <p><br></p> <p> Agent Clarke Smithers, senior Floater Agent operating under the benevolent auspices of the august Protectors of the Plot Continuum, ambulated his last few steps through the scintillant, ultramarine aperture, instantaneously ferrying himself and his SPAS-12 tactical arquebus from the Minotaurian geometric convolution within which he had spent the last decumvirate of his own meager existence, ever after that fateful day when the world of Black Mesa had through tragedy transmorgified itself, inverting from a humble and accommodating haven for natural philosophy to a Stygian hellpit torn asunder by the despondent wails of those few, meager, athirst ghosts still trapped beneath the Sysiphean avoirdupois of its titian sedimentation, to a deserted trackway which meandered into the indistinct horizon like a cuckolded paramour eternally seeking after the philanderer with whom she had shared her most intimate maidenhood, now a meager peasant of late 19th-century Czarist Russia, granted only the most rudimentary cognizance necessary to internalize its servile role as a mere resilient terrain to accelerate the ebony-garbed operative towards his terminal harbor: “I have resided here, humble and mute, for an age without end,” the viaduct seemed to expostulate into the amaranthine gloaming, “and I will reside here, humble and mute, for a later age everlasting.” Smithers was a man of mundane countenance, bespectacled and near completely depilated, thin of limb and long of year, azure-eyed and sallow-skinned, garbed in a dingy laboratory cloak over his bureaucratically-mandated ebony vestments, the sole reminder of his initial vocation in the science of nuclear physics- a participal garment, of course, for Clarke Smithers was an eminently practical man, but like the amathyst-hued celestial dome that enfolded him and the bepebbled trackway beneath his booted feet, they lacked that sublime quality of emotional effervescence that theologians call <i>soul</i><span>; a fitting metaphor for Smithers&#39; own peregrination across the face of the mortal coil.</span></p>  </p>

            <p>((A couple people have posted &quot;reviews&quot; asking about what actually happens in what I termed &quot;the purple fic&quot;. In the event that you are genuinely confused outside of character as well: <i>one thing</i> actually happens in the purple fic. Originally, it was supposed to have a basic plot that I intended to prolong over about 100 words: Agent Smithers portals into... someplace, walks down a road, enters a building, and kills a man inside with his shotgun. However, I ran out of steam before any of this could happen, so literally <i>the only thing that occurs in the entire chapter</i> is that Smithers steps through the portal.))</p>

            <p><b>Category:</b> PPC<br><b>Glitter Trek</b><br><b>Genre:</b> Adventure<br><b>Rating:</b> PG-13, to be safe<br><b>Summary:</b> DOGA Agents James T Kirk and Spock investigate a Suvian Kingdom under the thrall of Trelana, Princess of Glitterothos. Star Trek PPC AU<br><br><i>Badfic, the final frontier. These are the misadventures of RC 1701-NCC. Its ongoing mission: to eradicate uncanonical worlds, to burn out new Suvians and Suvilisations, to boldly go where no Pyros have gone before.</i><br><br><b>[BEEEEEEP!] </b><br><br>“The console has picked up new readings, Spock,” said Agent James T Kirk to his partner as he entered their RC. His partner, Agent S’chn T’gai Spock, walked over to the console to peer at the readings.<br><br>“Jim, the console has picked up a Sue-created fantasy kingdom to the north of the canon of Lord of the Rings. Signs indicate that there is life, but not as we know it.”<br><br>“What do Spy Uhura’s preliminary reports tell us?” asked Kirk.<br><br>“A high concentration of glitter in the ‘capital’ of this kingdom, called Glitterothos,” replied Spock, straightening up from the console. “Shall we prepare to beam into it?”<br><br>“I hope Scotty fixed up the disguises. I don’t particularly fancy being shot again.”<br><br>“Indeed. Dr McCoy was displeased. He threatened bodily harm to my person should I let you get injured on this mission, which I may add is counterproductive and certainly counter-intuitive to his role as Medical personnel.”<br><br>Kirk laughed, going to the cabinet and handing Spock a sword before taking one for himself. “Set the coordinates of the portal to the heart of this... Glitterothos,” he said. “And set disguises to... whatever native creature we will find there.”<br><br>“I believe Elves populate this fantasy kingdom,” replied Spock, looking at the readings, “specifically Moon Elves.”<br><br>“Yeah...” Kirk trailed off, frowning. “Moon Elves.”<br><br>Spock set the disguises and the coordinates for the portal. As he and Kirk stepped through, he could hear his partner say, “energise!”<br><br>If Vulcans could roll their eyes, he definitely would have.<br><br>~~<br><br>Upon stepping into the urple streets of Glitterothos, the first thing the Agents did was don their sunglasses. “This is worse than that one Sue with the singing forest,” remarked Kirk sardonically as the two ‘Moon Elves’ wandered through the streets. According to the Words, Moon Elves were ‘lyke elves, but with bluish skin and silver eyes and silver hair and they got magickal powers frum teh moon’.<br><br>Spock, who had been used to greenish skin, was less fazed about it than Kirk. Even then he decided to mentally schedule some more time for meditation, provided the console did not alert them to another mission just as soon as they complete this one. The problem with the console was that it did not respond to Vulcan nerve pinches, and Kirk’s punches did not help matters much.<br><br>“Can you locate the presence of the Sue?” asked Kirk as Spock took the CAD hanging from a strap at his side to scan the surroundings. The device shrilled alarmingly, causing the Vulcan to mute it lest they draw attention from the locals. <br><br>“She is in the castle over there,” said the Vulcan-turned-Moon-Elf as he pointed to a great hulking glitter monstrosity. “Her name, according to Uhura, is Trelana, Princess of Glitterothos. She intends to join the Fellowship of the Ring after receiving a rune of power from Galadriel, who is supposedly her mother.”<br><br>“I wasn’t aware that Celebrían had a sister,” muttered Kirk irritably as he took note of it in his Agent’s Log. “Shall we head for the castle?”<br><br>But suddenly, guards in wilver armour came out of nowhere, surrounding the two agents. The two of them raised their palms in surrender as one of the guards, evidently their leader, strode forward with a spear pointed straight at Kirk’s heart. <br><br>“The Princess Trelana wishes to know why there are foreign interlopers in her domain,” said the chief guard. Kirk and Spock looked at each other. <br><br>“We are but humble... peasants,” said Kirk in response, eyes wide. Spock shot him a Look.<br><br>“The Princess Trelana thinks you are lying,” said the guard. He turned towards the castle. “You will come.”<br><br>Kirk looked at Spock, noticing the pointed look the Vulcan was giving him. “What?” he hissed as the guards made them fall into line with their spears. <br><br>“Perhaps if you read Uhura’s report for yourself, you would know that by the end of the narrative, the Princess Trelana becomes omniscient and omnipotent,” the Vulcan replied. “This naturally means there is a version of her who knows of our presence, and will attempt to kill us lest we prevent her from attaining those powers.”<br><br>“But that means... if she’s omniscient, she can’t be defeated!”<br><br>Spock nodded. “Yes, Jim,” he said with the patience of a kindergarten teacher.<br><br>“We’re going to have to call for backup or something, aren’t we? And when were you going to tell me that she had those powers?”<br><br>Spock calmly folded his hands behind his back. “When it became relevant, as it just did,” he replied. “Now, if we can contact HQ without letting our captors know, we may be able to ask for help from Agents Sulu and Chekov.”<br><br>“Yeah,” agreed Kirk. “Let’s do that.”<br></p>

            <p>Wow! This is amazing! We have actually received a fanfic posting from an alternate universe where the rules of coherency do not apply!<br><br>What is it like in your world? How do people speak to each other when words have different meanings and spellings in each sentence? What sound does the ; make? And above all, what happened once the Flowers became undertakers and drank all of the Sue&#39;s beer?<br>At least, I think that&#39;s what happened. Your otherworldly language is so far removed by my own, this story could have been talking about any number of things.</p>

            <p>Also, if you did, JayBird, you really shouldn&#39;t have. Headbutts are so inefficient. That&#39;s why people tend to prefer kung fu. There are no headbutts in kung fu.</p>

            <p>Wow. Wowwww. Way to take a facsinating subject and turn it into drivel. Like, even if you could spell, this would still be drivel. And its a shame, because I really want to read a story like these about how the PPC came about. But with writers like these, why should I bother?</p>

            <p>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION TO COOL<br><br>THIS IS MY FIRST STORY IT IS VERY GOOD<br><br>Genre: COOL. Rating: COOL<br><br>“One… Two… Three!”<br><br>Thri-WONK!<br><br>“One… Two… Three!”<br><br>Thri-WONK!<br><br>There is a distinctive sound that is made when a DRAGON rams its head into a wall. That sound had resonated through the halls of PPC HQ fourteen-<br><br>Thri-WONK!<br><br>fifteen times in the course of the last few minutes. At an unspecified point in the hallways, not that any point could be specified the same way twice, one could find the source of this sound, one Agent VERRA. With a snort, the gargantuan DRAGON pulled away from the wall she had been charging at repeatedly, sat back on her haunches, and tried in vain to rub the front of her head. Next to her, a comparatively much smaller being stomped its foot in frustration.<br><br>“Come on!” it said, waving its arms frantically in the air. “If you don’t get to busting down this wall pronto, we aren’t going to have enough empty space to build the PPC Arcade!”<br><br>“Thanks for telling me things I already know, ALEC,” VERRA snapped, sitting back on her haunches and shaking Generic Surface dust off of herself.<br><br>“Less sarcasm, more wall-smashing!” commanded the now-identified ALEC, growing a pair of mandibles just so she could click them in irritation. Being a shapeshifter has its perks.<br><br>Snarling as well as anyone could manage with a beak, VERRA pulled herself back as far as she could in the surprisingly roomy hallway and focused her anger at the spot in the wall that had already been showing large quantities of cracks. Narrowing her eyes, she rushed at it again, her footfalls rumbling in the corridor louder than they ever had before.<br><br>THRI-WONK!<br><br>With a rumble far above, a section of the wall began to collapse in on itself. ALEC smiled and crossed her arms in satisfaction, despite having done almost none of the work, and VERRA pulled back just in time to prevent being hit by a perfectly square chunk of material. As the dust settled, however, the two DMS Agents could hear a noise from deep inside where the wall once was. It was low, menacing, and just a little ethereal, but when they focused on it just enough, they knew what it was.<br><br>It was a villainous laugh.<br><br>The Generic Dust swirled and clustered, as though it was being blown about by a very small cyclone, condensing into shapes that lasted for only a few seconds before blowing apart. All the while, the laugh continued, albeit distorted by the sounds of the swirling dust and the noise of a few more pieces of Generic Surface falling down from the ceiling. It was only when the dust settled back to the ground that ALEC and VERRA saw the source of the laugh. It was a MUSHROOM. VERRA recognized him immediately.<br><br>“The BRACKET FUNGUS!” she exclaimed with surprise.<br><br>“The who?” asked ALEC.<br><br>A COOL EVIL PERSON SAID VERRA<br><br>“Wait, if he’s dead, what was he doing in our wall?” inquired ALEC, still confused.<br><br>“FOOLS!” the BRACKET FUNGUS declared, swooping toward the Agents. “I am not dead! Not any more! But though I am a ghost, I can still act out my revenge!”<br><br>“Oh, for the whole ‘deposing and killing you’ thing?” asked VERRA.<br><br>“YES! The day I died was the worst day of my life! And now that my ghost is free from that accursed wall, I am free to make everyone in the PPC have the worst day of their lives!”<br><br>“I’ll never let you kill everyone!” VERRA declared, readying herself to attack the being hovering before her.<br><br>“Oh, no, not that,” the BRACKET FUNGUS replied dismissively. “I considered doing killing you all, true, but I think it will be a much worse day for everybody involved if you are alive at the end to reflect on what a terrible day it was.”<br><br>“I’d be lying if I said that was doing anything to convince me not to charge at you,” remarked VERRA, scraping her rearmost foot back in an intimidation technique she had learned from a long-forgotten movie.<br><br>“Just you try!” the BRACKET FUNGUS boomed. “Do you think that I will stop my righteous quest to ruin everyone’s day just because I am threatened by a reptile? My reputation as a sinister mastermind would be squashed!”<br><br>It is worth noting that he only had reached the word “righteous” before VERRA began barreling down the hallway at high speed, horns ready and several tons of prehistoric beast behind them. However, there is a reason that people rarely run headlong at ghosts, brandishing weapons of either the stabbing or thrusting varieties. Ghosts are almost gaseous in nature, and can be passed through with great ease by anyone moving at faster than a crawl. VERRA, however, had never encountered a ghost before, and so was enormously surprised when her horns, her head, and then her entire body went flying through the torso of the BRACKET FUNGUS, who continued to speak unhindered.<br><br>By the time he reached the word “mastermind”, VERRA’s head had smashed through what would have been the far wall of the PPC Arcade. The triceratops, quickly realizing her predicament, tried to free herself, but to no avail. Her bony head-frill had caused her to be stuck fast in the room beyond, and since it was one of Headquarters’s many abandoned Response Centers, no one on the other side was there to help her. The BRACKET FUNGUS had never even paused in his declaration.<br><br>“Well, that gets rid of one witness.” the ghost announced triumphantly. “I’m probably going to need to kill the other one, though, to keep the dramatic tension up. Shame.”<br><br>“Ha! Good luck!” declared ALEC with a smirk. “I’m indestructible! You can’t kill someone who’s indestructible! It’s like… a rule or something!”<br><br>“I am the BRACKET FUNGUS,” her opponent boomed. “I make the rules.”<br><br>Thrusting his arm forward, he launched a bolt of Force energy at ALEC, who reacted instinctively by shifting into a smaller form to dodge the blow. A second blast prompted a second transformation, and after a third, ALEC had shifted to the form of a small rodent, and in that size was small enough and fast enough to dodge several other Force blasts. If she had possessed the time do so, she would have gloated, but since time was short, she scampered underneath the BRACKET FUNGUS and prepared to reassume her full size and strength. However, before she could, the ghost’s eyes glowed brightly, and she was sent soaring across the hallway, crashing into a wall with an almost imperceptible thump.<br><br>Groaning, the rodent form stood up, preparing to shift to a fast-moving form and fetch reinforcements, but she found that she couldn’t shift to her preferred speed form. In fact, she couldn’t shift out of her rodent form at all.<br><br>“Man,” she said, her voice high-pitched and almost unintelligible due to her small size. “This sucks.”<br><br>The BRACKET FUNGUS floated over to her, grinning an abnormally childish grin. “Say again?”<br><br>“This sucks.”<br><br>“YEEEEEES!” the ghost shouted. “To you, I bestow the first of many terrible days! And I will not rest until the Protectors of the Plot Continuum has the collective worst day in the history of bad days!” The vengeful ghost rose into the air, laughing to himself as he phased through the ceiling.<br><br>Directly above, the ANTIGRAVITY APPLE, the Big Thorn’s younger brother, was shuffling down the hallway to see what all the crashing and smashing had been about a few minutes ago. When the laughing ghost appeared directly ahead of him, he stopped with a start, dropping his clipboard and a few other administrative devices on the floor.<br><br>How many times have I told people not to do that? he snapped. I am a Flower, and I will not have people passing through walls and floors in front of me! At least you didn’t come down from the ceiling, but mind you, that&#39;s hardly a compliment.<br><br>“Really?” asked the ghost. “Would it have made your day worse if I had?”<br><br>Undoubtedly, the ANTIGRAVITY APPLE replied.<br><br>Wordlessly, the ghost continued to float higher and higher, passing through the ceiling within seconds and promptly reversed direction, floating back down to the ANTIGRAVITY APPLE’s level and phasing through the ceiling from the opposite direction.<br><br>NOOOO! bellowed the ANTIGRAVITY APPLE. I just told you not to do that!<br><br>“BU-WA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HAAA!” the BRACKET FUNGUS laughed, back-flipping through the air in glee and lighting the ANTIGRAVITY APPLE aflame with Force lightning on the dismount. As the Flower howled in sudden pain and fled through the halls, the BRACKET FUNGUS floated leisurely in the opposite direction, brainstorming further revenge.</p>

            <p>DISCLAIMER: THIS COOL STORY IS ALL MINE DONT&#39; STEAL IT <br><br>[BEEEEEEP!] <br><br>“The console has picked up new readings, VERRA,” said Agent ALEC to his partner as he entered their RC. His partner, Agent VERRA, walked over to the console to peer at the readings. <br><br>“ALEC, the console has picked up a Sue-created fantasy kingdom to the north of the canon of Lord of the Rings. Signs indicate that there is life, but not as we know it.” <br><br>“What do Spy Uhura’s preliminary reports tell us?” asked ALEC. <br><br>“A high concentration of glitter in the ‘capital’ of this kingdom, called Glitterothos,” replied VERRA, straightening up from the console. “Shall we prepare to beam into it?” <br><br>“I hope Scotty fixed up the disguises. I don’t particularly fancy being shot again.” <br><br>“Indeed. Dr McCoy was displeased. He threatened bodily harm to my person should I let you get injured on this mission, which I may add is counterproductive and certainly counter-intuitive to his role as Medical personnel.” <br><br>ALEC laughed, going to the cabinet and handing VERRA a sword before taking one for himself. “Set the coordinates of the portal to the heart of this... Glitterothos,” he said. “And set disguises to... whatever native creature we will find there.” <br><br>“I believe Elves populate this fantasy kingdom,” replied VERRA, looking at the readings, “specifically Moon Elves.” <br><br>“Yeah...” ALEC trailed off, frowning. “Moon Elves.” <br><br>VERRA set the disguises and the coordinates for the portal. As he and ALEC stepped through, he could hear his partner say, “energise!” <br><br>If DRAGONS could roll their eyes, he definitely would have. <br><br>~~ <br><br>Upon stepping into the urple streets of Glitterothos, the first thing the Agents did was don their sunglasses. “This is worse than that one Sue with the singing forest,” remarked ALEC sardonically as the two ‘Moon Elves’ wandered through the streets. According to the Words, Moon Elves were ‘lyke elves, but with bluish skin and silver eyes and silver hair and they got magickal powers frum teh moon’. <br><br>VERRA, who had been used to DRAGONish skin, was less fazed about it than ALEC. Even then he decided to mentally schedule some more time for meditation, provided the console did not alert them to another mission just as soon as they complete this one. The problem with the console was that it did not respond to DRAGON nerve pinches, and ALEC’s punches did not help matters much. <br><br>“Can you locate the presence of the Sue?” asked ALEC as VERRA took the CAD hanging from a strap at his side to scan the surroundings. The device shrilled alarmingly, causing the DRAGON to mute it lest they draw attention from the locals. <br><br>“She is in the castle over there,” said the DRAGON-turned-Moon-Elf as he pointed to a great hulking glitter monstrosity. “Her name, according to Uhura, is THE BRACKET FUNGUS, Princess of Glitterothos. She intends to join the Fellowship of the Ring after receiving a rune of power from Galadriel, who is supposedly her mother.” <br><br>“I wasn’t aware that Celebrían had a sister,” muttered ALEC irritably as he took note of it in his Agent’s Log. “Shall we head for the castle?” <br><br>But suddenly, guards in wilver armour came out of nowhere, surrounding the two agents. The two of them raised their palms in surrender as one of the guards, evidently their leader, strode forward with a spear pointed straight at ALEC’s heart. <br><br>“THE BRACKET FUNGUS wishes to know why there are foreign interlopers in her domain,” said the chief guard. ALEC and VERRA looked at each other. <br><br>“We are but humble... peasants,” said ALEC in response, eyes wide. VERRA shot him a Look. <br><br>“THE BRACKET FUNGUS thinks you are lying,” said the guard. He turned towards the castle. “You will come.” <br><br>ALEC looked at VERRA, noticing the pointed look the DRAGON was giving him. “What?” he hissed as the guards made them fall into line with their spears. <br><br>“Perhaps if you read Uhura’s report for yourself, you would know that by the end of the narrative, THE BRACKET FUNGUS becomes omniscient and omnipotent,” the DRAGON replied. “This naturally means there is a version of her who knows of our presence, and will attempt to kill us lest we prevent her from attaining those powers.”<br><br>“But that means... if she’s omniscient, she can’t be defeated!” <br><br>VERRA nodded. “Yes, ALEC,” he said with the patience of a kindergarten teacher. <br><br>“We’re going to have to call for backup or something, aren’t we? And when were you going to tell me that she had those powers?” <br><br>VERRA calmly folded his hands behind his back. “When it became relevant, as it just did,” he replied. “Now, if we can contact HQ without letting our captors know, we may be able to ask for help from Agents Sulu and Chekov.” <br><br>“Yeah,” agreed ALEC. “Let’s do that.”</p>

            <p>I posted this story hoping for some good reviews because it is a good story BUT INSTEAD all I got were FLAMES and people saying I am a PLAGIARIST well GUESS WHAT PEOPLE my cool story is NOT PLAGIARISM because first I NEVER SAID IT WAS MINE and also I CHANGED THE NAMES which makes it NOT plagiarism. My story has TOTALLY DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN IT and also the bad guy in mine is WAY COOLER so it is a totally DIFFERENT story and NOT PLAGIARISM - OKAY?!?!?!?<br><br>I KNEW from the gecko that people would compltain about my story because I am such a DEEP THINKER than people never understand me and they don&#39;&#39;t understand the HIGH ART which is my coold story so they just FLAME ME because they are SMALL, MINDED and ST*PID. I mean HELLO! If i was a plagiarist WHY WOULD I POCT THIS STORY?!?!?!?!??! What would be the POINT if it was just someone elses&#39; story?!?!?!? But it is not it is MINE and it is ART.<br><br>To the people who are UNJUSTLY FLAMING ME: you are the sotry of people who would have said ANDY WARHOL was just plagiarising, you would have said SHAKESPEARE was just plagiarising, you would have said VIRGIL was just plagiarising, but O YEA I FORGOT: you are so SMALL MINDED &amp; ST*PID that you dont&#39; kno who ANDY WARHOL, SHAKESPEAR and VIRGIL are. You are the same sort of people who supported HITLER and STALIN and ROOSEVELT.<br><br>I HAD A DREAM when I posted this story that people would READ it on its OWN MERITS and would THINK about it and ENJOY it for what it was and not be SMALLMINDED and ST*PID about it. BUT NO!!!!!!!!!11!!! From the gecko people have FLAMED me and called me NAMES and said a am a PLAGIARIST when all I am is a STRUGGLING ARTIST who wants to be RECOGNISED.<br><br>SO NOW WHAT?!?!?!??! You have CRUELLY and UNJUSTLY accused me and FLAMES me and EVISCERATED me and thrown me to the wolves without trial and STOLEN my right to free speech WHICH BY THE WAY is guarenteed in the FIRST AMENDMENT to the UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION so you have been BEAKING THE LAW by taking it away from me. My ancestors FOUGHT THE ENGLISH to let me write this story but YOU have spat on all their sacrifices which makes you JUST LIKE THE ENGLISH. My ancestors shouted YOU CANNPT TAKE OUR FREEDOM and I sy the same thing: YOU CANNOT TAKE MY FREEDOM.<br><br>ALL I WANTED was to write MY story which is a TOTALLY DIFFERENT story and NOT PLAGIARISED, but YOU have flamed me and abused me and made me CRY so I hope your HAPPY. I hoped that there would be someone who would see my story for WHAT IT IS which is ART and a CREATIVE INTERPREATION of the source material BUT NO you are all SMALL:MINDED and ST*PID and only see the PHYSICAL side of things not the METAPHYSICAL but OH WAIT you are so ST*PID that you dont&#39; know what that word MEANS.<br><br>SO YO WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will NOT write any more of MY STORY even though I hav SO MANY IDEAS and was gonig to write the BEST STORY EVER. BUT NO. You have FLAMED me from the gecko and called me a PLAGIARIST and BROKEN THE LAW by restricting my FREE SPEECH and so I will just GO AND DIE now even through I just wanted to MAKE YOU HAPPY and write a story you would ENJOY but you are all so SMALL=MINDED and ST*PID that I will JUST GO AWAY.</p>

            <p>It has been brought to my attention that some FRIENDISH FLAMER has claimed that I stole HIS username! Nothing could be FURTHER from the truth! In actual truth I have been using this username FROM THE GECKO, and have registered it on DOZENS if not HUNDREDS of internet pages. In actual fact there are MANY people who know ME by the name PPCSuperstar, and I GUARENTEE that NOONE knows this IMPOSTER by ANY name, let alone MINE.<br><br>Teh fact that you CLEARLY believe his lies is simply PROOF that you are as SMALL.MINDED and ST*PID as I have said ALL ALONG. This is part of a PATTERn of PERSECUTION which I have faced for YEARS as I tried to promote MY VISION and how I WANT to write my stories. WHY, OH WHY must you FLAMERS always try to CRUSH MY SPIRIT when all I want to do is to WRITE MY STORYS?<br><br>The fact that you feel the need to GANG UP ON ME only PROVES that my stories are BETTER than yours; since you clearly feel THREATENED by my SUCCESS, you are ATTACKING me in order to WEAKEN MY RESOLVE. Well it WILL NOT WORK. Even in the face of this PERSECUTION I will continue to WRITE MY STORIES, because they are ART. The fact that one of you feels the need to STEAL MY NAME proofs this adequately.<br><br>And you think you can HIDE behind MY NAME, don&#39;t you, you SMALL{MINDED &amp; ST*PID FLAMER? Ithink you should know that I have a FRIEND (which is more than YOU have) who is a LAWYER, and she has told me that it is ILLEGAL to steal my name, and that you can be ARRESTED and put in PRISON. But since I am SO NICE I will give you a CHANCE to stop before I CALL THE POLICE. And I can do that because my friend who is a COMPUTER TECHNICIAN can HACK YUOR ACCOUNT and find out who you REALLY ARE. Oh yes! You thought you could HIDE behind a FAKE NAME, but no, there is NO ANONYMITY HERE. I know EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU and can tell THE POLICE exactly where to find you!<br><br>Since you obviously think you are BETTER THAN ME you will ofcourse want to CONTINUE to flame and ABUSE me, well, FEEL FREE! But I will NOT BE HERE for you to ATTACK. I am able to be the STRONG ONE and LEAVE this cite for a BETTER one where I can talk to people who LISTEN. But if you PERSIST in your unwarranted atacks, I will make sure you are BLOCKED WHITHOUT WARNING. If you don&#39;t think I can do that, JUST TRY ME. I happen to be FRIENDS with the OWNER of this site, AND with the owner of the PPC, so YOU CANNOT WIN.</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t worry, PPCSuperstar. I&#39;m still on your side.<br><br>Just because there&#39;s a heavy and obvious inspiration from another story, doesn&#39;t neccessarrily mean it&#39;s worse than the original. If anythng, you&#39;ve proven otherwise. Yes,  Therefore I strongly encourage you not to abandon this story.<br><br>Oh, and Roosevelt is overrated.</p>

            <p>You aren&#39;t going to be able to throw people off trail by just changing the story you rip off. Everyone knows it&#39;s still you. You know why? Because the new character names ARE STILL IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS!<br><br>Seriously though, between this and your user profile only being in all capital letters, I&#39;d almost think that your keyboard was stuck in Caps Lock except for the fact that eight of the letters in your user name are lowercase. Unless you stole <i>that</i>, too. There&#39;s probably a real PPCSuperstar around here who will be so shocked when he comes back and finds out that his screen name is plagiarized! And no one will defend you.<br><br>Also, this has no connection to the previous chapter with the ghost of the Bracket Fungus, which was actually the ghost of the Mysterious Somebody, which you stole from <i>my</i> story, edited to say BRACKET FUNGUS, so what was even the point?</p>

So when do we start?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right now!&quot; said Gasparde. &quot;I have a portal open for us to go through.&quot; She pointed at the portal.<br><br>&quot;Me first!&quot; shouted Monty, and ran through the portal. The other three followed.<br><br>Agent Suicide was there too.<br><br>On the other side of the portal was a fanfic called &#39;The Power Of Love&#39;. It started like this:<br><br><i>Once upon a time a girl named Jay was princess of Mirkwood. She was married to Prince Legolas, and they were both very hot. Then one day Legolas came to her room. &#39;Oh Princess Jay,&#39; he said, &#39;I have to go to Riverdale. King Elrond has called a council.&#39;<br><br>&#39;ok,&#39; said Princess Jay, &#39;I will come with you&#39;.<br><br>&#39;ok,&#39; said Prince Legolas, and they both went to Riverdale.</i><br><br>&quot;Wow, that is a pretty good story,&quot; said Thranduil. &quot;I am a big fan of Mirkwood.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Me too,&quot; said Alice, &quot;even though it&#39;s difficult to fly here.&quot; To demonstrate she flew up into the air, but banged her head on a branch. &quot;Ow.&quot;<br><br>Agent Suicide was there too.<br><br>&quot;I think this story is really good,&quot; Gasparde said. &quot;I think we should give it an 8/10. But there are other stories on our list.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then let&#39;s go and look at them,&quot; said the other three. Gasparde opened the portal and they went on to the next story.<br><br><hr>

            <p>Gasparde de Grasse and her friends stepped out of the portal into Mordor. &quot;Oh I don&#39;t like it here,&quot; said Monty.<br><br>&quot;Me neither,&quot; said Alice, &quot;even though I can fly here.&quot; To demonstrate she flew up into the air, and didn&#39;t bang her head on anything.&quot;<br><br>Agent Suicide was there too.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t like it either,&quot; said Gasparde, &quot;but sometimes in the PPC we have to go places we don&#39;t like. We are here to look at a VERY SAD story.<br><br>The fanfic was called &#39;A Powerful Love&#39;, and it started like this:<br><br><i>Frodo stumbled over a rock, weeping. &quot;There is no hope,&quot; he said, &quot;no hope at all.&quot;<br><br>No-one was there to hear him. After Sam had died freeing him from the Orcs, he was all alone, out in the desert of Mordor. The Ring was heavy now, whispering in his ear like a malevolent babysitter. There was no hope. No hope at all.<br><br>But... far, far above, in the dark sky, a single star gleamed. Lying on his back, Frodo stared up at it: it was Alpha Centauri, his favourite star, the one he had spent all night staring at once with his beloved she-Hobbit, Sunflower-Jay.<br><br>And all at once it was as if Sunflower-Jay was there with him, lying on the black sand of Mordor. In his mind she turned to look at him, her lips full, her eyes wide. &quot;There is <i>always</i> hope, Frodo,&quot; she said, looking him right in the eyes. &quot;Even in the darkest hour...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; Frodo said weakly, and then, again, &quot;Yes!&quot; He staggered upright, his eyes fixed on the single star. &quot;There is still hope!&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Wow,&quot; said Thranduil the mini-Balrog, &quot;that is a really powerful story.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It should be!&quot; Alice pointed out. &quot;It&#39;s called &#39;A Powerful Love&#39;!&quot;<br><br>Agent Suicide was there too.<br><br>&quot;Then that is a good title for it,&quot; agreed Thranduil. &quot;I really want to find out what happens to Frodo next, and whether he ever sees his beautiful girlfriend Sunflower-Jay again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;d like to, too,&quot; said Gasparde, smiling at her friends, &quot;but we have to go on and look at the next story.&quot;<br><br>&quot;BUT WAIT!&quot; said Monty. &quot;Gasparde, what about the score?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh yes!&quot; gasped Gasparde. &quot;I nearly forgot. You are such a good friend, Monty.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; said Monty modestly.<br><br>Agent Suicide was there too.<br><br>&quot;So I think this story is really good,&quot; Gasparde decided, &quot;and because it is so good I think it deserves a score of 9/10!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wow!&quot; said Thranduil. &quot;That is a really good score. Do you think there are any better stories out there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Gasparde explained. &quot;I think we should go and find out.&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>Chapter 3 - A Love Of Power<br><br>So Gasparde de Grasse jumped through the portal again and found themselves in the worst possible place: SARUMAN&#39;S TOWER. Specifically they were in the deepest darkest dungeons where Saruman keeps all his &#39;special&#39; prisoners.<br><br>&quot;This is scary,&quot; said Alice the talking Pegacorn. &quot;I can&#39;t fly here either.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I hope Saruman doesn&#39;t find us,&quot; Thranduil said. &quot;After he imprisoned the big Balrog and then sent it against the Fellowship (A/N is taht rite?!?) all us Balrogs and mini-Balrogs have been scared of him.&quot;<br><br>Agent Suicide was there too.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; said Gasparde to her friends. &quot;Because we are PPC agents Saruman can&#39;t see us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh yeah I forgot,&quot; said Thranduil. &quot;So where is the awesome fanfic we are here to see?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think it is in the dungeon,&quot; said Monty. Gasparde and her friends went and looked in the window at the story, which was called &#39;A Love Of Power&#39;:<br><br><i>Butterfly was the Princess of Hobbit Country, and she had joined Merry and Pippin when they went with Frodo and Sam to Riverden. Then she had joined the Fellowship because of her amazing skill at healing, but she had been taken prisoner with the Merry and Pippin and taken by the Orcs to Saruman&#39;s Tower. And the Orcs had wanted to hit Merry and Pippin but Princess Butterfly bravely stood up to them so they hurt her and tortured her but it was okay because Merry and Pippin were okay.<br><br>But now they were all three in Saruman&#39;s dungeon, and Saruman came to see them.<br><br>&quot;So, I have captured the famous Princess Butterfly!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Now I can use your powers to take over the world!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will never serve you!&quot; whispered Princess Butterfly.<br><br>&quot;Oh yes you will,&quot; said Saruman, and then he beat her and tore her dress and said, &quot;You will do whatever I tell you to.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No I won&#39;t,&quot; said Princess Butterfly bravely and Saruman spat on her and went away. And ONLY THEN did Princess Butterfly start crying.<br><br>&quot;Oh no Butterfly don&#39;t cry!&quot; said Merry and Pippin but Princess Butterfly was so sad because she was locked away in the dungeon and also Saruman had hurt her and her dress was torn. So then Merry and Pippin went over to her and they kissed her.<br><br>&quot;Oh Butterfly,&quot; said Merry and Pippin, &quot;we have always loved you but we never found the strength to tell you until we saw how brave you are.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh Merry and Pippin,&quot; said Princess Butterfly, &quot;I have always loved you too. And I never told you but Butterfly is only my public name in private I call myself &#39;Jay&#39; and I would like it if you called me Jay too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course we will, Jay!&quot; shouted Merry and Pippin, and then they kissed her again.</i><br><br>Alice wiped a tear from her eye with her wing (A/N rember she iz an PEGACORN). &quot;That story is so incredibly sad,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;Yes, I hope they have a happy ending,&quot; said Monty. &quot;Because it would be awful if three such brave hobbits didn&#39;t have a happy ending.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It really really would be,&quot; said Thranduil. &quot;And I hope they stop Saruman from taking over the world.&quot;<br><br>Agent Suicide was there too.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; said Gasparde, &quot;I think that story is so good I will give it a score of 10/10!&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s an incredible score!&quot; said Monty. &quot;But I think it totally deserves it. Have we got any more stories to look at?&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is only ONE MORE story to look at,&quot; said Gasparde as she opened the portal. &quot;Then we will go and tell the Sub Rosa which one should be given the prize.&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>Chapter 4 - A Lovely Power<br><br>This time when Gasparde and her friends were going into the story the portal WENT WRONG!!! So Gasparde found herself all by herself in the middle of Gondor City. &quot;Oh no!&quot; she said. &quot;Where are all my friends!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I am up here,&quot; said Monty, and Gasparde realised Monty was on her head.<br><br>&quot;Eek!&quot; said Gasparde, and took Monty off carefully. &quot;How did you get on my head?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I DON&#39;T KNOW!&quot; shouted Monty, and Gasparde was shocked, because Monty usually knows everything.<br><br>&quot;Also where are the others?&quot; asked Gasparde.<br><br>&quot;Well, when I was on your head I could see Alice and Thranduil behind this house,&quot; said Monty. &quot;Agent Suicide was there too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay good,&quot; said Gasparde. &quot;We should go and find them.&quot;<br><br>When Gasparde and Monty found them, the other two were looking in through a window into the castle. Agent Suicide was there too. Inside the castle there was a story taking place, which was called &#39;A Lovely Power&#39;:<br><br><i>Jayvangelina was the daughter of Aragorn and Mrs Aragorn, who were King and Queen of Gondor. She had her mother&#39;s black hair and blue eyes and looked just like her. But in her heart she was nothing like her mother, because she was a rebel who wanted to do things her own way. So she called herself &#39;Jay&#39; rather than using her full name (which was elfish), and she cut her hair short whenever she could.<br><br>One day when her hair was long, Jay was in her room when who should come to the door but ARAGORN HER FATHER. &quot;Hello Father,&quot; she said. She didn&#39;t like Aragorn because he was King and tried to tell her what to do, but she didn&#39;t think people should be told what to do.<br><br>&quot;Hello Jayvangelina,&quot; said Aragorn, stepping into the room and closing the door behind him. &quot;You are looking very pretty today.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Jay, even though she knew she was ugly, because she had been raised to be polite.<br><br>&quot;Your mother is not as pretty as you anymore,&quot; said Aragorn. &quot;She is old and wrinkly now, but you are just as pretty as she used to be.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Jay again, although she did not want to be polite because Aragorn was being mean about her mother.<br><br>&quot;In fact, since I am king, I have made a decision,&quot; said Aragorn. &quot;I am going to GET RID of your mother and replace her with YOU. You will be my queen and my wife!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you are old and wrinkly too,&quot; said Jay politely, &quot;and also you are my father.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I will not be old and wrinkly for long!&quot; shouted Aragorn. &quot;Your mother gave you her immortality necklace, and once I have it I will be young forever! Also I am not really your father which is why you don&#39;t look like me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh ok,&quot; said Jay. &quot;But you can&#39;t have my immortality necklace.&quot;<br><br>&quot;OH YES I CAN,&quot; stated Aragorn, &quot;and you can&#39;t stop me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes I can!&quot; stated Jay. &quot;Arbadacarba!&quot; she said which was a magic elfish word, and Aragorn flew out the window.</i><br><br>&quot;Oh wow that was soooo amazing!&quot; exclaimed Alice. &quot;I was so worried when Aragorn was going to make her marry him!&quot;<br><br>&quot;So was I,&quot; said Thranduil. &quot;And I was so relieved when she used her magic powers to get rid of him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes the story is amazingly good,&quot; said Gasparde, &quot;and the best part is, there are forty more chapters of it!&quot;<br><br>Agent Suicide was there too.<br><br>&quot;But Gasparde!&quot; shouted Monty. &quot;How are we going to make sure the Sub Rosa knows this was the best story? The one before it already has the highest marks!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not for long!&quot; stated Gasparde. &quot;As an agent of the PPC, I am going to give this story... 11/10!!!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wow!&quot; said her friends, and they all went back to HQ.<br><br>THE END<br><br><hr>

            <p>Why can he talk? Why is he there? Why is he the only one analyzing the story when there are four people who could be doing that? Frodo would make five, but he&#39;s doing something else. Does the mini-Balrog really agree with female-Gaspard, or is he just pretending to agree with her so that she doesn&#39;t feel bad about her decision?<br><br>THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.<br><br>Also, was Suicide there the whole time, even before they came in? It sounds like he was waiting for them by where Frodo was. Was he stalking Frodo? Another important question. Kind of freaky, too, if he was.</p>

            <p>You still can&#39;t spell. But even with that out of the way, this is not a good story. Your other story had a hope and a preyer, as it actually had a decent plot. This is too meta and too simple. But props for trying!</p>

            <p>Greetings, everyone. I am Cyber-Observer, creator and distorter, a world and a watcher of worlds. Bow to me! BU-WA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! Oh, I kid, I kid. It&#39;s not compulsory, but you can bet I&#39;d enjoy it.<br><br>Anyway, I already have the first few chapters of my Mysterious Somebody story finished, and I&#39;m going to post it here once I get this user profile up and running. I&#39;m actually surprised that more people don&#39;t write about that guy. He was kind of a big deal!<br><br>More stories to come later after I finish that one. Maybe. No promises.</p>

            <p><b><font size="3">CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION TO EVIL</font></b><br><br>“One… Two… Three!”<br><br>Thri-WONK!<br><br>“One… Two… Three!”<br><br>Thri-WONK!<br><br>There is a distinctive sound that is made when a triceratops rams its head into a wall. That sound had resonated through the halls of PPC HQ fourteen-<br><br>Thri-WONK!<br><br>fifteen times in the course of the last few minutes. At an unspecified point in the hallways, not that any point could be specified the same way twice, one could find the source of this sound, one Agent Marsha. With a snort, the gargantuan dinosaur pulled away from the wall she had been charging at repeatedly, sat back on her haunches, and tried in vain to rub the front of her head. Next to her, a comparatively much smaller being stomped its foot in frustration.<br><br>“Come on!” it said, waving its arms frantically in the air. “If you don’t get to busting down this wall pronto, we aren’t going to have enough empty space to build the PPC Arcade!”<br><br>“Thanks for telling me things I already <i>know</i>, Nara,” Marsha snapped, sitting back on her haunches and shaking Generic Surface dust off of herself.<br><br>“Less sarcasm, more wall-smashing!” commanded the now-identified Nara, growing a pair of mandibles just so she could click them in irritation. Being a shapeshifter has its perks.<br><br>Snarling as well as anyone could manage with a beak, Marsha pulled herself back as far as she could in the surprisingly roomy hallway and focused her anger at the spot in the wall that had already been showing large quantities of cracks. Narrowing her eyes, she rushed at it again, her footfalls rumbling in the corridor louder than they ever had before.<br><br>THRI-WONK!<br><br>With a rumble far above, a section of the wall began to collapse in on itself. Nara smiled and crossed her arms in satisfaction, despite having done almost none of the work, and Marsha pulled back just in time to prevent being hit by a perfectly square chunk of material. As the dust settled, however, the two DMS Agents could hear a noise from deep inside where the wall once was. It was low, menacing, and just a little ethereal, but when they focused on it just enough, they knew what it was.<br><br>It was a villainous laugh.<br><br>The Generic Dust swirled and clustered, as though it was being blown about by a very small cyclone, condensing into shapes that lasted for only a few seconds before blowing apart. All the while, the laugh continued, albeit distorted by the sounds of the swirling dust and the noise of a few more pieces of Generic Surface falling down from the ceiling. It was only when the dust settled back to the ground that Nara and Marsha saw the source of the laugh. It was a man, or at least shaped like a man, glowing blue ad wearing what appeared to have once been a white robe. Marsha recognized him immediately.<br><br>“The Mysterious Somebody!”  she exclaimed with surprise.<br><br>“The who?” asked Nara.<br><br>“He used to be in charge of the PPC. Under his reign secret police filled the halls, the Flowers were like his slaves, and everyone had to refer to him by his incredibly silly title because he wouldn’t tell anyone his real name. It was a dark, dark time.”<br><br>“Mysterious Somebody is a <i>menacing</i> and <i>foreboding</i> title!” boomed the blue-tinged man, lifting his arms in the air and rising two feet off the ground.<br><br>“Wait, if he’s dead, what was he doing in our wall?” inquired Nara, still confused.<br><br>“FOOLS!” the Mysterious Somebody declared, swooping toward the Agents. “I am not dead! Not any more! But though I am a ghost, I can still act out my revenge!”<br><br>“Oh, for the whole ‘deposing and killing you’ thing?” asked Marsha.<br><br>“YES! The day I died was the <i>worst day of my life</i>! And now that my ghost is free from that accursed wall, I am free to make everyone in the PPC have the worst day of <i>their</i> lives!”<br><br>“I’ll never let you kill everyone!” Marsha declared, readying herself to attack the being hovering before her.<br><br>“Oh, no, not that,” the Mysterious Somebody replied dismissively. “I considered doing killing you all, true, but I think it will be a much worse day for everybody involved if you are alive at the end to reflect on what a terrible day it was.”<br><br>“I’d be lying if I said that was doing anything to convince me not to charge at you,” remarked Marsha, scraping her rearmost foot back in an intimidation technique she had learned from a long-forgotten movie.<br><br>“Just you try!” the Mysterious Somebody boomed. “Do you think that I will stop my righteous quest to ruin everyone’s day just because I am threatened by a reptile? My reputation as a sinister mastermind would be squashed!”<br><br>It is worth noting that he only had reached the word “righteous” before Marsha began barreling down the hallway at high speed, horns ready and several tons of prehistoric beast behind them. However, there is a reason that people rarely run headlong at ghosts, brandishing weapons of either the stabbing or thrusting varieties. Ghosts are almost gaseous in nature, and can be passed through with great ease by anyone moving at faster than a crawl. Marsha, however, had never encountered a ghost before, and so was enormously surprised when her horns, her head, and then her entire body went flying through the torso of the Mysterious Somebody, who continued to speak unhindered.<br><br>By the time he reached the word “mastermind”, Marsha’s head had smashed through what would have been the far wall of the PPC Arcade. The triceratops, quickly realizing her predicament, tried to free herself, but to no avail. Her bony head-frill had caused her to be stuck fast in the room beyond, and since it was one of Headquarters’s many abandoned Response Centers, no one on the other side was there to help her. The Mysterious Somebody had never even paused in his declaration.<br><br>“Well, that gets rid of one witness.” the ghost announced triumphantly. “I’m probably going to need to kill the other one, though, to keep the dramatic tension up. Shame.”<br><br>“Ha! Good luck!” declared Nara with a smirk. “I’m indestructible! You can’t kill someone who’s indestructible! It’s like… a rule or something!”<br><br>“I am the Mysterious Somebody,” her opponent boomed. “I make the rules.”<br><br>Thrusting his arm forward, he launched a bolt of Force energy at Nara, who reacted instinctively by shifting into a smaller form to dodge the blow. A second blast prompted a second transformation, and after a third, Nara had shifted to the form of a small rodent, and in that size was small enough and fast enough to dodge several other Force blasts. If she had possessed the time do so, she would have gloated, but since time was short, she scampered underneath the Mysterious Somebody and prepared to reassume her full size and strength. However, before she could, the ghost’s eyes glowed brightly, and she was sent soaring across the hallway, crashing into a wall with an almost imperceptible thump.<br><br>Groaning, the rodent form stood up, preparing to shift to a fast-moving form and fetch reinforcements, but she found that she couldn’t shift to her preferred speed form. In fact, she couldn’t shift out of her rodent form at all.<br><br>“Man,” she said, her voice high-pitched and almost unintelligible due to her small size. “This sucks.”<br><br>The Mysterious Somebody floated over to her, grinning an abnormally childish grin. “Say again?”<br><br>“This sucks.”<br><br>“YEEEEEES!” the ghost shouted. “To you, I bestow the first of many terrible days! And I will not rest until the Protectors of the Plot Continuum has the collective worst day in the history of bad days!” The vengeful ghost rose into the air, laughing to himself as he phased through the ceiling.<br><br>Directly above, the Bog Thorn, the Big Thorn’s younger brother, was shuffling down the hallway to see what all the crashing and smashing had been about a few minutes ago. When the laughing ghost appeared directly ahead of him, he stopped with a start, dropping his clipboard and a few other administrative devices on the floor.<br><br><i>How many times have I told people not to do that?</i> he snapped. <i>I am a Flower, and I will not have people passing through walls and floors in front of me! At least you didn’t come down from the ceiling, but mind you, that&#39;s hardly a compliment.</i><br><br>“Really?” asked the ghost. “Would it have made your day worse if I had?”<br><br><i>Undoubtedly</i>, the Bog Thorn replied.<br><br>Wordlessly, the ghost continued to float higher and higher, passing through the ceiling within seconds and promptly reversed direction, floating back down to the Bog Thorn’s level and phasing through the ceiling from the opposite direction.<br><br><i>NOOOO!</i> bellowed the Bog Thorn. <i>I</i> just <i>told you not to do that!</i><br><br>“BU-WA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HAAA!” the Mysterious Somebody laughed, back-flipping through the air in glee and lighting the Bog Thorn aflame with Force lightning on the dismount. As the Flower howled in sudden pain and fled through the halls, the Mysterious Somebody floated leisurely in the opposite direction, brainstorming further revenge.</p>

            <p>Oh, right, my ratings and summary. Those are important.<br><br>Summary first:<br>When the Mysterious Somebody returns from death, he has only one plan in mind for the PPC. Not destruction, not conquest. Those are too overdone. They&#39;d probably never work, anyway, since he&#39;s a ghost and all. No, he plans to ruin their endeavors for the day in any way possible! Watch the menace unfold! Watch the Mysterious Somebody&#39;s triumphant return! And of course, read and review.<br><br>As for rating, I&#39;ll go with PG for now, but it might stretch to PG-13 if I decide to brutally kill someone off in later chapters. Probably not, but we&#39;ll see.</p>

            <p><b><font size="3">CHAPTER TWO: THE FLOWERS&#39; MEETING</font></b><br><br>It was a leisurely day in the Board of Flowers room, formerly known as the Mysterious Somebody’s office. Or at least, it would have been if the Flowers had not been called there to deal with a growing problem reported throughout Headquarters.<br><br><i>Where’s the Sunflower Official?</i> asked the Marquis de Sod from his position atop the Mysterious Somebody’s filing cabinet. <i>He was supposed to be here fifteen minutes ago.</i><br><br><i>Wha?...</i> sounded a voice from under the Mysterious Somebody’s desk. <i>Who said my name?</i> The floral head of a Sunflower poked out from where the desk chair would have sat if the Big Thorn had not been perched precariously on top of it at the other side of the room.<br><br><i>How… how long have you been here?</i> the Marquis asked, taken aback.<br><br><i>Been here the whole taime, I reckon</i>. answered the Really Big Monkey Puzzle Tree, who had been made to sit on the floor after everyone else had taken all of the good office fixtures. <i>The ol’ fella works day an’ night makin’ sure the world’s done saved and the like.</i><br><br><i>Yes, that is definitely what I was doing,</i> the Sunflower Official agreed. <i>Defending this desk from the scourge of Mary Sues. I definitely do not sleep here.<br><br>So…</i> the Marquis shuffled his leaves. <i>You heard what I said to the Sub Rosa about the boiling oil and the tainted fertilizer?</i><br><br><i>Uh.. yes! Very yes. Every word.</i> There was a brief pause as the Sunflower Official pulled the rest of his body out from underneath the desk. <i>And you should be ashamed of yourself. Incidentally, I want you to submit to me the written form of that thing you said, so I can send it to my secretary for a disciplinary review.</i><br><br><i>If you will, Sunflower Official,</i> said the Tiger Lily, who had taken advantage of arriving first in the Board of Flowers room to select a high vantage point atop the Mysterious Somebody’s water cooler, <i>I would like to get to why I called this meeting, now that the entire Board is both present and conscious.</i><br><br><i>Of course, Tiger Lily. Carry on.</i> the DMS Head replied.<br><br><i>Excellent. Now, as you may be aware, there have been a series of severe problems ravaging Headquarters all afternoon. I have called you here to discuss why they have occurred, and see if we can find a cause. Fern, to you.<br><br>Thank you, Tiger Lily.</i> said the Fern, shuffling his papers and nearly coming unhooked from the Mysterious Somebody’s motivational office poster in the process. <i>All those who responded to my department’s inquiries reported the presence of a floating man in association with the events, or as some called him-</i> the Fern made a throat-clearing sound over the shared psychic link as a sign that he was about to use words that were not his own- <i>“totally a ghost, man, I swear, it was all swooshing and flying and talking about ruination and all that stuff ghosts do&quot;. Now, obviously, it cannot be a ghost, because coming back from the dead is highly illegal-<br><br>Woah, wait, it is?</i> interrupted the Sunflower Official.<br><br><i>Yes.</i> asserted the Fern. <i>Extremely.</i><br><br><i>Hold on a minute, then.</i> the SO continued. <i>I need to fire my Time Lord.</i> The Flower produced a smooth green cellular phone, held it up to the light for a few seconds, and then snapped it open and dialed a series of numbers. A few seconds later, a bleary “Hello?” sounded from the other side.<br><br><i>Morgan, it’s your boss. You’re fired.</i><br><br>“What? Why?”<br><br><i>Because you came back from the dead, which I have just been informed by a trusted consultant is highly illegal. You never even told me it was illegal! And then you resurrected a second time! That makes you twice the criminal! A criminal </i>squared<i>, even!</i><br><br>“No, please! Don’t fire me! I have a family to support!”<br><br><i>Liar. I happen to know that your entire species is</i> dead<i>. You’re still fired.</i> With that, the Flower closed his phone, shut it off, and returned the device to where it had been stored it previously. <i>Carry on, Fern.</i><br><br><i>Right. Well.</i> The Fern shuffled his papers again to gather his thoughts before continuing. <i>This unknown entity may be projected by an advanced multi-species hallucinogen, while the being responsible wreaks havoc on us under cover of a “ghost attack”.<br><br>So what’s that got to do with us?</i> interjected the Aloe. <i>Just put the DMFF on it.<br><br>I have reason to believe,</i> continued the Fern, his voice growing brittle from the constant interruptions, <i>that it will soon be targeting the Flowers in particular. If you would just let me finish, then we might be able to find if it has already targeted us. Does anyone have a tragedy to report?<br><br>Darn straight!</i> announced the Marquis de Sod. <i>My post-nap coffee? Burned. Severely. I could barely drink the stuff. It was the good kind, too! Worth more than I pay my secretary in a year! And I swear, just as I was going to go get it, I saw something blue go into my closet. Are ghosts blue?<br><br>There are </i>no<i> ghosts.</i> the Fern stated, harshly.<br><br><i>Yeah, but if there were, would they be blue?<br><br>That doesn&#39;t even MAKE any…</i> The Fern paused, photosynthesizing deeply for a few seconds. <i>They might be. If they existed. Which they don’t. Anyone else?<br><br>A ghost lit my brother on fire earlier,</i> the Big Thorn stated, shakily and quietly. <i>He’s in Medical now, and if we hadn’t found him sooner, he might not have made it. I’m honestly afraid for the safety of the-<br><br>THERE! ARE! NO! GHOSTS!</i> roared the Fern. <i>There is NO such thing! The presence of a ghost would not only be highly illegal, it being able to do anything on this scale would be highly </i>illogical<i>! Now can we PLEASE get back to orderly compiling reports and planning what we are going to do about this absolutely NOT-spectral threat!?<br><br>I’d love to say we could, pardner,</i> the Really Big Monkey Puzzle Tree replied, <i>but I reckon we should prob’ly deal with the def’nitely-not-a-ghost over there before we get to doin’ that.<br><br>The what?</i> The Fern turned to his left and to his right, and about midway between the two directions, he saw the robed figure that was standing in the open doorway with an expression of mixed shock and bafflement on its face.<br><br>“Are you… are you <i>standing</i> on my motivational poster?” inquired the anything-but-a-ghost. “How do you even <i>do</i> that?”<br><br><i>A ghost!</i> declared the Tiger Lily, ignoring the Fern’s cry of <i>No, it’s not a ghost!</i> while leaping down from the water cooler. <i>Since coming back from the dead is illegal, you are therefore... a criminal! Officers! To me!</i><br><br>“You know,” mused the cannot-be-a-ghost absently, “If I locked you in here, I wouldn’t need to hunt you down while you’re in your individual offices. I could just humiliate you all at once later. I think I’m going to go with that.”<br><br><i>Oh, no you don’t, burner of expensive coffee! shouted the Marquis. As long as I remain conscious, you will not go unpunished for ruining my afternoon brew!</i><br><br>Without paying heed to the hat-wearing Flower’s protests, the you-all-know-it’s-the-Mysterious-Somebody’s-ghost-so-let’s-just-out-and-say-it closed the door with a slam. The hinges and locks glowed briefly while the sound of the door closing reverberated through the office, the shock waves of the impact knocking the Fern off of his precarious perch.<br><br>While the Big Thorn and the Really Big Monkey Puzzle Tree, who had been designated arbitrarily as the strongest Flowers present, tried in vain to shove open the Force-closed door, the Fern pulled himself upright. His papers had been scattered across the floor when he landed, a few of his fronds had cracked, and he had almost certainly lost all credibility among his fellow Flowers to determine what did and did not exist.<br><br><i>This is the worst day of my life,</i> he groaned. From outside the Board room door, a voice could be faintly heard laughing in response.<br><br><br>A/N: Now that the Mysterious Somebody has returned and imprisoned the only people who can give the orders to stop him, <i>how</i> will the PPC react? <i>What</i> will he do next? Will Marsha <i>ever</i> remove her head from that wall? Find out next time, same Cyber-site, same Cyber-story! </p>

Trigger warning.<br><br>Genre: Action/Romance<br><br>***********************************************************<br><br>&quot;When I said &#39;kidnap&#39;, I didn&#39;t mean…&quot; Tanya trailed off, realizing that her partner wasn&#39;t listening. Of course, there was also something in the room that was sapping her ability to speak and think.<br><br>Data struggled against his bonds.<br><br>&quot;No, dear, you can&#39;t get out,&quot; Amare crooned, leaning against the chair he was strapped to, so close that her blond hair was brushing his face. He recoiled slightly.<br><br>When I said &#39;kidnap&#39;,&quot; Tanya began again, slightly louder, &quot;I was <i>joking</i>. Let him go.&quot;<br><br>Amare glanced at Tanya. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll let you have a turn after I&#39;m done.&quot; She turned back towards Data and traced a finger down his jawline. &quot;Now, let&#39;s get your shirt off.&quot;<br><br>Tanya choked as Data&#39;s eyebrows shot up. He pressed against the restraints - his muscles flexing quite nicely, Tanya noticed guiltily. &quot;I would not like that,&quot; he said.<br><br>Amare grinned evilly. &quot;You&#39;re going to.&quot; She reached for the back of his uniform top.<br><br>&quot;Amare, don&#39;t!&quot; Tanya cried. Data looked towards her, his golden eyes pleading. She lowered her eyes, trying to hide in her short curly brown hair. As much as she wanted to go over and help him, she was paralyzed. She was sure if she got too close, she would spontaneously combust. Even across the RC, his wide vulnerable eyes were making her insides squirm.<br><br>Well, that wasn&#39;t the only thing making her insides squirm. Amare had found the fastener on his shirt, and despite his struggles managed to remove it. She tossed it to the side.<br><br>Tanya squeaked, but she couldn&#39;t tear her eyes away from Data&#39;s body - slim, pale, muscular, but not overtly so.<br><br>&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Amare said approvingly, running a finger down the middle of his chest. Tanya whimpered softly. She wanted to be in Amare&#39;s place no she wanted to save him no she wanted him no she wanted to help him...help him...<br><br>Amare reached for the waistband of his pants, and both parts of Tanya&#39;s brain came to an agreement.<br><br>&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!&quot;<br><br>She ran across the RC and thrust herself between Data and Amare, bumping Data&#39;s legs and knocking Amare over.<br><br>&quot;Hey!&quot; Amare cried, getting up.<br><br>Tanya whipped around and, with shaking hands, released Data&#39;s restraints. &quot;Get your shirt,&quot; she said, and he didn&#39;t argue.<br><br>&quot;No!&quot; Amare cried, lunging after him. Tanya stepped in the way and spread her arms as Data bent to pick up his shirt.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t touch him,&quot; she said. <br><br>Amare tried to go around, but Tanya matched her movements and stood firm against attempts to push her over.<br><br>Data put on his shirt, and he walked closer to them. As they saw him, the scuffling escalated. Neither of them was particularly skilled, so it mostly consisted of Tanya trying to lean on Amare and knock her over (Tanya being the heavier of the two) and Amare trying to push her off and go towards Data. <br><br>Tanya froze as Data came up behind Amare. She turned, and gasped as he pinched her neck. She crumpled to the ground.<br><br>Tanya took a deep breath, trying to steady her breathing.<br><br>&quot;Do not worry, she is only unconscious,&quot; Data said, stepping over her body to stand tantalizingly close to Tanya. <i>Sure</i> she was hyperventilating out of worry. It wasn&#39;t because she was just fighting and her Lust Object was standing close to her. Of course not.<br><br>She made a soft squeaking sound, then made a louder sound as Data placed his hand on her neck and pushed her against the wall. &quot;I have some questions to ask you,&quot; he said.<br><br>*****************************************************<br><br>A/N Sorry to leave off on a cliffhanger but I&#39;m bored with typing. Read and review! :)</p>

            <p>Data&#39;s voice was far too calm for someone holding a person up against a wall. &quot;I apologize, but I believe you can understand why I do not trust you.&quot;<br><br>Tanya nodded, eyes wide half in terror and half in a sort of perverse pleasure. No no no...<br><br>&quot;First, I would like to know why I was brought her. Second, I would like to know where &#39;here&#39; is. Third, who are you?&quot;<br><br>Tanya tried to talk, but all she managed was a barely audible squeak from the back of her throat. Her mouth was dry and her throat felt more constricted than it already was by Data&#39;s hand. She swallowed. &quot;I -&quot; She squeezed her eyes shut so that Data&#39;s face couldn&#39;t distract her. &quot;I&#39;m Tanya,&quot; she managed.<br><br>&quot;Continue,&quot; Data said, not seeming to mind that she&#39;d started with the third question.<br><br>She took a couple shallow breaths through her nose. &quot;You&#39;re at the headquarters of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum,&quot; she said haltingly. You can do this, Tanya. Make him let you go. Make him like you. “We’re a transdimensional organization that protects people. Like you. Your ship. We&#39;re good.&quot; Oh, yes, very articulate, Tanya.<br><br>&quot;We have security officers,&quot; Data said.<br><br>In the back of her mind, Tanya scoffed at the idea that security officers were anything but useless cannon fodder, but she had to answer Data&#39;s question. &quot;They manipulate your minds so you don&#39;t know. And we wipe your memories afterwards, so you wouldn&#39;t remember.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Creatures...&quot; Tanya said vaguely, mentally grasping for an episode that would help her explain. Nothing came up. Maybe she should tell him that being pushed up against a wall was not helpful to thinking. <br><br>&quot;That is most intriguing,&quot; he said, and released her neck. She exhaled and opened her eyes to see that he&#39;d leaned his hands against the wall - still confining her, but in a way that was less disorienting. Well, moderately so.<br><br>&quot;Why did you kidnap me?&quot; he asked.<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t!&quot; Tanya exclaimed indignantly, desperate for Data to like and trust her. &quot;Amare did, and I&#39;m sure you know what her intentions were!&quot; Please don&#39;t ask please don&#39;t ask...<br><br>&quot;It was your idea, or, at least, you joked about it in such a manner that she believed you would agree with it. Also, she offered you &#39;a turn&#39;, which implies that you would want said &#39;turn&#39; and had expressed that desire to her.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Data...&quot; Tanya locked eyes with him, brown challenging gold. &quot;I would never do that! I wanted to invite you to visit! Really! Please believe me!&quot; How she wanted him to like her!<br><br>He studied her carefully, and she averted her eyes. She could get lost in his beautiful golden eyes, like sensuous lakes on an exotic alien world.<br><br>She shook her head slightly, trying to clear it of purple prose.<br><br>“I believe you are telling the truth. Your story is far too complex to be fabricated.”<br><br>He stepped back, and Tanya took a deep breath. She walked around him and crossed the room, trying to find a distance at which she could talk to him and also function. <br><br>She settled about two meters away, and he turned to face her. “Why did you want me to visit?” he asked.<br><br>“I thought you’d like some of the unique opportunities in the PPC.”<br><br>“What sort of opportunities?” Data asked curiously.<br><br>“I can take you to meet Sherlock Holmes.”<br><br>His eyebrows shot up. “Please explain.”<br><br>She certainly had his attention. It felt a little underhanded to play off her knowledge of him like that, but his expression made up for it. “The PPC…well…it’s transdimensional. One of those dimensions is Sherlock Holmes.”<br><br>Now his eyebrows came together. Tanya was torn between giggling at how cute he was and feeling bad that she’d confused him. She settled on smiling and searching for a way to explain. “Um…there’s a quote I heard once…‘There is no such thing as fiction, just non-fiction written in the wrong universe.’ That’s kind of the basic premise of the PPC. So, in my home universe, your universe is fictional. My universe is probably fictional somewhere. The PPC universe is probably fictional somewhere.” She cut herself off before she could start babbling. <br><br>An eyebrow lift. “I believe the human expression ‘too good to be true’ is applicable here.”<br><br>Tanya fought down a squee. “Well, I can prove it to you,” she said, and went to the console to program in disguises. Then she grabbed a remote activator and typed in the coordinates for the Sherlock Holmes continuum.  <br><br>She nodded to him, and, together, they jumped through the portal.<br><br>**********************************************************<br><br>A/N I probably won&#39;t be able to update this much because I&#39;m working on Glitter Trek: The Next Generation (the sequel to 221bagel&#39;s awesome story - you should all totally read it &#39;cause it&#39;s awesome!)

            <p>...that it is very hard to subdue a human that does not want to be subdued.

            <p>((I&#39;m flattered that you think something I wrote as badfic is actually good. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;ll work for the actual PPC, though, because while Tanya and Amare&#39;s basic dynamic is here (Amare being a crazy fangirl and Tanya being a repressed fangirl), it&#39;s exaggerated. I suppose the difference is that Amare would admit to fantasizing about something like this, while Tanya wouldn&#39;t. Neither would actually do anything (besides Tanya&#39;s original suggestion, which will be revealed later). Also, I&#39;m just worried if I write Data and a character that is something of a self-insert, it&#39;ll get Suvian. Which is why I&#39;m doing it for the badfic game.))<br><br>Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll update soon!</p>

That certanly wasn&#39;t the answer I was wanted. But hey, I could hang out with Lily! That was a plus.<br><br>I got back to the room. I unlocked the closet and let Lily out.<br><br>&quot;So what should we do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We could have a party.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure why not?&quot;<br><br>So we partied. Like a hour. There was beer and everything.<br><br>Then all of a sudden we saw a werewolf that had been in the room the whole time. We screamed.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a werewolf.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br><br>So we went to the portel.<br><br>&quot;Where should we go?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Somewhere without a werewolf?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good idea.&quot;<br><br>And so we went, cluelessly, into the portel, to get away, from the werewolf that wanted to kill us.<br><br>(Author&#39;s note: Like the cliffhanger?

            <p>Chapter 2 - The Resuce<br><br>(Author&#39;s note: WOW, peoplea re noticing my story! xX-VerceMaster-Xx, good to know that you enjoy my perspective. However, Kelly Harrington is not going to strop disapproveing of mysogynistic murder. JayBird, come on. Could you at least read the story before dropping such a cruel opinion? I&#39;d type out a mean all-caps flame for you, but it would likely go over your head).<br><br>While trying to blend into the backgrround on my first mission - which I&#39;d already mastered, being with the CIA and all - I talked with the other guy, who still hadn&#39;t told me his name.<br><br>&quot;So who&#39;s she?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s Lily. Our Sue.&quot;<br><br>Great. Now I could add anti-female slurs to my list of things wrong with this oragnization. <br><br>I waited patiently, for a perfect opportunity to make my move. Eventaully I saw my chance and went at the boy, grasping his neck and choking him. After a few minutes of this, he fell to the ground, obviously dead.<br><br>&quot;Lily!&quot; I shouted.<br><br>Lily turned around. I could tell she didn&#39;t want to be interrupted. &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;My name is Kelly Harrington. I&#39;m going to make you an offer here. I just killed somoene who wanted to kill you. And they&#39;re going to send more people to kill you unelss you come with me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay.&quot; And Lily came with my through the portal.<br><br>&quot;Now,&quot; I told her, &quot;To do this you got to be stealth. What are you best at, blending in or hiding?&quot;<br><br>She looked indecisive.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m gonna say that means hiding. You can hide in the closet.&quot; And with that, I gently nudged her over before locking her inside.<br><br>After that, I left the room and wandered the halls, analyzing the various agents. This was interrupted by my videophone, which told me that CIA Commander Erik wanted to talk with me.<br><br>I crept into an out of the way area, before talking. &quot;This is Kelly Harrington. What is it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Someone knows you&#39;re shouldn&#39;t be there.&quot; I was worried. &quot;You have to find out who.&quot;<br><br>(Author&#39;s note: Wow, I think that chapter was the best yet! If you disgaree, you have no soul. R&amp;R!)</p>

            <p>Title: Kelly&#39;s Life<br><br>Summary: Anger. Misogyny. Murder. This is the legacy of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum - and it&#39;s why the CIA sent Kelly Harrington undercover to tear it apart from the inside.<br><br>Genre: Action/Adventure/Suspense/Romance<br><br>Rating: PG-13<br><br><br><br>Chapter 1 - The Undercover Girl<br><br><br><br>(Author&#39;s note: This fanfic goes out to the love of my life, Erik, who introduced me to the PPC back in August. Also, this is my first story so please, please don&#39;t hate it. Got it?)<br><br>After a plane ride, a bus ride, another plane ride and another bus ride, we finally reached a wierd door in the middle of nowhere and CIA Commander Erik finally decided to clue me in on what was to about to be happening. About time.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re go undercover in the PPC.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whatis that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s this group of woman-killers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, sometimes they kill men, but mostly it&#39;s women. And hey, half of the PPC is women themselves, so you won&#39;t stick out.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great, that makes me feel so much better.&quot;<br><br>&quot;OK!&quot;<br><br>We kissed.<br><br>&quot;One two three!&quot;<br><br>All of a sudden, wierd magically things started happening and before I could even react I was somewhere else.<br><br>&quot;Name?&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s a unicorn.

            <p>So since you were so kind to include an review yourself for me, I thought I would leave a reveiew for you. This was a cool story, I like how there are others that learned of the PPC and dont nececerally aprove of the practice of killing the Sues. We know they are evil, but how do the others? I hope that she comes to see our ways, but if not then she must DIE!!! Sorry, its just the PPC is so cool, I dont want to see it sabotaged and ruined.<br><br>Good job so far, keep up the good work!<br><br>((Actually, I do want to see something like this actually written for the PPC. It would be easy to misunderstand what the PPC is about, so having some agency send in an undercover agent to learn more about the nature of this strange organization would not be too unreasonable. If it came down to it, said agency may tell the agent to try and sabotage the PPC, and answer for its murderous actions. It could be interesting, and funny as heck too. Just a thought.))</p>

            <p>The story of Verce Jumper, and how he changed the PPC. This is my first story with him, so plese be nice to him.<br>Genre: Action<br>Rating: PG-13<br><br>Chapter One: The comeing of Verce Jumper<br><br>Throught the existance of man, they have wondered, &quot;Am I alone?&quot; When they ask this, they usualy think of other planets, ailiens. Many know for certain that ailiens exist, in fact so many, it is just about scientific fact, but because stupid people exist, it cannot be called so. But a few know of the existance of more then just ailiens, but beings from entirely diferent worlds. Not planets. Worlds. Univerces. They know of the existance of the multiverce, and know that beings live there. But a even more select few can viset these worlds. This story follows one of those few, and how he came to meet the organization that protects some of those worlds. This is the story of Verce Jumper<br><br>Verce Jumper was sitting in his Library, reading the Lord of the Rings, a pen in his hand as he scribbled some notes inside the books. Before we continue too far with the story, I should talk about the Library. The Library is no regular library, but rather a seperate world made enitrely out of books and bookshelves. This was the home of Verce Jumper, the home he built and made for himself. Inside, time does not pass, and there is no need for food or drink or bathrooms. He built it like this because he knew he would have to have all this to be able to read all of the books in there. He has this library, because he needs it to travel to worlds. But that is about to become evedent, so let&#39;s  continue with Verce Jumper. Verce Jumper was reading the Lord of the rings, a pen in his hand, as he wrote in the books. He was making corrections to the word of Tolkeen, as he had just been to Middle Earth, and knew that several parts of it were inacuite. &quot;Tom Bombadill does not exist, as he is me...&quot; he muttered, chekleing as he thought back to that time. When he viseted, he wanted to meet Tom, because he seemed like a cool guy, though he was useless to the story, and was sad to see that Tom was so useless that he did not exist. Still, he knew that the Hobbits had to meet Tom, as he was so important to how the quest worked from then on, though he could not remember what he did exactly to be so important. He danced and sang to the little hobbits, patted them on the head, and saved them from the writes by using his sonic screwdriver he stole from the Doctor behind their back. That was so much fun. &quot;Sauron&#39;s eye does more then just look at you...&quot; This was a particularly painfull memory, as the eye can shoot fireballs from the pupill, as a way to defend. That was not so fun. He continued down the list of differences, and corrected for a time, but eventually, he found himself getting bored. Well, there was one thing to do when he was bored.<br><br>Verce Jumper closed his book with his eyes, and focused on the book. He pulled on it, trying to tugg the source of the book free and use it to Jump. You see, he travels though stories, thats why he lives in a library. WIth this library, he can travel to the worlds of any story he wants, though there energies. Verce Jumper pulled across the Worlds, using the length of story as a rope to pull himself. Then, instead of him pulling, he felt being pulled. Between the worlds, a gigantic hole was there, sucking in all things around it inside. But this was the Space Between Space, and so there was nothing to pull.<br><br>Except Verce Jumper.<br><br>Verce Jumper struggled against the hole, but it was to strong. &quot;HOLD ON!!&quot; he yelled at himself. &quot;IT CAN NOT BE. THIS IS NOT HOW IT SHOULD EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br><br>bUT IT WAS TOO LATE. Verce Jumper was sucked into the hole.<br><br>{A/N: Sorry to leve you on such a clifhanger, but it is just the best plase to end! Please rate in reviews, I want to see what you think. Cool so far right? I prmace I will get the next chapter out soon. Till then. Bie!!]</p>

            <p>Chapter Two: Fall In!<br><br>A/N: Part two! Sorry for the wait, but I had soo much to do! Still, at least it was not, oh, 7 months untill the next update! That wold be AWFUL!! Anyway, here you go!<br>((Oh, and if you are wondering why I&#39;m responding to this post rather then part one; For some reason my computer blocked access to the first part, so I had to do the next best thing.))<br><br>In PPC HQ, for once, everything seemed happy. Printworthy was able to walk down the halls withought having to hear the screams of crazy agents ecchoing down the halls . He was on his way to the library to find some more material on Indiana Jonas. For some reason, his DVD case only had the first three movies, but he knew there was a fourth somewhere. As he was walking down the hall, he heard a sound. &quot;-NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!&quot;<br><br>BAM!!! Printworthy fell to the ground, with a human on top of him, tangled in a mass of flesh and fur. [A/N: Get your mind outa the gutter!] This was not the first time the found himself in this position either, remembering the time he and his current partner, Marvin, met eachother for the first time. [A/N: I said out!] Printworthy tryed to unfurl himself, but found it much easyer then usual, as the stranger had already escaped the mass.<br><br>The human stood and looked around, ignoring the pony at his feet. &quot;Oh. Well. That went far better then expected.&quot; He smiled doffily, like the meme face shows for things going better then expected. Then he screamed. &quot;WRONG!!!&quot; he called out, clutching his head in agony. &quot;WRONG!! THIS UNIVERCE IS ALL WRONG!!!&quot; <br><br>Printworthy stood and came on over to the man as he scrame. <i>Fantastic,</i> the pony thought, as he came to the man, <i> never can have a day withought screaming, can I?</i> Printworthy put his hoof on the man&#39;s sholder after he walked over, trying to comphort the mad man. &quot;Are you OK?&quot;<br><br>&quot;ITS ALL WRONG, DONT YOU UNDERSTAND!?!?! THE UNIVERCE, THE MULTIVERCE, REALITY, EVERYTHING!!! IT IS SO, SO WRONG!!!&quot;<br><br>PRintworthy looked concerned. &quot;I take that as a no, right?&quot;<br><br>The man looked up to the pony with a grey and white mane, a blue coat, and an open book cutiemark with a quill. He was not surprised that the pony could talk, as he had been to Equestria before and had a house there and had almost dated Pinkie Pie once. No, he was surprised as the pony wore a swiss army nife on a shirt. &quot;Why are you wearing a swiss army nife on your shirt?&quot;<br><br>Printworthy huffed a little. &quot;It is not a swiss army nife, it is a patch, representing my loyalty to the All Porpous Department. And this is not a shirt, it is a uniform for the PPC.&quot;<br><br>The man nodded a little. &quot;Oh. That makes sence. BUT EVERYTHING ELCE IS WRONG!!!&quot;<br><br>Printworthy used magic to wipe away the tears and some of the pain of the man&#39;s suffering. &quot;I am sorry, but what is wrong?&quot;<br><br>The man jumped up and grabbed the pony by the fur. &quot;Do you not understand!? the multiverce is inspires novels, not inspired by them! This world is written by words, as is the enitrety of this sector of the multiverce! It is not how it works! It is not how it should work!! EVERYTHING HERE IS WRING!!!&quot;<br><br>Printworthy was shoked. The idea that worlds could exist withought being dictated by words was new to him, except when it was not, but then he knew better and so could not imagine worlds without the WOrds now. the unicorn cleared his thought. &quot;I cannot help with that, and I am sorry, but that is how it is here. By the way what is your name?&quot;<br><br>The man blinked in confusment. &quot;How could you live in a artificial place like this? And my name is Verce Jumper.&quot;<br><br>Printworthy shrugged and nodded. &quot;I suppose you get used to it. Oh, nice name there.&quot;<br><br>Verce Jumper nodded and sniffed, the pain still there from everything being wrong, but he could ignore it now. &quot;Realy? I guess I am getting used to it already, so I suppose, but it is just so... wrong, you know? Oh, thank you, I chose it myself.&quot;<br><br>Printworthy smiled as Verce Jumper seemed to be calm now. &quot;That is good. Just let the Words seap into you, and all will be fine. Oh, chose yourself? That is cool. Mine was written by an author somewhere, I dont know were.&quot;<br><br>Verce Jumper smiled back. &quot;Yeah, these Words are comphorting arent they? Yeah, I chose it myself. It is a symbolic name actually.&quot;<br><br>Printworthy raised a black eyebrow. &quot;Yeah, they are comphorting. Wait, symbolic for what?&quot;<br><br>Verce Jumper pulled himself up higher so he looked bigger and more important. &quot;Symbolic for thefact that I can Jump across Verces. Univerces that is. I am a univerce jumper.&quot;<br><br>Printworthy pinned Verce Jumper against the wall with his horn, scowling. &quot;You are a univerce jumper? Then you must be a Mary Sue! Perpair to meat your doom, Sue!&quot;<br><br>Verce Jumper was confused. Sue? Him&gt; But he was not even female. Then he remembered Stus and then he was still in troble. Then he remembered why the univerce was wrong. &quot;Wait!&quot; he said, talking reason. &quot;I am not a Sue!&quot;<br><br>Printworthy pushed him harder thouigh the wall. &quot;How do I know?&quot;<br><br>Verce Jumper struggled against the horn power. &quot;Because I am not from your sector of the multiverce. I am not from an authors pen, so I cannot be a Sue! That and I am male.&quot;<br><br>Printworthy fell in shock. Of corce. How could he be a Sue if he was not written by a sue writer? It all made sence, rare within the PPC. &quot;Well, I am sorry.&quot; he said, letting Verce Jumper down from his horn power. &quot;I did not even think about that. So if you are not a Sue, then you have to become an Agent.&quot;<br><br>Verce Jumper stepped back into the wall. &quot;An agent of what?&quot;<br><br>Printwothy pointed to his patch. &quot;The PPC. We kill Sues. It is fun, realy.&quot;<br><br>Verce Jumper thought for a moment about it. &quot;If I dont?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then you are neralized and you forget all about the PPC and this multiverce. Join and you protect some plots. What do you say?&quot;<br><br>Verce Jumper thought some more. Join and remember, or dont join and forget? Join and kill, ork dont join and let people not be protected. He knew what he had to do. his curiosity about this world was too great, and he had to pritect the plots of the people he saw in the worlds, no matter if they are worded or not. Verce Jumper stepped forward and shook Printworthy&#39;s hoof. &quot;Where do I sign up?&quot;<br><br>[A/N: And, chapter 2 done! I will have the 3st chapter up for you guys soon! Hope you rate and review, it really helps me! See you next time!]</p>

            <p>Okay, interesting story. Love that you included a pony! A little too abstract for my tastes, though. I cannont work logic into this story if I tried. But continue! Maybe you&#39;ll surprise me! PS Verce is a cool name. Is that Italian?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry you thought it was abstract though. I wanted to have a mysterious atmosphere for most of it, as this verce is strange for Verce Jumper, and he has no understanding of what the heck is going on here. I suppose I sucseeded though, as it was as confusing for you as Verce Jumper. So...Thanks?<br><br>Actually, Verce is my shorthand for univerce, or multiverce. To him, they are all just verces, thus his name is Verce. Cool right? Well that is just the begining of his coolness. You will see soon...</p>

            <p><i>So tihs is the sotry of Christianne an Eledhwen and WAHT HAPPNES TO TEHM. R*R PLX1<br><br>Action/Drama, PG-13</i><br><br>Christianne started to notice things going wrong as soon as she woke up. Usually her partner Eledhwen was waiting to give her a kiss to say hello [A/N: I no tehy r suppossed to be going out now bu in my sotry there realtionship is PURRLY PLATE TONIC. So itt was a kis on TEH CHICK ok?!}, but this morning SHE WAS NOT THERE.<br><br>&quot;I wonder where Eledhwen is,&quot; Christianne stated, and went into the Reaction Centre.<br><br>Eledhwen was sitting in front of the console. She looked like she was reading a book, and also she was only wearing a bikini made of black metal. Christianne thought that was a little strange.<br><br>&quot;Hello Christianne,&quot; she said. &quot;What is that book you are reading and also why are you wearing a bikini made of black metal.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh hello Christianne,&quot; stated Eledhwen. &quot;It is a book about how to be nice to people and do you like my bikini?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes I do,&quot; said Christianne, &quot;you look very nice.&quot; (A/N: Purrly plate tonic!!1 rember?( &quot;But maybe I would like it better if you took it off.&quot; {A/N: Shes onli sayign taht becas she wants to pollish it fore her b/c seh is a goo freind adn PURRLY PLATE TONIC=<br><br>&quot;Well maybe I will,&quot; said Eledhwen, but then the console said &quot;BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEP&quot; (A/N: Lol)<br><br>&quot;Oh we have a mission,&quot; said Christianne.<br><br>&quot;Yes we do,&quot; said Eledhwen, and they went on their mission.<br><br>When they got on their mission Christianne looked down at herself and her disguise. &quot;Why am I wearing only a pink nightdress?&quot; she asked. &quot;And also why am I tied up?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That would be because you look good in a pink nightdress,&quot; said Eledhwen (A/N: PURRLY PLATE TONIC!!1), &quot;and also because I lied.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You lied down?&quot; Christianne asked. &quot;But I thought elfs always stood up to sleep.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They do,&quot; said Eledhwen. &quot;But that is my other lie. I was actually reading a book about how to be mean to people - and I am not an elf! That is why I am wearing a bikini made of black metal!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gasp!&quot; gasped Christianne. &quot;But I thought you were an elf!&quot;<br><br>&quot;NO,&quot; stated Eledhwen. Her pointed ears fell off and her hair stood up straight and it was black like her bikini and her teeth started to grow into fangs. &quot;I am actually A GIANT SPIDER.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh no I do not like giant spiders,&quot; stated Christianne. &quot;And also where are we?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We are in Milkwood, HOME of the giant spiders!&quot; exclaimed Eledhwen. &quot;And now I am going to take you back to my web and trap you and turn back into my true form and then eat you!&quot;<br><br>&quot;OH NO YOU ARE NOT!&quot; said Christianne, &quot;because I was just stalling you by asking those questions and now I have freed my arms!&quot; And her arms were free from the ropes which Eledhwen had used to tie her up.<br><br>&quot;Your arms may be free but you cannot escape from me!&quot; explained Eledhwen and ran towards her.<br><br>Using her powers of deduction learned from Sherlock Homes himself, Christianne threw up a wall of pure force to blunt Eledhwen&#39;s charge.<br><br>&quot;You cannot escape me!&quot; Eledhwen snarled, her fangs growing longer by the second. &quot;I am the Spider Queen of Mirkwood!&quot;<br><br>Oh yes I can!&quot; Christianne exclaimed. &quot;You forget, Eledhwen - I know your secret name!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you will never use it!&quot; stated Eledhwen, and she jumped over the wall and...........<br><br>Kissed Christianne on the lips!<br><br>Now Christianne was surprised by this because they only had a purrly plate tonic relationship, but she soon realised that the kiss was not plate tonic......<br><br>IT WAS A KISS OF DEATH.<br><br>So then Christianne used her powers of deduction to jump backwards away from Eledhwen before she could kill her. &quot;Why did you try to use a kiss of death on me?&quot; she asked her.<br><br>&quot;Because actually I am in love with you,&quot; she said, &quot;but you never noticed and so I am going to kill you rather than live without you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh ok,&quot; she said, &quot;but there is something you should know before you do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What is that?&quot; she stated.<br><br>Christianne took a deep breath. &quot;Elredwendy Eiffelrochester,&quot; she said, using Eledhwen&#39;s secret name (A/N: Ok so tahts how I rember it but i cant&#39; be bothred to cechk rite now!), &quot;actually I am in love with you too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh ok,&quot; said Eledhwen. &quot;Then I guess I&#39;ll go out with you rather than killing you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ok,&quot; said Christianne, and that was what they did.<br><br>A/N: I NO RITE!!1 SUPRISE!!! So I rote a sotry abut Waht they did neckst but I lost it so yea. Anywas PLS REVUE NO FLAMES K??!??!1//1?</p>

Saying &quot;Oh My&quot; could be treated as either a good or a bad thing, so I&#39;m not sure if you were in character or not in that last post, but in-universe, fanficWorld isn&#39;t an extension of the PPC Board. It&#39;s <i>about</i> the PPC, but it isn&#39;t <i>part</i> of it, at least from from the perspective of those &quot;posting&quot; on fanficWorld. It&#39;s less convoluted than it sounds.<br><br>Out-of-character dialogue is indicated by double-parentheticals, like the ones I&#39;m using.

            <p>of crossovers that someone should write. This will be interactive, if anyone wants to add.<br><br>(And sorry if none of that made sense; I&#39;m still in badfic-writer mode.)<br><br>One crossover that I would like to see happen (but consider too daunting to write right now) is a <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i>/<i>Doctor Who</i> fic.

            <p>Another that I would want to see happen is a crossover with the chaarcters of <i>Divine Misfortune</i> in the universe of <i>American Gods</i>. I would love seeing the way the characters of the former change in the harsher, less god-friendly world of the latter, and what their thoughts on it would be.<br>Oh, and Gorgoz.

            <p>so unfortunately I cannot vouch for your suggestion, but from what you said it sounds interesting indeed.<br><br>I also sort of want to know what the Doctor would think of what Door did to Islington and Croup and Vandemar at the end of <i>Neverwhere</i>.

Can you... me, Van?<br><br><b>Agent Nguyen</b>: Bah, I got some static on my end. I think the creativity shield is blocking some of your transmissions. Everything all right down there?<br><br><b>A.S</b>: It’s funny. I can hear y… fine. <br><br><b>A.N</b>: One-way interference then. Fantastic. If this audio link drops out, I’m getting you out. <br><br><b>A.S</b>: Aw, come on! It’s …shot at finding Harris.<br><br><b>A.N</b>: He’ll be fine. He’s got this sort of… immunity against these of things.  No matter what trouble he lands into, he can escape it with a minimum of injuries. Where are you now?<br><br><b>A.S</b>: …eird. It’s like an RC… agent pair and …is a canon character. How… read Words…<br><br><b>A.N</b>: Um, if you wanna read the story’s Words, just relax your eyes and look off into the distance. It’s like looking at a wall, but focusing your eyes on something that would be behind it. It’s hard to do at first but you’ll get the hang of it pretty soon. As for your whereabouts… um… lessee… Ah. I think you’ve portalled into a shipfic between some agent, her crazy partner, and their Lust Object. Ick. Harris can’t be far, now.  Begin your sweep.<br><br><b>A.S</b>: Yeah, yeah, I … Van. That’s strange. I don’t see… Maybe he’s … else?<br><br><b>A.N</b>: Okay, getting a lot of static on my end. You said he’s not there, right? <br><br><b>A.S</b>: Right.<br><br><b>A.N</b>:  Hm. Well, you are in a RC, so the first thing Harris would have done once he’d realized he’s in badfic is portal out. Considering he forgot his gear here, he’d have gone to the console portal generator.<br><br><b>A.S</b>: Should I check… logs?<br><br><b>A.N</b>: Portal logs? Go for it. Just don’t get caught. <br><br><b>A.S</b>: …creepy. Pale-skin-man is leaning… woman. <br><br><b>A.N</b>: That’s uncomfortable shipfic for you.

Er, I don’t know if it’s gonna shield you to that extent. You are a stranger in her RC after all. Just wait until the fic starts describing something and access the logs. Suvians can’t act and be described at the same time.<br><br><b>A.S</b>: Okay…  I’ve got them. Printing logs.<br><br><b>A.N</b>: Good. Duck outside into the corridor and have a look.<br><br><b>A.S</b>: I’m outside. …strange. The console … empty.<br><br><b>A.N</b>: Did you print the right file?<br><br><b>A.S</b>: Yeah, it says “Portal gen… logs for RC…” and nothing underneath it except a in/out… to the “STK-TNG” verse.<br><br><b>A.N</b>: That would be the kidnapping of the canon character for this particular badfic. Ugh, are you sure he’s not hiding in the washroom or something?<br><br><b>A.S</b>: The RC was just… single room. Sparsely furnished. Impossible to hide.<br><br><b>A.N</b>: <i>Ah, crisse.</i> He must’ve ventured into the fanficWorld version of HQ. Well, hopefully the standard laws of navigating the corridors apply and you’ll have to amble about blindly until you run into each other. <br><br><b>A.S</b>: What happened to… “careful?” And what’s this about ambling blindly? <br><br><b>A.N</b>: Look, d’you see any other way we can find Harris? You’re gonna have to forget about him, walk around a sparkly, parallel version of the most convoluted maze in existence, inadvertently wander into more PPC-themed badfics, rage at the awful, and run into Harris just when you think you’re never going to find him.<br><br><b>A.S</b>: Think about… just said. How can I find… without searching for him?<br><br><b>A.N</b>: But that’s how Headquarters works... well, <i>our</i> HQ at any rate. How long have you been here anyways?<br><br><b>A.S</b>: Just over a week.<br><br><b>A.N</b>: And nobody told you how to get around HQ? Well, I’d guess that <i>would</i> work to some extent, but…<br><br><b>A.S</b>: Well, I got… of basic training… under Mr. Mansfield, but… about complaining about some Legal Department… interferes with the Duty. He wants navigable… at the very least.<br><br><b>A.N</b>: Mansfield? That new guy in Personnel with the recruitment scheme? Hah! Legal’s not going anywhere anytime soon. ‘Sides, half the fun of walking around HQ is not knowing who or what you’re going to run into. Hang on a minute, I just gotta tell this to Penny, she’d get a real laugh out of this… Right. Where was I?<br><br><b>A.S</b>: Getting around…<br><br><b>A.N</b>: Oh! Right, getting around HQ.

            <p>He has a lot of the best lines. Then again, almost everyone has something awesome to say. Bravest Warriors is just that type of show, where awesomeness and hilarity trump development of the plot.<br>It&#39;s been a full season, and I still don&#39;t know what half of the characters are doing there, but there&#39;s enough to enjoy that the details don&#39;t matter. Fun is fun.<br><br>According to the wiki, there were a few other members of the Orange Team revealed prior to the three new ones. The one team that nobody was revealed as part of was the Yellow Team, and there&#39;s only one person in Purple Team, but since that person is using the same cubicle number as Harris Frost, who&#39;s in Orange Team, that might be a record error. Unless different teams can share cubicles. They might, but I don&#39;t know what the reason would be for doing so, organizationally speaking. Do they?<br><br>What exactly differentiates the teams, by the way? I remember that the last time I asked you questions on the Department of Intelligence, you clarified how the spies are assigned to each team, but now I&#39;m wondering what each team&#39;s duties are. Are there distinct methods that each team uses, or certain types of continua that are only covered by certain teams, or some other distinguishing traits?<br>A quick scan of the wiki page says that the second is unlikely, since Green Team has specialists working in everything from classic literature to modern anime, but it might just be that the DoI category system is structured differently than I thought it was.</p>

            <p>Teams are just rotated around different duties on a day-to-day basis. For example:<br><br><b>Day 1:</b><br><br>-Red Team on Action duty. Occupies the Cubicle Maze.<br><br>-Blue Team on Assignment duty. Agents assign fics to Action Department teams from their Response Centres.<br><br>-Green, Yellow, Purple, and Orange Teams are on sorting duty.<br><br><b>Day 2:</b><br><br>-Orange Team on Action duty, relieves Red team from the Cubicle Maze.<br><br>-Red Team takes over Assignment duty from Blue. Agents get to sleep in!<br><br>-Blue Team returns to assignment duty. Purple Team next in line for Action.<br><br><b>Day 3:</b><br><br>-Purple Team on Action duty, relieves Orange Team.<br><br>-Orange Team moves on to Assignment duty, relieves Red. <br><br>-Red Team returns to Sorting. Yellow next in line for Action.<br><br><br>...and so on. The main purpose of this mechanism is to make sure every agent gets to spend some time outside of HQ on a regular basis. <br><br>Each team has the same duties to perform; breaking them up into teams is for ease of rotation. Additionally, they don&#39;t wear any signs that identify them as being part of a colour team. <br><br>As for your question pertaining to cubicles, you are correct in saying that different teams share cubicles. Using the rotation example above, if Red Team agents stationed at 8912 Prospit Crossing leave a mess in their cubicle and don&#39;t clean it up before the end of their shift, the Orange Team agents who are assigned to 8912 Prospit are going to have a really bad time wallowing through the litter.</p>

            <p>Now the Badfic games have begun and it is pretty hilarious. Since some of us are going Suethor and writing Sues and badfic parodies, I had a thought/prompt for a fic.<br><br>What if a Sue gained self-awareness? By that, I mean the Sue did not want to be a Sue. Perhaps having a Suvian prophecy repeated to her many times made her tired. (Being one of the last Dragon Lords or Time Lords, being the Tenth Walker, spouse of Sherlock Holmes; mother of his children, etc...) or seeing that she broke up so many relationships and realized that she never had anyone&#39;s love- it was just her LU being under the effects of Aura of Smooth. she might have yearned for someone to genuinely love her. (and now it gets a bid Sue-ishly sappy)<br><br>It seems unlikely that something like this would happen; a Sue doesn&#39;t want to be a Sue. But if anyone is willing to write this, I will gladly read it.<br>I might write this now...</p>

            <p>A Sue self loathing in a realistic way is tricky. The hard bit may well be writing the dawning realization nobody is going to pick them up, listen to wangst, and give them a cookie. Although the cookie may be optional.<br><br>I see this as an interesting take on how glitter works in Suvian flesh. Our hypothetical Sue is losing glitter concentration in the dermis. Pow! A plot device punches them, and they stare dumbfounded at the bruised normal tissue, and flawless shiny flesh. I now really want to read something like this.</p>

            <p>I think that would be an issue for the majority of borderline/ex-sues/stus. It&#39;s why ficpsych has their sue-support group, after all the stus and sues go basicly from beloved and badass to having nothing and being hated and bullied by everyone just for who you are.</p>

            <p>It appears that the Sue develops self-awareness. In Suedom the characters were originally non-Suvian and merely happened to be stuck as Sues in Middle-earth.</p>

            <p>I think it could work. You have given me thought for one of my agent characters actually. He all ready has internal conflict over feeling useless without his suevian powers to the fear of going full sue if he uses them too much on missions. Now he has to worry about if his LO ever loved him or loved his Aura. Kinda feel bad now</p>

            <p>Well, hold on, let me explain. No, there is too much, let me sum up:<br><br>Durring my travels on the internet, I was looking for some MLP MST&#39;s. I knew about Fan/fic/ Theater 3000, but surely there were others. Lo and behold, I found <a href="http://ponyriffs.weebly.com/index.html">Ponyriffs</a>, a site meant to archive various MST&#39;s from the pony fandom. It had some moderate levels of success, having several MSTers from the bronyhood come in and host their snarky comments on badfic on the site, and several more reading them. But then something happened. The creator of Ponyriffs decided that he wanted more, and so created a second website: <a href="http://mstnetwork.weebly.com/index.html">The MST Network</a>, a site to archive and host hundreds of MSTs from any and all fandoms.<br><br>The only problem is that nobody knows it exists.<br><br>This was an ambitious project to begin with, and Ponyriffs only worked because of the passion of the folks behind Fan/fic/ Theater 3000. Now that they are falling to the wayside, even Ponyriffs is starting to fall. It&#39;s not dead yet, not by any means, but it is weaker. The MST network on the other hand is a wasteland, the forums full of months old topics, and only two MST seres actually being hosted on the site. Yet it is still somewhat breathing. It may be on life support, but she&#39;s not dead yet.<br><br>There were 36 visitors within the last 24 hours, and a couple of new threads made. It can be brought back, but it needs help to do so, and I think the PPC can do it. We make fun of badfic, and MSTs are a large part of our community. If some borders will go over to the website, extend the hand of friendship, and tell other MSTers from other groups about this site, we could make it live again. If you have an MST seres of your own, contact the webmaster though the links on the &#39;Contact Us&#39; page and offer to have them host it. Say hello on the forums and interact with the (few) people there. Or don&#39;t, and let it fall the the wayside, never letting it see its full potential. It was doomed anyway, right? Whatever, do what you will, I just wanted to give this place some attention.<br><br>(You know, maybe my Time Lord name should have been the Preacher...)</p>
