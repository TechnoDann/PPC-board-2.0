            <p>I&#39;ll be brief. Cyba said this in another thread:<br><blockquote cite="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=239048;title=PPC">
<br>Cyba Zero<br>Actually, I think Latin&#39;s fairly popular around here.<br>Sat Mar 9, 2013 5:53am<br>86.130.168.86<br><br>I know a smattering, but I&#39;d probably have to consult a dictionary and tables of endings for most of it, now, and I only ever got taught the present tense. I also remember somebody complimented me on using proper Latin endings once... Kitty Noodles, maybe?<br><br>Perhaps Latin and good writers are drawn to one another (perhaps because good writers are less likely to be afraid of Latin&#39;s copious amounts of grammar, or because being drilled in said grammar encourages good writing).<br>
</blockquote>
<br><br>So now I&#39;m curious, and instead of hijacking another thread, I&#39;m asking my questions here:<br><ul>
<br><li>How many of you have taken any Latin classes?</li>
<br><li>Why were you interested in Latin?</li>
<br>And most importantly<br><li>Has Latin helped you in your writing?</li>

            <p>I believe that it is high time that I answer my own questions.<br><br>Not counting a brief stint in a Latin class in high school, I have spent one and a half years of Latin classes: I took Latin in college.<br><br>I was interested in Latin because I wanted to take Biblical languages, and I did not know at the time that Hofstra offered Greek classes (and yes, I did eventually take Greek as well).<br><br>As for how it affected my writing, I can&#39;t honestly say that it has done much. I <i>do</i> remember that it was in Latin class that I figured out the difference between &quot;who&quot; and &quot;whom&quot; (&quot;who&quot; is nominative, &quot;whom&quot; is oblique). However, as I mentioned in a reply to another Boarder on this thread, Latin has opened my eyes etymologically speaking: when I see a big word, I can tell when it came from Latin, and I can sometimes tell what the root word is. Now having taken Greek as well, one can only guess how often I see something that makes me think &quot;this looks/sounds like it came from Latin/Greek&quot;!</p>

            <p>Yep, I am pretty good with all three. Of course, I am nowhere near fluent in Latin and Greek (who actually <i>speaks</i> Latin or Koine Greek?), but put a dictionary by my side for the words I don&#39;t know, and I can understand almost anything I read in those languages.</p>

            <p>I had a very good Latin teacher at school, and went on to read Classics at Oxford (including compulsory Greek, yuck).  <br><br>As for what I learned that&#39;s transferrable to writing English prose... Unlike modern languages, you&#39;re still taught the formal grammar and composition; I was able to use that framework to better understand English grammar and syntax.  It&#39;s very important too to realise that languages change over time, and that rules that are correct in one context or register may be incorrect in another.  I found the diachronic view of a thousand years and more very helpful in gaining that perspective.  Finally, it was absolutely vital to realise that primers and style-guides are, at best, only providing guidelines: all the best authors regularly break the &quot;rules&quot;, and learning how and when to do so successfully makes your writing so much more natural and flowing, and often more expressive.  If you stick religiously to only the simple, straightforward constructions in your primer, you&#39;ll end up writing like a stilted primary-school teacher (or student!) regardless of the context.</p>

            <p>I have been exposed to Latin in various ways, including choir singing, science classes (scientific terms also involve lots of Greek), and linguistics classes, not to mention looking up the etymology of words on my own. I think knowing where your language comes from is immensely helpful for writers. For me, it gives me an appreciation of the nuances of the words, and helps me choose them more carefully. It also helps in guessing the meaning of unfamiliar words when I see them for the first time.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It definitely helped in my Spanish class. Yay cognates! Sadly, I only had a year of Spanish, and I never got to the point where I could hear and speak it easily. Reading and writing I could do, though, and I still remember the grammar well enough to tell when Google Translate isn&#39;t quite getting the idea.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is occasionally forced to rely on Google Translate for her job.</p>

            <p>Same with me - I&#39;ve had to do Spanish most of my life, but only have two consecutive years of French under my belt, and remember very little about either unless I&#39;m writing it or seeing it written.<br><br>Of course, I could always fake it - and watch as my own back end gets curled around my face by the force of the kick from the angry native speakers, but hey.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, online translators can only do so much with Latin. Latin has a case system, so it&#39;s not enough to find the translations for the nouns in your sentences; you have to decline them into the proper cases depending on their place in the sentence. As far as your arc sentence, the words &quot;apparatus&quot; and &quot;deus,&quot; being objects of their verbs, should be in the accusative case:<br><br><i>Quando homo <b>apparatum</b> fecit, homo <b>deum</b> aedificavit.</i><br><br>Also, you might consider &quot;machina&quot; instead of &quot;apparatus&quot; for &quot;machine.&quot; (i.e., <i>Quando homo machinam fecit....</i>) </p>

            <p>Hope that was correct for &quot;the only good language is a dead language&quot; :-) I actually took Latin for five years, but since my last lesson was about six years ago, not all that much has stuck. What did stick is enough to understand and create spells for Harry Potter, though. Makes me cringe when I see stuff like &quot;animagus stoppero&quot; in a fanfic. <i>Adding &quot;io&quot;, &quot;ero&quot; or other such bastardizations does NOT make it Latin!

            <p>Hello everybody! I discovered the PPC the better part of a year ago, but I never actually posted on the Board until now.<br>For the first few months, I just read a few of the series without even knowing this place existed, but after I found out, I was reluctant to get involved for a long time because, well, I got nervous and kept putting it off. But no longer!<br>Oh, crap, I&#39;ve spent half the post space rambling again. I&#39;ve got to cut down on that.)<br>My fandoms include Discworld, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Bionicle, Adventure Time, Doctor Who(I&#39;ve not watched much of the classic series, unfortunately, but I&#39;m working on that), Homestuck, Star Trek, assorted Nintendo games, and plenty more that I&#39;ll more likely get to when I haven&#39;t already gone on for so long about everything else.</p>

            <p>Are Wamblers territorial? Or carnivorous? It&#39;s starting to eye my new tribble-eunuch in a way that&#39;s saying I&#39;ll need to keep them apart.<br><br>If you&#39;re going to watch Adventure Time, I&#39;m not sure where I should tell you to begin. The first season is where all of the characters started off, and it sets a great tone for the crazy awesome land that they live in, but it&#39;s around Season 2 that it really started to develop. One of the show&#39;s strongest points is its characters, and a lot of Season One is testing the waters. When it hits, it&#39;s incredible. When it doesn&#39;t, we get bits like the Ricardio the Heart Guy episode that are just sort of confusing. (Though I&#39;ll be the first to say that his return in Season Four was epic.)<br>The show itself is one of the rare programs that has a great sense of humor but doesn&#39;t turn around and call attention to it; it&#39;s just part of their world, and it shows up everywhere. The background for the land of Ooo and the more enigmatic characters like Marceline is revealed little by little, through episodes that you wouldn&#39;t even realize were linked until after the fact, because info-dumping wouldn&#39;t be much fun at all, would it? (Take notes, practically every other show. They&#39;re right with that idea.) There&#39;s great dialogue, massive amounts of creativity, and constant subversion of the expected that makes the show enormously exciting and interesting to watch, and it&#39;s the first show in a long time that got me genuinely excited to see returning minor characters.<br><br>... Ahem.<br>That turned into fan-gushing really quickly, but there&#39;s just so much that I like about it!<br>Writing this made me want to watch Mortal Folly/Mortal Recoil again. I&#39;ll be back in half an hour.</p>

<li>My best pony would also be Twilight, partially because her social awkwardness and obsession over small problems relates to my own personality, and partially because out of all the ponies, she&#39;s the most interesting to watch in new situations. You mostly know how the others will react; Pinkie will produce bright colorful objects from nowhere, Rarity and Rainbow Dash will try to impress everyone, etc.(not that any of those are bad, mind you), but Twilight could do any of a half dozen things and still be perfectly in character. (Discord, due to being the essence of chaos, does this as well, but it&#39;s treated much differently in a contextual sense, and he&#39;s not really a pony, is he?)<br><br>2. It depends on what mood I&#39;m in. If I want over-the-top space antics, only TOS will do, but TNG is better in terms of overall character and episode quality, even if it does occasionally devote entire episodes to backstory. I&#39;ve only ever seen two episodes of Voyager; one was really good, but the other was really bad. Either way, I don&#39;t have enough information to make a real opinion about it.</li>

            <p>Some episodes are amazing, some episodes are horribly stupid. So you got a pretty accurate impression of the show. However, overall, the characters are interesting, the good episodes are REALLY good, and the fandom fills in the gaps where the series failed. <br><br>I never minded when TNG devoted entire episodes to backstory - it helped you get to know the characters more deeply than TOS. TOS basically only developed Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, while TNG developed all seven of the main cast and some recurring characters too, like Barclay and Ro. One of the strengths of Voyager is that it does the same. That&#39;s why those two are my favorite. Also, <s>Discord</s> Q appears on both. (Actually, it seems like DS9 might become another favorite, but I haven&#39;t seen enough yet.)<br><br>So, in order to prolong this Trek conversation, I have a few more questions:<br><br>1. Kirk or Picard? (and why?)<br><br>2. Who are your favorite characters? <br><br>As I have made clear my preference for TNG, obviously my answer to the first is Picard. Favorite characters are Spock, Data, and Q, as I have also made fairly clear.</p>

            <p>I just have an instinctive dislike of info-dumping, and even though the backstory episodes help define the characters, which is always a good thing, spending a full episode to show a character&#39;s family and past life just makes a part of me wonder whether any of this new information is going to be brought up again. To each his or her own, I suppose.<br><br>1. Definitely Picard. For all of Kirk&#39;s shenanigans, he was never very good at things that didn&#39;t involve drop-kicking aliens or romancing characters-of-the-week. Picard was the much better captain both in terms of having an interesting and multi-talented character and actually being able to manage people. It makes me wonder how Kirk got promoted to Captain when he breaks up fights between aliens by reading the United States Preamble at them.(Okay, mentioning The Omega Glory is a low blow, but it makes for a good example.)<br><br>2. From TOS, McCoy. From TNG, Data. Seconds are Spock and Geordi, respectively.<br>Q gets an honorable mention, but doesn&#39;t get ranked, because I&#39;ve never seen any of his episodes all the way through. I always catch them halfway in, so I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing there. Then again, from context it just seems like he shows up because he gets bored in the Continuum and likes pestering Picard and Sisko. I can appreciate that. Sisko is the sort of guy who would need to be pestered once in a while, and Picard&#39;s reactions to Q randomly showing up are hilarious.</p>

            <p>I mean, sometimes there&#39;s other motivations, but it all basically traces back to him being bored. &quot;I&#39;m bored, I guess I&#39;ll test humanity!&quot; is probably his motivation in the pilot episode, and then Picard intrigues him and he stops by other times. <br><br>Yes, &quot;The Omega Glory&quot; is pretty much the worst episode of TOS. I was reading a recap of it somewhere which I think summed it up nicely (I&#39;m paraphrasing here): &quot;It&#39;s typical for Star Trek aliens to represent cultures in Earth history. This is usually done subtlely. But in &quot;The Omega Glory&quot;, subtlety was set on fire and thrown off a cliff.&quot; I mean seriously, the implausibilities! I always had the idea that Kirk was promoted because he was disobeying orders left and right, so they sent him on a mission where they thought he&#39;d die, but he managed to survive. He kept doing that until he got to captain. Then movies, where he became Admiral. Then - my gods, I&#39;ve just explained all of TOS! The reason the Enterprise keeps getting in trouble is because Starfleet keeps trying to send Kirk into missions that will kill him for disobeying orders. Only problem is, he makes friends, and is intelligent enough in his own way to get out of tough situations! *revelation*<br><br>Ahem. Picard, on the other hand, just has bad luck. Starfleet loves him because he stays enough within the rules to keep them happy, but he&#39;s still sympathetic to viewers because he breaks rules for legitimate reasons. He&#39;s much more well-rounded - if he quit Starfleet he could become an archaeologist, a professor, a musician, a radio announcer (I kid, who needs radio when you have holodecks?). He&#39;s intellectual, and listens to his crew&#39;s opinions.<br><br>Or, to quote my sister, &quot;The only thing Kirk has over Picard is hair.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m probably gushing/babbling, tell me to stop if you want me to. It&#39;s just seeing a Trekkie (or Trekker if you prefer) makes me want to talk Trek.<br><br></p>

            <p>If I didn&#39;t, my responses wouldn&#39;t have been half so long.<br><br>Even Spock&#39;s Brain, the commonly accepted &quot;really bad one&quot; for the original Star Trek, wasn&#39;t as bad as The Omega Glory. Spock&#39;s Brain was actually fun to watch and pick apart, because even after you laughed at the first layer of plot holes, you realized that there was a second layer of nonsensical plot contrivances just beneath its surface. How did the people on Sigma Draconis even reproduce if each gender had no idea that the other existed? <u>Spock&#39;s Brain logic</u>. How did a dozen unmarked buttons on McCoy&#39;s remote control replicate Spock&#39;s entire cranial functions? <u>Spock&#39;s Brain logic</u>. It&#39;s like Sue logic, if Sue logic made you bust up laughing instead of wanting to smack yourself in the head.<br>Omega Glory, on the other hand, was just flat-out stupid. I read that it had originally been considered for the first episode of Star Trek to air on television. That would have been <i>awful</i>! Nobody would have watched the show because they would have been so disappointed, it would have had no fandom, and then no sarcastic fanwriters would coin the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot;, and then the PPC would never exist! The crappy fanfictions would still be out there, but the PPC would just be... doing something else! The very idea repels! (dramatic gasp)<br><br>As for the next bit, I imagine that, by Season Three, Kirk&#39;s bosses had run out of extra-dangerous missions to send him to, and on a routine sweep for certain-death encounters, they saw that he&#39;d gone to the planet from Day of the Dove with no backup to fight both Klingons and the Beta Entity, and he still didn&#39;t die. Exasperated, the Federation Council threw up their collective hands or equivalent and said &quot;Screw it all. When he comes back, we&#39;ll promote him and give him an administrative job that we can legitimately fire him from.&quot;, which he proceeded to vacate so that he could fight off whale-loving space probes and Klingon Doc Brown.<br>I like this idea. Your revelation is a good revelation.<br><br>I&#39;ve had a fanon going for a while that Picard lost his hair as a teenager, similar to what happened to Patrick Stewart, and one of his original motivations for succeeding at so many pursuits was to show up all of the other Starfleet cadets who teased him for being bald. It&#39;s slightly OOC for him, but it makes me smile nonetheless.</p>

            <p>I have a Star Trek calander with pictures from various episodes and fun facts on the bottom. There&#39;s a picture from &quot;Spock&#39;s Brain&quot;, and the fun fact is, and I quote, &quot;The plot of this third and final season premiere is described by some insiders as a backhanded &quot;tribute&quot; to network executives who&#39;d cut the show&#39;s budget and moved it into an undesirable time slot.&quot; That explains the blatant stupidity. <br><br>&quot;The Omega Glory&quot;… Its bad logic is a whole different degree of stupid. Yes, <i>every single planet</i> has developed <i>exactly</i> like Earth. <i>Suuure.</i> *wipes Sar-Plasm off walls* That is a frightening thought - &quot;The Omega Glory&quot; would have killed the Star Trek franchise at birth, meaning that modern fandom wouldn&#39;t have been created the same way, meaning that PPC might not even exist! What a terrifying alternate universe!<br><br>Whale loving space probes…Best Trek movie <i>ever</i>. (Closely followed by First Contact and Wrath of Khan.)<br><br>Your fanon about Picard makes sense, because it is shown that he was a bit of an arrogant womanizer as a Starfleet cadet (Season 6, &quot;Tapestry&quot;) so losing his hair could have caused him to try and regain his pride by being smarter than everyone else. And I forgot diplomat on my list of other jobs Picard could do. And ambassador. Yeah, Picard is epic.<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s probably best to use their site, if it has a way to leave comments, or the author&#39;s e-mail address or wiki Talk page.

            <p>I&#39;ve read the Original Series, as well as easily a dozen of the spin-offs, and they&#39;re awesome. I read a few OFUs, too, but I gave up on that bit since none of the ones I read were ever finished. It&#39;s too bad; I liked them, especially the Redwall one.<br>I went on the PPC wiki already, and I even made a few edits there. Of course, since I forgot to log in, one of the admins said &quot;Who is this anonymous person editing the Minis page?&quot;, and removed some of my changes, which is another of those things that I feel silly about in retrospect.<br>I first found the PPC when browsing TvTropes. When I went to the page, I saw the link to the Original Series and started reading it. It was, to reiterate, awesome.<br>I have to warn you, though, I will not be nearly as adept at Tolkien canon as a lot of the rest of you are. I&#39;ll probably still be able to identify unreported badfics for it though, if I need to. Sue traits are universal, after all.</p>

            <p>Well, spring is once more in the air, for some of us at least, and I figured the timing couldn&#39;t be better, considering what&#39;s just twoish threads down from this.<br><br>That&#39;s right ladies, gentlemen, starfish, and everyone else! It&#39;s time for the annual Shipfest! For the newbies, and those of you who don&#39;t remember how it goes, a summary shamelessly stolen from the wiki:<br><br>&quot;The PPC Boarder Shipfic Fest is one of the stranger activities that the PPC Board gets up to. It is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, but since newcomers will still probably be inclined to tilt their heads and go &quot;WTF?&quot; at the strangeness, a few words of explanation:<br>We at the PPC do not like to take ourselves too seriously. Therefore, to celebrate the coming of spring and the resurgence of fresh hormones in our young blood--or really just anytime someone feels like starting it--we hold an event in which anyone who wants to writes silly shipfic about various PPC Boarders. Those who do not wish to participate are respected and left out of it. Everyone else is subject to the shippy and often slashy whims of their fellows, with amusing results.<br><br>There are a couple of rules, of course:<br><br>The first, which has been stated but bears repeating, is that anyone who does not want to participate is left out of it.<br>Similarly, if someone is not around to give their assent or dissent, they are left out of it just in case.<br>Second, the rating should stay PG-13 or lower. This is meant to be silly and fun, not squicky.<br>Once somebody starts the shipfic thread, it is traditional to state your willingness to participate if you are willing, and then to call out potential pairings (or more-than-pairings), perhaps along with the grounds (if any) for the &#39;ship. If there is one in particular that strikes your fancy, write it! If someone writes a shipfic with you in it, it is then traditional to retaliate and write one about them.<br>Or you can just up and do whatever you want. *wink wink nudge nudge*&quot;<br><br>One last note: Agents are not usually involved in the Shipfic Fest, though this is not a rule. It&#39;s just that there&#39;s a separate event for them. (Which, admittedly, is also due for a return sometime soonish, I think. Unless I already missed this year&#39;s Fanfic Land.)<br><br>With this, I hereby declare the PPC Boarder Shipfest of 2013 open game! Needless to say, I&#39;m <i>always</i> available, and up for basically anything, so ship away.</p>

            <p>AKA The Return of Dominatrix!Kitty<br><br>***<br><br>Kitty adjusted her dress. As a dominatrix, she had to modify her style to whatever person she was trying to seduce. Today, it was a brony. Kitty liked the show herself, so she had the materials for a costume. And who didn&#39;t love princess ponies? And a fan favorite too!<br><br>She sat down in her chair and draped a blanket over her head and wrapping it around her body just as someone knocked on the door. She ignored it, picking up a book and pretending to read.<br><br>The door opened, and she looked up. &quot;Why, he<i>llo</i> there,&quot; she said, a purring sound in her voice.<br><br>&quot;Um, hi,&quot; World-Jumper said. &quot;You must be Kitty.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, suddenly realizing the purring wasn&#39;t quite right. &quot;You&#39;re the brony. World-Jumper.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, looking somewhat confused.<br><br>She rose from her chair and sashayed towards him, swaying her hips just enough to show under the blanket she kept clutched around her. She came to a stop an inch from his face.<br><br>&quot;So,&quot; she whispered, leaning in and running a finger down his ear, &quot;Who is best pony?&quot;<br><br>&quot;T-Twilight,&quot; he replied as her hand traced a line across his shoulder.<br><br>&quot;Oh, Twilight,&quot; she said. &quot;<i>Wonderful</i> pony.&quot; She let go of the blanket.<br><br>World-Jumper stepped back. &quot;Not Twiacorn! I <i>hate</i> Twiacorn!&quot;<br><br>Kitty reclosed the distance between them and raised her eyebrows, smiling seductively. &quot;Then take off my wings.&quot;<br><br>&quot;With pleasure,&quot; he said, and pulled. He tossed the wings on the ground triumphantly, then suddenly realized that he had removed more than the wings.<br><br>She wrapped her hands around his neck and he succumbed.<br><br>***<br><br>So sorry, you two. But what with Dominatrix!Kitty and the fact that you&#39;re both bronies, I had to do <i>something</i>.<br></p>

            <p>*Pomph*<br>(That my freinds is the sound of pegasus wings opening when they are... excited.)<br><br>In all seriousness though, wow, that was funny. And acurate too; I would rip the wings off a cosplayer who was dressed as Alicorn!Twilight if I was brave enough. Thain again, considering what happened with kitty here...<br><br>When I was reading it, when I read she was dressed as a princess, I honestly thought, &quot;It&#39;s Molestia isn&#39;t it?&quot; The reveal that it was Twiacorn made me laugh and sigh in relief. If you don&#39;t know who Molsstia is, well, look at the name and guess. It is part of the dark side of the fandom, and one I hope Marvin and Printworthy come across so they can kill that sorry character replacement. <br><br>Anyway, back on track here, well done. If I had been drinking anything, it would have sprayed all across my little tablet here. Thank goodness I was not.<br><br>(PS, for the record, best pony is either Twilight or Fluttershy, the two calmly fighting for the position. Not that it changes anything, just thought you should know.)</p>

            <p><i>Despite the fact that some participants are named, it is safe to assume that everyone who signed up is here and everyone who didn&#39;t is not, because that is exactly what is happening.</i><br>_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<strong><em><br><br>The Board was buzzing with news of the annual Shipfest. Already close to a dozen posts had been made showcasing various Boarder ships, and the participants were cackling at their pairings or reacting with oddly tsundere-like proclamations of &#39;B-BUT I WOULD NEVER&#39;.<br><br>Everyone knew the truth, of course, but this was all in good fun. At least... it was, until several Boarders decided that they actually liked their pairings and wanted to see if they had any merit and real life.<br><br>This in mind, these Boarders - and by &#39;these <br>Boarders&#39; I mean Riese, Phobos, Neshomeh, Huinesoron, Khaosity, HerrWozzeck, and hermione of vulcan - decided to get everybody together at a physical meeting place rather than just the Board and set things up in such a way that romance would be <i>entirely inevitable.</i><br><br>So they picked a totally unimportant city in an equally unimportant country and invited everybody to the first-ever Meet Your Shipficcers PPC Fest.

            <p>As for why I&#39;m not allowed to be bored? Well... there was the time I enacted the &quot;Epiphany&quot; scene from Sweeney Todd in the middle of town, then the time my friends and I played &quot;subway tag&quot; through the entirety of Nürnberg... There are plenty more examples! I wish I could take credit for the reenactment of the Silmarillion in art class, but that was a friend&#39;s &quot;fault&quot;. It was still awesome though :-)</p>

            <p>It ended when the teacher from next door came in (ours got called off and left us unsupervised, thinking that eleventh graders were old enough to know better) and asked us what the heck was going on, why was Andrea duct-taped to the wall by her wrist and was that smoke she smelled? By that time it had been going on for about 45 minutes... with a LOT of improv, as half the class had no idea what was happening. Also, it was out of order, cause we were already on Beren and Luthien and the... Dagor Bragollach, I believe. Yes, simultaneously. Yeah, Maedhros/Andrea got forgotten about... Oh, and Feanor (yours truly) was still alive, thwapping Morgoth with a pencil case. C&#39;mon, I wanted my Silmarils/notebook back!</p>

            <p>Where the people who would be &quot;losers&quot; at normal schools are suddenly the coolest! We&#39;d already done Harry Potter to death. And PotC. Also, I did say half the class was clueless... Some of them were making paper airplanes, which they gave us willingly, because &quot;never refuse a determined geek&quot;. And so the First Kinslaying failed to occur... We did burn them (the paper airplanes), though, hence the smoke (also, Dagor Bragollach=Battle of Sudden Flame). Honestly, I wish I could do that again! This time I wouldn&#39;t even have to be coerced. Yeah, friend of mine stole my notebook, declared &quot;The Silmarils are mine!&quot;, I was having a bad day and tried to make him give it back, he refused, I shouted &quot;Give it back or I swear I&#39;ll kill you!&quot;, some others swore they&#39;d help, and the rest is history... Needless to say, my day was suddenly a lot better!</p>

            <p>Afternoon sunlight slanted down from the library&#39;s high windows. Only two remained inside at this hour, hunched over an enormous leather bound tome, united in their desire for learning.<br>&quot;So you see,&quot; Khaosity explained, &quot;it would really be &#39;dei ex machinae,&#39; since you wanted to pluralize it.&quot;<br>Sergio Turbo nodded understandingly. He pointed to a word on the ancient Latin dictionary, but Khaosity reached at the same time, and their hands met over the well-worn pages. Two voices gasped; startled brown eyes looked into handsome and hot Italian ones.<br>For a moment, there was perfect silence. Then, Sergio finally found the courage to ask the question that had been burning in his mind for so long:<br>&quot;Cogito ergo sum?&quot;<br>Khaosity blushed furiously, but she matched his boldness. &quot;E pluribus unum,&quot; she said, her voice like a caress.<br>Sergio gasped again. Could it be? &quot;Post hoc, ergo propter hoc!&quot; he declared. Now there could be no mistake- and no going back.<br>&quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet!!&quot; Khaosity cried, and threw her arms around her study partner. Soon there was nothing but a flurry of passion and clothing discarded on the library floor. She conjugated his verbs, and he made sure ALL of her adjectives agreed.<br>__________________________________<br>Ha...

            <p>“Right foot...red!”  <br><br>Karrin bit her lower lip, and slowly shifted so her foot rested on the mandated dot. Unfortunately this put her in an... awkward position.<br><br>“Nnn~”  Plat squirmed slightly.  “Watch it there, you.”<br><br>“Well, it’s hard to watch much of anything with you around,” Karrin retorted with a cute little pout.<br><br>“Mmm.  Not that I’m complaining, of course...”  Plat made the shift to Left Hand Green slowly, taking great care to accidentally brush against her, which placed the pair in an even more awkward position than before. This had the interesting effect of making Karrin flush a very bright shade of pink.<br><br>“Tease.”<br><br>“Bite me, Murph.”  Plat stuck his tongue out at her childishly.<br><br>Karrin leaned forward and left a gentle bite on Plat’s ear, causing him to fall forward out of surprise.  “What the-”<br><br>“You <i>did</i> say to bite you.”  Karrin smiled wickedly up at him.  “Not my fault if you weren’t ready for it.”<br><br>“Well, now that we’re here,” Plat purred, “shall we go for another round?”<br><br>“I suppose so, if you’re so eager to lose again.”  Karrin’s smile grew even more wicked. “How about this time we make things a bit more... interesting?”<br><br>“Interesting how?”  Plat’s cheeks began to heat.<br><br>Karrin didn’t answer, as her hips were already moving by themselves, wriggling out of her pants.<br><br>And so they played a more interesting round. Or three.<br><br>_______________________________________<br><br>Sorry, Plat.  You&#39;re just too much fun <i>not</i> to use in these!</p>

            <p>KittyNoodles was sitting in her favorite chair, reading Pratchett, when her door opened.  Plat stood in the doorframe, backlit by the fiery glory of a California sunset.<br><br>“Hello there, Kitty.”  Plat’s voice was wine-smooth as he leaned sideways against the frame, crossing his arms.<br><br>Kitty raised an eyebrow.  “’lo, Plat.  What brings you here?”<br><br>“I was in the neighborhood, thought I’d stop by.”<br><br>“In the neighborhood, huh?”  Kitty mock-pouted, eyes sparkling with laughter.  “You need an excuse to see lil’ old me?”<br><br>“Hey, hey.”  Plat straightened up and came the rest of the way into the little bungalow.  “Of course not.  But I was trying to be suave.”<br><br>“Suave.  You.”<br><br>“Hey, I’m allowed to be suave.”<br><br>“Suuuure.  Remember what happened last time you tried to be ‘dashing and adventurous?’”<br><br>“Hey, that table was getting old anyway.  Breaking it was a favor.  And you got better.”<br><br>“You’ve never apologized for that, you know.”  Kitty slipped a scrap of paper into her book to mark the place, and stood with a graceful, fluid motion that accentuated her curves.<br><br>“I’m uh…I’m…um…”  Plat suddenly felt like the temperature had jumped at least twenty degrees.  “I’m uh…”<br><br>“You’re what?”  Kitty paced slowly toward him, hips swaying side-to-side, eyes never leaving his face.<br><br>“I’m suh…suh…”<br><br>Kitty reached him and pressed in close, arms wrapping around his waist as she whispered in his ear.  “I can’t hear you, Plat.”<br><br>Plat was starting to sweat ever so slightly.  “I…um.”<br><br>Kitty pressed him back against the wall, tracing a single finger along his collarbone.  “<i>Say</i> it.”<br><br>“I’m.  Um.  I’m sorry.”<br><br>“I can&#39;t heeeear you~...”<br><br>“I’m sorry!”<br><br>Kitty smiled lazily.  “Good boy.  Now, how are you going to repay me for breaking it?”<br><br>“Um…I..I’ve got some money som-“  He cut off with a hiss of indrawn breath as Kitty left a long scratch along his neck with one fingernail.<br><br>“Not like that, Plat.”<br><br>“Uh.  L-like what, then?”<br><br>Kitty’s eyes smouldered.  “Oh, I have a few ideas.”<br><br>“I-ideas?”<br><br>“Ideas, <i>Mistress</i>.”  Kitty corrected.<br><br>Plat swallowed.  “Ideas, M-mistress?”<br><br>Kitty’s smile turned even more lascivious.  “Yes, Plat.  Ideas.”  She crossed over to the door, then turned back to Plat.  “Oh, don’t look do worried.  You’ll like them, I think.”<br><br>“Y-yes, Mistress…”<br><br>The door closed.<br></p>

            <p>&quot;Oh, hey! You&#39;re awesome!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, yes, I know,&quot; BeautyID preened. &quot;What brings this on?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing!&quot; Kaitlyn exclaimed (but did not explain). &quot;You just <i>are</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; BiD acknowledged. &quot;Now, how can I express my gratitude properly?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, I can think of a few ways,&quot; Kaitlyn said - and leant in to kiss the other woman firmly on the lips.<br><br>After a while - a while that was filled with vaguely-watery noises - BiD asked, &quot;Gratitude sufficiently expressed?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Kaitlyn said, her fingers trailing down the other woman&#39;s throat. &quot;And of course, that <i>was</i> enjoyable - so now <i>I</i> have to show my gratitude, too...&quot;<br><br>&quot;We could be at this all day,&quot; BeautyID observed as Kaitlyn&#39;s fingers found her blouse&#39;s top button. She thought for a moment, and then added, &quot;Good.&quot;<br><br>It wasn&#39;t too terribly long before the floor was strewn with clothes of various descriptions, a patchwork quilt of colours. Kaitlyn and BiD, on the other hand, were now seated on the floor, and displayed far fewer shades - a bit of brown, a bit of black, and quite a lot of skin-tones.<br><br>Also a hint of red, as BiD&#39;s tongue traced moist patterns over Kaitlyn&#39;s curves. Kaitlyn made a purring noise in her throat and stroked the other woman&#39;s hair lazily. A thought struck her, through the mists of pleasure. &quot;Gosh - wouldn&#39;t you just <i>die</i> of embarassment if someone walked in just now?&quot;<br><br>BeautyID lifted her head and considered this for a moment. &quot;No,&quot; she decided. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t notice.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn frowned. &quot;Why not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because I&#39;d be too busy doing <i>this</i>.&quot; And the brunette dived for Kaitlyn&#39;s waist.<br><br>Kaitlyn blinked. &quot;Oh.&quot; Then, after a moment: &quot;Oooh.&quot; And then, a little later: &quot;Eep.&quot; Her hands, cut loose from central control, wandered vaguely over BiD&#39;s skin.<br><br>This apparently gave BeautyID ideas, as <i>her</i> hands swept down over Kaitlyn&#39;s stomach to vanish between her legs.<br><br>Kaitlyn let out a squeak.<br><br>There was a long period of considerable noise and movement.<br><br>Afterwards, Kaitlyn lay on her back, panting, her skin glistening with a film of sweat. She turned her head towards BeautyID, lying beside her in similar disarray.<br><br>&quot;Oh, hey,&quot; the black-haired woman said, brushing tangled hair away from her face. &quot;You&#39;re awesome.&quot;</p>

            <p>[This popped into my head when I saw that Tray-Gnome is apparently a squirrel.] Silken Dawn couldn&#39;t take it anymore. She desperately needed to feel some nuts in her hands. Tray-Gnome&#39;s nuts, to be exact. The squirrel in question was merrily scampering about its home forest, when it saw a tall shape approach. &quot;I&#39;m nuts about your nuts,&quot; Silken Dawn whispered. &quot;Please show them to me.&quot; Tray-Gnome took her to a secret hiding place deep in the woods and exhibited its nuts. However, Silken Dawn frowned. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but... I thought there&#39;d be, well, <i>more</i> to them,&quot; she said disappointedly. &quot;Why isn&#39;t there?&quot; &quot;I like to eat my nuts!&quot;, the anthropomorphized squirrel also known as Tray-Gnome exclaimed with a big grin on its face. Silken Dawn fainted. Shaking its head, the squirrel ran off, intent on securing more nuts for its food stash. [Sorry for overusing the word &quot;nuts&quot; and possibly for using &quot;it&quot; as a pronoun for Tray-Gnome, depending on whether I misinterpreted &quot;agender&quot; or not.]</p>

            <p><i>As everyone knows, all Italians are handsome and hot. Therefore, this was inevitable.</i><br><br>One day, Sergio Turbo stood in front of the mirror, admiring himself. He turned one way, and then the other, admiring his hot Italian body from all angles.<br><br>&quot;My goodness, I am so handsome and hot, it&#39;s unbelievable. I can hardly believe it myself!&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;I can believe it,&quot; said a husky voice.<br><br>Sergio spun around and beheld the most handsome man he had ever seen (besides himself, of course). The man was leaning in the doorway, one raised arm against the frame, which perfectly showed off his pecs. He wore a sultry grin on his face and little else.<br><br>&quot;Who are you?&quot; gasped Sergio.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m Phobos,&quot; said he. &quot;I have a hankering for some hot Italian sausage, and I heard you&#39;re the man to see.&quot;<br><br>Sergio folded his arms skeptically, although he was starting to feel a hankering of his own. &quot;Maybe, but I don&#39;t give my sausage to just anyone. What makes you think you can handle it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; said Phobos, sauntering into the room, &quot;my family does come from the old country, and I have been known to make some damn good sausage myself. I&#39;ll show you my recipe if you show me yours.&quot;<br><br>This was agreed by both parties to be equitable, and they spent the rest of the evening sharing their hot Italian sausages until they were both sated.<br><br>(( I blame <a href="http://eragon-sporkings.wikispaces.com/fan_fiction">Kippur&#39;s meat series</a> for the intrusion of the sausage euphemisms into what was supposed to be pure green-on-white smut.

            <p>&quot;All right, everyone,&quot; said Desdendelle from the front of the room.  &quot;We&#39;ve got a show tonight and we still can&#39;t get this song right.  Focus!&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve been at this for hours,&quot; complained Sergio Turbo.  &quot;The violin stings are hurting my fingers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can someone turn my sheet music?&quot; squeaked Tray-Gnome from the middle of the brass coils of his not-squirrel-sized tuba.  &quot;I can&#39;t reach it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is not what I was promised,&quot; said Ivan, at the marimba.  &quot;Where are the tight leather pants?  Where are the screaming fans?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You think tight leather pants just happen?&quot; said Desdendelle.  &quot;Not without lots of rehearsal and a catchy hit song that everyone will forget within a week, they don&#39;t.  Now focus.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can I switch my bagpipes for Riese&#39;s tambourine?&quot; asked doctorlit.<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Des barked.  &quot;You switched earlier, and I told you you were stuck with the pipes.  Can we just get on with this, guys?&quot;<br><br>There was a lot of grumbling and shuffling around.  Desdendelle started pondering the merits of a solo career.<br><br>Suddenly, from the back corner of the room, a woman spoke up.  No one had noticed her until now because she was very quiet.  She said, &quot;So... I was going to recommend that someone get on top of the boy band.  But you know what they say, &#39;If you want something done right...&#39;&quot;  She she smiled and began working at her buttons.  &quot;Who&#39;s first?&quot;<br><br>The guys in the room looked around at each other, unsure of what to do.  This woman looked way too innocent to touch.<br><br>It didn&#39;t take long for Makari to set the record straight on that count and prove that looks can be deceiving.<br><br><br>((You really can&#39;t say things like &quot;get on top of the boy band&quot; around this game.  It might give people ideas. -Phobos))</p>

            <p>There was a cup of tea sitting on the table. Neshomeh and Desdendelle both eyed it, for the tea was the love of both their lives, and each wanted to snatch it up and show it the extent of their feelings. Neshomeh reached for it, just as Desdendelle did the same. Their hands collided on the cup.<br><br>Des tugged on the cup, and Nesh pulled back. Des responded by tugging harder.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s mine!&quot; Des said, trying to yank the cup out of Nesh&#39;s hands.<br><br>&quot;No, it&#39;s mine!&quot; Nesh insisted, keeping a firm grip and pulling harder. Des redoubled his efforts, now working on prying her fingers off.<br><br>&quot;Yes!&quot; he exclaimed triumphantly, holding up the cup to gaze at it in adoration. <br><br>&quot;NOOO! MINE!&quot; Nesh cried, diving over the table and tackling Des and the teacup to the ground. The tea splashed on both of them. They watched the teacup roll off into the distance and mourned the loss of their great love. <br><br>Nesh lay her head on Des&#39;s chest. &quot;Why did we fight? The tea is lost!&quot; She sniffed his tea stained shirt, then lifted her head. They locked eyes, simultaneously coming to the realization that mutual love of tea meant mutual love, and they fell into a passionate embrace. Who needs a teacup when you have a lover who is <i>covered</i> in tea?<br><br>***<br><br>Hope I didn&#39;t offend either of you. It was fun to write, and took much longer than it looks like it did.</p>

            <p>Hey, guys. Well... I may have mentioned this to some people in private messages, but I haven&#39;t mentioned it to all of the PPC yet. So...<br><br>For those not in the know, I started contributing to an MST blog on WordPress last year. I&#39;ve been contributing with a few other people, and... well, one of &#39;em came back from a fairly long break recently. It&#39;s along story.<br><br>Anyway, I say this, &#39;cause that fellow contributor started an MST of My Immortal that you can find here:<br><br><a href="http://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/my-immortal-chapter-one/"><a href="http://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/my-immortal-chapter-one/">http://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/my-immortal-chapter-one/</a></a><br><br>Be sure to check it out, and also be sure to check out the other postings written by my fellow MSTers!</p>

I actually know him in real life, and his will to continue as a writer seems to be fading.  He&#39;s not awful, but he really needs someone who can give him a real critique of his story, and as I know next to nothing about the fandoms, my ability to help him is extremely limited.  I&#39;ve been doing my best, but I&#39;m the only person who&#39;s really been trying to help him aside from the occasional comment and generic praise.<br><br>He&#39;s got some natural talent, but I don&#39;t think he really believes me when I tell him.  He gets really down on himself a lot for not being able to write extensively in a single sitting, and frequently compares himself to far more experienced, and often much older, writers.  <br><br>He responds well to constructive criticism, however, and you guys seem to be the best people to help: Good at what you do, and nice about it, without being unwilling to criticise.<br><br>I would really appreciate you guys starting a mission as soon as any of you could.

            <p>(Kidding.)<br>I do have a question, though. Is <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7366778/1/The-Dark-Companion">this</a> missionable? It&#39;s a crossover between <i>Forgotten Realms</i> and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.<br>On one hand, its SPaG is pretty much OK, and so far (I&#39;ve read the first two chapters) the heroine does not look like a Sue. On the other hand, it copies LotR almost word for word (Rose Potter springs to mind), the main heroine is rather OOC, and the fact that she was inserted into the story does not change it at all save in some minor ways, a la In Spite of a Nail.</p>

It doesn&#39;t work with orcs, most are too stupid to picture themselves as the ones lying pouring out their life&#39;s blood on the grass, but it works with humans. And then we&#39;ll have reduced the enemy forces by a large number with only the effort it takes to kill half that many.&quot; Her teeth flashed white as she broke into a broad grin. &quot;If we&#39;re lucky the orcs will try to stop them and then our enemies will be fighting amongst themselves for a time.&quot;<br>Aragorn raised his eyebrows. &quot;You think we should concentrate our efforts on the Dunlendings?&quot;<br>&quot;Until they break,&quot; Cierre said, &quot;and they will.&quot;<br>&quot;You seem very certain,&quot; Aragorn said, &quot;and yet you had not even heard of them until this moment.&quot;<br>&quot;If they were determined enough to keep on coming, regardless of casualties,&quot; Cierre said, &quot;they would have taken back this country generations ago, or else been exterminated in the attempt.

And a paragraph earlier, a sound explanation of armor worn by the Dunlendings by Gimli made me think that this author at lest had the basics down. Minor issue later on where neither Gimli nor Legolas knew what a crossbow was, as they fought orcs that used them in battle. And the whole &quot;Bag of Holding&quot; thing... really? <br><br>I say, keep an eye on it for now. If any future chapters get iffy, then we might need to consider it.

            <p>There&#39;s options other than killing a fic. Maybe some of them would make sense.<br><br>PPC doesn&#39;t kill fics unless they&#39;re irredeemable, and even then they might rescue bit characters. This is because every fic has the potential to strengthen a continuum and every Author has the potential to become a goodfic author.<br><br>Option one: Send the author to an OFU. Is there one for MLP? If so, you could invite the author to submit a fanbrat. In the Real World, you simply teach him what you know about writing, and he gets better at it; problem solved.<br><br>Option two: Send in Intel. If there&#39;s not too much of a problem, they watch and wait until they know for sure. Allows for an in-character review without killing the fic.<br><br>Option three: Fixing <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Glitches">glitches</a>. When a fic isn&#39;t bad enough to be killed, but there is an error in it that could cause problems, a team of agents may be sent in to fix it. This works for fics which, other than a small number of mistakes, are good stories that will strengthen the continuum.<br><br>Option four: A non-lethal mission due to a clerical error that sent a moderately good fic to the Action Departments. Agents could go in expecting to kill a Sue, but realize the Sue has potential or the grammar is fixable. Maybe the more homicidal partner gets annoyed s/he doesn&#39;t get to kill anything, or maybe they both get annoyed with the Flowers or with their Console. In either case, they might get to explore the fic without touching it, or perhaps fix small mistakes as with the &quot;Glitches&quot; option.</p>

            <p>I know, I&#39;m a newbie and probably not as qualified as most to say this, but the fic doesn&#39;t seem as bad as the ones we typically do missions on. There are a few punctuation and organization problems, but not much that&#39;s really notably charge-worthy aside from Kirby suddenly learning to speak understandably(and I&#39;ve never played Return to Dream Land; he might be able to talk there regardless).<br><br>Like Phobos said, a badfic that Agents are sent into would contain bad characterization, a strange or ridiculous plot that it thinks makes perfect sense, often terrible spelling, etcetera, and is deemed &quot;bad&quot; by a group of people that serve as impartial analyzers.<br><br>Antithesis of Harmony is more &quot;first draft&quot; than &quot;badfic&quot;. Almost everyone is acceptably in character, and the ones that aren&#39;t either are only slightly deviated from their regular persona or their OOC moment has precedent in one of the two canons. The spelling is fine, aside from a few typos, and the grammar is only distorted due to the aforementioned organization problems.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what he &quot;desperately needs help&quot; with. If it&#39;s problems with working up the motivation to write, I don&#39;t know what a sporking could do for him, aside from making him reluctant to write again, and that&#39;s not what we&#39;d want at all.</p>

            <p>It seems to me that what you want is not a mission.  If the writing is not that bad, and your friend really just needs a self-esteem boost, then a mission is far from an ideal way to achieve your goals.<br><br>A mission takes a piece of bad writing and puts it through the wringer.  It makes jokes at the expense of the bad spelling, punctuation, and grammar.  It satirizes the bad characterizations.  It usually involves totally dismantling the story to return the canon to normal.  It focuses, almost exclusively, on what was done wrong.  And that really is not what you need here.<br><br>I just want to make sure you know what you are asking.  These terms have very specific meanings around here.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Not so much a self-esteem boost as an actual criticism of what he did right and wrong.  The lack of motivation he has stems from knowing he&#39;s doing something wrong, but not what (his words, not mine).  I don&#39;t know enough about the source material to really help him.  If, however, you guys only critique particularly bad fanfiction, then I apologize for misunderstanding.  I thought it was a blanket &#39;everything that isn&#39;t quite *good*&#39;.  I figured someone here might be able to tell him what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not, and where good could be better and where bad could be removed or improved.  I&#39;ve tried, but I don&#39;t like My Little Pony and I actively dislike Kirby (no offense to Kirby fans, I just prefer darker games), and all I could really say was &#39;spelling seems okay&#39;.  He keeps telling me that the fic isn&#39;t good, but he doesn&#39;t know how to make it so.  It&#39;s the lack of knowing *how* to improve that seems to be bugging him, rather than needing a hug.  He&#39;s been trying to rewrite the damn thing since August, only recently posting a half-chapter in January, then promptly going back into the funk.<br><br>If it honestly isn&#39;t bad, however, I might achieve the same effect by telling him you guys said that there wasn&#39;t anything wrong with it, and he just needs to stop being a perfectionist.</p>

            <p>Everyone is capable of concrit! Constructive criticism is a thing that anyone in the PPC <i>should</i> be able to do - but a mission is, as Phobos pointed out, rather more harsh. Missions also tend to happen if and when someone wants to write them, since they are a commitment of time and effort, and... yes, they do tend to be written about really bad fanfic, rather than &quot;Alright but needs work&quot; fanfic.<br><br>Constructive criticism is something that <i>all</i> writers need, even if whatever they&#39;re writing isn&#39;t that bad - so if you&#39;re asking for that, it&#39;s probably doable. I don&#39;t know the canons, but I can certainly critique writing, and most PPCers are fair hands at that.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re jumping to conclusions here.<br><br>1. Phobos&#39; problem with your request was that you don&#39;t seem to understand the term Mission. What your friend needs is actual criticism. As you pointed out. Not a mission. If someone satirized a work you weren&#39;t sure about in the first place, would that actually make you rewrite it?<br><br>2. I&#39;m not a fan of either franchise, so I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s good or bad. Also, a few things have already been pointed out by Outhra.

            <p>You could have your current agents sent an overflow Intel mission, or help out friends in the Intel department. Lots of potential for hilarity when agents who don&#39;t know the work set out into a fic! Maybe the Intel agents are indisposed for some reason (more potential for funny) and your agents have to step in.</p>

            <p>*LE SHAMELESS SELF PLUG* <br><br>I think this might be a relevant excerpt from one of my spinoffs:<br><br>&quot;Members of the Department of Floaters now worked alongside the spies due to the DoI’s extremely low recruitment rates. Only twenty-three new spies had joined Intel in the past year (among them a little unicorn pony, of all things), so it had been necessary to pull some Floaters off of their regular duties to work part-time in the Sorting Room. Since Floaters was one of the largest and fastest growing departments in the PPC, it was reasoned that it could afford to allocate some of its agents to surveillance duties.&quot;<br><br>It wouldn&#39;t be too far of a stretch for some Floaters to be assigned a temporary positon in the Cubicle Maze and be sent out to do Intel runs...<br><br><br><br><br>...what?

            <p>Wow, prompt response. I didn&#39;t expect to be answered so quickly, though in retrospect, I&#39;m not entirely sure why.<br><br>So, if the color resulted from a misspelling of Borg, does that mean the mini-Tribble Buge is buge in color? I&#39;ve noticed that minis tend to take on characteristics of what the mistake harkens to; I remember how your mini Mess Efekt was able to cloak, and a Stargate mini named General Laundry possessed a basket of laundry that he could command mentally. If the mini is buge, I feel bad for the little guy. Nobody is going to want to adopt a Sue-colored mini.<br><br>The color has been catalogued already, it seems. Good job to Hermione of Vulcan for doing that, and I look forward to reading the new OFUS chapter. In fact, I wasn&#39;t even aware that there was a Star Trek Fanfiction University currently in progress. Huzzah! Another to read! Now, off to find it.<br><br>Hey, maybe Buge has found a good home at OFUS! A Sue-colored mini would probably be extra-effective at enforcing rules through pain. After all, if it hurts to look at it, it will probably hurt even more if it tackles you to the ground for trying to glomp a canon character!</p>

            <p>Oh, the mini would definitely be buge-coloured, and it probably has implants, too. Also, seeing as my agents stopped off at OFAS (note, not OFUS - OFAS stands for the Official Fanfiction Academy of Starfleet) on their way back from that mission, most of the minis they found would have taken up residence there.<br><br>As such, I would imagine Buge the mini is now a mini-Gorn with Borg implants and buge-coloured scales, guarding the staff of OFAS from fangirl stampedes etc.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve noted the change now, though. I guess that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t find OFUS when I searched last night. It was OFAS all along! Such a simple defense, but so effective.<br><br>I didn&#39;t know that the minis transform into new guarding-optimized forms when they enter an Fanfiction University. Would this be related to why the Pokémon Universities have mini-Deoxys and mini-Missingno when the minis found in missions are mini-Rayquaza? A polymorphic mini-Pokémon <i>would</i> be better at tracking and punishing out-of-bounds fanbrats, and it looks like the Gorn transformation serves a similar purpose, just in terms of increasing brute strength rather than efficiency of defense.<br><br>On a slightly sillier note, have the minis based on misspellings of Borg ever tried to network into a mini-Collective?</p>

            <p>The Star Trek continuum is somewhat unique with regards to minis. Basically, there was once a DS9 OFU that never got more than a few chapters, but it mentioned mini-Tribbles. However, that OFU hasn&#39;t been updated in years, and I&#39;m sure that if anybody were to actually visit the space-station that once housed that OFU, they would find it rusting, dusty and probably inhabited by something unpleasant (or just completely overrun with mini-Tribbles). Needless to say, it&#39;s been abandoned for years.<br><br>Then Hermione of Vulcan (and Apricot) came along and started OFAS (unaware of this other one to start with, I believe), and staffed it with mini-Gorn. Then she found out about the first one and came up with an explanation for having two types of minis for a continuum (said explanation being &#39;Q&#39;, so that works).<br><br>As for minis of misspellings of Borg, it would make a lot of sense if they did have their own mini-Collective (fanbrats&#39; nightmare; *cackles evilly*). I&#39;m not sure how all the mini misspellings of the Borg Queen would handle it, though - they&#39;d probably share in one sense or another. That or all the minis could just hook up to the main Collective.<br><br>On a slight side-note, the assimilated mini-Stus in Phi&#39;s care do have their own network, as do the mini-Colossi, Joke and Mess Efekt (because in Mass Effect, the Geth are a networked race).</p>

            <p>I imagine that the first Star Trek OFU(which, as I have found out, is called OFUST: DS9. What a mouthful. Seriously, try saying it all at once.) was devastated by its Designated OFU Emergency, and the mini-Tribbles have multiplied until they have the run of the place. Either that, or it survived perfectly well and just doesn&#39;t want to make contact with the OFAS for administrative purposes. That second option isn&#39;t as interesting, though.<br><br>So, the new mini type is Q&#39;s doing, just like the abandoned planet with HQ-styled halls is Q&#39;s doing and the numerous canons plucked from all across time-space and given indefinite leave from their duties is Q&#39;s doing? That&#39;s the great thing about Q. He is to Star Trek what the Unicron Singularity is to Transformers, or the events of Thief of Time are to the Discworld, except instead of being limited to only space and time(at which point the term &quot;limited&quot; has already come into question), the unexplainable things could come from anywhere. Dealing with inconsistency or general confusion in Star Trek can be easily explained by saying &quot;This is the home continuum of a capricious omnipotent being with free rein over the cosmos. The question isn&#39;t whether it can be done, the question is why something like it hadn&#39;t been done before.&quot;<br><br>If the Borg&#39;s name-mistakes had all been linked into one central Collective, the mini-Queens would probably just serve as coordinators of some sort. As much as I like the idea of a Borg Queen power struggle acted out by mini-Gorn, it&#39;s not really a Borg thing to do to squabble within their ranks when there is a task to be done. In this case, it would be defense of the Academy and the sanctity of the Collective rather than assimilation of the other minis(probably), but it would be taken up with no less fervor.<br><br>Speaking of the mini-Colossi, is there a Board-run adoption center for their continuum, like there is for the mini-Balrogs? One of my agents-in-progress has a soft spot for mechanical minis, and while I don&#39;t know much about Mass Effect other than the basics of the races and setting, and thus couldn&#39;t spork a story myself, he&#39;d probably enjoy having a little geth running around the RC. Between your and Herr Wozzeck&#39;s missions alone, there should be at least twenty of the little guys without supervisors.<br>I almost said &quot;owners&quot;, and then I remembered what typical mini behavior is like.</p>

            <p>I think the general method of adoption for mini-Colossi is to browse their page on the Wiki (<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini/Mass_Effect"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini/Mass_Effect">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini/Mass_Effect</a></a>) and post to the Board saying which one(s) you would like to adopt.

            <p>Hello all you PPCers...hi...<br>I&#39;m Pauline07 (at least, that&#39;s the name I tend to use on the net) but Pauline or &quot;Bones&quot; (something that started a while ago on another site) is perfectly fine. <br>I found PPC a while ago while searching for information on &quot;Agony in Pink&quot; (rest assured I did NOT read it, I couldn&#39;t even get through My Immortal, so...I&#39;m just curious, honest). I thought about joining, but I&#39;m somewhat naturally shy and socially awkward, so I decided to think about it for a while. <br>Well, here we are about a year later and I finally re-found the wiki after the thing driving me crazy for a while when I decided I wanted more information and couldn&#39;t remember for the life of me what the board was called...rest assured I&#39;m heading to bookmark this thing as soon as I finish this.<br>I&#39;m a reformed badfic writer....yes, I know, I regret it big time,look at any piece of fanfiction on FF.net that I ever wrote and feel free to spork it or laugh and point as you wish,pen name&#39;s the same. I leave it up because my last computer blew up, pretty much, and I want to remind myself to NEVER go there again...because I wrote bad, BAD Mary Sues. And I am never going there for the rest of my life. LEARNED MY LESSON! <br>Which is why I wanted to join the PPC, because I definitely find badfic to just annoy me. After a while sometimes I&#39;ll just find myself looking at an unreadable story and going....&quot;God...universe...someone...&quot; <br>Other than that...I have a dog and a cat, who I&#39;ll often refer to when talking, Bingo and Friskey. I&#39;m fourteen, a freshman in high school and I speak English and passable intermediate French. I play piano, guitar, sing, dance, act- pretty much anything artistic and performing wise, I&#39;m into (Although I&#39;m not in band or orchestra- they aren&#39;t really for me). I live in Iowa, which is hot as fire in the summer and cold as Antarctica in the winter; however, it annoys me when everyone says that the state is just corn- it&#39;s a large part of the state but really...<br>And I&#39;ve been overusing ellipses, dang it.<br>Personality wise, I&#39;m somewhat over-literal (hence the &quot;Bones&quot;) and socially awkward. I&#39;m rather scatterbrained, though, but when something&#39;s important enough to me, I tend to stay on top of it. I&#39;m VERY peppy and enthusiastic and a bit hyper. <br>So, I guess that&#39;s it. Hello world. </p>

            <p>Howdy! Welcome, welcome!<br><br>It looks like we semi share a couple fandoms. I used to be a big fan of Bones, but was really upset a couple years ago when they did the flash-back to before the first episode. I feel that really messed things up. But that&#39;s just my opinion XD I am however a big fan of Psych! <br><br>Oh, and I have to ask... since you live in Iowa... Do you have cows? Can you see your neighbors? Are there any big cities there? How many rooms did your school-house have?<br><br><br><br>(Sorry... as a native Nebraskan I just couldn&#39;t resist! I got those kind of questions when I was traveling on the east coast several years ago, heck I still get those kind of questions from friends that live as close as Chicago! I know... I&#39;m such a dork! XD)<br><br>Anyway, welcome gifts! I have for you a packet of my limited edition Atlantian sponge capsules! Just add water and you get a full-sized sponge city, in the architectural design style(s) of your whim! And because I have subjected you to my nutiness concerning your geography straight out of the chute, *digs in bag o&#39; goodies* I know it&#39;s in here somewhere, ah there it is! I&#39;ve got a second gift for you! It&#39;s a genuine Carnotaurus skin!

I&#39;ll just put it in this watertight container, because I don&#39;t think my neighbor would be too happy if a city suddenly grew in the middle of our houses....but I&#39;ll have to use it sometime!<br>Thank you!

            <p>&quot;You&#39;re from Iowa? I had no idea there were pianos in Iowa!&quot;<br>*dies laughing*<br><br>I thought the flashback kind of destroyed the wonderful love/hate relationship they had just spent the last 100 episodes building by completely changing the motivations/connotations behind everything we had seen about their interactions up to that point. But that&#39;s just me. XD<br><br>I love Psych, but one couldn&#39;t really say I was extraordinarily familiar with it, but it&#39;s a great show. Now you have me curious about your fic though!</p>

            <p>....lovely ignorant people....<br>That&#39;s true, but I&#39;m a big fan of B squared, so I may be a bit biased about that episode. They&#39;re like Ron and Hermione (except I actually am not the biggest fan of those two....I like Harry/Hermione, actually....but never mind) <br>Psych is hilarious. Shawn is so smart and he just....knows it. And here comes Gus, just trying to survive! <br>Oh God....it&#39;s one, very short chapter...not even sure where the heck it was going, but it sucks. You can already tell April&#39;s a Sue just by reading it. It&#39;s useless for nothing but the trash...April is actually painful to look at...</p>

            <p>I just loved the dynamic they had already built, and then to go back and redefine everything, I could never see those episodes again in the same way. I don&#39;t know, I just feel that was something they should have explained in the pilot, or maybe even as far as the end/beginning of the first/second seasons. But to go back after five seasons and basically rewrite their relationship. Meh. My opinion of it seems to be somewhat in the minority among the fans that I know, so maybe it&#39;s just my own little hang up. XD<br><br>Shawn and Gus are awesome, sometimes though I do want to see someone take Shawn down a peg or two. XD Just for his own good of course. XD Yeah... I see where you&#39;re coming from with April... though I must admit I am curious what power she is using to come up with what she knows and the whole &quot;ping&quot; thing. ^^</p>

            <p>Hello again. <br>Thank you all for the virtual gifts....so very kind of you. I feel pretty welcome already! It&#39;s nice to be included. <br>Anyway, so a few people have pointed out that I forgot a list of my favorite fandoms...thanks for that, I completely forgot. <br>I do most of my writing concerning the BtVS series, since most of what I consider my best fanfiction happens to lie on Twisting the Hellmouth (though sometimes I wonder if that stuff doesn&#39;t suck too....it&#39;s at least gotten reviews that make more sense, so I consider that a plus). On from that, I tend to stay with Charmed, Harry Potter, and Power Rangers territory; since those are the fandoms I know best. I&#39;ll also work with Bones, Missing, and very rarely Psych and Ghost Whisperer. Musicals tend to spark challenges more than actual story ideas, and that pretty much goes for any musical that starts to become melodramatic. <br>So, as a better list: <br>Favorite Fandoms: <br>BtVS<br>Charmed<br>Harry Potter<br>Power Rangers<br>Fandoms I Know Well, but aren&#39;t favorites: <br>Bones<br>Missing <br>Psych <br>Ghost Whisperer<br>SNL skits(Didn&#39;t put this up there because I just started working with it)<br>Melodramatic musicals (i.e: Jekyll and Hyde, Les Mes, Sunset Boulevard, ect.) </p>

            <p>Glad to see you built up the courage to come and say hello. Trust me, we do not juge people by their writings, so don&#39;t feel bad about your Past Sins. (Please get the reference, please get the reference, please...) Besides, what kind of person would I be if I judged based off what people wrote? They are words created from an idea, an idea that may or may not be good, but an idea nonetheless. Besides, I am a terrible speller. Atrocious at times. Without spellcheck to save me, I have embarrased myself many times here. It&#39;s all good though, and I even got permision recently. I guess what I am trying to say is, &#39; don&#39;t worry about it.&#39;<br><br>Now, gifts. Actualy, if you could give me a list of fandoms you are part of, that would be fantastic.

            <p>Darn it, did not get the reference. :( Well, it makes sense, seeing My Little Pony: Frendship is Magic is not on your fandom list. Past Sins is one of the most controversial fanfics of the brony fandom: it is either one of the best fanfictions ever written, or it is a terrible Mary Sue fic that needs to die in a fire and forgoten about forever. I see it as a Mary Sue fic, but not bad enough to be sporked, but that is beside the point. <br><br>Yeah, bad spelling on essays... I have done that way too much. Oh well.<br><br>Now, at long last, your gift! I give onto thee, one wand from Harry Potter. Seems what Umbrige said about muggles with wands was not total BS. Better still, the wand is exactly what you would hope for in a wand, whatever that is.</p>

            <p>Now it sounds a bit familiar.....I must have heard of it somewhere, but I&#39;ve never read it. Not that I&#39;ve read My Little Pony fanfiction.

            <p>The show you are thinking of is different from the show I am speaking of. My Little Pony is a show from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s that was not very good. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a show being created right now that started in 2010 and has recently finished its third season. It is a realy good show, though I won&#39;t give you the speach I usiualy do. All you need to know is that it has a MASSIVE fanbase known as &#39;Bronies.&#39; They are absolutely mad with all the things they create, including fanfiction. If you want to know more, I would sugest you watch an episode. Lesson Zero shows how far the writers and animators are just about willing to go (and that&#39;s pretty far) Sonic Rainboom is a cool episode, and Dragonshy is one of their awesome adventure episodes. They should be on YouTube, so just ask Uncle Google for the episodes and you should be all set.<br><br>Confession time: I once misspelled my teacher&#39;s name on a paper. In two different ways. She was my english teacher. Yeah... Though Spell Check is a godsend, and without it… I would probably be a much better speller because I would have to learn how. But that is irrelivant.<br><br>Ah, good to hear that I managed to replace a lost item! Just be more careful around airports this time, alright?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the Bleep&#39;n&#39;ms! Those will be getting a lot of use.....a...lot....of...use.....sorry, seen too many Purple Ranger Mary Sues. And the plushie has just turned into Henry Mitchell from Charmed, by the way. He is currently sitting down with my imaginary stuffed phoenix (really long story as to why I associate those two in my head). <br>Oh Gods, I look at my stories and I don&#39;t remember writing some of them. I don&#39;t want to....some of them really just need the reader to have some Bleeprin. I am ashamed I even considered writing them in the first place. <br>Yeah, definitely staying away from most of the really bad stuff....although there are some things I wish I&#39;d never read in my life....<br>Anyway, thanks so much for the welcome!</p>

            <p>Who is he again? It&#39;s been years since I watched Charmed...<br>The only fandom we have in common is Harry Potter, but it&#39;s a very large one, so that&#39;s okay. For a break from the bad stuff, you could maybe look up &quot;Cauterize&quot; by Lady Altair on the Pit. (My dumb phone isn&#39;t letting me add a link.) Absolutely no Bleeproducts needed, but a box of tissues is highly advisable.<br>You&#39;re welcome for the welcome! :-)</p>

            <p>Hey. I came across this fine group called the PPC thanks to TVTropes. I read the Original Series (loved it) and a few missions on the side. Once I managed to get rid of the stitches, I decided, what the heck, I&#39;d love to be a part of this.<br><br>Should I tell more about myself here? Or am I good?</p>

            <p>...Skyward Sword is <i>the</i> finest Zelda title up to date, surpassing even Ocarina in my list. The story, the level design, and the love and care that has been poured into the game make it stand tall amongst its sister titles. <br><br>Definitely try the Prime trilogy and Super Metroid (via the Virtual Console) if you can get your hands on them. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfGsArRQjKE">Also, the Prime theme is just too awesome to pass up on.</a></p>

            <p>Well that&#39;s great to hear! *looks even more sadly at stuffs in storage* I&#39;ll cross my fingers that the controls are more of an issue of getting used to than truly atrocious.

            <p>From your fandoms list, I see we share the fandom of Star Trek. As that is my primary fandom, I feel obligated to ask certain questions.<br><br>1. Which series are you familiar with?<br><br>2. Which are your favorites?<br><br>My answers are that I have seen a fair chunk of TOS (it&#39;s hard to judge, since I watched it sporadically and out of order), all of TNG, all of Voyager, and I just started DS9. Of these, TNG is my favorite, followed closely by Voyager. <br><br>Since you seem to be collecting weapons, have a generic Star Trek phaser - it changes shape depending on the series you&#39;re in and whether you want a regular phaser or a badass phaser rifle. </p>

It will allow you to commandeer any vehicle you come across, from a Ford Mondeo, to a Corvette ZR1, to an F-35 jet, to the Starship Enterprise.

            <p>Glad to have you here! As a welcome gift, you get some Bleep&#39;n&#39;ms (Bleeprin and m&#39;n&#39;ms, helps when reading badfic) and an Unspecified Plushie, which turns into your favorite character! Have you read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Constitution</a> yet? Also, it would be nice if you could tell us what your fandoms are :-)</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t bring up your agents yet. You&#39;ll need to have a presence on the Board first, and then ask for Permission. Your agent profiles should be part of the Permission request. It gives you more time to work on them that way, and besides, it helps if what you want presented is all in one place. Check the Permission page on the Wikia site for further questions; the admins have made a very comprehensive FAQ.<br><br>Before I forget, welcome! If only you&#39;d come an hour and a half earlier; then we&#39;d have had two shiny newbies within a twenty-four hour period. It wouldn&#39;t have been a rare and spectacular occurrence for the ages, but I think it would&#39;ve been interesting.<br><br>However, that shouldn&#39;t stop you from celebrating, so I am happy to present the Festivity Gauntlet! Bright lights, dance-worthy music and/or confetti can all emerge from this device with simple command gestures! Great for getting a party started or for surprising and flash-blinding pursuing enemies! And of course, one could always turn into the other. A truly lively evening can be unpredictable.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been working on a Greek style Tragedy for the past few months, and I&#39;ve finally finished the first act. It comes in at about 15k words, written double-space. This the first major story I&#39;ve finished since &quot;Jenny&#39;s Adventure&quot; when I was eight. <br><br>While Riese has been a fine muse, we both agree we need someone a little more sharp fanged and nit-pick happy when it comes to Betaing. It&#39;s original fic, but anyone with knowledge of ancient greece, and greek mythos would be greatly appreciated. <br><br>But, as it is original fic, my largest plea for help is in the SPaG department.

            <p>(Sorry, Bryn, but I&#39;m stealing some of your thread... mwahaha etc)<br><br>I&#39;ve just completed a Canon Protection Initiative-related Discworld story after about eight months work (and eight years since I first started it...), and I am in need of a beta or three. It needs someone to go over canon details, SPG, and general writing style and entertainment value.<br><br>The whole thing is about 16 chapters long, and is actually all written; however, I don&#39;t intend to dump the whole thing at once on either betas or readers (the only person I&#39;d do that to is Kaitlyn!). <br><br>So essentially, what I need is someone/s willing to be a constant beta, who checks one chapter, and after I make any changes and post it, is ready for the next one. I&#39;m imagining (in my funny little head) getting a chapter out every couple of days - time will tell if that&#39;s even feasible.<br><br>Any takers?

            <p>Greek-style tragedy? Excellent. It has been a while since I read a good modern tragedy emulating the great Greek plays before them. The email is tds3ak AT yahoo.com. <br><br>Fun fact, the romans tried to replicate the Greek tragedies only BIGGER and <i>better</i>. To say they missed the mark is an understatement. They got their stories so complex and convoluted, one of the gods had to descend from the heavens to fix it up. The god would be lowered onto the stage in a machine, and &#39;god in the machine&#39; translated into latin is <i>Dues ex Machina</i>. Just found that interesting.</p>

            <p>Hello there! Another Zelda fan, I see! In that case, take a Gust Jar! It&#39;s great for putting out the fires after your comrades get flamethrower-crazy from a badfic overdose! Failing that, you could always use it to shoot an octorok at them. Getting hit with a large cephalopod would make just about anyone rethink their recent actions!</p>

Last time, it was a Doctor Who fic (which later led to a Specs and Co. MST of the same author), and almost everybody knew how to respond to the topic.

            <p>If you all are accepting, I think Daughter of Time would be a good fic to MST.

Really bad. Unfortunately, the spelling seems to be good, so no making fun of that. The grammar and storyline is all bad though, so thats good.<br><br>If not that, then why not do a classic: Half Life: Full Life Consequences. That is a fic ripe for the MST theater, no matter how many times it is made fun of.<br><br>Finally, my last suggestion is a little unusual. Mel Brooks once said, paraphrased: &quot;It&#39;s easy to make fun of a bad fic, it&#39;s difficult to make fun of a good one.&quot; Therefore, for the challenge, I suggest we do a goodfic. Perhaps Better Living through Science and Ponies, or The Man With No Name from Doctor Who/Firefly. I can understand why you may not want to do that, but that is just a suggestion.</p>

            <p>As in, on the board, by email, carrier pigeons, or something even weirder? Cause I&#39;d definitely like to participate, depending on whether my phone lets me or not. Not everybody knows the Canon, so we probably won&#39;t use it, but I recently read a Silmarillion fic that <i>really</i> needs to be sporked. It was Maedhros/Sauron slash (what is this, I don&#39;t even...) with descriptions like &quot;their trees were rubbing against each other&quot; or &quot;he felt Taniquetil pushing against his opening&quot;. Taniquetil is a freakin&#39; MOUNTAIN! Bad mental image right there... *shudders* If you want to use it anyway, I&#39;ll go find that fic again. I still know which site it&#39;s on, but I&#39;m not about to go digging for it unless something good comes out of it...</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll try anyway! Email should hereby be added. The bit with the mountain...well, that was one of many weird euphemisms for the penis. For example, &quot;tree&quot; is used quite often, as is &quot;elfiness&quot;, and I believe there was a reference to &quot;Sauron&#39;s dark tower&quot; (no, not Barad-Dur, the -um- other one :-S) in there somewhere.

            <p>I do a lot of my Board stuff from my Kindle Touch, where the Internet is flaky and the keyboard needs to be used like a phone. Yes, you do make more typos on something like that, but all you have to do is read back through and check anything you don&#39;t know. So I don&#39;t really accept &quot;I&#39;m on my phone!&quot; as an excuse for bad spelling.<br><br>Then again, I&#39;m one of those rare people who is a naturally good speller, so I&#39;m more able to not rely on spellcheck.</p>

            <p>It sort of undermines any advice they&#39;re trying to give. And of course I will accept a review with bad SPaG. However, I prefer when the person takes the time to tell me what they liked about it, even if they aren&#39;t giving concrit. It serves a similar function to concrit, because it helps me to do better if I know what I&#39;m doing right.</p>

            <p>Ask a published author about that sentiment sometime - if you&#39;re getting flaming reviews from nasty, mean spirited jerks who just have a problem with you, I don&#39;t recommend taking it to heart. Likewise, blind praise is less than helpful. Everything in between? Honestly, take it with a grain of salt. Listen, yes, and evaluate their criticism. But you don&#39;t have to let reviews like that bother you.</p>

            <p>I’ve been toying with this idea for some time and I just wanted to give it a spin to see where it will take us. I believe that Sergio Turbo and Huinesoron suggested doing agent mailboxes a while ago during the closing ceremonies of the 2012 badfic game so full credit goes to them for thinking this up. <br><br>The concept is pretty simple: we just send questions to an agent’s inbox and watch <s>their author</s> them answer. Queries can range from what they think about their partner to their tastes or funny anecdotes to where they like to eat lunch. Naturally, having agents take questions from the PPC Board makes this AU material. <br><br>I was thinking the format could be something like this:<br><br><b>This post</b><br><br>*Agent X&#39;s mailbox (nm)<br>&gt;Question<br>&gt;&gt;Agent&#39;s answer<br>&gt;Question<br>&gt;&gt;Agent&#39;s answer<br><br>*Agent Y&#39;s mailbox (nm)<br>&gt;Question<br>&gt;&gt;Agent&#39;s answer<br>&gt;Question<br>&gt;&gt;Agent&#39;s answer<br>etc...<br><br><br>Any takers? I don&#39;t want to start this right now just in case this needs to be tweaked or moved to the Other Board or something...<br></p>

            <p>Does all characters we make in the PPC has to be Agents? I intend to make Darklordaakmal more of a supplier of stuffs, with a small army of manufacturing orcs, that his only purpose in the PPC continuum is to provide textile or other supplies to interested PPC agents. He lives in World-One-As-The-Seventh-Age universe. He also will interact a lot with agents, or to his own orcs, or other characters. In short, my own fictional world, but bound to PPC.<br><br>Has this been done before? Is it seen favourably? Can he be sporked, if he is seen as too Stu-ly? And do I need a Permission to craft this character?</p>

            <p>First of all, yes, you would need Permission for this. That goes for anything intended to be added to the PPC shared universe, whether it&#39;s an agent or not. The main point of the Permission process is to make sure that anyone who wants to write about the PPC is a good writer and that their characters aren&#39;t Sueish enough to deserve sporking.<br><br>Second, no, not every PPC character is an agent. Since you&#39;re checking into the wiki, I recommend looking up the &quot;PPC Staff&quot; and &quot;Civilians in HQ&quot; categories for examples. And, like Kitty said, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time a more-or-less-freelance operative set up shop in HQ—see particularly &quot;Leto Haven&quot; and &quot;General Store.&quot;<br><br>Personally, I&#39;ve always wondered where PPC agents get new clothes when their old ones are glitter-stained and tattered beyond repair, so I would be interested to hear more about your idea. I&#39;m sure some of them steal stuff while on missions, but they can&#39;t all do that all the time, or someone would surely notice. Plus, some people (*cough*Nume*cough*) have very particular standards for themselves, and probably can&#39;t find what they&#39;re looking for in a badfic.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

There are loads of infrastructure departments that deal with the more &#39;mundane&#39; aspects of the organization; to quote the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Infrastructure_Departments">Wiki</a>, &#39;The Infrastructure Departments are those that keep the PPC running.&#39;<br><br>Departments from this category include - but aren&#39;t limited to - the Department of Dead Author Electricity Generation (which powers the PPC by using the electricity created when dead authors roll in their graves due to badfic) and the Department of Finance (which deals with financial stuff like income, overhead, etc.)<br><br>Also, I&#39;ve encountered a few stories - missions and intermissions - where there were agents or side characters running their own little shops within HQ, so there&#39;s that, too.<br><br>I wish I could&#39;ve been more helpful, but that&#39;s about the extent of my knowledge here...</p>

            <p>1/ If you are writing stories in the PPC shared universe, you need permission. So yes, this would (and the Self-Check is a very useful tool for that).<br><br>2/ The original shop in PPC HQ was Leto&#39;s General Store. I don&#39;t know about the weaponsmith or the pharmacist, but I believe you. ;) There is also an armour<i>y</i>, in the sense of supplier of weapons - someone who supplies <i>armour</i> I&#39;ve not heard of, so you could be onto something. Supplying the stuff agents wear around HQ could also be handy (I&#39;m picturing a shop entirely filled with second-hand jeans...)<br><br>3/ One reason most PPC characters are Action agents is that, well, they&#39;re more fun to write. Writing a story about John Callahan, Fitter of Jeans - and making it exciting to read and write - would be a pretty difficult task. Most Infrastructure agents (which is the technical term for what you&#39;re proposing) who have stories written about them tend to end up drafted into Action work.<br><br>(3.5/ That said, I have a burning desire to write a dramatic tale of accountancy in the face of adversity for the Department of Finance. Ah, someday...)<br><br>4/ Are you aware that your English use is somewhat, er, off? In this thread you&#39;ve said things like &#39;I may need to look in deeper&#39;, or &#39;Does all characters we make in the PPC has to be Agents&#39; - those would more typically be rendered &#39;I may need to investigate further&#39; and &#39;Do all characters[...] have to be agents&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>4/ Which is why I&#39;m joining the PPC in the first place. So that people will correct me if I&#39;m wrong, or alienly speaking, like what you just did. I want to write a novel, which by now is just jottings here and there, and having a community that corrects me freely is quite an asset. I still need to pay attention on what I write though, sometimes old mistakes just keep on resurfacing.<br><br>3/ I wanted to write a character that is in the sidelines, hearing awesome tales around him everyday, but having his own set of problems and adventures himself. Which may be pretty boring for those in the thick of action, but still quite entertaining to the reader.<br><br>2/ I did had a role-play on the other day. I accepted an order of fireproof gloves, gambesons, sarongs, and other articles of clothing. It was made of spidersilk from the Spawn of Shelob. My orcs were mostly knitters, to support their own measly income from the lack of opportunity to raid the modern world. The adventures could be looking for new spiders, orcs&#39; emergencies, maintaining the lair where the clothes were knit, etc.etc.<br><br>1/ After having filled the Permission Self-Check, who am I supposed to deliver it to? I didn&#39;t see any email the other day I looked at it.</p>

            <p>(The title is messy, phrasing-wise, but I&#39;ve still not gotten the hang of the character limitations in the titles of the Board&#39;s posts.)<br><br>I don&#39;t know if this comment would be counter-productive for helping you deal with the parts of your speech that genuinely are or could be interpreted as mistakes, but I think that having an, as you said, &quot;alienly&quot; speech pattern could be a good distinguishing characteristic for Aakmal.<br>It speaks to his history as someone who&#39;s a little foreign to his surroundings, which I think is an interesting angle. A lot of PPC recruits spend approximately fifteen minutes taking in &quot;Wow, I guess this place really <i>is</i> nothing like home.&quot; and then settle into patterns of speech and behavior similar to the rest of the organization. It&#39;s not a bad thing, necessarily, when you consider the way that one&#39;s own speech patterns might adapt when immersed in accents, phraseologies, and terms that were formerly never experienced, but I&#39;ve noticed it in most of the missions I&#39;ve read, and it might be interesting to see a new take on it.<br>Someone who was raised in a distinctly different setting from the technologically saturated and dimension-hopping world of HQ, speaking a different language, and behaving and thinking in a way separate from others that he interacts with can be a springboard for an interesting character, and nothing drives home that difference more in a written medium than the way that his dialogue is constructed.<br>Just a thought. Feel free to discard or accept as much of it as you want. In fact, I think I went on about it for a little longer than I should have as it was.<br><br>This next part isn&#39;t related to the previous idea, but I was wanting to ask about it. How high and low would the sizes go with the clothing? How many body types would the clothing-maker orcs service?<br>I ask because general human(oid)-fit shops probably wouldn&#39;t work for Agents with unusual physiologies, and those Agents would probably need repairs or replacements after a couple of missions traversing the multitude of worlds and having their clothes ripped up fighting Sues. Add that to the fact that some of the more heavily-built species would more likely have more protection of the biological sort and inadvertently might not take as good care of their clothing and armor as they could, and you&#39;d have steady business supplying them.</p>

            <p>But since it is based on orders, there may be some wriggle rooms. I heard about an agent who is a dragon, and Elven body may be bigger than humans, and we may have to fit dragons or minis too. This will be an interesting story to ponder, as Darklordaakmal tries to fulfill his customers&#39; orders. which is why I entertain this idea for some time.<br><br>For now, we only cater to human body types, and sizes go from S to XXXL. The culture shock when we enter PPC, and having to cater to weird body types, is part of what I want to tell about when writing this story later.</p>

            <p>Yes, my partner has expressed an interest in adopting the little pegasus. She hasn&#39;t stopped pestering me since the pillowfight incident.<br><br>Quite frankly, I think our Response Center is crowded enough with the two of us, Firebrand, and the evil little mini-Discord.

            <p>He makes the days sound so <i>boring</i>! He also has no idea what the word ‘healthy’ means. With all those cooked breakfasts he eats I’m surprised he’s not spherical! I mean, they are yummy, but I don’t think I have to worry about becoming spherical because I’m more sensible than he is and only have a little breakfast. <br><br>Um, my days are mostly like Skeet’s, because he’s my partner, but I haven’t really been here long enough to think of them as ‘routine’. The missions are fun (we get to go into the stories of books and films, it’s so cool!), but I do more interesting stuff than Skeet when we’re not on a mission.<br><br>I’m still kind of new here, so I spend whenever I can exploring HQ. I’ve already found a whole bunch of stuff, including the library (which is <i>amazing</i>), and I’ve heard there’s supposed to be a swimming pool somewhere around here, but I haven’t found that yet. <br><br>I’m not sure that I’d really notice if a normal day got interrupted by anything, because I haven’t worked out what a ‘normal’ day is here. <br><br>I don’t have <i>that</i> many annoying habits (Skeet’s just being a great big mean meanie-head), but I don’t make a good first impression with other people, and that annoys me. I just go all quiet and try to hide when I meet new people, and I don’t <i>really want</i> to, but it’s just scary meeting new people, you know? It annoys me that I’m not better at it :(<br><br>Anyway, Skeet has loads more annoying habits than I do:<br>•  He’s supposed to be training me, but mostly he just shows me stuff I <i>shouldn’t</i> be doing<br>•   I don’t think he’s ever followed a single rule in his entire life<br>•    And now he’s started reading this over my shoulder as I write it, which is <i>really</i> annoying<br>•  He’s wrong all the time but he won’t admit it<br>•    I’m surprised he’s even heard of the words ‘work ethic’, although maybe it’s like ‘healthy’ and he doesn’t actually know the correct meaning of it<br>•   Gah! Now he’s trying to take the keyboard away from me klf<br>Hewon’tstopmefrompostingthis!!1!<br></p>

            <p>My daily routine? Well, on a good day I’ll be woken up by my alarm, otherwise it’s the [Beep] of the console, and that’s never a pleasant thing to wake up to. Either way, the first thing I do is sort out some breakfast, and I mean a proper breakfast, none of this ‘cereal’ nonsense: eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, tomatoes, mushrooms, toast and a great big mug of tea (milk and one sugar – and no, I’m not saying who my supplier of sugar is). <br><br>By the time I’ve finished all that off I’m ready to start the day, and usually have a mission waiting, one way or the other. So then it’s on to the usual check the Intel report, check your gear, etc. (although I have now had to add another phase to that which is ‘wait for Amy to be ready too’).<br><br>I’m in the DMS, so I’ve normally got a pretty good idea what the mission’s gonna be like, it’s not like I’m in Floaters: those guys can get given anything. Sues can still throw a few surprises at you though, so the missions themselves tend to be varied, and I just have to play it by ear. Once the Sue’s dead and gone, it’s back to HQ (you’ll find me at the Bleepka Bar if it was a bad one).<br><br>After that, if there’s time, I’ll catch up my reading, do some weightlifting, or e-mail my granddad the next move in our ongoing chess game (the score currently stands at 62-0 in his favour). <br><br>How do I feel about that routine being interrupted? Well, that standard routine has developed based on the fact that my usual plan (lounge around the RC all day reading and playing computer games) always gets interrupted by a mission. If that didn’t happen, I’d probably be more confused than anything else, but I guess I’d eventually just start appreciating the break. <br><br>My annoying habits? I guess it depends on who you ask, but I don’t think there’s anything much. I’ll admit I’m not that great at turning my paperwork in on time, and Amy seems to have some issues with my work ethic or something, but that’s OK, I’m sure I remember reading something about banter between partners being good for the the partnership.<br><br><i>Amelia’s</i> annoying habits on the other hand are something I can talk about at length. She plays that annoying, stupid, sped-up ‘nightcore’ in our RC instead or listening to decent music, she’s obsessed with rules and regulations – even the really ridiculous ones that are never gonna be sensible for an agent to follow in the field, I have to do all the talking to people because she’s too shy to do it herself, and I have to dose her with anti-Lustin before every mission because she fangirls over <i>everyone</i>. Still, I guess she’s OK for a newbie, and she did save my life that one time, so I should probably stop complaining. <br><br>- Skeet (DMS)<br></p>

            <p>Since you have no way of reaching me otherwise, I think I can disclose some of this.<br><br>2.4.0. I used to have an entry for data fraud. Good thing that can be fixed. Other than that one time, the only ones who ever caught me were agents of the PPC, so no. My record in my home &#39;verse should be clear now.<br><br>2.5.0. You <i>did</i> pick these questions because of me. This sounds way too specific for my rather unique situation. But yes, this ties into the question above. I was caught by the PPC when I (accidentally, I may remind you, damn my sloppy handwriting) hacked into a server of DoSAT. And no, I have no idea how this works.<br>These two guys, Jake and Callahan, found me. The choice was either to wipe my mind and blow up the computer I used to do my work, or joining the PPC. Since I didn&#39;t have the money, or the time, to have a new gateway computer set up, and I didn&#39;t have any real ties to the world anyways, I joined.<br>As for my profession, I work in tech support. It&#39;s the thing that fits me most, as I&#39;m really too squeamish to go out and hunt reality warping glitter demons.<br><br>2.5.0.1. I worked for an organization called Uplink. Since you&#39;re not allowed to interfere anywhere anyways, I can tell you that they were an organization that provided anonymous contact between hackers and their clients. Even though it didn&#39;t earn me that much money, I never went after individuals and never ruined anyone&#39;s life unless they <i>really</i> deserved it.<br><br>I hope this satisfies your curiosity. If you decide to disclose this to others, however, I have your IP.</p>

            <p>I ended up going with red all the way.

You know, something the Reapers did to the rest of the galaxy for so many years. Yeah, I&#39;m not going to do that to anyone else, thank you very much.<br><br>I mean, yeah, the red ending <i>does</i> kill every synthetic in the galaxy, but you know what? That Catalyst is a dumbass. Organics and synthetics <i>can</i> co-exist peacefully, especially in a galaxy which made peace with synthetics to unite against a common enemy.

            <p>Florestan: Oh, great, someone actually cares about the mini enough to <i>ask</i> about it.<br><br>Eusabius: And why not?

However, if we were to pinpoint a close resemblance... it is possible to think of it as looking similar to the alien character Stitch from <i>Lilo and Stitch</i>.<br><br>Florestan: Well, if Stitch and a rabid dog rolled in the hay and had a baby, anyhow.<br><br>Eusabius: And now I believe Outhra has acquired some mild trauma from that mental image.<br><br>Florestan: Oh, he&#39;ll live. *looks at third question* He actually spawned because my first partner in the PPC misspelled &quot;Schumann&quot; in a message she sent to the Flowers once.<br><br>Eusabius: You mean to say she did not know who Robert Schumann was?<br><br>Florestan: Her, and half of America, apparently. Damn kids with their Lady Gaga.<br><br>Eusabius: As I recall, Florestan, you were listening to Nicki Minaj yourself a few hours ago. I may also mention it was not the first time you did so.<br><br>Florestan: I like how bad it is, okay!? God! Prejudice!<br><br>Eusabius: *glances calmly* I believe that now is not a pertinent time to call the kettle black, as the saying goes. *looks at the fourth question* I believe so.<br><br>Florestan: He keeps eating my bacon whenever I bring it in. Always raids my damn fridge like that, you know? *rolls eyes* But that&#39;s not the only thing. Sometimes, he&#39;ll have chewed on my bedsheets just to mess with me. And usually, I have to <i>sleep</i> in those damn things because I don&#39;t have time to get new ones! And oh yeah, let&#39;s not even get into how he once broke my Xbox in two while my partner and I were on a mission. I seriously didn&#39;t think you could break an Xbox that badly...<br><br>Eusabius: I do hope this answers your sixth question.<br><br>Florestan: And as for others like him? Thankfully, no, but I know the potential exists. Here&#39;s hoping we don&#39;t get a mini of Arnold Schoenberg in the near future...<br><br>Eusabius: We hope you have a pleasant day.</p>

            <p>Sadly, answering it the way I think you&#39;re hoping for would put me in breach of confidentiality, so you&#39;re out of luck there. Sorry!<br><br>Anyway, the truth is that Dr. Freedenberg or folks with more seniority than me, like Nathonea, get all the really unusual cases—definitely all the ones outsiders have heard of, including Agent Bulldog&#39;s. That was actually a bit before my time, I think, or if I was there I was still so shiny-new (and yeah, a little glittery) that they wouldn&#39;t have trusted me with anything beyond paperwork and intern work—delivering food, changing bedsheets, kicking the Four-S, that sort of thing. If I met him, I don&#39;t recall.<br><br>I can talk about some things generally. It&#39;s actually fairly unusual for us to see a canon character, since all the field agents carry neuralyzers these days, and when we <i>do</i> get them it&#39;s almost always a double-whammy of injuries requiring a trip to Medical plus severe emotional trauma. Post-Traumatic Bad Slash Syndrome makes up about eight of ten canon admissions, I&#39;d say. There&#39;s also the odd character who can&#39;t be neuralyzed the normal way, but that doesn&#39;t even make up a whole percentage point.<br><br>If you want to know the bulk of what we do, it&#39;s taking care of new recruits. We keep saying we&#39;re going to make a PSA about this, because it&#39;s actually a bit of a problem. The field agents get so keen to earn a vacation that they don&#39;t think about what they&#39;re doing, so we get these poor lost bit characters who really would have been better off assimilating with their home canon. A lot of times, we&#39;d <i>like</i> to just send them back as soon as we get them, but Upstairs does insist on grist for the mill, so we&#39;re not allowed, and it sucks. The blank slates, the ones that got little to no characterization from their authors, are as helpless as newborn kittens here, they usually have no support structure beyond us, and we can&#39;t take care of them forever. Eventually we have to cut them loose, and while some of them make it and get more or less stable, lots of them don&#39;t. So, if any agents are reading this, think twice before recruiting. If you don&#39;t want to kill them, that&#39;s awesome, but that doesn&#39;t mean you should abandon them on our doorstep.<br><br>... That has nothing to do with your questions at all. I&#39;ll get off the soapbox now. Sorry.<br><br>Hey, the metafictional grapevine tells me we&#39;re due for a Romulan who thinks she&#39;s a Tribble at some point down the ol&#39; timeline. That sounds pretty odd!<br><br>~Jenni R.<br><br>P.S. The <i>real</i> truth is that my author hasn&#39;t written any weird cases for me. She doesn&#39;t like to put me forward, what with my history. Also, when other people write about FicPsych, &quot;Freedenberg&quot; tends to be the name they use. You have no idea how frustrating it is for the rest of us to be referred to as &quot;the nurse&quot; all the time. We hardly know who&#39;s done what ourselves, because nobody bothers to tell us!</p>

            <p>I am really not sure what to make of it, but thank you for your interest!<br><br>1. Yes, everyone does seem to be asking about my morphs. It is a fascinating subject, and something I have spent a great deal of time thinking about myself.<br><br>As for what Trekverse morph I might like to try, it is hard to choose—there are so many different species! I suspect I would get stuck being a Bolian or Andorian on a mission simply because of the &quot;blueness&quot; aspect, and especially considering the Andorian antennae. I would not mind that. Andorians even have some cultural similarities to Andalites, placing a high degree of importance on honor, family, etc.<br><br>Perhaps the best answer is another question: what would you recommend for a less-than-adequate morpher who does not wish to endanger anyone with a potentially harmful species?<br><br>2. Somehow, I am not surprised that journal has been found. Nothing stays secret forever in HQ, it seems. Ah well. Just bear firmly in mind that I <i>will</i> track you down if certain private, personal observations about certain people are wantonly blabbed about. I was not exaggerating my seriousness on that point.<br><br>To be honest, most of what I watched during that time has gone out of my head by now. I took it in under duress, and it was too much to fully absorb so quickly. (Please do not tell my partner.) However, I did like what I saw of Captain Janeway, and speaking from more recent experience, I enjoy <i>Deep Space Nine</i> very much. The longer story and character arcs appeal to me more than the &quot;mission of the week&quot; approach in the other series, though of course it does have some episodes like that and the other series do have some character growth.<br><br>I also enjoyed the &quot;reboot&quot; film, which has been the source of many lively discussions in my response center. By that I mean arguments. But I do not mind too much.<br><br>3. I do not wish you to think badly of my partner, but nonetheless, Agent Supernumerary is a trying individual by all accounts, even to those of us who are his friends. It seems I have been gifted with a great deal of patience, which I have expanded by practicing daily Andalite rituals. Additionally, I have spent most of my existence as his partner, so you might say that I learned how best to live with him as part of my training as a PPC agent. The key is to remember that actions speak louder than words, and not to take everything he says to heart. Much of it is hyperbolic or diversionary to some degree—he is not someone who likes to reveal his true feelings. I do not know why. I do know that he has always looked after me in his own way, and I will always do the same for him.<br><br>4. I will take this question as a compliment, but do please remember that I am a sentient, adult being. I do have fur, and it may look inviting, but it would be impolite to pet me, especially without warning. (I make exceptions for small children, who do not know any better. You would not believe the substances I have had stuck to me.)<br><br>Thank you again for your letter. This is quite fun!</p>

            <p>I admit, it is tempting to explain to you in excruciating detail exactly why you&#39;re an idiot for thinking that, but that&#39;s such an obvious trap I just have to do this:<br><br><a href="http://instanttrap.com/"><img src="http://cdn.instanttrap.com/trap.jpg" height="200"></a><br><br>Now, the next time you&#39;re tempted to bait me by appealing to my ego, you can just go push that shiny red button a few times to get a rough idea of how I&#39;m going to respond. If you can keep that in mind, maybe with the aid of some super-glue and power tools, we <i>might</i> be able to have a conversation about <i>Star Trek</i>.<br><br>1. The original, obviously. It might not have shiny modern special effects, and yeah, Shatner is a giant cornball, but you kids just don&#39;t get what it was like at the time it was airing. Compared to pretty much everything else out there, it was the greatest thing we&#39;d ever seen, and that sticks with you. People say the same thing about the original <i>Doctor Who</i>, and maybe even <i>Lost in Space</i> for all I know, but what <i>Star Trek</i> has on them is that it gives us a vision of humanity not completely at the mercy of inscrutable alien forces and/or our own petty bullshit. The Federation is humanity come up so far from almost nuking our own damn planet that <i>we</i> can go out and mess with <i>them</i>—or join forces and become equal partners for a brighter tomorrow, either way. The point is, it&#39;s not out to terrify us with the spooky unknown, possibly with the rider that our only hope and salvation is some kook with a blue box. Our hope and salvation has always been our own goddamn ingenuity and our ability to occasionally shut up about appearances and lifestyles and cooperate like f***ing adults, and that&#39;s what <i>Star Trek</i> is all about.<br><br>2. Tough choice—they&#39;re all pretty terrible at their job. Giving credit where it&#39;s due, Picard is the least terrible. Kirk is Kirk, but I never liked him much. Don&#39;t see the appeal.<br><br>3. Two words: character defilement. Just thinking about it pisses me off.<br><br>4. What are you, a student? Well, it&#39;s about time there was a decent <i>Trek</i> OFU, anyway. Sure, why not? I&#39;ve answered weirder summonses. But I don&#39;t want you or anyone else glomping me, got it? Can I demand a guard of minis? You know what, I do demand it. Make sure you tell whoever&#39;s in charge over there.<br><br>— Agent Supernumerary<br><br>(( You&#39;re not an idiot. Nume is an ass, and his opinions do not necessarily reflect those of the Management. He also totally deserves to be glomped, and you have my blessing as his author. ^_~ <br><br>~Neshomeh ))</p>

            <p>I kid, I kid. Please don&#39;t turn on the sarcasm. For the record, <i>I</i> am in charge - I&#39;m the author/course coordinator. You can call me Miss Gloria if you like. Certainly the minis can be arranged, though I can&#39;t guarantee a Spock mini - there aren&#39;t all that many. His name is too easy to spell.<br><br>I wholeheartedly agree, about Star Trek showing humanity overcoming its problems. TOS doesn&#39;t resonate with me as much as TNG, but that&#39;s because I didn&#39;t see it when it was cutting edge. You&#39;re lucky.<br><br>Being a TNG fan, I prefer Picard. As you so aptly put it, Shatner&#39;s a cornball. It&#39;s...quite fun to do...impressions of his...long, dramatic...pauses. Picard, on the other hand, is commanding, morally upright, intellectual, and has an awesome accent. Granted, that last isn&#39;t particularly important, other than the fact that it adds to his commanding presence.<br><br>The new movie...well, it introduced me to Star Trek, so I give it points for that. Also, any movie that has two Spocks can&#39;t be all that bad. But I&#39;m not a fan of Spock/Uhura, and  the whole movie felt very modern. Not in a good way, more in a &quot;let&#39;s try to appeal to twenty-first century teenagers!&quot; way. So I can understand, growing up with the original, why you&#39;d hate it.<br><br>~Miss Gloria<br><br>((Yes, I am persistent when I want someone to like me. That glomping comment - was that just Nume being an ass, or are you picking up on the fact that I&#39;m ever so slightly fangirly about him? Because I am. Just a bit. *coughs loudly* Anyhow. I feel like this conversation is getting really long, but I&#39;m enjoying it so much I don&#39;t want to stop. Nume&#39;s responses always make my day.))</p>

            <p>Lady, the sarcasm doesn&#39;t ever get turned <i>off</i>. I&#39;d do it just to disappoint, but it can&#39;t be done. If you don&#39;t want sarcasm, don&#39;t talk to me.

            <p>It seems I have already answered the second question in my reply to Agent Kayleigh.

            <p>You say that your human form doesn&#39;t feel strange now, out of interest what was the hardest part about getting used to it?

            <p>I can call you Bob, right? Nice ta meet ya, Bob.<br><br>The answers to your first two questions are the same: mine is more awesome. The end.<br><br>As for number three, you gotta remember our dragons took care of themselves just fine before we stopped killing each other and joined forces, so it&#39;s not like they&#39;re high-maintenance or anything. Being stuck in a building changes things, though, especially since I&#39;m told it&#39;s frowned upon to let Snerri hunt new recruits through the halls. *evil grin*<br><br>Anyway, I gotta make sure he gets enough to eat and drink, and make him exercise so he doesn&#39;t get bored and fat. I WOULD do this by bringing him on missions with me all the time, but my partner is a real stickler for rules, so I have to play on his dead-dragon guilt to get anywhere with him, and I can only do that so much before he gets that one special look that means he&#39;s about to flip his shit and murder us all. So, yeah.<br><br>Snerri pretty much grooms himself, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t make his sharp pointy bits <i>extra</i> sharp and pointy, and also shiny. You can&#39;t go wrong with shiny. Also, any dragon likes a warm place to sleep and a good scratch under the jaw. He gets along really well with Arasgorn the mini-Balrog, as you might imagine.

I tend to use logic to get my way through them--reminding myself that we have gadgets that let us know when a fic is going to be deleted helps, as does knowing that DawnFire likes me too much to let me go. For the second, there are hopefully enough betas to keep me from being warped into a Sue. Hopefully. *shudders* I&#39;d like to think about something else, now, if you don&#39;t mind.<br><br>(Sure.

            <p>Would you consider joining the Borg Collective? You already know how to use your implants. You are already used to working together, so the Borg simply provide a larger community. Besides, it must be lonely being some of the only Borg in a vast transdimensional organization. Your continuum-spanning knowledge would contribute to the Borg&#39;s perfection, perhaps allowing us to assimilate the entire PPC. Being Borg would only enhance the PPC&#39;s effectiveness. Drones, when dispatched into badfic, will detect Sues immediately and terminate them before the canon is severely damaged. The Flowers the agents so despise will not run the PPC anymore, for if Flowers cannot be assimilated, they will be eradicated. Other continua will be made more powerful by their addition to the Collective, and true perfection, perhaps surpassing that of the Omega Molecule, will be created, encompassing the entire multiverse.<br><br>All this requires is your assimilation. Do you want to stand in the way of perfection?</p>

            <p>You misunderstand. You see, I let her escape from OFAS and told her about the PPC and that there were Borg agents.

            <p>Well, the three of us decided that I (Sigma) should have the exonet until it spawned, so after it took, we rushed off to my RC to keep an eye on proceedings. My resident Borg implants did detect the addition... at least, Phi said the skin around that area got noticably more veiny for a while. We reckon there might have been some assimilation going on, but everything seems to be working. (Ironic Overpower, I&#39;ve got my eye on you.)<br><br>Cyba says the exonet fibres look slightly darker now, and given the size change so far, Phi predicts that it might be fully grown sooner than 3-4 months - probably due the effect of the Borg implants. It does mean Phi and Cyba might get an exonet quicker, though, which they are getting decidedly excited about.<br><br>Meanwhile, the teaching construct has started appearing and tutoring me in using the exonet properly. With the connection to the rest of my implants, it is also giving me some insight into using those, too. The best part about it is that I&#39;m getting ahead of Phi and Cyba in that regard, which is driving them crazy. Hee, hee, hee...</p>

            <p>Hello, Herr; thanks for the question.<br><br>I encountered the PPC a few days after my layoff at the police department in my home city of Desay. I wasn&#39;t in the best of places then, since that had been my backup dream job (and I&#39;ve got my suspicions as to why I was suddenly laid off, but that&#39;s a story for another time). I actually ran into the agent who eventually recruited me in one of the bars near the station; he&#39;d been in my home continuum for a short vacation. We struck up a conversation about our work, and when he learned that I&#39;d recently been laid off, he told me more about the PPC.<br><br>I thought he was crazy at first, to be honest-- who talks about going around killing fictional characters, after all? Then he told me some stories about some of the missions he&#39;d been on. Next thing I knew, I was standing in front of the Marquis and signing paperwork. I guess it didn&#39;t really hit me until we got out of the Marquis&#39; office and into HQ proper, when I saw several agents that definitely couldn&#39;t be the product of my admittedly intoxicated brain.<br><br>It&#39;s been a while since I was recruited- just about four years, give or take, if my math&#39;s right -though it seems longer. Anyways, I hope that answers your question. If you have more, feel free to ask.<br><br>--Lee</p>

            <p>That&#39;s quite of a challenging question, actually. I tend to choose my weapons according to mission needs, and in spite of what Corolla says I see them only as tools. Dangerous and powerful ones, though.<br><br>I can still name some weapons from my wishlist, though.<br><br>The first one, which actually I just got from the Armoury, is the Beretta ARX-160A2 from World One. A great, modern assault rifle.<br><br>Then, still a World One-based gun, comes the FG42 from Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Hard hitting, decent rate of fire, and good range too.<br><br>For long range work, though, I&#39;m still hoping to get my hands on a Gauss Rifle from Crysis. Not only it has more power than my current Barret M82A1, but it also has the advantage of being much lighter.<br><br>However, all of those are weapons that any Agent with enough money can get his hands on. There are a couple of weapons that Upstairs would never let me have, too.<br><br>The first one is the AS-24 Devastator from Serious Sam 3. A rapid-fire, drum-fed shotgun loaded with long range explosive shells. Perfect fro blowing up the annoying overpowered Sue you always get once in a while... if you don&#39;t care about the massive collateral damage, though.<br><br>Another one is the ARM x850 from a FarCry mod called Matto4. I have no idea about what that gun is supposed to be, but it&#39;s very powerful yet small enough to be practical.</p>

            <p>For Corolla: I&#39;ve noticed that you enjoy eating large amounts of Sue-flesh at any opportunity. Where do you, for lack of a better term, put it all? You&#39;re six inches tall, and probably only a percentage of that would be usable for food storage. Do you just convert the Sue-flesh into magic energy as you eat it?<br><br>If you spent enough time in a magic-rich continuum to repair your Linker Core, could you grow back to a Unison Device&#39;s usual size? If you could, would you want to?<br><br>For Nikki: What were the other continua involved in the crossover that you were born in, (or the genres of those continua if you don&#39;t remember individual names)?<br><br>What happened in your home fic that made you lose your magic, yet still keep your magical potential for other continua? As far as I know, your case is unique, especially considering how you can now change magic systems while within a canon dimension, and it would be interesting to know what caused it.</p>

            <p>Corolla&#39;s:<br><br>1) Large amounts? What did they tell you about me?! I obviously can&#39;t eat a whole Sue, and in fact I eat very little compared to an human, my meals&#39;s size being roughly on par with those of an human child.<br><br>There&#39;s also the fact that Sergio doesn&#39;t let me eat Sue Soufflés as often as I want, too...<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;m not exactly sure about how my digestive system works, but I do think that we convert food into mana - otherwise I would be full just after a tea spoon worth&#39;s of food. Belkan magic users too regain mana through food... and yes, they do eat a lot!<br><br>2) My Linker Core&#39;s almost fine now, but that&#39;s not really how it works - my size impacts on the amount of mana I consume just by staying alive (That&#39;s what you get for being a magical construct!). I can access to my regular size and one on par with an human child even ight now, but it would impact on my mana usage - my Linker Core&#39;s mana regeneration speed is still kinda low.<br><br>Nikki&#39;s<br><br>1) Well, let me think... Halo: Combat Evolved, Pokemon, Kingdom Hearts, Bionicle, Stargate, Harry Potter and a lot of other that I don&#39;t quite remember. It was really confusing.<br><br>2) Basically, the author of my original fic made me unable to use the Sakura Cards (I was supposed to be Sakura Kinomoto from Card Captor Sakura), and transformed the Star Key into a Kingdom Hearts-style Keyblade. However, as it was someone else&#39;s Keyblade and I didn&#39;t have the time to learn how to use it, it didn&#39;t follow me in the PPC. My magic potential remained, but in a... blank state? I&#39;m not really sure, and the guys at Medical and DoSAT don&#39;t either.<br><br>It gets annoying, as my magic keeps changing even when in a continuum with a single type of magic. Especially since I keep transforming in a Mermaid Melody mermaid every time I try to do magic while I&#39;m swimming or I&#39;m drenched in rain.<br>Anne thinks that if I keep a Device with me all the time and stay close to Corolla I can make it stay as Nanohaverse magic, if not even stabilyze it, though.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll answer the last one first, because it&#39;s the easiest... Improbabilities deals with strange occurrences in fics - extremely weird examples of normal fic types. So a Gollum Mary-Sue would probably be an Improbability, for instance.<br><br>WhatThe deals with things about the very <i>nature</i> of a fic which make you go WTF (although our department has always been named WhatThe, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about &lt;_ to take three typical examples a sue who makes god fall for her story where all the dialogue is translated into gaelic or monty python sue. whereas improbabilities deals with fits my expectations sort of but there something weird here whatthe covers way outside usual boundaries usually it either canon you don expect see that just incredibly out like thing.&gt;<br>As to your other questions... at the moment it&#39;s pretty much me; no Head, no partner. The Rhododendron - I think he used to be the SO&#39;s secretary or something - is sort of my superior, but that&#39;s technically an interim measure: the Department of WhatThe (me) is loaning me out to other departments, with the Rhododendron overseeing the loans. At other times, agents from other departments get loaned to me, with again, R. overseeing.<br><br>Does that answer your questions?<br><br>|&lt;br&gt;|<br>|\/|</p>

There&#39;s a Fountain of Bleepka outside the cafeteria, and one of the bathrooms routinely floods - this one time it managed to flood an Escher Room, which was great fun to clear up - but definitely no pools.

            <p>You have at least managed to convince me that I&#39;m not going to get any info out of you. <br><br>The wall of silence surrounding this mysterious pool has me intrigued, although going by how little is actually known about it, I guess that anyone that gets close to the truth gets neuralyzed. In fact, there&#39;s probably a small but very specialised division/department dedicated to the preservation of the pool&#39;s secrecy - it&#39;s the only thing that makes sense (it might even be that &#39;other department&#39; that Nita referred to, I mean, what else could that be?). <br><br>You fought zombies in Ireland? Was that the big incursion of &#39;04? I missed that due to some university project work I was doing at the time, but I heard a lot of crazy stories about it from my uncles.

Having heard of your preference for - high-tech - weapons, and being a bit of a sword collector myself, I was wondering if you might consider a trade?

After getting a Romulan culture implant, she decided that she still didn&#39;t want to be Romulan. Her hair covers her ears, so she generally comes across as a Trekverse human.<br>Agent history: She began her existence as a Generic Star Trek Alien serving as first officer on a ship of bit characters. Eventually, her species was revealed to be &quot;Roumlants&quot;. Since the author had failed to spell &quot;Romulan&quot; correctly throughout the entire fic, every Romulan - now including &quot;Tanya&quot; - was a mini-tribble. However, the agents realized she was still sentient and brought her to medical, where they constructed a Generic Romulan Female body for her. However, her short time as a tribble lead to her hair looking slightly tribble-ish, and she has a fondness for grain products, bread, bagels, etc.<br><br>Name: Lucana<br>Age: Unspecified<br>Species: Vulcan  <br>Home Continuum: Star Trek<br>Department: Floaters<br>Division: Eclectic Subdivision of Advanced Species<br>Response Center: (haven&#39;t come up with it yet)<br>Partner: Tani<br>Fandom(s): Star Trek, anything her author knows<br>Lust-object(s):    none yet<br>Favorite(s): none yet <br>Weapon(s): She&#39;s trying to learn the Vulcan nerve pinch.<br>Appearance: Generic Vulcan female. <br>Personality: She had very little in-fic, besides being a &quot;sinance officer&quot; and shouting &quot;with Logic&quot;. This odd characterization led her to be somewhere in between Vulcan and human emotionally, leaning more towards human. After getting a Vulcan culture implant, she decided that she wanted to be full Vulcan. However, she doesn&#39;t have the patience to meditate, so she mostly comes across as cold or contradicting herself, for example shouting &quot;STOP ANNOYING ME, I&#39;M TRYING TO BE LOGICAL!&quot;<br>Agent history: She began her existence as a Generic Vulcan named Lucy serving as &quot;sinance&quot; officer on a ship of bit characters. She, Tani, and their captains (he was cloned due to bad spelling) were recruited. <br><br></p>

            <p>Favorite food: It used to be chocolate, but since my last mission I&#39;ve needed regular doses of Bleeprin to stop the memories. So lots of Bleepolate products. I&#39;m the one behind that effort to expand the inventory - you know, it&#39;s always just been plain bleepolate, but I&#39;m pushing for dark bleepolate, dark bleepolate with raspberries, bleepolate peanut butter cups, bleepolate covered strawberries, mint bleepolate...You get the idea. I prefer dark chocolate, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m pushing for it in bleep-form.<br><br>Least favorite food: The only foods I will refuse to eat are organ meats. Other than that, only food I truly find disgusting is what they serve in the cafeteria. Yay for replicators!<br><br>Favorite color: Purple. I have a fluffy purple hat I wear around the RC, and I would wear it on missions if it were canonical for Star Trek. Not a fan of pink, though.<br><br>Favorite Weather: Weather? In HQ? Well, I prefer too cold to too hot, because you can always put on a coat. Joani, on the other hand, would think Mount Doom was cozy warm.<br><br>Favorite animal: You mean non-human animal, I presume. In that case, tribble.</p>

            <p>((Seeing as these agents are self-inserts, this requires me to think about my parents in the context of the PPC. Hm…))<br>Well, I don&#39;t like giving out personal information online, but I will say this much:<br><br>1. My parents did raise me and my sister.<br><br>2. My mother is a published author - nobody famous, you wouldn&#39;t have heard of her. My dad was a software engineer, until he had a stroke. (Don&#39;t start offering your sympathies, it was four years ago, he&#39;s recovered a <i>lot</i>, and besides, I&#39;ve been through worse at the PPC.) I credit them both with making me and my sister geeky, and my mother in particular for encouraging me to write.<br><br>3. Joani is my only sibling. Thank gods, one of her is bad enough.<br><br>4. I am the older one, and therefore more mature. Don&#39;t let her height fool you, she&#39;s three years younger. Though I don&#39;t like the term &quot;firstborn&quot;. Because it&#39;s always the firstborn who needs to be given to Rumplestiltskin, or killed in a plague. And I remember reading some fairy tales and noticing that many of the heroes were the youngest. And that I&#39;d have to inherit the throne…wait…no, that&#39;s still bad, because as Captain Picard said, &quot;Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot; Of course he could have beeen quoting Shakespeare. It&#39;s still awesome. Especially since that was a Q episode…<br><br>*ahem*<br><br>I&#39;m probably going off on a tangent here. I hope you don&#39;t think less of me for it.<br><br>~Tanya Verde<br><br><br>((FYI, most of that was true. Besides the having gone through worse at the PPC part. I&#39;d be too comfortable in a world of fiction, so I had to give Tanya some horrible experiences at the PPC.))<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Marvin: Sorry about our author&#39;s misunderstanding of your question.<br><br>Printworthy: Though honestly, how he managed to get confused baffles me. It was a rather strait forward question really.<br><br>Marvin: Perhaps, but confused he was, so just, you know, cut him a little slack.<br><br>Printworthy: Well, if I were to describe Marvin, I would say... Kind, passionate, and... honestly, occasionally creepy.<br><br>Marvin: Hey, what do you mean creepy?<br><br>Printworthy: When one is a pony and the other is a brony, it can get creepy, alright? Especially after a round of... anatomical questions.<br><br>Marvin: Hey, I was curious, alright? What&#39;s so wrong with that?<br><br>Printworthy: Explaining each and every aspect of how ones horn, legs and facial mussels work gets tiring and a little disturbing.<br><br>Marvin: Well, three words I would use to describe Printworthy are; intelligent, neat, and gramatical.<br><br>Printworthy: Marvin, gramatical is not used that way. Grammatical refers to the use, usually quality, of a particular work&#39;s grammar.<br><br>Marvin: Yeah, and you are really good with grammar, as shown by your correcting of my use of the word grammatical. See what I mean?<br><br>Printworthy: Perhaps.

            <p>Sorry about that. Here are Marvin and Printworthy&#39;s bios I used for permission, that should be enough to work off of.  <br><br>Marvin<br>Home Continuum: World One<br>Physical Description: 5’7” Caucasian male with green eyes and short brown hair. Overweight, yet not insanely out of shape, though he gets winded faster than he probably should. Requires glasses or other vision-enhancing material to be able to see things further than two feet away clearly.<br> <br>Marvin is a massive fan of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Because of his enthusiasm for the show, he has received accusations from some agents of being a fanboy. Is he? Well, he does not think so. He does not lust after the ponies, he does not write bad fanfiction, and his interest is only a little more than the average person. Ok, maybe a lot more. Still, he is a fan, and loves the show, and he hates the idea of somebody harming the canon because they did not know that they were doing with their words. Because of this, he extends the same passion he has for the show to his missions. Outside of missions, he is calm and friendly, though shy at first. Get to know him though, and he will be a loyal, honest, kind friend.<br> <br>Printworthy<br>Home Continuum: My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic<br>Physical Description: Unicorn with a dark blue body, gray and white mane, and light blue eyes. Cutie mark is a book and quill. Owns a pair of reading glasses for comfort, though does not require them.<br> <br>Printworthy was the author of the famous Daring Do adventure novels…in an unpublished My Little Pony Fanfiction. For years he lived peacefully in his small home in Trottingham, writing and looking for inspiration for his next novel. One day, while exploring an ancient dig site for inspiration for his new Daring Do novel, he stumbled into a plothole that led to PPC HQ, landing on Marvin, and changing his life forever. As an author, he has seen badfic before, and hates it all the more because of his personal experience with it. Inside missions, he usually writes the charge list, as he has an eye for bad spelling and grammar that is much more refined than Marvin. He is sociable, friendly, and tries to choose his words carefully, though he is easy to exasperate and gets annoyed with ignorance quickly.</p>

            <p>Believe it or not, most of the packages we get are fairly standard contraband.  We get a lot of chocolate and coffee.  However, we do get some things that are less ordinary.  Flames are always &quot;fun&quot; to deal with.  Most of the equipment that DoSAT orders are better handled by someone above my pay grade.  We, of course, have to deal with the occasional inexplicably buzzing package addressed to Agent Luxury.<br><br>However, you were asking about the strangest.

            <p>Agent Garkaran,<br><br>Well, there&#39;s a funny story behind that. See, I was slated to team up with someone who knows Mass Effect a year ago to investigate a fic, but that sort of slipped into limbo after my accident.<br><br>I had only received my commission for about a month and I had just discovered the joys of using a D.O.R.K.S. When I set the device to &quot;CMC-300&quot; to practice my marksmanship with the C-14 at the shooting range, my arms kinda bent in ways that arms weren&#39;t supposed to bend (don&#39;t even get me started on where my shoulders ended up) and I spent most of the following weeks in Medical doing physiotherapy. So...ouch. <br><br>I guess some other agent was assigned to that fic.<br><br>--De Grasse<br><br>((IRL, time constraints and an astonishing amount of schoolwork. Sorry &#39;bout that.))<br></p>

            <p>Dear Concerned:<br><br>If you are referring to yesterday&#39;s Great Tribble Invasion of the Cafeteria, rest assured that even if the agent in question was shouting &quot;The Sub Rosa&#39;s going to kill me&quot;, this had nothing to do with our department head. Agent Harris is simply a very excitable young man. The Sub Rosa is similarly not involved in the Straightening of the Escher Room (caused by Harris) or the Overly Long and Boring Elcor Opera (accidentally broadcasted on a loop by Harris). <br><br>Besides, I cannot fathom what the Sub Rosa woud gain from replacing every meat-based dish served in the Cafeteria by Tribble steaks.
