            <p>Hi! My name is Jessica, Jess if you prefer, and it&#39;ll probably be a while before I write anything deemed good enough to present for Permission asking, but thought I&#39;d introduce myself now.<br>My main fandoms are Sherlock (BBC and canon exclusively) with some Doctor Who and other assorted loveliness. I love pretty much everything Ireland-related, and am looking forward to (hopefully) becoming a Sue Slayer. That&#39;s pretty much it.</p>

            <p>Shared fandoms! Yay!<br><br>Also, nice to meet you! Welcome! And sorry for being so late about this...I cite the extenuating circumstances of being on a five-day trip/vacation with no internet :)<br><br>So yes, welcome to the Board! Have some tasty Swiss Bleepolate, for when you need to get those nasty details off your mind! This bleeproduct distracts you with chocolate-y goodness while dulling horrific memories, and is often much sought-after by chocolate-addicted PPC agents who have just completed particularly bad missions. Also...*rummages through closet*, have a...thing. It was never described properly, so the most it&#39;s ever settled on is that it&#39;s small enough to be held in one hand. Occasionally, it can be convinced to turn shiny, and then be used to distract unwantedly-homicidal partners.<br><br>Ireland is fun. Do you live there, or just love it? Also, how and when did you discover the PPC?<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Since I would consider myself a chocolate addict, Swiss Bleepolate should prove delicious as well as useful. As for the thing, well... since I&#39;m pretty sure that I know who my partner&#39;s going to be, an anti-homicidal object is most appreciated.<br>To answer your questions, I love Ireland, and don&#39;t live there unfortunately.<br>As to how I found PPC, one of the authors who wrote BSFA mentioned on her Tumblr that they got their standards for Mary Sues from you so I look you guys up, and it kind of snowballed.<br>- jlaurel</p>

            <p>Ah well, best to save it for a rainy day, yes? :D<br><br>Excellent question! I like your investigative instincts! -is bricked for MLP reference-<br><br>Bleepnerds are a bleep-based candy created by SpecstacularSC. They&#39;re like Nerds, except they&#39;re made of Bleeprin and colored sugar instead of... whatever Nerds are made of. They come in glose, urple, and bleen and are wonderful for wiping out the memory of specific (and typically mind-scarring) events, much like all the other bleep-based products, which you can read about <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Bleeprin">here</a>.<br><br>And if you&#39;re confused about what glose, urple, and bleen are, they are Sue colors, and the Sue spectrum is listed and explained pretty thoroughly on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sue_Colour_Spectrum">this</a> page.<br><br>That remind me for whatever reason, which missions have you read yet~?</p>

            <p>Hello Jess (if you don&#39;t mind me calling you that, as I already know a Jessica, so this is less confusing for me).  Do you have a family connection to Ireland?

            <p>I&#39;ve read pretty much everything (constitution, how to get permission, etc). But since there&#39;s a lot to remember, I&#39;m hoping to kind of get a feel for it by just being here.<br>Thank you for the canonical hat. I&#39;ll wear it when I&#39;m writing fic and eat the muffins at the same time.<br>Its kind of a long story. In a nutshell, I found MBSFA and BSFA purely by accident, then when I was on one of the author&#39;s Tumblr accounts, they said they got their standards and rules on Mary Sue&#39;s from you guys, so I checked it out, and it kind of escalated from there. My friend and I are hoping (after a time) to become a Sue-slaying team. Like I said though, there&#39;s much to get familiarized with before we can properly proceed. Like reading the Original Series and hanging about the board and chatrooms.<br>Sorry. I have a bad habit of writing novels instead of short replies. &quot;Summary&quot; is not in my vocabulary.</p>

            <p>Since us PPCers are supposed to be both creative <i>and</i> crazy, I thought of something that should be right up our alley!<br><br>Have any of you heard the term &quot;misheard lyrics&quot; or &quot;soramimi&quot;? Long story short, you take a song that is in a language you don&#39;t know (or a song that is supposed to be in English, but is completely unintelligible) and make up lyrics based on what you heard. One of my favorites is <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2013/www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFjaoYZ7jlA">this parody of the Super Smash Bros. Brawl theme song</a>.<br><br>So my challenge to you, should you accept it, is this: There are two songs in desperate need of misheard lyrics! We have &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usf3-SD4XyQ">Fighting Fate</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7VCTBn6TjQ">Born Anew</a>,&quot; both from Final Fantasy XIII! For either song (or both, if you&#39;re crazy enough), please make up the funniest misheard lyrics that you can, and post those lyrics under the appropriate sub-heading.<br><br>Have fun!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry, but I just can&#39;t hear the words well enough to make up a homophonic translation. If there&#39;s another version of either of those songs that&#39;s a little heavier on the vocals and lighter on the orchestra, I&#39;d be happy to try again.<br>Also, I would just like to say that Nobuo Uematsu is a genius.

            <p>Sorry, but I do not know of any links that are heavier on the vocals/lighter on the orchestra. However, if you search the name of the song on YouTube (e.g. &quot;FFXIII Born Anew&quot;; &quot;FFXIII Fighting Fate&quot;), you might be able to find something.<br><br>However, part of the fun of soramimi is that the lyrics <i>aren&#39;t</i> clear! That&#39;s what gives birth to such hilarity; we make up words based on what we hear. For example, with Born Anew, a common soramimi lyric I see for the first few notes is:<br><br><i> Give me coffee!<br>For the horse!<br>For!<br>The!<br>Horse!</i><br><br>which sounds <i>nothing</i> like the real Latin lyrics!</p>

            <p>Yes, I am very much enjoying all the snow...although with public transportation, not so much. And we&#39;re supposed to get <i>more</i> today and this weekend.

The English and French aren&#39;t on particularly good terms at this point in history, and only if the Sue had a French mother would you see her named something like that. At least, in the world we know and love.<br><br>Peaceful, ladylike dreams? Ha-ha ha-ha. <br><br>Oh, and Rachel would have been much more plausible, as it&#39;s the English version of a Biblical name.

            <p>I give you fangirling/feedback!<br>I <i>love</i> your missions! I read them all over the span of a few days and I was so sad when they were over. I love how the agents interact with the canons a little bit - kind of what I was planning for my Star Trek missions, actually, because Star Trek characters have a habit of finding out when there are people sneaking around their ships. And all the humor that comes from bad SPaG, like Urple Clouds and implausible eye colors are so funny! (I found a Star Trek Suefic where the Sue&#39;s eyes were described as being &quot;Like fire and ice melting together.&quot; What color is that, exactly?) And Isaiah/Quen is awesome! Mostly because Isaiah is so awkward. I quite like your LOTR missions - normally I get bored, because there are so many of them, but you handled it well, especially since you had the agents point out how that wasn&#39;t so common for them. <br>I look forward to reading any new missions you come out with.<br></p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t actually <i>use</i> the term fangirling. :P<br><br>And yes, my mission count has climbed slowly but steadily--I have fifteen done, which is more than most agent pairs have, sadly. And yes, I plan to go out with a bang, but that is for a little while down the road. I too love the humor that comes from bad spelling and grammar. My favorite eye line is probably, &quot;There was a spark of something in his chocolate orbs, but it disappeared as soon as it appeared.&quot; There are <i>so many</i> bad eye lines in PotC fic. Really, I&#39;ve only scratched the surface.<br><br>Like fire and ice melting together...um, hate to tell the Suethor this, but fire doesn&#39;t melt. Maybe she meant <i>meld</i>ing together, which makes it very ironic that she avoided that word in a <i>Star Trek</i> Suefic. But fire and ice coming together would be, uh, steam. So the color would be grayish white. ...Exotic? <br><br>Ahahaha, yes good ole awkward Isaiah. I still keep in touch with Quen&#39;s author now and then, so the saga might not be over yet. Glad you like the LotR missions! I do try to space them out, because as you said, what hasn&#39;t been done there? (Just go down the list of Assassination Methods on the wiki, for instance.)<br><br>The group mission will be a nice return to form, if I can get the blasted thing going again. Now, to have a look at that spreadsheet...</p>

The OFU for PotC, anyway--that&#39;s got to be one of my favorites. I mean, what hasn&#39;t it got? Interactions with IC canon characters, interactions with students, Misspelled Monkeys, Mara and Isaiah being mistaken for students, Isaiah getting fangirls, and the entire Isaiah and Quen storyline--yes, it&#39;s got it all! Hence, favorite :)<br><br>I did catch the &#39;Bella Swann&#39; thing...which, of course, is a pretty bad name unless she&#39;s actually Spanish.<br><br>On the plus side, &#39;Rachelle&#39; is not &#39;Michelle&#39;. Then I&#39;d have to &#39;terminate with extreme prejudice&#39;, for the cause of ruining a Beatles song that I love.<br><br>(Grew up on them, spent &#39;formative years&#39; reading them...same difference :) The story is that I discovered the PPC somewhere around 4 or 5 years ago, probably through OFUM--or perhaps through PPC spin-offs on FFN--and then spent at least two years reading PPC-related fiction, MSTs, and such-like. Eventually, that boiled down into just being pretty well-versed in Sue-related things and keeping an eye on Deleterius. And then, several months ago, I got it into my head to reread the Original Series, and OFUM, and Suedom, and then I found out that the Board/PPC was still active, so...I decided to say hi :) And now, here I am, one month and one day later, putting together a Permission request. My, how time flies...)<br><br>Well, jury&#39;s still out on whether her real mother is French--all I know is that she&#39;s adopted and has some sort of connection to sea voyages, which, coupled with the summary, means pirates, which means Jack Sparrow, which means I get to yell &#39;SUE!&#39; and hopefully send agents out after her.<br><br>...I think I&#39;m in the very happy position of knowing that it is *extremely* unlikely that a Sue will ever steal my name, just because it&#39;s such an uncommon one that I hardly ever run into anyone who even knows it, although there have been a few close encounters. In fact, this year (well, last year, now) marks the first time that I have ever personally met someone with the same name, and it wasn&#39;t even the name she goes by. So...yay, uncommon names! I can sympathize, though. Have you run across many Sues named Rachel? It doesn&#39;t really seem like a Sue-ish name--not speshul enough (note how this one is &#39;Rachelle&#39;)--but you never know...<br><br>Yup, &quot;peaceful, ladylike dreams&quot;. Exact quote. I believe my reaction was, &quot;Ahahaha…excuse me, you do *not* know Elizabeth. Charge for being Elizabeth’s adoptive sister and not knowing anything about her personality.&quot; (I tend to make notes of potential charges while reading through badfic. It&#39;s therapeutic, and gives me an idea of how good it would be for sporking material--or for how much it deserves it. If I gather a page&#39;s worth from reading two paragraphs, then I start thinking about claiming it. My theory is that having these lists will make it easier to write the missions, but I have no idea if it will work in practice…hopefully it will. If nothing else, it gives me a good laugh to reread them, and helps me remember what’s in each badfic.)<br><br>Well, that got pretty long. Hopefully you don&#39;t mind. Nice talking to you (and hopefully not *at* you).<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Weird. Seriously, it feels really weird to be a well-known someone, even in a small subsection of fandom.

            <p>Volleyball? *Volleyball*? In Middle-earth?<br>You know, that actually sounds vaguely familiar...<br>Oh, that one. Makes sense--I would have read the mission a while ago. I&#39;m pretty sure I read all of Mara and Isaiah&#39;s missions at some point.<br>*reads further* ...ouch...this is painful. Isaiah has my sympathies. (So does Mara. So do you, actually. It hurts. And I don&#39;t think the actual story has even started yet!)<br><br>Ugh, colds are no fun. One of my roommates has a mild one right now, actually. Try to stay warm and drink lots of tea (rosehip if you can get it--it has vitamin C). Also, echinacea, ginseng, and oil of oregano are very good. -end un-asked for advice on herbal medicine-<br><br>Yes, that does sound pretty nervewracking. And, well, enjoy your &#39;well-known someone&#39; status (since there really isn&#39;t much of anything else you can do about it). :) It does seem like something that would feel weird, though. I keep thinking how I&#39;d feel if I were Jay or Acacia, and I was curious to see if the PPC was still running and came to check it out, and then found this huge fandom...It&#39;s pretty impressive, you know. And amazing, for that matter. Quite inspiring :)<br><br>Well, this newbie is quite happy to talk. I like talking. I&#39;m even the Queen of Babbling (self-proclaimed). So, yes. Quite happy to talk, mostly because you seem quite nice.<br><br>You know, it&#39;s funny. With the Rachel mission, I only vaguely remember that there was volleyball somewhere in it, but the picture at the top is very familiar. Interesting what the mind remembers several years later...<br><br>By the way, quick question--can bad songfics set in one fandom with no non-canon characters (or at least no Mary-Sues) be given to DMS or DIC agents? If not, who handles them?<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Actually, I&#39;m a tea drinker normally, although I&#39;m not much for echinacea and ginseng. There is a wonderful lemon and ginger tea from Twinings that I like, though. <br><br>If you&#39;d like to chat more, I&#39;m on AIM (as Araeph).

Now, if your agents are in DMS/DIC, that&#39;s fine--you just have to get permission from your Department Head for a temporary transfer (and clear it with the Department of Personnel). Agent Rosie Cotton Bomull, for instance, was a DMO agent, but she helped out Agent Mara for the (very satisfactory) demise of one Felina Wisebriar.<br><br>~Araeph</p>

I&#39;ll figure that out...sometime this week, I think. Hopefully.<br><br>DTE, huh? Alright...Who do I, personally, have to talk to? I mean, is it just the SO or the Lichen signing off on a temporary transfer and the Marquis de Sod agreeing that it would be alright, or do I, DawnFire, go to another Boarder and ask? (Also, I&#39;m assuming the mission&#39;s charge list would follow the DTE&#39;s format?)<br><br>(And do the agents have to want to do the mission and request the temporary transfer, or can it be Orders from Above--er, from the Flowers? Because I can&#39;t see any agents in their right minds actually *wanting* to take this one on. It actually seems more plausible as a punishment, really. That&#39;s not to say that it wouldn&#39;t make good sporking material, though--I think it could be hilarious, for anyone who isn&#39;t one of the agents assigned to it).<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Well, the nice thing about all of these intricate PPC procedures is...you can make &#39;em up as you go along. <br><br>In all seriousness, a lot of time PPC procedure varies from spin-off to spin-off, as there was next to no procedural gobbledygook in the Original Series (outside of the mission formulas themselves). If your agents came across a fic that you really wanted to PPC, you would probably just ask the S.O.&#39;s permission and he would forward the transfer order to Personnel. If you were assigned to it, the S.O. would transfer you himself and let you know about it...eventually...probably at the least convenient time. :P Basically, if it feels like something the PPC would do, then you&#39;re probably on the right track.<br><br>And hooray for chatting!<br><br><br>~Araeph<br><br></p>

            <p>And don&#39;t worry...I&#39;m flattered that you want to know more about the DTE!<br><br>As you can see in <a href="http://uncommon-comma.livejournal.com/8003.html">this mission</a>, a Sue is not necessary at all for a fic to be eligible for a &quot;visit&quot; from the Department of Technical Errors. One thing, though: bad characterization alone wouldn&#39;t cut it; it would have to be that in conjunction with technical errors, since it&#39;s not a main focus of the DTE. The fic you linked me to was certainly not one of the best, but I&#39;m not in the fandom, so I don&#39;t know how many logical flaws it has. Usually the DTE goes after fics where the bad writing jumps out and tries to strangle the readers. :)</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right, this might not be a good DTE mission. The biggest problems I see with it are the paragraph formatting and the entire fight between Tigerclaw and Ravenpaw (which I remain convinced would have been even more unbalanced in Tigerclaw&#39;s favor, because Ravenpaw was terrified of the tom and would not have been able to fend off even another apprentice due to being scrawny and jumpy). I&#39;m not sure how well the DTE would be able to take it down... Hmm, I shall have to find another fic. A worse fic.<br><br>Anyone taken down Starkits Prophcy yet? I know where it&#39;s rehosted.

            <p>Lately I&#39;ve been wallowing in sads over that show getting the axe before its first season even finished airing. I know that&#39;s old news, and the rest of the episodes have already aired, but for a while I was dawdling about watching them because I didn&#39;t want it to be over. I finally finished watching them recently and I think I&#39;m experiencing fandom withdrawal. Now I know what the <i>Firefly</i> fans went through.<br><br>Is anyone else a fan of this show?</p>

            <p>Well, I think it&#39;s time I ask for permission. Mission ideas have been flowing and characters are demanding attention. Before I do ask for permission though, I want to make sure the permission pieces are the best quality they can be. However, I am not sure if the pieces I want to use would work for permission pieces. So, I have two pieces I would highly appreciate being beta read, as well as commented on for appropriateness as permission pieces: one is an original story that is written like a myth, and the other is the meeting of my two agents. The potential problems lie in that the myth is not exactly funny, and I am not sure if the meeting of the agents would count as a PPC story or not. I think it counts under character backstory, as they are not in their department yet, but I am not sure.<br><br>I would be happy to e-mail a copy of the two or just one, depending on preference. The myth I have ready now, but the meeting of the agents is on a separate computer, which I can access later today, but you may have to wait a few hours until I can access the story.</p>

            <p>...and since it&#39;s related, I&#39;ll ask it here.<br><br>I&#39;m working my way up to asking for permission (unless people think it&#39;s too early for me to do that? If so, please let me know, and I&#39;ll wait a little longer before finishing working up to it), and after a lot of waffling (unfortunately sans breakfast foods) I&#39;ve managed to decide on two permission pieces. However, this decision does raise some questions, such as:<br><br>1. Is it possible to use two permission pieces? Each one is one page long (approximately 500 words), and they are very different in style, tone, and genre. Both are original works, and give a stronger impression of my writing together than they do individually, in my opinion.<br><br>2. Can a speech be used as a permission piece? The one I&#39;m talking about is humorous, and is written to showcase the character giving it. It&#39;s more of a monologue than a speech, and has only one stage direction. It was well-received when I read it aloud in the Writer&#39;s Craft class I wrote it for, and it still amuses me, which is part of why I&#39;m considering it. The only bit I&#39;m worried about is that, being a speech, it doesn&#39;t really give a sense of narrative, which is why I want to submit it along with a more purely narrative piece.<br><br>If anyone has answers, please share them :)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Obviously I&#39;m not a Permission Giver, so if one of them comes along later and disagrees with what I say, it might be worth listening to them, seeing as they know quite a lot about this whole <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission#How_Do_I_Get_Permission.3F">&#39;getting Permission&#39; </a>thing. <br><br>First off, it&#39;s never too early to <i>start</i> working towards something. I think there used to be something about waiting &#39;about 1 month or so&#39;, but that seems to have disappeared (or I&#39;m just making it up). Even if that did exist, it was still just a guideline, the important things were to make sure that at least some of the PGs recognised your name, and that you felt that you were ready. That first one is a little tricky to determine, but the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?pli=1&amp;formkey=dExsRGpKMzhPbWVnTlB6TmJVdEttc1E6MQ#gid=0">Permission Self-Check</a> should help with the second. <br><br>As far as I&#39;m aware, there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t use two writing samples if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ve got one that shows off everything you want. I&#39;m not sure if anyone has done it before, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen PGs ask for a second sample if <i>they</i> felt that the first didn&#39;t give them enough info/detail to make a decision, so it&#39;s the same sort of principle.<br><br>Again, as far as I&#39;m aware, there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t use a speech as part of a Permission Request. As you&#39;ve pointed out, it&#39;s possibly an unusual format, and has potential issues with regards to determining story-writing ability, in which case pairing it up with a narrative piece seems like the logical solution. <br><br>Good luck with your Request, whenever it is that you make it.</p>

Still, the risk is there, so I am not sure. As for my fears of the myth, I know it could work, but the wiki mentioned it being better if it was humorous, so that was my only reservation.

            <p>Looks good!  I think it captures River&#39;s moods well and Simon&#39;s protectiveness of her.  It reads well too, fairly fast paced for a story which is really a shot of someone&#39;s thoughts over a small time frame!<br><br>Three thoughts/queries (only my opinion so please feel free to tell me where to put them!):<br><br>i) I&#39;m assuming this is set early in the canon as the crew haven&#39;t discovered River&#39;s past or the fact that she is extremely dangerous in the wrong (or maybe right) situation? <br><br>ii) Simon was also very determined to protect his sister, even going to the point of breaking her out of an Alliance high security (and secret) facility.  I&#39;m not sure his determination and resourcefulness come across fully.<br><br>iii) I may be wrong (I haven&#39;t watched the series in years) but wasn&#39;t there a safe word to turn off River&#39;s violent outbursts?  I think Simon knew the word and used it in Serenity(though feel free to correct me on this point if I&#39;m wrong). If so I assume this is not the words Simon had to find to calm her when frightened or violent?<br><br>Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you like it. :D Given I&#39;m still very new when it comes to experiencing the canon I was hoping I&#39;d captured them properly.<br><br>To answer your queries:<br><br>1. It&#39;s sort of indeterminately placed in the pre-film canon, on purpose - from what I understood the crew were more understanding as time went on, but they still weren&#39;t comfortable when River had an outburst. In the very last episode they were pretty edgy when Kaylee told them about her skill with a gun, even though they did rally around her in the end.<br><br>2. That&#39;s a fair point. I have to say I considered it, but this was sort of a free-flowing thoughts piece, and I couldn&#39;t figure out a way to get what you mentioned across without it feeling crowbarred in. I&#39;ll look the piece over some time and see if I can rewrite.<br><br>3. You&#39;re right. Simon knew a phrase that would send her to sleep and used it in Serenity, but in the TV series itself he just talked her down without it because he was trying to calm her down rather than make her fall asleep - I&#39;m assuming he never thought the situation was so dangerous as to need that extreme.<br><br>Again, I&#39;m so glad you enjoyed it. :D</p>

            <p>Well, my first impression when I read the summary was this:<br><br>&quot;Holy hell, this thing has TWENTY-NINE MINIS!?&quot;<br><br>Yeah, that&#39;s a lot of minis. And I love how they all sort of just gravitated towards Amelia like that, especially with the whole &quot;Chief Mini-Wrangler&quot; thing. That was awesome. And hilarious.<br><br>I think overall this was an interesting first mission, from a pacing standpoint. On the one hand, I love what you did with the spelling errors and the missing punctuation, and I loved that the over-described door that was shown mid-mission ended up being the door behind which a plothole was hiding. But at the same time, most of the mission felt kind of &#39;eh&#39; to me: it was basically me waiting to get to the next surreal spelling-related mishap. And I think the issue is that there&#39;s too much summary in this mission and not enough action in it. Large stretches of time are summarized, and I don&#39;t think that makes for good pacing. So those are my two cents: if there&#39;s a long stretch of time where nothing real happens, I would just use a scene change rather than sum up what happened.<br><br>But where it really shined was the characters. Skeet and Amelia had a GREAT chemistry together. I loved the whole newbie/oldbie dynamic between them, especially as realized with the oldbie being more insane than usual. Seriously, I loved the chemistry between them, and the fact that they had such a good characterization meant I could look past the pacing issues.<br><br>So it&#39;s not the best mission, but it&#39;s a good first mission, and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing where you go from here.</p>

            <p>When I first went through it I thought I was dealing with about 40, but there were a couple of mini-Sues and several duplications. Still, 29 is a lot. I&#39;m pretty sure that <i>every</i> character or place name that was mentioned was misspelled at least once (including a fair few where that one time was the only time they were mentioned). <br><br>The minis were also exceptionally good fun to write. <br><br>I&#39;m glad you liked my agents, and the chemistry between them. When I read other peoples&#39; missions I always like it when you can feel that sort of thing from the partnership, so it&#39;s really cool to hear that I can actually write like that myself. <br><br>As for the pacing, to be honest I know what you mean. It is a little slower-paced than I would have liked, and I did get similar comments from my Betas, but when I was drafting it up I experimented a little with different versions, and they just felt &#39;different&#39; rather than &#39;better&#39;, if that makes sense. <br><br>The badfic itself was pretty slow (I&#39;m still not sure if that was a failed attempt at gradually building the tension, or just a dull plot), and at first I tried taking advantage of the slow pace to go into more detail with Amy&#39;s training, and her getting to know the PPC. But then it ended up being slowly paced <i>and</i> overly long, which was sort of a compounded problem. <br><br>When I tried cutting down the scenes that I dealt with directly, or at least cutting them shorter, it just felt like it was being artificially rushed (probably only because I&#39;d read the original fic in full, it might not have been noticeable to someone just reading the mission, but it was noticeable to me writing it). And there didn&#39;t seem to be any real <i>need</i> for the agents to rush it; those two were hardly the worst Sues the PPC has come across, mostly they just seemed to wander around the country spawning minis (and small craters from ballistic punctuation marks). From an in-universe point of view, I think it kind of makes sense for new agents to be sent out on slower paced stuff, to give them more time to learn what they need to know. <br><br>But yeah, I&#39;ll definitely try to keep a close on the pacing in future missions. Maybe I could&#39;ve done better with this one. <br><br>Thanks for your comments.</p>

            <p>Is NSFB allowed in the threads?  I hope anyone young enough to be shocked by this discussion won&#39;t understand it anyway, and I&#39;ve tried to be as elliptical as possible.<br><br>I&#39;ve been reading through Agent Trojie&#39;s very scary missions, and I started wondering what biologically plausible dino reproductive anatomy might have been like.  The closest evolutionary relatives are birds, especially if we&#39;re considering &#39;raptors from JP, rather than the legendary sauropod incident.  The normal cloacal method in birds is going to get logistically difficult with the larger dinosaurs, isn&#39;t it?  Most birds don&#39;t have &quot;intromittent organs&quot;, but they have evolved at least twice (in ratites and in galloanserae, both of which include very large-bodied species), so it&#39;s not that unlikely that they could show in dinosaurs, is it?  What I can&#39;t find out on the internet is whether they&#39;d leave any distinctive skeletal anatomic features that might be visible in fossil forms.  I don&#39;t think Lagerstaetten fossils are going to help, because the chances of actually having the relevant soft tissues exposed are pretty slim.  Does anyone have any ideas, either from anatomy of extant species or from fossils?  Eggshell formation (obviously in the female now!) will be happening too low down in the cloaca to tell us anything interesting about the structures deeper in, won&#39;t it? <br><br>Inevitably, my brain went to the infamous duck videos; I truly and sincerly hope no badficcers ever make that connection.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to stay away from anything other than pure scientific terms and the offer of some web links if you really want detail!  If you do, let me know and I&#39;ll find a way of posting a link or two to you.<br><br>To be honest the general answer is, everything we know is an educated guess, but our best guess is that it was akin to birds.<br><br>In some ways it may well depend on the species as well, but what is highly suggestive is that T-Rex and Allosaurus (and therefore likely most of the related species) had a medullary bone, similar to that found in modern birds.  Further the bone has also been found in Tenontosaurus, which diverged from the Allosaurus/T-Rex genetic line very early in dinosaur evolution.  This is suggestive that the majority of dinosaurs (at least of these lines in evolution) would have worked in the same way.<br><br>Birds produce this type of bone tissue around the time of laying viable eggs.<br><br>I hope that nothing in the above is NSFW, if it is I apologise, but I&#39;ve tried to keep it away from the area.</p>

            <p>That tallies with the fossil eggs that definitely show calcium carbonate shells with a similar structure to modern birds&#39; eggs.

            <p>Therefore, this is only my personal opinion.<br><br>You opened this discussion with scientific intent, and didn&#39;t use any vulgar words, so I think you are safe. The admins may have different ideas, I&#39;m afraid.<br><br>As for dinosaur reproduction, I suggest we use birds only to compare anatomy, or mating behaviour with smaller dinosaurs. Larger dinosaurs, such as Triceratops may have the same problems as elephants, so their reproductive tactics and behaviour may be similar. After all, supporting extra few tonnes of love is hard on the bones, lousy pun intended to keep it SFW.</p>

            <p>I, for one, respect and even appreciate the work lawyers do and have to go though, so I don&#39;t mind them. May I ask, criminal, civil, or something else entirely? Part of me would find it humorous if a lawyer who worked predominantly on copyright cases wrote and sporked fanfiction. I&#39;m not sure why, but it does.<br><br>Now, your gift! Hmm, you&#39;re a fan of Warhammer 40K, so therefore I will give you: A power fist! Good luck finding the armor that will make it work though...<br><br>(I was going to give you something from the original Warhammer fantasy game, but I knew nothing about either of the canons, so I just hopped onto the Warhamer 40K wiki, looked up weapons and grabbed what looked cool. Now, if we were talking WarCRAFT, that would be something else entirely.)</p>

            <p>The book is a sci-fi novel.  It&#39;s 2/3 done at the moment and I had intended it (maybe eventually) to be a new era for the Warhammer universe, i.e. the Dark Age of Technology, maybe circa M22-24.  If the Black Library don&#39;t like the idea then it stands alone as well.

            <p>Personally, if I do write sci-fi anything, I don&#39;t typically get much into the details, more out of a lack of ability than a lack of interest.

            <p>All this talk of lawyers and sci-fi has reminded me of a book series that I meant to tell you about. The &#39;JAG in space&#39; series by John G. Hemry.<br><br>It&#39;s a fairly &#39;hard&#39; military sci-fi setting, and the main character is the legal officer on a military spaceship. It&#39;s quite a different setting to most of the other stuff I read, there are no fleets, most of the time the ship is alone in space, or with only a couple of others around, and there are no frantic battles. The action mainly revolves around the main character as he deals with life aboard ship and the legal issues that come up: the court-martial of a captain that accidentally destroys a civilian vessel, acts of treason, sabotage and cover-ups.<br><br>I&#39;ve never really been a fan of courtroom dramas on TV, but I actually found these really interesting, even though large portions of each book are taken up with the minutiae of the trial(s) in each case. <br><br>I think you should check them out. </p>

            <p>Yes Star Trek! I&#39;d say my favourite is TNG, Picard is my kind of captain.  Race wise I would probably go for the Borg, at least before they brought in the queen.  A soleless race eating up everything before them!  Kind of like necrons really!<br><br></p>

            <p>TNG was kind of my first Star Trek series, because while I watched some TOS episodes (tribbles for the win!) to start, I kept catching reruns of TNG and therefore became more well-versed in it. Picard is my favorite captain, though I like Janeway too. But one cannot argue with the calm, tea-drinking European that survived torture, assimilation, and being stabbed through the heart. Picard is just awesome.<br><br>I don&#39;t know, I liked when the Borg Queen was brought in, because it gave a face to the enemy of the Borg, kind of like Locutus did. It made it very personal, especially with Voyager and Seven of Nine&#39;s character arc. You get implications that the Borg Queen is her mother, showing how the Borg basically raised her. (Seven is one of my favorite characters.)<br></p>

            <p>Now, I took a class in Canadian and International Law in high school.

I normally get through that sort of thing by not reading it straight--usually I go for MSTs, missions, dramatic readings, or, in one hilarious case, a live-action trailer.

Let&#39;s just agree that I have my insane moments.<br><br>I think it would depend on what the legal document is about. Er, possibly. Probably not. But it would be amusing to see an agent illegally going into one for a mission...(or you could always MST it, of course).<br><br>...I don&#39;t know anything about 40K, either...As for Star Trek, my main area of expertise IS TOS...but we&#39;re on better footing with LotR and Discworld, so it&#39;s all good :)<br><br>(Er, technically, you punish the Sues, not the writers. Important distinction)<br><br>Reading missions is definitely a good idea to execute before beginning to write. You seem to be doing pretty well so far, though remember to check out the actual missions (non-TOS)--they&#39;re fun, and definitely help to get a sense of how missions work. Also, good luck with the short stories! (*pats Irish Samurai*)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>Ah, good to know.<br><br>Good heavens, you read Celebrian? Wow. That&#39;s definitely among the worst.<br><br>Hm...if so, then I call the fourth PotC movie.

            <p>The canon not being good doesn&#39;t make it badfic, and it is bad taste to spork it like you would a fanfic.<br>And about the Hobbit movie: go into it with an open mind. Be prepared for major deviations from the book. However, do not go in believing that it will be awful. I enjoyed it, and maybe you will too.</p>

            <p>Yes, not enough bleeprin in the world....<br><br>I thought that was probably the case.

I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s been a few years since I&#39;ve read the Hobbit, but I&#39;m pretty sure the main antagonist of the movie didn&#39;t exist in the book!  Also, not quite sure how they&#39;ll stretch it to three movies as they&#39;re already half to two thirds of the way through the plot after one (sorry don&#39;t want to give away too much as you haven&#39;t seen it!)<br><br>Moon</p>

            <p>And torturing them. I know it was meant as a joke, but that was decidedly unfunny.

            <p>Sorry about the off-colour remarks (they were intended to be funny, and mostly at my expense, but obviously didn&#39;t come across like that - mea culpa).  <br><br>The main frustration I have with the films is when characterisation bleeds into allegedly book!verse stories: it&#39;s quite hard to find the unadulterated continuum these days.

            <p>(Begin rant)<br>The Lightning Thief is the first book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, which is about a troubled twelve-year-old boy living in New York City (Percy Jackson) who in very Harry Potter-esque fashion learns that he is a demigod out of ancient Greek mythology. He ends up going to a summer camp for other half-bloods, before being sent on a quest to the Underworld with his new friends Grover and Annabeth. Humor ensues as Percy discovers how Greek gods and monsters blend into modern American society. (For example, Medusa sells statuary) The other books show his other adventures, new monsters and gods, and threats to Mt. Olympus (which is on top of the Empire State Building). The series grew popular due to its humor, cleverness, and interesting characters. So they decided to make a movie.<br><br>And, of course, completely change the entire plot. Percy and his friends grow up as the series goes on, yet the movie begins with them being sixteen or seventeen. Older than twelve, at any rate. Much of the humor was taken out in favor of monster fight scenes, and Annabeth, originally a Hermione-ish character with a tough side, was made out to be simply a warrior girl, without any brainiac tendencies. They even broke Greek mythology canon by showing Persephone in the Underworld scenes, while the movie was set in the summer. A whole new plot element was introduced that didn&#39;t need to be, and there were whole scenes that didn&#39;t have any basis in the book. I&#39;m fine with changes, it&#39;s when the changes have no basis in the original that I don&#39;t like them.<br>So, while I realize the LOTR books and movies have differences, I don&#39;t think any characterization was so far off as to nearly character replace someone. The essence of Percy Jackson was in its humor and characterization, and both of those things were thrown away for the sake of action. <br><br>(end rant) I highly recommend the books, though.<br><br>And actually, I agree that Return of the King wasn&#39;t that good. It seemed to me that they spent too long on action scenes and not enough time on scenes that mattered. The entire Faramir/Eowyn romance was cut, and so was &quot;the hands of the king are the hands of a healer&quot; scene - one of my favorites in the book. But in comparison to what they did to the Lightning Thief, the LOTR movies are wonderful.</p>

            <p>I actually saw the film first, so I thought it was pretty good. Then I read the books, and realised that they were much better.<br><br>The main difference I can remember between the book and the film was that, in the film, there was a character that was just <i>too damn cool</i> to not be evil. Seriously, I guessed the identity of the Lightning Thief pretty much the first time they came onscreen.<br><br>The book handled it a lot more subtly (and therefore better, in my opinion), to the extent that I was genuinely wondering if they changed the Thief&#39;s identity for the film. <br><br>I can understand some of the changes they made, aging the characters up may have just been about getting actors that could handle the action sequences (or just the shooting schedule - I would imagine that younger actors have more restrictions on the number of hours they can work, etc.). As for some of the other changes... yeah, not so much. </p>

            <p>...will probably seize on our hope and make the movie worse. Besides, how are they going to build off the first movie? They took out everything that was built upon in later books like Thalia&#39;s tree, Clarisse (hmm, and Annabeth wasn&#39;t intelligent. Something against female characters, much?), Grover&#39;s quest for Pan, all of Annabeth&#39;s personality, Kronos, etc. So I don&#39;t know. I think the best thing to do would be to just wipe the drawing board clean and start over with a completely new cast and crew. <br>I sound optimistic, don&#39;t I? *sarcasm* I&#39;m just defensive of the books that got me through my horrible middle school years. </p>

            <p>...let&#39;s hope not. But you definitely have a point with all that--maybe they&#39;re just introduce them later/in a different way than in the books? Who knows. But most of the cast (no idea about the crew) is different (well, the main cast, at any rate), so...there may be hope?<br><br>Heh. I can understand the defensiveness--if this was, say, Tamora Pierce or Gerald Morris or Lloyd Alexander, I&#39;d be up in arms. As it is, I enjoyed the Percy Jackson series (seriously--they&#39;re really fun! Not to mention creative, and full of elements of the Greek myths that were some of my bedtime stories when I was little), but I&#39;m not exactly fanatical about them. (However, that&#39;s not to say that if you show me a badfic I won&#39;t get angry. I will. I really will. I just...probably wouldn&#39;t be *as* angry as I would with a badfic set in a different fandom.<br><br>(...er, let&#39;s not test that out...*glances nervously in whatever direction you look when trying not to tempt the Ironic Overpower. I&#39;m guessing...sideways. Possibly on a diagonal*)<br><br>Speaking of badfic, I&#39;m currently trawling through a horrific Star Trek: AOS songfic. It features Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Uhura, Gaila, and a chorus of crew-members singing relatively modern songs, ranging from Disney to the Beatles (!), as well as a bunch of random pop-songs. The song lyrics are occasionally adapted for Star Trek, but not generally very well. And, making it even *worse* (Spock singing the words &quot;You&#39;ve got a friend in me&quot; is pretty terrifying), each song is preceded and followed by a run-on sentence or two. And the sentences are not only run-on, but full of further bad SPaG, too. There&#39;s even the occasional mini-tribble.<br><br>So, yes. Ouch. It huuuuurrrrts. I want it to go away. Actually, I want to PPC it, and get rid of Character Rupture!Spock (or possibly Replacement!Spock--I&#39;m not sure yet). Because the ridiculously emotional Vulcan--well, actually, I think that phrase kind of speaks for itself.<br><br>(Everyone else is OOC too, mind--it&#39;s not just Spock. However, OOC Spock is the most painful to watch, since at least the others aren&#39;t supposed to have such wonderful control of their emotions that they hardly ever *show* any.)<br><br>And I&#39;m going to stop there before this really turns into a rant.<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I have read my share of Star Trek badfic in &quot;research&quot; for OFAS, and Emotional!Spock is one of my biggest pet peeves - actually, any logical character made emotional, like Data from TNG or Seven of Nine from Voyager. Hence, Logic Class at OFAS. Seriously, the awesome part of these characters is their logic and how that impacts them. The Spock/McCoy friendship, for example, is a lot less awesome when you make Spock emotional.<br>What I <i>really</i> love, though, is when the Sue claims to be Vulcan or half-Vulcan and acts like a teenage girl. Even claims to have <i>lived</i> on Vulcan. I have seen so many Vulcan!Sues, and not a single one of them has acted like a Vulcan. (T&#39;Mel from OFAS will be used to mock this.)<br>I better stop before I start <i>really</i> ranting. <br>(Ooh! Idea! Concert at OFAS of canonical music! Partially pleasant - Spock&#39;s Vulcan harp - partially painful - Klingon opera.)<br></p>

            <p>...that they undergo Kolinar. Silly Sues.<br><br>I can see why Emotional!Spock* is one of your biggest pet peeves--he&#39;s painful to read. And I can see that...although I haven&#39;t actually met Seven of Nine yet.<br><br>I completely support Logic Class. It sounds like a good thing. And you have a *very* good point about the Spock/McCoy friendship. I mean, the bit where Spock leaves his...my brain is saying &#39;fea&#39;, but it&#39;s katra, right? Too much LotR/Silm today...we&#39;ll go with katra. As I was saying, the part where Spock leaves his katra in McCoy&#39;s mind before he dies would be a heck of a lot less meaningful if he came up to Bones, and cried, and said, &quot;Doctor, I need you to keep my soul in your head for me! If you don&#39;t, I might never be able to come back! Do you hear me?? Never!!&quot;<br>*coughs* I, uh, may have just spent about 20 minutes on Tumblr. But...hopefully you get my point.<br><br>I would go so far as to say that *anything* involving Spock is a lot less awesome when you make him emotional. Except for the episodes where he&#39;s supposed to be, of course. Although, again, those are awesome because they&#39;re done well, and because they don&#39;t happen all the time.<br><br>I am happily new to the woes and ways of ST badfic, and so have yet to meet any Vulcan/half-Vulcan Sues. If you want to toss a particularly bad one my way, though, I&#39;d be happy to claim her. (And possibly give her to OFAS a la Andromielle Zinnia--she was a really bad one, I read the MST once and wanted to punch through the screen--assuming you want her).<br><br>(Who is T&#39;Mel? A Vulcan from TNG? Voyager? Somewhere else...?)<br><br>Ah, well, ranting is fun. It&#39;s also easy to do. Fortunately, it&#39;s generally not *too* hard to stop...otherwise my posts would be about three times longer :)<br><br>Concert at OFAS! That sounds amazing! Can I come? Er, can an agent of mine come to OFAS on a brief vacation and sit grinning in the audience?<br><br>...Klingon opera. Now there&#39;s an...interesting thought.<br><br>~DawnFire<br><br>--<br><br>*I kind of feel like that should be Emotional!!Spock, just because of how unlikely it is.</p>

            <p>Oh Gosh.  I think I need to read those books.  And I can only condole with you about a loved work being turned into a travesty.<br><br>I do disagree with what you said  about the LOTR films &quot;I don&#39;t think any characterization was so far off as to nearly character replace someone&quot;: I thought nearly everyone was replaced with podpeople, starting with Frodo and Aragorn, and the entire Steward&#39;s Family.  (It&#39;s quicker to say that the only major characters I&#39;d actually consider consistent-ish with the book were Eomer, Gandalf and Saruman.  And Shadowfax and Asfaloth, if horses count.) But then, one of my favourite things about Tolkien is that his texts offer so many different interpretations, and I guess mine is no more valid than anyone else&#39;s.</p>

            <p>Because it&#39;s been a while since I read the books, so I really shouldn&#39;t be trying to compare them to the movies, which I&#39;ve seen more recently. <br>I like what you said about different interpretations. That is the mark of true genius in fiction, when the stories and characters have so many layers as to be interpreted differently, sometimes conflictingly, sometimes not to one person&#39;s taste but to another&#39;s. Those fanbases always have the most divisions. But they are also the largest, because stories that are three-dimensional appeal to so many people. <br><br>I actually wouldn&#39;t call the Percy Jackson movie a travesty, because on its own, it was a good movie. As an adaptation of the book, it was bad. I mean, some things need to be changed for cinematic reasons, say, cutting unnecessary scenes for the sake of keeping the movie down to three hours, but there&#39;s a limit. Which, as I said, lands at a different place for everyone. All we have to do is accept each other&#39;s views and just share our love!<br><br>And to get off the sappy note, I guarantee that you will enjoy Percy Jackson. :) </p>

            <p>Yay, shared fandoms! And it does seem like there&#39;s far too much to LOTR to ever know it all even reasonably well. I haven&#39;t even read all of the books, or made it very far into The Silmarillion. <br>Anyway- ooh, my first sword! Shiny! You know, with this, I almost feel like I could conquer entire civilizations, despite having no martial skills whatsoever! Weird, huh? ...I&#39;ll just... keep this carefully sheathed, at least until such time as I decide to realize my goals of world domination.</p>

            <p>Hi, Stripey, and thanks for the chunk!<br>I&#39;m still trying to figure out what my field is going to be. I might have to bounce around the different departments for a while before I settle on one. Oh- you meant my grad school field? I&#39;m going for a Master&#39;s of Social Work, with an emphasis on Marriage and Family Counseling. From what I&#39;ve seen so far, counseling is going to be VERY useful for PPC agents. :)</p>

Also, a sonic screwdriver replica, confiscated from a Sue. It...shoots lightning, I&#39;m afraid; you may want to be careful with the settings. It does look cool, though (blue and green streaks, with random bits of red in the mix), and it does most of the same things as the Doctor&#39;s sonic.<br><br>Hm...Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who, Once Upon a Time, and Queen...I think we&#39;ll get along quite well :)<br><br>Standard Question: Are you planning on writing missions, by any chance?<br><br>Here&#39;s to newbies and good grammar!<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I know the feeling! I must have read at least 200 PPC fics in the past month, as well as spending hours getting lost in the many wiki articles. It really does help; I think I&#39;m nearing a sense of how to competently write missions.<br><br>Sonic Suedriver :D Nice one. I&#39;m sure the fic was horrible. (It&#39;s also non-existent, as far as I know, but it can be one of those legendary missions in one of my agents&#39; backstory. I am QUITE pleased to have never encountered a sonic screwdriver that shot lightning; let&#39;s hope that doesn&#39;t mean that I will sometime in the future...It did nearly become purple in reference to a purple sonic...pen, I think it was, that a character of mine used, but I refrained, since I don&#39;t think the character is *too* Sue-ish. Maybe a few Sue traits, but reasonably flawed and not interfering too much with established canon. Anyway.)<br><br>...Ok, now I&#39;m picturing Agent Dawn ranting about the terrible DW fic where she was nearly fried by lightning from a Sonic Suedriver. I guess that&#39;ll happen at some point. Maybe it can be used in an introduction, or something?<br><br>...I am so out of it. I didn&#39;t actually notice originally that we were both Dawns--I think because you said &#39;Hi, I&#39;m Silky&#39;?--but now that I have, yes! We should definitely team up! *clinks glass* And we are *definitely* and *defiantly* not Breaking. Although I am vaguely thinking of taking on a Twilight badfic, just to see how it turns out (and to watch the agents rant, of course). Sounds like fun. BUT--we should definitely team up at some point post-Permission.<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a deal! We&#39;ll be partners in my first mission. I hope you don&#39;t mind if I bring along a cyborg. (I have a bit of backstory fleshed out.

I&#39;ve never read or watched it (nor do I plan to), but I think I&#39;ve heard enough about the series that I could reasonably take it on.

            <p>Yay! It&#39;ll be fun :) And cyborgs are definitely welcome. The more the merrier!<br><br>I don&#39;t read much (or any, really) Twilight fic at all (except for parodies, which I love), but I had a phase where I liked it (lasted less than a year, thankfully. I think it even lasted less than half a year). I was never obsessed, and came to my senses fairly quickly, but I still read all of the books (except for the last bit of Breaking Dawn, I couldn&#39;t make myself--I was only reading it to know how the story ended, because my friends had requested a fanfic and I needed more information than I had...), and saw maybe half of the first movie. I do hear there&#39;s a wiki to help with details, though, so we should be alright if we decide to take one on.<br><br>And complaining about problems with the fiction and the canon is the fun part! And then--well, I seem to have this thing about embarrassing Agent Dawn--I keep coming up with ideas that bring out these little secrets from her past. It&#39;s...interesting. Especially as these are only ideas so far, since I don&#39;t have permission yet. Anyway, we&#39;ll find a terrible one, and then it&#39;s full speed ahead!<br><br>Geronimo!

            <p>And hopefully not the last!<br><br>That&#39;s nice :) I&#39;m not sure I should make any promises about Agent Dawn, though; she&#39;s generally pretty polite, but...you never know.<br><br>You&#39;d be surprised. I took a quick look on FFN, and while I found some very strange ones*, including a retelling of the first book (I hope it&#39;s just the first book!) with an OC replacing Bella**, they&#39;re not really amazingly bad and perfect sporking material (I think). That is, I think worse ones exist, and would make for a better mission.<br><br>But yes, once we find the badfic, its days are numbered! Up the PPC!<br><br>~DawnFire<br><br>--<br><br>*Such as magical babies that look like the Cullens appearing on their doorstep, amidst a torrent of bad grammar and limited capitalization, bearing with them a letter from an anonymous person stating that they will automatically become vampires when they turn 18, and other such nonsense. The Cullens, of course, take them in, and proceed to be pretty OOC. Which is annoying, because they&#39;re some--well, most--of the only characters that I actually *like* in Twilight.<br><br>**Almost definitely a Sue. She&#39;s just...sort of mild, at least in the first few chapters. Besides replacing Bella--well, honestly, she pretty much just changes some of her personality, if I remember correctly we get a *lot* of insight into Edward&#39;s favorite fruits (which the replacement tastes and smells like...)...Hm, I think I read rather further into this than I thought. She&#39;s also hunting down someone, and her, ahem, relationship (such as it is) with Edward progresses faster than the E/B one. Also comes complete with horribly long and frequent run-on sentences.</p>

            <p>Glad to meet you! Good choice of fandoms, there - don&#39;t know very much about Sailor Moon, or My Little Pony, or Nu-Who for that matter (who&#39;s your favourite Doctor, out of curiosity?) but I just finished watching Firefly for the first time ever last night, so I can bounce up and down excitedly and squee about that. :P And LOTR has been my major fandom of choice for years.<br><br>Have a bag of pebbles and a Random Shiny Object, and welcome to the Board!</p>

            <p>Hi there! My favorite Doctor is #10, which is probably a popular choice, but it&#39;s more because he seemed nicer than the others than anything else. Of course, all of the Doctors have a very special place in my heart.<br>Isn&#39;t Firefly amazing? I&#39;m still struggling to get over the fact that they canceled it.<br>Thanks for the objects!

            <p>Actually, something similar turned out to be my first mission. It was before I got Permission - I sent Gilbert and Fiona along on a BIONICLE mission, despite knowing as much about BIONICLE as I know about astrophysics (so, basically, the name of the fandom). It was fun and educational, and was also great agent- and mission-writing practice! If&#39;n you&#39;d like to do the same sometime, I have Permission now, and I&#39;d be happy to have you tag along! :D</p>

            <p>We might well have to get married now. Or at least work on something together. Something awesome. As for your statue&#39;s enchantment, when you carry it, you feel calm, kind, and can sooth others with some soft words. It will take a strong badfic to bring you down when you hold her. Basically, it&#39;s an aura of kindness.<br><br>My idea for the Once X Ponies is that Trixie or Chrysalis plays the role of Regina, Discord plays Rumpelstiltskin, and either Cadence and Shining Armor as Snow and Charming, or the mane six are trapped in I think high school. The Doctor would have a part in it, and they have to find their way back to Equestria. The town they are stuck in is called Humansville and they have to piece together who they are, where they are from, and how to get back. I thought out the broad idea, but I am just not sure if I&#39;m good enough to do it right. Ah well, now that I have a system of betas, I may well get her written. We&#39;ll see.</p>

            <p>Sounds good! I&#39;d have to bump out my current husband if we were to get married, but we could just make friendship bracelets or something. Or work on something together. That would be great!<br>I like both of these ideas. Cadence and Shining Armor would make a perfect Snow and Charming. Chrysalis almost sounds more like Cora, what with her frequent shapeshifting. And, of course, no one else could be Discord! <br>Let me know if you want to work together on anything, I&#39;m definitely down for it (once I get a few dozen more missions read and acquire the elusive Permission). <sup>.^</sup></p>

            <p>Has anyone ever read a fanfic that was so poorly written you suspected it had to be intentional? I recently ran into this problem with Homestuck High, and a friend and I got in an debate over whether or not it was real. Same applies to *shudder* My Immortal. Thoughts on either of these two/other fandoms that fall in this paradigm?</p>

            <p>I think that usually, fanfics with lovingly described, perfectly beautiful Mary Sues tend to be real (well, most of the time).

            <p>I sort of feel like &#39;Cupcakes&#39; and &#39;Sweet Apple Massacre&#39; were actually meant to get a rise out of the MLP fanbase than as actual stories. &#39;Cupcakes&#39; is just such glaringly obvious gore-porn that I find it hard to believe a true fan of the series would actually write something like that about two of the most beloved characters among the fandom, and &#39;Sweet Apple Massacre&#39; is a trollfic and proud of it - the original author very loudly admitted it was just to tick people off.

Preferably I could use the meeting of Printworthy and Marvin, but I am not sure if it falls under PPC fic or not. If it does, I&#39;ll whip out the other peice. Marvin is a hardcore brony who is practicaly an encyclopedia for canon and popular fanon, and Printworthy is a unicorn author who in his home fic was the author of Daring Do (if you have not seen Read it and Weap yet, you&#39;ll find out what that is then) who wants to protect his home continuum from the atrocities of badfic. They will be in All Purpose, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic devision. Don&#39;t worry, Jumper will come along eventually, I just want to start with these two.<br><br>As for the existance of MLP badfic, I&#39;m sorry to say, it is EVERYWHERE. On the whole, the fanfic writers are actualy pretty good, but you still have your Mary Sue alicorns, Gary Stu humans in Equestria (so much that there is a human in Equestria subsection on FimFiction) and the infamous gluefics. Trust me, Printworthy and Marvin will have plenty to work with. </p>

            <p>I like these agents - anypony who&#39;s an author is cool, and of course, to be paired with a brony. I look forward to reading the missions.<br>I assumed that there would be lots of &quot;Seventh Member of the Mane Six&quot; fics, which actually sound amusing, especially since the agents who tackle them have to either be ponies or disguise themselves as ponies. Hilarity ensues as a human/humanoid agent adjusts to having hooves. It&#39;s the graphic stuff that I just can&#39;t concieve. DO NOT WANT.<br>(I&#39;ll probably read the sporkings anyway, though.)</p>

            <p>I have found that 99.9% of My Immortal look-alikes are glaringly obvious trolls, though I&#39;m doubtful about the original. I&#39;m pretty sure that Thirty H&#39;s was intentional as well, because it actually has some pretty clear grammar, and a friend of mine that has seen some of the author&#39;s other works has said that they&#39;re all equally chaotic. I&#39;m pretty sure it would be pretty hard to make something that bad more than once if it wasn&#39;t intentional.</p>

            <p>The authors of &quot;legolas&quot; and &quot;C*l*br**n&quot; both later came out as trolls, I think. &quot;My Immortal,&quot; of course, is the most famousest of trollfics, and it has a gajillion imitators in other fandoms.<br><br>Then there&#39;s my current sporking project, &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8174397/1/Blood-Raining-Night">Blood Raining Night</a>.&quot; I&#39;ve had several conversations about this one with various people, and we cannot tell for sure. It READS like a troll, but the author has <a href="http://reicheru-ketsueki.deviantart.com/">a deviantART account</a> full of pictures of the OC, not to mention <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ReicheruKetsuekineko/videos">a YouTube account</a> where she&#39;s turning the fic into videos. The quality of everything is pretty terrible, but to me, it still seems like way more effort than you&#39;d expect from a troll. Plus, she seems fairly genuinely clueless in most of the conversations I&#39;ve read between her and her reviewers (some of whom are genuinely trying to help, some of whom are trolls themselves). This one is quite the puzzle! If she IS a troll, she&#39;s the most dedicated one I&#39;ve ever come across. I find it easier to believe she&#39;s just completely obsessed with her OC and oblivious to criticism, constructive or otherwise, but I guess you can decide for yourself.<br><br>Either way, I&#39;m still gonna spork the bejeezus out of it, because the raw material is just too good to pass up. <sup>_<sup><br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

More to the point, Aeldra help my four MSTers. <br><br>This is partly why I didn&#39;t want to MST this behemoth. The other part of the reason was because, as mentioned in the promo, I am a die-hard Vesperia nut and take great offense to people who mess with its canon. Same goes for Assassin&#39;s Creed and what all I&#39;ve learned of Lost Odyssey. The only problem with me MSTing any of those is that I&#39;m still searching for them.

            <p>Hello there.<br><br>I&#39;ve been an on-and-off PPC fan for years (I was introduced via the old GAFF boards, so long ago I can&#39;t remember what alias I was using then), but I&#39;ve never got round to signing up to the Board before.<br><br>I&#39;m an inveterate Tolkien geek, and a fairly committed Discworld fan.  Hobbies include assorted textile stuff (the current obsessions are plant dyes, patchwork, and rug-weaving); cooking, especially expensive, unhealthy dishes; and cool-temperate gardening.  It is just about possible to combine all three: there are a few edible dye-plants that will grow in Britain.  My degree was in Classics, and sufficiently long ago that I&#39;ve forgotten most of my Greek; I can still read Latin, although my composition has always been poor.  If any of that might be helpful to you as fanauthors, drop me a note.<br><br>I haven&#39;t published any fanfic, really: it stays in notebooks for the entertainment of myself and a few victims/friends.  If people think the world needs internal monologues for horses from Kipling poems, or truly urple pastiches, I can probably oblige.<br><br>I don&#39;t have any particular lust objects (unless you count horses I&#39;d really love to ride, and really shiny textile traditions), but I get shirty about gender, sexuality and women&#39;s issues.  Anyone who disses traditional women&#39;s work (ie food, gardening, textiles, or care) in my hearing will get The Lecture.</p>

            <p>Ah.  It&#39;s not the right grammatical formation: you&#39;d want some sort of participle rather than the infinitive for the verb.  You&#39;d also have to decide if the name means she flutters because she&#39;s shy, flutters in a shy manner, is shy about fluttering, or something else, because they&#39;d all need slightly different syntaxes.  Finally, it would probably be a phrase rather than a compound.  Translating MLP into Latin could actually be a really good exercise.</p>

            <p>Hi DawnFire, I think you&#39;re my sort of person too.<br><br>For the weaving, a good starting point is Peter Collingwood&#39;s &quot;The Techniques of Rug-Weaving&quot;.  It focusses on weft-faced rugs, but there&#39;s enough to keep you busy for years; you will need a very sturdy loom that can stand high warp tension.  The book is pretty dense (coming from someone who read an arts degree at Oxford, that&#39;s a significant warning), and available as a free pdf from <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/books.html">www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/books.html</a>  If you get the opportunity, his son Jason is an excellent teacher, and does sometimes travel to the US (if that&#39;s where you&#39;re based).<br><br>Dyeplants are great fun: if you have room to store a seperate set of utensils (don&#39;t use them for food ever again) and a box of mordants, I&#39;d experiment.  Even if you don&#39;t have a garden yourself, lots of weeds and common plants will give you shades of yellow, orange, brown, and drab to play with, and you can buy madder, indigo etc. from specialist suppliers.  I have to add that I do also enjoy using acid dyes, and they&#39;re a lot less hassle!</p>

            <p>I present to you this gift: a virtual durian. Eat it, throw it at Sues, or simply try to touch it with a 10 feet pole, it&#39;s your choice. A fine stink bomb, or the heavenly smell on Earth, no one can decide.<br><br>As an amateur Tolkien fan, I&#39;d like to know, have you read The Silmarillion? I had given Ulmo sharks as his animal, just like Manwe had eagles, long story. Do you think it&#39;s possible?<br><br>Also, I am now a fan of Total Drama too, and had been looking for beta readers. If you&#39;ll help me here, I&#39;ll be glad.</p>

            <p>Hello,<br><br>I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve never even heard of Total Drama, sorry.<br><br>Manwe&#39;s eagles are something pretty special, and exist as well as normal eagles; but we do know that Orome has hunting-dogs that are better than normal animals (Huan is one).  It&#39;s not contradicted in canon that Ulmo might have some friends or allies among relatively normal sea-creatures.  It&#39;s also very possible for minor spirits (maiar, the singular is maia) to take animal form.  The only servants of Ulmo that I can remember are Osse and Uinen (a married couple, described as humanoid: he&#39;s associated with dangerous and stormy coastal waters, and she with gentle, productive seas; note the gender stereotyping!), but he will very likely have other followers too.  (Sorry if you&#39;ve read the Silm. and know all that already: I interpreted your post as meaning you hadn&#39;t, or not recently.)</p>

Shakespeare-style dueling crazy is hilarious :) I only wish my high-school English classes had involved some; it would have made things much more interesting, and possibly helped to dull the frequent butchering of Shakespeare&#39;s plays that went on)<br><br>(On the other hand, my friend and I did laugh ourselves sick when we accidentally added pirates to Hamlet&#39;s &#39;To be or not to be&#39; speech*. That bit was fun. Well, actually, most of Hamlet was fun, but--that&#39;s not my point. Sorry about the rambling)<br><br>*&quot;Aye, there&#39;s the rub&quot; became &quot;Aye, there be the rum&quot;. Don&#39;t ask. It was hilarious at the time, though.<br><br>Anyway, yes, welcome aboard, and enjoy the craziness :)<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

            <p>I love you people!  <br><br>My fondest memories of doing Shakespear at school related to the fact that most of us caught on to the innuendos and dialect rather faster than our teacher (she was definitely Lit not Lang).  You can get a lot of crap past the radar in that situation.</p>

But really, I had...well, higher expectations, at least, and it&#39;s...not very good. At all. I mean, it has its moments, but those moments are stuck in between cliches and mimicking bits of the earlier movies and--honestly, I got the sense that I was watching a fanfic brought to life. I&#39;m not even sure if I want to finish it (I got about halfway through). Does it...does it get any better?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Like the subject line says, help!<br><br>I&#39;m currently chatting (well, FFN PMing) with the author of &#39;The Last Queen of Fangorn&#39; (I&#39;ve copy-pasted the summary and so on from the Claimed Badfic list below, if you&#39;re curious/need to know what I&#39;m on about). She&#39;s quite nice, and friendly, and has now read the books (hurray!). Unfortunately, her newest LotR work is full of issues (rather like her first one). I&#39;m trying to politely point out a few of them, but two examples have already turned into four, and I can keep going for at least ten (and so far I haven&#39;t even touched on grammar). I really don&#39;t want to offend her or make her stop talking to me, (or ruin her day, for that matter) but there&#39;s a lot to cover, and I don&#39;t know how to cover it without ending up sounding mean, overcritical, and impolite.<br><br>In short, I don&#39;t know what to do. Help? Please?<br><br>~DawnFire<br><br>--<br><br>&quot;The Last Queen of Fangorn&quot; (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932895/1/The-Last-Queen-of-Fangorn"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932895/1/The-Last-Queen-of-Fangorn">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7932895/1/The-Last-Queen-of-Fangorn</a></a>) - K+ rated.

            <p>I think a lot of us - myself definitely included - get confused sometimes, about what the point of all this is. Why we do this &quot;PPC&quot; thing, these missions. The mocking, the snarking, the jokes, they&#39;re all to make ourselves laugh at something that would otherwise be annoying or angering.<br><br>The point of concrit is to help the author improve. Nobody spends hours writing a story if they don&#39;t want it to be read, enjoyed. Some authors can take criticism well, some cannot; some are good writers, some or not. But the thing is, if an author cares about their story, and is willing to take criticism, just make it very clear what your intentions are. You don&#39;t want to tear her down, you&#39;re not making fun of her, you want to help her make her story better.<br><br>Intent is not magic, of course. But if you make it clear, it does count for a whole lot with most people.</p>

            <p>If she&#39;s willing to learn and improve, I&#39;d start by making a list of the most egregious canon errors to discuss, especially things that can be altered fairly easily (eg if moving the fic to Mirkwood from Fangorn won&#39;t need any more changes than the name).<br>If she&#39;s not willing to learn and improve, give it up for a lost cause before you get too invested in her.</p>

            <p>I had a problem similar to this on DeviantArt. She hasn&#39;t actually written anything, but she&#39;s drawn the characters and they are <i>very</i> Sue-y. I found out about them through <a href="http://ladydata.deviantart.com/journal/The-Star-Trek-Mary-Sues-Rant-338612870">this</a> journal entry of hers. It gives a pretty good description of why the characters are Sue-y. Then, she posted pictures of her characters and asked for critique, which I gave. Since I don&#39;t think I offended her, here are the conversations I&#39;ve had. Hope they help you have a civil conversation with &quot;ShadowfaxRunner&quot;.<br>The first conversation, on the picture of the primary Sue&#39;s sister : <a href="http://ladydata.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5qzbke"><a href="http://ladydata.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5qzbke">http://ladydata.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5qzbke</a></a><br>The second conversation, on the picture of the Sue&#39;s mother (if this was a fanfic she&#39;d probably be recruitable) : <a href="http://ladydata.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5qz9u8"><a href="http://ladydata.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5qz9u8">http://ladydata.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5qz9u8</a></a><br>And the last conversation, on her forum topic &quot;What is your opinion about OCXCanon fan pairings?&quot; : <a href="http://forum.deviantart.com/art/literature/1824241/"><a href="http://forum.deviantart.com/art/literature/1824241/">http://forum.deviantart.com/art/literature/1824241/</a></a><br><br>My sympathies.

            <p>Maybe you could ask if she&#39;s open to concrit, and make sure she&#39;s aware that&#39;s going to mean pointing out errors along with ways to fix them? Then maybe start with a general thing (e.g. &quot;you&#39;ve got some canon details mixed up&quot;) and see what the reaction is. If she goes &quot;oh, I know, but it&#39;s my story and I can change things if I wanna,&quot; or otherwise doesn&#39;t care, then you&#39;re probably not going to get anywhere. If she&#39;s really interested in fixing things, though, then you can proceed to specific problems.<br><br>That&#39;s just my two cents, though; others might have other ideas.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It <i>has</i> been a while, agreed-- nearly a year since my last mission, surprisingly enough --thanks to school and work. As for Lee&#39;s world, I do have more to it, actually. I wrote both last year and this year&#39;s NaNoWriMo in that &#39;Verse. Those stories take place about two hundred years before this one; thank goodness for long-lived fantasy races. I&#39;d be more than willing to share last year&#39;s NaNo as a GDoc or PDF if anyone&#39;s interested, given that I&#39;m still editing this year&#39;s.<br><br>As a point of interest, Lee&#39;s grandparents are around three hundred years old, her mother about one hundred and fifty, and Lee obviously is 26 (or so, what with the vagaries of HQ).</p>

            <p>Each November, there&#39;s a challenge to write at least 50,000 words of an original novel/collection of works/poems, etc. It goes from the first to the thirtieth. This past November was the fourth time I finished within the time limit.</p>

            <p>I did it for the first time this November! I&#39;m going to start revising soon, and I think I&#39;ll try to post it as an online serial novel.<br><br>Mostly, you just write whatever comes into your head. Don&#39;t edit as you go except for the tiny mistakes in spelling and grammar (and not even then, sometimes). Also, try not to fall behind - I did twice, and I spent the last week or so writing 2500 words per day.<br><br>I also had Sergio Turbo and Desdendelle reading as I wrote, and I know that at least one part of the story that I REALLY like came because I asked Sergio about whether or not touse a certain plot point at a certain time (I don&#39;t really plan out my stories in advance). He thought I should wait, and  and it turned out much better because I did. So getting someone to read it as you go works too - plus you have the incentive of not letting them down (something similar was tossed up in the Pep Talk emails.)<br><br>Don&#39;t get discouraged if one day you just can&#39;t write anything. Try working on a different thing for a bit, see if that helps. Read a goodfic, bake some cookies, go for a walk. </p>

            <p>It can actually be done in two weeks, if you don&#39;t mind burning yourself out from fiction for the next half year or so.<br><br>The basic rule is to just keep writing, come hell or high water. Last time (2011) I was lucky enough to have a run of very quiet night shifts with computer access - I was hitting roughly 3000 words a night. The first time I did it (2009) I was unemployed, so again, lots of time.<br><br>I don&#39;t know yet if it can be done with a full workload. But even at a ludicrously-slow ten words a minute, you only need to write two hours a day...<br><br>... every day until you finish. That&#39;s the hard part. Oh, and don&#39;t edit. My wife used to write hers in white font to keep from going back over it. :P<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>1) Don&#39;t be afraid to write. Often times, ideas may seem stupid to you, or you might be afraid your readers won&#39;t like it. That&#39;s okay; use it anyways. November&#39;s just for writing. You&#39;ve got the rest of your life to edit.<br><br>2) On that note, NEVER LISTEN TO YOUR INNER EDITOR DURING NOVEMBER. The urge to edit as you go is very, very tempting, but it&#39;ll only waste precious time.<br><br>3) Try to get at least the minimum word count each day. 1,667 words seems like quite a bit, but often times it can pass by relatively quickly. I tend to world-build a lot, so descriptive paragraphs have saved my bacon more than once.<br><br>4) Keep a notebook/journal/notepad/whatever on you at all times. Inspiration strikes at the weirdest of places and times, so being prepared helps get ideas down, even if it&#39;s just a short description of a place or a character idea. I keep a small journal in my purse and a notebook by my bed, just in case. Also, writing utensils: get used to having many of them nearby at all times.<br><br>5) Sometimes, your characters will go places and do things you weren&#39;t expecting. That&#39;s fine; in fact, it often leads to ideas you hadn&#39;t thought of that further the story and make it more interesting. A story is a tapestry of various events and ideas; let them flow as they come.<br><br>6) Plan ahead. This is actually encouraged by the Office of Letters and Light (the very awesome people who run NaNo). Write down character bios. Sketch places. Take pictures of things that interest you or inspire you. Write down outlines of scenes that pop into your head.<br><br>7) Try to go to at least one write-in that&#39;s being hosted in your area. Chances are, there&#39;ll be one, or, most likely, several, at various bookshops, libraries, and schools. The NaNo Forums are a great place to hook up with people in your area. Getting live feedback is a great motivator.<br><br>8) Get to know your characters. Why do they do the things they do? What&#39;re their backgrounds? How much of them do you want to show the reader, and how much do you want to keep for yourself? Remember, not knowing everything often leads to keeping the reading wanting to know more about the characters, so dole out bits and pieces here and there to whet their appetites and keep them coming back for more.<br><br>9) Listen to your heart, not your head. Your head is full of boring things like work, school, and all the mundanities of life. Your heart, on the other hand, is where the dreams live and where your story can really take root. If you&#39;re excited about your story, chances are your readers will be as well.<br><br>10) Don&#39;t be afraid to <strike>steal</strike> borrow inspiration. Every great artist copies someone else at one point or another; why do you think so many of us got our start writing fanfiction? If an idea strikes you as interesting, note it down and then see how you can add your own personal spin on it. Don&#39;t be afraid to play around with established tropes and ideas. They&#39;ve been around for a long time, so no one&#39;s going to yell if you use them. Just look at the amount of vampire and werewolf-related stuff for young adults that came out after <i>Twilight</i> hit the shelves.</p>

            <p>And I&#39;d like to add that it&#39;s only February, the Hobbit movie came out in December, and it takes time to write a good mission. Even if someone&#39;s working on one, it might not be done yet. Patience, my friend. :)<br>Also, Tolkienverse might not be where we want to send our agents. I plan to work in the Star Trek division. That&#39;s okay. We spork what we want to spork. Someone will probably want to spork Hobbit badfic, but for some people like me it isn&#39;t our top priority.<br>Lastly, if you&#39;re new, welcome!
