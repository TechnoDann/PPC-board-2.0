            <p>. . . real-world minis a while back?  Well, I&#39;ve spent the afternoon on the Wayback Machine, and it turns out the ancient oldbies beat us to it by nearly a decade! PPC author Elvealauregaladriel Aure made a list:<br><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040816120729/http://elvea-aure.0catch.com/ppc/minithespians.htm"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040816120729/http://elvea-aure.0catch.com/ppc/minithespians.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20040816120729/http://elvea-aure.0catch.com/ppc/minithespians.htm</a></a><br><br>At least, with regard to real world actors.  Mini-Thespian, anyone?  Although it sounds like Elvea Aure found these minis from a random internet trawl, so they probably don&#39;t &quot;count&quot; by today&#39;s standards anyway.</p>

            <p>Today, while I was typing up an essay for school, one of my... er, what&#39;s it called? Those buttons on the keyboard on a laptop? Well, whatever it&#39;s called, one of them fell off my laptop, and I have no idea how to reattach it. If someone has any advice on this, I would be very happy indeed, as it&#39;s one of the arrow keys, and I have no idea how to scroll on a trackpad, so I can&#39;t scroll very well at the moment.<br>So... if anyone has any idea how to put this thing back on (or a substitute to scrolling without a trackpad, mouse and a broken key), I would be very grateful indeed for a helping hand.</p>

            <p>though like Desdendelle said, it depends on what computer you have. I know that on <i>my</i> laptop, the cover for the &#39;x&#39; key occasionally pops off because the cover for the &#39;z&#39; is totally gone, thus affecting the &#39;x&#39; key( but it still works since it&#39;s pressure sensitive and all that). The key-cover has a little plastic doohickey on the back that snaps down into place over the actual button for the key.<br><br>As for scrolling on a track pad, try going along the right-hand side of it with one finger. That&#39;s usually where they put the scroll function for PCs. Also, you can use the &#39;page up&#39; and &#39;page down&#39; keys if you absolutely need to. It&#39;s clunky, but it&#39;s there.</p>

            <p>As some of you know, I don&#39;t just belong to the PPC. I also am part of other fanfic-related groups.<br><br>I was thinking about a fanfiction I had read a while back. It was in PJO and was set in an apocolyptic-type world where Sues had killed off most of the gods and OCs, so the fanfic writers created a group of people to stop it.<br>I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t find this great story, but if you do a search for &#39;Mary-Sue&#39; on the Pit under Percy Jackson, there might be one called &#39;the Perfect Sue Hunter&#39; or something like that. As quoted in the fic, it takes a Sue to kill a Sue.<br><br>My first point is, is there such thing as an Anti Sue in the PPC? A Sue that is really ugly in an attepmt to make her less Suvian, but a Sue nonetheless? You may call it by a different name.<br>Another thing. Is there one big Sue that controls all of the Sues and Stus?<br>Does anyone know what a Mary Xu is, without Googling it?<br>My last little query is: I know there&#39;s a lot of parody Sue stories out there. What happns to those Sues? Are they left in the continumn to mess up th plot parodically, or are they killed normally by the PPC?<br><br>I hope I raised some interesting issues here.</p>

<p><span><span>The PPC deals with two types pf "Anti-sue". The first one seems to be what you're describing, the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/PlayingWith/AntiSue">TVTropes-defined antiSue</a>. Since these are often just as bad as "classic" Sues, we kill them just the same- if one isn't bad, then it's just an OC who doesn't need PPC attention. The other type is a "reformed" Sue- they could have been any “flavor” of Mary Sue or Marty Stu originally, but they've seen the light and renounced the use of their abilities. Some Agents are reformed Sues.</span></span></p> </li>
<li>
<p><span><span>You may be looking for the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/League_of_Mary_Sue_Factories">League of Mary Sue Factories</a> or the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mysterious_Somebody">Mysterious Somebody</a>.</span></span></p> </li>
<li>
<p><span><span>Is it anything like a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaryTzu">Marty Tzu</a>?</span></span></p> </li>
<li>
<p><span><span>We have a Department of Bad Parody. If the Parody isn't Bad, it is considered goodfic, and is left alone to bolster the canon. I always liked to think that the canon characters in good parodies (and the OCs) know they are in a parody, are playing along, and are as amused as everyone else.</span></span></p> </li>

            <p>Some years ago, I started to play WoW, because I wondered what all my friends’ sons were so excited about (my daughter was more interested in <i>The Sims</i> then). I only played as long as I didn’t need to pay for it, so I couldn’t really explore much of this world, but I’m still considering to start again when I have more time, probably meaning when I’m retired from my job :-)<br><br>So, repeating and expanding on questions from my introductory post you missed:<br><br>Will we ever see a third chapter of OFUA? <br>I totally understand when this doesn’t happen soon or ever, for technical or other reasons.<br><br>Are applications still open? <br>I would really like to know what you would have done to my alter ego if I had applied in time.<br><br>Don’t you get into trouble for interactivity when students apply via comments? <br>Well, if this is true, it’s probably too late to do anything about it. Also, I don’t have an account on ff.net, but I think I could comment anyway?<br><br>Can I simply apply here? <br>I’m the “bored old man”, who never found the Plaguelands, and as far as I know you still didn’t get this kind of student.</p>

            <p>Hello! To answer your questions:<br><br>1. OFUA is on hold until I get a new computer, because I don&#39;t want to mess around with the chapters on my phone right now. Before the computer died, it was on hold due to an incident with one of the applicants; they won&#39;t be appearing in the story, but I didn&#39;t quite make that decision in time to get the next chapter written. ^^;<br><br>2. You can totally still apply--the more the merrier! The only problem is that my phone won&#39;t let me on FF.net at the moment--I think it&#39;s getting old and fussy like my computer was--so I can&#39;t get it there. I do have an account on Archive Of Our Own now, though, and plan to permanently move the story there. I&#39;ll post a link on the Board when I do.<br><br>3. ...I didn&#39;t know! I&#39;m so sorry! No one told me I wasn&#39;t supposed to talk to the students! -flails-</p>

            <p>Took me a few seconds for that to sink in.  :P  Like I said, I&#39;m only a casual fan of the lore.  Haven&#39;t played any of the games, although I&#39;ve got plenty of the books.  I&#39;m keeping track of the WoW cinematics at the least, though, and I do indeed know the gist of what goes down during patch 5.4.</p>

            <p>I thought of this a while ago. A pair of agents coming home from a mission discover that they inadvertently brought Pinkie Pie home with them. Wary of the consequences, one agent brings in Princess Azula or one of the Nazgul to help hunt her down and return her to Equestria. This, of course, backfires spectacularly. The agent tries to bring in someone even ˆmoreˆ powerful, and it happens over and over again, until HQ is caught in a multi-canon crossfire.<br>Of course, there are many ways that this could be done better. But that&#39;s what I have right now.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to have to agree with Techno-Dann here (albeit in a somewhat more vehement fashion). This does not strike me as being a good idea, in large part because it doesn&#39;t make sense considering the structure of the PPC and what the PPC does. <br><br>If a canon were to get loose in HQ, then the Department of External Security would likely step in and take down (in a non-lethal sense, of course) the renegade character. If not them, then there are hypothetically hundreds of well-trained agents who could deal with the situation as well. Bringing in more dangerous canons in an attempt to capture the rogue would be phenomenally ridiculous considering all that.<br><br>Even with that taken into consideration, I have to ask: why Azula? Why a Nazgul? Why two nigh-uncontrollable villains? If you were to bring another canon in, why not an individual who is an accomplished hunter/trapper? Someone like Mustrum Ridcully (<i>Discworld</i>) or Sir Hammerlock (<i>Borderlands 2</i>). Not only are they good at what they do, they&#39;re also relatively benign -- especially in comparison to the unhinged Azula or the Ring-bound Nazgul.<br><br>Finally, PPC stories -- and HQ stories in particular -- are not about canons. They&#39;re about our agents, and how they live and work and react to badfic. This idea seems to be focused on the antics of the canonical characters and this ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny. Where do the agents fit into that picture, besides as the well-meaning dolts who cause the problem in the first place?<br><br>I don&#39;t mean to sound like I&#39;m being mean or spiteful, I&#39;m just trying to explain why your idea doesn&#39;t fit in regards to what the PPC is all about. I apologize if I seem overly brusque in my explanation.</p>

            <p>Like I said, this is a very rudimentary idea. I&#39;ve been gradually fleshing it out, and playing around with the idea of writing it. If I did truly intend to write it, I would have a lot more points written out when I made the original post.<br><br>In answer to your DES point, Pinkie Pie is not only an unpredictable cloudcuckoolander with a party cannon, but she also possesses something called a &quot;Pinkie Sense&quot; and has displayed a stereotypical cartoon character ability to show up and disappear randomly. This would not make it easy to catch her, although I admit it would be a little easier to just throw a party.<br><br>In answer to the nigh-uncontrolable villain point, the agent I was thinking of would not be, in the common vernacular, a &quot;genius.&quot; The thought process would go something like this: Hmm, I must hunt down Pinkie Pie. Hunt. Hunt. Hunt... Hey, the Nazgul can hunt, can&#39;t they?<br><br>With regard to the final point, this story is not meant to be about the antics of the canons. It is meant to focus on the agents, who are attempting to stop those antics, get the canons home, or at least slow them down enough for security to arrive.<br><br>Thank you again for pointing these very good points out. I hope this answers your concerns satisfactorily.</p>

            <p>I could see it working somewhat under different sircumstances. Instead of hunting for canons with other canons, I&#39;m thinking of some kind of &quot;leak&quot; where canons are coming in from somewhere by accident. Maybe the more powerful ones are more likely to break through for some reason?<br><br>But I do agree- while a good writer could no doubt make it work, the idea is somewhat tangential to what the PPC actually does.</p>

            <p>But I&#39;m not sure what the leap in logic would be between the examples given. What is it about Azula that would make her a prime Pinkie Pie hunter? Even more so for the Nazgul, who don&#39;t really seem equipped for tracking something outside the scope of their Ring-based abilities any more than a normal person would be. And good luck trying to keep its fell-beast steed under control outside of Sauron&#39;s range.<br><br>The basic idea you mentioned for creatures leaking through into HQ is actually something I&#39;ve been trying to work with for the DMFF. No canon character response teams, because that would be counter-productive at best, but there would be DMFF agents responsible for containing the infestation and sending the interlopers back. I&#39;m not done with even the planning stages of that possibility yet, though, for the dual reasons of no Permission and a lack of good creatures to feature that wouldn&#39;t just act out the same scenario over and over.<br><br>Individual canon characters breaking through, though, I don&#39;t think so. Like PoorCynic said, we don&#39;t want antics of canons eclipsing the PPC characters.</p>

            <p>First, I would like to apologize to Neshomeh for getting stuck in a rut last weekend (please let me know if I spelled that name that correctly).  <br><br>Now onto the good stuff.  <br><br>I was still thinking about what people would like to see in &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot;.  Continuing with my Tempting Fate idea, I read on the LOTR Wiki that in the second installment Gloin will have miniature showing portraits of his wife and son.  I would like to see him drop it while in Thranduil&#39;s halls, and then see Legolas pick it up and start laughing at the portraits or something.  Just something to foreshadow Legolas&#39;s later friendship with Gimli.  <br><br>It would also be interesting to see what Legolas&#39;s relationship with his father is like.  We don&#39;t see it at all in the books, so it be interesting to see what it would look like.  One thing is for sure: It won&#39;t look like what we see in some of the more ridiculous badfics. <br><br>I would also like to see more of the poems.  I loved hearing &quot;Chip the Glasses&quot; in the previous installment (that one is a personal favorite).  <br><br>Give me your thoughts on the next &quot;Hobbit&quot; film.  </p>

            <p>Most of the time Rivendell elves would be singing in Sindarin, of course, but a) they sometimes sing hymns in High Elven, b) Sindarin has a smaller vocabulary and less developed grammar, making it more difficult to work with, and c) I just don&#39;t like it as much.<br><br>The verse being translated is the one Dawn posted, but has had to be slightly tweaked to make use of the vocab<br><br><i>O!

However, since -esse is the locative suffix (that is, &#39;in&#39;), and &#39;pel-&#39; is halfway to being <i>peler</i>, &#39;fenced field&#39;, it can also be read as a slurred &#39;Between-een the fences!&#39;.

            <p>Hey PPC<br><br>Whilst suffering from writers block I&#39;ve been reading through quite a few Harry Potter fanfics. Whilst reading through them I noticed several that had somewhere in the summary something along the lines of &quot;Harry will use his Slytherin side more&quot; and that got me thinking. Whilst I&#39;ll admit that it&#39;s been a small while since I&#39;ve read the Harry Potter books I don&#39;t particularly remember Harry using what I would call his &quot;Slytherin side&quot; at all. Is this just a Fanon phrase then or is there some canon proof behind Harry having this sort of side? And if this is just a Fanon phrase could it be tweaked slightly to become a charge in Harry Potter missions in the future or does it exist as/in a charge already?<br><br>I will leave the PPC to its pondering.<br><br>Storme Hawk   </p>

            <p>Harry, like any well-rounded character, does have some evil tendencies. He keeps them under good control, but he does. Most of his Slytherin-ish traits are the more neutral ones, though.<br><br>His time with the Dursleys left him with little respect for authority or for Muggles in general. Because Harry is a generally decent person, he will respect authority figures who prove their trustworthiness, and he will risk his life for a Muggle like Dudley when necessary. But he certainly does a lot of sneaking around, probably more than he needs to do.<br><br>He has a temper. If he&#39;s angry, he&#39;ll let you have it. Most of the time, Harry gets angry at people who deserve it, but his friends get caught in the crossfire too, like when he smashed up Dumbledore&#39;s office after Sirius died. And he&#39;ll often create a fight where there doesn&#39;t need to be one, because he is too proud to back down from a challenge.<br><br>Harry is also quite ambitious. Becoming an Auror is a difficult goal and Harry initially states that as his career plan mostly to mess with Umbridge. That same ambition lets him take on challenges that are much more than any person his age should be expected to conquer, without more than occasional doubts as to whether he is up to the task.<br><br>He can be pretty sneaky when he needs to be. Hiding a brewing Polyjuice potion, convincing Ron that he&#39;s sneaked him good-luck potion, spending all that time under the invisibility cloak, using secret passages, etc. He had good reasons for most of those things, but he did choose the sneaky method rather than the straightforward charge-into-battle Gryffindor style.<br><br>And of course, he&#39;s a Parselmouth who&#39;s got a bit of Voldemort in him. That, too.<br><br>I always thought it was a bit of a pity that we never got to see more of the non-evil Slytherins. It doesn&#39;t make much sense that fully a quarter of all wizards are evil wizards. Slytherin can mean sneaky, ambitious, proud, competitive. There are probably good Slytherins. Except, for the most part, they didn&#39;t come into the story much--Harry probably never thought too much about getting to know them.</p>

            <p>Having a temper and creating a fight where there doesn&#39;t need to be one seem (at least to me) to be the bad sides of Gryffindors’ daring and nerve rather than Harry’s Slytherin side.<br><br>But sneaking around, making Ron believe that he drank Felix Felicis, or blackmailing Vernon Dursley to make him sign the Hogsmeade permission are definitely not the Gryffindor way. So there is canon evidence for Harry behaving like we would expect from a Slytherin.<br><br>Millicent Bulstrode is a good Slytherin.

            <p>Hufflepuff, actually.<br><br>Think about it. Hufflepuff may not be flashy, but they&#39;re noted for accepting anyone. The values they are most associated with are loyalty, kindness, perseverance, equality, patience, and fairness. Their only downside is that they are not high-profile--but that&#39;s the thing, the Hufflepuffs don&#39;t care about being high-profile. They&#39;re just going to go right on being quietly nice people, and thanks to their persistence, they&#39;re not going to stop being nice when things get rough.<br><br>Gryffindors may be the ones that charge into battle, but Hufflepuffs are the ones who go into no-man&#39;s land to rescue the wounded--and they probably don&#39;t even think of themselves as particularly brave for it, because they aren&#39;t really thinking of their own safety at all. There&#39;s a job to do and they&#39;re going to do it.<br><br>They have a reputation for low ability, but maybe that&#39;s just because they don&#39;t really care about self-promotion. A Hufflepuff who had a lot of intelligence wouldn&#39;t think to crow about it, wouldn&#39;t mind if someone else took credit for his discoveries. Cedric certainly wasn&#39;t a bad wizard.</p>

            <p>One of the things I do like to write about whenever I do anything with the Harry Potter stuff is non-evil Slytherins. As you said, cunning, ambitious, sly - none of these mean &quot;evil&quot;.<br><br>I would make one point about what you said: &quot;His time with the Dursleys left him with little respect for authority or for Muggles in general.&quot; Harry has never shown dislike of or disrespect for Muggles in general. He doesn&#39;t pay as much attention to them for most of the series, because he&#39;s in the wizarding world and therefore barely interacts with them, but he respects them as people.</p>

            <p>... that given Gryffindor is identified as, what, &#39;brave&#39; or &#39;corageous&#39;, and Slytherin as <s>&#39;evil&#39;</s>, er... something like &#39;cunning&#39; or &#39;sly&#39;, that it means Harry <s>actually starts thinking for once</s> acts... you know... more like that.

            <p>As has been mentioned before, the Sorting Hat almost put Harry into Slytherin. Furthermore, let&#39;s not forget that Harry is a Parselmouth. I&#39;m guessing that that is what is being alluded to by his &quot;Slytherin side.&quot;</p>

            <p>...that it&#39;s just people using a phrase they think sounds cool to describe Harry behaving in a way other than the Gryffindor stereotype. I&#39;m not that active in the Harry Potter fandom, so I can&#39;t say for sure, but that&#39;s what it sounds like to me.<br><br>It probably originated from the fact that the Sorting Hat said he might do well in Slytherin, and Slytherin has been stereotyped as the &quot;bad guys&quot; of the Wizarding World. In other words, Harry does something morally questionable? Clearly it&#39;s his &quot;Slytherin side.&quot;<br><br>What do other people think?</p>

            <p>The Sorting Hat wanted to put him in Slytherin, and the fans likely interpreted that as &quot;Harry has repressed Slytherin qualities!&quot; or something like that, rather than &quot;the Sorting Hat noticed Harry was part Voldemort and decided to roll with it&quot;.  While I&#39;m still doubtful about my skill at deducing what is or isn&#39;t a charge, I&#39;d guess that yes, making this sort of mistake would indeed be charge-worthy.</p>

            <p>Any idea why these tests rank video game characters so highly? I ran some random ones through just now, and Gordon Freeman scored 53%, John-117 scored 42% (including actions he took in the expanded universe), Pre-Other-M Samus scored 43% (Post-Other-M Samus scored an unbelievable 112%!!), and Jak/Mar scored 45%.<br><br>I suspect it&#39;s because video games usually aren&#39;t fun unless you&#39;re more powerful in some way than 90% of the mooks you run into (otherwise the game would be all boss battles, and the pacing would be terrible), and the character is actively being controlled by the player.</p>

            <p>The thing with this test is that it detects character traits as opposed to actions. <br><br>What I mean by this is that Sir Large McHuge, suave young attractive philanthropist playboy multibillionaire, owner of a multinational high-tech product empire, and secret fighter of crime would be flagged as an enormous Suvian by the test you linked.<br><br>I&#39;ve also described Tony Stark, aka the Iron Man (though my knowledge of the actual character is limited to <i>The Avengers</i> and the first <i>Iron Man</i> movie).

            <p>I have used that test for characters as a way to try to figure out whether they have too many speshul traits. Cluttering up a character like that makes them (ironically) less interesting, so it can be quite helpful to answer those questions. My characters usually get somewhere from 10-25; the higher-powered characters do test in the low Mary-Sue range; the highest, an Abyssal Exalted character I played in a tabletop game, scored a 28. Exalted has a very high power level, and Abyssals by definition have a tragic past. And yet I don&#39;t think he was a Gary Stu. Yeah, he had the big sword and the necromantic power, he did save the world a couple of times, and he did manage to complete a nice little redemption arc (which is near impossible for Abyssals, considering their brains are basically linked to eldritch abominations)... but on the other hand, he started out as honestly cowardly (though he didn&#39;t stay that way), spent most of the game looking more like a living mummy than a glamorous vampire, and got manipulated by pretty much every ancient evil in the game until he finally broke free (and died shortly thereafter, because you don&#39;t flip the bird to the Neverborn without serious consequences).<br><br>So yeah, I think it&#39;s a useful tool, but you do have to look at the setting and the character&#39;s personality. If you&#39;re writing a high-powered character, and the character needs all of those powers to make the story work, you might ping as Mary Sue even though the character is an engaging, interesting character. Some Mary Sues don&#39;t show up as Mary Sues on the test simply because they&#39;re low-power self-inserts with little personality, who don&#39;t disturb the canon much but don&#39;t add anything to it either.<br><br>In-universe, Mary-Sue litmus tests are represented by litmus paper, which works like ordinary litmus paper except that it measures glitter level instead of pH. It has a tendency to burst into flames when a particularly bad Sue is around, but at least your agents won&#39;t destroy yet another CAD.</p>

            <p>Most of the half-beast questions, for instance, I would have had to check had I followed the letter of the test, but since my character&#39;s at home in the Star Fox verse (where everyone&#39;s a furry) I decided to leave them blank.<br><br>One question that I still haven&#39;t found an answer for is the following: Does the main character&#39;s love interest who was rather focal to the plot count as major character if said plot took place in an alternate universe that was abandoned via canon reboot and never mentioned since?<br>If that is so then yes, my Michael&#39;s scheduled for romance with a major character and his sueishness rating will go up a bit (from a current 11-ish.)</p>

            <p>Just romancing a character who is no longer around probably doesn&#39;t count, provided that said character actually does their own job and was not brought back just to be a love interest.<br><br>It would be suish if it seemed like (in or out of universe!) the reason for the LI&#39;s return was because (s)he is an LI for Michael (although, as with many Sue behaviors, a competant writer can sometimes get away with it and make it seem at least in character if not outright justified). If the character does other stuff unrelated to that, and is recognized for such, then I&#39;m sure it would be fine.</p>

            <p>My attempt involves merging canon lines as the main character changes love interests in between continuities and installments, freeing up his old love interest.<br><br><br>In timeline form: He meets the oldcanon!LI at a point at which he is presumably available in the new continuity.

            <p>I think that works very well from the Stu/Sue angle. There are a few other things to think of, though, although some of them are fairly elementary.<br><br>I&#39;d very much like for the LI character to do other things in between the relationship-building points described here (can&#39;t tell if that&#39;s already planned). I (and probably most readers) prefer characters who go about their business and develop attatchments to each other on the side, as opposed to the relationship being at the core of the plot. When a character is put in place who does not appear except in their role as LI, that&#39;s usually my signal to put the book down.<br><br><br>There&#39;s also the damsel-in-distress/faux-action-girl/stay-in-the-kitchen component to keep in mind. It likely won&#39;t be obvious since you seem like a competant writer, but if I were writing the story I&#39;d make it an obvious aversion: either she runs off on her own and SUCCEEDS in whatever it was she was doing dispite the risk, or runs into a dangerous situation that even both of them together can&#39;t face head on, and while Michael is sensible enough to want to retreat, she&#39;s still Leeroying and has to be talked down.</p>

            <p>1) Wartime story. There&#39;ll always be a lot more important stuff to do than getting together while still leaving enough opportunity to put <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionFilmQuietDramaScene">those</a> in.<br><br>Not to mention, there&#39;s four other original characters I&#39;ve put in and I intend them to be more than just setpieces.<br>Well, one - the half-jerk pilot whose sole reason for desertion in the first place was the better pay freelancing would offer - still needs some working on, think I&#39;ll be giving him a family or at least some ethics.<br><br><br>2) In her canonical appearance she was about eighteen, probably had been rushed through pilot training and nepotism&#39;d into the position of Chief Test Pilot at her father&#39;s monolithic corporation. First real combat action on the ground: Getting kidnapped and held at gunpoint. In the air? Going up against a cruiser by herself. Result? Reality ensued in both cases, fortunately aid was at hand.<br><br>The fic takes place nine years after that. She&#39;s probably had plenty of time to practice, however her parents are still likely (and justifiably) displeased by the idea of letting her enter actual combat.<br><br><br>Dangerous situation they can&#39;t face head-on without support?<br>Hmmmm...<br>Large creature, capable of space travel and ranged attack. Intelligent.<br>Canonically stated to have nearly completely destroyed an entire fleet seventeen years before the story takes place.<br>Canonically defeated only by a most excellent pilot aided by his team, all armed with state-of-the-art weaponry.<br><br>Speaking of which, said weaponry was developed by the corporation the LI works for. Similar designs were likely also created by the military; it is likely Michael&#39;s team is in possession of a few. His piloting skills are entirely simulation-based, however.<br>One of these creatures should suffice to make the odds seem overwhelming to the realist&#39;s eye and challenging to the overconfident. Now I&#39;ll have to read up on dogfighting tactics.<br><br>As for the success option, let&#39;s have her face a wing of assault bombers - their anti-fighter weapons are relatively powerful, but easy to avoid by a skilled pilot. The LI would definitely beat the OC there. He might actually end up getting saved by her instead.</p>

            <p>Uh.....What to put here...<br>Hi. I&#39;m ChibiChen, fan fiction writer, gamer, Rp&#39;er.<br>I&#39;ll probably add to that list later.<br><br>Following the handy dandy guide of the &#39;Newbie FAQ&#39;,<br><br>I&#39;m in the process of reading all the readings given to me by the PPC guides. I&#39;m about halfway through the Original series, and I finished the constitution. There is more than I could name, so If Anything is In dire need of a read by me, please give me the heads up!<br><br>I like to consider myself in the Touhou fandom, first and foremost. After that, I enjoy Call of Duty, Megaman, The Dept. Heaven series, Wheel of Time, and a lot of other things I can&#39;t remember right now. (Please don&#39;t hate me for any of these fandoms. I&#39;ll try not to be part of the Fandumb.)<br><br>I found the PPC through TvTropes*, and I found it very interesting. The stories drew me in, and kept me around long enough to build up the courage to post.<br><br>I haven&#39;t read many of the spin-offs yet, so I don&#39;t feel comfortable saying one or another is my &#39;favorite&#39;. Some day I will, but not today.<br><br>As I said before, I dabble in writing, I play games, I rp and I collaborate with friends in other groups. When I go away from the comp, I tend to swim, read books (Please suggest a new book! I finished Wheel of Time recently and have been looking for something worth reading), or cook.<br><br>In the fun fact section, I&#39;m a dude, and I&#39;m currently in collage trying to major in Psychology. Whether that will stand the test of time and the working world is to be seen. <br><br>*<i>I am in no way responsible for any lost time due to the mention of TvTropes. View at own risk.</i></p>

            <p>So, a gamer in the Touhou fandom! Nice.<br><br>Welcome to the PPC! Being a Pokemon fan, I&#39;d usually rummage about my trusty bag of holding (you should see the assorted things I&#39;ve been able to pull out of it), but for you, have some links to some of my favorite Touhou-related music:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1E2nN5Fwzk">Danzai Yamaxanadu</a>, and what I dub the &quot;⑨ Destiny series&quot; (and no, I did not make any of them):<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUBbigtfCWs">Kero ⑨ Destiny</a>,<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8OWSlqz1h4"> ⑨ Destiny - It&#39;s Always Cirno&#39;s Turn</a>,<br>and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tzmFOIGqjI&amp;fmt=18">a mashup of the two themes</a>.<br><br>And before you ask, no, I&#39;ve never played Touhou. I&#39;ve heard of it through some Let&#39;s Player that I&#39;ve watched--I believe that &quot;Shagg&quot; (&quot;kuposan4&quot; on YouTube) is the culprit.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Spectrum_of_Suvian_Species">Spectrum of Suvian Species</a> will probably be of at least some help, as it&#39;s got a collection of the basic Sue-types and their relative levels of potential power. It&#39;s got an odd way of organizing its information, though. For example, it claims that any Gary Stu is inherently more powerful than a Sue-wraith, when that is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sue-wraith#Higher-Order_Wraiths">most certainly not the case</a>, and conflates some Suvian archetypes with power levels, which would imply that any Sue in that archetype shares that power level, when that is also not the case.<br><br>Either way, it could work at least as a relative list and scale. Plus, that second link takes you to a list of higher-order wraiths, in case you needed more species of badfic nasties to throw around. Higher-order wraiths are <i>nasty</i> creatures, though, and tend to serve their own purposes more than anyone else&#39;s, so if you want to include some, use them sparingly.</p>

            <p>I am speaking, of course, of the glorious month of November, that shining, sleep-deprived, caffeinated, frantic scrabbling word-laden epoch we call <s>inter</s>National Novel Writing Month, when we all trade in our sanity (or what remains of it) for the pursuit of novel-writing, and the quest to put 50,000 words together in something resembling a novel in just 30 days.<br><br>In other/fewer words: it&#39;s <a href="http://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>!<br><br>Are you planning to do it this year? If so, do you have a plot? Or anything vaguely resembling a plan? Have you done it before? Have you ever won? Have you anything like words of wisdom or folly for those of us crazy enough to be throwing our hats in this year?<br><br>For my part, I&#39;ll be participating this year - it&#39;s been enough years that November would feel just a bit empty if I didn&#39;t. I managed to pull off the full fifty thousand for the first time last year, though the finished work was not something I&#39;d bother committing to a physical page. This year, I&#39;ve got a new plan involving the peaking and downfall of a pre- Ice Age civilization that evolves, or devolves, into the species we now know as crows. <br><br>I have, over the past five years or so of my life, become a follower of the writing advice of the inhumanly amazing Neil Gaiman, which usually boils down to this: keep writing, even when - especially when - it would be easier not to. <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2013/nanowrimo.org/pep/neil-gaiman">This</a> was his pep talk a few years back.<br><br>And, lastly, sorry I&#39;ve not been around much. I was rather busy the past few weeks, then went back to the east coast to visit family, during which journey my laptop screen cracked. So I&#39;ll be trying to fix that, as well, in the next few weeks. I shall be intermittently poking about here and in the IRC in the meantime.</p>

            <p>My deepest sympathies - and, as an aside, you might consider writing it out longhand and transcribing it with a library or school computer. If I can&#39;t find a new screen for my laptop in the next month, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be doing. It&#39;s somewhat more time-consuming, but it gives you an interesting set of drafts as well.</p>

            <p>I have not decided if I am going to give it a go this year.  I don&#39;t particularly have anything going on during November, just don&#39;t know if I want to go for the 50k.<br><br>If I did try it again, I have two potential plots.  1) Strange new creatures are causing trouble in my fantasy world and a group of adventurers is sent to figure out what they are and where they come from.  Adventure ensues.  2) The next part of Catastrophe Theory (not a novel, I know, but writing, none the less).<br><br>If I do it, the plan is to write it out on paper.  I can&#39;t be trusted with an internet connection while I&#39;m writing.  I&#39;ll need to buy a new notebook, if I decide to get it done.<br><br>I&#39;ve done it a couple of times, though I can&#39;t remember exactly which years.  They all blend together a bit.  I&#39;ve never even come close to winning.  I&#39;ve never been what one might call a &quot;prolific writer&quot;.  It takes me forever to write anything and I get distracted by new ideas all the time.<br><br>Words of wisdom, I&#39;ve got.  <br><br>1) Find a place to call your Writing Workspace.  When you are in that place, you do nothing but write.  You don&#39;t eat in there.  You don&#39;t make phone calls.  When you are in that place, you write.  Stick to that.<br><br>2) Find a way to limit distractions.  Unplug the internet.  Switch to paper and pen, like me, if you can&#39;t be trusted.  Make a special playlist that doesn&#39;t have any words (words are all right if you can&#39;t understand them).  Lock your roommates in a closet.  Whatever you need to do.<br><br>3) This last one is the most important.  Get plenty of sleep, stay hydrated, and remember to eat well.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

That, I think, can wait until I&#39;ve edited at least Volume 1 into some semblence of decency.<br><br>But I <i>do</i> have a plan: to be completely crazy. <i>The Kraken-Knights of Wintertide</i> will be riding to bring destruction to the Skyfarms, and I intend to let the whole story descend into ridiculousness as soon as possible. I am (as always) inspired by BeautyID&#39;s <a href="http://sandtree.livejournal.com/218014.html">The Magical Adventures of Ladies and Gentlemen</a>, which she was kind enough to post in its entirety on LJ back when she wrote it (2007!).

            <p>...but I think I may try this year, if only because this year seems to be about new beginnings for me, the most noticeable of which is that thing called high school.

Write. Just write. Leave your editor in October and don&#39;t look back. You can pick him/her up again in December. They won&#39;t mind. No, they&#39;ll complain at the mess you made, but then they&#39;ll edit to their heart&#39;s content.<br><br>2. Get a writing buddy that you can do word sprints with. For fifteen to twenty minutes write as much as you can, as fast as you can. IE Word vomit. Doesn&#39;t have to be good, just get it down.<br><br>3. Give yourself writing rewards. A lot of people do food rewards. That doesn&#39;t work for me. I have a few TV shows that I can only get online. I write 500 words, I give myself ten minutes of that TV show, then write another 500 words. Three of those and you&#39;re almost at the word minimum.<br><br>4. Try and make it to some of the write-ins in your areas. They do word-sprints, plot bingo, and all kinds of other things. And quite often, they&#39;re at coffee shops, or places that coffee is. Always good.<br><br>5. Don&#39;t give up.<br><br><br>My NaNo name is... alswaiter. *shock* PM me if you want there. I&#39;m always up for NaNo stuffs.<br><br>A few good writing podcasts I listen to are:<br><a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/"><a href="http://www.writingexcuses.com/">http://www.writingexcuses.com/</a></a><br><a href="http://www.thenarrativebreakdown.com/"><a href="http://www.thenarrativebreakdown.com/">http://www.thenarrativebreakdown.com/</a></a> - (Drew just found this one)<br><br>Want to pick my brain?

            <p>(Email should be above - but keep asking on the Board! It&#39;s more fun!)<br><br>Well, there&#39;s two major problems here:<br><br>1/ Either Gorem&#39;s legs are ridiculously huge, or the size chart (and indeed every picture I can find) is drawn with massive perspective. But for the same of argument, we&#39;ll assume both the height and proportions are correct.<br><br>2/ The visible features on the closeup are small enough on the other that a single pixel will make significant difference.<br><br>There would be a third issue, that we can&#39;t tell how far in front of Gorem Julie is standing, but fortunately, <a href="http://pu.i.wp.pl/bloog/84707975/51965001/Julie_Gorem_Ip_medium.jpg">a slightly different angle</a> confirms that she&#39;s standing on what appears to be his (its?) shoulder. So that&#39;s okay.<br><br>Now, the height. Assuming Julie to be 4&#39;6&#39;&#39;, and that she&#39;s standing upright (which she mostly is), and to be exactly level with Gorem&#39;s head (which she isn&#39;t, quite), we can see that her height of 260 pixels is equal to:<br><br>-The distance from the middle of one of Gorem&#39;s eyes to the far side of the other<br>-The distance between the narrowest parts of his cheekbones<br>-The distance between the bottom of his &#39;mouth&#39; (not including the goatee) and the bottom of his brow ridge.<br>-The distance from the outside of his eye socket to the far side of his nose, on a level with the eyes.<br><br>On the full-scale picture, if we zoom right in, we can measure those distances as, in order, 10px, 9px, 11px, 10px. And Gorem&#39;s height is 300px (excluding crest)/320 px (including crest).<br><br>That gives us an average &#39;Julie-equivalent&#39; unit of 10px - which means Gorem is 30 times Julie&#39;s height, with an extra two Julies on top as his crest. That puts his height as 135&#39;, or 45 yards - or 0.026 miles, or indeed almost exactly two chains. In metric, he&#39;s 41 meters.<br><br>By contrast, the biggest Pokemon I&#39;m aware of is Wailord, who clocks in at 14.5 m, or 47&#39;. That&#39;s almost exactly a third of Gorem&#39;s height. The <i>smallest</i> Pokemon I&#39;ve actually heard of are things like Diglett and Natu, at 0&#39;08&#39;&#39;, or 0.2 m. That, um...<br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y148/Huinesoron/PokeGorem.png"><br><br>hS</p>

Is there a program that you use, or do you zoom the pictures in to such a ridiculous scale that you can see every individual pixel and then count?<br><br>And if you don&#39;t mind, a follow-up question: Now that we know that 4&#39;6&quot; equates to about 10 px in the scale picture, how tall is Aquos Preyas (the smallest of the Bakugan in the scale picture, that is, the blue scaly creature standing in front of Pyrus Dragonoid)?</p>

            <p>Specifically, the square &#39;select&#39; tool gives a readout of the size of the box while you&#39;re holding the mouse button down.

            <p>I feel kinda mixed about it. I don&#39;t like Whatsisface Awesomeagent guy and Skye irks me, Maya seems interesting but rather flat, but I do like Fitzsimmons and Maria Hill here. Coulson I still like but not as much as I did in the Avengers. The story seems interesting so far, especially the Tahiti thing, and I must admit that whatsisface&#39;s rant against superheroes at the end, I kinda thought was actually supposed to be about race - I mean, in-character, not just subtext wise.</p>

            <p>Just watched it on 4od (cos i&#39;m a Brit). It&#39;s good, and I liked most of it. But there were some points that just irked me, probably cos I&#39;ve watched so many similar shows where they always find a third way to do it, it&#39;d almost be nice if they didn&#39;t manage to do it sometimes cos after all Marvel isn&#39;t always a happy comic universe (look at the X-men and X-men vs Avengers stuff)</p>

            <p>... both the necessary characters and the necessary equipment for the third way were set up WAY in advance; I for one guessed it was coming.

            <p>If we establish early on that Colston and S.H.I.E.L.D. will do whatever it takes to take the third option, won&#39;t it be that much more powerful when they come across something that there is no third option for? Just a thought, though I do agree with you.</p>

I got more character definition for most of the main cast out of one episode than I see in a full season for a lot of other shows, and I think it&#39;s set itself up to go plenty of places from where it is now, especially since it has all of Marvel&#39;s concepts and characters to draw from for future story ideas.<br><br>Case in point, apparently Franklin Hall, a.k.a. the guy who becomes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton_(comics)">Graviton</a>, is going to show up in a few episodes.

            <p>We&#39;ve already had this conversation - multiple times - but I&#39;ll say it again. This kind of behavior is not welcome here, and as long as you&#39;re going to continue to be melodramatic and/or threatening, please do it elsewhere.

            <p>You just have to check and see if the fics are claimed yet. If they&#39;re not, then check and see if they&#39;re on the Unclaimed Badfic List. If they aren&#39;t, you&#39;re safe.

            <p>Every OFU needs its own school color! The Baker Street Academy has crimsun, the Pokémon OFU had &quot;blood shot red&quot;, HFA has blello, IAHF had bled, and the WhOFU can have maglimeta.

            <p>It isn&#39;t as though you using the magenta/lime color is going to <i>prevent</i> anyone else from using it, so it&#39;s not greedy. Enthusiastic, yes, but that&#39;s not a bad thing.<br><br>Huh. I&#39;ve actually seen &quot;plue&quot; as a misspelling-induced color in some places on the Pit, during the same off-topic Google search that led to my discovery of &quot;otange&quot;. Good call there.<br>But calling it &quot;blink&quot;? In a Doctor Who OFU? With that name, combined with Doctor Who&#39;s propensity for throwing aside logic in order to up the stakes, that name will almost certainly lead to someone painting a wall &quot;blink&quot;, allowing a Weeping Angel free access to that hall and only that hall, indefinitely, because everything in that hall is &quot;blinking&quot; in the same way painting something red is &quot;reddening&quot; it.<br><br>Or was that the plan?

            <p>Oh, I know that it&#39;s not a new thing to get different authors to write tie-ins (and spin-offs and sequels an prequels and what have we).<br>What seems to be new (or maybe it isn&#39;t and I just haven&#39;t been paying attention) is that rather than the publishers approaching specific authors and asking them to write something under a license (like in the case with Eion Colfer or Brandon Sanderson who&#39;s finishing Wheel of Times), they are approaching the fanbase (Not trying to imply that Colfer and Sanderson are not fans of the works they are continuing. I&#39;m sure they are.) and asking them to contribute and then they pick the best.</p>

            <p>The annual PPC Badfic Game has finally dropped off the front page, and posting had died right down towards the end. That is usually the signal to post a Closing Ceremonies thread to discuss the whole thing.<br><br>The thing I&#39;m not sure about is whether it slowed down because everyone had posted everything they wanted to/had their fill of that breed of fun/run out of things to say - or because it was getting further down the page, and people don&#39;t look down there. Virtually every thread stops getting posts below about halfway down the front page, and even I, who actually look down there regularly, tend not to post in them when they&#39;re low down.<br><br>So: any objections to closing the game down? If there&#39;s lots of people who want to keep going, this can be the new thread. If not - what did you enjoy? What did you cringe at? And most importantly, who <i>were</i> you?<br><br><s>JayBird</s> <s>hS</s> fanficWorld Admin</p>

            <p>If there is a continuation, I think that I may have to write another chapter. Perhaps even a few more chapters. I have a few ideas on where to take Verce Jumper, including a bit outside of the PPC universe... I mean verce.<br><br>However, treating this as a non-continuation, I will go ahead and reveal some facts about Jumping In. Oh, I suppose I should say that I was xX-VerceMaster-Xx, but honestly, I think I was a little obvious.<br><br>Jumping In has a sad story behind it. Jumping In, much as it sucks, is the original origin story for Jumper. While aspects of it are purposefully altered to make it even worse, a sad number of plot points in the story were from the actual origin. <br><br>The Library was almost exactly as described, for the exact reasons I stated in the story. How did he get it? No idea. Why does he have it? Because he can and it is cool. The original idea was for the Library to be his &#39;hub,&#39; from where he travels across his sector of the multiverse using the books around him. This would allow for me to write stories with Jumper without interference of the PPC, as they cannot contact him inside his library. Handy, no? As bad as it is, I may have the Library be his yet. Not as powerful as I had it here, but a similar idea. We will see. <br><br>Jumper&#39;s writing in LoTR, correcting the books? Yeah... The idea at the time was to show that the worlds he traveled to were different from the Word Worlds of the PPC. While they are, and I know how to present this difference much better now, this was not the way to do it. Does not speak well on his ability to protect the canons when he views the original work as incorrect. The part of him being Tom Bombadil was not part of the original though; this was just for me to rant on how much I dislike Tom while showing that Verce Jumper does care for the canon. See, Verce is not bad, because even though Tom is a useless diversion from the plot and serves no purpose for the story, Verce will make the sacrifice and look like the not-god for the sake of the original story. Agent material right here folks. Oh, while we are on that sequence, Jumper actually did steal a sonic screwdriver from the Doctor. You see, Jumper has a bit of a curiosity about fantastic items, scientific or magical in nature, so he takes them and tries to &#39;examine&#39; them. See, personality flaw!<br><br>I originally thought that Jumper would fall into the PPC because of a stray plothole in mid Jump. Perhaps it came during the Blackout? No idea, and I have found a much better way of introducing him. I just have to finish this darn Marvin and Printworthy mission first, then in the next one... Well, you&#39;ll see.<br><br>Now, for Verce standing in the halls screaming, &quot;EVERYTHING IS WRONG!!!&quot; This is a point that I am still going to use, though much calmer. And less hammy. As I have mentioned, Jumper is from a different sector of the Multiverse, and during his travels, he began to &#39;feel&#39; the nature of the world he was in. Not reality-sensitive per-se, more just started noticing the more subtle differences between worlds. As such, when he enters HQ, he complains of the world feeling &#39;wrong.&#39; HQ, for him, is a hybrid of the Word Worlds and the organic worlds that he is more used to. It manifests for him as a conflicting feeling in his head, giving him an almost constant headache.<br><br>Nothing else I can really think of to comment about that story for now really. I regrettably have missed out on a lot of stories, so before I give my thoughts on others stories, I will have to run by fanficWorld and catch up. If you have any questions on this story, just ask, and I&#39;ll be happy to respond.<br><br>Oh, one last thing. Jumper, Marvin, Printworthy, and Sarah (Jumper&#39;s future partner) will be MSTing this story at some point, with additional chapters added to it. Fun times are ahead. </p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t finished my first story yet, due to a variety of reasons that gave me little time for writing, and I have a second in the works(possibly). I&#39;d like to at least get the first finished before the Badfic Games wrap up for this year. I could post the last chapters on the second page, but that would be no fun. Nobody would read them.<br><br>Outhra/Cyber-Observer</p>

            <p>That is, I still have several stories that I&#39;m working on and would like to post. That hasn&#39;t happened yet because I&#39;ve had holidays.

If you ever need any mechanical creatures possessed and converted to your side, just aim the jar at the offending being and pop off the top!

            <p>Too much time in an altered mindset can do weird things to a person. I see from your later chapters in the fanficWorld thread that you&#39;re already on speaking terms with your DuskWater self; that&#39;s good. It keeps the other mindset from becoming hostile, and allows it to differentiate itself as a separate entity. You don&#39;t want it claiming to be the &quot;real&quot; you, or you&#39;re going to have a real problem, no pun intended.<br><br>All pseudo-psychology aside, that sort of thing is why I didn&#39;t make Cyber-Observer much different from myself, albeit a version myself from several years ago before I learned that not everything I thought up was a good idea. It feels weird shifting out of something you didn&#39;t realize you became accustomed to.<br>Maybe I&#39;ll diverge a little further next year; this year&#39;s Cyber-Observer was more an experiment than anything else, and it failed in certain respects.</p>
