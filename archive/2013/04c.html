Changed&quot; There should be a comma instead of a period/full stop, and the subsequent capitalization fix. Fragments, you know. If you want to keep it a sentence, add &quot;She was&quot; to the beginning, and a &quot;they were&quot; after that sentence&#39;s &quot;but&quot; couldn&#39;t hurt. Additionally, &quot;originally&quot; may be a better word in that sentence than &quot;effectively&quot;, considering that Evie is no longer the same as GLaDOS.<br><br>&quot;GLaDOS&#39;&quot; should be &quot;GLaDOS&#39;s&quot;, since there is only one GLaDOS in the area at the time.<br><br>&quot;(well, it does sort-of&quot; should have a comma after &quot;does&quot;.<br><br>&quot;reality-warping entites&quot; should be &quot;reality-warping entities&quot;<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s not all bad really.&quot; could use a comma after &quot;bad&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Oh, are you finished.&quot; should be &quot;Oh, you are finished.&quot; or &quot;Oh, are you finished?&quot; I&#39;m not sure which you were going for.<br><br>&quot;your sort of thing though really&quot; needs another comma after &quot;though&quot;.<br><br>&quot;the AI spoke with almost visceral disgust&quot; should either capitalize the T in &quot;The&quot; or change &quot;spoke&quot; to &quot;said&quot;.<br><br>&quot;worm like construct&quot; should have a hyphen between the first two words.<br><br>&quot;superheated plasma he shot&quot; needs a comma after &quot;plasma&quot;<br><br>&quot;He emerged in a heap in one of the control rooms&quot; is confusingly phrased. Maybe &quot;He emerged from a heap in one of the control rooms&quot;, but you do not emerge while in a heap. It&#39;s like &quot;grinning&quot; a line of dialogue. It is hard to do.<br><br>&quot;it on. &quot;Missed me, GLaDOS.

I could say remove the semicolon and make it a comma, but &quot;the DoSAT techs I imagine&quot; could be considered a separated phrase. If it is, the rule would be to make the comma before &quot;and&quot; another semi-colon, but that doesn&#39;t look right to me. Deal with this how you feel is best.

            <p>I&#39;m always happy to help with that sort of thing. I wish I&#39;d played Portal, though; the story&#39;s good even with my lack of experience in its continuum, but more knowledge of GLaDOS would probably make the jokes funnier.<br><br>On a similar note, though not related to the story itself, I noticed to my ongoing irritation that I&#39;d left out o&#39;s in &quot;annoyed&quot; and &quot;reports&quot; in the last sentence of my SpaG report. Oh, irony, why do you do this?</p>

            <p>So, between the point in which the full stampede of ypurs escaped Slorp and the point in which they entered Aperture Science, there was an unknown period of time in which twenty-three of them were loose as a small but separate group, and then captured in a forcefield through unknown circumstances.<br><br>(rubs hands together) And now I have a time frame for <i>my</i> Blackout interlude.<br><br>I love a ragged but orderly timestream.

            <p>With the small caveat that as the total number of ypurs in the stampede has not been stated, I thought I&#39;d leave it vague as to whether the twenty-three that escaped was the whole lot, or whether they were just one group of many (in separate forcefields).

<br><li>Slorp comes into existence and spooks ypurs into the corridors of HQ.</li>
<br><li>Ypurs rampage through HQ, until Evie and others come up with a way of trapping them in a DoSAT vehicle hangar.</li>
<br><li>A group of 23 (maybe the whole lot, maybe a subset) are let out of their forcefield to prevent them going bonkers in the enclosed space. The group happen to run over a portal to Aperture Science and are lost.</li>
<br><li>Evie retrieves Fish from the Time Lord reunion and this interlude starts.</li>

            <p>I feel like some things need to be cleared up before I continue.<br><br>1. How does recruitment function?

            <p>1.) I suppose it depends on the writer of the particular agent/recruit. If you&#39;re talking about in-fic recruitment, then it&#39;s usually a simple offer for the recruit to have &#39;a chance to, y&#39;know, continue to exist&#39;, and then send them to the Marquis de Sod, who takes care of all of the paperwork, partner/RC assignments, etc, etc. <br><br>If you&#39;re talking about out-of-fic recruitment, then I&#39;m not sure.

            <p>I think it&#39;s just oddly phrased. Are you asking if someone could write about the period of the Blackout when the shields first went down? If so, yes, you can.<br><br>I can answer the other one, though.<br><br>A recruit can be anyone that the agents assigned to a mission decides is sufficiently non-Sueish enough to be involved in PPC matters. Usually they pick bit characters that impress them in some way for this, though supporting characters or even secondary Sues have been recruited before.<br><br>Then, to find out how the new arrival will work best in the organization, a recruit&#39;s skills and pre-existing canon knowledge are determined by the Department of Personnel, and they assign agent preparation schedules, preferred canons to work in, and the best Department to give the new Agent to. The latter is the Marquis de Sod&#39;s job, which is why most agents drop off the new recruits at his office.<br><br>Based on prior ability, experience, and the workload of whoever&#39;s doing the paperwork that day, sometimes there&#39;s a training process, sometimes the recruit decides or is assigned to spend time as an intern to gain canon knowledge or general prestige before getting full agent status, and sometimes extenuating circumstances prevent a recruit from becoming an agent for a while.<br><br>Obviously, in order to become an Assassin, an agent would have to be able to use at least one deadly weapon proficiently, a Bad Slasher would need above-average smut tolerance, and an Agent in an Infrastructure Department would need to be able to fix things or work in financial matters or whatever happens there. There are a lot of Infrastructure Departments, and I don&#39;t remember them all.<br><br>Does this work as your answer, or did you want a slightly different one?</p>

            <p>That was never in question. They&#39;re only not cool when you&#39;re in their path.<br><br>Plus, I don&#39;t think more than maybe one person has even killed a Sue with a rockslide, so it&#39;s still a fresh idea. It&#39;s not like &quot;toss it into a volcano&quot;, which is just as deadly, but has become so common that people now want to spice it up by involving catapults or scorpions just to make it a more unique spectacle.</p>

            <p>Usually, it&#39;s frowned upon by the Flowers to execute a Sue outside the continuum unless it&#39;s for poetic justice or whatever you&#39;re going to do in the outside continuum would be really funny.<br><br>That, and I&#39;m not sure what sort of Suvian acts would provoke that sort of reaction from an Agent.

            <p>Thanks! I&#39;m sure I can find a dark corner for Wobbuffet somewhere...<br><br>At the moment, Tolkien, Harry Potter, and Doctor Who are the my only stable fandoms. Hetalia might be joining the list if I ever get around to catching up on the series.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure I first found out about the PPC thanks to OFUM, at least six years ago. It held my interest for a while and then I promptly forgot about it until I stumbled across the PPC page over at TV Tropes three years ago. Since then, I&#39;ve been stopping by every few months to lurk. I should probably go take a look at the Constitution, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve read it before...</p>

            <p>If you don&#39;t like this, stop reading soon. I present to you the five step process for creating mummies!<br><br>1) The heart, lungs, stomach and liver are washed in palm wine and preserved in canopic jars along with copious amounts of natron salt. They&#39;re basically little clay jars with the faces of gods. I used to know which god went with each of the four organs, which made me popular with groups of boys at haloween, not so much the rest of the year. <br><br>2) Other organs, such as the brain, are thrown out. They didn&#39;t see much use for the large intestine (given what it was full of...) and they removed the brain by breaking through the septum and the back of the nose, then whisking around with a wire and draining the skull. King tut had his head packed with resin after that so it would stay the right shape: they didn&#39;t do that to everyone.<br><br>3) Wash everything in palm wine, pack it in natron salt for forty days inside and out in order to bring all the moisture out and kill all the bacteria. <br><br>4) Depending on the dynasty, either put the preserved organs back in or leave them in their jars while you sew the dude back up and wrap him in forty layers of bandages (the finest linen for a pharoh,) and cover him in amulets to ward off evil spirits and ensure that his Ba (part of his soul) can return.<br><br>5)Bury him with a massive procession, paid public mourners, and as many grave goods as you can stuff in a pyramid.<br><br>I hope that took your mind off the bugs. :)</p>

            <p>I think what&#39;s happened here is just a misunderstanding. <br><br>I would <i>never</i> do such a thing (and in fact didn&#39;t). I can only assume that that piece of writing is just a highly meta piece of fanfic, most likely written and distributed by someone that&#39;s out to get me. Possibly Amy. Seriously, if you could check it with a CAD I&#39;m sure it would show that I was OOC. Clearly it should have carried the usual disclaimer of &#39;all characters and events portrayed are fictional, and any resemblance to persons living or dead, or actual events, is entirely coincidental&#39;. <br><br>Anyway I&#39;ve inspected all of the walls here, and they&#39;re fine, they&#39;re all fine. So there&#39;s no reason whatsoever for you to come down and look for yourself, it&#39;d just be a waste of your time. Honest.<br><br>-Agent Skeet (DMS)<br></p>

            <p>These were both fun to read!  In &quot;Adoption,&quot; I like that you keep the mini-Moggets an active presence throughout the entire story.  It&#39;s also good that you gave both agents a reaction to the situation, and kept that characterization going throughout the entire story.<br><br>In &quot;Delivery,&quot; I like how the foods being eaten for breakfast at the beginning reappear at the end to show the agents that the Irish Samuri is a mini.  It makes for some efficient bookend details around the start and finish.

            <p>The mini-Moggets were good fun to write, I definitely plan on doing more with them.

            <p>Just got through reading these, and I think the first is my favorite. I thought the part about sawing through the concrit, and having it spit out little broken-down chunks of actual constructive criticism, was very clever, and then you went and added a reference to breaking the fourth wall, which made me laugh out loud. I also liked the &quot;Warning, this is not a drill&quot; gag. Well done!<br><br>I hope Kur&#39;nak does get to come back and hang out with Skeet sometime. Probably do him good, and I&#39;m sure the conversation would be interesting to read. *g*<br><br>And now some nitpicks. I spotted a typo in the first interlude:<br><br>&quot;Skeet had never managed to get the <b>hand</b> of navigating HQ&quot; - should be &quot;hang.&quot;<br><br>And some awkward wording in the second:<br><br>&quot;it was more <b>just</b> that she could practically feel her arteries hardening <b>just</b> from&quot; - you probably only need the second one of those.<br><br>Also, I think &quot;mini&quot; should be capitalized in both titles.<br><br>Also also, a thought: there was a thing a while back about how it would be a good idea for FicPsych to have therapy animals. I don&#39;t know if it ever went anywhere (it wasn&#39;t my idea), but I&#39;m wondering, how intelligent are the mini-Moggets, and are there one or two who might be amenable to being attached to the department? I figure you can&#39;t go too wrong with effectively immortal fluffy white kitties. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Glad you enjoyed it. I&#39;m not quite sure where the idea of the little chunks of concrit came from, but once I&#39;d had it, it just seemed to make perfect sense. And I think that those &#39;Not a Drill&#39; labels could be really useful - when you think about it, most things in life aren&#39;t drills. :)<br><br>I hope Kur&#39;nak gets to hang out with Skeet again too - he was really fun to write. And good practise for me too, I think. That was actually the first time I&#39;ve written someone else&#39;s character in a while. <br><br>Thanks for pointing out those errors, I believe that I&#39;ve fixed them now. <br><br>I vaguely recall that idea about FicPsych using animals for therapy, although I can&#39;t find any trace of it at the minute. In the <i>Abhorsen</i> books, Mogget is a very intelligent and powerful magical creature, so mini-Moggets should be intelligent enough to understand anything someone says to them. Of course, they are still cats, so whether they actually listen or not will probably depend on how much bacon/salmon they&#39;re being offered at the time. <br><br>I&#39;m sure that there would be a few of them that would be happy working over in FicPsych... in fact, that might fit in quite well with another Interlude that I&#39;ve got planned. If I remember rightly, you have ownership of most of the FicPsych personnel - is there any Nurse in particular that you think would be part of this project, and would I be able to borrow them for a brief appearance? </p>

            <p>Thanks for the link, I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d have found it myself - obviously wasn&#39;t using the right search terms. <br><br>Actually, the more I think about it, the more mini-Moggets seem like a good choice for helping out FicPsyche. Each one has a miniature copy of one of the necromantic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bells_(Old_Kingdom_Series)">Bells</a> (one of the main magic systems in <i>Abhorsenverse</i>) on its collar, and while they&#39;re far less powerful than the full size ones, they still should have a range of abilities that could be useful in FicPsych: sending people to sleep, silencing screams, or erasing memories. </p>

            <p>I suppose some minis might be averse to certain condiments, yes, but once a mini has been used in a story, it can only be changed if given numerous unassailable reasons why it shouldn&#39;t be that form.

Meg is really hard to describe, though. I mean, her face does things, and so does her voice, and I can write dialogue for her (I think) but I can never seem to describe her properly.

Also, it probably helps that I tend to ship practically <i>everything</i> as long as it doesn&#39;t break my brain, and have even been known to both ship people and love them as just really close friends (cases in point: Spock and Kirk, Dean and Cas, a bunch more Star Trek characters, and we&#39;ll stop there.)<br><br>But see, the calmer waters tend to have a lot more jokes than the rapids.

            <p>...mostly because I hadn&#39;t placed down a timeline of events when I was editing your piece but:<br>the timestamp for the warning and the message for the Doctor should be either 3 April or 4 April 2013, and I&#39;m leaning more towards 4 April. The blackout has already gone through 2013 HST for two days; it may not seem as long to Sergio and Nikki because of time distortions, but it has been long for others.</p>

            <p>Wow.  You&#39;ve really set up an interesting scenario here.  I&#39;m going to be watching curiously to find out how you cause Sergio and Nikki to disappear.  (If they even do.  You didn&#39;t show them absolutely confirming that they weren&#39;t around in 2013; they just didn&#39;t see any sign of themselves.  *fingers crossed*)<br><br>My favorite scene of all was when the blackout first hit, and in the hallway, agents are starting to peek out of their RCs with different light sources.  It&#39;s a minor moment, but to me, it&#39;s a great way of showing how HQ united over this, and how different agents from different backgrounds have their own ways of dealing with problems.</p>

            <p>The first one was detained in the part of HQ that intersected with the Harry Potter continuum, the second was captured by the Captain Dandy, and it couldn&#39;t have been the third because that one was subsumed by Slorp soon after it was first encountered. I would have asked if this was a fourth angel, and then I saw that bit about Sergio&#39;s gun being designed to take out armored vehicles, so I&#39;m pretty sure a Weeping Angel could survive two grenades to the face.<br><br>This was a good interlude!

            <p>Well, since I know next to nothing about Google Docs, compared to me, practically everyone has magic power over them. I see people making docs that only about a handful of people can look at and just blink in confusion. It&#39;s probably super-easy one you know how to do it, though.<br><br>For now, I&#39;m just content that somebody&#39;s working on the problem. It&#39;s better than what I thought might have been going on, which was that the person who had control over the docs was no longer active and thus the people who could view it now were the only ones. Then again, I suppose one of those people could just copy-paste the text into a new site if that happened.</p>

            <p>Basically, a Google Document is just like a Word or Open Office document, except it&#39;s on the Internet instead of your hard drive. There are two basic states, published and unpublished, and various privacy settings for viewing and editing, which are set by the owner. Being able to view a document and make changes at the same time as a cowriter anywhere in the world is its greatest asset, not to mention fun to watch while it&#39;s happening. {= )<br><br>Anyway, what happened to the Invasion stuff is that somehow they all got set to private, so that you&#39;d have to get the owner to expressly allow your account to view them (oh, and you&#39;d need a Google Drive account). Normally, published documents are made public, so that anyone with the link can see them.

            <h1>1: The easy way. My probably-longest PPC mission, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1-s7LIQsH6vWklzYLPriCMYS5CWQDIsUdtRXJ5qHdgCM">Woodsprite of the North</a>, was technically a co-write between myself and Selene&#39;s author (back when Selene had an author). In practice, however, it was written by me, then sent over to her to edit and make sure I&#39;d not done anything stupid.<br><br>#2: The medium way. The first six or so chapters of <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/ReorgTitle.htm">The Reorganisation</a> were cowritten. We actually wrote a scene at a time - looking at Chapter 1, I can tell you that I probably wrote six of the eight scenes, but the longest two - the very first scene and the conversation between Blue and Imbolc - were written by Vemi, my coauthor at the time. I think we just emailed a Word document back and forth.<br><br>#3: The hard way. A handful of my missions, such as <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1RidoL761j2oVr6RY3aIqOC-6kg7pFnBsVJuv3Sn5Omo">The Child of Susan Sto-Helit</a>, or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1EMcVyxgFGwsw5g9My3iahjPrausUb3D_woTdp7RYiw4">Two Worlds United</a>, were &#39;true&#39; cowrites. I actually sat down over IM (I think Vemi used AIM, while Constance&#39;s author Kaitlyn used MSN) and wrote them line by line, going back and changing things when either of us weren&#39;t happy with what the other wrote. You can tell this sort of cowrite by the &#39;compound conversation&#39; phenomenon - where dialogue consists of one character saying three different things, the other replying to each in order, and so on...<br><br>#3.5: The easier hard way. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1o-WydVPWUJZBx8Ewlm8UhV7UCEDXw7Dga0jXZSE7GUM">Brown DragonRider of Pern</a> was a three-way cowrite done &#39;the hard way&#39;. It took years (any idea exactly how long, Neshomeh, if you&#39;re reading?), but wasn&#39;t done through IM. I actually set up a guestbook on one of my websites specifically for us to write the story in. The basic method was the same, though - line by line, with occasional corrections along the way.<br><br>(And for the record, I understand Jay and Acacia used method #3)<br><br>hS</h1>

            <p>Well, I know it was finished by the time I got married, so it can&#39;t be more than four years... I&#39;ll check later and see if I have the file.<br><br>You make a good point about sorting out conversations - it&#39;s certainly possible, but I think far easier to plan for in advance than try and fix later. As a general rule, my collaborative pieces were significantly longer than my solo ones - which means there&#39;s that much more to reedit, and on a massive scale besides.<br><br>Probably the best way of avoiding it would be to have a system for noting that you have something else to say. If, for example, Agent Ahpla was teasing Agent Etab about the latter&#39;s infatuation with the canon character Ammag Atled-Nolispe (y&#39;know, for example), and Etab&#39;s author wanted to add an &#39;Anyway, what about you and Atez&#39;ate Ateht?&#39;, we&#39;d usually end up with this:<br><br>Ahpla: And the look on your face when he walked past was priceless!<br>Etab: I wouldn&#39;t call it <i>priceless</i>.

And what do you mean by that?<br>&amp;c&amp;c<br><br>But what we actually <i>should</i> do is something like this:<br><br>Ahpla: And the look on your face when he walked past was priceless!<br>Etab: I wouldn&#39;t call it <i>priceless</i>. [I want to mention Ahpla and Atez&#39;ate Ateht when we get a moment]<br>Ahpla: Oh? Then how much would you say it would cost? [Then have Etab reply to this and we&#39;ll switch topics]<br>Etab: £5.60. That&#39;s minimum wage, right? - anyway, what about you and Atez&#39;ate Ateht?<br>Ahpla: What do you mean by that?<br>&amp;c&amp;c<br><br>Obviously it leads to longer conversations, but, well, that&#39;s what happens when you want to make more stuff. The difficulty crops up when you want to reply to something that was said immediately without breaking the thread of conversation... I&#39;unno about that.

            <p>I do recall someone starting a thread about the ban being lifted, someone else going &quot;good grief, there&#39;s badfic <i>already</i>, look!&quot;, and the three of us joining forces to spork it. Pretty sure that was all the same thread. It probably happened in November (when the ban was officially lifted) or December, though, and I&#39;m guessing holidays would&#39;ve put us off to a bad start.<br><br>Actually, wait. I can pin this down, because there&#39;s a bit about the <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> movie in the intro, which had not yet come out when I wrote it. It came out January 21 here, so we definitely started writing sometime between November 2004 and January 21, 2005.<br><br>(That intro is pretty embarrassing now. &gt;.&gt; )<br><br>Agreed, planning out the dialogue ahead of time helps a lot, and the chat in Google Drive makes that easier to do.<br><br>Also, prioritizing the likely responses is a good idea, and helps keep things more succinct. To borrow your example, the conversation could go like this instead:<br><br>Ahpla: And the look on your face when he walked past was priceless!<br>Etab: I wouldn&#39;t call it priceless. Anyway, what about you and Atez&#39;ate Ateht?<br>Ahpla: (responding to the more personal/important thing) What <i>about</i> me and Atty?<br><br>That&#39;s how my conversations usually go in real life, anyway. It&#39;s always possible to come back to an earlier point later, if someone remembers and feels like bringing it up again.<br><br>Compound conversations can happen in writing because there&#39;s no time limit. Slow and thorough is an advantage here; not so much in speech. Dialogue tends to happen rapidly, in as few words as possible, and in groups it can sometimes seem like a competition just to get a word in—waiting for a pause, jumping in at just the right moment and before someone else beats you to it, sometimes talking over them if you&#39;re really determined (or just rude). Real-time chat is the same way, again because of the time factor.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not that hard, actually. As I partecipated in some collaborations already, I&#39;ll tell you how it goes.<br><br>Part 1: The physical means, and I think the best one around is Google Drive. With it, not only a single document can be shared real-time within the collaboration team, but you basically need only a Gmail/Google/Youtube account and a computer or tablet with internet access... which doesn&#39;t even have to be your own, as the file is hosted on a server like email. And also has a built-in chat to allow the collaborators to work together. (Or start talking about random things and forget about the story. Believe me, it happens)<br><br>Part 2: Bouncing off ideas to build the basic plot of the story. No more to be said here, just exchange ideas.<br><br>Part 3: The actual writing. Can be done by writing a few lines each (very useful when each collaborator is using his own characters), or take turns writing longer bits. The latter is most useful when dealing with time zone difference, and in that case the comment function is vital: it allows to comment, write down ideas, ask for suggestions about a sentence or scene, and so on.<br><br>If you want an example, look at my missions. Interlude #1 was written with the first method, as Astral Void and I managed to get enough time zone overlap to do it. Collaboration #1 and #2 were done with the second one, as the piece was longer and there was lees overlap time with Firemagic.<br><br>To bring the point home, I&#39;m Italian, Astral Void is Australian and Firemagic is American. And yet, collaboration was possible. And fun. Collaboration is fun.</p>

            <p>...is that two or more people have editing access to the same Google Drive document, and they open it up at the same time and tag-team, usually writing their characters specifically and switching off on canons, deciding beforehand who wrangles them, or deciding on the fly. (I&#39;ve mostly done the last.)<br><br>For instance, take PPCers <i>Anna</i> and <u>Bobby</u>, who write agents <i>Samuel</i> and <u>Deanna</u>. Anna might start out like this:<br><br><i>Samuel bounced a baseball off the wall of his RC and tried to be uncomfortable. Unfortunately, he clearly wasn&#39;t uncomfortable enough, because--<br><br><b>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]</b><br><br>Samuel yelped in shock, took a step backwards, and tripped over the footstool behind him. He toppled to the floor and lay there, moaning.</i><br><br>Then she might switch to the built-in chat in the doc:<br><br><i>A: Your cue, Bobby!</i><br><u>B: &#39;K!</u><br><br>And Bobby would turn to the doc:<br><br><u>The RC&#39;s door opened, and someone laughed. &quot;Hey, Sammy, how&#39;re your ears?&quot;</u><br><br><i>Samuel glowered up at Deanna. &quot;Fine.

            <p>It would be interesting to see how arranging that would work out. Would it cut to agents in each story during the flow of others&#39; stories? Would it show each story one after the other, each handled by a different team? Or perhaps the agents would team up on the first story, then realize that there was an entire infestation of Sues, and split up after a shared &quot;Oh, CRAP&quot;. I like that last one, though it would run into a few problems as the Sue stories keep piling up. Hmm...<br><br>If this is something that&#39;s going to be done after I get Permission, I call killing the Sue that plants Avengers-universe technology into Jack Harkness and messes with his post-Torchwood continuity. Actually... (scans text) that Jack Harkness might be replaced, not just possessed. Do replaced!Harknesses keep the healing power, or is it a case-by-case basis? Because I don&#39;t know how people would go about killing a being with Jack Harkness&#39;s massive healing factor. Just... throw him into a sun, I guess.</p>

            <p>I rechecked the badfic (which was actually in the badfic set Lily Winterwood reported a few posts back), and it was the Sue that had the Avengers-verse technology implanted in her, not Captain Jack. Poor phrasing and an out-of-place POV shift made me misread the bit that the extracanonical technology was mentioned in. The Jack Harkness chapter was short, and in bright clashing colors, so I skimmed it instead of properly reading it. I don&#39;t think I missed a lot.<br><br>That&#39;s good, though, because nobody would be able to cut through the skin of replaced!Jack Harkness long enough to get anything out, and having an &quot;arch&quot; reactor (which I imagine would be an arc reactor in the shape of the Gateway Arch) would be especially useful. I can&#39;t think of anything good to use it for right now, though, which is strange because possessing massive amounts of free electricity would usually promote lots of ideas.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t find the mission you mentioned where the first replaced!Jack was encountered, but I&#39;ll take your word for it that his replacements would keep the healing factor. If this fic&#39;s copy ends up recruited, which he might easily be since he doesn&#39;t seem to have any traits, malicious or otherwise, he could make an interesting ESAS agent once he develops a personality. Who better to take down god-mode Sues than a man who is unable to die?</p>

            <p>It...was kind of annoying, but didn&#39;t really send me into a rage. I&#39;m not surprised you misread it due to poor quality, though; the color changes didn&#39;t help either. The Sue was pretty ridiculous, though. And no, you didn&#39;t miss much.<br><br>True, true. Wait, what&#39;s the Gateway Arch? As to electricity...well, you could put a huge entertainment system in your RC, or set up a new department in HQ, or use it as an emergency back-up in case someone hijacks DoDAEG, or maybe DoSAT could do something with it...the ideas are limitless!<br><br>Really? Hm. I&#39;ll see if I can find you a link. And he would be rather perfect for ESAS, wouldn&#39;t he? I hadn&#39;t even thought that far, but you&#39;re absolutely right.<br><br>I wonder what kind of personality he&#39;d develop...I think he&#39;d be a bit more sappy than canon!Jack, since that seems to be most of his characterization in the chapter, but that&#39;s just about all I&#39;ve got. (The Sue also took Ianto&#39;s role, which annoyed me. A lot. I don&#39;t like her. She basically shoved him to the side and made him into a cardboard cutout, after which she sapped away most of Jack&#39;s character. Not good at all.)<br><br>Also, see my response to Lily--I think Agent Jack will end up in my Blackout Interlude, once I know a bit more about what sort of personality he&#39;d have. Because, really...this needs to happen.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>DawnFire has a sizable amount of Agents to bring in, and she said she&#39;s started writing for at least one of the chapters already. Maybe her team and yours would be assigned to the same badfic by the Sunflower Official, and they don&#39;t think the Sue merits the team-up until they kill it and it regenerates and switches to the next chapter. Then, they&#39;d split up and try to deal with the Sue&#39;s regenerations individually for a while, before meeting back up at the end for disposal.

I had already been planning on a good way to dispose of the Sue Lord involving the wonky temporal rules of the Timecop continuum, but I suppose it would be just as removed by throwing it into the Eye of Harmony or something if I end up not being able to help out.</p>

            <p>Can my agents (whoever they may be) sort of stumble in at some point and then stumble out again with their new recruit?

            <p>I skimmed through the chapters. The majority are Sues going around on basically the same plotline, hence the Sue Lord idea (yes that&#39;s the Very Bad Idea). The Sues claim to be different races - Time Lord, Human, half-and-half - but Suvian Regeneration would probably make the Sue Lord, once killed by my Agents, disappear in a flash of urple light and reappear again in the next chapter. Or something.<br><br>There&#39;s one Gary Stu, and one crossover Sue with the girl getting the &quot;arch reactor&quot; in her chest. You could send your Agents in at that point, stick it out with mine until the end, and then make off with replacement Jack. </p>

            <p>What would happen regarding the Gary Stu? Would he be one of the Sue Lord&#39;s regenerations, or a second Suvian character entirely? Because if he&#39;s not part of the regeneration cycle, what would happen to him in-between chapters? Nah, he&#39;s probably just one of the regenerations. It makes more sense that way.<br><br>I&#39;ve been working on a vaguely formatted fic-dimensional idea that says that basically, if an individual Sue is killed, but her influence isn&#39;t expunged yet, the badfic defaults to the next state it&#39;s in when the Sue is not present, retaining the damage until it can be removed.<br><br>Expanding on that with insertion of the Sue Lord idea, the PPC would have accidentally contributed to Suvian natural selection by hunting down and killing the most obvious ones. In most cases, such as in the Pit, this results in slyer and/or less readily obvious Sues, but in undisturbed areas like the Circle, the native Sues use the badfic&#39;s shift to points in time where an individual Suvian presence no longer exists to regrow into new forms, not part of the same presence but working for its goals, to be capable of surviving to warp the canon for a longer period of time. Thus, the Sue Lord is created, through time-space distortion and Suvian stubbornness. When a Sue of this breed is captured, killed, or otherwise removed from the events of her story, the massive glitter index would force the creation of a new Sue from the warped Word World, or the corpse of the first if it was available.<br><br>Where Time Lord regeneration compounds the memories and experiences of a Time Lord with the new personality to provide new and improved experiences in the future, the Suvian Regeneration would take the parasitic tendencies of Sues to their logical extreme, as the future Suvian incarnations actually feed on the glittery bodies or canonical shambles of their past selves to rebuild another Sue to continue where the last left off.<br><br>This is where my Timecop idea would have come in. Since you seem to have planned to write this with DawnFire alone, I suppose I&#39;d have nothing to lose by at least saying my idea here.<br><br>In the Timecop continuum, due to wonky time principles and the screenwriters not really knowing how to write a time travel movie, the &quot;you&#39;re not allowed to interact with future or alternate versions of yourself&quot; principle that time travel media enjoy is taken to a titanic extreme. When a past self makes physical contact with a future self within the Timecop continuum, both versions melt together in a slimy pile of ooze, which slowly shrinks as the time-displaced matter cancels itself out, and anything that the past self would have done from that point until it becomes its future self is removed from space-time. It&#39;s really weird, but that&#39;s what the movie claims, and that volatile time-reaction is eventually used to defeat a central antagonist.<br><br>I was thinking that if most of the Sue Lord&#39;s forms are captured rather than killed, they could be brought out of the continuum and executed in Timecop&#39;s, which would not only make for easy cleanup as they delete each other, but it would also make for a semi-poetic death when the Sues that mess with Time and Time Lords are killed by another type of messed-up time paradigm. You&#39;d need to remove the &quot;arch&quot; reactor from the chest of the Torchwood Sue before this happens and somehow keep Jacques Bonnifoy(I like his new name, too) from being removed by reassertion of the timeline, but I think it&#39;d be a pretty decent method of disposal at least, and as for keeping Jacques alive, well, PPC Agents are usually quite good at improvisation.</p>

            <p>Love the Timecop idea (although I think some of the agents may be unable to resist killing the Sues naturally several times--also, how else are they to figure out that she regenerates?--but after that, your agent(s) could mention the Timecop idea, which is then jumped upon :) ). And, like Lily said, Jacques can just be portalled into HQ first--possibly into the Marquis&#39; office, to be joined shortly by several agents. (Of course, since this is a Jack Harkness replacement we&#39;re dealing with, those agents arrive to find him flirting, or attempting to flirt, with the Marquis. If it seems to be working, the agents are probably kind of scarred by this.)<br><br>Actually, let me rephrase: the Timecop idea sounds *awesome*, Outhra. Join us, won&#39;t you?

            <p>Well, in order to find out that it is a Sue Lord, I think it would be charged and killed as normal at least once, and the agents wouldn&#39;t realize what they were dealing with until after its corpse flashes urple, a new Sue grows out of it, and they&#39;re tossed into the next chapter.<br>Lots of &quot;what just happened&quot;s would be said, and it might take another charging and killing before they&#39;re fully aware of what it is. <i>Then</i> somebody would start thinking about Timecop.<br><br>Would I be able to use the Floaters I&#39;d been planning on writing for my main mission series in this, or would I need to write (a) new character(s) to use since I&#39;m going to be writing up their bios when asking for my Permission?<br><br>I can just see the Jacques-tries-to-flirt-with-the-Marquis scene now.

            <p>Then again, the first Interlude featured the Doctor. I suppose it&#39;s to be expected.<br><br>Well, from what I have written, they&#39;re definitely both in HQ. (Although, &#39;how would agent!Jack get to the Whoniverse and back?&#39; Portals, my friend. Once they&#39;re restabilized, that is.

Anyway, yeah, his name probably should be changed. Although now we face the question...to what?<br><br>Somehow, I ended up writing him as wearing &#39;a black uniform with the flashpatch of a star above a waterlily on the shoulders&#39; (ie, a black uniform, possibly military, with the ESAS flashpatch on both shoulders).

            <p>I&#39;m not one for technical stuff, but I imagine he scanned for anomalies, found their approximate coordinates with the Remote Activator, and then modified said portal thingy to send messages to the location.

            <p>Since the portal generator that the RA accesses is, according to the wiki, able to home in on specific characters whether or not they&#39;re in a canon setting, all the Doctor would need to do would be to scan for them and input their biodata from the sonic screwdriver into the RA, and modify it so that it still contacts the location, but make the function that opens holes in space-time disabled. Then, the message would be able to reach them regardless of their location by the point in HQ where they were when the message was sent.<br><br>The consoles would probably pick up the message because they&#39;re tuned into the RA&#39;s frequency anyway, but instead of portal commands, it would be text.<br><br>(I just got an idea that the text display might not have been based on the console contact function, but was instead a version of the console&#39;s &quot;Error: non-accessible setting&quot; message hacked by the Doctor to contain his &quot;attention all anomalies&quot; message. It&#39;s silly, though, because accessing console communication would be easier and require less hoops of disbelief suspension to jump through.)<br><br>It&#39;s possible that the Doctor might not even have wanted to send a message to the other displaced canons at all, for various reasons, and Agent Jack might look close enough to canon!Jack Harkness on the scan for the Doctor to just think &quot;Captain Jack&#39;s here, too? And who&#39;s this Rumbleroar person with him?&quot; and drop the thought to send Eleanor and Christelle and Sergio and Nikki their messages.<br><br>Then again, if the Doctor sending a message to the RC of the Agent Jack works out as perfectly as DawnFire says it does, maybe that last paragraph I said can just be discarded in favor of a better story. Not much about the Doctor&#39;s methods when in HQ are set any further than they was in the first interlude yet, so there&#39;s still room to put new details in the more fluid bits.</p>

Although, I suppose they could end up in their RC for a short time, and then leave just after the Doctor&#39;s scanned for anomalies and a minute or so before the message arrives...yes, that could work. Not sure what the Doctor would do with two Jacks, though (nope! Bad brain. I&#39;m pulling you back up here right now. Just because you were writing dialogue for Jacques doesn&#39;t mean you have to stay in his mind). Maybe he could just assume it&#39;s something about HQ&#39;s architecture that&#39;s making him scan double? Or maybe he has a line about &#39;what mess are you in now, Jack?&#39; because he thinks Jack&#39;s traveled back in time so as to be in two places in HQ at once...?<br><br>Hm.

            <p>Although I suppose I could just put it in an email, if you don&#39;t mind having a plot twist revealed.

In which case, yes, I think I&#39;ll do that. And I can definitely arrange for them to be in their RC...it might suspend disbelief a little bit, but...I can arrange it.

            <p>I thought at first it could be an agent team going in only yo get thrown into the next story/chapter, and the next, and the next. Then I thought what if all the stories were happening at the same time so all these different agents assigned to the Sues go into the same fic...<br><br>And then I thought of the Sue Lord idea that was bandied in one of my missions, and wondered if all these girls (and one guy) could all just be the same Suvian presence, in different regenerations. The first time the agents kill her, she regenerates into the next one and travels to wherever the next chapter needs her to be. And we may need backup to kill then Sue Lord and her Jack Harkness replacement.</p>

Oh, I see the longer version also features top-of-the-page author&#39;s notes starring such characters as prancing Lord Voldemort (beg pardon, &#39;Voldy&#39;)... which, yes, are pretty common.

            <p>Feanor poured <i>the shards of the Silmarils</i> into his <i>blood</i>. This, of course, meant that the shards of the Silmarils would remain in his bloodline forever and that all the shards would come together in the blood of his last descendant (who, of course, is the super speshul Mary Sue). If Sauron drained the blood from her body he&#39;d get the Silmarils, which only she can bind together. The Silmarils can be used to bring back Morgoth.<br><br>There&#39;s also Dragon Riders, elves riding Cold Drakes. Mary Sue is &quot;of Dragon Rider descent&quot; too. She even has a necklace that makes her their leader. Theodred gave her a necklace that contained the only Silmaril not in her blood. Guess what else?<br><br>Mary Sue is the daughter of <i>Finrod Felagund</i>, whose canonical death in Tol-in-Gaurhoth was just a rumor. He&#39;s been living in Middle-earth all this time. Her mother is Amarie, Finrod&#39;s canon beloved. Obviously Tolkien didn&#39;t know what he was talking about, because she came to Middle-earth and died near Bree, 15 years after giving birth. Mary Sue then wandered off to roam Middle-earth.<br><br>The sequel is even worse. Mary Sue&#39;s mother was a vampire and Middle-earth is apparently home to Chimeras, who just so happen to hate vampires. Also, she&#39;s apparently Queen of the Noldor and Valinor. She gets a letter from her aunt in Valinor, flies off on the back of her Cold Drake, and finds out that her aunt is marrying her off.<br><br>Sense this series makes not. <br>I need Bleeprin.<br><br></p>

            <p>At least it was just the <i>shards</i> of the Silmarils ... although where Feanor got those shards from before his death-by-Balrog is another question, because I&#39;m positive that none of them were destroyed in canon.

Although, yeah, the entire *point* is that they weren&#39;t destroyed; Feanor wouldn&#39;t let them be destroyed, not even to save the Trees, and they were remarkably difficult to shatter in the first place.

            <p>Since the canon three were never destroyed, she has chunks of <i>something</i> floating around in there, and if it really is one of the Jewels of the Trees, or whatever their Elven title is, we&#39;ve got a real problem.<br><br>The more I think about it, the more likely it is that this would result in the creation of a Sue-forged fourth Silmaril, albeit one that&#39;s busted up and drifting in her blood.

            <p>I think that getting as many OFU Coordinators as possible involved would be awesome - and not just because I&#39;ve got plans in that direction down the line myself; it just would be.<br><br>You mention <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=242100;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a> the notion of an OFU about OFUs - how about we combine the two ideas? We could have an episodic (one chapter/episode per Sueniversity) walk-through dissection of the Sueniversity (yeah, I like the word too) - basically like a PPC mission - by the Coordinators who sign up to do it, and claim the whole thing is being filmed for the, er, OFU<sup>2</sup> Distance Learning Course.<br><br>Then at the end... well, there&#39;s a few options. Either we could leave the Sueniversity to its misery, symbolically give it a &#39;seal of disapproval&#39;, or (my favourite option) throw minis at it until it&#39;s a smoking pile of rubble.<br><br>I think this could work. Hey, don&#39;t you have two OFUs at this point? Are they both taking part?<br><br>Also, HEY OUT THERE, PPCERS! Any other current or former OFU writers willing to get involved in this? (Also also wik: given that I&#39;ve just dashed out the above idea in thirty seconds, anyone have a better way to go about it?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...is the main character somewhat Sueish by virtue of the fact that she goes immensely against the norm and we haven&#39;t been given a reason for her being there yet? And, more importantly: are there no minis?<br><br>But yes. Definitely in. Something about this story bugs me. I think it&#39;s the occasional bad grammar, the canons being constantly amazed by Rory, and <i>the lack of minis</i>, which practically characterizes an OFU.<br><br>~DF</p>

So now I&#39;m definitely in.<br><br>Agent Dawn, Miss Nariel, or both of them would be happy to participate. Actually, Dawn probably has enough on her plate, especially since she&#39;s also an Assassin. Nariel, on the other hand, would probably like a break and a chance to see what the PPCing fuss is about, which actually fits perfectly into something that we have planned, so that&#39;s wonderful. Nariel volunteers. Or is being volunteered by me, I suppose. You&#39;ll have to ask Karen about whether her character would like to join or not, though.<br><br>And, why yes, Nariel is an Elf. Also an OFUM graduate, hence the elvenness. I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be just right for the job...or willing to try, at any rate...<br><br>PPCing/dissecting it sounds good. And there could always be an alternate ending...but I think it would probably be more satisfying (and more like the PPC) to throw minis at it until it&#39;s a smoking pile of rubble, like you said. If it helps...I have mini-Nick Furys. Give them enough firepower and, well...you&#39;ve got yourself a smoking crater, actually. And with mini-Luggages and mini-Hounds/mini-whatever Hetalia&#39;s minis are in the mix...well. It won&#39;t stand a chance!<br><br>~DF</p>

Can you imagine her looking like Suethulu?) and all her bit players<br>Why they need killing: Dumb name, rebellious princess-ness, probably going to mess with Eleven and River&#39;s relationship to wedge herself in, stealing the Clockwork Droids thing as well as the Cybermen.<br><br><a href="http://www.quotev.com/story/1318286/Nimrodel-Lord-of-the-Rings-the-Fellowship-of-the-Ring/1/">Nimrodel - Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Ringa</a><br>Fandom: LotR<br>Character to kill: Nimrodel<br>Why they need killing: Stealing Nimrodel&#39;s name, joining the Fellowship, screwing with Aragorn and Arwen&#39;s relationship, tossing everyone out of character, stupid amounts of POV shifts.<br><br><a href="http://www.quotev.com/story/2922611/Last-of-the-Angels/">Last of the Angels</a><br>Fandom: LotR<br>Character to kill: France<br>Why they need killing: SHE&#39;S THE LAST OF THE ANGELS, SHE CAN SEE THROUGH THE FUTURE, SHE MESSES WITH LINDIR AND LEGOLAS, AND HER NAME IS FRANCE.

            <p>I was doing some research on the Cthulhu Mythos the other day, and it turns out that Greater Eldritch is a term from another similar continuum that had gotten mixed into my Cthulhu Mythos knowledge somehow. The closest approximation in the Cthulhu Mythos would be the Outer Gods, who are <i>way</i> too powerful to be brought around in mini form. Nyarlathotep alone makes Discord look like a playground bully.<br><br>And I call myself a fan! (hangs head in shame)<br><br>Petition to change the mini type? I&#39;d have to run it past Lilac Lielac, too, since she&#39;s planning putting Cthulu in some of her stories, but since it hasn&#39;t been featured and has only been described as yapping and possessing a tail-tentacle, its form should still be malleable.<br><br>I recommend <a href="http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs45/f/2009/133/9/6/Unponderable_Elder_Thing_by_henning.jpg">Elder Things</a> or <a href="http://www.elfwood.com/art/m/i/mindsiphon/nightgaunt.jpg">Nightgaunts</a>, with preference to Elder Things because they seem more thematically appropriate.</p>

I guess there are some benefits to having dozens of tabs open at once after all. I may have just needed time away from the lemmings to readjust, or something.

            <p>I imagine a lot of the observations would be of people fleeing from the giant eyeball that was hovering toward them. Since it&#39;s transparent, they wouldn&#39;t see it from far away, but once it was close up, they could see how the shapes of objects beyond are distorted through its round form, and there would be a panic. Rumors would spread, tales would be concocted, a local news team would be called out. Local kooks would blame aliens, the FBI, and foreigners, and the people would try and find it to see what weapon could bring it down from its hovering perch, while all the while the eye would sit there, among the multiplying chaos.

Well, this makes two of us saying please give it a rest. Willingness to improve is great, but there&#39;s no need to get a character nailed down right now, because we&#39;re not going to be ready to give you Permission for some time, regardless of what character(s) you use.

            <p>You should probably wait a while before you decide to make a character, as I&#39;m not sure you can save this character. However, don&#39;t let this put you off the whole idea.<br><br>There are still a few things I like about the character, even if the main basis isn&#39;t that good. For example, the hat collecting seems like the sort of thing a PPC agent would do, and the accordion playing could be used for the sort of humour we like, with your Agent driving his partner insane with his playing.<br><br>Anyway, while you might want to stop your ideas of making Agents until you get better versed in the world of the PPC, it&#39;s not to say that every idea of yours is bad. You just need to get a better feel of the universe you&#39;re writing for before you start thinking up the agents.<br><br><s>Although, I&#39;m not quite sure how much say I should have in this, seeing as I&#39;m not exactly experienced in the Agent making.</s></p>

            <p>Or at the very least tone it down, or give him a partner who has no truck with it to balance him out. There&#39;s a reason a character with that exact trait is on the Permission Self-Check in the &quot;List what is wrong with this guy&quot; category.<br><br>That trait would disrupt missions, usually, and when it doesn&#39;t, it would still be more problematic than it&#39;s worth to write about. I&#39;m not sure if the following is &quot;the whole point&quot; of the LO system or not, but the Lust Object trait has always been to me more a reason to oppose a particular Sue or to make brief jokes in missions than a core component of a character&#39;s personality.<br><br>Oh, and changing the bio won&#39;t do a whole lot in terms of his individual personality. The bio reflects it, yes, but if you haven&#39;t changed how you think about him as a character, he&#39;s going to be the same. And again, I stress, work on a partner. Bouncing him off someone who shares similar goals, i.e., Sue-killing, but has a different way of looking at it can help round off the rough edges of both.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to repeat my recommendation to read around the PPC. The character doesn&#39;t just have minor flaws - the core of his characterisation does not mesh with the PPC.

            <p>Just thought I&#39;d give you this handy dandy link spammage.<br><br>First off, the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Wiki page for Permission</a>. It can be pretty helpful in working some things out with Agents, as someone who has been working on agents for at least 3 months, on and off. <br><br>Secondly, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?pli=1&amp;formkey=dExsRGpKMzhPbWVnTlB6TmJVdEttc1E6MQ#gid=0">Permission Self-Check</a>. I know it&#39;s on the Permission page, but I had a hard time finding it anyway. It&#39;s good for checking whether you&#39;re ready to ask for permission. This is probably because that&#39;s what it was made <i>for</i>.<br><br>Now, here&#39;s the link to <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/">a collection of missions, the Original Series and other tidbits</a>. Reading always helps, and seeing other agents in missions is good for brainstorming ideas that work. And if you&#39;ve read them, eh, no harm in re-reading.<br><br>Finally, <a href="http://www.warrenphotographic.co.uk/photography/bigs/36495-Black-rabbit-wearing-a-white-top-hat-white-background.jpg">a picture of a rabbit with a top hat</a>. Because why not? And I know that sometimes people get upset at criticism, good or bad, so I felt a cute picture would be a nice idea.<br><br>Good luck in working out ideas for agents, and remember - have fun while you&#39;re doing it! All stress and no fun makes the PPC a boring place.</p>

PPC stories are, er, funny: that&#39;s kind of the point. Valon isn&#39;t funny: he&#39;s scary. Yes, you&#39;ve added some quirks, but you&#39;ve added them to a violent psychopath who &#39;turns off his sense of empathy&#39; and, for bonus points, &#39;spends a lot of time ogling female Agents and canonicals&#39; - including when he&#39;s an empathyless torture-fiend. That is not someone I can see fitting into the PPC.<br><br>So: I&#39;d like to recommend you read around the subject more. I note on your intro thread you say you&#39;ve read Laburnum&#39;s missions: I&#39;m aware that they make up a large chunk of our Redwall stuff, but they&#39;re really not representative of the PPC as a whole. I see you are (or were) also reading the Original Series, which is good - we try to model our agents off Jay and Acacia, with different characters but the same basic outlook of &#39;Doing this job, have to have a sense of humour, get angry sometimes but try to stay professional&#39;.<br><br>So: read some more missions! Unfortunately I don&#39;t appear to share any fandoms with you - well, a couple, but I don&#39;t recall any missions set in them - but I can point you at the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Killed_Badfic">Killed Badfic</a> list. To get a good feel for what the PPC&#39;s like, try avoiding the high-rated/NSFW stuff and reading some of the K+/T material.<br><br>For one specific (non-mission, but PPC)recommendation, the Irish Samurai recently posted an interlude to do with Abhorsen: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rKWTsxgMO-Ar_c8EuammXP3OoVLHjIj2ZoVmqR35Ims/pub">The Mini-Mogget Adoption Agency</a>. I think it gets over the feel of the PPC very well.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>One, torture is not allowed. Even for Sues. It&#39;s a bad idea. Killing them slowly, maybe, but nobody is supposed to torture. It ticks off the Flowers, because it&#39;s Black Cat methodology and also seriously not cool.<br><br>Two, you are way too new to start up Permission ideas. I realize this wasn&#39;t an official request, but keep it private until you&#39;ve got more parts of the Agent finalized and the Board gets to know you.<br><br>Three, his personality traits seem contradictory. Psychopathic rage and cool tolerance of others, for example. I realize you&#39;re still hammering him out, but read the bio beforehand and make sure it looks consistent.<br><br>Without that, it&#39;s not that bad. The hat obsession could potentially lead to a few fun scenes, and the physical description seems all right. You could really enhance him by bringing along a partner who opposes him in terms of knowledge type and reactions to situations, especially since doing so would help justify the &quot;knows about everything&quot; bit if you give him, say, a very ditzy partner. The partner dynamic is why you see so many passionate/stoic pairs or rageful/joyful pairs. Odd couples are fun and help with characterization.</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve created about three threads in a row. That&#39;s a little much especially since your introduction post is still on the front page. That&#39;s also an indicator that it is a bit too early for you to be discussing Agents with the Board. <br><br>If you really need advice, I suggest asking someone via email or the IRC.<br><br>That being said, is it necessary to have two different personalities for an Agent dependant on what he&#39;s doing? Suggesting that an Agent is only sane off duty is underestimating HQ&#39;s ability to turn someone insane. And last time I checked, Sues also had shoddy split personalities like that.<br><br>Take a step back, relax, and just participate in the topics already on the Board. We&#39;re in no rush.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;ve got a new idea, it&#39;s usually better to attach it to a tangentially related but existing thread than to start your own. In case you haven&#39;t noticed, the threads get bumped after a while, and nobody looks past the first two pages or so.<br><br>And yes, the Board moves slowly, but that&#39;s because not everyone involved can answer things all the time.

            <p>First off, torturing Sues is a no-go. And the way it&#39;s described, like that happens constantly, he sounds like he&#39;s a psychopath on or off duty. The pictures don&#39;t help with that.</p>

            <p>First, I need beta readers for a series of missions that I&#39;m writing, all set before the Blackout and meant to set up the events of the Blackout (when they&#39;re not being mission-y). One is for a Hobbit badfic, one for LotR, and one for Doctor Who/Harry Potter. SPaG and flow checkers are also welcome; please give me your email so I can add you to the respective Google doc.<br><br>Second, I notice that Deleterius, the LJ community for LotR and HP Sues, is closed. That&#39;s a pity, considering the giant piles of Sue Sludge being dredged up from the depths of the Circle of Lemmings every day (I just reported some in the fic reporting thread, under the title &quot;The Law of Lemmings&quot; and &quot;The Law of Lemmings, Part Two). I&#39;d like to start a Sue Report specifically for Circle Sues; are there people strong-willed/stomached enough to help?</p>

            <p>The usual reason people don&#39;t put their emails in full on the internet in general is that spammers (not spambots) tend to trawl for email addresses to send their stuff to. That&#39;s entirely unrelated to our occasional spambot invasions.<br><br>Regardless, nowadays spam filters are usually smart enough to catch the incoming junk.

            <p>On the plus side, now I know that the spambot invasions aren&#39;t connected to the wild spamming I&#39;ve seen mentioned, and on the minus side, an individual could just be preparing to use it without there being a warning nearly as conspicuous as rampant spamming of the Board.<br><br>You&#39;re right, though, a good spam filter should catch it, or at least most of it. I just think it would be better if one didn&#39;t have to go empty out their spam folder any more than they had to, but that&#39;s just me. I don&#39;t know if most people even go in there unless they think they missed an automated e-mail they should have gotten.</p>

            <p>Puella means girl, Mulier means woman, Diabola means demon.<br>Most of the Sues I&#39;ve classified are in the BBC Sherlock fandom and are usually young immature brats, hence the genus Puella. Mulier is used for slightly more mature sorts of Sues. Diabola is used for those really annoying and pesky vampire/werewolf/demon sorts of Sues.<br><br>I haven&#39;t had the chance to use Nymphea as a genus yet, but that exists as well, and would be used for elves/faeries/nymphs.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this a bit recently, because I&#39;ve been re-reading a bunch of the <i>Discworld</i> books. While I was reading them, I noticed that there was about one word per book that I didn&#39;t actually know - it was easy enough to guess the meaning from the rest of the sentence, and previously that&#39;s what I would have done. Getting up, finding a dictionary, looking the word up, was  too much of a disruption for me to bother with. But these days, with a smartphone in my pocket, I can look stuff up almost instantly. <br><br>The most recent unknown word that I came across is from <i>Soul Music</i>, and was used when referring to the Unseen University&#39;s organ: plangent. <br><br>Apparently it refers to a sound, and either means &#39;loud and reverberating&#39; or &#39;plaintive; sad&#39;. <br><br>Just wondering, if you come across a word you don&#39;t recognise, do you look it up, or just guess? And what words have you found recently that you didn&#39;t recognise?</p>

            <p>I infer the meanings of words, and have always done so. When I was little, I would ask my mom, and she would tell me to look it up. Naturally, I did no such thing, and ended up increasing my power of inference. It proved useful when taking the SATs.</p>

            <p>If I come across a word I don&#39;t know, I just hold my finger on it, and the dictionary it has loaded onto the device gives me a quick definition of the word. I use it with Discworld a lot too, actually. The good thing is that I know what Prattchet was truly trying to say. The bad thing is, I find I don&#39;t put it to memory well. After all, why memorize it when the definition is a second away? This summer, I have to sit down with a dictionary and just put to memory all those words I should know but don&#39;t.

            <p>Nooo Rhya Nui what are you doing to my first fandom!<br><br>It&#39;s actually decent in terms of description of actions and such, but the Shadowed One is so OOC it hurts. He seemed perfectly fine for a bit, but then the human shows up and he goes &quot;Oh look, someone showed up on my island; I think I&#39;ll inject her with a villainous fetus. None of that questioning or trying to figure out what a fully organic being the like of which hasn&#39;t been seen since Tren Krom&#39;s exile is doing on Odina, nope, fetus-injection time.&quot; And the &quot;Turaga of Colour&quot; that has a name with too many vowels just makes it even dumber. We&#39;ll need to kill her, too, not just because of her non-canon and moronic power scope, but because she was apparently a human named Sherrie who turned into a Toa at some point. Plus, she&#39;s aiding and abetting Rhya Nui, as well as another Sue named Kokua who is apparently a &quot;hybrid&quot; of a Toa and some unknown winged Rahi. Ugh, now I&#39;m getting Custom Bionicle Wiki flashbacks. (takes another bite of Bleepolate)<br><br>It looks like Gearn, Bladair, and Cuife might be recruitable. They seem to have the beginnings of real personality, despite the fact that the story constantly confuses them with each other. Since the author claims that their names are Gaelic translations of insults, at least one of them might want to be renamed, though. A few of the other Dark Hunters might be recruitable as well, but after a few chapters, there are so many Matoran and Toa OCs that most of those should probably just be assimilated into canon, and the ones with gratuitous diacritic-sporting names should be renamed before that.<br><br>Of course, there are those Spirit things to be dealt with, and since the author apparently doesn&#39;t know that Great Spirit is a title given to the mind in charge of upkeep of their universe and not a species or rank, they appear to be literal ghosts. How would one kill a biomechanical ghost? Having biomechanical ghosts doesn&#39;t even make sense!</p>

            <p>Well, since she&#39;s not terribly Sueish aside from the trans-dimensional hopping and a few other comparatively minor problems, most of those related to her ease of adaptation into the Matoran Universe, we might be able to recruit her if she agrees to take glitter reduction therapy.<br><br>Heck, I&#39;m scanning through this now, and in the later chapters, she&#39;s practically the puppet of the principal Sues, Kokua and Anuenue. If we break their hold on her, she might want them dead as much as we do.<br><br>For added &quot;fun&quot;, about half of the OC Toa have anime names. I had suspected it earlier, with the use of Japanese diacritics, but with names like Sheranu and Notegeku, I&#39;m practically certain of it now. When the creation of so many OCs is combined with the fact that Anuenue displaced the Rahaga and the Voya Nui Resistance Team from their proper spots in space-time just to have more characters to toss around, it starts looking like this Suethor has no idea how character distribution is supposed to work.<br><br>Oh, and the Toa-Rahi(&quot;Torahka&quot;, according to the narration) Sue Kokua is silber. That&#39;s not a color I&#39;ve seen often, but she&#39;s unmistakably silber, since she&#39;s described as &quot;silver/blue hybrid&quot; during one of the redundant description segments. I... just... it... no. Where&#39;s my laser cannon?</p>

            <p>When I checked the mission I heard of &quot;silber&quot; from, it said that it was mixed with glose, not blue, for whatever reason, so it wouldn&#39;t apply here. Drat. It&#39;s especially strange, since normally Sue colors tend to stay apart rather than create new Sue colors, but I suppose the decision on its component colors may have just been decided without checking for precedent. Or, possibly, in-universe, since the agents only looked at it for a few seconds before averting their eyes, it could have only <i>looked</i> like it was part glose. Maybe.<br><br>As for the color itself, the color &quot;silber&quot; was derived from a misspelling of &quot;silver&quot;, so I&#39;m pretty sure that it relating to the German world for silver is only a coincidence. It&#39;s good to know, though.</p>

            <p>Then I would guess the agents could recruit her. After all, from what I have seen, she does not seem that bad. It will be interesting to see how it works, as usually it is the main characters who are the Sues. Hmm... Perhaps you could have the main character be a sort of puppet for the Sue to work though. Perhaps the Sue thought that if the focus was on someone else instead of her, the PPC would not kill her, or just ignore her story entirely. Add on being on Quotev, which has the &#39;no cut and paste&#39; thing that is really very annoying, and she feels like she is even more secure against the PPC.<br><br>Wow. I just made the Sue far more clever then she probably should be. Do with my little theory as you wish.</p>

            <p>Herr Wozzeck&#39;s higher-order wraiths were given Latin-sounding scientific names, but Neshomeh&#39;s was called a &quot;ficubus&quot;. I&#39;d need to read Ring Child to find out the traits of Neshomeh&#39;s wraith species, but this one is definitely not a conflictus creatrix or impetus miserabilis, and if this is a new higher-order wraith, which it probably is, it&#39;ll need a name. I also found another new higher-order creature myself in a Pokémon fic that replaces the entire setting with itself (short, but painful story), and that one will need a name, too.

            <p>I did not want to make a separate post to answer a rather simple question, so I&#39;ll just ask it here. It&#39;s about my mission anyway, so it sort of is on the topic.<br><br>The antagonists of the badfic I&#39;m killing (other then the Idiot Ball) are a new race of beings brilliantly named, &quot;griffon/ changeling hybrids.&quot; Besides their blatant uncanon natures, these creatures are in the &quot;griffon kingdom of Griffala,&quot;  which is supposed to be the Griff<i>i</i>n kingdom. Normally, I would say this is a mini, however, it turns out there is a breed of dog called griffons, as well as a species of vulture. My question is, is this a mini and they are still crossed with griffins, or do I have a Diamond Dog kingdom and hybrid race to deal with rather then a Griffin one?</p>

            <p>Griffon is a legitimate spelling of the species name outside of MLP, and the diamond dogs aren&#39;t really connected to any dog breed in particular. Of course, spelling it &quot;griffon&quot; <i>inside</i>of MLP still makes a mini; that was never in question, but it&#39;s not a big enough shift for the Word World to start grasping at straws. Still, even with what I just said, if the story refers to a &quot;griffon&quot; individually and not in &quot;hybrid&quot; form, I think it would be funny to have that vulture show up.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll put this one up at the same time. Still, keep that bit about posting things yourself in mind for the future. Everyone reports badfics, so it&#39;s not something that should be brought up every time you find a new one.

            <p>...the Christianne-Eledhwen dynamic you&#39;ve got going on: they compliment each other perfectly.

            <p>I&#39;m going to start this off by saying I normally don&#39;t like Tolkienverse missions. They&#39;re all the same - crazy fans getting upset over things that I frankly don&#39;t care about. Sure, I like LOTR, but not enough to really get mad about canon breaks and empathize with the agents. I was disappointed in your last mission, because it was...well, I think you&#39;ve heard enough from more articulate people, and I&#39;d rather explain why I loved <i>this</i> mission.<br><br>I like the little bits that indicate the Lemming nature of the fic - the floating pictures, the link that smacks them in the face. Especially Eledhwen&#39;s reaction to the name &quot;polyvore&quot;.<br><br>Also, it was personal, relating to agents&#39; character development, rather than just being fans getting upset. There is the same sort of dialogue, but it makes sense, because Eledhwen is a canon character, technically speaking. That&#39;s pretty awesome, and I think it was handled nicely, what with another extra recognizing her and the SEP field not working. I want to rewatch Return of the King now.<br><br>And finally, the parts you quoted from the badfic made me want the Sue to die. Most particularly how she calls Boromir a &quot;scaredy-cat&quot; after he gives his &quot;one does not simply walk into Mordor&quot; speech, one of my favorite lines. And the gender stereotypes bit - ugh. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just those bits, or it&#39;s the way you&#39;ve handled them (I&#39;m leaning towards a combination of both), but this is the first time I have read a Tolkienverse mission and truly wanted the Sue to die. Even TOS didn&#39;t get that reaction. You are awesome, Lily.  </p>

            <p>I suppose the slight disappointing quality of the previous mission turned out well in the end since it made this one more enjoyable by comparison.

            <p>This mission improves greatly on the last. Araen <i>absolutely</i> got what was coming to her. &quot;You need women to do all the cooking and washing and stuff&quot;? <i>Really? REALLY?</i> I think we need a mention and link to this in the &quot;Gender Card&quot; section of the FAQ For Other People. Also, what was the deal with her making everyone (except Boromir) into cringing wusses who needed her to speak for them? And the vacillation between modern-speak and normal-speak? I think I got a little whiplash just from the quotes—which is good, because it means they demonstrate the problem effectively.{= )<br><br>I also liked the discussions about the agents&#39; backstories. I feel like they arose naturally from the events of the story, and Eledhwen in particular is in a unique and interesting position due to her origin. I think her relationship with Rosalie shows this, though I&#39;m having trouble articulating exactly why. I guess because most Elves in HQ (probably) wouldn&#39;t have a negative reaction to species from other worlds, but Eledhwen has all those past experiences with Sues making her dance on their strings, and that gives her a different outlook. I wonder, does she feel the same way about unicorns, &quot;dark&quot; elves, and other invasive species, or is it nymphs in particular?<br><br>I felt like the reference to Omicron and Cluedo might&#39;ve been a bit much coming right after the one in the last mission, but the repetition might be necessary for future readers to pick up on it as more than a throwaway gag, so probably not that big a deal.<br><br>It&#39;s interesting to see how you&#39;re handling the extra features from the Circle of Lemmings in the mission. The idea of ghostly images floating around the world is just the right touch of creepy and unsettling for me. Personally, I&#39;d replicate the font effects in badfic quotes, but I don&#39;t know how much flexibility you have with that sort of thing on Tumblr. It particularly would&#39;ve helped illustrate the point with the author&#39;s note in the &quot;faux-cryptic voice due to the font of the message in question,&quot; though.<br><br>I really loved the joke about the agents being able to hear Acacia scream all the way from ancient Rome. It&#39;s a great callback to TOS. ^_^ It played less well the second time, though, when you seem to say that Acacia literally knows/senses what&#39;s going on in this particular mission at this particular time and can scream loud enough to resonate through multiple universes. That stretches my suspension of disbelief juuust a bit too far.<br><br>All in all, though, my quibbles are just that, and I really enjoyed this. On behalf of Alice and the nine horses from &quot;Ring Child,&quot; I&#39;d like to welcome Astaldo/Belroch/Marley to the Courtyard herd. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll feel at home in no time. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yeah, Tumblr doesn&#39;t allow much textual difference in the formatting, so I did have to convey the terribleness in words (the faux-cryptic font was Papyrus, btw).<br><br>I think the second mention could&#39;ve been a joke phrased really, really badly, but then again, many Agents do have that whole &quot;oh crap, favourite character being messed with&quot; sort of sense.

            <p>Now that I have the empty Sue item, I can test a little theory of mine. You see, I am not only a Sue item collector, but a bit of a researcher as well. Now, if I add just a little glitter allong the inside...<br><br>There! With the reintroduction of Suevian power to the crystal, the container is able to rejuvenate the missing contents. I suspected as much, as the healing liquid seems to be a &#39;homage&#39; to The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. Lucy used the magic liquid to heal an entire battlefield full of wounded, yet never seemed to run low. Now, logicly, this would be because one needs only a single drop to be healed, and thus can be extended for a long, long time. But, since when have Sues used logic? Therefore, if I reintroduce a lack of logic, the potion will never run dry, as the bottle will forever refill itself.<br><br>Thank you for the bottle. I will have to look more into the practical application of glitter at a later time. As it is, I&#39;m just glad I was able to get my hands on this artifact to test with! Safe travels you two, and don&#39;t let the Sues get to your head.</p>

            <p>It has to be a quick one, since I need to get to bed, but here it is nonetheless!<br><br>I agree with Herr that a few more quotes showing the OC being Sueish would have made this stronger; or else spend a bit more time describing things so that we can see what&#39;s going wrong without a direct quote. Having the characters gripe about it to each other, while certainly a vital component to any mission, isn&#39;t always the best method for telling us about the badfic, since it essentially puts the audience at an extra remove from the action. It especially bugged me that we didn&#39;t see Kestrel woo any undead dwarves, since that was the main problem set out at the beginning of the mission.<br><br>The descriptions you do have are good, though, like the floating eyeballs and the zombie dwarves. I noticed that Eledhwen and Christianne kept it together remarkably well aside from the distortions affecting them, and I do like the inclusion of Bleepolate milk to combat the effects. Yay MiB. I would have been extremely disappointed if no one had incorporated that into the PPC universe. ^<em>^<br><br>Somewhat related, one final note: beware the evil &quot;as&quot;! If left unchecked, it will force your characters to do impossible things like speak and chug at the same time, like so:<br><br><i>“Mini-Balrog up ahead,” the elleth said weakly as she chugged the Bleepolate milk.</i><br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure even the Eldar would have difficulty mastering such an art, having but one mouth, same as us mere mortals. ^</em>~<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think hS/Terri explained it better than I did: the main thing is that the mission needs to show why the OC deserves to be executed as a Sue. If you can do it with seven quotes in five pages, that&#39;s great, but usually it takes a bit more. {= )<br><br>Including too many quotes or otherwise dragging it out too long can be just as much of a problem, though. I personally have a serious issue with writing 30-40 pages of story when 20 (I think) is right around the limit of what people want from most missions. My current one is giving me a particularly terrible time with wanting to quote <i>everything</i>, because 90% is over-the-top and side-splittingly funny without any help from me. Some of the cuts I&#39;ve already chosen make me sad, but so it goes. I&#39;ll have to take the hedge clippers to it when I get to the end as it is.<br><br>Let me just thank you again for reporting &quot;Blood Raining Night,&quot; while I&#39;m on the subject. It&#39;s the badfic that keeps on giving. ^_^<br><br>Anyway, it&#39;s all a balancing act between character development and sporking, between quoting the fic and interpreting it, between showing and telling, between not enough and too much. PPCing is <i>hard</i>.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>When I read that last comment, I immediately went to the Claimed Badfic page to see if there was still a link to Blood Raining Night. What I found was a monument to ridiculous description everywhere. I&#39;m particularly fond of the bit where Inuyasha suffocates ice by staring at Denmark. Even when I adjusted for the poor spelling and awkward phrasing, I still wasn&#39;t sure what the Suethor was trying to say there.  Combining that caliber of nonsensical description with the trademark PPC snark... I can&#39;t wait.</p>

            <p>Really well done Lily, I enjoyed several aspects of the mission, and it was fun to read. The allusions to what was going to happen in the blackout amused me, and while it did not add as much to the blackout as I expected, it did make me laugh, which is good. I liked the reaction of the dwarves to seeing their leaders die again, though if they were not going to be nuralized quite as quickly, I would have liked to see that emotion extend a little. Perhaps I&#39;m just a little desperate for some strong emotion, as the badfic I&#39;m sporking has practically none.<br><br>Well darn, should have jumped on sooner. I was going to nab the mythril, but Dawn has it already. Jumper is a bit of a Dues Ex Machina collector you see, so to have a pendant that allows travel would be something he would have in the collection. Not to use, mind you, but to observe and look at. Oh well, you win some, you lose some.<br><br>I would adopt one of the minis, but I don&#39;t think any of my agents would be interested in a mini Balrog. Jumper would be the most likely, but I&#39;m not sure enough to take one and then have the poor thing neglected. Ah well, feed them all some of this bacon for me, as compensation. *tosses bacon bag*</p>

            <p>... for the launch of OFU<sup>2</sup>!<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AzqDllxu_WJ4lTKvDl10SmWDS3q_3iQNB9DuzTMzYo4/pub">A Welcome Message</a><br><br>Okay, here&#39;s the deal: per discussion further down the Board, it has been decided that the Coordinators of the various OFUs need to come together to discuss, dissect, and potentially destroy the various Sueniversities which have sprung into existence. A Sueniversity (and I believe we have Outhra to thank for the term) is a Fanfiction University - with all the hallmarks of the OFU brand, such as lessons taught by canon characters, cruelty to students, etc etc - which... doesn&#39;t do its job. It&#39;s badly written, it lets the fangirls run riot, the canons are out of character - you get the gist.<br><br>OFU<sup>2</sup> is here to deal with that problem, and staff positions are open to all current or former OFU creators/Course Coordinators/etc. Your Coordinator will join with as many others who care to take part in walking through the Sueniversity (just like a PPC mission - and no, since this is not affiliated directly with the PPC, you don&#39;t need PPC Permission to contribute), discussing and being offended by the events, until eventually they (probably) fling minis at the thing until it burns. As noted in the Welcome Message, it&#39;d be good if you could contribute a few of your own minis to the university.<br><br><u>How will the writing work?</u><br><br>Obviously, this won&#39;t be your standard OFU. There&#39;s no Course Coordinator - no students - and the entire thing is a &#39;film&#39; presented to an unseen audience (although no, present-tense will not be standard). My assumption is that we will basically open up a Google Doc and throw story at the screen to see what sticks. ;) As long as we&#39;re not afraid to edit later, we can probably just work through a summary of the events until someone finds something they want to comment on.<br><br>To do the Google Doc thing, it&#39;d be helpful if you could throw your email address at me... I probably have several already, but if there&#39;s no problem, give them again so&#39;s I can keep track.<br><br><u>What&#39;s our first target?</u><br><br>Since we&#39;ve got a thread and all...<br><br>The three suggested Sueniversities I&#39;ve seen are, in no particular order:<br><br><a href="http://www.lotrfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?sid=13923">The Official Unofficial Fanfiction Academy</a> by ToriLee/gingerlee.<br>Fandoms: About half a dozen.<br>Chapters: Twelve.

            <p>Yes. Yes. Yes. You are using my idea! And I love that! Sueniversities are going to be a bit harder to find than regular badfic, because most badfic writers tend not to read stories making fun of badfic writers, but the OFU²  sporkings are going to be awesome, I can tell. Teaching teaching through pain... through pain!<br><br>While I was looking for another one to post, I found... dun dah dah DAH! <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7589506/1/Official-Fanfiction-University-of-IAHF">An unofficial Fanfiction University about writing fanfiction for the International Institute of Hetalia Fanfiction</a>. Apparently, badfic about IAHF has gotten so bad that someone thought that a recursive Fanfiction University was necessary. Lily Winterwood, I don&#39;t know if, if I was in your situation, I would be proud that I got so much fanfiction or repulsed that so much of it is apparently bad enough to warrant this. The story itself isn&#39;t <u>terribly</u> written compared to the Sueniversities, since it at least seems to have knowledge of the connection between OFUs and pain, but it doesn&#39;t have any minis, treats the prominent Mary Sue invaders like staff members, and apparently thinks it takes place in the Homestuck reality for whatever reason.<br><br>Oh, speaking of minis, would it be possible to use minis for OFU² from any or all of the unfinished or duplicate OFU&#39;s? I&#39;m sure the former OFU-affiliated minis would love having new fanbrats to swarm after so long a lapse, and people who liked the old incomplete OFUs could say &quot;Look, it&#39;s the mini-Deoxys/Deepcoilers/what have you back again!&quot;</p>

            <p>And like I said, the one I linked wasn&#39;t terribly written; I just wanted to bring it up because I thought the recursive Fanfiction University idea was something worth showing people.

            <p>Huh. I&#39;ve not seen trollfic that interrupts its mess of spelling errors to show full-on story, only to jump back into trolling again. Usually, they either never say at all, and the ones that do either state it after the fact or, if they have even less class than the rest of the trollfic writers, wait until the last chapter and say the equivalent of &quot;Ha! You actually fell for it!&quot; It was an interesting idea, PPC Agents infiltrating the whatever-it-is, but it didn&#39;t make it any less painful to look at the interim.<br><br>Wait, was this you, or maybe someone who wanted to back up IAHF, that wrote this? I remember a Sue called Imogene being mentioned as IAHF&#39;s late-game antagonist, and the FFN account that made the fic only has one fanfiction listed on it. Was this intended as Imogene&#39;s origin story? If so, I guess it doesn&#39;t count as trollfic, since trollfic is either trying to make people cry from the canon warping or make them laugh from the ridiculous spellings and actions. What would this be counted as if it was an origin story, but not marked as such?</p>

            <p>So, according to the wiki, trans-dimensional snatching is when canon characters are brought to the Real World, and trans-dimensional hopping is when an OC (from World One/the Real World) ends up in a canon universe. However, what is it called when a Real World person--in this case, an actress--ends up in a canon universe? More specifically, what is this badfic where Jennifer Lawrence turns out to be Penny&#39;s cousin and moves in with Leonard, both of The Big Bang Theory? (Yup, that&#39;s from the Circle of Lemmings. Are you surprised?)<br><br>Is this RPF? Advanced trans-dimensional hopping? A different form of trans-dimensional snatching? Does it fall under the jurisdiction of the PPC at all?<br><br>Just trying to iron out some details. Because, really, Quotev is full of this sort of thing, and it&#39;s making me expand my knowledge and classification of badfic, and I&#39;d like to know what is and what isn&#39;t off-limits to be PPC&#39;d.<br><br>~DawnFire</p>

Usually, this results in or is a symptom of a full crossover, but sometimes it&#39;s only just random characters appearing where they don&#39;t belong, just to please the writer and with little to no mention of what will happen the rest of their world in the absence of its protagonist, which is trans-dimensional snatching at its core.<br>I remember one mission where the agents charged for trans-dimensional snatching by having a brief mention of the Left 4 Dead characters in a sci-fi universe(I think it might have been Star Wars). It was an unconnected continuum, in a different genre, and the snatched characters were never heard from again outside that scene. Textbook, really.<br><br>I think the distinction isn&#39;t so much whether World One is the starting point or the ending point, but rather the method. Trans-dimensional hopping is usually a &quot;this is the only way it&#39;s going to work&quot; story crutch, since otherwise the Mary Sue wouldn&#39;t be able to have knowledge of pizza-making and popular boy bands(not that it stops them), which would cripple the writing style of most Suethors. Trans-dimensional snatching is more a &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if she was here, too?&quot; scenario without the forethought or logical reactions and causes for the transit that would make the appearance of that character halfway plausible.<br><br>In that specific badfic, however, I don&#39;t know if it would be trans-dimensional anything. It would be stupid, undoubtedly, but since The Big Bang Theory exists in a world so close to World One that Will Wheaton and Steve Wozniak not only exist, but appear as themselves in episodes of the show, it&#39;s not out of the question to have Jennifer Lawrence exist.<br>It&#39;s not as though they were saying that her character Katniss Everdeen exists in the The Big Bang Theory continuum, and made <i>her</i> Penny&#39;s cousin, without any of the Hunger Games universe present in anything more than throwaway dialogue. That would definitely be snatching, assuming it doesn&#39;t expand from there and turn into a crossover.<br><br>Giving World One actresses implausible relationships to canon characters <i>is</i> a charge, though, and a major one at that, so I&#39;m not saying drop the idea. Far from it; I&#39;m actually interested to see how a sitcom universe would be PPCed.</p>

            <p>The job of a Despatcher in the Department of Trans-dimensional Snatching was &quot;to return any canon characters who are brought to this world [i.e. the Real World] back to their original location,&quot; according to &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/791153/1/PPC-Tales-from-Despatch">Tales from Despatch</a>.&quot; It&#39;s pretty explicitly about removing abducted fictional characters from World One. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/DTE8.html">Here&#39;s another early example</a>, with DTE Agents Mara and Isaiah.<br><br>The concept of trans-dimensional hopping was apparently added later, and by logical extension I&#39;d say it would apply strictly to people from World One hopping themselves into a canon universe under their own power.<br><br>I think what really distinguishes a hop or snatch from a regular crossover is 1. World One is involved at one end, and 2. the will of the author-insert explicitly causes it to happen; a <i>deus ex machina</i> such as a Fairy Godfather/magical wish may be employed. Note that not all Sues are true author-inserts; most authors aren&#39;t elves living in Middle-earth, for instance. Note also that the author-inserts in the above examples are not harmed, since they&#39;re regarded as real people.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It would be a lot more common to see a Sue snatch a canon to World One than it would be to see them snatch them to another world, but upon reading that DTE mission (Man, it&#39;s been a while since I read the early spin-offs. I really should reread Araeph&#39;s missions, and TOS, while I&#39;m at it.), the same points are made. No consideration is given to how the characters got there, so it&#39;s basically deus ex machina, there is no mention of how their continuum manages without them, and the canons are taken out of their native world by the will of a group of fanbrats.<br><br>Still, I agree with you that it would be very difficult to distinguish a trans-dimensional affair from a crossover if World One wasn&#39;t involved, and I don&#39;t see Despatch getting pulled outside their forté of World One interaction to deal with minor snatchings in an unrelated badfic.<br><br>While we&#39;re on the subject of uncategorized World One affairs, what about the &quot;A dimensional portal drops (canonical location) into OUR WORLD! How will this wacky cast of clichéd characters deal with <u>this</u>? Because I know I saw <i>loads</i> of that back when I primarily read Bionicle fanfiction, and I imagine there are plenty of people who can&#39;t resist pulling Equestria or Rivendell out of their proper place and into the lake a few blocks away from their neighborhood. Never mind where all the water goes, oh no, water isn&#39;t important here. <i>Voya Nui</i> just showed up behind the house!<br>Sorry. I was remembering a particularly bad Bionicle fic there. I&#39;ll get back on topic.<br><br>You said the author-inserts weren&#39;t harmed in the above examples, but Mara and Isaiah fed theirs to Old Man Willow. Is it just Despatch that has no-damage orders? True, the full-on author avatar in that mission was dealt with by taking away the captive Legolas and insulting her, but the inserts were still disposed of in-story by being digested by an enormous tree-creature.<br><br>Also, the Hydrangea appears to be speaking without her italics. Was Tales from Despatch written before that was decided upon? I know I remember reading the Marquis de Sod and Sunflower Official using the italics in the TOS stories, but those could have been added in after the fact.</p>

Big Bang Theory fic needs to be tackled, though: Sheldon is a Lust Object. <i>Sheldon Cooper</i> is a Lust Object. I just can&#39;t believe it.</p>

            <p>I couldn&#39;t remember who wrote the mission, so I couldn&#39;t go back and check before I posted. Now I&#39;m a bit embarrassed, not least because of my Star Trek fandom. At least I got the video game that the snatched characters were from right and didn&#39;t accidentally say Dead Space or something.<br><br>Hmm, neither of my agents-to-be are from World One, they don&#39;t really understand the culture, and they tend to be prone to shocked reactions. Perhaps they could get a Big Bang Theory mission in at some point. It would probably need to be crossed over with something, because otherwise they&#39;d never get the assignment, and jokes about not understanding World One culture tend to fall flat when your characters are implied to have watched a show that makes as many pop-culture references as The Big Bang Theory does.<br>But, considering that I found an ungrammatical mess that for some reason decided to mix the aforementioned with Pokémon after looking for about thirty seconds, I don&#39;t think finding missionable crossovers for it is going to be <u>that</u> difficult.<br><br>I suppose Sheldon Cooper being a Lust Object runs on the same principle as Data being a Lust Object. &quot;Oh he is so witout emotion BUT I CAN HAEL HIM weith love!&quot; is an infamously common plot device amongst Suethors, but usually they use it to uncharacteristically defrost the aloof and disdainful anti-heroes. Characters like Sheldon and Data that give them so much more to subvert must seem like an extra layer of challenge on the Suethor&#39;s scale of Troo Wuv.</p>

            <p>Also, that &#39;Stu not only trans-dimensionally snatched the Left 4 Dead characters, he was also responsible for bringing Alan Turing (the World One genius who invented computers) into Star Trek via a misspelling - and assimilating him.<br><br>For reference, Star Wars got mentioned as well in that mission, given the appearance of a lightsabre.<br><br>Actually, the person who wrote that badfic also wrote one where the same &#39;Stu was in the Left 4 Dead continuum, and presumably the mess my agents dealt with was a continuation.

            <p>What do folks think: Do misspellings in the actual canon also become minis?  As far as I know, the only example of one recognized anywhere is Enjorlas the mini-Brick, which is a typo in the printed <i>Les Misérables</i>, although it may have been made up by Bubonic Woodchuck for UDÉM coincidentally.<br><br>I like to keep track of typos I find when reading.  The <i>Halo</i> novels are chock full of them (and clearly not edited for SPaG).  I noticed Ocs and Iluvatar (with no accent) in my copy of <i>The Silmarillion</i>.  I&#39;ve caught Montage in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> and Kublia Khan in <i>The Judas Strain</i>.<br><br>So, a few questions.  Firstly, and most funly, have folks encountered similar typos in canon as well?  Any funny ones?<br><br>Secondly, do we want to recognize these misspellings as minis?  If so, then thirdly, where do these minis live?  In the corresponding OFU?  In canon itself?  New Caldeonia?  The Twilight Zone?  Yale?<br><br>(For obvious reasons, we would want to avoid creating a new mini type for a &quot;mini&quot; &quot;discovered&quot; this way; they should still only be nameable by someone writing for that fandom.)</p>

            <p>I think that misspellings in a canon have the potential to create minis. Actually recovering them might be a bit tricky, although I can see two ways of that happening:<br><br>1) If agents have noticed typos in the canon, and get sent on a mission into that continuum, then after they&#39;ve dealt with the Sue (or whatever) and the canon has reasserted itself, they could use their RA to try and get to the right point in the source story to recover the mini.<br><br>2) It could just be that PPC HQ is unstable enough that simply reading the misspelled canon would cause a mini to spontaneously form next to the agent reading it (similar to how weird stuff always appears at the Unseen University in <i>Discworld</i>, because it&#39;s the least stable point of reality). I&#39;ve actually got a half-written scene that I&#39;ve had for a little while where that happens, ready to use as part of a future Mission/Interlude if I feel like it.<br><br>I too have found the occasional typo in canons before, and they seem to be more common in slightly obscure sci-fi - I guess the publishing houses that deal with kind of stuff are just smaller and less well equipped? It&#39;s not just limited to sci-fi though, I&#39;m pretty sure that in some of the earlier books in the <i>Wheel of Time</i> series, I&#39;ve seen <i>saidin</i> and <i>saidar</i> (the male and female halves of the main magic system) get mixed up.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of typos in books, though most of them are the non-mini-creating sort. <br><br>I&#39;ve always seen a mini&#39;s intelligence being based on how many times its name would likely be used. For minis of rare or ridiculous misspellings like Caprtsin Jqck Sprow or Asrogron, they would be practically feral. For more easily understood misspellings like James Kurk, they would be intelligent and possibly fully sapient, but still not really reconcilable as intelligent beings to most people. For minis in published works, since their name has spread through the world regardless of the potency of the misspelling that created them, they would gain a large amount of intelligence, as well as a desire to lord their status over the other minis. An &quot;alpha complex&quot;, if you will. Whether the other minis actually would submit to the publishing error depends on the species, of course.<br><br>I briefly toyed with the idea of having my agents meet the mini-Rayquaza &quot;Pokemon&quot;, who is not only printed in a multitude of websites and official works, but has absorbed enough knowledge, largely through cultural osmosis, to be a genius by human standards, even gaining the power of full speech in three languages. All played for laughs, of course, especially since he&#39;d be more eloquent than one of my agents would. I might still do it, since the Pokémon mission I planned is far enough in the future for me to regain the element of surprise.<br><br>Hmm, the &quot;Kublai Khan&quot; misspelling makes me wonder what a Coleridge mini would be. Mini-Honeydews, maybe. He did mention that a lot, and I don&#39;t think we have any minis that take the form of fruit.</p>

            <p>Well, if Suethors are able to create mini-Sues, then I don&#39;t see why canon authors shouldn&#39;t be able to create minis as well. And since minis&#39; forms are dictated by their canon, then Iluvatar (no accent) is a mini-Balrog, whether created by Tolkien or a Suethor.<br><br>However, IMO, I think that that question is purely academic: since PPC agents find minis in the Word Worlds in which said minis are created, and PPC agents cannot go into the Canon World, I find it implausible that an agent would be able to spot such a mini in the first place.</p>

            <p>If a mini exists in the canon world, and a canon world is the basis of fanfiction, any created within a canon world would be accessible through the Word World, would it not? Even the mistakes could be dredged back up.<br><br>A mini-Iluvatar that appeared in a Suethor&#39;s work, by the principle of mini singularity that was apparently decided upon a while back, would be the same mini created by the misspelling in the Silmarillion. To provide a tangential example, I remember a mission that accidentally brought in Garrus Vakarian from Mass Effect due to the misspelling of a canon character named Garruk. The summoning of a mini made in-canon would be no different from dragging a character from another canon into a Word World through accidental textual error.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not a lot different from running a phrase through Google Translate into Greek, and posting that into a story as a Greek phrase. It&#39;s probably going to be wrong, because it&#39;s Google Translate, but you aren&#39;t going to get a bunch of mini-Thetas running up at you for it. A misspelling of a canonical language is the same thing.<br><br>Like Neshomeh said, minis are more for proper nouns than anything. I may be misrecalling the chronology here, but I remember reading several of the first missions to &quot;spawn&quot; minis in-story, and they even had the minis act out the parts of the story assigned to their misspelling. Since the Word World couldn&#39;t actually use a character named &quot;Asrogron&quot;, if a story had Legolas &quot;talk to Asrogron&quot;, it would have Legolas talk to a mini-Balrog that spawned nearby, while Aragorn would stand in the background as the mini aped his lines until his properly spelled name was mentioned again. It was a fun idea, and I&#39;ve occasionally wondered why people stopped doing it.<br><br>If it was just a misspelling in spoken language, it would be more comparable to someone asking to purchase something at a store and instead telling the clerk what sort of fish were inhabiting your hovercraft than to referring to a person or place that was never there.</p>

            <p>I know you&#39;ve heard this multiple times, but I&#39;m going to say it again. Constantly bringing up permission-related things in fresh topics is not going to help you. It is going to associate your name in people&#39;s minds with &quot;is obsessed with getting permission,&quot; rather than &quot;constructively adds to dialogue.&quot; Asking people for concrit once, on the IRC, or as a reply to one of your threads here, is cool. Asking people over and over again, and getting annoyed when they don&#39;t respond, is not cool. Please don&#39;t go hide in a hole now - I&#39;m not trying to be a jerk, or hurt your feelings. It&#39;s just a thing - the PPC is really, really more about community than anything else. Yes, we&#39;re a community built on good-writing, and praising good writing - but the <i>community</i> part comes first. That&#39;s why we ask people to hang out a while before they get permission - not to give them lots of chances to ask questions about permission, but so that they can get to know people, and we can get to know them.<br><br>This is more of an aside, but I&#39;d also note that as a permission giver, you don&#39;t actually <i>have</i> to submit an introduction to your agent as your writing sample. Yes, it can be done, yes it works, yes, it does serve the purpose of proving that you can write characters in-character and understand the PPC... but you can also submit a lot of other stories that prove you&#39;re a good writer - anything with dialogue and a bit of humor will work, really. Don&#39;t feel like you <i>must</i> write a whole new introduction just to get in.<br><br>And don&#39;t feel like this is an attack or trying to push you out, either, please. I know it&#39;s a little overwhelming, jumping into a whole new community - but take your time, we really don&#39;t bite <s>mostly</s> <s>I can&#39;t speak for the zombie squirrels or the animated plushies or the minis</s>, so don&#39;t feel like you have to be pushing your stuff all the time to get accepted. It&#39;s okay to take your time, get to know people, hang out, and apply for permission when it feels right, rather than stressing and obsessing over it for months. In fact, it&#39;s an approach I&#39;d recommend.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m just going to say, it may seem like people get angry at you, but they honestly aren&#39;t really angry.

            <p>I&#39;m not angry. Really! I&#39;m telling you this so that you can avoid making people angry by altering your actions.<br><br>This was, for some years, my only regular community, internet or otherwise. It helps if you understand what is meant by community, I think - a lot of us, myself included, tend to automatically define it as &quot;a group of people excluding myself and everyone I know,&quot; which is... not what I mean. When I say &quot;we&#39;re a community,&quot; I mean &quot;This is a place where generally geeky people hang out and talk about geeky things,&quot; with the added connotation of &quot;a lot of us are friends, and usually people who show up wind up also being friends!&quot;<br><br>So don&#39;t stress out! And don&#39;t chalk your successes down to dumb luck: that way lies madness, or at least sadness. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve seriously pissed anyone off. You ruffled a few feathers a few times, but quite frankly, show me someone in this community who has ruffled no feathers, especially in their newbie days, and I will show you someone who is either lying or very forgetful. Just hang out and talk about geeky stuff with us! That&#39;s basically why we&#39;re here.</p>

            <p>DawnFire recently linked me to a fanfic of Twilight called Luminosity, and its sequel Radiance, both by Alicorn. They&#39;re basically rewrites of the Twilight saga where Bella has a brain and a personality and everything makes sense. I&#39;m wondering how many other PPCers have read it.</p>

            <p>I found that through the wiki a few months back actually, and I really liked it. I did think the author went a little over-board on trying to re-make Bella&#39;s personality, she was just bad in a different way, and now it detrimentally effects just about everyone she runs into. <br><br>I really liked the second book, I loved seeing more personality-wise to the lesser members of the Volturi, and the wolf pack. You should read the twenty or so short stories at the end too, very well done at keeping the characters pretty in character and believable I think, well except Bella and that was the point. </p>

            <p>Interesting idea. XD I&#39;ve not read the fanfics for it, and probably won&#39;t. I read Luminosity because I was curious how it would be different if Bella only had a brain. *watches scarecrow Bella dance about singing* Not because I really had a burning desire to read Twilight fanfiction. ^_^; Though I have pretty much decided that continuum is where my agents will be going on their first mission when I get around to it. *is evil, or maybe just trying to get the worst out of the way first*</p>

            <p>Jay and Acacia&#39;s PPC stories were essentially fanfiction of bad fanfiction, and all of us writing missions based on that are writing fanfiction of their fanfiction of fanfiction.<br><br>Wow, we really <i>are</i> meta. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever actually seen the extent of how many layers this has until now. There might even be another one dealing with the PPC Histories, like Crashing Down and that. If we reference that in our fanficitons of fanfiction of fanfiction, are we dealing with an entirely new layer, or an extension of the third one?<br><br><br>I wonder how a Mary Sue is detected in the Twilight continuum. Since several central characters are gigantic Canon Suvians, does that mean that any Twilight Mary Sue has to be even more Sueish than, say, Bella? Because I&#39;m not sure how much more Sueish than Bella you can get in a continuum that close to World One without venturing into unmitigated troll fiction. Do you know?

            <p>Is a Sue. Also, we are ridiculously meta, and extremely inspired by Discworld. It&#39;s kind of amazing when you uncover new evidence for it.<br><br>I think Twilight Sues are found the same way as Sues in any other continuum; Bella just happens to be a Canon Sue (*sigh*) and the main character. I don&#39;t think OC!Sues have to be measured against her, except possibly in a charge list--&#39;Being more of a Sue than Bella Swan&#39; is a charge, and if it isn&#39;t, then it should be.<br><br>Bella, by the way, has a name that means &#39;Beautiful Swan&#39;. I don&#39;t know how that translates to clumsy, since swans are generally seen as graceful, but let&#39;s face it: her very name is Sue-ish.<br><br>...I have this awful curiosity now of what would happen if a Bella replacement was recruited. I don&#39;t even know what she&#39;d do. I mean, she&#39;d need to change her name so as to avoid prejudice, and she&#39;d need to change her personality fast--although, if she was a replacement, she would have a different personality (or even less of one than she does in canon) anyway, so that might not be an issue. On the other hand, I&#39;m not sure anyone would want to recruit a Bella replacement, unless a Twilight fan does the mission, so...<br><br>Nah. I&#39;ll content myself with sparklepire agents. It&#39;s more fun anyway.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I suppose technically you&#39;re right, we (being in a collective sense) fan-fiction about fan-fiction. Though I never really thought about it that way since it&#39;s not really fan-fiction is it, as we are not fans of the fiction. We are instead fans of the source material who are trying to deal with bad-fic of it in a way that doesn&#39;t cause our heads to spontaneously combust. XD <br><br>That should so be a charge! And clearly Stephenie did not put as much thought in to the naming of her characters as the likes of J.K. Rowling, unless she was shooting for some sort of cliché irony in Bella&#39;s case. That would be an interesting recruitment prospect, I think I agree that any such agent would want to go by a pseudonym, though if she was recruited clearly such an agent would already have a different (or any!) personality since Bella is a Sue to begin with, and I doubt she qualifies as a salvageable Sue as her canon self. Although she&#39;s not really salvageable at this point either, if people were looking for recruitment Bella&#39;s, I did run across a werewolf!Bella in a fic I was considering for saving for my first mission. A real, if not true, werewolf, not a Twilight &quot;werewolf&quot; that is. As in was bitten, turns at the full moon (mostly, apparently extreme stresses can do it as well) and can hear the moon make audible howling sounds to warn of the change...</p>

            <p>... writing for the PPC described as &#39;Monty Python&#39;s Improv Workshop&#39;, which I still think is pretty apt.<br><br>What it means is that a PPC story means taking whatever comes your way, such as:<br><br>-Being absolutely furious at a Mary-Sue ruining the Council of Elrond.<br><br>-Your co-writer making a typo in a common phrase.<br><br>-Your partner ruined your deck of cards<br><br>And, rather than glossing over it, <i>using</i> it (the Improv Workshop part), and putting a distinctly Pythonesque twist on it:<br><br>-<a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission08.html">Making sock puppets to tell the Sue off</a><br><br>-<a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission05.html">&quot;It&#39;s a bit of a maze, unless you haven&#39;t noticed&quot;</a><br><br>-<a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission02.html">Steal some from Saruman!</a><br><br>To use <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=242288;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">your example</a>, while it might be funny once for someone to paint the walls with ketchup, random nonsense does not a good character make - &quot;<a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission16.html">I enjoy pasta, because my house is made of bricks</a>&quot; is not a good personality type.

            <p>It might be better for someone to watch some Monty Python and other bits of British humour before writing for the PPC, because then they&#39;d understand the sort of humour that goes into the PPC in the first place. <br><br>I know I didn&#39;t understand half of the jokes in the TOS when I first read it in sixth grade, but six years, more knowledge/experience, and plenty of British humour later, I can fully appreciate and write in the style of the TOS.</p>

            <p>Oddly enough, though, there are no indications that Jay and Acacia were themselves British. Go figure, eh?<br><br>But yeah, I&#39;d describe the humor in TOS as subtle, sometimes a bit dry, situational, and based on shared references/experiences.

            <p><strike>(But then again Jay also often adopted male personas whenever she could, which I find interesting in my latest reread mostly because I&#39;ve been &#39;round the circuit at Tumblr and more or less come to the conclusion that Jay could&#39;ve been genderfluid, or not identifying as female all the time - but that&#39;s a different matter altogether and I should probably not read too much into it.)</strike><br><br>Since TOS is written in American English and the two of them usually use American slang and words I figure they just consume a lot of British media and it shows in their sense of humour. <br><br>After all, humour of the likes of Python usually require a wider range of knowledge about the world, which is probably the reason why it goes over the average person&#39;s head. It&#39;s easy to laugh at things like bad puns and pratfalls, but it takes more thinking to get one of those sly references.<br><br>I think I now write in more sly references than I ever did before, thanks to this.

            <p>But seriously, though, a genderbender would be an excellent addition to any army. With a wave of xir arm, the enemy forces would suddenly have forcibly rearranged internal anatomies. They would stop, wondering about their sudden changes, possibly feeling a little bit more in tune to their fellow man, or as he is now, fellow woman. When one&#39;s identity can be changed so easily, is it not futile to see the world as requiring only one way of life? Are not their enemies people who, like themselves, are thrust into life not knowing where it will take them? They themselves woke up that very morning men, and were now women. Who is to say that the others were not suffering changes of their own, changes that might make their world turned far more askew than any battle ever would?<br><br>And then, while the invaders are being existentialist, BAM! Rain of arrows. Ironclad strategy.</p>

            <p>Alternate scenario: the invading army, upon being turned into women, cannot properly cope with the new hormones flooding their system and turn into an enraged mass of estrogen-fueled destruction. They surge forward, weapons held high, intent on destruction. Every sexist comment they have ever heard or said suddenly comes to mind and furthers their anger, for as they are women now, they clearly don&#39;t want to be seen as inferior.<br><br>When the dust settles, only women remain alive on both sides. They form a pact - to create a sovereign state of women, by women, for women, where all men are met with death and despair. Their armies sweep across the globe, and in their wake is liberation for the oppressed females. Men are delegated to menial work, minding children and doing physical labor.<br><br>And in the end, women rule the world. And it is good.</p>

            <p>The Badfic Game is basically a weekish-long &#39;Pretend To Be A Badfic Author&#39; game. Some people use that to write one long story (or, in my case, one chapter of a long story); others churn out four or five of the things.<br><br>A few other things worth noting:<br><br>-Not everything you write for FfW has to be bad. Someone wrote a very long very-AU PPC story last time, and actually I think the very first game featured Starwind writing a &#39;good-but-too-high-rated-for-the-PPC&#39; story.<br><br>-Given that we&#39;re playing at being PPC fanfic writers, anyone else&#39;s characters (with the usual exception of Stormsong and Skyfire) are fair game. After all, you&#39;re /writing fanfic of them/ - liek, how can tEhy complain??? Immitashun is the best form of thinggy!<br><br>--Leading off that, it can actually be a good place to explore things you wish had happened. If you think that Jay and Acacia&#39;s relationship was fraught with UST* - or that Dafydd Illian was secretly gay** - or that Lux is suffering from depression*** - well, you can&#39;t write it as a PPC story, but FanficWorld is the perfect place...<br><br>*It wasn&#39;t.<br>**He wasn&#39;t.<br>***She really isn&#39;t.<br><br>-As my FfW persona JayBird demonstrates, your name doesn&#39;t have to refer to your Board name - though if you find it funny, that&#39;s fine too.<br><br>-You can have multiple pennames. This is mostly for people who want a fanthing persona to write with, and a scathing/something else penname to review under. The reviews are half the fun.<br><br>-Probably-obvious fact, but the FfW website is a nonfunctional archive. All stories, profiles and reviews are done on this Board, and transferred by me (which is why I rarely write very much).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And deceptively simple to answer. I think &quot;quirky/zany/silliness&quot; is a good definition of PPC insanity, but it takes a lot of different forms, and not all agents have it to the same degree. Also, they&#39;re only &quot;insane&quot; relative to us here in the real world. In HQ, the quirkiness of agents is the norm; it&#39;s the saner ones who are weird.<br><br>Whatever it looks like, I think it&#39;s important because it&#39;s the thing that allows the agents to laugh and carry on in the face of surreal, illogical, and sometimes disgusting things that would otherwise wear them down, make them give up, or tip them over the edge into homicidal rage (a.k.a. &quot;flamethrower-crazy&quot;). If you or I saw someone with a literal &quot;head of fire,&quot; to make up an example, we&#39;d probably freak out and call emergency services. The average PPC agent would just break out the marshmallows.<br><br>In a more meta sense, it&#39;s important because it&#39;s a device that lets us make jokes about bad writing instead of just raging at it. Laughing is fun; being angry isn&#39;t. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well, the way I see it, PPC Insanity is sort of quirky zany crazyness. It&#39;s making castles out of bread, or making your entire RC a pillow fort &quot;just because&quot;. <br><br>It&#39;s important, because that&#39;s one of the main points of the ppc. Sometimes, when The Words take something literally, it can be horrifying, but most of the time, it should be silly. Like, if a description lists everything except pants, the character won&#39;t be wearing any.</p>

            <p>...Making them do funny things because they&#39;re funny?<br><br>Making a character do something &quot;just because&quot; is something I usually try to avoid as much as possible while writing, as it seems like a bit of an excuse to me when I think about it. I prefer things having a reason rather than them happening just because it would be funny if... I don&#39;t know, someone started painting the walls with ketchup, or something.</p>

            <p>The New MM&#39;s going for a more journalistic approach, which means there&#39;s more truths and less speculation.

            <p>Well, all right, I agree if we&#39;re talking about the graphic design and layout work (but then again, the latter is due to it being a PDF rather than HTML...).<br><br>But the content? I don&#39;t think you can even compare the two. Your Multiverse Monitor was a tabloid, and as a tabloid it worked brilliantly - it was filled with filthy lies from cover to cover. :P This version is a magazine, and again, as a magazine it works brilliantly - it&#39;s pretty and informative. But it doesn&#39;t have the off-the-wall gossip-rag vibe yours did - because it&#39;s not supposed to. Saying one is better is like comparing apples and submarines.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m really impressed with the layout of it - it seemed like a real magazine. And, of course, the articles. So serious, yet, being PPC, so funny. This balance of magazine format and PPC craziness is so awesome. I kind of feel bad that I didn&#39;t help, but GDocs was being annoying (read: I knew nothing, and didn&#39;t want to touch it).<br><br>So yeah. *applause*</p>

            <p>That was wonderful! Can&#39;t wait for the next issue, once I get my agents in line I might like to contribute at some point. The only thing was I had a horrible time figuring out how to read the &quot;Simply Magical&quot; article. It appears to read in Manga fashion (columns read right to left) on the first page, and switch to American fashion (columns read left to right) on the second page. And I&#39;m not sure that the first column on the second page is next after the first column on the first page, but it could also come after the second column on the first page. I appear to be the only one that had this problem, so maybe it&#39;s just me, but I thought I would point it out... ^^; The article does make sense no matter what order the middle three columns (seeing as there are two that either have a definite beginning or end place for the article) are read in, so it&#39;s not a huge issue...</p>

            <p>Although, first of all, one thing: I found a mini! Say hello to Hercules Poirot! Lovely little fellow; no idea what his form is, but he seems quite nice, very smart. No doubt he follows in the footsteps of his canon character, the great detective, M. Hercule Poirot. Quite a lovely mini; I may keep him, if I can find out what he&#39;s supposed to look like (amorphous minis are a bit disconcerting to look at).<br><br>Second...ok, I brought this on myself. I&#39;m retconning something about the Reader. Unfortunately, this is currently spoilers, so I can&#39;t actually clarify until I&#39;ve reached the reveal in the Blackout Interlude, but suffice it to say that I&#39;ll probably contribute an article dealing with the subject to the next MM issue, if that&#39;s alright.<br><br>Other than that...so.
