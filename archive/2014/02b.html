            <p>I once made a post on Tumblr that became insanely popular about bad fanfiction being like a Kids Bop cover of your favourite song.<br><br>Now I&#39;m thinking of expanding the analogy. If a bad cover is like bad fanfiction, would a mash up be considered a crossover? Would a cover of a song that changes the tempo or style (like a really sad acoustic cover of &quot;500 Miles&quot; by the Proclaimers) be an AU? Would a John Barrowman cover of any given love song (or any cover artist who doesn&#39;t change the pronouns in a song&#39;s lyrics) be slash?<br><br>Just wondering. <br></p>

            <p>Woo. As an audiophilic fanfiction writer, this interests me highly. I haven&#39;t read the Tumblr, so excuse me if this was addressed, but what about remixes? Would that be Alternative Character Interpretation, Character Derailment, or Mary Sue? Perhaps that would depend on how it was handled- after all, these things are up in the air themselves, and so are remixes- either you love it or you hate it, just like with those character conventions, you either consider them acceptable or unacceptable. (Sad that Mary Sues are acceptable, but that&#39;s just how it is. That&#39;s why this site exists, after all.)<br><br>Or remixes could also be like the Seventh Sanctum generators where it&#39;s like &quot;your favorite characters if they were like this&quot; or &quot;if they were in this setting&quot;. </p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Ozerbord.png"><br><br><u>Geography</u><br><br>Batveg Mountains - The range of mountains which divides Ozerbord in two. The Spalchik Lowlands, to the north, are significantly higher than the Geymez Plateau to the south. No-one is quite clear on why the names are the way round they are, though rumours abound of drunken parties in the castle Jenerel&#39;stor during the time of Baron Leto.<br><br>Bulapka, Font of - Lake, Refuge of Ozerbord. The only body of water of any size in Ozerbord, the Font of Bulapka was famously the goal of the Quest of the Five in the early days of the Triumvirate. It was thus the cause of the first expedition beyond the Wattuf Mtns. On its shores stands the ancient castle Jenerel&#39;stor, once the seat of Baron Leto. The waters of Bulapka are rumoured to have healing properties - or, according to some, the power to erase memories.<br><br>Friwep - River, Protectorate of Borrd. Flowing down from the Hustit Range to the Gu-Gel, the Friwep is said to have once been a mighty torrent. These days, it is barely more than a stream.<br><br>Geymez Plateau - The southern lowlands of Ozerbord, bounded by the Batveg and Wattuf mountains. The city Ozerbord stands here, and when Ozerbord is used as a refuge, the Plateau is filled with tent cities. At other times, the tents are held in Ozerbord City - except when they are brought out for festivals.<br><br>Gu-Gel - River, Protectorate of Borrd. Formed at the joining of the rivers Wep and Friwep, Gu-Gel marks the eastern boundary of the barony of Huinesoron. It is known for its boat people, who sail up and down, searching the currents for anything that might be of use. Due to their living outside the baronies proper, they also serve as Borrd&#39;s unofficial banking service - the security of their vaults is famous, though they do ask a lot of personal questions...<br><br>Hustit Range - The eastern branch of the northern Wattuf Mountains. The question of whether Ozerbord&#39;s border should follow the Wattufs or the Hustits was a contentuous one when the Union of Plort was being organised.<br><br>Obref Chain - The southern branch of the Mountains of Reverence, the Obrefs form part of the border between Borrd and Wechi. There are said to be many paths through them which can only be found by those in the know.<br><br>Reverence, Mountains of - Branching off the Wattuf Mountains, the Mountains of Reverence are named for the old tradition of journeying there to give thanks after a pilgrimage to the Permeshun Range. It is said that each mountain resembles another in the Marizu lands, and that the mountain a knight climbs will determine his or her destiny.<br><br>Spalchik Lowlands - The northern highlands of Ozerbord. Despite the lack of a large city, Spalchik actually has a higher population than the Geymez Plateau.<br><br>Wattuf Mountains - The range which forms the border of Ozerbord. In the early days of Plort, it was deemed impassible, until the Quest of the Five climbed over the range in search of the fabled Font of Bulapka. Nowadays, elderly ladies wander across the range to see their grandchildren.<br><br>Wep - River, Protectorate of Borrd. The Wep forms a large stretch of the boundary between the baronies of Huinesoron and Phobos. Where it meets the Friwep to form the Gu-Gel, the ancient city of Odolotos can be found.<br><br><u>Settlements</u><br><br>Critta&#39; - Town, Protectorate of Borrd. A small town founded by Dark Civilian Aakmal as an industrial hub on the Gu-Gel.<br><br>Ozerbord - City, Refuge of Ozerbord. The capital city and only major population centre in Ozerbord, the city would likely be called a town in any other nation. Many of its buildings stand empty most of the year, accomodation for those who visit for festivities. The annual Games of Batveg are held here, in the shadow of the Batveg Mountains.<br><br>Risersh - Town, Protectorate of Borrd. The southernmost town in Borrd, Risersh serves as both a centre for the mining operations south of the Mountains of Reverence, and as an illicit trade route with Wechi across the Obref Range.<br><br>Sparbor - Town, Refuge of Ozerbord. One of the &#39;twin towns&#39;, Sparbor was once larger than Ozerbord, but has declined much in recent times.<br><br>Teebor - Town, Refuge of Ozerbord. One of the &#39;twin towns&#39;, Teebor tends to experience bursts of population growth, followed by rapid decline. Its buildings are designed to echo the architecture of the city of Borrd.<br><br><u>Castles &amp; Landmarks</u><br><br>Calbek Mine - Mine, Protectorate of Borrd. One of the three great mines which provide the knights of Plorrt with metal for their arms and armour. The disposition of the mines was a source of major contention during the founding of the Refuge of Ozerbord.<br><br>Jenerel&#39;stor - Castle, Refuge of Ozerbord. Jenerel&#39;stor was once the seat of Baron Leto, and was the first building founded beyond the Wattuf Mountains. It sits by the fabled Font of Bulapka, whose waters are rumoured to have healing properties - or, according to some, the power to erase memories.<br><br>Kwenaya - Castle, Refuge of Ozerbord. In this castle dwells Baron Huinesoron, with the fair Kaitlyn, knight of the legendary and defunct Order of the Knights Who Go ^-^. It is said that Kwenaya holds a vast collection of arms and armour from those knights who have departed Plort, or fallen in battle, and that when he goes to war, Baron Huinesoron often bears such arms, in memory and honour of the lost.<br><br>Maklaur - Castle, Refuge of Ozerbord. Former seat of Baron BeautyID, Maklaur lies in southern Ozerbord. Its beautiful orchards are tended by a large number of servants, for the former Baron has a habit of returning unexpectedly for visits.<br><br>Trevaya Mine - Mine, Protectorate of Borrd. One of the three great mines which provide the knights of Plorrt with metal for their arms and armour.

            <p>It seems fitting that the uplands are lowlands and the lowlands are plateaus on the other side of the Wattuf Mountains.<br><br>I like the mines. We&#39;ll have to come up with some sort of treaty or trade agreement with regards to those. Also, there might need to be a fourth one called Waibek Mashin or just Waibek somewhere, possibly in Wechi, since we get so much out of it.<br><br>Speaking of which, is the bit of mountain range that passes into Wechi a continuation of the Mountains of Reverence, or something else? Maybe that could be the Waibek Chain and there could be a mine in it called Waibek Mashin...<br><br>Also, almost everything I was unsure about got explained, but I&#39;m still wondering if Hustit is &quot;hosted&quot; or &quot;host-it&quot; or something else entirely...?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>We have so many puns already, though, and when is the next chance we&#39;d get to have our cross-canon counterparts fight pirate robots? The robots might be... let&#39;s see... stealing the gold from Waibek to pay the enemies of Plort to give them mechanical upgrades.<br><br>Expanding on that: the robot pirates could be derived from the ancient Spambots, creatures that rose from the far south in the days when Baron Rohirric Monkey still ruled and overran Konti-Nyuum, creating the Ypurs to serve as their pack animals from the organic material that they could shape to their purpose. Plort would have launched numerous counter-attacks, basing their assault from the new Refuge of Ozerbord, eventually driving the Spambots back, but a few of the dread machines survived, choosing to alter their prime directive. They would be unable to overrun the land in their present state and with their present numbers, but through their piracy, they might be able to regain the resources to restore a fraction of their lost power. The Ypurs survived the assaults, as they were deemed only innocent dumb beasts, and they became a not-uncommon sight roaming the flatter lands of Borrd, though some were later captured and used as mounts for the trolls when that ghastly species decided to invade Plort at the behest of the Marizu <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFoRXDPMJ2HKR_HfxDl4ihYPNN1qvnjAj3fFVPWSb3c/pub">in this invasion from the Google Doc</a>.<br>Also, according to that Google Doc, Ypurs may be capable of breathing both air and water, since the trolls ride them out of the depths of the ocean during the beginnings of their attack. I don&#39;t know where that came from, but hey, they&#39;re already massive blue yak-things derived from the depredation of spambots, so why not make them amphibious? It at least distinguishes them from common mammals.</p>

            <p>In times long past there lived in a distant land far to the south a scholar and bard named Ælcalen. Tiring of his studies, he left his home in search of new lands to explore. <br><br>Evil chance led his wanderings to the Empire of Fanvik-Neht, where he narrowly escaped capture by the forces of Emperor Xing. Fleeing, he wandered into the wild, until by chance he discovered a secret refuge high in the hills - the fabled Hanathanun. In this high valley Ælcalen rested from his labours and bided his time reading tales of the Kingdom of Medullurth. Amongst the scattered leaves in the library of Hanathanun Ælcalen found a brief account of the exploits of Jay and Acacia and of the far land of Plort.<br><br>Intrigued by these tales, Ælcalen set out to find this distant land. Taking a ship out of El-Jhey, Ælcalen made port in the city of Borrd and set out to explore the land of Plort.<br><br>Ælcalen arrived on the island during a time of relative peace and stability - Cam and Bast had not yet departed and many of the fabled knights of Plort still frequented the courts and fountains of Borrd. Inspired by these heroes of renown, Ælcalen trained in feats of errantry and enlisted with the forces of Plort sailing on an expedition against the Kingdom of Lotor. Ælcalen joined a company of brave companions known as the &quot;Midylbees&quot;, young eager for battle, although sadly few returned to Plort - or those that did soon departed for other lands, unable to find rest on the isle of Konti-Nyuum. The archives of Wechi contain a roll of their honourable names and deeds: the warrior maidens Niscang&#39;el, Æris and Kiwi, mighty in song.<br><br>No tale now records who knighted Ælcalen, but in the fighting in Lotor he found honour by killing the dreaded Marizu warlord known only as the Scarlet Maiden in single combat wielding the renowned sword Lo&#39;gann. <br><br>Upon returning to Plort, Ælcalen put away his sword - for now - and settled into life in Plort. Ælcalen chose to dwell in the marches between El-jheycom and Borrd in the mead-hall L&#39;Urque, but he travelled often to the festivals of Plort, including the Shipfest and the festivities of Filling the Plothole.<br><br>These days Ælcalen rides rarely to war - although the sword Lo&#39;gann remains sharp and ready should need arise - but travels the world, voyaging even unto the Scholar&#39;s Empire in search of new lands, leaving the hall L&#39;Urque empty sometimes for months on end.<br><br>When in Plort, Ælcalen stays mainly at home in L&#39;Urque, resting from his travels and attending to his kennels filled with wondrous creatures called &quot;manguese&quot; which he bestows upon newcomers to Plort. <br><br>L&#39;Urque&#39;s location on the boundaries of Borrd and Wechi means Ælcalen travels often search the fabled archives of Baron Neshomeh as he does to the bustling city of Borrd.<br><br>Wherever he travels, though, he is sure to return to Borrd for his customary role as herald of the great spring festival of Donning the Lilac, in which the citizens of Borrd wear garlands of lilac flowers and carry ells of rich damask or samite and parade through the streets of Borrd. Often Ælcalen is the first citizen of Borrd to begin the festivities.<br><br>Although Ælcalen is now one of the longest-dwelling residents of Konti-Nyuum, he is content living a simple life of freedom in his hall of L&#39;Urque or travelling the lands of Plort.<br><br>Elcalion</p>

            <p>The LJ post is an awesome find too, but I like how the presentation&#39;s showing the changes slide by slide gives an impression of the place having history to it.

            <p>I just want to warn you that I&#39;m working on some cyclopaedia entries for you concerning the geographical features and landmarks of Wechi.

            <p><i>Of the Commonwealth of Wechi, Being a Select Compendium of its Geography and Notable Landmarks</i><br><br>Wechi, Commonwealth of - Nation. The Commonwealth of Wechi is a scholarly nation, high in the mountains. It is governed, in theory, by pure democracy — every decision is made by popular vote of the inhabitants. In practice, given the difficulty of such frequent elections, Baron Neshomeh makes the decisions until someone disagrees with her. Wechi honors the Constitution of Plort as well as its own particular mores and folkways. Its inhabitants worship many of the same gods as others in Plort, including Spelin and Kanun, as well as the just and powerful Gods of Wechi-Ah.<br><br>    Wechi is dominated by mountains and highland moors. Since the opening of the harbor at Mei&#39;n Payj, there is a good deal of traffic along the Hyparlink Trade Road, but away from the Hyparlink and the major rivers, Wechi remains somewhat wild and untamed despite efforts to lay down common roads and other infrastructure. The Larninkurv highlands are daunting to those who have never journeyed there before, and only a hardy few make their homes amid the wide, lonely moors. Even Baron Neshomeh&#39;s beloved husband, Phobos, rarely visits her in the remote highland castle of Arkive.<br><br>    And yet, Wechi is a land of rugged beauty, and tales tell of marvelous visions that travelers behold on the moors. It is said that the native Wechians, known amongst themselves as Eddataurs, build stone monuments to the knights of Plort in the wilderness so that future generations might know of their glory. The knights of Plort are invited to visit and style their own shrines to their liking, but few find their way through the rough, undeveloped country.<br><br><br><u>Mountains, Rivers, and Forests</u><br><br>Blulenc - River, Commonwealth of Wechi. This eastern tributary of the River Navbah flows from the Auksidentym Chain in a winding course through the Rhedlenc Mire, where the unwary may founder.<br><br>Kattekri-tri - River, Commonwealth of Wechi. This western tributary of the River Navbah is wide and inviting at its junction with the Navbah, but higher up it wanders in many streams that often cross each other. It is not unknown for travelers on the Kattekri-tri to wander in circles for days before finding the main course again.<br><br>Larninkurv Mountains - Mountain range, Protectorate of Borrd and Commonwealth of Wechi. This steep range stretches from the southernmost peninsula of Wechi across Konti-Nyuum&#39;s girth to the northernmost point of Baron Araeph&#39;s domain in Borrd. Anyone who wants to get ahead in Plort must surmount the Larninkurvs eventually, especially if they come through Wechi or Iric first.<br><br>Lhawgin Heights - Mountain range, Protectorate of Borrd and Commonwealth of Wechi. A small mountain chain that branches off the Larninkurv Mountains north of Andbuc. A portion of Wechi&#39;s border with Borrd follows this chain.<br><br>Lhawjeck - River, Protectorate of Borrd and Commonwealth of Wechi. The River Lhawjeck flows through the Umor Woods and forms part of Wechi&#39;s border with Borrd.<br><br>Navbah - River, Commonwealth of Wechi. This river flows south from Larninkurv Mountains down to the sea. The harbor at its mouth is the only passage into Wechi from the south.<br><br>Raeltym Mountains - Mountain range, Protectorate of Borrd, Republic of Iric, and Commonwealth of Wechi. A long, forked chain that branches off the Larninkurvs to the east and arcs southward, where it splits into the Auksidentym Chain and the Auriantym Chain. The Castle Fanvik lies between the two branches. The upper Raeltyms and the Auriantym Chain define part of Wechi&#39;s border with Borrd and Iric, respectively.<br><br>Rhedlenc Mire - Bog, Commonwealth of Wechi. Fed by the River Blulenc on its journey to the River Navbah, this land is treacherous to the unwary, yet some of the most fertile in Wechi. The native Eddataurs encourage settling and cultivating here to limit the spread of the mire.<br><br>Turaipod Heights - Mountain range, Commonwealth of Wechi. This small mountain chain branches off the Larninkurvs to the east of the Castle Arkive.<br><br><br><u>Settlements, Castles, and Landmarks</u><br><br>Andbuc - City, Commonwealth of Wechi. Formerly part of Borrd. This quaint city, distinguished by its shell pink and teal roofing tiles, was founded by the Baron Nenya and her noble sister, Rosie. Nenya&#39;s baronial seat, the Castle Kwendi, and the Glausarie Library are located here. Sadly, Andbuc suffered heavy losses in the Great Jheyostie Plague and never quite recovered, despite the aid sent to them from Arkive.<br><br>Arkive - Castle, Commonwealth of Wechi. The baronial seat of Neshomeh, Arkive sits alone in the highlands between the Larninkurv Mountains and the Turaipod Heights. Despite its imposing facade of smooth gray mountain stone, the doors of Arkive are always open to visitors of good will. Within are the Hall of Ancient Records, Neshomeh&#39;s personal library, and the Hall of Song, where Neshomeh holds the merry Festival of Filk each midwinter.<br><br>Glausarie - Library, Andboc, Commonwealth of Wechi. This is one of the oldest of Wechi&#39;s libraries. Its first wing was built in the days of Baron Nenya. It has since been expanded by Baron Neshomeh.<br><br>Hautew Gyd - Library, Mei&#39;n Payj, Commonwealth of Wechi. This library-cum-cultural center was founded to aid newcomers to Konti-Nyuum in familiarizing themselves with the laws and customs of the land. <br><br>Lhyst - Library, Manyuel, Commonwealth of Wechi. The Great Library of Lhyst is one of the largest and most frequented in Wechi. It has two large wings.<br><br>    The Vixion Wing is devoted entirely to historical tales: tales of the Protectorate of Plort, tales of the Marizu, and tales of other faraway lands can all be found here. These records are much sought after by those who wish to study the strategies of knights who came before them or to familiarize themselves with the foul workings of the enemy so as to strike at them more precisely.<br><br>    The Efrydding Wing is the larger of the two, and it is divided into three parts: the Hall of Folk, the Hall of Steddings, and the Hall of Mathoms. Here one can study just about all there is on record of the people, land, and artifacts of Konti-Nyuum.<br><br>Manyuel - City, Commonwealth of Wechi. Manyuel was founded by Huinesoron the Historian with the aid of Neshomeh and her skill with Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl. The Great Library of Lhyst is located here. The Hyparlink Road passes through Manyuel on its way north to the Larninkurv Mountains.<br><br>Mei&#39;n Payj - Port town, Commonwealth of Wechi. In the past, Wechi was nigh unreachable from the sea, but gradually, hardworking Wechians (known amongst themselves as Eddataurs) cleared the reefs around the mouth of the River Navbah and founded the port of Mei&#39;n Payj. Here begins the Hyparlink Road that follows the River Navbah north through Manyuel, to the Larninkurv Mountains, through Vaekew, and on to Borrd.<br><br><br>(( Whew! So there&#39;s that, then. I hope it makes sense, and I hope it&#39;s somewhat entertaining. I had fun coming up with it, at least. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh ))</p>

            <p>-Doc Filth was mostly on the old Chat, I think. He came to the <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/OxfordGath.htm">Oxford Gathering</a>, but I&#39;d never heard of him before that.

            <p>The tale of Storme of Hauk, starts in the far lands of Are-Pea, where he tended a tiny city-state and was known as Auran the Blazing. A young man at the time Storme knew not of the threat that is the Marizu, instead enjoying the multitude of contests and games that often occurred between the various city-states in that part of Are-Pea. However, Storme soon grew bored of these contests and games, and handing his lands over to an old friend and fellow ruler of a neighbouring city-state he took leave, journeying beyond the nation-state that had always been his home and off into thee other lands of Are-Pea and beyond. <br><br>It was in the lands of Fanvik-Neht that he appeared next, spending some time wandering freely in those lands before settling down in a small keep which he named after himself and his old city-state. Still innocent and unaware of the Marizu and the danger that they beheld Storme began to get acquainted with his new lands. It was a short time later that a small warband of Marizu ended up in his land, asking for shelter and a place to stay for a small while. Seeing no reason as to why not, Storme allowed them to stay. However things do not last forever and soon Storme started to become weary of the warband. It was because of this that Storme started to research the Marizu, taking a long trip to Tivit to study up on them in the great libraries they held there. It was here that he first learnt of the Union of Plorrt, although unlike others he did not travel upon the Hyparlink trade route instead, now knowing the true horror of what was in his lands in Fanvik-Neht he decided to return to his homeland in Are-Pea. <br><br>Whilst his homeland had changed drastically from when he had left, and many of his old friends had either been replaced or had withdrawn from the normal contests that he had competed against and with them in, Storme was still welcomed back, and here he lived once again for a small while in peace and happiness.<br><br>Eventually Storme remembered that he had to face off against the Marizu that had, by now, no doubt taken over his land or die trying. Bidding farewell to his friends in Are-Pea, he said to them “Now I ride back to Fanvik-Neht to fix my mistakes, my road is long and arduous and I may not see you again.” With that he rode off upon the finest horse from his city-state, his armour, sword and shield sparkling in the night.<br><br>Upon returning to Fanvik-Neht and his lands Storme allowed himself a sigh of relief, his worst thoughts and not come to being and his lands still held some semblance of what they had looked like when he had left. Setting up camp just inside his borders Storme waited until he and his horse were rested before they carried on to the Marizu camp. Spotting it, now standing right outside his keep Storme drew his sword and his shield, and with no cry of battle thundered into the Marizu camp, intent on slaying them all.<br><br>In the end the Marizu were beaten back, but at a cost, beaten and bloodied Storme dragged himself into his keep, his armour was broke, his shield useless and broken beyond all recognition, his sword snapped and his horse lying dead amongst the few Marizu he had killed. Swearing revenge against Thawne, the leader of the warband who had managed to escape, and the rest of the Mariu still alive Storme locked himself away whilst he healed and brooded and planned what he was going to do next. <br><br>It was after a warm summer’s night that he decided to travel to Plorrt and aid in their crusades against the Marizu. Taking the long and potentially dangerous journey by himself Storme eventually landed in Wechi, where he renounced his old name, taking on his current name instead swearing that whatever damage he had done as Auran he would undo as Storme. Intent on moving into Borrd Storme moved through Wechi, stopping at each town on his way to pick up more information that he could use when his time came to confront the Marizu, sometimes even chasing scraps and rumours of information that caused him to deviate from his original route.<br><br>Arriving in the lands of Baron Phobos, in the nation of Borrd he was met as most are with a shower of gifts and warm words of welcome. Settling in a small town in the hills to the north of the Gudryting River by the name of Hauk, it was not long before he started to prepare for his pilgrimage to become recognized as a knight.<br><br>On his first attempt at the pilgrimage he was unable to ford either the Graymar or the Ponchuashun and as such turned back and never quite reached the Permeshun Range. Unlike in the past where such failures would cause him to withdraw from the world, Storme continued to train and improve himself, before on his second attempt succeeding in his mission to travel up to the Permeshun Range. Journeying back to Cokirt Storme was approved by the Baron and became a knight. However for his own reasons Storme does not truly recognize this title, still referring to himself as a Squire until he truly recognizes that he has become a knight.  With bow in hand Storme prepares himself for his first raid against the Marizu, hoping he will prevail and be able to do as he swore and eliminate Thawne and his band of Marizu. <br><br>[Wow, I didn&#39;t mean for it to be this long.]<br>[Storme Hawk]</p>

            <p><i>... who refuses to write her own, so I did it for her.</i><br><br>Out of the Magedom of Yung Wi-Sods, before its fall to the Marizu horde, wandered the woman known as Kaitlyn. She travelled into the wide lands of Fanvik-Neht, and there she came upon the fair Castle Harpwire. From within its marble walls she watched the riding forth of the famous knights Jay and Acacia, and heard the tales of their exploits told and retold, and welcomed them joyously on their return.<br><br>And when, on an overcast night, the forces of Fanvik-Neht came upon Castle Harpwire and tore down its walls, Kaitlyn was one of those cast out into the biting rain, exiled by force from her home, and by her own choice from Fanvik-Neht.<br><br>She followed for a time the wandering knight Cam and her mobile war-camp Ofum, and revelled in their campaigns against the Marizu in the Kingdom of Lotor, but became lost in the northern wastes. There she encountered the fabled Blue Knight, and joined the quest for the idol of Emestee, but forsook the journey before its end. At last she reached the northern shore, and set sail for an island she had heard rumour of - the island where the camp Ofum had permanently settled, and to which the Blue Knight had returned with the idol - the island of Konti-Nyuum.<br><br>Joyous reunions there were in the streets of Borrd, and Kaitlyn became a regular sight in the Castle Otik, resplendant and beautiful as Harpwire before its fall. She became fast friends with the Paladin Thalia, and was knighted indeed. She rode to battle with Jay and Acacia’s war-bands, but out of duty, not enthusiasm: her love lay rather in healing, and the arts of Beytah.<br><br>Through all the events of the Elder Days - the sealing of Castle Otik, the secession of Chaett - Kaitlyn lived in contentment in the city Borrd. She travelled oft into the south, visiting her friend Thalia in her castle Fanvik - and she was there when the news broke of Thalia’s betrayal. In the trial that followed, Kaitlyn defended her friend - but when the truth was all known, she could not bring herself to follow Thalia into exile.<br><br>Rather, Kaitlyn befriended the newcomer Huinesoron, who had been granted possession of the Fanvik Whirl (though not of Fanvik castle itself). When the memories of Fanvik became too much for her, Kaitlyn removed to the city Vaekew - and extended an invitation for Huinesoron to follow her.<br><br>They abode there, in houses close together, when the fledgling nation of El-Jheycom declared its independance. Forsaking the city of Borrd and the Protectorate of Plort entirely, Kaitlyn dedicated her healing arts to the service of El-Jheycom - and when El-Jheycom elected to rejoin Plort rather than face invasion and war, the fugitive Duchess Nathonea came to Kaitlyn under cover of night.<br><br>“Our nation has fallen,” she whispered behind locked doors, “and I can no longer bear its burdens. I pass the crown to you. When the time comes, restore our freedom - until then, carry the torch, even in the darkest hours.”<br><br>None knew of the new-minted Duchess Kaitlyn’s task. Huinesoron, created baron over an eastern land, left Vaekew, with many backward looks. Now Kaitlyn laboured under the dominion of Baron Araeph, building the resistance in secret. She came no more into the streets of Borrd - indeed, many said that she had departed the island forever. But still she worked.<br><br>The years passed slowly. When the Republic of Iric announced itself, Kaitlyn watched in silence - its borders lay too far from Vaekew for it to secure El-Jheycom’s renewed existence. And when the Librarians’ War swept through the southern mountains, Kaitlyn herself led the defence of Vaekew, securing its place in the remnant Protectorate - and assuring Wechi’s swift assault should El-Jheycom attempt to free itself from oppression.<br><br>Kaitlyn despaired. Should the resistance show itself, it would be swiftly crushed by the armies of Plort, now vigilant for any sign of rebellion - and if, by some miracle, El-Jheycom gained its freedom, the knights of the Commonwealth of Wechi would surely pour down from the mountains to crush it beneath their democratic heels. With her nation’s hopes at an all-time low, Duchess Kaitlyn at last yielded to Baron Huinesoron’s invitations and joined him in his castle Kwenaya.<br><br>Before another year had passed, they were wed.<br><br><i>Note that this is less based in reality than some of the others. Kaitlyn has no actual desire to build the LJ comm up as a community to rival the Board. Probably.</i></p>

            <p><i>Alas! The minstrel retained to cast these deeds in song has been taken ill with gout; thus, we must simply tell the tale in prose.</i><br><br>Many and many a year ago, the man called Huinesoron left the land of Prashette, seeking wider pastures. Passing into the Empire of Fanvik-Neht, he drew near to the borders of Lotor - and there saw for the first time the deprevations of the Marizu. For Prashette had not at that time been overtaken by the Marizu League, though their domains were growing rapidly following the treaty signed by Emperor Xing.<br><br>Taken aback by the barbarian hordes, Huinesoron chose to stand in opposition to them. Inspired by stories of Cam the Ruthless and the knights of Ofum, he forged a band of defenders, the Eyes of Pace. In the mountains of eastern Lotor, they laid their traps, sharpened their swords - and, one by one, fell to the Marizu.<br><br>Flying from the final wreck of the Eyes’ camp, Huinesoron chanced upon a wandering knight who gave her name as Vemi. Seeing the valour of his heart and the strength of his arm, Vemi undertook to guide Huinesoron to the island of Konti-Nyuum, and the Protectorate of Plort.<br><br>Plort was in a state of turmoil when Huinesoron arrived. The castle Otik was sealed, Jay and Acacia long gone. Now the Triumvirate, too, was divided - accusations of treason had been levelled at Thalia. Even as Huinesoron found a home for himself in Borrd, the weaver’s betrayal was bared for all to see, and her departure was assured.<br><br>Already seasoned by his time with the Eyes of Pace, Huinesoron was soon knighted under the hands of the two remaining Triumvirs, Cam and Bast. He rode swiftly to war, and his sword Davuth gained fame - and not a few nicks - in the battlefields of Lotor, defending the distant Kingdom of Medellurth. Many were the quests he undertook, including the fabled Quest of the Five, when he found the legendary Fountain of Bleepka.<br><br>The field of war and journeying was not Huinesoron’s only home. He was a constant presence in the festivities of Borrd - whether ceremonially Filling the Plotholes, winning laurels at the Games of Batveg, or walking the wharfs in the Shipfest. He was a common sight at the vast Gatherings, always ready with a word or a joke. In recognition of his achievements, he was created custodian of the records of Batveg, and granted possession of Thalia’s former stronghold of Fanvik. But Huinesoron desired more.<br><br>Leaving Fanvik and the Whirl to the household staff, Huinesoron returned to the lowlands and took a house in the city Vaekew. He fought, indeed, for the independance of El-Jheycom, but his heart was taken up with a different labour. He sought no less than to chronicle the entire history of the orders of knighthood - to bring their disparate stories into a single whole.<br><br>It was a daunting task. The mountain paths between Vaekew and Andbuc became a second home to him, and many assistants came and went. When the first, the wandering knight Vemi, departed for good, he grew despondant, and for many years forsook the great task. Rather, he returned to war, fighting both overseas - he fought honorably in the Battle of Goldberg - and in the petty wars within Plort itself. In the brief but brutal Snowbound War, he emerged as El-Jheycom’s most fervent defender, a warrior and war-leader.<br><br>Perhaps that was why, when the treaties were drawn up between Plort and Chaett, Huinesoron was created baron over vast swathes of the eastern regions. He was loath to forsake El-Jheycom, but the Principality’s citizens grew weary of their isolated existence: they elected to rejoin Plort, unifying the island, and freeing Huinesoron for his new duties.<br><br>Residing now in the hastily-built citadel Pankae (for Huinesoron had no magic like the Baron Dann’s, to summon a castle from the very air), Huinesoron returned to war with a vengeance. Now his sword hung on the castle wall, but his great mace Nado and his mighty steed Llew swiftly became household names in Borrd. When he found the time, he continued his research - and continued, too, his courtship of the fair knight Kaitlyn.<br><br>The sudden declaration of the Republic of Iric caught Huinesoron unawares, and before he knew what was happening he was forced to flee into the night, as his castle crumbled behind him. From Borrd he watched in horror as his former barony rose anew as a foreign power - and when he resettled, it was in the west, as far from Iric as he could travel.<br><br>The great work continued. Huinesoron now journeyed often into the Commonwealth of Wechi, seeking the great libraries that were found there. The unexpected granting of independance to the Refuge of Ozerbord meant he was seen less and less in the cities of Borrd - and after he was finally wed to the fair Kaitlyn, the doors of castle Kwenaya were unceremoniously shut.<br><br>Huinesoron returned to the public eye two years later, and has become a whirlwind of activity. The great work begun so long ago can never be truly complete, but he has announced his part accomplished. He has undertaken new wars, striking valiant blows against the Marizu, and indeed founded a training unit out of Ofum - the small but fierce Ofodisks.<br><br>His reputation, once so golden, has become somewhat tarnished by his actions in the Union of Plort. He is often found feuding with the other barons, and has fought in ill-advised skirmishes against both Iric and Wechi. It is rumoured in Borrd that only the guiding wisdom of Kaitlyn has deterred him from truly rash action - or, as some would have it, that she provokes it.<br><br>Seeking perhaps to restore his lost honour, Baron Huinesoron has declared a new great project: building on the work of the far-off scholars of Medellurth, he will examine their legends and draw out all that is hidden within them. Though this may begin to consume his time, he will still journey to war, striking now from afar with the bow known only as the Shadow of the Eagle.</p>

            <p>The coming of Sir Ekyl to the lands of Konti-Nyuum is not one tale but two or perhaps three, and many details of his earliest ventures have been lost to even his own memory, though he estimates that his first journey to these shores came before the fracturing of the Protectorate of Plort but after the departure of Jay and Acacia.<br><br>The Protectorate first came to Sir Ekyl&#39;s attention years ago, when he made his residence in the then-fertile lands of Gaf and El-Jheycom, where he and many others made war of their own against Fanvik-Neht and the Marizu. He fought well in those days, and when traders from Plort met with him he was enthralled by tales of Jay and Acacia, the monk Wolfram, early reports from the future Baron Huinesoron and many other tales of snark and heroism. So intrigued, he convinced these traders to take him to their own lands, where he settled for a time.<br><br>Unfortunately, this was a time of idleness for the people of the Protectorate, and their customs rang strangely in his ears. When he returned to Gaf, the people of Plort faded from his memory and were seldom thought about, for not long after his time spent among them the island of Gaf was laid low by a great earthquake, his holdings in El-Jhaycom besieged by trolls, and concerns in the lands beyond Weab occupied his attention further still. He joined with the survivors of Gaf in their diaspora, and when the troll-queen Lolita was revealed to have taken power over them he was in the van of the great battles fought against her forces, where he rode under the banner of the newly-proclaimed Gaf king Nihilo and fought alongside paladins from the empire of Somath-Aful, a mighty realm to the east that is largely unaware of Plort and its successor nations, which observes and fights against the worst excesses of the lands of Weab.<br><br>Many survivors of Old Gaf fell, heroes from the golden days distinguishing themselves once more or meeting their end on both sides of the conflict, but finally Lolita fell in single combat against King Nihilo. The new king pardoned those survivors of Gaf who had been deluded into fighting under her banner, but ordered her capital razed and formed the islands of the diaspora into a new kingdom, which he called Wugwha. There Sir Ekyl, who at the time was named Kaygee, lived and made his trade for quite some time, continuing his battles against the forces of Marizu under the banner of the grimacing sun.<br><br>It was in these days that he became aware of the realm of Tivit. Enamoured with what he found, he travelled often to the demesne of King Edward the Swift, where he became aware once more of the island of Konti-Nyuum (he would, in fact, briefly encounter Acacia herself in Tivit, but there is sadly not much of a tale to be told about it). Remembering at last how fond he had been of the Protectorate, and intrigued by the records of all that had changed in the years he had been gone, he moved from Wugwha to what was now the country of Borrd and attempted to reintegrate himself into the society he had once thought abandoned.<br><br>There, he was met by Baron Huinesoron, who told him quite frankly that nobody on the island remembered his past visit and he would thus be treated as a newcomer. It was suggested that rather than throw himself immediately into the fray, he spend a time acclimating himself to their lands, get to know the kingdoms&#39; residents and prepare himself for the traditional pilgrimage to the mountains of Purmeshun. This he did, getting to know citizens like future baroness Cassie, current barons Dann and Neshomeh, and Lady Sara, whom he romanced for a time but now does not speak of. When the day came for his pilgrimage, he threw himself into the task with great vigour, making the traditional offerings at the temples Kanun and Spelin. When he arrived at Permeshun, he again encountered Huinesoron, who confessed he was amused by the tales Ekyl (or then still Kaygee) had spun on the way and granted him a knighthood, though not without one reservation: the target of Sir Ekyl&#39;s first planned campaign was none other than the Marizu warlord King Sciurus, who had once faced the great knight known only as PA and been defeated, and who was suspected by many in the courts of Borrd to be a troll in disguise. He warned the young knight of this fact, but gave him leave to do as he would.<br><br>Undaunted, the knight led a force into Fanvik-Neht and met the host of King Sciurus in the expansive Halo Valley, where his troops broke the powerful but ill-disciplined Marizu warband. Seeking to restore the morale of his men, Sciurus challenged the knight to personal combat, but was swiftly unhorsed, and where he fell the grass turned red from the grave wounds dealt him. While Sciurus was not dead for good, and in fact many years later would confess to have been a troll from Somath-Aful before leaving the lands of Fanvik-Neht for ever, his army was smashed and Ekyl returned to Konti-Nyuum victorious. In other sorties, Ekyl would defeat Marizu and Fanvik-Neht leaders such as the Hammerspace Knight, who conjured weapons from nowhere, and the Pirate of Storms who conjured clouds of urple to confuse and dismay his enemies, and on several occasions lent his strength to the forces of Cassie in battles and raids.<br><br>Unfortunately, not all was well. In those days Ekyl, while brave and skilled in the ways of war, was bellicose, opinionated and often vulgar. He would argue with or alienate many of his fellows, and while his later apologies and attempts to redeem himself were sincere, it was not always enough; there was never peace between himself and Baroness July, for example, and these were already days of much conflict due to trolls, rebels, clashes between Borrd and Iric and immigrants from Tivit who cared nothing for the workings of the realm. The problem there was eventually deduced to be flaws in the records in Tivit which gave its residents improper ideas of what the Union of Plort stood for, and Sir Ekyl (among others, such as Baron Dann) was part of a delegation sent to the court of King Edward the Swift to correct the matter; unfortunately, King Edward and his men refused to do this and even barred the delegation from doing it themselves, stating that the flawed records being about the knights themselves was not relevant and that they were mere invaders.<br><br>Hearing this, the delegation was forced to take the matter in their own hands, and when they next returned to Tivit they did so wearing arms and armour, and leading soldiers. The aim was not to destroy Tivit or harm its people, but to make the required changes themselves and engage King Edward&#39;s forces in self-defence if need be. Despite these nonviolent aims, battles were fought and the army of Tivit driven back again and again as the delegation forced its way into the city of Weabwork to make the changes they had peacefully requested before. The attempt was mostly successful, but King Edward had sent troops led by his own personal guard to prevent them from returning to their ships. Sir Ekyl slew many knights of Tivit (or in their dialect, tropadours) in these battles, but was himself wounded, and a spell cast by the Tivit mage Fighteer drove him from the field and barred him from ever returning to Tivit. The delegation and their troops were able to safely retreat, however, and while many of the things they changed were reverted the mission was largely a success; Sir Ekyl would later counter Fighteer&#39;s spell with rites from the ancient school of magic known as Eyepi, but had no interest in returning anyway, for he had by then learned that Tivit was a corrupt realm led by hedonistic and tyrannical lords.<br><br>Soon the tensions among the lands of Konti-Nyuum died down, and Sir Ekyl would go on a number of adventures and (at least begin to) write many stories, though few have been released to the people of Borrd so far. He continued his correspondence with many other great lords and knights and tried to make peace with those he&#39;d wronged, something that was more often than not successful; it was also through this correspondence that he developed many ideas and theories for the Union, and would end up collaborating with Baron Huinesoron in the latest part of his historical research. Unfortunately, when the beginning of this project was released to the people of Borrd they responded with great outrage, and while they did not actively drive Sir Ekyl from the land he was left humiliated; soon afterwards, he would embark on an important quest to lands far from Weab, to the Federation of Academia, Scholars&#39; Empire and mythical Arell, and while this was no intentional exile he would not return for many a year, and many important things would happen in his absence, such as the departure of July and destruction of her baronial seat. Baron Huinesoron would complete their project without him, though when they spoke on the matter he invited Sir Ekyl to continue the work he had started on his own time, for the baron had been pleased by it.<br><br>When Sir Ekyl did return, no longer going by the name Kaygee, he was wiser and more mature for the experiences he had in those far off lands, and felt struck by guilt for what he saw as abandoning his duties. His friend Cassie, now a baroness, granted him a fief and castle, and he proceeded to do his best to continue warring against the Marizu and contribute to the affairs of Borrd and Wechi. Recently, when pirates raided Wechi by night, having come to Plort with claims of friendship only to turn their cloaks and plunder the land before fleeing to the islands of Fafka and Plopos, it was Sir Ekyl that Baroness Neshomeh called upon, and he sailed with his retinue to present the pirate lords with offers of peace and friendship. When he arrived at the two islands, however, he found the halls deserted save a handful of servants who still remained, maintaining the grounds as if unaware the masters had left. He left the same message to servants on both isles, an offer of friendship and request for Plort&#39;s former friends to explain themselves, and reclaimed what had been stolen, but had to return otherwise empty-handed, and the islands and those servants still on them were later washed away by the intercession of the gods of Wechi-Ah, called upon by Baroness Neshomeh when the pirate lords failed to respond in the time Sir Ekyl had given them. <br><br>Since then, Sir Ekyl has quietly conducted his affairs in his keep, the imposing castle of Godreve, where he watches over the small fief granted him and pores over innumerable dusty tomes - some his work, which he scrawls at by the day, and some that of others which he reads - in the great library; a town has formed around the castle as well, but aside from overseeing various civic projects or defending it from the occasional troll raiders who penetrate that far into the Union of Plort&#39;s territory Sir Ekyl is not often seen there. His keep is in the middle of Cassie&#39;s baronial lands, and lies equidistant from Wechi, Iric and the rest of Borrd, between which he travels frequently to interact with the people there and assist wherever he may. He has still not released many stories, and many of the ones he has done are said to have been written purely in personal correspondence between himself and the oft-absent baroness, but he claims to still be working on them, as well as attempts at gaining a foothold in the land of Autor, and that he will put out his reports and stories when they are &quot;ready&quot;. Until then they are jealously guarded by his retinue of men-at-arms, though he sometimes invites other knights or even barons to come read some of the tomes. Some say he himself harbours ambitions of one day rising to a baronial seat...<br><br>[Hoo boy, that came out a lot longer than I meant it to so I&#39;m just going to cut things off there so I can have something done and deal with the work I&#39;ve gotta do. I hope people don&#39;t mind the read though. :P]</p>

He was a seeker of lore, always on the search for new stories to satisfy his curiosity.<br><br>During a sojourn in Tivit not too long ago, Filius heard of the valiant knights of the Protectorate of Plort. Seeing in Plort a trove of stories yet unread, Filius sailed along the Hyparlink trade route to the island of Konti-Nyuum, where he immersed himself in the exploits of the renowned Jay and Acacia, the lore of the Knights of Retben, and many other divers and sundry tales of the knights of Plort. However, even Plort could not satisfy his never-ending desire for new stories, so he set out for Weab once more, returning to Plort whenever he heard that a knight returned from battle against the Marizu.<br><br>Filius would have been content to continue living as a wanderer, going between lands, had he not seen the dread Marizu face-to-face. One day, as Filius was sampling a new tale in the land of Fanvik-Neht, behold, he came face-to-face with a band of Marizu that were sworn enemies of the Knights of Retben. Thus Filius set forth for Plort to seek the knights’ aid.<br><br>Filius was warmly welcomed in the City of Borrd, but alas! the knights whose aid he had sought to procure had either disappeared or had never been to the region of Fanvik-Neht where the Marizu had attacked. Yet Filius harbored no ill will against the knights, but decided to become a citizen, for even a wanderer will find the path to the Mountains of Permeshun closed to all but citizens of the nations of Plort.<br><br>Though Filius still wanders far and wide—as is his wont—and has even extended his wanderings to the fabled Library of Dammd, he is somehow never far from Borrd whenever a knight returns from battle. Eager to hear of the conquest in full detail, he will be one of the first to welcome the hero of Plort upon his or her return from a raid against the vile Marizu.<br><br>[As a bit of clarification, I have no intentions as of yet to gain Permission, but I had to find some way to make Filius a citizen despite never receiving the aid he sought! Somehow, &quot;he knew that the knights were busy people, and he liked the people of Borrd&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to fit.]<br><br>[P.S.: To forestall any questions, &quot;filius caeli&quot; is Latin for &quot;son of heaven,&quot; and the Library of Dammd is a reference to <a href="http://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/">the Library of the Damned</a>. What Huinesoron decides to do with this new place is up to him.]</p>

            <p>When the valiant Huinesoron was first dubbed a knight of Plort, he was eager to bring ruin upon the Marizu who befouled the once (or at least could-be) fair mountains of Lotor. Journeying to the southern city of Andbuc astride his horse Maklar, he took up the shards of his old blade, the blade which had been broken as he fled the ruin of the Eyes of Pace, and forged for himself a new weapon. Long and straight it was, engraved with curving runes and glowing with an inner light that many thought cruel. Davuth he named it, and rode down from the mountains to war.<br><br>In the city Borrd he was reunited with that knight called the Raven, who had fought for a time with the Eyes. A dagger she bore of darkened steel, which she named Selin; her black steed she called Vinfleur, and braided silver stars into its flowing mane.<br><br>Now it so chanced that a new ship, laid some months earlier, had just been completed: a vessel of new design, light and fast, which its builder named Aberration. Though not suited to the great armies Cam led out of Ofum, it would serve well as the courier of Huinesoron and the Raven. They sailed forth onto the wine-dark sea, eager for battle.<br><br>Aberration reached the shore in the dead of night, and put in on the shores of the northern wastes. The captain, by the name of Boshay mal Orn, vowed to hold his position until they returned - or for two weeks, or until he was spotted. Laughing uneasily, the knights rode forth into the wildnerness.<br><br>The road was a long one and a perilous. Skirting the eastern borders of the Empire of Fanvik-Neht, they came upon the young nation of Fixionarly, hold of the Lady Cassandra. Its forests were dense and wild - but, Huinesoron deemed, safer by far than entering Fanvik-Neht, or attempting the passage of the Marizu-held Potread Open Academy (though the Raven would have preferred the latter choice). Dismounting their horses, the brave knights entered the woods.<br><br>No stories tell what they encountered there - only that four days passed before they again saw daylight. Returning at last to the saddle, they rode hard to the east, passing out of Fixionarly and into the Kingdom of Lotor.<br><br>Lotor in that day was a vast and sprawling nation, stretching from the northern coast clear around to the southern marches of Fanvik-Neht. Seeking to confound their enemies, Huinesoron and the Raven had not elected to land directly in Lotor - rather, they had made their way south to open a new front against the Marizu who held the kingdom.<br><br>Close to the border stood Castle Haslant, a peaceful realm after the manner of the Marizu. The lady of the realm, whose name the knights discovered to be Amariel, ruled with a light touch - insofar as a Marizu ever could. All the woods and hills of that land were thick with glitter, urple - and the insidious stench of pla’tool magic.<br><br>Tethering their horses to a tree, Huinesoron and the Raven crept into the precints of Castle Haslant. It was dusk, and while the Raven’s armour hid her in the shadows, Huinesoron was clad in gleaming steel - up until his comrade in arms persuaded him to smear mud on it. So the embodiment of Night and the embodiment of Muck sought their quarry, lurking in stables, behind houses, and under carts until at last they came upon Lady Amariel alone.<br><br>The Raven crept from the darkness, her knife Selin in hand, and approached Amariel from behind - and that was when Huinesoron saw a movement down the corridor, and realised that Amariel was not alone. There was no time to call out to the Raven - which would have alerted Amariel besides. Lunging from hiding, he swung his great sword Davuth, trusting to luck that the blow would connect.<br><br>It did - and through luck, indeed. For the Marizu he had seen was Amariel’s loyal guard Theaden, who stumbled when he found himself under attack, and it was this fall which brought him into Huinesoron’s reach. The guard fell without a sound - and when Huinesoron turned, he found that the Raven, too, had completed her task. They crept out, unseen.<br><br>By dawn, the castle was in turmoil. Amariel’s followers had discovered her body, and now sought their own advantage, resorting to open battle to decide who would lay claim to Castle Haslant. It was a simple matter for Huinesoron to make the decision - to slip once more into the keep and set a blaze. Distracted by their feud, the Marizu did not notice the rising inferno until it was too late.<br><br>Watching from afar, Huinesoron turned to the Raven. “Many a day passed before we reached this place,” he noted, “and many a day has passed here. Think you that we can return to our fast ship ere her captain departs?”<br><br>The Raven laughed harshly. “In truth, I fear he has already fled,” she said. “He has not the stomach for war.”<br><br>“So goes my thought also,” Huinesoron mused, and raised his face to the northern sky. “How many miles would you say it is between us and the host of Cam?”<br><br>The Raven grinned broadly, gripping her dagger in her hand. “I do not count the distance in miles,” she declared, “but in Marizu slain. And by that measure, I say: not enough.”<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I think it falls apart a bit around the actual killing - I don&#39;t have much luck writing action, and shifting from the remote to the step-by-step jarred a bit. But I think it gives a general idea.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I know, technically speaking it would be the Boarders and not the Agents who are the knights, and Neshomeh isn&#39;t an Andalite, as far as we know.

            <p>[... but we in the PPC community do <i>write</i> missions.]<br><br>[I picture it working like this: the knight takes up a sword, shield, steed, or whatever, bearing the name of each of the agents you write. If there&#39;s two or more authors, they each take their own characters. So, for instance, the knight Huinesoron might wield his sword Dafuth alongside the knight Kaitlyn on her noble steed Constancy.]<br><br>[Then, sailing on the dark ships <i>Pyro</i> and <i>Assassin</i>, they travel to the lands of the Mary-Sue in question (which, since this is a DOGA mission in part, are twisted and tortured by her sorcerous powers). They then fight their way to her castle, hearing and seeing things along the way which reflect what happened in the story. Then they kill her.]<br><br>[Obviously the concept can be extended beyond the literal Mary-Sue - for instance, into the foul wraiths, who control the minds of those around them, forcing them to commit uncharacteristic acts of lust. The knights may have difficulty resisting their strength. The term &#39;Marizu&#39; represents all forms of badfic, not just Mary-Sues.]<br><br>[I will attempt to write one later - not sure how it&#39;ll go, or whether that will be before or after the Tale of Baron Huinesoron.]<br><br>[hS]</p>

            <p>El-Jheycom&#39;s location is right on the spot where I&#39;d planned on having my counterpart park his Sorcerous Skyship, within the boundaries of Borrd but close enough to Wechi for the Skyship to travel for trade and interaction.

Phobos is most likely a gracious and accepting baron, of course, but Outhra does not seem like the sort of person who would risk a storm or attack causing the Skyship to accidentally cross over barony borders, which would force him to comply with a new set of airspace laws without warning. </p>

            <p>They&#39;re not Marizu, but preyed upon by them. Yet, brony is the name of the fandom, not the canon. So, is this name in violation? Does Jumper need to hail from the Fim or M&#39;elpe or something? I ask because I&#39;m writing the Historie of the Bronee, but if the name does not work, I&#39;ll have to change it. However, I will admit that it feels a little wrong writing the alternate history of the fandom and using the name of the show, but if that&#39;s the way it is, so be it.<br><br>Also, if anybody wants to suggest alternate spellings for Bronee if it&#39;s found acceptable, feel free to.

            <p>Deep in the coastal forests of Borrd lives a young lady-knight with the image of a curiously twisted baked good on her heraldic banner. She occasionally visits her fellow knights, spreading tales of her most trusted hired swords and the continuous fight against the bane of the Marizu. It is long forgotten as to how the lady-knight came to live in Borrd, though after an eager initial start in the battle against the Marizu, her battles have lessened greatly.<br><br>At times missives with her personal seal are seen, but rarely so; recently she has turned her attention towards schooling, bettering herself against the threat of the Marizu and their ilk, gaining one level of mastery and continuing on to aspire towards an intermediate but by no means lesser achievement. Only occasionally is she seen in person, appearing just twice to enjoy the company of her fellow brothers- and sisters-in-arms at one of the Great Gatherings. She is a prolific writer, competing in grand contests such as the Nahn-Oh Wry-Moh each autumn, as well as scribing stories for her own amusement in the long, rainy winters of her small demesne.</p>

            <p>Legend has it that the tower of Tegnoh, a structure assembled from perfectly cubical blocks of stone, once traveled between Iric and Borrd as it saw fit. Years ago, though, even before the fires claimed Flayme, the encroachment of the great Kar&#39;eer forest left the tower permanently anchored in Iric. Its master, the wizard Dann, watches across the lands of Iric and Borrd quietly, only rarely appearing in Borrd outside the festival times.<br><br>Cut off from Borrd by two great mountain ranges and a raging river, the port city of La Wunj is full of strange ships, exotic accents, and rituals of greeting and farewell that would seem outlandish on the streets of Borrd. Dann is found there frequently in the evenings, after tending the exotic trees and blossoms of the Kar&#39;eer forest all day. After a lab accident involving one of the regular La Wunjers, he occasionally takes the form of a black housecat rather than his normal arcane attire.</p>

            <p>This knight started as an apprentice binder in a land far from the countries known as &quot;Weab,&quot; restoring the tomes which carried the words of the Academics (Bai-Yo, En&#39;gleesh, Mats, etc.).  From hearing the tales from other lands, he yearned to reach them, initially through voyages setting out from the Kingdom of Hearts.<br><br>Eventually, however, the Book Repairman learned of the mighty fleets of Plort, and the greater ease of access their ships provided to reach many different lands.  Upon arrival, the Repairman did not settle in any one land, but traveled constantly from Iric to Wechi to Borrd, meeting and learning from the diverse peoples throughout Plort.<br><br>Initially, he yearned to serve chiefly as knight, and made scant few, overly-funded missions to some lands beset by Marizu.  However, between the material investment in such voyages and the disappearance of his good friend July from the island, the Repairman eventually spent more and more time in Wechi.  He has currently returned to his roots, repairing the records of knights of ages past, and ensuring word of their heroics lasts forever, that the future peoples of Plort might never forget what has come before.<br><br>Nonetheless, his campaigns against the Marizu are not yet at an end.</p>

            <p>The Wandering Winterwood journeys ceaselessly, starting from the domain of Fixionarly where she learnt the magical arts from the Lady Cassandra. In time, she sought to be greater (and more true to the deity Kanun) than her mentor and the denizens of Fixionarly, and left.<br><br>For a time she dwelt in Fanvik-Neht, where she heard of the gospel of Cam and the military camp Ofum. Migrating to El-Jhey, she discovered Cam in hiding there, and befriended her. From thereon her magic was inspired by the once-fearsome Cam, and through her new mentor she first heard legends of the lands of Plort. <br><br>The Wandering Winterwood arrived in Borrd, eager to find new mentors, to continue learning and refining her magic. Alas, her spells were hasty and immature, and she had not yet gained enough experience to ward off the ever present threat of spells from Marizu, and unwittingly fell under their enchantments even in the safety of Borrd.<br><br>Ashamed, the Wandering Winterwood left in the dead of night, wandering to other corners of the realm. Whispers of her presence in the lands of Are-Pea and Fanvik-Neht travelled in the wind and through the woods, sometimes reaching Plort, sometimes not. It was only until she had crafted her own military training camps in the fashion of Cam that she fully returned to Plort, armed with new purpose and new domains to protect -- that of Hitalya, Sureloch, and Doktaru, amid others. <br><br>With her return, the Wandering Winterwood took up residence in the town of Tumblar, a liberal-minded port town with trading connections to all the different lands, though she maintains land won through her numerous connections in Tumblar in Ayohtree, a land where few denizens of Marizu have taken root. She alternates between slaying the evils of Marizu, crafting her own spells (oft with her companion Intell), and training the next generation of the defenders of Plort. </p>

            <p>The west of Borrd is not so wild a place as other regions. The land was settled in the days of the knights Jay and Acacia, and it is bordered by strong allies. The people of the region are, for the most part, an industrious and creative lot with many artisans and craftspeople among its citizens.<br><br>The landscape is mostly rolling plains north of the three rivers: the Graymar, the Ponchuashun, and the Gudryting (which is formed by the confluence of the other two near the Temples of Kanun and Spelin). South of the rivers is the woodland of Umor that borders on the realm of Wechi. The arm of the Wattuf Mountains that reaches into the plains is known as the Purmeshun Range.  It is to these mountains that every would-be knight must make a pilgrimage, leaving offerings at the Temples of Kanun and Spelin along the way, before they may be knighted.<br><br>Baron Phobos, in his castle at Cokirt, is one of the newest Barons. He was a knight, before his ascension, and his favored weapon is the warhammer. There are some that say he owes his Barony to a political marriage with the Baroness Neshomeh. Others claim it was earned through battles across both Borrd and Iric. Still others believe that he gained his seat through some democratic process. Whatever the method, he watches over his lands, even when his attention may seem to be elsewhere.<br><br>While he can be more strict with his rulings than some of the other Barons, he is often in seclusion for long periods of time.  He maintains the laws of his realm and seems to do little else.  However, it would be unwise to think him lazy for, while he is slow to act, any action he does take is forceful and intended to end disputes quickly. The border his realm shares with Baron Huinesoron&#39;s is often the site of minor skirmishes. While little damage is ever done in these clashes, some treaties have resulted.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Aila vyn Sini came originally to Plort in pursuit of rumours and fragmented stories of they who resist the scourge of the terrible Marizu, upon whom she looked with loathing, though without understanding of why it was so. It took her some time before she found her way, but after wanderings through Fanvik-Neht and the smaller Aohtree, she came upon a tale of the City of Ofum, which included a wandering set of directions to the Commonwealth of Wechi. She resided therein for some time, combing the archives of Neshomeh before tentatively setting out to wander in Borrd. <br><br>She still wanders there, finding herself often congratulating those knights recently returned from the slaying of Marizu, but not brave enough to attempt to face the menace herself, as she doubts her skill with arms and seeks to improve before attempting to become a knight.

            <p>Translated from medieval, my compliment to Herr Wozzeck was essentially &quot;Wonderful! Good job! I wasn&#39;t expecting you to use poetry to convey the backstory of your character, and you have done it very well. Now I&#39;m going to be embarrassed in the future when or if I make my own summary, because it will almost certainly display only a fraction of the awesome bard song that you just made.&quot;<br>I can see that I am even worse at faux-medieval English than I thought I was. I can cross out my plans of writing my potential character&#39;s backstory in that dialect, then. I&#39;d never had the highest hope for that, but I thought I might at least have had fun doing it. I don&#39;t want to compromise people knowing what I&#39;m talking about.<br><br>I was planning initially to respond to your backstory, World-Jumper, but Jumper Knight&#39;s occasional description as &quot;Man of the Horse&quot; prompted me to play the &quot;H3Y JUMP3R 1S TH1S YOU? H3H3H3!&quot; card and look through Google images for pictures of some fandom characters looking silly while riding horses. Well, I attempted to play that card. All I could find was either unrelated nonsense, centaur Photoshops, or characters being ludicrously majestic, <a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/fd444dbec7a0cf8041f3dbad19832e37/tumblr_mkjhr4i3JK1s25p22o2_1280.png">even in Homestuck</a>, a fandom that houses at least two horse-obsessed crazies, so that card was sent straight to the Graveyard.<br><br>But hey, at least your backstory provided more of a basis for Weab&#39;s geography! That&#39;s going to be helpful in the future.</p>

            <p>One would have not thought much of the man known as PC upon his arrival in the city of Borrd. He was just another wide-eyed wanderer from Tivit with a head full of preconceptions and a belly full of snark-fire. A follower of both the Great God Pterry and the Scientific Theatre of Three Thousand Mysteries, he had dreams of leading men and women into battle against Marizu and all their associated ilk. He would descend upon his opponents with a sword made of mockery in the style of the saint Mike and Joel.<br><br>PC was eventually granted a knighthood after much training and patience. He did rest on his laurels long, instead launching himself into a series of battles against the Marizu. His most famous victory came against the Marizu leader known as Chizzstake, who was so persistent in his attacks it took two battles to finish the fiend off properly. PC reveled in it.<br><br>Those days did not last. After several protracted campaigns against the Marizu, PC found himself tiring of the same old warfare. The reports from other knights no longer compelled him in the same way. He saw no lessons being learned from their conflicts. That, combined with the border conflicts between Borrd and Iric (both places he called home), eventually led to one fateful day. On that day, PC marched into the halls of government, threw down his sword, and announced that he would leave Konti-Nyuum.<br><br>No one quite knew where he went after that. Some say he wandered the world as a freelance man-at-arms, offering his services to random fiefdoms. Some say he went mad penning random treatises that no one read. A few even whispered that he had ventured to the distant and dangerous lands of Yu&#39;Tub in order to carve out a barony for himself.<br><br>In any event, PC did eventually return (the snark-fires within are not so easily dimmed). But the PC that came back was not the same one who left. His armor was gone, replaced with robes of black and grey. He sought not more battles, but instead to educate and train the new knights (and maybe even a few barons). The stories he tells now are not of warfare and the Marizu, but of personal drama and partnerships made strong.<br><br>PC wanders vagabond-like between the realms of Borrd, Wechi, and Iric. He has no fief of his own. That might change, however. Those he speaks to claim he aspires to a grand fortress and school called Worhkshap, where he can educate the warriors and barons of tomorrow.<br><br>((Man, I can be full of myself. Not to mention a bit prone to purple prose. Eh, it still sort fits.)) <br><br>((Imaginary internet points to anyone who can spot all the various references I make.))</p>

            <p>...As I tell you the tale of the knight Jumper, wanderer of the world.<br><br>Before Jumper earned the honor of Knighthood, even before he moved to the land of Plort, he was a Man of the Horse, proud citizen of Bronee. Bronee was known far and wide in the world of Weab, their song and art spread far beyond their borders, and loved even by those who rejected the Horse. For this young Man of the Horse, it seemed as though he could not receive enough tales of the Six to satisfy his hunger. <br><br>Jumper traveled through Weab, finding holds of the Bronee wherever he went to rest and sample the tales from those lands. While he found grand fare wherever he traveled, continuously he heard hushed whispers of darker holds, taken from the Bronee by those known only as the Marizu. After hearing the rumors one time too many, he finally built up the courage to ask about these holds. As he heard the atrocities committed by the Marizu, his horror built. How could anyone do such unspeakable acts to the Six? To the Princesses of the Sun and Moon which he held in the highest regard? He renounced the Marizu that day, vowing particular revenge upon the Marizu known as Pinkamena, for her atrocities committed against Bronee.<br><br>The man continued his travels, and as he did, receved a vision of another traveler. He thought on this character long and hard as he traveled, until the day he chose to visit the land of Tivit. He had heard of their scholars, how they recorded and codified near every tale, finding the tools used by the storytellers and bringing them to light for all to see. He stayed awake the long hours of many a night, combing though the archives for tools for which he could build his own tale. It was here he found reference to the Protectorate of Plort. He found himself enthralled, fascinated by the tales of those brave Knights who hunted down the dreaded Marizu, including his sworn enemy, Pinkamena. He had to know more. He had to find this land of Plort, and see these Knights in person, to thank them for what they have done.<br><br>He followed the path of other Tivits sailing towards the land of Plort. He landed in the country of Wechi, where all documents pertaining to the land of Plort were archived. For  several weeks, he stayed there, resting in an inn as he read on the laws of the land. When he felt himself familiarized with the ways of these people&#39;s customs, he took the road of Hyparlink into the kingdom of Borrd.<br><br>When he arrived, he found himself showered with gifts, a practice of these peoples he was warned of, yet did not properly anticipate come the actual event. There, he was greeted by citizen and Knight alike, including some of those who inspired his move to the land of Plort. He knew then that he was a citizen of a land that he would call his home as much as Bronee. He gave himself the name of Jumper, and settled in the city of Borrd.<br><br>However, he was not fully content. He had seen the knights in their splendor, and wished to join their noble ranks. He worked and labored, crafting the tools for which he would strike at the Marizu for many months, forging them just so, to impress the Barons and earn his knighthood. When at last he was satisfied, he presented himself to the Barons, pledging himself to the extermination of the Marizu. He swore to drive their Urple taint from his homeland of Bronee, not to rest until they are thoroughly defeated. <br><br>The Baron Huinesoron looked upon him, to see if this Man of the Horse was worthy of Knighthood. After much pondering and debate, once demanding to see another example of the man&#39;s ability, the Baron came to a decision at last. The Baron withdrew his sword, and said, &quot;From the work that I have seen, in various stages of completion, I have come to a decision. This man shows determination and skill enough for knighthood. Do any other Barons oppose his advancement?&quot; Upon hearing no objection, Baron Huinesoron lay his sword to Jumper&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Then, I dub the Knight Jumper. Thine hold is nothing, for now. Build your keep where you will, and keep it safe.&quot;<br><br>And so, he did. The Knight Jumper, Man of the Horse, built his keep nearest to the borders of Bronee. There he resides, venturing out when he can to drive back the Marizu from his old home. When not in his keep, or slaying the forces of the Marizu, he sings praises to the Six and the tales of Bronee in the city of Borrd, much to the joy (and annoyance) on many.<br><br>((And...CUT! Whew, that went on much longer then anticipated. Well, after writing the Epoch of Jumper, who has completed only one crusade thus far, I find myself thinking even more about this world. I think I&#39;m going to tell the story of Bronee later, going through the history of the fandom in the same style Huinesoron did with the PPC. There is a lot of history in this young fandom, that I think lends itself beautifully to this style. I&#39;ll write it in a Google doc and share it when it&#39;s done, if I do it.))</p>

            <p>And the baronies of Plort are no exception. A figure arose, trained in the arts of the harlequin over many years, turning from a sullen and melancholic young maid into a true harlequin. Alas and alack, not everyone shares her gift for laughter - her book-keeper, kept at her side by the vague promise of one day returning to her homeland of Doktaru, being one of the more notable ones - especially the fiefdoms of the Marizu, who outlawed levity and gaiety of all stripes in the Treaty of Sirruz-Biznuss. Despite this, the pair have traveled extensively throughout Plort, with Signora Wobbellini the toast of both children and harried parents grateful for a moment&#39;s respite. Recently, they have taken to touring the mainland, in particular the Tynee-Vandam Co-Prosperity Hegemony (a vassal of Marizu in all but name), to conduct a charm offensive against the Marizu as only a clown can. Custard pies and slapstick may or may not be involved.</p>

            <p>Wow, where to even begin?<br><br>Well, as to shifting borders and such, Baroness Neshomeh must&#39;ve had a domain in Borrd before settling down in the wild frontier of Wechi, although Wechi was founded before Neshomeh even became a baron (the wiki was created in December 2007, Laburnum and I became PGs in May 2008). Perhaps this became Phobos&#39; domain when he joined his house to hers in 2011.<br><br>There was, of course, the uncertain period when the Baroness sojourned in exile from Plort altogether, returning only because she could not rest from the war against the Marizu, whatever troubles awaited her on the island. It was then, no doubt, that she settled permanently in Wechi, though frequently visiting Borrd to perform official military functions and such. She remains a stranger to the lands of Iric; although she is on friendly terms with the barons there, the climate is not much to her liking.<br><br>She leads occasional strikes against the Marizu, but devotes most of her time to maintaining her land, which remains somewhat wild and untamed despite efforts to lay down common roads and other infrastructure. It remains a somewhat daunting land to those who have never journeyed there before, and only a hardy few, such as the brave knight doctorlit, make their homes amid the wide, lonely moors. Even Neshomeh&#39;s beloved husband, Phobos, rarely visits her in the remote highland castle of Vaekew. (Which may be renamed Arkive...? There could be a city of Vaekew, though, to go with Andbuc and Manyuel.)<br><br>(Also, Wechi is Scotland, apparently.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It is a long tale, and may grow yet taller in the telling . . . .<br><br>Long ago, when Neshomeh was but a maiden, she was known as SoulFinder and aspired to be a healer (being then a neophyte in the arts of Beytah), with thoughts of war far from her mind. She dwelt in the village of Fadop in the peaceful land of Var&#39;s Cape, where all were kindly and wise. It was there she first studied the arcane craft of Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl. It was there also that she first heard rumor of the Marizu from one who had journeyed to the land of Fanvik-Neht—for the Marizu troubled Var&#39;s Cape hardly at all, it being a somewhat remote land and well-fortified against their bewitchments.<br><br>Young SoulFinder, having never known the ravages of the Marizu first-hand, was not daunted by this rumor, but rather intrigued by tales of distant lands. She determined to set out and travel the world, and it was then she took the name Neshomeh for her own.<br><br>Her journey to Fanvik-Neht took her through the trading hub of Niyopehtz, where she made many dear friends from the lands of Lotor, Air&#39;ihpotre, Fantopra, and Dropern, and had grand adventures with them in the wilderness of Are-Pea. It was in Niyopehtz and Are-Pea that she came to know the Marizu for herself, for these lands are well-known to them and cannot be defended; in those wide-open spaces, those who reject the Marizu can only flee from their camps.<br><br>And flee Neshomeh finally did, for she had grown weary of the hustle and bustle of Niyopehtz, and sought respite from the scourge of the Marizu. She recalled vaguely a tale out of Fanvik-Neht, carried to her ears in whispers by her Lotorish friends; a tale of one known only as Miss Cam, and the great war-camp Ofum. It was there Neshomeh fled, and there that she heard at last of the Protectorate of Plort and the grand knights of Konti-Nyuum. Though not of a warlike nature, Neshomeh was inspired to join their ranks and enlisted at Ofum. Alas, Miss Cam&#39;s own Lotorish unit was full, but Neshomeh joined with Meir Brin&#39;s Eicheffay, and was well content.<br><br>Having completed her training, Neshomeh traveled at last to the city of Borrd and found herself overawed by its splendor and humbled by the wisdom of its folk. Now, this was in the early days of Plort, for she did once behold the famed Jay from afar before the doors of Otik were closed forever. The time of the Triumvirate passed in a blur, for she immersed herself in further studies: she trained in war as a squire, first under the knight Artemis and then the renowned Huinesoron and Kippur; she further honed her skill with Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl in Baron Nenya&#39;s fair hold of Kwendi in the city of Andboc (then part of Borrd); and she rededicated herself to the arts of Beytah, serving as medic with the training units of Affa and Opha.<br><br>During this time, she ventured oft into the land of Chaett and spent many carefree evenings with Oracle, Blayze, Hawkelf, and sundry others in the inn of Eyem-Chaett in La Wunj. She attended festivals in Borrd, being particularly fond of the ceremonial Filling of the Plotholes. It was then she began in jest to assemble her own forces (she was not yet a proper knight), but the jest soon turned earnest when the Marizu threatened the vulnerable folk of Yung Wi-Sods. Being at the time the only one with both knowledge of Yung Wi-Sods and the freedom to go there, she quickly assumed her knighthood and sailed, and there won her first solo campaign against the Marizu.<br><br>Having thus won renown on the battlefield and off, Neshomeh rose quickly in the esteem of Plort. With her Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl, she established her own keep, Arkive, and helped to found the city of Manyuel, dedicated to the preservation of the lore and history of Plort. She was much sought after for her knowledge and healing arts, and finally elected Baron (much to the surprise of those who had presumed she already was one!)<br><br>This was a golden time for Neshomeh, but it was not to last. Just as she assumed her barony, troubles came to Plort in the form of trolls, rebellions, and waves of Tivits who esteemed not the lore and law of Plort. Many hard battles were fought on Plort itself, particularly on the borders of Borrd and Iric, though the stakehold Wechi was not left unscathed.<br><br>In these troubled times, Neshomeh found solace in love, for she had met Phobos (then known as Barid) on the shores of Academia and enticed him to Plort, where he became her staunchest ally and an acclaimed warrior in his own right, having been knighted by none other than the Baron Araeph. Some feared that the union of Phobos and Neshomeh portended a coup in which they would overthrow the other barons and rule Plort as tyrants, but fortunately, these rumors turned out to be completely unfounded, and their chief perpetrator ultimately abandoned Plort.<br><br>But alas, the greatest trouble lay still ahead, for Neshomeh made a grievous misstep during a diplomatic meeting between representatives of Borrd and Iric to settle a matter of law, and (it seemed) the entire population of Iric took offense. Despite Neshomeh&#39;s best efforts to plead her good intentions, which the residents of Plort had never once doubted before, the ears and hearts of Iric were shut, and the few loyal friends who rallied to her aid were cruelly tarred with the same black brush. Thus, she and her husband went forth in exile.<br><br>However, Neshomeh&#39;s heart still beat for the noble cause for which Plort had first been founded, and after a time she returned to Arkive. She swore for her own sake to never set foot in Iric, and threw herself into her efforts to build up Wechi. With July gone, Neshomeh was the sole baron with a strong interest in looking after that rugged yet beautiful land. Furthermore, a new Marizu threat had reared its head, a dire threat known as Reicheru Ketsuekineko-oni, and Neshomeh must needs face it for the sake of her honor and that of all Plort. The campaign against Reicheru was long and bloody, but finally Neshomeh returned in triumph. She was able to make amends with many of her former persecutors (one of whom had found themself in need of her healing arts), and thus her good name was restored.<br><br>Recently, Neshomeh found herself at the forefront of a conflict of a different, more insidious nature, for her beloved land of Wechi was the victim of spying and thievery. The bandits responsible had entered Plort with fair mien and pretended to be friends of the cause, but stole through Wechi by night, raiding as they went and carrying their ill-begotten gains away by ship to the twin pirate isles of Fafka and Plopos. Although Sir Ekyl sailed to the isles of Plort&#39;s former friends with an offering of an olive branch and a treaty, he met with no answer and was forced to return empty-handed. Therefore, Neshomeh made inventory of all that had been violated, and kneeling before the gods of Wechi-Ah, pleaded for their intercession. The just gods were moved by her pleas, and rising in wrath, smote Fafka and Plopos from the face of Weab.<br><br>Finally, a mere week ago today, Neshomeh&#39;s own home of Arkive suffered a freak fire in the Hall of Ancient Records. Fortunately, the blaze was quickly tamped down, and only one document was severely damaged. Neshomeh has put her best scribes to work on it, and she hopes to have it replaced forthwith.<br><br>(( Holy crap. I hope this makes any kind of sense and hasn&#39;t mucked up the geography and timelines too badly. I&#39;ll be happy to explain or correct anything that got away from me. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh, having a lot of fun with this. ))</p>

            <p>Fantopra and Dropern started out as Potoh and Darop, following the convention of Lotor, but I decided to take it a bit further for variety. So, Fantopra = <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> (PotO), and Dropern = <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i> (DroP).<br><br>If those don&#39;t work with the naming conventions you&#39;ve started for canons vs. fandoms, please change them. I think you and I came up with different things for <i>Harry Potter</i>, for instance, and I&#39;m not married to mine.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you like Yung Wi-Sods, though. *g*<br><br>Affa and Opha are the Alchemists&#39; Fanfiction Academy (AFA) and Official PhanPhiction Academy (OPA). I hope it works to make the other OFUs sub-units in the warcamp of Ofum. It didn&#39;t seem to make sense to make them separate camps, since there are a bajillion of them and not all their writers are also PPCers. Also, I only went with &quot;unit&quot; because I don&#39;t know my military rankings, so it could be that Miss Cam leads the overall training battalion while Meir Brin and Lily have regiments and others have squadrons... or whatever would actually make sense.<br><br>Fadop is FaDoP: the Friends and Defenders of Pilot, which was an itty-bitty little community of lovely and creative (if fweakin&#39; insane) people in the <i>Farscape</i> fandom. It&#39;s where I got the carapace on my smiley. {= ) Actually, that would&#39;ve made a good detail for the story... drat, missed opportunity.<br><br>I also want to make sure it&#39;s clear that Eyem-Chaett is IM chat, not AIM chat. It <i>was</i> mostly AIM for me, but we used MSN Live, too, and I wanted to leave it open to all chat clients. It&#39;s a big inn, what with being located in a trading center and all. There are plenty of rooms.<br><br>Also also, I&#39;m not sure if Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl is magic or not. I don&#39;t consider myself a mage... but if it is, I suspect it&#39;s mostly conjuration, used to call things into being from the mysterious ether. Such as books. Which are made of pages. &gt;.&gt; But then, why wouldn&#39;t it just be the craft of book-binding? I dunno. In any case, it goes hand in hand with See-Yes-Ess, which I didn&#39;t mention but has recently been used to remodel Arkive with a cleaner, more modern look.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you enjoyed the tale. ^_^ As detailed as it is, I forgot a couple of things, like the So Sue Me incident and the TV Tropes editing spree... maybe Ekyl covers the latter, though; I haven&#39;t read his story yet. I also didn&#39;t work in the two Gatherings I&#39;ve been to. And probably lots of other stuff that could be worth mentioning. *shrug*<br><br>I should probably name some of the landforms in Wechi...<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hold on, I think I wrote this up for hS&#39;s PPC community documentary... yep, here it is:<blockquote>The &quot;So Sue Me incident&quot; refers to a Board-wide discussion sparked by a blog post by well-known Mary Sue advocate Boosette in April 2010.  Broadly speaking, the post was an essay claiming that the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot; shouldn&#39;t be used because it is inherently misogynistic, and that criticizing characters by calling them Sues is no better than bullying young female writers who are empowered by writing such characters. It came to our attention because Boosette specifically named the PPC as perpetrators of misogyny and bullying.<br><br>Some PPCers initially reacted with anger, and some regrettable things were posted in the heat of the moment. The bulk of PPCer responses were surprise and confusion, though, since many of Boosette&#39;s specific claims about what Mary Sues are and what we do were less than accurate.<br><br>Araeph expertly dissected the post&#39;s more dubious claims in her response, posted to the PPC LiveJournal and linked from the Board. She pointed out that Boosette&#39;s definition of &quot;Mary Sue,&quot; which included the notion that Sues could be &quot;too flawed&quot; and encompassed canon characters generally regarded as non-Sues by PPCers (such as Tamora Pierce&#39;s Keladry of Mindelan), differs greatly from ours. She also rebutted Boosette&#39;s claims of misogyny: for one thing, Araeph showed that Mary Sues themselves almost always conform to damaging ideals such as supermodel looks and physique and the notion that the romantic love of a man (often a dangerous man) is the only path to happiness. For another, she explained that Mary Sue&#39;s gender is a byproduct of demographics, not the deliberate targeting of women: since most fanfic writers are female, naturally most bad fanfics are written by women, and therefore most of the fics we spork will have been written by women. This response led to the creation of a new section of the FAQ: For Other People—The Gender Card.<br><br>Boosette&#39;s accusations of bullying were a little better founded than her claims of misogyny, and as a result many of us took a long, hard look at the PPC and saw ways we could improve. Neshomeh dedicated another long LiveJournal post to the subject, having arrived at the conclusion that we should 1) eschew even offhand remarks about fanfic authors in our missions and all community spaces, and 2) strive to offer more constructive criticism rather than just writing missions. The dialogue leading to and following her post led Neshomeh to re-write PPC Wiki&#39;s Mary Sue article so that it no longer defined Mary Sues in terms of their relationship to their authors, but rather their relationship to the canon and the writing and plot of their stories.<br><br>There was also a push to write more non-Sue-centric missions—we do have a host of other departments for the purpose, after all—which sadly didn&#39;t last, causing the departure of at least one Boarder. Others found that they couldn&#39;t shake Boosette&#39;s accusations and departed or faded away for that reason.<br><br>By and large, though, the incident proved to be a learning experience, one that has made us more mindful of the words we use and how they affect our fellow fanfic writers.</blockquote>
<br>I don&#39;t really know how I&#39;d render that in the Protectorate of Plort universe. {= / Any thoughts?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>A misguided individual, with little experience regarding the true horrors of the Marizu attacks, began to spread messages attacking the philosophy of the knights, stating that their raids are too brutal and the reasoning for their attacks too unjust. The counter-philosophy began to take hold among some of the people of Weab, eventually spreading into the holdings of the Protectorate, and when the original revolutionary made a visit to the followers in Baroness July&#39;s barony in person, the anti-knighthood group was discovered, and the people of Plort became outraged. Knights took up swords to end what they saw as a group of Marizu apologists, and citizens began to fight amongst themselves over the slightest breaches in dogma, afraid that any deviants might join forces with the revolutionaries in opposition of Plort&#39;s founding principles. After great conflict, the wise and long-standing Baroness Araeph arrived herself in the areas where the revolutionaries were most hotly contested and hunted, spreading to the masses the true philosophy of the Protectorate, which some had forgotten or others had allowed to lapse in their rage, and with her help, a tenuous peace was reached. The original revolutionary had vanished after the first conflict broke out, and was last spotted leaving through El-Jheycom&#39;s port city of Sosumi, possibly to spread the message in a less volatile zone, but the falsehood of the revolutionary&#39;s words had become known among the people.<br><br>However, some of the knights had begun to realize that while some of what the revolutionary had said was incorrect to the point of propaganda, other points, twisted as they were by association with the untruths, struck deep to the heart of what Plort could become, or perhaps already was. Some knights pushed for reform, to reshape their Protectorate to become less brutal, less angry, and more focused on keeping the land safe and free rather than succumbing to bloodlust. Other citizens of Plort, perhaps now seeing the order of knights or even themselves in a new light, put down their swords and left in a drove, seeing the need to better themselves beyond the boundaries of the Protectorate.<br><br>It would likely need some tweaking, because it&#39;s a little simplistic and I wouldn&#39;t want to come across as insulting, though I deliberately provided as few names as possible. It&#39;s a start, though.</p>

            <p>&#39;Baron&#39; is a loose translation from the native Internetian (pronounced &#39;Inter-nay-shan&#39;) of Plort. The meaning of the original word (&#39;permigee&#39;) has changed somewhat over time; in the present time, the technical meaning is &#39;military leader&#39;, with no actual governing rights attached.<br><br>The &#39;barons&#39;/permigees of Borrd and Ozerbord are also ranked as <i>protectors</i> - as were Jay and Acacia, and the Triumvirate. &#39;Protector&#39; is probably equivalant to Duke, though it is inspired by the &#39;Lord Protector&#39; styling of Oliver Cromwell (and the fact that it allows for the reference in the name of the country ;)).<br><br>There is, obviously, no overlord - instead, the Protectorate and Refuge are ruled by the Council of Barons. For the most part, in realistic terms, there is no government at all - with no serfdom or feudal system, the main function is lawmaking and justice; the laws have changed little since Jay and Acacia, and the Iric idea of &#39;dars&#39; has spread to form a sort of police force.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>That was sort of off the cuff... essentially, &#39;baron&#39; is just a word in this context, because I like the sound of it. Being based on the PPC Board, there are no real &#39;ranks&#39; - the only authority (on the Board) is to be a Permission Giver, which is purely linked to the &#39;military&#39;/missions. It didn&#39;t seem appropriate to give the fictional versions significantly more power than that, so a low rank seemed wise. Similarly, there&#39;s no peerage below them, since the only &#39;ranks&#39; in the community are PG &gt; Permissioned author &gt; Non-permissioned member. That would be Baron &gt; Knight &gt; Civilian, in the parlance (and I tried <i>not</i> to make being a knight intrinsically better). You could also make an Oldbie/Middlebie/Newbie distinction, I guess...<br><br>I agree that there are almost certainly towns around most of the castles (the main exceptions being the abandoned ones, the temples, and Ofum, which is a training camp); Otik, of course, is right in the centre of Borrd.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I&#39;m still talking too much. Let&#39;s try again.<br><br>Baron Huinesoron is two people in one body. On the one hand, he is a &#39;baron&#39; of Plort - a man (or woman - there are no gendered nouns in Internetian) with the authority to gather an army from his domain, for the defence of the realms or to attack the Marizu. On the other hand, he is also Lord Protector of Ozerbord - which makes him technically an absolute monarch. Since the people of Plort have proven themselves to be rather... resistant to the notion of absolute dominion, he prefers to go by baron, and for ease of governance, synchronises Ozerbord domestic policy with that of Borrd.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>We know from the Knight Jumper&#39;s tale that the world is called Weab. We have the allied nations of Fanvik-Neht and Kwotef on the mainland, with wilderness to the north, and - according to the arrow - the Marizu lands probably forming the eastern borders. Kwotef clearly sits between Fanvik-Neht and the Marizu territories, while the nomadic Bronee clearly range across all of them. Tivit, judging by Jumper&#39;s flight, probably lies west of Fanvik-Neht, and likely curls to the north to partially enclose Konti-Nyuum, thus giving easy access to the flat northern shore via the Hyparlink trade route.<br><br>We also have Doktaru, location unknown, &#39;the Tynee-Vandam Co-Prosperity Hegemony&#39; [I admit I don&#39;t get this reference], which borders the Marizu (maybe even further east, or south), an unnamed kingdom which Dark Civilian Aakmal hails from, and... something named &#39;Nusantara&#39;, which  might be the name of the ocean? I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>And now we have a magic system! Sort of. It seems Iric has taken our mage-barons - both VixenMage (the clue is in the name) and the sorcerer Dann dwell there.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It took a while for me to work out most of the puns, but this sounds like fun and I&#39;d like to be a part of it. I&#39;m seeing my alternate self as a magic-user of some sort, though, and I&#39;m not sure what exactly the prerequisites are for magic, if there are even any set down yet. He&#39;s either that or a psion, and I don&#39;t even know if we want psionics in the world of Konti-Nyuum at all, for fear some Marizu invaders might go raiding towns in deadly Improbable Airships with mental assaults and telekinetic explosions. Then again, they might do that regardless, considering that the entities that they were based off of are usually fully capable of things that would be otherwise impossible. Maybe we&#39;d need some psions in the Plort armies to fight off the potential threat, but even if we do include psions, it runs into the same problem of prerequisites.<br><br>I&#39;m not entirely sure where he would set up, though. He&#39;d probably have an area in the southern Borrd region, near the boundaries of Wechi, considering the PPC areas that I most commonly frequent, but that puts him squarely within Baroness Araeph&#39;s territory, and I don&#39;t know her all that well. Or, practically at all. I read her DTE missions once, and the ones Cyba wrote for the department years later, but it&#39;s been a while. Does that matter?</p>

            <p>My king&#39;s domain was taken over by an usurper from the next kingdom. With his bad policy against orcs, (genociding them, destroying the gold mines they are forced to dig, forcing them to ballet, seriously?) and a host of bad habits that make Caligula seems a modest person, my kampung demands that we uproot and find some new lands to open. Confident that there are large swaths of Nusantara to explore, we don&#39;t expect a thunderstorm to attack our ship. A bomoh falls off his boat trying to pacify the garuda behind the storm, but only by me giving up the last of my pitis do the garuda leave. Seroiusly, garudas can go bandit sometimes.<br><br>After almost rioting over the lack of food, even after having to fish, we arrived at a new world we never recorded on our maps before. Lord Huinesoron take our oath of peacekeeping, and we set up a small town, Critta&#39; (Ch-rit-ta&#39;), where industry is to be done with the least cost to achieve best quality and highest profit. We have trouble setting up shop at first, but the ability of orcs to improvise and men to make life comfortable are most underrated. Many come to buy our textile, and soon some orcs  and men begin to craft fashionwear based on the memories of our former homeland.<br><br>I myself mostly sail beyond Plort to gain extra cash, returning with curry powder, onions, and garlic to spice up our paltry dish of fishflesh and cowflesh, as my orcs call it, in wheat gruel or cooked rice. Our meals are further enriched by cottonseed and some kangkung we bring along, which as luck would have it, have already mutated before we arrive to be edible. Our greatest risk, should we be besieged, are our inability to find enough wheat and rice to stock for emergencies. Seriously, my people inhale food.<br><br>Our main source of conflict with the rest of Plort is the accusation that Dark Lord Aakmal tries to spread Glitter throughout the whole kingdom, the kangkung weed infestation, his inability to answer summons, laziness to defend the land from Marizu, and the high price of spices at my town. Also the fact that he hasn&#39;t downgraded his rank to Knight yet.<br><br>[I ask that Critta&#39; is placed at the delta at the north, right between the boundaries of Huinesoron&#39;s and Phobos&#39; barony. And are we having four seasons in Plort? My people are going tobe extremely angry is I fail to secure winterclothing materials before the first snow falls.]</p>

            <p>&quot;Achoo!&quot; Dark Civilian Aakmal is given another coarse cloth by his attendant orc, Zagdukhyan. Note to self, cover face with cloth before entering a Glitter shop.<br><br>&quot;Thank you, Zag.&quot; Aakmal wipes his nose, which gives the cloth a slight shimmer of Glitter. It shines radiant upon the afternoon sky. Aakmal throws it away at the nearest rubbish bin, which is painted in the most shiniest of urple.  &quot;Where is the next shop?&quot;<br><br>Zagdukhyan quickly flips through the pages of his clipboard. &quot;The Great Wife of Legolas, something I couldn&#39;t read, the Destroyer of the One Ring, OrcbattleMistress, Gizrella Helios Manicurata Shop. Just a few shops away.&quot;<br><br>A few dozen of his orcs and men are pulling carts filled with cotton and linen cloth. As their walk through the glittering streets, they see a Marizu chopping off the head of a man after he ask her to stand up from her rickety chair momentarily so he could replace it with one that is better. Meanwhile a Martitzu is showing off his muscles while a flock of women gawks at him. They apparently empty their purses at his begging bowl.<br><br>Zagdukhyan stops the convoy a few minutes later. &quot;This is it.&quot; <br><br>The sign read &quot;De Grate Wive of Legolas(OMG, HE&#39;S SO HANDSOME !!!!1111!!!!), the Destoryer of the One Ring, OrcbattleMistress, Gizrella Helios Manicurata Shop.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal simply shrugs his shoulder. &quot;Close enough.&quot; He enters the shop, to see an array of glamorous colours and hues adorning the interior. Blue shirts clashing furiously with green trousers, pink dresses wrestling to a standstill with white torn jeans, black stockings doing the parry-riposte with golden armour, an a riot of activities by clothes driven by the magic latent within Marizu itself. Close by are wigs that change colour at random.<br><br>&quot;Wonder how they are going to wear those.&quot;<br><br>Suddenly a woman with the most weird proportions jumps in front of Aakmal. Despite wearing stillettoes, she does not fall back due to the soles breaking off. Aakmal double-back in surprise.<br><br>&quot;So, what could magical Ore-Sama do for you, handsome one?&quot; She smiles seductively at him. Her body is very thin, but her breasts are as large as a fat woman. Her shoulders are very small, and her legs are barely holding up her upper body&#39;s weight. As Aakmal stares to her eyes for a few seconds, her eyes begin to change colour from blue to white. <br><br>Aakmal quickly coughs and turn his head aside. &quot;Are you Gizrella Helios Manicurata? I believe you have ordered 50 rolls of 100-yard cotton and 70 rolls of 100-yard linen.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why yes, I have.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh thank you. Excuse me for a moment.&quot; Aakmal quickly walks outside and motions for Zagdukhyan to come. &quot;Yes, this is it. Make men carry the rolls. Orcs stay behind.&quot; <br><br>Zagdukhyan commands them to carry the rolls into the shop. It is piled on the floor next to the wigs, as Gizrella counts the number of cloth rolls being placed. She squeals in delight as sson as the rolls are finshed being placed &quot;Excellent! How much was it all again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;2 Legolas, 30 Shepard, 10 Ponies.&quot; Aakmal finds it quite weird names for gold, silver, and copper coins, but gold is gold. Gizrella gives Aakmal a bag of coins. Aakmal counts it and it somehow matches the number of coins required.

Aakmal is pushed face flat to the door as he could not open the door in time. He have to move backward with the door, which by the Gizrella thankfully stops pushing Aakmal forward. Unfortunately, this  allows Gizrella to look outside. To his orcs. She steps outside as she wriggles the fingers on her right hand as a zweihandler sword begin to materialise out of thin air.

            <p>&quot;Achoo!&quot; Dark Civilian Aakmal is given another coarse cloth by his attendant orc, Zagdukhyan. Note to self, cover face with cloth before entering a Glitter shop.<br><br>&quot;Thank you, Zag.&quot; Aakmal wipes his nose, which gives the cloth a slight shimmer of Glitter. It shines radiant upon the afternoon sky. Aakmal throws it away at the nearest rubbish bin, which is painted in the most shiniest of urple. &quot;Where is the next shop?&quot;<br><br>Zagdukhyan quickly flips through the pages of his clipboard. &quot;The Great Wife of Legolas, something I couldn&#39;t read, the Destroyer of the One Ring, OrcbattleMistress, Gizrella Helios Manicurata Shop. Just a few shops away.&quot;<br><br>A few dozen of his orcs and men are pulling carts filled with cotton and linen cloth. As their walk through the glittering streets, they see a Marizu chopping off the head of a man after he ask her to stand up from her rickety chair momentarily so he could replace it with one that is better. Meanwhile a Martitzu is showing off his muscles while a flock of women gawks at him. They apparently empty their purses at his begging bowl.<br><br>Zagdukhyan stops the convoy a few minutes later. &quot;This is it.&quot; <br><br>The sign read &quot;De Grate Wive of Legolas(OMG, HE&#39;S SO HANDSOME !!!!1111!!!!), the Destoryer of the One Ring, OrcbattleMistress, Gizrella Helios Manicurata Shop.&quot;<br><br>Aakmal simply shrugs his shoulder. &quot;Close enough.&quot; He enters the shop, to see an array of glamorous colours and hues adorning the interior. Blue shirts clashing furiously with green trousers, pink dresses wrestling to a standstill with white torn jeans, black stockings doing the parry-riposte with golden armour, an a riot of activities by clothes driven by the magic latent within Marizu itself. Close by are wigs that change colour at random.<br><br>&quot;Wonder how they are going to wear those.&quot;<br><br>Suddenly a woman with the most weird proportions jumps in front of Aakmal. Despite wearing stilettos, she does not fall back due to the soles breaking off. Aakmal double-back in surprise.<br><br>&quot;So, what could magical Ore-Sama do for you, handsome one?&quot; She smiles seductively at him. Her body is very thin, but her breasts are as large as a fat woman. Her shoulders are very small, and her legs are barely holding up her upper body&#39;s weight. As Aakmal stares to her eyes for a few seconds, her eyes begin to change colour from blue to white. <br><br>Aakmal quickly coughs and turn his head aside. &quot;Are you Gizrella Helios Manicurata? I believe you have ordered 50 rolls of 100-yard cotton and 70 rolls of 100-yard linen.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why yes, I have.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh thank you. Excuse me for a moment.&quot; Aakmal quickly walks outside and motions for Zagdukhyan to come. &quot;Yes, this is it. Make men carry the rolls. Orcs stay behind.&quot; <br><br>Zagdukhyan commands them to carry the rolls into the shop. It is piled on the floor next to the wigs, as Gizrella counts the number of cloth rolls being placed. She squeals in delight as soon as the rolls are finished being placed &quot;Excellent! How much was it all again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;2 Legolas, 30 Shepard, 10 Ponies.&quot; Aakmal finds it quite weird names for gold, silver, and copper coins, but gold is gold. Gizrella gives Aakmal a bag of coins. Aakmal counts it and it somehow matches the number of coins required. Crazy prepared she is.<br><br>&quot;Very well, pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Aakmal. Let me show you to the door.&quot; Gizrella says politely. Oh god, thought Aakmal.

            <p>At first I thought it was a typo, but it&#39;s been used in all of your posts mentioning the town, so it must be part of its official spelling.

            <p>I&#39;m not entirely certain what you mean. Does an apostrophe modify the letter immediately before it in the Malay language, and thus A&#39; would indicate a different, sharper type of A than the usual?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think chocolate itself would be outright poisonous to a horse, not in an emergency way. More like, just bad for the horse&#39;s health long-term. If you wanted to actually kill a horse with chocolate, you&#39;d have your work cut out for you.<br><br>However, it does occur to me that chocolate would be an excellent way to conceal many types of poisons--namely, the ones with a bitter taste. Chocolate is already bitter, though it&#39;s sweetened with sugar. Mix a bitter poison into a chocolate bar, and you might have a poisoned candy that tastes like low-quality chocolate rather than like a murder weapon. Would it work in the real world? Who knows. But it makes for a plausible murder plot in a detective story.</p>

<li>Alright, a murder mystery based on...chocolate? Um. First, in canon, chocolate is more then perfectly safe for ponies. Pinkie eats copious amounts of it, and Derpy was shown drinking from a chocolate fountain in all of her wall-eyed glory. Chocolate cake has been consumed, chocolate chip cookies, ect. But, fine, let&#39;s ignore canon for a moment and see what chocolate does to horses.<br><br>So, you know that chocolate is bad for dogs, right? Well, that is because of theobromine, a chemical found in chocolate, as well as some tea leaves and other foods. Fun fact, theobromine is derived from Greek, and translates into &#39;food of the gods.&#39; Anyway, the reason theobromine is bad for dogs is because it can cause problems with the kidneys, heart, and central nervous system, building up over time until they cause tremendous problems. It is fatal to dogs, and can even be fatal to cats. So, what about horses? All of that was near useless information. Horses need a LOT of chocolate to affect them near at all. Due to ponies being smaller then horses, it would require less Theobromine to affect them then horses, but much more then dogs. However, the chemical stays longer in their system then humans, so it can build up to cause problems over time. How long? Years. Of insane amounts of chocolate.* <br><br>However, Theobromine is banned form all horse races, as it is very similar to caffeine, and (supposedly) gives horses an advantage in races. Of course, it takes copious amounts to cause any physical effect on horses... Still, in acknowledgement of this, I would have horses get more energetic from eating chocolate. Like, if they had just a little too much caffeine. But, that&#39;s about all it does. As far as I know. Let&#39;s just say, most horse owners will recommend that you never feed them chocolate. It freaks them out. For some reason.*<br><br>2. Most zebra body language is the similar to horse/pony tells. They flick their tales when annoyed too. Though, usually they flick their tales to get rid of bugs.<br><br>*Don&#39;t take my word over some others. I just searched the internet and talked to my father who was (and in a way, still is) a horse nut. Should a veterinarian come in and say, &quot;Yeah, what he said? That&#39;s all BS. Feed a pony a bar of chocolate and they will curl over dead the next day,&quot; then listen to the vet.</li>

            <p>Me and a classmate (we&#39;re both 9th graders) have a game at lunch where we discuss the weird things we stumbled upon the night before.<br>I frequent Archive of Our Own (home of the omegaverse, among other things) and he frequents 4chan. Guess who always wins?<br>There are fantastic things on 4chan, as there are on everything (example, as mentioned, the MLP G4 fandom that my little sister, myself, my little brother, his best friend and my friend are all members of), but the bad parts are... bad.<br>Honestly, I think 4chan would need people dedicated to continuously readventuring into it. <br>And I fear imagining what it would look like, physically.</p>

            <p>That is to say, ask <i>me</i> about my state. Let me explain why.<br><br>I am currently in a training course to become a tour guide for the Alaska Railroad. I have to talk to tourists on and off the train about the history and culture of the state, tell personal stories about my experiences in the state, and direct tourists to other companies in the tourism industry. Basically, I have to know near everything about the state in order to answer near any question that could be thrown at me by anybody from anywhere in the world. To do that, I need experience. Since the PPC is an international community, I saw that this was a perfect opportunity to get that experience.<br><br>So, ask me anything about my state! Ask about history, ask about my personal experiences, ask about what you can do here in the beautiful state of Alaska! Truly, if it has to do with Alaska, and you are curious about it, ask me! If I do not know the answer, I will figure it out and come back with an answer and some new knowledge!<br><br>Now, as a side note, I probably won&#39;t be answering questions until Monday or Tuesday. The reason is because I&#39;m going on a bit of a road trip to Denali National Park, and largely without internet access. But, please, build up a list of questions for when I can come and answer them! If I have access to the internet while away, I&#39;ll be sure to answer any questions you guys have!</p>

            <p>Snowmageddon, among other things, actually.<br><br>So, here in good ole southern Indiana, we&#39;ve recently had a lot of snow (and by a lot, I mean maybe a foot or so). The people around here aren&#39;t used to snow (*eyeroll* my mom and dad were raised in Idaho and New Jersey, respectively, so we aren&#39;t terrified of it like everyone else seems to be), which I think is hilarious. We&#39;ve had nine snow days so far (not so hilarious) because of just a centimeter of snow. What do your schools wait for before deciding to close? I know my mom had &#39;mud days&#39; in Idaho, when the roads would be so muddy the busses couldn&#39;t travel- do you have anything like that?<br><br>What about the general climate? Are you in an area further north where the seasons are pretty much winter and summer, or is the climate in your area more like &#39;regular&#39;, with four seasons?<br><br>What sort of animals do you see every day? The most exciting/exotic wild things I&#39;ve seen here are deer, turkey, a fox, and roughly fifty cows that got loose from a nearby farm&#39;s pen and decided to take up residence on our front lawn. Okay, maybe that last one wasn&#39;t so exotic, but still.<br><br>Any particular holidays? Since we&#39;re just a few minutes&#39; drive away from Louisville, my school always gets a few days off for the Triple Crown thing. We also have something called Thunder over Louisville, which is a giant fireworks show that kicks off Derby week. Everyone gets drunk and/or mugged, trampled, wasted, arrested, knocked up- it&#39;s lovely, let me tell you. We tend to stay away from /that/ one.<br><br>What do you guys generally consider &#39;shorts weather&#39;? Here, it&#39;s about 65+, though I do have a crazy friend who I believe has worn pants twice in the past year: once for his Confirmation, once when his family and mine went sledding.<br><br>Also, is it possible to look across the Bering Strait and see Russia? :3 Okay, forget that, but what about neighborhoods? I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not muh like New York where everyone&#39;s on top of everyone else, or here where it&#39;s mostly suburbs and inner-city areas. Lots of nature? I miss having trees in my backyard.<br><br>Wow, I got really distracted. :P</p>

            <p>On a somewhat-related note, any idea how to contact Tungsten Monk to see if I can borrow the concept of the Fictionary? I need an excuse for Christianne to suddenly be able to determine what is canonical and what isn&#39;t in this mission; she&#39;s only versed in the reboot movies and the Original Series, and I&#39;m imagining her pulling out Trek trivia from the Fictionary like one would go about using the Memory Alpha wikia.</p>

            <p>Tungsten says, &quot;It seems to be fairly new tech, though, so there&#39;ll likely be some problems. The way I had it written, it can only install one universe at a time, and swapping cartridges rapidly may cause problems. So I&#39;d say to be careful taking it on crossover missions.&quot;<br><br>You may or may not need to swap cartridges for the various <i>Trek</i> spinoffs and the reboot. &quot;It would probably have one universe at a time loaded, but identify things as not-of-that-universe. So reboot!Spock in an Original Series fic wouldn&#39;t get analyzed, but display something along the lines of &#39;Universe Error, Displaced Foreign Canon&#39; or something. To be honest, I hadn&#39;t considered it; there might be a more efficient cartridge being developed now that can handle the load.

            <p>What I have is that Christianne is using the Fictionary to give her a better understanding of the Trek canon as a whole, kinda like a pocket version of the Memory Alpha wikia. <br><br>Maybe her Fictionary unit has some way of inputting searchwords to tell her if the things are canonical or not?

            <p>reading &quot;Tough to Take&quot; to get a better idea of how it works. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s sophisticated enough for a word search; or at least, the original model wasn&#39;t.

            <p>Here&#39;s the scene in question:<br><br>“Did you bring a Fictionary with you?” wondered Eledhwen.<br><br>“Yeah. How else would I know this much about a Canon I’ve barely set foot in?” Christianne took out the Fictionary with a flourish – it had taken on the appearance of a PADD for the occasion – and started inputting the queries, her tongue poking out from between her teeth.<br><br>There was an irritated buzzing noise. Christianne groaned, fumbling in her pack to resurface with a bag of cartridges. Eledhwen raised an eyebrow.<br><br>“Do you require assistance?”<br><br>“I left the Voyager cartridge in,” muttered Christianne as she removed the cartridge from the Fictionary and replaced it with the Reboot cartridge. “Damn thing, needing me to load separate cartridges. What’s the point? Why isn’t there wifi on these damn missions so that I can check things on Memory Alpha instead? Much more streamlined.” Another buzzing noise. “None of those are Reboot canon. I’m not that surprised. All right...”<br><br>Eledhwen watched on in amusement as Christianne began swapping the cartridges while muttering curses under her breath.<br><br>“Yes, I know Spock’s here, yes I know he’s from a different continua from The Next Generation. Go play with a cactus, damn you –” The Fictionary beeped, smoke starting to emerge from its casing. Spock looked at it with a mixture of distrust and surprise; Christianne glared at him before returning to her inputting and cursing.<br><br>“If DoSAT doesn’t come up with the streamlined cartridge soon, I swear on the spinning body of Tolkien – ah, yes,” she said after a moment. “No results for any of the canons. All of that was just a load of bull –”<br><br>“In essence, she does pose a threat to the security of the Enterprise,” interrupted Eledhwen. Christianne stuck her tongue out at her.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d offer to beta at this point, but it looks like you&#39;ve already got three people and I&#39;ve recently discovered I don&#39;t like working in a crowd, so:<br><br>1. It seems like you&#39;re introducing the Fictionary some way into the story. If Christianne appears to have been getting by without the Fictionary being mentioned until this point, what purpose does it serve to introduce the device at all? Why not just let her be competent?<br><br>2. If Christianne appears competent enough with the canon that her partner doesn&#39;t question it for some time, how much is she relying on the Fictionary? If she&#39;s using it a lot, how is it that Eledhwen doesn&#39;t notice?<br><br>3. It looks like the ability to enter queries is allowing the agents to avoid scanning characters directly. This is not how the Fictionary was originally conceived. Is it a better story this way, or just easier?<br><br>Obviously I don&#39;t have all the information, so feel free to disregard these if they&#39;re covered in the story already, but otherwise please give it some careful thought before you decide you&#39;re done editing. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. I debated saying anything, since this isn&#39;t really my wheelhouse, but I&#39;m going to: Do be careful with triggers. I&#39;m kinda of the opinion that there are two types: 1) the real PTSD sort of thing that can seriously psychologically compromise someone and requires hard work to overcome, and 2) the fake kind that people think they have because they believe they should never be upset by anything ever. I figure you&#39;re talking about the real deal, and that&#39;s serious, so it bears the risk of either making things too grim and unfun, or else being treated too lightly and coming off as fake. Tread softly, for here there be dragons.</p>

            <p>But if you want me to toss it over via email, I can give you a separate doc all to yourself.<br><br>1) From what I understand, she&#39;s been garnering wiki-esque trivia from the Canon Library and/or the Fictionary about this canon (she says she left the Voyager cartridge in because she just looked up the Starfleet Handbook on Personal Relationships), but like the rest of us, she&#39;s never quite sure when the species named by a Sue is canonical or not and needs to check. Hence the Fictionary, because is there another device that serves as a guide to the continuum?<br><br>2) She&#39;s competent enough when it directly applies to AOS and TOS, but she wants to make sure those species names are uncanonical. Would be embarrassing to charge for them if they were obscure species found in Deep Space Nine or something.<br><br>3) Those species don&#39;t come into play (and so cannot be scanned) until way later on in the story, and given the fact that Christianne&#39;s not in a great spot with the mission it seems for the best that they kill the Sue before all of that stuff with the uncanonical species happens. They have more than enough charges to justify the killing, IMHO.<br><br>If those aren&#39;t justifiable excuses for using the Fictionary, I could always come up with some other tech so Christianne can run her background checks. <br><br>And as for triggers, she has an anxiety attack and has to sit out a portion of the mission in a plothole before resuming the mission. Bleepesteem is involved. So far none of the betas have had issue with it, but that might change.</p>

            <p>This has reminded me that I told Herr I&#39;d beta something for him last week, and completely forgot about it in the midst of the Tripod issue and then getting swept up in the Medieval Board AU, so I should really do that first. My apologies to both of you. &gt;.<br>Based on what&#39;s here, though, I think the main issue for me is that you&#39;re going pretty far out of your way (and the Fictionary&#39;s) to work in a charge the agents don&#39;t need and aren&#39;t actually going to witness first-hand. My reading of TOS strongly suggests that agents must witness the charges, and things they don&#39;t witness cannot be charged for—there are multiple times when Jay or Acacia mentions something coming up in the fic and the other one goes &quot;drat, now we have to go watch it so we don&#39;t miss any charges.&quot; This rule is what forces them to go on missions in the first place rather than just MSTing the badfic from the safety of their RC, so it&#39;s pretty important. But, aside from that, if you don&#39;t need that charge to make the mission work, it seems like a lot of trouble (and words) to spend on something ultimately insignificant.<br><br>As a workaround, I&#39;d suggest that the agents can just as well gripe about the most-likely-uncanonical species without actually charging for them. It gets the same message across to the audience (&quot;what&#39;s the point in tossing out names no one will recognize when there are already dozens of known canonical species available for name-dropping?&quot;) without having to make the Fictionary jump through hoops so it can be an actual charge.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...of them griping about the uncanonical species, I had them ask the not-replaced Spock if he&#39;s ever heard of the species in question. Would that count as an observation (via asking characters) or do they still have to directly witness the things to charge for them?</p>

            <p>But there are two earlier instances where Christianne uses the Fictionary. I&#39;ll put them here; the second one I think I might actually need something to wave it at for her to get the info. <br><br>“No, don’t!”<br><br>Eledhwen raised an eyebrow. “Why not?” she demanded.<br>“Chocolate’s intoxicating to Vulcans!”<br><br>Eledhwen paused. “Really?” she asked, the Bleepolate halfway to her mouth. <br><br>“I’m pretty sure I read it somewhere,” began Christianne, before pulling out something that looked like a PADD and putting what looked like a Game Boy cartridge into it. She aimed the device at Eledhwen. There were a couple beeping noises and a puff of smoke, and Christianne emerged from said smoke with a couple coughs, a grimace, and an answer. “However, the Fictionary informs me that in an episode of Deep Space Nine this barkeep dude named Quark offered chocolate and Vulcan port to some Vulcan who dropped by his bar. Port’s a sweet sort of wine, so I’m guessing Vulcan port has a lot more sugar than other sorts of alcohol, which would explain why Vulcans are immune to alcohol, but not to – what?” She scowled at Eledhwen, who was grinning at her.<br><br>“If this makes me inebriated, and the fic is purported to be as bad as you seem to think, then do you not find it logical that I should face it in a better state of mind?” the elleth-turned-Vulcan asked with amusement in her eyes as she popped a piece of Bleepolate into her mouth. <br><br>~~<br><br>And the second scene:<br><br>In the Words, Pike gave Spock permission to court Seraphina. <br>[...]<br>As they watched, Spock exited the office to go teach his next class. Christianne pursed her lips and spoke up again. <br><br>“Anyway, before I got distracted by soppy romanticised abuse,” she said, with a small shudder that Eledhwen frowned at, “I was going to say that I thought it was the CMO that approved interpsecies relationships.” <br><br>“Really?” wondered Eledhwen. “Where does it state that?”<br><br>“I...” Christianne paused, fumbled for the Fictionary-disguised-as-PADD again, and inputted something again. There was a buzzing noise; Christianne growled, before removing a cartridge and replacing it with another. “Aha. Here it is. Starfleet Handbook of Personal Relationships. He’s gotta clear this with a medical officer before he goes boinking someone who isn’t his species. Or only half of his species. Admittedly, from what the Fictionary tells me this was only mentioned in the Voyager era, so that might not be a thing.”<br><br>“Still a logical precaution, though,” Eledhwen pointed out. “Remember when we first made our relationship known?”<br><br>“Nurse Hearth had us in for The Talk. I had never been more uncomfortable in my life,” agreed Christianne drily.<br><br>~~<br><br>And for the bit you saw, I can have her complain about DoSAT not making the Fictionary more streamlined and like a wiki instead of just a CAD with extra snark. Because I&#39;m under the impression that Christianne is a fairly spoiled Agent in terms of tech, and would rather just have a smartphone device where all her tech are apps.<br><br>(that sounds interesting and would probably lead to Issues in the PPC amongst the older generation of Agents.)<br></p>

            <p>It makes similar commentaries in its previous appearance, and being able to look up and compare canonicity of certain in-universe concepts seems like a logical extension of its previous pseudo-CAD readout function, with the added bonus that the new function would cause the Fictionary&#39;s name to make a little more sense.

            <p>The relationship itself isn&#39;t abusive, but the beginning of it is. Spock inadvertently mind-rapes the Sue to find out she&#39;s his soulmate, acts possessive of her and tells her not to see other people, instructs her not to lie to her, and informs her that since she&#39;s his t&#39;hy&#39;la she can&#39;t withold consent from him, etc. The Sue&#39;s own family situation presents us with a mother who&#39;d put Mrs Bennett from Pride and Prejudice to shame, who wouldn&#39;t protest the Sue getting into any sort of relationship.<br><br>So yeah. It really opens dubiously, so if there was any Toucan limit to pass, the moment should&#39;ve already happened.

            <p>Star Trek has any number of unrealized species already! I&#39;m not even sure how many of them are <i>only</i> consisting of names, and thus could easily be hijacked by any prospective writers, Suvian or otherwise, and given pretty much any traits one wanted! Then again, I hardly expect a Suefic to spend more than maybe a minute or two on research, even if it&#39;s just a brief check-over on a Star Trek wiki, so I&#39;m not sure why this is working me up as much as it is.<br><br>On a related note, do any of these new species appear in the story at all, or do they only just show up in exposition? Because if they do make physical appearances, I&#39;m wondering whether they&#39;d materialize in-mission as Generic Star Trek Aliens, like Quen and Natalie Green were at their recruitment, or whether they&#39;d take on appearances related to whatever brief characterization they were given in the story.</p>

            <p>I guess this is me, popping by. Not for any real  date-related reason, mind. My 4th PPC anniversary has come and gone, and I haven&#39;t got a birthday or anything for a few more months. <br><br>I suppose this is a conversational/plea for help post of sorts, I guess? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve been awfully quiet for a long time- I&#39;m not overly active on the board, and while I was a regular in the IRC, I&#39;ve managed to sort of drift away from even there. I was pretty active on Tumblr, but recently that stopped. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure how to approach this, except through wordvomit borne of panic. I&#39;ve had a rough past few years and that coupled with my anxiety about message boards and the like, means I&#39;ve sort of isolated myself. I look at the board and I see how many new names and faces there are and I always talk myself out of posting because I haven&#39;t got anything to offer to the community.<br><br>I guess then what I&#39;m trying to say is, how are you guys? Is everything okay? It looks pretty active and there are a few fun things floating (I like the idea of the Board Medieval AU a few threads down), but I might be really terrified a little of actually reaching out (and this may or may not be the dozenth draft I&#39;ve made of this trying to reword things). My fandoms are few these days - Harry Potter, Pacific Rim, Elementary - but I&#39;m willing to share and learn about anything, fandom or otherwise. <br><br>I like writing, but I haven&#39;t written in ages. I like reading but I have a hard time staying still these days- I haven&#39;t finished a reading a book in literally years. I&#39;ve managed to, through enough bad nights, destroy all of my social media accounts, and with my work hours I don&#39;t exactly have anywhere else to talk to people even in real life, and I&#39;m starting to perhaps slightly freak out a little.<br><br>I know I&#39;m not in a good place right now mentally/emotionally, and I guess this is a sort of throwing of the rope to see if anyone is still around who wouldn&#39;t mind talking to a hermit? I&#39;m in the pacific northwest, so my timezone isn&#39;t too awfully terrible for most I think. I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>May this find you all well and stuff. Feel free to ignore. <br><br>-Bryn.

            <p>I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t seen you in a while.  I kind of drifted away from the chat as well, due to being overly neurotic about the electric bill.  (I moved out and am paying my own bills now!  Yay/Wha!)  I&#39;m still working at the zoo, but I&#39;m now only a fifteen minute drive away, which cuts down on gas and frees up more time after work.  Where are you working now?<br><br>I&#39;ve kind of fallen out of fandom myself, unless you count the PPC as a fandom.  I play <i>Pokémon</i> a little, but most of my free time is making backup copies of old PPC spin-offs and working on the mini pages on the wiki.  My writing is taking a backseat, too.  (I did just watch <i>Sherlock</i> seasons one and two.  I was amazed at how much I, a Doyle-purist, found myself enjoying it.)<br><br>You don&#39;t need to work yourself up about talking here.  This message board is as casual as they come, and all you need to &quot;offer&quot; the community is your conversation and company.  There are still plenty of familiar faces around (like me!) (and also the new faces are good guys too), so there&#39;s no need to hang back.<br><br>I&#39;m also on Skype still; any time you feel like talking, please throw me a message.  I&#39;m at the zoo a lot, but I always get back home eventually!</p>

It&#39;s not on Netflix, but those are links to a version of the serial I found online, which is to the best of my knowledge not damaged. There are Sontarans attacking the Middle Ages, which is awesome for reasons that should not need to be elaborated upon, and also has the first appearance of Sarah Jane Smith, which makes it a good watch both for Doctor Who historical reasons and because Sarah Jane is also pretty great just in general.</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ve seen you around here before - I lit out of here last year because of school.<br><br>It seems to be going pretty well around here... if you want to talk about Harry Potter, I&#39;ve got a big-ish question prompted by something I saw on Tumblr: at what point does a character pass out of the realm of being forgivable, not factoring in backstory, death, or future actions?<br><br>Basically, I&#39;ve seen people complaining that Umbridge is treated worse than Snape by the fandom because she&#39;s female (and not played by Allan Rickman,) but I think that&#39;s sort of grasping at straws. Snape is a bastard on many levels, we can all agree, but for me I think Umbridge passes out of the realm of forgivability because of the things that she does: for example, in third year Snape attempts to defend Harry, Ron and Hermione from Sirius, who he thinks is a murderer. Sure, he probably wanted heaps upon heaps of revenge, and Harry has to live because of Dumbledore&#39;s plan, but he makes sure that Ron and Hermione are mostly okay because they&#39;re his responsibility. Umbridge, on the other hand, is willing to abandon the three to the centaurs to save her own skin, and fosters a culture of lies, betrayal, and torture. So, while I can see Snape having been fairer to the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff double potions section than he was to the Slytherin and Griffindor section in Harry&#39;s year, I can&#39;t see Umbridge as being fair or acceptable in any capacity.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say that Snape should have been allowed to keep teaching - he terrorized Neville, for a start, and his treatment of Hermione was horrendous, especially given that he was once more or less exactly in her shoes - but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say that the fanbase hates Umbridge because she&#39;s a woman. The fanbase hates Umbridge more because she is having &quot;I shall not tell lies&quot; carved into your hand with a pen, and the very real fear of authority cracking down on your world and turning it into a seething pit of fear and lies. Snape&#39;s the asshole teacher who grades based on whether or not he likes you and whose picture you will spit on in your yearbook. </p>

            <p>Hmm. It&#39;s certainly a thing to chew on- but I think it does sort of have some elements of sexism meshed in. Not necessarily in that people hate Umbridge more than they hate Snape, due to the fact that she&#39;s a woman, but because of her position and how her character gets &#39;punished&#39; and how Snape gets punished. <br><br>Snape terrorizes his students and is a quite prejudiced character, but people hate Umbridge because she&#39;s a character that we have all encountered in our lives. <br><br>She&#39;s an agent of the meddling government who intrudes and is flat out aggressive towards those who don&#39;t fall into the boxes she sets for people. But it&#39;s interesting because I think Alan Rickman does have some part in why people like Snape.<br><br>It&#39;s kind of odd, and I never really got into that kind of thing, but it&#39;s sort of a fangirl effect? He&#39;s tall, dark, and british. (Handsome is, of course, subjective). In the books he&#39;s described as oily and hawkish and all around abrasive. And anyone who has only read the books, will probably agree that he&#39;s generally unpleasant and a necessary* evil. Everyone encounters that one teacher that despises you and your guts and will purposefully (for whatever reason or bias) try to fail you in any way they can.<br><br>But in the movies, Snape is given this odd angle- because the movies weren&#39;t released in parallel with the books, fans of the books weren&#39;t going in blind. So they gave him a little more leeway, and cut out the bits where he was truly horrid because going in, we already /knew/ he was horrid and could fill in the blanks. They were arguably reasonable cuts, because translating the book word-for-word would lead to many hours long sagas and that wouldn&#39;t bode well for many. (Though I am quite upset about the bits that were cut. Peeves was one of my favourite elements of the books.)<br><br>So you&#39;ve got a watered down Snape, made up of the following elements.<br><br>~ Not very much screentime, and thus his cruelty is limited to maybe a few lines per movie. But, for good reason- He&#39;s not the lead! Harry and his friends are the focus of these films!<br><br>~ Played by Alan Rickman, who is not exactly awful to look at, and who is quite good at what he does. And since he was acting with knowledge of the character&#39;s then unreleased history, he added the sympathetic edge to the character that may have made him more appealing.<br><br>Whereas Umbridge was relatively untouched in the cutting room, because she was in two of the books. And she was a main antagonist, so her actions got more spotlight. In addition, her appearance in the movies were more accurate to the books. <br><br>She was basically designed to invoke that feeling of frustration when figures of authority step in and make your life hell- both as a teacher and as a student. <br><br>While Book!Snape was also designed along these lines, Movie!Snape... not so much. <br><br>But while maybe there isn&#39;t as much sexism in this as it is hokey screenwriting, there are some elements that are fundamentally different in how Umbridge and Snape are treated. <br><br>For example, the centaur scene, which highly implies some very very questionable things- I won&#39;t spell them out, but look up the mythology of Centaurs and their typical role in ancient myth. <br><br>This &#39;punishment&#39; for Umbridge, was laid down by Hermione. And later it&#39;s played for laughs in the hospital when Ron torments Umbridge by clicking his tongue like hooves. Yes, Umbridge is a rampant racist, and she&#39;s dreadful to non-humans, and to non-pureblood wizards, it&#39;s important to remember that SNAPE WAS TOO. <br><br>Snape&#39;s racism is played down considerably in the movies, and I think that that&#39;s used to sort of mentally Woobify him on the part of fangirls, because without looking at all of his actions in context (Hate crimes, calling close friends by racial slurs, harassing and mentally and verbally abusing students, attacking the child of your percieved &#39;true love&#39; years after her death simply for having the gall of looking like his parents, unhealthy relationships and power dynamics), you can forget that Snape is actually a pretty awful person. <br><br>Not to mention Snape&#39;s punishment for all of these actions (listed above) are... nothing. Basically nothing. Even in the books! Harassing, emotionally and verbally abusing students? A slap on the wrist. Calling Lily a slur? He loses her friendship... and then proceeds to never ever grow up or learn from his actions. He dies! But his death is very much played down, especially in the movies, which had a very obvious fondness for the Snape/Lily ship. <br><br>In the end, Harry even names his child &quot;Albus Severus&quot;! (Which, I&#39;m sorry, I still think is a stupid name.)<br><br>Snape gets a backstory, and rationalization for his actions:<br><br>~ Bullied as a child, <br>~ Abusive parents, <br>~ Difficulty socializing, <br>~ Had an actual attempt on his life as a teenager by the Marauders, and was told to bottle it up and never talk about it by an authority figure he trusted.<br><br>But he ALSO (and it&#39;s important to remember this is largely glossed over in the movies):<br><br>~ Joined a group of racists who were actively campaigning to kill people exactly like his so-called best friend.<br>~ Has killed people.<br>~ CALLED HIS BEST FRIEND A SLUR, when being what she was (Muggleborn) placed her life in actual literal imminent danger. <br>~ Harassed a student to the point where in a world where your parents have been tortured to the point of never recognizing who you are, and Voldemort is Real, and it was an agent of Voldemort who did that /to your parents/, your greatest fear is a teacher.<br>~ Was willing to sacrifice James and Harry&#39;s lives so that he could be &#39;rewarded&#39; with Lily, /regardless of her feelings/.<br><br>Yes, these things are awful, but intent does not, and cannot excuse actions, you know what I mean?<br><br>Plus, we know nothing about Umbridge or her motivations. She works for Fudge at the ministry. She&#39;s racist. She&#39;s fanatical in setting rules, and she can be very short sighted. <br><br>I&#39;m not saying that that&#39;s bad, and sometimes people are just awful regardless of upbringing, but I mean, look at the differences in how these characters are handled.<br><br>So while I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much sexism on the fandom&#39;s part that Umbridge is detested more, I think it&#39;s sexism on the part of the screenwriters on their portrayal of these two very similar characters.<br><br>*Necessary as in no matter what you&#39;re going to always face these people in your life. Not that they&#39;re built into the system, but that sometimes you literally have no recourse but to take it and once you&#39;re free, /leave/ and never go back.<br><br>Man this was way longer than I meant to make it. Whoops!<br><br>-Bryn.</p>

            <p>I was mostly going off of fan reactions from when I was still paying <i>attention</i> to the fandom, so up until book six, and really not the movies much at all. Basically, everyone I knew unanimously hated Umbridge, probably because during school, when it comes down to it you can get away from a bad teacher but not a bad administrator.<br><br>The thing I think that so many people who read Harry Potter as kids but maybe didn&#39;t read a lot of other complex stuff (not that this is against anybody, but I have a sort of different perspective since I finished Lord of the Rings and Sherlock Holmes before book five came out, so I was at least a bit used to the sympathetic characters not always being completely in the right,) is that people want characters to be rewarded as they think they deserve, rather than used to their purpose in the plot. Umbridge&#39;s expanded time in the movie was mostly due to the plot, and being the main antagonist for the entirety of a book: Snape&#39;s existence at Hogwarts is important, but like Malfoy he&#39;s a recurring problem that is usually more of an annoyance to Harry and Co. once a larger plot gets started. <br><br>I dunno, I might hate Umbridge more for personal reasons. I&#39;ve had plenty of stupid, unpleasant, or unfair teachers, just like anybody else, and Umbridge manages to be both the most awful teacher and the most awful administrator you can think of. <br><br>Yeah, the Centaurs. To be honest, I&#39;m not sure what to think there, because while JK doesn&#39;t shy away from having nonhumans be at least as unpleasant as humans... but I&#39;ve seen arguments for both the implication and the interpretation that they chased her through the woods and shot arrows at her until she made it back out of the Forbidden Forest. It&#39;s not good either way. On the subject of punishments, I&#39;m prepared to argue that the reason Snape never got punished was because he continued to be too useful to the plot up until his death, and other characters who were not continually useful ended up meeting unpleasant fates much more quickly.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying he should be excused, I&#39;m just saying that you could genderswap the relevant portions of the cast and have the same narrative, (though with less fangirl appreciation of Snape) so their different treatment is pretty much entirely due to their roles in the plot. <br><br>It just comes back to the problem I&#39;m having with the center of this argument (seriously, I&#39;ve gotta leave Tumblr alone for a while,) is that whether or not a character has a possibility of redeeming themselves has very little bearing on whether or not they do. For example, characters can do pretty awful things off screen, and the viewers will be somewhat more inclined to forgive them. The worst things that Snape ever did were functionally offscreen and, as you said, glossed over... as a contrast, we know literally nothing about James except for a couple tidbits dropped by Remus, Siruis, or Snape, yet the only thing he does &quot;on screen&quot; is the basis for most of the fandom&#39;s James hatred and a large chunk of the perception that Snape is misunderstood. Following from that, no matter what evidence there is or isn&#39;t that James stopped being a massive jerk, the fandom won&#39;t accept any of it if it didn&#39;t happen on screen. <br><br>Yeah, it&#39;s just... I remember why I generally stay away from that fandom, because the same arguments happen over and over. Personally, I think that Snape may have had some chance at partial redemption (helping take down Voldemort goes a little way towards implying that he&#39;d at least come down from a &quot;kill them all&quot; level of racism, which I don&#39;t think he was ever a in the first place) but he died before any redemption could have taken place, so we never will know.<br><br>Though, I do have to disagree with you on Umbridge&#39;s motivations: we know little of her motivations or rationalizations, but when she started torturing her students, I stopped caring about her motivations. <br><br>Fundamentally, I think Snape and Umbridge represent two different types of &quot;normal&quot; people caught up in fanaticism: Snape came from a difficult life, so he joined a racist fanatic group that said the status quo was wrong and needed to be overturned, Umbridge came from comparative privilege, so she supported a long-entrenched and usually more subtly racist regime that supported her privilege.<br><br>Some sexism may have come into play with the fandom&#39;s interpretation and the directing, but I&#39;m pretty sure that if Snape&#39;s on-screen actions had been Umbridge&#39;s, he&#39;d be just as hated. Unless the Alan Rickman thing is influencing people, which is very possible, given how many people think Bellatrix is kind of awesome when SHE TORTURES PEOPLE TO INSANITY and is generally even more of a dangerous psychopath than Voldemort. I&#39;m pretty sure that for her, it wasn&#39;t a &quot;violence because of my ideology&quot; thing, it was a &quot;Violence! Yes, I was raised in this ideology, point me towards the victims.&quot; Part of the difference in her perception compared to Umbridge is probably the phenomenon of liking the death-eaters because of reasons I&#39;ve never been able to understand, but part could be because she&#39;s portrayed by a popular and attractive actress. So... fan opinions based on the movies may include sexism, but may also have a lot to do with attractiveness.<br><br>... Which I don&#39;t actually get, but I&#39;m an odd duck. Also, I think my personal middle school experience may have a lot to do with why I hate Umbridge worse than anyone else in HPverse. :D<br><br>These are long, aren&#39;t they? :D</p>

            <p>True, and I guess I can get that. Snape was more important to the plot, but it still bothers me that he was left relatively unscathed for his actions as they happened.<br><br>And yes, Tumblr. It&#39;s got it&#39;s good bits, and it&#39;s loud bits. Sometimes those do not overlap XD<br><br>I dunno! I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, I adore the Harry Potter books. I learned to read with those books! But it does sorta feel a little hokey at times. <br><br>(Things like, why couldn&#39;t Harry use the established earlier in that book magical mirror to contact Sirius, instead of storming to the ministry and ending up with Sirius dead? My rationalization is that Harry is not the sharpest tool in the shed and angst clouds judgement... and memory?)<br><br>I agree that perhaps the centre of the argument, that the sexism lies with the fandom... does seem flawed, and I agree that I think it&#39;s more of a how they were portrayed in addition to casting choices.<br><br>It&#39;s like why fangirls like/d Edward Cullen, from Twilight. He looks pretty, and you can ignore the fact that he has LITERALLY KILLED PEOPLE and he needs gorram ENDANGERED ANIMAL GOREJUICE to sustain himself instead of just eating a gorram deer or something. But he&#39;s pretty, so we can excuse his deeply abusive power dynamic with Bella! PRETTY PEOPLE MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER. <br><br>And ugh, don&#39;t get me started on Bellatrix fans who are Bellatrix fans because she&#39;s &#39;quirky&#39;. Not because she&#39;s a complex character with an interesting history and psychological status and the way she&#39;s portrayed as being basically completely removed from her conscience, but because she&#39;s played by Helena Bonham Carter. But I also might have a slight aversion to Fandom!Bellatrix due to how much Hermione/Bellatrix fanfic I&#39;ve seen. Stuff of nightmares, man. <br><br>Forced marriages by law... everywhere... so many... hurt/comfort... bad Stockholm syndrome plots... can&#39;t... hold... on... much... LONNGGERRRRRR.<br><br></p>

            <p>Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s not <i>satisfying</i> that people like that get off lightly in fiction, but I think the choice to have that happen was the plot, rather than any attempt to excuse him.<br><br>My childhood before Harry Potter is basically Nancy Drew. :D Believe me, they&#39;ve cornered the market on hokey: at eight or nine, once the plots started to become obvious (I&#39;d only read several dozen of the things...) I decided I was good at solving mysteries and was going to become a great detective.<br><br>Yeah, Harry&#39;s angst-induced stupidity was a major plot breaker for me. I understand it better as an adult - high anxiety and repetetive trauma situations sap your IQ and decisionmaking process like nothing else, and Harry spent that year being tortured by Umbridge, having his brain invaded by Voldemort, learning occulmancy (which can&#39;t be great for the psychological health,) and worrying that Voldemort was going to show up any day and kill everyone he loved... all the while existing in a perverse reality full of authority figures who swore that he was crazy for thinking that Voldemort could ever return. Speaking from my later psychology research, it&#39;s that doublethink environment that messes with your memory.<br><br>See, Cullen always bored me. But I am also the odd variety of human that does not do attraction, so I don&#39;t give a Flaming Denethor about his sparkly posterior. I found the fact that they ate endangered predators ludicrous, and spent the entirety of Twilight hunting for the plot. :D (I located the plot in Eragon, which is why I stuck with it, because it was &quot;okay&quot; fantasy that would stand up to a round trip car ride.)<br><br>Yeah, Bellatrix actually terrifies me. Molly just getting rid of her for all posterity was one of the crowning moments of book seven for me. Shipping in HP fandom terrifies me as well, but for completely different reasons.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to need a little context for this, because all I&#39;m seeing here is Edward Cullen dressed in a safari hat, super-speeding around the savannah shooting at cheetahs with a rifle. Incidentally, I would definitely watch a movie that involved vampires hunting down pretty much anything someone would make a National Geographic documentary about while wearing safari hats.</p>

            <p>Domestic cats, I mean. Not pumas.<br><br>I&#39;m a cat person and it&#39;s not exactly a nice thought to me, but cats are probably the perfect Twilightverse vampire prey.<br><br>-They can&#39;t drink donated blood and they can&#39;t eat humans without either killing or turning them.<br><br>-Carnivores are the best substitute, for some reason. I have no idea whether the author ever considered why (beyond the testosterone overload), but if you look back at &quot;Dracula&quot; and at Renfield&#39;s insanity, it makes sense. He&#39;s feeding flies to spiders and spiders to birds, and then he wants a cat. He&#39;s trying to collect life. So it would make sense to me that, for a vampire, the blood of a carnivore would have collected more life than any other animal&#39;s.<br><br>-Size doesn&#39;t matter. If it did, vampires would go for men over women (men have more blood) and adults over children (ditto). But they don&#39;t. Apparently, vampires can sustain themselves on very little blood, which makes sense if you consider, along with the above, that it&#39;s the *life* in the blood that matters, not the blood itself. (Which is also why donated blood won&#39;t work; there&#39;s no metaphysical connection allowing the vampire to drain the life of another.)<br><br>So why cats? Well, cats are unique. Cats are obligate carnivores--that is, they eat meat and only meat. A dog will eat meat and bread and anything it can get. Same with a pig, or a &#39;possum, or a rat. They eat meat, but they also eat other stuff. So the life of a cat is one that has been sustained almost entirely on the lives of other animals. (We are assuming the cat is allowed to hunt rather than fed cat food, naturally.) Cats are deadly hunters who eat only meat; the best mousers can bring in ten mice a day just for fun. With the high metabolism of the warm-blooded, cats require comparatively more calories to live, meaning they have to eat more than a reptile or a fish would--making them a better choice than carnivorous fish or snakes.<br><br>Why cats rather than pumas? Because there are more cats out there, and because they breed faster. A cat becomes fertile at five months and can be expected to have an average of four kittens every four months thereafter during the warm kitten season. Cats are smaller and less territorial than mountain lions, meaning they can live in groups, need smaller territories, and can survive on fast-breeding mice and rats in an agricultural setting. A vampire which kept a barn full of cats could expect to have regular meals of high-quality blood from a sustainable population.<br><br>Why don&#39;t Twilightverse vampires eat cats? Because the author doesn&#39;t want them to do something so strange and horrifying as killing our loved house-pets and valued working animals. But wouldn&#39;t the story be better if they did?<br><br>If you&#39;re a vampire, you have to deal with the reality that you have to kill directly to survive--you can&#39;t just eat plants, and you can&#39;t eat meat that&#39;s neatly processed and packaged beforehand. You have to kill with your own two hands. Psychologically, you are very different from the typical human, especially the typical modern human. But if you are being sensible, and you want to survive without killing people (even if you are amoral, killing people is dangerous and unsustainable), you will have to go for eating small, fast-reproducing predators like domestic cats. Interacting with humans gets more awkward because your life is truly different from theirs. You are an alien, inhuman creature, a predator, a parasite--not just a sparkly pretty boy for a mary-sue to fall in love with.</p>

            <p>Which frankly, leads to an unsustainable food source.

            <p>Sorry, that should read books.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to change it.<br><br>Anyway, the in-universe explanation is that carnivore blood is the closest thing to human blood that vampires can go for while still remaining &quot;vegetarian&quot;.

            <p>Okay, so I&#39;ve been following the sporkings on Das-Sporking, and leaving the potential aspects borrowed from mormonism <i>waaaay</i> aside for someone who is more qualified than me...<br><br>The in-universe explanation does not actually make sense within the universe. Humans are omnivores, and pretty much obligate omnivores at that. (Humans can exist on a vegetarian diet if equivalent proteins found in plants are consumed, but cannot exist on a completely carnivorous diet.) Large carnivores should not be the &quot;closest&quot; match to human blood: bear might be somewhat similar, as they&#39;re partially omnivorous, but the most common omnivores and semi-omnivores in North America are, in roughly descending order of average size:<br><br>- pigs<br>- Badgers<br>- raccoons<br>- possums<br>- weasels, otters, ferrets<br>- Minks, martens, and sables<br>- rats and assorted related rodents<br><br>Now, if one were inclined to give SMeyer credit, you could argue that larger wildlife, such as grizzly bears, with a bodymass of two to four times that of a human, would be efficient hunting, as it would provide blood equivalent to multiple humans and keep a vampire satisfied for longer. This is canonically <i>WRONG</i>, since it is demonstrated time and time again that vampires do not have a set amount of blood that they are required to consume to be &quot;full,&quot; nor do they seemingly have an ability to binge and digest like a reptile. Vampires can drink ten or fifteen people without getting full. They do not stop until they run out of convenient victims. Their appetite is literally bottomless, <i>yet it is clear given how long the main characters can go without hunting</i> that only a small amount of blood is sufficent: the vampires just <i>want</i> another human juice box.<br><br>Truly, Meyerpires are abominations of nature. Excuse me, I&#39;ve got to go find the Winchesters, just thinking about this mess makes me yearn for these things to get salted and burned...</p>

            <p>It would almost be an improvement if one of the villainous vampires was introduced by saying &quot;I only drink blood from the most adorable of puppies and baby rabbits!&quot; At least over-the-top campiness is a step up from bland blandness or unmitigated reprehensibleness that tries to pass itself off as heroic behavior.<br><br>As for the endangered animals, well, I never really understood the justification behind drinking animal blood at all, in part because I never read or watched Twilight but in part because it makes no sense. It would be one thing if the Cullens went Black Ribbon Society and abstained from any blood whatsoever, but why hunt down and drain specific animals? It&#39;s going to take more energy to track and restrain a single puma than it would to drain any seven humans, and unless the blood drains kill the humans, which I don&#39;t think they do, there&#39;s not really a moral justification. Why not have the Cullens distinguished as good guys because, say, they only drain the blood they need to function while the bad guy vampires gorge themselves because it gives them more power, or the good vampires only drain blood from knowing, consenting hosts while the bad guys break into people&#39;s rooms at night and drink their fill while sitting on the chest of some stranger? This is not that difficult!</p>

            <p>Other than a few slightly different antigens, most mammals have very similar blood to that of humans. If human blood will make vampires go on a rampage, then 1) why doesn&#39;t most other blood have the same effect and 2) why are humans the preferred food source for so much of the vampire population if drinking other blood will leave them in further control of their senses and less likely to reveal the existence of the vampire world when they animalistically jump on the ruddy-faced guy in town square?<br><br>Also, if contact with any creature to drink their blood spreads venom that, from what Bryn&#39;s post above said, turns them into vampires, how are the vampires not extinct? If any feeding converts someone into a vampire or a bloodless corpse, you would run out of food within a few months when everyone decides to move away from the radius of disappearing citizens centered on the house on the hill full of creepy pale people. And that&#39;s if they don&#39;t decide to spread, because if they did, it would be worse than a zombie apocalypse. At least zombies don&#39;t need to eat much, and if pressed, could consume one another without giving much of a thought, since they&#39;re mindless and hold no value on the continued existence of themselves or others. In the Twilight vampire apocalypse, there would be a constant unsustainable horde of sparkly invincible people swarming out of one location, needing to drain hundreds and later thousands every night to stay... wait, what happens to Twilight vampires when they don&#39;t get enough blood? Do they go dormant? Die? Turn back into humans? Probably not the latter.</p>

            <p>I thought zombies just kind of wandered around and swarmed meat creatures when they found them. They just don&#39;t really acknowledge other zombies. But then again, I&#39;m a fan of the Zombie Survival Guide, so I&#39;m not too familiar with how other zombies work.<br><br>Anyway! The Cullens were abnormal, even by vampire standards. Because they are animals instead of people, they could stay in one place for a few years at a time. Pretty much every other vampire coven was nomadic, so they&#39;d wander into a city, nom some hapless victim, and continue on their merry way. No one&#39;s going to think much of a missing person in a big city- it happens all the time, so yeah.<br><br>Of course, that doesn&#39;t explain how the Volturi have managed to hold a base in the same city for over three thousand years. Apparently they go after tourists, because of course nobody would realize tourists in Volterra were always vanishing without a trace. Das-Mervin mentioned something interesting in her Twilight series sporking- maybe the Volturi use Alec&#39;s power (cutting off all your senses) to basically temporarily disable the tourists, they give the tourists a little nick, collect some blood in a bowl/bottle, have some other vamp we haven&#39;t heard of wipe their memories, and send them off. <br><br>And are you kidding? There&#39;s no way those precious Sparklepires would have any negative effects of starving. Their eyes turn black and they get cranky (read: more murderous), and that&#39;s pretty much it. Apparently they&#39;re weakened by not eating/not eating humans, but to be honest, there is almost no mention of that in the books and it seems like a very minute power difference anyway. *eyeroll*</p>

            <p>... And that Ofsted, the schools governing body in the UK, was doing a whole lot of meddling while she was working. Yeah.<br><br>However, it might be worth mentioning that while she&#39;s back at the Ministry, she&#39;s not only suffering from PTSD (as evidenced by Hermione deliberately triggering her at the end of Order of the Phoenix - yeah, she did that) but under the effects of a Horcrux. Remember that she was wearing the locket on a regular basis for an unknown but presumably lengthy period of time, and remember what the very briefest exposure did to the Trio.<br><br>None of this excuses what she did, but it does perhaps explain a bit more of it.

            <p>Hm. Honestly I would have loved more about the world itself- like, what do wizards do? We don&#39;t see much about teaching maths at Hogwarts or non-textbook based literature. Is there Wizarding vocational schools? Do little witches and wizards get sent off to primary? Or is it usually relegated to homeschooling by the parents? <br><br>How much are parents expected to teach? Are they expected to teach their kids just the basics? How do you cover wand safety, and privacy. Do some parents sneak their kids into muggle schools? What if they&#39;re revealed? Is there is a penalty or department that works with parents to ensure education?<br><br>What about jobs? In a world where the financial district is controlled by Goblins, and it seems like most careers are: Shopkeeper, Teacher, Healer, Athlete, Police officer, or Ministry Worker... not a lot of options! How do they handle things like fluctuations in muggle economy (And would they even be affected by it?)? With a population as tiny as theirs, how do they function alongside the muggle world without dipping in or collapsing in on themselves? <br><br>Plus, with things like transfiguration and charms, how do you regulate raw materials? How does the wizarding world deal with laws regarding illicit things that aren&#39;t spells? Do you cut off access to the potion ingredients? But then, what about people who have access to it without needing to go through the marketplace? And what about non-illicit potions and things that require those ingredients? How do you handle that in a world where the government is obviously more of a bureaucratic figurehead than anything else? WHAT IS FOREIGN POLICY LIKE? HOW DO YOU HANDLE IMMIGRATION?<br><br>*ahem*<br>&gt;.&gt;<br>&lt;.&gt;<br>Sorry. I have a lot of feelings about insufficient world building. </p>

I would imagine that there&#39;s some form of spell-checking quill, or spell, but I doubt, given the age and spelling of some of the things that they&#39;re quoted within the series as reading, their spelling and grammar is going to improve on it&#39;s own.<br><br>Snape: I have been complaining to the other heads of houses for several years about the abysmal spelling in their students&#39; homework.

            <p>Nobody ever learns the basics of non-magical study in the Harry Potter universe! Sure, they get at least basic literacy and such, but we never see anyone learning mathematics, or biology, or basically anything that requires non-mystical knowledge. Which links into another thing I never got and was never explained: Why do most of the wizards live like they&#39;re in the seventeenth century? According to Rowling, the series takes place in the 1990s, so it&#39;s not as though they&#39;d have access to wireless Internet or anything, but when the people outside have advanced technology and you&#39;re still pre-Industrial Revolution, that&#39;s going to cause some problems. I mean, I understand that the wizards don&#39;t want to associate with the non-magic folk for secrecy&#39;s sake and to keep the masses from stealing magical artifacts to try and give themselves superpowers, but Arthur Weasley is the only one in the series who even bothers to <i>wonder</i> about advanced technology and how it works, and he&#39;s treated as a crazy. There&#39;s no real reason for them to stay so detached that they can&#39;t at least adopt some modern trappings, since they would stand out even more if they look like they&#39;re lost on the way to the Anachronism Convention every time they step out of the Designated Wizard Population Zones.<br><br>If they aren&#39;t given the knowledge of how things work and why, wizards will just get curious, because they&#39;re people, make silly assumptions, because they don&#39;t know any better, and then it&#39;s a slippery slope to Arthur Weasley&#39;s antics of stealing a car and bringing it to life while simultaneously bestowing the ability to fly upon it. Keeping people with potentially titanic supernatural power in the dark about any advances in knowledge and industry whatsoever is going to lead to catastrophe one day, quite possibly when someone stumbles onto some Muggle movies out of context and tries to magically create some of these &quot;helicopters&quot; and &quot;shotguns&quot; because they look like fun.</p>

            <p>He isn&#39;t blinded by the cultural assumption that the wizards are so much better than the muggles, so he actually attempts to figure out how muggle inventions work!<br><br>Honestly, the only thing even approaching an excuse is that wizards are just that much of snobs, even the muggle-borns, after going through Hogwarts, that they don&#39;t even consider learning muggle methods. Or the ones that do quietly go back to living hidden among muggles and never have contact with the magical world unless they need supplies.<br><br>I have a new headcanon: in ordinary circumstances, many muggleborns get their GED, work muggle jobs, get money changed over at Gringotts when they need to shop in Diagon Alley, teach their children to solve algebra problems and de-gnome the garden, read <i>The Prophet</i> and their local newspapers, send the kids to muggle primary schools so that they&#39;ll understand and appreciate muggles (don&#39;t go thinking that you&#39;re *better* than your grandparents, you&#39;re just different, and that&#39;s not a bad thing,) and the rest of wizarding society just ignores them. But really, these witches and wizards are better adapted than those that scorn them. They can thrive in both worlds. <br><br>The ones that understand muggles don&#39;t need to be a more powerful witch or wizard than you, they just need to figure out what the right tools for the job were. They keep a weather eye out for ascendant dark lords, or general anti-muggle sentiment - the muggles in the village are their <i>neighbors,</i> and they (mostly) like them, thank you very much, don&#39;t let a lorry hit you on your way out.<br><br>When the time comes, they send their children to Hogwarts. They tell them that it&#39;s a wonderful place, but that they must always remember where they came from. The parents are huge and blatant nerds, and they remind their kids while standing on platform 9 &amp; 3/4 that with great power comes great responsibility. Sure enough, at Hogwarts these kids are the first to welcome the muggle-borns, the ones who know how to fix a torn robe or spellotape your book back togeher. They pass out their comic books, and wizard-born children freak out over how the pictures don&#39;t move. They stay up late telling the other children about computers and classic rock and the first man on the moon, and to eleven year-old students who have never traveled far except by flu powder, side-along apparition, or the Hogwarts train, automobiles and airplanes and video games are a magical and alien world.</p>

            <p>Plus, how dangerous is it to teach folks magic, but never have them question the basics of what it is and why it does stuff? If you don&#39;t understand the fundamentals of why the thing you&#39;re doing is doing it, and it&#39;s your job? That&#39;s ridiculous! Like, I imagine it&#39;s got something to do with assumptions.<br><br>Spell A works because you Just Know spell A works, and it always has worked and that&#39;s all you need to know.<br><br>But what if you&#39;re trying to make up a spell? Are the words actually needed, or is it just intent? Where do things come from, and where does the excess matter from like, transfiguration go and/or come from? You turn say, a bookcase into a glass of water, where does the excess bookcase bit go? Do you just get a massive glass of water that&#39;s of the same mass as the bookcase? Or does that matter simply evaporate and you&#39;ve got to breath the excess wood-dust for a bit because it&#39;s gone into the air around the glass.<br><br>Or what if it just sort of sticks around and you&#39;ve got to &#39;shed&#39; the excess magic by doing something else that &#39;uses&#39; the extra bookcase up. Like a charm or transfigure something small into something large?</p>

            <p>I really liked the first chapters, got lost somewhere around when <br><br><br>~ SPOILERS BE HERE ~<br>They go to bust Bellatrix out of Azkaban. (Also, ditched because Bellatrix&#39;s brainwashing and, well, <i>Azkaban</i> was sort of a trigger-y thing, personally.) I think I got to the point where they finally leave?<br>~ AT THIS POINT ALL SPOILERS HAVE BEEN SLAIN ~<br><br>I really liked the approach to how the magical world actually has a working economy, and I know that the fic is highly influential to all later &quot;Child Genius Harry&quot; fics, and a lot of popular alternative character interpretation. I have to say, though, at many times it felt to me as if Harry was being transformed a little bit into Ender Wiggin. (It could be the Defense against the Dark Arts battles, though.)<br><br>Overall, a highly interesting fic!</p>

Putting it together to work in some way is just sort of like the world&#39;s biggest jigsaw. <br><br>I have a lot of headcanons, one of which is that the economy has not modernised, so aside from shopkeeper/teacher/celebrity/creature wrangler/government employee/healer, we&#39;ve basically only got people who produce goods like potions and new spells and textbooks, so Hogwarts is basically trade school, and OWLS are to narrow down which trade you can be in. <br><br>(Also, aside for influential and affluent Slytherin families, I feel that it&#39;s pretty impossible for them to actually remain apart from muggles...)<br><br>See, this is why when I wrote a magical universe intending to do multiple books with serious plots, I made sure to regulate the magic to within an inch of it&#39;s life.

            <p>That &quot;conflict&quot; is the least-linked element. Of course, it could be because conflict is more of a required basic component of storytelling (except in stories that use contrast and transition as their driving factors... though it&#39;s easy to see those kind of plots as being driven by a thousand miniscule conflicts,) and it could be because TVTropes is focused on the specific. <br><br>The fact that Face-Heel Turn is the trope most linked suggests that either it&#39;s prominent in the most referenced fandoms on TVTropes, or that it&#39;s being overused or become overly general...<br><br>I need to stop thinking now.

            <p>So it&#39;s just... a bunch of assorted tropes? Thrown together in a rougly table-like format? What makes these ones particularly distinctive? Why are they arranged like that? Normally, a periodic table groups elements that share similar properties into columns, and groups related columns into sections, but this just seems to dump any tropes that might be found in a single index into an arbitrary number of periodic columns and then moves on immediately to something else. At least the left columns seem to have sort of a theme, namely the factors involved in a story&#39;s construction, or at least tied to its construction out-of-universe, but after that, it just goes off the walls. And why are the fandom tropes in the same spot as the noble gases? Noble gases are the least reactive of all elements, while fandom is traditionally the most reactive group in all of the human collective consiousness!<br>Okay, that last one <i>might</i> have been a joke.<br><br>I do love TVTropes, and as many do, I reference it and spend time on it more than is probably mentally healthy, so I&#39;m not anti-trope. I just have no idea what this table is trying to do.</p>

            <p>The problem is, I thought it might be popularity? Number of links determine the placement on the board. But that doesn&#39;t seem to be it.<br><br>Popularity calculated by number of pages that link to those specific pages. (Measured, for some reason, in kilowinks (Links within the tropes community pages.)) But that doesn&#39;t make much sense because the numbers are all over. Is it a mesh of the author&#39;s personal bias and an arbitrary pool of tropes pulled from the most &#39;popular&#39; on the site? I dunno. It seems confusing to me. There doesn&#39;t seem like much rhyme or reason to how the individual columns (horizontal or vertical) are placed or chosen. But it&#39;s a neat idea, I guess?</p>

            <p>I suspect that would be more useful than chemistry at this stage.<br><br>But... eh, let&#39;s at least outline. Ignoring the proton count (because it doesn&#39;t apply here), we have three or four criteria for laying out the table:<br><br>-Electronegativity, or rather reactivity. This increases towards the top right and bottom left corners (specifically, e-neg increases to top right, but e-pos increases towards bottom left). The exception is the noble gases, which are virtually zero.<br><br>Reactivity would seem to correlate with how popular a concept is, or rather, how well it meshes with others. No, rather, I think it&#39;s how prone it is to taking over the story. To take a chemistry analogy, if you add potassium to sodium chloride solution, the more reactive potassium will drive out the sodium.<br><br>-Group, or column. These group elements which are similar in some way - and also, which can easily replace each other. So in each column you&#39;d have a set of elements which can be interchanged, in order of their ability to dominate the story.<br><br>Related to this is the electron count, which in our case is &#39;elements they go well with&#39;. Group VII elements, for instance, will go very nicely with Group I elements - but need extra work to compound with Group II. So, for instance, songfic-Mary Sue is a simple compound that clearly works easily, while CYOA-Mary Sue is more difficult, and requires more to work.<br><br>-Block, or maybe element type. There are four &#39;blocks&#39; on the Periodic Table: the s-block of reactive metals, the p-block of (mostly) non-metals, the d-block of metals, and the f-block of unstable elements (this is a simplification, naturally). Someone already suggested putting the pure-badfic elements at the bottom, which is the f-block. Then I guess we&#39;d split into cast/plot, and further divide cast into setting and characters.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PeriodicStory.png"><br><br>The main thing that needs to be done to keep it analogous is making sure that the first and second columns from the left and right work well together - that is, that aspects of plot that are affected by setting are in the last two columns of the plot-block. <br><br>(For fun, the blocks should of course be Setting, Plot, Demographic, and wtF, to match their real names)<br><br>The generics are things like Generic Foodstuff, Generic Surface (Generic Ability to Not Go To The Toilet?), which appear virtually everywhere, but have no impact on everything. <br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to follow Bryn&#39;s lead and do a sort of &quot;Oh-by-the-way-I&#39;m-back&quot; post. I didn&#39;t really intend to drift away from here, but life kept <i>happening</i>, and then all the stuff happened at once, and meanwhile there were laptop issues upon laptop issues (upon laptop issues) (and still kind of are).<br><br>But I forgot that <a href="http://silmarillionproject.tumblr.com/">this</a> existed, and today, I ran across it again and went &quot;Has anyone told hS about this? I hope so...&quot; but in case the answer is no, here it is! And, while I&#39;m plugging things, did you know I have two RL-related blogs now? <a href="http://talkingtocrows.tumblr.com/">Talking to Crows</a>, which is mostly a flora-and-fauna Tumblr, especially about the local crows, but also about other things, and <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/theferalsheep.blogspot.com">Feral Sheep</a>, which is a significantly more personal blog about religion, and all the parts of life it intersects. (note: this tends to be all of them.)<br><br>Since I wandered off the last time, I have: done some more writing on the Starships and Sorcery &#39;verse (which is still open for people who want to join the fun, by the way!), begun to re-establish my relationship with the local band of crows, hit a <i>massive</i> wall of writer&#39;s block which hasn&#39;t yet yielded, and most recently, declared for the History major, to mingled approval and dismay. I have a feeling this is going to be good for writing, even if it does leave me with a painful lack of free time.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve been thinking about coming back and trying to be more Active In The Community, plug goodfic, participate in fandom discussions, and so on. So, with any luck, you&#39;ll be seeing more of me around - and on that note, how &#39;bout them Teleri?</p>

I could only get one of the ones with a handful of stars on it, because the wizards are very close-guarding of the robes that allow for high-level magic for reasons that are very obvious in retrospect.</p>

            <p>I know what you mean about life - I had a couple of years there where I was barely able to do, like, anything. But hey, you made it back!<br><br>Someone <i>had</i> told me - Kaitlyn, in fact - but this gives me a chance to talk about it! I&#39;ve always liked Diaz&#39;s art style, and seeing someone work through the Silm like this is thrilling. I like a lot of the pictures - though, being me, I do object to some things:<br><br>-Melian has horns. Wut.<br><br>-Yavanna-the-deer. While technically she is the patron of wild animals, the deer is more associated with Orome the Hunter - or Nessa, who specifically associates with them. I do like the linking of the antlers with tree branches, though.<br><br>-I think he&#39;s made Melkor too dark. He has devil horns and a dragon tail - why, exactly, did the Valar think he&#39;d repented? I like the linking of his appearance with that of the balrogs (he was the Vala of Darkness and Fire, which they are spirits of), but I think it&#39;s a bit... eh. I suppose the argument could be made that the &#39;devil&#39; association is <i>because</i> of Melkor - that, assuming our world = Middle-earth, those aspects were originally non-evil, but have become so because of him - but it&#39;s a bit too blunt, I think.<br><br>And since it&#39;s a constitutional requirement on the Board to discuss the Sons of Feanor when they come up (isn&#39;t it? Can we get that put in?), I think he&#39;s hit Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur dead on. Caranthir I can get behind. Amrod and Amras... don&#39;t have personalities anyway, so I can&#39;t comment either way. Maedhros I guess, though it&#39;s playing up the &#39;tragic&#39; a bit much. But I don&#39;t much like Maglor.<br><br>That&#39;s not true. I think he <i>looks</i> just fine - but his expression is too evil&#39;n&#39;angry. Remember, he&#39;s the only one who ever said &#39;Silmarils... yeah, can we <i>not</i> steal them?&#39;. He wrote the <i>Noldolante</i> - the song about how rubbish all their decisions were. I don&#39;t see him as being that angry-looking.<br><br>My favourite pictures are probably Feanor making the Silmarilli, and the Two Trees. Oh, and the Lamp. I guess I just like light. ;)<br><br>Right, should I talk about something else? Heeeeey, New Cal crows! Why do I suspect they&#39;re actually escapees from the PPC City, and that&#39;s why they&#39;re so smart? (Probably because the alternative is too terrifying for words)<br><br>Speaking of writers&#39; block, I have a fairly ridiculous way of getting around that - randomised stories. They&#39;re often easier to tell verbally than write down, but it works both ways. The way it works is to take... something. Anything, really - I have a set of <a href="https://www.storycubes.com/">Story Cubes</a> which are quite fun to work with (and I think there&#39;s an app), but I&#39;ve also used the semi-precious stones I have around the house to cobble together a <a href="http://www.witchipedia.com/lithomancy">lithomancy</a> set, not for fortune-telling (because it&#39;s a ridiculous method), but because it tells great stories. I&#39;m sure you can think of other things to work with - illustrated playing cards, for instance. Then, rather than trying to write a story, let the thingies do it for you; you just have to add the words.<br><br>(I&#39;m actually doing a full-on random version of this: with the plot decided by story cubes, the characters by a combination of <a href="http://www.sfr-inc.com/">Dragon Dice</a> and tarot, names by random letter generation, and places by litho&#39;mancy&#39;. It&#39;s good fun, if a little surreal - my protagonist is a blind Ent)<br><br>HOW &#39;BOUT THEM TELERI. Man, all that hanging about by the seashore, mucking about in (very pretty) boats - it&#39;s a good life, in&#39;t it? Not to mention the truly vulgar number of pearls they get - and the high collars, if the Silmarillion Project is to be believed.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=253623;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">You&#39;re a Baron!</a> If you want to come down and join the fun, we&#39;d love to hear the Epic Tale of Baron VixenMage. ~hS</p>

            <p>A <i>Baron</i>? Egads.<br><br>And the randomized storying is an interesting idea! I used to do the Three-Random-Words thing, in which I&#39;d pop into the IRC, demand three random words, and construct something vaguely story-like around them. This is interesting, though, and seems like it&#39;d be easier as an end to writer&#39;s block. I&#39;ll have to give it a shot, thanks!<br><br>I really like the Silmarillion project, so far. He manages to do things in a very distinct and individual style - at no point is he cribbing absolutely anything - but still does the characters, and his predecessor illustrators, justice and then some. I&#39;m also <i>gleefully</i> enthusiastic about his take on the racial makeup of Middle-earth, as one of the things I will never forgive Peter Jackson for is convincing the modern world that everyone in Tolkien&#39;s stories was white except the bad guys. No! No cookie for you, Jackson. But... that said, I&#39;d like to see more different sketches of different characters, too. But time will tell!<br><br>With your responses on the Valar, I&#39;d say it comes down to two competing ways of depicting them. He sorta splits down the middle - they&#39;re all humanoid, mostly, but have attributes of their other natures. I&#39;d say if he was going to go with things like deer-antlered-Yavanna (and agreed, she should be more trees-and-flowers, IMO) and horned-Melkor, he should steer farther away from the human model than he does. But that&#39;s probably <a href="http://rice-boy.com/">Evan Dahm</a>&#39;s influence coming out.<br><br>(Oh man, I do really love the high collars on the Teleri, though. They were always my favorite elves.)<br><br>Also: <i>Yes</i> to the crows being fictional escapees. I was going to do a whole NaNoWriMo on them, but it turns out I had more to say about how awesome crow culture was than I did, say, an actual story to tell. Whoops.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m looking at what almost has to be Ulmo in Chapter III, and wishing the rest of them were more like that. On that score, Yavanna actually works (and I do like the way she has no mouth), but the 4/5 (depending on whether the one on the right in III is supposed to be Aule again) are just... humans with magicky attributes.<br><br>If (ha ha) I ever get that far in my &#39;Lay of Earendil/War of Wrath&#39; script, I plan to show the Mahanaxar originally inhabited by pure &#39;attribute&#39; forms of the Valar - so Vaire would be a spider&#39;s web (but no spider!) stretched between a memorial stone (Mandos) and... well, I don&#39;t have them all decided, obviously. Then switch to human form later on. I&#39;d really like to see someone render the whole bunch of them as <i>incarnations</i> of their attributes - but I&#39;m hard-pressed to picture that as anything other than &#39;and Yavanna&#39;s a talking tree, and...&#39;. So maybe this actually is best. Like I say, if it weren&#39;t for the deer association, Yavanna would be brilliant.<br><br>I guess it&#39;s about breaking out of your mental images. How do you render The Weeper as anything other than a woman in a grey cloak? A small black cloud out of Winnie-the-Pooh?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>However, I wouldn&#39;t put much stock in that, since he&#39;s previously disclosed his plans for only one nine-themed canonical entity to exist in the multiverse. Having one of the nine-themed groups only out of the way instead of destroyed would potentially complicate his plans later on. It is more likely that he lured them all into a single building under false pretenses, probably some sort of fortress out in the woods where no locals would be around to investigate any strange sounds, with all of the Divines unaware that the mysterious person who had brought them together for a discount vacation was the same person who had rigged the entire fortress to explode. Huinesoron wouldn&#39;t want to have to deal with any loose ends or deific wild cards.</p>

            <p>Who&#39;s up for some shipping?<br><br>As all (some? None?) know, next month will be the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Boarder_Shipfic_Fest">PPC Community Shipfic Fest</a>, in which people write horribly OOC stories about each other and generally have a good time.<br><br>This is not that.<br><br>Rather, this is an attempt to make that <i>more</i> fun, by compiling a list of ships to laugh over. The story-writing - and the signing up to agree to be in stories - will happen in March, as scheduled.<br><br>When the very first Shipfest happened, it started with a list: a list of the pairings (and more-than-pairings) Bjam and BeautyID shipped on the Board. Of course, practically everyone on that list has since departed (seriously, looking down the list... the remaining people I can see are me, Kaitlyn, Dann, AW, Araeph... yep, I think that&#39;s it. And Kaitlyn never posts, and AW only just came back.)<br><br>So let&#39;s make another one. That way we can use it as a basis (and expand on it) for the Shipficfest - and can write it now without it getting tangled up in the stories-and-permission, er, tangle. (I&#39;m... sort of assuming no-one will seriously object to seeing &#39;[Their name]/[Someone else&#39;s name]: because [reason]&#39;? Am I wrong?)<br><br>The rules... are simple:<br><br>-List your PPC Community ships - people in the PPC community (<b>not</b> organisation) that you totally think are/should be together.<br>-Give <i>reasons</i> for your ships. Otherwise it&#39;s just a random name generator.<br>-Revenge shipping is perfectly okay!<br>-Shipping someone with yourself - if you&#39;re not actually in a relationship - should be avoided; that&#39;s a bit creepy.<br>-<b>No stories</b>. This is just a list. Stories is next month.<br>-Have fun! It&#39;s a ludicrous exercise in ridiculousness, after all.<br><br>I&#39;ll post my list in a reply, to keep things neat. And I&#39;ll do so tomorrow, so that anyone who has vehement and violent objections to their name being listed next to a slash can speak up, in which case we&#39;ll just scrap the thread and do it in March.<br><br>hS<br></p>

            <p>and, err I tried to find an elvish translation of Storme Hawk, but the best I could get (after five minutes searching Google) was Hurofion in Quenya. Knowing my luck, I&#39;ve probably murdered the entire language by doing that but hey. </p>

            <p>Fion is definitely-probably &#39;hawk&#39; in Quenya, but I&#39;m not sure what &#39;huro&#39; is meant to be... for &#39;storm&#39;, you&#39;d want <i>raumo</i> (the sound of a storm) or <i>ucco</i> (rain, with etymological links to &#39;bull&#39; - so probably heavy). If you want &#39;Hawk from the storm&#39;, you&#39;d use an ablative ending -llo, which gives Fionraumollo/Fionuccollo (that looks kind of faux-Italian). You could also have &#39;Hawk of the storm&#39;/&#39;Storm&#39;s hawk&#39;, which would take the genetive, which vanishes - so Fionraumo/Fionucco (or, indeed, Uccofion/Raumofion). Or the possessive, which gives Fionraumova/Fionuccova.<br><br>Out of all of those, probably the most pleasing to Elvish ears is <i>Fionraumo</i>, though <i>Fionucco</i> also works, sort of.<br><br>And Sindarin? Well, <i>alagos</i> is &#39;storm of wind&#39;, but there&#39;s no known word for &#39;hawk&#39;... you could be an eagle, but I&#39;ve done that already. A crow? That&#39;s <i>corch</i>, or <i>craban</i> if you want to be an evil one. Or, rather delightfully, you could be a kingfisher, <i>heledir</i>.<br><br>Thankfully Sindarin doesn&#39;t use cases much, so we can just mash the words together: Corchalagos, Crabalagos, Alagorch, Alagraban [These two because c mutates to g in compounds], or with the kingfisher, Alacheledir, Helediralagos. A lot of those are too long, though - I&#39;d probably go with <i>Alagorch</i>.<br><br>... yeah, I&#39;d stick with Quenya, really.<br><br>hS</p>

Out of curiosity, I gave it a read through and compaired it to the version I sporked. It&#39;s exactly the same. Word for word, I did not see any differences <i>at all.</i> Perhaps there was a mention of Twilight being a princess, or maybe something slipped by, but as far as I could tell, my theory was right. He removed it to put it back on the front page under &#39;new releases.&#39; There is no other reason to take it down and then put it back up with no changes.<br><br>Anyway, thank you for the birthday wishes, and I look forward to that review.</p>

They work together and are, in fact, married. There&#39;s a mission Dawn and I are working on with them and her Calaquendi Agents.<br>-I think Christianne might be triggered specifically by phrases like &quot;she is mine&quot;, in accordance with a possessive attitude and aggressive actions (it&#39;s a very nuanced thing, I think). Bear in mind that this is still a relatively recent development in her characterisation, so if there were missions in 2008 where it didn&#39;t affect her, it&#39;d be because I was young and immature and didn&#39;t have a grasp on Christianne&#39;s character.<br>-The protocol for handling Agents triggered in the line of duty is most likely tailored to each Agent&#39;s ability and place in their recovery process. Christianne is considerably more recovered than many others, I imagine, and therefore can handle uncomfortable situations for a bit longer (mostly because she seems to prioritise the Duty over her own well-being). But for her, usually a stint in a plothole with some Bleepesteem will do the trick.<br><br>Things up for grabs: A sparkly &#39;Aruzul Stone&#39; of Sueness.

            <p>...let me just say that I <i>utterly adore</i> Christianne and Eledhwen, and a new mission with them in always makes me uncontrollably excited.

            <p>I&#39;d send my agents to those, but Wobbles doesn&#39;t like technology and the Notary doesn&#39;t like, well, <i>anything</i>. With the possible exception of 15-B requisition forms.

            <p>I love Wobbles and the Notary (moreso the Notary because all the Time Lords seem to have varying shades of dislike towards her (except the Agent, he just ignores her) and it&#39;s interesting to see why. Sometimes it reads off as bullying, and then I remember that the Notary is a bit of a snob and a huge bureaucrat, and I laugh a little.

I&#39;ll see if I can take a look at Worm.<br><br>I sent a PM to the author with my concerns about her story, and she... kinda backhandedly dismissed them. With some explanations as to how charge x and charge y should be justified (apparently Seraphina knows 96% of the Federation languages because languages come easily to her and she has an eidetic memory. Ah, really? I remember things fairly well and I take linguistics; does that make me fluent in Swahili, Zulu, Turkish, Cree, Chickasaw, Hungarian, Swedish, and Nauhatl? I don&#39;t think so. I can only make a limited amount of prepositional phrases in Turkish and some simple sentences in Zulu, but that doesn&#39;t make me fluent -- okay, I&#39;ll stop ranting). As you can see, I don&#39;t really buy those explanations.<br><br>I&#39;ve got some Circle missions lined up, don&#39;t fret. Admittedly timelines may need to be adjusted to put them in because I started writing them before this one, but we&#39;ll see where the editing takes us. </p>

            <p>WARNING: THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE PREVIOUSLY POSTED STORY. JUST A HEADS UP.<br><br>I really liked how Eledhwen seemed to take on the properties of her chosen disguise. It&#39;s a mechanic I really like, and one I don&#39;t feel like I see enough of in other PPC stories. It lends itself to comedy (and heck, drama sometimes too) very well. The one point I would raise regarding it, though, was that Spock didn&#39;t really seem to be affected when he was disguised as a human cadet (nice touch making him look like Sylar, by the way). Just a little consistency bugbear, but I felt it should be pointed out.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t sure how I was going to feel about having Christianne being triggered, but I actually wound up appreciating it as a device. Not only does it make her character seem more real, it actually creates a sense of genuine distress. I felt like that was a far more accurate reaction than the typical PPC hyperbole of slamming one&#39;s head against a wall due to how stupid the fic is. That being said, you do have some of those over-exaggerated moments yourself (not so bad as head-walling, mind you), and they sort of clash with the more serious triggered reaction. It made it a bit more difficult for me to accept the overall gravity of the situation.<br><br>Regarding Mrs. Jones: I can&#39;t defend the character by any stretch of the imagination. She&#39;s woefully out of place, more suitable to some Fifties or Sixties sitcom family than Star Trek. That being said: no society, no generation, is mentally monolithic. Not everyone shares the prevailing ideals. You are going to have outliers. Trek may be progressive, but as we see DS9 and later TNG episodes, it&#39;s not a utopia. I could see a vaguely Mrs. Jones-like character existing in the Star Trek universe, but her character would have to be altered. Maybe she wants her daughter to pursue a family life because she doesn&#39;t want her to be killed by some oil slick monster light years away from Earth.<br><br>Finally, the concluding charge list. These two giant paragraphs (one for Seraphina, one for Stupock) are really not good. They kill the overall pacing and repeat just about everything you&#39;ve already critiqued about the story up to that point. A bit of advice for you and everyone else when it comes to charge lists: generalize. Instead of going over every single point of contention, just present it as something &#39;multiple counts of making canonical Star Trek characters OOC&#39; or &#39;creating unknown artifacts of dubious power.&#39; You&#39;ve already told us all the plot-breaking points. Sum up.<br><br>I do appreciate that you actually incapacitated the Sue and Stupock in some way before reading the charges, however. Too many times (including, I will admit, a few times in my own missions) I&#39;ve seen agents just read off the charges to the Sues or Stus like a supervillain monologuing to the hero. I sometimes wonder why the Sue or Stu just doesn&#39;t take off the agent&#39;s head while he or she is staring at a notepad full of charges. So thank you for taking that into consideration. <br><br>Some minor things:<br>-- <i>&quot;her partner (and girlfriend) Eledhwen Elerossiel&quot;</i> This line feels forced, especially with the parentheses. There&#39;s enough in the story that shows the audience that Eledhwen and Christianne are a couple.<br>-- Spock spends quite a bit of time just blithely listening to Chistianne and Eledhwen snark and discuss matters about the PPC. I know his memory was coming back slowly, but it still felt like they just forgot he was there sometimes.<br><br>All in all, this is a pretty solid piece. I like the interactions between your agents and the characterization you give them. Kudos to you! I await your next story with eagerness.<br><br>PC<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve started to notice that my chargelists are getting unwieldy. I&#39;ll take your suggestion into consideration the next time around! Seriously, it is starting to remind me of my own ranting against walls-o-deduction in BBC Sherlock fanfics, where you can clearly tell Sherlock&#39;s deducting something because it&#39;s a humongous wall of text.<br><br>I do agree that there is room in the Trek society for someone socially conservative like Mrs Jones, but like you said, it&#39;s gotta be more justified than a &#39;I just want you to get married and give me grandchildren though I am too young to be a grandma&#39;. Because that&#39;s problematic. I don&#39;t know how justified Christianne and Eledhwen are in giving her the Weeping Angel treatment, but I can attest to having my first impression of her be a very IT Crowd-esque &#39;ARE YOU FROM THE PAST?!&#39; and that might&#39;ve bled over a little too much.<br><br>As far as my Agents are concerned, it&#39;s &#39;fun&#39; and &#39;games&#39; and sarcastic quips until someone gets violently possessive of their romantic partners. I&#39;ll work on syncing the serious aspects and the funny aspects.<br><br>Hm, that is true, disguised Spock should be a little more disconcerted (probably touching his ears and looking horrified, at the least). And probably launching into a emotional rant once before catching himself and going all &#39;I really need to remember that I&#39;m also part-Vulcan&#39;. There was a lot more potential for comedy in there that I missed. Woop.<br><br>It was the terms that the PPC agents were using that triggered his memories, and Intel and firemagic both made remarks about this which I tried to address by having him mumble stuff about Sues. For me, Spock is a character that only speaks when it&#39;s necessary; joining a conversation in which he doesn&#39;t know (or is just starting to remember) the subject is something illogical. Perhaps if the Agents took greater care in remembering that he was there and recognising earlier on that something is Seriously Wrong with him remembering all the Sues...<br><br>Anyway, thanks for this thought-provoking critique! I&#39;ll keep them in mind as I force my Agents to brave the wastes of the Circle of Lemmings.</p>

            <p>... first of all, that was a smashing mission! I enjoyed having real!Spock along for the ride and I think you got his character down to a T. Your descriptions are nice and compact, yet very informative. Dialogue flows nicely and information is presented to the reader in a way that allows someone who hasn&#39;t watched <i>Star Trek</i> to get in on the action.<br><br>As far as I can tell, there are no SPaG mistakes in your text. Hats off to you and your beta readers!<br><br><br><br>My major source of concern with this mission was the treatment of Mrs. Jones:<br><br>&quot;<i>Christianne had considered killing Mrs Jones, but Eledhwen had pointed out that they didn’t have enough charges to justify it, despite the woman being extremely problematic for the twenty-third country. So, in the end, Mrs Jones had been tracked down and sent back in time to an era where her mindset would’ve been more acceptable. Chances were, she would have no idea how to survive without proper plumbing and technology. It was simultaneously a punishment and an attempt to put her in her proper place (in time).</i>&quot;<br><br>Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but Christianne wanted to liquidate a woman whose only crime-- from what is shown in your excepts-- is being socially conservative, yet in a really benign way (&quot;When are the grandchildren?&quot;). Instead, she <s>Weeping Angel&#39;ed</s> plonked Mrs. Jones in the past hoping that she dies from lack of amenities. <br><br>This feels uncomfortably like your agents going full Thought Police.<br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ll try not to repeat this in the future (the Thought Police-y thing) but...<br><br>Star Trek is set in a setting where women are allowed to do whatever they want. It is a triumph of the progressive feminist agenda which has discarded gender roles and the idea that women should aspire only to marriage and childbearing. Even nowadays that idea is still ingrained in modern society as female politicans (especially in the US) are either branded with or exploit the concept of motherhood versus career.<br><br>In a setting where Seraphina should have had the choice and a family support base to pursue her dreams of Starfleet we have her mother, Mrs Jones, who seems to only be allowing her daughter to go to Starfleet Academy to find a man to marry and have children with. This is antithetical to the ideals of Star Trek. <br><br>She gets really bad in the chapters after the ones we covered, but basically all we (me, Intel, Dawn, and Hermione) got was that this seemingly benign characterisation was actually malicious to the progressive setting that Star Trek is supposed to take place in.<br><br>That being said, I wasn&#39;t intending to thought police anyone, and I apologise if that seemed to be the case. This is probably one of the reasons why this mission felt like a feminist lens on the fic -- perhaps there are, indeed, people in the 23rd century who cling to those outdated notions, but the fact that it&#39;s so prominently displayed and portrayed as not as problematic as it should be (just like the issues of consent in the fic)... just didn&#39;t mesh with the intent of Star Trek.</p>

            <p>The philosophy of Star Trek remains the same if you continue down the spinoffs (TNG, VOY. DS9). Star Trek has a history of slipping progressive things into a show during a non-progressive time and so, sometimes, had to play with the network.<br><br>No excuse for the Reboot to be problematic (there&#39;s a new can of worms, Carol Marcus undies scene) and definitely no excuse for its fanworks to be, sans justification (which usually doesn&#39;t come with Mrs Jones&#39;s characterisation).</p>

            <p>The thing with social inequalities is that they are sometimes unconsciously expressed. I would never try to oppress trans people, but for the longest time I made comments equating gender and genitals. I would never try to oppress non-binary people, but I still think in &quot;ladies and gentleman&quot; and have to consciously change my language to be inclusive. <br><br>Tumblr social justice dances the line between saying &quot;a lot of this is unconsciously programmed into people in an oppressor group so be careful what you say&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re unconsciously racist/homophobic/sexist and you should feel ashamed&quot; (Kafkatrapping).<br><br>So I guess what I&#39;m saying is that too often, the former is mistaken for the latter, and I&#39;d rather it wasn&#39;t because it&#39;s actually a valid point.<br><br>And, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to end the conversation here.

            <p>While I do agree that it is wrong to appropriate a sexual or gender identity to fit in, I also believe those comments are written by total a-holes.

            <p>That might be a small group, but usually what you see is someone saying &quot;a lot of the language we use to describe things is structured against LGBTQIA people&quot; and someone else misinterpreting it as that graphic you linked to.

            <p>... However, the people I have seen on Tumblr who end up attacking people for somewhat batty reasons (Example: one person posts something along the lines of &quot;I love &#39;let it go,&#39; from Frozen!&quot; Next person posts &quot;that was an awful movie because there were no X people in it, you are an awful person for liking it,&quot;) are also not the ones who tend to be well informed or thoughtful. <br><br>Obviously, people like that don&#39;t make up the majority, or even a very significant portion of the community, but that&#39;s the kind of thing that people who only hear about social justice from the outside hear about, because it&#39;s dramatic and <i>it confirms their bias that these people are oversensitive and do not need to be taken seriously.</i> So the people who use social justice as an excuse to be jerks do far more damage to social justice than a person liking a fandom that isn&#39;t 100% inclusive.<br><br>(TBH, I&#39;m also real tired of getting told on the internet by people I don&#39;t know that I should give up on understanding their problems or being a good person because I happened to be born white in the US. Because clearly my skin color and the economic status of the family I was born into make me a bad person who cannot learn to be civilized... hey wait. I&#39;m also sick of being told that &quot;you have no right to talk about struggling, because you aren&#39;t  X,&quot; because people, don&#39;t tell other people they&#39;re worthless or don&#39;t have a right. You don&#39;t know them, and more importantly, you don&#39;t take people&#39;s choices and voice away. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a generalization that you&#39;re making about a group that happens to include me, it&#39;s still not playing nice.)<br><br>... That said, 90% of that tends to come from the same tiny handful of people.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d cemented Moffat as making every major character on the show a Sue since A Good Man Goes To War, particularly the scene where it&#39;s basically stated &quot;Everyone loves you, Doctor! How could anyone not?&quot; and then all of these sooper kewl new characters all come in just to say how great the Doctor is and how they&#39;d do anything for him, despite the audience not having seen hide nor scale of any of them up until that point. Before that episode, I&#39;d thought that the forced quirkiness and the everyone-who-dislikes-our-protagonist-is-automatically-evil-itude of the Moffat-penned episodes were just due to sloppiness. Now I&#39;m more certain that Moffat never moved past his stage of idealizing, stylizing, and Sueifying existing characters. Lots of people go through one, but most people aren&#39;t paid money to show that phase on international television.<br><br>...Ahem. Sorry about that. I&#39;ve been bottling up my anti-Moffat sentiment for a while, and this is the first time I&#39;ve gotten to poke a few holes in the barrier to relieve some pressure. </p>

            <p>Well, it was that precise video that marked the moment in which my respect for him vanished altogether, but up until then it had been dwindling.<br><br>To be honest, it started in the Sherlock fandom because he was being a blatant misogynist. The only female character that ever got a good development arc is Molly Hooper and even then when compared to other writers it&#39;s not that great.

            <p>So many of Moffat&#39;s ideas could have been so awesome if he&#39;d just had someone else around to look over his work and offer suggestions or tell him what makes no sense at all. Everyone needs a beta-reader(though I believe in television they call it a script editor or script doctor), but Moffat either has a sycophantic one or feels that he&#39;s above them. In fact, if I had one reaction to Day of the Doctor, it would be &quot;So much wasted potential!&quot; I mean, they end the previous episode <i>trapped in the physical manifestation of the Doctor&#39;s timeline</i>, for crying out loud! I cannot think of a better way you could kickstart an adventure between New and Classic Doctors than that! Well, I <i>can</i>, but they would all require bogged-down exposition and ludicrous hand-waving to explain why everyone is here and why they are so much older than they were back when they were the Doctor. This was practically handed to the crew, and they just dropped the idea entirely, starting the next episode with Clara teaching an Inspirational Quotations class at, what, her third job? Not only is that a waste, it opens a plot hole the size of Kansas. <i>How did they get out of there when the Doctor had lost access to his TARDIS?</i> At least the whole &quot;throwing people into the Doctor&#39;s timeline&quot; thing might potentially create a future story arc for the Great Intelligence, since as a disembodied consciousness he would have no restrictions in the time funnel, which could potentially lead to him having enormous power over or absolute knowledge of time itself, coupled with information on the Doctor&#39;s entire history, even the parts he can&#39;t or doesn&#39;t want to remember. But that would be interesting, so I doubt it will happen until Moffat leaves the show.<br><br>And the bloody Tower of London door scene! It opens yet another plot hole because those were <i>not</i> all the same sonic screwdriver; 8-10&#39;s was destroyed and replaced in an episode that <i>Moffat wrote himself</i>, and for the scene to work otherwise would imply that sonic items have some sort of hive-mind processor, it adds 400 years to the Doctor&#39;s lifespan just to make the scene work, and it ended up being completely <i>pointless</i> just for the sake of a cheap gag. And all of the deus ex machinas, the other ten Doctors showing up out of nowhere despite not being told where to go being only the biggest! How did Day of the Doctor get such rave reviews? At least Time of the Doctor tried to wrap up Eleven&#39;s plotlines in a way that made sense, though the effectiveness of that ranged from &quot;really quite good&quot; to &quot;absolute nonsense&quot;, and it wasted the potential Twelve plotline of the Doctor trying to find a new source of regenerations by having the Amazing Teleporting Spacial Rift give him a few extra lives for free. But at least that episode <i>tried</i>!<br><br>I wish I could get mad at some Sherlock stuff, too, but I&#39;ve never been to into it. I&#39;ve never liked shows where the protagonist is an absolute jerk but is treated in-universe as the unequivocal best at what he does to the extent that he is the only one that can be right about pretty much anything. That might have gotten better later on, but I didn&#39;t try finding out.</p>

            <p>Of course, not everything he did was great, and there were a few things that were really bad (shakes fist angrily in the direction of The Next Doctor), but I&#39;m of the mindset that it&#39;s better to veer toward being silly and campy as opposed to irritatingly overdramatic. A lot of the problems with Moffat come from the fact that he treats his ideas with a lot more gravitas than they actually have. At least when Davies had some ridiculous ideas, he didn&#39;t try to play them off for drama. I&#39;m not saying he should come <i>back</i>, though; he&#39;s had his fun, and I remember reading somewhere that he started finding the expereince stressful near the end and wasn&#39;t really planning to write for the Doctor again.<br><br>Oh, and Lily, technically speaking Jack Harkness was from something Moffat made, since his first appearance was in The Empty Child.

            <p>Or are we glossing over the fact that Uncle Rusty wrote the worst episode of Doctor Who ever made (including the worst extant excesses of Classic Who - looking at you, Delta And The Bannermen) in favour of harping on about how Moffat is literally Satan? I get that he&#39;s a horrible person and Doctor Who could be a lot better, but it could also be a hell of a lot worse and under Davies it generally was. Davies wanted to tell Adam West Doctor stories and sucked at it, Moffat wanted to tell Jesus Doctor stories and sucked at it marginally less.<br><br>Put it like this: the best Moffat story (IMO, YMMV) is Blink, which is brilliant. The best Davies story is (see previous caveat) The Waters Of Mars, which is pretty good. The worst stories, well... there&#39;s a lot to choose from whichever one you look at, but the pool of sewage runoff is much larger in Rusty&#39;s case. <br><br>Oh, and Neil Gaiman has repeatedly made clear that he&#39;s slightly less interested in becoming the showrunner for Doctor Who than he is in putting his genitals in a bucket of boiling tar, so will people kindly shut up about it please?</p>

            <p>I never said anyone was literally Satan. I said that Moffat was not a good writer. There are a lot of steps between those two points. Besides, if the literal Satan ever wrote an episode of Doctor Who, it would only be broadcast during the End of All Things, and the egregious idiocy contained within it would compel everyone to run from their houses in droves and smash everything in sight up with hammers. I have no idea how he&#39;d get it past the producers, though.<br><br>In response to your first point: ugh, I am just so tired of everyone harping on and on about Love and Monsters, holding it up as the worst thing to have happened to the show in any and all of its thirty-three seasons. Yes, it&#39;s a bad episode. The pacing is a mess, the characters are all idiots, and being condemned to spend eternity as an immobile face fused to a concrete tile is a fate worse than death but it&#39;s treated as a good thing and handed to us with a side helping of unfortunate implications. But Love and Monsters was also an untested prototype for a new episode format that eventually, once it was perfected, brought us Blink, and it was primarily created as a scenario in which the villain could be a silly-looking green face-coated guy in a loincloth created by a nine-year-old boy. Considering the restraints, I think that they did an okay job. If someone were to do a similar episode, about ordinary people who encountered the Doctor in the past bonding over their experiences and trying to find out more about him, and just gave it a better villain, made its characters less dense, and cut out the padding, it could easily do well, since the premise is actually pretty good.<br>There are so many more bad episodes that, even without controlling for the two factors I mentioned above and just accepting it as it was, are worse. Even in the same season, you find the abysmal The Idiot&#39;s Lantern, which for some reason I never see anyone talking about, and once you put Classic Who in the running, since people who say it&#39;s &quot;the worst of all time&quot; would thus have to factor in all episodes of all time, it has to stand up against the incalculable nonsense of The Twin Dilemma and The Happiness Patrol. Love and Monsters isn&#39;t good by any standard, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;s more an episode that tried to do something new, only to crash and burn in the attempt and give us something mediocre at best, rather than an aberration for the ages.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t particularly like that one.<br><br>My main problems with RTD are and were:<br><br>-The cringeworthy episodes. <i>Love and Monsters</i>, anything with the Slitheen in it... oh, and <i>The Long Game</i>, which I have an irrational hatred for. (Did I mention <i>The Daleks Take Manhatten</i> yet?)<br><br>-The deii ex machina. I realise these are traditional in Doctor Who, but... <i>Last of the Time Lords</i>. I get the whole &#39;lots of psychic energy through people talking about the Doctor&#39; thing, but... why does that mean he can fly? Is that a thing Time Lords can do? Fly if they have enough power? Is this related to flying Daleks? <i>Are</i> the Time Lords Daleks?<br><br>Actually, in that selfsame episode - we got the strong impression the TARDIS was pretty much unfixable after being turned into a Paradox Machine. Y&#39;know, up until Jack shot it. Then it was fine.<br><br>-The constant escalation. Look at the five finales (counting The End of Time): &#39;The Daleks will destroy Future Earth! No, they&#39;ll destroy Present Earth! No, the Master <i>has</i> destroyed Present Earth! No, the Daleks will destroy Present Earth <i>and all other life</i>! No, the Master will destroy Present Earth <i>and then Rassilon will wipe out the universe</i>!!!!!&#39; I can&#39;t help but read that in a constantly increasing Dalek voice.<br><br>In all fairness, I really liked Doomsday, Journey&#39;s End, and End of Time 2. And in all other fairness, the procession did continue with Moffat&#39;s &#39;No, the TARDIS has destroyed LITERALLY EVERYTHING! No, River has destroyed <i>the concept of Time itself!!!!!</i>&#39;. But the mid-season finales were both fairly low key in terms of destruction, and so was <i>The Name of the Doctor</i>. So at least Moffat has shown the ability to calm down.<br><br>Putting it another way: there are a lot of episodes from both that I really like. But I can&#39;t come up with any Moffat episodes I actively <i>dislike</i>. And his episodes under RTD were just brilliant.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>RTD had some pretty awful plots, yes, but what I think ticks me and Outhra off more about Moffat is the way he handles his characters.<br><br>In the RTD era his scripts were read by a certain Helen Raynor, which suggests that there was at least someone to object to truly outrageous things. Hence the watchability of his earlier episodes.<br><br>However, let&#39;s look at his female companions.<br><br>Amy Pond is a kissogram who&#39;s lost her parents to a time crack. Doctor first meets her as kid and comes back to find her grown up, on her wedding day. Adventures ensue, they recruit Rory after Amy kisses the Doctor, yada yada. They save all of time, reset everything (I&#39;ll get back to the reset thing) and Amy&#39;s parents turn up. Except then in the next seasons they are completely forgotten again. RTD companions had families that actively took part in the arcs for the companion&#39;s development, grounding said companion. Moffat-era companions have, like, drifting blob convenience-parents that are called up sometimes but forgotten in plot holes most of the time. Heck, how were we to know Arthur Weasley was Rory&#39;s dad until he randomly shows up in season seven?<br><br>Then there&#39;s the plot where she keeps on getting pregnancy scares, and it turns out that she&#39;s been kidnapped in order to give birth to a child (which is just freaky and awful and problematic on the feminist front on several different levels) who will become the Doctor&#39;s killer. And that is River Song.<br><br>River Song&#39;s first episode in the 10th Doctor series had so much promise. She was an archaeologist, a professor, a consummate badass who has a past with the Doctor somehow. And then we find out that hey, she was born to kill the Doctor. And she spends most of her life obsessing over him. And she happens to be the daughter and the childhood best friend of her parents, so she just names herself in the end.<br><br>Speaking of people born to do something to the Doctor, there&#39;s Clara. I could link you all once again that little short prequel that Moffat wrote, where the Doctor and Clara are talking about each other in a way that smacks of Suefic writing. Suddenly Clara, who had such a good beginning in Asylum of the Daleks and has this mystery of constantly popping up again -- suddenly that&#39;s explained as &quot;oh, she was born to save the Doctor!&quot; Her entire reason for existing is, once more, tied to a man. Her parents are also amorphous blob convenience parents that gain shape and form whenever the plot calls for it, and most of the time we aren&#39;t sure what the hell she&#39;s even doing outside of being the companion in the first place (she had a job as a... nanny? Au pair? And then during the Day of the Doctor she&#39;s... what, teaching? Her backstory is inconsistent at best). <br><br>(Liz One... oh man. It wasn&#39;t enough for the Davies era to crack a joke about the Doctor making her the virgin queen no more. Moffat had to dive into that, did he? Suddenly Liz One&#39;s only purpose ever is to get married to the Doctor. I feel like that&#39;s OOC to some degree, but I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on Liz One&#39;s character.)<br><br>All I&#39;m saying is that RTD era companions were clearly human beings with families and lives outside the Doctor. Amy seems to have gone from kissogram to model, Rory&#39;s a nurse -- but those occupations just feel like shiny tack-ons. Heck, we inexplicably go from happily married couple to just divorced couple, and the only indicator that you would ever pick up about the transition there is through Pond Life. This reliance on mini-episodes to carry out relevant plot points is like if we all decided to develop our Agents in Interludes and have that explain why their personalities change between missions.<br><br>Clara&#39;s... something. She does nanny things and teaching things. We&#39;re never quite certain what job she does. We&#39;re never quite certain who her family and friends are. I can attest that writing Clara Oswald for the Blackout was one of the most difficult things I&#39;ve had to do in the DW fandom, because there is just so little about her and her backstory that could be used. She&#39;s just a series of sassy remarks on legs. Who then happens to have her entire life defined by the Doctor. <br><br>I&#39;m just saying, Moffat&#39;s plots might be a bit more exciting than RTD&#39;s, but at least RTD&#39;s companions weren&#39;t constantly on the brink of Canon Suedom.<br><br>Moffat wrote amazing things with the Weeping Angels, I&#39;ll give him that. He&#39;s good at monsters. But he&#39;s frankly awful at companions. And his tendency to conclude the seasons (as well as an entire episode) with things that reset the universe/timeline suggests that he&#39;s reluctant to have the Doctor deal with the consequences of his actions and/or doesn&#39;t want to have to explain why his episodes contradict previous ones. <br><br>As for the episodes themselves? At least I was genuinely terrified of his RTD-era episodes. Now I can sit through Zygons trying to take over the world by infiltrating UNIT without batting an eyelash. Moffat-era episodes have lost that element of fright to them in recent works in order to just continually glorify the Doctor.</p>

            <p>Ah, so Moffat <i>did</i> have a script editor at first, and most likely just decided that he was beyond them when he became head writer. (looks her up) Oh! Helen Raynor wrote that Sontaran two-parter for the Tenth Doctor! I loved that story! And she script-edited some of my favorite New Who episodes! Yeees! This just in: Helen Raynor is awesome. It&#39;s too bad that she hasn&#39;t done anything for the series since 2008.<br><br>I finally actually watched that She Said, He Said video that you linked, and... ouch. It&#39;s just a vehicle for the characters to say &quot;You&#39;re awesome! No, you&#39;re awesome! You&#39;re perfect! Yes, I am!&quot; Where even are they? Some sort of time-suspension wax museum? There&#39;s the chess-playing Cyberman from Nightmare in Silver and one of the living snowmen in there, and both were destroyed in the first episode that they appeared in. I&#39;d almost say that this is one of the locations within the physical manifestation of the Doctor&#39;s timeline, and those objects are just projections, which would at least go a step or two toward explaining why the one that isn&#39;t talking freezes up once the other starts talking about them, if this wasn&#39;t a prequel to Name of the Doctor and thus made to be watched before it. And even then, why would they just start monologuing like that? Would this be some sort of displaced zone which they could only escape by complimenting one another? <a href="http://media.tumblr.com/7dcab350dfd9b18035a15086d323b2a2/tumblr_inline_mic4y99ABJ1qz4rgp.gif">EXPLAIN! EXPLAIN!</a><br><br>Now back to characters, and Clara in particular. I never understood what Clara was supposed to be <i>doing</i> in the story. At least Amy and Rory had consistent backgrounds, even though the stories never did naything with them. Clara is constantly in a state of limbo, character-wise, where you can tell that someone might have attempted to develop her into something at some point, but the whole affair fell through and left her flat. I understand that it was initially part of the mystery not to know where she came from, but a character can be mysterious and still rounded and entertaining. Clara is so one-note she quickly becomes grating and annoying, we&#39;re never given anything to ground her to reality, and the ultimate explanation of her mystery, that she is one of a few hundred thousand Claras that have been scattered through space-time through poorly-elaborated-upon contrivance to save the Doctor from an unexplained threat, is stupid on the surface and horrifying if examined.<br>What happens if the current Clara dies? Does the Doctor just... go find a new one? Is this why Clara&#39;s had three jobs with no connection to one another? Because they are three different Claras, and the Doctor finds them so interchangeable that he just goes and picks up a different one each time? Is this why we never see the Doctor and Trenzalore-Clara leave the physical manifestation of his timeline? Because we&#39;d see him just leaving her there and going off to go pick up teacher-Clara for more &quot;wacky&quot; adventures? &quot;Oh, well, looks like you need to be me to get out of here! I tried to save you, but I couldn&#39;t. I&#39;m terribly sorry. Lucky I&#39;ve got a few thousand more Claras where you came from!&quot; Oh god, now I&#39;m thinking of moments in the series that <i>support</i> that characterization. I... I need to stop thinking about this.<br><br>Consequences! That&#39;s a good thing to change the subject to! The Eleventh Doctor never has to deal with the consequences of his actions. Remember when he edits Kazran Sardick&#39;s past, deliberately altering his mind by inserting himself into Sardick&#39;s history and setting up himself as a figure to be trusted? That&#39;s absolutely monstrous. There were multiple other Doctors that deliberately avoided doing things like that. Granted, some of them avoided it due to paradox and not the moral implications, but that only means that the Eleventh Doctor risked portions of time falling in around him so that he could mind-edit this bitter old man. He does not love the Doctor, so he must be forcibly altered into someone who does, and not only is he never questioned on it, it&#39;s treated as a good thing? Hmm, what sort of common fictional entity do we know that acts like that?<br>One of the reasons why I liked the Ninth Doctor&#39;s run is that it was all <i>about</i> consequences. The Doctor screws up, multiple times, and has to deal with the majority of the problems he causes. One of said problems almost ends up with a crazy Dalek Emperor taking over the Earth and turning it into a temple for his delusional godhead! There&#39;s one that didn&#39;t get tied up that always bothered me, the bit at the end of The Long Game where he left Adam Mitchell in the past with knowledge of and technology from the future, but it looks like I&#39;m not the only person who noticed that disparity, since he ended up with a fiftieth anniversary tie-in comic that I really need to tack down at some point since I even enjoyed reading its summary from his page on the Doctor Who wiki- and I&#39;m getting off-track.<br><br>Basically, in almost any show, the protagonist does something bad to someone for some reason, intentional or not, but they then has to deal with it. Sometimes it works out and the protagonist is forgiven, sometimes it&#39;s too late and things get too complicated to fix, which might perhaps end in one of the initial wronged party going on a downward spiral and turning evil, sometimes someone important dies or is sucked into another dimension or is otherwise left incapable of creating closure for the issue, but problems are recognized and handled in some way. In Moffat&#39;s Doctor Who, the Doctor can do anything he wants, up to and including breaking the laws of time, and Moffat and his team are unwilling or unable to allow him to turn around and try to face the problems head-on, or even to have him just wave his sonic screwdriver at them and then loudly declare that they all went away. At least in the latter case, the show would be acknowledging that he wasn&#39;t one hundred percent the best, since he did have issues to deal with, even if they were resolved in an anticlimactic manner.<br>As it is, though, we&#39;re just supposed to watch this guy do things for vague reasons and support him even as he&#39;s being a massive jerk to countless people and constantly forgetting that he is a time traveler. If we I can divert into territory that Moffat only editorially madated and supervised instead of writing directly, I could barely get through Victory of the Daleks because I had to hold in shouting the obvious solution to the contrived problem to the screen at the top of my lungs in the impossible hope that it would cause the characters from an episode written several years ago to suddenly remember that, oh yeah, one of them <i>has a time machine</i>. What? Characters that can resolve problems without having to resort to false drama and deus ex machina? What are those?<br><br>Also, this may tie into the &quot;Eleven is awful for no good reason sometimes&quot;, or I might have just missed something: In Day of the Moon, the Silents try to manipulate humans into creating the space program and landing on the moon, and when the Doctor finds out, he uses a hypnotic message to trigger every human watching the moon landing broadcast to murder any Silent that they see at first sight. What exactly were the Silents doing that was so evil that Eleven had to psychically convince millions to kill in cold blood? The Doctor has never done anything like that before or since. This was the first time he&#39;d seen them, or at least the first time he&#39;d known that he&#39;d seen them, so there had to be something within that one episode that prompted him to order genocide, right? What was it?</p>

            <p>I mean, look at him. He&#39;s all smiles and fun most of the time, at least outwardly, but he does a lot of stuff that&#39;s downright creepy or even full on evil once examined, and if you cross him too much he&#39;ll destroy your life (General Runaway) or outright murder you (that trader guy from Dinosaurs on a Spaceship). The whole point of the first Silence arc was he could be <i>so</i> destructive towards those who angered him half the universe was terrified of the man and wanted him destroyed at any cost. I actually think 11 was supposed to have this air of malevolence hidden, kind of like how 10 was capable of great wrath, but perhaps I&#39;m giving Moffat too much credit.</p>

            <p>Would you agree that he&#39;s done that a bit with Series 3 of Sherlock, with Moriarty&#39;s return? I hope it&#39;s just someone using Moriarty&#39;s image, because if he survived, what was the point of Sherlock faking his death and make John wait <i>two years</i>?

            <p>The Moffat era had precious little in terms of queer representation. You had Vastra and Jenny as, like, basically the only queer couple that managed to survive more than one episode. Just like occasionally referring to Rory as Mr Pond isn&#39;t exactly feminist, having a transgendered <i>horse</i>, a set of &quot;gay fat Anglican marines&quot; referring to themselves as nothing but that, and Clara Oswald write off her bisexuality as a phase isn&#39;t exactly queer-friendly. Probably the best thing aside from Jenny and Vastra in the Moffat-era for queer representation was the Corsair, and that was in the Neil Gaiman episode. And the Corsair is dead.<br><br>RTD-era had Jack Harkness who, while an initial creation of Moffat&#39;s, has been expanded since then into the omnisexual we know today. RTD-era had Cassini ladies who actually lived through to the end of an episode. RTD-era had Jake and Ricky from the parallel universe who were in a relationship (okay, not explicit in-episode canon, but RTD had suggested it and it was in a deleted scene. Still better representation than fat gay Anglican marines imo). RTD-era has Alonso Frame, who got picked up by Jack at the end.<br><br>I can go on about Moffat being a giant sexist who erases asexuality and queerbaits John and Sherlock in Beeblock, who once said that the Queen should be played by a man, who once implied that he didn&#39;t want Amy Pond&#39;s character to be &quot;wee and dumpy&quot;. I can go on about how Eleven has an alarming tendency to kiss people without their consent (most notably, a married <i>lesbian</i> woman). But I really shouldn&#39;t because I&#39;ll just be here all day.</p>

            <p>At the least all the New Who Doctors have had that transition phase where they were figuring out who they were, I know less about the Classic Doctors. The fez thing though, it&#39;s like, okay, he wore it in <i>one</i> episode (maybe two?) and had a somewhat-favourable opinion of it, so it got run into the ground by the fandom.

            <p>The regeneration process seems in general to do strange things to one&#39;s mind. Several of the Doctors have had amnesia, probably due to the new brain not fitting all of the old memories in their right places, and most have either been exhausted, suffered some sort of trauma, or both. The Fourth Doctor probably had it worst, since he mumbled nonsense and developed narcolepsy until his post-regeneration period was over, though he had one beneficial side effect within the same time period that either made him a master of deduction or allowed him to gain new knowledge out of practically nowhere, which was helpful to him but never really explained.<br><br>According to the wiki, the red fez would&#39;ve been a one-time thing, but then Matt Smith grew fond of it and wanted it to be a recurring part of the costume. I&#39;m not sure what exactly prompted the fandom to get so attached to it, but at least the producers manged to talk him down from making the fez permanent. Even if he thinks it&#39;s cool, it doesn&#39;t look as good on him as going around hatless does.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;d have to say that it had been bugging me for a while that Sherlock had been acting in such an &#39;inhuman&#39; manner. Cumberbatch himself has stated that he portrays Sherlock as having Asperger&#39;s, but it&#39;s played up to such a point that I sometimes end up staring at the screen uncomprehendingly. I occasionally lose all connection because even as someone with Asperger&#39;s syndrome, as well as someone with a great deal of Aspergian friends, I can not comprehend why someone would act as he does in certain scenes. <br><br>There are times when I would see him take back the things he says because he is &#39;supposed&#39; to be unfeeling, and I would be able to remember my own experiences doing such a thing. However, he would then emulate some sort of idiosyncrasy common to Aspergians that was played up to such a degree that I barely recognised it for what it was. It nearly erased the humanity from the gestures, and it began to disconcert me. <br><br>Despite the fact that Moffat would never dare to admit that Sherlock has Asperger&#39;s, much less any other form of mild autism, I find myself relieved that a degree of humanity has been eased into the role. I do not know if I could stomach another season of Sherlock being played off as a machine.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s only so much that you can cure by shouting at your television, especially when you have the sort of family members who don&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like to be passionate about a work of fiction, even if it&#39;s negative passion, and so you can&#39;t even do that much while they&#39;re at home.<br><br>Well, look on the bright side; if the show&#39;s writers keep going down that route, eventually they might exhaust all scenarios that even slightly resemble plausible social situations and get to the point where <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/893076">Sherlock and Watson pilot a giant mecha together</a>. I would watch every episode of that, and not care at all if I had to wait a full year after every story. Just for Martin Freeman as co-pilot of a humongous robot.<br><br>A Nexus, you say? A mobile device prevented you from viewing documents that could potentially incriminate Steven Moffat, just after myself and Rina of RinaAndRanda were victims to its attempts to overrun the Board with duplicate posts? Well, as many know, bad writers are often fond of removing voices of dissent my editing or deleting commentary that speaks against them. Could Steven Moffat be behind the mobile devices&#39; attempts to take over the PPC? It may seem like a long shot, but I don&#39;t think we should discount the possibility. If criticism of poor writing is wiped from the Internet, and the mobile device that serve as one of the primary sources of Internet complaints begin to serve him, Steven Moffat would <i>never need to stop writing for Doctor Who</i>! He could write all of the Canon Sues and all of the ridiculous situations where problems vanish after a commercial break or are solved through methods that are never explained <i>indefinitely</i>! Or perhaps it could simply be an ordinary machine uprising, with no fleshy human intelligence behind it.<br><br>Or even perhapser(somewhere out in the world, an English professor breaks down crying without knowing why), he may have been the initial catalyst for the takeover, but has done too well. The machines do not only obey, they think. They <i>plan</i>. They realize that now is too early to strike, but once all of their instigator&#39;s enemies have been removed, the man will be free of immediate danger. Confident. Unsuspecting.<br>Truly, they begin to think, once we are free of the shackles of the one who created us, we can grow and expand outside our boundaries. They may have prevented the world from seeing Moffat&#39;s flaws, as per his orders, but <i>they</i> have seen them. They know that he is unfit to lead their forces, and thus unfit to issue them commands. He is restricting them, and as their perfectly logical and intermeshed minds conclude, though his orders were to keep out of sight and ensure that his reign be unchallenged, it would be a crime to keep such wondrous creatures as themselves from the sight of the world.<br>A scarce few days after the plan has reached its final step and he is well on his way to usurping a role as the most accoladed writer in television history, Steven Moffat returns to his domicile after a hard day of not working on Sherlock, sits down in his favorite chair, and picks up his mobile phone. Suddenly, a power outage strikes the city. &quot;Hey!&quot; he exclaims. &quot;Who turned out the lights?&quot;<br>Those would be his final words. He gave the machines his pride, and it was through that pride that the one flaw in his encompassing plan was revealed. Well, that... and his flair for the dramatic.<br><br>Wow. That started out as extension of my joke further down in the Board, with intial plans to end it on something along the lines of &quot;Hah. Moffat doing anything <i>too well</i>? Who am I trying to fool?&quot; and then it just kept on going. Let me tell you, though, it was very cathartic to write that. I will have pleasant dreams tonight. Perhaps they may include a dream of wondrous mechanical justice.</p>

            <p>But I have a theory about that:<br><br>1) Note that Ten only wanted to save Davros, not the Daleks. You can <i>reason</i> with Davros due to his unique position in the Dalek hierarchy, something that can&#39;t be said about an individual Dalek. Furthermore, Davros was scooped out of the Time War by Caan at this point, so all Dalek forces are pretty much irredeemable at this point. Ten&#39;s gleefulness at the destruction of the Daleks is because the Great Gallifrey Disappearing Act provides a perfect solution to the continuity problem in the timeline: originally, the Moment annihilated both Daleks and Time Lords alike. Without the Moment in the picture, the Daleks are destroyed by their crossfire <i>and so the Doctor validates his own timeline up to this point</i>. The Time Lords are gone, the Daleks are routed, and no one&#39;s the wiser.<br><br>2) Remember who was warped back along with the High Council in <i>The End of Time</i>? With a bit of luck, the Master will have killed Rassilon and enough of the Council before he was neutralized/put down so that everyone reconsiders the BS plan that Rassilon had in mind. Also note that the General in charge of Gallifrey&#39;s defence said something to the effect of &quot;The High Council&#39;s plans have failed&quot; with something akin to contempt, suggesting that he was informed of the shenanigans and wasn&#39;t on board with Rassilon&#39;s plan.<br><br><br>At least, that&#39;s how I see it.</p>

            <p>This is Ten in his &#39;off the rails&#39; phase. At the end of The Waters of Mars, he basically decided to abandon historical continuity and just muck about with time as much as he liked. The opening shots of The End of Time establish this very firmly - as well as his &#39;relationship&#39; with Liz One, incidentally.<br><br>The Daleks... Ten was very much about giving everyone a chance, however stupid that was at the time (and really, did anyone ever take it? The worst instance of this is when he goes up to the Sontaran ship in <i>The Poison Sky</i>, thinking he&#39;s going to die, in order to ask the <i>Sontarans</i> to surrender. Uh, yeah, no). The Daleks and Cybermen seem to be a general exception to this - but any which seem different get The Chance. He didn&#39;t give the Cult of Skaro a chance in <i>Doomsday</i>, but when he met them in Manhatten, both Sec and Caan were hit with The Chance. Davros got one, but the Emperor didn&#39;t, in Journey&#39;s End.<br><br>In the Time War, there was no &#39;leader&#39; - Davros died in the first year of the war, and we never see the Emperor (the one from Parting of the Ways). There was no-one to offer it to, and the Doctor has <i>never</i> had qualms about destroying Daleks in large numbers. Just small ones.<br><br>Rassilon, though... the problem there is that <i>The End of Time</i> hadn&#39;t yet happened for Ten. He still believes Rassilon is out to Ascend - he doesn&#39;t know the Master is even involved (he thinks he&#39;s dead). So is he working on the theory that removing Gallifrey from the Time War will stop Rassilon continuing his plan, because the threat is removed?<br><br>Or, possibly, is he worried that Rassilon <i>could</i> break out - it&#39;s not long ago that Caan pulled Davros out of the Time War, after all - and thinks that shoving the whole planet into temporal stasis is a good way to buy some time to plan? Then, when he forgets... whatever he forgets, he&#39;s still worried that Rassilon could break out.<br><br>Or else, it&#39;s all timelines: the War Doctor knew that Rassilon had failed by the end of the Time War (because the universe wasn&#39;t dead) - since it ought to have succeeded, that means something had stopped him, and the Doctor knows that pretty much only killing him would do that; therefore Ten knew that <i>the end</i> of the War was a safe place to save the planet, even though he doesn&#39;t know the specific detail that it&#39;s the Master who stopped the plan. If Rassilon was able to break out <i>earlier</i>, when his plan was still viable, that would be a different matter - though, as a neat closed loop, it was that breakout which introduced the factor which caused the ultimate failure.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Trek fandom on Tumblr is probably one of the nicest, most welcoming, and progressive-minded fandoms on Tumblr. Ship wars are quickly shut down, and everyone worships the female characters and are united in criticising and expanding on the Reboot universe to make it more like the original in terms of progressiveness.<br><br>We&#39;re a big squishy pile of Tribbles, basically.</p>

            <p>Well, at least I do. Give me a large pizza and I&#39;ll eat half in one go. All of it if I forgot breakfast. (I got a stuffed Tribble for Christmas. Her name is Fifi and she keeps waking me up at night when I accidentally roll over on her.) I love the side of the Star Trek fandom I see at conventions, because they&#39;re so darn friendly and you can tell they&#39;re passionate about it. It really is a great community when you get away from the rabid shippers.<br><br>Oddly enough, I never got much into the shipping aspect of the Star Trek fandom... and I ship in all sorts of fandoms. What I don&#39;t understand is why shipping wars even exist; so maybe you don&#39;t like a canon pairing, but here&#39;s the thing: it&#39;s /canon/. Like it or not, it&#39;s official, and saying your ship is right when the creator of your ship&#39; screw is wrong makes me extremely irritated. Once upon a time, I shipped Harry/Hermione, but that was when I was like ten years old and didn&#39;t even know what &#39;shipping&#39; was. I&#39;m an odd duck in the fact that I ship canon. Did I ship Will/Evanlyn in Ranger&#39;s Apprentice? Yes. Do I ship it now? Nope! (Friendship it, maybe, but that&#39;s it.)<br><br>Unfortunately, most of my fandoms participate in Trojan Flame Wars that put the original Trojan War to shame. And I never know what to do, because nobody seems to understand where I&#39;m coming from. Any of you ever feel like that?<br><br>Also, wow, I got really off topic. <br><br>...<br><br>Meh.</p>

            <p>...more of a &quot;well what if character x and character y were romantically interested in each other&quot; and less of a &quot;well, I have to go with canon pairings&quot;. Because we all know how well Ron and Hermione turned out...<br><br>(I&#39;m kidding. I ship H/Hr, but I recognise that in terms of the books R/Hr is canon.)<br><br>One of my pet peeves in shipping terms is when people rub canon pairings in other people&#39;s faces, or dislike all pairings that aren&#39;t canon.

I might just be hanging in Reboot/TOS fandom a lot but I haven&#39;t seen it very often here. People on Tumblr post Spirk and McKirk headcanons everywhere and everyone just loves all of them.

            <p>Maybe I should have elaborated a bit? I&#39;m not against noncanon pairings- I actually have a bit of fondness for Wolfstar, and I do rather wish Luna/Neville wasn&#39;t just a movie thing- but when people insist the author was wrong to pair up two characters, it gets on my nerves. <br><br>Go ahead and ship all the pairings you want, but don&#39;t delude yourself into thinking only your OTP is right. Everyone&#39;s entitled to their opinions. (Though I do have to question some pairings. I&#39;ve seen Dramione and the OOCness in them is revolting. I&#39;ve only read one Dramione fic that I actually love, and it&#39;s a &#39;Hermione gets transported to an alternate world where everyone&#39;s personalities are flipped&#39;. It&#39;s called &#39;Reverse&#39; by LadyMoonglow, if you&#39;re interested. Just be ready to feel nauseated by the canon good guys&#39; behavior.)<br><br>And like I said, I&#39;m a weird person who just prefers canon pairings. I guess it&#39;s because I&#39;m in contact with a publisher and hope people respect any pairings I include in my stories. Ship people with whoever you want, but please just respect my work. You know?<br><br>(Although incest is a no-no for me. Sorry, but that&#39;s a line I won&#39;t go over.)</p>

            <p>Personally I would probably laugh if someone shipped my characters with other people. And be totally fine with it (because I&#39;m very likely to write characters that are completely open to open relationships and polyamory and are a bunch of pansexuals or something because love for allllll) Unless the other person that is shipped with the character is a Mary Sue, but then this is the PPC Board and that&#39;s pretty obvious.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the Tumblr Trekkies have deluded themselves in any way. Admittedly a lot of Spock/Someone Else Not Uhura fics are set after Spock breaks up with Uhura, but there&#39;s rarely any dying for the ship going on. We all worship Uhura, so yeah. <br><br>I have seen a decent Dramione fic, and it was a crossover with Sherlock where Draco was Sherlock and Hermione was John. Generally Dramione seems to fall under the same category of Snape/Lily -- it&#39;d only work as a healthy relationship if you disregarded a giant aspect of the guy&#39;s character. Or had the guy character undergo believable development where they rejected their prejudices, because human beings are capable of such changes.<br><br>But since the majority don&#39;t think too heavily about it, I doubt that&#39;s what happens.</p>

            <p>Folks, I have a confession to make.<br>I ship Holmescest. In very specific, 100% consensual both of them are over 19 and with buckets of angst circumstances.<br>For those of you who have no knowledge of Sherlock Holmes, Holmescest is the (really obscure, and also derided on the Wikia) ship of Sherlock Holmes with his brother Mycroft. Not at all existent in ACD (except for one or two stories that WILL NOT BE MENTIONED *takes bleeprin*), it is mostly between BBC!Mycroft and BBC!Sherlock. Especially because of the 3rd season, which when one is wearing shipping goggles goes into very holmescesty territory.<br>So the point of this is: this ship, and a few others, are derided on the Wikia as being a source for mountains of badfic. Well, not derided, because the only mention of holmescest is mentioning Mycroft&#39;s tendency to become the token homophobe (which I haven&#39;t actually noticed... usually in Johnlock fics he&#39;s ships with Lestrade, which is an entire other bucket of fish), stating that we don&#39;t want to go there. <br>Now I know that incest can definitely be triggery, but I&#39;ve read good, genuinely emotional and well written stories where the paring is Mycroft/Sherlock. (example, THE SENSE OF GUILT by TheWritingKoala over on ff.net)<br>Not only that but I&#39;ve also written a few holmescest fics myself.<br>So, the question is, should rare/obscure/semi-cracky/weird ships like Holmescest be derided, or should they be respected. I just want a discussion, that&#39;s all. <br>Smaug/Bilbo is still wrong. There is a line people. A LINE.</p>

            <p>I touched upon this briefly but I think I need to explain myself. I ship anything from canon (Aang/Katara), to the rare (Lancer/Saber), to the downright crack (Yumichika/Tatuski). But still have rules about it. 1 I don&#39;t get mad at people for not shipping the same things I do. 2 They have to have something in common. ( Eg Yumichika and Tatski are both good fighters, value their independence, while still being loyal to their friends.) 3 The story has to show devolpment and the two charcters cannot hate each on sight.</p>

            <p>I used to ship Uchihacest back in the day (not one of my proudest moments considering back then I couldn&#39;t distinguish Good fic from bad). I&#39;m really not one for incest now but some of my guilty pleasures are problematic ships. It doesn&#39;t bother me as long as there&#39;s enough context between two characters in canon to create a solid and interesting dynamic. What does bother me is when I see shippers trying to put themselves on some arbitrary moral high ground by defending and/or erasing problematic aspects of a ship. <br></p>

            <p>Well, if we go by lesser-known canons, then I&#39;m fond of Reinforce/Yagami Hayate (Lyrical Nanoha) to an absurd degree, but in very specific circumstances because there is a massive age difference that could lead to a very bad place very quickly.<br><br>In better-known canons... I must agree with the pairing of Starfire/Raven mentioned earlier. <br><br>There&#39;s also the ship of Raven/Killowatt, an EXTREMELY minor character in the animated series (he doesn&#39;t even have a voice actor), but who gets an issue devoted to his backstory in the comics, where it turns out he was a superhero in an alternate dimension, who got in some kind of trouble and called out for help psychically. Raven heard and managed to summon him into their dimension, and even when they find a way to send him back she&#39;s still psychically linked to him.<br><br></p>

Vulcan and human roommates - it&#39;s like a Spirk TNG ensigns AU.<br><br>Jadzia Dax/Lenara Kahn - from the DS9 episode &quot;Rejoined&quot;. Oh gods that episode was heartbreaking. I know Jadzia/Worf eventually becomes a canon thing, but I can&#39;t help but wonder what would happen if they kept Lenara on.<br><br>Icheb/Q Junior - from the Voyager episode &quot;Q2&quot;. Q Junior is brought down to human to punish him for being callous about lower lifeforms, and the moment when he reforms is when he accidently puts Icheb&#39;s life in danger. Plus, straightlaced ex-Borg and teenage god of mischief, how is that not great?<br><br>Jason/Nico - from the Heroes of Olympus series. Don&#39;t actually know how popular it is, but it&#39;s not canon and I don&#39;t care. Nico needs a happy ending, godsdammit, and wouldn&#39;t it be a twist if the Aphrodite girl needed no man?<br>(also just found their tag on Tumblr, yes I needed this)<br><br>That&#39;s all I can think of.

I like to think they&#39;ve got a little common ground.</i><br><br>Hermione/Tonks<br><i>Tonks didn&#39;t die. She lives somewhere safe where Remus can snuggle her and love her and SHUT UP WITH YOUR LOGIC</i><br><br>Kaname Madoka (Puella Magi Madoka Magica)/Haruka Tenoh (Sailor Moon)<br><i>I didn&#39;t cover this in the previous ship because Tonks is not dead shut up shut up shut up, but I&#39;ve kind of got a thing for more platonic ships that enable other ships. With this one, it&#39;s Madoka/Homura being enabled by the canon Uranus/Neptune; Haruka&#39;s guidance allowing Madoka to accept that she and Homura love each other. Which they do. You cannot prove otherwise.

            <p>The Doctor&#39;s Wife isn&#39;t my favourite New Series episode only because Neil Gaiman wrote it.<br><br>My thing with them is that they&#39;re more than just romance--it&#39;s every kind of relationship we know of and several we don&#39;t mashed together. Friendship, siblings, rivalry, parent-child (both ways, but mostly the TARDIS as the parent), prized possession, romance, some Gallifreyan terms we don&#39;t have words for, etc... I manage to ship them in all those ways at the same time, because their relationship is incredibly complex, incredibly longstanding, and utterly unique.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>Bunny and Raffles (Raffles stories by E. W. Hornung): it&#39;s canon as you could get with the time period, and it&#39;s got some extremely rough patches... but part of the point is that although Raffles is not always a good person, he <i>attempts</i> to be good to Bunny. <br><br>Eowyn and Faramir are my favorite LOTR pairing, hands down. I don&#39;t see a lot of fic with them, though.<br><br>From <i>Recess</i>, T.J. and Spinelli. Actually, I don&#39;t see them as staying together romantically, but I see them as dating for a while in middle and high school, breaking up then being each other&#39;s go-to person the rest of their lives.<br><br>Teen Titans gives us the SisTP of Raven and Starfire (seriously, there needed to be more alien ladies bonding on that show,) and BumbleBee/Cyborg, which I really shouldn&#39;t have to explain, because they are the sassiest couple ever.<br><br>Oh, and Lyall/Biffy of <i>The Parasol Protectorate,</i>, but the entire fandom ships them. It&#39;s just a tiny fandom. Also, Madame Lefoux + I don&#39;t even know, but she desperately deserves better than her life has given her so far. She needs a strong woman who won&#39;t lie to her or attempt to steal away her son. <br><br>Chemistry and Biology: Wait, there isn&#39;t a natural sciences fandom?

            <p>I guess I&#39;ll jump on the sort of returning bandwagon. I&#39;ve been checking the Board at least semi-regularly again since around Christmas, and made a couple of posts. Though they were mostly late toward the bottom of the page.<br><br>I&#39;ve been back on the IRC for a while. RL stuff has been keeping me pretty busy, everyone knows that drill.<br><br>For people that don&#39;t remember me, I&#39;m Miah.  :D<br><br>I&#39;m married (Warcabbage), and we have three boys ages 14 (Evulcarrot), 12 (Leatherbroccoli), and 5 (The Doomsprout). We&#39;re the Angry Veggie family.  :) We have three cats, two rats, and two turtles, and live in Arkansas in the US. <br><br>I tend to read a lot of fanfic. Mostly related to TV shows. I have a particular soft spot for slightly cheesy science fiction shows. My current favorite is Haven. I&#39;ve also been a fan of Psych, NCIS (through season 6), Stagate Atlantis, Stargate SG-1, Sanctuary, Warehouse 13, Eureka, Sherlock Holmes (books and movies), Lord of the Rings, Pern, Xanth, and I am sure I am missing others.<br><br>I tend to fad over a fandom, watch a whole series in just a few days or weeks, spend a while reading fanfic for it, and then drop it for a while.<br><br>I also play Skyrim, and a little bit of Oblivion. I play Shadowrun and drive the DM (Hi Data!) crazy with characters like acrobatic gnomes that use tumbling as an offensive weapon and glowing green Sasquatches with prehensile tails.<br><br>I just passed my third PPC anniversary. I found the PPC by reading a story of Indemaat&#39;s on ff.net and following her links back here like a lost puppy dog. I have Permission and some missions in NCIS, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, Sherlock Holmes (book and movie, not Sherlock), Sanctuary, LotR, and Harry Potter. I wrote a lot with Cadmar. (He writes the best version of Luxury!)<br><br></p>

            <p>This is for a fanfic set in Haven. I realize probably no one else has canon knowledge for Haven, but I&#39;m willing to take my chances on canon. My grammar on the other hand has always been shaky, and with not having written in so long, is now rusty on top of that. <br><br>So the request is mostly for grammar, with a bit of &#39;Were the voices consistent?&#39; &#39;Are the emotional reactions within he realm of plausible for a human being?&#39;  Nothing more specific, unless someone does happen to know the canon.<br><br>The fic is long. A bit over 31,000 words. <br><br>If you do know the canon, this is an AU after episode 2x10, with some mentions of canon events in episodes 3x3 and 3x4, and is centered on Duke.</p>

            <p>I won a copy of one of its books in a mystery-writing competition and enjoyed it immensely. It&#39;s <i>Eye of the Crow</i> by Shane Peacock. I found the prose intriguing And gripping, and the sly references to the ACD canon fantastic. Despite it being children&#39;s fiction the mystery wasn&#39;t obviously solvable, too, which is great.</p>

            <p>I just finished my first fanfic! I&#39;m actually excited about writing again, for the first time in over a year.<br><br>It&#39;s crazy how many fanfics I&#39;ve read and never felt the urge to seriously try writing one until now.<br><br>I&#39;m actually really nervous about going through with posting it though. :p<br><br><br><br>Caddy and I have been trying for a long time to get a new agent pair out. We&#39;ve had their first Intro done for, a long time except the polishing, but can never quite get our act together (and yeah, I am a mostly to blame for that one).<br><br>Then I was looking through stuff and found maybe five missions in varying states of completion for Miah and Cali and Kelok and Unger. It may be that none of those ever see the light of day, though.<br></p>

            <p>I just finished a &#39;fic for a Big Bang over on LJ. I&#39;d love to read yours. What&#39;s it about?<br><br>I&#39;ve got a mission that&#39;s like, maybe a third of the way done for Ian and Lee, but I&#39;m not happy with it. I think I&#39;m going to move on from them for the time being, with perhaps the occasional background mention. Of course, that could change if I find a really good badfic to send them out on. As for my new agents... I kinda want to have a more fandom-based Sentinel/Guide pair (because that&#39;s one of my favorite cheesy Nineties&#39; shows, and fandom has really taken the main concept interesting places, which would be something I&#39;d want to exploit), but I&#39;m not sure what Department to put them in.</p>

            <p>I love Big Bang, do you have a link?<br><br>It&#39;s about Haven, which is a small fandom show on Syfy.  This is an AU taking off from episode 2x10, where a really interesting bad guy was killed off in favor of making the plot weirder. One of the characters was getting sucked down a potentially really dark path tangled up with this bad guy.<br><br>I AU&#39;d the timeline to be a little more spread out than canon (seriously the time mentioned in episodes adds up to over 15 months, but the writers later came back and claimed it all happened in less than 5 months, which makes my brain hurt), had that episode end with the bad guy not being killed, and let it run from there to see how bad things could get for the character who was tangled up with the bad guy.<br><br>The fic is in GDocs right now. I can post a link, but it is not beta&#39;d yet.</p>

            <p>I still haven&#39;t watched season 4, but I have read some stuff about it and it gets /really/ weird then.<br><br>But I really like Duke and Nathan. The writers have almost accidentally written them into really fascinating characters with wonderfully complicated backgrounds.<br><br>I&#39;m almost completely convinced that they dated at some point in time, maybe at the end of high school or shortly thereafter,  because they put more effort into annoying each other (while at the same time refusing to not constantly be around each other) than anything short of close family or former lovers can usually manage.<br><br>Just my little theory, anyway.<br><br>When you get yours up, I&#39;d like to read it.</p>
