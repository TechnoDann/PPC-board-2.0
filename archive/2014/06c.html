<li>I know both of them: Nike makes sportswear and shoes while Patagonia makes outdoors gear.<br><br>2. I don&#39;t buy Nike stuff. I do own a Patagonia coat, though.<br><br>3. Waterproof/coldproof shoes. Cool.<br><br>4. Personally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the best use of silicon ever. All of these things can be calculated if you take a map, time your walk, and do some math.

<li>How aware of you of the two brands Patagonia and Nike?<br>Never heard the first. I do have some stuff from Nike - a jacket, and I gave a baseball cap to my father as a birthday gift last year.<br>2. What products do you primarily buy from these two companies, and how do you use them? I rarely buy stuff from Nike - I usually manage to find comparable or better clothes at a more reasonable price.<br>3. How do you feel about Patagonia and Nike coming together to work on a technologically enhanced shoe? Well, depends on what you mean by technologically advanced. It is something useful? or is it just an expensive &quot;toy&quot; with little use other than showing off?<br>4. How do you feel about a technology enhanced hiking shoe that tracks the distance, speed, and elevation of your hike?<br>Might be useful if you&#39;re someone who takes hiking as a very serious hobby and wants to collect data about it, or as a &quot;black box&quot; of sorts for paramedic and military personnel. <br>5. Do you think the Pioneer is a fitting name for this shoe? Not sure, but I can&#39;t think about anything better.<br>6. What type of person do you think would buy this product? Aside from those mentioned in 4, I&#39;d say geeky or showoff people. I can&#39;t see it as something that would have a wide appeal.<br>7. What do you think of this logo for the shoe?<br><a href="http://snowythesanefangirl.deviantart.com/art/PatagoniaNike-464598615?ga_submit_new=10%253A1404145089"><a href="http://snowythesanefangirl.deviantart.com/art/PatagoniaNike-464598615?ga_submit_new=10%253A1404145089">http://snowythesanefangirl.deviantart.com/art/PatagoniaNike-464598615?ga_submit_new=10%253A1404145089</a></a> Can&#39;t see it.<br>8.

            <p>I&#39;m Italian. (Yes, before you ask I was mistaken for Spanish or Mexican already. Apparently my name exists in Spanish too, and with the same spelling)<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;d like a drawing of Agent Nikki Cherryflower (<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Nikki_Cherryflower"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Nikki_Cherryflower">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Nikki_Cherryflower</a></a>). As a badfic clone she&#39;s basically an adult Sakura Kinomoto (from Cardcaptor Sakura) with long hair, so I guess references will be abundant.<br><br>Just some quick tips, if that&#39;s not too much:<br>- The trenchcoat is standard PPC black (thing I used for the image didn&#39;t have it in that color), the rest is up to you.<br>- Be careful to take CCS Sakura as a reference, not the Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle one. Yes, there is more than one of her. Three, to be exact. (Don&#39;t ask for details - TRC is so confusing that CLAMP themselves aren&#39;t so sure what&#39;s going on in it. So, let&#39;s stay on CCS.)<br>While the TRC one is closer in age to Nikki, she always looked off to me.<br>-Hairstile is not the one on the Wiki. It&#39;s basically Sakura&#39;s (without pigtails or hair ornaments), but long. If that makes any sense.<br><br>Thank you very much!</p>

            <p>I know Nike does shoes, but the only thing I have from Patagonia is a blue velour hoodie. (It&#39;s a pretty good one.)<br>3. More power to them<br>4.

            <p>Have you read anything by Brandon Sanderson? He&#39;s my current obsession--at the moment, I&#39;m in the middle of the second book of his <i>Stormlight Archive</i> series, and good <i>glories</i>, it&#39;s fantastic. But that&#39;s a tangent. I ask if you&#39;ve read his stuff, because there&#39;s a scene from the last book of his <i>Mistborn</i> trilogy which I really want to see drawn, but contains spoilers. I can always pick something else if you haven&#39;t read it, though. I have a lot of options.<br><br>-Aila</p>

So here.<br><br>&quot;She blasted through the sky, mists streaking past her, the force of the Push straining even her mist-enhanced body with the stress of sudden acceleration.<br>And then she was out. She emerged into the open air, like a fish leaping from the water. Beneath her, the mists covered the nighttime land like an enormous white blanket. Around her, there was only empty air. Unsettling, strange.​ Above her, a million stars--normally visible only to Allomancers--watched her like the eyes of those long dead.<br>Her momentum ran out, and she spun quietly, whiteness below, light above. She noticed that she&#39;d trailed a line of mist up out of the main cloud. This hung like a tether ready to pull her back down. In fact, all the mists were spinning slightly in what looked like an enormous weather pattern. A whirlpool of white.<br>The heart of the whirlpool was directly beneath her.&quot;<br><br>The she is Vin, the main character, and she&#39;s, well, awesome. Otherwise, she&#39;s short, has black hair a little longer than her shoulders and not done up so far as I know (I don&#39;t have a copy of the book with me at the moment), and is wearing a mistcloak, which is like a cloak except it&#39;s composed of long strips of fabric bound together at the shoulders. Looking it up is probably a good idea--I can&#39;t really describe it properly.

            <p><i>Mistborn</i> is all the awesome. Seriously. The setting is interesting and the twists made me shiver; first series in a long time whose twists actually surprise me. I&#39;ve finished reading it a while ago and I&#39;m reading <i>The God-Emperor of Dune</i> right now and I can&#39;t help but notice the similarities, especially with the arc words.</p>

            <p>You should listen to your brother and read <i>Dune</i>. It&#39;s hands-down one of the best sci-fi books I&#39;ve ever read. Similarly to Kel&#39;s saying, it&#39;s a book where there&#39;s always another secret. <i>Stormlight</i> is in my to-read list after the rest of the Dune sequels, <i>The Mating Season</i> and the other books I&#39;ve bought at the annual book fair.</p>

I&#39;m pretty sure it went Diety-&gt;(Shoes, Missiles), not Diety-&gt;Missiles-&gt;Shoes or Diety-&gt;Shoes-&gt;Missiles.<br><br><b>2)</b> I don&#39;t think I own anything by either of these companies. My walk-down-to-the-store shoes are New Balance, I could just as easily wear cheap Nikes. I don&#39;t know what brand my boots are.<br><br><b>3)</b> Why do we need this? I mean, it would be great if they could make a shoe with some kind of gel sole or something that was cheaper/comfier/whatever, but I have a distinct feeling this will be another one of those nebulous &quot;high-performance&quot; products that don&#39;t do anything actually useful.<br><br><b>4)</b> Well that&#39;s certainly not what I was expecting.

            <p>Hello PPC agents and others!<br><br>My name is Dee, or Tweedle-Day, I suppose, and I wanted to come investigate the Protectors of the Plot Continuum. A few years back, I read six of the original series stories and resolved to write my own, but I never really followed through. Today, I read through the entire series, and then pounced on the spin-offs in the PPC Archives. I&#39;ve read nearly everything I could get my hands on, so I&#39;ve decided to try here to see what help I can offer. <br><br>Thank you for reading,<br>     Dee</p>

            <p>Thanks for the bear! As for fandoms, hm. I work in Sonic the Hedgehog as a beta, but I dabble in everything from anime to the BBC. Out of all of these, I mostly enjoy Harry Potter, Soul Eater, and Doctor Who. <br><br>My favorite author right now is a tie between Neil Gaiman and Terry Prachett who wrote the best book ever in Good Omens.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sad to say that Moffat being showrunner (together with the Mary Sue-race!Cybermen and DEM from &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot;) practically scared me away from DW. Especially sad since &quot;Blink&quot; is the best episode of DW I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

            <p>To my mind, the problem with &#39;Nightmare&#39; was that the Cybermen weren&#39;t &#39;Mary Sue&#39; <i>enough</i>. Think about it - they&#39;re robots. This particular version may or may not contain a human brain (I forget if it came up), but in essence, they&#39;re robots.<br><br><a href="http://qntm.org/robots">Why can we even see them move?</a> They&#39;re made of metal and electronics - they think at the speed of light - they should be undetectable until you&#39;re already dead! We actually <i>have</i> a Cyberman moving ultra-fast in &#39;Nightmare&#39;, and it&#39;s just as lethally effective as it ought to be. So why, why, <i>why</i> do we revert to the Napoleonic War era tactic of marching in straight lines? Even the title suggests that we&#39;ll be seeing Cybermen slipping through the shadows like ghosts - something out of a nightmare. In <a href="http://collider.com/neil-gailman-doctor-who-cybermen-interview/">this interview</a>, Neil Gaiman actually says the idea of silent movement is what always scared him about them in the old days. So... why ain&#39;t they doing it?<br><br>And then there&#39;s the Cyber-Planner. I really liked the Matt-on-Matt acting extravaganza. My problem with this scene is that the Doctor&#39;s plan, uh, shouldn&#39;t have worked. Not with chess, and not without more setup. A Cyberman could literally work out every single move left in the game - telling it &#39;I know something you don&#39;t know&#39; just... couldn&#39;t work. Play a different game - quantum chess, so there&#39;s always the million-to-one &#39;uncertainty&#39; rule... and even after it&#39;s ruled that out, there&#39;s the <i>billion</i>-to-one chance, and it just keeps planning deeper into the maze? - absolutely. Throw in some technobabble about the Cyber-planner being corrupted or something, yes. But as it stood? No.<br><br>I think &#39;Nightmare&#39; could have been a really scary episode, setting up the Cybermen as... anti-Weeping Angels. Angels are fast but freeze when you look at them; Cybermen are/could be so fast you <i>can&#39;t</i> look at them. Cyber-ghosts, if you will. One of them can take out an entire building. Throw in locked doors and basements, and you have a horror movie. Throw in some technobabble that lets humans accelerate to Cyberspeed for, say, a second at a time - then knocks them out for half an hour - and you have a <i>Doctor Who</i> story. Add the constant threat of cybermites taking over members of your team - it&#39;s a good thing they leave external hardware! - and the fact that the Doctor has a) been compromised, and b) claims that he can not only beat his own infection but also the Cyber-ghost running around murdering the army - and oh, by the way, also the three million Cyber-ghosts that have just woken up, half a world away but that&#39;s only half an hour&#39;s travel time - ... and you have a story worthy of the title <i>Nightmare in Silver</i>.<br><br>And I wonder whether the script used to be more like this, but was turned down a notch because of similarities to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide_(Doctor_Who)">Hide</a>.

            <p>... for a story that does pretty much exactly that, but with Daleks. We&#39;ve seen enough Dalek variants over the years (Special Weapons being the one that springs to mind) that it could work. I&#39;d set it in the Dalek Dark Archive - the place they keep all the prototypes they aren&#39;t yet desperate enough to use. ;) So the characters (it&#39;s actually the Alchemist and one of his companions) could face the flying Dalek Swarm - a collection of centrally controlled Dalek Drones - a spike-covered Dalek Maiden (as in Iron) - a radioactive and incandescent Dalek Furnace... all manner of things. All in a dark and maze-like factory.<br><br>Uh, back to Cybermen. Since their very first appearance, they&#39;ve been claiming to be super-smart and emotionless. Except... they never <i>are</i>. <b>All</b> their plans consist of &#39;(sneak around and then) frontal attack&#39;. It&#39;s not like the Daleks, who occasionally actually have brilliant plans (even if the Doctor then beats them); I can&#39;t come up with a single well-thought-out Cyberman scheme. Even their sneaky plans (<i>The Next Doctor</i> are just schemes to get big enough weapons to hit everything until it breaks.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Dalek thing, that is.  Sounds fun.<br><br>On the Cybermen, part of the problem is that they have a quick and easy shortcut for writers.  Just press upgrade to make them more powerful.  Done.  You don&#39;t need to think if you are writing them.  <br><br>However, if you do think when you are writing them, you could have a really dangerous villain, that lives up to its hype.<br><br>The Daleks have interesting plans because they don&#39;t have that kind of shortcut.  They don&#39;t really change because they think they are perfect beings.  The only thing they can do is plan better.  <i>Asylum of the Daleks</i> was, I think, a good example of that.  How do we, the Daleks, take down the most beautiful of our kind to solve our problem?  Send in our greatest foe, let him do it, and then nuke him from orbit.  It is a brilliant plan, because it needs to be a brilliant plan.  There is no other way.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>My problem with NiS&#39; Cybermen is their &quot;upgrading&quot; schtick. OK, so those guys are tough, that&#39;s fine; weak villains are usually less interesting. So you can only beat those guys in a certain way - also fine, though a bit clichй. The problem is that they can No Sell everything you throw at them, and the only way to get rid of them is to nuke the planet from orbit. That&#39;s OK in the grimderpness of WH40K, but not in the Whoniverse. The Whoniverse isn&#39;t grimderp.</p>

            <p>&#39;No Sell&#39;? But I get the picture. I&#39;m not sure what the &#39;certain way&#39; in question was - TARDIS Wiki talks about some sort of pulse device, I guess it&#39;s that?<br><br>But no, I have no problem with &#39;they can upgrade to account for everything you do&#39;. Not &#39;become immune to&#39;, naturally - but if you&#39;re rolling boulders down on them, they should be able to upgrade thick body armour, possibly tripod-style supports. Phobos&#39; idea of total physical restructuring is the key to that version - and given that we have the cybermites and detatchable hands, it&#39;s absolutely not out of the question.<br><br>But a change introduces new weaknesses. So now they&#39;re immune to boulders - but to get the mass, they&#39;ve had to merge several Cybermen into a single unit, and they&#39;re also ridiculously heavy. Got a gravity globe you can shoot, like in <i>Flesh and Stone</i>? That&#39;s an escape route for you, since there&#39;s no way a Cybertank can make the &#39;jump and catch the reverse gravity&#39;. Or, with a little technobabble, maybe you focus the reversal on the single-unit tank, which can&#39;t hold on against the pull - so then they separate, and you go back to the boulders.<br><br>The problem with the nuclear strike, to my mind, isn&#39;t that it was dark (er, &#39;grimderp&#39;, apparently?); <i>Doctor Who</i> has never shied away from megadeaths for any stretch. No, the problem is that it wasn&#39;t <i>clever</i>. It&#39;s like <a href="http://xkcd.com/444/">Macgyver&#39;s gun</a>; we signed up to watch the Doctor come up with a clever plan to fix things, not to watch him resort to brute force.<br><br>As I&#39;ve said elsewhen: both RTD and Moffat have a tendency to have someone else provide the solution at the end of the episode (whether it&#39;s a true deus ex machina depends on the story). The difference is that RTD drove the Doctor into situations he couldn&#39;t fix; Moffat sets him problems he can&#39;t fix <i>without dying</i>, or without massively compromising his principles (<i>The Beast Below</i>). And the nice - and slightly scary - thing about Eleven is that he almost always chose to save the world (or whatever) anyway.<br><br>(Random Example, for if my explanation broke down somewhere in there: <i>The Parting of the Ways</i> sits the Doctor in front of a Dalek invasion of Earth. He is unable to do anything except send Rose home; she then shows up out of nowhere and saves him. <i>Nightmare in Silver</i> sits the Doctor between the Cybermen and the universe, and gives him a nuclear bomb - which he is willing to use, despite the fact that he&#39;s sitting pretty at Ground Zero. I&#39;m not saying the difference is universal, but it&#39;s a definite theme)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I'm not 100% sure where to put this, and it seems weird putting it here instead of just PMing Herr, Turtle, and the other ME fans, but what the hey. You're all ficcers, right?</p>

<p><br><p>After reading through College Fool&#39;s excellent <a href="http://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/2012/09/16/sunday-special-renegade-reinterpretations/">Renegade Reinterpretations</a>, I was struck that (s)he had the chance to substantially thaw human-turian relations, but did not do so. Being a <b>big</b> turian fanboy, that sort of disappointed me, and since the whole point of RR is to <i>change</i> things, I sort of thought it would be nice to give the h-t relationship another chance.</p>
<br><p>The fic proposal I&#39;m talking about here isn&#39;t really anything other than a skeleton- I sort of thought of it coming after one of the more status-quo endings RR outlines, but it at the moment has no plot and no real direction. I&#39;m working on two very much above-top-secret projects right now, so even if I decide to go through with it it&#39;d just end up on the bottom of the queue to be resumed a year or more from now, but I still sort of want to get the basic idea of it down on paper.</p>
<br><p>I&#39;ve tried to remain true to the often warped morality of the original RR, where history is set up to make sure <i>every</i> option is a Renegade one. In any other setting, the group I&#39;m evaluating as a protagonist or Big Good would be a major threat to pretty much everyone, if it could even exist at all. But really, compared to the Terminus barbarians or the moribund, sclerotic Council alluded to in RR itself and the truly exceptional <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9075819/1/A-season-of-sorrows-unending-the-Cerberus-Files">Cerberus Files</a>, they aren&#39;t intended to seem <i>that bad</i>.</p>
<br><p>Really all I&#39;ve produced thus far is three character sketches, and I think I&#39;m going to stop there for the time being, although the first sketch (Gul&#39;s) reveals much of the world&#39;s philosophical underpinnings and scrabbles blindly at the earliest threads of a plot. They are appended as replies to the post. I don&#39;t expect to get too many replies to this, but concrit is as always appreciated.</p></p>

            <p>Regarding Gul&#39;s military service: I sort of assumed that even turians have military positions that don&#39;t deal with front-line combat- they&#39;d have to, to prevent the whole thing from falling apart. Since Gul is comparatively weak (and got top grades) I sort of thought that while he certainly <i>did</i> serve in the military, it was at a desk job. An interpreter was the single most innocuous thing I could think of him doing, for contrast, although he could easily have been involved in the turian intelligence apparatus (such as it is) at a relatively high level.<br><br>You&#39;re right about the biotics, though. More importantly because that ability adds precious little to his character by existing even if I could make it make sense (some kind of anomaly where his biotics developed late in his life, amp damaged in whatever explosion messed up his face, etc.)<br><br>And Teron exists primarily because Gul has a skills vacuum that neither he nor Rel can easily fill. Since I thought of co-writing this, the other author could easily take her over, although she might also die early on or something to convince Rillek to reach out to Sheperd. I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t spend much time on her and I probably should have spent more.<br><br>And yes. Do read RR and the Cerberus Files- they are both <b>truly awesome</b>.</p>

            <p><font color="#252525"><font><b>Teron Argovigian</b></font></font></p>

<p><br><p><font color="#252525"><font><b>Female turian</b></font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font><b>~48 (20-30 equivalent?)</b></font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>Teron is Rillek&#39;s primary muscle, a seasoned special operations fighter and (very briefly) Blue Suns merc. She&#39;s one of the less-developed characters in terms of tangibles. I&#39;m not 100% sure where she came from or why she works for Rillek- I <i>think</i> she was a part of the Cerberus alien infiltrator program who somehow managed to get the equivalent of an “honorable discharge” and signed up with Rillek because she has nowhere else to go, but I really don&#39;t know.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>She&#39;s essentially a walking action movie in terms of capabilities, and personality as well- if an area has Teron Argovigian sent to it, things <i>will</i> blow up before she&#39;s done. She&#39;s neither subtle nor particularly concerned with collateral damage, and quite ruthless in terms of interrogations, etc. It&#39;s possible that Rillek was originally grooming her as a successor, before abandoning that when it became clear she was a blunt instrument with no head for politics (which begs the question of just who Rillek&#39;s successor <i>is</i>, since he definitely expects this to be a decades-long operation and Ren will leave as soon as the paychecks stop). I don&#39;t think she really <i>enjoys</i> killing people or “the thrill of the hunt” per se, so much as she just likes doing <i>really awesome things</i> against really horrible people.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>One thing I&#39;m sure of is that Tron does <i>not</i> like asari. Not sure why, or even if there <i>is</i> a reason, but the concept of aliens that can get inside her head remotely inspires what can only be described as pure terror, and not used to being afraid of pretty much anything she channels that into general rage.</font></font></p></p>

            <p><font color="#252525"><font><b>Ren'Zalgo vas Orpheon</b></font></font></p>

<p><br><p><font color="#252525"><font><b>Male quarian</b></font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font><b>~56 (40-50 equivalent, may change as quarian lifespan is poorly established)</b></font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font><i>“Gul Rillek... Strange man, I&#39;m not entirely convinced he doesn&#39;t just want to declare himself Primarch and take over the rest from there. But he pays well.”</i></font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>Since Gul Rillek has all the technical skill of my grandmother on acid, he&#39;s hired a quarian engineer to be his combination bodyguard and technical adviser. Ren&#39;Zalgo vas Orpheon is there to, among other things, manage Rillek&#39;s wide variety of research and development projects, <i>explain</i> those projects in words a military linguist cum political operator can understand, and remind said linguist that you need to click “save” before turning off the omni-tool, it doesn&#39;t just “write things down” automatically.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>Ren cares little about Gul&#39;s long-term goals, although he does take a quiet professional pride in how far his assistance has advanced them. Largely amoral in his professional capacity, he&#39;s mostly concerned with maintaining the large paycheck that he sends back to his family on the Migrant Fleet. There&#39;s a sort of middle-class dignity to him quite at odds with what he often participates in: wake up too late, skip breakfast, identify possible Reaper indoctrination methods, business lunch with the ExoGeni representatives, video call with the kids, review systems analysis of geth body parts, send message to that ex-Teltin doc, eat dinner thinking of your wife, keep Gul from deleting his hit list <i>again</i>, make travel plans to visit the Fleet next time it&#39;s near a relay, go to bed early.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>And good Gods, what he does for a living. Gul Rillek sees Council restrictions on AI, genetic augmentation, and other fringe technologies as pointless, is enamored with human Upbringing and Reaper indoctrination, and actively pursues advanced conventional technologies for leverage and outright personal use. Since he works with Cerberus and even less savory operations, that results in a helluva lot of weird and dangerous things going on, and Ren oversees all of it.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>There&#39;s too much research occurring for Ren to get involved personally with much of it, and the Rillek operation can&#39;t afford to do much of it in-house. Therefore, Ren&#39;s primary research function is to act as a go-between with a <i>lot</i> of corporations and outside actors, including Salarian academic bodies, major defense contractors, and Systems Alliance military research groups.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>While not wearing a labcoart on a day-to-day basis, Ren is still a highly competent technician, and can use those abilities to defend himself in a fight. As a result, he is often sent to particularly important operations to oversee them personally, generally those with a strong technical component but also anything requiring precision or careful planning, things that Teron is incapable of properly executing. There&#39;s little business-related information that Ren keeps from his boss, or his boss from him- while neither has the time or energy to fully understand what the other does, they try to provide the most salient points to prevent chain-of-command screwups. Over all, their working relationship is good- Gul&#39;s estate has seen a friendly visit from the Zalgo family on at least one occasion.</font></font></p></p>

            <p><font color="#252525"><font><b>Gul Rillek</b></font></font></p>

<p><br><p><font color="#252525"><font><b>Male turian</b></font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font><b>~82 (50-60 equivalent)</b></font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font><i>“You&#39;re saying that we should have let the humans take Kar&#39;shan?” “I&#39;m saying we should have finished the job ourselves.”</i></font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>Although this venture would very much be <i>about</i> Gul Rillek and his goals, I don&#39;t really see him as the protagonist so much as he is the prime mover, much more G-Man than Freeman. Rillek is a wealthy Palaven-based.... I guess you could call him a combination industrialist, crime boss, and political lobbyist. He has some very... “interesting” ideas about aliens.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>Rillek is a hard-line Assimilationist. According to him, most of the galaxy, from asari to krogan, are culturally degenerate, and only being subsumed into a massive new Turian Hierarchy can “fix” them. The fact that the <i>current</i> Hierarchy is (in his view) a watered-down puppet state of the Council is just one more obstacle to overcome, really just one more alien race to absorb or exterminate. When confronted with the Systems Alliance, he didn&#39;t see the same Borg-like nightmare the Council saw- since his idea of the ideal Hierarchy already <i>was</i> a Borg-like nightmare, in the humans he found a race of mechanized, militarized, red-blooded turians. Hence the idea of using the humans to accomplish his goals . They&#39;re culturally almost identical to turians, they&#39;re militarily powerful, and most importantly they have yet to suffer the “creeping sclerosis of the Citadel” that turned the real turians into simpering errand boys for the asari. Rillek is utterly convinced that when the smoke clears and the tanks have rolled through the Presidium, humans won&#39;t dominate or be dominated by turians so much as the two sides will simply <i>merge</i>... and then assimilate or exterminate everyone else.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>This being RR, Rillek is very much Not Nice. He&#39;s not just willing to justify the means with an end- it&#39;s that the end itself is a bit suspect. He thinks the genophage was a swell idea, and wants to apply it to other species like the Vorcha that he considers to possess a warped idea of population dynamics. He considers a war with the Terminus systems “infinitely preferable to the alternative”. And for whatever reason, he really, <i>really</i> likes labor camps. I&#39;d best characterize his alignment as “angry good”, with good being relative to the RR norm.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>I&#39;m not sure how powerful Gul Rillek is <i>right now</i>, but it&#39;s probably not very. He certainly doesn&#39;t expect governments to change within his own lifetime, and his ideas are just too weird to net him any popular support should he move around openly. He doesn&#39;t really have an army of his own- just mercs and random thugs, and I don&#39;t think that if push came to shove he could even really hire that many of those. But at the same time, I think he&#39;s passed the point where he&#39;s just building up resources, and is now actively influencing the galactic political scene. Which probably means Councillor Sparatus should just go ahead and make peace with his ancestors as quickly as possible.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>Rillek is able to bring his essentially subversive politics in line with his extreme (even for a turian) nationistic and authoritarian nature only through his truly collossal hubris. Gul Rillek is firmly convinced that he is simply <i>smarter</i> than the Primarch, smarter than the Council, and that Only He knows what&#39;s best for the turian people and the rest of the galaxy.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>In personal terms, I have surprisingly little to say about the guy. He&#39;s not particularly dynamic or charming, nor is he particularly abrasive. He&#39;s a biotic, although a very very bad one (going to have to check up on whether a turian biotic could ever be allowed to completely squander his abilities and receive no training whatsoever), has no combat skills to speak of, and has only a layman&#39;s understanding of scientific and technical fields (hence his employment of Ren).</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>He looks... well, he looks like a turian, although early on I decided that the right side of his face is scarred, charred, or maybe just outright synthetic. To hear Rillek tell it (he does so in person rarely, but the information is floating around somewhere), he was born into a mildly wealthy family, served as an interpreter in the turian military, and participated in a series of raids against batarian slaver operations. One such raid went disastrously wrong, and after taking a grenade at close range Gul Rillek was forced to play dead as he watched his surviving squadmates dragged off to slavery, all of which sparked his conviction that the galaxy needs to be reformed. All of the official records support that (with the possible exception of the Shadow Broker&#39;s), but after the “interpreter” part none of it&#39;s true. He worked in an office far from the Terminus, got his face mangled in some unfortunate accident (Rillek mentions a female soldier he was close to in the heroic version, and she is a real person- maybe he was injured while doing something stupid to try to impress her?!), and came into his politics entirely without direct outside influence. But politics demands a narrative, and so he produced one...</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>Other than that, Gul Rillek has a few quirks, mostly relating to his truly massive hubris. He never verbalizes “opinions” or “beliefs”- things simply <i>are</i>, because Gul Rillek is never wrong. He avoids any sort of romantic &#39;shipping: due to his “disfigurement”, he thinks anyone interested in him is such because of his power and influence, and does not feel comfortable participating in something that one-sided (read, the fact that he thinks he&#39;s in charge of everything makes him unable to perceive someone as freely giving consent). One way I thought of to really <i>show</i> the core characterization was having him, once he&#39;d met them, actively try to maneuver Shepard and Garrus Vakarian into a &#39;ship, because that really gets to the core of who Gul Rillek <i>is</i>- supremely convinced he&#39;s right, and absolutely incapable of comprehending that some things aren&#39;t his business to mind.</font></font></p>
<br><p><font color="#252525"><font>Letting his titanic sense of infallibility be his undoing seems almost... clichй. I want to make him smart enough to adapt and paranoid enough to include redundancies in case he&#39;s tactically wrong, and I don&#39;t really think his hubris extends to day-to-day decision making. Rillek <i>must</i> be able to admit temporary defeats, listen to his advisers, accurately evaluate his opponents, and react competently to failures. I think that sometimes he proposes ideas that he deliberately knows to be bad, just to weed out the yes-men in his inner circle. He&#39;s read <a href="http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html">the handbook</a>, basically.</font></font></p></p>

            <p>...that in the canon itself, at least some of the characters are aware of the fact that they&#39;re code.

One thing I can think of is to actually have the character inhabit a specialized arcade cabinet developed by DoSAT that can plug into the wall, and then their partner can plug a mobile gaming console or something like that into the wall so that the WIR characters can sort of tag along for missions, and then take the shenanigans from there. (After all, Ralph was able to get into two games with vastly superior graphics via walking through the outlets, right?) It&#39;s just a possibility, though, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>

            <p>If they can get into power supplies as a part of their nature then they can get into all SORTS of devices, and probably become highly overpowered, so I for one would restrict their natural traversal abilities to things native to the WiW continuum and have all others be initially incompatible.

            <p>I was initially going to go with the last because I couldn&#39;t imagine how knowing or not knowing you were digital would change that fact, but actually it matters quite a lot- video games are not, internally, related to computers in any way, so Azeroth is just as &quot;real&quot; as Middle Earth.<br><br>Therefore, I think whatever rules apply in-universe would apply here- if they can&#39;t enter the physical world in any way in canon, they cannot do so in Headquarters either...<br><br>BUT this can easily be changed for authorial convenience- running them through the laser from Tron or a Star Trek mobile hologram emitter could make them tangible.</p>

For at least some of us Oldbies, we&#39;ve been here over a decade - making friends we knew almost nothing about, and watching them slip away.

            <p>I miss Fangorn. Sometimes I think the quiet smoldering rage of watching old forests be swallowed by housing developments is tied directly to that nostalgia for a forest that never existed. I miss Tortall, too, even though the Emelan series was my favorite. And, even though I&#39;ve only a passing familiarity with the &#39;verse, the Isle of Roke is a powerful place in my dreams and longing.<br><br>It&#39;s funny, I was just talking today to a friend about the longing, desire, thirst for things we do not understand, which cannot be articulated, and how it is such an important and central part of us. Everyone finds that differently, but it was C.S. Lewis, I think, who pointed it out as one of the greatest connectors of people, and I think it&#39;s something that makes up so much art and literature. Tolkien wasn&#39;t just describing a beautiful forest, he was reaching for the articulation of a very specific place in the heart, not just the mind, that resonates so strongly with those of us who articulate that desire in the same direction.<br><br>(Kinda cool, actually; as we were talking, driving down from the mountains back into town, the rays of sunlight literally filled the valley where town lies, bending through the clouds, and on the southern horizon, dark clouds turned into rain over the hills. It was one of those odd moments where - Calvin and Hobbes, right? - the landscape oddly reflected the conversation.)</p>

            <p>Like you said, I&#39;ve never actually been there. I can go back, insomuch as anyone <i>can</i>, at any point in time. The only time I can remember <i>not</i> missing it is before I read it, holding a copy of <i>The Last Battle</i> and wondering what the heck this was and should I maybe read it?<br><br>I miss the Shire too. This is a little different, though. I feel like I used to have a different image of the Shire than I do now. A pre-movie image, perhaps? I also feel like there was so much more of it once, but I forgot and now I can&#39;t find it again. :,(<br><br>Now that you&#39;ve got me thinking about it, I miss a lot. I miss Rohan. I miss Prydia so much I can&#39;t even read those books anymore. There&#39;s a ridiculous land from my dreams once that I miss so much that every time I go to sleep I try to dream about it. I never have, and perhaps it&#39;s for the best, as that particular land is based off a real place. A mansion that only appears in nightmares, but I still want to be there.<br><br>I miss people too; people I never knew, who never existed. Not even fictional people, just people who never were. A confused four-year-old&#39;s conglomeration of one of my uncles and my granddad, I think. A boyfriend who never wore anything but green - but I&#39;ve never had a boyfriend. A pet owl - but who keeps owls as pets in the real world?<br><br>I&#39;ve never missed fictional characters like that. Sometimes I miss my own characters, but it&#39;s never this sharp but deep stabbing feeling, like I&#39;m truly missing something from my life, something I once had. That moment when it catches you unawares and you find you&#39;re almost -<br><br>Okay, I need to look into this stupid sentimentality. But yeah, I get what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;m also glad I&#39;m not the only one.</p>

They box in the imagination, locking us out of the infinite realm the places and people might have inhabited before, and the physical experience is often so powerful it drives out our own memories and minds.

            <p>No, you don&#39;t sound crazy. At least, not to me (and I am only supposedly sane). Especially the friends part. I&#39;ve been around for about three years (wait, that much? Huh), but I&#39;ve been drifting on and off. I do, however, experience something rather similar to what you&#39;ve described in another place: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=co7mi270xg719ot3qrio1z71">this</a> RP. The RP is always there, but the people change. Some move on, some return after disappearing... the connections between people shift. Sometimes I look back and sigh in melancholia (when I don&#39;t cringe, that is).</p>

            <p>I mean, cy-bugs have to come from somewhere, so there could be smaller ones (potentially many) in the form of &quot;babies&quot; or some smaller size class in addition to human-sized ones, so I think there&#39;s sufficient situational wiggle-room to have either ambiguous or unambiguous CB minis.</p>

            <p>The whole purpose of a Cy-bug is to eat and reproduce, right? Considering all the yummy new tech and whatnot at HQ, even a mini Cy-bug could be problematic. Maybe the minis are miniatures of the characters/whatever, but with the occasional glitch, much like Vanellope has in-canon?</p>

            <p>(Though I&#39;d love to have a technical discussion, too...)<br><br>I&#39;ve recently discovered that there seems to be a long-running, slow-burning, and extremely virulent war between the two sides of the discussion of Tolkien linguistics.<br><br>On the one hand, you have people like David Salo (who did the Sindarin for the films) and Helge Fauskanger (<a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">Ardalambion</a>); they take the stance that it&#39;s possible and desirable to collate standardised versions of Sindarin and Quenya, which can be treated like, say, Basque - people can take a course, read a dictionary, and write in them.<br><br>On the other foot, you have the view of the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship: Carl F. Hostetter (<a href="http://www.elvish.org/VT/">Vinyar Tengwar</a>) and the  editorial team for <a href="http://www.eldalamberon.com/index1.html">Parma Eldalamberon</a>. They believe that Tolkien&#39;s languages should be seen as an evolving process (which is part of why <i>PE</i> is publishing Tolkien&#39;s linguistic papers in chronological order), and according to Hostetter&#39;s <a href="http://www.elvish.org/articles/">Elvish as She Is Spoke</a> (top link on that page), that:<br><br>&#39;<i>the best way to develop real linguistic knowledge of the Elvish languages as Tolkien thought about and described them [...] is this: [...] Engag[ing] first in deep and thoughtful study of all that Tolkien himself wrote, of the modes of expression that he employed in his Elvish compositions, and of the subjects of expression that interested him, [...] will provide [...] both the inspiration and the means to make new expression in the languages as they actually are...</i>&#39; (Paraphrased from the final page before the footnotes).<br><br>The implication seems to be that, while one can make some effort at using the Elvish languages now, the best way to do it would be to wait for absolutely everything to be released, then read through it all in order, possibly with a degree in linguistics to help out.<br><br>And, I suppose, I agree - that <i>would</i> lead to the best results. But on the other hand, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to ask me to wait fifty years and take a few university courses before I&#39;m allowed to try my hand at Quenya. I have no doubt that Ardalambion has errors, both in its assumptions and in that it doesn&#39;t account for unpublished material - but it&#39;s there <i>now</i>, and the linguistic papers aren&#39;t. Nor will they ever be, for me - I just don&#39;t have the skillset to learn Quenya from the original texts. I&#39;d rather make a few mistakes and play with something beautiful <i>now</i>.<br><br>But if I were just stating that, I wouldn&#39;t need to post here. ;) What does anyone else think? This is delving into linguistic philosophy, I guess. For that matter, what do you think <i>Tolkien</i> would have thought? Would he even have wanted people using his languages? If he&#39;d lived to today, would he have settled on a final form yet? (Iiiii&#39;m gonna say no) What does it all MEAN?!?!?<br><br>Er, sorry. Got a little carried away with that last.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well - to state/restate the obvious, languages evolve. English is changing every day, both in slow and gradual ways and in more immediate ones; some of these changes are welcomed, some are scorned, <s>which is which depends mostly on the racial and socioeconomic status of the population where the change is seen to have originated</s>*, but most eventually do make their way into standard lexicons, only to be pushed out later...<br><br>But how does this relate to a fictional language, like Tolkien&#39;s Quenya and Sindarin? As far as we know, the populations who &quot;originally&quot; used them aren&#39;t around, still using them, allowing them to evolve as they get used conversationally. In that sense, they are essentially dead languages; like Latin, or Old English, the point of learning them tends to be for very specific purposes of understanding either a document - Elvish poetry, for example - or a very, very specific subset of people. So to that extent, it makes sense to treat them... well, like Basque. You read the materials, you learn the languages, and then you use the language in whatever way you had intended - say, to write poetry or communicate with excellent geek friends.<br><br>The thing about the evolving process of Tolkien&#39;s work being published, I guess, in the way it seems they&#39;re doing it, is that it feels really artificial. Languages evolve in a very organic, messy, chaotic process, taking their cue from pretty much every aspect of the cultures they inhabit and other overlapping languages and cultures. If these languages are going to evolve they&#39;d do so by being <i>spoken</i>. Which means, quite possibly and if enough people start picking them up, that they&#39;ll wind up evolving in two different directions - a vernacular, informal version (which, given the predilections of linguists and the folks likely to learn Elvish, is still going to be probably quite formal), and the version that the scholars eventually come out with in a few decades when all of Tolkien&#39;s work has been pored over enough times.<br><br>Either way, interesting times!<br><br>*of course, eventually the &quot;bad&quot; dialects of English, because they&#39;re spoken by a demographic generally disapproved of by gatekeepers, becomes cool and rebellious, and catches on, leading to essentially appropriation of a dialect by restless and rebellious youth, leading to backlash by the original speakers of said dialects, leading to a lot of confusion about whether it&#39;s okay to speak a dialect of English that&#39;s been used as a tool of oppression for social credit if you&#39;re never likely to be oppressed by those selfsame gatekeepers, or whether it&#39;s just a part of linguistic culture that dialects catch on over time.

            <p>Obviously, the ability to speak Quenya or Sindarin is quite young - or, as some would say, not yet there! And the data coming out of ELF is going to lead to revisions of what we &#39;know&#39;, so the speakable Exilic Quenya of twenty years hence will not be the same as it is today.<br><br>But... what about in a hundred years? All of Tolkien&#39;s data should be available by then, which means Quenya courses and wordlists can be as &#39;up to date&#39; as possible - though of course not matching what was in Tolkien&#39;s head, because he almost certainly didn&#39;t write most of it down. But when a stable, consensus Quenya exists - will it evolve in the way you&#39;re talking about, creating a vernacular version? I guess that would depend on there being communities which use it (rather than just fanfics using the same rote phrases over and over). Maybe something like Second Life could have Quenya (and Sindarin - showing my bias, there!)-only regions.<br><br>Or, of course, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=259793;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">we could start a whole spaceship speaking it</a>. That would probably do it too.<br><br>I think the transition to &#39;vernacular&#39; Quenya will come when people start coining their own... not words, but <i>roots</i>. At the moment, we want to stay close to Tolkien, which leads to doing things like trying to paraphrase &#39;window&#39; as &#39;lightdoor&#39; - something that natural languages rarely do. Can a consensus Vernacular Quenya (Seventh Age Quenya? Atani Quenya?) come into existence with actual new words? I don&#39;t know; it seems like we&#39;d get a proliferation of dialects and creoles long before we got a stable version.<br><br>But give it a century or two... hmm.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s probably true that we&#39;d get a proliferation of dialects and creoles first - the test would be whether they came together into a stable language, or went off in their own directions, evolving into entirely separate language sub-groups. I&#39;d love to see what such a population would look like in a few hundred years - with the internet, it&#39;s especially interesting. Language doesn&#39;t usually evolve (especially from so small a beginning pool) in ways such that all the areas can (and likely will) speak to each other so often.</p>

            <p>On the five hundredth anniversary of the release of the film that popularised it – the original, Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings – it seems appropriate to examine the place the Elvish language, Quenya, has taken in our society.<br><br>This language, invented in the Late Middle Ages by J.R.R. Tolkien, has something of a cult following: a startlingly large number of the system&#39;s communities use some form of it. But the forms in question are as diverse as the populations that employ them. The dominant varieties are:<br><br><b>Helgan Quenya</b><br><br>This variant is closest to the original work of Tolkien; it strives to employ only words and grammatical constructs attested in his works. Unfortunately, this also makes it rather limited in vocabulary: it is rarely employed in vocal speech, being rather confined to text-based systems, where its limits can be worked around at length.<br><br><b>Third Age Exilic Quenya (Reconstructed)</b><br><br>The North American nation of Laurelindуrenan began its existence using an even more restricted form of Helgan Quenya – they utilised only words dated from the period of the writing and publication of The Lord of the Rings. However, the impossibility of running a country with such a limited language soon led to compromises and expansions. Some hundred and fifty years later, 3AEQ(R) is a thriving, living language, with speakers numbering in the millions.<br><br><b>Grelvish</b><br><br>Perhaps the most wide-spread of the Quenya languages, Grelvish is also the most conservative. Originally created from a combination of Quenya and Sindarin, its wordlists have long ago taken on the status of holy writ. Any Grelvish speaker who dares to alter the sacred language faces exile – or worse.<br><br><b>Йlvоshл</b><br><br>More of a writing system than a true language, Йlvоshл adds random accents and extraneous final &#39;л&#39;s to English words. It is the official orthographic system of the newly-terraformed &#39;Vйnыsл&#39;.<br><br><b>Finno-Quenya</b> and <b>Elf-Latin</b><br><br>While functionally unrelated, it makes sense to group these languages together: they each borrow words and grammar from another language (Finnish and Latin, respectively) to expand and complete the Quenya corpus. Finno-Quenya is virtually the only Quenya language spoken in Europe, while Elf-Latin has recently been adopted as the official ceremonial language of the trans-Uranian science stations.<br><br><b>Neo-Qenya</b><br><br>Rather than utilising Tolkien&#39;s incomplete later writings, Neo-Qenya draws on the pre-Lord of the Rings &#39;Qenya&#39; language. Strange and alien-sounding even to other Quenya speakers, it is perhaps no surprise that Neo-Qenya has become widely spoken in the Martian hinterlands.<br><br><b>Seventh Age Unified Quendian</b><br><br>Originally created as an effort to &#39;modernise&#39; and &#39;update&#39; the holy Grelvish (and thus to demonstrate that it was not truly divine), 7AUQ has since become a popular tongue in its own right. The fastest-growing of the Quenya group, it blends Quenya and Sindarin into a cohesive and unique whole which has been deliberately shaped to allow forms of artistic expression not available in other languages.<br><br><hr>

            <p>Treat it like Latin.<br><br>Latin, for all that the classical civilizations are still studied, is a dead language. Quenya and Sindarin have the same problem; the original speakers are all dead, what with never being alive in the first place. We&#39;re going to have to invent new words for things that didn&#39;t exist in the cultural context of Second- and Third-Age Middle-Earth, kind of like how the Welsh word for microwave is <i>popty-ping</i> and the Blackfoot word for horse, <i>ponokamita</i>, translates literally as &quot;elk-dog&quot; - and contrary to what you&#39;ve said, this happens all the time when new cultural influences come into play for a particular culture with a particular language. German&#39;s famous for compound words that go on forever. English is the ultimate mongrel language, what with being invaded by everyone and then invading everyone else.<br><br>Otherwise, well... what&#39;s the point of learning it at all? It can&#39;t be to read documents in them, because like you said, eventually we&#39;ll run out of Tolkien&#39;s material. So learning it becomes based around the creation of new works, and that in turn necessitates the creation of new words. You&#39;re right, there will be a lot of different dialects springing up as a direct result of this, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily a bad thing; the Quenya-speaking community is comparatively tiny, so the really stupid stuff can get weeded out while the words that people actually want to use will stay.<br><br>Finally, the Welsh word for jellyfish is <i>piskodden-wibblywob</i>. I may have misspelled it, but I assure you I am not making that up. =]</p>

            <p>But you did raise an interesting question. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t have an issue with reading all those papers, but then again, I&#39;m going into English and linguistics have always interested me. In the meantime, I&#39;m not going to refrain from using Elvish. It seems to me that it&#39;s very unfair for them to make us wait.

            <p>... I just don&#39;t think I&#39;d <i>understand</i> them, or be able to construct a model of (any stage of) the language as a whole from it. Still, though, I do plan to by the collected back-issues of <i>Vinyar Tengwar</i> when I have the cash on hand.<br><br>I think part of the difference is that the ELF view Tolkien&#39;s works as a process, which only ended because he inconsiderately died. And that&#39;s true... but to me, at least, Middle-earth - Arda - <i>Eд</i> - is a world with a concrete (if fictional) existence. The ELF way of looking at things is the same as the viewpoint that claims there can be no &#39;canon&#39; of the First and Second Ages - that the only sections of the world that have a solid history are those covered in <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.<br><br>But I don&#39;t accept that. While doubtless Tolkien would have changed things further had he had more time - he didn&#39;t. And for those of us who treat Middle-earth as a &#39;real&#39; world, it has to have an actual history. There <i>is</i> a concrete timeline of the First Age - even if we don&#39;t know it. Equally, there <i>is</i> a Third Age Exilic Quenya - even if Tolkien never finalised one. The ELF study <i>Tolkien&#39;s</i> work as he invented and modified his languages; Ardalambion tries to look at the way the people of <i>Middle-earth</i> spoke. The earlier stages of the linguistic development are as irrelevant to that goal as the tale of Beren the elf, his love Tinъviel, and Telvido the Prince of Cats, is to looking at the life of Luthien of Doriath.<br><br>hS</p>

In order to figure out what to do with history and languages, I pretend like Middle-earth (and other fictional places) is real and view it the same way I would view, say, Germany. There are very limited reasons for knowing pre-Middle-Ages German. There <i>are</i> reasons, but being able to speak current German is not really one of them.</p>

            <p>For smut, it is really well-done.  And unless I&#39;m guessing wrong, this guy knows the canon as well as some of the Tolkien fans here.<br><br>Here are things where I don&#39;t know if they are canon or not.<br><br>It says that Elves have &quot;light&quot; and Elrond is surprised when he finds orcs that have it.  He does some sort of telepathy involving the inner light.<br><br>It is acknowledged that Elrond is married and has children.  It looks like he does the fade out of pining for Arog when his wife has been gone for longer.

            <p>I think whoever wrote this should not be left alone with an owl ever. In chapter 3 the author has Harry read some stuff out about Owl&#39;s eggs that I&#39;ve personally never heard before, and after a quick check on the internet, the internet hasn&#39;t heard of before as well. And added to the fact that I don&#39;t believe that Snowy Owls mate with anything besides Snowy Owls, and for that matter I don&#39;t think Great Grey Owls and Barn Owls mate either.<br><br>Like Iximaz said, owls are birds not mammals, so no and certainly not, if they did that in the wild they&#39;d probably die from lack of food. They lay their eggs (normally between 32 and 11) every other day over a period of several days so definitely not all at once.   <br><br>I err stopped reading soon after Chapter 3, so I kinda hope it doesn&#39;t get worse from there. <br><br>Storme Hawk  </p>

            <p>Owls <i>are</i> the only species of bird - or at least one of the only <i>documented</i> bird species - that mate more than strictly necessary for procreation.

            <p>Well, technically &#39;Canadian bacon&#39; exists in Britain (isn&#39;t Hogwarts in Scotland?), but... not under that name! :D Wikipedia suggests it&#39;s either back bacon - ie, bacon rashers, or normally just, uh, bacon - or smoked ham - which would probably just be ham.

There has been no indication of &#39;calls&#39; being transferred, because in all these cases it was not necessary or even had to be avoided to keep the secret. So, if it is possible to transfer &#39;calls&#39;, we wouldn’t know. I didn’t look into the &#39;fic to see whether it is done convincingly for a plausible reason, but considering how bureaucracy works, it wouldn’t be too far a stretch to assume that it does work like that in certain places like the Ministry. And if it’s sufficiently funny, it doesn’t even need to be reasonable; it certainly doesn’t contradict canon.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Oh man, that real-person fic.  The idea sounds delicious, but it has the earmarks of no imagination.
