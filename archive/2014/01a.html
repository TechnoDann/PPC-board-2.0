            <p>I read an article today about the use of the f-word in modern culture (which you too can read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/09/opinion/clark-f-word-everywhere/index.html?hpt=hp_t4">here</a> -- don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s censored). That, combined with a note from one of my betas in my last story about how nice it was to see agents use real-life curses, got me thinking about how the PPC approaches the concept of &#39;mature language.&#39;<br><br>Whenever I see someone use &#39;Flaming Denethor&#39; or &#39;Radagast on a bunny sled&#39; in a mission, I always have to pause and think about the usage for a moment. Is the character saying this because it&#39;s something that the character would actually say, or is it for some other reason? Maybe the author doesn&#39;t like swearing. Maybe they just think the phrase is funny. (It also makes me think the character is briefly channeling Hermes from <i>Futurama</i>: &#39;Sweet somethin&#39; of some place!&#39;) Those aren&#39;t wrong or bad reasons to use creative curses, but it should be something you think about.<br><br>I&#39;ve always been of the mindset that dialogue is an important tool in characterization. Does a character use formal or casual words? Do they use elements of a specific dialect, or even a few bits of a foreign language? Do they speak in a way that would be considered grammatically acceptable if written down? And most pertinent to this subject, do they swear? If so, how and in what situations? Is it something they save for the most dire of situations or are they like drunken sailors on shore leave?<br><br>Those who have read my stories might notice that my agents don&#39;t shy away from the occasional curse. Laura&#39;s probably the most regular offender, what with her being a hyperaggressive and hypercompetative gamer-type. However, because she&#39;s also a bit of nerd, she&#39;ll occasionally use referential substitutions in place of swear words: &#39;Jeebus&#39; in place of &#39;Jesus,&#39; for example.<br><br>On the flip side of that, Xericka has cursed maybe once (in her first mission, as I recall; I was still struggling with her character at that point). Swearing is obviously not  apart of her character. That means that, if and when I do have Xericka drop an f-bomb, the audience will immediately know that the midden has hit the windmill.<br><br>But what does everyone else think? Do your characters swear, or do they stick strictly to self-bowdlerization? Why do they swear/not swear? Does swearing even have a place in the PPC? Am I just talking a load of tosh and nonsense? Color me curious.</p>

            <p>...only one of my agents is actually from World One, and he doesn&#39;t swear a lot unless necessary and/or under great stress, and even then, it&#39;s usually more like &#39;damn&#39; or similar mild curses. Lee, on the other hand, tends to call on the gods from her home continuum; Orion is from the <i>Harry Potter</i> &#39;verse, and uses curses appropriate to there, and Agents Mal are from the <i>Stargate SG-1</i> &#39;verse, and tend to swear in Goa&#39;uld, as they&#39;re Tok&#39;ra.<br><br>Personally, I tend to avoid naming a specific curse all together and just say &#39;he swore sharply&#39; or, &#39;she swore under her breath&#39;. It&#39;s easier and, while it&#39;s not as bombastic, tends to make my writing flow easier.<br><br>Speaking of writing... I really need to finish my next mission. It&#39;s been, oh, almost two years since my last one? I should get better about that... </p>

            <p>(Hi people, I was the beta who liked actual swearing being used. :P)<br><br>Swearing seems to be a no-no in the PPC in general; strong language gets you automatically kicked from the IRC, and the Constitution has this to say:<br><br><i>&quot;...[N]o cursing, no graphic violence, sex or whatever.&quot;</i>&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s noted that this is to keep the community worksafe and family-friendly, and to be fair the Constitution goes on to note that if a story has such content there should be a fair warning (as opposed to, say, a flat-out ban on any such content), but I think it illustrates why we take the approach we do, with fandom-based cursing (though as pointed out by other posters, if a character&#39;s actually from that continuum it makes a lot more sense they&#39;d use those words, then you have cultural factors, etc. etc. :P) and Creative Curses and the like. <br><br>I&#39;m of two minds about this - much like excessively gory violence or explicit smut a) isn&#39;t really something most in the PPC want to write and b) sure as heck isn&#39;t something a reader wants flung at them without any kind of warning or way to know it&#39;s coming, gratuitous language comes off as childish and tiresome, and I&#39;m sure nobody here&#39;s interested in the extreme approach, where f-bombs, s-strikes and various slurs are tossed around seemingly every other word. On the other hand, when people talk, swearing is a thing that happens, and there&#39;s not much use acting like that&#39;s not the case - and in particular, I&#39;ve honestly never liked our &quot;Creative Curses&quot;. Not only do they come off as overly cutesy, convoluted and euphemistic, not one of them (except &quot;Flaming Denethor&quot; maybe, but who really wouldn&#39;t just say something more conventional in that kind of context? Also, it sounds more like a drink, one I&#39;m pretty sure is actually served in one of HQ&#39;s bars...) strike me as something anybody would ever actually say - sure, a lot of dialogue writing doesn&#39;t perfectly match how people talk in reality, but trying to picture someone blurting out &quot;Jadis in a block of ice!&quot; or &quot;Reinforce Eins (?) in a sweater!&quot; every time they&#39;re surprised by something takes me right out of the story. I mean, try it out - try saying &quot;Glaurung!&quot; or &quot;Flaming Denethor!&quot; or one of the others right now like you&#39;re angry or startled, I bet you sound foolish (no offence) and don&#39;t have as much impact as using something stronger.<br><br>Okay, that was a big paragraph about fictional cursing, I swear it doesn&#39;t actually get me that worked up. :P Obviously it&#39;s all down to character and how they would talk, I think we&#39;d all kinda eyebrow if the SO started talking like a drunken sailor for example, but I kinda feel like if it&#39;s a situation where the writer feels language would be warranted from the person swearing they should at least not shy away from it - of course, if silly and euphemistic is what you&#39;re going for, go nuts, and like I said it should fit who they are and where they&#39;re from, but still.<br><br>As for the last part of the question... I&#39;m actually gonna have to think on that, I have so many agents and concepts drawn up I&#39;m sorta losing track. Most of mine are from various periods in World One and use the according language, though from mine in other continua they stick mostly with the vernacular from their homeworlds of course (one big Star Wars fan in my bunch likes to use swearing from the GFFA though - mostly nondescript Mando&#39;a or Huttese or stuff like &quot;kriff&quot;, and I&#39;m writing a Firefly mission with people who might stick with the tradition of censor-dodging via Chinese). Most of them don&#39;t swear particularly often though, either due to being too formal, not being easily moved to cursing, or just a sorta general affable and not-easily-roused demeanour, though in my last mission (Jeez, that was three years ago now...) Miriam did cut loose a good bit and called the Sue a bitch a few times; a lot of that was freaking out over how the continuum had been twisted around so much it literally began tearing itself apart under the strain put on by the Sue, though. I might have to get back to that part of the post with something more concrete.</p>

            <p>My agents, when I was younger, didn&#39;t swear as much as they do now, because I didn&#39;t have the potty mouth that I have now. Since they were doing missions in the Battlestar Galactica fandom, they (mostly Christianne) used &#39;frak&#39; a lot. <br><br>Christianne has since then fallen into using the f-word instead, along with lots of blasphemy, a couple fecal-related swears, and a couple creative PPC-esque curses as well. Sometimes her cursing varies between the fandoms she&#39;s missioning for, other times it&#39;s indiscriminate. However, I believe she&#39;s dropped plenty of f-bombs in her recent missions.<br><br>Eledhwen on the other hand uses Middle-earth-inspired swears, which I&#39;m assuming she got from OFUM, because Elves don&#39;t swear, and definitely don&#39;t use the Valar&#39;s names in vain. Eledhwen has quite blatantly done that several times (&quot;Elbereth&#39;s stars&quot;, &quot;Nienna&#39;s tears&quot;, &quot;Yavanna&#39;s fruits&quot;, etc). Logically she should be using the Sindarin names, but I slip up often because I&#39;m silly and forget to do my research, but yeah.<br><br>Both of my agents seem to curse when they&#39;re frustrated or angry, so they&#39;re not exactly sailors, though Christianne is definitely more on the sailor side of things when it comes to the frequency of swears.<br><br>And on an somewhat-related note, Sherlock Holmes in Consulting Sue Slayer uses curses derived from scientists (&quot;Darwin on a beagle&quot;, &quot;oh for the love of Rosalind Franklin&quot;, etc), and Yuki Sulu in my Star Trek writer!AU substitutes &#39;science&#39; for &#39;god&#39; (&quot;oh for the love of science&quot;, &quot;I swear to science&quot;, etc). I think you can tell what they do for a living.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t swear a whole lot in real life, and that does tend to carry into my writing.  Swearing isn&#39;t the way I communicate, or even think to myself, so swear words aren&#39;t really in my immediate conscious thesaurus when I write.  I&#39;ll use the <i> really</i> PG stuff--crap, damn and hell--when I feel swearing is called for, because it still gets the point across to the reader, I think.  In real life, I do say, &quot;Nine hells,&quot; sometimes, which I picked up from reading <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> novels, but that&#39;s a pretty Dominaria-specific phrase, so it wouldn&#39;t make sense for my current agents to use it.<br><br>I do like using and reading the continuum-specific oaths, as well as our creative curses.  After all, one of the major aspects of the PPC is the multiversal travel.  Using language from the various &quot;fictional&quot; worlds is practically part of the setting.  We have a majorly polyglot set of characters, and it would be odd and dull if all the dwarves and trolls and wizards and aliens and ninjas and pirates and anthropomorphic animals swore in the exact same language as the Earthish humans.<br></p>

            <p>Eusabius doesn&#39;t swear because he is generally a rather mellow guy that can be fazed by almost nothing. Florestan, on the other hand, has no such inhibitions. Wave Crest... I&#39;ve decided that&#39;s a no for him, owing to his nature as a Technicolor pony.<br><br>For my now-DMS response center... Xanthus occasionally curses, Anneli uses the type of curse that a high school cheerleader might, and Cindy doesn&#39;t really swear, and when she does it&#39;s not &quot;words you can&#39;t say on TV&quot; swearing.

            <p>Interesting questions!

Nume is both the most likely to swear and the most likely to use real-life curses. He&#39;s from World One (or perhaps a close relative where things like eidetic memories are both real and not utterly crippling), and he has an unwanted religious background, so most of the time he&#39;s happy blaspheming (Jesus Christ, god dammit, oh hell, etc.). He&#39;s also been known to say &quot;frell,&quot; especially in my earlier missions, but nowadays I feel like substitutes like that are too coy for him. He escalates to s**t and f**k when things get serious.<br><br>2. Ilraen doesn&#39;t swear. He has a much less excitable, more pleasant demeanor than his partner, and he&#39;s extremely literal-minded. He understands idioms and figurative language most of the time now, and he can use them if he works at it, but they&#39;re never the first thing that comes to his mind.<br><br>3. Derik is from Pern, so he swears like a Pernese person. They don&#39;t have religion, and they&#39;re not bothered about sex, so most of their curses revolve around Thread and dragons. The most popular curse is either &quot;shards&quot; or &quot;shells,&quot; both of which refer to damaged dragon eggs. There&#39;s also &quot;scorch it,&quot; &quot;by the First Egg / my dragon&#39;s egg,&quot; &quot;crackdust,&quot; &quot;shaffit,&quot; and, if you&#39;re being mild and don&#39;t mind sounding a bit silly, &quot;fardles.&quot;<br><br>4. Gall is more likely to sling insults than to swear (she prefers to blame anything bad that happens to her on someone she can hit), and being from a family film based on kids&#39; books, her language is probably rated PG-13 at worst, but she does use familiar swearwords. The HtTYD Vikings occasionally swear by the Norse gods in the film (&quot;by Odin&#39;s beard&quot; IIRC), so there&#39;s that, too.<br><br>5. Jenni&#39;s use of swearwords is the most eclectic. She doesn&#39;t use four-letter words much, if ever, but being a multiverse-traveler, she has picked up expressions from various continua. She&#39;s fond of the Pernese set and &quot;frell&quot; and its relatives, and it wouldn&#39;t be out of the question for her to drop a &quot;Flaming Denethor!&quot; She avoids religious language, but I think a generic &quot;oh, god&quot; or &quot;what the hell&quot; slips in every so often, and she does swear by the Powers That Be (&quot;by the Powers,&quot; &quot;sweet Powers,&quot; etc.). Whether she&#39;s referring to a particular set or simply any that might be listening probably depends on the circumstances. She might also use &quot;son of a bitch!&quot; and such, but it would have to be pretty serious for her to get insulting. The worst curse I can think of for her to say would be &quot;a plague on it / plague it,&quot; and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever actually happened.<br><br>On a general note, one thing that drives me nuts about &quot;creative&quot; curses is when people just switch out &quot;god&quot; and switch in the local deity or equivalent, because it&#39;s not all that clever and it rarely makes sense. Nobody in Middle-earth would ever say &quot;Oh my Eru,&quot; for instance; in Narnia they say &quot;by the Lion&#39;s mane,&quot; not &quot;Oh my Aslan.&quot; I can give it a pass if it&#39;s a fan doing it to show their fandom, but never a native of the continuum. Aside from such curses being non-canon, they bug me because they involve an assumption that other cultures would develop the exact same formula for cursing as us. Maybe in some cases they would, but there&#39;s no reason they <i>should</i>. It&#39;s something that should be considered carefully, not tossed in just because you <s>think you</s> need someone to swear.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I once saw a badfic that had Lupin swear by Merlin as though he was God. &quot;Oh my Merlin&quot;, to be exact. I was... perplexed, to say the least. The World One equivalent would be, I guess, &quot;Oh my Aba Kovner&quot; or something.</p>

            <p>In the Potterverse, while people do swear by Merlin...no one <i>ever</i> says &quot;Oh my Merlin!&quot; They will occasionally use &#39;Merlin&#39; in a sentence rather the way World One natives might use &#39;God&#39; (&quot;Merlin, Remus, are you still hung up over that?&quot;*), but more often, the use...well, it goes more like this:<br><br>&#39;Merlin&#39;s beard!&#39; (very popular)<br>&#39;Merlin&#39;s pants!&#39;<br>And, once, &#39;Merlin&#39;s most baggy Y-fronts!&#39;<br><br>Basically, wizards and witches tend to swear by pretty much anything of Merlin&#39;s they can think of. Poor wizard; if one were to cross HP with the BBC&#39;s <i>Merlin</i>...well, Arthur would never let him forget it, that&#39;s for sure.<br><br>Of course, there is the Very Potter Musicals&#39; &#39;Oh my Rowling!&quot;, but that&#39;s another story.<br><br>Also, for context, in the Potterverse, Merlin lived...I think even before the Founders of Hogwarts, so more than 1000 years ago, and was very famous and did rather a lot for magic and magical society (as I recall). It&#39;s a little more like swearing by Jesus, I suppose, just...without much sense of reverence.<br><br>~DF<br><br>--<br>*Not a real quote, just making things up.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m confused. From all I know about World One legends, if Merlin was a historical person he should have lived near the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasion (about 500 A.D.), but I don&#39;t remember anything in the books saying <b>when</b> Merlin lived.<br><br>On Pottermore, the Slytherin prefect claimed in her welcome speach that Merlin was a Slytherin. This seems only possible if either Hogwarts is much older than thousand years or Potterverse Merlin lived later than we assume.<br><br>Or it may be a hint that we shouldn&#39;t trust everything this  prefect said.<br><br>PPC-relevant question: Are the prefects&#39; welcome speaches canon? Apparently they were not explicitly marked as &quot;New from J.K. Rowling&quot;, nobody was supposed to see the welcome speaches for the houses he was not sorted into, and with the new design the Sorting process may have been changed so that I don&#39;t even know how to access these things anymore.<br><br>So the answer would be &quot;no&quot; and I shouldn&#39;t even have asked?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Anebrin had some generic Wesnoth!elf euphemisms, such as &quot;by all that is green&quot;, &quot;by Lintanir&quot; and the like. However, it&#39;s rather unlike him to actually swear.<br>Des swears a lot. However, most of the swears are sorta self-censored - he mostly swears in Hebrew because of obvious reasons. IIRC, there&#39;s also an instance of &quot;Reinforce Zwei in a box&quot; (a variation on &quot;Reinforce Eins in a sweater&quot;) somewhere in what I wrote, due to him being really influenced by <i>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</i>.<br>And the Librarian... does not swear.

            <p>My Agents usually use rather mild language, so there isn&#39;t much need for curses.<br><br>They do use some of the &quot;creative curses&quot;, though - however, that&#39;s mainly to replace religion-related ones with ones actually fitting with them: Nikki and Corolla are Madokaists (AKA worshippers of Madoka Kaname from Puella Magi Madoka Magica), while Sergio is more of an atheist (he does respect Madoka and all, but thinks that worshipping her is a bit excessive. Also because she is more of a concept than a proper goddess).<br><br>As a result, we see a lot of &quot;for Madoka&#39;s sake&quot; or, due to Corolla being from Lyrical Nanoha, &quot;holy Reinforce Eins in a sweater&quot;. About &quot;regular&quot; ones, they don&#39;t get more swearish that &quot;what the hell&quot;.<br><br>You might see some heavier swearing in Blank Sprite, but if it happens that&#39;s because the situation calls for it.</p>

            <p>Found out about PPC when a review on Fanfiction.net mentioned it. Ive read a bunch of missions and they are real knee slappers. I am currently writing three fanfics, I havent made much progress with them yet, so I cant say if they are any good or not. My favorite fanons include Naruto, Doctor Who, and Total Drama. Total Drama in particular has been very over looked, (Some please get on The Death of Nick ASAP, it makes My Immortal look like child&#39;s play). Hope I get a friendly welcome!</p>

            <p>would be the New Series episode Blink (S3, E10), because one, it follows around a couple of people who also don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, and two, it&#39;s really, really well written. My Classic start-point would be Remembrance of the Daleks (S25, E1), but I think that&#39;s just &#39;cause I like it a lot. Really a lot. You can really start anywhere, though, except maybe Romana&#39;s first season (S16) because of the Key To Time arc, and the whole Trial of a Time Lord thing (S23) because it&#39;s just confusing. <br><br>Ta!<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>Hello. I am mudkip77, having just made this account to post this. As of late (beginning in September 5th) one of my closest friends has embarked on the noble journey that is trying to write a decent Touhou fanfic.<br><br>I would like to say that he is doing well, which he somewhat is. In total, there are roughly 175K words at the time of this writing. However, despite his watching the series &quot;Diamond in the Rough&quot; (a similar concept to the PPC that brutally deconstructs Touhou-specific Mary Sues) careful study of the Sue phenomenon, and of course our constant supervision of the fic, I&#39;m concerned he may be drifting closer to the Sue Event Horizon and shows few signs of stopping.<br><br>This is beginning to worry me. He is a very spontaneous person and has minimal care for protocol and anti-badfic measures. At most, he gives it lip service. At worst, he might be completely ignoring it. Both of us have performed the Litmus Test, but I&#39;m afraid that because we both played a part in the character&#39;s creations, we have a slanted view of his traits and are heavily biased when testing.<br><br>My result from testing was 27, his was 21. We used the universal tester as well as the de-Sueifier to perform the test.<br><br>The fic in question is &quot;Boundless World of Danmaku&quot;, hosted on FF.net and co-written by  me and &quot;Terrarian Creeper&quot;, his favoured alias, on the same account. If you were to PM him and ask for his Muse, I might be able to answer.<br><br>If anyone reading this could also go read through his fanfic (and preferably not tell him of this), it would be greatly appreciated. If I wasted your time posting this or have broken any rules posting this, my apologies. I simply needed to try and get this out onto a dedicated anti-Sue site as quickly as possible.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>The link is:<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9663412/1/Boundless-World-of-Danmaku"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9663412/1/Boundless-World-of-Danmaku">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9663412/1/Boundless-World-of-Danmaku</a></a></p>

            <p>Remember that the key defining characteristic of a true Sue/Stu is that the entire universe/narrative revolves around them, that everyone pretty much exists for them. They stay firmly planted in the spotlight and even when they stray from it, everyone else can&#39;t stop talking about them or doing things in relation to them. Their strengths can vary, but their flaws will usually be brushed off even if, realistically, the other characters would not be so permissive. Hell, the flaws just serve to make them cooler/cuter/HAWTter/etc.<br><br>Not sure if it helps much, but maybe that can help you in analyzing your friend&#39;s character.</p>

            <p>I firmly believe in something called a Sue Event Horizon, much like a black hole&#39;s even horizon - when an OC crosses that boundary, there&#39;s no going back. I&#39;m quite confident that my friend has yet to cross the line yet, but he&#39;s approaching. Initially, he was very awkward with his writing, and while it IS improving, he&#39;s also begun to slip in his self-checks. It&#39;s entirely possible he eventually starts lying to himself and SOON, which would send him past the Sue Horizon and I&#39;d need to terminate the fic when it became a badfic and it&#39;d be messy all around. I&#39;ve had to do it before... it wasn&#39;t pleasant.<br><br>All in all, his OC isn&#39;t quite a Sue yet, though I think he might be getting too close to that line for comfort. That&#39;s why I tried to see if any Touhou fans here could possibly read the fic and see if it&#39;s beginning to waver too much in his favour.<br><br>In effect, the fic is split up into halves at the moment; a war waged by most of the canon characters in their home territory, and the OC himself and some of the main characters working to defeat the one who started the war. It doesn&#39;t SEEM like a Sue birthplace, but the main perspective is told from the OC&#39;s point of view, which leaves us confused as to whether or not it counts as keeping them in the spotlight for too long. The two stories are somewhat separate, though I&#39;m expecting to converge soon.<br><br>As a side note, we&#39;ve set the OC up for a fall with a very, very painful impact. By the usual characteristic of a Sue, this shouldn&#39;t add to it (hopefully), though we&#39;re slated towards setting him up as a second story villain. My friend isn&#39;t too happy, but he should survive... Maybe they shouldn&#39;t forgive him. Would this be too brutal?<br><br>Last note, sorry about the wall of text.</p>

            <p>Though really, anyone with a decent (maybe even less) grasp of the fandom and hopefully a Bachelor&#39;s in Anti-Sue would do. I&#39;m not entirely sure if I should have come here or to the Sue Elimination Society, but I don&#39;t quite think he&#39;s reached the point the OC needs to be removed. That&#39;s why I posted it here.<br><br>If someone could read through it and perhaps give a critique on the Sue standing of his OC, it would certainly help to improve our work.</p>

            <p>Both Steve Irwin and Huinesoron? hS, why didn&#39;t you tell anyone that you saved Steve Irwin from his impending death and took him with you on an essay-wrangling journey after spreading the story that he&#39;d been killed by a stingray? Oh, right, so that the information that a well-known nature authority had been taken from his native time stream wouldn&#39;t potentially spark a causal chain reaction. Seems a bit obvious in retrospect.<br>Well, now that wobbletheclown has revealed some temporal spoilers, at least the two of you know not to go after any links that show manta-like characteristics. Just to be safe, I&#39;d recommend not going after essays resembling any cartilaginous fish whatsoever. Except sharks. Mantas look and act nothing like sharks.</p>

            <p>&quot;They&quot; and the relevant conjugations have long been recognised as valid for use as singular pronouns when the speaker is unsure of the subject&#39;s gender; indeed, the people who protest about such &#39;errors&#39; are often the type who bang on about &#39;men&#39;s rights&#39; and &#39;equalism over feminism&#39; and other such tawdry examples of Comprehensively Not Bloody Getting It. I&#39;ve been on the receiving end of a lot of this stuff; I know of what I speak. What I <i>don&#39;t</i> know is Huinesoron&#39;s gender, not being either a telepath, a wizard, or the boarder themselves. I&#39;ve not been in a position to ask. Have you?<br><br>--parp</p>

            <p>I know all about the use of the singular &quot;their&quot;. I&#39;ve actually often wondered why more people don&#39;t consider it valid, since it&#39;s the best non-gender-specific personal pronoun the English language has due to its absence of an &quot;official&quot; neutral indicator. It just looked from context as though you were referring to multiple people, since referring to only the Boarder and not the nature expert might have used Huinesoron&#39;s Board name in place of the unknown pronoun to deal with potential confusion. Or at least it would when I type it, because I&#39;m self-conscious about that sort of thing.<br><br>Also, my response might have been influenced by my opinion that Steve Irwin going on time-traveling adventures would be hilarious. Perhaps he was a companion of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=248081;search_term=the+alchemist">The Alchemist</a>, Huinesoron&#39;s Time Lord cross-canon counterpart.</p>

            <p>Sorry for parting ways with the old handle. It&#39;s been a bit of a trying day, and I get it in the neck for using gender-neutral pronouns all the damned time.

            <p>I just get so unreasonably angry these days, particularly over things like pronoun use. It&#39;s a character flaw.<br><br>I know what Outhra said was most likely meant as a joke, but I also know a lot of people who&#39;d say it and <i>not</i> have it be a joke, hence the shouting.

            <p>Admittedly, I&#39;m not sure who either of those people are(though Google tells me that at least one of them may have been a German philosopher), but I got the gist of what you meant. Bad day, undesirable situations, small seemingly innocuous comments acting as emotional triggers, etcetera. Sorry for prompting emotional discord. Here, since I missed your newbie thread and never got to give you a gift before, have a round ray. They&#39;re like stingrays, but without the stingers, so there&#39;s no risk of my gift accidentally killing time-displaced Steve Irwin. And this one is a female, so there&#39;s no confusion over her gender.</p>

            <p>A quick search tells me that &quot;absquatulated&quot; is synonymous with the more common words &quot;fled&quot; and &quot;absconded&quot;, which means that the essay has apparently noticed us coming and has escaped to the misty back hills of the Internet.

            <p>EUCH! I tried some Italian soda (proper Italian soda, mind you, not that flavored club soda we Americans make in their name) and it was bitter as all heck.

            <p>So maybe the bright orange color was linked to that, related to the orange colors of rust and other ferrous materials.

            <p>I clearly have much to learn in the ways of slang. I assume &quot;spine-vacuum&quot; would be roughly synonymous with the term &quot;wimp&quot;, due to the typical use of the spine metaphorically to describe one&#39;s confidence and gusto, but the word &quot;greeting&quot; used as a derogatory adjective and the comparison of someone to a &quot;newborn barn&quot; are alien to me. Maybe &quot;bairn&quot; would have meant a different word once translated out of Over-the-Top Scottish Accent, but I&#39;m not sure. Elaborate?</p>

            <p>I think that this thread is seriously awesome and filled with great advice for anyone who would want to do a Tenth Walker. Would anyone mind terribly, if I took it upon myself to compile all the thoughts and advice (giving proper credit, of course) into a &#39;Tenth Walker in goodfic&#39; section on the Tenth Walker wiki page?</p>

            <p>And it&#39;s a regrettably common one: the Fifth Hobbit.<br><br>The problems with this character - for the sake of this post, let&#39;s assume she&#39;s a female named Calanthe (it&#39;s a type of orchid) - are... well, several:<br><br>1/ She has no special skills, knowledge, or hangups, or at least no plausible backstory to give her them. Like the four canonical hobbits, she&#39;s... well, she&#39;s a hobbit! They don&#39;t <i>have</i> useful skills. Yes, she can learn things - but they&#39;re the same things the canon ones do. This means that, unlike, say, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9998481/3/Tenth-Walkers">Snaga</a>, she can&#39;t alter the course of the story when the Fellowship are all together. Like Merry and Pippin, she&#39;s just a tagalong at that point.<br><br>2/ She actually <i>can</i> change the story - but only by making things go wrong. Yes, she could get stabbed by a Nazgul, kidnapped by Moria Orcs, trapped by a Balrog - but how much do we hate a character who exists only to be clumsy and force everyone to pay attention to her? Very. Very much.<br><br>3/ After the Breaking of the Fellowship, she has three possible directions to go: she could tag along with Frodo, get captured with M&amp;P, or stay behind with the Three Hunters. But...<br><br>3a/ The Three Hunters would never be able to catch the orcs if they had to drag a hobbit along with them, and anyway, we know that the hobbits all ran off to look for Frodo without waiting to plan. If you make Calanthe &#39;the only sensible hobbit&#39;, well, that&#39;s pushing her towards Suedom.<br><br>3b/ If she goes with Frodo (presumably by following Sam), then... well, again she could make things go wrong (Nazgul sees her, orcs capture her, Gollum sees her and doesn&#39;t get caught), but like I said, we hate that. After that... the only point I can see where she could make a difference other than doing something stupid is in helping Sam save Frodo from Shelob. And the result of that? Er... they either finish the Quest a day or so earlier, or they wander out into the massive orc encampment on Gorgoroth. Yes, you could write a story around that - but it&#39;s a lot of setup that you could skip over just by having Sam not get lost in the tunnel/turned back by Gollum.<br><br>3c/ She could go with M&amp;P. There is <i>one</i> possible story here: one where Grishnбkh takes her from Uglъk and manages to get her over the River. But the only way I can see that going is &#39;Calanthe is taken to Barad-dыr; Calanthe is tortured; Calanthe reveals that they&#39;re trying to destroy the Ring; Sauron kills everyone&#39;.<br><br>3d/ But if that doesn&#39;t happen? When&#39;s the next time M&amp;P do anything to affect the plot? They persuade Treebeard to call an Entmoot (as a team, and Calanthe wouldn&#39;t add anything to that), and then... hmm. Well, Pippin eventually helps save Faramir from Denethor&#39;s madness, and Merry even more eventually helps kill the Witch-King.<br><br>The problem is, M&amp;P serve a specific role in the story, and it&#39;s not to drive the plot: they&#39;re there to give us a viewpoint. We know about the city of Minas Tirith because we follow Pippin on his tour. We know about Eowyn&#39;s bravery because Merry tags along with her. But... Gondor and Rohan are the two kingdoms we need to see. What observer role can Calanthe take that would shed new light on the War of the Ring? I can&#39;t come up with one that she could actually get to.<br><br>In fact, the <i>only</i> possibility I can think of for captured Calanthe is (apart from the torture scenario) for her to try and sneak into Orthanc after the Ents attack. We know Saruman still had ways to communicate to the outside, so there must be a secret tunnel somewhere. But I can&#39;t come up with a <i>reason</i> for her to do so - except to look in the Palantir earlier, and thereby call down a Nazgul on the Ents&#39; heads. I can&#39;t find a story there, either.<br><br>So, a challenge to everyone, from the person who&#39;s been <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9998481/1/Tenth-Walkers">proving it can be done</a>: find a story which relies on the presence of a Fifth Hobbit Tenth Walker. You can use Calanthe, or make your own Shire, Buckland or Bree hobbit for the purpose, with appropriate skills. Just please - <i>find</i> something. It&#39;s bugging me.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>One: play it completely for laughs. The culture shock, the meta aspects, whatever. Hell, you could and should pick someone patently unsuited to the task, like a children&#39;s party entertainer-<br><br>Oh, that&#39;s brilliant! Send Derren Brown or Dynamo or whoever tumbling out of the sky and, since he&#39;d describe himself as a magician, have people think he&#39;s some sort of sixth Istar! That&#39;d be perfect; him running around trying to keep up the disguise of a mighty Wizard while a quest to save the world hangs in the balance... there&#39;s potential in that.<br><br>The other option is that you do a much darker story. For example, let&#39;s have a weapons historian transported to Middle-Earth. One who specialises in the history of firearms. The resultant escalation of conflict becomes a lot more interesting when you consider that they don&#39;t necessarily have to land in the West.<br><br>I personally like this conceit because when it comes to early firearms, in a lot of respects bows are better. They&#39;re more accurate, faster to fire and reload, and they don&#39;t nearly break your shoulder when you try and use them. However, guns are much better at piercing armour and can absolutely destroy a cavalry charge if you allow socket bayonets to be a thing. Iunno, maybe it&#39;s just me, but I <i>really</i> like the idea of Faramir conducting the defence of Osgiliath with the addition of early blackpowder weaponry.<br><br>Maybe that strays more into another type of fic - the &quot;gun porn in an ostensibly fantasy world&quot; fic. They&#39;re bloody difficult to do right, but as with anything, the good stuff is really good. =o]<br><br>--parp</p>

            <p>They are capable of machinery, such as crossbows, siege engines, and others. In fact, Tolkien envisions that we learn mechanical engineering from the Orcs.

            <p>Early firearms do blow up if they aren&#39;t maintained properly - and I would not trust an Orc, no matter how smart, to maintain them in the correct manner. This is at least in part because you need good quality metal for gun barrels, and orcish smithies produce a lot of cheap metal... with the structural integrity of a wet paper towel. This was sort of Tolkien&#39;s <i>point</i> regarding them; that mass-production was never going to be as fit for purpose as small-batch craftsmanship, thus serving the greater point that the modern world was fundamentally inferior to the Britain that had gone before.</p>

            <p>From the very beginning, with the Fall of Gondolin in 1917, Tolkien drew a very clear link between orcish inventions (or at least, Melkor&#39;s) and the weapons of the First World War. Gondolin falls to dragons built like tanks - of metal plate. The Fall of Gondolin, in many ways, is Tolkien&#39;s way of getting the Somme out of his head.<br><br>And yes, Tolkien is clear that Orc-like machinery is a bad thing - but not that it doesn&#39;t work. Saruman&#39;s recreation of Isengard doesn&#39;t fail because his waterwheels fell apart and his gunpowder (used to destroy the Deeping Wall in the assault on the Hornburg) blew itself up - he fails because the forces of nature wake up and stop him.<br><br>Seriously, we <i>know</i> orcs had decent weapons - they managed to destroy multiple elven kingdoms with them (including Eregion, a place made up seemingly entirely of smiths). They&#39;re not very <i>pretty</i> weapons - but Sauron has spent six thousand years leading various armies; he knows how valuable proper arms and armour are.<br><br>Could an orc invent a gun? Probably not. Could an orc maintain a handgun? I don&#39;t know - I&#39;m inclined to think they haven&#39;t the patience. Could an orc maintain, fire, and effectively deploy a <i>cannon</i>? I&#39;m going to say yes.<br><br>The next question is: can Numenorean &#39;unbreakable&#39; stonework hold up to cannon fire? [Ducks]<br><br>hS</p>

Damage, yes. Break, especially since these are (out of necessity) really early cannons we&#39;re talking about and they build mud walls to support the stonework? I&#39;m dubious.<br><br>Of course, it&#39;s all a bit moot if they develop case shot and strip the walls bare of Gondorian defenders. They&#39;re not a British army in a colonial theatre; they could probably win a battle against angry people with spears.</p>

            <p>(I don&#39;t have the books with me at work, so this is purely from memory.)<br><br>The Took family is the closest the Hobbits get to hereditary royalty, with their hammerlock on the office of Thain.  Presumably Pippin was the eldest male of his generation, since he ends up with that title.  What if Pippin&#39;s dad didn&#39;t want his son and heir charging off into the wilderness, and got a Shirrif (spelling?) to chase Pippin down?  Perhaps the problems that will eventually require the Scouring of the Shire are showing up as Frodo makes his plans to leave, and the Thain wants everyone in his family at home and preparing for trouble.<br><br>A Hobbit who starts off with actual combat training means it&#39;ll be a little harder for the other races to dismiss Hobbits ... which could be good or bad for the other four Hobbits.  And the Fellowship could certainly use another fighter.<br><br>On the other hand, once that hypothetical Shirrif catches up to Pippin, he&#39;s not going to simply join the Fellowship.  His job is to get this idiot kid back home.  You can&#39;t add a military force between the Shire and Rivendell to block the Hobbits&#39; return without either &quot;Sauron Wins&quot; or &quot;WHAT Shire?&quot;</p>

            <p>Elrond (or someone) points out that the road back west will be paradoxically <i>more</i> dangerous than heading back towards Mordor - because Sauron knows the Ring is in Rivendell, and knows that the only solution the elves have ever come up with to, like, anything is &#39;The Sea!&#39;. So have your Shirriff (<a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Robin_Smallburrow">Robin Smallburrow</a>, &#39;Cock Robin&#39;, maybe?) have to fight/evade a fair number of enemies getting to Rivendell - in fact, make that why he takes over a month to get there and only arrives after the Fellowship leaves.<br><br>Of course, the Shirriffs weren&#39;t exactly a fighting force, but you&#39;re right that it gives him a little more to work with. Plus, not having the Ring with him, he&#39;ll have a far easier time sneaking through the gauntlet - and a chance to develop a few fighting skills on the way.<br><br>And we know Thain Paladin II is the sort to think of it - he held Tookland against Saruman&#39;s ruffians, after all.

            <p>This is a problem I see with people having Eomer as a member of the Fellowship - it&#39;d be more expedient for Grima to send the king&#39;s son on the road to Rivendell and have the Third Marshall banished in the meantime.

            <p>Not much of one, but maybe you can make something of it: what about Fredegar Bolger, or someone like him? He didn&#39;t want to go along, but supposing he&#39;d been dragged along anyway, he could provide a dose of much-needed caution to his more reckless friends. &quot;No, wait, don&#39;t throw that stone down the spooky well!&quot; - &quot;Don&#39;t touch the mysterious shiny object!&quot; - and so forth.<br><br>Fredegar in particular being there may also mean there&#39;s no one staying behind in Crickhollow to keep up the ruse of Frodo&#39;s move there, which might have serious Nazgul-related repercussions. A fifth, less iron-willed hobbit might slow the company down somewhat, also, which would change the timeline—probably for the worse, but maybe not. Later, supposing he stays with Merry and the Rohirrim, maybe Eowyn can&#39;t manage taking two hobbits with her to war, so they stay behind in Rohan, and we find out what happens there. Maybe not much, but maybe something?<br><br>... That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.<br><br>On a related note, Phobos and I got to talking about alternative Fellowship members last night. I think you absolutely <i>need</i> Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, and Aragorn, but you can change out the rest (with the possible exception of Gimli, whose very particular outlook and expertise are quite important in Moria and Helm&#39;s Deep). For instance, what if Faramir carried the message to Rivendell like he wanted and Boromir stayed behind to do what he does best? Drawing from the movieverse, what if Thranduil sent his badass captain of the guards instead of his as-far-as-we-know only son and heir? What if the Dwarves of Erebor sent one of Bard&#39;s sons as their messenger? What if Elrond chose Elladan and Elrohir for the Elves, or perhaps in place of Merry and Pippin (leading to the two of them catching up with the group later a la your first scenario)?<br><br>I&#39;ve been enjoying this whole experiment, by the way. I finally caught up on all eight stories yesterday, and all I can say is great work! You&#39;re fighting the good fight for good fic here, and I salute you.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So, working off of that conversation, here are my picks for the Fellowship:<br><br><b>1) Frodo</b> - He will do it.  He will take the Ring to Mordor.<br><br><b>2) Sam</b> - You need someone to do the cooking, and just try getting rid of him.<br><br><b>3) Aragorn</b> - Extremely useful to have on a long journey through the wilderness.  Also good in a fight. I&#39;m sure the whole &quot;King-in-exile&quot; thing helps, too.<br><br><b>4) Gandalf the Grey</b> - Walking into Mordor? Better bring the big guns.<br><br><b>5) Gimli</b> - Useful in a fight.  Also, one never knows when one might need a Dwarf to toss.<br><br><b>6) Faramir</b> - Leave Boromir, doing what he does best, in Gondor.  Faramir is the better choice for this job.<br><br><b>7) Elrond</b> - I did say to bring the big guns, right?  Lore-master, healer, and badass; not to mention his personal investment in seeing the quest completed.  He can leave his house in the care of his children and Erestor.<br><br><b>8) Glorfindel</b> - For those complaining about a lack of blond elves, I have a much better option than Legolas.  Glorfindel has already saved Frodo once by that point, after all.  He is a consummate badass<br><br><b>9) Radagast the Brown</b> - One word: Reconnaissance.  Need to know where the Orcs are?  Send a bird to check.  Talk to a local burrowing creature to find out what&#39;s going on in Moria.  This guy might be reclusive, but he would be amazingly useful.<br><br>So there you go.  Two hobbits, two men, two wizards, two elves, and a dwarf.  Find me another able-bodied dwarf and you&#39;ve got a perfectly balanced party of ten walkers.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Since hS has given us some idea of what his Fellowship might do, I will share the story that Nesh and I came up with for my group.  I didn&#39;t have this at the time I made the Fellowship (which was supposed to be overpowered to the point of ridiculousness), but it actually seems to work, somewhat.<br><br>Book 1: Fellowship of the Ring<br><br>So, the purpose of the Fellowship setting out in the first place is not just about taking the Ring to Mordor.  It is also about holding Saruman responsible for his actions, which is why Radagast is involved at all.<br><br>So, the Fellowship goes straight for the Gap of Rohan and Radagast sends messages to Lуrien to secure Galadriel&#39;s aid.  The battle for Isengard begins.<br><br>Book 2: Tower of the White Hand<br><br>The battle for Isengard would be fought by Elves from the Golden Wood and Men of Rohan (Wormtongue would need to be dealt with at some point during the siege).  Gandalf and Radagast would need to get the Ents and Huorns to come to their aid, as well.  <br><br>Neshomeh made the point that the power of the One Ring might well make people more susceptible to the voice of Saruman, which makes him even more dangerous than he already is.  Adding to that, with at least three rings of power arrayed against him, Sauron is likely to send the Nazgыl on their fell beasts.  As an answer to the Nazgыl, Radagast secures the help of Gwaihir the Windlord, who sends some Eagles to fight them in the air.  Glorfindel, Gimli, and Aragorn lead the armies of Elves and Men against the Uruk-hai and Dunlendings.<br><br>The siege might end with the release of the river, but I think that it would likely require Gandalf and Radagast to confront Saruman directly.  In the end, he would be removed to Lothlуrien and kept under guard.  One of the interesting results of this, in my mind, would be Gandalf the Grey becoming Gandalf the White as he steps into the leadership role of the Wizards.  And more interesting than that is the ascension of Radagast the Brown to Radagast the Blue (Possibly.  I&#39;m not sure about the color hierarchy).  Radagast&#39;s journey and growth in this first part of the story is very interesting to me, and his change of color is a result of his getting back on the path that he was supposed to be on.<br><br>After the fall of Isengard, the Fellowship will split.  Radagast the Blue would go to Lothlуrien as an escort for Saruman and then on to Mirkwood to fight the forces out of Dol Guldur (maybe not headed by Khamыl, the Shadow of the East, due to the Battle of Isengard) and protect his home, alongside Thranduil and his Elves.<br><br>Gandalf, Elrond, Faramir, Aragorn and Galadriel head to Gondor at the head of the army of the New Alliance of Elves and Men.  This is to draw Sauron&#39;s eye toward Gondor.  The hope is that Sauron, who is aware of the One Ring&#39;s proximity to the palantir of Orthanc, will see all the force marching and assume that they are massing around the might of four rings of power in order to push into Mordor through the Black Gate.  This will be his fear because of the defeat that the Nazgыl suffer at Isengard and because Gondor has been putting up a very good fight behind Boromir, Captain of the White Tower, and are not in such dire straits as we saw in the books.<br><br>The rest of the Fellowship, consisting of Frodo, Sam, Gimli, and Glorfindel, head northeast across Rohan, through the Wold (where they find Gollum coming south from Moria), and passing to the north of Emyn Muil and the Dead Marshes and coming at the mountains from the North.  They will need to find a way through the mountains, but with Gimli and Glorfindel they stand a chance of making it into Mordor.<br><br>Book 3: The Mountain and the Field<br><br>Seeing the might of the Alliance coming to Gondor, Sauron launches his offensive.  Because Aragorn doesn&#39;t go through the Paths of the Dead, the ships from the south are still full of Coursairs of Umbar who will fight for Sauron.  Faramir and Boromir come together to turn their father from his despair, and the Steward of Gondor leads his army into battle.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if the quest is successful or how the Battle of Pelennor Fields ends, but I feel like we stand a good chance of losing some main characters.  I think this is an interesting potential AU, and I wish that I had the time, knowledge, and skill to give it the treatment it deserves.  Clearly it would need a lot of work even in the concept stage.<br><br><br>So...questions?  Comments?  Concerns?<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>This would need <i>heaps</i> of background work before you ever set key to doc.<br><br>The first point, actually, is your whole premise: why are they taking the One Ring into range of Saruman, when Saruman is known to be searching for it? That needs explaining, and to make a good AU, it should be tied into your previous changes - in this case, why Faramir instead of Boromir came to Imladris.<br><br>And I think that&#39;s the answer. Saruman, in your scenario, is taking far more of his own actions, rather than waiting for Sauron&#39;s command. He has his army - initially Dunlendings, later supplemented by orcs and half-orcs (footnote: in the Bookverse, &#39;Uruk-Hai&#39; just means &#39;Orc-folk&#39;; it&#39;s a term for big orcs. The crossbreeds Saruman created are technically half-orcs. This doesn&#39;t apply in the Movieverse, of course) - out patrolling the west bank of Anduin, as far up and down as he can reach (which, in practice, means midway up Mirkwood, all the way down to Cair Andros). That means Denethor is unwilling to send his Captain off on some mad quest - and that there&#39;s no longer any safe route for the Fellowship past Caradhras.<br><br>So, the council decides, if stealth alone won&#39;t work, stealth and one MASSIVE misdirection ploy might (and Legolas suggests it - &#39;A diversion!&#39; ;)). Get the biggest guns you can find, and throw them <i>all</i> at Saruman. And, since we&#39;re going all-out here: <i>reveal the identity of the Elven Ringbearers</i>. Sauron doesn&#39;t know, you see: he suspects Galadriel has one, but he isn&#39;t sure. But after this? He will be.<br><br>A Palantir would be immensely useful here, if we can get it - since Gandalf knows about Saruman&#39;s, we may need an infiltration mission into Orthanc before the main assault. And - the keystone of the plan - at the height of the battle, when defended by the Three and under assault by Nazgul, Frodo <i>has to put on the Ring</i>. Sauron <i>needs</i> to know it&#39;s there - otherwise the rest of the plan won&#39;t work.<br><br>And the rest of the plan is: throw Minas Tirith to the wolves. Aragorn and Faramir, between them, have <i>just</i> enough right to do this. The plan is to keep the Three very much out in the open, so Sauron is sure the One is with them. Then, as you say, sneak the One in round the back while Sauron pours everything out.<br><br>A few miscellaneous points:<br><br>-There is no &#39;colour hierarchy&#39; as such. The White Wizard is head of the Order, but that&#39;s as far as it goes. I agree about a colour change for Radagast; Blue or Grey would work, or any other colour that scans (it needs to be a monosyllable - Red, Pink(!), even Black would work if you aimed at &#39;hidden in the shadows&#39; rather than &#39;eeeeeevil&#39;; remember that Melkor&#39;s greatest crime was to turn the darkness the Elves awoke to, into something to be feared). And I think the growth of his character would be fascinating. <s>And then he died and comes back as Paul McGann...</s><br><br>-What would Sauron have up his sleeve? We know he has three of the Seven Rings, and has held two of them for a significant period. Does he have Bearers for them? The Mouth of Sauron is certainly a candidate. And Sauron holds onto the Nine - would the Nazgul be more powerful if they actually held their rings, despite the risk of them rebelling?<br><br>There&#39;s also a Balrog still hidden in Moria, which no-one knows about. Could Sauron awaken it? He couldn&#39;t order it around, it&#39;s his equal, a lieutenant of Melkor - but he could make an alliance with it. And Lorien is right in its path - with no Galadriel or Nenya to hold it back...<br><br>-Gollum. In the book and movies, Gollum found Frodo and Sam because he followed them since Moria. Assuming the Balrog awoke, he could well have <i>left</i> Moria (running in fear), but I think it&#39;s unlikely the Fellowship would just happen to run into him. I&#39;m also not sure he&#39;d be all that useful - they&#39;re not using his knowledge of Cirith Ungol, so you&#39;d literally be bringing him along on a whim.<br><br>-Glorfindel and Gimli are great choices for guides. Gimli, of course, is a dwarf, and so will do well in the mountains. Glorfindel? He was there when the Last Alliance took Mordor. He knows his way around.<br><br>-And the final outcome... it really depends. Does Gondor have time to call for aid from the southern provinces? The timeline is changes, so the Corsairs may not yet have arrived - meaning more soldiers at Minas Tirith, but also far greater damage in the south. And who else is coming? Are the Ents marching to Gondor?<br><br>The problem is, while the New Alliance is certainly larger than the equivalent in the books, they&#39;re going to be coming in piecemeal. The Rohirrim will move faster than the elves, who will probably outpace the Ents. You could slow them all down - but then, as Merry said, they might just arrive in time to disrupt the orcs&#39; celebration feast.<br><br>But then there&#39;s Sauron&#39;s problems. He hasn&#39;t had the same amount of time to muster the Haradrim and the Easterlings. The army of Morgul can certainly attack - but Mordor itself, in the book, was kept in reserve and only used at the Morannon. Would he send out everything, and risk losing it all? Would he use only part of his strength, hoping they might be able to hold? Or would he try and cheat - offer up, maybe, his own surrender in the face of so mighty an army? It worked last time, after all...<br><br>-The northern battle will be critical - if nothing else, Sauron will definitely want the Dol Guldur forces to move on Gondor. Radagast needs to <i>fly</i> north as fast as he can, to get everyone moving: Thranduil, Ergaroth, Dale, Erebor, even the Beornings and any dwarves left in the Iron Hills. No time to plan in advance - he&#39;ll have to act as messenger while they&#39;re already on the move.<br><br>-I think you should rename the first book &#39;The Company of the Ring&#39;. That way you have new titles throughout. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m surprised it works as well as it does, considering the only research I did was on places and people.  Thank you for so much detailed feedback.<br><br>So, where to begin...<br><br>The bit about Saruman changing the game by taking more of his own action makes a lot of sense.  This is the sort of information that I am not knowledgeable enough to come up with.<br><br>As I understand it, one of the major reasons that the Elven Rings were hidden was because, while Sauron had the One, they could fall under his control.  It would not have been so easy a task as taking control of the others, because he had no part in their making, but it could still have been done.  If that holds, they are hiding the rings now because there was always a chance that the One would find its way back to him, and they were guarding against that chance.  Now that they know where the One is, and this is an all-or-nothing fight, there is no reason to remain hidden.<br><br>Frodo is going to be in massive amounts of danger in this version of the story.  It is going to be very risky, putting the Ring on while standing on Saruman&#39;s front lawn and with Nazgul overhead.  Very risky, but potentially lots of reward.<br><br>Radagast the Green, perhaps?<br><br>In the videogame &quot;Lord of the Rings: War in the North&quot; (which is great, if anyone ever wants to give it a try) the characters battle a Black Numenorean who was taught sorcery by Sauron.  He is gathering an army of Gundabad Orcs and Olog-hai in Carn Dum for an assault on the peaceful lands of the North.  If he were canon in the books or movies, he might be a candidate to be a Ringbearer for one of the Dwarf Rings.<br><br>The Balrog of Moria is an interesting case.  I don&#39;t know that anyone really knows that it is down there, except maybe the Goblins.  I think the only reason it was a problem for the Fellowship was because another Maia came barging through its home.  I don&#39;t know that it was really active before that, or if Sauron would even know to send a summons.  If he does bring it into the fight...the Golden Wood might well burn.<br><br>Gollum would probably not be useful.  I don&#39;t know how they would deal with him, but he is still being drawn to the Ring, and he hasn&#39;t really been in any of the other discussions in this thread, so I thought him worth mentioning here.  All he can really do is cause Frodo trouble, I guess.<br><br>I thought those two would be useful companions on this quest.  Glad you agree.<br><br>All of those are good questions...and I really only have an answer to one of them.  I don&#39;t think the Ents could be convinced to march to Gondor.  They might be better sent to Lothlorien.  Especially if word gets out about a Balrog coming down from Moria.<br><br>As for the northern battle, you have to remember that Legolas and Gloin were in Rivendell and didn&#39;t travel with the Company of the Ring (because that is a good name for it).  So what are they doing?  Traveling back to their homelands and bringing word of the war to their people.  It will be up to them to get Mirkwood, Erebor, Dale, and whoever else they can muster, ready for battle.  They could, depending on how the timelines work out, end up fighting the combined might of Dol Guldur and Moria somewhere near Lothlorien.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>(Warning: multiple unrelated tweaks to canon incoming. This story should never be written without serious justification)<br><br><b>1) Sam Gamgee.</b> Although Frodo is healed by Elrond of the Morgul wound, he managed to fall off Asfaloth and break his arm in three places. Unable to continue the Quest, he passes the Ring to Sam (with great effort of will).<br><br><b>2) Radagast the Brown.</b> Since Gandalf is still imprisoned in Orthanc (apparently Saruman realised that &#39;on the roof&#39; isn&#39;t the best place to lock him up), Radagast was summoned by Elrond at the last minute.<br><br><b>3) Eowyn of Rohan.</b> Frustrated by Wormtongue&#39;s influence in Rohan, she disguised herself as Dernhelm and accompanied Boromir to Rivendell. Sure, the disguise didn&#39;t hold very long - but long enough to get her on her way.<br><br>(As a result of her testimony, Aragorn and Boromir head straight back south towards Rohan. If Saruman is meddling with Gondor&#39;s only ally, that needs <i>immediate</i> attention. The Fellowship won&#39;t be going their way)<br><br><b>4) Tauriel of Mirkwood.</b> Totally-not-dead Captain of the Guard, sent by Thranduil to bring word. She has a vested interest/obsession with fighting the Enemy.<br><br><b>5) Thorin Stonehelm.</b> Like Denethor, Dain II Ironfoot sent his son and heir to bring word to Rivendell.<br><br><b>6) Glorfindel of Imladris.</b> While I like the idea of Elrond joining the Fellowship, I don&#39;t think he&#39;d take Vilya out of Rivendell. Glorfindel is the only elf around (except Galadriel) who can definitely drive off a Ringwraith. We need him.<br><br><b>7) Bard of Dale.</b> Bard son of Brand son of Bain son of the more famous Bard. He chose to accompany his friend Thorin to Rivendell. (Yes, this leaves both realms without their heirs; I think that&#39;s plot-relevant)<br><br><b>8) Arwen Evenstar.</b> According to <i>The Laws and Customs among the Eldar</i>, Elves weren&#39;t sexist - they viewed men and women as equal, with the sole exception that only women could bear children. This meant that women didn&#39;t tend to go to war - and thus, since fighting dulls the elven healing skill (somehow), were generally better healers. &#39;<i> Indeed in dire straits or desperate defence, the nissi fought valiantly, and there was less difference in strength in speed between elven-men and elven-women that had not borne child that is seen among mortals. On the other hand many elven-men were great healers and skilled in the lore of living bodies, though such men abstained from hunting, and went not to war until the last need.</i>&#39; A psychic healer is a very useful person to have around - and it should be noted that she&#39;s probably both capable of and permitted to make <i>lembas</i> (a right and recipe reserved to queens and high ladies of the Eldar). I bet that would come in handy.<br><br><b>9)</b> ... wow, turns out that without four hobbits to make up the numbers, it&#39;s really hard to come out with a good nine. I&#39;ve already got three elves and two humans; there&#39;s no wizards on hand, and the only other young dwarf I know of is Gimli. So, since Aragorn&#39;s not coming, let&#39;s go with...<br><br><b>9) Halbarad the Dъnadan.</b> Kinsman to Aragorn and (in LotR) leader of the Grey Company. He has the skills to bring the Neo-Fellowship through any amount of rough terrain, even when out of his native land. Plus, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1690622/1/Dont_Panic">Don&#39;t Panic</a> left me with a soft spot for him.<br><br>Obviously, this Fellowship will do things very differently. With no less than four Mirkwood-locals, they would take the High Pass (kept open by the Beornings), and then the Elven Road to Thranduil&#39;s halls. After that (and after anyone had left who wanted to - I foresee the entire Fellowship getting caught up in the wars around Dale), they would head down through eastern Rhovanion to come at Mordor from the north. It&#39;s possible they would take boats down the Celduin/River Running, maybe even all the way to Dorwinion on the Sea of Rhыn (and the descendents of <a href="http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Bladorthin.html">King Bladorthin</a>?), and actually enter Mordor from the <i>east</i>.<br><br>Who would they meet? In rough order: Beornings, Elves, Men of Esgaroth, Dwarves, Easterlings, Orcs. This would be a great chance to explore the Easterlings a bit, and maybe even see the back-lines of Mordor.<br><br>And as for the Ring... I&#39;m afraid Eowyn is probably going to try and steal it. Much like Boromir, she has that burning urge to protect her homeland. She may even end up fighting Thorin or Bard over it...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>One story I considered and discarded was leaving Calawhatsit - or, in your case, Fredegar the biggest (har har) dropped character - at Dunharrow. But I couldn&#39;t see a way to make that a story - or at least, a story that couldn&#39;t equally well be told be Generic Rohir Number Three. There&#39;s no war going on in Rohan, so you&#39;re left with &#39;peasant has a hard life and then the king dies&#39;.<br><br>And this is the problem with all the Fifth Hobbit scenarios. I can&#39;t find a story that doesn&#39;t either make the character pointless (as discussed), or rely on them being inexplicably better than the others (being the one to stop Pippin), or simply make things worse. For instance, let&#39;s say Eowyn can only take one hobbit, and chooses Fredegar - who fails to help kill the Witch-King. So Eowyn dies, and Minas Tirith probably falls, and Gorgoroth is still full of orcs, and Frodo dies, and Sauron wins. Or I suppose Aragorn and the Grey Company could ride to Mordor alone, making a lightning strike past Minas Morgul to try and hit the Black Tower before the massive army behind them catches up and murders them...? Which could be a fun story, but... most people don&#39;t want to add a Tenth Walker to do nothing for most of the Quest and then make everything go dark.<br><br>Your alternative Walkers: I think you could actually get rid of Aragorn, too - by sending him off with Boromir to Minas Tirith, and letting his adoptive brothers take on the Ring Quest (they are, after all, far more experienced than him). If Frodo goes (and can we make that an &#39;if&#39;...?), Sam will - and Gandalf is &#39;Sauron&#39;s Enemy&#39;, so yes, he&#39;ll be there. But after that, you really can design your own team.<br><br>Will that make things go differently? Sure! Take out Boromir, and there&#39;s no reason to go south - so the Dale-and-Mirkwood party could make a solid case for taking the High Pass (despite the danger - maybe they can team up with their returning relatives for the crossing), then crossing Mirkwood on the Forest Road and trekking down the eastern side (you can&#39;t go down the west side and round the bottom, that&#39;s Dol Guldur). Take out Gimli, and you lose a second advocate for Moria - but take out Aragorn, and you lose the fiercest opponent, and maybe Gandalf can take them straight there, thus tweaking the timeline just enough that - even with all else going as it does - the Three Hunters (whoever they are) reach Rohan <i>before</i> the Battle of the Fords of Isen, and Theodred is still alive...<br><br>It all goes round and round. That said, I think my favourite idea is the one I&#39;m not sure you actually made: Thranduil sending (a not-dead and fully rehabilitated) Tauriel instead of Legolas. Particularly since she has a Thing for short hairy people...<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: The general problem is, the Quest has a certain momentum that makes it harder to change the plot without simply writing &#39;Sauron wins&#39; as time goes on. From Rivendell, there are many paths they can take - the High Pass, the Redhorn Gate, Moria, the Gap of Rohan, even way down south along the coast. Once they pass Moria, they can skip Lorien if they want, and see what that does. From the Breaking, you can send them all on together, or change the breakdown. But after that point? M&amp;P become pointless (and unless you send an orc with them, they pretty much have no choice but to meet Treebeard and take their last action). F&amp;S can&#39;t really change much without dying. And the Three Hunters are railroaded into the rest of the plot by various people telling them where to go. Maybe you could send someone to Dunland to recruit another army - but you don&#39;t need one.<br><br>That said... hmm. What about a Goldberry-esque nature spirit who can zip across Rohan and smuggle M&amp;P out of the orcs&#39; grasp - and thus leave Treebeard in Fangorn, and Saruman at large? I may have to write that one...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think here, the question would be less about the symbolism of the world like the Tenth Walker story would be and more on what happens and how people in-universe react to the new arrival of a random extradimensional interloper. Badfic versions of the falling-into-the-story tend to just have the OC teleport in after something like getting hit by a car, falling down some stairs, or &quot;just waking up there&quot; happens, and then they&#39;re just suddenly given important roles, recognized by famous characters, and often even sent on important quests that only main characters would normally get to do.<br>They don&#39;t react properly, and the person falling in definitely does not react properly. If you passed out after falling down a random flight of stairs, you wouldn&#39;t immediately react with &quot;Oh, boy! I&#39;m in the world of my favorite book!&quot;, would you? Assuming you even had access to that information and didn&#39;t just wake up in the middle of a field surrounded by wargs or in a random village that you didn&#39;t recognize in which the population is chasing you around with sticks in assumption that you&#39;re some sort of failed Nazgыl experiment that just plummeted from the sky, that is. No, you&#39;d be freaking out, probably. Wondering how you got there, wondering if it&#39;s permanent, wondering when you are in the story and whether or not some orcs are about to come raid this random village with you inside it.<br>Even if you ignore the questions like &quot;What would happen if someone else falls down those stairs?&quot; having the interloper instantly know and get along with people in whatever world they fall into is removing some of the more interesting aspects of the potential story, especially if a person falls into someplace as well-known as Middle-earth. I think it would be funny if the person who falls in, rather than being a Tolkien/Jackson superfan with barely repressed lust for some important story-mover, was just some random person who had only heard about Middle-earth in passing or had read it several years ago but never thought the information would be important again, and knows just enough about how the plot goes to cause trouble when he or she inadvertently brings it up in conversation. And of course, the culture of modern Earth would be enormously different from the Middle-earth culture, so the interloper probably couldn&#39;t fit in at all even if they did have the foggiest idea of what to do or what was going on. They would probably be viewed as an oddity at best and an aberration at worst, which means there would need to be a very good reason if the interloper manages to tangle themselves up in canonical affairs like the Fellowship or one of the big important councils that people who fall into other worlds so often seem to be let into for little reason.<br><br>But of course, the big questions here would be regarding execution of the plot post-realizing-where-you-are-and-what-is-going-on. After falling from one world into another that doesn&#39;t recognize you in your strange clothes and unplaceable accent(I&#39;m going to assume that the transportation process at least allows the language that the interloper speaks and understands to translate into one of Middle-earth&#39;s native languages, though, because it wouldn&#39;t make for a good story if one of the main characters couldn&#39;t understand anybody), it would be easy to make the interloper the ability to make new friends unrealistically simply and have some sort of link to the main plot, but the thing is that the person who falls in is, in the most basic sense, intruding on someone else&#39;s plotline. You could make a very good story out of that, though, if the characters, the interloper the Lords of the Rings itself recognize that it is an intrusion. Honestly, I think it would be more interesting if the interloper tries and fails to get into some important canonical events and decides to go along the sidelines, using what elements of the story they remember to interact with some of the supporting cast and fight against darkness in a way entirely distinct from the Fellowship&#39;s questing and fighting giant trolls and Balrogs and such. The random human from Earth isn&#39;t going to be much use on a long walking quest or an extended sword fight anyway, and if they go off to the sidelines, we could maybe see them in Gondor before Boromir dies and Denethor goes crazy, or in Rohan when it was still controlled by Grнma, and start doing things in ways that start affecting the plot as a whole over time, but in smaller ways that change the course of canonical events rather than huge ones that blow them to pieces, as Sues like to do.<br>Of course, there&#39;s the alternative option that the interloper would, once rejected by the major stations of the canon, try to go over to Sauron&#39;s side and give him the information they know about Arda&#39;s future in retaliation, but let&#39;s not even pretend some orc general isn&#39;t just going to torture all of the Lord of the Rings&#39;s plot out of the random human he found wandering around in Mordor once the general finds out there&#39;s more than a passing chance that said human isn&#39;t speaking absolute nonsense.<br><br>Oh, and just think of the repercussions for the world as a whole now that some interdimensional traveler has breached Eд. If Sauron or Saruman or some other malevolent Tolkien nasties find out that the interloper is from another universe, how will they react? Maybe they&#39;d want to see if the process can be turned the other way, and this mysterious world unguarded by the Elves, the Valar, and the descendants of Nъmenor could become an outpost for their dark reachings. Maybe they&#39;d try and send some significant opponent, Gandalf perhaps, to this unknown world permanently, so that they couldn&#39;t cause any more trouble for the powers that loom. Or it could even go the other way, and the Elves might wish to see the evils of Mordor banished from their home planet forever, even if it means wherever those nasties go to is going to have to deal with creatures it&#39;s not entirely equipped to fight. This would depend on the method of transport, of course, because sometimes it might not be reversible, or there might not be any way of getting anything back to Earth without extreme difficulty and some sort of powerful magic or supreme aligning of events to kickstart the transport. Besides, if it was too easy, the interloper would just abscond the second they see the first party of orcs rushing at them. But the big bads wouldn&#39;t know about that. All they&#39;d know is that someone has fallen into their world from another, and if the newcomer won&#39;t give them a way between worlds, they might be able to take it through dark magic, forcible experimentation, and all of those other lamentable activities dark lords get up to.<br><br>Ooh, sudden random related thought. If Sauron had his semi-corporeal hands on a source of power that could cut through dimensions, I wonder whether he&#39;d try to use that power to resurrect or recall to his side all those beings imprisoned in the Void. Even if him doing so never ends up happening in-story, it would certainly provide additional stakes for the interloper and whoever they decide to associate with if there&#39;s a risk of Morgoth and/or members of Ungoliant&#39;s species escaping from the Void and fighting directly for the side of darkness.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s not a whole lot to go off here, I could review more solidly if this was one big fic with context and stuff (I can actually infer some already, so that&#39;s a plus!), but nothing strikes me as immediately killable. That&#39;s something? :P To be perfectly honest this first chapter feels like a generic Tenth Walker, just not blatantly Suvian.<br><br>In spirit of full disclosure, I tend to be wary of Tolkien fic in general, Tenth Walkers or otherwise. This is obviously personal bias and I try to look past it, but not only is this sort of thing really easy to mess up, but few if any authors I&#39;ve seen tackle it can manage to write in Tolkien&#39;s world and not make everything feel/sound wrong. That&#39;s not talking about your linked fic, hS, and not targetting any specific individual at all - just a generality.<br><br>A thought/question though, since you&#39;re demonstrating. How does one account for how a Tenth Walker messes up all the numerology and symbolism and such of the nine Walkers/nine Nazgul thing? Obviously a ficwriter could just slap a tenth Nazgul in somewhere (funny how few seem to), but anything more involved?</p>

            <p>In the movieverse, the numerology never comes up. The Fellowship is literally made up of &#39;everyone who shouted loudly enough when Frodo volunteered&#39;. Elrond seems spectacularly uninterested in who goes - in fact, I think he&#39;s probably written them off already. Certainly he&#39;s eager enough to get Arwen to safety.<br><br>In the bookverse? The obvious method is to have one member join after Rivendell (as Pippin does here). Then, though, the Fellowship would need a very good reason to trust them - or, as in the case of my orc-fic further down, to bring them along regardless. In Rivendell...<br><br>Well, you could have Elrond think of something else to link them with in terms of numbers. Have him say they are chosen to match the kings of the Last Alliance - that would be, uh, Elendil, Anбrion, Isildur, Gil-Galad, Oropher of Mirkwood,  Amdнr of Lуrien... a dwarf from Moria - let&#39;s call him Durin, might as well. That&#39;s seven so far. Let&#39;s add Cнrdan  of Lindon, Elrond himself... then, if you say (or let it go unsaid) that Amroth of Lуrien wasn&#39;t there with his father, you can make Thranduil, heir to the throne of Mirkwood (and thus leader of its army after his father died) the tenth. There we go - a nice canonical ten (or eleven, if you leave Amroth in) for Elrond to compare them to. &#39;As of old ten rulers marched against Sauron, now ten Walkers will seek to complete what we began...&#39;<br><br>Coming back to the story: you&#39;re right, that scene is pretty generic. It&#39;s written to showcase the fact that you can make there be a Fellowship of ten without breaking canon. How well the story worked would depend on what the OC did later.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Elrond stood staring out of the window, his back to the door. &quot;Ringbearer,&quot; the Lord of Imladris said, not turning. &quot;Thank you for coming.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lord Elrond,&quot; Frodo said from the door, &quot;your counsel is invaluable to me, and you - I mean - you have been a great-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I understand, Frodo.&quot; Elrond turned, a small smile on his face. &quot;Many years ago, I myself was... overawed, shall we say, by the presence of my elders. When the Last Alliance marched against Sauron, it seemed as if every king in the world rode with us. Isildur of Arnor and Anбrion of Gondor were ever at the forefront on the plains, but in the forests of Wilderland Amdнr of Lothlуrien and Oropher of Greenwood - or later his son, Thranduil - broke the trail. Even the Dwarves joined us, and Durin&#39;s folk and Durin&#39;s leadership brought us safely through the Misty Mountains. And the grandeur of our army!&quot; Frodo realised that Elrond&#39;s mind was far away, walking in the living memory of the elves. &quot;Lindon was emptied - under Cнrdan, every last vestige of the great realms of old marched to war. And, yes, there was I - I with my small household out of Rivendell, thrust into the service of the High Kings. Gil-Galad and Elendil - names that echo in my thoughts even now.&quot;<br><br>In Frodo&#39;s mind&#39;s eye, visions of the armies of old flared in brilliant colour - but painted in broad strokes, like the work of an artist who had never witnessed the muster. &quot;I wish... I wish I could have seen it,&quot; he murmured.<br><br>Elrond seemed to snap back to the present. &quot;Do you?&quot; he asked sadly. &quot;I wish I had not had to. And more than that... I wish we had completed our task, that this meeting might never have happened.&quot; He sighed, and looked out of the window again, towards the west. &quot;But the Powers do not grant wishes, Frodo. In this task, in this Middle-earth, we must find our own path.&quot;<br><br>Beyond the Elf Lord&#39;s shadow, Frodo could see a single star gleaming in the evening sky - Eдrendil, the Evening Star. &quot;But not without light to guide us,&quot; he said suddenly.<br><br>Elrond smiled. &quot;Indeed,&quot; he said. &quot;And that is why I have called you here: guidance. You must have companions on your quest, to guide and guard you and Samwise. Gandalf, indeed, has already agreed to lead your company, and for the others...&quot;<br><br>The Lord of Imladris looked once again towards the evening star. &quot;Ten lords and kings faced Sauron and could not defeat him,&quot; he said. &quot;Perhaps ten walkers, with no armies at their back, can succeed where we failed. And as the Last Alliance brought together all the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, so shall the Fellowship of the Ring consist of representatives of all those whose hopes rest on you. For Men...&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>(Don&#39;t pox the movieverse - it has its own merits. But it also has far fewer barriers to a Tenth Walker)<br><br>The problem with making ten by including Sauron in the Nazgul is that we&#39;re talking about the Enemy&#39;s <i>servants</i> - not the Enemy himself. Elrond specifically says &#39;set against&#39; - even though it never happens, it&#39;s clear he expected the Fellowship to have to face the Nazgul together again. Five Ringwraiths had already attacked Aragorn and the hobbits at Weathertop - probably where the idea came from.<br><br>The easiest way to make ten Nazgul is simply to... make ten Nazgul. There&#39;s no real reason for Men to only have nine rings, and &#39;ten&#39; scans just as well. Alternately, you could make it one of the dwarven rings, which Sauron had given to a man - that could work (and if I was doing it, I&#39;d make the man in question Eдrnur, the last King of Gondor; this may go in the story).<br><br>As for making the OC contribute to the plot - you have to accept that you&#39;re <i>going</i> to be making stuff up. The Nine Walkers drive their own plot - a tenth would have their own effects. A random Rivendell elf would, even without changing anything else, mean there were four, not three, left to consider going after Merry and Pippin - and with two elves, the right choice would be to send them into Rohan at high speed, while Aragorn and Gimli... probably went straight to Gondor.<br><br>What you <i>can&#39;t</i> do, as I said elsewhere, is write a story which consists of the LotR story happening, &#39;And Morwen was there also&#39;. That&#39;s not a story, that&#39;s a rewriting of the script. The only reason to do it is to get the OC&#39;s thoughts and reactions on paper - and there&#39;s a wide enough variety of people in the story that you should rather use one who&#39;s there.<br><br>Oh, or to sleep with Legolas, of course. And how about a story where Legolas and your OC get together... and then stay in Lorien, leaving the remaining seven Walkers to head down Anduin without them?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Maybe we can discuss the merits you were talking about later if you like? It sounds like you&#39;ve an interesting take I don&#39;t want to get too off topic/distract myself too much (and sorry for bugging you with e-mails again, speaking of discussions). The Nazgul thing, in retrospect, was a stupid question, and I suppose I have only my own reluctance to make stuff up wholesale to blame. :P I thought it would be an interesting angle to ponder upon is all, ten Walkers going with ten Nazgul and how that would affect things.

And why shouldn&#39;t he obey? Even the dark Power that held him could not penetrate the depths of his mind, he was sure. And he needed his ring back...<br><br>&quot;Service,&quot; he said, as if testing out the word. &quot;Yes... I will serve.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excellent,&quot; the Witch-King said. &quot;Then, Eдrnur of Gondor, here is your first task: a skulking creature lurks in our valley. Find it - bring it to me - and perhaps our master will allow you to see your ring once more.&quot;<br><br>Eдrnur bowed his head before the Lord of the Nazgыl and pulled his dark cloak around himself. &quot;Yes, my lord,&quot; he hissed. &quot;The master&#39;s will shall be obeyed.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The reason Eдrnur is a good choice for Tenth Nazgul is because he is the one person known to have gone missing in Minas Morgul. He&#39;s the reason the Stewards of Gondor rule &#39;until the King returns&#39; - because they never knew if he was dead. He rode off to face the Witch-King in single combat, and just... never came back.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What if one of the other civilisations of Middle-Earth was present at the Council? Perhaps one of the tribes of Harad was less amenable to the will of Sauron than they let on?

            <p>Merry and Pippin are already extra enough. Though they end up pushing the plot in other ways, it is not made obvious during the Council. They are more like &#39;fodder&#39; to the Fellowship, only to fill the same number of people as the Ring-Wraiths.<br><br>But Tenth Walker would be possible if they have their own purpose after the Breaking of the Fellowship, such as dealing with a village raided by Orcs, or raiding Orc patrols, a la Turin Turambar, or even a chance meeting with Radagast, making sure he sends messages to the rest of the Fellowship or to ask Eagles for help.</p>

            <p>This actually comes up a few times in the books. It&#39;s Gandalf who persuades Elrond to let M&amp;P join the Fellowship (he was going to send members of his household), and later - after Gandalf is dead - someone (Aragorn?) comments that they should never have brought them - it was Gandalf&#39;s idea, and he was the first to die.<br><br>But Gandalf wasn&#39;t wrong. He said that M&amp;P would have a part to play - and they did. He also seems to have been thinking about the fact that they were essentially innocent - and it was that childlike innocence which got both hobbits into positions in the militaries of Rohan and Gondor.<br><br>The thing is (one of the many thing), in the books, the Fellowship is pretty much an ad-hoc group. Elrond explicitly tells them they don&#39;t have to go any further than they want (except Frodo), and in fact, Aragorn and Boromir <i>planned</i> to split off and go to Gondor. That went out of the window when Gandalf died, but it was the plan.<br><br>So have an elf who wants to go home to Lorien, and doesn&#39;t care for any of the Fellowship - but grows close to them during the journey, and stays with them. Or, well, there&#39;s loads of options.<br><br>In the movie, it&#39;s even easier. The idea of matching the number of Nazgul never even comes up - Elrond just takes anyone who volunteers.<br><br>Of course, that&#39;s (all) just about getting them on the team. I think you&#39;re right that an extra member means the Fellowship should split differently. Maybe s/he manages to save Boromir, allowing Aragorn and Boromir to go to Minas Tirith while Legolas, Gimli, and the OC to go after the hobbits. Maybe the hobbits never get captured - or maybe Merry gets killed by that injury to his forehead, due to the OC changing the state of the battle.<br><br>Or maybe the OC stays on the shoreline, helps Frodo to leave quicker, and they go off without Sam - or Frodo leaves alone. Or... yeah, loads of options.<br><br>But no, making a story which consists of &#39;And Magielf was there also&#39; every three sentences isn&#39;t good writing. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Galthrid is grunting, trying to control his anger at the weird company of Men, Halflings, a Dwarf, and even an Elf in his hut. &quot;I told you, Gandalf, I don&#39;t want any more part in your adventures! Why would I be the one joining you and your idiot to face the Eye? And you know what they make of traitors!&quot;<br><br>Gandalf smiles at the orc&#39;s complaint. &quot;Now, Master Galthrid, if we manage to get rid of the Eye, your kin can live freely, unfettered by masters who wants you dead for their own selfish ambitions.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Live freely? We have freedom enough! No one from the west came into this neck of Imladris. Forest people trade with us, and they have no problem with us. We can have our little village, unmolested by the Elves thanks to you, I must say. But if I leave this place? Hah! Everyone wants us dead! Take your pick, that pansy elf over there, the dwarf over there, those men picking at my cheese, and even those children are plotting to cut my neck come nighttime!&quot;<br><br>Aragorn and Boromir puts down the cheeseknife they are holding and pushes away their plates of bread. Gimli and Legolas looks at each other, and Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin muttered under their breath, &quot;We aren&#39;t children anymore.&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Master Galthrid, you would be an indispensible guide through the Black Gates and into Mordor. We assure you that none of us are wishing you dead.&quot;<br><br>At which point Legolas suddenly stands, &quot;I give you my word, Orc, unless you betray us first, we will not kill you.&quot;<br><br>Galthrid chuckles, then roars into laughter. &quot;Why would I trust an Elven word? We killed many of your kin, and you killed many of us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have you heard of Feanor and his children?&quot;<br><br>At the words of the name Feanor, Galthrid&#39;s face turns grey. Which is a awesome feat considering how black his face is.<br><br>&quot;I will swear an oath, binding my doom to yours, yours to mine, I swear by my...&quot;<br><br>&quot;STOP!&quot;, shouted Galthrid, &quot;No need for an oath! My ancestors have suffered enough under Feanor&#39;s children and their foolish oath. If you want to die pursuing an oath, leave my people out of it.&quot;<br><br>Galthrid then turned to Gandalf, &quot;Fine then, Gandalf, I shall join your petty company. But any sign of trouble and I&#39;ll have you skewered for breakfast. I ask for the loot from any battles you participate in, safety from any harm, and sixty gold coins upfront for my... soon-to-be widow.&quot;<br><br>Gandalf opens his pouch, counts sixty gold coins, then puts it on the table. Galthrid collects it and puts it into a pouch.<br><br>&quot;You must stay for the night, I need to sharpen my cleaver. DARLING! DARLING!&quot;<br><br>His wife, Fashrit, enters the living room. &quot;Yes, husband?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Prepare dinner for our guests as well. For the Elf, make him some cabbage soup. And keep this pouch where it is safe.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Dawn breaks, as orcs in the village return home from their farms, working hard through the night. Galthrid touches his nose to his wife at the door. His three children places their forehead on Galthrid&#39;s back of his hand. Galthrid pats the head of the youngest child.<br><br>&quot;Study well, Ushnarh. One day, you be scholar at Khand. Meet my cousin there and make our family proud. And you two, Nushnarh and Tholnarh, get yourselves a wife. I&#39;m still young, but I want grandchildren.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dad, we still haven&#39;t finished opening our land yet.&quot;, whined Tholnarh.<br><br>Galthrid simply smiles. The Fellowship leaves Galthrid&#39;s village as his wife is softly sobbing, and his three children waving him goodbye. Galthrid holds back a tear, as he pulls his cloak to cover his head.<br><br>[An orc as a Tenth Walker is going to be rife with complications I suppose. I&#39;m sure a group of orcs at least neutral to battle against Sauron is already stretching the suspension of disbelief, not to mention hiding in Imladris. If I am to lengthen this tale, he won&#39;t survive the journey since the Ring is going to compel him sooner or later. Or Legolas automatically shoots him in a battle. Or a host of other possibilities.]<br><br></p>

            <p><b>Note:</b> My version will be going in the story linked above, with a comment that the idea was suggested by you.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Caradhras had defeated the Fellowship of the Ring. As they staggered down into the foothills, Sam couldn&#39;t keep from casting a glare back at the mountain. All that work, and for what? They were right back where they started.<br><br>Ahead, Legolas&#39; head suddenly snapped round. &quot;Mithrandir!&quot; he called - the Elvish version of Gandalf&#39;s name. &quot;I hear something!&quot;<br><br>Gandalf brought the Fellowship to a halt. Without waiting to be asked, Legolas darted off ahead, into the trees, and after a few moments Sam heard him exclaim something in his native tongue.<br><br>Gandalf&#39;s brow furrowed, and he beckoned the others forward. &quot;There is no danger,&quot; he told them. &quot;But there is need for haste. Come.&quot; The Fellowship hurried after him - Aragorn and Boromir first, then the hobbits, and finally Gimli bringing up the rear.<br><br>Legolas had stopped in the shade of an ancient oak tree. He stood bolt upright, staring down at a dark bundle on the ground. Gandalf hastened to his side, while the others halted a short distance back.<br><br>Pippin drew in a sharp breath as he saw the bundle. &quot;Is that-?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is an orc,&quot; Gandalf told him, &quot;one of the smaller breed which infests the Misty Mountains.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is it... dead?&quot; the young hobbit asked.<br><br>Gandalf knelt down at the orc&#39;s side. &quot;Not quite,&quot; he said after a quick investigation, handing Legolas a black dagger (Sam noted that Legolas seemed to be doing his best to hold the knife without actually touching it). &quot;It has a wounded arm - and there is the Sun to consider. Orcs hate and fear her light.&quot;<br><br>Boromir&#39;s face twisted in disgust. &quot;Kill it now,&quot; he said, &quot;before it recovers.&quot; Behind him, Gimli nodded agreement, hefting his axe, and even Merry drew his blade.<br><br>&quot;No!&quot; Legolas exclaimed, stepping between the Company and the orc. &quot;When I arrived it was calling out - asking for help in its dark tongue. It fell silent when it saw me, but... my people will never kill an orc which has surrendered. I will not start today.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then stand aside, elf,&quot; growled Gimli. &quot;You need not sully your arrows with its blood - my axe is thirsty.&quot;<br><br>Sam heard motion beside him, and to his surprise Frodo walked forward. Sam hurried after as his master brushed past Legolas and knelt at Gandalf&#39;s side. &quot;Does it speak the Common Tongue?&quot; Frodo asked.<br><br>&quot;Doubtful,&quot; Gandalf told him, &quot;or else it would already have spoken. But I believe it understands our talk, even if it cannot reply.&quot;<br><br>Frodo looked uncertain. &quot;If we leave it here,&quot; he said, &quot;it may tell other spies of Sauron that we have passed. The Enemy could guess our errand.&quot;<br><br>Gandalf nodded. &quot;You see the dilemma,&quot; he said. &quot;We must either kill it - which Legolas will not permit, and I would not approve of - or...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or take it with us,&quot; Frodo murmured. &quot;But that...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Precisely.&quot; Gandalf stood back up, then poked the orc with the tip of his staff. &quot;Well? What do you have to say for yourself, creature? I know you are listening.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Skai, sharkы!</i>&quot; the orc spat, and continued to snarl in its horrible-sounding language for some time. Sam heard Boromir muttering in the background, and even Aragorn shifted uncertainly. Finally, the orc stopped, and Gandalf shook his head in wonderment.<br><br>&quot;You were correct, Legolas,&quot; he said, not looking away from the orc. &quot;Snaga here - that is the only name she knows, it means &#39;slave&#39; in their tongue - was indeed asking for your help.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She?&quot; Sam exclaimed, then slapped a hand over his mouth. Gandalf looked at him, a twinkle in his eye.<br><br>&quot;She. As an orcish slave, that difference matters little. She understands some of our speech - enough to know that her life is in danger, though as she says, she knew that anyway - and wishes to bargain for her life. She offers information.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As if we would trust anything it tells us!&quot; Boromir said.<br><br>Legolas nodded. &quot;Mithrandir, I would not kill it - but nor would I believe it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We will have a chance to discover the truth or falsehood of her words very soon, I fear,&quot; Gandalf said, looking weary. &quot;She tells me the Wargs have come west of the mountains.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Yes, that&#39;s a real thing: elves won&#39;t kill an orc who surrenders. Of course, since orcs are raised with the belief that elves will torture, kill, and eat them, that doesn&#39;t happen, like, ever.<br><br>And if I were continuing this, Snaga would also know that there is something in Moria - &#39;Ghвshgыl&#39;, the Fire-Wraith...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Frodo felt... empty. That was the only way he could describe it; a great, yawning pit had opened up inside him and swallowed something vital but hitherto unseen, and its loss was telling on him. The Ring felt the heaviest it had ever felt, as if it wished to drag him down towards whatever grave awaited Gandalf-<br><br>He dared not take that thought any further down the road than it had already gone.<br><br>The sun had risen, weak and pale for the season, and a grim pall had descended over what remained of the Fellowship. Gandalf had been slain not three days before, and they had been powerless as children to stop his death. Even the normally irrepressible cheer of Merry and Pippin had been blunted; Gimli looked positively murderous. Moria had been his cousin&#39;s house, and now its usurpers had claimed his companion. His axe felt heavy in his hands, and would need orc blood to lighten it once more.<br><br>Legolas was far in front, keen elf eyes scanning for movement that might signal the fell denizens of Moria. Never mind that they had probably given up by now, retreating back to their stolen halls rather than face daylight; he would keep watch. He would protect them - wait.<br><br><i>Movement. Shape in the distance. Two shapes, joined. Rider? No. Nazgul? Still no. The horse is odd, diseased, misshapen. No warg, either; the legs are long and the gait is stilted. The rider is too tall for an orc and bears no banner of Lorien, and his face is masked. That is not elven armour, either, nor of the Rohirrim or Gondorians... there is a long lance at his side, and a fine one, but - is that arrowhead stone? Yes - which means - </i><br><br>The arrow had left his quiver before the cry of &quot;Southron!&quot; had left his mouth. Legolas gave a hiss of disappointment shortly afterwards; the horse-thing&#39;s jerky gait had lifted its rider higher than he had anticipated, and he had hit the Haradrim&#39;s shoulder rather than his neck. Feeling slightly embarrassed, he nocked a second arrow and then paused...<br><br>---<br><br>The Haradrim grimaced with every jolt his camel made as it lurched across the rocky flatlands. His hands were up, though his right hand was rather higher than the left, on account of his left shoulder having a Mirkwood arrow sticking out of it.<br><br>&quot;Please,&quot; he called, his Westron mangled by a nearly-impenetrable accent. &quot;I mean no harm! I bring a message for the Grey Wizard!&quot; Wincing a little, he dismounted, unbuckling his thin, bent sword and attaching it to a saddlebag. &quot;Please, master Elf!  Do not waste your arrows on a friend!&quot; He raised his hands again, as best he could.<br><br>Legolas continued to stare him down as the Fellowship ran to his side. Boromir looked at him, then at the Haradrim, then back. &quot;Why do you not shoot? His kind are as much servants of the Enemy as any orc.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He says he is a messenger,&quot; Legolas said from the corner of his mouth, &quot;and he bears no arms. I will not kill an unarmed Man, Southron or no.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If one such as him comes before a son of Gondor with no weapons, then he is nothing but a fool!&quot; Boromir began to move, but ran into Aragorn&#39;s outstretched arm.<br><br>&quot;Peace, Boromir. Let him speak.&quot;<br><br>The Southron turned. &quot;I must give my message only to the Grey Wizard. Where is he?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He lies in Moria,&quot; Boromir growled, &quot;slain by a demon not quite so foul as you. Leave your message and begone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I... no. That is not possible. Morinhetar said I must-&quot;<br><br>&quot;The opinions of whichever petty Black Numenorean princeling sent you on this fool&#39;s errand concern me not! Deliver your message and leave this place!&quot; At this, Legolas&#39; eyes widened, and he got down from his rock and moved to whisper in Aragorn&#39;s ear, bow still drawn tight.<br><br>&quot;Boromir,&quot; murmured Aragorn after a frantic conversation in Legolas&#39; native tongue, &quot;Morinehtar is a Wizard&#39;s name among the elves, so says Legolas. It would be well if we did not sully his name.&quot;<br><br>The son of Gondor said nothing for a few moments, then stepped back. He kept his sword out, though, and his eyes remained fixed on the Southron before him. &quot;It would be better had the elf not missed his mark, Aragorn. His kind are never to be trusted! What manner of messenger does not speak his name, tell me that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One who must stay secret, Boromir-haban-Denethor. My name is Amro-dan-Marwan, and my message is this: not all men of Harad serve the Lidless Eye. My brothers and I all were sent to tell the Grey Wizard, Mithrandir, that we exiles have no love for Mordor and its king. We came through the other Wizard&#39;s lands, hoping he might help us to find Mithrandir, but his wisdom,&quot; Amro spat the word, &quot;led us all to a trap, and of seven, only one remains. Six brothers, prince of Northrons, slain by the orcs of a treacherous Wizard. That is the cost of my message. They died with their task left undone, and now you said it will never be done at all, for he is...&quot; He trailed off and turned away, his shoulders sagging. &quot;Waste. Wasted men. Wasted sons.&quot;<br><br>Legolas slowly lowered his bow and returned the arrow to his quiver. &quot;How did you plan to find him?&quot;<br><br>Amro turned. &quot;After the White Wizard&#39;s treachery? In truth, I did not know. I made for Lothlorien in the hope that the Lady of the Wood might help me.&quot;<br><br>Aragorn had been listening throughout, and his eyes looked kindly on the Southron. &quot;We make for there too, and for the same goal. You may journey with us, if you like. These hills are thick with orcs at nightfall.&quot;<br><br>Boromir goggled. &quot;Have you gone mad? He will poison us in our sleep! Or can a Ranger fashion shackles from mud and sticks?&quot;<br><br>Amro simply nodded. &quot;I thank you, Aragorn of Men, and I would be glad to journey with you. My supplies are all but gone; <i>Arabash</i> has not eaten for three days, and nor have I for twice that. It is my hope that we may part on better terms than we met,&quot; he said, with a brief glance at Legolas.<br><br>It was at this point that the Hobbits and Gimli finally arrived, the dwarf wheezing from somewhere beneath plate mail and beard hair. &quot;Where is he? Where is he? I&#39;ll have him in half before you can-&quot;<br><br>&quot;He is the servant of a Wizard, master dwarf,&quot; said Legolas. &quot;You may lower your axe. He bore a message and could not deliver it, and his brothers died in the attempt. He is no threat.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s a Southron,&quot; muttered Boromir darkly, &quot;they are always a threat, to decency if nothing else.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is he going to kill us?&quot; Merry asked.<br><br>&quot;I am not, master... half-ling?&quot; said Amro. &quot;I swear it upon my life. Were I to wish ill upon your party, I would have died at your companion&#39;s first arrow, so the wise men of my people say.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a Camel,&quot; said Sam, slightly in awe. &quot;I&#39;ve seen pictures of them in my old Gaffer&#39;s books.

            <p>No, scratch that - very good. I liked Legolas&#39; misshapen horse idea. ;)<br><br>Two things I would raise, were you to continue this: firstly, in his list of names for himself, Gandalf lists &#39;Incбnus&#39; as his name &#39;in the South&#39;. Tolkien wavered over what this meant - it was <i>either</i> a name he used in Gondor, <i>or</i> derived from Haradrim  &#39;Inkā-nūsh&#39;/&#39;Inkā-nūs&#39;, <i>North-spy</i>. I think, for the purposes of fic-writing, you could call him the Grey Wizard Inkā-nūsh.<br><br>Secondly, while I like the account of Saruman&#39;s betrayal, Amro&#39;s naming of Lorien jars a bit. How has he heard of it? He wasn&#39;t directed there by Morinehtar, or by Saruman. I would suggest having him name it as &#39;Dwimordene&#39;, and saying (or leaving unsaid) that he picked up the name from the Rohirrim - who say that a witch lives there. The connection &#39;magic user might help me find other magic user&#39; could occur to him all by himself.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I used Mithrandir because Amro&#39;s in league with Morinehtar and would therefore probably be more familiar with that name for him, and totally not because I forgot that Inkanus was a thing.

            <p>I&#39;d say yes. It&#39;s an OC coming into the Fellowship who would never have been at the Council of Elrond in any sane world, that&#39;s practically the <i>definition</i> of a Tenth Walker fic.

            <p>In the Movieverse, I&#39;d say yes: the Fellowship is formed in that version of &#39;anyone who was there and volunteered&#39;. At that point, your question becomes &#39;is it possible to write a good OC?&#39; - which we certainly hope is true!<br><br>In the Bookverse, I&#39;d say no, because that Fellowship was specifically formed by Elrond to have a certain number. In that case, I think it would be more interesting to write a <i>Ninth</i> Walker story - one where Elrond sends your character instead of Legolas (representing the Elves), or instead of Boromir (perhaps he brings a Rider of Rohan as a companion, and they decide Boromir will head straight home while the Rider goes with the Fellowship), or even instead of Pippin, who Elrond wanted to send home anyway. And that&#39;s your Tenth Walker plot-hook - the Fellowship of Nine sets out, and three days later, Pippin manages to catch them up, making ten again...<br><br>And, again, you&#39;re just left with &#39;Can you slot an OC into canon events well?&#39;, which is basically the same question as &#39;Can you write good fanfic?&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be writing them (except possibly as drabbles) any time soon, but...One of them has Faramir going to Rivendell instead of Boromir, and subsequently joining the Fellowship.

            <p>It seems to me that the reason the Tenth Walker usually doesn&#39;t work very well (other than hijacking the whole Fellowship in favor of an OC) is that the &quot;Nine Walkers shall be set against the Nine Riders&quot; thing is never addressed in a way that makes any kind of sense.  Last night, Neshomeh and I talked about two ways that it could be addressed.<br><br>1) &quot;If they send nine against us, we will send ten.  If they send eleven, we will send twelve.&quot;  I will admit that this is not the most elegant solution, but it is one that could work, given more time to deal with Elrond&#39;s reasoning and wording.  This is the weaker of the two options, and would require the most work to get right.<br><br>2) &quot;Arrayed against us are Sauron and his Nine Riders.  We will answer with Gandalf/Aragorn and Nine Walkers.&quot;  Not perfect, but setting Gandalf or Aragorn apart as the leader and answer to Sauron, and the others being answers to the Nine Riders, could be done.  I think a case could be made for either of those two, really, but Gandalf is the more likely choice.  The way this would fail is if the Tenth Walker was supposed to be the counterpoint to Sauron.<br><br>So, that&#39;s what I came up with.  I think this situation is easier to work with than others, which is probably why it is used so often in badfic.  They don&#39;t feel they need to work very hard to get their OC in the Fellowship.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I remembered that Gandal are not to contend dirently with Sauron in battle. Somehow the breaking of this rule is a spoiler in Desolation of Smaug.<br><br>I think Gandalf will not have himself being the leader of the Fellowship and counterpoint to Sauron. Not to mention Frodo, the Ringbearer, is the spearhead of the mission. He is the only one who had to enter Sammath Naur and chuck the ring into the fire.

            <p>I never said he had to contend directly with Sauron, just like none of the others had to contend directly with any Black Rider (except for Merry, of course).  What I said was Gandalf is, more than any of the others, playing on the same level as Sauron.  They both set their plans into motion and let their allies carry them out: Gandalf by trusting that his allies will do what needs to be done, Sauron by forcing his servants to do what he needs them to.<br><br>You are probably correct that Gandalf would not pick himself as the leader, that&#39;s not however there are at least two ways that that could play out.  <br><br>1) Elrond, being more or less aware of Gandalf&#39;s true nature, is the one making the comparison.  Gandalf would likely protest, of course, but that is beside the point.  <br><br>2) Gandalf makes the comparison with Aragorn as the King-in-Exile being the counterpoint to Sauron&#39;s Tyrant-in-Power.<br><br>Either way would work, in my opinion.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I know, I said this never happens, but as per my New Year&#39;s resolution to do more stuff, I made it happen. I had some added incentive this time, since doctorlit found some lost PPC filks from way back in 2003 (thanks for those!), and since I was going to add them as well as 2012&#39;s batch, I figured I might as well do the seven from this year, too.<br><br><a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/">Behold, a 2014 miracle!</a><br><br>Please let me know if you spot any broken links, misdirected links, misspellings, misattributions, etc.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I made a few tweaks, mostly taking out gratuitous capitalization, and a couple for grammar:<br><br>&quot;who watches over <s>them</s> <b>it</b> with shaking red pens.&quot; (It = the fic being watched over. This verse is still a little shaky, since you refer to the pair of agents in the singular with &quot;who watches&quot; but plural everywhere else, but I don&#39;t know how to fix it without an actual rewrite of the line, and you can refer to a group in the singular, so... meh?)<br><br>&quot;We really hope you&#39;ll ask <b>us</b> to visit <s>you</s> soon.&quot; (Nobody asks to visit themselves.)<br><br>Overall, I like this filk a lot. It doesn&#39;t depart very much from the source material, but it scans really well and has a clear narrative, and it&#39;s fun. I love Jonathan Coulton, too. <sup>_^</sup> I didn&#39;t know this particular song existed before I looked it up to see how the heck something called &quot;Chiron Beta Prime&quot; was a Christmas song, but I&#39;m glad to know it now!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Whoops, sorry about those little errors. I guess it happens to the best of us.<br><br>Yay, another JoCo fan! Chiron Beta Prime is one of my favorite christmas songs, as it tells us all the true meaning of Christmas: Do what the giant robots say, and you&#39;ll be OK!

            <p>Sadly, all the radio stations seem to prefer schmaltzy pop covers of traditional songs. My taste in Christmas music is pretty eclectic—Robert Shaw, Mannheim-Steamroller, Loreena McKennitt, and Trans-Siberian Orchestra all make the grade—but you&#39;ll find few (if any) pop artists in my collection, and the exact number just depends on how you define &quot;pop.&quot;<br><br>... I&#39;ll stop being a music snob now. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Anyway, yes. Obey the giant robots, compromise with your zombie coworkers, graciously accept all gifts from your mad scientist suitor, and always remember to take your medicine. <sup>_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></p>

            <p>I might have missed a few things, especially since I don&#39;t know much in the way of the context, but since this was the Board&#39;s first introduction to the Sue Slayers as such, I&#39;ll just look at it as it stands.<br><br>The narration seems to be, to use a term, all over the place. Especially during the first part, in which it seems as though the narrator is just constantly getting distracted, which really isn&#39;t helping set the tone. The exposition is often spat out in short bursts that seem unfinished, since they usually just generate a confused question or two before the story switches back to something else, save that section right before the team enters Indeterminate High School Fandom when the exposition begins describing the team as though it doesn&#39;t want to do so and would rather be somewhere else. That&#39;s really the only reaction I get from that scene. When character introductions are that brief, that cut off from the actual flow of the story, and ended using phrases such as &quot;so, yeah&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s weird.&quot;, it looks as though the narrator realized there was more to exposit, didn&#39;t want to insert anything into the later or earlier action, groaned theatrically, and just dumped all of the character establishment between two sections of the plot so that it could get on with its day. That was the first time most of those people had been mentioned. It should <i>not</i> feel like that, especially if these are central protagonists as the story seemed to indicate.<br><br>Oh, and related to the character establishment: when delivering traits such as &quot;[] enjoys guns&quot;, &quot;[] can be annoyingly sarcastic&quot;, etcetera, it&#39;s usually best to show an instance of the character behaving in that way and then reinforce it through dialogue and narration rather than having the narrator&#39;s telling us about the trait come first and the showing not ever going into play. It&#39;s better to let people form impressions on their own rather than telling the reader what they should be noticing.<br><br>The alternate universe Sue Slayers just seemed to come out of nowhere and vanish without affecting the story at all. They were around for, translated roughly into real time, about thirty seconds, and the only things they do are mention a &quot;Canon Rebellion&quot; and seem significantly less affected by meeting their alternate-dimensional selves than one would typically expect. Was this intended to foreshadow something? Are there meetings between multiple universes all the time in Sue Slayers? How is meeting an alternate self &quot;cosmic irony&quot;? What was the alternate-universe team even <i>doing</i> there?<br><br>This is going to sound a bit out of place, given the PPC context, but why did the team immediately go after and kill the Sue they found? She wasn&#39;t doing anything aggressive until they charged her with weapons drawn for no reason, there was no indication that she was breaking canon or that she would potentially cause of future problems for the team, and not even any confirmation that she was really a Sue and not just some sparkly but ultimately benign OC written into being by a naпve preteen. All we got was &quot;Type 3 Mary Sue&quot;, which is apparently enough ground for sudden abandonment of the Squee-tracking mission until the offender was a hole in the dirt. What is Type 3? Is it a rank on a scale, or a recorded species, or a strata of Sue behavioral ranks? Are Type 3 Sues the &quot;oh, sweet merciful heavens, they&#39;ll tear the world asunder unless we kill them <i>right this instant</i>&quot; sub-type?<br><br>Actually, a lot of mentions were not explained or elaborated upon at all, which might make sense if we were expected to have read another story beforehand, but as an introduction, it just creates confusion. What&#39;s the distinction between the Squee colors? How exactly do the fangirls hop worlds in organized groups when they are &quot;mindless, shrieking beasts&quot;? How significant is promotion to X15a to X14b? What did that throwaway line about growing extra limbs by passing through a portal mean? Does the substance allowing the Sue Slayers to cross through space-time boundaries occasionally cause spontaneous mutation, or is it tied into that other throwaway line about people drowning when they walk through the portals? What exactly is the effect of the music? Does it disable the Sues, or give the assailants strength, or something of the sort? And if it does, why is the example given here a Katy Perry song? One would think that pop music would energize a Sue, not benefit her opponents. Can different genres of music produce different effects?<br><br>Basically, this was kind of a mess. Not an irredeemable mess, since many of its problems could be severely alleviated with a decent enough rewrite, but it leaves too many questions unanswered, has too-abrupt or unexplained introductions to almost everything that happens, tells rather than shows, and ends without the majority of its characters having done much of anything. I had honestly forgotten a few members of the team existed by the time they were brought up in the NAMES ARE CAPS-LOCKED paragraph, and they had only last been mentioned a page before. That might in part be due to my headache, but the storytelling doesn&#39;t help.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not too sure about the strategy-RPG aspect of it - maybe as an overworld thing, but not entirely integral. The game I think most closely resembles PPC activity, on the other hand, is X-COM. A load of small strike forces operating out of a much larger base, different missions, but with - as you rightly point out - more of an emphasis on stealth and intelligence-gathering, with the latter maybe working <i>a la</i> the puzzles in Phoenix Wright games. If you combine the stealth aspects with a really in-depth item system and the passive skill setup from Path Of Exile, there&#39;s potential for a truly fantastic game here. Hell, there could even be online co-op for crossovers and stuff. This sounds more and more awesome by the minute!<br><br>--parp</p>

            <p>...the idea of the PPC missions seems to sound like we could make an entire game out of the Covert Ops missions in <i>Enemy Within</i>. I was about to say that...<br><br>...and then you stole the words out of my mouth. You and I are going to have a good talk, good sir.<br><br>Though, I dunno. Maybe field missions would take on the form of Fire Emblem gameplay?</p>

            <p>I was thinking the exact same things about field missions. While it kind of goes against the two agents per mission tradition we have going on, I think it could be fun in a painful way to gang up on overpowered enemy units without getting steamrolled and permakilled.</p>

            <p>Some really bad badfics (or those with really overpowered Sues) see more than a pair of agents. Or sometimes it starts as a pair, but they call for help (that <i>Bionicle</i> fic springs to mind).</p>

            <p>In particular, the DBS. There&#39;s a lot more potential variety in terms of what author-wraiths can do and the ways in which they fight. I envisage a kind of raid-boss/pseudo-escort endgame for wraiths; you get an extra team member in the form of the freed canon, but you also get a supremely pissed off supernatural entity.<br><br>However, I think a game would, out of necessity, focus on the Floaters. There&#39;s just so much more that you can do with them. Of course, given that this is the PPC we&#39;re talking about, the game would have to be near-unfairly hard and character progression very slow indeed. The two-person limit works well here, too; given the amount of canons and the disparity between them, you can&#39;t really specialise your characters like you would in a more conventional game of this sort. Instead, your characters become jacks-of-all-trades, with a huge number of passive skills and a few actives to keep things interesting. Again, Path Of Exile&#39;s skill system would work brilliantly for agents. =]<br><br>--parp</p>

            <p>Canons and salvageable OCs could be recruited as guest player characters through rescuing them from plot holes or just plain recruiting them. Instead of facing just Sue-wraiths, we may also encounter Replacements, and the plain old Sue. This could apply to many departments.</p>

            <p>I can just think of a lot more ways in which a Sue-wraith can attack through status conditions and interface screws than a Sue or Replacement can. Also, in regards to the first part of your post, I agree that canons and good OCs ought to be recruited. Hell, that just makes it more like the X-COM missions in which you have to rescue a scientist or something.<br><br>Perhaps more of the RTS-style stuff in the overworld could be unlocked as the player progresses in rank. That would mean it had to be a PC-only title, though (at least if you wanted to prevent it sucking hard). It could imply that your team is growing in importance and is able to requisition more shiny things from DoSAT and so forth.<br><br>--parp</p>

            <p>I was thinking on a much smaller scale, as in newbie Game Maker user small-scale. Still, that could work. That could definitely work. You know what, if you want to go and do it, do it big. Let&#39;s make it Multiplayer just for the hell of it.<br><br>Hm. The sudden scene changes could add difficulty to the stealth aspects, now that I think about it.

            <p>I read about this place on TV Tropes, and it&#39;s possibly one of the most meta things ever (whatever that means.) I decided to snoop around the Wiki for a while and read about the universe. Never thought such an organization would be headed by psychic plants. XD<br><br>Oh, and I love the Wayside School reference in the Constitution.<br><br>I have only ever written one story... that I&#39;ve pretty much abandoned midway through. It was possibly so mediocre that nobody even bothered to review it. However, I have done some RP in the past, and I do like me some silly fanfics and the occasional goodfic (like Those Lacking Spines.)<br><br>My favorite fandoms include... Pokemon, Phantasy Star (Online, Universe, and Online 2;) World of Warcraft, Teen Titans, and (for some reason) Maplestory. At least two of those don&#39;t seem to have much fanfiction about them (and Maplestory&#39;s &quot;fan work,&quot; which usually consists of comics and animation, often takes place outside of the Maplestory universe.) I also really like Foster&#39;s Home for Imaginary Friends, Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ed, Edd, &#39;n Eddy.<br><br>If/When I earn a sufficient amount of reputation on this board (enough to reach Exalted- I mean, enough to be permitted to request mission permission,) I&#39;m thinking of sporking either naruto veangance revelaitons or My Little Unicorn: Magic is Believing. I have a bone to pick with &#39;em. Or maybe that WoW fic that KittyNoodles needs help with! And I&#39;ll likely give the PPC its first agent from Maplestory and/or the Phantasy Star series. However, I still need to finish the original series first so I don&#39;t end up creating a sporking that mangles the canon to the point where the mission itself may have to be sporked by a pair of agents. I should probably also read some non-Original Series missions too.<br><br>I should also mention that I&#39;m a rather... odd fanfic reader. For example, I&#39;m one of those people who thinks My Immortal and Pokemon Attack of Mewtwo are hilarious, and that Hans von Hozel is a fracking comedic genius for making a Sailor Moon fanfic about Serena literally sailing to the moon. I actually thrive off of gloriously/hilariously bad fanfics. But there are still plenty of badfics that, to me, are just bad (especially if they&#39;re downright reprehensible, like naruto veangance revelaitons or Cupcakes.)</p>

            <p>I read about a Dwarf Paadin and a nudist Troll on the Wiki. I&#39;ve read about bad in-game RP (especially since I sent 2 characters to Wyrmrest Accord and they now have access to Moon Guard&#39;s Goldshire due to cross-realm zones,) but not about bad WoW fiction.

            <p>but in the badfic (that&#39;s still permission pending) me and my sis have decided to stop at around chap. 14 but there&#39;s this one character called Ciel (no not that one) and though he very much is a Gary Stu in latter parts, we meet him at a part that has him doing very little. <br><br>When we get to him the most charges he has to his name are: introducing a non-canon race into Tokyo mew mew (though by this point he is technically the only one we meet), obviously ripping off another canon character&#39;s name, being the non-canon race&#39;s prince, and having some poor grammar.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what the minimum number is on a charge list to be considered savable (or even the severity) but, well, me and my sis both actually like this character.  Don&#39;t get us wrong, in the latter parts this character is a Gary Stu and is an angsty, ranting jerk. At the same time though, his rants were funny to us (even if we couldn&#39;t understand what he was saying) and he was usually the only one with any emotion to his character, even though it was usually set to angry or angsty.  <br><br>So, can we save this guy?  If we can&#39;t that&#39;s ok, but its better ask and know what to do then to not say a thing and never know you could (or couldn&#39;t).</p>

            <p>Okay, I&#39;ve actually had charge lists where potential Mary Sues/Gary Stus didn&#39;t have enough charges to be charged as such. But that&#39;s not really what you&#39;re asking. What you&#39;re asking is &quot;can we adopt this guy considering where we stop at&quot;.<br><br>Well, consider for a second that, when you first meet the Stu, your agents are thinking of wrapping up that mission. Whenever I get to the point that I want to start wrapping up the mission, you basically tend to disregard anything that comes after that point (unless the main Sue/Stu of it is so epic that the stuff that follows epically fails at everything, but those cases are very, <i>very</i> rare). So at that time, he might be savable on the charge list.<br><br>Again, like bit characters, it depends on author preference.</p>

            <p>Two badfics for you today. <br><p><br>First, in the Calvin &amp; Hobbes fandom, we have a T-rated that should really be M. Simply called &quot;Calvin&amp;Hobbes&quot;, it is a slash fic, with an older Calvin wanting to mate with the aforementioned tiger. Ugh. Interspecies mating. Oh, and it makes no sense.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9965167/1/">www.fanfiction.net/s/9965167/1/</a><br></p>
<p><br>And in Harry Potter, one that may have popped up before. It looks pretty famous, and is called HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. It&#39;s also known as 30 H&#39;s. Well, it really makes no sense. It&#39;s pure, unadulterated crackfic.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2554200/1/">www.fanfiction.net/s/2554200/1/</a><br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s not and never has been bestiality. Whether or not you believe Hobbes to be a real tiger, he&#39;s anthropomorphised to the point where he ceases to become a feral beast.

            <p>I think you may be right about that - though it does raise the question, when kinks are involved, are <i>any</i> of them chargeable? You seem to implicitly agree that there would be something chargeable about a bestiality fic (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong), but there&#39;s a lot of people who find furryism (furrying? furrification? <i>Is</i> there a noun for this?) disgusting, too*. So where do we put that line? I suspect it&#39;s usually around the legal/illegal mark - but that would mean that a few decades ago, we would have been charging for &#39;homosexual intercourse&#39;.<br><br>Thinking about it, it may come down to a consent issue. If a living (or psuedo-living, to cover robots and the like) is the subject of sexual activity, without giving or being able to give consent, that&#39;s wrong, and therefore a charge. If both (beg pardon, all) participants are properly consenting - then the mere fact of the relationship isn&#39;t a charge. The specifics - such as the characters in question - still can be.<br><br>But then we run into the situation that we might be charging something if it&#39;s one character doing it, and saying it&#39;s okay for the next - purely because one is known to do it, and the other isn&#39;t, even if it&#39;s otherwise in-character...<br><br>hS<br><br>*Note that this is not a statement on my feelings, positive, negative, or tangerine-flavoured.</p>

            <p>Personally, I&#39;d leave it up to the PPC author to decide where the line was, both for themselves and their characters. All I&#39;d ask in return is that they remember the wiki&#39;s guidelines regarding YKINMK and have some authorial detachment.<br><br>Fics don&#39;t hurt us. Fics <i>can&#39;t</i> hurt us. They&#39;re just sort of... <i>there</i>, like static interfering with your favourite song on the radio for a moment. Even the worst excesses of bad slash are just bad writing, and while I don&#39;t think kink really should be a factor in deciding what constitutes a charge (hell, dubcon&#39;s a thing, though one I urge you not to Google), I recognise and respect that other people may not feel that way.<br><br>That all said, there is such a thing as badly-written kink. SSC&#39;s a fairly common term in the scene, and for those that aren&#39;t familiar with it, it means safe, sane, and consensual. Kink that does not conform to these within reasonable boundaries? &#39;S&#39;a charge for me. Maybe not for you though, and that&#39;s okay too.<br><br>Different strokes, and so forth.<br><br>--parp</p>

            <p>Not only is that point raised in the theory itself (&quot;The trouble with any attempt by the rebels to do something about the explosion is that the combined mass of the rebel fleet is equal to only a tiny speck of the Death Star&#39;s surface.&quot;), but the place I&#39;ve seen that outcome most recently - one of the <i>X-Wing</i> graphic novels - only shows the immediate aftermath of the destruction. Sure, the Rebels made an effort to intercept the debris... but what happened after they realised it was totally impossible to stop the Holocaust?<br><br>And even if they did - it wouldn&#39;t have helped. Again from the FAQ:<br><br><i><b>Does it matter whether the bulk of the station was vaporised?</b><br><br>No. Material that is turned to vapour does not vanish. Vapour cools rapidly by radiating its heat to space and also by conducting heat to air once it hits the atmosphere. The result of this cooling is that the vapour would recondense as solid soot, like water precipitating as snowflakes. Indeed the margins of the Death Star II explosion appeared sooty before many of the ground troops noticed the fireball. Therefore some condensation began to occur only seconds after the detonation. In any case the explosion shows numerous large tumbling solid fragments, each of which alone is sufficient to cause a global mass-extinction event. In summary, there are two extreme alternatives, and a mixture of intermediate possiblities in between: (1) big solid chunks of the DS impacting on the surface and throwing up fallout dust; or (2) huge volumes of metallic vapour condensing in the atmosphere to give a similar amount of dust.</i><br><br>And yes, it covers being annihilated into energy (gamma-ray burst) and even being displaced into hyperspace, too.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What I meant was I&#39;m pretty sure some canon bigwig (maybe Lucas himself? He likes to squash anything actually /interesting/ about Star Wars) stepped in and definitively stated there was no Endor holocaust no matter what should&#39;ve happened. So we can theorise about the should-haves but that doesn&#39;t matter much if someone in charge of what&#39;s canon or not puts their foot down on it.<br><br>I could be remembering wrong, of course.</p>

            <p>Well, another year has gone, a new one in its place. Now it&#39;s time to celebrate the new holiday by going with some weird superstition of mine!<br><br>As much as I am morbidly fascinated with (and occasionally disgusted by) badfic, for this new year we should bring out the bad and usher in the good. Hopefully, by posting and celebrating goodfic rather then blasting badfic, we will actually find more of the good stuff this year. Hopefully.<br><br>So, what&#39;s my goodfic? I will give you two; one funny, Sue-killing ponyfic, and one awesome and (more) serious Elder Scrolls fic. <br><br>For ponies and bad-OC-killing goodness, I give you: <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/155824/diamond-tiara-hunts-down-and-systematically-murders-bad-ocs"> Diamond Tiara HUnts Down and Systematically Murders Bad OCs </a> Well, what more needs to be said? This is a hilarious fic that reads very much like the Sue-Killing part of a mission, minus some PPC specifics. In fact, I love this so much, even you non-pony fans should read it. It has a very interesting style that would work very, <i>very</i> well for a mission. Just saying. Read it.<br><br>For the Elder Scrolls fic, I have: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3429376/1/Tales-from-Cyrodiil-Not-Even-A-Prayer"> Tales from Cyrodiil: Not Even a Prayer </a> This is set in a slightly AU of Tamriel known as the Tales from Cyrodiil. I say slightly because,really, not much has changed at all, just some reletavely minor details. It is the fifth story set in this universe, and while some details are lost without reading the others, the story holds on its own very well. This follows a paladin of Arkay as she brings the dead to rest, and Necromancers into Death&#39;s clutches, all while followed by a knight of Dibella who only wants to be her friend. It explores the nature of the Aedra, their followers, and how each of the divines are praised in a way the games did not manage to show. A very good fic in a very good seres. While set a few weeks/months after the end of Oblivion, it has tie-ins with Morrowind, due to the main character being from there.

            <p>This fic is short (which always scores points with me) and extremely funny.<br>In it, the world of BBC&#39;s Sherlock gets overrun with zombies. Sherlock brings one home as a test subject. Watson really should have put his foot down about the head in the freezer and prevented escalation.<br>The whole story is told though writings such as texts, emails, blog posts and notes from the different characters and everyone are very recognisable and very British.<br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6253167/1/A_Brief_Account_Of_Life_With_Zombies"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6253167/1/A_Brief_Account_Of_Life_With_Zombies">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6253167/1/A_Brief_Account_Of_Life_With_Zombies</a></a></p>

            <p>These two were written quite some time ago, but I can recommend Those Lacking Spines by Organization VI and Unoriginality 1: An Original Trainer Story by Farla.<br><br>Those Lacking Spines is about the three least popular members of Organization XIII (Xaldin, Vexen, and Lexaeus) going on an adventure through a bizarre place known as Fandom Hearts to save their fellow members, who have been attacked by beings known as the &quot;Gutless&quot; and turned into Ukes (Except for Larxene. The reason why is explained in the story.) (<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2903858/1/Those-Lacking-Spines"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2903858/1/Those-Lacking-Spines">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2903858/1/Those-Lacking-Spines</a></a>)<br><br>The second is a series of short stories that deconstruct various cliches that pop up in Pokemon fanfiction. Examples include Trainer-Sues who get speshul Pokemon for arriving late to Oak&#39;s lab, the unfortunate tendency for trainers who outright despise each other to travel together, and writers who butcher Ralts&#39; Pokedex entry to show how &quot;pure&quot; their trainer&#39;s heart is.

            <p>Short answer: Yes. Yes, they do.<br><br>Long answer: Through some unknown mechanism, the neuralyzer forcibly rearranges neural pathways, at once erasing whatever memories were there before and making the pathways plastic and receptive to new memories for a short period of time. It&#39;s specifically used to erase big, worldview-shattering things (i.e. alien encounters) that even normal, forgetting-prone brains would clamp onto like an alligator doing a death roll. However the subject&#39;s brain would naturally process and store the memories in question is irrelevant.<br><br>Also, Nume has actually been neuralyzed before, repeatedly, by his first partner, who was Not Nice and liked to use it to get her way. I think this is only referenced once in <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/plotholes/plothole03.html">a very early Fill the Plothole story</a> of mine, though, and the event is written so vaguely that it&#39;s probably easy to miss, so it&#39;s not surprising that it&#39;s not common knowledge.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who should get back to writing that prequel story she started this summer.</p>

            <p>And it&#39;s kind of a long story since it involves a species that canonically has perfect memory but is still affected by a neuralyzer. That&#39;s about as simply as I can explain it, though, so... yes. Yes it can.</p>

            <p>In the original canon they come from, neuralyzers work on anybody with the usual human eyes, or something similar. Insectile eyes apparently don&#39;t transmit the neuralyzer flash to the brain.<br><br>My guess is that somebody with a photographic memory would be affected like anyone else, but they would probably be able to detect that something had been changed. The quality of replaced memories might be more vague than they are used to; or they might remember a &quot;time skip&quot;, a gap in memories where the neuralyzer erased them.<br><br>Photographic memory is a strange enough concept in real life. Having an extremely good memory is rare, but useful; being actually unable to forget is almost a handicap. Fictional versions of photographic memory are often in-between those two concepts--someone with such a good memory that they could memorize a page of text with a five-second glance, but not so overwhelming that they are distracted by thoughts of what they had for breakfast seven years ago.<br><br>To determine how the neuralyzer affects someone with a very good memory, or someone with a photographic memory, or someone who is totally unable to forget any experiences they have had, you would probably have to determine why that person has an unusual memory system to begin with, and how it works differently from the usual sort, and work from there.</p>

            <p>It shouldn&#39;t matter at all. The human mind is an incredibly complicated bit of kit; rewriting someone&#39;s memories with a flash of light is completely impossible with our technology, so I&#39;d just call it magitech and assume it does whatever you want it to.</p>

            <p>Mine are as follows in order of importance:<br><br>-Keep to the strict vegetarian thing this year. Getting a job at McDonald&#39;s has resulted in me cheating once or twice out of hunger and the fact that I get it free. Before that, I had been a vegetarian for about six or seven years. Other than that, the stuff&#39;s just terrible for you anyways.<br><br>-Following that, I&#39;d like to keep to an overall healthier diet and work out at least once every other day. Not for weight reasons so much as health ones.<br><br>-Try to keep my house clean. At the very least, my bedroom. It makes my allergies miserable to live with otherwise.<br><br>-Get approved for writing PPC missions. I&#39;ve been a lurker for far too long, and its time to stop being so shy.</p>
