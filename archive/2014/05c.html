            <p>I hope this is entertaining or inspiring.<br><br>My mother became a widow roughly a year from when I got married.  I think I managed to be more moved-out than not by thirty.  That was almost five years ago.  She still has the huge house.<br><br>I am visiting her right now, and I still have a bleep-ton of bleep here.  We began in her dump-and-run room.  (Basically any room of the house that you walk into less than once per month.)  A lot of the stuff I found that had been mine was already stuff I declared her problem last time I was here.  (Toys to give to other children, art supplies that I declared abandoned...)<br><br>I can&#39;t look at her storage rooms.  I can find the path and grab a nearby box, but I cannot comprehend the mess and not freak at the same time.  I did pick out that there were 3.24 disks and found one from the first box to stick into the computer, even though I should assume that everything is demagnetized.  (My uncle&#39;s financial records from 1996 we mangled instead of stuck in the electronic recycling box as a joke.)<br><br>I went through my ponies and just couldn&#39;t declare &quot;take these to the thrift store.&quot;  I had some that I remembered loving, but I don&#39;t have room for them at home.  I picked out the two that looked like they had mold and stuck the rest back into storage.<br><br>Protip: it takes a lot of work and stirring to destroy sheafs of documents, almost as much effort as shredding.<br><br></p>

            <p>My grandfather practically lived in our unfinished basement, and we just kind of let it sit for about two years after he died.<br>He literally never threw out a sheet of paper in his 40-some odd years of working down there. Cleaning up was overwhelming but it happened. There was an old whiteboard down there that still had a message on it that I wrote when I was five. <br>A lot of stuff all in one place is hard to face and not freak out; just keep your chin up and try to keep positive, basically.<br>Good luck! You might find a few more gems from when you were younger.</p>

            <p>...I&#39;d recommend reading Jules Verne&#39;s novels, especially <i>Vingt mille lieues sous les mers</i> and <i>L&#39;île mystérieuse</i> (in that order!). Also worth reading is <i>De la Terre à la Lune</i> because big freakin&#39; guns shooting stuff into space is way cool.</p>

            <p>Sorry about that, everybody. Due to a combination of finals preparation for the first few days and computer troubles for a while after that, I&#39;ve been pretty much blacked out of the Internet for the past week or so. I am decidedly not dead, though, and I&#39;ll get right back to betaing the things I couldn&#39;t finish last time.<br><br>...Is it egotistical that I&#39;m kind of touched that multiple people noticed I was missing? Well, maybe &quot;touched&quot; is the wrong word, but &quot;pleased&quot; would <i>definitely</i> make me sound egotistical.</p>

            <p>I know it has not been that long since my last attempt at getting Permission, but since then, I have been doing a lot of reading and a lot of research. And I do believe that I am ready now.<br><br>Here are my agents again.<br><br>Agent #1) <br><br>Name: Spencer Ellis<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 32<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Sky blue<br>- Hair: Light brown, short and combed<br>- Height: Average<br>Additional Features:<br>- He is rather fat, but not morbidly obese<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br>Personality: He is highly focused on academics, has greater need for dominance, leadership and attention than is usual, and he prefers initiating activity. He is very detail oriented, and can therefore catch things about someone&#39;s personality that others wouldn&#39;t based on small bits of evidence. He can learn very quickly, and he feels uncomfortable without a detailed plan laid out. He therefore is strongly agitated whenever someone doesn&#39;t follow the plan. Likewise, he becomes irritated whenever someone does something without telling him first. He holds the emotional needs of others in very low consequence, and is therefore not generally liked among the other, rather mentally unstable Agents. However, he hates losing someone during a mission and will obssess over their overall safety. Lastly, he holds views of Mary Sues that border on racism, constantly blaming Agent Bessie for the team&#39;s shortcomings and misfortunes and calling her a Mary Sue.<br><br>Backstory: Spencer Ellis and Melvin Moore were both lawyers in Maycomb County, Alabama, alongside their peer, Atticus Finch, in a To Kill a Mockingbird fanfic. One particular case, the Case of Marietta Crocker, drew the attention of a pair of assassins from the PPC, who proceeded to kill the Mary Sue, Marietta Crocker, in the county jail.<br><br>Fascinated by their methods, Ellis and Moore decided to join the PPC. While Moore decided to apply for a job in the Department of Internal Affairs, Ellis tried out for a position in The Legal Department, but was turned down because he &quot;wasn&#39;t what they were looking for&quot;. <br><br>Dissatisfied with this, Ellis joined various Departments- the Department of Plagiarism, the Department of Technical Errors, and eventually the Department of Finance- but was fired for various reasons, such as the inability to play well with others and attempting to get directly involved in missions he was not given. He eventually got a desk job in the Department of Finance, but deeply hated that he was not &quot;doing his Duty&quot;.<br><br><br>Agent #2)<br><br>Name: A. W. &quot;Bessie&quot; Besserdchenney<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 21<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Unremarkable Brown<br>- Hair color: Brown, shoulder length<br>- Height: A little short for her age<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br>Personality: She has a playful wit that she uses to either pull elaborate pranks on people or make fun of them. However, this does not make her intelligent, and she is prone to foolhardy moves in combat. She tries to stick to a strict code of honor; she will not fight an unarmed opponent, unless they show that they are capable of fighting her unarmed; she will not kill innocent civilians, unless they are non sentient; she will not kick someone while they are down or running away, unless they are a Mary Sue; she will not abandon people she is close to or feel need her. She is unaware that she was a Mary Sue in a previous life, and takes offense whenever someone calls her one. She speaks in bad Shakespearean English. <br><br>Abilities: A powerhouse duelist, she has an almost perfect balance of agility and strength, which she employs with brutal ferocity in battle. Her Kampilon sword is sharp, her armor is hard, and she can learn from her mistakes and successes. <br><br>Backstory: The character that would come to be known as Bessie originated in an unnamed Shakespeare Suefic. She was captured by PPC agents Plank and Wells, and her story was destroyed because of its mechanics and horrible geography and flora and fauna.<br><br>The experiments that Plank performed on her worked, if only in part, and Plank insisted that she be inducted as an Agent, despite various protests from a vocal minority in the PPC that Bessie, as she was now called, was not fully de-Sued. <br><br>However, Bessie did become an Agent, and her first job was with the Disturbing Acts of Violence Department, Action Division. She participated in several classified assignments, and earned some respect from her fellow agents.<br><br>However, she was removed from the Department due to her overly violent outbursts resulting from massive consumption of Flaming Balrog after missions. She was sent to the Medical Department, where she had a six week recovery period, and which sent her to the Character Protective Services upon orders from the Flowers.<br><br>It was during this time that Bessie became infatuated by various Harry Potter and Twilight characters. <br><br>After a distinguished mission in which Bessie saved Sirius Black from a Mary Sue Death Eater, she was transfered to the Department of Mary Sues as an assassin.<br><br><br>Agent #3)<br><br>Name: Vivian Elsa Wells<br><br>Species: Human <br><br>Age: 29<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Brown<br>- Hair: Dirty blonde, blown back so that it sticks up<br>- Height: Average<br><br>Department : Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br>Abilities: Aside from her extensive knowledge of animals, plants, land masses and time paradoxes, Wells possesses a strange ability to run at superhuman speeds, which may or may not be connected with the capsules she eats.<br><br>Personality: Vivian Wells is a woman with a manic and unruly personality. She really enjoys physical activities that involve her use of her insane bursts of speed, such as racing people. She also loves junk food, and adores the color pink, unicorns, and throwing parties. She goes into long talks about strictly feminine activities, such as cooking, fashion misshaps, the attractiveness of other female Agents, etc. She also likes to go shopping whenever she can, but at the same time she is wise with her money, usually only buying things that she thinks will be useful in some way. She likes to make fun of people when she knows it won&#39;t hurt their feelings too much. She likes playing pranks. She has mastered the puppy face, notably being able to use it to sway the stubborn and resilient Ellis on several occasions, and can sometimes whine and complain when she doesn&#39;t get her way. Concerning her extensive knowledge, she has trouble recalling what she knows due in large part to her perpetual adrenaline surge. Whenever something happens to someone she is close to, she gets very worried.<br><br>Backstory: Previously a member of the Official Fanfiction University of the Twilight Saga, Vivian Wells joined the PPC as a member of the Department of Floaters. However, she quickly gained a vast career, joining various Departments, such as Geographical Abberations, Misplaced Flora and Fauna, Bad Slash and Temporal Offenses. <br><br>Unfortunately, it was during her tenure in the Department of Temporal Offenses that she became clinically depressed, due to her getting stuck in a Temporal distortion.<br><br>She was helped out of her depression by Agent Plank, who gave her an experimental formula that increases her reflexes and speed after her recovery. After this time, she joined Agent Plank on the field, eventually capturing Bessie.<br><br>Wells then faced a troubling time in her life. Because of his exposure to a particularly powerful Mary Sue, Bessie, Plank began to contract Suemonia. However, instead of the usual effects, it began to drive him insane with obsession and self destructive tendencies.<br><br><br>Agent #4)<br><br>Name: Alfred Plank<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 59<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Grey<br>- Hair: White and messy<br>- Height: Slightly above average<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sue Experimentation and Research<br><br>Abilities: Aside from being a crack shot with a Phaser and an ambitious inventer, Plank is a veteran agent with a highly developed understanding of Mary Sues and Sue Wraiths.<br><br>Personality: He has a scientific curiosity in all things to do with Mary Sues, going beyond normal boundaries and even coming across as obsessive and pushy. He takes risks that most other scientists wouldn&#39;t take, partly because he is going senile. He considers Mary Sues to be very nearly sentient, but lacking a few crucial personality traits. When he contracted Suemonia, he became borderline obsessed with finding a cure.<br><br>Backstory: Little is known about his early life, except that he probably came from a Star Trek fanfic. What is known is that he joined the PPC back when it was called the Organization. During his time in the Department of Floaters, he began showing an aptitude for using chemical components as weapons. Because of this, he was made an assassin in the Department of Mary Sues. <br><br>He went through several partners, all of whom have apparently been killed in action. It was then that he met a clinically depressed Agent Vivian Wells, who he helped recover and with whom he began a father- daughter relationship. After her depression was averted, he gave Wells a formula he invented to increase her reflexes and speed.<br><br>This began a successful partnership between the two, until nearly five years later, when the PPC discovered a badfic that has since been wiped out. The target Mary Sue was captured instead of killed so that Plank could study Mary Sue psychology and learn new ways to alter their minds.<br><br>Because of his contact with Bessie, Plank began to become Sued, which began turning him into the very thing he was most fascinated by. He started taking Bleepium, a serum of his own design meant to block out entire aspects of one&#39;s personality. <br><br>To this day, he strives to find a true cure for Mary Sues.<br><br><br>Okay, now for the writing prompts. Please keep in mind that for some reason, my Bold option isn&#39;t working, so until I fix it, the Sunflower Official will be speaking inside these- **.<br><br>Control Prompt- &quot;Mission Assignment&quot;<br><br>*Don&#39;t you agents ever knock?* The Sunflower Official &quot;demanded&quot;, crossing its tendrils.<br><br>Agent Ellis grunted impatiently. He was in a bad mood since the previous mission and really did not want to take any attitude from anyone, not even the Flowers. &quot;Just cut to the chase. What do ya have for us?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Be nice, big guy.&quot; Wells scolded him.<br><br>&quot;Did you just call me fat?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thou art rather fulsome, Ellis.&quot; Bessie chimed in.<br><br>&quot;Shut up, Bessie!&quot;<br><br>What followed was an extremely loud argument. The Sunflower Official remained silent until the tumult subsided. *May I debrief you now?*<br><br>Ellis was breathing heavily, his face a rather unhealthy red. Wells, who had continued her onslaught of fat jokes a few moments ago, was sitting cross legged on the Sunflower Official&#39;s desk with a victorious smirk. Bessie, however, appeared entirely unfazed by the recent argument, as if it had never happened. <br><br>*Good. Now, here is your mission report.* It reached its tendrils toward a stack of files, and pulled one out, labeled &quot;&#39;The Daughter&#39;s Tale&#39;, Chronicles of Narnia Fanfic, Certified Suefic, Agent George Sanfield.&quot;<br><br>The Sunflower Official offered it to Ellis, who took it from &quot;him&quot; and began reading it. &quot;Daughter of Aslan, animals love her- Dadgummit, I could write a charge list right now.&quot;<br><br>*That&#39;s good. You will need it. This Sue is going to be very powerful, so you should prepare accordingly. We don&#39;t want a repeat of your last mission, do we?*<br><br>&quot;Got it, SO.&quot; Wells told him cheerfully, climbing off the desk and following her teammates to the door.<br><br>*Oh, and Ellis.*<br><br>&quot;Yeah?&quot; He did not turn his head.<br><br>*Agent Plank has missed yet another appointment at Medical. Would you inform him that Doctor Fitzgerald orders him to come in for his check up?*<br><br>&quot;Sure, sure. Now, I&#39;m gonna leave your office.&quot;<br><br>*That would be preferable.* <br><br><br><br>Random Prompt- &quot;One Agent incorrectly accuses another of something&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why wouldst thou accuse me of such a despicable prank?&quot; Bessie demanded, shaking in her armor with indignation.<br><br>&quot;Who else would have Neuralized me, huh?!&quot; Ellis roared. &quot;Your kind are always the enemies of the PPC.&quot;<br><br>This insensitive comment caused Bessie &#39; s face to flush. &quot;What meanst thou?!&quot;<br><br>&quot;That is not how ya say it, Bessie!&quot;<br><br>At that moment, Wells burst through the door, her hands occupied with shopping bags of mission-worthy equipment, non perishable goods, and other brand new knickknacks. <br><br>&quot;Hi, guys!&quot; she exclaimed happily, adjusting the pink sunglasses she had bought. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll tell ya what&#39;s up!&quot; Ellis rounded on her. &quot;When I woke up this morning, I came out here to tidy up after you two. I never want you two in here again without my permission, by the way. But there&#39;s about an hour where I can&#39;t remember where I was or what I did, and my Neuralizer is gone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And he believes that I hath stolen it!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course it was you!&quot; Ellis bellowed. &quot;I know that it was you! Ya shifty Mary Sue! I&#39;m goin&#39; to the Sunflower Official right now! Yer not allowed ta use dadgum Neuralizers on agents, you-&quot; But he cut himself off as he slammed the door behind him.<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s going to go complain to the Flowers, isn&#39;t he?&quot; Wells asked Bessie casually as they stared at the area where Ellis used to be.<br><br>&quot;Most certainly.&quot; Bessie now stared at Wells, suspicious. &quot;From whence did thou acquire the money for all those possessions?&quot;<br><br>Wells smiled mischievously. &quot;I convinced Ellis to part with it.&quot; She put down one of the shopping bags and pulled out a Neuralizer.<br><br>This any better than my last attempt? (I hope so. Last time was, admittedly, not very good.) Constructive criticism is, of course welcome. Permission Givers, please don&#39;t keep me waiting too long. I&#39;m so excited! </p>

            <p>Disclaimer: I&#39;ve read Neshomeh&#39;s replies, but not repeatedly, and I&#39;m not opening them while I write this.

Perhaps you mean &#39;<i>former</i> Mary Sues&#39;?<br><br>You claim that Spencer was fired from the Department of Finance, and in the next line you claim he &#39;eventually&#39; got a job there. You also specify &#39;desk job&#39;, when I happen to know I pointed out that every DoF job is a desk job. And you don&#39;t explain how someone who&#39;s been kicked out of Plagiarism and DTE managed to move from Finance to the DMS.<br><br><u>Bessie</u><br><br>Her &#39;strict code of honour&#39; seems to be... er... not being a cartoon villain. &#39;Egads! This girl doesn&#39;t ruthlessly attack defenceless people, slaughter the innocent, kick &#39;em while they&#39;re down, or abandon her friends? Get me the phone number for the Vatican, we need to nominate her for sainthood!&#39; No.<br><br>No-one has ever called her a Mary Sue, had her object, and then pointed out that no, she actually is? In the <i>PPC</i>, home of nitpicking? I find that hard to believe.<br><br>I&#39;m aware that she speaks bad Shakespearean English because you can&#39;t write it properly. That&#39;s a terrible idea, it really is. Among other things, it means she will never be able to <i>stop</i> - because you can&#39;t write the &#39;fixed&#39; version.<br><br>In her Personality you claim &#39;she is prone to foolhardy moves in combat&#39;. In her Abilities, you claim she&#39;s an excellent fighter who learns from her mistakes. Mismatch much?<br><br>How can a badfic be &#39;unnamed&#39;? I assume you mean &#39;I&#39;m not going to give a name&#39;, but that&#39;s far from the same thing, and this is the second assumption I&#39;ve had to make.<br><br>Where did these &#39;classified assignments&#39; come from? PPC missions aren&#39;t classified - what would be the point? If you&#39;re suggesting something outside missions, fine, but I hope you have a good explanation for them being given to a rookie.<br><br><b>You are still treating the move from DCPS to DMS as a promotion</b>. I&#39;ve asked twice now why you&#39;re doing that, and you haven&#39;t answered either time. It&#39;s disrespectful to the agents of Character Protective Services to treat them as &#39;people who aren&#39;t good enough to be assassins yet&#39;.<br><br><u>Vivian Wells</u><br><br>(I&#39;ll look at your &#39;changed up&#39; Personality section here)<br><br>Still a hyperactive fangirl (which, again, could be interesting). I&#39;m dubious about her being able to sway &#39;doesn&#39;t care about people&#39;s emotions&#39; Ellis with her puppy-dog eyes, though. Also, &#39;She likes to make fun of people when she knows it won&#39;t hurt their feelings too much&#39;? That doesn&#39;t sound so much like &#39;make fun of&#39;, which is an act that <i>does</i> hurt people&#39;s feelings.<br><br>Depression after getting stuck in a temporal distortion sounds unlikely. That seems more like it would cause a phobia than depression. Also, since she&#39;s fully recovered, why have you even left it in? You know from the last thread that it&#39;s sticky ground to walk on.<br><br>Why did Wells accept the &#39;experimental formula&#39;? This is post-depression, so she just... took random drugs from Plank? According to your description, an <i>addictive</i> drug. Er... why hasn&#39;t he been fired, if he&#39;s handing out physiology-altering addictive drugs to random people? Because that&#39;s a really bad idea.<br><br><u>Plank</u><br><br>How does his &#39;scientific curiosity&#39; in &#39;Sues go beyond normal boundaries? PPC Assassins <i>kill</i> them. One DMSE&amp;R agent cheerfully chopped a finger off a still-alive &#39;Sue. What are you claiming he does <i>beyond</i> that?<br><br>He did not join the PPC back when it was called the Organisation. No non-Flowers were in the Organisation. The first non-Flower, Makes-Things, joined about ten years after the name change.<br><br>The Department of Floaters is relatively new, but you seem to be implying Plank joined them at the beginning. That&#39;s flatly impossible - they postdate his joining by a good twenty years.<br><br>His relationship with Wells is... seriously messed up. &#39;He began a father-daughter relationship&#39; with someone he was treating (unauthorised) as a patient. He gave his &#39;daughter&#39; <i>addictive drugs</i>.<br><br>You seem to be implying, sort of, that Plank&#39;s decision to capture Bessie led to his transfer to the DMSE&amp;R. I can see that, though again, you&#39;ve left me no choice but to start making assumptions. You haven&#39;t explained why &#39;spends time around Mary Sue&#39; led to Plank starting to <i>turn into</i> one. Again, I could make assumptions, but I&#39;m tired of doing that.<br><br>You claim he&#39;s &#39;going senile&#39; - at 59, which seems unlikely, particularly for a <i>Star Trek</i> character. You don&#39;t tie this to the Bleepium that&#39;s blocking half his mind off, even though it looks like you were thinking it.<br><br>I do like the idea of &#39;DMSE&amp;R researcher becomes convinced Mary Sues can be cured&#39;. In fact, I like the basic <i>idea</i> of all four of your agents. But it seems like every single one of the details either flags up as wrong, or seriously disturbs me.<br><br><u>Control Prompt</u><br><br>Using *asterisks* to mimic the <i>italics</i> of the Flowers is an acceptable substitution. But don&#39;t call it &#39;bold&#39;.<br><br>The SO is... closer to IC, but not quite there. And he also makes several bizarre mistakes: he says &#39;debrief&#39; when he means &#39;brief&#39;, and &#39;here is your mission report&#39;; both of those create the impression that it&#39;s a <i>previous mission</i> under discussion.<br><br>I also can&#39;t imagine why he hasn&#39;t commented on Wells sitting on his desk.<br><br>Ellis&#39; &#39;accent&#39; wanders a <i>lot</i>. You go from &#39;Did you just call me fat?&#39; in this to &#39;Yer not allowed ta use dadgum Neuralizers on agents&#39; in the next piece. If you want a verbal quirk, it has to be consistent. And this is miles away from it.<br><br>I can&#39;t really see the SO saying something is &#39;good&#39;.<br><br>And... why is the SO passing messages from Medical to the DMSE&amp;R via an assassin? That&#39;s... the most complicated way you could possibly do that.<br><br><u>Random Prompt</u><br><br>This highlights the fact that Bessie should <i>really</i> know she&#39;s a former &#39;Sue by now. People keep <i>saying it to her face</i>, you&#39;d think she&#39;d get the hint.<br><br>&#39;I never want you two in here again without my permission, by the way.&#39; Not only is this a very bizarre statement - it&#39;s their <i>Response Centre</i>, they live there - but it&#39;s inserted into the paragraph pretty much at random.<br><br>Neuralysers don&#39;t work like that. You have presented it as:<br><br>-Leaving a hole in his memory<br>-Allowing Wells to &#39;persuade&#39; Ellis to give her money, despite the fact that that&#39;s the last thing he seems likely to do.<br><br>A neuralyser wipes your memory of a specific period of time and fills it in - or lets you fill it in - with false memories. So what you&#39;re saying happened is:<br><br>-Ellis comes out to clean the RC.<br>-Wells joins him.<br>-Wells persuades him to give her money, or outright steals it.<br>-Wells persuades him to give her his neuralyser, or outright steals it.<br>-Wells neuralyses him and tells him &#39;you don&#39;t remember the last hour&#39;.<br>-Wells gets out of the RC fast enough that Ellis doesn&#39;t notice her leaving.<br><br>That... ain&#39;t a likely series of events, is what I&#39;m saying.<br><br>And... overall, there&#39;s something seriously missing from these writing samples: humour. You just have... people saying things. The closest you seem to come to trying to be funny is &#39;ha ha fat jokes&#39; and &#39;ha ha Wells tricked him&#39;. But they don&#39;t come across as funny.<br><br>Seriously. Go back and read your Control sample. It contains roughly 33 sentences. Count how many you think contain any humour at all. I don&#39;t think it will be many.<br><br><u>Conclusion</u><br><br>In addition to all the above statements, your punctuation is erratic - &#39;*Don&#39;t you agents ever knock?* The Sunflower Official &quot;demanded&quot;,&#39; and &#39;&quot;Be nice, big guy.&quot; Wells scolded him.&#39; are both examples of this.<br><br>And... I mean, if I was just having to ask questions about background details - even foreground details - I could accept it simply as &#39;Dark Brother 16 isn&#39;t very good at writing bios&#39;, which wouldn&#39;t be surprising, because it&#39;s a useless skill that very few people have. But I&#39;ve been throwing out factual errors, seriously disturbing ideas, and impossibilities left, right, and centre. So, with regret, I&#39;m going to have to say Permission Denied.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Somewhere in that post, I mentioned that writing bios is a hard and mostly useless skill. Shortly thereafter, while working on the Permission Request Statistics <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nzmYkocbdqIUA27LupfDUk9v9wMMeUkiqUMEXNYjoP8/edit?usp=sharing">(which is still a thing)</a>, I ran across a 2011 thread on the subject:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmBqT7Icn8igdG54bXZJRDRacXhYNkE2a2U1MDRXN1E&amp;usp=sharing&amp;disco=AAAAAHZKGng#gid=0">This thing</a> (may take a while to find the correct point in the doc; it&#39;s Bluesunnyday&#39;s Permission request, if the link fails)<br><br>In the course of that discussion, my wife said a few things that struck me:<br><br><i>Way back when dinosaurs roamed the Board, the very first Permission Givers <i>were</i> very informal.  If someone requested Permission, the PGs would do a quick check for serious systematic grammatical problems, maybe ask for a quick description of the proposed agents to be sure they weren&#39;t horrific &#39;Sues, and then they&#39;d usually give Permission.  I can only think of a few occasions where they turned someone down, and it was for enormous, glaring problems.  And people weren&#39;t required to clock a certain number of hours before they were permitted to perform the sacred rite of Requesting Permission.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t an audition, it wasn&#39;t an initiation, it wasn&#39;t a huge deal.  If you take a look at the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/rules.html">guidelines</a> Jay and Acy set up, they&#39;re light, concise, and completely non-threatening.</i><br><br><i>However, the movement from the original requests -- use our gadgets, use our naming structure, run a spell check -- to a month-long personal audition is a leap.  If someone can communicate clearly, their Agents pass the sniff test, and they&#39;ve read a few good missions, they deserve Permission.</i><br><br><i>I certainly agree the PPC should have standards.  But if it were up to me, I would probably empahsise the need for thoughtful, high-quality concrit after publication, rather than emphasising the preventative measures beforehand.  The PPC could meet newbies where they are, help them improve, and it would feel more inclusive.</i><br><br>This led to a rather large discussion which resulted in... scrapping the hard one-month time limit, and nothing else.<br><br>(Another comment from that thread, from Neshomeh this time: <i>Capitalizing &quot;permission.&quot; It&#39;s a simple little thing, and I&#39;m fond of it, but perhaps it needs to go. Only really important things get capitalized.</i>)<br><br>I know, I know: I&#39;ve just driven through a massive shift in how we grant Permission, I should sit on Laurel and relax (though she probably wouldn&#39;t appreciate it). But I had an idea. An idea I really like.<br><br>How about we scrap everything?<br><br>No, no, wait, come back! It&#39;s not what it sounds like.<br><br>Some people are happy with what we&#39;ve got. They don&#39;t want to do a lot of writing and have to scrap it, they like to be able to lay out their agents in full bio form. And that&#39;s great. I&#39;m not suggesting we get rid of Permission 3.0.3. But I <i>am</i> suggesting we make it one half of an either/or, <i>one</i> method of getting Permission. The other method being:<br><br>Write your first mission. Get it beta&#39;d, edited, everything. Post it on the Board as your, oh, PerMission. A Permission Giver will read it, and give concrit. If they say Permission Denied, take the mission back down and rewrite it, start from scratch, switch to the other method, whatever. It won&#39;t be part of the PPC canon. If they say Permission <i>Granted</i>, then follow the concrit (post-publishing editing should be encouraged!), but leave it up. It&#39;s now part of the PPC canon, can go on the Wiki, and you can work on your next one.<br><br>This method solves several problems all at once. It increases the number of missions being written (even if, inevitably, some of them are <i>bad</i> missions). It encourages a culture of both betaing (which I suggest making a requirement, not a suggestion) and concrit - giving <i>and</i> accepting. It encourages improvement even of published missions. It allows you to &#39;show, don&#39;t tell&#39; your agents&#39; personalities, your knowledge of the PPC - all the things we&#39;re looking for.<br><br>It even allows things like Pippa&#39;s idea of using only free-to-use agents - because by writing a full mission, you&#39;ll show whether you <i>can</i> use them. It de-ritualises Permission (a &#39;no&#39; would become &#39;please rewrite your mission&#39;, which is what we&#39;d say to anyone who wrote a bad one) while keeping it as a hard barrier around the PPC canon. It lets people demonstrate that yes, they can comment both critically and amusingly on a badfic (which the current process doesn&#39;t). It ensures that people who get Permission <i>are</i> willing to spend the time to, y&#39;know, write missions. And it ensures that every first mission serves as a high-quality introduction to the agents in it.<br><br>Like I say, I&#39;m not suggesting full replacement. Writing an entire story when you know you might be told to scrap all the characters can be hard - it depends on how you feel about writing. But I <i>do</i> think it could be a viable alternate method - perhaps even a stronger one.<br><br>So: what do you think?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a bit divided on this idea. Part of my reticence comes from my dissatisfaction with the mission system itself. It&#39;s far too easy for writers to get themselves stuck in the rut of &quot;Go into badfic. Snark. Complain. Snark. Rage. Remove bad elements. Snark. Leave.&quot; Giving prospective Permissioners the option of jumping right into missions seems like a good way of just digging the rut deeper. The new Permission method that the Board came up with had seemed to me like a good and vaguely challenging way of broadening the kinds of stories that could be found in the PPC. Or rather it did until I read more and more posts of people cherry-picking their prompts and then complaining about the whole process.<br><br>There was also your saying that &quot;<i>It increases the number of missions being written (even if, inevitably, some of them are bad missions).</i>&quot; I&#39;m not sure quantity over quality is something that works all that well for the PPC.<br><br>That being said, anything that helps further &quot;<i>a culture of both betaing... and concrit</i>&quot; is a major plus in my book. The bio method of presenting agents has always felt a bit silly to me; like you said, I&#39;d rather be shown what I need to know about a character rather than told. And if a short story can tell me something about writer, then a full mission can tell me a lot more.<br><br>I suppose I&#39;d tentatively support such a proposal. (Promising more betaing and concrit goes a long way with me, apparently.) Still, I&#39;d like to see how well it plays out in practice before saying whether or not PerMissions should be an actual thing.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>Perhaps one of the guidelines for a permission mission could be a slice-of life either from the list of 36 or whatever you can make up.<br><br>Perhaps there could be an anti-rutting rule that a certain percent of the stories be slice-of-life rather than missions.

            <p>I think that PerMissions would be a very good idea. Being a neophyte to fanfic writing myself, I know that sometimes the act of writing in and of itself helps a writer to confront the questions of characterization, tone, etc. Having a PerMission alternative sounds like a good idea to me.</p>

            <p>Or, Neshomeh&#39;s Totally Predictable Response.<br><br>Can we please keep in mind that the system we have grew up for a reason? Back in J&amp;A&#39;s day, they were in the process of <i>creating</i> a culture based on everyone&#39;s shared experiences in the LotR fandom, specifically the subculture of fanfiction.net. We are now in the state of <i>preserving</i> the culture. The rules are naturally going to be different. When people started coming in from TV Tropes and other non-fanfic-writing backgrounds, it became necessary to teach them the culture they were missing before they could jump in.

            <p>Weird stress reaction aside, here&#39;s what I think are the potential pros and cons.<br><br>PerMission Pros:<br><br>* Less formal, more inviting; more people might apply if they had this option.<br>* Shows how the person will actually write missions.<br>* Shows who the characters are rather than describing them in a bio.<br>* Encourages more beta-reading and concrit.<br>* More writing happens.<br><br>PerMission Cons:<br><br>* The current (new) system already solves the problem of showing vs. telling about the characters; that&#39;s what the prompts are for.<br>* Missions take more work to write.<br>* Missions take more work to read and evaluate.<br>* Lack of serious betas.

Nothing we can do to stop them.<br>* Can&#39;t make an omelet without breaking eggs and getting it all over your hands so you have to wash them before you can touch things again, and oh damn, there&#39;s some on the counter, too, now I have to clean that up...

            <p>To the cons, naturally:<br><br><i>* The current (new) system already solves the problem of showing vs. telling about the characters; that&#39;s what the prompts are for.</i><br>True - but things like, in this very thread, Wells having previously suffered from depression and now being on speed are still being told, not shown. Also, this is more of a pro of Permission 3, not a con of PerMission 4. ;)<br><br><i>* Missions take more work to write.</i><br>Again, true - but it&#39;s what people are going to be doing. Someone who doesn&#39;t want to put in the work to write a mission... er... doesn&#39;t need Permission, because they&#39;re not writing missions. :D If what you mean is &#39;which is work you may have to scrap and redo&#39;, then yes, that&#39;s true. That&#39;s the main reason I&#39;m suggesting parallel systems, rather than straight replacement.<br><br><i>* Missions take more work to read and evaluate.</i><br>Also true - but a <i>bad</i> mission will probably not require reading to the end. It may well be that the hallmark of a successful PerMission is that the PG reads right to the end. ;)<br><br><i>* Lack of serious betas. (In my experience, plenty of people are willing to skim for obvious SPaG issues, but not so many are willing to grapple with major structural concerns of the sort that require cutting and/or rewriting to fix.)</i><br>This could well be a problem - but surely that&#39;s an opportunity to improve, not a problem? I mean, we <i>want</i> all PPC members to be expert writers-slash-betas-slash-reviewers, no? So something which promotes that is good? ^-^<br><br><i>* People could leave up bad missions and we wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything about it.</i><br>True - but people could post NC-17 smut labelled as PPC missions and we couldn&#39;t do anything about it. They could start Facebook groups and we couldn&#39;t do anything about it (just for example... o<em>o). One possible &#39;solution&#39; to this - as a general problem - is to expand the role of the Wiki. If we state that <i>all</i> &#39;canon&#39; agents have to be listed on the Wiki, then any post-2013 missions featuring non-wiki&#39;d agents can be safely ignored. (Alternately, a category for &#39;uncanonical&#39; agents could be set up - which would also let people build their wiki page before they have Permission. See? Opportunities!)<br><br><i>* This is sort of a free pass to start writing a mission whenever you feel like it, even if you still have to wait to actually ask for Permission. This could cause (more) confusion over what&#39;s allowed before Permission and what&#39;s not.</i><br>True, and that&#39;s probably the main argument against it. However... I have this sneaky suspicion a lot of people do that anyway. Certainly we have a lot of first missions which come out the equivalent of six months after the wedding. :&lt;br&gt;<br><i>* Quantity should not be preferred over quality.</i><br>Absolutely - but if we&#39;re talking an extra 24 missions a year, half of which are good quality, and the other half of which are immediately discarded or rewritten (ie, treating Permission Requests as a sort of semi-open beta), then I&#39;m not sure that issue arises. Certainly a higher quantity of the same (high) quality is good, right? ^</em>~<br><br>[A smiley in every response... yep, fun]<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As many of us can attest to, missions take a long time to write. As such, we&#39;ll have many more fics that are claimed than we do now. Now, this isn&#39;t necessarily a problem, but it could potentially be.<br>My suggestion is that we put a wait period on when you can clam badfic. Since the wiki already makes you wait a few days, ten I believe, before you can edit the List of Unclaimed Bafic. I think this is reasonable, and it stands as a way to stop newbies from saying, &quot;Hi, my name is X, and I found the Board through ABC. Also, I want to start my Permission right away, so here&#39;s the fic I want to claim.&quot; <br>Giving newbies a little time to acclimate and decide how they want to participate in the PPC is what we&#39;re already doing, to a degree, so I don&#39;t think this would be too much to ask of newbies, but I&#39;m not a PG, so you guys obviously know better if this could work than I do.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of there being more than one path to permission.  Just looking at the 36 random prompts, I dispensed with the dice and read them at random until I found something that I could see my agents doing.

            <p>A huge smile broke over my face while reading this. I only wish I hadn&#39;t finished writing my Permission request… (I&#39;m just editing it now) but that sounds GREAT! But maybe, I think a few days of getting to know somebody, maybe until they could edit the Unclaimed/Claimed Badfic articles. Then, they could ask. As you said before, we don&#39;t want people putting their introduction post right before they ask for Permission. Maybe a few days - a week of just chatting on the Board, then they ask for Permission?<br>Oh, also… Should I post my Permission Request, or should I write a mission, now? (I was actually planning on posting it later today. &gt;.</p>

            <p>Well seeing as this is only a suggestion and not an actual change I&#39;d assume that you&#39;ve still got to go through the new-old way of asking for Permission (as in doing the request, not writing a mission). <br><br>Hope that helps<br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>The current Permission-with-a-capital-P setup is not something I consider necessary or useful to the operation of this group. It feels unwieldy, and it gives more fuel to the idea that we&#39;re nothing but a bunch of hidebound neckbeards who crap all over someone else&#39;s work because it doesn&#39;t meet arbitrary definitions of goodfic. I&#39;m not a fan, is what I&#39;m trying to convey here.<br><br>The way hS suggests we operate here is much, much easier to make work, for a lot less effort on the part of people who&#39;ve already got Permission. It encourages a collaborative, helpful culture rather than a standoffish, isolationist one; while we&#39;re not completely insular, I think the PPC could stand to be a bit less daunting for potential writers than it currently is. To give you an idea of what I&#39;m talking about, I was worried I&#39;d be laughed out of the Board if I even <i>attempted</i> a permission check, and I&#39;m a published art critic. We need to create a nurturing atmosphere on the Board, because I think that&#39;ll help people stick around and write more missions in general. I&#39;d be interested to see the activity statistics of users that get denied permission.<br><br>tl;dr: the PPC is intimidating, and I don&#39;t think it needs to be, and I definitely don&#39;t think it should be.</p>

            <p>There used to be an annual PPC survey, but the person who created and compiled it has gone. It consistently showed that people who have Permission never wrote all that many stories, per person. There were very few who had written equal to or more than the number in the Original Series.<br><br>I don&#39;t have a copy of the last one saved, but maybe hS does? I think you&#39;ve been made the official stats guy. (To paraphrase a book I just read.

            <p>This is by agent (not collating authors who have multiple agent pairs, not even cheating on my own) from the Complete List of PPC Fiction. I don&#39;t want to accidentally miss adding part of anyone&#39;s agents in, though I know some people would be in a higher category if I took the full time to do all the checking. I&#39;m also not going to guarantee that the bottom two categories are 100% accurate, but definitely within a couple. (I kept getting slightly different answers.) Also, I really wasn&#39;t sure how to include the histories and Department of Operations as they aren&#39;t listed by agent, so they aren&#39;t in here.<br><br>But as limited as all that, here are some numbers. <br><br># of Missions:  # of agent pairs<br><br>     1-4:             153 <br><br>     5-9:              49  <br><br>     10-14:             8  <br><br>     15-19:             4  <br><br>     20-24:             4  <br><br>     26:           Jay and Acacia<br><br>     38:           Tawaki &amp; various<br><br>     49:           Trojanhorse and Paddlebrains<br><br>     51:           Allison and Tasmin (I didn&#39;t add all of Indemaat&#39;s agents, but I know her total count is in the 70&#39;s at least.)<br><br>So by my count there are <i>about</i> 222 agent pairs listed. Out of that number, <i>about</i> 153 pairs have fewer than 5 stories. The majority of those were only 1 story. As you can see only three agents/agent pairs have surpassed Jay, and only 4 groups have gotten over 20.<br><br>The numbers would skew a bit higher if it were by author, but honestly I am too lazy to go through all 222 agent listings and the probably close to 100 other stories to be sure I have all the right authors attributed. However, the point still stands, most people who have Permission and write for the PPC write far fewer than five stories.</p>

            <p>So, apparently I seriously underestimated my level of laziness, because I have now gathered wayward agent pairs together to be counted with their authors&#39; totals.<br><br>This is based on the Complete List of PPC Fiction. There are notes at the bottom. I have this by author name on my computer (alphabetized, even!), if anyone wants that posted I can do that. This isn&#39;t restricted to missions. One of my favorite things about the PPC is that it isn&#39;t restricted to just missions, and I think infrastructure, history, interlude, and the harder-to-categorize items have just as much value. <br><br>One more note for the top: <br><br>I have attributed co-writers separately, if they have listed themselves as separate entities. For instance, Trojie has 63 PPC stories and Pads has 50. They always claimed their separate characters, and are listed separately on the wiki. Iximaz and Randa are listed together on the wiki and in the author attribute for one of the characters, so they have one line in the tally. These weren&#39;t the only cases of either example. This does function to inflate the total number of fics represented here.<br><br><br><br>Total: 180<br><br><br>1-4: 116 (64.44%)<br><br>1:  46  (25.56% of total)<br>2:  33<br>3:  20<br>4:  10<br><br><br>5-9: 37  (20.56%)<br><br>5:  14<br>6:  7<br>7:  3<br>8:  7<br>9:  6<br><br><br>10+: 15.00%<br><br>10-14: 8  (4.44%)<br><br>10: 4<br>12: 2<br>13: 1<br>14: 1<br><br><br>15-19: 5  (2.78%)<br><br>16: 1<br>18: 2<br>19: 2<br><br><br>20-24: 5  (2.78%)<br><br>20: 2<br>23: 1<br>24: 2 (Acacia is here)<br><br><br>25+: 9  (5.00%)<br><br>26: 3 (Jay is here)<br>31: 1<br>39: 1<br>50: 1<br>64: 1<br>68: 1<br>138: 1<br><br><br>NOTES<br><br><br>Then there is Huinesoron, who kind of needs his own category, due to sheer volume and variety. The count listed in the agent section is 38 (I think. There were agents lurking <i>everywhere</i> it seemed). There are things in the miscellaneous section that I am not sure how to count. Such as do you count the Advent Calender? What about the PPC Computer Game or the Misadventures of Jaycacia? I&#39;m not sure on several, so if you&#39;d like, could you give us a proper count (if you have time and all)? My best guess right now is 138, which is what I have listed.<br><br>I am not sure who wrote the account of the 2013 Blackout or the PPC Manga.<br><br>Neshomeh, I believe some of your things may be missing from the list. I know you have character journals, but they aren&#39;t on the list. If you are interested and have time and energy for it, could you give a proper count as well? <br><br><br><br>Web page down:<br><br>Mini-Balrog Cookbook<br>HQ Temple of All Faiths<br>Multiverse Monitor<br>tamry<em>and</em>angel<br><br><br>Not on glossary of characters:<br><br>Oozaru Angel has agents Tenki and Branch <br>Agents Claire Jubilex and Soledad Snowbird, unknown author<br>kittynoodles has Agents Caroline Moor and Veralyn Amberwing, also Agents Fiona Darcy and Gilbert Beckett<br>FishCustard has Agents Evie and the Fisherman (also the story count is off by 3 on Complete List)<br>EileenAlphabet has Agents James Vulpes and Saxo Cruore<br>duothimir has Agents Burning Heart and Johnny Denver<br>EllipsisFlood has Agents Priyala and Saline<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>I suspected that I was seriously underestimating for you. It doesn&#39;t change my percentages, because you are still in the above 25 category, but that count is just amazing. <br><br>Interesting point. In the 1-4 category, the total number of stories represented by those numbers is 212. I can&#39;t say for sure that that number is perfectly accurate, or if it is inflated by the way I attributed co-written stories to each individual author. But broadly speaking, you, individually, have written the same number of stories as two-thirds of the rest of the PPC authors. (You&#39;re doomed to people Listening to you forever.)<br><br>PS: I suddenly remembered all those amazing concrits Kaitlyn did a while back, in-character.

            <p>I think it might be a good idea to start encouraging all PPC members to put their name somewhere in the story, even if it is posted in something like our LJ that has an account name. A few people I had to go by their blog account name, which of course may or may not be the name they used here.

            <p>Or overlapping so slightly that we wouldn&#39;t necessarily have picked up on it as the wee babes we were.<br><br>Dee shows up in &quot;A Taste of Blood&quot; with Jay, which dates her involvement around early-to-mid 2003. Leto was actively writing the General Store stories between April and December 2003, and there&#39;s a mention of Milask being out on missions in the fifth chapter (that&#39;s second-to-last). I don&#39;t know when Dee&#39;s missions with Leto were written, but he says they only wrote together a short time.

            <p>Sounds quite interesting actually. I happen to have access to a survey website that allows you to answer anonymously if you want (or I can but a simple &#39;What&#39;s your PPC name?&#39; question in there if need be) due to me both being a course rep and the fact I do Maths at Uni. So if enough interest is around I&#39;d be more than happy to create and compile an annual survey if someone gave me a bit of a helping hand to work out what sort of questions to put down.  </p>

            <p>The link&#39;s neat though! I hope you didn&#39;t take that as a challenge; as a fellow critic (I&#39;m more a film guy than art in general, though) I was genuinely interested. I&#39;ll read through it, but which story was yours?<br><br>Now as for your second claim, no, it really hasn&#39;t been justified by how this community has behaved towards you. Putting aside your attacks against me, you just called this entire community &quot;nothing but a bunch of hidebound neckbeards&quot; and I don&#39;t see why you would write that expecting people <i>not</i> to take it as an insult. That&#39;s just the most recent case, as well, and of course leaving out the threads about in-universe concerns because we&#39;re just talking about the actual community here.</p>

            <p>Because I like it here. I think we do good work. However, almost every time I link someone to TOS or the Wiki, their reaction is that of an elderly Victorian gentlewoman to a mooning street urchin. It&#39;s a similar reaction that I and a load of other people in my acquaintance have had to OFUs over the time I&#39;ve been here.<br><br>So yes. Take being called hidebound neckbeards as an insult. It&#39;s an insult levied at all of us by people who aren&#39;t part of the PPC community and don&#39;t really understand what it is we do. That&#39;s precisely why I&#39;m talking about it in this conversation. We can improve. We can demonstrate that we are not that. HS&#39;s ideas for permission reform might not solve everything, but as far as I&#39;m concerned they&#39;re a damned fine start if we want to change our image.</p>

            <p>Or, speaking more accurately, I prefer our current status of having barely any image seen by the internet at large at all.<br><br>You&#39;re basically correct when you say that people don&#39;t always react well to learning about us.  It&#39;s happened numerous times in the past: authors of a missioned fic finding out about it and being upset (not to mention one individual who was watching the Board for new missions and went and told the original authors about it every time; that lasted a few months), someone mocking us on some game&#39;s discussion board, and, of course, the historical booting of the Original Series off of the Pit.  There was also the problem of the TV Tropes page that covered us, which for a while was attracting large groups of newbies who had gotten a skewed view of the PPC, and didn&#39;t really fit in, until a group of us fixed up the PPC page and made it more representative of the community as a whole.<br><br>So, no.  I don&#39;t think we need to change our image.  I think we need to continue being <i>quiet</i>.  I&#39;m not worried <i>what</i> other people might think of us, I&#39;m worried <i>that</i> they might think of us at all.  What do we do if a large group of trolls came in and started deleting multiple pages of the wiki?  Or spamming everyone&#39;s email accounts?  Or reporting the remaining PPC spinoffs on the Pit to admins to get them taken down, losing them forever?<br><br>I don&#39;t want to deal with any of that.  So let&#39;s not worry about advertising.   Let&#39;s not flaunt what we do.  Let&#39;s just keep doing what we&#39;ve been doing, here, with our friends whom we know and trust.<br><br>--doctorlit, the internet user equivalent of <i>sakoku</i>-era Japan</p>

            <p>Erm.  In seriousness, though, I&#39;m not suggesting complete isolation.  Just . . . we&#39;ve been doing fine as we are, with a small but constant inflow of newbies entering over time.

            <p>And I don&#39;t really want to make this devolved into an argument or some kind of flame war, I deal with enough of those already. However, I think it needs to be said, that not everyone has those kinds of reactions, maybe the people I know are more &#39;accepting&#39; (it&#39;s not quite the right word but I can&#39;t think of the right one at this moment, hence the &#39;&#39;). But they all know about it, have some basic understanding of it, and those who have read fanfiction before (and some who haven&#39;t) see the point of what we do (others think it&#39;s a sort of fun thing to do whether there&#39;s a point or not). Most of them don&#39;t understand any more of it besides the quick five/ten minute explanation I manage to get through, but they understand that it&#39;s important to me (and by extension, us), to do it and that&#39;s why we&#39;re here now, why the PPC is here, to do what we believe is important to us and to find like-minded people in the depths of the internet. All of us have something that&#39;s important to us, and if other people can&#39;t understand and think we&#39;re &quot;hidebound neckbeards&quot; because of it, then fine. <br><br>That&#39;s all I can reasonably think of saying for the moment without going into &#39;passionate speech mode&#39; <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>My main advice would probably to be to find a good beta reader or two, plus maybe review your own stuff a little more; I feel like the miscellaneous errors you made could have been caught with a thorough reading. You shouldn&#39;t have to edit and repost bits of your permission application in the comments as clarification or to fix things that you missed, basically. <br>Find a nice honest friend or even someone off the PPC beta directory and just let them rip apart your writing. It&#39;ll be rough to start with, but it will generally help you to learn to catch more of your own slip-ups. <br>You do seem to have a good sense of understanding how your characters will interact with each other, which is good! Keep that up. Just keep seeking constructive criticism (which you are receiving quite a bit of right now, which is good), take that criticism to heart, and keep trucking along. :)</p>

            <p>But there are still some bits that don&#39;t quite make sense.  The big ones have already been pointed out, but as well as those, there are still a few little ones.<br><br>If something bad happened on their last mission (as the SO hints), why aren&#39;t the agents more anxious about being summoned to the SO?  For all they know, they could be there to be disciplined rather than just receive a mission.<br><br>(And was that the real reason the SO gave them the mission in person?  Was the anxiety they were supposed to feel about being summoned supposed to be the punishment for whatever they did wrong last time?  If so, why didn&#39;t you show them feeling it?)<br><br>Why is the SO acting as a messenger for the Medical Department?  Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense for Medical to send the message direct to Plank on his console?  Or at least to Plank&#39;s department head, instead of the head of a different department?<br><br>Is Ellis serious when he says he never wants Wells or Bessie in the RC without his permission?  How would that even be workable?<br><br>Is Bessie&#39;s Shakespearean English deliberately wrong because she&#39;s from a Suefic where the author got the Jacobean grammar wrong?  If so, why didn&#39;t Plank&#39;s treatment cure it?  Or is the fact that it didn&#39;t cure it part of the reason why people don&#39;t think Bessie is cured?<br><br>(And why don&#39;t the Universal Translators translate it to our modern English anyway?)<br><br>But anyway, on the whole this feels much better.  The character interaction in the two prompts feels much more natural, less forced than last time.  You&#39;ve been getting to know your agents better over the past couple of weeks and it shows.<br><br>OTOH the backstories still feel awkward and contrived, like you were working from a long checklist of things you want included, and trying to force the characters around that.<br><br>If the PGs turn you down again, maybe you could move back to an earlier point in the story arc (e.g. when Wells and Plank first met) and make that the team you apply for permission with?  That way, you don&#39;t have to explain everything in one big lump, and the early story can develop more fluidly, more naturally over a few missions and interludes.<br></p>

            <p>Thank you for the constructive criticism. I have some answers to them.<br><br>1. I would have elaborated at the end of the previous mission, but I have in mind that Ellis convinced the others they have nothing to worry about, because the incident was legitimately not their fault. In short, they accidentally stumble upon an antagonist from Imaginations Collide. I intend to have them coexist.<br><br>2. The SO is acting as messenger because Plank is beginning to go off the deep end to the point that he is ignoring orders from the Head of his Department and Medical to do his research. It&#39;s going to be a running gag.<br><br>3. He thinks he is serious, but he is just irrationally angry. That&#39;s why he is so convinced of his accusations and why he is demanding impossible things.<br><br>4. Yes, her Shakespearean English is deliberately bad. I tried to do it correctly, but it&#39;s really hard to do. So, I decided to play upon Shakespeare being befuddled and what have you. And yes, that is one reason why people in the PPC, who are all of my invention and who will play an important role at some point, think that she has not been fully cured. As for the Universal translators, it&#39;s possible that she refuses them.<br><br>And finally, thank you for saying so. That actually might work better. Two separate teams coming together after the terrible catastrophe that I have planned.</p>

            <p>First, I feel it is too soon for you to be asking again. You recently said yourself that you haven&#39;t read many missions aside from emergency-related stuff, and unless you&#39;re a speed-reader with lots of time on your hands, I don&#39;t think you can have made much of a dent in my recommended reading list (or other material) since then. The fact that you seem to have the impression that it&#39;s normal for agents to receive their missions directly from Flowers and that you still don&#39;t get that the Flowers speak in <i>italics</i>, not &quot;quotations,&quot; not <b>bold</b>—which hS explicitly told you last time—seems to confirm this.<br><br>Second, your characters still raise too many serious questions for me. For instance:<br><br>* What&#39;s &quot;strictly feminine&quot; about cooking, fashion, and appreciating female attractiveness? That reads as rather sexist, don&#39;t you think?<br><br>* Why has everyone been bounced around through different departments? Ellis and Wells particularly, but Bessie and Plank don&#39;t seem to have been content with one assignment to their names, either. Are you playing PPC Department Bingo or something? More importantly, have you considered that that makes them look sort of incompetent?<br><br>* Why does Plank require an external trigger to become obsessed with curing Sueism? Why does that trigger have to be Suemonia, since it doesn&#39;t even work the way you want it to in the first place? It would make more sense to just have that grow out of his natural scientific passion, IMO, and you wouldn&#39;t have to mess with an established PPC concept that way.<br><br>* After all that talk about depression in the last thread, how is it that you still figure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinical depression</a> (as opposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_%28mood%29">depressed mood</a>) can be caused by a single instance of getting stuck in a temporal distortion and then completely cured... by speed pills...? Or did Plank just randomly decide to give her those after she recovered? I&#39;m not clear on the progression of these events. Or how the character is improved by having superpowers anyway.<br><br>* Did you know that the only agent known for using a neuralyzer (note correct spelling) to get her way was <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Cameo">a creepy, psychotic nutjob</a> who made her partner miserable?<br><br>* Shouldn&#39;t Bessie twig onto the fact that there&#39;s something weird about her, with her unusual speech pattern, awesome fighting skills, and Ellis calling her a Sue all the time? Has she never stopped to wonder about those things? What <i>does</i> she believe her past to be?<br><br>* How did Ellis, with his poor track record in other action departments and inability to play well with others, get himself transferred from Finance to the DMS—on a fairly uncommon team of three rather than the usual two, no less?<br><br>Whether the other PGs will find these things to be prohibitive or not, I dunno, but I think you&#39;re letting your enthusiasm get the better of you. You seem like a nice guy, and I apologize for being harsh on you in the past (and maybe now), but I really want to see you slow down and think things through more.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First, I will address the reading. Yes, I do have a perhaps unhealthy amount of time on my hands, and I am a fast reader.

As for the speed reading, I have taken some dual credit classes, so the skill kind of developed out of necessity. <br><br>Next, I know perfectly well that they don&#39;t usually get missions from the Flowers. I have something specific in mind to explain this, and, yes, that means I intend to use this section, once it is perfected. The only hint that I will give anyone about that is that it has to do with Imaginations Collide. <br><br>Next, yes. It was kind of stupid of me to mix up the words &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;italics&quot;. However, I am having some trouble with mine right now, as I explained before the prompt.<br><br>Oh, yes. You are right, it does seem sexist when I put it that way. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. Let me change it up a bit.<br><br>Agent #3)<br><br>Personality: Personality: Vivian Wells is a woman with a manic and unruly personality. She really enjoys physical activities that involve her use of her insane bursts of speed, such as racing people. She also loves junk food, and adores the color pink, unicorns, and throwing parties. She goes into long talks about such activities as cooking, fashion misshaps, the attractiveness of other female Agents, etc. She also likes to go shopping whenever she can, but at the same time she is wise with her money, usually only buying things that she thinks will be useful in some way. She likes to make fun of people when she knows it won&#39;t hurt their feelings too much. She likes playing pranks. She has mastered the puppy face, notably being able to use it to sway the stubborn and resilient Ellis on several occasions, and can sometimes whine and complain when she doesn&#39;t get her way. Concerning her extensive knowledge, she has trouble recalling what she knows due in large part to her perpetual adrenaline surge. Whenever something happens to someone she is close to, she gets very worried.<br>- Any better?<br><br>I have considered that it makes them look incompetent. I was going for that all along, sort of in an implied, people-say-it-behind-their-backs sort of way, and therefore I was going to leave it off the bios to address later. <br><br>Suemonia? Did I accidently leave that in there? I must have accidentally used an older version of his bio. Oh yes, the personality section again. Here is the real one.<br><br>Agent #4)<br>Personality: He has a scientific curiosity in all things to do with Mary Sues, going beyond normal boundaries and even coming across as obsessive and pushy. He takes risks that most other scientists wouldn&#39;t take, partly because he is going senile. He considers Mary Sues to be very nearly sentient, but lacking a few crucial personality traits. When he became Sued, he became borderline obsessed with finding a cure.<br><br>She was not cured by the pills, she was given the proper treatment. I don&#39;t know if it has an actual name, but I planned to elaborate on some of her post depression habits, which include siting in the Corpse Yoga pose, breathing evenly while listening to New Age music. The proper way to treat clinical depression is to use talk therapy or to prescribe antidepressants, however, there are some cases of electroshock therapy being used. It is my understanding that one cause of clinical depression is social isolation (which is kind of odd to me, since the clinically depressed tend to isolate themselves), but what I originally had in mind was that she saw things that shocked her.<br><br>She was given the pills after her successful recovery. My intentions for the serum inside the pills is that they are addictive, and part of Wells&#39; character development is her coping with that and eventually overcoming it. To make it harder for her to want to give it up, it gives her some sort of power that also contributes to her manic personality. <br><br>I did know that, but I can&#39;t remember who it was who did that.<br><br>As for Bessie, I am basing her off of someone I knew on Fanfiction.net who was unnaturally stubborn about her characters *not* being Mary Sues. A donkey was more submissive than she was. Uh, the author, not Bessie. But as for her past, she doesn&#39;t really think about it, no. She isn&#39;t really all that bright.<br><br>I will address that in my missions, but the idea of the unnatural team and him getting onto it is that they are misfits, even among the diverse PPC agents that there are already. When I put them all together, they have almost all the variables for success, and they only get that success by working together on this particular, unorthodox team.</p>

            <p>I want to explain why without being a jerk. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s entirely possible, but please try to read this as me writing out what&#39;s happening in my head rather than, like, &quot;I hate you; please die&quot; or something.<br><br>I <i>don&#39;t</i> hate you; please <i>don&#39;t</i> die. But what I&#39;m getting most strongly from your responses to me and Pippa&#39;s Ghost is basically as follows:<br><br>1. This is still just a setup for Imaginations Collide to you. I see this as a problem because A) you figure it&#39;s okay leave information out of your Permission stories because it&#39;s eventually going to be explained in/by IC, and B) because of the terrible catastrophe it involves. I am still and will be forever against involving the PPC in a terrible catastrophe for the sake of the separate project that&#39;s leeching care and attention to detail from work that is supposed to impress us.<br><br>2. &quot;Suemonia? Did I accidently leave that in there? I must have accidentally used an older version of his bio.&quot; ... So you didn&#39;t check over your request thoroughly enough to make sure it was the version you actually wanted us to read before you posted it?<br><br>2.5. The italics thing. I grant that this is minor, but you could have waited to post until you figured out the HTML, or you could have put the writing samples in a separate location where you could make it work and given us the URL. You knew you might be jumping the gun on asking again, and Flower speech was specifically pointed out to you as something to fix. (Also, for future reference, words in *asterisks* get auto-corrected to bold in some word processors and chat clients [and /slashes/ are used for italics]. That&#39;s why it looked more like an error in understanding than an error in word choice to me.)<br><br>3. Speaking of links, I linked to the character with the neuralyzer problem in my post. You could have clicked on it to get the name, and then I could be sure you really know about the character. It would have been super-easy and won you PPC Knowledge Points. Yet you didn&#39;t. This is incomprehensible to me. (Also, my point in bringing her up was that using a neuralyzer to violate someone&#39;s mind for personal gain is <i>really, really icky</i>, not something even a prankster would do if she&#39;s got a shred of human decency about her. I never wrote Cameo as a real agent for a <i>reason</i>.)<br><br>4. Okay, so Wells wasn&#39;t given random highly addictive superpower pills to treat her depression. That&#39;s good. Instead, she was given random highly addictive superpower pills for no reason at all, at least not that you felt important enough to tell us here. That&#39;s... not good.<br><br>5. While I grant you it makes sense for a former Suvian to speak in doggerel Shakespearean, the primary reason you give for this is &quot;I tried to do it correctly, but it&#39;s really hard to do.&quot; And I mean, yes, sometimes things are too much of a bother, so you make a different choice, and that&#39;s good, but this? Instead of choosing to do something <i>different</i>, you&#39;re choosing to do something <i>badly</i>. Deliberately-bad can be a legitimate choice, but not when it&#39;s because you actually can&#39;t do it correctly.<br><br>I realize I&#39;m focusing on the negative here (which is why I&#39;m not going to make the final decision), and I do appreciate that you can take concrit and really want to improve as a writer. My problem is, I&#39;m a person who notices patterns, sometimes to the point of distraction, and I keep seeing this pattern of underlying carelessness as shown by the examples above. Concrit and good intentions can&#39;t fix that. Only giving the necessary time and attention to your work can fix that. I would like to see time and attention in a Permission request, not promises that I&#39;ll see it later when you write the <i>real</i> story. Show, don&#39;t tell, yes?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s understandable that the Flowers might want to add in a little extra drama before sending their Agents into a fic that has traumatized an entire fandom. Why, if the Floating Hyacinth were a less serious-minded Flower, she might have even spiced up the announcement a little more for added effect. Maybe under an over-the-top Department Head like the Captain Dandy, the announcement would include a secretary entering the room wearing a hazmat suit as an ominous glow shone behind them, and the suited figure would carry a lead-lined box over to the Agents, and slowly, cautiously remove a printout of the fic from within it.<br><br>Yes, calling the Agents in to see a Flower is a little less efficient than just sending the mission data to the console, but if you just send an electronic message with the assignment, you don&#39;t get to see the looks on your employee&#39;s faces when they find out it&#39;s <i>them</i> who need to go into this story everyone&#39;s been putting off for years on account of its sheer terribleness. The hazmat suit-style additions might not be an enhancement to that, but it would make most Agents squirm in apprehension, which I imagine would also be fun to watch in a schadenfreude kind of way.<br><br>That&#39;s for special cases, though. If Agents had to report to their Flower for every mission, the Flowers wouldn&#39;t have any time to do actual work with all of the dispatching they&#39;d need to do themselves. The Board of Flowers would probably eventually assign some poor Flower to head up its own section exclusively to handle the reading and assignment of missions, just so the other Department Heads could actually do their jobs properly.</p>

            <p>All the Flowers seem a bit too serious of temperament to pull that, except maybe Captain Dandy; any time an agent pair&#39;s got a Legendary in a published mission, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s just arrived about as uneventfully as any fic does.</p>

            <p>Hello, all! I&#39;m new here, although I&#39;ve been eager to connect with other people. I burned through Jay and Acacia&#39;s original series in about two weeks, and am eager for more.<br>One thing that I&#39;ve noticed is that there is only one mission into a Hobbit fanfiction. With the two new movies (which I loved, and won&#39;t hear anything said against them) I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot of Fili/OC, Kili/OC, Thorin/OC, and bad Thilbo slash out there. (Not that all Thilbo slash is bad. I enjoy a good fem!Bilbo/Thorin story every now and then.) My personal goal, should I get permission, is to start killing off some of the Mary Sues mucking up canon out there.</p>

Gimli and Eowyn are both usually ignored/belittled by the authors of Sue-fics, and both are said to be resistant to the Sue-fluence.<br><br>Then I said to myself, &quot;self, there are two characters from Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha--Alisa and Suzuka--who do not feature in the missions that I have read. Rather, they choose to focus on the main characters, or on really stupid OCs. Therefore, would they have OOC-Resistance?&quot; And then, I realized that there are many, many other characters who are disregarded or ignored by suethors, in many, many canons that I could not even begin to name. Are all these characters OOC-Resistant?<br><br>If you followed my train of thought without too much of a headache, post with your position. If you found what I said too confusing, you can, I don&#39;t know, get on with your life?</p>

            <p>To use the example of Gimli, he&#39;s part of the Fellowship, and nearly always appears alongside the rest in a Tenth Walker fic.  It&#39;s the fact that he remains (usually, mostly) himself <i>despite</i> being touched by the badfic&#39;s words--and the fact that happened consistently through dozens and dozens of LotR missions--that make him &quot;OOC Resistant.&quot;<br><br>Personally, I feel a character should show up in numerous missions, consistently remaining in-character in the face of the author&#39;s Words, before we tack the OOC resistance label on them.</p>

            <p>IIRC OOC Resistance is a special trait. Like 99 said, characters ignored by the Suethor will be in-character because there&#39;s nothing to drive them out of it; to take an example from my recent mission, Bruenor Battlehammer, Catti-brie, Jarlaxle and Artemis Entereri are all IC despite being from the Drizzt series because they don&#39;t appear in that particular &quot;fic&quot; I sporked; I don&#39;t think any of the above characters merit OOC Resistance, which is usually reserved to powerful beings such as Elrond and the Valar or consistently-ignored characters such as Gaspode the Wonder Dog, the TARDIS or Gimly.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think so. The reason that some characters are &quot;immune&quot; to the Suefluence seems to be more attributed to a lack of positive attention by Suethors rather than the character&#39;s own volition or will. Likewise, many characters seem immune to OOC-ness due to a lack of attention. <br>This is just my observation, anyways :0</p>

            <p>This is my Permission Request, please tell me what you think. :) <br><br><br>(This is my self-insert. I chose Silver for the name because the first three letters of my first name and first three of my last put together sounds very much like Silver. Thought it would be a good self-insert name &gt;.&gt;)<br><br>Agent Silver <br>Full Name: Silver Leonne<br>Gender: Female<br>Age: 21<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Partner:  Agent Anna, Agent Skyfoot<br>Species: Human<br>RC: 19~Pie<br>Home Continuum: The Real World<br>Looks: Ash blonde hair down to her shoulders, slightly wavy. Gray-blue eyes and a splash of freckles across her nose. Short for her age and has naturally thick arms and legs.<br>History: Silver was a writer for a small magazine company, and the co-editor, which practically drove her insane. She was absolutely convinced the Hiring Office hired people because of their lack of talent in writing. So, when she picked up a flyer for a ‘Well paid and kindly run’ job for people who hated bad writing, she naturally applied. And, obviously, she got the job.<br>Personality: Silver is a natural leader, which usually gets her in trouble, as her instinct to take the initiative and command people sometimes feels rather controlling. She angers quickly, and her normally easy-going mood can slip to a snappish, annoyed demeanor in a matter of seconds. She’s rather quiet, though, in social settings, and prefers to sit in the corner when strangers talk. However, with people she knows, she becomes chatty and more comfortable. And more sarcastic. <br>Likes: Goodfic, cats, Aragorn, riding horses, LoTR, Ranger’s Apprentice, playing the ukulele and violin, and Japanese food, and archery.<br>Dislikes: Hot Dogs, Twilight, people making remarks about how her name is ‘Sueish’, badfic, people commenting on her lack of sword skills, and badly cooked food.<br><br><br>Agent Anna<br>Full Name: Annabeth Parks, usually called Anna<br>Gender: Female<br>Age: 20<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Partner: Agent Silver<br>Species: Human<br>RC: 19~Pie<br>Home Continuum: Ranger’s Apprentice<br>Looks: Anna has pale skin and thick, choppy brown hair that is cut short at her neck. She has brown eyes. Anna is tall and gangly, with long legs.<br>History: Anna was a bit character from a Ranger’s Apprentice fanfic; she took the place of Horace as a knight, while the Mary Sue took the place of Will. When agents dealt with the fic, they decided to recruit Anna. So, after a few months of rehab, Anna became an agent.<br>Personality: Anna is very outgoing and chatty. She’s the girl that the day she comes to a school, everyone is her friend. She is a kinder being than Silver. But, quite often, she takes things too literally, which, due to Silver’s habit of sarcasm, gets both of them in trouble. She, due to her knighthood in her badfic, can swing a sword.

She peered behind the woman at the cement walls of the RC. All she could see was a couch and two doors… that was it. Then, Anna realized the woman was still standing there, now sizing her up.<br>  “Um, hi, would you be Silver Leonne?” Anna checked the paper again. “Yeah, that’s right. Silver Leonne.”<br>  “Yeeesss…. Why exactly?” Her tone was suspicious. <br>    Not put off in the least, Anna grinned. “Well,” she said, “I was just deemed fit to be an agent and…”<br> Silver’s eyes widened and she took a step back, laughing. “I’m gonna have a partner! Yeah!” <br>    “Um. I’m still here.”<br> “Come in!”<br>  The woman – Silver – pulled Anna in by the wrist. <br>  “Sit.” Silver practically pushed Anna down on the couch. <br>   “So, I didn’t get your name,” Silver said.<br>    “Anna. Anna Parks.” Anna replied, looking in wonder around the RC. It was simply furnished with a desk, a console, the couch, and three doors, one of which Anna didn’t see when she was peeking into the room.<br>   “So, Anna, would you mind doing something for me?” Silver shoved a piece of paper into Anna’s hands. “You see that desk over there?”<br>  Anna nodded.<br>    “Do you have a pen?”<br>    “Yep.”<br>  “Now go over and write something. Anything.”<br>    “Okay…?” Anna shrugged and walked over, plunking down in the seat. She started scratching out her life story on the paper. When she finished, she brought it over to Silver and watched as the blonde girl fell back onto the couch, her eyes scanning the page. When Silver finally was done reading, she walked over to Anna, leaving the page on the couch.<br>    Anna found herself backing away.  But then Silver shrieked and hugged Anna fiercely. “Yes! Yes!” she said, “I actually have a partner that can *write*!”<br>  Blinking, Anna stood, slightly shocked, as Silver brought out a small bar of chocolate. <br>    “Just to celebrate,” she said.<br>  Just as Anna started to bite in…. <br>[BEEEEEEEP!]<br>    “DANG IT!”<br><br>  Random Prompt: One agent is mistaken for a Sue and has to prove otherwise.<br><br>  Silver was quietly walking, minding her own business in a Lord of the Rings badfic when the agents popped out of the forest and tried to kill her.

Then….<br>  “Wait! No! I’m not the Sue! I’m not Marie Rein-a Abbott!” Silver yelped. She tried to back away, but was bumped up against a tree.<br>  “Stupid last words.” The orc grinned, which looked very misplaced.<br>  “No! I’m *Silver*!

Please don’t kill me, what will Anna say?” Silver’s thoughts raced.<br>     “Who’s Anna?” The orc growled.<br>   “My partner! Tall, gangly girl? Choppy brown hair? You know her!” Silver gulped,  “Sunflower Official! Floating Hyacinth! The Marquis de Sod!”<br>  “Well, she sure got some information out of Silver.”<br>    “WHAT?

            <p>Overall, I think this looks good. The characters sound like good, clean fun, and I have to admit I&#39;m intrigued by the idea of an agent who is literally a cat. However, I have one major criticism and a few minor things I want to point out.<br><br>First, the big thing, which is to do with the scenario in your random prompt. It... doesn&#39;t make much sense. I&#39;m fine with Silver taking a mission solo while Anna is assigned elsewhere (though it would be more usual for Silver to get someone else assigned to her temporarily), but I&#39;m confused about where the other agents came from (were they accidentally assigned to the same fic?) and how they could possibly mistake Silver for a Sue they&#39;ve been following long enough to compile a full charge list. I thought there might be an explanation to the effect that the amulet Silver was holding changed her appearance or fooled the agents&#39; equipment or something, but all she was doing was holding it, which is not terribly incriminating. And there was nothing else to go on, not even a word about Silver and the Sue looking similar. Speaking of which, was she even in disguise? And if she wasn&#39;t in disguise, how come the other agents didn&#39;t see her flash patch? There&#39;s a lot that needs explaining.<br><br>I think the basic idea <i>could</i> work if you dealt with those problems, though, and the scene was amusing. I liked the dialogue between the orc agents.<br><br>Now the little questions:<br><br>* RC 19~Pie? What? If there&#39;s a joke, I don&#39;t get it.<br><br>* Silver is supposed to be quiet around strangers, becoming chatty with people she knows. However, she&#39;s very exuberant toward Anna right away in the control prompt, which seems like a contradiction. Is she only quiet in groups, but otherwise warms up to people quickly? How big does the group need to be to make her get quiet?<br><br>* Is the backstory about Silver being co-editor of a magazine based on your real life experience? Is it a student publication, or family-owned, perhaps? Otherwise, this could well be my own ignorance talking, but I&#39;m not sure how a young college-age person gets to a position as high as co-editor even in a small publishing company.<br><br>* I know this is something that happens later, but how is it going to work for Skyfoot to live with Silver and Anna if she works in the DMS? Doesn&#39;t she have a partner of her own? Or is she going to transfer?<br><br>* How does Skyfoot&#39;s collar get to her wrist when she transforms? It could just stay a collar. Alternatively, the collar could simply translate from Cat to English, like Dug&#39;s collar in <i>Up!</i> She could still transform as needed for missions with the aid of the disguise generator.<br><br>And a couple SPaG notes:<br><br>* You need to use first-line indents or double line-breaks to set off new paragraphs. I recommend double line-breaks. It&#39;s standard online, and it&#39;s easy.<br><br>* Your dialogue punctuation is a little spotty. There are a few places where the punctuation and/or capitalization are off:<br><br> - “Anna. Anna Parks.” Anna replied <i>should be</i> &quot;Anna. Anna Parks,&quot; Anna replied<br><br> - “I think she’s tortured Agent Silver for information.” One orc growled. <i>should be</i> &quot;I think she&#39;s tortured Agent Silver for information,&quot; one orc growled.<br><br> - Silver gulped, “Sunflower Official! Floating Hyacinth! The Marquis de Sod!” <i>should be</i> Silver gulped. &quot;Sunflower Official! Floating Hyacinth! The Marquie de Sod!&quot; <i>(You can&#39;t gulp and speak at the same time.)</i><br><br> - “LEGOLAS HELP ME!” The ‘Sue shrieked <i>should be</i> &quot;LEGOLAS HELP ME!&quot; the &#39;Sue shrieked <i>(Assuming she shrieked the words rather than shouting, then shrieking wordlessly.)</i><br><br>* I&#39;m guessing you aren&#39;t sure how to use HTML on the Board, but titles of long works such as [<i>The</i>]<i> Lord of the Rings</i> should be italicized, and you should use italic or bold type for emphasis rather than asterisks. You can look up HTML lots of places, including our <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies#What.27s_the_deal_with_this_Board.3F_How_do_I_post_on_it.3F">FAQ: For Newbies</a> (and soon FAQ: The Board, because this is kind of an oversight and I&#39;m going to fix it).<br><br>... I think that&#39;s everything. I think what I&#39;d like you to do is re-write the random prompt to plug up those plotholes and do some tweaking based on my other comments, and if everything is ship-shape after that, I will give my verdict. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Gray-blue eyes and a splash of freckles across her nose. Short for her age and has naturally thick arms and legs.<br><br>History: Silver was a writer for a school magazine ‘company’ and the co-editor, which practically drove her insane. She was absolutely convinced the Hiring Office as she knew it hired people because of their lack of talent in writing. So, when she picked up a flyer for a ‘Well paid and kindly run’ job for people who hated bad writing, she naturally applied. And, obviously, she got the job.<br><br>Personality: Silver is a natural leader, which usually gets her in trouble, as her instinct to take the initiative and command people sometimes feels rather controlling. She angers quickly, and her normally easy-going mood can slip to a snappish, annoyed demeanor in a matter of seconds. She’s rather quiet, though, in social settings, and prefers to sit in the corner when a group of five-or-so strangers talk. However, with people she knows, and smaller groups, she becomes chatty and more comfortable. And more sarcastic. <br><br>Likes: Goodfic, cats, Aragorn, riding horses, <i> Lord of the Rings </i>, <i>Ranger’s Apprentice</i>, playing the ukulele and violin, and Japanese food, and archery.<br><br>Dislikes: Hot Dogs, Twilight, people making remarks about how her name is ‘Sueish’, badfic, people commenting on her lack of sword skills, and badly cooked food.<br><br><br><br>Agent Anna<br><br>Full Name: Annabeth Parks, usually called Anna<br><br>Gender: Female<br><br>Age: 20<br><br>Department: Department of Floaters<br><br>Partner: Agent Silver<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>RC: 19(LanguageNotRecognized)<br><br>Home Continuum: Ranger’s Apprentice<br><br>Looks: Anna has pale skin and thick, choppy brown hair that is cut short at her neck. She has brown eyes. Anna is tall and gangly, with long legs.<br>History: Anna was a bit character from a Ranger’s Apprentice fanfic; she took the place of Horace as a knight, while the Mary Sue took the place of Will. When agents dealt with the fic, they decided to recruit Anna. So, after a few months of rehab, Anna became an agent.<br><br>Personality: Anna is very outgoing and chatty. She’s the girl that the day she comes to a school, everyone is her friend. She is a kinder being than Silver. But, quite often, she takes things too literally, which, due to Silver’s habit of sarcasm, gets both of them in trouble. She, due to her knighthood in her badfic, can swing a sword. Not much more than that, though. She is a master at manipulating people to do what she likes, and has no qualms about telling people what to do.<br><br> Likes: Goodfic, Will Treaty, breakfast, almost any animal that moves, country music.<br><br>Dislikes: people assuming she’s from the Percy Jackson continuum, boredom, waiting.<br><br><br>Agent Skyfoot<br><br>Full Name: Skyfoot<br><br>Gender: Female<br><br>Age: 3 (In human years)<br><br>Department: Department of Floaters<br><br>Partner: Sometimes teams up with Silver.<br><br>Species: Cat<br><br>RC: Moves into RC 19(LanguageNotRecognized)<br><br>Home Continuum: Warrior Cats<br><br>Looks: Skyfoot is a brown-and-white she-cat with amber eyes.

Silver had decided, for the sake of irony, let one ‘Sue indirectly kill another. Unfortunately, the consequences of having a ‘Sue amulet was to give off an aura of ‘Sueness. Everything about herself was changed – the Sue aura effected all that touched it. So, Silver looked like a ‘Sue. She radiated Aura of Smooth. It was awful. Even her clothes changed to a girly – but not too girly—dress, perfect for a ‘Sue. <br><br>    Silver peered around again. Still nothing.

So, when she picked up a flyer for a ‘Well paid and kindly run’ job for people who hated bad writing, she naturally applied. And, obviously, she got the job.<br><br>Personality: Silver is a natural leader, which usually gets her in trouble, as her instinct to take the initiative and command people sometimes feels rather controlling. She angers quickly, and her normally easy-going mood can slip to a snappish, annoyed demeanor in a matter of seconds. She’s rather quiet, though, in social settings, and prefers to sit in the corner when a group of five-or-so strangers talk. However, with people she knows, and smaller groups, she becomes chatty and more comfortable. And more sarcastic. <br><br>Likes: Goodfic, cats, Aragorn, riding horses, <i> Lord of the Rings </i>, <i>Ranger’s Apprentice</i>, playing the ukulele and violin, and Japanese food, and archery.<br><br>Dislikes: Hot Dogs, Twilight, people making remarks about how her name is ‘Sueish’, badfic, people commenting on her lack of sword skills, and badly cooked food.<br><br><br><br>Agent Anna<br><br>Full Name: Annabeth Parks, usually called Anna<br><br>Gender: Female<br><br>Age: 20<br><br>Department: Department of Floaters<br><br>Partner: Agent Silver<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>RC: 19(LanguageNotRecognized)<br><br>Home Continuum: Ranger’s Apprentice<br><br>Looks: Anna has pale skin and thick, choppy brown hair that is cut short at her neck. She has brown eyes. Anna is tall and gangly, with long legs.<br>History: Anna was a bit character from a Ranger’s Apprentice fanfic; she took the place of Horace as a knight, while the Mary Sue took the place of Will. When agents dealt with the fic, they decided to recruit Anna. So, after a few months of rehab, Anna became an agent.<br><br>Personality: Anna is very outgoing and chatty. She’s the girl that the day she comes to a school, everyone is her friend. She is a kinder being than Silver. But, quite often, she takes things too literally, which, due to Silver’s habit of sarcasm, gets both of them in trouble. She, due to her knighthood in her badfic, can swing a sword. Not much more than that, though. She is a master at manipulating people to do what she likes, and has no qualms about telling people what to do.<br><br> Likes: Goodfic, Will Treaty, breakfast, almost any animal that moves, country music.<br><br>Dislikes: people assuming she’s from the Percy Jackson continuum, boredom, waiting.<br><br><br>Agent Skyfoot<br><br>Full Name: Skyfoot<br><br>Gender: Female<br><br>Age: 3 (In human years)<br><br>Department: Department of Floaters<br><br>Partner: Sometimes teams up with Silver.<br><br>Species: Cat<br><br>RC: Moves into RC 19(LanguageNotRecognized)<br><br>Home Continuum: Warrior Cats<br><br>Looks: Skyfoot is a brown-and-white she-cat with amber eyes. She has short fur and a dark tail-tip, and a heavy-looking brown collar. <br><br>History: Skyfoot was a Generic Warrior in a badfic, no name given, with only one line. When the ‘Sue of the fic was assassinated, Skyfoot fell into a plothole and came out somehow on the HQ side of a portal in an agent’s Response Center. She was recruited and given a name – Skyfoot, obviously. Because she was a cat, and they needed to understand her, Make-Things fashioned for her a collar that would allow her to speak in English. (He borrowed the idea from Up.) <br><br>Personality: Skyfoot is generally warrior-like, being a Generic Warrior. True to ThunderClan spirit, she hates getting wet, can climb trees a little bit, and hides in undergrowth a lot. She is known to sometimes get off track on a mission and start hunting.<br><br>Likes: Hunting, Graystripe, Sunningrocks.<br><br>Dislikes: Swimming, heights, herbs.<br><br><br><br><br>Control Prompt: The agents meet~<br><br>    Newly recruited Agent Annabeth Parks walked slowly down the hallway, her wide eyes drinking in everything.  Even the bland gray walls seemed interesting, apparently.<br>   Suddenly, the woman turned in front of one RC door.  She checked her paper again… yep, this was the place. Response Center 19(LanguageNotRecognized). Anna grinned and rapped on the door. She waited a few seconds, then the door swung open, revealing a young woman dressed in uniform. <br><br>   For a second, Anna was too startled to say anything. She peered behind the woman at the cement walls of the RC. All she could see was a couch and two doors… that was it. Then, Anna realized the woman was still standing there, now sizing her up.<br><br>  “Um, hi, would you be Silver Leonne?” Anna checked the paper again. “Yeah, that’s right. Silver Leonne.”<br><br>  “Yeeesss…. Why exactly?” Her tone was suspicious. <br><br>    Not put off in the least, Anna grinned. “Well,” she said, “I was just deemed fit to be an agent and…”<br><br> Silver’s eyes widened and she took a step back, laughing. “I’m gonna have a partner! Yeah!” <br><br>    “Um. I’m still here.”<br><br> “Come in!”<br><br>  The woman – Silver – pulled Anna in by the wrist. <br><br>  “Sit.” Silver practically pushed Anna down on the couch. <br><br>   “So, I didn’t get your name,” Silver said.<br><br>    “Anna. Anna Parks,” Anna replied, looking in wonder around the RC. It was simply furnished with a desk, a console, the couch, and three doors, one of which Anna didn’t see when she was peeking into the room.<br><br>   “So, Anna, would you mind doing something for me?” Silver shoved a piece of paper into Anna’s hands. “You see that desk over there?”<br><br>  Anna nodded.<br><br>    “Do you have a pen?”<br><br>    “Yep.”<br><br>  “Now go over and write something. Anything.”<br><br>    “Okay…?” Anna shrugged and walked over, plunking down in the seat. She started scratching out her life story on the paper. When she finished, she brought it over to Silver and watched as the blonde girl fell back onto the couch, her eyes scanning the page. When Silver finally was done reading, she walked over to Anna, leaving the page on the couch.<br><br>    Anna found herself backing away.  But then Silver shrieked and hugged Anna fiercely. “Yes! Yes!” she said, “I actually have a partner that can *write*!”<br><br>  Blinking, Anna stood, slightly shocked, as Silver brought out a small bar of chocolate. <br>    “Just to celebrate,” she said.<br>  Just as Anna started to bite in…. <br><b> [BEEEEEEEP!] </b><br>   “DANG IT!”<br><br>  Random Prompt: One agent is mistaken for a Sue and has to prove otherwise.<br><br>  Silver was quietly walking, minding her own business in a <i> Lord of the Rings </i> badfic when the agents popped out of the forest and tried to kill her. Well, technically, not minding her own business. Stalking a ‘Sue, more like. But not at all deserving *this*. <br><br>  Silver crept around the bend in the path, peering out to the other end. No ‘Sues there. She’d have to wait.<br><br> Unfortunately, Anna wasn’t with her. She had gone off and done some Bad Slash work for a little while, and this was Silver’s first mission without her. She had been paired with a few bumbling recruits. Tired of their banter, she had decided to &#39;scout ahead&#39;. <br><br> She fumbled in her bag for the previous ‘Sue’s amulet. Silver had decided, for the sake of irony, let one ‘Sue indirectly kill another. Unfortunately, the consequences of having a ‘Sue amulet was to give off an aura of ‘Sueness. Everything about herself was changed – the Sue aura effected all that touched it. So, Silver looked like a ‘Sue. She radiated Aura of Smooth. It was awful. Even her clothes changed to a girly – but not too girly—dress, perfect for a ‘Sue. <br><br>    Silver peered around again. Still nothing. Getting exasperated, she stood up— and was immediately faced with two sharp-looking swords at her neck, held by orcs.<br><br>  “Marie Reyna Abbott. You are charged with – hey, gimme the charge sheet! – um, joining the Fellowship, having a pet tiger, messing with practically everyone’s character, mostly Elrond, Legolas, and Frodo, and almost killing a PPC agent. Any last words?”<br><br> “What?” Silver’s brow furrowed. <br><br>  “Last words. You need some last words.”<br><br> Silver, still shocked, didn’t realize the full meaning of that statement for a few seconds. Then….<br><br>  “Wait! No! I’m not the Sue! I’m not Marie Rein-a Abbott!” Silver yelped. She tried to back away, but was bumped up against a tree.<br><br>  “Stupid last words.” The orc grinned, which looked very misplaced.<br>  “No! I’m *Silver*! Agent Silver!”<br><br>   The orcs exchanged suspicious glances. <br><br> “I think she’s tortured Agent Silver for information,” One orc growled.<br>   “Possibly killed her!” The other orc chimed in.<br><br> “True. We haven’t seen her for a while. She told us she was going to scout ahead and report back.”<br><br>    “No! No! I’m Agent Silver! Please don’t kill me, what will Anna say?” Silver’s thoughts raced.<br><br>     “Who’s Anna?” The orc growled.<br><br>   “My partner! Tall, gangly girl? Choppy brown hair? You know her!” Silver gulped.  “Sunflower Official! Floating Hyacinth! The Marquis de Sod!”<br><br>  “Well, she sure got some information out of Silver.”<br><br>    “WHAT? I would never share about the Flowers! I’M. NOT. A. SUE.”<br><br>  Possibly it was the anger in her voice, possibly it was the Sue that just came around the bend. Either way, the two orcs apologized, and ran after the ‘Sue, swords raised. Silver glanced at the amulet, and back at them. She shrugged and put it back in her bag. Immediately, her clothes shifted back to her gear. <br><br>  From down by the ‘Sue… “Marie Reyna Abbott. You are charged with joining the Fellowship, having a pet tiger, messing with everyone’s characters, almost killing two PPC agents, one of them held at swordpoint by us. Any last words?”<br><br>    “LEGOLAS HELP ME!” The ‘Sue shrieked as the orcs leveled their swords at her. She was abruptly cut off.<br><br>   Silver sagged back against the tree. “And that’s why I always bring Anna with me.”<br><br>    She grudgingly opened a portal and stepped through into her RC.<br><br>(Nice double line breaks… come here and do your work… :3)<br>Alrighty, I think that&#39;s everything. I hope I explained it in detail… :D</p>

            <p>That&#39;s definitely better, though I&#39;m still not sure how even bumbling recruits fail to recognize that Sued!Silver isn&#39;t the same Sue they&#39;ve been following.

            <p>That thread about PPC ads apparently stuck with a few of us. I mean, one of my agents got in through one, one of darkbrother&#39;s prospective/future agents applied through one, and now Silver as well. That&#39;s not a complaint, I just find it kind of interesting. Also, why was Silver in a fic that other agents were doing a mission in? Don&#39;t we have people to stop that from happening? Then again, agents aren&#39;t very good at following the rules anyway. Overall, I like it, so good luck.</p>

            <p>Do response centers lock from the outside?  Sofar I have seen people ducking into the nearest RC, but it always seems abandoned or unclaimed.

            <p>Sometimes when our viewpoint is inside, people will knock (or pound) on the door - but I don&#39;t recall actually encountering any locks.<br><br>No, wait, I take it back: in <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/ReorgPart8.htm">The Reorganisation</a>, Nyx gets locked into an RC by the DIS. She specifically hears the lock click. That is, however, a very <i>old</i> RC (while Nyx gets the dates slightly wrong, it still has a portal - actually plothole - generator which dates back close to two decades). So they might not all have those.<br><br>Ultimately, your last suggestion is probably closest - as Neshomeh recently pointed out, the &#39;rules&#39; of PPC HQ are &#39;whatever&#39;s funny&#39;. Unless seeing people muck about with keys is wildly amusing, don&#39;t bother writing it. If a locked door is funny, use that; if an unlocked one is funnier, use <i>that</i>.<br><br>I will say that there&#39;s next to no precedent for locks, so spending a lot of time on it would probably get you some odd looks. But if you&#39;re just thinking &#39;Agent B has to camp out in the corridor until Agent A shows up&#39;, you could probably get away with it.<br><br>(In general, we treat RCs more like offices than living quarters. While my Real World office does <i>have</i> a lock, I don&#39;t tend to use it while I&#39;m a) inside, or b) anywhere on-site.

            <p>When my vampire goes into fics where she is forced to or prefers to wear a human disguise, would there be a problem with eating or drinking?  <br><br>As in, does she need to fast or rely on blood in human form so that she doesn&#39;t have anything dangerous in her system at the end of a mission?

            <p>They have the physical characteristics of what they turn into. Then when they go back to their normal state, things affect them, if it is still in effect. Although it can be used for more minor alterations of clothing, skin color, hair styles without changing species, which is what I do with my two humanoid agents, since they are mostly only cosmetically different from humans (on the outside).  <br><br>Actually your idea might work, in the arrows-in-Ent-backs incident with Jay and Acacia, the only arrow injury that hurt when they got back was the one that still had an arrow lodged in it.

            <p>I&#39;m thinking that she will have to get a Biochemical Substance Eliminator and have a personal protocol for length and type of mission.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure how long a human could go without drinking water and still remain functional.  (I&#39;ve heard two days, but I wouldn&#39;t have her go more than 12 hours.)  Since blood has a water content, I&#39;m thinking that she might be able to survive on blood or plasma for short missions even when needing to be completely human, (or if she might need to leave in a hurry,) and then be able to dilute the water content in her stomach with blood on medium missions with the same constraints.<br><br>She&#39;ll be spending some time Avatar: TLA fics because that&#39;s what her partner knows.  Good chance of encountering water and she&#39;s more flammable than a human.  She will refuse to go more than two days without something solid. <br><br>It&#39;s good to know that there is a cosmetic setting.  She would need ears, nails, and teeth blunted, as well as color correction for her skin and eyes at least.</p>

            <p>Not at all familiar with the game, so I don&#39;t really understand the reference. Can you explain the effect that description has?<br><br>Fanon is kind of a grey area I think. Others might have a different take on it, but that&#39;s mine. <br><br>A popular fanon in the Marvel cinematic verse fanfics is that Phil Coulson and Clint Barton are in a relationship (or begin one, or any of the other shipping variations of stories). I really think they are never on-screen with each other. Coulson mentions Clint&#39;s name once during a phone conversation. It&#39;s not from historical comic sources, Coulson didn&#39;t exist in the comics until after he got popular in the movies. I haven&#39;t watched 100% of the Spiderman cartoons where he&#39;s a character, but I don&#39;t remember seeing Clint in them. <br><br>The only interaction I&#39;ve actually seen between the two of them in canon (admittedly I am horribly behind on the Marvel Now series) is Coulson infecting Clint with mind controlling nano bots and setting him up to be tortured by bad guys and then killed by Nick Fury. The bullet Fury shot him with had repairing nano bots in it, so they fixed all the damage from the torture, then the ones Coulson infected him with erased the whole series of events from his mind. <br><br>Anyway, point is that there is this huge body of fanon that says they destined for one another. It is completely unsupported by the canon, in any form of the canon that I know of. A lot of the fanon is well-written (and vastly preferred reading over the Fury and Coulson in the comics that I want to kill slowly (in narrative form of course) based on that incident I talked about). Does that make fics based on that fanon charge worthy?<br><br>I don&#39;t think it does, but someone else might get very infested in that comic series and really hate that Coulson&#39;s character is derailed into someone who wouldn&#39;t do that to another human being, and be all for killing the story.</p>

            <p>... what you&#39;re looking at is a potential/possible AU (depending on whether you believe it&#39;s actually happening in the canon but just not shown, or actually contradicted by the canon). The PPC doesn&#39;t charge for AUs - because every single fanfic is an AU to one extent or another. We charge for <i>implausible</i> AUs. If Coulson acts in a way which is inconsistent with his canon portrayal - if, say (based purely on the films + &#39;Agents of SHIELD&#39;) he throws away his duty without a second thought in order to snuggle with Hawkeye, then that&#39;s a charge. If he acts <i>in</i> character, even if it&#39;s an AU - if, say, you had a story where he was given a situation where his canon-friendly decision would be to shoot all the Avengers and crash the moon into the Earth - then you don&#39;t charge for it.<br><br>Writing quality doesn&#39;t just count for a lot - it counts for <i>everything</i>, provided you define it broadly enough.<br><br>hS<br><br>(No, I don&#39;t know what would cause him to do that. I&#39;d be interested to see someone come up with a logical chain of events that would lead to it, though)</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a bit of a better excuse for not knowing Samus was a woman: English manuals for the original <i>Metroid</i> actually used male pronouns for her. The original Japanese used genderless pronouns.<br>Bear in mind, though, that that was 1986.

            <p>Love me some tech questions.<br><br><br><u>Analog CAD</u>: I love the idea of forcing agents to squint at a tiny, illegible set of dials and having to do mental math to get a result but I have to admit that I don&#39;t quite understand the nature of this proposed CAD. Are the internal components radically different from the digital-readout CADs or is it just the display that&#39;s different? The way you worded this seems to indicate the former but I just want to be sure. <br><br>I&#39;d just like to point out one thing: having a CAD fail spectacularly is a PPC staple.

            <p>I was thinking that since the analog CAD is cheaper, it still has failures.  It&#39;s just that it&#39;s more likely to snap a spring or have a wire burn out before the entire device catches on fire... usually.  Part of their beauty is that not running on magic smoke and not exploding makes them easier to repair. <br><br>Another disadvantage is that the way you tell a character rupture from a character replacement is to watch the OOC dial and pay attention to just how the spring underneath the dial snaps and how hot the case gets.  Or carry the strips as backup.</p>

            <p>An original character (OC) is any non-canon character in a fanfic (i.e., made up by the fanfic&#39;s author for the story).

Observation alone can be misleading—for instance, in one of my missions, Agent Ilraen was certain there was a character replacement, so he charged and killed the character, but it was really a possession, and it took time travel to fix things.

            <p>I&#39;m talking mainly about the DC and Marvel universes, but any medium that uses superheroes can qualify. It&#39;s kind of frustrating for me as I have Quite a lot of Fandoms, but the only ones that are discussed are LOTR , Harry Potter and sometimes Doctor Who. The few times I have tried talking about superheroes I&#39;ve been pretty much ignored. And I have not found good luck finding missions of that variety on the wiki. I don&#39;t mean to sound rude, I&#39;m just a little annoyed. Nothing Personal. In fact I would be pleased if we used this post to just rant about superheroes. </p>

            <p>...I am a big fan of the various DC animated universes. I&#39;ve collected almost all of the DCAU or &quot;Timmverse&quot; on DVD or digital (the exceptions being <i>Static Shock</i> and <i>The Zeta Project</i>, neither of which I had much interest in). And while I don&#39;t write &quot;mission&quot; missions anymore, I have been considering whipping up some MSTs in something like <i>Young Justice</i> or <i>Teen Titans</i>. Goodness knows there&#39;s enough badfics in either continuum to sate me for the foreseeable future.<br><br>I was never really able to get into the Marvel cartoons as much. I do enjoy the movieverse, though. The last film I saw in theaters was the new Captain America one, which I thought was pretty solid.<br><br>Finally, getting away from Marvel and DC, I&#39;m a big fan of the superhero tabletop RPG <i>Mutants and Masterminds</i>. I haven&#39;t admittedly tried the third edition rules (all my sourcebooks and world-fluff are second edition) but it&#39;s pretty fun. The predecessor of Gremlin actually started out in part as my character in a <i>Young Justice</i>-style campaign.<br><br>So... yeah. Superheroes. They&#39;re pretty cool. And stuff.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been working on an Avengers (movie) mission for a while now. I think if I ever do actually get around to doing missions regularly then I could probably pull off a few comic missions too. Fortunately, comics mostly just require knowledge of the characters and the cities, and you only have to worry about events if something specific is referenced or it relates directly to how a certain character came to be where they are now. (Like Rogue becoming a hero, or Dick Grayson leaving Batman to become Robin.)<br>The reason for this is, amusingly, the reason why so many people are intimidated by comics: Because there&#39;s just so much history. When it comes to fanfiction, this means you have more to draw from, and also that you don&#39;t really have to specify when your story is happening, unless it is drawing on something specific, because there&#39;s so much room for things to have happened at any point. If you want a story where Robin is still Dick Grayson, that&#39;s cool, and nobody would look at you weird unless you referenced events that happened after Dick quit to do his own thing.<br><br>I guess my point is that comic-based missions would probably be easier than people think, it doesn&#39;t really require much more knowledge than any other mission, and I&#39;d be more confident with comics than I would with, say, LoTR since I know the material better.</p>

            <p>Namtar is one of my favorite baddies-of-the-week. I love his voice. ^_^ I really wish they&#39;d done more with the fact that Aeryn has some of Pilot&#39;s DNA. It came up a couple times, but mostly it was forgotten. Kinda like Pilot himself, poor guy.<br><br>My favorite episode might be &quot;Out of Their Minds,&quot; the body-swap episode, because it&#39;s the first one I ever saw, and it got me hooked on the characters, especially Pilot. The acting in that episode is so awesome that it worked even though I had no idea who any of those people were at the time, and the bad guys were Skeksis. <i>The Dark Crystal</i> is hugely nostalgic for me, so that was a big selling point. And the fact that they weren&#39;t afraid to explore the dirty little things a person might have to do or want to do while stuck in someone else&#39;s body. {X D<br><br>Other contenders are &quot;Crackers Don&#39;t Matter&quot; and pretty much anything focusing on Pilot or Scorpius. (Favorite characters are apparent by now, yes?) All the John&#39;s Head episodes are great, too—&quot;Won&#39;t Get Fooled Again&quot; is the one with camp!D&#39;Argo, and &quot;Revenging Angel&quot; is the one with the cartoon coma.<br><br>I also grew to love D&#39;Argo a whole lot with successive viewings (and not just because of the miniseries). I think his character gets the most dramatic growth, and he has some of the greatest lines.<br><br>Man, I wanted to like Stark so much... I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the &quot;actually loopy and full of bad ideas&quot; route they took with his character. I wanted more mystical, caring Stark. I get that we already had Zhaan in the mystic/healer role, but she was already sort of in the unstable, role, too, what with occasionally flipping out and trying to kill everyone. O.o I would totally read a more-or-less-serious, more-or-less-platonic Stark/Crichton fic, if you write one. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. Watch out for the mini-Budongs!

            <p>I think we have had a few missions to deal with comic badfic, but the general consensus (at least in-universe) is that canon is so tangled up in its default state it&#39;s almost impossible to determine what fits in acceptably and what&#39;s Suefic/otherwise bad. Rather than chew the Board out for not talking about what you want to talk about, though, maybe take on a few such fics yourself? We don&#39;t have any rule against it. :P</p>

            <p>Now, down to business: that&#39;s pretty fantastically awesome. And is made all the more so by following the links to find <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/noble-smith/jrr-tolkien-reveals-the-t_b_5373529.html">this article</a> - I&#39;ve actually heard of that party! I remember reading about the catering somewhere. (Also, in that photo - the Professor reminds me a lot of our current Bilbo. (Also, I&#39;m now imagining Tolkien as a Time Lord called &#39;the Professor&#39; <i>and it is awesome</i>))<br><br>There&#39;s a poem in Elvish (no word on which!) in there... and, just, wow.<br><br>So go on then... things that it would be both awesome, hilarious, and incredibly frustrating if it turns out he said in his speech:<br><br><i>&quot;Some things are left deliberately ambiguous - such as the question of whether Elves have wings...&quot;<br><br>&quot;The heart of my legendarium is, and always has been, Tom Bombadil.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This morning I handed my son Christopher the completed manuscript of my &#39;Silmarillion&#39;, to be published no sooner than 2015...&quot;<br><br>&quot;My one wish is that no-one ever try to extend my sub-creation. Middle-earth is mine, and mine alone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I would like to restate what I have asserted all along: my writings are not fiction, but actually happened. I have spent many a happy hour in Rivendell, in the company of the sons of Elrond - and have encoded its location in the maps in my books.&quot;</i><br><br>I think that&#39;s enough to go along with. ;)<br><br>hS - &quot;To the hobbits!

            <p>I&#39;m going to have some extra time on my hands for the next week, and I plan to use some of it to go through the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic">Claimed Badfic</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Unclaimed_Badfic">Unclaimed Badfic</a> lists to remove any old or deleted postings. Claims older than 18 months will be bumped to the Unclaimed list. Old unclaimed fics will be removed altogether. Deleted fics from either list will be removed.<br><br>So, if you&#39;ve got a claim that&#39;s been sitting around for a year and a half or more, go in there and edit (or add) the date so I know you&#39;re still interested. Thanks!<br><br>I&#39;ll either reply to this thread or make a new post when I&#39;m about to start, depending on the Board&#39;s activity level between now and then.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Neshomeh, I don&#39;t think I have any claims older than 18 months--I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve even been a Boarder for 18 months yet, actually--but just in case, please leave mine be? I don&#39;t have enough time to go through them properly right now (limited internet and limited time, as I&#39;m on vacation in a different country). While there may well be a few I&#39;m going to un-claim, I&#39;m not currently sure which they are, and, like I said, don&#39;t have the time to do it right this second (not to mention you just requested not to edit those pages just now), so...<br><br>Yes. Please leave mine alone for now? I don&#39;t believe any of them are older than 16 months (wow), but if they are, just...notify me instead, or else consider everything of mine renewed for the moment? I&#39;ll go through it all properly when I get the chance (hopefully reasonably soon).<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Yes, we occasionally have troublemakers - who doesn&#39;t? But they either genuinely reform, are viewed with suspicion for a while, and then reintegrate fully - or they leave of their own accord - or they get kicked out. They don&#39;t hang around being deliberately provocative - or if they do, they&#39;re not <i>liked</i> for it.

            <p>I&#39;ve seen at least one instance of agents who take on a LotR fic and run across Boromire and comment that Jay will want to know where he got off to, or something similar. So, does that mean all identical misspellings manifest as a single mini? <br><br>Randa and I are working on a fic right now where Slytherin is spelled &#39;Slitheryn&#39; at least twice and Lily is spelled &#39;Lilly&#39; on multiple occasions, and need to know if each one spawns a separate mini or not. <br><br>Is it only one mini per misspelling in a given fic, or one mini for any misspelling in the entire continuum?</p>

            <p>One mini per misspelling. If the mini is owned they should make an effort to take it back home. It&#39;s agents are probably worried about it.<br><br>Usually if the name is consistently misspelled, then the mini stands in the place of the character.

            <p>Though, as people have said, sometimes things fail to produce actual minis, instead making things like clones. Those wouldn&#39;t share an identity with a mini of the same name.<br><br>What I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen is an agent encountering a mini which <i>knows them</i> - one which has previously been adopted by an agent they&#39;re familiar with.

            <p>I actually rewrote parts of the first couple of DOGA stories once already, and aim to rewrite them again when the Great Readthrough gets there. I feel generally dubious about all my PPC writing prior to, oh, mid-2005 - that&#39;s the majority of &#39;Tales from DOGA&#39;, and the pre-hiatus Reorg (plus a few sundries). The stuff after that, I&#39;m mostly content with - at least, right now I think I am! No doubt when I get to rereading it I&#39;ll cringe and edit the whole lot of it.<br><br>Anyway: it&#39;s hard to balance threat levels in a mission, particularly a cowrite. My missions tended towards the opposite extreme - the number of times in the DOGA files people almost got killed is unbelievable.<br><br>Anyanyway: like Terri says, it was a generally enjoyable mission. I&#39;m not sure you&#39;d ever have gotten much more than that out of someone who doesn&#39;t know what a Nanowriha is, or what&#39;s so lyrical about it. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re going to be editing, let me know when you get to &quot;Brown DragonRider.&quot; I&#39;d love a crack at fixing it up.

I keep thinking I&#39;m just going to go ahead and clean it up once and for all, but then I realize it&#39;ll take a lot of work and I could better spend my time on other things, and it would conflict with the version you have, and bleh.

            <p>This is something I have been wondering for a bit now. A certain youtuber has stated that a few game reviews he made makes up a movie. The thing about this supposed movie is that the storyline is bad to say the least. I was wondering what was the precedent for something like this in the PPC. Sorry if I seem rather vague I am both trying to not insult the guy in question while also trying to not give him views I feel he does not deserve.<br><br>Also, I would like to apologize for those that think I am just coming out of nowwhere posting here.

            <p>I was thinking of kind of having my first agent be one of my characters from Adventure Quest. Right now all I have is a barebones kind of character though. Might as well tell what I have I have thought up though.<br><br>Agent name would be Micharion, not his actual name mind. He is a necromancer from Lore, name of the planet that the game takes place on for the most part. He is not very talkative and chooses to have the skeleton that helps him fight do the talking for him. Also even though he is a necromancer he has a very strong sense of justice and the skeleton that he is with is a friend of his that passed before his time and let himself be reanimated.<br><br> That is about as far as I got with that.</p>

            <p>But there is one thing I forgot to mention. The part of the review that holds the storyline has a bit of a crossover feel. The review could very likely be entirely removed from it and the storyline itself comes under some problems, like having the main character intimidate a character like Wolverine. I really don&#39;t know how to explain this and keep in the PPC rules.</p>

            <p>This is actually nothing new to me about being so vague that I am unhelpful. His name is the Irate Gamer and in the parts of the videos that aren&#39;t game reviews he has some character from that game or series the game is based on be with him for some reason. I am more asking since in the penultimate and ultimate videos for his &quot;movie&quot; he used the megazord. I don&#39;t think I am leaving out anything too big to mention this time.<br><br>Also I do not suggest looking up his X-men review since generally he plays the characters in question. The disturbing thing is that he is rather weighty and dressed up as Storm in that one.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a little unsure how we count those, actually. His own storyline for his reviews would probably be an original canon, but I don&#39;t think those snippets would be taken as the canon character literally being there with him? Those portrayals are separate enough from the character&#39;s actual identity, and they&#39;re there for a specific enough purpose (that isn&#39;t really intended as fanfic) that, combined with the storyline&#39;s position as its own canon, it would probably be harmless to the original continuum. There are Real Person Fic implications too, but usually reviewers like IG are portraying a character as opposed to using an alias or something so we can maybe discount that.<br><br>To get at what I think you&#39;re getting at, though, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong, no, the PPC wouldn&#39;t go into an Irate Gamer review and kill him for say, having Storm or a Megazord show up.</p>

            <p>More so the storyline is just outright terrible with his character being an outright Gary Stu which has angered me about it before. The thing is about his whatever he wants to call it is that he also is trying to profit off of it with DVDs and the Megazord fight had outright stolen footage. Of course, my question probably has already been answered about this. Also I wouldn&#39;t have asked for the PPC in fact I would have probably done so myself just not bringing the PPC into it since his Mother has issues, I&#39;ll leave it at that. One concerning thing that she said makes it seem like either Irate Gamer and Bores are one and the same or that she is very far removed from reality.</p>

            <p>That is something that was discussed about it but we were debating whether we should or should not do so. One of the reasons we have for not doing so is that we don&#39;t want to give him more ammo than he already has against us.

            <p>I know this won&#39;t go official yet, but I want to think about it.<br><br>The species in the Legacy of Kain series are: humans, hylden, vampires, and demons.<br><br>Demons and hylden don&#39;t have proper names.  (One hylden is called The Sarafan Lord ((not sure about proper spelling)) and another is called The Seer.)<br><br>I&#39;m wondering if the minis should just follow the species that their namesakes come from, (risking the creation of a mini suit of armor named Malik,) or if I should go with mini-demons.  (The demons would have been funny, except that the mini-fire-demons wouldn&#39;t quite be mistaken for mini-Balrogs.)  I&#39;m leaning towards having the minis actually resemble who they are supposed to be, resulting in a one-foot-tall version of Janos named Yanos.<br><br>I&#39;ve decided that Moebius would have a doppelganger named Mobius that acts completely normal except that he is helpful when confronted by Sue-hunters like the PPC.  Probably the same with any other character who only appeared in Blood Omen because many fans have only experienced that one secondhand through unofficial walkthroughs.</p>

            <p>of an unexplored canon is a great honor that should not be taken lightly.<br><br>Unfortunately I don’t know anything about <i>The Legacy of Kain</i>, so I can’t help you with the details. But there are some general rules that can be derived from watching Minis in other canons.<br><br>There may be some exceptions for word worlds which I don’t know well, but generally the Minis are based on <b>one</b> species, thus &quot;<i>just follow the species that their namesakes come from&quot;</i> doesn’t sound like a good idea. Keeping Minis consistent would be preferable over creating another exception. Also, a well-written Mini keeps the personality of the character it is supposed to be, but, with minor variations, the physical features of the species it is based on.<br><br>Often, the Minis are based on something that occurred only briefly in canon, not one of the main (antagonist) forces. This may disqualify demons, vampires, hylden and humans. Are there any minor monsters or machines that qualify as &quot;creepy if their Mini versions weren’t so cute in the agents’ eyes&quot;? (Machines? Yes, among others we have mini-telescreens from <i>1984</i>).<br><br>Since the misspellings that spawn Minis shouldn’t exist in good writing, looking for something that &quot;shouldn’t be there&quot; may also help to find the Mini species. The reason why it &quot;shouldn’t be there&quot; may vary. In many canons, it involves &quot;created by an evil being for malevolent purposes&quot;, like Balrogs, or it may just canonically be encountered in a place where it canonically shouldn’t live, like Aragog in Hogwart’s Forbidden Forrest (Acromantulas are supposed to be a tropical species). More examples may be found in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255468;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this discussion</a> of the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255469;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Pokemon Minis</a>.<br><br>Lacking knowledge, I cannot comment on this doppelganger business.<br><br>HG, trying to be helpful.</p>

            <p>Demons are not supposed to be there, signaling that something is wrong with the world.  However, they are almost omni-present because canonically there is something wrong with the world at all times.  Hylden were banished, except that barely-canonical game where they got unbanished, and some stories are about before this happened.<br><br>There are Blood Omen specific entities that only happen in a small space, but they are not cute.  The animated toys from the Dollmaker&#39;s, and the eyeless wretches.<br><br>Sluagh are widespread creatures that only exist in the spectral realm.  Having them exist in the physical world would indicate a mini, or something that needs attention anyway.  (I have seen some physical sluagh, but I would be surprised to find one in a sporkable fic.)  And they have huge eyes, which should help in their cute factor.</p>

            <p>The Elder God? As I recall, he&#39;s not actually a god, just an opportunistic invader from another dimension (or something like that). If he&#39;s a member of a species rather than a totally unique entity, that might work. In mini-form, he&#39;d basically be an octopus with too many eyes, right?<br><br>Otherwise, Sluagh sounds most promising to me.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m conducting a quick survey on villains. Nothing fancy, just a few questions. I am doing some research on all the websites I can, so I decided, why not ask here as well?<br><br>1. Who is the best villain you have ever known; give examples why<br><br>2. Who is the most terrifying villain you have ever known; give examples why<br><br>3. Who is the least effective or worst villain you have ever known; give examples why<br><br>4. Who is the most sympathetic villain you have ever known; give examples why<br><br>Remember: You can use villains from absolutely any franchise. But give examples why you personally classified those villains the way you did.</p>

<li>Joker... just Joker.  Not only is he scary, he is unpredictable, smart, and UTTERLY INSANE.<br><br>2. The Brethren Moons from Dead Space.  They don&#39;t have an active role, at least for the most part, but they are moon sized conglomerations of millions of tons of dead flesh, with the combined intelligence of all of that flesh, and are hell bent on literally devouring all living things in the universe.  THEY HAVE WIPED OUT EVERY SINGLE SPECIES IN THE GALAXY EXCEPT HUMANS.<br><br>3. Fanfiction-styled Sakura Haruno from Naruto.  If that doesn&#39;t count, then Ice King from Adventure Time.<br><br>4. Andrew Ryan.  He was an a**hole, sure, but he had a dream, and he saw it through, even as it came crashing down around his ears.  And then his city is usurped by his worst enemy.  And then a not-so-worst-enemy right after.</li>

            <p>Hmm...<br><br>1. Makishima Shougo from Psycho-Pass. In the show, a vast computer network called the Sybil System more or less dominates everyone&#39;s lives (and in fact determines what job you should go into). Makishima is out to destroy it, and he does so at least partly by taking advantage of people&#39;s dependence on the system. (See, for example, the scene where he kills Akane&#39;s best friend after her Dominator fails.) This guy never loses his cool, quotes classic literature (including the Bible at one point), and takes no prisoners. Sociopaths make great villains, huh?<br><br>2. The Autons. Mannequins look creepy enough without being under control of an alien hive mind. Especially not when said hive mind can extend to a trash can and somehow replace Mickey with one of them. (Also the hound from &quot;The Hounds of Baskerville&quot; even though we never actually see it.)<br><br>3. [no data]<br><br>4. Hmm, probably Grovyle from Explorers of Time/Darkness/Sky. He steals the Time Gears, which is a pretty Bad Idea, but it&#39;s all to fix up the future. Plus, he used to be the protagonist&#39;s partner back when he/she was a human, so he can&#39;t be all that bad. (You can tell I haven&#39;t gotten to that part of the story in a long long time.)</p>

            <p>I think best villain is Xanatos because he rarely lost.  Though at lot of the time it was a technicality of plan G still having a favorable outcome.  Except half of the time his schemes weren&#39;t that evil despite what happened when they were evil.  It&#39;s like he would use his powers for good if he had more of a conscience and was only motivated by boredom instead of the will to win.<br><br>I&#39;d like to include Turbo as a best example of a villain. He has pure thoughtless greed as his motivation, and uses a variety of ways to be evil.  (He seems to have more charisma than Hitler.)<br><br>I used to be afraid of Mum-Ra when I was five.  The cloners from Star Wars bothered me because they loved making weapons, but they aren&#39;t villains.  I guess I&#39;ll say the Borg because they were just coldly efficient and you couldn&#39;t even argue with them; and I don&#39;t really watch anything scary.<br><br>Jumba from Lilo and Stitch is least effective because he seems like his heart isn&#39;t into villainy.  He just wants to be known as an evil genius, (and his hobby happens to be illegal and dangerous without mention of if that&#39;s why he chose it.)  But he got distracted because saving the day was more interesting at the moment.<br><br>Wreck-it-Ralph is sympathetic, but he&#39;s not a villain because it&#39;s his job.  It&#39;s like hating the garbage man because he stinks.  Silver from Treasure Planet has a soft spot and gets sympathy in return even though he did kill.  I do like realistically-motivated villains but can&#39;t think of the best example.  Lurky from Rainbow Brite does it because his mother yelled at him and she never explained what she meant.<br><br>I&#39;m disappointed that I couldn&#39;t shoehorn a Tony Jay villain like Frollo in here.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, even if the properties involved are older.<br><br>1. Handsome Jack (<i>Borderlands 2</i>). The thing that impressed me about Jack the most was how well he covered the gamut of villainy over the arc of the game. He starts out as a smug and rather petty jackass, calling you just to brag about how awesome and wealthy and clever he is and how much you suck. He&#39;s simultaneously infuriating and hilarious. <br><br>BUT THEN the first twist occurs. Turns out Jack is almost exactly as clever as he says he is: he not only manipulated you, he manipulated the main characters of the first game as well. Everything has gone according to his intentions so far. His gloating intensifies, but now the player starts getting a fuller picture of how nasty and sadistic he really is.<br><br>BUT THEN the second twist occurs. You see the extent to which he&#39;s willing to go to achieve his vision, and it is fairly frightening. You do something that Jack takes EXTREMELY personal. His messages are still humorous, but now the barbs he flings at you are more pointed and cruel. He wants you dead, but at his own hands. He threatens the lives of any who would kill you and thus deprive him of his vengeance.<br><br>And then finally, to complete the villainous sweep, he has his final breakdown rant at the end of the game. In his own twisted mind, HE was the hero of this story. So to see you triumphant over him... he just doesn&#39;t get it.<br><br>HONORABLE MENTION - David Xanatos (<i>Gargoyles</i>)<br><br>2. Judge Doom (<i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i>). I&#39;ll admit: this one is all nostalgia-based. Doom was the one villain I can remember from my childhood that terrified the hell out of me, even before the big reveal at the end. I don&#39;t spook as well now, but the last time I saw him still set the hairs on the back of my neck on end. His demeanor and appearance, even the way he moves, almost felt uncanny valley-ish. <br><br>HONORABLE MENTION - Hannibal Lector (<i>Silence of the Lambs</i>)<br><br>3. Amon (<i>The Legend of Korra</i>). A charismatic and manipulative speaker. A fighter who could outclass any Bender, even the Avatar. A master tactician whose henchmen were superior to the armed forces. Amon was so competent at everything, he became boring. I&#39;m not interested in a villain who can curb-stomp any and all comers until the finale rolls around. I like heroes and villains who are capable of failure. Failure makes them human. Failure makes them relatable.<br><br>DISHONORABLE MENTION - Cersei Lannister (the original version of her from <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>; the television <i>Game of Thrones</i> version is rather more sympathetic)<br><br>4. The Ice King (<i>Adventure Time</i>). He started out as a joke. A pathetic and easily-thwarted dope who kidnapped princesses and didn&#39;t really seem all there. But then &quot;Holly Jolly Secrets, Part II&quot; came out, and we discovered WHY he was like that. Suddenly he didn&#39;t seem as funny anymore. And it only got worse from there, what with his interactions with Marceline. There&#39;s a scene in of the the written comics where the Ice King is trapped in his greatest desire by the Lich. Finn and Jake have to break the illusion by destroying that which he has always wanted. And it is... rough to read.<br><br>HONORABLE MENTION - Mr. Freeze (<i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>)</p>

            <p>1) don&#39;t know about best villain ever, but one of my favorites is the Joker. No matter how crazy and insane he made be, he is the perfect anti-thesis for Batman. And we all know how good Batman is...<br><br>2) Don&#39;t know about most terrifying, The Queen Of Blades. Besides the scary appearance and utter destruction she causes, the fact that as both a gamer, and as Raynor in game you know exactly who she was before she became the Queen, and the fact that, as the gamer you controlled her on that mission that lead to her becoming what she is (even if you put a solid few lines of bunker&#39;s siege tanks and missile turrets the zerg still overwhelm you). And that somewhere beneath all of it is still Sarah Kerrigan. It gives me the shivers. <br><br>3) Not quite a standard example, but in Dragon Age Origins: Awakening a side quest reveals that some bandits have kidnapped a nobleman&#39;s daughter and he wants you and your group (who are all quite badass by themselves) to get her back. Arrive at the bandit camp (which, is situated on the edge of a cliff. (Note this for later)) and the bandit leader will talk to you. You get a couple of lines back, where you can reveal yourself as the Commander of the Grey (note this means you&#39;ve killed hundreds of monsters, demons, bandits etc. And an Archdemon that used to be an old god (and is also a dragon)). The next time you get to choose a speech option there&#39;s an intimidate option, pick it and half the bandits run away, including one who decides to jump off a cliff instead of facing you. Or you pick the persuade option which means they give you the girl BEFORE you give them the money. Either way much bandit killing ensues. I think they win the prize for stupidest villains if nothing else. <br><br>4) N, definitely N. He&#39;s been bought up, only being raised around Pokemon who have been badly treated by their trainers and thus wants a world where those kind of Pokemon don&#39;t suffer, however due to his father&#39;s manipulations he thinks all trainers are like this to their Pokemon. The whole plot line with N in both Black/White and Black 2/White 2 are the best plots in the whole of the Pokemon series IMO and the end scene of Black is the only time in the main series I&#39;ve ever let out manly tears. (PMD has about one per game for me otherwise)</p>

            <p>Now this will naturally be spoiler-y, so here we go.<br><br>1) Kerghan the Terrible (Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura)<br>From a certain point of view Kerghan is not actually a villain.<br>He&#39;s spent his two thousand years in banishment meditating on life and death, along with some practical experiments (he was, after all, the one who discovered the Necromantic Black school of magic) and finally came to the conclusion that the afterlife is preferrable to normal existence.<br>What makes him a threat is his desire to show everyone by killing everyone and his utter blindness to other views (unless the player happens to possess a Master rank in Persuasion, compare: Fallout.)<br>So why is he, as I&#39;ve stated, not necessarily evil?<br>That is because he is <i>right</i>. His research on the state of the afterlife is correct, two party members (one undead, one resurrected) can confirm this. His work, should he succeed, will also result in the liberation of all undead souls from their host bodies, which is considered quite merciful given the universe&#39;s description of the undead (a soul torn from the world of the dead and forced into a body - even an animal carcass - that has just barely been restored to working order.)<br>It should be noted that the player is given the option of assisting Kerghan in completing his goal. Doing so will, however, render most morally &quot;good&quot; party members hostile and willing to fight to the death.<br><br>2) Tough one to decide, but it will have to be SHODAN.<br>What she has managed to do to all life within her reach borders on Reaper territory - and instead of a collective of who-knows-how-many-thousand species, each consisting of billions of individuals harvested and processed she was <i>just one AI</i>. One computer system turned rogue, managed to get awfully close to godhood, survived two purges (one by cyberjack, the other by bullet) and is still around if the second game&#39;s ending is to be believed...although I somehow have little hope to ever see System Shock 3.<br><br>3) The Catalyst. It&#39;s when Mass Effect stopped making sense. The Reapers were supposedly designed to protect all sentient life from exactly the same kind of phenomenon that they themselves <i>are</i>. It makes very little sense - and making sense should be what advanced AIs ought to excel in.<br><br>4) Again, a very tough one. But I sympathise very much with Nightmare Moon.<br>She is a phenomenon resulting from fear of rejection, which she herself rejected. I assume self-pity factored in, envy certainly did.<br>She became vindictive, aggressive and potentially delusional. It is likely that she would refuse any help given and any kindness shown as she views the world as hostile.<br>She was clearly proud of her unwavering loyalty to her own beliefs, incorrect and harmful as they are. After all everyone else abandoned her, so why should she not believe in herself?<br>Overall she shows flaws that I can relate to, the presence of which I can feel within myself.<br>Arrogance.<br>Contempt.<br>Pride.<br>Envy.</p>

            <p>These are probably not my Ultimate Answers, because there are so many things I know I&#39;m not thinking of, but it&#39;s something.<br><br>1. My favorite villain is Scorpius from <i>Farscape</i>. He&#39;s brilliant, well-spoken, ruthless, and incredibly disciplined—when he looses his cool, you know it&#39;s time to run away really, really fast. And that&#39;s not just an expression. Being a hybrid of the cold-loving Sebacean race and the heat-generating Scarran race, his own body is constantly at war with itself, and he has to wear a cooling suit with a cooling rod that goes <i>right into his brain</i> to keep from overheating. The fact that he overcomes this physical difficulty with little to no help and manages to work himself up into a position of power in the notoriously xenophobic Peacekeeper military shows you exactly the kind of determined genius you&#39;re dealing with when Scorpius is in the picture. He never wastes energy, he is always charming (well, almost always), and he gets things <i>done</i>. He is just awesome.<br><br>2. My first thought for this one was Judge Doom from <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i> He&#39;s crazy, he puts that poor little cartoon shoe in the Dip (scarred me for life), he looks somehow wrong the whole time and then his whole body melts off and his eyes pop out and HOLY CRAP AHHH. He&#39;s classic wet-your-pants scary.<br><br>I also thought of the guy from <i>Red Dragon</i>, whose name I can&#39;t remember right now. Anybody who murders his family pets is horrifying. Not to mention the many other disturbing things in that book, which I can&#39;t even remember because my brain has blocked them out. (That whole book is psychologically disturbing. This is the whole point, though. I recommend it!)<br><br>3. Least effective villain I can think of is what&#39;s-her-name from <i>Divergence</i>. You know, the blonde Erudite lady who decides her caste is best fit to control the others, being so smart and all, and then gets foiled by a couple of kids who joined the caste famed for being brawny and reckless. Her plan was stupid, her reasons for coming up with it in the first place were stupid, and literally all I can remember about her is thinking how stupid she was.<br><br>4. I&#39;m not sure I can properly articulate this one, but all I can think of for most sympathetic villain is the Lone Power from the <i>Young Wizards</i> series. It&#39;s tricky because He* is literally the Devil, and every other Being of Ultimate Evil you&#39;ve ever heard of. He&#39;s the guy who invented pain, suffering, and death, and He spends His time tempting newly formed intelligences over to the ways of entropy so as to speed up the end of the Universe. But... He had a good reason? Entropy is why we have time. Death is why we appreciate life. Pain and suffering are what drive us to create, so we can overcome them.<br><br>And the thing is, His siblings, the other Powers That Be, They want Him back. The fact that They rejected Him in the first place is half the problem. They didn&#39;t like His ideas, so He went rogue and forced them on Creation anyway, so things are really screwed up—but they don&#39;t have to be. The PTBs and the One (read: God), who give the wizards their power to fight the Lone One, don&#39;t want Him destroyed, They want Him redeemed. And so do I.<br><br>* Technically all the Powers That Be are genderless, and usually referred to as It, but that&#39;s kinda weird. And so is capitalizing all the pronouns, but oh well.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>We&#39;ve seen the Lone Power... eight times in the main series (or nine if you count its actions in <i>Wizard of Mars</i> as an appearance - but it&#39;d be tricky). Wikipedia suggests It appeared in <i>Book of Night with Moon</i> as well, so it may be in <i>all</i> the books (except <i>Mars</i>). So, out of all Its manifestations: which would you class as best/scariest/worst/most sympathetic?<br><br>(Reason I&#39;m not replying to this thread as a whole: I just can&#39;t think of any! Blah.

            <p>I would have to re-read the whole series first. It&#39;s been a while.

            <p>That&#39;s a tricky one - particularly since &#39;sympathetic&#39; usually means I don&#39;t think of them as a villain at all.<br><br>Best: I&#39;m assuming this is &#39;most effective&#39;. I&#39;d have to pin that on the Mysterious Somebody, since he, y&#39;know, won, and ruled the PPC for ten years. Then he ruled an empire of Mary-Sue Factories. Then he stomped over every portion of the PPC he came into contact with. Then he made it as far as the SO&#39;s office before dying of - naturally - betrayal. Yeah, I think he wins.<br><br>Alternately: the Garden government on Origin. The PPC presents itself as winning the Civil War - but we totally lost! We were driven away from Origin, spent the entire war nearly failing to defend <i>three doors</i>, and had to give up all our research labs in Old HQ. Then the Government cheerfully held the planet - and when the PPC came back, they forced us to stay locked in our compound under constant threat of being wiped out. Their move in getting hold of all our technology was genius.<br><br>Of course, then their planet blew up. I said they were <i>effective</i>, not right. ;) (Though, actually, since they were the ones who said that mucking about with plotholes was dangerous...)<br><br>Scariest: probably the off-screen Old Ones of the TCDA. We only see them through <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1HxGTI3oe4c7Shyi_W-6pX_ZvJOz4ekCm9FeEQzxzArY">Dassie&#39;s nightmares</a>, and they terrify me. Possibly because they&#39;re the Mysterious Somebody in horror form, and he would be my second choice.<br><br>Least effective: the Black Cats as a whole (not the DIS, but the <i>Black Cats</i>). Sure, they abducted a few agents in the, uh, <i>seven years</i> they spent planning their invasion - and they took down HQ&#39;s shields - but when they got inside, they managed to fail at eight of their nine objectives, killing only the Wisteria. Their entire high command got taken out by individual commandos. An entire <i>division</i> of theirs went rogue without them being aware of it. They were, frankly, incompetent. (They never noticed Tango hanging about outside their camp for seven years, either - and they never caught Nyx and Dassie)<br><br>Most sympathetic: I&#39;m going to have to go with Iplis, from <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9130619/14/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Discworld">OFUDisc</a>. She tries to kill Penny, and doesn&#39;t really seem all that sorry about it - but on the other hand, she shows all the signs of being genuinely in love with her. Further, she&#39;s just an ordinary girl who wrote that she wanted to be a vampire if she died, ha ha - I don&#39;t think she knew what she was letting herself in for. That&#39;s why I brought her back for the sequel.<br><br>I know, none of those were useful for Dark Brother - but they were interesting to think about.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>As for the Lone Power - going purely from memory:<br><br>#1: Businessman/Dark Horseman<br>#2: Singer/Megakraken<br>#3: Logo/Dark Horseman again (without his horse)<br>#4: Some Irish Giant<br>#5: Nita&#39;s alien friend (and apparently a direct showdown at the end)<br>#6: The one trapped by... Darryl?<br>#7: The bored one.<br>#8: The King/the Wolf That Ate the Moon<br>#9: None<br><br>Least effective has to go to either <i>Alone</i> or <i>Holiday</i> - though, saying that, <i>Holiday</i> is the only one who actually flat-out beats Nita and Kit. They only escape because It forgot about Ponch, and also blind luck; they had no plan by the end of the book.<br><br>(And on the flip side, you could argue that <i>High</i> was the least effective, since it&#39;s the only version to have lost, conclusively and absolutely. It&#39;s difficult when the same villain keeps being beaten...)<br><br>The most effective, and to me the scariest, is the Wolf That Ate the Moon (I know, that didn&#39;t quite happen - but I like the name). The darkness was the only instance that actually managed to defeat, uh, almost everyone.<br><br>Most sympathetic... probably the bored one, since we get to spend the most time talking to Her. Or, if you want to interpret things literally - the Hesper. ;)<br><br>hS talks lots</p>

            <p>1) Sovereign, from the <i>Mass Effect</i> series. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvrIFIjTGt0">Listen to this.</a> Thar be spoilers beyond that link, so... yeah.<br><br>2) Carcer Dun, from Terry Pratchett&#39;s <i>Night Watch</i>. There is no redeeming the man: he sees all the rules we make up in our society to keep our darker impulses in check and just decides to <i>not follow them</i>. He is a psychotic mass murderer and the most chilling thing about his character is the fact that he&#39;s completely detached from the crimes he&#39;s committing; it is said that Carcer can savagely stab a person to death in front of a crowd and behave like a totally innocent person when confronted. What distinguishes him from some other person playing dumb is that Carcer sees his actions as just being &quot;naughty&quot;. He has no restraints. He has no morals. He is the embodiment of chaotic evil. Carcer provokes a visceral reaction of disgust from the reader, even if it&#39;s the zillionth time you read the book.<br><br>You will <i>love</i> to <i>hate</i> him. <br><br>3) King Sombra from <i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i>. Let&#39;s face it: he was a laughing shadow for most of the episode. Not exactly threat material if you ask me.<br><br>4) Bowser, from <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> I mean, sure he kidnaps the princess every now and then, but he plays sports and go-carts with you on his days off. He even loans out his castle as a race track. Unfortunately, whenever things seem to go well for him, bad things (read: hilarious antics) start happening to the Koopa King. All in all, he&#39;s a pretty cool dude if you ask me.</p>

            <p>1: Definitely Arvis, of <i>Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</i>. Well, actually it&#39;s probably Manfroy, the guy behind Arvis&#39;s plots, but Arvis actually <i>kills the protagonist</i>. And brainwashes and marries said protagonist&#39;s wife. Who happens to be Arvis&#39;s <i>sister</i>. Arvis then presides over a regime that kidnaps children and forces them to fight to the death; the survivors become &#39;aristocracy&#39; under the thumb of the Loptyr sect. Mind, Arvis&#39;s son Julius is even <i>worse</i>, due to being the physical body of the evil god Loptyr; this guy kills his mother while trying to kill his sister.<br>2: Most terrifying? Not entirely sure, but all the people on my shortlist are Hero Killers. There&#39;s Findo Gask, from the <i>Word and the Void</i> series, who is ruthless with his followers and tenacious as anything, not to mention clever. And Badrang the Tyrant, of <i>Redwall</i> (the series, not the book); bastard killed Martin&#39;s girlfriend Rose and had Martin the Warrior himself captive. Then there&#39;s Lysandre, from <i>Pokémon X and Y</i>, who literally attempts genocide to make the world &#39;beautiful&#39;.<br>3: I don&#39;t know whether they count as a villain, but Doctor Who&#39;s Weeping Angels in everything but <i>Blink</i> are just... not scary at all. Which is a shame, really.<br>4: Easy: N Harmonia, of <i>Pokémon Black and White</i>. He&#39;s not even really a villain, just an antagonist. He basically intends to conquer the region with a legendary Pokémon in order to command people to release their Pokémon, because he believes all people treat Pokémon as slaves. He gradually comes to realise that there are other people who treat Pokémon with respect and love, and is on the verge of stepping down when his father, the Complete Monster Ghetsis, comes along and reveals that he&#39;d been manipulating N from birth, only showing him Pokémon who had been abandoned by horrible people. Ghetsis&#39;s plan was to have N order everyone to release their Pokémon, then dispose of him and rule the region by being the only one who still had Pokémon.<br>Others include Fëanor (he&#39;s nowhere near heroic, but he <i>was</i> mad with grief, so understandable), Lyon of <i>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</i> (who loses his father and receives a prophecy that his country will be ravaged by an earthquake, and accidentally becomes possessed by an ancient demon king while trying to reverse the former and avert the latter. Oh, and he&#39;s in love with the heroine but can&#39;t compete with her brother for her love) and Ontic Laison (to a lesser extent; she killed Imbolc Telyan, which makes me hate her, but she did go through some pretty bad stuff).<br>Gee, sympathetic villains are just crawling out of the woodwork. I could go on, but that&#39;s enough, I think.</p>

            <p>1) Whatever overlord put together the list if &#39;Things I must not do if I am an evil overlord&#39; list. Wait, that doesn&#39;t count? Hmm... If I ever find a villain who does the sensible things and kill the hero immediately instead of sentencing him to a slow death by a watery pit of hungry crocodiles armed with lasers and then stand there and laugh, saying &#39;Escape is impossible!&#39;, then that&#39;s the one I vote for.<br><br>2) Fenrir Greyback from Harry Potter. Not only is he a sick cannibal whose favorite targets are children, but he also gives this &#39;I&#39;m going to rape you&#39; vibe. I still sometimes have nightmares about him.<br><br>3) The Grunts from any Pokemon villain team. Usually when the player storms the team&#39;s secret headquarters, the Grunts will randomly tell you important information after you beat them and are sometimes insanely stupid. Best example would have to be in X/Y when you&#39;re about to clear out the Kalos power plant and need a key to get in. The Grunt blocking the way says something like &quot;Oh no! I&#39;ve dropped the key! I think I last had it when I was standing nine steps east of where I am now! Maybe if I used the Dowsing Machine, I could find it!&quot;<br><br>4) Megamind. He tried so hard to be bad, but he was kind of... bad at that. I want to give him a hug. :)</p>

            <p>1) Syndrome (The Incredibles)- even if he didn&#39;t read the Evil Overlord List, he&#39;s still pretty darn good at it. He builds a nigh unbeatable robot by testing it on superheroes, and threatens to steal Mr Incredible&#39;s son out of pure bitterness and hatred.<br><br>2) I can&#39;t honestly think of anybody at the moment. But the traits I look for in a scary villain is not necessarily being stronger than the hero. It&#39;s the unpredictability and single-minded devotion to a cause. Also, superior strategy. Nothing is worse than a villain with a Batman Gambit. <br><br>3) Starfinger (Legion of Superheroes TV series)- seriously? The man is completely incompetent. His powers would actually be useful if he utilized them properly, but… The dude&#39;s a weirdo with a really bad accent.<br><br>4) Megamind (Megamind)- Watch the movie. The whole plot is how he&#39;s actually a sympathetic bad guy who realizes that he doesn&#39;t want the role that the rest of the world has put him in. Do watch the movie. It&#39;s hilarious.</p>

            <p>Villainsvillainsvillainsvillains--ahem.  Warning.  Fan ranting ahead.<br><br>1. Gabriel Gray/Sylar (<i>Heroes</i>)<br>This dude . . . is just awesome, yo.  When he was first introduced in season one, all we were shown were the gruesome and physics-defying results of his murder scenes.  We never even saw him closely for the entire first half of the season--he was just a figure in shadows, throwing stuff and people through the air with a flick of his hand.  When we finally did meet him, he had a creepy, intense stare and a slightly gravelly, creepy voice.  Zachary Quinto used these to great effect and combined them with an obsessive, disturbing curiosity in his performance to drive home the <i>hunger</i> that lay behind Sylar&#39;s character: He wants to see how you <i>work</i>, and he&#39;s going to open you up and examine your parts like a clock to do it.  he also had a really awesome <s>theme song</s> background sound effect of ticking clocks to underline the twisted function of his mind.  Sylar is very much the driving force of season one&#39;s plot, to the point where he essentially hijacks another plot to turn himself into the final challenge for the protagonists at the end of the season.<br><br><i>Heroes</i> suffered from a good deal of shoddy writing, and in later seasons began irritatingly waffling back and forth between flirting with redemption and going back to being stone-cold insane and evil.  But despite all of that, he <i>still stayed awesome</i>.  He frequently beat the snot out of the villains of future plot lines, as if to remind the universe how awesome he was.  He&#39;s both smart and insane, manipulative and brutally forceful, and is pretty much the best character on the whole show.<br><br>2. Human!Yawgmoth (<i>Magic: the Gathering</i>)<br>Yawgmoth spent most of his character career as the unseen lord of Phyrexia, a land of organisms composed partly of machinery and partly of undying flesh.  The Phyrexian armies were entirely devoted to Yawgmoth, and single-mindedly carried out his plans to spread glorious machine compleation (not a typo) throughout the entire multiverse.  When Yawgmoth finally appeared on screen, he was revealed to be a sapient black cloud of death, swiftly flowing across the plane of Dominaria to choke out all the imperfect life and fold it into himself.<br><br>None of that makes Yawgmoth particularly terrifying; it&#39;s pretty par for the course with dark lords in fantasy settings.  Yawgmoth is terrifying because of his behavior as an ostensibly normal human during the prequel novel <i>The Thran</i>.  Yawgmoth&#39;s behavior as just as monstrous as a human as he would later be as a monster--but it&#39;s all the more terrifying because he is presented as just a regular human with some very, very sick ideas.  After being attacked by a bear and receiving an injured arm, the mage who heals him has to chide him for poking around the wound and infecting it.  He responds by saying that he couldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to study human body parts.  Already, he was looking at living things as parts.  (An older version of the story, which I believe is unfortunately no longer canon, had him <i>remove sinews and tendons from the bear&#39;s arm to replace his injured ones</i>.)  Yawgmoth is all about upgrades, you see; when he learns about the existence of planeswalkers (super-wizards who don&#39;t age), he captures one and has some of minions peel open her body one cubic meter at a time looking for the one special thing that made her different, so that Yawgmoth could insert it into himself and become more powerful.  One line summarizes Yawgmoth&#39;s entire character: after months of striving to fight a plague (which it&#39;s heavily implied that he created and spread in the first place), he felt that the people he had helped weren&#39;t acting respectfully enough.  When the leader of those people chided him for his ego, saying that Yawgmoth was a healer, not a god, Yawgmoth replied, &quot;After everything I have done for these people?  They had damn well better treat me as a god.&quot;<br><br>Yawgmoth was an ordinary man who believed he deserved godhood--and he made it happen.<br><br>I&#39;m going to get major flack for this one, but<br>3. Professor James Moriarty (<i>The Final Problem</i><br>Yeah, I know, it&#39;s <i>Moriarty</i>, but bare with me.  Most of what you think about Moriarty comes from later adaptions of Holmes stories, like <i>Sherlock</i> or even <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>.  But the original Moriarty?  Is basically a non-entity when seen through the lens of the entire, original Doyle canon.  If I may be uncharacteristically crude, Moriarty was basically an asspull of Doyle&#39;s part as part of his attempt to kill off Holmes and move on to other writings (which I&#39;m not criticizing; it was his right to do so).  Moriarty is thrown into the story just to be killed off and take Holmes with him.  He is shown to have high intellect, like Holmes, and good fighting skills and strength, like Holmes.  But because he never shows up in any other story, all that info basically just rings false; it&#39;s too much &quot;tell, don&#39;t show&quot; and it makes for a rather impotent and forgettable villain (again, looking only at the original canon <s>which is all that exists</s>).<br><br>4. Seymour Guado (<i>Final Fantasy X</i>)<br>This is an opinion that I&#39;ve only developed recently.  Back in high school, all my FF fan friends and I <i>hated</i> Seymour (and I&#39;m embarrassed to admit, a lot of that was childish, group-of-males reaction of, &quot;Ew, he&#39;s so <i>effeminate</i>, why doesn&#39;t he put on a shirt <s>and also speak several octaves lower</s>).  Recently, though, I&#39;ve thought about his goals and motives more, and I find myself a lot more understanding of his position.<br><br>The setting of FFX in a nutshell is: &quot;A giant whale pops out of the ocean and obliterates entire cities, but sometimes a special summoner goes and beats the whale up and makes it leave us alone for two or three decades.&quot;  What the majority of the populace doesn&#39;t know is that every time that happens, the summoner is sacrificing someone they love, which then becomes the new whale.  The original summoner, who started that whole summoner religion, was using the sacrifices and their giant whale body-thing-whatever as a protecive vessel, using the people&#39;s reverence for himself to keep himself alive forever, and using what everyone thought was salvation and safety to perpetuate their destruction.<br><br>Seymour was a summoner, and sacrificed his mom to fight the whale--except he never tried to fight it.  Instead, he looked at the endless cycle of death and temporary peace in his world, and he saw only one hope, one way to end the suffering: kill everyone in the world.  With everyone on Spira gone and unable to worship, the whale and the original summoner would die, too, finally ending the cycle.  To do this, Seymour saw that he had to sacrifice himself to another summoner to become their summon, allowing him to take control of the whale and obliterate the world and everyone in it.  It&#39;s absolutely insane, and he committed at least a few murders along the way, including his own father (and one near-genocide!), but in a world where the greatest hope is, &quot;maybe this most recent human sacrifice will get us three whole decades before the giant whale inevitably rises out of the sea and destroys entire cities again!&quot; Seymour sought escape and piece for everyone.  And while that wasn&#39;t the only way (the player party obviously fixes everything in the end), Seymour lived in a society almost completely dominated by the rhetoric of their faith, and it&#39;s hard to blame him for being unable to see beyond what he had taken for granted since he was a child.<br><br><s>He still has an annoying voice, though.</s><br><br>Well, not as annoying as Tidus&#39;s.</p>

            <p>Pretty much everything following Algul Siento felt really rushed.  Considering how much page space was dedicated to developing the characters of the Algul&#39;s leadership, compared to the two half-donkeyed fight scenes against Mordred and the Crimson King, it feels like VII should have been split into two books, with the last one expanding on the King way more.  And making him, you know, actually threatening and monstrous?<br><br>I actually didn&#39;t mind that final scene after the &quot;warning.&quot;  It makes a disturbing amount of sense to me, and it was hinted at pretty heavily in nearly every scene Roland shared with Walter.  I&#39;m convinced the Crimson King was also aware of the recursion, but couldn&#39;t figure out how to tell Roland, since telling the truth would make Roland automatically assume it was a lie.  That&#39;s why he spends his time on the Tower balcony going back and forth between trying to kill Roland and begging him to stop and listen, even after he had been reduced to a pair of eyeballs and Roland was already inside the Tower.<br><br>Random Fan Theory: I believe the thing in the tunnels under Castle Discordia is the same one as the one from <i>Children of the Corn</i>.  The monster in the latter definitely seems like a holdover from the receding of the Prim, with the movies implying it had been around since before Europeans colonized the Americas.  It&#39;s called He Walks Behind the Rows (of Corn), but in the movie version, the little psychic girl writes it as &quot;He Who Walks Behind the Rose.&quot;  And if you equate Roland with representing the quest to reach the field of roses, that&#39;s exactly what the one in <i>Dark Tower VII</i> was doing.  Of course, this assumes that HWWBtR moved, one way or the other, between In-World and one of the Earths connected with the Tower, but that&#39;s far from unusual for this series.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s exactly the sort of extended theory I&#39;d imagine people in HQ concocting, too. Remember, there were a lot of deep theoretical reasons why there could only be two multiverses - but then we discovered there were at least four. So someone needs to come up with a theory that says how many there <i>are</i> - and the icosahedron model certainly seems possible!<br><br>That would make for twenty multiverses - a fairly large number that means we won&#39;t run through them soon. It eliminates the Void as the primary background; instead, it makes each plane of interaction a &#39;Void between the Verses&#39;. Bridge-type mergers would simply be the wall breaking down; perhaps a Bridge shuffles the internal portions of the pyramid, dragging two connected parts closer and closer to the wall until they touch.<br><br>Each multiverse would have three close contacts - Prime and Mirror, at minimum, have these, and Dafydd&#39;s trips to Steampunk suggest it does, too. If there were a consistent way of tunnelling through the wall, experiments could be done to map the Icosahedron - but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible yet.<br><br>As for the centre... making it the Real World would be a bit dubious, since the Prime Multiverse is <i>very nearly</i> our own (and also since it would claim the Real World has an in-story existence, which it, y&#39;know, doesn&#39;t. Fictional people can&#39;t actually travel to reality). There may be some kind of nexus, or it may simply be an artefact of the model - it might not <i>actually</i> exist at all.<br><br>Of course, the question for the theorists then becomes, how do we know it&#39;s an icosahedron? How can we prove it? We could go into different multiverses and see which ones are easy to access from there - again, if we had easy trans-multiversal travel tech. Which it seems Dafydd does... perhaps he borrowed it from Lou? Doubtless the theory team need to talk to him.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Though, of course, the image of the Icosahedron as an actual d20 calls to mind the ending of <i>Men in Black</i>... which is entirely appropriate, really.<br><br>Entanglement - probably not technically quantum, but of <i>some</i> kind - is definitely the best word to describe the leeching/parasitism mechanism. As for Word Worlds in other Word Worlds, simple - <i>Doctor Who</i> is heavily, ah, abstractly canonically entangled (so the term is &#39;ACE&#39;, and &#39;ACEd&#39;) with World One. That includes J.K. Rowling - so the idea of the <i>Harry Potter</i> books existing there just means that the series of books is being &#39;puppetted&#39; - ACEd - by <i>Doctor Who</i>.<br><br>Possibly more difficult is the fact that the Doctor appears in person in <i>Young Wizards</i> (and no doubt elsewhere). Do we have to claim that YW and DW are the same continuum? Nah - we just say that a portion of <i>High Wizardry</i> became ACEd with a portion of <i>Doctor Who</i>. The Doctor (baseline) wasn&#39;t affected by it, because it was only one instance.<br><br>As for Euclidean geometry - probably not! But that&#39;s what models are for. Space-time can&#39;t be accurately represented by a rubber sheet, either, nor electrons by discrete point charges in mysterious &#39;orbitals&#39;, but that doesn&#39;t stop us using them - and doesn&#39;t stop them being a very good model.<br><br>hS - gotcha!</p>

            <p>NOTE: I am not a physicist <s>but I play one on the internet</s> and so can&#39;t really comment on the accuracy of theories and whatnot. Everything I&#39;m about to talk about is from my perspective as a writer and a consumer of many kinds of speculative fiction.<br><br>First off, I&#39;m quite glad to see something like this being written for the PPC. There&#39;s always a part of me that is curious about the nitty-gritty regarding how a universe functions. Yes, I know, &quot;just repeat to yourself it&#39;s just a show/book/game/whatever,&quot; but sometimes it&#39;s really hard. I like facts, dammit!<br><br>Multiverses and how the PPC fits into them is something I&#39;ve been thinking about for a while now -- going all the way back to before my departure from the Board, actually. I even had a draft of a mission where several of my agents encountered versions of themselves from an alternate PPC. While the story ultimately foundered and was abandoned, I knew I still wanted to touch on the concept of multiverses. That little bit with the Department of Improbable AUs in my first post-return <a href="http://vgdivision.dreamwidth.org/6058.html">story</a> was meant to sort of set the groundwork for future stories running along those lines.<br><br>I like how the theory you&#39;ve presented here seems to use both the idea of the conventional comic-esque multiverse (big different worlds) as well as the Trousers of Time (&quot;for want of a nail&quot; types of changes). It explains a great deal but still leaves room for possible expansion. It&#39;s definitely not the neatest implementation of alternate universes, but let&#39;s face it: as soon as the concept of alternate universes comes up, things are going to get messy regardless. <br><br>I&#39;d always seen the PPC as an entity existing in its own Word World/pocket dimension, but I think this is the first time I&#39;ve seen it really (sort of) confirmed. Does that mean that the in-universe concept of the PPC being threaded through other Word Worlds has been, like the theory of a geocentric earth, debunked? Or is there some other explanation? Or am I possibly misinterpreting that (which I suppose would be another explanation)?<br><br>I can&#39;t say I&#39;m too keen on the Void between Verses. I can&#39;t quite put my finger on what about it bothers me. I guess it seems oversimplified, like you (or the IC writer of this document) are trying to force our rather limited perception of matter and space onto a concept that is already doing some pretty crazy things with accepted science. But again, I&#39;not a physicist. <br><br>I have a few more points I&#39;d like to touch on, but as they pertain to some of the things that doctorlit brought up in his comments, I&#39;m going to redirect them to that portion of the thread.</p>

            <p>Part three of the essay series will deal more with the Trousers of Time. Again, it will be descriptive, not prescriptive - though, equally again, a fair amount of that will be from stuff I wrote in the first place. ;)<br><br>The nature of the PPC was (as presented here) a point of contention between the Two and Many Multiverse Theories. HQ <i>is</i> threaded into portions of canon worlds; that&#39;s indisputable, because the people who did the threading (such as the Weeds) are still around to confirm it. <i>But</i>, the whole complex is linked and covered under a HITeG Manifold (which will be further described in Part Two). Essentially, that means that HQ is &#39;inside&#39; other worlds in the same way that the inside of the TARDIS is &#39;inside&#39; a police box. There&#39;s definitely some connection - but it&#39;s not <i>wrong</i> to describe it as a separate dimension, either.<br><br>As for the Void: that&#39;s another established fact. The name comes from IAHF2, which is where it&#39;s described as a canyon.  <a href="http://genericsurface.livejournal.com/24681.html">Lou</a> sees it as a desktop on which comics are being made (though I&#39;ll not that she&#39;s travelling between parallel PPCs in the same multiverse). The idea that different people perceive it different was meant to demonstrate that, well, &#39;[the theorists] are trying to force our rather limited perception of matter and space onto a concept that is already doing some pretty crazy things with accepted science&#39;.<br><br>And remember: this is all <i>theory</i>. It&#39;s someone in the PPC trying to come up with a model that fits all the known facts, and doesn&#39;t exclude any of them. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right, and even if it is, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s complete. (Also, there&#39;s the perpetually-unmentioned deeper theoretical basis...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The comparison between the PPC and the TARDIS helped. I can wrap my head around that. And yes, I know the Void is established fact. I read the links provided. It just...

            <p>1/ This is an in-universe text on Multiverse Theory, by a member of the PPC. Obviously, they&#39;re going to claim they&#39;re the Prime version.<br><br>2/ Well... they <i>are</i> the Prime version. They&#39;re the version J&amp;A created, and the version we all write about. The Prime Multiverse canons are <i>our</i> canons - <i>Doctor Who</i> exists, while <i>Master Who</i> and <i><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1P35_LYSACPKuTCfSfKU3ewXi31kDpfpZJnQ8TQiVvUo">The Unnamed Academian</a></i> do not.<br><br>3/ &#39;Prime&#39; is just a name, as much as &#39;Mirror&#39;, &#39;Steampunk&#39;, and &#39;Ship&#39;.

Since they exist in the same multiverse, they&#39;re not actually spinoffs - they&#39;re alternate timelines. They&#39;re created by... well, this will be detailed massively in the third part of <i>Time and Motion Study</i>, but the essence of it is that there are two forms of time travel in HQ. One just takes you back in time; the other creates an alternate timeline. The Prime timeline is the one which hasn&#39;t had any of the second kind of time traveller intervention.<br><br>Which actually means that the &#39;Prime&#39; PPC is <i>not</i> the base timeline, since the &#39;Door to the Future&#39; RP altered it. The base timeline, until something crops up further back, is still technically the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/SunderingRest.htm">Sundering</a>. But the <i>Prime</i> timeline is the one we write in - the one that&#39;s now been altered once.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been imagining the physical aspect of things very similarly to some of your graphs, particularly the fanfic &quot;worlds&quot; being bubbles attached to the main worlds.  I don&#39;t see them as separate worlds, but rather as a more direct attachment to the original world, directly affecting the real contents.  (I know the argument has been made in the past that the fics happen separately from the main fic, mostly to explain why three thousand Sues and five hundred agents aren&#39;t all crowding around the Council of Elrond at once; personally, I think this is avoided by a fail-safe on the <i>Sues&#39;</i> end.  The last thing the average most-special person wants is another most-special person getting all up in their glitter.)  When agents do the typical mission thing, what they&#39;re doing in the end is popping that added bubble and making it take all the bad stuff away from the actual world as it disappears.<br><br>I also agree with the final Multiple Multiverse Theory, in the sense that there are simply lots and lots of different versions of the same stuff floating around out there.  I&#39;ll get into that a bit more later.<br><br>The one place where my personal views contradict what you&#39;re presented here (which I know doesn&#39;t really count for anything) is the idea that the &quot;Word Worlds&quot; are created from World One.  I believe that all worlds exist, and have always existed since they were Created, independent of one another.  The reason that some worlds have stories about the events of other worlds is because, despite the separation between our homes, everyone everywhere is still basically a &quot;person&quot; at heart; most of us are far more similar than we are different, regardless of whether we&#39;re human or Vulcan or centaur, or whatever.  This allows &quot;authors&quot; (including writers, producers, actors, game designers, whatever) to catch tidbits of information through little connections with the people of other worlds.  You can see similarities between authors and parts of their stories everywhere: J.K. Rowling said Hermione is similar to herself as a young girl; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was personally acquainted with Dr. Joseph Bell, who is very similar to Sherlock Holmes; many PPC authors in our world write about an agent who is extremely similar to them.<br><br>And yes, that&#39;s another part of my belief in the system: the version of Earth that we live on is not deserving of the title &quot;real world,&quot; not because it isn&#39;t real, but because every world is equally real.  We&#39;ve already seen missions involving the real world <i>written in</i> the real world (and my Sherlock Holmes mission, where the &quot;Sue&quot; turned out to be a fan author from the modern period of Holmes&#39;s world).  Even though we, as a community, no longer write real person missions, I&#39;m sure the actual PPC still does them, as they have no reason from their perspective to treat it any differently than any other world.  Additionally, this means that other worlds have stories written about ours, which seem as fictional to them as theirs do to us.<br><br>Anyway . . . this probably doesn&#39;t help you at all.  Sorry.  I just wanted to share my feelings on the topic.<br><br><i>Yes, this is what doctorlit actually believes about reality.  Please don&#39;t judge him too harshly for it, as he gets bored VERY easily.</i><br><br>P.S. What was that Protectors of the Plot Discontinuum?  I don&#39;t remember hearing about that anywhere else.</p>

            <p>Last questions first: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/770943/1/Protectors_Of_The_Plot_Discontinuum">the Protectors of the Plot Discontinuum</a>.<br><br>First questions second: the diagrammed version of fanfic-Word World relations is a bit simplified. I&#39;ve added an explanation section and diagram to the doc, with the writing running as follows:<br><br><i>This is in actuality somewhat oversimplified. The effect is not limited to some vague ‘destabilising’; it’s more akin to fanfic creating a puppet with a loose connection to the original. While one such puppet being jerked around won’t change the canon much, many of them being pulled in the same direction will drag the canon around after them.<br><br>And, curiously, this effect is not limited to the Word Worlds. The Department of RPF have long known that ‘real’ world people can be affected by badfic; indeed, every ‘girl falls into Canon X’ story can be deemed to affect the author who bases the ‘girl’ on herself - this explains the strong emotional reactions they often have to their character being maligned. In fact, there is a strong argument to be made for Word Worlds simply being parasites writ large - think of the alterations to New Zealand following the release of the Lord of the Rings films. One could claim them to be simply a sensible business decision to attract tourists - but one could also claim that the increased mischievousness of twins across the multiverse is simply whimsy. That there is a ‘reasonable’ explanation does not exclude the base cause being fanfiction.</i><br><br>The only alternate explanation which really fits the evidence is the Suedom model, wherein the canon simply loops endlessly, and different badfics happen on different iterations. I&#39;m avoiding that because a) #Idon&#39;tlikeit, b) it seems fairly brutal on the canons, and c) it requires a lot of pinpoint time travel. ;)<br><br>As to the idea of all the worlds being equally extant... well, part of that (RPF) has been mentioned in the above expansion, and actually expanded a little. But your main thesis... doesn&#39;t work in the context of the PPC. J.R.R. Tolkien can power HQ by spinning in his grave because it&#39;s his creation that&#39;s being mauled. And, well, in all the PPC missions, we&#39;ve not only never seen, but never seen <i>mentioned</i>, a mission into a story written anywhere other than World One. It just... hasn&#39;t happened. Which, to a physicist, strongly suggests it <i>can&#39;t</i> happen.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the fact that a qualitative difference between Word and Atomic worlds is a firm part of <i><a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/OriginsTitle.htm">Origins</a></i>, to the point where Reality Rooms work because Mary-Sues - from Word Worlds - can&#39;t survive in Atomic worlds, because their plotholes stop operating.<br><br>So no: in the PPC universe, the creative process is definitely one-way. New creations can change the canon - this is clear from the way Legolas is now blond, and was shown in HFA when a new book came out (I forget which): new characters appeared in the canon. (Though of course HFA is a fanfic itself, gold rather than red)<br><br>And on a personal note: your theory removes all creative power from authors. As someone who likes to think of himself as rather creative, I find that to be a fairly big flaw in the argument. ;)<br><br>That said, the distinction between Atomic and Word Worlds isn&#39;t as ironcast as the writer makes it sound. The example of RPF, and Word World parasitism, shows they are of fundamentally the same kind - and plotholes from the Cascade, which ought to only appear in Word Worlds, showed up around Origin...<br><br>... all right, I&#39;ll spill. From an out-of-universe perspective, written worlds fall into (at least) three categories:<br><br><b>Cat. 3: Fanfic.</b> These are the stories where Agents can read the Words. They&#39;re total parasites, with no stable existence - once the author insert (of whatever kind) is killed, the dimension dies.<br><br><b>Cat. 2: Word World.</b> The original canon. Here Agents probably can&#39;t read the Words (I don&#39;t recall seeing it, anyway), but Flowers still detect them. While still somewhat parasitic, they&#39;re pretty stable; a PPC agent couldn&#39;t do something to kill a canon dimension.<br><br><b>Cat. 1: World One.</b> The &#39;real world&#39; of the PPC Multiverse. Neither Flowers nor agents can detect that it&#39;s made of words - but, er, it is, because we&#39;re the ones writing them. ;) Origin falls into this category - I mean, come on, it has <i>natural plotholes</i>. Even if you can&#39;t actually sense Words, that&#39;s a big hint that they&#39;re there.<br><br><b>Cat. 0: The Real World.</b> Our world - our <i>actual</i> world, not the fictionalised one where there&#39;s a PPC city in New Cal. As far as we know, this isn&#39;t a Word World at all. (;^-^) Nor has any PPC character ever set foot in it - because there&#39;s no such thing as portals from fiction into Actual Reality. Again, that we know of... and if there <i>was</i>, you couldn&#39;t read about anything that happens on this side of it, because this side has no Words, and no narrator...<br><br>hS will stop here because words</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a bit of two minds about this. I recognize that for the sake of practicality all the fanfiction our agents spork has to come from World One. Then there&#39;s the spinning authors* and Reality Rooms and whatnot.<br><br>On the other hand, I don&#39;t really like how it makes the PPC World-One-centric. Having World One be the source of all creative energy and change makes the Word Worlds, in my mind, be less important. Plus, think of it from an in-universe perspective:<br><b>World One Agent:</b> So you&#39;re my new partner, huh? Cool! Where&#39;re you from?<br><b>Word World Agent:</b> Pittsburgh, in... uh, what did that Flower call it? The Marvelverse?<br><b>WOA:</b> Neat! Where I come from, the Marvelverse is just a comic series.<br><b>WWA:</b> Just a... what?<br><b>WOA:</b> Yep! World One! All these other universes we&#39;re going to? On my world, they&#39;re just stories!<br><b>WWA:</b> ...<br>I don&#39;t know about you, but if I were an agent from a World Word I&#39;d kinda annoyed with all these World One jackasses who say that my family and friends, my home, and my entire universe were just made up by some random person to entertain the masses.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how to reconcile those two points. I suppose the rules of the fictional universe can only be taken so far in the PPC before it runs headlong into the realities that we the authors have to deal with.<br><br>Eh. Maybe it&#39;s just the name I don&#39;t like.<br><br>*I must admit, I&#39;m not really a fan of the &quot;dead spinning authors generate power for the PPC&quot; thing. It strikes me as being both a bit weird and slightly disrespectful. But that&#39;s beside the point.</p>

            <p>Considering that &quot;there is no outside of Headquarters&quot; according to a &quot;things I&#39;m not allowed to do&quot; list, I imagine that agents from World One eventually begin to doubt that they aren&#39;t from a word world.  Especially if people from various &quot;real&quot; word worlds start referencing a popular fiction that doesn&#39;t exist in World One.<br><br>I have an agent from a theoretical Ghostbusters fanfic.  She&#39;s from a &quot;real&quot; world that had a sudden spike in supernatural problems and a giant marshmallow monster in New York rather than a film about it happening.  (They also didn&#39;t have the tv series with a model T and a guy in a gorilla costume.)<br><br>I have an agent who has no clue about how his word world differs from World One.  (Muggle in an American Harry Potter ripoff.)<br><br>The other two probably come from a &quot;real&quot; world that is separate unless World One has room for non-PPC creatures and machines that deposit people into media.<br></p>

            <p>I mean, <i>Star Trek</i> includes Earth, but people from there would have a hard time claiming it was &#39;the real world&#39;.<br><br>There&#39;s a reason I coined the term World One: while you can slap the word &#39;real&#39; on any world you like, World One is a specific designation. It means the world where the PPC city in New Caledonia is situated, and which the majority of agents who claim to come from &#39;the real world&#39; originated. But to people like the Weeds, who spend their time moving around worlds (rather than just fanfics like most agents), it&#39;s known by its number.<br><br>The number actually originates in the designations of the doors of HQ (on which, given the whole &#39;there is no outside, sort of&#39;, more will be said later); door 1-Cym-3, to pick the random example, is World One-Cymru (Wales)-third door. So there are at least three doors in Wales in World One. (The image on the &#39;1-Cym-3&#39; wiki article also designates World One as &#39;Primary Earth&#39;)<br><br>Other worlds, Earth or otherwise, are also numbered, and most also have a long Continuum Identification Code. My theory is that the Weeds invented the numbering system while they were out exploring, completely separate to the CIC system that was developing back in HQ.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I had read both &quot;Gallifrey Stands&quot; and the bit during the Blackout it covered, but had forgotten about them. I can&#39;t see everyone from a canonical world taking it so easily (particularly not at first) and my own head-canon regarding reality and fictionality is always going to be at least a little different, but I concede the point.<br><br>Although I will say, as an historian, that <i>can</i> happen in non-fictional realms. Not so dramatically as a massive universal retcon, but history can be altered in the minds of the people. Bias, mythologizing, and outright lies can create new &quot;facts&quot; capable of supplanting the old.</p>

            <p>As I said right at the start, this is both descriptive and in-universe. It&#39;s possibly!Morgan&#39;s view of things - not a Fundamental Truth. (Also, it really doesn&#39;t matter to Multiverse Theory whether World One creates Word Worlds or they&#39;re both ACEd with each other - the diagram looks the same either way, and the theory is mostly involved with <i>multiple</i> multiverses, not the intricacies of one)<br><br>You have a fair point about history - which always simply comes down to what&#39;s reported and how. But it doesn&#39;t generally result in someone suddenly acquiring a whole new set of memories. (Though, that said, editing our own memories to fit...

            <p>I mean, yeah, if someone took the actual coffin of the actual J.R.R. Tolkien and hooked it up to a generator, that would be pretty horrifying.

It runs more on narrative laws than physical ones, so goofy figurative expressions we would normally never blink at take on a surprising life—and that element of surprise is what (theoretically) makes it <i>funny</i>.

            <p>I take your point that trying to explain something fundamentally inexplicable can make people forget it&#39;s supposed to be funny - but quite frankly, I&#39;m having <i>heaps</i> of fun doing this!<br><br>And... well, leaving the PPC as a mass of unrelated puns is (was) certainly one possible way to develop it - but I subscribe to the idea that figuring out the &#39;rules&#39; actually makes for more jokes down the way. If I hadn&#39;t decreed that HQ ran on dead authors spinning in their graves, we could never have had CAL-9000 - or the &#39;power&#39;-obsessed Slaver Sunflower - or the idea that both of those are fed up to the respective idiom with people coming in to pay their respects to the generators. (Or, indeed, a certain agent named Tequila Sunrise)<br><br>The Department of Redundancy Department was a hilarious one-line joke - but turning it into an actual department, with rules and desks and &#39;logic&#39;, gave us Rosalind and Haar. <i>I&#39;m</i> quite fond of them.<br><br>And so it goes on. The TCDA could join in the Blackout because someone (...me) had fleshed them out enough that they were an actual organisation, not just &#39;hey the PPC could be steampunk&#39;. FicPsych is immensely funnier now that it goes far beyond &#39;we bring Legolas in because Sues make him crazy&#39;. The question of &#39;how does HQ handle security?&#39; led to the humorous UST (er... Unresolved Pollination Tension?) between the Tiger Lily and Captain Dandy.<br><br>Ultimately, my view is that the more things you stake out a basic ground-rules background for, the more you can play with that background. Without the idea that there&#39;s a &#39;Void between Verses&#39;, Lou could never have wandered past a <i>Star Wars</i> comic set.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>On the one hand, while explaining the real world doesn&#39;t make it less real, explaining the joke tends to make it less joke-y. But on the other hand, the joke is only funny the first couple of times you hear it anyway; once you start taking it for granted that agents have to distract themselves to get from place to place, it&#39;s not a joke anymore, it just is. Like when watching a whole lot of Monty Python or reading a whole lot of <i>Discworld</i> books in a row, you start to see the pattern, the element of surprise is lost, and you gradually laugh less.<br><br>The trick is finding new jokes, or new ways to play on the old ones. If explaining things lets that happen, it&#39;s good. But if making the DoDAEG a place that agents can get to, rather than some kind of metaphysical quantum entanglement thingy, leads one to wonder what the characters who live in a universe where this is actually happening think about it, which leads one to wonder what we would think if it were real, which leads nowhere good... yeah.<br><br>The problem(?), I think, is getting good character-writing to exist harmoniously with wacky literalisms. If our characters are expected to behave like real people, they&#39;re not going to take to these things well—but they have to, or it stops being fun, and everything turns into a grimdark psychological horrorfest. And I&#39;m guilty of these tendencies myself: I&#39;m currently trying to balance the need to get on with a mission against the needs of real people to eat food; and how can you possibly be a good pet owner if you have to leave them in an RC for an undefined period of time, anyway? You could be gone for days, even weeks! It doesn&#39;t work!<br><br>... Unless you just stop thinking about it and hit your characters with an SEP effect or something so they can stop thinking about it, too. Which feels pretty cheap, but hey, if I don&#39;t draw attention to it, who&#39;s gonna notice, right? (Oh wait, I just drew attention to it. Damn!)<br><br>I dunno, I&#39;m just rambling at this point. But I think what I&#39;m trying to say is that I, and PoorCynic, and probably plenty of other people, are a lot better off leaving the jokes as jokes and not asking ourselves or our characters to confront DoDAEG or the DRD/RDR in the flesh, so to speak.<br><br>Or the actual nature of the multiverse. My personal in-universe theory on that has always been that it&#39;s all real, but whether or not it&#39;s also fictional depends entirely on where you&#39;re sitting. And Jenni dares anyone to ask her if she cares one whit whether anyone sees her as fictional from their perspective. Go on, tell her it&#39;s a paradox for her to exist both as an independent being <i>and</i> as a figment of my imagination <i>at the same time</i>. See if she cares. She dares you. ^_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>An elf, a man, and a dwarf walk into a bar...<br><br>You&#39;re dead right that repeating the same joke makes it boring, or at least predictable. Sometimes the memory of the original makes you laugh anyway (&quot;This... is an <i>EX-PARROT!</i>&quot;), but sometimes you just gloss over and move on.<br><br>So do you go off in search of new, unrelated jokes - or do you try to delve deeper into the ones you&#39;ve already got? You talk about Jenni later - she&#39;s one obvious &#39;joke&#39;, but you didn&#39;t just send her on her way after using it a few times. You&#39;ve explored it (or let her do so), finding new ways to make her a part of the humour. That&#39;s what I try to do when I set to work expanding things - find or create new inlets for jokes. (Among other things, having a Multiverse Theory lets someone be really distraught when they find out it&#39;s wrong...)<br><br>I&#39;m dubious about your assertion that, to continue the example, everyone would be horrified at the concept of the DoDAEG. Why? They&#39;re not actually digging up the authors - they&#39;re still in their graves. I&#39;m not even certain the connection is physical. And the fact that they&#39;re spinning in the first place is the fault of the Suvians, not the PPC. All we&#39;re doing is using the effects of badfic to <i>fight</i> badfic - with the specific assistance of the creators of the canon.<br><br>And, of course, in the Real World we burn dead dinosaurs and very-recently-dead trees to achieve the same ends... where&#39;s the moral high ground, again?<br><br>I mean, yes, PPC agents aren&#39;t psychologically normal - they take unpaid jobs going up against armed opponents while working for the world&#39;s scariest garden - but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason for them to all break down into tears of despair. The PPC is <i>weird</i>, but past the unpaid-risk-of-death part, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much <i>horrifying</i>. We kicked the Great Unclean One out, remember.<br><br>(As for food, sleep, weekends, hobbies, and pets - yeah, those get glossed over, it&#39;s true. But most pets are minis, and they&#39;re pretty sentient... maybe they just have stacks of smoked bacon in the RC? Anyway, most of those things are glossed over in the vast majority of fiction as it is. Most fictional characters have magical digestive systems, I figure)<br><br>As for Jenni... Lou says hi. ^-^ <i>She&#39;d</i> like to know if anyone&#39;s got a theory for how she managed to live in my head, specifically request being in a PPC story, and then exist solidly inside that story while still being also in my head, and also in several alternate PPCs at the same time, as different versions but all with direct access to me... maybe ACE again?<br><br>hS<br><br>(Ouch - it was a mithril bar)</p>

            <p>I just see creativity as a different process than is typically understood.  I know this is becoming a cliched thing to say, but when I write, I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m causing anything to happen.  Instead, I&#39;m just recording things that happened--I can&#39;t explain how I know they happened, but I do know.  (Simplest explanation: Agent Doc seems to be a version of me from another Earth, so I&#39;m in tune with his mind and what happens to him.  Then again, Vania is more and more becoming the real main character of my spin-off, so, eh.)<br><br>In point of fact, during a very restless night&#39;s sleep that I just woke up from half an hour ago, I flat-out dreamed a new interlude that I&#39;ll need to write down the line.  Since dreams are not conscious thought, how did I &quot;make&quot; those scenes up?  Far from devaluing creativity, I&#39;m suggesting that writers/creators of any story have such a strong imagination that they are able to see beyond the mundane reality of their world (for given values of mundane in some worlds) and see things far outside their immediate experience and familiarity.  To use a Middle-earth analogy, the author&#39;s mind is traveling past the curve of their own world and heading &quot;east&quot; to another level of existence.<br><br>As to the Department of Dead Author Electricity Generation: Professor Tolkien would have a strong connection to Middle-earth regardless of whether or not it came out of his head or he mentally discovered it.  Heck, perhaps there are a handful of different versions of each other in DoDAEG, from different versions of Earth.<br><br>But again, this has just been my feelings on the subject; I never expected anyone else to agree to it, or to suddenly subscribe to the Church of Fiction Doesn&#39;t Exist.</p>
