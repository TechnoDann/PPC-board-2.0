            <p>A fight like this, without any context, just isn&#39;t that interesting to speculate about.  For a start, what are their motivations for fighting?  That&#39;ll make a difference to their tactics.

            <p>It was also - at least the rest of the post was - a good question. A fist-fight between Superman and Batman has only one possible outcome - yet Batman keeps winning their confrontations precisely because he <i>avoids</i> the fist-fight.<br><br>So what context is there that would affect this fight? Well - does He-Man have access to his sword? That seems like a pretty big one. Are there any environments which would favour one or the other?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Is there a trend in shipping fanfiction that drives you insane? Need to vent about it? Well here&#39;s your chance! Moving on, I hate it when people turn a formally good charcter into a horrible jerk just to get there ship together. Like in canon, Orihime is a sweet girl, take her into fanfiction she becomes a horrible bitch just so Ichigo can get together with Rukia.</p>

            <p>WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS MENTION OF POTENTIALLY NSFW SUBJECTS. READERS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH FRANK MENTIONS OF HUMAN SEXUALITY SHOULD PROBABLY NOT READ THIS POST.<br><br>I&#39;m going to buck what seems like the prevailing trend in this thread and say I like a good bit of well-written shipping (&#39;well-written&#39; obviously being the operative phrase there). I think a large part of my like stems from my fascination with characters and character interaction. Writing relationships, whether platonic or romantic or something less easily definable, provides the opportunity to have certain types of character interaction that one might not otherwise see.<br><br>That being said, I like character interactions that fit the character. OOCness is not something I&#39;m particularly fond of. I want relationships to make sense, to have some measure of justification.<br><br>Also, unless the fanfic is supposed to be a screwball-esque comedy, I don&#39;t want to see any romantic-comedy cliches. The &#39;misunderstanding that leads to a temporary breakup followed by a realization of love&#39; is the chief offender in my books. It&#39;s just too well known to be played straight anymore.<br><br>THE FOLLOWING SECTION IS THE POTENTIALLY NSFW PART. THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING.<br><br>I don&#39;t mind if the shipfic in question has a sex scene -- again, provided it&#39;s well-written. But that&#39;s the tricky thing, isn&#39;t it? Good sex scenes are tricky to write. You&#39;re walking that tightrope between unreadable purple-osity and &#39;insert tab A into slot B&#39;.<br><br>Too often (based on what I&#39;ve seen while writing for the DBS) fanfic authors seem to base their sex scenes on porn dynamics. Real people typically don&#39;t have sex like that. Real people use foreplay and lube and (depending on the situation) protection. Kinks are not just sprung on people without forewarning. BDSM has safe words. Orgasms are neither simultaneous nor produce multiple liters of liquid from the involved parties. And said liquids do not taste like candy or wine. A good sex scene requires at least a little bit of research, &#39;first hand&#39; or otherwise, by the writer.<br><br>My final sex scene bugbear (and it&#39;s a rather sizable one) is regarding the glorification of the &#39;first time.&#39; I roll my eyes whenever I read another piece of fanfiction that has a virgin know exactly what to do in regards to bedroom matters without any sort of instruction from books or websites or their partner. Like magic, they hit exactly the right spots. There&#39;s no physical fumbling, no prematurity, no questions about if they&#39;re doing it right. Everything&#39;s perfect.<br><br>Much like any other piece of fanfiction, shipfics can be fantastic if they&#39;re written solidly. But when they flop, MAN do they flop.</p>

            <p>Certain words and phrases aggravate me to no end when I see them in a sex scene. The entire rest of the fic can be well-written and even the rest of that scene and I see a woman&#39;s lady bits referred to as &#39;her sex&#39; and I&#39;m rolling my eyes and leaving the fic. Most of the cheap romance novel style alternative names for a penis have the same effect. Also, porno style dialogue during sex. Usually it&#39;s eye-rollingly bad, or seriously too articulate for the point they are at in the encounter. Maybe if it is the kink of one of the characters to listen to dirty talk during, well realistically, probably mostly during the foreplay, but if it&#39;s their first time, they shouldn&#39;t know that. A lot of people would be rather upset by hearing dirty talk, especially the kind that involves certain words, so characters who don&#39;t know each other very well, and certainly haven&#39;t had extensive discussions concerning each other&#39;s kinks probably aren&#39;t going to bring it up the first time. <br><br>Although that could make for a good scene. Two characters get to the bedroom. They&#39;ve gotten naked, and one of them starts in on the porno quality dialogue, and the other one just looks at them and laughs. I&#39;d like to see that sometime, but then I read shipfics for the relationship more than the porn. (There is always PWP if you are just looking for porn)<br><br>Another one that I see over and over and over is the whole &#39;kiss swollen lips&#39; thing. Seriously. If your lips are noticeably swelling after kissing--you&#39;re probably doing something wrong. Apparently there is some biological basis for this, that can be measured in I don&#39;t know, maybe micrometers? I&#39;d be more likely to believe that they end up with chapped lips the next day from the saliva. Maybe it is reasonable to say that their entire face was flushed, and therefore their lips are redder than usual, (but I think only a very pale Caucasian character would even have that effect. I am extremely, eye-blindingly, is that a snowman?, pale and I&#39;ve looked in the mirror and...nothing. I&#39;ve asked a friend who has a much broader than average level of experience--she&#39;s never seen anyone&#39;s lips swell and turn red after kissing or any other activity.) I see this in a fic and I automatically think, &quot;This is an extremely real life inexperienced author who is simply repeating the acts they&#39;ve read in other fics with no real reference.&quot; I read one fic that had a character portrayed as asexual and the character thinks about this trope and it&#39;s just kind of a weird thought to him. I&#39;m not asexual, but I feel the same way about this particular trope.<br><br>Another thing is characters that have been working in hot, sweaty conditions all day, then they strip and get to sexy times (including oral sex) with no shower and no mention whatever of the natural consequences of being hot and sweaty and 24 hours or more since their last shower. (And I&#39;m reading it thinking, ewwww)<br><br>On the first time being perfect, even characters who are experienced, if it&#39;s their first time together, it shouldn&#39;t be perfect. I read one the other day that was a great fic. The characters fell over, got tangled up in their clothing, ended up laughing over each other&#39;s clumsiness, and there was other general fumbling. It was all very real. A nice change of pace on all those where everything is porno perfect.<br><br>Actually, sex between average characters should probably never be porno perfect. If the fic is supposed to be about characters older than 30-35 (and the characters on a lot of live action TV shows and movies are), especially if they have been together for a few years...they are over the initial rush of each other and past the extreme hormones of youth. There should be shorthand where they know the other is actually too tired, but hey it&#39;s sex, so they&#39;ll give it a try (and if they do go ahead with it, it&#39;s really more &#39;meh&#39; than anything). Where they don&#39;t do it every night, and they are too old to do it multiple times in one night. It doesn&#39;t last all night (and if they are really being honest with each other, there was probably only that one time where they even did the whole &#39;sex all night, and 8 orgasms&#39; thing as 20 year old kids). They probably have a whole repertoire of things they do that aren&#39;t vaginal/anal intercourse (when they&#39;re tired, when they aren&#39;t really in the mood, when they want to get off, but don&#39;t want to put in all the effort). Really, everyone wants to believe that all sex they have will be mind-blowing, but it&#39;d be nice to see fics with established couples admit that it isn&#39;t. And especially with slash, it would be nice to see new couples that don&#39;t go directly to anal. I&#39;m sure some couples do that, but there is a lot of range that could (and probably should) realistically be in there first.</p>

            <p>That fantasies were allowed to be fantastical?<br><br>Seriously, most people are writing NSFW shipfics for the sake of getting off watching two characters bang. This is okay. Whining about how sex between two or more characters is unrealistic when half the time at least one partner in proceedings is a character from a species that doesn&#39;t frelling exist in our reality is perhaps missing the point a bit. And by &#39;a bit&#39; I mean several Astronomical Units.

I&#39;m really glad that you can find fics that detail mediocre sexual encounters between disinterested people, because you&#39;re getting what you want, but please, <i>please</i> don&#39;t tell me I should want it too.<br><br>I personally don&#39;t write that sort of fic because I&#39;d be more interested in attempting major heart surgery on myself with a couple of rusty spoons, but also because it feels like a disservice to the characters I&#39;m shipping.

I don&#39;t want to get bogged down in talking about their morning breath or the fact that they&#39;re only having sex to pass the time until Countdown starts or whatever because that&#39;s not what interests me about their sex lives.

            <p>Underage Shipping. It&#39;s wrong and yet some authors seem to love it. Especially when they try and make up a reason for it to be OK (like moving the age of majority around). There was a Harry Potter fic I read once (I keep meaning to find it, it could be fun to spork) where Harry Potter aged 11 was being shipped with multiple girls, the oldest of whom was round the 30-40 mark. The &#39;reason&#39; why this was OK? &quot;Wizards reach their majority at 11&quot; I believe was how it was worded. <br><br>My other pet peeve with shipping is when one characters age is raised or lowered for the pure and only reason so as they can be of similar age to the other person they&#39;re being shipped with. I can understand if it&#39;s being done to take out the Under-Age bit, and I quite like it if it&#39;s done with more of an affect on the story, but purely for the reason of &quot;oh A is five years older than in canon so that I can ship A with B&quot; just annoys me. </p>

            <p>My general motto is to ship the teenagers with other teenagers, and ship the adults with actual adults. Especially if your thing is set after canon: if it&#39;s after canon, you can set it five years after canon so that characters can pass their age of majority and gain some badly needed life experience on the way. Maybe then if you can write well I&#39;ll believe that they could make a relationship with a somewhat older character will work.<br><br>... This is also one of the tropes that makes me really wary of fics that are high school AU&#39;s, especially when an attractive character is made the teacher.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6164844/1/Always-in-Repair"><i>Always in Repair</i></a> a Final Fantasy XIII goodfic that I&#39;ve read not too long ago. Written before XIII-2 came out, it ships Hope and Lightning in a plausible way. Even though their ages are seven years apart in canon and Hope is underage (14, as opposed to Lightning&#39;s 21), the author manages to fix the issue plausibly (in-fic, Lightning emerges from crystal stasis when Hope is 19) and develops the relationship very realistically. If you are at all interested in FFXII fic, I&#39;d highly suggest this one.</p>

            <p>I mean I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time in fandom on tumblr and half of the time, you&#39;d think that it&#39;s the only thing that matters to these people. Never mind if the series in question is about the harsh realities of war and the moral ambiguities of said war--all that matters is TEH ROMANCE!!1! <br><br>And while I also understand that romance is an integral part of who we are as human beings, that doesn&#39;t mean its a label you slap around lightly on two characters you think just HAVE to go together. For me it takes ages to decide if I &quot;ship&quot; a pairing or not. If the Canon or the fans or (preferably) both can provide me with enough context or insight to piece together a working,(ideally healthy and equal)dynamic, then I&#39;m on board. <br><br>But if there&#39;s this mindset of &quot;OMG THEY LOOKED AT EACH-OTHER I SHIP IT!!&quot; going on, then shippers--you&#39;re doing it wrong. </p>

I do think it is an integral part of a good portion of human society (I wouldn&#39;t be alive if my mom hadn&#39;t fallen for<br>my dad I can say that much) but well--as an individual it&#39;s different for everyone.<br><br>I had no idea aromantic was a thing.

            <p>Yeah, I didn&#39;t know it was a thing until long after I discovered I was asexual (potential TMI: feels no desire to have sex with anyone, ever.

            <p>And yeah.

            <p>When dangerous and traumatic things happen, people tend to project the increase of neurotransmitters and other chemicals that had previously been used in conjunction with the aforementioned events onto something connected to those events, often another person. This can lead to short-term heavy attachments with the other person, often romantic or otherwise relationship-y in nature, due to simply that person&#39;s proximity to the initial danger, and their role in it as related to whoever it is that&#39;s projecting. Just because the heroes are making out now doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to have a long-term and successful relationship. They&#39;re just transferring arousal from all of the endorphins and adrenaline necessary to stop those alien invaders from crashing asteroids into the earth, and as a result have suddenly become extremely attracted to one another for about a week or so.<br><br>At least, that&#39;s poorly phrased real-world biopsychology applied to fictional or fictionalized events in a from-the-outside-looking-in perspective. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m aromantic, too, so  I wasn&#39;t exactly viewing this from the typical audience perspective.</p>

            <p>And I agree. People in long-term creative projects like films and stuff also have this happening to them. It&#39;s all that adrenaline, which is also a thing in arousal (elevated heartbeat, dilated pupils, yadda yadda). That, coupled with the fact that some people fall madly and quickly &quot;in love&quot; because of extended proximity with others, they then create things like &quot;showmances&quot; with them which honestly don&#39;t last long after the project/event is over.<br><br>This is why actor marriages often fail so easily. They meet and marry their costar for a film and after all that adrenaline from the filmmaking process is over, they realise there&#39;s nothing else for them.<br><br>For me, I can remain attracted to someone if I maintain my emotional connection with them, so... I tend to start up long-distance relationships where I get the emotional stuff without the pressure to be physically close.</p>

            <p>Allow me to use the donut analogy. Asexual people, when they see donuts, may not necessarily have the urge to eat it. Sexual people tend to like eating donuts, though some may prefer certain types (homosexual, heterosexual), others aren&#39;t very picky (pansexual), and others only eat two specific types (bisexual). <br><br>Demisexual people will only eat a donut if it is their utmost favourite donut in the world.</p>

            <p>Incest is pretty creepy. And extremely out of character for most sibling pairs.<br><br>But there are some exceptions. Luke/Leia? Could work. They grew up apart. Their immediate disgust on learning about their blood relationship told us they weren&#39;t going to try it, but an AU where they got farther than a kiss before they learned about it? Plausible. Vaguely disturbing, but plausible.<br><br>Then there are stepsiblings whose families combined after they were at least pre-teens--too old to think, &quot;Ew, that&#39;s my brother/sister!&quot; On a darker note, some characters have simply had a messy enough background that incest makes sense (and besides, they&#39;ve experienced or done much worse). Not that this would be a romantic story... more like desperate and a bit offputting. But it can and does happen. Without a power difference between the siblings (physically or psychologically), it may not even be abusive.<br><br>Some historical families didn&#39;t have quite so strong an incest taboo, though they did have to work around the &quot;ew, that&#39;s my sibling&quot; reaction, usually because siblings grew up apart (royalty, anyone?). Once you get to first cousins, it&#39;s pretty much a toss-up over whether a romance is possible, and in some cultures is even recommended.<br><br>And once you get to sci-fi aliens, fantasy races, robots, intelligent shades of blue... well! &quot;Incest&quot; may lose its meaning for someone who is built not born, or who has sixteen thousand siblings, or who reproduces by growing babies in the gigantic seed pods of a specially engineered plant.<br><br>For most characters, incest is out of character and highly improbable. But there are exceptions.</p>

            <p>After all, anything can be done good, if you have thought it through and have the talent to pull it off.<br><br>I agree that all the examples you mention makes for plausible backgrounds for incest stories. (Even Tolkien used the &#39;siblings meeting without knowing who they are&#39;-plot and it made for a great tragedy.)<br>I suppose I forgot to mention them, because it&#39;s not really the kind of stories I come across, when hunting for badfics.<br><br>When I wrote &#39;I don&#39;t like incest fics&#39;* I was really just thinking of Wincest, Weasley-cest, the Holmes brothers and all the other pairings which are not covered by these exceptions and haven&#39;t been given any other kind of explanation or plausible character development as to why the characters would go against the incest taboo. Someone just saw two hot males (usually) and decided that they had to boink.<br>Sooooo many of those stories are just &#39;Sam and Dean have a rough childhood and decide to &quot;comfort&quot; each other&#39;.

It&#39;s so squicky and boring and the same time.<br><br><br>*Just to clarify some more: YKINMK and I don&#39;t have a problem with the idea that some people are turned on by (fictional) incest and want to read and write about it.

            <p>In fact, it may be easier to just say, I don&#39;t like shipping, and move on. However, I feel a need to let people know why I generally don&#39;t like any ship fic I come across, with the very rare exception here and there. So, let&#39;s go down my list of things that piss me off about most shipping fanfiction.<br><br><b>1. Lack of thought on sexual orientation of characters.</b> Now, this is more pertaining to slashfic rather then shipping in general, but it bears mentioning for either genre. When writing a ship, the most obvious question to answer is, &#39;what is the sexual orientation of my characters?&#39; This is a question that requires thought, contemplation, and a deep understanding of what it means to be straight, gay, bisexual, pansexual, omnisexual, or even asexual. This does not mean fall into stereotype, but actually understanding the differences in thought process between each group. Do shippers think about this? NOPE! Hawtness love times for everybody! This destroys any and all credibility your ship has if you don&#39;t think about this, at least somewhat.  While it&#39;s one thing to say that Tony Stark is pansexual, it is a whole nother issue to think Steve Rodgers is even willing to entertain the idea of sleeping with a man. Beyond the fact that he was raised in the 1940s, and probably taught that homosexuality was one of the greatest sins a man could commit, he is also a man who appreciates the company of a woman. While he would probably learn to get past his ingrained homophobia, it would take some vary extreme things to occur before he even thinks about another man in that way. Explore this, ship writers. If you don&#39;t, your ship is sunk before it can even leave the port.<br><br><b>2. Not all relationships have to be sexual.</b> Wait, what!? Two people can have strong feelings for each other without sex!? Impossible! If two people have a deep, close friendship, they cearly want the other in bed! There is no greater bond then the bond between the covers!<br><br>If you can&#39;t tell, I value deep friendships over romantic relationships any day. The platonic life bond is a powerful, powerful thing, amd should be honored and praised whenever it exists. However, you all know this. You read OFUM. You know how this works.<br><br><b>3. Draco Malfoy does not wear leather pants.</b> Closely related to the point made by OP, when one writes a ship between two known enemies, the author needs to think really, really hard about how this relationship is going to work. Generally, attempted murder between partners does not make for a very stable relationship. So when authors ignore these antagonistic interactions, and even make the aggressor much kinder and softer then in canon, you have a problem. Take Katara X Zuko for instance. While Zuko is a sympathetic character, especially after season 3, I doubt Katara sees it the same way. This guy burned her, her brother, her friend, her people, and is the son of the king of the nation that burned the entire world. He has a lot to get through before she would even consider him a friend, much less a mate. However, some shippers just do not care about that. After all, fire and water make steam...ing hot partners. *Earth bends rock into my own forehead*<br><br>So, that just some of my annoyances about shipping. Without extreme care and craft, shipping is a genre that I have no appreciation for. I have a rather low tolerance for romance without reason, and will be quick to point these problems out to a writer when I see it.<br><br>TLDR: Shipping sucks.<br><br></p>

            <p>A couple of personal pet peeves of mine are making ACD Sherlock Holmes a passionate, love struck, sex-crazed mockery of himself, and making a Stargate Atlantis Wraith want to have sex with humans. Firstly, they are hive creatures descended from insects with only a few queens, so the odds of them ever getting to mate are slim and following the insect model probably requires some kind of pheromones from the queen to trigger the desire to mate. And secondly having sex with humans is equal to bestiality. Humans are their <i>food</i>. The only Wraith who it might be realistic to say thought that way was Michael and he had been turned human at least once and ended up being a kind of hybrid between humans and Wraith (and the other Wraith kicked him out for being contaminated). A full Wraith has no business thinking that way.<br><br><b>A. I have to disagree a little with point 1. </b>Just because someone grew up in the 1930&#39;s does not mean they never encountered homosexuality. If they encountered it, they might have thought about it. (They might have gone with the ingrained homophobia of the times and been repulsed by it automatically, but they might not have.) Saying that Steve would never have thought about it or encountered it before is putting too much innocence on him.<br><br>My point is based on hearsay, my grandpa was in the Navy in the early 50&#39;s. There were apparently a lot of...encounters going on in the bathrooms in certain ports, and his opinion was that if they left him alone, he was going to leave them alone. He wasn&#39;t much younger than Steve Rogers, and was from a rural and more strictly religious region than New York City. If he could have that kind of opinion, why would Steve (and every other man from the era) automatically have to have a bad opinion of it? <br><br>I do agree that there should be an exploration of that in a good &#39;getting together&#39; type fic. Shippers need to think about the orientation of the characters, and where they came from. It needs to be addressed, but I don&#39;t think in Steve&#39;s case he&#39;d have to start out hostile to the idea. Maybe more likely to be hostile to the concept that it isn&#39;t a social taboo anymore.  <br><br><b>B.Not all fics have to be &#39;getting together&#39; fics.</b>  Some fics are just porn (and sometimes that&#39;s okay). Some fics are about an established relationship. Sometimes they are just short fluff fics about having breakfast in bed, or watching a movie, or washing the dishes together. They aren&#39;t life-shatteringly important, no, but sometimes it&#39;s just nice to see a couple get to have a day off, and bringing in exactly how they ended up together would mess that up.<br><br>Example: I am reading a series of fics about Phil Coulson and Clint Barton as retired old men--I don&#39;t need to know about the difficulties they faced overcoming homophobia as young men. The series is not about sex. It&#39;s about loving someone that has wrecked their body (if he survives to 65, is there any other outcome for Clint the way he lives?). It is a heart wrenchingly good series. Trying to shoehorn in an exploration of how they got together or why they are both gay in this story would take away from the story. <br><br><b>C. Sexually active people <i>do</i> think about sex quite a lot.</b> If a character is not in a situation that would make them be not interested (they&#39;re hurt, sick, hungry, in a life or death situation, but even in cases like this, even when they aren&#39;t physically up to sex, it doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t wishing they were), then it probably should cross their mind. Especially if they are seeing or thinking about someone that looks like a good potential mate. Even if they are married or in a committed relationship, sex tends to run through people&#39;s minds (obviously not through an asexual character&#39;s mind, or maybe not someone with a very low sex drive, but someone like, say Tony Stark, since he&#39;s already been brought up. Until the PTSD gets bad, he should be thinking about sex frequently). <br><br>Obviously, they shouldn&#39;t be acting on every passing thought. I think badfic tends to think that a character can&#39;t appreciate the view without wanting to get naked. Badfic also tends to ignore social taboos that a person would normally operate under. Whatever a person might fantasize about, they aren&#39;t likely to strip and start having public sex or to jump into bed with handful of near strangers, or even if they did have an orgy with friends, sex changes things between people. It&#39;s rarely ever &#39;just sex&#39; in the real world. Emotions get involved. Things change between people when the emotions get involved, and true multiple pairing relationships aren&#39;t that common in the real world because of that. That has to come up in the shipfic, too.<br><br><b>D. I&#39;ll be in the minority on this thread and admit that I do like reading shipfics.</b> I have to say that I didn&#39;t always like them, though. When I was reading/watching primarily canons that weren&#39;t rife with UST, where the characters actively hated each other, actively were involved with other people or had reasons they were&#39;t involved with anyone--I didn&#39;t like shipfics. I thought I just didn&#39;t like them period. Now I am in a couple of fandoms that have either a firmly established fanon ship (Phil Coulson/Clint Barton), or there is just a ton of UST in the canon (Haven between Audrey/Duke/Nathan). I have come to really enjoy shipfics in those canons, and it has kind of spread from those relationships to others.<br><br>I still have fandoms where I am just not very accepting. I&#39;ll never accept incest fics. Supernatural fans frankly tick me off with their obsession with having brothers have sex. I don&#39;t read shipfics in LotR pretty much at all--especially with elves. Their author stated it is biologically impossible for them, so word of god is that shipfics shouldn&#39;t exist for them. There are others. Some, I can be convinced, but it isn&#39;t automatic. The first slash I ever liked was in NCIS. It took 35,000 words to get to the point where it made sense for there to be a kiss.<br><br>When I first joined the PPC I thought there was no such thing as good slash, because all I had ever seen was Bad Slash--bad for a lot of the reasons you mentioned. I wouldn&#39;t even look at a fic that had a ship that wasn&#39;t present explicitly in canon, and I never considered that a character might be something other than straight in a case where it isn&#39;t specifically mentioned in canon. I&#39;ve expanded my thinking since then.<br><br><b>E. Pulling characters toward stereotypes to facilitate the ship.</b> This has been touched on in other posts, but I just wanted to put it out there explicitly. If you are dealing with two hyper masculine men who canonically are seen appreciating women, but canon has nothing to say about their appreciation or lack thereof of the same sex, then making one or both conform to the worst stereotypes about gay men being feminine, whiny, flamboyant, etc. is so far out of character as to break canon. I will read slash about those men, but the author has to convince me that these are the same men I see in canon. They have to come together believably as two very masculine, alpha males. It is entirely possible to write this and do a good job with it. It is more likely to be done badly, though.<br><br></p>

            <p>A. Fair enough, though I still stand that he would be more hostile to the idea then if he were raised in more modern times. Perhaps he would not be homophobic, but from what I see in his character, he would not think of a man in that way. He&#39;s practically the spitting image of what a good young man was supposed to be in those days. Not saying that that image was right, but if he is, he would not consider being gay himself. <br><br>If this is not obvious at this point, I am actively against Steve Rodgers slashfic, no matter how well written. I mean, feel free to write it, power to you, hope it goes well, but I will always see it as OOC. I am pleased that those who do decide to write Steve slash do have some historical support for it, though.<br><br>B. True, true, but they do make a large percentage of fics out there. However, even if the fic is about the relationship long after it has started, the author should still think about the differences between the different thought processes of the different sexualities, and how said relationship afects their character in a what that makes the characters believable.<br><br>Yes, I&#39;ll admit it. I&#39;ve read the occasional bit of fluffy, sweet, shipping fics. Yes, I did enjoy them. Sorta. I mean, occasionally I would question the ship, but on the whole, it was just cute scenes that were enjoyable to read. They may or may not have involved cute pastel ponies. My masculinity has never been more secure.<br><br>C. You know, I don&#39;t think about sex all that much. I mean, yeah, every once in a while, but not near to the degree a lot of other people do. I&#39;m also rather uncomfortable talking about it in public, for some reason. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s not like I think sex is evil or anything, I just don&#39;t find it all too appropriate to talk about in many situations that others decide to bring it up. As such, you will almost never see any of my characters talk about the act of intercourse. Perhaps I&#39;m strange, but there you go.<br><br>D. Hold on, hold on... You mean Elves can&#39;t have sex? But then, how did Elrond come to be? How would the Elves reproduce? What, they were just planted into the ground and grew like a beautiful flower? How does that even work? For LoTR, I&#39;mma side with the Elf shippers on this one, unless some Tolkien nut provides some darn good explanation for this.<br><br>E. All of my yes. I mentioned this in my post, but it bears repeating. Stereotype does not equate understanding. In fact, stereotype is near the exact opposite of understanding. They are very loose observations shown or told to us by others that are used to fill in communication gaps until proper information is acquired about an individual or group. Unless you actually know about the group you are writing about, don&#39;t do it. Just don&#39;t.</p>

            <p>A. His name really doesn&#39;t have a &#39;D&#39; in it. I see that spelling all the time, but it really is Rogers. Steve Rodgers is a RL musician of some sort or a former Australian politician, depending on which Google article you click.  Just in case you do write stuff with him in it. What would a Marvel mini even be? Is there any PPC agent insane enough to try to disentangle the entirety of Marvel&#39;s canon to do a mission on a fic there? I think I&#39;d be scared to even send agents into a movie verse story, because so many of them have comics elements brought in to fill gaps in the movies.<br><br>By the way this is my favorite Captain America fic of all time. It speaks directly to what we&#39;ve been talking about here. You should give it a shot. <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/418371"> American Values </a><br><br>C. I did say maybe it didn&#39;t apply so much to some people, and I did say that just because it crosses a person&#39;s mind doesn&#39;t mean they act on it (that includes saying anything about it). I wasn&#39;t meaning like full fantasies by saying it goes through people&#39;s minds. More like those little thoughts that just wander across the mind for a second and then are gone. <br><br>I am bad about not writing anything of the sort into my characters&#39; thoughts though, so maybe I have no room to talk. :P<br><br>D. About the elves, if a fic was about Elrond and his wife, or Arwen and Aragorn, or Galadriel and Celeborn, etc. That I&#39;d be fine with. (And okay, I have to admit to having read other pairings and thinking that the fics themselves were fine, but I feel guilty while reading them, knowing that Tolkien would hate them.) Anyway most shipfics with elves in LotR are something like &#39;how many people can Legolas sleep with in this fic? hehe!&#39; <br><br></p>

            <p>Of course elves can have sex. But it’s biologically (or rather psychologically?) impossible for them to have random sex with near strangers.

            <p>From my understanding of the essay on the laws and customs of the Eldar, Tolkienverse elves believe in a soul (their term is &quot;fлa&quot;, I think), and that the act of sex is the union of the fлar, or souls. This means that during times of war, couples can &#39;elope&#39; by having sex. <br><br>This is why my Eldar agent, Eledhwen, goes berserk when Sues muck with the concept of soulmates, and why her relationship with her girlfriend/partner is not sexual (but still romantic).</p>

            <p>E is severely annoying to me whenever I encounter it in a fic.<br><br>One of my other personal pet peeves is turning Spock (and a few other characters, but I&#39;ve seen it most with Spock,) into this extremely jealous, controlling, obsessive guy. The narrative then usually goes on to giggle about the &#39;overprotective&#39; vulcan and how cute it is. Well, it&#39;s not cute, and on Spock it irritates me exponentially more because, like the elf example, Vulcan&#39;s are supposed to be better than that categorically. <br><br>Not to mention it&#39;s wildly OOC, and this is a canon where reality bending happens four to five times a season.</p>

            <p>Everything you said, and more<br><br><b>6. Bashing characters in order to make a ship &quot;work.&quot;</b><br>Maybe the pairing remains within an arm&#39;s reach of their normal characterization, but a canonical love interest gets bent out of canon in order to make room for the ship. (This happens in a lot of Spirk AOS fics: Uhura is either written out, as in most AU&#39;s, turns into a complete bitch, or is somehow quickly removed from the equation, usually by shipping her with someone else, in order to get Kirk and Spock together.)<br><br><b>7. Not understanding that not every close relationship is sexual.</b><br>I think this goes with out saying, but lots of ficthors forget that most human beings are capable of having friendships where they have no sexual feelings for the friend, and there&#39;s plenty of psychological failsafes in place in the human mind to keep incest down, such as the Westermarck effect. This lack of understanding is, I think, the root of a lot of incest fics. For example, I do not care that Thor and Loki are not biologically related, they were raised together from infancy, it&#39;s still a no. <br><br><b>8. Power differentials that would make normal people run for the hills.</b><br>Authors of fanfiction often forget to add characterization that would reassure me that one member of their pairing, usually the one with more power or experience, isn&#39;t just horribly using the other. Sometimes, I think this also comes from point 7: people who decide to make a mentor &amp; student relationship a sexual one in their fanfic, for example, are unlikely to do anything to reassure me that the student, even if of age and capable of giving informed consent, is not being somehow manipulated into the relationship, either overtly or because they think they should do it to please their mentor.<br><br><b>9. Lack of representation.</b> This nitpick ties into 1, 7, 8, and 9. Most fanfic authors assume that all romantic relationships or primary partnerships are sexual, and they often try to overwrite actual character dynamics in order to achieve that. But in general, fanfic ignores friendships and relationships that are purely romantic, and treats them as a  mere stepping stone to a sexual relationship, even with asexual characters. They also tend to state things like &quot;no, Tony Stark is pansexual, he&#39;d totally sleep with Steve or Clint&quot; and then, once they&#39;ve shoved him into the pairing, never give a thought to it... rather like writers who seem to forget that characters can be bi or pan and only concentrate on their current relationship, but you&#39;d think that fanfic authors, many of whom have at least some education on the matter, would be a little better at it. (Some of them are.) Another thing that fanfic authors don&#39;t often think about is whether or not the sex drives they&#39;ve written for the characters are reasonable. Going back to Marvelverse, it&#39;s pretty well established that Tony Stark&#39;s libido before he became iron man was pretty high, so  it could still be pretty high despite clear signs of building PTSD and the arc reactor in his chest. Maybe even high enough to mostly justify the amount of sex they&#39;re writing into the fic: but like real humans, other characters will have varying libidos, and writing every single pairing having sex at the drop of a hat is pretty ridiculous.</p>

            <p>I find that it is perfectly fine to create alternate interpretations of ships, even canonically sexual or romantic ships, as long as the characterisations are preserved. For instance, in J. Anon&#39;s &quot;Observations&quot; Kirk and Spock are sexually involved, but Spock maintains a deep emotional and platonic bond with Uhura (they call each other brother and sister). Does this overturn the canonical definition of the Spuhura ship? Yes. But it&#39;s written well and plausibly, so I am fine with it.<br><br>(I know a girl here at school who doesn&#39;t like Spuhura because she thinks it&#39;s just Hollywood trying to pair off one of the few female leads of the film with some guy. I understand her perspective, but I also understand the perspective in favour of Spuhura because Uhura being with Spock is positive representation for WOC, as it shows that women of colour can be love interests, too.)<br><br>Conversely, I find myself frequently expressing a wish for characters like John and Sherlock from BBC Sherlock and Dorian and John from Almost Human to become romantically or sexually involved in the canon, because. Let&#39;s go to the point of representation there.<br><br>Canonically, these two pairings are obviously deeply platonic to some degree. They all care about each other. It&#39;s not that hard a stretch to make it a romantic relationship from there. Sex can be added if needed. I understand that platonic bonds are important, but I feel like as it is, the mainstream media likes to imply that what could be strong platonic bonds between male and female characters are in fact romantic, and that what could be strong romantic bonds between characters of the same gender are in fact platonic. By making Johnlock and Jorian canon, we go against the prevailing &quot;no homo&quot; attitude in mainstream media.<br><br>(This is why I love platonic Joan and Sherlock in Elementary. The two care about each other and respect each other, but the writers consciously attempt not to get them romantically involved. It goes against the media&#39;s prevailing &quot;will they or won&#39;t they&quot; attitude towards female-male friendships.)<br><br>It&#39;s not necessary to be a certain sexuality in order to fall in love with someone. I know straight people who fall in love with people of their gender. People have exceptions all the time; they&#39;re <i>people</i>, not labels. No one&#39;s going to conform 100% to the sexuality they choose for themselves, and heck, they may even change that sexuality several times throughout their lives.  <br><br>So, to tie it all together, I personally find that in some cases, if certain ships were canon it would help progress the show&#39;s social representation. And in others, different interpretations of canonical relationships to allow for a wider range of relationship representation is also good. Of course, all of this is assuming the writer does their research into sexual orientations, romantic orientations, etc, and don&#39;t just play by stereotypes in their writing (I am sick and tired of seeing asexuals as boring or overly scientific and neurotic WE&#39;RE PEOPLE TOO, DANGIT).<br><br>...Did that even make sense, or...<br></p>

            <p>It made much sense: my problem with some shippers who attempt to put Johnlock or Spirk into the picture is that they often attempt to change the characterization to shoehorn in things that they thought were cute but are totally out of character, or, like I said, they write Uhura out completely. In canon, both AOS and TOS, Spock has utmost respect for Uhura, so him being completely oblivious to the fact that she&#39;s completely disappeared from the fic is suspicious at best. Numbers 4 and 5 on my list of pet peeves are bad and lazy writing: later numbers are more about the prevalence of shipping taking over a fic whenever it&#39;s introduced and the fact that once some ficthors get characters pair up, they completely ignore the characters&#39; assorted friends and family for the remainder of the fic. Even otherwise really good ship fics suffer from this sudden narrowing of focus, to the point where I can&#39;t tell you how many Johnlock fics I&#39;ve abandoned because I knew that neither the unresolved mystery nor the rest of the cast were going to appear in the next five chapters once they got to the sex scenes, or how many Spirk fics conveniently forget that there&#39;s a starship to run. (Which isn&#39;t as much of a problem in AU&#39;s, but I like that starship, dang it! I&#39;ve spent a rather long time watching it, after all.)<br><br>I&#39;ll be won over by plausibile and in-character alternate ships, especially in AU&#39;s, like 99% of the time. I&#39;m more likely to heartily approve of the shipping in works where the rest of the cast remains in character and somewhat relevant too: this tends to me reading a lot of <i>reeeealy</i> long fics, because they&#39;re more likely to be whole cast fics. Personally, I think that the media would improve a lot with variety - both more leading same sex relationships and more leading male and female friendships, like you said. And you know what, ficthors would probably get better at writing a variety of relationships if the media were more willing to deviate from only glorifying heterosexual romances.</p>

            <p>Sevanswans, I can understand that as an abstract value, &quot;diversity&quot; is usually something to be championed. But I think that there is a difference between, on the one hand, showing, e.g., that women of color can be legitimate love interests; and, on the other hand, portraying alternate sexual behavior as just as normal as heterosexual behavior.<br><br>Granted, there is a level of what can legitimately be called &quot;homophobia&quot; out there, such as the attacks on gay bars in Russia, or the recent passage of the anti-homosexuality law in Uganda (which I&#39;m against, <i>especially</i> as a Christian. <a href="http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FS/FS096.html#FSQ96A2THEP1">Aquinas makes my point best: Human law does not, and really should not, proscribe all vices.</a>). In <i>that</i> wise, it is important that people learn that homo (or bi-, or pan-)sexuals are <i>people</i> and not somehow subhuman.<br><br>However, I contend that it is another thing altogether for the media to push the idea that homosexuality is normal, especially with cultural pressures saying otherwise. So I think that there is at least something to be said for the media&#39;s unwillingness to deviate from social norms.<br><br>So, granted, though it might be a lot easier for ficwriters to be better at portraying alternate relationships if they were presented more in the media (itself a dubious assumption, as I am willing to bet that there is just as much bad het as there is bad slash), I think that not only might such increased representation not occur in the media, but also that it might not be a good idea <i>for</i> it to happen.</p>

            <p>I am not going to claim I agree with what son<em>of</em>heaven176 said. But the offensive nature of the statement seemed to be largely a mistake in phrasing rather than hateful feelings, which people have, in civil and orderly terms, told him off for, and he has since apologized for. There is no need to turn this into a personal attack.<br><br>Blaming the mods(which we don&#39;t actually have, by the way) for not banning someone in response to phrasing mishaps that the original poster has since recanted is an incorrect path of thought. Your linked article implies that, if no one speaks out against someone who has offensive or problematic views, then the community will begin to be full of those problematic views. There&#39;s a certain logic to that, and it is not in and of itself incorrect. However, people <i>did</i> speak out against it. <i>Immediately</i>. In fact, an equally toxic path would lie in not shutting down posts like this, where the response to a misunderstanding that has since been more-or-less resolved is enormous hostility.<br><br>It&#39;s fine to think whatever you feel like about what was said. I don&#39;t agree with it, and I am not supporting son<em>of</em>heaven176&#39;s original statement. But escalating what was to this point an incident that, while significant, had been summarily shut down by others, and doing so with swearing, personal attacks, and what I am relatively certain is a death threat... no. That goes too far for an offense that does not deserve it. I&#39;ve seen the original Jacer threads, and I do <i>not</i> want to repeat that. It does not matter <i>who</i> the aggressor is here, if this turns from a shipping thread into a flame war, we&#39;re never going to be able to make it stop. Cut it out.</p>

            <p>In a bit of a shortened way, since I don&#39;t want to bring anything political into this, and I&#39;m not 100% certain that I understand your argument. (Yes, this is short compared to what I wanted to write.) You&#39;re in quotes.<br><br>&quot;I think that there is a difference between, on the one hand, showing, e.g., that women of color can be legitimate love interests; and, on the other hand, portraying alternate sexual behavior as just as normal as heterosexual behavior.&quot;<br><br>I am... not comfortable whatsoever with how you phrased this (I think maybe you meant &quot;common&quot; instead of &quot;normal,&quot; since &quot;normal&quot; is a pretty loaded word and varies from era to era and culture to culture,) but if you meant what I <i>think</i> you mean and you&#39;re making a case that we shouldn&#39;t have, say, 50% of our media romances be homosexual and 50% be heterosexual... my question is why? The characters involved will, presumably, be fictional personages who are of age and fully capable of making their own choices, and the viewers are all human beings who are completely capable of deciding whether or not they approve, either in general or on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>In addition, my &quot;diversity&quot; as an abstract value was taking into account that we need <i>more than just romances</i> in the media: we need committed and supportive friendships, we need strong families, we need intensely personal stories about people who don&#39;t need any love interests to make them want to overcome their problems, and we need stories where people are judged by their actions first and any category they happen to fall into second. I mean, personally, I like stories about saving the world. I&#39;d love if the media didn&#39;t automatically assume that any character who was going to save the world has to be a straight white male.<br><br>As for the media&#39;s &quot;unwillingness to deviate from social norms,&quot; well, the media is influential. Media representation and all the social and cultural aspects of why, say, Hollywood doesn&#39;t cast more Asian actors, or more female leading roles, are way too complicated to reduce to a subset of this argument. To make this short, I understand why the media follows well-known storytelling formulas and casting formulas - it&#39;s a cultural path of least resistance for them: they know they will make money following the formula. <br><br>However, it&#39; is my opinion that if the media woke up tomorrow and decided to pursue more diverse representation - if, say, the leading character of 50% of the movies across all genres scheduled for 2015 was female - they&#39;d find that the majority of society was more than ready to make the transition.<br><br>There will be stumbles in the media, and bad portrayals. But there are extremely bad movies even following the current formula. There are plenty of movies that promote frankly awful heterosexual relationships, and books that glorify abuse. Ones that become popular can lead to many copycat works that have the same problems, and to people legitimately believing that the romances in question are good and trying to model their own lives after them, often disastrously. Where the media fails at promoting diverse relationships will often be the same areas they have <i>already</i> failed at promoting healthy heterosexual relationships, which is a problem with the system, and not with inclusion.     </p>

            <p>A sustained and honest push for increased diversity is important because our society relies more and more on the media to form it&#39;s opinions. As you said, it&#39;s very important for people to learn empathy via the media, that people who are different races, religions, and sexualities than them are people - but it is <i>extremely important</i> for them to also learn that they&#39;re equally as important as the media&#39;s default straight white male. To do that, they need to be shown as main characters across all genres, and all aspects of their lives need to be just as important. Therefore, when they are main characters, their jobs, friendships, romances, religions, and accomplishments need to be given as much attention as the creators would have given friendship, romance, religion, jobs, and accomplishments if the main character had been the default straight white male.<br><br>Can the media do this? Probably, if not in the next five years then in the next fifteen. It will take work, it will take change from the comfortable routine, and it will take risks, all of which are things that deeply disturb large industries like the media. However, this does not, to me, mean that they should not <i>try</i>, and put some effort into it at that rather than having just one or two more &quot;diverse&quot; movies a year. <br><br>Since you like Aquinas: &quot;Better to illuminate than merely to shine, to deliver to others contemplated truths than merely to contemplate.&quot;<br><br>In short: yes, I do believe that the media should promote diversity in all the points which I&#39;ve discussed in this thread, and that fandom will benefit to some degree from it: it certainly won&#39;t loose out.</p>

            <p>No, I am not being facetious in my subject. You do make some great points, many of which I agree with. I am sorry that my poor choice of words in the previous post led to a view of me that frankly, is false, and furthermore, is unworthy of a PPC Boarder.<br><br>I know that the Board is not a forum for political debate, nor do I want it to become so. I only hope that when issues such as these come up, that all sides are able to express their opinions, popular or no. Obviously, we all agree that we need to be mature about the way we express ourselves on such touchy subjects, and, given the responses, I admit again that the way I expressed myself was amiss.<br><br>That said, since you <i>did</i> respond to what I said, please allow me to reply, especially since I have given some thought to it. Quotes are in italics. Where you italicized in the original, I’ve underlined.<br><br><i>In addition, my &quot;diversity&quot; as an abstract value was taking into account that we need <u>more than just romances</u> in the media: we need committed and supportive friendships, we need strong families, we need intensely personal stories about people who don&#39;t need any love interests to make them want to overcome their problems, and we need stories where people are judged by their actions first and any category they happen to fall into second. I mean, personally, I like stories about saving the world. I&#39;d love if the media didn&#39;t automatically assume that any character who was going to save the world has to be a straight white male.</i><br>And I honestly and vociferously agree with every single sentence in that paragraph! In fact, I alluded in part to that same thing in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=256011;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">my first post</a>. (“[T]he media seem to be quick to portray any close relationship as either being romantic/sexual, or else heading in that direction.”) We need more than just &quot;guy meets girl and gets it on&quot;!<br><br>I did not think to highlight that in the other post because, first, I thought I had adequately addressed it, and second, because I was laser-focused on the point of <i>disagreement</i>. Unfortunately, it seems that things have been misconstrued by others (including a certain vitriolic post that I will not legitimize with a link)—thankfully, not including you. Again, I am not against having more diverse casts and leading roles. Recall that I myself am not of the WASP demographic, as <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=239183">I</a> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=244737">am</a> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=244870">Haitian</a>. If <i>anyone</i> ought to know what being misunderstood and discriminated against is like, <i>I</i> should. That said, off to that narrow point of disagreement:<br><br><i>[I]f you meant what I <u>think</u> you mean and you&#39;re making a case that we shouldn&#39;t have, say, 50% of our media romances be homosexual and 50% be heterosexual...</i><br>Which is exactly what I was saying<br><br><i>my question is why? The characters involved will, presumably, be fictional personages who are of age and fully capable of making their own choices, and the viewers are all human beings who are completely capable of deciding whether or not they approve, either in general or on a case-by-case basis.</i><br><br>Of course, people are free moral agents. However, you actually make my point <i>for</i> me, not once, but <i>twice</i>:<br><i>[T]he media is influential.</i><br>. . .<br><i>[O]ur society relies more and more on the media to form it&#39;s</i> (should be “its”) <i>opinions.</i><br><br>And <i>that</i>, fellow Boarder, is the crux of the matter. It is exactly <i>because</i> the media is so influential that I am so leery. Here is the distinction that I should have made (and which, I admit, is slightly different than what I stated before):<br><br>* on the one hand, the fact that a person is not a straight WASP male makes no difference in regards to what contributions he or she can make to society. Quoting you: <i>As you said, it&#39;s very important for people to learn empathy via the media, that people who are different races, religions, and sexualities than them are people—[and] it is <u>extremely important</u> for them to also learn that they&#39;re equally as important as the media&#39;s default straight white male. . . . [W]hen they are main characters, their jobs, friendships, romances, religions, and accomplishments need to be given as much attention as the creators would have given friendship, romance, religion, jobs, and accomplishments if the main character had been the default straight white male.</i><br><br>HOWEVER,<br><br>* on the other hand, people must not be coerced into believing that those, like me, who disagree with the homosexual lifestyle are either ignorant, behind the times, or are compelled by some homophobic animus. There are valid arguments on both sides, and I fear lest the culture forbids one side from being heard because people have been conditioned to believe, <i>a priori</i>, that that side is not worthy of being heard. It is one thing for people to make a reasoned decision, supported by emotion, that a view is reprehensible. It is another thing for people to believe that a view is reprehensible “just because.”</p>

            <p>I know you&#39;ve already apologized once for the language you&#39;ve used, but I still feel that I need to address a phrase that you used here.<br><br><i>. . . who disagree with the homosexual lifestyle . . . </i><br><br>Two points.  First, that &quot;homosexual lifestyle.&quot;  I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to mean through this phrase.  The lifestyle of a homosexual person is absolutely no different than the lifestyle of a heterosexual person.  They both wake up in the morning, eat breakfast, go to work, come home, pay bills, watch TV and go to sleep again.  There&#39;s nothing in the daily or weekly or monthly lives of either demographic that significantly deviates.<br><br>Secondly, that &quot;disagree.&quot;  &quot;Disagree&quot; is a word used for debates or decisions, things where there are multiple possible answers, with no obvious correct one.  That is not the case here.  Homosexuality is a real thing that exists.  Some people are homosexual.  That is a fact.  It is the <i>truth</i>.  That is not something that can be disagreed with, by you or me or anyone else.  That would be like me disagreeing with someone&#39;s taste in breakfast cereals, or disagreeing with what temperature range they feel comfortable in without needing a jacket or a fan.  Those things have no basis in a person&#39;s moral compass, they just <i>are</i>, and sexuality is the same.  There&#39;s nothing there with which to disagree; people just do what they do.</p>

            <p>The reason calling other people sinful paints a target, as you say, is because <i>doing that is wrong</i>.  It is a bad and mean-spirited thing to do.

You can&#39;t expect to be free to say whatever you want, but then be afraid of others expressing a different opinion back to you.&quot;<br><br>In the abstract, you are correct. Yet note that ever since I gave my apology, I have explicitly tried <i>not</i> to say anything judgmental about anyone. So I understand what you are trying to say, but I cannot be afraid of the consequences of an action that I have not done. In fact, I explicitly said that the wording that I could have used was <i>not</i> what I wanted to use.<br><br>That said, however, please allow me to say this: In one wise, you are mistaken. You say: &quot;The reason calling other people sinful paints a target, as you say, is because doing that is wrong. It is a bad and mean-spirited thing to do.&quot; <br><br>Your argument is amiss: though expressing the opinion that someone&#39;s actions are wrong may <i>offend</i> the person allegedly in the wrong, that does <i>not</i> automatically make the speaker&#39;s actions mean-spirited, much less wrong.<br><br>Allow me to give an illustration. In yesterday&#39;s episode of <i>Arrow</i>, Oliver Queen tried to dissuade the Huntress from killing her father in revenge for him killing her fiancй. Why? Because murder is wrong, and would not bring her fiancй back. Did the Huntress want to hear it? Obviously not. But was Oliver mean-spirited? Again, obviously not.<br><br>Now before I get misunderstood, I am <i>not</i> trying to equate homosexuality with murder. What I <i>am</i> trying to say is that the mere statement of a value judgment is not mean-spirited. Can a statement be given in a mean-spirited fashion? Of course. Case in point: the late Fred Phelps. But note that throughout this whole side conversation, I have not attacked anyone. (If I have, please point it out.) Yes, I have mentioned my stance, but only in the broader context of arguing that though greater representation of homosexual couples in the media may arguably give fanwriters the ability to better portray homosexual characters in fanfiction, there may be other consequences to such heightened exposure.<br><br>Now if you want to comment further on whether I am a mean-spirited person, or on whether my stance is outdated and needs to change, then I would gladly continue this discussion—<a href="mailto:sonofheaven176@gmail.com">by email</a>. I have acknowledged that the Board is no place for political—or religious—discussion, and though I would gladly continue down this tangent, I would much rather prefer to clear the air and allow the usual PPC silliness to return to the Board, for what binds the PPC is our common devotion to the sporking of badfic and the promulgation of goodfic, whatever our actions may be in the bedroom.</p>

            <p>Been following this thread silently for a while; stepping in here because I think I have a brilliant argument and I want to share it.<br><br>If I understand you right, you&#39;re concerned that if gay people get proportionate, positive representation in the media, this will automatically characterize people like yourself as ignorant and hateful in the eye of the public.<br><br>Er, how? How exactly does showing people different from you in a positive light say anything at all about you one way or the other?<br><br>Lemme draw an analogy with drinking alcohol. This is my self-presumed-brilliant argument.<br><br><i>NOTE: This is PURELY for the purpose of analyzing the question above and is not meant to be a complete or accurate representation of my personal opinions about alcohol OR sexuality.</i><br><br>I don&#39;t drink, and I don&#39;t want to drink. I prefer tea. I&#39;m against the idea of drinking because I think it&#39;s harmful and often ruins people&#39;s lives. I also don&#39;t much care for the culture of going out to the bar or the club on the weekends and getting drunk for fun. I don&#39;t understand how this could possibly appeal to anyone.<br><br>However, I believe that people who drink aren&#39;t inherently stupid or evil, and are perfectly capable of leading fulfilling, productive lives, contributing positively to society, and generally being awesome. I have lots of friends who drink. What they do for fun on their own time is none of my business. Just as long as no one tries to force <i>me</i> to drink, we&#39;re cool.<br><br>Drinking and people who drink are quite often portrayed positively in the media (and negatively, too, but we&#39;re focusing on the positive for this analogy). Bar/club culture is often glorified, portrayed as something so awesome everyone should want to be a part of it.<br><br>Do you see anyone automatically assuming teetotalers like me are ignorant or hateful because we don&#39;t like it and are not a part of it? Would you suggest that the media shouldn&#39;t portray a fair portion of people who drink? Do you think everyone who sees drinking portrayed positively in the media suddenly feels an irresistible desire to guzzle PBR and hang around in bars, and never enjoy tea again? ... I&#39;m guessing no? Because that&#39;s silly?<br><br>---<br><br>I realize that drinking currently is seen as acceptable in the culture at large and being gay currently isn&#39;t, but I think that actually make the analogy stronger, since we&#39;re discussing a not-so-distant time when being gay IS accepted enough to have a fair, proportionate representation. I&#39;m not getting into the matter of choice, but let me just make it clear that I don&#39;t think <i>anyone</i> chooses their sexuality or who they love, and I <i>do</i> think that people who insist otherwise are ignoring pretty much all the science ever. Anecdotally, I certainly don&#39;t recall <i>choosing</i> to be attracted to Phobos. It just kinda happened, and I went along with it even though it scared the bejeezus out of me when I had no idea what the seven hells I was going to do with all those <i>feelings</i>. It turned out pretty awesome in the end! {= D<br><br>ANYWAY, the point is that portraying a set of people positively in the media doesn&#39;t automatically make anyone who isn&#39;t one of them them the bad guy. Portraying a set of people as the bad guy makes them the bad guy. It&#39;s entirely possible to have oodles of films, books, etc., that portray gay people being awesome without making a statement one way or the other about people who aren&#39;t gay, dislike the idea of getting it on with their own sex, personally abstain from doing so for religious reasons, etc. Also, fearing that you&#39;ll look bad simply because other people look good doesn&#39;t make any logical sense, and should not be used as a basis for excluding people from representation.<br><br>I&#39;ve assumed here that your views on homosexuality are as reasoned as you say they are, in which case they are open to being swayed if reason can prove them flawed. I&#39;ve personally never heard an anti-gay argument I didn&#39;t find logically flawed and unintentionally harmful at the least or deliberately ignorant and reprehensible at worst, so I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll reconsider thoroughly and often.<br><br>~Neshomeh (who will read that chapter eventually. &gt;.<br> </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll answer in brief. If you want to continue (or anyone else for that matter), feel free to <a href="mailto:sonofheaven176@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.<br><br>First and foremost, for <i>any</i> post, it&#39;s usually possible that I could have been clearer. I&#39;ll just say this: I&#39;m not saying that positive portrayals of homosexual romances will <i>in and of themselves</i> lead to the marginalization of those who disagree; what I <i>am</i> saying is that they are a step in that direction. Think about it: If homosexual couples are just as common as heterosexual couples (for that would be the portrayal), and if it is completely harmless (for so the media portrays it, and so the argument goes), then those who say that homosexuality is somehow &quot;wrong&quot; must have something wrong with them!<br><br>As for your analogy, it falls short. Here&#39;s why: In the case of cultural acceptance of homosexuality, it&#39;s not a matter of &quot;I&#39;ll do what I want, and you do what you want; let&#39;s not bother each other,&quot; as is the case with drinking.<br>If I were to say, &quot;I don&#39;t drink for religious reasons,&quot; no one would object.<br>Even if I said, &quot;I don&#39;t think you should drink; it is a sin,&quot; you might say, &quot;Don&#39;t try to tell me not to drink,&quot; but we could still be friends afterwards.<br>(I am only speaking hypothetically; I have no such religious qualms about drinking. Getting <i>drunk</i>, on the other hand...)<br>Only if I were being nasty and pushy about it would it be a ground for antagonism between me and my alcohol-enjoying friend—and rightly so.<br><br>However, when it comes to homosexuality, I believe that the way things are is more akin to &quot;I&#39;ll do what I want, and you&#39;d better not say anything about it!&quot;<br>So let&#39;s return to those same statements.<br>&quot;I&#39;m Christian; I&#39;m heterosexual.&quot; No one would object.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t think you should be seeing [people of the same gender as you]; it is a sin.&quot; The response? &quot;You&#39;re homophobic!&quot;<br><br>As I said, I was only answering in brief. However, I hope that what I said sufficed. If not, <a href="mailto:sonofheaven176@gmail.com">I am amenable to continuing this conversation by e-mail.</a></p>

            <p>Miah and doctorlit made some excellent points, and I don&#39;t feel like debating is any good when it gets down to &quot;for the Bible tells me so.&quot; Debating opinions based on empirical fact and life experience can be constructive and intellectually stimulating; debating belief sucks, because it never goes anywhere.<br><br>However, I must say I actually would object if you told <i>me</i> not to get drunk because <i>you</i> believe it&#39;s a sin. I&#39;d much rather that <i>you</i> don&#39;t get drunk if you believe it&#39;s a sin, and let me behave as my own beliefs dictate. If anything, I&#39;d have you approach me with reason and science, which we can all share and which won&#39;t insist that there&#39;s something wrong with me as a person if I&#39;m mistaken. This is why we object to you telling gay people what they do is a sin (and therefore that they are spiritually corrupt and damned to burn in Hell). You don&#39;t want to be told there&#39;s something wrong with you if your beliefs are false. Neither do gay people. Neither does <i>anyone</i>. We should all have more respect for each other than that.<br><br>Ultimately, I figure what happens to our immortal souls (if we have them) is between us and whatever is in charge of them (if anything). I think we should all just mind our own spiritual business and not try to dictate that other people live their lives according to our beliefs.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I would also link to this great research article on how diversity representation in media does matter (TL;DR of that report: the only kids who really honestly feel good about themselves are white boys, because everyone else is so under-represented  that they either have to learn to identify with characters who aren&#39;t completely them, or believe that they, as girls or people of colour, can&#39;t be heroes of these stories either), but I don&#39;t have a link. I&#39;ll find one eventually.<br><br>I can say that personally, I can see the effects of media representation. Lucy Liu&#39;s Watson in Elementary has been my role model for the past year, and I find myself sympathising with Cho Chang from Harry Potter more than I used to. I love Mako Mori from Pacific Rim to death, because it shows that 1) people like me can be heroes and that 2) people like me can be close friends and mental soulmates with another lead without becoming a love interest (because oh-so-frequently Asian women in media tend to be sexualised into the love interest, in comparison to many of the other non-WASP races represented in media). </p>

            <p>You and Lily bring me to a point that I originally wanted to make in response to World-Jumper&#39;s post. It seems that our culture is partly to blame for the modern phenomenon in shipping. I mean this: in general, the media seem to be quick to portray any close relationship as either being romantic/sexual, or else heading in that direction; it&#39;s a rarity to see truly platonic relationships such as, e.g., Frodo and Sam in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. For someone raised nowadays, two men who care so much about each other <i>must</i> be gay! A guy and a girl cannot be just friends; they <i>must</i> eventually hook up. If only the show didn&#39;t have that pesky low rating, or if the writers just got their acts together, we might be able to see teh hott secks.<br><br>Add to that the fact that our educational system just fails at producing people with a modicum of literacy or critical thinking skills, and what do we have? Bad shipfic aplenty!</p>

            <p>Well, pretty much every hairstyle that has a braid that goes across the head like a headband like that she used to call a heidi braid. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s official or something she picked up from a magazine, though.</p>

            <p>That second link--the rope braid--is what I was looking for. One question, though: Do the braids <i>have</i> to end in a bun in the back? Because what I&#39;m envisioning are rope braids on either side of her head and joining at the back. The rest of her hair stays free, flowing under the ropes. Is that possible?</p>

            <p>And to anyone who says to me, &quot;But, Dawn, <i>yesterday</i> was Purim&quot;, I say, &quot;Yes, but today is Purim too!&quot; (And I&#39;m not quoting Sam Winchester just for the fun of it, it really is).<br><br>For those of you unaware of what Purim actually is, it&#39;s a Jewish holiday where we celebrate an ancient deliverance from destruction by doing many things: getting together to read the account of what happened, dressing up in costumes (which range from <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=hamantaschen&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DhYnU8qgE6nlyQG_8YC4CQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643">hamantaschen</a> to characters from the account to animals to, well, anything you want to dress up as is fine), getting drunk to the point where you can&#39;t tell the difference between the villain and the hero of the account, giving gifts of food to friends, and giving money, food, and so on to charity...there are many, many traditions, and, well, they can be extremely fun.<br><br>Now, when I say that today is Purim too, I really mean that it&#39;s Shushan Purim (Shushan, or Susa, being the capital city in which most of the Purim story takes place), which is the day on which residents of walled cities celebrate Purim. It falls one day later than Purim, which was yesterday, so Happy Shushan Purim! (What&#39;s really fun to do, especially if you&#39;re in Israel, is to spend Purim somewhere and then go into Jerusalem and celebrate Shushan Purim. Two days of Purim! It&#39;s awesome.) Why am I letting you know about this holiday, you may ask? Well, I&#39;ve got an idea.<br><br>The idea is this: Someone, somewhere in the PPC, is throwing a Purim party. Everyone is invited: costumes are preferred, hamantaschen and drinks and many other things will be served, someone will attempt to read the Megillah (that is, the account of the Purim story), and there will probably be a good deal of chaos.<br><br><b><u>Some guidelines/things to note:</u></b><br><br>-<u>Everyone is welcome</u>. That means new agents, old agents, reluctant agents, enthusiastic agents, agents who wandered in by mistake...everyone. It also means minis, kids, and possibly pets. Free-To-Use Agents are also good.<br><br>-<u>This is newbie-inclusive!</u> While I know some newbies (often depending on just how new they are) have agents they&#39;re thinking about, many other newbies don&#39;t--and, well, this is Purim. It&#39;s a party. Everyone should be able to come! So...<i>everyone includes Boarders</i>, with the condition that you&#39;re incognito! Pretend to be your costumes, pretend to be newly-recruited agents, whatever you like--as long as you remember that the vast majority of PPC HQ&#39;s inhabitants don&#39;t know the Board exists (and would forget if they found out). Of course, this isn&#39;t just for newbies; if you&#39;re not a newbie and you really, really want to, write yourself in! The same rules apply, though.<br><br>-<u>On canon-compliance:</u> this one is up to you. Knowing me, I&#39;m probably going to end up referencing this at some point, although without huge amounts of detail--probably just &quot;That was one crazy party, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; &quot;Yes, it was! I couldn&#39;t even hear the end of the Megillah...&quot; &quot;Didn&#39;t someone nearly start a tribble infestation?&quot; &quot;...nearly?&quot; /slow stares/ &quot;Oh dear.&quot; ...Anyway, you can call this canon or not (or anything in between) for your agents as you wish. It&#39;s entirely up to you.<br><br>-<u>Have fun!</u> Oh, and, have <a href="http://ohr.edu/5756">an interesting article</a> on interpreting the mitzvah (commandment/good deed) of drinking on Purim...it may come in handy. (Any Hebrew words in there that you can&#39;t figure out, bring them to me for explanation).<br><br>So, how about it? Shall we throw a party?<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: To start, here, have some virtual hamantaschen...there are plenty of types, so I&#39;m sure you can all find some that you like!<br><br>PPS: And so it begins:<br><br>In 2014 HST, on a day that was probably Shushan Purim, every single inhabitant of PPC HQ found an invitation in their room. Even the Nursery got them; even the Flowers. It was later rumored that even the residents of New Caledonia found the invitations, all displayed in prominent places, all brightly colored and inviting.<br><br>The message read as follows:<br><br><i><font color="red">Sick of work? Want to break free? Just want a drink?</font><br><font color="orange">This is your lucky day!</font><br><font color="intelligentairhead">Come to the room in PPC HQ—you know the one—and join the party! Today is <font color="yellow">Purim</font>, and celebration is imminent!</font><br><font color="blue">Food, drinks, and a lot of fun!</font> <font color="skyblue">Bring your friends, minis, and kids!</font> <font color="apple">Learn, cut loose, and just enjoy!</font><br><font color="carmine">(Costumes encouraged)</font></i><br><br>There was no signature, nor even a hint as to where the messages had come from. And on top of each piece of fireproof paper, enough hamantaschen for every inhabitant of each room sat innocently.<br><br><br><font color="PurimHamantaschen"><i>Will you join the fun?</i></font></p>

            <p>Upon hearing the loud knock at his RC door, Copernicus almost involuntarily looked up to focus on it. The golem briefly weighed the benefits of ignoring the sound and continuing to fine-tune the charge port for his new mini-Colossus with the cons that might result if whoever was on the other side tried to force the door open. Opting for the path that would at least allow him more prep time for interaction, he stood up, taking a brief moment to untangle a wire from his cogs.<br><br>&quot;Excuse me, Anersin,&quot; he said to the mini perched on the couch. &quot;I have to answer this.&quot; Anersin beeped in acknowledgement as Copernicus walked toward the special-sized RC door, and watched as he opened it with a massive clockwork hand.<br><br>Upon doing so, however, the golem was confronted with the sight of a short Dersite with his hands in the pockets of an enormous, garishly-colored coat. No two patches were alike in color or texture, the lapels in particular contrasting brightly with its more-or-less red theme, and seemingly as an afterthought, the being&#39;s normally-bald head was adorned with a floppy blond wig.<br><br>&quot;Hey, Nick!&quot; the Dersite greeted him familiarly as he squeezed around his partner&#39;s mechanical bulk into the RC. &quot;Still here, huh? I thought you&#39;d either be down looking for a costume or up in the Observatory hiding again.&quot;<br><br>The golem only spared a moment to be baffled before remembering who he was dealing with. He sighed, the noise producing a grinding hum deep in his vocal vents. He would need to use simple, direct questions. &quot;Hiding from what, Lonny? And why exactly are you dressed like that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, like this?&quot; Lonny performed a theatrical half-twirl. &quot;I&#39;m Colin Baker! I got this costume for a steal down at the general store. Well, the coat, mostly. Kelemen said he&#39;d been having a hard time selling it.&quot;<br><br>Copernicus shifted the position of his feet to get a better look at the coat, and quickly realized that he still found it hideous, even at the new angle. &quot;Well, then, it was very good of you to take it off of his hands, especially if there are other people searching for costumes at this time, as you implied. I know how difficult it is having to unload surplus commodities after their value as a craze item has ended.&quot;<br><br>Lonny groaned and rolled his eyes. &quot;No, no, no. That was a perfect setup for something like &#39;I can&#39;t imagine why&#39; or &#39;You know, there might&#39;ve been a good reason for that&#39;. You&#39;ll never learn if you don&#39;t take opportunities like this, man!&quot;<br><br>Copernicus briefly considered pursuing this, but wrote it off as a lost cause. It would be better to ask more direct questions. &quot;Lonny,&quot; he asked, &quot;<i>Why</i>, precisely, are people buying so many costumes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, right!&quot; Lonny fished around in one of the internal pockets of his new outfit and pulled out a message decorated in almost as many colors as the coat. &quot;There&#39;s a party today! It&#39;s Purim&#39;s birthday, or anniversary, or baby shower, or something, and she wants us all to dress up! I didn&#39;t really read too far into it, honestly, because the shifting colors started to give me a headache, but hey, anyplace with free food and an opportunity to dress up like the Doctor is a place I can get behind! And you&#39;re coming with me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And why would that be?&quot;<br><br>Lonny grinned, showing that his dedication to the costume hadn&#39;t included covering up his sharp Dersite teeth. &quot;Twofold: because it&#39;d be an opportunity to do some more of that &#39;meeting new people&#39; and &#39;expanding cultural knowledge&#39; you&#39;re always yakking about but never actually getting down to doing, and because without you there, there&#39;d be no first line of defense if I decide to do something you&#39;d regret answering questions about later. And I <i>know</i> you don&#39;t want that.&quot;<br><br>Copernicus thought about this for a moment, musing mostly over how non-specific his partner&#39;s second point was and weighing the possibilities for both mentioned opportunities. After a few seconds, he relented. Shuffling to the nearby closet, he carefully opened the door and lifted out several items, stacking them one by one into two piles on the floor until he pulled out a sombrero and a large blue domino mask.<br><br>&quot;This will do.&quot; he remarked to no one in particular, and managed to loop the mask&#39;s string around his head with much less effort than one would have expected with a head as large and smooth as his.<br><br>Lonny snickered. &quot;You know, I hadn&#39;t even considered this before, but those masks really don&#39;t have the same effect when the guy wearing them doesn&#39;t have a mouth.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was not my decision. They were leftovers from the Christmas party.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aaand another opportunity gone. &#39;Says the guy with the patchwork coat&#39;, maybe?&quot; Lonny shrugged. &quot;Whatever.&quot; His eyes brightened. &quot;Hey, wait, the Christmas party? Do I get to hear a story from this mysterious escapade on the way to Purim&#39;s room?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will never discuss the Christmas party.&quot;</p>

            <p>Especially this one, I must say. It&#39;s good to see Lonny and Copernicus again, and this scene was hilarious. Especially Lonny&#39;s Purim misconceptions, his Doctor outfit, all the exchanges between the agents--y&#39;know what, forget it, I just enjoyed the whole thing.<br><br>...is he going to spend half the party trying to find Purim now? That could be hilarious.<br><br>But yes. Late entries are quite welcome, as I probably should have said much earlier (possibly even in the original post).

            <p>&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve quite managed to capture the essence of that costume, Cali&quot; Miah said looking up and down Cali&#39;s Men in Black suit. <br><br>&quot;What? No way! I&#39;ve got this!&quot; Cali adjusted his grip on Helen&#39;s hand. The four-year-old was dressed as Deadpool in a princess tutu. It was Miah&#39;s idea.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s the blue hair that looks like it might be alive, dude.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Better than your costume. A psychopath? Really?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, they look just like everyone else, but underneath...&quot;<br><br>&quot;That has never been anything but a lame excuse for not dressing up and you know--Kyle, Kevin! No! No, slime pistols at the party!&quot; Cali left Helen with Miah and chased after the two boys, who were dressed as generic marines. <br><br>Hannah, who was on break from junior agent training, was dressed as Zoe from Firefly. &quot;Does he realize that those are just the decoys?&quot;<br><br>Miah shook her head and made shushing noises as Cali came back holding the water pistols. &quot;Seriously, where do they keep getting these things?&quot;<br><br>Miah put her most innocent look on her face. It didn&#39;t help that Ronan was on her shoulder looking supremely smug.<br><br>&quot;Oh. Of course.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, toots, we&#39;re here,&quot; Dinozo said before he and Magee disappeared into the crowd. They could be tracked by the loudly off-key singing of Irish pub music.<br><br>Miah shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t want to think about the trouble those two can get into when drunk.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, I see Florestan and Eusabius!&quot; He darted off to join them. <br><br>Miah handed new slime guns to the boys and reminded them to take defensible positions before sliming anyone. She left Ronan near the chocolate section of the buffet. Hannah drifted into the crowd leading Helen toward the nearest gathering of children.<br><br>Hauk Tauri, Lt Colonel Samantha Cater, and their hatchling mini-Unas trailed in behind. <br><br>&quot;Hey Unger,&quot; she said when she spotted the half-elf near the meat section of the buffet. She looked around, but didn&#39;t spot Kelok. <br><br>&quot;Get off of me, already!&quot; Cali shouted. Miah glanced at him. He was under a pile of minis. She shook her head. He couldn&#39;t go anywhere near a creature based mini without it glomping him. <br><br>Unger pointed to a gathering of agents in a corner. The sound of Magee and Dinozo singing &quot;Seven Drunken Nights&quot; could be heard from that direction. Miah rolled her eyes. A new sound stopped her mid-eyeroll. A baritone voice had joined them on the chorus. She looked at Unger who nodded. he was laughing so hard that he was holding his ribs.<br><br>&quot;You know he&#39;s going to kill you tomorrow, right?&quot;<br><br>Unger nodded, laughing too hard to speak.  <br><br></p>

            <p>Unger rubbed his arm, but beamed at the Viking. &quot;I gained three pounds!&quot;  He turned to Miah, &quot;This is Gall my team captain for AHQAIRQL. I&#39;m the water boy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is that a sneezing game?&quot; Miah asked. She pretended to not notice Kyle and Kevin climbing to the ceiling. They seemed o have a power to create climbable pipes, because she hadn&#39;t noticed the pipes before. Maybe a check of their glitter levels was in order. <br><br>&quot;Nope! Everybody gathers in a room or hallway and turns out the lights and beats each other with bats.

            <p>&quot;Come on Kelok. There&#39;ll be food. Real <i>food</i>,&quot; Unger said.

            <p>By the time Grace and Alex had made their way to the food table, Grace had already drank a cup and a half of deliciously spiked punch, and given her low tolerance for alcohol, was feeling rather good, a state of being that was compounded by the general air of drunken joy in the room. Admittedly, the mood was being spoiled a little by the Time Lady-driven drama on the other side of the room, but Grace ignored it in favor of getting some food into her. Alex was right by her side; he&#39;d abstained from the alcohol for the time being, not liking how it messed with his high-maintenance senses. He also wanted to make sure Grace didn&#39;t make a fool of herself, as empaths and alcohol really didn&#39;t mix very well.<br><br>Alex was perusing his choices when he felt the top of his left boot start to get suspiciously soggy. He looked down to find a mini-Hound of the Baskervilles sitting just underneath the table, panting happily as it looked up at him with hopeful eyes. &quot;Ah. Um, hi there,&quot; he said, moving his foot out of the way. &quot;Hey, Grace?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yep?&quot;<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s a glowing dog here, right? My senses aren&#39;t acting up on me, are they?&quot;<br><br>Grace peered down at Homles, tilting her head curiously. &quot;Nope. That&#39;s a dog. Look, even its drool glows. Cool.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wonder who it belongs to,&quot; Alex said, surreptitiously shaking off his boot before grabbing a small meat snack and carefully holding it out to Homles. He and Grace didn&#39;t keep any pets, mini or mundanes; they had yet to find one that was hypoallergenic.<br><br>&quot;No clue. Think we should ask around?&quot;<br><br>Alex shrugged. &quot;Maybe.&quot;</p>

Of course, sometimes when we&#39;re lucky, we can find amazing Victorian food in the fics. Kelok is always careful what he lets us eat though.

            <p>Cali didn&#39;t seem to be having any luck with getting the boys down, although they seemed to be running out of slime now that Miah wasn&#39;t supplying them with refills. <br><br>Suddenly one of the boys started chanting, &quot;Food fight! Food fight!&quot; The other quickly picked up the chant as well. A man walked by, rather covered with slime, carrying two small children, also slime covered, dressed as cookies.<br><br>Unger&#39;s look brightened. &quot;Food fight? I haven&#39;t gotten to be in one of those in years!&quot; He scrambled out from under the table, grabbed the first thing he found, which happened to be cherry tomatoes and started throwing them. His aim was good. He hit both of the boys, Cali, A man dressed in long red robes, and a DMS agent with a long braid. He ducked back down and looked for a table with stickier foods.<br><br>Homles stood up, stretched impressively and began slurping up green slime. He did a very impression of a vacuum cleaner--or maybe a mop, since he left a trail of slowly disappearing glowing drool everywhere he licked. <br><br>Cali had turned and scowled in Unger&#39;s direction, but had quickly went back to trying to get the boys down. The commotion had finally stopped the singing from the corner, in mid-chorus, of Wild Rover. Kelok staggered over to Cali, and nearly knocked the much smaller agent over when he threw an arm around Cali&#39;s shoulders. He looked up at the boys, and said, in his best Wraith &#39;command&#39; voice--the one backed up by psychic willpower--&quot;Down.&quot;<br><br>Both boys instantly scooted down the pipes. They stood in front of Cali and Kelok, looking guilty. <br><br>&quot;Apologize to the host and clean this mess up,&quot; Cali said. <br><br>Kevin looked up like he was going to argue. Kelok glared at him, and both boys scampered to find a mop and bucket. <br><br>Kelok smiled broadly, and clapped his hand on Cali&#39;s back. Cali stumbled forward, but managed to not fall. Kelok suddenly wrapped Cali in a bear hug. Cali was distinctly not looking happy.<br><br>Unger sighed. &quot;He really likes being close to someone, but he mostly won&#39;t, because of his home!fic. I think I should go rescue Cali. He&#39;s only human.&quot;<br><br>Before he could move though, Cali had managed to wriggle out of Kelok&#39;s grasp. Homles had worked his way over to Kelok, and now nudged his great glowing head against Kelok&#39;s leg. Between the mini-LEO&#39;s tugging on his coat and the mini-Hound pushing on his legs, they managed to get him back into the corner. The NCIS minis went back to singing, but Kelok sat quietly snuggling the mini-Hound.</p>

            <p>The DMS agent--at least, she certainly <i>looked</i> like Agent Dawn McKenna, albeit without a costume--shrieked in surprise, and began to frantically brush tomatoes off her clothes. She was joined in the frantic brushing by a young man dressed as Rassilon, who was loudly bemoaning the tomato that had gotten stuck to the top of his staff, just over the imitation white point star.<br><br>&quot;I mean, really!&quot; the latter exclaimed. &quot;Bad enough to throw tomatoes, but to cover the Staff of Rassilon with them? Even an imitation Staff of Rassilon? And what about the Robes of Rassilon, that&#39;s even worse! At least I didn&#39;t actually go and take his robes, then I&#39;d have dry-cleaning to deal with.&quot; He turned anxiously to Dawn. &quot;Does this show too much, do you think? Only, I don&#39;t think I can startle Time Lords with tomatoes all over my costume.&quot;<br><br>Dawn looked up at him, picking tomato seeds off her shoulder, and shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s not too noticeable,&quot; she offered. &quot;I mean, you might want to get a paper towel or something, but, um, other than that, you should be fine. Only--only you might want to dunk the staff in water or something.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Water, water.&quot; Abaddon looked around. &quot;I&#39;m not seeing any.&quot;<br><br>&quot;More&#39;s the pity,&quot; Dawn put in, wincing. &quot;At least we didn&#39;t get hit with slime, that&#39;s something.&quot;<br><br>&quot;True,&quot; Abaddon admitted. He glanced at Jacques, who was currently covered in green slime and carrying two children, also covered in slime, and shuddered. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I thought coming to a party would be a good idea. At least I didn&#39;t wear a tuxedo, those are definitely unlucky.&quot;<br><br>Dawn blinked at him several times, and then her eyes widened. &quot;Oh, of course! Right, you quote Ten a lot. I&#39;d forgotten. You, um, you&#39;re going by Abaddon just now, right? Hi. I&#39;m, uh, I&#39;m Dawn.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, I&#39;d noticed.&quot; Abaddon shook her hand anyway, grinning. &quot;You&#39;re T&#39;Zar&#39;s old partner.&quot;<br><br>This got him an eye roll. &quot;Old, yes, that&#39;s me. <i>Have</i> you found any Time Lords to terrorize yet? I should think the Reader would be an excellent target.&quot;<br><br>Abaddon blinked at her. &quot;You know the Reader?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, um--no, not really, not too well. One hears things, though.&quot; Dawn shifted uncomfortably. Abaddon eyed her sharply. He had even opened his mouth to begin a Rassilon-inspired interrogation, but then he caught sight of--<br><br>&quot;T&#39;Zar!&quot; He waved the arm without the staff excitedly. It wasn&#39;t every day he got to see his old partner--in costume, no less. Or was she in costume? It was difficult to tell from here, especially with a woman--was that her current partner?--in front of her. &quot;T&#39;Zar, over here!&quot;<br><br>--<br><br>Well, you gave me an opening, I&#39;m taking it. (Also, in a bit of unashamed fangirling, <i>I&#39;m rping with/talking to Miah!</i> This is so exciting.)<br><br>(...by which I mean that I&#39;ve read a bunch of your missions and really enjoyed them, but haven&#39;t spoken to you properly before, so now I&#39;m excited.

            <p>Unless this Alex from Floaters is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Alex_Warren">the same Alex from Floaters that we already have</a>(which is entirely possible, since Alex was only described here as &quot;wearing the robes of a Jedi&quot;, which would make for a complete costume when matched with existing-Alex&#39;s lightsaber, and Ugolino put the character out for grabs last time he was here in preparation for his other agent  getting a new anime-native partner), I don&#39;t know who either of them are, species and history-wise. Elaborate?<br><br>Linked to that, I&#39;m not certain what the &quot;empathic&quot; here means. Is it the standard ability to detect and be affected by emotions, low-grade telepathy, or the ability to shape and manipulate emotions? The &quot;empaths and alcohol don&#39;t mix&quot; lines imply that it might be the latter, since her drunken state and lack of mental inhibitions could be influenced by the same in everyone else, and her mind could magnify those and reflect them back on anyone nearby. That&#39;s a rare version of empathy, though, and it still wouldn&#39;t nail down what species Grace is.</p>

            <p>Okay, so, to answer your questions in order, with a small preface: These are entirely new characters I&#39;m playing around with before I debut them officially, so, no, this isn&#39;t the same Alex from Floaters that&#39;s already kicking around. They&#39;re both human, and from <a href="http://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Sentinel">The Sentinel</a> fandom, a sci-fi/buddy cop show (yes, you read that right) that aired right around the same time the <i>X-Files</i> did. <a href="http://fanlore.org/wiki/Sentinel_and_Guide">This</a> is a pretty good explanation of what I&#39;m playing around with with these two; Grace is the Guide and Alex the Sentinel.<br><br>As for Grace&#39;s empathy, it&#39;s the first definition you provided (I tend to call those &#39;receiving empaths&#39;, personally), though I&#39;ve seen some people write Guides as capable of all three. However, I didn&#39;t want to get too OP with her, so with the whole &#39;empaths and alcohol don&#39;t mix&#39; line, it&#39;s more that her normally relatively strong and cohesive mental &#39;shields&#39;/protections are weakened by said intoxicant and make her more susceptible to other peoples&#39; emotions.<br><br>Does that help?</p>

            <p>That article didn&#39;t really make it clear what the mechanics of Guides to Sentinels are, which just makes me wonder how the whole thing works. Does a Sentinel prompt empathic powers in his or her guide, or does a Guide create the heightened senses of his or her Sentinel, or do both exist normally, but are drawn to one another somehow? Can a Guide or a Sentinel operate independently of the other, or is the presence of both necessary to extract the true potential of either? And what would happen if one of these two was reassigned to a new partner? Could one of them imprint on the new partner, if said partner was human enough, and transform that person into a new Guide/Sentinel, or is it a bonding-for-life arrangement? And if it&#39;s the latter, what happens if one of them dies, or goes into a coma, or is forced to spend extended periods of time in another country/planet/dimension? What is the primary purpose of the Guide-to-Sentinel coupling, if there is one?</p>

            <p>Okay, so, Guides serve as baselines for Sentinels, as well as helping them consciously control their senses. Both Sentinels and Guides exist naturally (though, to be honest, now I&#39;m getting ideas for an artificially-created Sentinel and/or Guide to use in a fic... Hmm....)in their universe, particularly in the extended universe. They can operate independently of one another, though the Guide moreso than the Sentinel, as they don&#39;t have the issues with their senses spiking and drawing them into a zone out. Following up with the first question, no, one cannot induce someone to become a Sentinel/Guide if the potential is not there. Usually it&#39;s a bonding for life scenario, though if one of them dies, the other usually can find a compatible partner. And that&#39;s really what it&#39;s all about. I personally usually play it like there&#39;s a sliding scale of compatibility between Sentinels and Guides: Any Guide can help and potentially bond with any Sentinel, but there will always be someone who is potentially better suited to that Sentinel. In Alex and Grace&#39;s case, they&#39;re very well-suited towards one another, and have a deep platonic relationship with one another. Some Sentinel/Guide pairs do have sexual relationships, but like any couple, that&#39;s entirely up to them. </p>

            <p>How would one tell if a person had potential to become a Sentinel or a Guide? Is any well-prepared Guide capable of detecting Sentinel activity and vice versa, or is there a specific process or test necessary to determine the presence, polarity, and potency of Sentinel/Guide potential? Also, to elaborate on a question left over from last time, is there a specific purpose or reason for the presence of these powers in what seem to otherwise be baseline humans? Were they created deliberately to fight crime, or developed due to a genetic fluke, or kicked off by the presence of supernatural beings, or anything like that?</p>

            <p>To answer your last question first, in-canon explanation for Sentinels (the more intensive and planned out role of Guides is definitely an extended universe/fandom thing) is that they developed as protectors of tribes/villages way back when that sort of thing was needed. IIRC, there were actually only a few known Sentinels in canon, but most people tend to extrapolate and have Sentinels and Guides be pretty common. As for a test, it varies with each writer. Most assume that there&#39;s either some sort of genetic marker for it, or that a Sentinel and/or Guide can instinctively recognize one of their fellows. Potential is based purely on the individuals, much like it is with any team/duo working together. Some fit and some don&#39;t.</p>

            <p>Dark Lord Aakmal has just finished sweeping the floor of his textile shop when a old, fat orcwoman enters the shop.<br><br>&quot;Ah, Bilza, how&#39;s the food at Cafeteria?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Horrible, my lord.&quot; Her burp however suggests otherwise. She seems to be holding a decorated basket of goodies. And its contents are triangular-shaped pastries which Aakmal has never seen in his whole life.<br><br>&quot;And what&#39;s that you&#39;re holding?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah yes, my lord. This basket I found in our pantry. It&#39;s an invitation to celebrate... Purim, according to this card.&quot;<br><br>She walks in through the back door, thought Aakmal. &quot;Call everyone in the shop, Bilza. Let&#39;s share the treats. Let&#39;s head back to the pantry, my throat is itching for coffee anyways.&quot;<br><br>***<br><br>Aakmal, Gashnag, Bilza, and a few other orcs are seated around the table, the basket on it, and empty of the pastries, which are now being eaten slowly by everyone.<br><br>&quot;This biscuit is awesome, Thuglan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think it&#39;s a cake, Bilza.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thuglan, Look at it! It&#39;s so crunchy. Cakes are never crunchy!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, mine is chewy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is it, Gashnag? Let me some!&quot;<br><br>And soon all the orcs are entangled in a quarrel over whether the pastry is a cake or biscuit.

Let&#39;s meet back here in 15 minutes, with or without costumes, but preferably not naked. We&#39;ll close shop for today.&quot;<br><br>***<br><br>Everyone is dressed and ready for a party. Gashnag is rocking the Lady Gaga&#39;s Rita Repulsa dress, Bilza is sporting a British Safari costume, Tughlan decides to go minimalist and employs the Indian servant dress, holding an umbrella for his wife, Larslan is wearing the Batman costume, and Daughrad is trying to look like Justin Bieber.<br><br>Dark Lord Aakmal, the claimant of Arda, the Lord of Orcs under Bukit Kepayan, the nominal servant of Morgoth... is wearing a green Baju Melayu shirt with green-and-blue checkered sarong with a cheap belt.

            <p>Sйverine peeked around the corner of the door--the actual doorway, not the blown-in one.  After the large plant stuck in the top of the Kanak chieftain&#39;s headdress flopped down over her eyes, she adjusted the hat&#39;s flat, round part (mindful of the animal teeth ringing it) back to the top of her head.  &quot;<i>Oui</i>, here is this party, Yoof,&quot; she said.  She edged into the room, with her Mog partner following behind.<br><br>&quot;Ha!&quot;  Yoof barked, his voice muffled by a full-face Phantom of the Opera mask.  &quot;I smell them!  Tasty treats from that letter!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wish you had left one for me to taste,&quot; she replied, edging around dancing and chatting agents.  &quot;But no matter; party food is always decent.  Better than anything we have found for <i>la cantine</i> all week, I am sure.  Now, where are they--these cookie things you claim taste so good?&quot;<br><br>Yoof sniffed the air--it soundly exaggeratedly loud from inside the Erik mask.  &quot;Mmmmm . . . everywhere!  Find tables!&quot;<br><br>Sйverine tried to look over the heads around her, but she was too short.  &quot;They must be along the edges, Yoof.  Come, to the wall!&quot;  She took her partner by the hand and started leading him through the crowd.  Yoof continued sniffing, the sound drawing a few quizzical glances from the agents they passed.<br><br>&quot;All different things in the centers, ha!&quot; Yoof barked.  &quot;Cherries and chocolate and cheese and . . . and . . . and . . .&quot;<br><br>Sйverine waited for him to finish, then hesitantly filled in, &quot;Chicken?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Prunes!&quot;  Yoof finished.  &quot;Ha!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh.  That does sound more reasonable.  <i>Oui</i>.&quot;<br><br>The partners finally reached a table, covered in large platters that were themselves covered in triangular pastries folded over various colors of filling.<br><br>&quot;Ha!  Ha!&quot; Yoof barked as he grabbed one and tried to jam it into the closed mouth of his mask.<br><br>&quot;Not so loud, Yoof!  Do not draw attention.&quot;  Sйverine reached for one of the pastries with a dark-colored middle.  She placed one in her mouth and began chewing--then moaned even louder than Yoof had barked.<br><br>&quot;Oh, <i>la saveur</i> . . . what are these delicious things?&quot;</p>

            <p>A nearby agent named the food for Sйverine: hamantaschen.  [If anyone wants their agent to be the one answering in this scene, just let me know.]  &quot;They are so very delicious!&quot; Sйverine said, popping another into her mouth and licking the prune from her fingers.  As she chewed, she narrowed her eyes and glanced at the other agents near the table.  After she swallowed, she whispered to Yoof, &quot;And they will be even <i>more</i> delicious next to the food in the cafeteria.  Yoof, give me your cape.&quot;<br><br>Yoof whimpered quietly, looking over his shoulder.  &quot;Ha!  But, Sev, there&#39;s soooo many agents here!&quot;  The &quot;so&quot; came out a long, low whine.  Yoof had been particularly intimidated by a human man who had been looking at him intensely from the entrance, one also dressed in all black, but with a smaller, black mask and a bandana.  &quot;They&#39;ll see!  Ha!  We&#39;ll get caught!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Everyone is distracted, Yoof.  No one will notice.  And besides, you are already wearing a mask!  No one could recognize you.  Now, give me your cape.&quot;<br><br>Yoof whined quietly with a big frown hidden under his mask.  Still, he dutifully turned around so Sйverine could reach his all-black Phantom cape.  She took one corner in each hand and fluffed it out like a sheet, then moved both corners to her left hand.  She stepped closer to Yoof, giving the cape a shape like a pillowcase.  Then she started quickly emptying some of the platters of hamantaschen into the cape.<br><br>Yoof watched the nearby agents as she worked, eyes showing wide through the holes in his mask.  At Sйverine&#39;s urging, he moved further down the table to a set of still-full trays, Sйverine sticking close behind to keep the food from tumbling out . . .</p>

            <p>Hannah still had Helen by the hand. She had been leading the little girl toward the cookie-like desserts when she saw two agents beginning to dump them all into a sheet or cape. <br><br>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said to the less nervous looking one. &quot;Would you mind if I took some for princess Deadpool here before you take them all?&quot;<br><br><br>(Hannah is 13 now. Almost old enough to be an agent. Hard to believe. I think she&#39;s still more responsible than Agent Miah, though.)</p>

Of course!  That is, I was not--well.&quot;  She quickly scooped a handful of the hamantaschen back out of Yoof&#39;s cape and held them out towards the girls, not letting go of the cape&#39;s corners.  &quot;I was only moving them, you see.  To another table that did not have as many!&quot;  This technically wasn&#39;t a lie--Sйverine was just talking about tables that didn&#39;t happen to be in <i>this</i> room.<br><br>Nonetheless, Yoof was giving her an unhappy gaze from under his mask.</p>

It was some sort of Jewish holiday his family celebrated. Can&#39;t remember anything else, though.&quot;<br><br>Printworthy smiled, setting the note down lightly. &quot;Ah, a traditional holiday.

They have a special language they traditionally speak and write in. They follow the Old Testament, as well as some other texts...&quot; Marvin&#39;s eyes opened reluctantly, finally accepting defeat. &quot;That&#39;s bout it. I never learned much about the Jews. Sorry.&quot;<br><br>Printworthy batted his partner&#39;s apology away, his smile growing ever wider. &quot;No matter, no matter. We are all ignorant on a great many things. However, this does provide a marvelous opportunity to learn more about this culture. Besides, the missions have been wearing down on us. Some festivities would do us both well. Now,&quot; he said, turning towards the closet in the corner. &quot;what costumes shall we wear?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;And on that day, the PPC gathered, little knowing what--&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot;<br><br>The young man in red robes frowned at his companion, and then continued. &quot;Little knowing what would--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Stop it.&quot;<br><br>Abaddon scowled. &quot;Look, it&#39;s a costume party! Villains are allowed!&quot;<br><br>Bookworm, a blond boy with a fearsome (and constant) scowl who looked to be about thirteen years old, glared at him. &quot;Dressing up as Rassilon doesn&#39;t give you the right to narrate like he did!&quot;<br><br>Abaddon threw up his arms. As he bore a strong resemblance to Matt Smith, this had rather the effect of making him look like the Eleventh Doctor playing dress-up--which was, of course, what he was doing. &quot;Yes, it does! Look, if it bothers you that much, go find someone else to talk to! You can, I don&#39;t know, er--&quot; He paused. When he went on, it was in a quieter voice. &quot;Er, what did you dress up as, exactly?&quot;<br><br>Bookworm&#39;s scowl intensified. &quot;I&#39;m a Hetalia character.&quot;<br><br>Abaddon raised both eyebrows. &quot;Are you sure? Because you don&#39;t look any different--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shut up, <i>My Lord President</i>,&quot; Bookworm snapped. &quot;I&#39;m off. Just do me a favor and find some Time Lords to startle, will you?&quot; And with that, he disappeared into the crowd.<br><br>Considering this, Abaddon began to grin. &quot;Startling Time Lords. Sounds like fun.&quot; He straightened his back, raised the staff in his hand, and assumed a serious expression. &quot;This day, Gallifrey falls--or Gallifrey <i>rises</i>!&quot;<br><br>Seconds later, the serious expression broke and ran for cover as he started to chuckle.<br><br>&quot;Right,&quot; he murmured, still laughing. &quot;Time Lords, Time Lords...I wonder what they&#39;re dressed as?&quot;</p>

            <p>Two space marines could be seen sitting on the floor, eating with a red-feathered velociraptor, who had a distressing habit of spearing the appetizers with his long toeclaws. Although the sight of their saurian partner attacking his food with enthusiasm (and his feet) didn&#39;t bother Vid and Nemedra much, it certainly cleared some space around them. Plus, there were few even amongst the PPC who wanted to get between a hungry velociraptor, no matter how fluffy he was, and the snacks.<br><br>(Someday I swear I will properly write Vid, Nemedra, and Trask...

            <p>“Do you know what is the meaning of this?” the Librarian asked, holding a piece of paper between forefinger and thumb. It was brightly coloured, and a hamantaschen was hanging innocently from a piece of string tied to one of the corners.<br> Des looked up from the piece of paper he was currently scribbling on. He blinked twice, then got up and moved closer to where the Librarian was standing near the rifle closet in RC log e. He took the paper from his partner and read it. A grin tugged at the corners of his mouth.<br>“That’s an invitation to a Purim party,” the human Agent said and chuckled. He lifted a hand to forestall his partner’s forthcoming elitist protest and continued. “Purim’s a Jewish holiday, you wear costumes and are supposed to get drunk so badly that you can’t tell between Haman the bad guy and Mordechai the good guy.”<br>While Des paused and rubbed his goatee, the Librarian snorted disdainfully. “Surely you do not mean to go to that party,” he said. “I do remember you telling me that you detest parties.”<br>“Purim’s an exception,” Des informed him, still grinning. “Wearing costumes is fun. Plus, I’ve the perfect costume.”<br>“Do I look like I care?” asked the Librarian, demonstratively sitting down near his tablet again. He lifted his cup of tea — a custom he could not avoid adopting after so many days in Des’ company — and sipped from it.<br>“Well, if you don’t,” said Des in an offended tone, “I’ll just go by myself.”<br>“By all means, be my guest.”<br>                             **<br>And so it turned out that a while later, a somewhat-annoyed Des wearing a medico della peste mask, a black robe and a wide-brimmed black hat, marched into the room. He looked around, spotted the cake and the children, and went to the opposite side of the room. Settling comfortably in an armchair, he propped his head on his knuckles and looked at the door, waiting to see if anyone he knew — or anyone famous enough for him to have heard of them — to come through it.</p>

            <p>There was a <i>pop</i> of displaced air, and for a moment a tiny golden dragon hung in the centre of the room. A moment later, it disappeared again.<br><br>Some minutes later, the sound of drilling finally reached a peak. With a crash, a chunk of the generic surface wall fell inwards, and a tall, black-haired elf stepped over it.<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t believe they made a party this hard to find,&quot; he said, wiping the sweat from his forehead. &quot;Without Hera, we&#39;d never have gotten in.&quot;<br><br>Constance Illian-Sims stroked the head of the fire lizard on her shoulder. &quot;She&#39;s a clever one, my little queen,&quot; she said. &quot;All right, kids, come on. Don&#39;t loiter in the corridor.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Especially not when we&#39;ve just wrecked it,&quot; Dafydd chuckled as the Illian family trooped in. Tanfin, the eldest at seven years, was carrying Oleander, who was barely even one, and the three girls followed behind, five-year-old Jasmine leading Bella and Daphne by the hand. Once all five were through, Constance took a moment to look around.<br><br>&quot;Well, it certainly <i>seems</i> like a party,&quot; she said. &quot;What&#39;s it for, again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Purim&#39;,&quot; Dafydd supplied with a shrug. &quot;I figured you&#39;d know - it&#39;s your world.&quot;<br><br>Constance snorted. &quot;What, and you know everything about Arda?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, actually-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Daddy,&quot; said Tanfin in his serious voice.<br><br>&quot;Yes, Tanfin?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why didn&#39;t we use the door?&quot;<br><br>Dafydd and Constance looked where their son was pointing. Sure enough, across the room was a set of double doors standing invitingly open.<br><br>&quot;Well, Tanfin,&quot; Constance said, not bothering to hide her smirk, &quot;it&#39;s like this: your daddy is an idiot.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hang on, there!&quot; Dafydd exclaimed. &quot;You-&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Cake! Cake!</i>&quot; And the conversation ended abruptly as Bella noticed the hamantaschen.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>You said &#39;old agents&#39;; you said &#39;bring your kids&#39;; you said &#39;possibly pets&#39;. It was inevitable, really.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Here she is anyway! =oD<br>---<br>&quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re dragging me to another of these things. Have you forgotten what happened the last time?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh c&#39;mon, Agent Smokey Brie, it won&#39;t be so bad. It&#39;s Purim! A time of fun and laughter and bonding and way too much to drink!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And costumes? Why you made me wear this ridiculous rubber getup simply defeats me, like so many of your primitive species&#39;s backward customs...&quot; The Notary continued to grumble to herself on the way to the party, but Wobbles ignored it. Not ignoring it might have had a deleterious effect on her balance, a very bad thing indeed considering she was riding an overbuilt wooden pogo stick with heavily diluted Flubber on the mainspring.<br><br>It turned out to be not quite dilute enough, as she mistimed a bounce and felt her face impact with a Generic Surface lintel a few times before making her way through the double doors. The Notary just trudged through behind her and immediately went to look for alcoholic beverages to push past her face in quantities normally associated with hydroelectric dams, her spherical red costume&#39;s towering black headpiece only just scraping underneath.<br><br>Wobbles surreptitiously touched the underside of her red sponge nose, noticed that it wasn&#39;t damp, and dismounted with a thud. She then espied a motley gathering of children and bounced over to greet their parents, blowing up a few balloon sculptures along the way.<br><br>&quot;Hiya! I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve met, I&#39;m new, but this time I don&#39;t think it&#39;s because my partner&#39;s old house broke the fabric of the space/time continuum, so that&#39;s good. Here, have a balloon grager. And you, champ,&quot; here she bent down to Tanfin and swiftly tied a string around his wrist, &quot;can have a balloon Gwaihir Wind-Lord! Don&#39;t let him near a balloon Frodo, or the Internet gets mad for really dumb reasons.&quot;<br>---<br>For those playing along at home, yes, Wobbles did manage to con the Notary into dressing up as a douche bag.

            <p>Where there&#39;s property damage there is a DIA agent. <br><br>Or two, in this case. From the hallway, Patrol Officer Fire Flash and Special Response Officer Naya&#39;Keegan examined the damage.<br><br>&quot;Did they not see the door?&quot; wondered Naya aloud as she photographed the hole with her Omni-tool. &quot;Good grief. Building Maintenance is not going to like this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still don&#39;t know why we&#39;re standing out <i>here</i> when we could be in <i>there</i>,&quot; grumbled the Earth pony. &quot;Naya, I admire your sense of duty off the clock but there&#39;s, like, limits to overtime. We were on our way to check out the party <i>right there</i> but noooooo, you want to investigate this. Can&#39;t we just leave this to the next patrol team to deal with? I wanna at least eat something from the tables over there. Aren&#39;t you hungry too? I mean come on, you have to be hungry after spending all afternoon chasing that little Slorp thing through the Cafeteria freezers. Nice shot with the Carnifex, by the way.&quot;<br><br>The quarian glanced down at her diminutive friend through her teal-tinted visor. &quot;Er... You&#39;re forgetting I can&#39;t eat any of this stuff, Flashie. Firstly, it&#39;s not dextro-amino based food: I can actually die if I eat any of this stuff. Secondly,&quot; she pinched the arm of her full-body environmental suit with a three-fingered hand, &quot;there&#39;s bacteria everywhere. My immune system can&#39;t handle that just yet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What? I thought Terabyte was helping you with that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, no. Don&#39;t get me wrong, TB is helping a lot, but I&#39;ll <i>maybe</i> be able to live without breathing filtered air <i>in ten years</i>. Now... hmm. Actually, if you can go and find out who made this mess, that&#39;d be great. You can have a bite while you&#39;re at it too. Just get me a name and department before I send this email to D-Ops.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You telling me to get in there? That&#39;s fine with me!&quot; said the yellow pony as she hopped over the debris. &quot;This might take, like, five or six hours. Just saying.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The faster you get me a name, the faster we can get over this,&quot; replied Naya. &quot;I gotta start putting up the safety cordon over here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The faster I give you a name, the faster D-Ops will show up and shut this party down! I&#39;ll take my time,&quot; said Fire Flash. &quot;Besides, you said you wanted to get out more, right? Then get your flank in here and enjoy yourself!&quot;<br><br>Naya rolled her eyes at Fire Flash-- not that the latter could see it behind the visor-- and sighed. &quot;Fine. Just let me finish up here. This wall doesn&#39;t look like it might collapse anyways. I guess it can wait.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I knew you&#39;d see the light! Have fun with that.&quot; Fire Flash grinned in contentment and slowly weaved her way though the crowd. She would still have to find the responsible party for the report, though. Might as well talk to the closest party-goer. Recognizing one of the agents disguised as something that was a essentially an obscene metaphor, the DIA officer approached the drinks table and looked up at the Notary, mustering as much dignity as a metre-tall pony in plate armour can have.  <br><br>&quot;Hey, you. Yeah, you, giant dou-- squeeze bottle. Internal Affairs. I need to ask you several questions about that wall over there.&quot;<br><br>- - - <br><br>I&#39;ve always wondered what the Notary would do when confronted by a small cartoon animal. She&#39;ll probably insult it somehow, but I&#39;m waiting to see how this pans out.</p>

            <p>What with them having a few MLP fics to deal with in their queue.<br>---<br>&quot;Oh, joy. You want to talk to my part... ner...&quot; The Notary, originally facing away from Fire Flash, spun on her heel and looked into empty space. The constraints of her costume meant that she couldn&#39;t look down easily, so she had to shuffle around quite a bit before coming face to face with a tiny barded horse.<br><br>&quot;Are you a mini of some description? I cannot claim to recognise the canon, nor would I care to make a guess as to why the most dangerous creature in that particular continuum is a small pastel donkey in the remains of a tin bathtub, but I congratulate you on your grasp of spoken language, if not your manners.

            <p>It took a few seconds For Fire flash to understand to whom she was talking to.

I&#39;l bite, but I gotta feeling that you&#39;re not even listening to me any more. <br><br>&quot;Firstly, does it even matter if I&#39;m a mini? I&#39;m asking about the wall over there, dingus, not what species I am. Secondly, be polite and answer questions when I talk to you. I thought Time Lords were supposed to be civilized and stuff. Thirdly, you&#39;re absolutely right. I <i>am</i> dangerous. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been placed in the DIA: so that I can protect people by being a danger to threats.&quot;<br><br>Fire Flash paused for a second. &quot;Okay, that last line was kinda stupid-sounding, but you get the point. Oh yeah, one other thing...&quot; The smile on the Earth pony&#39;s features turned into a maniacal shit-eating grin. &quot;Speaking of fighting threats, I find it really funny that you&#39;re questioning my abilities. After all, didn&#39;t you <i>betray</i> your entire species by running from the Time War? You ain&#39;t nothing but a coward hiding behind insults, doublethinking your way  though life so you feel better about yourself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I digress. We were talking about the broken wall, right?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;You really believe you are an agent, don&#39;t you? You, a small, cud-chewing, rather ugly quadruped that looks like it&#39;s been dragged through a scrapyard and dressed in whatever stuck, are genuinely under the impression that you are an agent. Moreover, one that thinks it&#39;s in some way intimidating.&quot;<br><br>The Notary prided herself on being a rational and objective woman. Logically, she thought, Internal Affairs agents would be Time Lords themselves, since they were the only species suitable for such high office. Barring a regeneration gone quite amazingly wrong - which seemed unlikely, given what it had said about her people&#39;s culture - there was no way the squat, lumpen mammal in front of her was of that noble stock. That it had accused her of being an exile, something anathema to her and therefore something she could not <i>possibly</i> be, was the final nail in the coffin. The horse was not a Time Lord, therefore it was not an employee of PPC Internal Affairs. Therefore, there was only one course of action.<br><br>It started slowly, like the more pernicious earthquakes. There were small hissing noises, closely followed by the strange rasping sound of air escaping through a grin. The Notary then erupted with laughter - not the snide and sneering notes that left her mouth whenever Wobbles said something particularly ridiculous, but a full-on belly laugh. It was not a pleasant laugh. It wasn&#39;t a noise living things generally made unless they&#39;d been summoned by the Necronomicon. On Gallifrey, it had been known to make dogs sprint in the opposite direction and boil goldfish in their tank. The Notary kept on laughing until tears were rolling down her face. She collapsed onto her back and rolled off into the middle distance.<br><br>It could quite reasonably be pointed out that the Notary had been drinking, as evidenced by the abandoned Solo cups littering her little enclave by the drinks table. Most agents elected to fill theirs up with beer; she, on the other hand, had filled hers with the highest-ABV vodka she&#39;d been able to find. There were about six, though in fairness one was still half full.<br><br>Wobbles considered going over to defuse the situation, but she was happy that the Notary was having a nice time, so she left her to it.</p>

            <p>...this particular kind of laughter was not what she was expecting. The entire party stopped for a moment to watch the Notary, tears streaming down her face and still wailing with laughter, roll away from Fire Flash. The pony felt the eyes of everyone in the room converge on her and felt her mild irritation at the Notary be replaced by a overwhelming wave of self-consciousness. The mare stuttered out something unintelligible and slowly backed away from the Time Lady, ears pressed to the sides of her head.<br><br>Fortunately, Naya came to the rescue by diverting the crowd&#39;s attention away from her friend. The quarian quickly made her way to the Notary&#39;s side, theatrically keyed in a string of commands into her Omni-tool, and held the glowing instrument above the Gallifreyan. &quot;Ah, I see. Elevated levels of alcohol in the bloodstream. That&#39;s nothing a bit of chemistry can&#39;t fix. Terabyte, please consult Medical&#39;s databanks for Time Lord biology and advise me on the correct dose of Purple Stuff.&quot;<br><br>Naya pulled a vial of the aptly named Purple Stuff from a pouch on the webbing she wore over her bodysuit and popped the lid with her thumb. She then placed a finger on the side of her helmet where her ear would be, as if she was receiving a radio transmission. &quot;All of it? Thank you, TB.&quot; The Special Response officer tipped the contents of the vial into the Notary&#39;s wide-open mouth. &quot;There you go, miss, all better now. Just watch your drinking habits: it&#39;d be a shame if you had to force a regeneration to fix a liver! Now, I think my friend was trying to ask you what you knew about that wall over there.&quot;<br><br>During Naya&#39;s intervention, Fire Flash had slunk towards the back of the room, trying to avoid eye contact with the other guests.<br><br>- - -<br><br><a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Quarian">Quarians on the Mass Effect Wiki</a> should you need any more information. </p>

            <p>&quot;Well, this is the spot it says on the note. I think. The room number is all in yellow ink. What bright sun had the idea to put yellow ink on white paper, anyway? Can&#39;t even see it in this lighting.&quot; The Dersite dressed as the Sixth Doctor squinted at the note in his hands as he and an eight-foot clockwork golem dressed as the potpourri from his closet neared the Purim room. The latter had not yet managed to convince the former that Purim was not, in fact, a person.<br><br>&quot;Well, by the increase in ambient sound, I&#39;d say it&#39;s either here or very close to here.&quot; Copernicus confirmed, scanning the halls for any brightly colored signs. His experience of parties through popular culture had taught him that any party worth its weight in salt had colorful signs or balloons of some sort hanging by the door, lest the intended guests get lost and end up several blocks away, taking any presents or contributions to the potluck with them. To his disappointment, the &quot;Party This Way!&quot; sign he saw hanging on a nearby wall was only one color, and there were no balloons surrounding it of any sort.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re not even inside yet, and already the planners are exposing the height of irresponsibility,&quot; he complained.<br><br>&quot;Oh, come on, Nick,&quot; his partner replied, adjusting his floppy blond wig so that it was no longer in immediate danger of falling off. &quot;You aren&#39;t going to be carrying this attitude around all night, are you? Birthdays are a rare and special occasion, and birthdays in which strangers are allowed to come in and eat all of the hors d&#39;oeuvres are even rarer!&quot; He pronounced the French term &#39;horse deVorrs&#39;. &quot;You don&#39;t want Purim not to invite us back!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lonny, I&#39;ve told you, I am almost certain that this is not a birthday party. The message you found did not denote birth-related celebrations at any point, and I am relatively sure that it corresponds with the World One festival derived from ancient Persian-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ooh, look, second door!&quot; Lonny exclaimed, noticing a large irregular hole in the wall and leaping through it with a hearty &quot;Woop!&quot; He turned back to his partner, a large grin spreading across his face. &quot;Hey Nick, come in this way! There&#39;s something going on over there! He gestured over to somewhere left of center, where a Time Lady was currently emitting horrendous peals of off-key laughter.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not certain I want to be involved in that,&quot; Copernicus replied, as the Time Lady fell to the ground and rolled around the floor.<br><br>&quot;Oh, Nick. It&#39;s not a party unless someone gets humiliated! It&#39;s one of those integral parts every celebration needs, like streamers or bean dip!&quot; Lonny held his hands to his head. &quot;Dang it, you&#39;ve got me saying words like &#39;integral&#39; now. Are you coming in or not?&quot;<br><br>Copernicus briefly sized up the hole, compared it to his most likely and comfortable body positions, cross-referenced it with his size comparison, and performed the ever-necessary &#39;what happens if I get stuck&#39; check. He shook his head. &quot;I think I&#39;ll go around.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your loss, man.&quot; As his partner clanked away to the next accessible door, Lonny surveyed the party, and as he counted the number of guests and roughly judged their distribution, leaned up against a table to do so. This turned out to be a bad decision.<br><br>The Dersite stumbled and flailed as the cheap material shifted under his weight, and as he regained his balance, he grabbed a handful of tiny sausages with his flailing arm in a desperate attempt to make his near-fall look deliberate. Frantically, Lonny scanned the crowd again, noting with relief that no one seemed to have noticed his mishap, since the only person that he could tell had begun to look at him oddly was what appeared to be a velociraptor sitting on a table a few feet over. <i>Nailed it.</i> he thought, allowing his sausage-bearing hand a few congratulatory dunks into the nearby bowl of bean dip.<br><br><i>I don&#39;t know why Nick thought it wasn&#39;t a birthday party,</i> he continued, placing a bean-dip coated refreshments in his mouth and finding himself pleased by the taste. <i>There&#39;s a clown</i> and <i> a ninja here. If it was just a ninja, sure, it&#39;s a costume party, ninjas happen. But a ninja and a clown, together? Totally a birthday party.</i> Glancing at a small boy attempting to untie a balloon bird from his wrist, he added <i>Clown&#39;s even making balloon animals. I want one! Wonder if she does basilisks?</i><br>-------<br>Copernicus entered through the main door just in time to see a quarian confronting the oddly-dressed Time Lady, presumably about her raucous laughter and unsanitary floor-rolling. Copernicus nodded in appreciation while slowly edging around the fringe of the party, trying his best not to be too noticeable and hoping his hardest that his enormous size and bronze gears wouldn&#39;t make those attempts a waste of effort.<br><br>He didn&#39;t spot anyone he knew, which wasn&#39;t too big a surprise, as he didn&#39;t know many people. Lonny was right, for once. If he was going to gain new cultural knowledge, he&#39;d have to find someone else to talk to. The social clusters were a little too much, since interacting with one person would necessitate interaction with the whole cluster, and he doubted that he&#39;d be able to prepare for that level of unpredictability. As he glanced at each party guest in turn, a brief glimmer of recognition passed through his mind as he focused on yellow pony. Where did he remember her from? As soon as he acknowledged the question, he remembered. Back in New Caledonia, on the day of the unfortunate cotton-candy machine incident, she&#39;d been one of the DIA Agents who&#39;d dealt with the shapeshifting Stu. Fire Flash, he remembered hearing her called. Now, though, she had her ears curled against her head and was wearing a facial expression that could have been either sadness, disgust, or shame. He&#39;d always had trouble telling those apart.<br><br><i>All right, Copernicus,</i> he thought to himself. <i>This is an opportunity for social interaction. You share mutual experiences, and can start a conversation based on those, focused around the matter of improving her emotional state. But the matter remains: how? Physical contact won&#39;t work, because it might be interpreted as intrusion, and neither I nor earth ponies are telepathic, so that leaves... verbal communication. Curses. Maybe I&#39;ll start with the basics. &#39;It&#39;s okay to be upset&#39;, &#39;It wasn&#39;t your fault&#39;, and related. I&#39;ll save the specifics once I find out more details. Wait, will those even work? I&#39;m not sure why she is upset, so it&#39;s possible that-</i><br><br>His musings were interrupted when a blue unicorn that Copernicus had noticed closer to the party&#39;s central cluster moved to Fire Flash and effortlessly began emotional interaction with her. Copernicus released a small sigh of relief, careful to ensure that it wouldn&#39;t come out of his vocal vents too loudly. <i>Oh, good. I can just watch.</i> As subtly as possible, he began to move between the two ponies and the crowd beyond. It would be important to watch the ponies for any noteworthy development, but they&#39;d need some space. Solitude in these matters would be very important.<br><br>((Man, everyone is talking about that hole in the wall. It certainly is this RP&#39;s breakout character, if you&#39;ll pardon the pun. I look forward to its eventual development of sapience and assignment to a little-known Department.))</p>

            <p>Emiran watched Fire Flash converse with a dark blue unicorn of similar height and cartoonishness. <i>Ah, excellent.

Oh, and d&#39;you mind if I ask you a few questions about yourself while I&#39;m at it?&quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>Yes, I know that the laser screwdriver has a rather negative reputation in New Who, but I like to think of it as a tool often used by Time Lord engineers: it can weld things together, scan structures, emit light of various wavelengths from radio to gamma, microwave dinners, blast flies out of the air, be used as a laser pointer, and more. </p>

            <p>That would be ridiculous. No one would spend time and effort making a device only to have it be a &quot;more evil&quot; version of an existing technology unless they&#39;re Decepticons, or COBRA Command, or a Power Rangers enemy, or... a lot of people, actually. But not the Time Lords. Altering a device so that it can have temporal properties, however? Of course they would! Any excuse to put &quot;Time&quot; in the name of their new technology! Actually, due to my interpretation of the typo that created him, Copernicus is temporally sensitive, in that he can detect distortions or alterations in time&#39;s natural flow.(You can imagine his discomfort when he goes into a continuum without fixed or logical time rules, like Timecop.) Time Lord technology should have a field day with that.<br>----<br>One can learn a lot in a short few minutes if one is looking to do so, and Copernicus had absorbed a number of interesting facts from Printworthy and Fire Flash&#39;s conversation. <i>Interesting.</i> he thought. <i>I wonder if her immediate and unprompted relation of personal history was based on the presence of someone of her own kind that she recognized as such, due to the fact that she was being supported and comforted during a period of emotional instability, or perhaps a combination of the two. If I had been the one to attempt to comfort her, would he have responded similarly? I doubt it. I would hardly be as effortless in the execution as Printworthy was, and might have produced adverse emotional effects if my assistance was seen to be forced.</i><br><br>He was shaken out of his contemplative state by a Time Lord waving a thin white device in front of him, complimenting him and asking if Copernicus was willing to be scanned by the small device. Copernicus looked back and forth, somewhat flustered by the sudden attention.<br><br>&quot;I... I suppose so. Thank you, I wouldn&#39;t mind the questions, and do I, um, need to stand in a particular position in order for your device to work? He held out his arms from his sides at a forty-five degree angle, demonstrating a position he&#39;d seen used for checkups at Medical during scheduled maintenance, and all the while glancing from side to side to make sure that no one was running the risk of walking into his elbows. He instantly became aware of how large he was in comparison to everyone else, and how difficult it would be for people to move around him if he was to be standing still for an extended period of time. &quot;Should we... should we do this outside? I wouldn&#39;t want to bother anyone.&quot;</p>

            <p>Emiran pointed the laser screwdriver at Copernicus and did quick up-and-down motions with his arm while waking around the golem. &quot;The laser works a lot faster than the sonic. Some say sonic beats laser, but I&#39;m a sucker for this thing. Granted, you can&#39;t accidentally irradiate yourself with alpha-meson particles with a sonic-- that actually happened to me once during the War--  but it&#39;s a fine tool if you can set it up correctly. Aaaaaaand here we go, scan complete. You can put your arms down, sir-- or ma&#39;am. I don&#39;t know: which do you want to be called? Don&#39;t want to be rude or anyth-- <i>ooooooohh</i>... now that&#39;s pretty cool.&quot; The Time Lord held his tool next to his ear, listening to the scan report over the psychic interface. <br><br>&quot;You&#39;re time-sensitive? I was curious before, but now you have my attention. Is that a feature or a unfortunate side effect of some sort? Speaking of features, what&#39;s your power source? I&#39;m getting these weird readings off your core and I&#39;m getting sidetracked again, aren&#39;t I? In the future, feel free to tell me to shut up. I have a nasty habit of going off on tangents like his one!<br><br>&quot;Ahem. From the top! Hello, I&#39;m Emiranlanoamar, but everyone just calls me &#39;Guardsman&#39;. I was just coming &#39;round to check up on my friend over there but since she&#39;s doing all right, I figured I should let her be. Then I noticed you over here and we&#39;re now having this rather one-sided conversation. So! Forget all what I said beforehand and let&#39;s have a proper conversation like civilized people.

            <p>Sorry for the massively long wait. There&#39;s been a lot going on this week.<br>-------<br>Copernicus shook his head. &quot;I don&#39;t mind the tangent or the one-sidedness, believe me. I occasionally lapse into monologues myself, and even if I disliked the habit of sidetracking in conversation originally, my partner&#39;s speech patterns would have gotten me used to it months ago.&quot;<br><br>While considering the other points that the other Agent had brought up, he arched his eye ridges, the closest a being with as few facial features as he did could get to a furrowed brow. &quot;Regarding my origins, well, I...&quot; He brought his arms back in front of his chest, tapping his fingertips together nervously. &quot;I really prefer not to talk about it. I wasn&#39;t created with temporal sensitivity in mind, because in actuality I wasn&#39;t supposed to be created at all. I am what is officially termed, at least given my understanding of the terminology, that is, as a mishap, so, um, I really don&#39;t have the best understanding of my power source, because since there&#39;s little frame of reference, figuring out its details would require dismantling me, a procedure that I am understandably cautious about undertaking.&quot;<br><br>Copernicus immediately felt guilty for providing so little information. The other agent had seemed so enthusiastic, and Copernicus didn&#39;t want to finish the conversation feeling that he&#39;d let someone down. &quot;However,&quot; he continued, lifting one arm away from his chest and facing his palm upward in a way he&#39;d seen used in situations like this, &quot;I have several facts telling me what it is <i>not</i>. I operate by clockwork, and the scans I&#39;ve undergone during maintenance show that I don&#39;t have separate operation categories in different areas of my body, so it won&#39;t be something that would require the exchange and circulation of fluid, though I suppose electrical power or kinetic magic might not be out of the question as an originator of motion. The latter is unlikely, as I don&#39;t exude magical radiation, but my... unusual beginnings might mean that something is involved that those who examine me simply cannot detect. In fact, I am not at all radioactive, so I doubt my motor is atomic in nature, either. I do know that I must enter a low-motion state for at least three hours a day, which may constitute some sort of recharge cycle or my equivalent of the traditional golem&#39;s time of mandatory rest. I prefer to spread the period out for the full period of a humanoid sleep cycle, though, since doing so allows me to remain conscious. I usually use the extra time to read.&quot;<br><br>Copernicus paused. &quot;And now I appear to have proven my earlier statement regarding my occasional monologues. I apologize for that.&quot; He considered whether he should answer the section about the strange energy readings the screwdriver had been picking up, but then realized to his chagrin that he had almost forgotten the most socially important parts of the other agent&#39;s conversation.<br><br>He put his arms back to his sides. &quot;Amending this, then. Conversation. Hello, Emiranlanoamar, or Guardsman, my name is Copernicus, I am a golem, and I am male. What exactly do civilized people most frequently talk about?&quot;<br><br>-------<br>Copernicus tends to talk a lot when he&#39;s nervous, or when he&#39;s confronted with potential awkward silence, or when he&#39;s become interested in something. This particular instance had shades of all three, though I suppose the awkward silence was chiefly metafictional in this case, so he wouldn&#39;t have been able to detect that part.</p>

            <p>Emiran twiddled with his laser screwdriver in his right hand, looking in the middle distance behind Copernicus. &quot;I mean, I spent most of my life at the Time Lord Academy, so you can sorta imagine what my day to day life must&#39;ve been like. It was always about tomorrow&#39;s assignments, trading gossip, trying to peek into your own future to see your test scores, and swallowing nutrition pills. Really boring, if you ask me. I intended to go into robotics when I left the Academy, but the Time War started literally the day after graduation. Long story short: I got drafted, I got killed, then I got resurrected during a time travel event, then I got killed again-- you get the picture. I have no idea what is &#39;civilized conversation&#39;. I just wanted to put it out there, yeah? It sounded like a good thing to say.&quot;<br><br>Emiran tucked his screwdriver back into his Inverness coat&#39;s inner pocket and smiled broadly as he looked at the golem. &quot;That doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t improvise something! We could talk about missions or Flowers or favourite continua or stuff. It seems to work for the other agents, so I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t be appropriate now. So... uh... &#39;verses. Now, I&#39;m not an Action Department agent, so my continuum knowledge is actually a bit spotty, but I enjoy both my home universe-- <i>Doctor Who</i>, that is-- and my partners&#39; continuum, <i>Mass Effect</i>. How about you?&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>&quot;In fact,&quot; Copernicus said, &quot;one of the reasons I came here was to see how people conducted such conversations in public settings. Perhaps we can help one another.&quot; He paused, thinking back through his list of known continua and wondering whether to respond with another list or to expand on the prompt given to him. He decided to be proactive and go with the latter. &quot;I&#39;m unfamiliar with most video game continua, unfortunately, so I only know of Mass Effect by word of mouth. I can&#39;t exactly operate a controller with any amount of skill, you see.&quot; He slowly rotated his large metal hands in emphasis. &quot;I might be able to play the games as such, but I wouldn&#39;t want to risk breaking off part of the controller. I am not certain how fragile they are. I&#39;ve been attempting to begin video game canon research with a Game Boy Advance, since I have been told Nintendo makes its systems to be practically indestructible.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have a great deal of experience in Doctor Who, though, in part because I recognize it as a powerful science fiction centerpiece that I should, as a multi-fandom agent, have plenty of experience with, and in part because, as I am a time-derived entity, people are going to make constant references to it in front of me and I want to be able to understand them. So far, my favorite Doctor has been the Seventh.&quot;<br><br>Copernicus&#39;s eyes glowed briefly brighter as he suddenly remembered something significant. &quot;Wait a moment. Were you involved in the Continuity Council event a few months ago? I heard that approximately all of the Time Lords in Headquarters contributed in some way, and if you were there, could you please explain to me what precisely happened? The details I have been overhearing are contradictory at best, and all that I know for certain is that at the end of it, we employed several more Daleks than previously, and that occurrences connected to it created temporal anomalies so severe that I checked myself into Medical. I had thought that whatever system allows my temporal sensing to operate had been overclocked, if you&#39;ll excuse the pun. I didn&#39;t think &#39;overloaded&#39; would be the proper term.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I&#39;ve never really been into the entire &#39;private club&#39; thing: it&#39;s often more trouble than it&#39;s worth. Case in point: the Council did... a thing? I dont know. Then the HQ Daleks tried to one-up them and the entire thing escalated to ridiculous proportions. Mind, I was in a fic during that event-- some ESAS team called in extra reinforcements to deal with a <i>Diablo</i>-verse Suvian-- and I still felt the HQ timeline go nuts.

            <p>Lonny paused as he sized up the new arrival beside him. The man(or presumably he was a man; if he <i>was</i> using a disguise generator, he could easily look like anything underneath) had seemed to recognize him, but with the disguise changing the other agent&#39;s voice and body structure, Lonny had no idea whether or not they&#39;d actually met before. He tried recollecting the name Ianto Jones, and found to his annoyance that it matched up with a Torchwood character rather than a fellow agent. Well, that was no reason not to respond. Maybe he&#39;d be able to sort this out later. Mentally thanking whichever gods were in close proximity that it had been his <i>left</i> hand that he&#39;d now stained with bean dip, he clasped the other agent&#39;s right hand in his own and shook.<br><br>&quot;Hi there! Name&#39;s Lonny. I&#39;m usually great with names and faces, but since I don&#39;t have either to go on, I&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t the foggiest idea who you are. Small price for an accurate costume, though. Good job with that.&quot; Discreetly wiping his left hand on the back of his coat, Lonny continued. &quot;Say, are there going to be any party games or something at some point, or did we come in too late for those? I don&#39;t want to brag, but I am a <i>boss</i> at the piсata.&quot; </p>

            <p>However, I highly doubt the real Ianto would be a fan of this one. I like it well enough, though; not that I&#39;ve seen much of it, but Colin Baker&#39;s remark about the best part of his costume being the fact that he didn&#39;t have to look at it makes me laugh.<br><br>--<br>The man laughed. &quot;I don&#39;t doubt it. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t really say I&#39;m all that sure; I&#39;ve asked around, but no one seems to know who organized this in the first place, much less what&#39;s going to be happening. On the other hand, this is the PPC: somehow I get the feeling that even if piсatas aren&#39;t traditional for this holiday, one will surface at some point anyway. I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve managed to find the food yet? I hear the cookies are great.&quot; He paused, lips pursing momentarily. &quot;Or do you actually like cookies? I don&#39;t remember seeing you or your partner eating, but, well, it <i>was</i> just that one mission. Sorry again about tempting the IO, by the way; I know I&#39;ve apologized before, but, well, that was a really stupid move, and I want you to know I&#39;d never do that nowadays.&quot;<br><br>--<br>Some more clues.

            <p>Well, I&#39;d known it was one of two people, and this post narrowed it down to one. It&#39;s just that Lonny wouldn&#39;t know. Even if he was well-acquainted with the person in question, he most likely wouldn&#39;t recognize them if they showed up next to him unannounced and without offering their name, while simultaneously looking and sounding completely different. We&#39;re not exactly dealing with Sherlock Holmes here.<br>-------<br>&quot;Found these,&quot; Lonny said, offering the disguised agent a bowl of tiny sausages. &quot;There might be a few other bowls around, too. In my experience, you never see these things alone. No baked goods yet, but I only just got here. Through that.&quot; He gestured at the hole in the wall, registering with surprise that its outside was now crisscrossed with urple cordon tape roughly an eighth of a second before the sight of the unnatural color made him visibly flinch.<br><br>&quot;Ow! Ow! The one time I don&#39;t bring my filtered shades.&quot; Rubbing at his eyes with the hand not currently holding the sausages, Lonny carefully positioned his back to the hole, muttering something vaguely discernible as &quot;Blasted aberrants, no idea how everyone else can look at &#39;em all day without needing new retinas.&quot;<br><br>Blinking, he glanced up at the other Agent, the mental shock of the urple having brought new information to his brain. &quot;Wait, I remember you now! From that mission where the Sue kept rebooting everything and making all those new bodies! Since you&#39;ve got the-&quot; he gestured vaguely to indicate the disguise &quot;-Torchwood, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re one of the two who came in later to help with that part.&quot; He paused. &quot;Wait, no, neither of them was tempting the Ironic Overpower, so that leaves... ohhhh. That&#39;s why you didn&#39;t come here dressed up.&quot; He grinned again. &quot;Because you&#39;d still look like John Barrowman underneath! Hi, Jacques!&quot;<br><br>Lonny stopped, lowering his voice to a whisper and looking around. &quot;Wait, should I be keeping that a secret, too? Are there people mistaking you for Jack Harkness and trying to deport you? Because if so, we can probably talk to the birthday girl about that. Anyone important enough to have a party this big organized in secret is important enough to show the DIA your papers. I can help in case of problems, if you want. You don&#39;t get recognized by Noir himself without being able to cook up a good cover story.&quot;<br><br>((Dang it, SeaTurtle! Why would you bring urple to a party? There are children and the photosensitive present! At least the horrible color will make fewer people look at the hole, which may have been the DIA&#39;s plan all along. Since Taldaris is the only one of your five who hasn&#39;t shown up yet, I suspect he&#39;s also the one behind this nefarious plot.))</p>

            <p>True, true. Disguise generators are good for that. (Who&#39;s Noir, by the way?)<br>--<br><br>Laughing, the man pulled a rather unlikely, squished jelly donut out of a pocket, and reached through it to push several buttons. Several seconds and a <i>prrrrrp!</i> later, the D.O.R.K.S. was a colorful child&#39;s rattle, and the Ianto Jones disguise was gone, leaving Agent Jacques Bonnefoy wearing almost the exact same suit, but with a blue-themed shirt and tie.<br><br>&quot;Red&#39;s not really my color,&quot; he explained, tucking the rattle away again. &quot;And no one&#39;s trying to deport me, don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; He clasped Lonny&#39;s shoulder briefly, grinning. &quot;Not that I don&#39;t appreciate your offer of help, of course, but, well, it&#39;s been nearly a year since you recruited me, and I&#39;m doing fine. I just wear a different uniform, make sure the ESAS patch is visible, and most people don&#39;t even make the mistake. If they do, I generally just start singing or speaking French at them.&quot; He winked, and then his brow furrowed. &quot;Uh, Lonny--this isn&#39;t a birthday party. You know that, right?&quot;</p>

            <p>After all, Edgar&#39;s not gotten any appearances aside from his non-canon role with your two Permission Request agents and the co-write with two other teams. This might have been you taking the opportunity to expand on him solo. We&#39;ve seen Brenda and Charlie, Dawn wouldn&#39;t have gone in a costume that would have made her unrecognizable, and Agen_<strong><em>t wouldn&#39;t have wanted to pick a disguise that leans toward an individual gender until zie&#39;d gotten closer to deciding zir own gender identity. Oddly, I always think of Agen</em></strong>_t as female when referring to her mentally, and I&#39;d initially typed this message using female pronouns. Maybe I&#39;m just not equipped for custom pronouns like xie, per, and zie, and default to female when there&#39;s nothing else available. Or maybe &quot;zie&quot; just sounds like &quot;she&quot;, and my mind&#39;s decided it would fill less headspace if she-based terms were used instead of having to memorize numerous unfamiliar conjugations.<br>Noir is short for Jack Noir, the Archagent of Derse. Lonny used to work for him in his home fansession, before the BRD came in to bust it down and recruit Lonny for helping out.<br>----<br>Lonny rotated his hand dismissively. &quot;Well, there&#39;s a clown, a ninja, balloon animals, gift baskets, cake, a mysterious figure who may or may not have organized the event against somebody&#39;s wishes, and both strangers and near-strangers invited and encouraged to hang out and eat snacks. Plus, I heard somebody mention it was an annual event when I walked in here, so that rules out a baby shower. It all adds up to birthday party for me. Maybe we can ask Purim when she shows up. It might be her PPC anniversary or something.&quot; He leaned back, trying to look as far back into the room as possible. &quot;She may already be here, actually. I don&#39;t see anyone the groups are clustering around, but she might just want her space. I can respect that. From what the cleanup crew told me, everyone wanted so hard to crowd the last guy who held a birthday-slash-anniversary party he had half of space-time crumpling up to get in his business. I&#39;m paraphrasing, of course.&quot;<br><br>Lonny had punctuated the &#39;slash&#39; by making a chopping motion in the air, and nearly dropped his bowl of tiny sausages doing so. He looked at the bowl as though he had forgotten it was there, set it back on the table, and turned back to face Agent Bonnefoy. &quot;Wow, almost a year, huh? Dang, it <i>has</i> been a while. What are you doing now? I heard you mention ESAS, so there&#39;s probably some shenanigans you can pass on from there. I love shenanigan stories.&quot;<br><br>((You didn&#39;t think I&#39;d let the Lonny-not-knowing-Purim-is-a-holiday joke drop that easily, did you? Besides, he legitimately would not know. Neither he nor his partner are World One-native or the sorts of people who would strike up conversations with other people about their holidays. It&#39;s actually a little surprising that Copernicus knows about it, but he probably found out about it in the Canon Libraray after trying to research an obscure pop-culture reference or something of the sort.))</p>

            <p>Oh, yeah? Interesting. Oddly enough, Edgar&#39;s actually got some bits and pieces being written for/with him, although of course none of that&#39;s really been seen yet...and I actually managed to completely forget that I&#39;d written in Brenda and Charlie. /sheepish look/ And you&#39;re quite right about Agen____t; for the most part, I think ze just goes for androgynous, unless there&#39;s really a need to do otherwise, and then I think ze just alternates? I have no idea. It hasn&#39;t really come up.<br><br>And, well, as for the Purim joke...I look forward to seeing where it goes. It&#39;s pretty funny.<br><br>And, of course, thanks for the heads-up. And, um, thanks for this sentence as well: &quot;If they stand there impassively chatting while green-apple slime rains down on them, it would just be no fun.&quot;<br><br>Because, of course, now I have to make sure I use that...even just a little.<br><br>--<br>&quot;Ooh, shenanigans?&quot; Jacques grinned, paused briefly to swipe at his shoulder, and then went on. &quot;Well, I&#39;m sure I can think of a few...&quot; He grimaced, wiped at his hair, and kept talking, now shaking his hand off to the side. &quot;Mind you, I <i>am</i> fairly sure Purim is a holiday, but...you never know!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Anyway, shenanigans. Well, I&#39;ve now done missions with Elves, missions with--hold on, sorry--&quot; He wiped off both sleeves, shook his hands mostly clean, and kept talking. &quot;Where was I--oh, right. Well, you know what ESAS missions are like--or do you?--well, there was this one time where this Sue just wouldn&#39;t die. I don&#39;t mean she was a Sue Lord--she just wouldn&#39;t die. I had to drop her into the Fiendfire in the Room of Requirement in the end, though it took quite a bit of seducing to actually <i>get</i> her there. And then of course there was the time when I ended up going after a Sue who made herself both a necromancer and the daughter of the Middle-earth version of gods. That was just about the most--oh, great. Excuse me.&quot;<br><br>He flashed Lonny a smile before he turned and walked several steps to the side, to where two children (both two years old, both dressed as hamantaschen) were sitting. One of them, a girl, had slipped in the green slime that had been raining  down on Jacques, while the other, a boy, was staring at his basket of slime-covered hamantaschen. As the ESAS agent approached, the two-year-old boy took a cookie from the basket and handed it to the girl. Jacques began to reach for it, but stopped when instead of eating the cookie the girl threw it in the general direction of two other children (these ones older) who had produced the green slime in the first place. As Jacques watched, the boy also began to throw the slime-covered hamantaschen.<br><br>Jacques chuckled. &quot;Having fun?&quot; he asked. He eyed the green slime on the floor for a moment before shrugging and kneeling in it. The suit was ruined anyway, although the tie was still--<br><br>A great glob of green slime hit Jacques square in the chest, completely covering the visible part of the blue tie. The former character replacement sighed, and lifted a hand to wipe it off.<br><br>Well, maybe part of the suit jacket was still salvageable--<br><br>At that point, the two-year-old girl in the hamantaschen costume scrambled to her feet and threw her arms around his neck, bringing even more slime with her. Jacques sighed and wrapped an arm around her in return, ducking his head to the side to avoid having an eye poked out by her sparkly tiara. &quot;Well, that&#39;s me answered,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you too, Seren. Where&#39;s Ruby? And your mother?&quot;<br><br>Seren shrugged, and began a long (and mostly incoherent) description of how she&#39;d been hit by slime. The boy, meanwhile, lost interest in throwing hamantaschen at the kids with the slime guns, and turned to Jacques as well. For a long moment, he simply stood and stared, the last hamantaschen clutched in his hand. Then...<br><br>&quot;<i>No</i>, Owain,&quot; Jacques said firmly, raising his free hand. Seren wriggled away, slipped in the slime, and sat down hard. Owain&#39;s head turned, as did Jacques&#39;; when Seren did nothing more than pout, they looked back at each other, blue eyes meeting blue. &quot;Now is <i>not</i> the time to throw things at me.&quot;<br><br>Owain pouted. &quot;But I <i>wanna</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know, and it looks fun, but I really don&#39;t feel like having things thrown at me right now.&quot;<br><br>Owain stamped his foot. &quot;I wanna throw it!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then throw it at a table or a wall, if you can find one. I&#39;m not your target today.&quot;<br><br>Owain scowled. Seren got to her feet, and scowled too, as Owain looked at her, considering.<br><br>&quot;If you throw it at me, I&#39;ll tell Mama,&quot; she threatened, and Owain&#39;s scowl became a pout again. Jacques did his best to hide a smile.<br><br>&quot;Either throw the cookie or put it down, Owain,&quot; he advised. &quot;And remember, Seren and I are out of bounds.&quot;<br><br>Owain pouted even more fiercely. About to put the hamantaschen back in the basket, he caught sight of something behind Jacques, and stopped. Raising his chubby hand, he threw the triangular cookie with all his might. Well, most of it, anyway. Jacques, too late to stop him, turned just in time to see the cookie sail past his own face and hit Lonny&#39;s leg.<br><br><i>Great</i>.<br><br>&quot;Owain Taliesin Sato, that is <i>not</i> a good thing to do,&quot; he scolded, scooping a two-year-old up in each arm as he stood. Owain kicked him lightly once before he hid his face in Jacques&#39; slime-covered shoulder; Seren grabbed his shirt collar in a death grip, and began to look around from her new vantage point. &quot;Lonny, hey, I&#39;m really sorry about this, he&#39;s--well, he&#39;s really got a thing for finding loopholes just now. Sorry.&quot; The side of his mouth quirked up in a smile. &quot;Let me make it up to you.&quot;<br><br>--<br>I...I don&#39;t know whether to apologize for the length or not. You tell me, I suppose. I thought I&#39;d bring in someone from my original list of people to be shot with slime guns, and somehow went from the agent dressed as Rassilon to the two-year-olds dressed as hamantaschen. And then...it snowballed. Rather a lot.<br><br>Both kids (and their older sister Ruby, who got a mention) were created in a badfic, and adopted by one of the agents who were sent to take it on in 2011 (the mission report is currently in progress). While Jacques was not the one who adopted them, he&#39;s recently been serving as an honorary uncle of sorts (for a good reason that I won&#39;t go into just now). As you can see, they&#39;re rather fond of him.<br><br>And yes, all three children have the surname Sato. And no, none of them are actually related to the <i>Torchwood</i> character with that surname, although it <i>was</i> chosen with her in mind.<br><br>Fun, isn&#39;t it? I wonder how the Bellisario kids will take having hamataschen thrown at them (if they even reach them, who knows, these are two-year-olds we&#39;re talking about). And, um, I hope you don&#39;t mind that Lonny got hit; if it&#39;s any consolation, I doubt it hurt much...or at all...<br><br>And now to end this before my note gets to be as long as the scene. At least none of the kids is named &#39;Purim&#39;; that would make for an interesting conversation...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Wait, there was something sticky on the hamatasch! Lonny&#39;s still not mad, but it&#39;s a little embarrassing that I forgot that. Oh, and there&#39;s no need to apologize for a lengthy scene. Even if it was a bad thing, which it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s not nearly as great an offense as the lengthy wait I put you through.<br>-------<br>Upon the light impact of the hamatasch, Lonny&#39;s leg twitched reflexively, not enough to move his foot off of the ground, but enough that the small baked good caught in a fold of his pants and slid evenly downward into the opening of his shoe. Frowning, Lonny scratched at the side of his foot, missing the entire short-lived food fight(or more accurately, two or three people throwing food at each other as a furry humanoid and a woman in a strange hat bolted in disproportionate terror) with all but his peripheral vision as he fished out the offending cookie. While he hadn&#39;t been so dedicated to the costume to track down candy-red shoes, his yellow-and-black pants now had a thin streak of green slime running down the side, which he tried to wipe off with a lone napkin that had been sitting under the sausage bowl as Jacques scolded the small child he was apparently supervising. When the slime wouldn&#39;t completely come out with scratching and wiping alone, Lonny looked up to see the ESAS agent walking toward him and apologizing.<br><br>&quot;Hey, it&#39;s fine.&quot; he replied, placing the slightly slime-stained napkin back on the table. &quot;Normally when there are people shouting &#39;Food fight!&#39; nearby, you&#39;d expect to see worse than this by the time it&#39;s over. Plus, I hadn&#39;t been planning to wear these pants again for a while. Shame about your suit, though.&quot;<br><br>He paused, glancing up at the pipes that had been the slime-shooters&#39; short-lived base. &quot;I missed most of the action, but did the people who shot those slime guns get mind-controlled into stepping down? I might&#39;ve misinterpreted something, but that&#39;s pretty awesome, if it&#39;s true.&quot;<br><br>He blinked, remembering something he&#39;d been told about human psychology, and appended &quot;Not that you should ever do something like that without permission and proper training, kids. Mind control is not something you take lightly.&quot; He glanced back and forth between the two children, attempting to cement his message through eye contact, but neither of the children would look at him. Either Lonny was more intimidating than he thought he was, or the kids were deliberately avoiding any sight of his coat. Lonny frowned for a few moments before glancing back up at Jacques.<br><br>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say no to that making up you mentioned, if you&#39;re still willing to do that. Or do I have to be offended by something to qualify for it? I&#39;m pretty sure I can find something to make me angry if that&#39;s the case.&quot; The last few lines were said with an ironic smile as Lonny placed his hands back in his coat pockets.<br><br>((I know what you&#39;re undoubtedly thinking, DawnFire; where&#39;s the Purim joke? Well, my answer is that even if I was able to wedge it into the dialogue, no joke is as effective if I force it in at every opportunity. Also, this is a good opportunity for it to go dormant for a while, which I choose to take.))</p>

            <p>Before you write your next entry, just in case you didn&#39;t read all of the posts beforehand, the two Bellisario kids are now shooting at Jacques with slime pistols. He doesn&#39;t appear to have been one of the agents on <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=256184">your list</a>, but your next entry should probably mention that event, unless you want my next entry to include Lonny pointing out to Jacques that there&#39;s green goo on his suit and making him aware of the issue. If they stand there impassively chatting while green-apple slime rains down on them, it would just be no fun.</p>

            <p>I plan to go into it a little more with a history interlude once I iron everything out and make this official. In all honesty, I had never heard of Dungeon Siege III until you mentioned it just now, and even after active Google searching, I can&#39;t find anything on their clockwork golems. I did get a few entries on clockwork golems from Pathfinder and a few MMORPGs, though.<br><br>Yeah, they&#39;ve undergone a bit of development since I first thought of them. Copernicus doesn&#39;t make gear puns any more, for example. He&#39;s actually kind of sensitive about his clockwork nature now, so it would be out of character for him to draw attention to it. Lonny&#39;s still pretty much the same, surface-wise, but I&#39;ve given him a few more major character traits so that he can operate better when he&#39;s not acting as a foil, and rearranged his history a couple of times. So the originals <i>would</i> be pretty AU at this point if I&#39;d written anything for them officially, especially since their modern counterparts may be operating out of a different Department.<br><br>DawnFire(humorously, autocorrect kept changing her name to AdveNture when I was writing this post, complete with the randomly capitalized N) might be remembering modern Lonny and Copernicus from their appearances in SeaTurtle&#39;s New Caledonia RP, which they sadly didn&#39;t get to do much in before the Board dropped it, or their main character roles in the mission I was cowriting with her and Lily Winterwood, before said mission was left in three-fourths-complete limbo for six months. I rewired a few details of backstory during the break, which I&#39;ve been meaning to talk to Lily about, since the changes involve their departmental assignment and would invalidate part of her dialogue.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s the right yellowish-bronze color, and it&#39;s got large hands like he does, but other than that, they&#39;re not very similar. Copernicus is broader and stockier, with visible gears near some of his joints and in parts of his torso, and a plated body topped with a circular flat area on the chest instead of the broken-up torso of the automaton. He&#39;s also got a squat, smooth head, with two lamplike eyes arranged in the usual fashion to the loss of any other typical facial features visible, rather than the automaton&#39;s three ambiguous green lights that could be either eyes, one eye and two miscellaneous parts, or two eyes and a mouth-indicator.<br><br>I know, you were just misremembering something, but I haven&#39;t gotten the opportunity to describe Copernicus in a while, and I wanted to use some more detail than just his basics. I may need someone to draw him at some point.<br><br>Also, is that automaton&#39;s head shaped so that it looks like there&#39;s a marching band hat on it, or is the gray area just a space between structures? Because if it is hat-shaped, that&#39;s pretty adorable. Robot marching band is best marching band.</p>

            <p>Aside from Blitzcrank&#39;s stumpy out-of-proportion legs, pipes, and really long arms, they could be part of the same species. Well, technically they are, because they&#39;re both golem subtypes, but saying all golems come from the same stock is like saying all robots do. How long has Blitzcrank been around? Maybe I can mention the similarity in my interlude on Copernicus&#39;s history.</p>

            <p>Copernicus&#39;s backstory involves him having been in the PPC for several years before Lonny was assigned as his partner, and the history interlude would take place shortly after his discovery and recruitment. I wouldn&#39;t want someone mentioning Blitzcrank if the character wasn&#39;t created until 2012 or something.<br><br>Copernicus is a clockwork golem, though, and Blitzcrank is a steam golem. I&#39;m no doctoral student, but I think that, despite similarities in their design, the mechanics powering them would be quite different. Regardless, it probably wouldn&#39;t be safe getting either within contact distance of Agent Wobbles. =)</p>

            <p>Marvin and Printworthy had only just entered the party when the laughter began. It rolled over the agent&#39;s ears, a carol of madness in a sea of revelry.

            <p>Fire Flash&#39;s head whipped around to face Printworthy, her green eyes slightly puffy and reddened.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not crying!&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s just-- I was-- ugh.&quot; She took a shaky breath, then exhaled sharply through her nostrils. &quot;No, it&#39;s okay, I&#39;m fine. S&#39;okay. No need to stare and hover &#39;round me like that like some big fat mother hen. Wait, that was rubbish. Sorry. Like I said, it&#39;s just...&quot; she looked at the spot where the Notary was lying on the ground, thankfully silent now. &quot;I&#39;m fine with insults.

            <p>Printworthy nodded lightly. &quot;You would be correct. I would be Printworthy, agent of the All Purpose Department for My Little Pony.&quot; He smiled kindly towards the earth pony. &quot;Department of Internal Affairs?

Whew! Luna&#39;s stars, I think the last time I was shaken up like that, I had just been recruited. Good times, yeah?&quot; Fire Flash let herself breathe for a few seconds before resuming the conversation. &quot;So... you were saying something about this old madhouse here? Yeah, it gets pretty nasty at times. Like, just last week one of our patrol teams stumbled upon this huge soma trafficking ring-- you know, that drug from <i>Brave New World</i>? Just goes to show you what happens when you leave a portal generator in the hands of a bunch of idiots.

            <p>...as he heard the tales from the DIA agent. &quot;My word. People actually did that? I cannot imagine what ever could have gotten into their heads, to think consuming soma was a good idea.&quot; He shook his head, sadly. &quot;Here I am, avoiding the consumption of bleeprin unless it is truly necessary, and other agents are smuggling in refined artificial joy. Unbelievable.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That Mansfield character does sound suspect. I suppose bit characters are blank slates for a Glitter Do -Oh, pardon me, Mary Sue- to project praise onto themselves, but shaping them into agents? It does sound sinister. I hope nothing all too bad comes from it though, either because of it&#39;s innocence of wrong-doing, or because you stop it before it can cause too much harm.<br><br>&quot;However, I am sidetracking. You wished to hear one of my stories?&quot; Printworthy put a hoof lightly to his chin, pondering which story would be best suited to tell her. Much as her mood was improving, she was still shaken by the laughter of the Time Lord. What tale would boost her confidence best, or at least provide some entertainment? <br><br>Eventually, a few choice tales came to his mind. &quot;I suppose I could tell about the day I became uncanon, by past rendered moot in one fell swoop. Of course, there is also the time I convinced the Marquis into admitting my partner and I into our chosen department, mere moments after falling into headquarters. I&#39;m unsure which one to elaborate om. Which tale would you like to hear?&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Man, I want Printworthy to get all mad and defensive of Earth ponies and ponykind in general, but I know he&#39;s much more subtle then that. Heck, I&#39;ve got a good rant and everything. However, his goal right now is to raise her spirits, and he&#39;s choosing to do so by subtly reassuring her that she&#39;s a good agent and a worthwhile agent. Man, why can&#39;t he be more blunt and forward with trying to comfort her? Gah!</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve just realised that Wobbles and quarians really, <i>really</i> don&#39;t mix.

            <p>...to introduce the last of my DIA agents. Meet Terabyte the geth and Emiran(lanoamar) the Time Lord.<br><br>- - - <br><br>As the Notary flopped away from her latest tongue-lashing victim, Naya noticed a clown approaching from the left. A series of warnings in Khelish flooded her visor&#39;s heads-up-display, all of them circling the woman as she closed the distance between her and the quarian.<br><font><font size="2"><br>&gt;TB: Subject: Agent Wobbles<br>&gt;TB: WARN: DRESDEN&#39;S SYNDROME<br>&gt;&gt; \Define{Dresden&#39;s Syndrome}<br>&gt;&gt; Subjects suffering from this rare genetic disorder cause all manner of technology failure by their mere presence or touch. Results are often spectacular, explosive, or spectacularly explosive. \<br>&gt;TB: Locking down suit seals in preparation for close proximity with Agent Wobbles. Activating emergency air supply. Power cut from all non-essential systems to avoid system overload.<br>&gt;TB: Uploading myself into HQ wireless. Scrubbing session from hardsuit memory drives to avoid file corruption.<br>&gt;TB: Regroup at Response Centre as fast as possible. I will activate my platform.<br>&gt;TB: Will warn the Guardsman.<br></font></font><br>Naya&#39;s HUD then went black as Terabyte the geth quickly extracted all of its core files from the quarian&#39;s suit computer and fled the incoming tech-destroying aura via Wi-Fi. The quarian gulped and put on a smile as Wobbles chatted and started to piece together a geographically correct model with balloons.<br><br>* * * <br><br>Emiranlanoamar stared at the mechanical body of a geth trooper on the workbench in front of him, then at his clipboard full of repair notes. He plucked his pencil from its perch behind his ear and scribbled a line of calculations beside a complicated-looking diagram. Satisfied with his arithmetic, he hung the clipboard on a nail in the wall in front of him and grabbed a laser screwdriver from his toolbox. <br><br>&quot;All righty then,&quot; he said to the inanimate shell as he slipped his welding goggles over his eyes, &quot;this should improve your energy efficiency by sevenish percent. Sure, It doesn&#39;t beat having some new power cells installed on this thing-- we really need to replace those-- but an extra twenty-odd seconds during an operation is nothing to sneeze at, eh? Now, let&#39;s open up this chest compartment and... there we go. Now, we&#39;re gonna fuse <i>this</i> circuit with <i>that</i> circuit... Good... Now come the wires... Reconfiguring the capacitor alignment...&quot;<br><br>The console [Bip!]ed during the middle of the last procedure. Without raising his eyes from his work, the Time Lord waved his laser screwdriver at the console to acknowledge the message. Terabyte&#39;s robotic voice sounded over the speaker system.<br><br>&quot;Guardsman. Naya&#39;s suit integrity has been compromised. She will require an immediate change of uniform. Please prepare the cleanroom and my platform. I shall assist her with suit removal if necessary.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, wait! No-no-no-no-no! The robot isn&#39;t ready! I&#39;m still working!&quot; said Emiran, stumbling over the cables and the half-disassembled electronics that littered the RC&#39;s floor towards a heavy set of doors. &quot;The battery unit is still exposed!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Remove the power cells and put me on umbilical power.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Oh for crying out loud, I&#39;m working on them!&quot; said Emiran as he heaved open the cleanroom door and used his laser screwdriver to program the washroom-sized space for a decontamination cycle. &quot;You&#39;re not giving me time to fix <i>anything</i>, you know that? It&#39;s always emergency this, emergency that, emergency all day and every day!&quot;<br><br>&quot;My apologies, but there is work to be done. Beginning upload now.&quot;<br><br>Emiran let out a frustrated growl as he quickly made his way back to the workbench and plugged a thick wire into a socket on the geth&#39;s neck section. The Time Lord then ran back to the cleanroom and plugged the other end of the cable in a plug inside the room. Terabyte&#39;s body started to buzz and twitch as servomotors and cooling fans turned on. Meanwhile, Emiran had rushed back to the workbench and disconnected the main battery from the geth platform, yanking out the power cells from their casings with his gloved hands.<br><br>A portal opened in the middle of the room, letting Naya through, RA in hand. She walked stiffly, as if her all of her suit&#39;s articulations had solidified.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong,&quot; said the quarian as she hobbled over to the cleanroom, &quot;Wobbles is a really nice lady. I mean, she got me a balloon replica of Rannoch, mountains and everything. I just think that we shouldn&#39;t be in the same room again.&quot;<br><br>Terabyte, who was now able to walk under its own power now, helped guide Naya to the decontamination chamber. &quot;Extent of suit damage?&quot; it asked. <br><br>&quot;I think that my Medi-Gel turned into custard and my servos are definitely frozen over,&quot; answered Naya. &quot;Nothing serious. My Omni-tool is completely shot though: Wobbles touched it when she tied the globe to my wrist. Oh yeah, Emiran?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye, miss?&quot;<br><br>Naya managed to toss her Remote Activator towards her partner. &quot;Can you go and check on Fire Flash for me? She was in a pretty bad state when I left her.&quot;<br><br>The Time Lord shrugged off his apron and his gloves and removed his goggles. &quot;Why? What happened to her?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She encountered the Notary. Anyways, just make sure she&#39;s OK! I&#39;ll be in Medical if you need me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure thing, partner. See you later,&quot; said Emiran, heading for his room. He threw his protective gear on his bed and grabbed his black Inverness coat from the hanger behind the door. The DIA officer quickly donned his coat and opened a portal to the last coordinates shown on the device. <br><br>Emiran stepped through the portal and found himself just outside the party room. Through the gaping hole in the wall beside him (&quot;What in Rassilon&#39;s name happened here?&quot;), the Time Lord thought he could spot Fire Flash&#39;s distinctive red-and-orange mane somewhere towards the back of the room. He ducked under the urple cordon tape that criss-crossed the hole and slowly started to make his way towards the pony, hoping not to bump into the Notary.</p>

            <p>Though if that&#39;s the case, he is officially the only Time Lord in HQ, and one of very few of his species in total, to use his own name before his title. Most Time Lords either don&#39;t have a title or don&#39;t use any version of their name, even a truncated form, if they do have one. It makes sense that Emiran decided to shorten his name when he chose to use it, though. I can&#39;t figure out how that last part would even be pronounced. Lan-OH-uh-MAR? Lan-WHUA-mar? La-NWA-mar? Nope, can&#39;t get a fix on it.</p>

            <p>After a few moments of dreaming, Des noticed trouble. Rather, he noticed a pair of people he vaguely remembered from somewhere. He tapped his nose a few times, trying to remember where he saw a clown and a haughty woman that sounded like an older version of Petra Fina; realising he met them in a birthday party in the Cafeteria about two months ago and that the Librarian pointed the now-douchebag-wearing woman as an obstructive bureaucrat, he wasn&#39;t surprised when she proceeded to address an MLPverse pony like he was some sort of animal.<br>The masked agent got up and looked around, searching the room for the clown. Spotting her at a different corner of the room, he briskly walked up to her. “Excuse me,” he said, his voice somewhat muffled by the mask, “you&#39;re, um, what&#39;s-her-name, the Notary, I think? Anyway, you&#39;re her partner, right?”</p>

            <p>Because, chronologically speaking, that would&#39;ve been over a year ago. The ten-years-of-PPC party took place in February 2013, and this would be about thirteen months after that. Wobbles and the Notary&#39;s presence at the Nume-bash was eventually pinned down to a malfunctioning time machine.<br><br>Unless, of course, you meant some other non-RP birthday party, perhaps for some of the Nursery kids, which is distinctly possible.

            <p>You aren&#39;t the only one to have made that mistake, though. There were at least three others, if I recall correctly. Like I said, you can just retcon this to Des showing up at a children&#39;s birthday party at some point, since you said &quot;birthday party&quot; rather than &quot;anniversary party&quot;. Wobbles would show up to plenty of birthday parties, and I&#39;m sure the Nursery staff would let semi-responsible Agents in to let them have free cake in exchange for chasing off any undesirables. Can&#39;t have Luxury or the Daleks traumatizing the impressionable children, you know! Not on their special day!</p>

            <p>Where there was likely to be a wild party, there you would find Gall Bonecrusher. Where you would find Gall Bonecrusher, you would find Derik, bound by some doom of responsibility that kindly looked the other way if he took the opportunity to tie one on.<br><br>Not having a wealth of costuming skill between them, they were simply reprising their Viking and Pirate getup from Halloween: Gall was kitted out in full armor from her home &#39;verse, though she&#39;d left her mace and shield in the RC, and she&#39;d streaked her face with blue warpaint inspired by a recent viewing of <i>Braveheart</i>. Derik was swathed in all black as the Dread Pirate Roberts. The mask was indeed very comfortable, and made him somewhat easier to look at than usual by virtue of hiding some of his scars and obscuring his blind right eye.<br><br>The two entered through the doors, though given the option they probably would have used the hole in the wall for sheer novelty.<br><br>Just inside, Gall planted her hands on her hips and surveyed the room skeptically. &quot;Well, this is it. We must be early; this place is dead.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not so sure,&quot; said Derik. He pointed across the room at the large hole in the wall.<br><br>Gall blinked. &quot;Aw, I hope we&#39;re not <i>late!</i> Jeez, that would just figure. First chance at real fun since the last Indoor Quiddich match, and we missed someone knocking a wall down!&quot; She kicked the floor. &quot;Screw it. Where&#39;s the alcohol?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hm.&quot; Derik scanned the room, then froze with a sharp intake of breath as two things caught his eye simultaneously. One was the Phantom of the Opera—a proper one with a full mask, even—and the other was a small golden dragonet fanning her wings on a dark-haired woman&#39;s shoulder. After a moment, Derik remembered to breathe again. &quot;Gall? I... changed my mind. I don&#39;t think I should be here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; She gave him the kind of side-eye that would be warranted by suddenly speaking in tongues.<br><br>&quot;I think I should go.&quot; He turned on his heel and started for the door, but a sharp tug at his waist stopped him.<br><br>Gall had seized him by the sash. &quot;Don&#39;t be stupid. You know you&#39;ll just sit and mope back in the response center. Come on, I found the drinks table. You&#39;re be fine once you&#39;ve got a few in you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let <i>go!</i>&quot; In a surge of anger, he batted her hand away. They glared at each other for a minute, then Derik sighed, and his head and shoulders drooped. &quot;Fine. Let&#39;s get very, very drunk.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excellent. Right this way!&quot; She cheerfully stomped into the crowd, careless of who she had to muscle out of her way in the noble and time-honored pursuit of booze.<br><br>Derik trudged after her wearily. He made up his mind to ignore the Phantom—it was just someone in a costume, after all—but his glance kept straying to the gold fire-lizard. It hurt to look at her, making him very much aware of the piece of himself that was missing, but... perhaps her Impressor was someone he could talk to. He had so little contact with anyone or anything of Pern, and despite never really having had a life there, he missed it. So he stopped, and turned, and approached the dark-haired woman.<br><br>&quot;Er... excuse me?&quot; he said softly.<br><br>(( Sorry for angsting up the party. I&#39;ll try to find some way to make up for it. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup> ))</p>

            <p>Constance ran quickly through the mental checklist she applied to any conversation with strangers.

The children were being entertained by a clown (well, the girls were - Tanfin looked distinctly dubious, and Oleander was more interested in Tanfin&#39;s eagle-shaped balloon), and Dafydd had found someone he recognised to go and... glower at or something.

            <p>Derik started to explain that he wasn&#39;t afraid of Hera, but the compliment on his costume threw him a curveball. &quot;Er, what? Oh—right.&quot; He glanced down and plucked awkwardly at the loose shirt. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br><br>He was stammering like an idiot. That had to stop. He took a deep breath and straightened up, attempting to smile. His expression was always at least half a grimace, so with the current roiling of his emotions, it didn&#39;t go well.

She&#39;s very beautiful, and it&#39;s not every day you meet someone lucky enough to hatch a gold egg. May I ask how you came by her?&quot;<br><br>With that desperation-tinged performance, he estimated that he had about two minutes before Constance realized there was something dreadfully wrong with him and made her excuses to leave. <i>Shards.</i></p>

            <p>Constance snorted as she shook Derik&#39;s hand. &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. When your husband is so obsessed that he portals you both to Pern&#39;s Southern Continent when there&#39;s, quote, &#39;no one around for two hundred years each way&#39;, and you spend the next three months staking out nests... well, it&#39;s like I said. Weight of numbers beats luck every time.&quot; She tossed her head, jolting Hera.<br><br>The fire-lizard hissed irritably, flapping her wings for balance, and Constance chuckled. &quot;I admit it, though - despite all the work, I was glad to meet my little queen. She&#39;s not just a pretty face, you know.&quot; Hera crooned softly in Constance&#39;s ear, and the woman reached up to stroke her under the chin. &quot;Yes, dear, but don&#39;t let it go to your head.&quot; She nodded at Derik. &quot;She&#39;s empathic, or telepathic, or one of those. Dafydd tells me the emotional feedback can have a stabilising effect, but he <i>may</i> have been talking rubbish again. It&#39;s hard to tell.&quot;<br><br>Constance paused a moment, eyeing the Silent Pirate Derik. &quot;Any time you want to get a word in edgeways, just ask.&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>&quot;Well, in fact...&quot; Derik forged ahead with the opportunity he&#39;d been given. It felt too forward, barging straight to the point, but he wasn&#39;t sure another chance would come before either she left or he went to pieces watching her interact with her little gold. &quot;The matter of it is, I&#39;m from Pern, and I was wondering if you were. Or your husband. As far as I&#39;ve known, it&#39;s just been me and Jenni from FicPsych, but her only sort of. It&#39;s complex.&quot; He waved it off. &quot;My point is, I&#39;d be very pleased to know any others.&quot;<br><br>He wasn&#39;t too sure, though, having listened to her talk. She didn&#39;t share his accent, and there was something else, a vague sense of disconnection. Still, he waited hopefully for her answer. The husband with egg fever sounded promising.</p>

            <p>&quot;Oh! Ah, no.&quot; Constance shrugged, forcing Hera to scrabble for grip. &quot;Just fans. Well, I say fan<i>s</i>... I&#39;ve only read a couple of the books. Dafydd was the one who really got into it.&quot; She pointed at her husband, where he was kneeling to deal with Belladonna&#39;s sudden flood of tears at the clown&#39;s departure. &quot;I&#39;m not sure why - you&#39;d think an elf would be <i>scared</i> of dragons.&quot;<br><br>Hera made an irritable noise and batted Constance&#39;s ear, and the woman chuckled. &quot;I know, I know - no-one could be scared of you and Ilwion, and if I say otherwise you&#39;ll bite my fingers off.&quot; Still smiling, she turned back to Derik. &quot;There <i>must</i> be more than two of you, though. I know Alec Troven from Improbabilities spent some time on Pern - though, as I recall, &#39;complex&#39; describes him just as well as Nurse Robinson. And...&quot; She frowned, turned away, and waved across the room. &quot;Dafydd! Get over here, elf-boy, I need your memory.&quot;<br><br>Feeling Hera turn on her shoulder to keep Derik in view, Constance glanced back at him and winked. &quot;You should like Dafydd, if he can keep his arrogance leaking everywhere. Fantasy canon, obsessed with harps... oh, hello, lover, we were just talking about you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>You</i> were talking about me, at any rate,&quot; Dafydd said, passing Oleander to Constance. &quot;Problem?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No problem,&quot; Constance said, bouncing the baby absently. Hera, dislodged by the rocking, leapt into the air and hovered over the group&#39;s heads. &quot;This is Derik. He wants to know if there&#39;s anyone else from Pern in HQ.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, there&#39;s Alec,&quot; Dafydd suggested. &quot;Went on a mission there with him once, actually. And... didn&#39;t you work with someone, once?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He already knows Nurse Robinson,&quot; Constance said. &quot;Honestly, I thought elves were supposed to be mind-readers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That is a vicious lie,&quot; Dafydd said blandly. &quot;Let&#39;s see... I know Lou was Pernese at one point, but she doesn&#39;t exist.&quot; He glanced at Derik and shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s complex.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Constance deals with problems like I do - by looking frantically for a solution even if that&#39;s not the best response.<br><br>So: do you want me to find a Pernese agent among my <s>harem</s> horde? I&#39;m currently looking at either Salamander (with a changed name, obviously), or someone from Building Maintenance - Rosedale could potentially be at least a badfic Pernese name, with the Jonathan added on once he was recruited (and I&#39;ve just checked his appearances; he doesn&#39;t do anything that would make him <i>not</i> Pernese).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Derik took the bad news surprisingly well, in his own opinion. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said. The mask and bandana suddenly felt a bit hotter and more confining. He cast a longing look at the drinks table, but it would be rude to walk out now. Anyway, it wasn&#39;t as though he were any worse off than he had been to begin with.<br><br>&quot;Bother this,&quot; he growled to himself as Constance called Dafydd over. He pulled off the headwear and shook out his shaggy, slightly damp black hair. If he was going to continue conversing, he wanted to do so as himself, not some strange masked figure.<br><br>He nodded in greeting to Dafydd and attempted another smile for the baby&#39;s sake, this one slightly more convincing than the first. He hoped his face wouldn&#39;t scare the kid, who had probably never seen Threadscars.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; he replied when his turn came. &quot;To be honest, I suppose &#39;complex&#39; describes my situation, as well. You mentioned harps.&quot; He glanced at Constance, then back to Dafydd. &quot;I remember playing the harp—I was a Harper—but I&#39;m told those experiences were artificially constructed for me, thanks to some sort of reality-warping field I stumbled into after I got here.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter much—and that&#39;s quite enough about me. Thank you for your concern.&quot; He nodded to Constance.<br><br>And finally twigged onto the fact that she had kids. A whole clutch of them, if he wasn&#39;t much mistaken. All of them had a touch of their father&#39;s otherworldly good looks. &quot;So, uh... are those yours, then?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br>Nah, no need to stretch for that. Derik is probably mistaken in his belief that meeting other Pernese people would do him any good. I think he&#39;s chiefly looking for someone to understand his pain and make it okay to be as screwed up as he is, but the vastly more likely response from the average Pernese is pity, which doesn&#39;t do it. (As for Jenni, she&#39;s compromised by various baggage, particularly guilt over having indirectly caused Derik to lose his dragon in the first place. It hasn&#39;t occurred to Derik to blame her, but he doesn&#39;t have to. I&#39;m pretty sure they get together for <i>klah</i> on occasion, but I will probably never write about it because it&#39;s just too awkward.)<br><br>Dafydd stands a good chance at actually getting it, though, come to think of it. Not only does he know Pern, he has some experience with eternal torment of the soul thanks to being a Fлanorian, and he&#39;s got the physical mutilation to show for it, too. (Symbolism!) And, as Constance noted, harps. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Constance held Oleander tighter as the baby (still just about, at any rate) stared at Derik&#39;s revealed face. Slowly, he lifted one pudgy hand to point at Derik, and Constance could practically hear his mind working, cogs whirring (or squeaking) until they finally sent a word to his mouth:<br><br>&quot;Da!&quot;<br><br>And Oleander burst into fits of laughter.<br><br>Constance chuckled and ruffled his wispy hair. &quot;He only knows one word,&quot; she told Derik, &quot;but he does love to use it. Yes, they&#39;re all mine.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And they&#39;re <i>all</i>,&quot; Dafydd said firmly, ignoring Constance&#39;s pout. &quot;Honestly, five children was enough for Uncle Finarfin, it&#39;s enough for me. I don&#39;t need to be like- well, you know.&quot;<br><br>Tanfin, now holding Daphne&#39;s hand to keep her from running off, was frowning up at Derik. &quot;What happened to your face?&quot; he asked, sensing the lull in the conversation. &quot;Is it like what Daddy did to his hand?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>This is a &#39;too much stuff to respond to&#39; type of conversation. Dafydd hasn&#39;t yet gotten to comment on harps, though I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll get to it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;You have a lovely family,&quot; he complimented both parents.<br><br>His mood took a sudden upswing for no real reason that he was aware of—these things just happened—so he grinned at Tanfin&#39;s question. &quot;Only if the answer can be summed up as foolhardy overconfidence.&quot; But of course he wasn&#39;t seriously suggesting that could be true.

            <p>Dafydd noted Derik registering his missing hand, and held the stump up with a snort of laughter. &quot;This is <i>definitely</i> &#39;foolhardy overconfidence&#39;,&quot; he told the ex-dragonrider. &quot;What else would you call trying to use a &#39;Sue&#39;s magic ring that had <i>already</i> tried to kill you once?&quot;<br><br>He thought for a moment, his gaze flicking between Derik, Tanfin, and Hera, and then held up his remaining hand, palm out.

            <p>So, I&#39;ve recieved such a warm welcome, and I relaized i haven&#39;t really introduced myself. So here goes.<br>I am reading the orginal series, and I&#39;ve read the constitution, so I&#39;m prepared. I&#39;m a part of many fandoms, but Lord of The Rings will always be my first, and thus my greatest. I&#39;m a huge Tolkien nerd. I ahve a Tolkein shelf. And it is glorious! I also love the t.v show &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot; and bbc&#39;s &quot;Sherlock&quot; <br>I&#39;m rather dreamy, and I love to write. I&#39;ve actually been working on a fanfciton that now has 25 chapters. If anyone is willing to check it out and tell me if it&#39;s any good, please tell me, and I&#39;ll send a link:) I&#39;m constantly baking, opr writing, or reading, or drawing, or wasting time on the internet, and university is looming way to close for my tastes. People keep asking me what I&#39;ll study, and I just freeze like a deer in the healdights. Can I study being a baker/writer/historian? cause that would rock! For the record, I am a girl, just getting that out of the way, and I&#39;m so exited to have found the ppc. As soon as I&#39;ve spent a little time here I really want to write a mission. Do poeple ever cowrite with other authors? Becasue  that seems fun. anyway, as you may have noticed, I ramble. So thansk for listening, and I can;t wait to get to know y&#39;all! PS-should I introduce the agnet I mad eup?</p>

            <p>Please drop a link to your fanfic in the thread. I&#39;d be only too glad to give a bit of good old-fashioned concrit. On the other subject, er...<br><br>Basically, it&#39;s like this.

However, it&#39;s generally considered bad form to use a co-written fic as a means of bypassing the permissions process.

I&#39;m taking little breaks here and there to see what&#39;s going on with the Board, but those are short, lasting no longer then 5 minutes, 30 when posting in the mornings or evenings. Now that my Spring Break is over though, even that is going to be reduced.

            <p>I&#39;ve still got this quarter and then senior year before I graduate, but that&#39;s no excuse. And at least my grade&#39;s going to go up soon, since I memorized Pi to the 230th decimal place for Pi Day (March 14th- you know, 3.14?) and my teacher offered a half point of extra credit for every decimal after 3.14159. It was so much fun watching everyone&#39;s jaws drop. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Honestly,</sup></sup> though, even though this year&#39;s been sucking math-wise, tenth grade was a <i>lot</i> worse. <br><br>I made the mistake of signing up for this thing called the International Baccalaureate (IB) program and it nearly killed me. I&#39;m not kidding, either... the classes were so hard that I was barely scraping D- in pretty much all of them, and I became depressed and had to be sent to a mental rehab facility because I was suicidal. <br><br>Of course, none of the administrators/counselors gave a s*** about that except to tell me that they were very disappointed and had expected better. Thanks, guys.<br><br>So yeah, I dropped out of IB, much to said counselors/administrators&#39; dismay, and am doing much better now, academically and emotionally. The funny thing is, none of my teachers seem surprised when I start ranting about IB. I&#39;m not the first kid who&#39;s been thrown under the bus, and I probably won&#39;t be the last. Sure, there are some kids who are making straight A&#39;s in the IB, but I&#39;ve talked to them and they&#39;ve all said they have literally no life outside of school. Like, no life to the point of having to sacrifice sleep just to keep up with all the homework.<br><br>Wow... I really went off on a tangent there. But I kind of needed to get that out of my system. I really hope you never had to go through something like that- and anyone who&#39;s thinking about taking IB in high school, don&#39;t unless you are ready, willing, and able to dedicate 100% of your time to it.</p>

            <p>What happens, setting-wise, when a quarantined continuum is crossed over with a non-quarantined one? Like say A Song of Ice and Fire/Tolkienverse, respectively. Is that a fic that&#39;s impossible for the PPC to go into? Do the quarantined canon&#39;s elements just kind of stop existing/instantly assimilate? Just something I found myself pondering.</p>

            <p>Quarantined means you can&#39;t get in or out, period. You can look at the continuum--but try to portal there, and it will fail, probably in an amusing and embarrassing fashion, if the Ironic Overpower has anything to say about it.<br><br>Crossover between a quarantined and non-quarantined continuum means that the quarantined characters are replacements, automatically, because the badfic writer can&#39;t get to the originals. (And I&#39;m assuming badfic here, because anyone who writes fanfic and posts it against the express wishes of the author of the original story is just being bratty.)<br><br>Consider the author of the non-quarantined continuum, though. Most authors respect an author&#39;s authority over their work, and that respect is infused into the continua they create. When a badfic tries to invade, bringing with it cheap copies of characters from a quarantined continuum, most non-quarantined continua will reject the attempt to cross over, and the badfic author is forced to create replacements for both continua.<br><br>When a continuum is opened to fanfic and the PPC gets at it for the first time, then, it&#39;s likely to be untouched. But that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not some clean-up left to do.<br><br>The intentions of the author govern a story. When there&#39;s a crossover between a quarantined and non-quarantined continuum, there are three authors involved--the author who imposed the quarantine, the author of the other continuum, and the author of the fic. When the quarantine is lifted, a fic that once existed as a replacement copy that couldn&#39;t touch the originals may, obeying the badfic author&#39;s desires, drift toward one or both continua.<br><br>Now that the original authors&#39; wishes no longer completely close the continuum, such floating badfic may--if they are bad enough--attempt to latch on to one or both continua, resulting in a random mix of OOC, replacement characters, and even replacement objects and locations. The PPC may have to step in to clear these badfics out.<br><br>It would be a lot like any other mission. Replacements which are close enough to in-character might just merge with their originals, without too much damage. But there&#39;s an increased chance of getting &quot;clones&quot; of canon characters, locations, objects, and other bits of canon that didn&#39;t quite mesh properly when the badfic latched on to its new host continuum. The more OOC they are from their originals, the more likely that the new continuum can&#39;t match the replacements to who they were supposed to be.</p>

            <p>the point of our Creativity Shield explanation is to respect the authors&#39; wishes and not include elements of those stories in our missions.  There may not be an obvious in-universe explanation for why the PPC doesn&#39;t do that sort of crossover, but in the real world, we can&#39;t write missions like that simply because we are not allowed.</p>

            <p>Obviously, we can just say &quot;we&#39;re not allowed to write fic of Fandom X so it&#39;s a moot point&quot; and throw our hands up, but it&#39;s a little like saying &quot;discussing the events of Film Y is pointless because they were fictional&quot;. Plus, the main part of the question wasn&#39;t about quarantined continua themselves, but what happens when quarantined elements are in an otherwise non-quarantined fic - not to mention things like hS said, like an unquarantined fandom such as Pern which was still quarantined when the mission was written.</p>

            <p>The Wiki claims the crossover&#39;d elements count as original fiction, but I don&#39;t like that; it leaves open the chance for PPC writers to argue that, since it&#39;s not <i>really</i> a crossover any more, they can mission it and kill all the quarantined canon characters as OCs who don&#39;t fit the setting.<br><br>I&#39;m also not sure it stands up to precedent, specifically the Anne McCaffrey precedent. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1o-WydVPWUJZBx8Ewlm8UhV7UCEDXw7Dga0jXZSE7GUM">Brown DragonRider of Pern</a> was PPC&#39;d as <i>Pern</i> fanfic after the quarantine was lifted - but it was written beforehand. So did lifting the quarantine suddenly turn OCs into canon characters?<br><br>It looks like the &#39;author generates a Creativity Shield&#39; explanation is generally accepted (sigh... I remember when Fanfic Land actually impacted the real PPC... those were the days. Given that it&#39;s canonically known to have happened, I guess we set a CS up in around &#39;06. Wonder where we got it?). So what would a fanfic become when it hit a creativity shield?<br><br>Well, we claim that &#39;The PPC itself is a semi-quarantined continuum, with prospective authors requiring Permission and no unauthorized spinoffs allowed.&#39; So what status does an unauthorised PPC story have? We certainly wouldn&#39;t claim it was &#39;just&#39; plagiarised original fiction - we&#39;d claim it was, well, unauthorised PPC fiction. It doesn&#39;t impact the real PPC because its effect bounces off the shield. There&#39;s never been any hint that you can actually go into those stories (unlike actually plagiarised change-all-the-names stories).<br><br>So my guess is, attempts to breach quarantine actually fail to resolve. If you point a portal at one, it simply fails. There&#39;s no destination: fanfiction relies on pulling the canons (or the essence of the canons, or <i>something</i> from the canons) across to reify its world; with a creativity shield in place, it has nothing to draw on, and is just words on a page.<br><br>So what happens if you have a story that will &#39;load&#39; half its canons, but not the others? Sounds like a recipe for a total system crash to me. One minute an agent is listening to Legolas expound on the beauty of trees, the next minute they&#39;re shunted out of existence as the story becomes straight text for a quarantined character&#39;s lines. And scenes where they interact would be even worse. I&#39;m pretty sure it would be unwritable, at any rate, even if it weren&#39;t forbidden.<br><br>hS<br><br></p>

            <p>that since quarantined continuum fanfiction basically produces a plagiarized copy of said continuum, what the agents would need to do would be kill all the characters from the quarantined continuum. They aren&#39;t actually those characters- just doppelgдngers. And those doppelgдngers would be contaminating the non-quarantined continuum.<br><br>At least, that&#39;s what I think.

            <p>... but not with the outcome. The PPC does not make a habit of killing characters unless they have actively done something to deserve it, so I don&#39;t think the Agents would need to kill anyone, just because they are from a quarantined continuum. After killing Sues and Stus and the worst bit characters, they could offer recruitment to the rest.<br>Or maybe they could be neuralized and dropped off in Generic Fantasy Land or there&#39;s some other solution.</p>

            <p>If the replacements are three-dimensional characters, they don&#39;t have to be killed because they don&#39;t pose a threat anywhere they go. PPC assassins probably don&#39;t find it too satisfying to kill something that isn&#39;t Sueish.<br><br>Major characters who are replacements, but not glittery enough to pose a problem, can be recruited or relocated.<br><br>Generics and bits fade into the background once the major characters are gone.<br><br>And this may be a non-issue anyway in most cases, because a crossover with a quarantined continuum is usually rejected by the other continuum as well, leaving it to float harmlessly in its own original, plagiarized, world. Only once the continuum is opened and the crossover starts to try to latch onto one or the other continuum, would agents need to worry about it.</p>

            <p>According to the wiki, due to A Song of Ice and Fire being quarantined, it&#39;s impossible for PPC agents to go into the series.

Good colors—would I be right that they&#39;re drinking Guinness? Shading is a touch subtle, but nice. They all have some very long schnozes on them, though, especially apparent on the two women in profile. It&#39;s not as obvious on Danny, since men tend to have larger heads with longer faces than women, but still a factor. Are you going for a sort of anime-ish look? (If not, I really love <a href="http://majnouna.deviantart.com/gallery/6557">Majnouna&#39;s tutorials</a>.

            <p>I will say that the long noses are somewhat deliberate for Xericka and DeeGee. I&#39;ve always pictured Xericka as having long, thin features (as she&#39;s basically just a humanoid version of <a href="http://www.khwiki.com/images/b/ba/Dusk_KHII.png">this creature</a>. I wanted to give DeeGee a heavier sort of face, as might benefit an ork. Even then, I feel like might have gone a bit too far (and yes, I know that ~95% of drawings of <i>Shadowrun</i> orks are not nearly as monstrous as she turned out). I definitely did screw that up for Gremlin, though, and thanks for pointing that out. I&#39;ll keep that in mind for any future projects.<br><br>The shadows did come out a bit muted, didn&#39;t they? I was trying a new method of doing them (never did highlights and such before) and wasn&#39;t quite sure how heavy to make them.<br><br>Yes, they&#39;re drinking Guinness (apart from the whiskey-sipping Xericka) as benefits the day. Or PPC-appropriate equivalents thereof, anyway.</p>

            <p>As the years draw on, Baron Huinesoron of the Union of Plort goes less often to war. Many have speculated on the reasons for his withdrawal. Does he fear the Marizu? Does he scorn them? Is he preparing some powerful weapon to strike a devastating blow against them?<br><br>The true answer can now be revealed: none of the above. He simply has difficulty deciding which banner to fight under.<br><br>There are, of course, his own two heraldic devices, after the two systems used in Plort. Then there are the two devices of his wife, and their joint impaled standard. He often bears the banners of Jay and Acacia, which any knight of Plort may bear. He also holds the standards of three fallen companions, Raven, Vemi, and Rohana, which he bears on a time in memory and honour of them. Even the standard of his preferred ship, the <i>Aberration</i>, has been seen on the battlefield - and the standards of the armies he marches with, Ofum Too and the Order of Udisc.<br><br>Then there are the flags. The emblems of Ozerbord and Borrd are his to bear, as is that of the Union of Plort - and the ancient standard of the now-fragmented Protectorate of Plort. Less often, he will ride under the flag of lost El-Jheycom - and there are rumours that he has been seen bearing the battle-scarred flag of the El-Jheycom Resistance.<br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y148/Huinesoron/BaronStandards.png"><br><br>So here we are: back to the Union of Plort. If you&#39;re joining us for the first time, or even if you&#39;re not, here&#39;s what is written so far:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFoRXDPMJ2HKR_HfxDl4ihYPNN1qvnjAj3fFVPWSb3c/pub">Baron Huinesoron&#39;s Cyclopaedia of Plort</a> (scroll down for the rest of the Cyclopaedia)<br><br>This thread has two purposes. First, to continue the work we&#39;ve already begun. The Union of Plort is an AU version of the PPC Community (not the universe!) Write your stories! Every one of you is present on Konti-Nyuum, in one of its four nations (and for clarity: Borrd = the Board, Ozerbord = the Other Board, Wechi = the Wiki, Iric = the IRC), so tell us how you arrived there. (The class system is simple - PGs are barons, people with permission are knights, people without are civilians. There is no rank distinction between the latter two terms)<br><br>You&#39;re free to embellish the geography as you see fit. There&#39;s a fair number of unnamed geographical features, so if you live near them, you can name them. Anyone can also name a new town - or live in a pre-existing one. I&#39;ll update the maps, don&#39;t worry.<br><br>The second purpose of this thread may already be obvious: heraldry! I&#39;ve made a start, but there&#39;s so much more to be done.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CRwK0B70gWO0lJ_TgeiyTEF_l6A6_yyQ2BgH9ATKL6w/edit?usp=sharing">This finely-crafted document</a> describes the two heraldic systems of Plort. You can make yourself a device in either system, or both. If you can create an image, that would be brilliant - but just a description (in the formal language, or just in English) is good too.<br><br>There are also symbols needed for the armies and ships. The rule is that armies (= OFUs) get a shield, while ships (= PPC departments) get an elvish symbol. (On the subject of ships - I&#39;m imagining that the DMS, DF, and DBS are probably fleets, with multiple ships in them; the other departments are single ships. Feel free to tweak this as you please)<br><br>And, of course, there&#39;s the flags. I&#39;ve created them for Ozerbord, El-Jheycom, and both the Protectorate and Union of Plort. The others, I have let untouched. Feel free to put together a design for the nation you &#39;live&#39; in - and voice your approval for the versions you like!<br><br>Anything else you feel like creating - national anthems? Mottos? I don&#39;t know - is also good. Remember, the goal of this is to have <i>fun</i>, not to obey my every whim. I&#39;m only a baron, after all!<br><br>-Baron Huinesoron of Plort</p>

            <p>Wechi, Iric, and !!Borrd!! still don&#39;t have any, which is quite shocking. I left them open for other people (since I&#39;d already made four), but if no-one wants them, I may have to come up with some myself. You can do national flags for non-Konti-Nyuum nations, if you want to - they&#39;ll go into the Cyclopaedia same as the rest.<br><br>Trilateral symmetry... well, that depends. An English shield is obviously not trilaterally symmetrical, unless you abuse it into an equilateral triangle (inverted). But there is <i>party per pall</i> available. You could make each <s>quadrant</s> <s>trident?</s> section identical. Or you could simply have, for instance, <i>Azure, three stars Or arranged two, one</i> (or indeed <i>one, two</i>). If you wanted absolute trilaterallism, adding <i>rotated to be trilaterally symmetrical</i> would make the point, I guess.<br><br>In essence: probably, though it might take some mangling of the wording to blazon it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I meant, partitioning a device into three parts.<br>Anyway, for West-north&#39;s flag I have this:<br>on a silver field, a black shield with a golden border above crossed swords; inside the shield, a smaller golden golden shield bearing the image of a sceptre with a large ruby on top and three rays emanating from it. No, I haven&#39;t the faintest how to say this in heraldry-speak, and yes, this is basically a blatant copy of Wesnoth&#39;s swords-and-shield logo.</p>

            <p>However, to represent the Bronee, I have a few options. <br><br>The first one is the one I think is most likely to be the flag, with some minor touching up. It&#39;s taken directly from the first episode, so no need to worry about crediting beyond the show itself:<br><br><img src="http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/059/f/d/equestrian_national_flag_by_kibbleknight-d4ragic.png" alt="http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/059/f/d/equestrian_national_flag_by_kibbleknight-d4ragic.png"><br><br>The second is a version of this flag based off of the one we see in Hearth&#39;s Warming Eve. However, it is insinuated to be an acient flag, used when the three pony tribes first came together and founded Equestria:<br><br><img src="http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/351/c/5/flag_of_the_principality_of_equestria_by_snackserv-d4jegtx.png" alt="http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/351/c/5/flag_of_the_principality_of_equestria_by_snackserv-d4jegtx.png"><br><br>This one is a more &quot;official&quot; flag, with the sun and moon representing Celestia and Luna:<br><br><img src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/351/e/4/flag_of_the_equestrian_empire_vector_by_hombre0-d4jem1k.png" alt="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/351/e/4/flag_of_the_equestrian_empire_vector_by_hombre0-d4jem1k.png"><br><br>That&#39;s all I can really think of for the Bronee. I&#39;m kinda leaning towards the first one, though the second is really, really cool, and looks like an official flag. I&#39;m conflicted. Which one do you guys think is best?<br><br>Also, I may or may not actually complete that history of the Bronee. If I do, I&#39;ll post it here, but it&#39;s way harder then I thought to transition it properly. We&#39;ll see what happens with that.</p>

            <p>We&#39;ve known about the Hyparlink Road for some time, and L&#39;Urque is known to be on a major road, too. There at at least four ports on Konti-Nyuum - Borrd, Mei&#39;n Payj, Tumblar and La Wunj - and, presumably, stuff gets from them to the other cities <i>somehow</i><br><br>Here&#39;s how:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Konti-NyuumRoadsLarge.png"><br><br>As you can see, the big loser on the road network front is Iric (and eastern Borrd) - while there are large passes into Wechi and Ozerbord, the former Kingdom of Chaett is solidly walled off by the Larninkurvs - and, where La Wunj itself is concerned, another set of mountains and a river (seriously, is <i>no-one</i> going to give Iric&#39;s geography appropriate names?).<br><br>On the other hand, the east is the clear <i>winner</i> when it comes to sea traffic. The Western Arc allows shipping from Borrd to Tumblar, much of which then takes the Pankae Road inland and through to La Wunj. The Eastern Arc, passing through the recently-discovered Tumblar Gap in the reefs, forms the near end of the Tumblar Route, which reaches all the way to the distant Scholars&#39; Empire and Federation of Academia. La Wunj, with the massive Chaett Break in the reef, is even better off - ships sail in from all the lands to the east, but primarily vast Somath-Aful and wealthy Autor.<br><br>The rest of Konti-Nyuum is limited to only two trade routes - or perhaps even one. The northern Hyparlink, heading to Tivit, is well-travelled, but the southern extension heads into waters roamed by troll pirates, and then to Marizu-controlled shores.<br><br>Borrd, Wechi, and Ozerbord are tied together by a well-developed network of roads. The north-south Hyparlink and the west-east Great Western Highway are the most prominent, and their intersection has made Vaekew a significant trade hub - particularly since the Iron Highway also terminates there, bringing ore from the western mines. Of course, officially there <i>is</i> no Iron Highway - just the El-Jheycom Road from Vaekew to Andboc - but the barons Neshomeh and Araeph show surprisingly little concern about the masses of smuggling over the Obrefs from Risersh.<br><br>The Wattuf Mountains were in Plort&#39;s early days considered impassable, until the Quest of the Five discovered the pass now named after them. The proximity of the Pass to the headwaters of the river Wep have spurred development in the area, and much of the output of the mines now takes the Copperway through a bored-out tunnel, north to Ozerbord, and then follows the O-Road and Coast Road to Borrd.<br><br>One of the less-travelled, but most important, roads is the Knights&#39; Road, an offshoot of the GWH. It is this road that prospective knights take on their pilgrimages to the Purmeshun Range, and the sides of the road are littered with shrines and monuments.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>That was surprisingly fun. Now I have to figure out how to fit it into the Cyclopaedia... :(<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Neshomeh said last time round that Wechi is basically Scotland - independent, mountainous, self-sufficient. So that got me thinking: what are the <i>other</i> nations of our little Union?<br><br>Borrd - England. Oldest (though technically Scotland is sort of older - it depends how you think of the union with England), largest, most populous. It probably holds the most political power, too - and under the baronial system, Borrd has always had the most barons, and thus the greatest influence on the Council.<br><br>Ozerbord - Wales. The least populous, Ozerbord is generally content to be run by a Borrd baron - though it does harbour some thoughts of full independence. It&#39;s also mountainous, and hosts a song-and-story contest.<br><br>Iric - Ireland, the Republic Of. Fiercely independent from Borrd, Iric is only grudgingly in the Union at all (much like Ireland only grudgingly shares the British Isles). It also has a significant history as an independent nation, what with the existence of Chaett. Which of course means...<br><br>The Barony of Cassie - Northern Ireland. Cassie&#39;s barony lies in Borrd now, but it was once part of Chaett. I imagine there were long debates over where it should be assigned when Iric was formed - and possibly even actual fighting. It&#39;s an uneasy part of Borrd, at best.<br><br>The former El-Jheycom - Cornwall. Part of Borrd, but with a long-past independent history, El-Jheycom is trying quietly to reestablish itself as a full member of the Union. It also has strong ties with Ozerbord, much as Cornwall does with Wales.<br><br>L&#39;Urque - Berwick-upon-Tweed. A little border town between Borrd and Wechi, it&#39;s a perpetual debate as to which country it&#39;s actually <i>in</i>. Much like Berwick, which changed hands between England and Scotland repeatedly for 400 years.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I guess in some ways Critta&#39; is similar. It&#39;s a foreign enclave in Borrd possession, and - like modern Calais - is something of a hub for trade. I rather suspect the tax-evasion aspects of Critta&#39; occurred in English Calais, too. But Calais was an English possession in France, while Critta&#39; sits firmly on native Plort soil.<br><br>If I had to pin an identity on the tax havens, they&#39;d probably be the Welsh Marches. Part of one country, but culturally more like the other - and the countries are right, this way (England and Wales, Borrd and Ozerbord - the only difference is they&#39;re reversed). Plus, the southern haven is the mining region, and that&#39;s what a lot of South Wales was (and to some extent is).<br><br>So what would Critta&#39; be? Probably something like Swansea, or even Cardiff. Since we&#39;re medieval, we can remember that Cardiff was relatively small back then. The capital of Wales - our city of Ozerbord - was, insofar as it had one, up in the north. Perhaps Machynlleth is the closest match - in fact, I think I&#39;ll go and build a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Clock_Tower,_Machynlleth_-_geograph.org.uk_-_561320.jpg">clock tower</a> in the city centre.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It is in some ways similar to Cardiff and Swansea, being that it has a thing for trade. Pembroke itself is very much connected to the English, despite being on the other side of Wales, as it was the birthplace of the Tudor Monarchy amongst other things. It was also around in Medieval times, in terms of a settlement and castle.</p>

Because, unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t. The Latin sentence is somewhat poorly contructed, as <i>vos</i> is the plural &quot;you,&quot; whereas the verb <i>potes</i> is second-person singular: &quot;<i>thou</i> art not able.&quot; Delete the <i>vos</i>, and you&#39;re left with a translatable sentence (albeit not a well-constructed one): &quot;You (singular), however, are not able to write thus!&quot;<br><br>A way to say &quot;That isn&#39;t how to write Latin!&quot; in Latin is <i>Non est quam Latine scribere!</i></p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s talking about life in general, or recent events. Specifically it means the Quest of Erebor, but that&#39;s not so relevant to Ozerbord.

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Once upon a time, in the land of Tivit, lived a mage by the name of Karrin the Blue. In the earlier years of her life, she dwelt in the calmer outlands of Fanvik-Neht, but all records of work in that time have been lost. She then left those lands and walked with a tribe of Bronee before finding the land of Tivit, where she studied the art of Arpying.<br><br>From the libraries of Tivit she learned the ways by which the nations of the Scholars Empire had been founded and learned of their shared traits. And in time she learnt to recognize the traits of the Marizu, whose ways had been nigh-unheard of to her as they rarely ventured to the outlands where she had lived.<br><br>One day, in her studies she heard tell of the land of Plort, and set off with her books of magic and gods. Though she was inexperienced in the ways of fighting the Marizu, it was not long before she began to make raids into the familiar outlands to cull the rare incursions she discovered. In these battles she found aid in the Fast Seneschal and later a monk, and often she used her knowledge of the magic of Beytah to aid them.<br><br>She continued in this way until one day she saw a vision of the Marizu war-leader, Nova, and the desolation she had brought to the lands of Fanvik-Neht where Karrin had once roamed. She and the monk travelled to defeat her, and though the battle was long and hard, Karrin the Blue dealt the death-blow herself.<br><br>Though the battle against the scourge Nova had been won, it was not without cost - during their campaign the mage had been observing the festival of Nahn-Oh Wry-Moh, and she found herself exhausted. She returned to her home, retreating from the societies of Plort to meditate and regathering her strength, making frequent pilgrimages to the lands of Tivit and Aohtree, and seeking new knowledge in the port town of Tumblar. Having since honed her skills in Arpying, Beytah, Vew&#39;zorse, and Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl, she now undertakes scouting missions into the Marizu lands, though the results are kept hidden until she believes that she has gathered enough information to be of use.<br><br>-------------<br>Her motto is &quot;Spes est scintilla magna et dura facie domuit indifferentia non universi,&quot; which is google translate Latin for &quot;Hope is the spark that is not subdued in the face of the vast and callous indifference of the universe,&quot; which itself is a paraphrase from this: &quot;Hope? Hope is not the absence of tragedy, my friend. It is the conviction that tragedy can be endured. Hope is the spark in you that is not subdued in the face of the vast and callous indifference of the universe. Hope is that which is not shattered by hardship. Hope is the urge to fight what is wrong even when you know it will destroy you. Hope is the decision to love and need someone knowing that they will one day die. For me to promise that there are no obstacles would be the cruelest lie I could possibly tell. That lie is not hope. Hope is the will which needs no lies,&quot; which is a quote from <a href="http://travisbeacham.tumblr.com/post/59911992881/ochinkun-there-is-a-thing-about-the-pacific-rim"><a href="http://travisbeacham.tumblr.com/post/59911992881/ochinkun-there-is-a-thing-about-the-pacific-rim">http://travisbeacham.tumblr.com/post/59911992881/ochinkun-there-is-a-thing-about-the-pacific-rim</a></a><br></p>

You see, I&#39;m doing a research on badfic and honestly I&#39;m quite lacking some reliable sources.So maybe you guys could give me links to related topics?

            <p>1) Design your agent. Actually <i>writing</i> for your agent will come later, but it&#39;s best to have them living in your head for a while before asking for permission to write a PPC story. Spoiler warning: you won&#39;t get until you&#39;ve been hanging around here for a while; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5HO-X_fR7o">this song</a> accurately describes my feelings towards the process. =]<br><br>1a) Just remember: a Boarder is someone who posts on the Board, while an agent is someone written by a Boarder. An agent can be very similar to you, but <i>you are not an agent</i>.<br><br>2) Hang around here and ingratiate yourself/selves (around these parts gender is not only non-binary, but also non-Euclidean) with the rest of us. We&#39;re mostly harmless. Mostly. I&#39;d watch that Huinesoron, though. Chap&#39;s trouble.<br><br>3) Repeat #2 constantly.<br><br>4) Go through the permissions process. Huinesoron will guide you through it. I&#39;d avoid the self-check, though. It may eat your soul. I mean, I did it and I think I&#39;m okay, but sometimes my skin oozes small black dots that fly up into the sky like the dreams of dying men, but that might just be eczema.</p>

            <p>Gender is too binary! There are 0 genders. Or maybe 1. Or 10? 11? 100? Oh, I don&#39;t know, I lose count.<br><br>Alternate answer: no, gender is trinary: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender">masculine, feminine, and neuter</a>.

            <p>RCs need to be signified by numbers, whether those are whole numbers, decimals, numbers with letters and other symbols mixed in, or irrational numbers, and the Konami Code contains no numbers and only two letters.

            <p>I have several points of concern:<br><br>- Your introduction post is still on the front page. We generally prefer people to have been active in the community longer than one week before we give them the keys to the playground.<br><br>- The Konami Code is not even trying to be anything resembling number. Also, IMO, it&#39;s kind of an eyesore when it crops up in the midst of a narrative.<br><br>- I think Billy&#39;s backstory of chasing after an underage girl to show her that stalking is wrong is part of his badfic, but that&#39;s still exceptionally creepy. I&#39;m not really seeing what redeeming qualities caused the agents on the mission to have recruited him. That coupled with his tendency to relapse into Suedom really worries me.<br><br>- In the first writing sample, there&#39;s a statement that the agents can&#39;t go to the Canon Library because they might get a mission and would have no way to contact each other. This is a bit silly, since if it were true, no one would ever leave their RCs. Most agents tend to settle for the low-tech method of &quot;tracking the other one down on foot,&quot; but there are cell phones and even more futuristic communications devices to be had in HQ, too—and Bob has a Pidgey. I&#39;m thinking carrier pigeon, maybe? Plus, what with the Laws of Narrative Irony, actively waiting for a mission would tend to make it <i>not</i> happen.<br><br>- In the second writing sample... that&#39;s AU, right? I mean, if Billy does enjoy badfic sincerely, and not in the sense that mocking it is fun, I really have to insist you find another partner for Bob. {= / (Note to PGs: This prompt is maybe not great? How many ways can we think of to write it in a way that shows us something good instead of worrisome?)<br><br>- Did you use a beta for your writing samples? I caught several SPaG errors, including:<br><br>-- &quot;Man, I’m so bored!&quot; exclaimed Billy - Missing quotation mark.<br><br>-- The hedgehog lashed out at this remark. “Are you kidding me?!&quot; - Missing period.<br><br>-- “If you mean the fact that&quot; - &quot;man&quot; should be &quot;mean.&quot;<br><br>-- Billy was about to continue his argument when the console, in what was presumably a show of kindness - &quot;wat&quot; should be &quot;was.&quot;<br><br>--  “Seriously?! My Little Pony?!” - Titles of long works, such as TV series, are italicized.<br><br>-- Too many missing or misplaced commas to account for here.<br><br>So, for those reasons, I must say <b>Permission Denied</b> for the time being. Hang around a good while longer, work on your agents, keep reading the Original Series and other spinoffs, and try again another time. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The purpose of the prompts is to show an unlikely, often ridiculous situation, and ask how your characters would deal with it. So yes, it will be AU. In that specific case, it&#39;s a dual challenge: can you present your character liking badfic believably, and can you write their partner&#39;s reaction.<br><br>They&#39;re <i>supposed</i> to be AU. That&#39;s the whole point. Otherwise you&#39;d also have to take issue with the one that&#39;s one partner being reassigned - &quot;If they&#39;re being partnered with someone else, we need to see <i>their</i> bio, too!&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There&#39;s unlikely (meeting a robot with a paper mask) and then there&#39;s directly anathema to the purpose of the PPC. Plus, this isn&#39;t an event, like being repartnered, that you can just say never happened; this is fundamental characterization, which is the main thing these prompts are supposed to show us. Hating badfic is just about the only thing all agents have in common, so barring possession or a nightmare or other mind-altering circumstances, it&#39;s guaranteed to be OOC for every single character. What&#39;s the good in asking people to write a prompt that won&#39;t show us anything real or true about the characters?<br><br>Also, I thought making the prompt AU was optional, to allow for things like being repartnered or arguing about shipping—things that, while they absolutely can and do occur in the PPC, simply may not apply to these agents at this time. I don&#39;t think they should necessarily have to be—again, we&#39;re looking to get an idea of characterization here, so we need to see the characters in situations that could actually happen to a PPC agent. Honestly liking badfic is not a thing that actually happens to PPC agents.<br><br>The bottom line to all that is that I personally don&#39;t know if I can ever judge this prompt positively. &quot;It&#39;s AU&quot; alone has never been an acceptable excuse for OOCness, so the idea of PPC agents sincerely approving of badfic will always make me curl my lip. There are a few ways around this (mind control, etc.), but I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s enough wiggle-room to make this prompt a fair one. Can&#39;t we think of something else, or at least rewrite it to make it less of a direct invitation to OOCness?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So far I&#39;ve had a lot of pretty nice welcomes and the such.<br>However, as for creating an agent, I might work on one and in about a week have a link up to a &quot;profile&quot; of sorts-- because I tend to code entire websites for my characters because it&#39;s fun to me, and then after getting that done and being around for awhile (About six months?) i&#39;ll request permission. (But i&#39;m a bit hyped to get a character done specifically for this, which says a lot given how i&#39;m NEVER excited about writing anything unless I know enough people, even thought I&#39;ve been writing for about fourteen years now, and on top of that never enjoyed the concept of writing a fanfiction.)</p>

            <p>Once, many years ago, there a travelling warrior. She hailed from the farthest west and southeast shores, where the Emperor of Fanvik-Neht had no power and was barely known. This was the land of Teiemeffae, a small kingdom where the threat of Marizu was rare, and many of its people were avid followers of the Scientific Theatre of Three Thousand Mysteries. This was not enough for the girl, for she was but a girl at the time- she did not wish to reside peacefully within Teiemeffae&#39;s walled borders,  but desired to ride forth and strike down the Marizu herself. The girl&#39;s elders- many vaunted former knights who once rode out in the name of the Saint themselves- warned her that it was not so simple, that she was, perhaps, too young. She should wait, and instead continue learning from their archives.<br><br>Eventually, she traveled forth, ignoring their warnings and leaving Teiemeffae, for its golden era was long past even in her youth, with but a journal and pen in sack and staff in hand, and made her way east, and north, for there she had heard tales of the Marizu&#39;s power, and thought herself capable of taking them on. <br><br>After some time, she reached the borders of Fanvik-Neht. There she heard word of the Knights of Harpwire, recently driven away from Fanvik-Neht. She found the tales encouraging, and did not heed that two experienced knights found themselves at a loss faced against the alliance of Xing. The girl attacked, and fell easily. The warnings of the elders held true after all- it was not simple, and she was too young.  She found herself easily fought off and ignored, and she left to tend to her injuries and wounded pride, leaving through Fanvik-Neht&#39;s southern borders, and skirting the Marizu League&#39;s lands.<br><br>She traveled well and long until she found herself someplace south of Somath-Aful- first the growing kingdom of Cockerelgnash, where she found herself falling in with a group of young lads who were willing fighters with little direction beyond the art of mah-shin-nema which entertained the peoples there, and once she learned their ways and found little else to challenge her there, she traveled to the artistic Keen lands, a southerly domain where each lord&#39;s domain varied wildly in how the laws were upheld, where she fell in with the Deegan band, a group of lawless outlanders who were willing to bloody each other in their occasionally cruel fights for dominance, and occasionally ventured into the dangerous outlaw lands of Bie, which bordered Somath-Aful.<br><br><br>And yet, she still remembered her original goal, the purpose which led her to leave Teiemmefae in the first place,  and found herself at a loss- was her quest still a good one? Was she worthy to continue on to it, after her years of near-outlawry and wildness? She decided to seek her answer at home, but found no answers- Teiemeffae&#39;s gates were closed, its walls shored up against all potential invaders and no one in sight.<br><br>It was an answer in and of itself. Home was gone, the warrior could only travel forward.<br><br>From there she made her way forward, learning the art of the sword in the Nova Imperium, which bordered Are-Pea; the citizens of the Imperium were often torn as to whether they should join Are-Pea, but in her time there they were actively against it, often fighting skirmishes in the borders.<br><br>Again she made her way to Fanvik-Neht, and this time she was able to stand her ground against marauders; now she was wiser and older, and could truly call herself a warrior. She traveled northward to the was�tes, tracing to the best of her ability the route the knights of Harpwire took, though for a time she was lost, and ended up in El-Jhey. <br><br>From there, she finally set sail with intent to reach Konti-Nyuum, and upon reaching the island she promptly wrecked against the reefs and southern cliffs that helped stave away Marizu invasions. Rather than waste the time she perceived it would take to travel to an open port, instead she began the process of climbing upwards.<br><br>By the time she finally made it to the top, she was fully acquainted with the cliffs of �Konti-Nyuum.<br><br>The Larninkurv Mountains were a far easier feat to travel after the cliffs, and it was there she became enchanted with Wechi, swearing to return there in the future. The next time, however, would be with better supplies than only a length of rope, a sack, a stave, and a sword. (The journal and pen were still with her, and came in use, but were only helpful in penning down information for the future.)<br><br>From there, she eventually made her way to Borrd, and immediately bade for permission to join in protection of Plort as a knight. To the surprise of none but herself, as a stranger to the land, she was told to wait, and prove herself first.<br><br>With that, she immediately returned to Wechi, where she helped with the process of settling it, bringing law and a vague understanding of the way of roads and how to not make sinking boats with her.<br><br>With time, word of her actions soon spread, and she was joined by Neshomeh, who aided her. Between the two, Wechi soon began to flourish.<br><br>And yet, the young warrior grew restless, even as she worked; she came here to fight the Marizu, instead she was building in the wilderness. Her sword was not being put to use; her staff only somewhat more. Her skills grew and developed, and eventually she could navigate the Rhedlenc Mire and the Blulenc River with ease in a coracle made by her own hand. Wechi’s waters and mountains were now hers to command. <br><br>Finally, she departed, bidding her companion goodbye for now, and undertook the pilgrimage to become a knight and full protector of Plot. She succeeded, and returned as a knight.<br><br>Her first campaigns she undertook alone, but she found she favored company, going to battle alongside the knight Trojie (who with time became one of Plort’s barons), among others. <br><br>The young knight’s time in Wechi had inspired a new ambition in her: no longer was battle her only desire, destroying the ranks of Marizu as she had longed to do for years, but so was creation; Wechi became her home, a roofless that she had made her own, but there were other forgotten places that called to her as well.<br><br>She had arrived after Chaett’s union with Plort, but aspired to hopes to a new, similar place, where the citizens of Konti-Nyuum could gather and easily share knowledge and commerce between themselves. With it, she began her attempts to bring about Iric.<br><br>It quickly became a barely hidden disaster.<br><br>Iric attracted the worst of the worst, soon becoming a penal colony of sorts. The lowlives and criminals who weren’t tolerated in Borrd, whom the knight was asked to keep in Iric, and away from the more civil lands of Plort soon gathered in Iric, and there was little she could do to stop them. Jacks who tried to prey on women, and Orangemen who spouted virulent hatred against others of all stripe and vaunted their own superiority; in a land of women knights, should they not take advantage?<br><br>Unsure of authority, the knight let it pass, until it went too far.<br><br>With it, she struck the Jacks down, and the Orangemen, driving them from Iric. By then it was too late, and her actions struck a discord. Iric had grown used to anarchy, and had a form of disobedience borne through their blood, because the Constitution of Plort had no reach here. <br><br>Iric, and its immigrants from Tivit soon became the source of the knight’s downfall.<br><br>Whispers of her cruelty and a thirst for power began to spread, fully indoctrinating new arrivals to Iri...il nearly all there believed them, and absconded to meet in secret, carefully selecting those who would stand against the knight. <br><br>These rumors eroded at the knight, driving her to madness and desperation as others ignored her requests for help; her brashness and occasional heavy-handedness were the reason, they said, and with time they would become allies, if she allowed them the chance.<br><br>In the end, she retreated from Iric during the rebellion, setting fire to Castle Flayme in the process. <br><br>Things did not improve, and the knight despaired, even as she received the honor of becoming a baron. Everything she had done in the past amounted to nothing, now. <br><br>Before long, she found herself pressed fully out from all sides- she received no aid from others, and her ability to do anything repeatedly limited by cries that she was infected by madness, a secret traitor to the Marizu League, a iron despot. <br><br>Eventually, she traveled to Borrd, from which she announced her departure for good, appointing a successor, and left to the sea.<br><br>Time passed, and the wanderer- she could no longer call herself a knight, or even a warrior- traveled once more. She returned to the Nova Imperium, and then to a recently formed land- Dedubya, which took up much of El-Jhey’s former territory, and even bisected into Are-Pea’s.<br><br>She did not forget, even as she built anew, leaving the Marizu menace to others to deal with. Her sword she kept sheathed. <br><br>And yet, she could not help looking seawards, towards the island that had for a significant amount of time had been her home...<br><br>A new calling found her, and with only a short time left to prepare before she left, the warrior found herself reminiscing. Should she return? Was it worth it? Or was she truly an ill-made knight, one who should never have been in the first place? Her younger days had been spent in near-to-outright outlawry, it was true, but she had put those behind her when she travelled to Konti-Nyuum. Looking back, she could only wonder if her actions were disguised by her own perceptions at the time. What if she had been in the wrong?<br><br>Only going back could answer her questions, she decided, after seeking advice.<br><br>The wanderer gathered her things, sword, stave, and journal, and then returned to the shore, where she put her shipbuilding skills to use, and made her way back.<br><br>This time she avoided the reefs, and the cliffs, instead heading to Borrd.<br><br>There, she made her way to one of the many gathering place, finally back again.<br><br>It is here that this tale ends for now, dear reader, now that I am here once more…<br><br>____<br><br>To the surprise of a few who were around back then, no doubt, hi again.<br><br>I’ve been gone for quite a long while, but I decided I might as well return to my old stomping grounds for at least a short while before I disappear from the internet entirely for awhile; in about forty days I’m leaving for the Navy, you see. Quite some time to disappear from the internet entirely, after that!<br><br>Most of you are new faces, so I hope you’ll forgive me the lengthiness; I couldn’t resist using the framework hS set up there and putting it to use, since, I hope you understand, what with being here, I have a weakness for stories.<br><br>-July<br></p>

            <p>July&#39;s story kinda caused me to write something for the Protectorate of Plort, too, though I fear it is nowhere near as good as her story... but whatever. Here it is:<br><br>Once upon a time, in the distant land of Tivit, lived a foreign monk. First raised in the island nation of West-north, he quietly practised the martial art of Arpying — whose practitioners assumed the visage of others — in the monastery of Agog. Yet he yearned for something more.<br>Hearing rumours about the Protectorate of Plort and its fabled knights, one day he simply left the monastery. The great wars have moved elsewhere, and the Great Incident and Storm of Fury were things of the future; for a while peace reigned in the land of Tivit, and his journey was peaceful.<br>He arrived at Borrd on a clear night when the stars shone brightly and the Sirocco was blowing. For a while he settled there, but he did not find the satisfaction he sought, so he packed his belongings again and moved to Iric.<br>However, it was a time of unrest. Whispered conversations in the inns of La Wunj accused the reigning baron of cruelty, of greedy ambition. At first he did not believe the rumours, for he was naturally trusting. Soon, though, he clashed with the baron. It was not a matter of great import; a disagreement concerning a metaphysical statement, no more, but to the monk it seemed like the whole world hinged on the answer. <br>For a while he seethed quietly, but a time came when he could stand it no longer. Rejecting the revolutionaries that now plagued the region as the dangerous men they were, he instead went into exile, leaving Konty-nyuum for the island kingdom of Ydyff, where he fought in their wars for a time.<br>But the desire that drove him to seek Plort in the first place was still strong in his heart, so after a while he returned. The ship that brought him back was small but well-maintained, a parting gift from his commanding officer; he arrived at Borrd once again when the Sirocco was blowing and the stars were bright. Making his way through the streets, he quickly left the city.<br>Living for a time in the wildernesses of Baron Huinesoron’s domain, he chanced one day upon a queer sight. A knight was hard at work at a forge, whose fire was provided by a young woman. He approached them, and they soon became friends, bringing him to their abode in a hidden vale not far from where he encountered them.<br>For a while he was content to learn, working with the knight, who dubbed himself the Fast Seneschal, at his forge and with the woman — Karrin the Blue — at her library; but tragedy struck after but a short while. One day the monk returned to the library only to find Karrin tearing her hair out in agony, for she has seen a vision of a great Marizu leader raising an army for an attack on their abode. As the smith-knight was absent, they stowed away on a ship bound toward the Marizu lands.<br>Their battle with the Marizu leader, Nova, was long and hard; fortunately they had secured the help of a wandering knight, else they would have surely perished. At the end they triumphed, and, weary and wounded, they made their way back home.<br>Ever since then the monk is quietly toiling at the secret abode, practicing the dual arts of Beytah and Arpying with his friends. From time to time he ventures forth to slay the Marizu, and once every few months Ydyff’s king requests his services yet again, but for the most part he quietly sits in his library, learning.<br></p>

            <p>Yes, well, you rarely ever do when you start off, after all, no matter how old you are or how much experience you have. It takes time to flesh characters out, and that&#39;s something you do by writing them. You can&#39;t say you haven&#39;t noticed it with all the others you write, after all. <br><br>No doubt; I legged it up to Boston and Cambridge last summer, but I didn&#39;t make it out that far, just stuck around mainly in that area.

            <p>... it&#39;s fiction. Just like Kaitlyn isn&#39;t actually trying to revive the LJ community as a major part of the PPC community, the IRC isn&#39;t actually made up of thieves and villains. But it provides a nice in-universe explanation for why they engaged in violent rebellion and stole my castle, grr.<br><br>Furthermore, it&#39;s <i>unreliable narrator</i> fiction. Ex-Baron July has a different view on things to Baron Dann, who has a different view on things to Baron Huinesoron (specifically, Baron H. thinks Iric is a horrible nation that should never have been made, Baron D. thinks it&#39;s wonderful and barely ever leaves, and Baron J. thinks it was a marvellous idea that went bad, was purged, and then turned against her). Which is right? Probably none of &#39;em.<br><br>Since the Republic is a rather debatable area, I&#39;ve refrained from adding much of the history to its actual entry. All of Baron July&#39;s comments are confined to her personal entry. I <i>will</i> expand the Iric entries at some point, but - as with El-Jheycom - the viewpoints of the various sides will go unmentioned.<br><br>hS</p>

I still wish you had more time to hang out, too, though.<br><br>Um, also, I noticed you locked some of your PPC GDocs.

            <p>I have a question for all of you.  Who here plays the game Diplomacy?  I ask because I haven&#39;t played in about a year and I am looking to get back into it.<br><br>If I were to set up a private game on <a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com">Play Diplomacy</a> would anyone be interested in joining up?  I would need 6 more players to get a game going.<br><br>If you are interested in playing, would 2 days to negotiate with other players and decide on a course of action during the Order and Retreat phases, and a single day to decide on your Builds, work for you?  I really wouldn&#39;t go with less time than that, but I am open to making the turns take longer.<br><br>So, what do you say?  Who wants to take over Europe?<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Tell me, is there a class concerning the differences between book and film canons? Perhaps one taught by, say, Saruman? Or possibly Curumo, I don&#39;t really know the protocol in that regard.<br><br>Still, I can sell stuff to people. It&#39;s the one thing I&#39;m any good at, besides being an unlikeable dick. The Wizards are Maiar in teacherly form; the only reason someone like me wouldn&#39;t be a damp red stain on the carpet in seconds is because of their policy of non-interference. I can likely spin it as a project to determine the exact nature of Middle-Earth-made longarms and their effect upon canon.<br><br>Plus, I&#39;m fairly certain I can get everyone in the Gondorian faction on board. Men desire power above all else, according to various descriptions, and a mixed-arms unit would be a godsend against the forces of Mordor. Boromir&#39;d want them because semi-static emplacements like jezzails and swivel-guns could defend Osgiliath extremely well; Faramir&#39;d want them after he analysed how the Landsknechte fought and how a matchlock musket&#39;d almost certainly punch through trollhide to get to the soft squishy bits to which fast-moving bits of lead are generally anathema. The Congreve rocket was not only a precursor to actual rocket artillery, but was also an incredibly effective means of scaring horses; that&#39;s a major selling point considering you can then rip apart enemy cavalry with your Rohirrim allies.<br><br>Actually, thinking about it, that&#39;s the best selling point of all. Gunpowder weapons, particularly early ones of the kind that, say, the Rangers of Ithilien might cart around with them, were as much terror weapons as anything else. They were <i>loud</i> and <i>scary</i> and <i>bits of my friend are spiraling off in different directions and the sergeant doesn&#39;t have a head any more WHAT IS EVEN THE HELL.</i><br><br>My point is, by putting it like that to the Gondorian staffers and calling it an interesting experiment for the benefit of everyone else, I could probably get away with it if I kept my head down and stipulated that the Lady of the Wood was on no account to turn, if you&#39;ll pardon the use of a relevant Culture term that expresses my disdain for mind-reading, meatf***er.<br><br>No plans to deal with angry mini-Balrogs, though.<br><br>Yet. =]</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t remember one in OFUM 2, but it&#39;s been a long time since I read it (and it&#39;s blocked here). There probably should be, though.<br><br>I agree that you could probably (eh, make that &#39;possibly&#39;) convince some people that gunpowder is worth having. Your main problems would be:<br><br>1/ The connection of the forces of evil with mechanisation. You&#39;d have to hope no-one made the connection - and given that Numenor apparently had ironclads, there may well be a cultural memory that Weapons Which Go Bang Are Evil.<br><br>2/ Faramir would be a difficult sell, because he works in Ithilien. His job is to go <i>unseen</i>, so big heavy weapons which make loud noises and raise a plume of smoke would not be good for him.<br><br>3/ The OFUM staff are somewhat temporally ambiguous. Boromir talks (quite often) about being killed, for example, and Sauron has clear memories of being defeated. So you&#39;re trying to sell them on a war which is already over, probably. The only person you&#39;d have <i>no</i> problem winning over is Sauron - and I don&#39;t think you&#39;d like to do that.<br><br>4/ There&#39;s no way Galadriel&#39;s <i>not</i> going to read your mind on this one. She has ill-defined powers in canon, but in OFUM she can read your every thought, and regularly does so.<br><br><i>Outside</i> the OFUM context, though, I think you&#39;ve got the workings of a fantastic AU here. Maybe gunpowder is a secret held by the dwarves? If so, how would they use it - and how would Sauron react?<br><br>Bonus points for taking the story to Industrialpunk Numenor.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It starts with the fire-lance.<br><br>The earliest blackpowder weapons weren&#39;t guns in the conventional sense. Rather, they were more akin to flamethrowers; basically tubes full of gunpowder on a stick that shot fire everywhere. There are a lot of places this&#39;d be created, probably with mining safety as an original purpose (flammable gases and so forth), but the most obvious pick is Erebor. Think about it for a second: the Dwarves there remember the dragon Smaug, and some of the weirder ones are going to try and replicate that so-destructive dragon fire. They come across some powders that replicate the effects and, by very carefully creating a mixture of the best ones, arrive at something akin to gunpowder. The discovery spreads to the other Dwarf-holds, slowly but in time.<br><br>Now, fire-lances are all well and good, but they&#39;re not as good as they could be at killing Orcs. One dwarf who seizes on this terrible fire-spitting weapon and its potential is Balin, who uses it to take back the tunnels of Moria from Azog and his foul kin. The smiths in his service, and there are doubtless many because Dwarves, refine the process, initially adding shrapnel to the mix but eventually coming up against iron fortifications that are proof against flames. This is how the first of the <i>gathol-karkal</i>, or wallbreakers, comes into being. The first bomb, in other words.<br><br>Slowly, the fire-lances branch between those that use blackpowder as an accelerant and those that use it as a means of propelling sharp things at range. The goblin mind has a kind of animal cunning, and it realises that getting close to the dwarf-fire is bad news, so they become archers and slingers out of necessity. Even the strongest dwarf cannot hurl a throwing-axe with the same range as a bow, so they adapt some fire-lances for this purpose. Originally, these fire-bows launch spears and arrows, but the smarter dwarves see this is inefficient. Stones are carved into sphere and inscribed with runes of hatred and divine retribution, and crews set up to deliver these balls to goblins via wide-bore blackpowder guns.<br><br>These things, tubes upon a staff in the traditional design, are unwieldy in the tight tunnels of goblinfolk, so the design is shortened and the balls are made smaller, with but single runes of loathing carved on each. The firing mechanism improves from tapers to a slow-match, used often in candles to preserve them and grant light (torches around blackpowder being a Bad Idea). This is when the War of the Ring starts - because of this, the Dwarves of Moria are able to put up a much better fight against the Orcs, and the massed firepower of the matchlock musket means Balin is still King. Also, no worries about cave trolls because there are very few left with all their bits still attached.<br><br>Perhaps the Fellowship comes across these Dwarven warriors after Caradhras defeats them and they choose Moria. There, the battle is not yet lost, and Gimli gets his first taste of Morian powderwork. Gandalf&#39;s fireworks know-how will also come in handy; through analysis of them, he gives another terrifying weapon to Balin in exchange for safe passage. Perhaps this is where Boromir&#39;s redemption is foreshadowed; he sees the guns of the Dwarves as a symbol of power and pleads for the knowledge of firearms to be given to Gondor.<br><br>Perhaps Osgiliath does not fall either...<br><br>Meh. I&#39;m just spouting conjecture at this point. =]</p>

            <p>The idea of pinning most of the development on Balin&#39;s colony is a good one - it stops the technology really messing up history (though gunpowder predates the death of Smaug - Gandalf was already famous for his fireworks when he met Bilbo. Maybe it was the dwarves of the <i>Blue Mountains</i> - the exiles of Erebor - who tried to make weapons to match him, but only came up with fireworks?). And the knock-on effects of arming the Fellowship with firearms... ouch.<br><br>(And Galadriel sends an embassy to Moria when she finds out it&#39;s still occupied, and the technology spreads...)<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: &quot;...our darts are like thunder and pass over leagues unerring.&quot; So said the men of Numenor.</p>

            <p>Y&#39;know, that sort of self-aggrandising quote from the Numenoreans just makes me smile. There aren&#39;t cannons made with <i>modern</i> technology that have a range of seven miles, and if darts are taken to mean missiles, well...<br><br>There&#39;s a reason I talked about Congreve rockets as primarily a horse- and animal-scaring technique (I wonder how it&#39;d work on trolls) and not as, well, rocket launchers. The long and the short of it is this: Congreve&#39;s weaponry was about as accurate as a Suefic&#39;s characterisation of Legolas. The use of loud noises to scare horses is well-documented in history (cf. the Khmer mounting massive gongs and bells atop war elephants) and the unguided missile is still more of an area-effect weapon.<br><br>That said, maybe the Numenorean rocket bombs were of a Hale-type design. These were a lot more accurate because of the way the rocket spun in the air. Incidentally, this is why rifled muskets are more accurate than the smoothbore variety, though they do require a bit more preparation and loading time. I&#39;m fairly certain that the men of Numenor would have the wherewithal to create rifled gun barrels, too, so on reflection my earlier laughter was unjustified.<br><br>It&#39;s still arrogant, though. I mean, who do they think they are, <i>elves</i>? =]</p>

            <p>&quot;Before we go in, Pippin, I must warn you not to say anything about Frodo and the Ring,&quot; said Gandalf quietly as they approached the Captain&#39;s quarters of the <i>Minas Tirith</i>. &quot;Commander Denethor is a great man, but as of late he has fallen into the ways of folly.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s not the captain?&quot; asked Pippin.<br><br>&quot;The crew of this ship lost their captain to MOrGUL ages ago,&quot; replied Gandalf. &quot;Since then, the first officer has commanded the ship, passing on the duties to their successors.

At last, one Biker stepped down, and pulled off his tall helm to reveal golden hair.<br><br>“Who are you, and what are you doing in this land?”<br><br>“I am called Strider,” answered Aragorn. “I came out of the North. I am hunting Orcs.”<br><br>The Biker spat on the ground, then leant in to study Aragorn. “At first I thought that you yourselves were Orcs,” he said; “but now I see that it is not so. Indeed you know little of Orcs, if you go hunting them in this fashion. Their enhancements were terrible to look on, and only the lightning may tame them. But there is something strange about you, Strider.” He pushed up his goggles and frowned at the Ranger. “That is no name for a Man that you give. And your cloak – such reactive camoflague must be of elvish make. Are you then of their kind?”<br><br>“No,” said Aragorn. “Only one of us is an Elf.

            <p>Out of all the lands of Middle-earth, the Shire did not adapt to the new ways as readily. Rising from the wastes and ruins of the great kingdom of Arnor, whose cities had been toppled and whose airships had been blown out of the sky by the Enemy, the Shire was a bucolic return to the ways of the past, to green countrysides and pastures long forgotten.<br><br>However, this greenness was defended. A massive wall crafted from the rubble of the fallen cities of Arnor lay around the Shire, nicknamed the Old Forest by those who lived closest to it. From the walls of the Old Forest, the shirrifs defended the Shire and shot down any and all airships that tried to encroach on their airspace. <br><br>There were other cities that sprung up from the lost kingdom, but the illusory wonderland-fortress that was the Shire was one of the more well-known. The Hobbits of the Shire were known to be pacifist and isolationist; they chose to stay out of the ways of the wider world because it had no appeal to them.<br><br>However, that was soon to change, for there would come a time when Hobbits would shape the fortunes of us all.</p>

            <p>It seems only fair I contribute.<br>---<br>&quot;Where the engines of the Elves lie within and without the trees, where the engines of Men rise to the dome of heaven, the engines of Durin&#39;s Folk delve deep within the earth. It is our engines that were first in this Age of the world, and it is our engines that shall save it. So says Balin!&quot;<br><br>&quot;So says the King of Moria!&quot; Frodo was nearly deafened by the throng of Dwarves at the great feast. There were more here than he had ever seen in his life; this was not necessarily a difficult feat, but it was a landmark event for the young Hobbit nonetheless. Idly, he stroked the old oak butt of Sting, the old Elvish hand-cannon that Bilbo had bade him bear against enemies. He looked down, and something caught his eye.<br><br>The serpentine-powder of Moria hissed in its horn, and the barrel of Sting shone blue.<br><br>&quot;ORCS!&quot; He cried, but the drums of war drowned him out. The goblins of Moria were streaming in, armed with vicious toothed blades (some made of actual teeth, probably troll) and the stolen hand-axes of murdered dwarves.<br><br>One roared louder than all, a pale beast the height of a man with but half an arm left, the rest replaced with a vicious hook. King Balin took one of his pistols, of the &quot;axe-handle&quot; design commonplace in Moria and of a larger bore than even the musket Sting, primed the pan with the finest powder known to the Dwarves of Moria, and created a light breeze where said foul goblin&#39;s pitiful amount of brains had once resided. The King threw his pistol to the loader and hefted an axe in his hand, sprinting forwards to meet his ancient enemies face to face.<br><br>Legolas&#39;s arrows struck home in short order too, and the sword of Boromir soon drank goblin blood. But Aragorn stayed with Gimli, who ran, seemingly, from the field.<br><br>&quot;Strider!&quot; Samwise bellowed after him. &quot;Ruddy Rangers, thinking of nought but &#39;emselves. I&#39;ve &#39;alf a mind to give him a bellyful of Gaffer&#39;s best lead!&quot;<br><br>Sawise was, however, soon silenced, as were many. Aragorn and Gimli had run only to the end of the chamber, where there lay a great mound beneath a tarpaulin. The Ranger sucked the last dregs of pleasure from his pipe and upended its contents once his Dwarven host had dragged aside the curtain.<br><br>&quot;Behold,&quot; cried Gimli, &quot;the rocketry of Dwarves!&quot;<br><br>The missiles were lit by Aragorn&#39;s pipe, and soon the goblin attack became an ignominious retreat. Dragonfire beat down their looted shields, and dwerrow-iron shrapnel, cast in the shape of runes of hatred, rent their flesh asunder with every detonating rocket. The goblins were eviscerated... but not yet beaten. Not quite.<br><br>&quot;The drums, the drums in the deep place,&quot; said Pippin once the last of the rockets had exploded and the Fellowship had their hearing back. &quot;The drums are getting closer! Gandalf, what do we do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We fight!&quot; Balin roared as he reloaded one of his pistols. &quot;We fight as though sure of victory ere it should slip our grasp! What manner of foulness have they that can stand to the powder of Moria?&quot;<br><br>Boromir, who had reached the doorway, looked around.<br><br>&quot;They have a Cave Troll.&quot;</p>

            <p>But yeah, that&#39;s a really interesting point. Magic pseudo-steampunk flying dreadnoughts crewed with a well-drilled standing army... that still managed to lose, because Maiar OP nerf now. Perhaps this is where the dwarves get their weaponry ideas from, and why the men of Dale <i>don&#39;t</i> want them; their scholars still remember the fall of Numenor&#39;s men. When Sauron&#39;s forces of Easterlings approach, perhaps then Bard&#39;s great-grandson lays down the bow and picks up a Dwarvish <i>ursunh</i>-staff, complete with axe blade, and turns it upon the Third Age&#39;s fallen men...</p>

            <p>The Nъmenуreans had <i>flying dreadnoughts?</i> Like, giant friggin&#39; metal battleships that soared through the sky over their island fortresses and explored the far reaches of their marvelous fantastical world? Why is <i>that</i> not what people remember from Tolkien? The guy had the biggest influence on the genre of fantasy of anyone who ever lived, so why have I never seen fantasy works with three or four of those suckers fighting off a dragon? I mean, we see all sorts of better-than-you ethereal elven folk living in forests living forever unless they die in battle, and loads and loads of orcs mastered by ancient dark lords, but <i>practically no flying battleships</i>. That is an <i>injustice!</i> I want to see a full-fledged movie/animated series where we can see the Free Peoples of Middle-earth having a high-stakes airship battle with somebody! Let&#39;s check the Tolkien Gateway here to see some of Nъmenуr&#39;s enemies... WHAT. They go to war with the <i>Undying Lands</i>? The last king of Nъmenуr did battle with the Valar, presumably using all of his people&#39;s most advanced technology and resources to do so, and <i>this is not the most well-known thing about Middle-earth</i>? Fledge the months-long walking trip to toss some jewelry into a volcano, this is <i>a fleet of massive flying royal warships going up against the gods themselves!</i><br><br>Okay, Huinesoron, I am officially with you now on Middle-earth being awesome. Everyone is just focusing on the wrong part.</p>

            <p>The reason, sadly, is that both those quotes come from unfinished works that weren&#39;t published until the influence of LotR had become entrenched.<br><br>With ironclads, airships, thunder-missiles, and <i>Alcarondas</i>, the black-and-gold flagship, that is an even more epic fleet than I&#39;d imagined. (So why does <i>Alcarondas</i> have sails and masts? Either Numenor never invented steam power, or it was a deliberate thumbing of the nose to the Eldar - &#39;Look, we have unimaginable technological power, <i>and</i> we can build sailing ships bigger and better than yours&#39;.)<br><br>And how did the invasion end? The Valar <i>dropped a mountain range on them</i>. Or so we&#39;re told, by...<br><br>... by...<br><br>... well, by no-one, actually. The only people who could possibly have brought that information to Middle-earth are the Istari and Glorfindel. And I doubt they&#39;d admit to anything other than &#39;yeah, the Valar crushed them like worms, so don&#39;t try it&#39;.<br><br>So... yeah, you&#39;re right. It needs to be done. But can it be done in writing? I don&#39;t know - and since I can&#39;t draw, that may prevent me from doing anything with it.<br><br>Maybe it should be a game?<br><br>(One tragic point: there&#39;s no suggestion that their airships were <i>metal</i>.

What has celestia done to deserve so much hate? As silly as the Solar Empire can get, the New Lunar Republic is outright rabid with their hatred of Celestia. I have heard more then a few rants on how clearly Celestia is a tyrant who rules over Equestria with an iron hoof, and the only reason we don&#39;t see the world as the dystopia it truly is is because she has, I don&#39;t know, mind control or something. She is a monster who threw her sister onto the moon, for daring to raise concerns on how the country is run. I just... Ugh. So, due to these Luna nutjobs, and genuinely liking Celestia more, I sometimes hang out with the Solar Empire crowd.<br><br>Besides, I think you&#39;ll find that most Solar Empire folks are like minded to me. Only a few think that Luna is still akin to Nightmare Moon, and that those who like her are shrouded in darkness, blah, blah, blah. Still, that&#39;s just my experience. For me, and most others, the whole Solar Empire VS New Lunar Republic is really just a hammy, over the top way of saying which princess you like more.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3ZFeoqvWrM"> Raise the Sun!</a></p>

            <p>...And by that, I mean I have never played Dark Souls before in my life. I&#39;ve heard about it, but I never played it, and probably won&#39;t for a while. Sorry, I just don&#39;t have the time for it. However, I took a look at some videos, and... Wow. That looks like a game I would really, really get into if I let myself. However, to understand who that strange man praising Celestia was, I desided to look him up. I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skV-q5KjrUA">this video</a> to understand, and oh my God, I love this guy. He is kind, chivalrous, and honestly, quite funny at times. I was so sad when I saw that he goes mad later, and you have to kill him. I am thrilled that there is an option to save him from his madness, and I refuse to think the game ended any other way.<br><br>...Dang you, you got me hooked on a game I have never even played!</p>

            <p>Well there are mods to make it more PC (keyboard and mouse) friendly. I play it using keyboard and mouse, although I agree getting the game to actually work and with usable controls was about as much of a challenge as playing the game itself (which I suppose is actually kind of fitting).<br><br>Of course, Dark Souls 2 is now in the works, and is purportedly better designed for PC players.</p>

            <p>Based on what little I&#39;ve read of OFUM so far, I&#39;ll happily join you in tearing the place down.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m biased because I just plain don&#39;t like school stories (not even supposedly good ones like Harry Potter or Waterloo Road), but OFUM seems like a one joke comedy that outstays its welcome pretty quickly.<br><br>Worse, it seems to be based around nothing but hypocrisy.  You have Miss Cam, a blatant Sue (even named after her creator) who freely twists the canon out of all recognition, and makes everyone act totally out of character, and then repeatedly tells students not to create blatant Sues, twist the canon out of recognition, or make anyone act out of character.  Has this woman ever heard of double standards!?!  But never mind, she knows how to use a spellchecker, so apparently that&#39;s all right then!<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s a punishment for trying to <i>write for</i> a series while not being a good author.

            <p>OFUs are merely an excuse to tell people &quot;you suck and we&#39;re going to cause you physical harm until you stop sucking&quot;, which, considering the ban on torturing Sues in the PPC, is perhaps against our ideals. The use of &#39;fangirl&#39; as an insult (putting aside the inherent sexist overtones) denigrates people who are more excited about a series than we ourselves are under the pretext of &quot;standards&quot; - standards which we don&#39;t always reach ourselves (cf. the grammatical mistakes in pretty much every PPC fic, including the Original Series). Besides, I don&#39;t see the point in calling something an official fanfiction university since fanfic is by its very nature unofficial.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s not a bit like the analogy you used. Medicine matters; fanfiction does not. At all. Let&#39;s not kid ourselves. OFUs deliberately treat people as second-class citizens on the basis of <i>how well they write ancillary fiction concerning nine+ people on a team-building exercise in New Zealand</i>. That disgusts me.<br><br>*((&quot;The beatings will continue until morale improves&quot; wouldn&#39;t fit in the subject bar.))</p>

            <p>... are you aware that every &#39;fangirl&#39; who appeared in any OFU was a volunteer? In OFUM itself, you run across people like GreyLadyBast and AW (who&#39;s back around on the Board these days). They&#39;re not real people Cam decided to make fun of - they&#39;re real people who signed up to be made fun of.<br><br><i>people who are more excited about a series than we ourselves are under</i> is an interesting interpretation of &#39;fangirl&#39;, and one that&#39;s totally wrong. I can write in Quenya, Sindarin, and (given a little time) Primitive Quendian; I have <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/index.htm">a website devoted to obscure Tolkien trivia</a>; I&#39;ve used an Elvish name for over ten years; tell me again I&#39;m not excited?<br><br>&#39;Fangirl&#39; is used to refer to the extremely large numbers of, yes, girls - virtually all female (when I joined the Board, there were about 200 members - 5 of us were male) between the ages of, oh, 13 and 20 - who considered Legolas the hottest thing ever, and thought that was the only thing that mattered about LotR. They were <i>not</i> fans of the films - or the books - they were fans of their particular lust object.<br><br>In many OFUs, you will find students who signed up despite being, say, PPC agents - <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9130619/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Discworld">my own OFUDisc</a> has at least four. They get no preferential treatment, except insofar as they rarely get caught trying to sexually assault people, because they have better self-control than that.<br><br>But all of that is beside the point. No-one actually goes to OFUs - they are stories. In the world of the stories, fanfiction matters as much as medicine does in the real world. If we don&#39;t accept arguments like that, then we can throw the PPC out the window (Mary-Sues don&#39;t actually hurt anything, so killing them is murder), along with... well, all of fiction. Sauron can&#39;t actually hurt anyone in the real world, so Frodo shouldn&#39;t have killed him.<br><br>You can&#39;t condemn fictional characters for treating their fiction as important. That&#39;s what they&#39;re for.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Rhetorical (probably), but not sarcastic. Since the PPC <i>does</i> pick on people(&#39;s writing) when they aren&#39;t aware of it, I&#39;m not sure how clear you are on this.<br><br>Also: it&#39;s important to note that most OFUs are written from the POV of <i>a student</i>. Lina Holling is a Legolas fangirl; we&#39;re not sitting in Miss Cam&#39;s office laughing as people get tortured, we&#39;re being beaten up with the students themselves. Otherwise, they would be very different stories.<br><br>(I think, by the way, that at least one PPC Future AU has mentioned the dubious morals of the OFU system.

            <p>I was planning on asking during the next Tolkien-themed thread, but now seems as good an opportunity as any.<br><br>Is there anything about the Lord of the Rings universe that you <i>don&#39;t</i> like, Huinesoron? Or anything that you think could have been handled better, or something that you wish could have been explored in the stories but never was due to either strange choices by the author or the direction of the plot, or any aspects of the storytelling that you thought weren&#39;t the best? I see you talking about its virtues and hidden depths all the time, but I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever heard you imply that it was imperfect in any way other than &quot;If only Tolkien wasn&#39;t dead, he might have been able to answer this question!&quot; Very few people see any work of fiction as entirely without fault, after all, and you seem well-informed enough in the world that I&#39;m pretty sure that you have at least a few comparatively negative opinions.</p>

            <p>He&#39;s probably Tolkien&#39;s favourite character, he takes up huge chunks of the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, and History - and has his own book - and I honestly can&#39;t stand the guy. He&#39;s <i>supposed</i> to be a sympathetic character, I&#39;m certain of it, but I just... can&#39;t empathise with him at all.<br><br>I realise he&#39;s supposed to be cursed, so that all his choices turn to ill, but Morgoth needn&#39;t have bothered. When we first meet adult Turin, he&#39;s an adopted son of the King of Doriath - the most powerful non-Morgoth person in Middle-earth. And what&#39;s the first thing we see him do? React to his mother being insulted by, a) physically assaulting the culprit, and b) when said culprit tries to get even, stripping him naked and hunting him through the woods. He then refuses to place any trust in his foster-father, and instead runs away to become a bandit.<br><br>And <i>everything Turin does</i> is like this. His only reactions to problems are to hit it, or run away and change his name. Why does Nargothrond fall? Because Turin had a bridge built so he could hit things better. And so on.<br><br>Seriously. I would give up ever having heard the name of Turin for a prose-length version of the story of Beren and Luthien, but for some unknown reason, Tolkien preferred the idiot.<br><br>And yeah, there are other things. I&#39;ve <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Theory15.htm">commented recently</a> on Legolas&#39; vision, which apparently sees round corners. And I can never bring myself to look forward to Book 4 - Frodo, Sam, and Gollum taking a walk. I like it when I&#39;m <i>reading</i> it (&quot;Look, Sam, look! The king has got a crown again!&quot;), but leading up to reading it always drags me down.<br><br>Oh, and: I wish Tolkien had actually been able to <i>finish</i> anything. There are so many brilliant stories which are only half-written, because Tolkien got distracted and moved onto something else. Valar preserve us, man, sit down and <i>write</i>, won&#39;t you?<br><br>That answer your question?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Legolas, like all Elves, exists in both the Seen and the Unseen Wolrds; the Round World and the Flat.  How could they sail the Straight Road if they didn&#39;t?

(Although it still doesn&#39;t explain the prohibition on Numenoreans sailing westward out of sight of their homeland, when there was no curvature of the Earth to block the view!)<br><br>And I like Turin.

            <p>But I have another suggestion for you. There is a limit to the number of threads that are visible on the board’s main page, but no limit to the number of replies to these threads. Before starting a new thread, and thus pushing a thread that may still be relevant off the first page, so that nobody ever looks at it again, it’s recommended to check whether there is already an ongoing discussion. There are currently three threads discussing badfic on the upper half of the first page, and your question could have been added to any of them. Please keep this in mind for future requests.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Hi.  I&#39;ve been reading some of your stories, and loving them.  Keep up the good work.  It&#39;s great to see someone standing up for good fanfic and proving that it doesn&#39;t have to be bad.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m just posting to ask if you&#39;ve got any agents who deal with fics in comic strip format?  There&#39;s a Great Gatsby/Harry Potter/Pirates of the Caribbean/Justin Bieber/Adolf Hitler crossover stripfic at: <a href="http://www.toondoo.com/ViewBook.toon?bookid=512921"><a href="http://www.toondoo.com/ViewBook.toon?bookid=512921">http://www.toondoo.com/ViewBook.toon?bookid=512921</a></a> that you might like to look into.  No Sues, thank goodness, but even without them the basic setup alone is just too weird for words!<br></p>

            <p>Another comic-strip fic from ToonDoo:<br><br><a href="http://www.toondoo.com/ViewBook.toon?bookid=299953"><a href="http://www.toondoo.com/ViewBook.toon?bookid=299953">http://www.toondoo.com/ViewBook.toon?bookid=299953</a></a><br><br>This one&#39;s a Pokйmon fic.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know enough about Pokйmon to know how badly it damages the continuum, but it&#39;s still a pretty bad fic by any standards.<br><br>Special highlights include pages 12 and 13, where all the dialogue suddenly repeats for no reason; pages 48-54 inclusive, where everyone slowly takes turns to jump across a chasm one at a time, Terry Nation-style; and pages 93 onwards, where a couple of characters are revealed to have Sue-style Deus-ex-Machina powers.<br><br>(Oh, grammar pedants should note the opening disclaimer says, &quot;I do not not not not own Pokemon!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;  A quadruple negative technically means she does own it.)<br></p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t add anything to the Unclaimed Badfic list.  It&#39;s locked to anyone who doesn&#39;t have permission to edit it.<br><br>Is that the same permission as for writing PPC stories?

            <p>If you don’t intend to vanish again after pointing us to this comic strip (you didn’t make this clear), we would like to know more about you. Frequently asked questions are:<br>What are your fandoms? (Some of as like to give fandom-related welcome gifts.)<br>How did you find us?<br>Did you read TOS? The Constitution? Which spin-offs? OFUs?<br>Do you write?<br><br>Since I don’t know what would be appropriate for you, have an arbitrary gift from the stack of random welcome gifts.<br><br>Concerning your question, I seem to remember that the possibility to do a mission in comic strips or other media has been discussed, but as far as I know nothing ever came from this. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>but the rule (still more like a suggestion, though under revision) mentioned in Article 22 may not be applicable here. This appears to be a Newbie Introduction that just incidentally also links a badfic, and although the intention is not entirely clear, it’s probably a good thing that it isn’t buried in a badfic discussion thread further down the page. <br><br>HG<br></p>

            <p>There was been a <a href="03b%3Fuser_id=16.html">very important discussion</a> going on, which, due in no small part to the Shipfest, has largely gone by the wayside. However, I think that it is very important that it be resolved. If you&#39;re interested, you can check out the discussion itself, but I&#39;ll give a quick summary:<br><br>The discussion dealt with how we should deal with the fact that there are <i>three</i> Pokemon minis (mini-Missingno, mini-Rayquaza, mini-Deoxys).<br><br>Iximaz suggested that Missingno should be the default mini type, to which Phobos concurred, arguing that Missingno has been known to appear as other Pokemon. Outhra disputed that, saying that though Missingno has many forms in-game, it does <i>not</i> take the form of other Pokemon.<br><br>Outhra then brought up the fact that mini-Rayquazas are already PPC canon, as there is a mission that shows mini-Rayquazas, and an interlude in which mini-Rayquazas are mentioned in passing. After Neshomeh mentioned in passing that OFUs sometimes trump PPC missions, the discussion has since devolved into an Outhra-doctorlit dialogue.<br><br>So, the question: What should be done with the Pokemon minis?</p>

            <p>Having thought about it some more, I think the idea of transgressing fanbrats getting mobbed by fragmented data and possibly fossils is funnier than fanbrats being easily overpowered by a dragon-god-thing. Also, I like hS&#39;s logic that it&#39;s something that actually happens if a designation is messed up in-game, making it almost a natural mini, and I like Heironymus&#39; logic that minis are things that should not exist and Missingnos. are that in spades.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S.

            <p>I don&#39;t think anyone is suggesting that anything replace mini-Missingnos. in OPFU, either, seeing as it would be sort of impossible, because none of us is the author.<br><br>I DO think mini-Missingnos. are funnier in an OFU situation, therefore I think they are the better choice, because &quot;how would this mini work in its OFU?&quot; should <i>always</i> be a consideration when choosing one. The concept of minis comes from OFUM, not the PPC. They are an OFU concept that the PPC incorporated because it was funny and because Jay and Acacia were friends with Miss Cam. That&#39;s why OFUs trump missions, not because of any historical precedent of this type of situation. The PPC doesn&#39;t own minis; the OFUs do. We just have them on permanent loan because our respective creators got along really well.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>One:<br>Well-chosen Minis should not be disputable. The expected reaction on First Encounter should be like:<br>“Uh, what? Of course!

To somebody who knows Pokemon only from looking over his daughter’s shoulder several years ago, and followed the linked discussion, the arguments for any of them seem quite interchangeable.

            <p>... are, I believe, zombies. Pretty sure the undead qualify as &#39;shouldn&#39;t exist&#39;.<br><br>And, to expand a little on your point - we&#39;re not talking about things that shouldn&#39;t exist <i>in canon</i>. Obviously, a miniature version of a canonical monster will be based on something that&#39;s in canon. But <i>within</i> the canon, there are things that the good guys - and the readers - agree shouldn&#39;t exist. Demons of flame and shadow. Giant spiders (particularly in Scotland). Wooden boxes with dozens of little legs. Hell-monkeys.<br><br>Dragon-snake demigods who are commemorated in local myth? Robots from space? Or animate skeletons who turn into broken code? I know which I&#39;d choose.<br><br>And yes, &#39;broken code&#39; does still allow them to exist in the physical world. See: Porygon. I argued <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=252925;search_term=porygon">back in January</a> that Porygon is the reason for the lack of internet and general computer skills in Pokeworld - because if one person can code a Porygon, so can everyone else. While it doesn&#39;t exist in canon, there&#39;s a definite space for Missingno here - it&#39;s what happened when someone tried to code a Pokemon... and messed up big time.<br><br>Which is also the explanation for minis - you tried to write a story, but you put the bits together wrong. <br><br>So... Missingno is pretty much a <i>canonical mini</i>: it shows up when the program gets the name of the next Pokemon wrong.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Mini-Deoxys are from OFUK only, and since that appears to be defunct, I think we can drop /that/ idea. Mini-Missigno, as I mentioned in the thread proper, would make very good OFU guards in all their forms because of their glitch powers.

            <p>Mini-Rayquaza made their first and as of yet only appearance in a gamesverse mission, and we can&#39;t switch the two out because Missingno only exist in the games.<br><br>Also, this attribution of &quot;glitch powers&quot; to the mini-Missingno is one of the reasons why I was opposed to the change in the first place that didn&#39;t involve continuity reasons. I admit I used the term myself once, but as a way of summarizing its existing capabilities, not as an excuse for allowing the minis to be able to do unnatural things and attribute them to their glitchy nature. Missingno is nothing special, glitch-wise. It copies the moveset of whatever is sent out to fight it, sometimes, corrupts Hall of Fame data, pretty much all the time, and can teleport, shoot water, attack from the sky, and manifest as a pillar of static. That&#39;s about it. No special powers other than those natural to Pokйmon, no otherworldly abilities, nothing but notoriety.<br><br>No one has any illusions as to what a Rayquaza is. No one has any illusions as to what a Mewtwo is. I don&#39;t expect many people have illusions as to what a Deoxys is, but that may not be entirely certain because its behavior doesn&#39;t exactly scream &quot;mutant space-virus given macroscopic form by radiation&quot;. All three of those could be minis with no real objection from me. People will only make a mini-Missingno more overpowered than its original form was, which is not how minis should operate.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s what I think:<br>Though Phobos&#39; attempt had merit (he tried to create a story that would harmonize all three minis), it fails in that Missingno do <i>not</i> appear as other Pokemon; <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Missingno">there are only eight forms of Missingno.</a><br><br>It would make the most sense to follow the logic of OFAS (the Star Trek OFU)--and what seems to be the default explanation anyway)--namely, leaving the PPC mini alone, but ascribing the OFU minis to the intervention of some powerful being, as the OFUs&#39; coordinators saw Deoxys and Missingo as being more appropriate to policing the OFUs than Rayquaza.</p>

            <p>Because:<br><br>a) It was there right at the start. If the mini is Rayquaza, what did PPC Agents encounter when they went on Pokemon missions before Gen. III existed? There may not be any <i>recorded</i> missions, but RC numbers go up into the millions - there&#39;s tons of agents out there we&#39;ve never heard of.<br><br>b) It <i>isn&#39;t</i> a major canon character. The Balrog, and Aragog, are both pretty minor villains. Memorable, but minor. Rayquaza is a major mythological figure. Missingno, of course, has no canon status either way, which I think is preferable. (Deoxys might be most preferable on this point, actually)<br><br>c) It&#39;s downright adorable. Come on, what would you rather have - a green dragon-snake-thing (yawn) or a miniature skeletal Pokemon which occasionally transforms into a living patch of static?<br><br>d) It seems entirely appropriate for the resolution to &#39;we don&#39;t know what this should be&#39;, to be &#39;what happens when the game doesn&#39;t know what this should be&#39;. ;)<br><br>I, of course, will never do anything in the Pokemon verses, and so have no stake in this at all; but you wanted opinions.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: When Phobos said he remembered one that looked like Kangaskhan, he was likely thinking of <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/%27M_(00)">&#39;M (00)</a>, which a) looks identical to the classic static Missingo, and b) evolves into Kangaskhan. It also shares a type (Bird/Normal) with Missingno. By an amazing coincidence, it&#39;s also exactly the same height as Rayquaza - maybe the agents who thought they saw mini-Rayquazas have a very specific vision problem? :P :P :P<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Reading that article now, I think (colors) &#39;M (colors) is the one I messed around with back then, rather than Missingno.  I wonder what I was doing wrong?

            <p>Before I start, you didn&#39;t do anything wrong, doctorlit. Missingno and &#39;M appear under the same conditions in the same location, and share the same sprite. You probably just found one when you were looking for the other.<br><br>While some of the other points people have been bringing up are very subjective(No, Huinesoron, I do not think that Missingno is more &quot;adorable&quot; than Rayquaza. I&#39;d far prefer a tiny coily sky-snake to a skeletal eurypterid with horrific scythe-like arms that&#39;s prone to exploding with a hiss of static and Rhydon/Bulbasaur-noises into a mess of grayish bio-mist, thank you very much.), I actually like some of them, like how Missingno is, broadly speaking, a canonical mini, since its appearance in-game when the engine runs up against a hex code it doesn&#39;t recognize is similar to how minis are spawned when the Word World meets a name it doesn&#39;t recognize. Never mind that those problems would create the <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bad_Egg">Bad Egg</a> at any time from the Game Boy Color era onward, I suppose, because eggs are boring.<br>When you brought up the Missingno that could turn into a Stantler when traded to Gen II, though, I remembered the <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Johto_guard_glitch">Johto Guard glitch</a>. Basically, there are certain versions of Gold and Silver&#39;s Missingno-equivalent that can mask the presence of other glitches, causing the game to treat those glitches as Pokйmon corresponding to their in-game hex code, which would always be a Pokйmon with a higher Pokйdex number than 151. These masked glitches would be treated as their non-Kanto counterparts by the other game, and would permanently take on the form of that counterpart when traded over. It goes the other way, too, so a non-Kanto Pokйmon could be traded over after being masked and take the form of a glitch.<br><br>So, applying this to an in-universe perspective, when there are two or more minis around at the same time, some of them could potentially cause others to start looking like something else, but they would default back to their primary forms when brought into a new area, or alternatively, a mini-Missingno in its default form could turn into a new species entirely when brought into a new area, which could retroactively explain the mini-Deoxys as mini-Missingno that had been Johto Guard-reformatted, and explain those mini-Rayquaza as mini-Missingno that were masking one another for whatever reason. The forms of the mini-Rayquaza in the mission were shown to be mutable(one sprouted rabbit ears once its capitalization was changed), which might support the idea that the forms are just guises, and cause potential shenanigans for Agents who adopt multiple minis by having the mini-Missingno mask one another as Ursaring or Garbodor or something. It&#39;s almost like Phobos&#39;s idea, but instead of casting Rayquaza as some new form the Missingno take or as an evolution of the minis, it would just be a minor and in most cases temporary glitchy illusion ability.<br><br>It&#39;s not a great fit, but it is a retcon, after all. It&#39;s not going to be perfect. I just wanted to say this because, if we do decide to remove mini-Rayquaza from existence, it&#39;d be nice to have a canonical explanation for what was going on. I wouldn&#39;t want to keep this to myself if it would end up affecting anything. I&#39;m pro-continuity, after all, not pro-Rayquaza. It&#39;s just that up until now there was no way to reconcile pro-continuity with anything but pro-Rayquaza without breaking several rules.<br><br>If we do promote the mini-Missingnos to an in-mission presence, though, we&#39;ll need to ensure that they don&#39;t become too OP due to poor understanding of how they work. A well-written wiki page should help with that, but it&#39;s not going to stop everything.<br>Speaking of wiki pages, have you gotten the Undelete page <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255428">that I mentioned here</a> up and running yet? If you have, we should be able to mark certain pages for deletion, and then get rid of them without fear that doing so would make them unrecoverable.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I&#39;ve actually featured minis quite a bit, doing things in-mission (a mini-Wraith that rebuilt an RA and helped non-techy agents steal a spaceship), and in the RC before and after missions and during interludes (biggest non-comedic relief action being a mini-balrog that dragged an agent out of a fire and later heated fire retardant to get an agent unstuck).<br><br>They&#39;re cool little guys.

            <p>If we retcon the mini-Rayquaza species as a handful of mini-Missingno in illusive guise, would you be willing to Orwellian-edit <a href="http://miah-arthur.livejournal.com/17149.html">your mention of mini-Rayquaza</a> here to mention mini-Missingno instead?

            <p>I spent hours last week looking through old missions trying to find that scene. HOURS. I finally decided that it was something I had never actually put into a finished story. <br><br>I really thought it must have been someone else who had made a mention of them. :P I don&#39;t mind changing it. Part of the joke (in my mind anyway) was that Miah and the other agents involved had shoved all those minis into something the size of a cooler, dropped it off on the unsuspecting agents and then laughed hysterically when they opened it, and all those angry minis poured out. (watching from somewhere mini-proofed, of course.)<br><br>Do you have any suggestions on how to manage a similar effect with the mini-missingnos? It&#39;s part of my headcanon for Agent Miah that she is banned from the Mini Adoption Center over the incident, so when I change it, I still want it to be something annoying and traumatizing to the agents receiving all those minis, and I don&#39;t really understand how these new minis work. <br><br>There is a real fic that was the basis of that joke. Brynjamin, Caddy-Shack, maybe a couple of others, and I talked about doing a mission on it together a long time ago, but never did. <br><br>Oh wow! The fic made it through the ffnet purge! <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5756485/1/Wabloo-Swabloo">Wabloo Swabloo</a><br><br>Also, Doctorlit, Agent Stone was the name of the character who worked in the generic Mini Adoption Center. He&#39;s only been mentioned that one time. Should he be listed as an NPC on the wiki?</p>

            <p>I was actually planning on going on a mission there once I had all of my Permission requests and future plans lined out! Well, going on a mission about five stories into the spin-off. If anyone <i>started out</i> facing Wabloo Swabloo, they&#39;d go insane before they got past six chapters. Which is, judging by the Wabloo Swabloo chapter length, about fifteen sentences.<br><br>Wait, were you planning on missioning it? I found it on the Unclaimed Badfic page, so I didn&#39;t think anyone had a stake in it, and I&#39;ve already had a dramatic climax in mind for months. If you were still planning on it, I suppose I could find something else, but it would take a lot of effort to find something with that little grounding in story structure.<br><br>Actually, the cooler-cramming idea could still work. The action of stuffing the minis in the cooler might even be more efficient than it would with mini-Rayquaza, since mini-Missingno are at least partially spectral, due to their existence both as living data and <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Missingno./RBB8">in some cases as literal ghosts</a>, so Miah would be able to fit even more of them in the same space, and then doctorlit&#39;s idea of the minis all flying out in a stream of pixelly confusion and anger could take effect, with the added bonus that the mini-Missingno would just start getting absolutely everywhere, since their less-than-solid existence means that they&#39;d be less disoriented after crashing into one another and the Adoption Center agents. They&#39;d probably start taking out their frustration on nearby objects afterward, giving Miah time to escape and causing enormous trouble for her victims.<br><br>Where was Agent Stone mentioned? Do you have the link?</p>

            <p>Then maybe we can address a slight discrepancy in the RC numbering. Well, that&#39;s not the best phrasing. It isn&#39;t a discrepancy so much as a blip in RC #4096&#39;s personal history. Namely, that it&#39;s had a lot of it.<br>(breaks out the Continuity Clipboard) The Response Center was first documented <a href="http://tawaki-ppc.livejournal.com/738.html">in the long-running Tawaki spin-off</a>, as the RC of Agent Nicholas Duval. After he married Kamkenta Squee and Tawaki was transferred to the Department of Floaters, Nicholas and his wife worked out of RC #4096 until Nicholas was killed by invaders from the Mirror Multiverse, during which Kamkenta was sent to a PPC TARDIS(in light of current continuity, more likely a Dalek Time Ship that was mistaken for/reformatted as a TARDIS) during the Macrovirus Infestation and partnered with its operator, the humanized Dalek Omicron. The two worked out of RC #4096 until a Gary Stu-related mishap required them to use Omicron&#39;s old time machine to rescue Tawaki and Tadkeeta from Ramandu&#39;s Island in Narnia. The events of that rescue are undocumented, but Omicron brought the two captured Agents back to Headquarters and Kamkenta went MIA. The last documentation of RC #4096 prior to Miah&#39;s use of it was in 2009, with Omicron as its only occupant. Then, in 2010, Miah was shown to work out of that same Response Center, with no Dalek to be seen, and no known partner until Cali Still came along.  <br>Are you thinking what Iii&#39;m thinking? If it was &quot;Miah would have been partnered for a mission with Omicron, or maybe two, before he transferred somewhere else and left the storied RC in Miah and Cali&#39;s hands&quot;, then you were! And maybe... (taps fingertips together nervously) we could co-write that mission? I&#39;ve really enjoyed the Miah/Caddy-shack/Herr Wozzeck shared sub-universe, and I would love to be a part of it. Maybe we could use the opportunity to tie up some loose ends, too, like how Miah and Eileen met.<br><br>Oh, and while we&#39;re talking, I&#39;ve found a few typos in &quot;<a href="http://miah-arthur.livejournal.com/19162.html">McKaloy&#39;s Fortnight</a>&quot;.<br><br><i>Well, I had to get your attention, somehow!</i> There is no need for that second comma.<br><br><i>“ARGH! Owowow” Cadmar flailed a bit from the sudden shooting pain in her leg.</i> Sudden shooting pain should be indicated by some sort of punctuation mark. Perhaps &quot;Owowow!&quot; to indicate continuing pain from the initial &quot;ARGH!&quot;, or simply &quot;Owowow.&quot; to indicate that the initial pain has subsided slightly, but Cadmar still finds its presence unpleasant.<br><br><i>wrapping her arms tightly around Cadmar’s torso and burying her head in the other girls neck.</i> &quot;girls&quot; should have an apostrophe, since it is a neck belonging to one girl instead of multiple girls sharing the same neck.<br><br><i>“Sorry, I’m just glad your alive,” Maria said with a sigh. “I am too, but un... could you maybe not hold me like a baby?” </i> That should be &quot;you&#39;re&quot; rather than &quot;your&quot;. Also, did you mean &quot;um&quot; there? The two keys are right next to each other, so it&#39;s an understandable typo, but &quot;un&quot; does sound like a noise someone would make while in pain, so it could go either way.<br><br><i>So at no time, did you think</i> That comma is not necessary. It belongs a few lines lower, after the word &quot;bit&quot; in <i>Cali felt his grip loosen a bit and he slid an ominous inch.</i><br><br><i>Then McKaLoy said, “Did you see it’s reaction to her?”</i> That should be &quot;its&quot; rather than &quot;it&#39;s&quot;.<br><br><i>Cadmar was sitting on the edges on one of the beds in Medical</i> That should just be &quot;edge&quot;, unless she was on all of the edges simultaneously, which would really hurt to do with a broken leg.<br><br><i>Well, either that or I break both your legs so you can’t run off, either is fine with me, and stop looking nervous, I’d give you morphine first.”</i> There are far too many independent clauses in that sentence. You will need to separate it at least at the &quot;stop looking nervous&quot; section, because that is very run-on, and remove the first &quot;either&quot; because it&#39;s a little redundant. In fact, each of those clauses could carry a sentence on its own, with only minor rephrasing. <u>Well, that or I break both your legs so you can’t run off. Either way is fine with me. Oh, stop looking nervous. I’d give you morphine first.”</u><br><br><i>“Don’t act like you’re scared, I saw your browser history on the laptop!” Maria stuck her tongue out. Cadmar’s eyes widened. “Besides, I’m really glad you’re back, its been way too boring in the RC,</i> Another run-on in the first part(replace that comma after &quot;scared&quot; with a period and it&#39;ll fix right up, though), and you should replace &quot;its&quot; with &quot;it&#39;s&quot; in the second part.<br><br><i>Cadmar looked ready to reply, when the doors opened, and Cali and Miah walked in, in the middle of talking.</i> There are too many commas here, and that last part is phrased a little awkwardly. There are multiple ways to fix this, but what I consider the best solution would be <u>Cadmar looked ready to reply, but the doors opened and Cali and Miah entered, in the middle of a conversation.</u> It takes out the &quot;when&quot;, but I couldn&#39;t think of a way to rearrange the commas and keep it in without restructuring the entire sentence. It still doesn&#39;t read the best, and if I were to remake the whole thing, I&#39;d say <u>Just as Cadmar looked ready to reply, the doors opened and Miah and Cali entered, The two agents seemed to be in the middle of a conversation.</u> Hmm, this has turned more into an after-the-fact beta-reading session more than it has a typo report, hasn&#39;t it?<br><br><i>“A little more forward then on our date...” she said nervously.</i> This should be &quot;than&quot; rather than &quot;then&quot;.<br><br><i>“The portal wrecking menace that we left in our RC with Dann, might explain why you were gone for so long.”</i> &quot;portal wrecking&quot; should have a hyphen between the two words, and that comma should be taken out.<br><br><i>“I mean, We haven’t seen you for a while,</i> Maria uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we">Royal</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTqmajrWe-o"> We</a>? Or, more likely, the W was just capitalized when it should have been lowercase.<br><br><i>This caused Maria is burst out laughing.</i> That &quot;is&quot; should be a &quot;to&quot;.<br><br>And... that&#39;s all, I think. At least, those are all that I caught. While I love your sub-universe, I&#39;ll admit that wherever Cadmar goes, typographical errors seem to follow.</p>

            <p>Or at least, you seemed to imply that it was go. It is go, right? I wouldn&#39;t want to assume in case you hadn&#39;t fully decided.<br><br>Still reading? The Miah/Caddy-shack/Herr Wozzeck sub-universe is one of my favorite things about the PPC!

I think that I have one of her e-mail addresses somewhere... ah, found it.<br>Speaking of e-mail addresses, would you like mine? We are going to need to make plans for this, and it would be best not to do that on the Board. There are plenty of little dangling loose ends to tie up.<br>I don&#39;t think the Tawaki bit is going to be too much of an issue, though. He put up all of his characters for adoption several months ago, and Lily Winterwood and I have been bouncing Omicron and the other Daleks back and forth between us. Well, more her forth than my back, because nothing I write right now is official unless I co-write with someone, but you get the idea. I&#39;ll send Tawaki an e-mail to see if he&#39;d object, but he might not respond. He hasn&#39;t to most of the e-mails I&#39;ve sent.<br><br>Oh, and I&#39;ve found two more typos.

            <p>Sorry, the Mirror Multiverse attacks happened a few months before the Macrovirus Epidemic, which was the event that made people start using TARDISes for a while. One didn&#39;t happen almost immediately after the other. I must have misread something. I guess Kamkenta would have been working out of RC #4096 alone for a while before she met Omicron, then. About a month, if my estimates are correct. (redraws a few lines on the Really Quite Large Timeline Poster) There we go. Now everything&#39;s in the right place.<br>The point of this ordeal is basically that The Lair has a crazy-involved history.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been looking for an excuse to get back into the Wiki, and this seems like a worthwhile sort of endeavor. I might not be able to write too many pages too quickly, but I&#39;ll at least be able to start finding information or uploading pictures or something of the sort. Maybe after/during this project, I can start working on all of the unfinished Flower pages. The Big Monkey Puzzle Tree&#39;s links are probably gone forever with the collapse of GeoCities, but almost everyone else can still be expanded upon.</p>
