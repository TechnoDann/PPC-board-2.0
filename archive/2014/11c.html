            <p>So, after seven months, I&#39;ve finally finished my first mission,and need somebody to beta it. The fic takes place in the Spore canon, so knowledge of the game is necessary, but that&#39;s (thankfully) the only canon involved. I do have to warn though, a side effect of working on it for seven months is that this is a long mission. It came out to about 7250 words, so it will take a bit to get through. Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>So, yeah. Yesterday I saw a TV spot for B5A with &#39;#OneLastTime&#39; plastered all over it. I&#39;ve just found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5t90Nz82dQ">another TV spot</a> which actually features the line &#39;Fight for me - one last time&#39;, and describes it as &#39;the final journey&#39;. And Kaitlyn showed me the video released today (as opposed to the one released last week; this is the version that has actual shots of him singing in it) for Billy Boyd&#39;s &#39;<a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/11/21/the-hobbit-last-goodbye-music-video/">The Last Goodbye</a>&#39;, which features clips not only from <i>The Hobbit</i>, but from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> as well. And it&#39;s like, oh hey, you guys, and you scenes, I remember seeing you all years ago... Weirdly, for me, it&#39;s the shots of Frodo and Sam that hit me the hardest. I miss you guys!<br><br>So... yeah. This is going to be depressing, isn&#39;t it? <br><br>On the other hand, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVAgTiBrrDA">main trailer</a> for B5A is... really something. It looks like they&#39;ve built up Thorin&#39;s relationship with Fili and Kili a lot - &quot;Everything I did, I did for them.&quot; Saruman&#39;s actually in the trailer (and despite the uncanonicity of it, I can&#39;t wait to see him confront Sauron), and hey, giant army of Eldar for the first time lasting longer than ten seconds. That&#39;ll be cool. (Also Elrond with a sword; Elrond is awesome) And yeah, there&#39;s Legolas-states-the-obvious, and only about three Bilbo shots - but they are <i>very</i> Bilbo. And, and, and... yeah.<br><br>BRB, off to cry over videos again. Dang it all, this December is going to <i>hurt</i>...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The problem is, Christopher Tolkien is dead set against releasing any more movie rights, and even though he&#39;s old, one imagines he&#39;s chosen a successor who agrees with him. So for the foreseeable future, the only things any movie (or game, for that matter) is allowed to draw on are:<br><br>-The <i>Lord of the Rings</i> books.<br>-<i>The Hobbit</i>.<br><br>No Silm, no Unfinished Tales, no History, no Children of Hurin (great loss there [/sarcasm]). So yeah.<br><br>I&#39;ve been pondering LotR, and I&#39;m wondering if they could do a trilogy based on the Appendices. I know, I know - but I&#39;m specifically thinking of the fall of Arnor and the last kings of Gondor. The story of Arvedui of Arthedain, and Earnil and Earnur of Gondor, is laid out in quite some detail (enough that it&#39;s made it into several of the games, which are also on a LotR-only license), and there&#39;s a lot of stuff there which is the same kind of thing as people liked in the movies:<br><br>-Romance<br>-Men who look like Aragorn<br>-Prophecies<br>-Arguments<br>-Multiple big battles<br>-The Witch-King of Angmar<br>-There&#39;s even hobbits! Five hundred Hobbit archers were present at the fall of Fornost and the ousting of Arvedui Last-King. So we could still get a sample of that Shire Theme, and a neat reversal when it&#39;s the <i>hobbits</i> who show up unexpectedly, instead of the Elves.<br><br>I think it could work. A lot of the feasibility would depend on whether the White Council aspects of <i>The Hobbit</i> were popular, so if I were New Line, I&#39;d be looking hard at that. I mean, heck - even the Istari are on the scene for that timeframe! Glorfindel plays a major role (blond Eldar are always popular), Thranduil and Legolas could show up in the last film... it&#39;s practically tailor-made.<br><br>If anyone&#39;s interested, I can throw together a breakdown of the story and how I think it could be turned into films; if not, I won&#39;t bother, because time is fleeting, etc etc. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As I am sure everybody on this board is aware, I am not quite the master on the lore of Middle Earth. Indeed, I have not even read LoTR once. That said, though this board, I have learned a little bit more. Enough to raise a strong eyebrow at the idea of a half-wrath who can control orcs with magic. Color me surprised when I see you two talking about how it follows some obscure lore from the series. So, to any of the Tolkien buffs out there, how does Shadow of Mordor hold up lore wise? I know it is a fun game, but how does it fit into Arda&#39;s history? Is it an alternate history that is surprisingly faithful to the original text, or is it a fun game with barely any connection to the world J.R.R. Tolkien crafted?</p>

            <p>The canon elements which <i>Shadow</i> draws on are: a) Celebrimbor, Lord of Eregion, was killed by Sauron, and b) Mordor was once occupied by Gondor. Everything else... is pretty much made up, from what I&#39;ve seen. The Gondorian occupation ended <i>before the line of kings died out</i>, and there&#39;s zero implication that it was anything other than fortresses in the mountains. More specifically, Mordor was under active evil control from just before the death of the last king of Gondor - ie, the fall of Minas Ithil, as seen in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=265658;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Fall of Kings: Throne of Gondor</a>. And at <i>no</i> point was north-western Mordor suitable for farming or whatnot - it&#39;s the hinterland of an active volcano! Srsly. Sauron&#39;s farms were waaaaay down by Nurnen, three times further south of Barad-dur than Minas Tirith.<br><br>As for the half-wraith, orc-control things... no, not really. &#39;Wraith&#39; has a specific meaning in Middle-earth - &#39;mortal who wore a Ring of Power long enough that he passed entirely to the Unseen World&#39;. I&#39;ve not played <i>Shadow</i>, or read any reviews since it came out, but I gather that&#39;s not what happens. And even if it were - magic doesn&#39;t work like that. Galadriel hints that if Frodo could use the Ring properly, he could command the <i>other</i> Ring-wielders, but says nothing about orcs. Sauron&#39;s ability to control orcs has, quite clearly, nothing to do with the Ring - it has to do with him being a demigod, and with the fact that, y&#39;know, his master and mentor <i>created</i> them. And even then, it&#39;s much more &#39;command&#39; than &#39;control&#39;.<br><br>And you can&#39;t resurrect the dead. Even the Dead Men of Dunharrow were never able to physically affect the world - though I suppose that&#39;s not true in the Jacksonverse. Hey, is Talion neon green? That&#39;d be funny. ^_^<br><br>... and I&#39;ve just read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia. Uh... no. Just no. That... no. Oh &#39;Brim, what have they done to you?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Which is to say, rather than being wholly set in book continuity or movieverse, it&#39;s sort of its own thing in the middle that picks and chooses elements from each to do what it will. I&#39;m not sure I approve of that method but it&#39;s probably the one that gives them the most creative freedom. It&#39;s got some cool stuff that ties in with canon though, and really, is the domination of orcs all that different from what Sauron does with his Ring?<br><br>(That question becomes important, all I&#39;ll say.)</p>

            <p>Celebrimbor of Hollin is obviously mentioned in LotR itself (he Drew These Signs, as I recall), and his story is detailed in the Appendices. The data Silm and Unfinished Tales add is that he was a son of Feanor, and/or a smith of Gondolin, and also discusses in more detail the history of Eregion. But as far as I know, Shadow of Mordor draws only on Appendix B.<br><br>So far as I know, there has only ever been one instance where a game company had access to a Silm licence - and they never produced a game out of it. Other than that, CT has kept a tight hold on it. All other game licences have been either Book or Movie - the latter being EA&#39;s licence, which means they can only use things which are in the movies, which is why the protagonists of <i>The Third Age</i> are actually briefly glimpsed background characters from the films.<br><br><a href="http://oneofus.net/2014/09/shadow-of-mordor-will-explore-the-history-of-middle-earth/">This article</a> does claim <i>Shadow</i> draws on Silm - but since it also claims Silm doesn&#39;t mention &#39;Brim&#39;s family, and that... well, this:<br><br>&quot;As a member of the angelic race called the Maiar (the same race of Gandalf the Grey and Saruman the White), Sauron, who called himself Mairon thousands of years ago, had a love of all manner of craftsmanship and forging. Serving the Valar, the superior race residing in the world, Sauron was revered for his scientific knowledge, and was well-respected among his kind. However, open rebellion among the Maiar was stirring, and a Maiar named Melkor was its chief agitator. Eventually taking the name Morgoth, Melkor appealed to the Maiar to join his cause against the Valar. Believing that Morgoth could bring about an era of reformation and creativity, Sauron joined Morgoth and was corrupted by the fallen Maiar’s influence.&quot;<br><br>Ummmmm... right.

            <p>Well, first off, the Estate is under UK, not US copyright laws. ;)<br><br>Secondly, it looks like Malaysia <i>is</i> a signatory to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention">Berne Convention</a>, which says (among other things) that copyright is automatic and extends 50 years after the author&#39;s death. So while you can find loads of ripped-off material there and elsewhere - I seem to recall some wildly popular <i>Harry Potter</i> knockoffs out of Russia? - it&#39;s not legal. And, well... even if it was, it would be <i>immoral</i> to steal Tolkien&#39;s creations, no?<br><br>The mod - well, the mod is based on Estate properties, so no, you couldn&#39;t do anything with that until you stripped out all the Tolkien-created stuff, such as the names. At which point, you&#39;re not making a Middle-earth film any more - just a generic high fantasy flick.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MEFK-LE.png"><br><br>We start in Gondor in 1940 of the Third Age. King Ondoher&#39;s daughter, Firiel (centre), is being courted by two men: Arvedui king[1] of Arnor<a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/right">2</a>, and Earnil[3] Captain of Gondor (left). After some courtship, Firiel chooses Arvedui. Arvedui reforges the alliance between Arnor and Gondor, and he and the king each promise they will aid each other in time of need.<br><br>Cut forward four years, and Gondor is under siege by the Wainriders. Ondoher calls for aid from Arnor, but Arnor is itself under attack. Ondoher has to go into battle with only his own Northern Army of Gondor, though Captain Earnil is marching up from the south with the Southern Army. Ondoher fights a great battle on the Morranon - and loses, and is killed, along with his sons.[4] Earnil then arrives and leads the weaker Southern Army to a crushing victory in the Battle of the Camp, having previously destroyed the <i>other</i> army advancing from Harad.<br><br>With the throne of Gondor vacant, Arvedui tries to make a claim: he says that since his wife is by rights the heir, he should be called on to reunite the two kingdoms. Gondor, however, disagrees, and the Steward crowns the victorious general Earnil as king. Needless to say, this whole section is filled with interpersonal tension between our three leads. We can also make use of a couple of wizards here - say, Gandalf supporting Arvedui&#39;s cause, Saruman supporting Earnil&#39;s (because strength is the most important thing). Saruman, of course, is not yet evil - but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s terribly <i>nice</i>.<br><br>[1] Actually his father is still king at this point, but since Araphant has no role to play in the story, it may be best to cut him. In the original, the marriage is a political one to seal an alliance between the two kingdoms - but romance is more fun.<br><br>[2] Actually Arthedain, the last of the three successor kingdoms to Arnor. I&#39;m using &#39;Arnor&#39; throughout for thematic reasons.<br><br>[3] Actually he has no such role in the story, but he&#39;s not specifically <i>denied</i> this spot. Besides, it makes the later conflict more personal.<br><br>[4] There&#39;s loads of stuff to work with here. Ondoher&#39;s second son was supposed to stay in Minas Anor as regent, but snuck out and joined the army of the proto-Rohirrim (ie, the Eotheod). He ended up getting killed in the Dead Marshes. If we establish him and his brother during the courtship stuff - Firiel is their sister, after all - we could do a lot with this.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MEFK-LKA.png"><br><br>Arnor is celebrating the birth[1] of Aranarth, son of Arvedui and Firiel - but even as the celebrations reach their height, word arrives that the forces of Angmar are on the move again, vaster than ever before seen. Arvedui has to set aside the celebrations and gather everything he can muster to face the Witch-King of Angmar.<br><br>He sends word to Gondor, but receives no reply. He calls on the elves of Lindon (under Cirdan), but Angmar manages to cut them off. The small army of Rivendell, being on the other side of the lines, makes it through, so Elrond is present[2] in Fornost for the siege. Also present are 500 hobbits of the Shire, who arrive unexpectedly and at the last moment[3] - and Gandalf.[4]<br><br>The forces of the Witch-King lock down around Fornost. The siege is long - about two years - but eventually Angmar breaks through the defences. Arvedui leaves his wife and son in Elrond&#39;s care and flees west and north, drawing the Witch-King&#39;s attention away from his heir. He takes the treasures of Arnor with him.<br><br>We have a fairly long semi-chase segment, with Arvedui briefly fighting on the North Downs, hiding in dwarven mines in the mountains, before ultimately being chased all the way up to the Ice-bay of Forochel. He hides with the Lossoth Ice-men until hope of rescue comes by way of a ship from Cirdan. The chief of the Ice-men begs him not to sail, but Arvedui ignores him - and the ship founders, and he drowns, with his two palantiri sinking around him.<br><br>[1] Actually his birth was decades before the Fall of Arthedain, but this is more interesting.<br><br>[2] There doesn&#39;t seem to be any information either way on this, but he&#39;s useful for plot purposes. Bear in mind Celebrian is still around at this point, so we could do something with her, Firiel, Arwen, and Aranarth. We should also send Glorfindel with them.<br><br>[3] This is needlessly dramatic, but fun.<br><br>[4] Whose role in this treatment is entirely made up. I guess he&#39;d escape with Elrond later.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MEFK-TG.png"><br><br>While the elves of Lindon are mourning the loss of Arvedui and the fall of Arnor, and preparing to face the advancing host of Angmar, suddenly a gigantic fleet from Gondor sails into the harbour. Earnur, son of the king, has led them to the aid of Arnor - but he&#39;s too late.<br><br>The armies of Gondor and Lindon ride out against the forces of the Witch-King and crush them utterly. Not a single orc survives. Along the way, they relieve the embattled host of Rivendell, and we get to see Glorfindel and Earnur fight the Witch-King, and drive him off - and we see Glorfindel utter the prophecy that &#39;not by the hand of man will he fall&#39;. Earnur, humiliated by his defeat (the WK spooked his horse ^_^), refuses to listen.<br><br>With Arnor free but destroyed, Earnur returns to Gondor and his father. Very soon, though, messengers come from the north - from the Eotheod, and from Mirkwood (HI, LEGOLAS!): a black shadow passed through their lands, and they fear a new enemy has come, or an old one re-emerged.[1]<br><br>Suddenly, a massive host of orcs erupts from previously-empty Mordor, led by nine Black Riders - the leader of who is none other than the Witch-King of fallen Angmar. They burn their way through Ithilien, heading straight for Minas Ithil. King Earnil elects to meet them there, but in a horrifying battle he is defeated, and killed,[2] and Minas Ithil is taken. The city of the Moon is corrupted, and becomes Minas Morgul.<br><br>From his new stronghold, the Witch-King sends forth a mocking challenge to the newly-crowned Earnur, calling him a coward for failing in Arnor, and claiming his father died a coward&#39;s death - y&#39;know, the usual stuff. Earnur wants to respond, but is persuaded against it by his steward - and then retreats to the tower where the palantir rests.<br><br>Some time later,[3] the WK repeats his challenge, and this time Earnur will not be dissuaded. He rides alone to Minas Morgal, passes through the gates - and we never see him again.<br><br>In Gondor, the people wait for a year for his return, with no luck. Eventually, after some debate, the royal council decide to appoint the Steward as ruler - but he insists on only taking the sceptre &#39;until the return of the king&#39;.<br><br>The last lines in the film are the Steward - his name is Mardil - being asked &#39;What about the line of Isildur? What of the kings of Arnor?&#39; He replies, &#39;That line died with Arvedui. There is no heir of Isildur now.&#39; CUT to Rivendell, where we see Elrond smiling at the small boy Aranarth from the previous film. <i>&quot;Welcome, child. Welcome to Rivendell.&quot;</i><br><br>[1] These messengers are made up for the film, partly as an excuse to put Legolas in, and partly just for dramatic purposes.<br><br>[2] Holy Timeline Compression, Batman! In the book, the Nazgul return in 1980, they take Minas Ithil in 2002, and Earnil dies in 2043. However, since I can&#39;t find any reference to how he actually died, this seems good for film purposes.<br><br>[3] Seven years in canon, but I don&#39;t know what&#39;s best for the film. My image is of Earnur using the palantir in the meantime to mentally duel with the WK, and being weakened a la Denethor.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That&#39;s the one where you go digging around underground, right? The main problem is that, well, you only get the National Dex after finishing the main game. I guess I could do an initial Archosaur Run through (only use Pokemon based on archosaurs, ie, crocodiles, dinosaurs, and birds... though depending on how restrictive that comes out, I might extend it to &#39;all reptiles + birds), and then build a Fossil Team to re-beat the Elite Four... hrm.

            <p>Well, sort of. &#39;Reptiles + birds&#39; gives a total of 48 evolution lines, and a fair few of those are non-evolving legendaries - I count 9 legendaries on my list, which obviously makes building a team with them unlikely. There&#39;s also some... really useless stuff on there.

            <p>The story: Considering I&#39;m a bit biased towards the RSE story, I was very pleased at how faithful they stayed to the originals. 4/5, because they lost the opportunity to really do some fleshing out.<br><br>The surfing: Got quite a lot of it removed, or at least wild Water Pokйmon aren&#39;t as likely to jump you. 5/5, much better this time.<br><br>The Gyms: Despite my Nuzlockeing of Alpha Sapphire, I never had to grind, never had a single death and didn&#39;t break a sweat. No, not even fighting Norman. No, not even fighting the Murdertwins. The levels, Pokйmon, and AI all got walloped by the nerfbat so hard I was almost relieved to be scrambling to fight the E4. 2/5, need more difficulty.<br><br>The E4: I didn&#39;t have any problem until I hit Drake, and that&#39;s mostly because I never got my hands on a decent Ice TM. Still, even Steven nearly took out my highest level &#39;mon, a level 66 Swampert with Earthquake. 4/5, the first was easily beaten by my Dustox and the second two barely hit me. <br><br>The postgame: I&#39;ve only just gotten into this part, but the story kept me rivited and while I wish it was better fleshed out, I still thought it was excellent. There were some nice callbacks to X/Y and it got a bit more into how Mega Evolution works. I&#39;m looking forward to collecting the Mega Stones. 4/5, like in the main story, the plot could be more detailed.<br><br>The graphics: While the 3D was gorgeous, the framerate started to lag with bigger &#39;mons and major cutscenes. Still, there was a bit of an improvement over X/Y. 4/5, because it&#39;s hard to take the villains seriously when they look like chibis and the fact that I couldn&#39;t use 3D in big battles. Also the lack of character customization was a disappointment.<br><br>Overall, I&#39;m going to say 4/5 because while there were some very nice things going for this game, there were some things I think they could have done to make it much better. Definitely a must-have for fellow Pokйmon fans.</p>

            <p>Region of the rollercoaster start - wandering around with my little on-fire bird, I discovered the joy of learning that there&#39;s a really-quite-useful Water-type hanging around nearby... and the horror of realising that there&#39;s a really-useful-when-it-evolves Psychic-type nearby, too... with a low catch rate. Yep, it&#39;s the region of Half An Hour Hunting Ralts.<br><br>That&#39;s in the original, of course. Won&#39;t catch me playing recently-released games - that&#39;s money, and money costs, uh, money.

            <p>Wonderful! Come to think of it, Tomoko was complaining about a banging noise last night; your pizza-nailed-to-the-wall seems to be the explanation. <br><br>Don&#39;t move, I&#39;ll be right over with a housewarming gift.<br><br>- - - -<br><br>Marianne Delacroix closed her smartphone and placed it on the coffee table, gently pushing aside a copy of Pratchett&#39;s <i>Men at Arms</i> as she dis so. The octogenarian agent rose from her armchair while looking around for her grandson. Out of the corner of her eye she spotted the young bowtie-wearing agent in the kitchen, busy preparing vegetables for tonight&#39;s soup. <br><br>&quot;Gaspard! We have a new neighbour. We should go and greet them properly,&quot; said Marianne as she moved towards the door. <br><br>&quot;Yes, grandma!&quot; answered her grandson, putting down his knife and quickly storing the vegetables back in the refrigerator. &quot;Shall I bring something?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. Please bring about a dozen of your molasses cookies. They were a big hit with the DoI senior staff the last time I brought them to share,&quot; said Marianne as she took her pink shawl from the coat hanger by the door and draped it over her shoulders. &quot;Ready?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, grandma!&quot; said Gaspard as he dashed up to his grandmother, biscuit tin in hand. &quot;How far is it? I don&#39;t think &#39;neighbour&#39; is halfway across HQ, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just next door. Oh, where is Tomoko? I swear she was here a second ago...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Left for the gym while you were busy,&quot; said Gaspard. &quot;She should be back in an hour.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excellent. Off we go.&quot;<br><br>The pair walked out of the door and  walked a few metres down the corridor to their right. Before long, the door to RC 20XX loomed before them. Marianne raised a wrinkled hand and knocked tree times at the door. &quot;Hello, Agent Glocker? It&#39;s Marianne from the texts. Are you in there?&quot;</p>

            <p>Ashley trotted back and forth across the room, crossing his arms behind his back and shaking his head lightly as he tried to clear out the cobwebs in his head... and in his room. It looked like it hadn&#39;t been used for a while.<br><br>&quot;Jeeze, way to go Ash. Can&#39;t even keep a hold of your own gear.&quot; He grumbles to himself, looking under the bed in the corner of the room, letting out a sigh of relief as he discovers a green sea-bag laying under it, and yanks it out by the strap, digging into the bag to find something more to wear then the pair of black silk boxer shorts he had woken up in.<br><br>Quickly pulling on a generic black teeshirt and a pair of blue jeans, he glances at himself in the reflection of the console sitting in the center of the room, dark and not yet activated, but awaiting there all the same. &quot;Wish I could figure out how to turn it o-*Knock knock knock*&quot;<br><br>His external monolog is cut off by the knocking at his door, and he turns and walks over, stretching his arms this way and that as Marianne calls out to him. &quot;Yeah. What&#39;s with the &#39;agent&#39; name anyway? I mean, Petty Officer would be my actual title if I could...&quot; His voice trails off as the pain of the hangover hits him again, and he opens up the door to 20XX.<br><br>The human stands at an easy 5&#39;9&quot;, a firm athletic build making him look a little bigger then he actually is, messy, long black hair that was quite clearly out of military regulations spilling across his shoulders and over his eyes, very much bed-mussed.

            <p>((Real life and all of that jazz.))<br><br>- - - <br><br>Marianne and Gaspard sized up their interlocutor. After a quick study of the confused-looking bleary-eyed man in front of them, the senior agent took Ashley&#39;s hand and shook it. &quot;Very pleased to meet you, Agent Glocker-- oh, silly me. You&#39;re new here, right? Perhaps calling you &#39;Agent&#39; is a little premature. But first things first: I am Marianne Delacriox and this is my grandson, Gaspard. We both work in the Department of Intelligence. Gaspard, if you please...&quot;<br><br>The junior agent offered the biscuit tin to Ashley. &quot;Here you go, sir. Fresh-backed molasses cookies-- a dozen of them.&quot;<br><br>Marianne continued: &quot;I might as well cut to the chase. You probably managed to slip through a crack in the fabric of reality and ended up here, in our Headquarters. This building transcends dimensions and intersects with a near-infinite number of universes. These universes are in fact the &#39;fictional&#39; worlds that exist on Earth as novels or video games. For example, it is possible for us to travel to... er... Gaspard. Example, please.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Equestria,&quot; said Gaspard with barely a moment&#39;s delay.<br><br>&quot;Very well. Using a controlled transdimensional portal, we can travel from here to Equestria and interact directly with any character we meet there. However, there is a cosmic force that threatens nearly all of the so-called Word Worlds. Poorly written fanfictions on Earth spawn entities known to us as &#39;Mary Sues&#39;. These creatures plague the Word Worlds, twisting the plot so that they can fulfill their fantasies. Simply put, our organization hunts these creatures to preserve the integrity of these worlds. Do you want to join?&quot;<br><br>&quot;If you don&#39;t want to join us, we&#39;ll just need to take you down to Medical so that they can... ah, make sure you don&#39;t carry anything back from HQ that might endanger earth. Like an alien disease or forbidden knowledge, for example,&quot; added Gaspard.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Ashley blinks and takes the biscuit tin. &quot;Uh... thanks.&quot; He says as Marianne continues, idly opening the tin and taking out one of the cookies as he listens, and slowly eats one as the elder woman and the younger agent explain the situation to him.<br><br>&quot;... Soooo let me get this straight. While drinking, I somehow pushed myself between space and time, ended up at a party in this... HQ, you called it? Was assigned a room, lost my cellphone, was given this...&quot; Ashley holds up the device he had been texting on, &quot;As a replacement, and am currently standing somewhere inside what could be described as the greatest adventuring job ever, and simply by being here I can get a job?&quot;<br><br>Ashley rubs his chin, humming for a moment before shrugging. &quot;Sure.

            <p>Ashley taps his chin, quickly setting the tin of cookies aside as he quickly falls in with Gaspard and Marainne, easily keeping the brisk pace.<br><br>&quot;I think I remember this &#39;armory&#39; you&#39;re talking about. There was some pretty weird stuff in there, for sure, but when I mentioned my missing phone they just handed me this and said something about filling out paperwork later.&quot; He says, walking alongside, idly stretching his arms.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find it later.&quot; He says, glancing around at his surroundings. &quot;Jeeze, might as well be back on the Carrier... gray gray gray and surprise!

            <p>Gaspard cleared his throat. &quot;There are three types of departments in this place: action, infrastructure, or security. Action departments are the ones that venture into the multiverse to fix problems. For example agents of the DMS-- Department of Mary Sues-- document how a Suvian creature disrupts the world, charge it, and assassinate it. DIC-- Implausible Crossovers-- untangle universes that have been mashed together. DBS-- Bad Slash-- go after badly-written slash stories and exorcise participants, who are possessed by Sue Wraiths. DF-- Floaters-- is an in-between department for agents who have yet to specialize in one particular area.<br><br>&quot;Infrastructure departments make sure that Headquarters works. There are loads of them: DoSAT-- Sufficiently Advanced technology-- designs, manufactures, and maintains all of the tech that we use. Operations keeps HQ and all of its inhabitants fed, clothed, and housed. Medical, Finance, Postal-- well, they&#39;re all pretty self-explanatory. We also have a psychological support department-- FicPsych. DoI-- Intelligence-- researches fanfics for potential targets. <br><br>&quot;Finally, the two security departments handle threats that come from both within and without. Internal Affairs is HQ&#39;s police-cum-SWAT force. External Security is a Flowers-only force that keeps HQ&#39;s exits secure.&quot;<br><br>Marianne looked over her shoulder at Ashley. &quot;Ah, yes. At this point I feel obliged to point out that our bosses are actually giant sentient flowers. They came from some doomed planet from some corner of the multiverse and built HQ using their technology. We&#39;re taking you to the Marquis de Sod, the daisy in charge of the Department of Personnel.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Any more questions, sir?&quot; asked Gaspard. &quot;Another protip: like we said, HQ is spread over multiple dimensions and one of them has to do with consciousness. Essentially, the chance of arriving at where you want to go is inversely proportional to how much you think about it. It pays to be distracted here.&quot;</p>

            <p>((Exam season is upon us over here, so sorry if my posts are far and few in between.))<br><br>&quot;Yes, actual flowers,&quot; confirmed Marianne. &quot;Or more specifically, <i>Flowers</i>, note the capital F. They&#39;re mostly Earth species too; we&#39;re not quite sure how that happened. They&#39;re quite tall, wear clothes like people and speak to us telepathically. I suggest you prepare yourself for a shock when you meet the Marquis; it&#39;s rather disquieting the first time you meet a Flower in person. As a whole, they tend to be rather irritable as well. I suggest you try and not provoke the ire of one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Si-- Mr. Glocker,&quot; said Gaspard, &quot;what department do you think you&#39;ll join? The Marquis will probably ask you what you&#39;re doing here. If you say you don&#39;t know, there&#39;s a chance you might get assigned to Operations or some other infrastructure department. According to the latest gossip, there&#39;s a shortage of janitors and D-Ops is looking to recruit. And as always, Intel is understaffed...&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>Ash rubs his chin, humming lightly. &quot;I was security forces when I was in the Navy. I started in Aviation, and spent a good stint as a life-support equipment maintainer, before becoming a MA and working security. Honestly, my skillset is set a lot more towards... well, violence.&quot;<br><br>The sailor nods firmly. &quot;I think overall, the &#39;Floaters&#39; sound best to me, if only because I&#39;m interested in a very wide array of story and fanfiction, and tend to be a pretty quick study if I don&#39;t know anything about a... you called them word-worlds, yes?

            <p>&quot;I have one final piece of advice for you,&quot; she said. &quot;When you approach the Marquis for a job, be sure to mention if you intend to return to World One-- Earth, that is. If you say &#39;yes&#39;, they will probably suspend your aging like they did with me, my daughter, her husband, and my grandson and timestamp your arrival so that you can retire to your proper place and time on Earth. Otherwise...&quot; she made a vague hand gesture. &quot;I guess you&#39;ll be staying here for a while.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And on the subject of World One-- please keep in touch with your relatives if you intend to stay here, Mr. Glocker,&quot; added Gaspard. &quot;It&#39;s so much nicer for them to know where you are and who you work for.&quot;<br><br>The trio stopped in front of a large door marked with a brass plate reading &quot;DEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL&quot; and a torn sticky note underneath that added &quot;the marquis is a huge --&quot;. Marianne turned to face Ashley.<br><br>&quot;Well, here we are young man. You go on ahead without us-- this is <i>your</i> business after all. We&#39;ll head on back to our Response Centre and enjoy the rest of your downtime. If ever you need help or need to speak to someone, just head next door to RC 22. I&#39;ll be there.&quot; The grandmother offered her hand to the sailor. &quot;Welcome to the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, Mr. Glocker. Good hunting.&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>&quot;My only real clue is that our activator is gone, too.  So . . . Doc apparently—Doc is my partner, by the way—Doc went somewhere, got these &#39;mingos, brought them back, and then went to a different somewhere.<br><br>&quot;Of course, it&#39;s equally possible that Doc went looking for something in HQ, someone&#39;s pet Atog came in and ate the RA, and a plothole dumped the flamingos here.  So.&quot;  Vania shrugged.  &quot;Not much to go on, really.  Any ideas?&quot;</p>

            <p>Rina ran her fingers though her hair. &quot;Possibly something like in the <i>Doctor Who</i> episode <i>Fear Her</i>, where some powerful being drew these flamingos into your room, or at least dumped them here. Or maybe someone, perhaps Doc, is playing a prank on you like you mentioned.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course,&quot; she said, shrugging as well, &quot;it&#39;s also possible your RA blew up for some reason and its exploding opened a portal just long enough for all these flamingos to fall through. Strange it pulled forty-seven instead of forty-two, but it&#39;s possible the number was random. We&#39;d probably want to track down Doc first, does that sound good?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;See, Doc was, uh, drunk last night.  Um, he had had a Butterbeer at Rudi&#39;s, and they have almost no alcohol content, but I guess Doc didn&#39;t know that and is also a super-lightweight?  And the second I mentioned that Butterbeers contain alcohol, it suddenly hit him.  Not sure how that worked.<br><br>&quot;But anyway, the point is Doc might be . . . DRUNK PORTALLING.  If that&#39;s true, though, the console will have a history recorded of every set of coordinates our RA has accessed.  Which is totally a thing consoles have always had.  So!  Let me look through the history for unfamiliar coordinates.  Would you mind checking the flamingos in the meantime, see if there are any clues where they came from?&quot;<br><br>((I&#39;m currently bunking at my parents&#39; house, due to my condo filling with smoke from a not-dangerously-near fire.

            <p>Gerry looked up the moment she received the reply; it&#39;d figure it wasn&#39;t Denny who got the message. He wouldn&#39;t have taken it nearly as well, which was part of the point. She and Colt sometimes liked to see who could get him wound up, which wasn&#39;t all that hard at times, even if it was all just friendly stuff. <br><br>She scoped around the Lounge (still keeping a mental note where the ginger and gay guy were) before she spotted someone who hadn&#39;t been in earlier and looked like they were probably the right person. When she did, she loped over, a bit of a smirk on her face. Combined with her fairly aquiline features and the whiptight braid, it made her look more like she was on the hunt than anything else. The flash patch indicating that she was part of BM and the handgun holstered at her side did nothing to dissuade that impression.  <br><br>&quot;Robinson?&quot; She asked. <br></p>

            <p>True to her word, she was trying not to be noticed as she looked for Nume and Ilraen. She wasn&#39;t entirely sure why anyone would peg Nume as &quot;the gay guy,&quot; unless it was something about his personal grooming standards and slightly outdated fashion sense, but the off-putting redhead <i>had</i> to be Ilraen in human morph. She didn&#39;t see them around the bar, which was Nume&#39;s usual haunt, but it looked like there was some sort of screening happening at the other end of the room. Maybe they were over there.<br><br>Her investigation was interrupted when an impressive-looking woman came up to her.<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot; Jenni answered, blinking in surprise at being addressed. &quot;Are you Gerry, then?&quot;</p>

            <p>At this point she&#39;d been part of BM longer than she had been an assassin, but she had still hung out with her former partner and friends in DMS after the forced transfer to hear talk about the people in Medical and FicPsych. At least until most of them went crazy from the work, anyways. Or disappeared into a high fantasy continuum, never to be seen again. (But Parks had never been really entirely there in the first place.) <br><br>Names tended to come up, and the reputations attached to them, and Robinson had been an overall more than okay one, even if the group she used to move with was fairly wary of FicPsych and Medical in general (especially after she had been essentially allergic to Sues of all things).<br><br>&quot;So, they&#39;re friends of yours?&quot; She nodded in the direction where she had last spotted them.</p>

            <p>Jenni looked into the crowd where Gerry had indicated. Yup, she&#39;d recognize the backs of those two heads anywhere. She could see that Nume was holding a large bag of popcorn in what was apparently a self-restraint exercise for his partner. As she watched, Ilraen leaned toward the bag, as if drawn by some invisible string, and when his hand got too close, Nume slapped it. Not hard enough to make a loud noise, but enough to startle Ilraen into remembering himself.<br><br>The nurse grinned. &quot;Yep. Supernumerary and Ilraen, DIC.

            <p>I am always bad at these &quot;introduce yourself&quot; posts, but I&#39;ll try.<br><br>Hello. I&#39;m TheShyIon. The username is based on a misspelling of a different screen name I use- &quot;ioncoy,&quot; when the actual username is &quot;iomccoy.&quot; I probably didn&#39;t need to explain that. I write much better when I&#39;m not talking about myself, I swear! :P<br><br>I am also fourteen at the moment. Yes, I realize that that&#39;s prime Sue age. I hit mine at eleven or twelve, but I don&#39;t *think* I ever drew any PPC attention. (If anyone ever killed a storm-Alicorn-Princess-on-the-run with a golden apple somehow involved, let me know. I&#39;d like to thank them.)<br><br>My main fandoms are Discworld and MLP:FiM. I know of and enjoy, but am not up to date on: Avatar: The Legend of Korra, Young Wizards (and thank something that my fics for this never saw the light of day,) and RWBY.<br><br>I&#39;ve read the Hunger Games and Catching Fire but have neither read not have any desire to read Mockingjay. <br><br>I will also note that I am on the Autism Spectrum, and so may have issues interpreting things on occasion. If it seems like I didn&#39;t understand what you meant, I probably didn&#39;t. :)<br><br>I&#39;m also trying to break myself from an ellipsis addiction. If I start overusing them, feel free to tease me about it. I have a strange taste for some of the less-NSFW sorts of really terrible badfic, too, which might be why I&#39;m here in the first place. Badfic led to reading MSTs, which led to the original series of the PPC, which led to marathoning the rest of the PPC. Not *every* PPC mission, of course, but a lot of them. <br><br>Did I make this way too long? I can never judge that with these introduction post things. </p>

Thank you!<br><br>On Sue-awareness: Yeah, having everyone else you know who writes &#39;fic (though I haven&#39;t in a while- decided I was going to improve first so I didn&#39;t spawn any more Sues) in their prime Sue ages is annoying.

            <p>Thank you for the virtual gifts! <br><br>I tend to remember characters more than authors- for agents, Kaitlyn and Selene are my favorites, I know Huinsoren did them because I read last Wednesday&#39;s post.

            <p>We all know that time on the internet moves way faster than in the Real World - that&#39;s how I can be considered ancient despite only having been here ten years (which really isn&#39;t that long). Those ten years of mini-Boarders must be the equivalent of millions; the species <i>Miniscula boardari</i> has simply evolved in response to its changing environment. Perhaps we should designate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronospecies">chronospecies</a> as <i>M. boardari tedii</i> and <i>M. boardari hominii</i> - though I&#39;m not convinced using subspecies nomenclature is appropriate. As seen, Huinsoren still retains the old form, as do all my minis, so we seem to have full-on speciation. Perhaps <i>M. boardari</i> is the modern species, and <i>M. autori</i> is the older variety?<br><br>The genus <i>Miniscula</i> - which includes all minis, including of course <i>M. valarauka</i>, the mini-Balrog - is of course found in family <i>Typographica</i>, order <i>Inadvertian</i>, class <i>Fandominus</i>, phylum <i>Literati</i>, kingdom <i>Imaginorium</i>, domain <i>Inventio</i>.<br><br>Taking a look at our <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sue_Latin_Names">Sue Latin Names</a> article, it&#39;s clear that Suvians fall in the class <i>Fandominus</i>. There&#39;s then an order <i>Caractorian</i>, which covers all intentional characters in fandom, within which is the family <i>Puella</i>, which includes all Suvians.<br><br><i>Puella</i> is divided primarily into genuses <i>Viatormundorum</i> - world-hopping Suvians - and <i>Indigenamundus</i> - native Suvians. For each of these, there are two species, named in both cases (because Suvians delight in messing up nice neat science) <i>perficipulchrituda</i> - perfect and flawless Suvians - and <i>infidimediocris</i> - the ones who are specifically described as not perfect.<br><br>In other words, your Suvian&#39;s species is defined by where it comes from, and how &#39;perfect&#39; it is. There are then myriad sub-species, including <i>V. perficipulchrituda mellis</i>, the sickly-sweet perfect world-hopper, and <i>I. infidimediocris gladius</i>, the homely warrior-Sue (closely related to <i>I. i. aggressor</i>; the DMSE&amp;R is attempting to isolate the differences between &#39;warrior&#39; and &#39;anger problems&#39;, but isn&#39;t having much luck).<br><br>And one for luck: the Flowers, if we accept them as being fictional, must be class <i>Fandominus</i>, order <i>Caractorian</i>, family <i>Protectiflora</i>. Genus and species names are as for their Real World equivalents, with sub-species <i>sapiens</i>.<br><br>And I&#39;m pretty sure we could do with moving over to a more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics">cladistic</a> approach - splitting <i>Protectiflora</i> directly off from <i>Caractorian</i> is ridiculous, since it implies the Flowers are just as closely connected to Suvians as they are to agents. But we&#39;ll leave that for another time.<br><br>(Who wants to work up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogenetic tree</a> for <i>Inventio</i>? ^_^)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>On the one hand, the idea of finally seeing an operational Jurassic Park (outside of <i>Operation Genesis</i>, which was admittedly pretty cool) is amazing. On the other hand, I&#39;ve kind of been sold on the idea of feathers looking awesome, so - particularly those I-Can&#39;t-Believe-It&#39;s-Not-Gallimimus - they look very plucked-turkey to me. So, y&#39;know.<br><br>Because the original &#39;wow&#39; factor of JP was that it was <i>way</i> more accurate than we&#39;d ever seen before. This is... like running into a group which used to be amazingly liberal-minded, but has retained the exact same mindset while the world around it changed, and ended up as arch-conservative throwbacks. (Probably because that&#39;s exactly what it is...?) Therapod dinosaurs had - <i>have</i> - feathers. The movies should really accept that.<br><br>But still - ignoring the occasional naked therapod, and no doubt other archaic scientific inaccuracies (like, did you know, there&#39;s <i>no non-avian dinosaurs alive today!</i> You&#39;d think the film would get that right! [/tongue in cheek]), it&#39;s still unspeakably cool-looking. Even if I did spend the first half of the trailer going &#39;this is a really bad idea, Park Guys...&#39;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As excited as I am to see this movie (it comes out on my birth-month just like the original), I&#39;m honestly ashamed to see how polarizing it&#39;s become, especially with the rising prominence of feathered dinosaurs in public entertainment media. On the one hand we have those who view the first movie as a challenge to public perception of actual dinosaurs, at least during its release date, and insist that the new one should&#39;ve done the same; on the other, we have those who prefer he dated aesthetic the franchise has. It&#39;s sad to see this kind of lose-lose situation in which Hollywood can&#39;t even do anything without half the fandom losing their sh!t, but I guess it&#39;s par for the course as far as movies these days go.<br><br>Being a &#39;positives first&#39; sort of bird, though, I&#39;ll remain optimistic overall. The effects and creature designs are the first thing I look forward to, and the trailer didn&#39;t disappoint in that category. I am genuinely interested in where the franchise will go with this new direction.<br><br>arvalis aka grimchild on Tumblr makes the awesomest dino art and you know it. Ditto for realistic Pokemon interpretations, too - the Aerodactyyl one is my personal favorite.</p>

This year, that means a movie marathon at the Boston Common starting at 12:30pm on December 15th. <br><br>The TORN staffer originally in charge of the line party has recently moved to the west coast. This means, that the person currently in charge of the logistics for the Hobbit line party in Boston...is me. Scary, I know.<br><br>Now, for the bad news. I just started a new job and most likely will only be able to make it to the <i>Battle of Five Armies</i>, not the whole marathon, as I do not have enough time saved up for this. (I could pretend to be sick, I suppose...). So, I could really use an all-hands-on-deck approach to getting this show on the road. Any Boston PPCers feel like pitching in? Your help will be greatly appreciated!<br><br>Araeph</p>

            <p>By some miracle, I actually have the 15th and 16th off, so if I can find an early overnight flight from Arizona, I should be able to make it in time for the start of the marathon.<br><br>Now, to be honest, I&#39;ve never done a plane flight alone before, so I&#39;m over my head and nervous and trying to piece this together as I go.  I have a few questions:<br><br>Is the Boston Common within walking distance of any airports?  &#39;Cause I&#39;d rather not spend money on a rental car if I don&#39;t have to.  Alternately, if there are any local PPCers would be willing to pick me up at an airport (and drop me off again eventually, I guess), that would be fantastically appreciated!<br><br>Second, would anyone be willing to put up with me staying at their place for the night of the 15th?  Again, money is tight, so I don&#39;t want to do a hotel.  I realize that, not having actually met before, folks may not want to invite me into their home (I could be a vampire, after all), so I&#39;ll understand if no one is comfortable doing that.  I just need to know if I should book an overnight flight for my return trip.<br><br>Also, um.  I&#39;m willing to help anyway I can, but what exactly will we be doing?  I&#39;ve never heard of a line party before, and my people skills aren&#39;t . . . very developed.  So what&#39;s the general plan for the event?</p>

            <p>OK, so I asked the members of One White Tree if they would be going to the marathon, and it turns out the majority of them would rather attend the movie at 7:00pm on Opening Tuesday instead of Marathon Monday. That would be Tuesday, December 16th, at 7:00 pm Eastern time. <br><br>The Boston Common is two stop on the Red Line subway up from South Station, which has a shuttle bus (complete with luggage racks) directly to and from Logan airport. I don&#39;t have a car, unfortunately. :( I also have a roommate who would most likely not be OK with a third guest. <br><br>Mostly we&#39;ll be standing around (in or out of costume) talking about our love for the Hobbit and LOTR. I&#39;ve never hosted a line party, either, so it should be interesting. There will be LOTR trivia and prizes, however!</p>

            <p>That would be Tuesday night instead of the Monday marathon, or in addition to it?<br><br>And how long before and after the movie on Tuesday do you want me there?<br><br>I&#39;m sorry to keep pestering you for details, but I&#39;ve never traveled alone before, and I&#39;m being rather neurotic.</p>

            <p>With luck, I&#39;ll be at the line party around 5:30 pm. I have to finalize things with my sister, though, because I&#39;m taking her to see it, too. If the movie starts at 7:00, that puts us at around 10:00 for the movie&#39;s ending. I&#39;ll have to see what Sis feels like doing after that. Fortunately, the T (subway) doesn&#39;t shut down until 12:30 or later, so if you&#39;re renting a hotel room, you&#39;d have plenty of time to get back.</p>

            <p>Hellos there!<br><br>I just wanted to start by saying thank you for your service. =)<br><br>Is the only reason you haven&#39;t gotten through other episodes of Doctor Who is that you just haven&#39;t had a chance to? I can understand that, I&#39;ve only recently started watching the episodes in order after catching a few episodes here and there.  Blink is one of my favorite episodes, although angel statues now scare the beejoobies out of me.  If you&#39;re limited on time, I&#39;m sure some PPC person or another will be able to give you a good list of episodes to watch!  </p>

            <p>Partially that, partially because there is so many other things I want to read, and mostly because fanfiction, books, and video games take almost all of my &#39;media&#39; time. I don&#39;t really watch TV (the Armed Forces Network leaves something to be desired) and beyond owning all the MLP episodes on iTunes, Netflix is still negotiating with Japan&#39;s Media groups to work out here, so Netflix isn&#39;t really an option, and honestly, I don&#39;t understand torrenting or how it works and don&#39;t really trust it, especially when Brick is pretty much my only option for internet right now.<br><br>... Oh, right. Brick 4.0 is my hand made ASUS G-Series gaming laptop. She&#39;s a little outdated now, but I literally put her together myself, as I have with every laptop I&#39;ve owned... And all of them have been named Brick.</p>

I&#39;m more then happy to do what I do. I mean, shoot, I get to live in Japan! Sure, deployments suck, but hey, it just makes my job that much more satisfying when I get off of deployment, especially when I come back to updates of my favorite comics and fics and get to download them for reading material for next cruise.<br><br>Which also is why it&#39;s so important to me that the PPC&#39;s work exists and why when I looked into it I just had to join in in some form or fashion. After all, badfics aren&#39;t fun to read if you can&#39;t switch to a bunch of good fics because that&#39;s all you had downloaded and you won&#39;t get internet access for the next month or two.</p>

            <p>For the uninitiated, Dreamhack is a big tournament featuring various games (League of Legends, Starcraft, Counter-Strike, etc.) and teams from all over the world. <br><br>Anyways, fnatic, a 5-man team that is currently under scrutiny because 2 of its players are accused of cheating by the community at large has just won a semifinal game, bumping off LDLC by using a super-sketchy <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AROrw0u.jpg">boost</a>. Normally, you&#39;re able to jump on ledges (or even on other teammates!) to be able to peek over things-- that&#39;s how the game works. But in this case, there isn&#39;t <b>supposed</b> to be a ledge where KRIMZ is standing and olofmeister was able to see virtually the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AFVdPGT.png?1">entire map</a> from his vantage point, enabling his team to consistently intercept LDLC and to prevent them from winning a single round. It also didn&#39;t help that he bought the auto-sniper, a 2-shot kill weapon and was raining death on LDLC during the entire half. <br><br>I swear, if the Dreamhack staff doesn&#39;t disqualify fnatic for these shenanigans, there&#39;s going to be a riot on the CS:GO subreddit...<br><br><br><br>...yeah, sorry. Needed somebody to complain to. Any other Counter-Strike PPCers here?</p>

            <p>Hey. Yeah, I&#39;m not really into the scene myself though I dabble in striking.<br><br>However, this recently came up to my attention from one of my friends who&#39;s huge into the pro gaming scene (I just focus on League of Legends, I don&#39;t really have enough time for a million different competitive games) and according to him, it&#39;s not even &#39;accused&#39; anymore, it&#39;s straight confirmed, and it&#39;s not just fnatic, which by the way is making me grind my teeth because they sponsor a great LoL team which I always enjoy watching (The Summer LCS was great) but now this?<br><br>I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re playing at, but it&#39;s bullsh... uh... horseapples. Yeah.<br><br>Hackers at the pro level.</p>

            <p>Yeah, a lot of pros suspect flusha and olofmeister of using hardware cheats to very slightly improve their aim-- things like a 10% aim correction that might be considered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF0BGlNDu_Q">flick shot</a> 99.9% of the time. flusha is super sketchy and almost certainly cheating while most people are on the fence with olofmeister&#39;s case. <br><br>Anyways, Dreamhack set up a rematch for LDLC and fnatic but the latter forfeited, allowing the Frenchmen to move on to the finals. It looks like fnatic are trying to salvage what little honour they have left and to cut their losses ASAP.<br><br><br>Also: how&#39;s LoL? Guessing from Dreamhack&#39;s viewer count it&#39;s even bigger than CS:GO (which is astounding because GO has been growing exponentially since last year). I heard quite a few things about the game but I&#39;m absolutely rubbish at MOBAs. Who&#39;s your favourite champion?</p>

            <p>That&#39;s... quite a crowd. Also: is South Korea the main LoL powerhouse? Given that many famous StarCraft players come from South Korea, I can see some of the micromanagement skills easily transferring from SC to LoL.<br><br>I also watched a couple of the League animatics. Pretty good stuff, but I  don&#39;t think they represent gameplay as accurately as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh99WBY45EI">this</a> <s>parodic</s> trailer.</p>

            <p>South Korea&#39;s got a lot of good players, but so does China, the US, Great Britain, and a few other places. It&#39;s really a world-wide game at the moment.<br><br>And no, the animations don&#39;t represent gameplay that accurately, but they are fun to watch.<br></p>

            <p>And something to consider in so far as... well, not so much &#39;badfic&#39; but very far out-of-character fic goes.<br><br>Ahem, anyway...<br><br><br>Being in the military, I use Fanfic and MLP:FiM and all the other shows and games I love as a way to unwind and decompress after my work shift. There&#39;s a lot of good stuff out there that takes some serious digging to get to, and most of it I take in stride.<br><br>But, something I&#39;ve always had trouble dealing with is -The Feels-. Not because I don&#39;t mind the emotions it brings or a well crafted feel-fest, [s]nor because it sometimes makes me curl up in a corner hugging my Twilight plushie because I feel so damn lonely...[/s]<br><br>... Right, strike that line out.<br><br>No, it bothers me because some of these feel fests, in particular the one I wish to share today, one that I have a love/hate relation with, is just beautiful because I can relate with the story on a few different levels that I don&#39;t want to talk about, but also because it&#39;s simply well told, but pisses me off because it&#39;s really, really, REALLY out of character/in character.<br><br>Said story (more comic, now animation with ok voice acting) is &#39;I&#39;m So Proud of You&#39;, or the &#39;Fluttershy is Chicken&#39;s Mom Theory&#39;.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arSl2Y1ob5I"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arSl2Y1ob5I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arSl2Y1ob5I</a></a><br><br>Go ahead, watch it, get some feels maybe, go hug your loved ones and come back. I&#39;ll wait.<br><br>You back? Cool.<br><br>So back to the point, sorta kinda, is this thought- in so far as PPC goes, how does something like &#39;I&#39;m So Proud of You&#39; rate in so far as fic goes?<br><br>Again, it&#39;s not a -bad- fic persay. Honestly, I&#39;d even go so far to say as it&#39;s good, if not great for what it is. But the OOCness of Fluttershy for what caused her pregnancy is just loop-de-loopin&#39; out there.<br><br>Blugh. I dunno. Just wanted to put my thoughts down and maybe start up a conversation. It&#39;s kinda boring lurking if no one&#39;s talking...</p>

            <p>I was reading through the permission prompts, mainly because I was marathoning the wiki and ran across them. There were two in particular that caught my attention- a Flower joining the agents on a mission, or one agent attempting to impersonate a Flower. My brain then filled with an intense, sudden longing to read that. <br><br>I was wondering if anyone who had one of those when they applied would like to/is allowed to share? ^_^<br><br>(If this isn&#39;t something I&#39;m supposed to ask, I apologize. :] )</p>

            <p>I apologize for not responding sooner - I went to see How To Train Your Dragon 2 a second time in the local theater yesterday (I would *highly* recommend visiting the HTTYD continuum in a future mission btw), and ended up doing graduate research until one in the morning! Anyway, I think everybody&#39;s covered any proofreading we may have missed (I was going to correct it myself but I see you&#39;ve taken care of it), so I&#39;ll probably go into some general topics.<br><br>For Miguel&#39;s abilities, direct time travel may be a little overboard, but I do imagine that a limited version of such a skill may make traveling through badfics a little bit easier (though not very much). You won&#39;t need an RA to skip past scene shifts, for example, but you will need one both to enter/exit the badfic and to jump to a different location. It may be possible that in a badfic, Miguel could skip only one or two chapters at the very farthest, if they&#39;re not important, but in general he&#39;d probably go past only a scene or two. At least it&#39;ll make dodging Author&#39;s Notes easier, though.<br><br>I&#39;m actually not interested in adopting any of the mini-Missingno, sorry to say - I already have a whole bunch of mini-Omnidroids, a mini-Sentinel, a mini-T. rex, a Spellcheck Scrat, and an Attack on Titan mini I accidentally spawned myself during a post on the Board (Eren Yager, I think). Since my collab with Desdendelle also deals with Pokemon, that technically means I&#39;ll have already adopted one mini-Missingno by the time we&#39;re done with that (though it&#39;s probably gonna take a while, due to responsibilities on both sides).<br><br>One little issue, however... I was honestly surprised to see you post this thing without getting a third person to beta-read it. Granted, there were two of us working on it, but I usually get at least two beta readers for the missions I write solo (And speaking of which, I wonder why haven&#39;t PoorCynic and Iximaz beta-read my first DMS mission yet? I remember the latter being more punctual for that Teen Titans mission I did last month...). I&#39;ll let you off on this time because I didn&#39;t see too many things wrong with this mission, Board-caught typos aside, but please remember to have your missions beta-read before posting them. I&#39;d be happy to serve as a beta-reader, in fact - you know my e-mail address so contacting me shouldn&#39;t be too much of an issue.<br><br>Regardless, great job, and best of luck with your future endeavors! :D</p>

            <p>Firstly, and no offence meant, but are you sure that the fic takes place in the game continuum, because I&#39;ve had a quick flick through and I can&#39;t see it stated anywhere for definite. The reason I&#39;m asking this is because in the anime continuum, I believe Pokemon can learn more than four moves at once, although they can&#39;t use more than 4 different moves in any single battle. <br>Secondly when the Sue is scanned by the Pokedex it&#39;s said that her stats are vastly underleveled, when in fact except for her Attack and her Defense (which are actually at an acheivable level for a Level 10 Mew) the rest of her stats are overleveled, some by a small amount (Special Defence) some by a larger amount (Special Attack and HP) and Speed is ignored completely (something which isn&#39;t even picked up). Using a Stat Calculator that I know is very reliable this is a Level 10 Mews Stats with Max EVs and IVs and a neutral nature. <br>HP 49, Atk 34, Def 34, SpA 34, SpD 34, Spd 34 compared ot the fics stats which are HP 65, Atk 34, Def 33, SpA 54, SpD 38.<br><br>Otherwise well done.<br></p>

            <p>Hmm...well, we assumed the game-verse for simplicity&#39;s sake, but it could just as well have been an anime-verse fic too. I think it was in the Pokйmon game section on the Pit.<br><br>As to the stat thing...we had no idea what the Sue&#39;s level and nature and whatnot were, and so just worked off of Mew&#39;s base stats (according to Bulbapedia). Thanks for the advice; I&#39;ll pay closer attention to which version of Pokйmon the fic takes place in next time for sure :)</p>

I thought you overdid it a bit on the infodumping between the three agents - in particular, Chris would every so often just flat out ask to be infodumped about random things, including Ami&#39;s history, which was quote jarring - but in general, it worked well. Falchion slipped between competent and newbie pretty convincingly, and the new kids felt, well, new. I also really liked the Pokemon battle at the beginning - fun stuff.<br><br>Also, mini-Missingno are adorable. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Two things I&#39;ve been meaning to ask...<br><br>1) Have you beta read my DMS mission yet? I would swear I sent the draft to you a while ago - I wonder if I should send it again?<br><br>And 2) I was actually thinking if an interlude taking place prior to eatpraylove&#39;s mission with Falchion making friends with someone else&#39;s agents. I wonder if you&#39;d be interested in helping out? It would be nice for my agents to be familiar with another author&#39;s for once prior to a collab mission. If so, I can start something up for us both sometime this week.</p>

            <p>Not bad for a first outing. And Arceus, did that Sue make absolutely no sense! Why would a pair of Pokйmon hide out as humans? How--and <b>WHY</b>--would said Pokйmon imprison others in an apartment complex&#39;s basement? And if you&#39;re a Pokйmon, then <i>for what reason</i> are you going on a Trainer journey?! I&#39;d understand a journey to figure out how to turn back into a human, but a Trainer journey? Again, why?!<br><br>*deep breaths*<br><br>Either way, good work on this mission. Not too long, and it got the job done.<br><br>There are a few errors, however:<br><br><i>Not having the tilde over the e in Pokйmon is understandable...</i><br>Wrong word, there. The &quot;tilde&quot; is that little squiggly symbol that goes above the N in certain Spanish words (i.e., this symbol: ~ ).<br>The marking that you <i>wanted</i> to talk about is this one: ґ<br><i>This</i> marking is called an &quot;acute accent&quot;. However, it would make sense to just say &quot;accent&quot;; unless the language being referred to has multiple accents, the word &quot;accent&quot; by itself usually implies the acute accent (of course, that is when the word is used of an accent marking, as opposed to a speaker&#39;s accent).<br><br><i>a sheep-like Pokйmon with fluffy cream-colored wool and a blue head/legs.</i><br>That description is a bit awkward: it seems to say that its head <i>is</i> its legs. What you really want to say is that both its legs and its head are blue.<br>Therefore, just say so. Consider this fix: <i>a sheep-like Pokйmon with fluffy cream-colored wool, a bare, blue-skinned head, and similarly-colored legs.</i><br><br><i>I didn&#39;t warn her about the gruesome death of the Character Replacement we were supposed to kill.</i><br>Memory serving, not!Ludlow was one of multiple Character Replacements in the fic, yes? In that case, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to change the article? That is, say &quot;<b>a</b> Character Replacement,&quot; as opposed to &quot;<b>the</b> Character Replacement.&quot;<br><br><i>He’d done it right; the Sue’s apartment complex was clearly visible through the portal. “Miguel, would you mind carrying Mareep this time?” Ami asked.</i><br>Minor nitpick here: I think a paragraph break between the two sentences would be in order. Remember that the previous paragraph focused on Falchion, and this paragraph starts of with the results of Falchion&#39;s efforts. To have the same paragraph inexplicably switch to Ami is a bit disorienting.<br><br><i>Falchion instinctively blocked the attack with his large wingspan before tossing the RA to Chris. It was lucky that in the Pokйmon games, Normal-types are immune to Ghost-type attacks.</i><br>I was a bit confused when I first saw this sentence; it took me a while to remember that Falchion was disguised as a Fearow in this mission. You might want to make that fact a bit more explicit.<br><br><i>She struck out with a Stomp attack at Replacement!Mewtwo, kicking him into the wall behind him, but at the same time, a Shadow Ball caught her in the chest and sent her sprawling, somehow <b>forced</b> back into her human form.</i><br>That bolded word should be &quot;forcing&quot;; you&#39;re using it as a participle here.</p>

            <p>The last piece of advice, to be exact.<br><br>In short: completely ignore it.<br><br>The long version: I thought that there was a word there that really was not actually there.<br>Recall the sentence as written: <i>She struck out with a Stomp attack at Replacement!Mewtwo, kicking him into the wall behind him, but at the same time, a Shadow Ball caught her in the chest and sent her sprawling, somehow forced back into her human form.</i><br><br>Here is what I thought it read:<br><i>She struck out with a Stomp attack at Replacement!Mewtwo, kicking him into the wall behind him, but at the same time, a Shadow Ball caught her in the chest and sent her sprawling, somehow forced <b>her</b> back into her human form.</i><br><br>Had that word actually been there, then the subject of that clause would be the Shadow Ball, and the verb should have been &quot;forcing&quot;, not &quot;forced.&quot; However, since that word was acutally <i>not</i> there, the subject is clearly Brenda, and the verb is in the correct form as written.<br><br>Sorry for the mixup.</p>

            <p>I spent most of the month slightly behind and caught up right before the end, finished in time. I think I have something I can actually publish this time, with a lot of revisions. Though for some reason, the hardest part of revising, for me, is this urge to change <i>everything</i>.<br><br>Right now it&#39;s a fantasy novella set in a quasi-Asian medieval world, about a young ninja-esque warrior who has an affair with a princess that results in a baby and a very angry king. He ends up fleeing across several countries trying to take care of his daughter, and because he keeps getting into trouble and helping people out, accidentally turns into a kind of Robin Hood figure.</p>

            <p>My &#39;revisions&#39; alternate between refusing to do it at all, and complete rewrites.

            <p>Like, <i>barely</i> finished - I <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/participants/huinesoron/novels/the-words-of-the-voice">clocked in</a> at 50k + 83 words. ^<em>^ Of course, since I wasn&#39;t planning on doing NaNo at <i>all</i>, that&#39;s a pretty good result.<br><br>As I&#39;ve <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=265691;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">noted before,</a> this is The Unpublishable NaNo. It consists of a pseudo-mythology wherein scientific effects are described in detail, and then vaguely attributed to a deity. Well, and then it turns into a thing where scientific <i>advances</i> are due to deific meddling - vaccines, anaesthesia, and Florence Nightingale&#39;s nursing school were all the result of a competition between three of the five deities of medicine. ^</em>^<br><br>Then coupled on the end of most chapters is a commentary by a professor studying the book, who serves both as my way to explain the more allegorical portions of it, and as an excuse to create a side story about academic rivalry.<br><br>And of course, since it&#39;s all vaguely inspired by Greek mythology, there&#39;s a whole bunch of sex-and-violence, along with clever mortals tricking the gods, gods falling in love with mortals, gifts, blessings, inventions, and long-winded conversations in fake Shakespearean style.<br><br>Though I think it may be the only mythology in which the gods spend all their time &#39;ravishing&#39; people - and then get put on trial for it by the God of Lawyers, and sentenced, and actually have to fulfil their sentences... yeah, it&#39;s a bit strange.<br><br>(I also see that CreateSpace are offering two free copies of your novel to all winners; might have to see what the catch is on that one, because this would be a hilarious book to own in the flesh. ^_^)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... by &#39;unpublishable&#39;, I mean &#39;no publisher in their right mind would pick it up&#39;. It falls so far outside any established genre it can&#39;t even see them, and for most of its length, it&#39;s basically pure world-building. People have compared it to <i>The Silmarillion</i> - which was equally unpublishable until <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> had made people eager for any and all Tolkien works. (And then it was unpublishable because Tolkien was incapable of calling it finished, but that&#39;s another story)<br><br>As an example of the more world-buildy parts, this comes from a sequence of nine Answers of Cariad:<br><br><hr>
<br><br><u>XXVII. The Fifth Answer of Cariad</u><br><br>One who once worshipped a false goddess of fire asked of Cariad, “What are the greatest deeds of Tвn, of whom you have told us?” And Cariad thought on this, and pondered long. And then in the dark of the night she knelt before the altar and called upon Ennyn, and sought of her knowledge.<br><br>And when the next evening came came Cariad met with her followers, and explained the truth of things; and this is what she told them:<br><br>The first great deed of Tвn was that she was born; for against each of us coming to be stand a multitude of possibilities. Each human is unique upon the world, and the slightest change in the course of the world would have rendered each of us as dust on the wind.<br><br>The second great deed of Tвn was that she grew to an adult; for in the days before the birth of the entwined three did many of the children of humanity die in their infancy, and looked not upon the world with their waking minds.<br><br>The third great deed of Tвn was that she became skilled in the crafts of humanity; for in that time but few of those who dwell in the House of Bod had come to be, and of those who bless humankind with skills, only Cynhyrch yet stood upon the earth. Nevertheless did Tвn become wise in the ways of stone-shaping, and of hunting, and of gathering food from the trees and shrubs around.<br><br>The fourth great deed of Tвn was that she stood when others fled, and spoke with Ennyn of the flames, and was given by her the fire which humanity has treasured ever since. Yet she spoke not the name of Ennyn thereafter, and claimed ever that she had found fire of her own accord; and this is accounted the fifth great deed of Tвn. For Ennyn at that time was bitter and cruel, and sought only to harm humanity; and only now that her punishment is complete, and she rejoices in the love of Cynhyrch, and works for the good of humanity, is her name to be spoken.<br><br>Now the sixth great deed of Tвn was that, returning with fire to her tribe, she sought to understand it. For the minds of humanity are meant to study and to learn, yet many forsake those paths and choose only to accept what they are given. And by her understanding did Tвn preserve her tribe: for the place where they dwelt was besieged by fire from lightning, and the people fled in terror. Yet Tвn, knowing that fire even as beast requires air to breath, smothered the flames; and knowing that fire fears water, she cast the river into its path; and knowing that fire feeds on wood, she drew back the litter of the forest floor. And thus was the advance of the fire stayed, and the tribe of Tвn preserved; and this is accounted the seventh great deed of Tвn.<br><br>The eighth great deed of Tвn was that she took of the fire and made her tribe great. For even as wildfire may destroy the forest and set humanity to flight, so Tвn saw that fire in her hand would bring terror to her enemies. And so were the great beasts which hunted the tribe of Tвn driven forth; and so also were those humans who were not humans, who sought to destroy the tribe of Tвn; and the humans of Tвn’s tribe lived in peace.<br><br>The ninth great deed of Tвn was that she brought the fire to the realms of peace; for Cynhyrch whispered to her by the light of the fire, and Tвn was taught to cook her meat, and render it better for humans to eat. And at the time she knew not who had guided her; but those who dwell in the House of Bod knew, and speak of it still.<br><br>And the tenth and final great deed of Tвn was that, in the fulness of time, having lived by the accounting of her people a long life, she died; and all the fragments of her soul were scattered among humanity, and humans were enriched thereby; and so did humanity prosper, and become great, even the greatest of all the life on the Earth.<br><br><i>Commentary by Professor Trottier<br><br>As with the Fourth Answer, Cariad reveals more than was outlined in Tвn’s chapter of <u>The Words of the Voice</u>. Professor Miller notes that Tвn’s use of fire is hinted at in said chapter, when Cynhyrch gives the gift of cooking to counter the destructive power given by Ennyn; this, however, is the only place it is explicitly described.<br><br>Doctor Preuss claims that the great deeds of Tвn are ‘illogical, wildly separated in time, and on occasion flatly impossible’. She has not, however, put forward any proof of her claims, and as such, can safely be ignored.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>It&#39;s a complex mess of names (seriously, I had to keep a running appendix to help me track them) which often wanders off onto wild tangents, and just... yeah, that.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Congrats, PoorCynic! <br><br>I may have read &quot;*blows into a party noisemaker*&quot; as &quot;*turns into a party noisemaker*&quot; for a moment, there. Which would have led to wondering where the badfic came from, because when people start turning into things, badfic can&#39;t be far away. :P<br><br>If presents are things you want, have an invisible kitten! (Not to be confused with the nonexistent kitten I gave a fellow newbie.) ^_^</p>
