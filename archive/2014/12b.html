            <p>Name is doctorlit, code is 2277-7567-7254.<br><br>Hm.  We need to get Maslab and Plat from the chatroom to join in . . .<br><br>I&#39;ve only got two badges myself, so it&#39;ll be a while before I get to partake in the Friend Safari, but at least you guys can make use of my code.  (I&#39;m one of those weirdos who actually likes level-grinding, and does it one at a time, no experience sharing, Rare Candies are sell-high items to me.  It takes me a while to get through an RPG.)<br><br>Also, anyone want a Machamp?  I grinded a Machop into a Machoke for the Pokédex, but I want to use my Machamp from White Version instead.  So the Machoke/Machamp is up for grabs, first come, first served.</p>

Grass is one of my favorite types.  (Which is ironic, since in real life, plants are my most hated enemies.)  Sorry about that third slot.  Like I said, I play slow, so don&#39;t expect those to get filled in anytime soon.  I didn&#39;t beat either Gen V story-line until after X and Y came out . . .</p>

            <p>It&#39;s the potential for it to break the Evasion Clause I believe. Although it does have the ability to produce incredible buffs and the drops can be counteracted by using the right moves, (attack drop, using Swords Dance, or Power-up Punch or Bulk up or...) and then with the buffs it works absolute wonders on baton pasing teams, so if you get a drop in Special Defense baton pass out to whoever your Specially Defensive pokemon is on your team with Calm Mind or Amnesia to get read of the drop, for example.    </p>

            <p>Unless she has a danger sense that will warn her about tasteless sleeping pills, it should be possible to knock her out by mixing them with her food. Then pull out some nerve gas - I see sarin takes less than ten minutes to kill. And the best part? You can technically charge her while she&#39;s asleep.<br><br>Or... let&#39;s see. Methods for dealing with overpowered magical beings:<br><br>-Reality Room - negate her magic.<br>-Distraction - set fire to the forest or whatever, then stab her in the back while she&#39;s putting out the fires.<br>-Betrayal - pose as her friend, and use your position to implement one of the other methods.<br>-Chemical/biological agents, as discussed.<br>-A tripwire, and a large rock to hit her head on. Can she levitate? Can she do so in half a second?<br>-A bottomless pit. Though not if she can fly. Or teleport, I guess.<br>-Bury her twenty miles underground - head down. Even if she can blast her way out, she&#39;ll probably end up going deeper into the earth instead of out. Does she need to breathe? Though I suppose teleport might be her preferred option.<br>-Concentrated canon bombardment. Shove her into a television shop with the HP movies showing on every screen.<br>-Bring an agent who doesn&#39;t need to breathe, and get her to chase them through a portal to the ocean/space/wherever. Though again, teleportation might negate this.<br>-LSD. Dose her with hallucinogens and kill her while she thinks you&#39;re marzipan.<br>-GRR RAR USE TEH BIG WEPPONS TAHTS TEH ONLI WAI oh wait.<br>-Logic bomb. Meticulously point out all her logic holes (while not physically attacking her) and keep going until she implodes.<br>-Redemption. Befriend her, sit down with her, and calmly discuss the problem with Mary-Sues. Show her examples. Make her realise the problem, then get her to realise that her own nature is identical to what she&#39;s just condemned. Prepare to utterly horrify the Marquis de Sod.<br>-Redemption with a twist. Do all of the above, then when she vows to never use her magic again, say, &quot;Good,&quot; and stab her in the throat.<br>-Guillotine. Disguise it, put something she wants in the basket, then activate when she leans across.<br><br>&amp;c&amp;c&amp;c. To my mind, the best response to an uber-Sue is to find an utterly cheesy and silly way to kill her, not to try for similar levels of power. Think &#39;tear laura apart by geographical expansion&#39;, not &#39;kill Celebrian by suicide bombing&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>(Though I thought the Sue had to be awake when charging? Oh well.)<br><br>Anyway, not even half of these crossed my mind. Seriously, these are all so... brilliant. I had a half-formed plan involving using canon sources to set up a ward that her uncanon powers couldn&#39;t cross and keep her contained while charging, then either mob her with agents or blow her up. But flooding the area with nerve gas? Now that&#39;s something...<br><br>See, Rose eventually becomes an expert Legillimens, so trying to lie to her would fail if she was charged after reaching that point. And the really big things that pin her story as Legendary Badfic happen when she starts getting über-powerful.<br><br>Death by being forcibly-dressed would be pretty funny.<br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read Hitchups end to end before. Not actually sure I&#39;d call it badfic. There is some OOC, but it mostly feels natural from the events that occur. I know the fanfic has faults, but Hiccup doesn&#39;t really hit the marks of Suedom.<br><br></p>

            <p>So much RWBY badfic around. My personal list got 5 from one fanfiction.net trip. <br><br>I now cannot read badfic without composing a charge list in my head. The one on the top of my list includes &quot;forcing a Mini to play the role of a corporation due to repeated improper capitalization.&quot; I mean, I&#39;ve seen Minis playing a character.<br><br>Said badfic also includes charged of &quot;creating the evil sorceress Glinda Good Bitch&quot; and &quot;creating Mrs. Dominatrix.&quot; <br><br>Yes, both in reference to Glinda Goodwitch. Which probably counts as Glinda bashing as well as Weiss bashing. And causing Weiss to swear, I think. And causing Nora to become an &quot;insane bitch.&quot; And turning Team RWBY into Team RWBYX.

            <p>That&#39;s something I&#39;ve seen a lot at the Circle of Lemmings.

            <p>According to TV Tropes (the <i>other</i> Source of All Knowledge), the Vocaloids are basically animated actors in all the MVs, which explains why their personalities change so drastically between songs <strike>(and why Len dies so often)</strike>. <br><br>Fans, however, have created basic personalities for them based off their art, voice, and occasionally behavior in MVs; Kaito is usually portrayed as a goofy manchild, for example, while Gumi and Rin are boisterous if immature and Len and/or Luka are the sane ones. (More info can be found here: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Vocaloid"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Vocaloid">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Vocaloid</a></a>)<br><br>Until Crypton Future Media/BPlats/Internet Co Ltd./whatever other company says something to the contrary, I think the safe thing to do would be to accept said fanon personalities as canon unless, as you said, you&#39;re dealing with a fic set in a specific mini-verse like the Story of Evil series. </p>

            <p>I feel FNaF has been covered pretty solidly by these replies, and I know nothing about Vocaloid, so...<br><br>Prototype! I think that continuum may need to be handled by the ESAS by default, considering how extremely powerful the normal canon residents are. If a Sue were a being like Mercer, it would absolutely require the use of ESAS personnel anyway, as your average agent wouldn&#39;t be able to handle them without a huge risk to themselves and the PPC.<br><br>Either way, it would be a VERY risky mission... and that can make for some great reading and writing in the right hands!</p>

            <p>Part of this is that I don&#39;t think the APD gets enough love, admittedly (also, it lessens the implication that ESAS agents are simply &quot;better&quot; than those not in the department and doesn&#39;t limit people&#39;s writing options), but by definition a division of the All-Purpose Department specialises in tackling its assigned continua and all their relevant quirks - a Star Wars Division agent is expected (and theoretically trained) to handle Force-using Sues and Stus, which are basically godlike threats in themselves, for example. Plus, dealing with the hammer of an uber-powered character like say, Mercer, is something that with creativity doesn&#39;t necessarily require just getting a <i>bigger</i> hammer - the player can be killed by the USMC enemies in Prototype, right? Some regular agent having to figure out how to deal with that kind of threat could make quite an interesting story.</p>

            <p>If a) a missionable fic in one of these continua ever surfaces and b) someone actually decides to take it on, that will be their headache. It might be best just to avoid them.<br><br>If you&#39;re actually considering it, though, it&#39;s just a matter of charging for what&#39;s chargeable, working with what you&#39;ve got, and not worrying about anything else. If there is no canon characterization, you can&#39;t charge for OOCness, but you can still charge for bad characterization and all the other hallmarks of terrible writing. If you&#39;re in a dangerous world, then you better just take extra care not to blow your cover. A little creativity will solve your Sue-disposal problems: Freddy&#39;s is basically a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant, but even more horrifying, right? So there&#39;s a kitchen full of sharp objects and sources of fire, and there are dumpsters out back, or maybe a sewer entrance. If you can&#39;t work with that, you&#39;re not trying hard enough. {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m making a thing. Can&#39;t tell you what it is, it&#39;ll ruin the fun. I just need to know two things. One, what do you think is a music track that’s really suited to the PPC?

            <p>It&#39;s twelve days before Christmas, and I figure it&#39;s a good time to rev up the ol&#39; <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Filk">filking</a> engine and have some fun. ^_^<br><br>If you&#39;re unfamiliar with this game, it works like this:<br><br>0. No, you don&#39;t need Permission.<br>1. Pick a seasonal tune that strikes your fancy—anything you like, even if it&#39;s been used for this before.<br>2. Write new words for it with a PPC theme.<br>2a. As usual, I encourage you to seek for a topic that does not involve Sue-slaying, because we have <i>lots</i> of filks about that. If that&#39;s what the muse dictates, though, go for it.<br>3. Post your filk here in this thread for us to enjoy and comment on.<br>4. If so inclined, share a recording of yourself singing a filk or two.<br>5. When all&#39;s said, sung, and done, I&#39;ll add this year&#39;s entries to the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/">PPC Holiday Songbook</a> (unless you specify that you don&#39;t want me to).<br><br>And that&#39;s pretty much it. {= ) Happy filking, everyone!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>After &quot;I&#39;ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm&quot; by Irving Berlin(!), although I was following the Doris Day lyrics as <a href="http://lyrics.wikia.com/Doris_Day%3AI've_Got_My_Love_To_Keep_Me_Warm">recorded here.</a>  The original song is actually quite repetitive, so I&#39;ve loosened up the rhyme scheme significantly.  Entire verses also repeat, so I&#39;ve only written each verse once for space&#39;s sake.<br><br>The filk leans more towards general canon love, and doesn&#39;t involve the PPC directly.  Couldn&#39;t help it; that&#39;s just how the song wrote itself.  Nesh, if you don&#39;t want it in the songbook, that&#39;s fine.  I&#39;m also worried it sounds too much like I&#39;m dissing AUs and other goodfic that doesn&#39;t follow canon; my intent is that it&#39;s just about a good book (etc.) always being a reliable and unchanging companion.<br><br>Fandom&#39;s imploding, fics are exploding<br>But canon weathers the harm<br>What do I care how many fics swarm?<br>I&#39;ve got canon to keep me warm!<br><br>I can&#39;t recall a worse shipping brawl<br>But I keep back from the brink<br>What do I care how many ships sink?<br>I&#39;ll always have my canon link!<br><br>Down with the inserts, down with the pairs<br>Back to the canon, you&#39;ll see how it fares<br>Flames are brightening, but my soul&#39;s lightening<br>And I can float high above<br>The fandom wank, I&#39;ve had enough of<br>My heart is filled with canon love!<br><br>Out with the movies, any adaptation<br>Just cannot fill me with sad consternation<br>I know the form my world has always worn<br>Fills me with love to keep me warm!</p>

            <p>I thought about specifically asking for filks that celebrate canon this year. I didn&#39;t do it because I thought that might be one too many bullets in the list, but this is exactly the sort of thing I had in mind. It&#39;s lovely. {= )<br><br>I don&#39;t get the line &quot;Out with the movies, any adaptation / Just cannot fill me with sad consternation,&quot; though. Sad consternation is the sort of feeling adaptations do cause, at least for me, and generally I&#39;d say it&#39;s a feeling to be avoided. What were you going for here?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If you would like for me to proofread SPaG in the future, my e-mail is my username in lower case at gmail dot com, substituting punctuation where necessary.<br><br>Though you might want to keep this in mind: Neshomeh speaks wisely about beta reading usually being a closed-quarters thing. Publicly posting un-beta-read writing for the evaluation of others straight away may not be a good idea in the long-term. If you want to start up with missions of your own, you might want to take things slowly, do all the required reading before jumping into anything, and ask for advice about how to do things whenever you feel like you need it. I&#39;ve seen people have a falling out with this community because they don&#39;t do any of those things, and believe me, it wasn&#39;t pretty! I don&#39;t want that to happen with you as well, because if people get upset around here, it may taint the image of our community and prevent people from appreciating it for what it is.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ll take a look at the document pretty soon, though it might take a while due to research. We&#39;ll see how it goes!</p>

            <p>Physics is to mathematics what literature is to languages. <br><br>Both physics and written works can describe things in the natural world in great detail, the former though numbers and the latter though words.  Just like how someone can be inspired by a well-written short story, we can also see beauty in the derivation of an equation: consider the  <a href="http://astro.physics.uiowa.edu/~srs/2961_12/Lec09_notes.pdf">derivation</a> of Kepler&#39;s laws of motion, the equations that govern stellar motion. Indeed, the word &quot;mathematics&quot; comes from the Greek word <i>máthēma</i> which means &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;learning&quot;. It&#39;s a language of proofs, if you will.<br><br>And yet many people complain about mathematics! We&#39;ve all heard of the stereotypical student that curses their math homework, saying that they weren&#39;t cut out for it after failing to solve a few problems. They all say the same thing, too. &quot;But we&#39;re never going to use a quadratic/integral/exponential function outside of class!&quot; or &quot;What&#39;s the point of imaginary/irrational numbers?&quot; and my favourite: &quot;Teach us something useful!&quot; Well, that&#39;s where they&#39;re wrong. Sure, maybe you won&#39;t use the equation per se, but math teaches you how to organize your givens, plan out a solution, execute it, troubleshoot, and solve problems. It&#39;s all in the process, not the formulas. Mathematics teaches discipline.<br><br>You see, math is exactly like any other language in the world: you have to study the structure, read about it, and never stop practicing. All of the above complaints sound like someone writing 2-3 sentences in a different language, realizing that the structure is wrong, and then loudly proclaiming that they weren&#39;t meant to learn French/Spanish/English/what have you. Furthermore, people seem to think that being mathematically illiterate is slightly embarrassing yet completely acceptable. It boggles my mind how people can take this so lightly! <br><br>I suppose that there&#39;s not really a point behind this spiel besides wanting to put this out in the open. D&#39;you guys have any thoughts on this? How do you feel about math?</p>

            <p>I love mathematics. It&#39;s mentally stimulating, and keeps my brain from going completely to rot. Hell, sometimes when I&#39;m unable to play games/read/watch TV/whatever, I&#39;ll just start doing math problems out of sheer boredom, just so my brain doesn&#39;t go to waste.<br><br>I&#39;d try to use physics in the things I write... but unfortunately, I failed that class. The only class I&#39;ve EVER failed, actually. That was very upsetting at the time, and failure is something I&#39;ve never gotten used to.<br><br>I&#39;d love to be able to incorporate it, though.

            <p>But I&#39;m currently in my second year of maths at Uni. I love maths, not all parts of maths I&#39;ll admit (Damned statistics) but as a whole and as a subject it&#39;s a real beauty of a thing to study. I&#39;ve always liked maths, and I&#39;ve always been good at it, and I&#39;ve watched others through my school life just struggle at it, and indeed, especially in GCSE, using sayings like the ones you&#39;ve mentioned. I think, in some ways there is discipline to be learnt through maths, but it&#39;s got to be uncovered, and that is where most people fall short, they can&#39;t do it for whatever reason and after their education is finished they leave maths behind quoting &quot;I&#39;ll never need it again.&quot; Forgetting how much it&#39;ll still crop up in their everyday lives (it is an interesting thought, think about just how much maths comes into your lives on a normal day).<br> <br>The thing is however, that at the moment at Uni, I&#39;m really starting to see just where Maths comes into play in the real world, Statistics being used to not just find out probabilities but being used so that trials for life changing drugs can be done quickly, efficiently and effectively, I see Operational Research algorithms and the like that can be applied to anything from making sure trains and planes run on time to making sure your favourite store doesn&#39;t run out of stock of a particular item and making sure it makes as much a profit (at the lowest cost) possible, we&#39;ve used programming languages to sort out huge quantities of data for us and then work out whether the normal distribution applies to it or not, whilst we can also write code to make a program solve a quartic equation at the press of a button.<br>The thing I&#39;m trying to say is that maths ISN&#39;T useless, it&#39;s not something that just belongs back at the classroom and has no real place at work, it&#39;s a really beautiful thing, a language that is expressed in so many ways and that expresses the fundamental workings of our society today. It&#39;s a real shame people want to tun their back on mathematics, because if they continue to do so they may just continue to turn their backs on the society they know and love, and watch it fall to pieces.  <br><br>Storme Hawk<br><br>An afterthought: Have you seen how many people need a calculator to add things up these days?</p>

            <p>I hate math. <br><br>I&#39;ve struggled to scrape by in my math classes since fifth grade, though I&#39;ve had problems since third grade. (It took me three months longer than everyone else to finally figure out how long division worked.) Someone asks me what 6x2 is, I panic and answer 24. For some reason, I have math anxiety and it all kind of steamrolls into one big vicious cycle: I panic, I mess up, I think &#39;I can&#39;t do this&#39;, I panic more. I wish I could say I was kidding when I say I had to retake a semester of Algebra II because I flunked it.<br><br>Of course, I suppose it could stem from my fifth grade teacher, who took an immense disliking to me on the first day. She started taking off points because I&#39;d answer a question as .23 instead of 0.23, even though they&#39;re <i>worth exactly the same</i>. And she always belittled me, my math especially. I don&#39;t know why.<br><br>And pre-calculus really killed it for me when my teacher kept insisting polar coordinates were absolutely necessary for pilots. When I asked my dad (who is a pilot) about polar coordinates, he just gave me a blank look and said, &quot;What?&quot; He&#39;d never heard of them and after I explained them, he said he&#39;s never had to use them in his twenty-some years of flying.<br><br>Numbers just don&#39;t &#39;click&#39; for me. Even when presented with a simple problem, all I see is scribbles for a moment before I&#39;m like, &#39;oh, numbers&#39;. My parents had me tested for dyscalculia, but nope, that&#39;s not it either.<br><br>Tl;dr I either have some illogical hatred of math thanks to a vicious cycle of self-pity or my fifth grade teacher instilled it in me. Sorry if you were expecting an eloquent comparison of math to language. ^_^&#39;</p>

            <p>But on a more serious note, it doesn&#39;t exactly sound like your fifth grade teacher helped. I can see the point she was probably trying to make though, if you write .23 instead of 0.23 then it&#39;s easier to miss the decimal point, looking at .23 it&#39;s easy for someone to assume that especially when it&#39;s handwritten the decimal point is just a mark of some kind and you&#39;re actually writing 23. by putting the 0 in front of it, so it reads 0.23 you&#39;re forcing whoever is reading it to look for that decimal point after the zero, because the normal way to write twenty three is 23, not 023, despite the fact that they&#39;re the same, so they&#39;re expecting that decimal point to exist. If you&#39;re speaking it however, the fact you&#39;re most likely saying &quot;point two three&quot; (or &quot;Point twenty three&quot;) should eliminate the need to state the zero in front of it, although it could never hurt. Either way taking marks off because of it is silly and doesn&#39;t really help in any way. Sometimes you get teachers like that, they never help.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br></p>

            <p>...though as a physics major, I have to admit that I&#39;m pretty biased in terms of my outlook on mathematics :P Listening to someone with a different opinion is really interesting!<br><br><br>Yeesh, it sounds like you had the math teacher from hell. Although I can understand why she took points off for the .23 (one should never omit the the leading zero because the number might accidentally be read as 23-- equations should be able to be read and understood at a glance), the personal thing she had against you is just plain wrong. I can&#39;t imagine how much pressure you must&#39;ve been under during your fifth grade. <br><br>I&#39;m still intrigued, though: what is it exactly about a math problem that causes so much distress?

            <p>It might just be me and not a spectrum thing, but- I&#39;m good at math, and yet I still have a similar initial reaction. Not &quot;I can&#39;t do this,&quot; but if someone puts me on the spot, for any problem beyond very simple single-didgit addition that doesn&#39;t add up to more than ten, I&#39;ll go &quot;um&quot; for a little while that always seems like a really long time until I can actually math.<br><br>And I like math! o_O<br><br>Also, your fifth grade math teacher sounds like my sixth grade math teacher.

            <p>I&#39;m biased, of course-- being a physics student does this to you-- but I&#39;d actually recommend taking a calculus course or algebra-based physics to that you can at least dip your toes in the metaphorical knowledge pool. There are wondrous things to discover in either subject-- for example, calculus gives a big boost to geometry when it comes to explaining the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OsculatingCircle.html">osculating circle</a> and physics can break down the math behind some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wteiuxyqtoM">complex</a>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_diagram#Minkowski_diagram_in_special_relativity">looking</a> phenomena.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you like my little metaphor.

            <p>Personally, I have never really understood the vehemence with which some students dislike math. So far as I can determine, though, it is exactly like you describe it. They try this or that once, and when it doesn&#39;t immediately click they simply through their hands in the air in disgust and give up.<br><br>I grew up in an area with very high educational standards, and I was raised with that critical understanding that learning is crucial to one&#39;s success in life. Let me preface my next statement by saying that my old home was not some intellectual paradise, and I was often among those who simply phoned it in on certain mathematical principles when they were beyond my grasp.<br><br>That said, I moved for my last year of high school to a part of the country rather infamous for its low educational standards, and it was very noticeable from day one. Most glaringly, I was assigned to a math class teaching concepts I had learned two years before like they were new material. Obviously, this is simply a case of different curricula not lining up exactly, and we later went over at least one concept that I had learned more recently at the old school.<br><br>Still, my new home is worth mentioning because of the values dissonance that I noticed in just about every one of my new peers. I&#39;m in a part of the country now that puts very little weight or import on education, and sometimes glorifies the state of being uneducated. Even among my naturally more intelligent friends, apathy toward their grades and the educational system in general is the norm.<br><br>This was noticeable in more subtle ways, as well. The standard of living for my teachers declined, the library shrunk, and the maintenance of the school itself went downhill. Both of the schools I attended were nearly equivalent as far as proximity to an urban center, the number of students present, and the classes offered. That said, the new school received a smaller budget and spent a larger percentage of that budget on funding the sports teams and various extra-curricular activities rather than the library or more advanced classes.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say I didn&#39;t enjoy the dances or the block party, and being the top student in several classes was definitely a good feeling, but sometimes I wonder how much more I would have learned if that last year had been in the same school as all the others instead of somewhere far away.</p>

            <p>... that it&#39;s the worst form of government, except for all the others we&#39;ve tried. ^_~ In particular, it promotes short-term thinking - why bother planning further ahead than the next election? There are significant forces in politics who, if aliens showed up and declared they would destroy the world in ten years, would vote <i>against</i> funding any sort of countermeasures, on the principle that it would require raising taxes and annoying the voters.<br><br>So yeah, the Youth Of Today will be the population of tomorrow - but they won&#39;t be voting in four years time, and if you can keep taxes low by cutting education, you&#39;re likely to get more people voting for you. Repeat ad infinitum.<br><br>Fortunately, the solution is really simple, and doesn&#39;t require changing <i>anything</i> about the political system. All you, personally, need to do is vote for the party/candidate who has the long-term good of humanity in mind, not the one who&#39;s willing to create massive long-term damage for short-term gain.<br><br>The difficult part is getting everyone else to do the same thing...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have phrased it exactly that way for years and get immensely frustrated when people don&#39;t understand. I agree with every point. Actually, I do have this to add:<br><br>Physics is, as you said, fundamentally how we explain the phenomena of the universe, how it all fits together and works to create that which we experience. Mathematics is the language of physics--not just of the sweeping and grandiose gravitational movement of the stars and of our more familiar interactions, but of the workings of the tiniest subatomic particles and forces.<br><br>Language that is the language of literature is the language of the soul, if you will. It is what describes those experiences, life, emotion... everything so hard to define with science (even when we can quantify it with chemical reactions in the brain), and even use it to reach out beyond that other language. It is also a language of concept and which can be explored for its own sake, but it&#39;s all ultimately about that communication of experience. The interesting thing about mathematics is that like language, it can be explored for its own sake. It can be pure concept and abstraction, of concept and abstraction, but so many things considered &#39;pure math&#39; have become applicable, and it often is--even if only by creating something astonishing.<br><br>How do I feel about this? One of the most wonderful days of my life, when I nearly cried, was seeing a proper real analysis derived proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The way logic fit together, as the logic of mathematics must, was nearly heartbreaking. <br><br>Mathematics helps describe light, and therefore color, color which then gets combined for any number of arts. Mathematics aids in construction, of life, of architecture, of sets for theater performances. It can create glorious vector maps, fractals--algorithms are used to make those visualizations of what is being played in some music player programs. Mathematics is at the heart of music itself, in the vibrations of the air, in the ratios which determine what note is played, in the very rhythms and at least Western notation. Music taught me fractions. The two are inextricably intertwined.<br><br>In the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, Pythagoras proposed the Music of the Spheres. Today, string theory posits that at the heart of everything, tiny strings somehow vibrate to determine what tiny particle exists, or what force. From that possible tiny son to our everyday improvisational chaos to the endless dance of the stars, mathematics describes it all.<br><br>Mathematics is the language of the universe.<br><br>I have never been able to conceive of anything more beautiful than that.</p>

Based on a quick search of this site, I know that agents have handled trollfics before, but I think they were all floaters if I remember correctly.  <br><br>I personally can&#39;t stand trollfics; if you&#39;re going to go through all that effort of writing something that god awful, can&#39;t you put the same amount of effort into writing something that&#39;s good?  It&#39;s so obvious when you spell &quot;Legolas&quot; multiple ways in just the title and summary alone that you&#39;re just trying to mess with people, to provide one specific example.<br><br>So anyway, my question is it something that requires more attention from the PPC?  Maybe a new department?<br><br>I don&#39;t have Permission to post PPC stories yet and I haven&#39;t been here too long, so I hope I&#39;m not stepping on any toes by suggesting this.  <br></p>

            <p>Er, trolls; beg pardon.<br><br>The problem with trolls is that, depending on their &#39;quality&#39;, it&#39;s hard to tell whether they <i>are</i> trolls. I mean, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/4/PPC-Driftwood">Kelly the Roman Warrior</a> was a fairly obvious troll - but what about <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/7/PPC-Driftwood">Thorin&#39;s Little Princess</a>? It had the &#39;random things just sort of happen&#39;, and the &#39;most of the story is just the script&#39;, and several people thought it might be a troll. But is it? Or is it just a badly-done story?<br><br>Then there&#39;s... well, it&#39;s not quite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law">Poe&#39;s Law</a>, but it comes close: there&#39;s never been a troll so outrageous that it wasn&#39;t matched by at least one real badfic.<br><br>Finally, there&#39;s the fact that &#39;troll&#39; is an accusation against the author. Even if only actually said of the fic, you&#39;re still attributing intent to the author. Which isn&#39;t what we do around here.<br><br>Extra-finally, really outrageous trolls tend to be... kind of boring to mission. If a story consists of:<br><br><i>So Legolas and Harry Potter met Edward Cullen and then Queen Amidala went to the Ringworld and fought Captain Kirk&#39;s baby and Pikachu slept with Jack Sparrow and-</i><br><br>... all badly-spelled and with every character a mini, what story are you going to tell with the agents? They&#39;d just stand around looking baffled. And I have a feeling that &#39;not definitely a troll&#39; and &#39;incoherent&#39; overlap, so there&#39;s few-to-no clear trolls worth a mission.<br><br>That said, we <i>do</i> have a Troll Division, as others have said. No idea how they operate, though apparently <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/699353/1/The_Floater">Bad Parody</a> seeks out, uh, the spirit of the author and kills it? I don&#39;t think that&#39;d fly any more... though NytBloomer is noted for her dodgy terminology. It may be that Bad Parody and Trollfics alike have a troll &#39;puppetmaster&#39; sitting around somewhere manipulating the characters; or maybe it just possesses them. It&#39;s likely to be up to the first person to actually write a mission of that kind; did you say there were some?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So it seems like intentional uncanonicity manifests as a Parody Cloud, which can be maneuvered into taking a physical form which some agents refer to (incorrectly) as the author. A Parody Cloud can be benevolent (good parody), incompetent (bad parody), or malevolent (troll). Depending on the cloud, it either hangs around in the shadows, acts as a puppet-master, or physically possesses the canons.<br><br>A PPC agent&#39;s job is then to either dispel the Cloud as if it were a Sue or Slash Wraith, or - if they think it&#39;s worth the time - to try and convert it into a benevolent form. The specifics on how that works are a bit, uh, unspecific, naturally.<br><br>All of which means that Parody Clouds (and the other Wraiths) must be found under Fandominus on the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=265786;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">tree of life</a>. Let&#39;s see...<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PhylogeneticWraiths.png"><br><br>The three subspecies of parody cloud (<i>Parodismus</i>), along with species-level designations for Sue and Slash-wraiths. There is some debate as to the accuracy of this model; some DMSE&amp;R agents advocate classing Sue Wraiths as a species of Sue, and other claim that they don&#39;t even exist, being just a manifestation of <i>Pseudocanonica</i> Sues or <i>Altercanonica</i> OOC canons.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If <i>My Immortal</i> really was a troll, it was a pretty darn good one. There&#39;s the fact that the malapropisms of &#39;masticating&#39; and &#39;shit&#39; (in place of &#39;masturbating&#39; and &#39;sit&#39;) seem a little too perfect.

            <p>As doctorlit said, the Department of Bad Parody would handle trollfics, but it&#39;s a tad lacking in actual missions. We HAVE actually tackled trollfics before, though. The first such mission I remember reading would have to be that Twilight one by Evie and the Fisherman, and there&#39;s also the one I myself tackled on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-BswjRweMBrLwHVlce-zAG0wGaKwjMQahBeygRPDI4/edit">my second mission</a> as well. Both are from Floaters, though I suspect the All-Purpose Department may have also tackled some from their specific fandoms as well.</p>

            <p>Technically, it&#39;s a mission where the agents are temporarily transferred* (as sometimes happens; I may have the wrong term, mind, but I&#39;m jetlagged and can&#39;t be expected to remember where I put my vocabulary), but it is a mission from the Trollfic Division! I&#39;ve been basing its structure mostly on that interlude and the wiki page. I&#39;ll have to take a look at the character journal, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen it before.<br><br>But yes. A Trollfic Division mission is coming, albeit one involving agents who are not usually in that division or even in the DBP.

In exchange for the DOOCH&#39;s help in keeping them hidden, the hobbits give all their spare food to the department, who sell it on (by way of a convoluted chain of front organisations) to the various restaurants in the city.<br><br>Certainly, it is true that no-one is quite sure who runs the farms, nor has anyone admitted to seeing anybody working the land. It is equally true that hobbits are adept at hiding from &#39;the Big Folk&#39;, and very fond of growing food. But proving the idea plausible does not make it true, so unless Agents Rohana and Celebduin can acquire actual evidence of their claims, they must remain simply a rumour.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What I think TheShyIon was meaning was that to differentiate between the two completely different canon&#39;s he calls the Hiccup of the moves &#39;the first&#39; and the Hiccup of the books &#39;the third&#39; <br><br>IMO the books are cool, and really well written and the movie is a let down in that regard, but if they&#39;d released the movie as its own thing it&#39;d of still been just as awesome (or maybe saying based on HTTYD, not calling it such)</p>

            <p>is as an AU of the book canon. A very, very different AU. They&#39;re both really good in their own rights. Kind of like how I&#39;ve forced myself to see the Percy Jackson movies as an AU of the books even though I hated the movies. <s><i>No I don&#39;t pretend they don&#39;t exist</i></s><br><br>Or movie!Hiccup is a descendant of Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III; they never state his full name probably because it&#39;s too silly for the movie canon. It would certainly be interesting to see someone explore how the friendly relationship we saw between dragons and Vikings in the book turned into the war we see in the movies... brb, gonna go scribble some ideas down.<br><br>The second movie had a bit of a plot-point involving a scar on Hiccup&#39;s chin that most definitely wasn&#39;t there in the first movie, even though he supposedly had it all his life. So it was pretty jarring in that respect. At least, it was to me. Mom says I&#39;m being too anal about it.<br><br>Oops, sorry, I got a bit off-topic there.<br><br>Uh, anyway, I still like both versions of HTTYD, but I&#39;m pretty sad that the majority of people only know the movie version. It&#39;s not nearly as silly as the books, which is where I thought the movie kind of failed. *sigh*<br><br>(Though I had to laugh when I noticed movie!Hiccup was left-handed. It was a very subtle nod to his book persona.)</p>

            <p>They&#39;re really good! Basically, the movie reversed the relationship both of dragons/Vikings and Hiccup/Toothless. (Not a slash pairing. Just in case.)<br><br>In book, Toothless was ridiculously common and kinda saved Hiccup&#39;s hide.<br><br>In book, Vikings train dragons and treat them like dogs.<br><br>No spoilers on the Red Death, however. </p>

I could have sworn it was the other way around in my copy, and when I got back home, I checked and sure enough, it was.<br><br>Turns out Rowling made an oopsie in regards to the reversed order of deaths. So there was a reprinting. <br><br>I was so ridiculously pleased to have found a new bit of writing, even if it was just a retcon.<br><br>The same thing happened in regards to the first book: in my copy, a witch outside the apothecary in Diagon Alley is complaining about dragon liver being seventeen sickles an ounce, whereas in my brother&#39;s copy, it&#39;s sixteen. That one was because the original is pretty much like someone saying a candy bar costs a hundred cents.<br><br>But, um, I got a little OT. Reprintings aren&#39;t quite the same. So lemme get back to the subject:<br><br>I feel so incredibly derpy to not have noticed it until maybe my seventh time reading OotP (post-DH; it was probably like my twentieth time total. I&#39;m way too obsessed.), but there&#39;s a mention of Aunt Petunia saying she heard &#39;that awful boy&#39; telling Lily about dementors years ago. And then it hit me that she meant <i>Snape</i>, not James like Harry had assumed. Major OH MY ROWLING moment for me. I had to put the book down to laugh/cry.</p>

            <p>For a minute I had hope that there was an actual fanfic wiki that filters its content for quality. I gave in to temptation and sporked one of the so-bad-I&#39;m-not-sure-it&#39;s-not-a-trollfic stories on my own wiki. The author was less than thrilled, even though she (?) only found out when I apologized for it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about OFUs recently, and I&#39;m wondering about the following possibility. I&#39;ve discussed it with one of my betas, so I figured it would be okay to put the idea forward publicly for the sake of opinion.<br><br>Basically, most OFUs tend to cover a specific continuum, like LoTR, HP, Redwall, or Pokemon. However, those particular continua have really big fandoms and enough badfic that they get specific OFUs to themselves. From what I can tell, that isn&#39;t true for continua related to animated movies. Whereas the Pit has over 52465 LoTR fanfics, it has 10354 HTTYD fics, only a fifth as much, and only 861 Incredibles fics. And movies that are even less known may have even fewer fanfics to their credit.<br>Additionally, some animated film fandoms may also combine into a single super-fandom and create fics involving all of the encompassed continua. I can think of no better example than Rise of the Brave Tangled Dragons, of course, and more recently the version 2.0 with Frozen added to the mix.<br><br>So... given the sheer multitude of such movies in existence, I get the feeling that having OFUs for each continuum may become difficult to manage, especially for such relatively small fandoms. So what if, instead, we had an OFU for animated films in general? If you think about it, a lot of the badfic trends in fandoms for these movies are the same or at the very least, really similar. So having to devote OFUs to specific continua may be redundant, as opposed to one OFU where animated movie canons from a range of continua teach a general whole.<br><br>Thoughts of course would be appreciated, but I honestly don&#39;t know how well this would go over, especially since a multi-fandom OFU seems a bit unexpected around here. Then again, we have an OFU of Crossovers, so maybe this could work too under the right circumstances.<br></p>

            <p>...is there anyone around here aside from Iximaz who has an interest in Disney/Pixar? I&#39;m working on a second draft for a little secret something relevant to this discussion, and I might need one or two more beta-readers for it.<br><br>As a general response to everyone who replied to my original question: In hindsight, an OFU with that broad of a scope may have indeed been a bit too much. Especially with regards to Huinesoron&#39;s statement that OFUs are free for anyone to write, so one could crop up for any particular continuum in theory. On the other hand, most of these fandoms are small enough that Iximaz does make a valid point about a Disney/Pixar OFU to cover the films produced by those companies (both the 2D stuff like the Disney Princesses and the 3D stuff like Pixar). Besides, a Disney/Pixar mega-crossover does technically exist in the form of Disney Infinity, though it doesn&#39;t have a Subspace Emissary-style story mode yet AFAIK.<br><br>A possible compromise would be as follows: At the Ohio State University, where I attend, we have a &#39;main&#39; college in Columbus, but also a number of affiliated campuses in Lima, Mansfield, Marion, and Newark. The OFUs for the animated film anthologies made by specific companies (Disney/Pixar, Dreamworks, Studio Ghibli, Blue Sky Studios...) could work in the same way - there are &#39;hub&#39; OFUs that cover everything affiliated with the particular studio, but for those who still want OFUs to exist in specific continua and take care of specific fandoms like HTTYD or Frozen, the &#39;hub&#39; OFU could have multiple divisions or &#39;campuses&#39; distributed throughout the various worlds. Then anyone can write a specific division and tie it back to the main OFU for in-universe consistency.<br><br>Again, this hasn&#39;t actually been put into practice yet, but it&#39;s the best solution I can think of. If anyone has a better alternative, though, I&#39;m all ears for it.</p>

            <p>... as hS already pointed out, we at the PPC don&#39;t actually have any kind of jurisdiction over the OFUs. There&#39;s a certain overlap between people who are/were Boarders and people who write OFUs, but that&#39;s it. Technically, writing an OFU is something you do in your free time and you don&#39;t need Permission for it.<br>As such, we can&#39;t decide that all canons for animated movies are connected. Or rather, we can decide it, but no-one who writes an OFU is obligated to abide by it.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m uneasy with the idea of making rules for OFUs that one is not actually planning to write. I mean, if you personally wanted to write an OFU for, say, Frozen and wanted to have it be a division of a larger Disney-OFU, than that is your choice.<br>But it strikes me as being ... presumptuous, if we on the Board declared that anyone who then writes about Tangled or Brave must write their OFU in the same way.<br><br>Finally (and I&#39;m really not trying to be a jerk here) you refer to this as the &#39;best solution&#39; but you haven&#39;t really explained what the problem is. You said in your opening post that having OFUs for all the small fandoms would be difficult to manage, but difficult for whom?<br><br>The PPC don&#39;t manage anything. When we are made aware of an OFU, we add it to the list of OFUs, to the page for that canon and update the list of minis. That&#39;s it.<br><br>If you&#39;re talking in-universe, someone who can consistently track down thousands upon thousands of fanwriters, send out application forms and then kidnap them to schools located outside of time and space, don&#39;t strike me as the kind of organization to have trouble managing separate OFUs for all animated movies.<br>I mean, if you take a look at the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/LOTR/ofum.html">list</a> on Miss Cams page there are plenty of small fandoms. If it&#39;s okay to have an OFU for the 10th Kingdom and Ella Enchanted rather than bundling them up in The Academy for Fairy Tale Derivative Fantasy, then I don&#39;t see why individual animated movies should suddenly be a problem.<br><br>So yeah, sorry to be a downer, but I just see this as a radical solution to something that have never really been an problem.<br>On the other hand, now I kinda wanna write The Academy for Fairy Tale Derivative Fantasy...</p>

            <p>It seems that it actually is possible for an OFU that handles a general category of stuff to exist alongside one for specific continua. There&#39;s an OFU for anime in general and also OFUs for specific ones like Trigun, for example (though most of the links on the page are broken; it must be a pretty old list for that to have happened).<br><br>The main issue I was addressing was likely an administrative one for those who manage OFUs on a large scale, assuming that there are groups that keep tabs on all of the OFUs for a particular category. But since they&#39;re essentially a free-for-all out-of-universe, I guess that may no longer be a problem. So I guess I could still set up an OFU for Disney/Pixar in general (since Disney bought Pixar a while ago and the two can now be considered part of the same company), and it doesn&#39;t have to be a &#39;hub&#39; one for any of the OFUs that may be made for specific Disney continua in the future. Kinda like the Anime OFU I mentioned in the above paragraph.<br><br>I am not oblivious to the fact that you listed your e-mail in the username of the post I&#39;m replying to. May I ask if this means you&#39;re willing to beta the thing I&#39;m doing (or if you at least have an interest in Disney continua for when I get to a future Disney mission?)</p>

            <p>In your opening post I thought it sounded like you wanted a general OFU in place of a bunch of smaller ones. Like one big OFU for animated movies and then we don&#39;t need one for Wall-E and an one for Porco Rosso and so on.<br>An OFU for, say, Pixar which exists alongside the more specific ones, would be something else and like you noticed, there&#39;s already a precedence. Though I&#39;ll be honest and say that I don&#39;t know how the genre-based OFUs work, since I haven&#39;t read them.<br>It could specialize in (fictional) writers who write badfics for a lot of Pixar movies, but don&#39;t seem to have a favourite.<br><br>And yes, I am definitely interested in Disney and other animated movies and unless I&#39;m completely bogged down, when the time comes, I&#39;d be happy to help out as a beta.</p>

            <p>OFUs, as stories, are written by people who want to write them, not &#39;according to need&#39;. If someone decides they want to write, let&#39;s say a <i>Prince of Egypt</i> OFU (FF.net story total: 179), but decides not to because you/someone else has already briefly mentioned it in OFUAnimation - or even potentially could - then you&#39;ve cut down on the number of people writing stories. That&#39;s a negative, in my view.<br><br>The key point here is the difference between in-universe and out-of-universe. In-universe, yes, it would make sense for the &#39;minor OFUs&#39; to all be combined in one, in the same way that it would make sense for there to be a vast number of PPC agents working in <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Percy Jackson</i>, and all the other popular fandoms. But out-of-universe, people write what they want to write. In missions, that means random obscure fandoms get a mission (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1MsELxdIpH6h0VXpLHZrJb0bj5bRAD-F7DffOSa1pTyQ">like Flatland</a>), while seriously huge ones don&#39;t because no-one on the Board is invested enough in them. In OFUs, it means... basically the same thing: the fandoms covered are the ones people want to write for, not the ones that &#39;need it most&#39;.<br><br>I feel I should also point out, in case of anyone getting confused, that the PPC has no authority over OFUs. Miss Cam has said anyone can write them, and that&#39;s the end of that. Your phrasing says you know this and are essentially using us as a sounding Board, which is absolutely fine; just making sure no-one gets tangled up in it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>First of all, I&#39;d say that a lot of badfic trends are really similar, period.  Something like a Tenth Walker may seem fandom specific in theory, but in practice it&#39;s the same basic principle as any other brand new character who joins the main characters.  The specific ways in which they break canon are what vary from fandom to fandom.  You could argue that the true focus of OFUs is breaking their students from these universal bad fannish habits, but you need something a little more specific to focus on in order to make it unique.<br><br>Honestly, I also feel like there would be a tendency for this to fall into the trap of pepper-jack cheese, or other pitfalls found in mega-crossovers.  Maybe this is just a personal issue, as I tend not to be fond of super-fandoms; they just tend to feel really forced to me.  But I feel like it would just turn into All-My-Personal-Favorites OFU. Even in your proposal, I noticed that you only mentioned 3D animated movies by Disney/Pixar or DreamWorks.  Where do the Disney Princesses fit into this, just as an example?  <br><br>Like Iximaz mentioned, I could maybe see one for a group of movies that are thematically connected, like a Disney OFU.  Especially since Disney has a preexisting trend of characters from different movies interacting with each other.  But a general animated movie OFU is just too big. <br><br>If there&#39;s a single series you want to focus on, just go with that one.  Numbers aren&#39;t everything - HTTYD may only have one-fifth the fic count of LOTR, but there&#39;s been a Discworld OFU and it only has ~2000 fics.</p>

            <p>At first, I was a bit hesitant toward the idea, because all the OFUs I&#39;ve read/read about cover one fandom only. However, like SkarmorySilver pointed out, the separate fandoms have so little badfic in comparison to the &#39;Big Names&#39; that combining them all into one OFU would make a certain amount of sense.<br><br>I&#39;m still reluctant to say &#39;sure, why not&#39; to an OFU for <i>all</i> animated movies, but, say, a Disney OFU, or a Pixar OFU, or a Dreamworks OFU on its own could be feasible. But throwing all animated movies into one OFU seems a <i>bit</i> much.<br><br>Of course, the distinction becomes a bit murkier when you take into consideration the number of popular, say, Disney/Pixar films. Still, I&#39;m not the ultimate authority on this sort of thing, so... what does everyone else think?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s time for some birthday math. Are you ready?<br><br><br>So, how far have you moved around the galactic centre? It&#39;s a remarkably easy question to answer! First, we find the Sun&#39;s angular speed around the core.  <br><br>ω = 2π; / 225*10^6 years ≈ 2.7925 * 10^(-8) radians / year<br><br>We know that the distance of the Sun from the Galactic Core is about R =10^18 km. We can then use the good ol&#39; arc length formula you&#39;ve learnt in high school:<br><br>Arc = ω*R = <b>2.7925 * 10^10 km</b> travelled. <br><br><br>Technically speaking, this isn&#39;t the exact distance you&#39;ve travelled-- this is assuming that the Sun&#39;s orbit is perfectly circular (that is, the Sun&#39;s eccentricity is equal to 0) but the application of Kepler&#39;s Third Law to find the exact orbital period requires the exact distance from the core&#39;s centre of mass (which is difficult to find) and the mass of the core itself (which I am too lazy to look up). <br><br>Anyways, you&#39;d better cash in those frequent flyer miles before they go to waste!</p>

            <p>Okay, bear with me on this.<br><br>The earliest date I&#39;m aware of for the PPC is <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/658458/1/Clan-of-the-Cactus">the publication of &#39;Clan of the Cactus&#39;</a> in March 2002. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/archives.html">Miss Cam&#39;s site</a> says that there were four other spinoffs before that, plus TOS. Assuming Miss Cam has the early spinoffs in chronological order, the very first spinoff story (Architeuthis&#39; original Intelligence report) must post-date the first mention of Makes-Things in TOS3.<br><br>Reviews for CotC make it clear that TOS was banished from FF.net on May 11th 2002; by May 16th, Philosopher at Large had rehosted them. At the time they were banished, they&#39;d already written 14 missions. That&#39;s 14 missions in the six months since <i>Fellowship</i> was released, which is quite impressive, but I&#39;m straying from my point.<br><br>All indications are that Jay and Acacia began writing the PPC just as soon as the first movie came out, so in December &#39;01 or January &#39;02. That means this month or next is our thirteenth birthday. And, uh...<br><br><b>Are you actually younger than the PPC?</b><br><br>hS<br><br>(Also, y&#39;know, congrats, well done, etc etc. I&#39;m not good at remembering social niceties.)</p>

            <p>Because it&#39;s always a good time for a round of Fill the Plotholes! This is the oldest PPC game; it&#39;s been around since before I joined. It works like this:<br><br>I list a bunch of summaries, riddled with the plotholes that usually infest summaries. You pick one of these summaries and write a story that fills those plotholes. It can be an interpretation that makes the story actually good, or it can be satire which draws out every single error and implausibility.<br><br>This does not (normally) involve PPC agents, though they&#39;re not strictly forbidden. Nor does it involve reading the actual story - they might actually be really good stories, but it&#39;s only the summary that matters. No, you don&#39;t need Permission. Yes, multiple people can do the same summary. No, there&#39;s no need to &#39;reserve&#39; a summary; just write it and post it. (No, you don&#39;t need a beta, and no, it doesn&#39;t need to be very long. This is a fun game, not a chore)<br><br>This time round, I&#39;ve taken one summary from each of the top eight FF.net canons (ie, four each from &#39;Book&#39; and &#39;Movie&#39;). Enjoy!<br><br><b>Harry Potter:</b> The Hufflepuff Pensieve<br>{AU Sixth year}A look at Harry&#39;s school life had he grown up with his muggle grandparents. We see a more confident, sure of himself Harry than before, but still the reckless hero we all know and love! Fic is mainly Harry/Ron/Hermione centric, with multiple different OC&#39;s littered throughout. {Drug use/abuse, swearing, general boyish banter}<br><br><b>Twilight:</b> I&#39;m Back<br>She is a small town girl who went to the big apple for college. For four years she never looked back. Didn&#39;t even go home for the holidays, but now she has her Bachelor Degree and has no idea what to do with her life now. So, she is going back to the past to find her future.<br><br><b>Percy Jackson and the Olympians:</b> Clear as mud<br>What happens when Percu gets forced to join the army of Chaos and Annabeth is under the influence of Kronos? Well tea don to find out..this ist first fanfic so pls give it a try...percabeth with hints of thalico<br><br><b>Lord of the Rings:</b> Daughter of Moonlight<br>NOT the stereotypical MarySue and not a Legomance! She&#39;s a seemingly normal girl girl- except for a few things- but then, hey, everyone is unique! When she gets thrown into Middle Earth and finds out that she was originally born there, what will happen? Will she ever understand her powers? And can she change the story she knows for the better? Not a typical thenth walker!<br><br><b>Star Wars:</b> The Shift of Power<br>This is a short story about what would happen if Anakin Skywalker killed Grievous and no you may not print this off unless you ask me first. AngelDesaray I am looking at you, to bad I am copyrighted<br><br><b>Avengers:</b> Evva: Agent of Shield<br>Nick Furry adopts a ice giant cause of the prophacy of 9 worlds, but she is raised in secret as a Shield Agent with the Avengers. But then Loki escapes from jail, also what happens when the world is in dark danger?<br><br><b>Pirates of the Caribbean:</b> The Last Oath<br>Jack Sparrow is thought dead for five long years. One given morning, he looms back into Tortuga, in the commands of one big French vessel. Thing is, he isn&#39;t there to stay, but to pick up men ready to rove along, chase unseen sunrise and never come back to the same place twice. The tight walls around his sanity box seemed fool-proof, until Luna came along and proved him wrong.<br><br><b>High School Musical:</b> Beauty On The Dancefloor<br>When Troy Bolton owner of Footsteps- a club. When he spots a beauty of the dance floor he just as to meet her. But will their relationship as smooth as their moves?<br><br>(If you need more information on how the game works: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=263974;search_term=plothole">this</a> is the last round we played)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Not a stereotypical Mary Sue? The idea of a bumbling Sue who fails at Suishness amuses me. <br><br>But! Plothole filling!

How does that even work?&quot; the Sue asked. &quot;And why are there Legos getting married?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re getting into the spirit of these things, Luna,&quot; her father said.<br><br>&quot;And why would moonlight name me Luna, anyway?&quot; Luna muttered, before splitting into two Lunas.<br><br>&quot;Waugh! What&#39;s going on?&quot; they asked in unison.<br><br>Her father chuckled. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry. You&#39;re a perfectly normal girl girl.&quot;<br><br>Luna morphed back into one girl, sighed, and walked away. Sadly, she walked onto a rope made of thenth and couldn&#39;t keep her balance, so she fell off the cliff and died.<br><br>Then someone picked her up and threw her into Middle Earth, but she was already dead, so it didn&#39;t really matter.<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s a good mission overall, but I&#39;ve noticed a recurring trend in your missions.  You seem to typically focus more on expanding Rina&#39;s character than Randa&#39;s.  The <i>Ranger&#39;s Apprentice</i> mission departs from this trend somewhat, but even there the conclusion focuses mostly on Rina&#39;s family.  <br><br>It&#39;s a perfectly logical situation; since Rina is your own character, I&#39;m guessing you feel more comfortable fleshing her out than you do establishing facts about a character that you&#39;re borrowing.  However, it gives off an overall feel that Rina is the main character and Randa is her sidekick, as opposed to them getting equal billing, so to speak.  I enjoy you writing and character development, so I&#39;d like to see more of it for Randa as well!</p>

            <p>I am really trying to avoid that, but it&#39;s hard. And Randa, though she looks it over and gives me the thumbs up, isn&#39;t quite as...invested? It&#39;s partly why I&#39;m planning on bringing in a new agent later on. After the first mission, which we did together, I think Randa&#39;s enthusiasm kind of petered out. <br><br>But we are hoping to tackle <i>My Inner Life</i> after the next mission, and Randa has a personal vendetta to settle with this one. Actually, since I know practically nothing about the Zeldaverse, she&#39;s gonna be spearheading that project.</p>

            <p>Makes sense.  Maybe you could ask her where she sees the character going?  I did really like the bit where Randa was upset about the Sue&#39;s drawing skills, because it was something she really had to work at.<br><br>I gotta tell you, I don&#39;t envy you going after that one.

            <p>You always point out that my missions are too much like an MST. I&#39;m not whining; just pointing this out so I can ask what you think I would do to make my missions better.

            <p>Okay, um... how about this:<br><br>There are three reasons to quote a line from the badfic:<br><br>1/ To display a charge, such as a misspelled name, or OOC line.<br><br>2/ To show what the characters are doing.<br><br>3/ To show off a specific, wording-related issue.<br><br>The thing is... the first two don&#39;t need to be quoted. If Harry Potter sounds like an elderly man, we don&#39;t need to see this:<br><br><i><b>&quot;You young whippersnappers!&quot; yelled Harry.</b><br><br>&quot;Why does Harry sound like an old fogey?&quot; asked Freckles.</i><br><br>We can gather just from Freckles&#39; line that Harry sounded like an old fogey; the details... aren&#39;t all that important.<br><br>Similarly, the <i>action</i> of the badfic can be more interestingly portrayed through your own words. Partly that&#39;s a style thing - essentially, quoting is how MSTs do it, so paraphrase instead - but partly it&#39;s because... well, it&#39;s a <i>bad</i>fic. If you&#39;re letting it tell the story when you can write better than it (and you <i>are</i> a good writer), then you&#39;re missing an opportunity to get <i>your</i> words into play.<br><br>To take an example, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/6/PPC-Driftwood">Driftwood mission 5</a> quotes the badfic in italics maybe five or six times. The first one is to show a specific line that Kaitlyn reacts to - because of the line, not the events. The second is an information-rich paragraph which is just... bewildering. The third is an action which I couldn&#39;t come up with an interesting way to paraphrase - there&#39;s no need to change <i>everything</i>, after all. The fourth is a spoken line about trivialised rape. The fifth is Hermione declaring in great detail how beautiful Bella is. The sixth is the last line I let them say.<br><br>With one exception, I never quoted an action. I described them occasionally in the narrative, but even that feels a bit clumsy sometimes. Mostly I just let the agents react to what was going on, because to my mind, it&#39;s the agents I&#39;m there to read about, not (strange though this may sound) the badfic.<br><br>Generally, there&#39;s two lines I&#39;ll quote pretty consistently - the first and the last. Other than that, it&#39;s occasional dialogue, and anything where the wording is funny without invoking an unintended effect. If something weird <i>does</i> come of a phrase in the fic, I&#39;ll let the <i>agents</i> quote it - like the &#39;BBBBBBBBBB&#39;s they were bombarded with. I didn&#39;t need to quote the break, because Selene did it for me.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying &#39;do it this way, only clones of me are acceptable&#39;. Having more quotes than I do is absolutely fine (and part of the reason I have Selene &amp; Kaitlyn step away from the badfic a lot is to keep my word counts down). But doing so extensively just... doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s letting <i>you</i> show off your writing as much as you could.<br><br>An example from your story: you quote what I think is the entire &#39;founders beatify Sue&#39; scene. And yes, it&#39;s funny - but did it need quoting? Everything we need to know is contained in Rina&#39;s complaint:<br><br><i>&quot;Dear Rowling, even the Founders are in awe of her! And Merlin came after the Founders- he was a Slytherin! They have no reason to be invoking him!&quot;</i><br><br>Tweak that second sentence to something like, &#39;And Godric wouldn&#39;t invoke Merlin - he came after the Founders, and he was a Slytherin!&#39;, and you&#39;ve erased the need to share <i>any</i> of their direct speech.<br><br>That&#39;s just one example, and it may be that ultimately you&#39;d choose to keep that scene intact anyway for the sheer ridiculousness of it. But I hope it gets at least the gist of my view across. As always, it&#39;s yours to agree or disagree with - I&#39;m just hoping to make myself clear.<br><br>hS, too many words</p>

            <p>Yeah, that was a first-timer&#39;s mistake on my part... Especially because the mission in question was so damn long that I thought posting it piecewise was better in the long run.

            <p>Too many Sues and they&#39;ll start getting fat. So I&#39;m going to reserve them for special occasions.

            <p>Oh, that reminds me of a funny story- I have a friend in real life (shocking, right?) who is completely colorblind. Anyway, a few years ago, we had the same math class, and our teacher passed out one of those worksheets where depending on what answer you get, you had to draw a face a certain way. (For example, if you got the answer 2x+3y=18, you&#39;d color the eyes blue, but if you got the answer 3x+2y=34, you&#39;d color them green. And yes, it&#39;s just as silly and insulting as it sounds.)<br><br>Anyway, the teacher gave us a bucket of crayons that, thanks to some previous student(s), had all the wrappers torn off. I ended up having to pick out the right crayons for my friend because he had no way to tell them apart. The teacher came over and demanded to know why my friend couldn&#39;t just pick out his own crayons; she was pretty mortified when he told her he was colorblind. <br><br><br>If you don&#39;t mind me asking, hS, do you see reds and greens as grey, or just not at all? Or is it something else entirely?</p>

            <p>Only it&#39;s the story of the teacher who stood there at the end of the day and said in a very scathing voice, &quot;<i>Someone</i> thinks they have green hair.&quot; I was... maybe five or six? Not a happy memory, that one. (Fortunately she was only a supply teacher - a temporary stand-in)<br><br>And that might answer your question, actually. The problem is that I can&#39;t really see <i>green</i> - it just blurs into the colours on either side. Only of course you learn colour names to some extent by rote, so it&#39;s not that simple.<br><br>My favourite example is the MSPaint colour pallet. The yellow/lime green pair look identical to me, as do the pair underneath them; I&#39;d say they&#39;re all yellow. The vertical pair immediately to their right are also identical, and both green - I guess one is actually a dark yellow?<br><br>And just in case you thought you understood - everything to the right of that is blue. The colour I have no headspace for at all is purple; my colour wheel goes from red to blue, possibly with a very limited pink in between.<br><br>(Which implies that the problem should be with my red-perception - but red is so vivid, and green is so boring and, when dark, just brown... yeah, I dunno)<br><br>Tell you what, here you go: a colour wheel.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/hSColourWheel.png"><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>About the teacher, I mean. Thank goodness she wasn&#39;t permanent. *offers internet hugs*<br><br>I&#39;d hate not being able to see green (it&#39;s my favorite color). But your color wheel isn&#39;t too far off the mark; I suppose that&#39;s because you&#39;ve learned to associate what your idea of the colors is with the &#39;normal&#39; set? The bit you&#39;ve labelled &#39;white&#39; is actually very light blue, and the &#39;Brown? Green? Orange?&#39; is a kind of muddy-looking orangeish-yellow.<br><br>And for the record, I once got in trouble for coloring a picture of myself with pink hair. It was silly; all I wanted was to look like Tonks, but my first-grade teacher had to shatter my dreams by mocking it. D: Just wanted to share that you&#39;re not the only one, though for different reasons.</p>

            <p>I do think you&#39;re trying to make the effort to fit in and learn the ropes around here, so thank you for doing that. But... you&#39;re still making the same mistakes.<br><br>-You&#39;ve already posted a request for a beta. eatpraylove and SkarmorySilver replied. There was no need to make a new thread to ask again.<br>--Specifically, you&#39;ve had quite a few people point out that <b>making new threads pushes old ones off</b>. With that in mind, making a new thread as a repeat of an old one could be characterised as... shall we go with &#39;thoughtless&#39;? It&#39;s the same as making multiple badfic threads (which you have <i>not</i> done, just so&#39;s you don&#39;t think I&#39;m accusing you); we&#39;re all capable of scrolling down, so don&#39;t repeat yourself while a previous thread saying is still up. And if a thread drops off without getting the replies you want - let it go. People saw it, they just didn&#39;t have anything to say.<br>---And yeah, that can hurt. I&#39;ve had three recent things I really wanted to see people reply to, but... no-one was interested, and so I let them drift away.<br><br>-Neshomeh said on the 14th &#39;Four days ago, you said you don&#39;t expect Permission yet. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I sorta figured that by &quot;yet&quot; you meant &quot;at least in the near to mid future,&quot; since you mentioned you wanted to take time to learn more about writing.&#39;. You, uh, are still doing that, right here. You said on your returning thread that &#39;I&#39;ve been gone for so long, I&#39;d need to restart the &quot;get to know everyone&quot; process anyway&#39;. Ten days really isn&#39;t enough time to do that.<br><br>Sit back. Comment on threads that you didn&#39;t start. Don&#39;t try to drag things out of the Board - accept what it gives you. Because honestly, we&#39;re giving out insanity, frivolity, and <b>good times</b> with both hands here - you just need to join in. Don&#39;t spend your time sitting on the sidelines waiting to start your next thread.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... so as not to let you reply to this part and forget about the rest; we all do it, but my first post here was more important than this one. If you haven&#39;t already, Voyd, please go back and read it, understand it, and reply.<br><br>That said... Voyd, what are you looking for on the Board? I don&#39;t mean &#39;Permission&#39;, we know that. But when you come onto the PPC Board, what kind of interaction with your fellow PPCers are you after? To put a more concrete frame to this question: if you could come here one day and see three perfect, ideal threads, <b>what would those threads be</b>?<br><br>Actually, that&#39;s a question for everyone. I think for my part, one would definitely be a mission plug - a good, old-fashioned mission, probably in LotR, which I can read and enjoy reading.<br><br>My second thread would be an in-depth, geeky fandom discussion. Again, I&#39;d want it to be LotR, because that&#39;s <i>my</i> fandom, but I&#39;d go for others as well. Something that everyone can get their teeth into.<br><br>And third... some sort of writing challenge. Fill the Plotholes, the Badfic/Shipfest/Plort games, PoorCynic&#39;s workshops, my Monthlyish Challenge, or a genuine old-style fanfic writing challenge.

            <p>First off, new missions. I feel a bit awkward typing this, since I myself have not had a mission out in six months and it was six months before that.<br>I would especially like to see a co-write. Or just something with cameos from other Agents. I know that this is something a lot of people would like to see more of and yet it doesn&#39;t happen a lot. Maybe we could think out some way to make it easier to interact. *archives thought for further reference*<br><br>Secondly, a recommendation-thread for good fanworks. This could be a goodfic thread but it could also be about fanart and we had one about fanmusic a while back.<br><br>Thirdly, just general silliness and geekiness and goofing around.

            <p>My first one would be some sort of roleplay- I really love those. Second would probably be a mission in the RWBY continuum, since it&#39;s overrun with uncontrolled badfic.<br><br>Third would probably be a recommendation of f/f goodslash. It&#39;s easy to find m/m slash, and some of it is even pretty good, but f/f is rarer and, given the badfic to goodfic ratio, the good stuff is therefore harder to find. :/</p>

            <p>I just thought of another potentially problematic continuum.<br><br>Touhou. I can see the PPC having problems with it for several reasons.<br><br>1) Unless I&#39;m very much mistaken, very few cast members have fully established personalities. How could we discern what&#39;s OOC?<br><br>2) Almost every single character has a story-breaker power. This includes, but is not limited to, Flandre Scarlet (who can destroy anything in her line of sight), Sakuya Izayoi (who controls time and space), Reimu Hakurei (whose power of floating extends to floating away from reality), Yuyuko Saigyouji (who can make anything die), and Yukari Yakumo (who can do whatever the hell she feels like). How would you discern a Sue in the midst of all this? An online acquaintance of mine made a Parody Sue (called Marisu, of course), but I don&#39;t know how we&#39;d find the genuine article.<br><br>3) At least one character would be immune to neuralyzation. Because there are so many loosely-defined powers that encourage creativity on the part of their users, there&#39;s bound to be one who can evade memory wiping. For a specific example, Yukari would probably achieve it through something cheesy like manipulating the boundary between vulnerability and immunity, or remembrance and forgetting. (spot the reference!)<br><br>Nobody in the PPC has tackled Gensokyo before, and I think I can see why.</p>

            <p>I would argue that something like something like <i>8-Bit Theater</i> has established itself as a spin-off continuum standing on its own. I wouldn&#39;t say AU, because as far as I know the webcomic characters are not like the original game characters. <br><br><i>Red vs. Blue</i> is an example of something similar. It&#39;s set in the <i>Halo</i> universe, but never really interacts with it directly and has established its own canonical storyline.</p>

            <p>IMO, 8-bit Theatre would be an AU. Fanfic would work, I suppose, but the entire thing is an alternate storyline using the same characters (plus a few from the other games) in a more self-referential way. Considering the webcomic has merchandise and a following of its own, I&#39;d say AU bordering on different continuum. It&#39;s fanfic almost in a similar way to, say, Nuzlocke comics.<br><br>I&#39;m not an expert, though - just my take on it!</p>

            <p>My advice would be to give it time. Your questions are good questions, but probably not ones that have come up before. It&#39;s quite likely that if you got Permission and they came up, you&#39;d be the first to run into them.<br><br>I&#39;d also advise you to try some betaing yourself.

It&#39;s not very often I can be enticed to read a fanfic as long as this one these days, but in addition to having my curiosity piqued by one of the author&#39;s tie-in stories, I was won over straight away by the descriptions, sense of humor, insightful characterization, and world-building. The main character, Wulfryk, is a very good, well-balanced OC, even as the inherently overpowered Dragonborn, since the author has taken pains to give his powers drawbacks and make sure his flaws and mistakes have consequences. Actually, this is one of those stories where <i>no one</i> can have nice things, at least not for very long, which makes the good moments all the more enjoyable. There&#39;s adventure, drama, comedy, good times, bad times, and worse times, and overall it&#39;s just plain fun to read.<br><br>The only drawback is that, due to the author not being a native English-speaker, there are a few minor but persistent punctuation and grammar errors, and he sometimes uses the wrong word (e.g. weary instead of wary), but even those distractions weren&#39;t enough to stop me from enjoying the story. That&#39;s how good it is.<br><br>This caught me at just the right moment, I suppose. I went looking for fanfic about the Companions, since I&#39;ve become very fond of Farkas through playing the game and I was curious to find out what other people&#39;s thoughts and feelings were. The Companions feature heavily, and as far as I&#39;m concerned bluRaaven has them just right. Even though I was familiar with a lot of the events from playing through them, the author makes them even more intense by fleshing out the characters&#39; thoughts and feelings and putting them in context with a bigger story. It&#39;s exactly what fanfiction is supposed to be, in my opinion: taking what we love about the canon and exploring it in more detail than was possible in the source material. It&#39;s just awesome.<br><br>So... has anyone else read this? (Are you now?) Any thoughts on the Companions or <i>Skyrim</i> in general? Anything else fandom-related you wanna talk about?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Does this mean that I can discuss other things that I&#39;m interested in? Because I don&#39;t have Skyrim... stupid incompatible OS...<br><br>Ahem, anyway. I have a couple fandoms I feel I should discuss.<br><br>-Monster Musume/Daily Life with Monster GIrl-<br><br>My all-time favorite manga, it&#39;s an ecchi harem romantic comedy. I&#39;d like to know if there&#39;s any really good fanfiction for it... And I also want to know if anyone else here is familiar with it.<br><br>It&#39;s amazing, but almost every translated volume has opened at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list, and it&#39;s never too far from the top 10. It&#39;s unbelievable how a short, monthly series about cute monster girls is as popular, if not moreso than things like Bleach and Attack on Titan.<br><br>By the way, you can read it here (NSFW): <a href="http://mangapark.com/manga/monster-musume-no-iru-nichijou"><a href="http://mangapark.com/manga/monster-musume-no-iru-nichijou">http://mangapark.com/manga/monster-musume-no-iru-nichijou</a></a><br><br>-8-Bit Theater-<br><br>My favorite webcomic. I love the black humor that permeates it, and I feel like some elements would be useful maybe for the PPC. Unlike MonMusu, 8BT has almost NO fanfic, and the few that exist are Fighter/Black Mage friendship fics.<br><br><br><br>I really hope I didn&#39;t misunderstand what you were asking about...</p>

            <p>You asked for other fandom discussions? I&#39;m willing to provide.<br><br>For those of you that are unaware, <i>LoK</i> is the sequel animated series to <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>. Just two days ago, its grand finale aired on Nick.com. The <i>Airbender</i>verse, for all intents and purposes, has come to an end in regards to new canon. I&#39;ve been a fan of the universe since roughly the middle of the second original season. The writing is good, the characters are great, and the world-building blew me away. I&#39;m feeling a bit downcast about seeing it come to an end.<br><br>Canonically, anyway. The fandom will continue. Oh my yes. I will not spoil it in this post, but the last scene of that final episode... let&#39;s just say that some parts of the Internet are all abuzz with its implications. News hubs like Forbes and Huff Post have even weighed in (so be careful if you search, &#39;cause there be spoilers out there).<br><br>I will admit that I haven&#39;t watched the entire series due to things like time and forgetfulness, but I&#39;ve tried to keep up as best I could. Some parts felt rough to me early on in its run and it&#39;s definitely no <i>Last Airbender</i>. That being said, I still really enjoyed most of what I saw. I feel like I need to run through the whole thing one more time before I can make a final judgement, both on the series as a whole and the last episode. Not that I&#39;m complaining.<br><br>Has anyone else been following <i>LoK</i>? If so, what are your thoughts  on how the series went? The characters? The final episode and that last scene? Will you miss the <i>Airbender</i>verse, or is it never something you got into?<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>Phobos and I watched the last episodes yesterday. We definitely picked up on the possible implications of that last scene. I don&#39;t have an opinion about it one way or the other—or rather, I&#39;m all for it if they&#39;re serious, but if they&#39;re just doing it as a tease, then meh.<br><br>Anyway, I am sad the show has come to an end. I agree that the first couple of seasons were a bit rough, but I think they really learned from their mistakes in the third and fourth, and I caught some lines that even sounded like direct acknowledgement of the problems. It&#39;s nice to see that kind of dedication to making a good show.<br><br>The short length of the episodes means that things sometimes resolve a little too quickly for my liking, but on the other hand, oftentimes they still left me on the edge of my seat and bewildered that there was no more for the week, because I was so engrossed. (Phobos will attest that my reactions to the end credits suddenly rolling were pretty funny.)<br><br>I need to watch TLA again. It&#39;s been too long, and I&#39;ve forgotten a lot of the nuances that made it so great. My memory is weird... I remember the people and the broad strokes of the story, but details escape me, sometimes even important ones. On the other hand, I remember Iroh&#39;s favorite tea (jasmine), because Iroh is awesome. I miss that guy.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I also need to go through <i>Airbender</i> again. I barely remember much of anything besides the big story notes from the third season. Which is a shame, because I could have sworn there were some awesome character bits in there. There likely were; it was <i>Airbender</i>, for goodness sake.<br><br>Part of me does wish that the episodes were longer, if only because the arc of a 13-episode season can sometimes feel rushed (season 1 felt that way to me). But then the rational part of me goes &quot;An hour-long cartoon? No channel will approve that.&quot; Unfortunate.<br><br>As for the last scene, I&#39;m leaning more towards the creators being serious about their implications. Admittedly, my reasoning is based on observations and circumstantial evidence mixed with a bit of hopeful thinking. Like I mentioned in the previous post, I feel like I need to go through the entire series before making a final decision.</p>

Now that LoK is over, too... *sigh* It&#39;s like... a very bittersweet feeling, you know?<br><br>I went into LoK with low expectations; I didn&#39;t think anything could ever replace TLA.

            <p>Like you, I didn&#39;t think it would replace <i>Airbender</i>. I felt quite ho-hum about the first few episodes until I started thinking off it more as a stand-alone spinoff than a direct sequel. Like the <i>Next Generation</i> to the original <i>Star Trek</i> series. Once you take <i>Korra</i> out of its predecessor&#39;s shadow I feel it works much better.<br><br>I will say that I did like Korra right away. I liked the contrast between her and the more spiritual Aang. Her more questionable actions I attributed to a mix of her hotheadedness, ego, and lack of experience with the world at large. Time and experience obviously helped soften that. My biggest gripe with the first season was actually with Amon. It felt like things were too easy for him at times. He never really suffered a major setback until the very end. Just as having a poorly-executed invincible hero can be boring, so can an invincible villain.<br><br>Bolin&#39;s pretty rad. And don&#39;t worry, no spoilers from me.</p>

            <p>Mostly because they always seem to be written very poorly, regardless of medium or genre. It didn&#39;t help in this particular case that Mako always felt a bit bland to me. I never saw the appeal in him in the first season and so was never invested in the triangle.<br><br>I did like the waterbender angle they played with Amon, especially since almost all of the villains in <i>Airbender</i> were firebenders. I just wish he had suffered a few more setbacks along the way. Even Azula had some defeats to go with her losses (prior to her meltdown in season 3).</p>

            <p><i>Skyrim</i> (and, to an extent, much of the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> series as well) is one of those games I should have liked in theory. It&#39;s got a lot of good lore surrounding it and the world is incredibly well developed. I just felt that the main plot of the game was less interesting than the world in which is was set. Plus, I will admit that the gameplay never really hooked me. First-person melee combat is not something that I have ever really gotten a handle on, which is one of the reasons why I prefer Bethesda&#39;s take on <i>Fallout</i> over this. (The other main reason being that I grew up with the original <i>Fallout</i> whereas didn&#39;t find <i>Elder Scrolls</i> until <i>Oblivion</i>.<br><br>The experience wasn&#39;t all bad. The first time I fought a dragon was flipping&#39; rad. Well, second time -- fighting the dragon with my initial archery-focused character was a bit meh due to how little damage I was doing. The crafting system was pretty neat, too. I think I spent more time with that than actually in combat.<br><br>I will conclude by saying that Skyrim had some of my all time favorite<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQtTD5K52xI">video game</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvM9uwOcUc">trailers</a>. <i>&quot;But there is one they fear...</i>&quot; So cool.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>While I have been told on multiple occasions how good the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> is, and it looks absolutely fascinating, I&#39;ve never been able to play them because 1) my computer can&#39;t support the older games (pathetic, right?) and 2) <i>Skyrim</i> is rated M.

            <p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty original. Bethesda likes to throw in little references to other stuff—for instance, it&#39;s possible to discover an item called the Notched Pickaxe, and there&#39;s a character named Temba Wide-Arms, which might give you a chuckle if you&#39;re familiar with a certain episode of <i>Star Trek: TNG</i>. But, that aside, it&#39;s a very rich world with its own mythology, and each race has their own spin on it, which is fun.<br><br>The races are fairly unique, too. The three major divisions are Men (humans), Mer (elves), and the Beast-peoples. For humans, you&#39;ve got the Imperials (Roman-inspired), the Nords (Viking-inspired), the Bretons (English-inspired), and the Redguards (I don&#39;t know much about these guys). The elves are fun. You&#39;ve got your Bosmer (Wood Elves), Dunmer (Dark Elves), and Altmer (High Elves—these guys are real jerks), but then you&#39;ve also got the Orsimer (Orcs), the Dwemer (the lost race of Dwarves), and the Falmer (deep-dwelling, blind, not nice). The Beast-peoples are the Khajiit (cat-people) and Argonians (lizard-people).<br><br>But, returning to the game itself, the basic storyline is this: you are the Dragonborn, a legendary figure the likes of which hasn&#39;t been seen in hundreds of years, much like dragons themselves. Also, the dragons are returning to Skyrim. This is not a coincidence. Whether you&#39;ve appeared because of them, they&#39;ve appeared because of you, or both, isn&#39;t exactly clear. What IS clear is that they&#39;re bad news, and you&#39;re the only one with a hope of dealing with the problem.<br><br>Meanwhile, there&#39;s a civil war going on with factions supporting the Imperials on one side and the Stormcloaks on the other. The Empire has recently signed a treaty with the Altmer that outlaws worship of Talos, a figure particularly revered in Skyrim because he was a Nord who ascended to godhood through his great deeds, and many people aren&#39;t particularly thrilled with being told who they can and can&#39;t worship. It&#39;s pretty clear that the Altmer are bad news, but on the other hand, with the threat of dragons looming, now is not a great time for Skyrim to be divided against itself. Nobody&#39;s really in the right. You can choose to take a side, but you don&#39;t have to.<br><br>In fact, you can avoid the main storyline forever if you want to, too. One of the great things about the game is that you&#39;re not really forced into anything once you escape the first scenario.<br><br>I can&#39;t think of any other fantasy it draws on in particular. Skyrim kinda reminds me of Middle-earth, but I think that&#39;s only because there&#39;s a sense of grandeur and rugged beauty about them both. (And Skyrim really is gorgeous. At night, when the Northern Lights are out... stunning. [It might be useful to know that I&#39;m very picky about games: they have to be nice to look at and listen to for long periods of time, or I just can&#39;t be bothered.]) The Nords and the Rohirrim are drawn from the same stock, certainly, but they&#39;re definitely distinct. The game also shares certain aspects with other RPGs—get into encounters, fight, loot treasure wherever you can get away with it, gain XP, gain levels and special abilities—but again, it has its own distinct flavor that makes it more than a D&amp;D knockoff. And anyway, I like D&amp;D.<br><br>I really enjoy the amount of detail put into it, though. Throughout the world, there are books you can pick up and read that give you information about the history of Tamriel; and some are just amusing little yarns. I spend a lot of time reading in this game. ^_^; And then, the people each have their own little stories. I talk to just about everybody, just to see who they are. You can&#39;t engage in dialogue with everyone, but apart from the guards, they almost all have something unique to say. It&#39;s the little details like this that drew me in. The main story is interesting, but I like a world I can really sink my teeth into, and this fits the bill. It&#39;s absolutely huge. I&#39;ve explored a fair bit of it by now, and there&#39;s still a lot more I haven&#39;t seen.<br><br>... That&#39;s a lot of words, and I&#39;m not sure how many of them actually address your question. Let me know!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll let Nesh or others explain more of they want but while they do some of the typical high fantasy ish stuff the lore goes in a lot of original directions. Sure there&#39;s elves everywhere, but even the Altmer are pretty distinct from the archetypical brooding high elf, and some are cannibals. The moon, stars and sun? Gaping holes in reality we see as spheres because we can&#39;t process what we&#39;re seeing. There&#39;s a godlike ability known as CHIM which is basically being able to use console commands in real life (the setting seems to implicitly acknowledge that the universe really is a game and things like player characters exist), the planes of Oblivion are basically other planets connected to the main setting by portals and stuff, in one province of the Empire they use gigantic insects as a means of travel and lots of structures are built out of said gigantic insects or mushrooms, one of the races is connected to a psychic hivemind of sapient trees that can mindjack them all at once if need be (such as to trounce an invasion from Oblivion so badly the baddies closed all the portals to that area because they were being <i>counter</i> invaded), there&#39;s magic spaceships, moon bases and swords sharp enough to cut atoms and cause nuclear explosions in some of the books, etc. While the games are often so so the setting itself is pretty neat and not as generic as, say, Oblivion (the game) makes it look.</p>

            <p>I tend to go on Skyrim kicks from time to time depending on if I want to play an RPGS or not. I try to make a character stick, but it always seems to go towards &quot;heavily armored warrior with hints of magic and backstabbing&quot;. Maybe I need to limit myself more. <br><br>The Companions line was great. I kinda spoiled it for myself by reading the Skyrim page on TVTropes, but it was cool to see how certain characters fleshed out in it.  My one gripe with Skyrim&#39;s story involves a certain sect of dragon killers you resurrect, and how they order you around so much despite claiming to serve you. Mods help, but it just isn&#39;t the same. Anyway, I love the game, can&#39;t wait for the next one, and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone that hasn&#39;t played yet. The PC version with all DLC is pretty cheap on Steam right now!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure all the Dragonborn are the worst at it. {X D There are just too many distractions!<br><br>I&#39;ve only got the one character so far, who started out basically being me. I just sorta felt my way around at first, figuring out what I liked. What I ended up with is a Breton who sucks at magic, but goes around in ebony armor and destroys things with an axe and shield. She&#39;s also an alchemist, which is sorta tied to magic, so my backstory for her is that she&#39;s actually half Nord, half Breton, and she picked up her warrior skills from her Nord mom while learning alchemy from her Breton grandmother. What her dad&#39;s like, I dunno. I also haven&#39;t yet figured out how she ended up in position to be captured in an Imperial raid. I kinda feel like she was trying to get <i>out</i> of Skyrim rather than into it, though, and just ended up stuck there because of everything that happened in Helgen. <br><br>I haven&#39;t finished the game, either. I&#39;m to the point where I&#39;m supposed to infiltrate a certain upper-crust party, which I know is going to be a disaster, and it kinda scares me. I&#39;m level 40, though, so I kinda feel like it&#39;s high time I sucked it up and got it over with. I&#39;ve been working on my sneaking ability and collecting invisibility potions, so I&#39;m hoping I can make it through without bringing a bunch of guards down on my head. We&#39;ll see!<br><br>Heh, the University quest line also scares me. I got as far as the first leg of it, and then when the guy said &quot;Hey, someone better go tell the Arch-mage about this!&quot; I was like, &quot;Uh, sure! &gt;.&gt; &quot; and took off. I shall never speak to the Arch-mage again. I&#39;m having fun collecting books for Urag gro-Shub, though. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>
