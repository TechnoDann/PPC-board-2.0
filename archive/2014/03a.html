            <p>Is there a comic/ Tv show/ book you like that not many people know about? If so here is the place to talk about it. And if you like anything posted here please feel free to check it out. My pick has two titles but I know it best as Arata the Legend. It&#39;s a manga about a boy from a fantasy land,and a boy from modern Japan who switch places( both are named Arata). Twist comes into play when one of the Aratas have been framed for a crime he didn&#39;t commit, leaving the other to clear his name, and stop the real criminals. The design of the mystical world were quite good, and the story arcs for supporting charcters kept me interested. There is a love triangle in later chapters, but that&#39;s kind of a staple for this author.</p>

            <p>it&#39;s Baroque, I&#39;m talking about a game published by Atlus, it&#39;s confusing but is still interesting. the problem is, the story is scattered all around the game, litteraly, you might see the end befre the climax of the story and this basically block almost any way of writting something to this game.<br><br>there&#39;s also the manga Zekkiou Gakkiuu, which is basically a manga that tell some creepy stories at each chapter.</p>

            <p>Another Parasol Protectorate fan :) .  Have you read the Finishing School books, in the same universe (about 25 years earlier)?  They&#39;re Young Adult, so they&#39;re in a different section of the bookstore.  The second one felt a bit rushed at the end, though.<br><br>The Lord Darcy books/stories by Randall Garrett are quite good.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any fanfiction in that universe.  At least, all I get from the Pit&#39;s search function is Pride and Prejudice fanfics.<br><br>If you like mysteries, Clayton Rawson wrote four novels and several short stories in the late 1930s-early 1940s featuring the Great Merlini, a stage magician turned amateur detective.  They&#39;re out of print, but available on Kindle.<br><br></p>

            <p>They&#39;re even harder to find than the Great Merlini, but if you&#39;ve got a decent used bookstore in your area see if they&#39;ve got any of Isaac Asimov&#39;s &quot;Black Widowers&quot; collections.

            <p>I&#39;m gonna throw one out here. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, a book by Jesse Andrews about a couple of high school students who double as amateur filmmakers. One&#39;s mother forces him to make friends with a girl who has leukemia. Hilarity (and more foul language than you can shake a stick at) ensues. Oddly, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever found any fanfiction for it, but it&#39;s definitely one of my favorite books and I really wish it were more popular.</p>

            <p>My dad even picked up a signed copy of the eleventh book when he was in Australia! It&#39;s definitely my third favorite series of all time. :3 <br><br>An interesting note is that John Flanagan wrote a classic Mary Sue in the twelfth book. I&#39;ll try to avoid spoilers, but you have been warned. Anyway, she&#39;s a princess, she becomes the first female Ranger apprentice, and she thinks she can get her own way all the time. But by the end of the book, you can definitely tell there&#39;s been some character development in her. She no longer thinks she&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread and definitely learns a lesson in humility. <br><br>Also Will totally schools her. It&#39;s awesome.</p>

            <p>What is FTL, you ask?<br><br><i>FTL: Faster Than Light</i> is a roguelike game in which you are the commander of a warship carrying secret data essential to the survival of the Federation, which has been beaten back by a fanatical humans-before-aliens Rebellion. The goal of the game is to cross eight space sectors (maps composed of randomly generated waypoints with one exit beacon to the next sector) to reach the last Federation armada and to deliver the data. You don&#39;t have time to explore the universe freely however: the Rebel fleet is in hot pursuit and is much too powerful for you to fight.<br><br>Aside from that, there&#39;s no actual plot to the game. Sure, there are quite a few nuggets of lore to be found when you land on certain beacons, but the main attraction is the story you create as you gain or lose crew, fight enemy ships, upgrade your ship, find new weapons, help civilians, perform daring boarding maneuvers, fight <s>demonic</s> giant spiders, elude the Rebels, discover strange new worlds, and turn hopeless situations around with your peerless tactical cunning:<br><br><img src="http://www.8bitsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/url-1.jpeg" alt="http://www.8bitsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/url-1.jpeg"><br><font size="2">Source: Virtual Shackles</font> <br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiXWfxHHdAU">Plus, its title theme music is pure awesome</a>.</p>

            <p>Fly the Kestrel for your victory run. It&#39;s one of the best-balanced ships in the game and you can install all the subsystems on it.<br><br>Spend as much time exploring: don&#39;t rush the exit beacon. The goal is to maximize the scrap collection from each sector. Watch your fuel, though. <br><br>Upgrade shields to level 2 no later than Sector 3, level 3 by sector 6, and level 4 by the final sector. <br><br>Upgrade engines all the way up to two levels under maximum by the endgame. You don&#39;t really need the last two. <br><br>Make sure your weapons system can handle your current loadout-- and a bit extra. Getting shot in the weapons bay is never fun, and extra power bars can act as a buffer against damage. <br><br>Upgrade scanners to lvl 2 only.<br><br>Spend money on doors. It helps contain boarders and the blasted boarding drones. Don&#39;t forget that you can vent people out into space if need be; turn off O<sub>2</sub> to speed up the process. Don&#39;t screw up like me and forget to turn it back on afterwards. <br><br>Upgrade Life Support, Helm, and Medbay to lvl 2 when you have the cash. As mentioned above, having an extra bar (even unpowered) helps you shrug off a shot that would have otherwise crippled those subsystems.<br><br>Prepare a boarding party and buy the Crew Teleporter. Killing off enemy crews gives you a bigger scrap haul than blowing up a ship. It will also help you for the final fight, hint hint. <br><br>Buy the Cloaking Device, but only use one bar of cloak for a faster recharge time. Only use it when shields are down and shots are incoming or whenever a missile has been fired.<br><br>The Drone Bay isn&#39;t worth your scrap, IMO. It&#39;s a drain on reactor power anyways. <br><br>Stay the heck away from the Giant Killer Spider event unless you have an Anti-Bio beam. Same thing for the travelling Zoltan Planet.<br><br>Kill those filthy Rebels, even if they beam aboard and surrender. <br><br>Spacebar is your friend. Use the pause function to plan your next few shots.<br><br>Always fire everything you got in a single volley: you&#39;ll make sure you can deplete the enemy&#39;s shields and do some hull damage.<br><br>Does your opponent have an ion/missile/bomb weapon? Shoot their weapons bay first. If not, go for their shields.<br><br>Are your shots going wide? Shoot the enemy&#39;s Helm. Most ships only have 1 point in Helm, so destroying it makes sure all of your hits land. <br><br>Pray to the RNG god and hope you don&#39;t get bad events.<br><br><br>Source: 40+ hours of gameplay experience.</p>

            <p>None. Now, books or TV shows or such that nobody knows about that I enjoy, those I have plenty of. To me, a fandom refers to a community of fans, and to be honest, except for MLP, Dr. Who, and the occasional dabble into Sherlock, Portal, or Elder Scrolls, I don&#39;t interact with any fandoms. Oh well.<br><br>One book that I&#39;m really into right now is Feed, by M. T. Anderson. Be warned, this book has <i>a lot</i> of swearing. It has a point for existing, but if you don&#39;t like that<br><br>I would explain what it is about, but part of the thrill of the book is when it hits you what is going on, and to spoil it would rob you of a fantastic experience. Give it a few chapters before judging it though, trust me on this one. You may be confused but, really, just read it. If you can, get the audio book, it&#39;s even better through this medium. Really. It&#39;s good as a book, but brilliant as an audio book. But however you will, just read/listen to it. it&#39;s great. Should be mandatory reading for high school students.</p>

            <p>I tend to get into the more obscure/underrated/less publicized iterations of popular fandoms. <br><br>The Wizard of Oz. L. Frank Baum wrote 14 books, and the fact that so few people know that has been a source of great pain to me ever since I read them all as a little kid. If anyone wants me to give you reasons to read them, ask. I&#39;ll gush.<br><br>Star Trek. I like TNG, DS9, and Voyager better than TOS or reboot, and I&#39;m slowly coming to the realization that I think DS9 is the best series. TNG has a special place in my heart, so it&#39;s still my favorite, but DS9 is so well-written and complex. And it&#39;s probably the most underrated of the Star Trek series besides Enterprise. Again, if anyone wants me to gush, ask.<br><br>I prefer the Heroes of Olympus series to Percy Jackson, because while I absolutely love and adore Percy Jackson and please don&#39;t ever get the impression I don&#39;t, the second series has a lot more characters with a lot more development because instead one first person narrator most of the main characters have some third person limited narration. Plus, more representation and an queer character in a children&#39;s book series.<br><br>I&#39;ve also watched a bit of Classic Who (First and Second Doctor) but none of New Who.<br><br>An actual obscure fandom, though...Magic School Bus. Yep.</p>

            <p>This is very much my jam.<br><br>---<br><br><i><b>Skulduggery Pleasant</b></i><br>It&#39;s a pretty simple chosen girl narrative of the kind we here at the PPC often end up writing missions about. However, it&#39;s done with its tongue shoved firmly in its cheek: the stupid names are there because if someone has your given name, they have power over you; the magical powers are well thought-out and well developed (for instance, an Elementalist can create a fireball with a snap o&#39; the fingers because it generates friction and heat, which blossoms into flame); the teenage female lead does not always need the good guy to rescue her; and the good guy is pale and thin and interesting on account of being a <i>skeleton</i>. It&#39;s planned to be a nine-book series, it&#39;s really bloody funny, check it out.<br><br><i><b>Hyperdrive</b></i><br>Often seen as a direct successor of the more famous <i>Red Dwarf</i> by people given to spectacularly missing the point, Hyperdrive does share some traits with that series but is very much its own thing. For one thing, it makes space travel seem normal and almost banal in places. For another, it relentlessly mocks that era of sci-fi where the sets were cheaper than Nollywood films made by people I will charitably describe as mental (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z4XeiIDtQ4">Baby Police</a>, anyone?). However, the real strength of the show lies in the central trio of Nick Frost, Kevin Eldon, and an early TV showing for Miranda Hart as the bridge crew of the HMS <i>Camden Lock</i>. Highlights include a glorious spoof of Kirk and Spock playing chess together... involving Ker-Plunk.<br><br><i><b>The Thick Of It</b></i><br>In the States, the archetypal political drama is The West Wing, which featured important, noble, upstanding people doing important, noble, upstanding things to bring a bright new future to the good ol&#39; US of A. In the UK, it&#39;s a toss-up between House Of Cards (the original, not the Kevin Spacey one), State Of Play, and The Thick Of It, which is my personal favourite of the lot. Shot like a fly-on-the-wall documentary, it features incompetent, dishonest ministers in a dead-end job bickering with each other and doing nothing of worth. This probably says a lot about both our respective nations. The director, Armando Iannucci, has also made In The Loop and Veep on similar premises, so feel free to check them out if the idea of fascinatingly baroque swearing coming from the mouth of the 12th Doctor puts you off.<br><br><i><b>The Binding Of Isaac</b></i><br>I&#39;ve talked about this game before - in fact, it was one of the first things I ever talked about on the Board - but The Binding of Isaac is one of the most fascinating games I&#39;ve played from a story standpoint. Its use of mechanics as metaphor is deep and incredibly rich, and the central story is told entirely through the game with only minimal cutscenes bookending the experience. If you like hard-as-nails top-down rogue-lites with story chops and a very interesting take on childhood, check it out. Actually, check out the remake that comes out this year. It&#39;ll probably have more stuff to analyse to death in it.<br><br>---<br><br>There&#39;s lots more I could talk about, but you&#39;re probably sick of this already. I&#39;ll take my leave. =]</p>

            <p>It was a UK children&#39;s TV show that got cancelled about two decades ago. It involved a team of four - one &#39;dungeoneer&#39; and the other three guiding him/her through a dungeon drawn with a mixture of hand drawing and early CG. It was almost like a sort of Dungeons and Dragons setting, except it was based around puzzles, skill, answering questions correctly etc.<br><br>In addition, due to the method of producing the rooms, the dungeoneer wore a helmet that allowed him/her to only see around their feet, meaning the rest of the team had to give them navigation instructions (potentially avoiding traps and pits, requiring timing etc.).<br><br>It was also known for being very hard, with only a handful of the many teams actually passing through the three levels of the dungeon and completing their quests. One might say is was analogous in difficulty to other children&#39;s gameshows as Dark Souls is to other modern computer games.<br><br>I managed to sneak my agents a visit to the Knightmare continuum during the HQ Blackout (<a href="http://cyba-zero.livejournal.com/3065.html"><a href="http://cyba-zero.livejournal.com/3065.html">http://cyba-zero.livejournal.com/3065.html</a></a>, <a href="http://cyba-zero.livejournal.com/3204.html"><a href="http://cyba-zero.livejournal.com/3204.html">http://cyba-zero.livejournal.com/3204.html</a></a>), and Knightmare still has a fan site (<a href="http://www.knightmare.com/"><a href="http://www.knightmare.com/">http://www.knightmare.com/</a></a>). At the time of the Blackout visit, I think only two or three PPCers recognised it, so I&#39;d say it counts as a rare fandom.</p>

            <p>As one of those few people who recognised it, I&#39;d say that it counts as a rare fandom. There are still episodes up on youtube, as well as clip compilations(some of which are funny, and some of which just go to highlight how absurdly difficult it was).  <br><br>I seem to remember another show with a similar set up, I think it might have come later, that was sci-fi themed rather than fantasy. The kids had to travel up through a series of floors with Knightmare style traps/puzzles, and I think they were trying to get to the penthouse (and then maybe escape?). No idea if it was actually related to Knightmare in any way. <br><br>Your agents&#39; trip into Knightmare is still one of my favourite Blackout pieces. </p>

            <p>I was rereading some of the Original Series recently to refresh myself on a few things, and discovered something odd in <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/theluggagerunsoffwiththeonering.html">the Discworld crossover mission</a>. The story begins with Jay picking Acacia up from the lightsaber training course mentioned at the end of the Star Wars crossover two stories earlier, and the instructor there is a character that to my knowledge has never been shown or referenced anywhere else, referred to as the Greenman. I thought it was a Flower at first, since it oversees a specific Department-mandated function, namely weapons training and/or distribution of instructional material(presumably within the DO) and is described as having &quot;fronds&quot;. Greenman would be a bit of a silly name for a plant, but a bit of research dug up three possible candidates, the most likely being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomatium_greenmanii">Greenman&#39;s Desert Parsley</a>.<br>However, it speaks out loud, rather than telepathically, and <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/whatmighthavebeen.html">even in the Original Series</a>, the Flowers&#39; telepathy is represented by speaking in italics without quotation marks. That could be written off as Jay or Acacia having forgotten about that quirk if not for the fact that later description shows that it has a face and at least one limb. I did a little more research to try and figure out if this was the name of some species that I didn&#39;t know about, but I couldn&#39;t come up with anything. The closest I could find was a Germanic mythological creature referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Man">the Green Man</a>. There&#39;s a space between &quot;Green&quot; and &quot;man&quot;, so it&#39;s not a perfect match, but that&#39;s not too much of a concern. The PPC&#39;s Greenman had its name uncapitalized one of the times it was mentioned, so it&#39;s possible that there were just a few typographical errors. Or, perhaps the source that Jay or Acacia found out about the original folklore from didn&#39;t use the space. This interpretation has another problem, though: the Green Man is a disembodied head with several plants growing from its face and out of its nose and mouth. It doesn&#39;t have any limbs, yet the Greenman in the TOS mission is said to have &quot;pointed with a shaking limb towards the Box&quot;. It could have been a tree branch, I suppose, since those are occasionally referred to as &quot;limbs&quot;, but that&#39;s not indicated, and if it did have branches, why would the word &quot;frond&quot; have been used earlier?<br><br>So, does anyone know what&#39;s going on here? Does anyone remember authorial intent for this character, or have a good guess regarding what species it might be? There could easily be some obscure canonical creature that I was never aware of that Jay and Acacia could be referencing, but I can&#39;t determine anything one way or the other with the information that I have.<br><br>And if nobody else has any idea what to make of this, does anyone have some suggestions of what we can do regarding the Greenman? Since the &quot;instructor&quot; and the &quot;Greenman&quot; are never explicitly identified as being the same, I suppose that if pressed, it could be retroactively established that there were two instructors, one being a Flower and another being some green-skinned alien, but the original material doesn&#39;t say anything to support that there was a second instructor present. It doesn&#39;t say anything <i>against</i> it, true, but that option still strikes me as problematic.</p>

            <p>So much as he is a major figure of pre-Christian worship throughout Europe that got picked up on by New Age-ism and the Wicca revival in the &#39;70s. He&#39;s a sort of benevolent earth-spirit thing, kinda like if Captain Planet was mixed with a slightly nicer Odin. He also has a counterpart called Jack-in-the-Green, who&#39;s got more than a few similarities to Loki&#39;s traditional role as a trickster and general baddie.<br><br>But you wanted to talk about the plant. Well, bearing in mind that the word limb is used and it speaks out loud, I&#39;m more inclined to think it&#39;s one of the more benevolent Firstborn, possibly one that revolves around sapient pearwood considering the Discworld connection. We know that Flowers don&#39;t necessarily have to be World One flowers - the Bonsai Mallorn&#39;s proof of that - and the more comic edge to the dialogue would support it further, given how funny Discworld is.<br><br>Then again, it could&#39;ve just been something that slipped through the editing process (the word englassesed, and I use the term &quot;word&quot; quite wrongly, is used in the Original Series at one point, though it escapes me as to where) and we&#39;re massively overthinking it. Meh. Overthinking trivial details is sort of what we <i>do</i>. =]</p>

            <p>I found a number of places that supposedly were the initial propagators of the Green Man&#39;s mythology. I just lumped them all together into &quot;Germanic&quot; because I didn&#39;t want to go into a list of all of the disparate European locations it popped up in. I probably should have just said &quot;European&quot;, in retrospect, but that seems terribly generic.<br>I didn&#39;t know about that Jack-in-the-Green bit, though. Was he part of the original folklore, or was he created during that 70&#39;s New Age-ism you mentioned?<br><br>The Firstborn don&#39;t speak out loud, though. The Sunflower Official, the Marquis de Sod, and the Big Thorn are all Firstborn, and the only time any one of them has spoken non-telepathically was one time when the Big Thorn was under the sway of an Agent-Sue who was so desperate to hear that she&#39;d done well that she forgot how the Flowers worked.<br>Did sapient pearwood have a face? The Greenman definitely had a face, and since said face was described as both &quot;jolly&quot; and &quot;twitching&quot;, I don&#39;t know that it can be attributed to part of a bloom or something. Also, it wasn&#39;t really that the Greenman was connected to Discworld. The mission contained in the story just went to Discworld. If anything, the Greenman might be connected to Star Wars, since it was apparently the go-to entity for supervising inexperienced lightsaber-wielders.</p>

            <p>... by way of <a href="http://www.greenmanlongitchington.co.uk/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/MerryWoodman.jpg">images like this</a>, quite obvious that the Greenman is the Green Man? And that, like Little Otik in the mailroom, he&#39;s just another one of the plant-themed higher-ups in HQ? Remember, the whole idea of the Firstborn is a post-J&amp;A creation. The closest we get to an explanation for the Flowers is a statement somewhere - it may not be TOS, I can&#39;t find it in there - that the Flowers &#39;replaced all the human directors years ago&#39;. Heck, the capitalised Flowers isn&#39;t common in TOS - they&#39;re Upstairs.<br><br>So no, I think it&#39;s pretty clear the Greenman is just the Green Man. He talks because he&#39;s a man with a face. He&#39;s in HQ because he&#39;s plant-themed. And he&#39;s the lightsaber instructor because, well, someone has to be.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I know what a Green Man looks like; I researched it before making that post, in part to check the character&#39;s background and in part to see whether it was part of a species rather than an individual. It wasn&#39;t, but that&#39;s only tangentially related to the affairs here, since recruiting duplicates of mythological figures isn&#39;t out of the question. I remember that July recruited a version of Asclepius for the Medical Department one time, so there&#39;s precedent for it. Maybe Montgomery Osbert or one of the other first-generation Agents could have found a Green Man in the early days due to a particularly confusing typo or poorly phrased simile. (By the way, that version of the Green Man that you linked didn&#39;t have limbs <i>or</i> fronds, so it couldn&#39;t be the Greenman.)<br><br>I don&#39;t think that anything is &quot;obvious&quot; with this little to go off of, though. Anything can be construed as &quot;obvious&quot; if someone makes logical jumps in the right places. We don&#39;t have a lot of description to work with here, so plenty of potential identities for the currently mysterious Greenman could seem obvious to different people. To you, that bronze man-faced bloom form of the Green Man is the clearest interpretation. To me, the mythological identity is still unlikely, especially if the supposed point of clarity for that explanation is that the Greenman would have been created as an extension of the &quot;plant theme&quot;. It seems strange to me that the officials of the PPC would follow the pattern of &quot;sunflower, lichen, processed wood, daisy, mythological representation of the spirit of the earth&quot;. The last entry just doesn&#39;t seem to match the pattern set by the first few. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible; if I thought that, I wouldn&#39;t have put it up for consideration at all, but it&#39;s not a clear-cut solution. <br>Also, since the Greenman was never mentioned or fully described anywhere else, he is only being defined now, using the understanding of PPC continuity that is currently in use. Whatever we decide here would need to be compatible with that. I&#39;m not trying to go against the original writing here, and any authorial intent that someone manages to dig up will trump anything else we decide, but I sincerely doubt we&#39;ll find any.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t the one who suggested that the Greenman might have been a Firstborn. While applying the term to him would explain his unusual identifier, should he happen to be a Flower, I&#39;m fully aware that the Firstborn concept was your creation, enacted years after the departure of Jay and Acacia to explain why some Flowers have names while others do not. It wouldn&#39;t have been mentioned within the Original Series itself.<br><br>Actually, now that I think about it, the Greenman might not be part of Upstairs at all. The plants Upstairs were usually obeyed and minded by the Agents, albeit in a chiefly mocking and sardonic manner, while the Greenman&#39;s only appearance seems to characterize him as a put-upon instructor who was never taken seriously by his students and mostly wanted them out of his sight as soon as possible, which doesn&#39;t fit with the rest of the PPC officials we see in Jay and Acacia&#39;s missions. He could easily just be some guy assigned by what we would now call the Department of Operations to supervise processes like an Agent&#39;s first lightsaber training because, as you said, someone&#39;s got to do it. He could easily just be some plant-based alien who was named Greenman upon recruitment or mockingly given that name by his students.</p>

            <p>-The image I linked was to highlight that many depictions of the Green Man are &#39;jolly&#39;. Not all, but most. The face-in-isolation is a fairly common find in European gardens (my parents have one, actually); the full, costumed figure appears in numerous village festivals. The word &#39;Man&#39; fairly clearly indicates that he has limbs, rather than just being a stylised face, neh?<br><br>-You describe Little Otik as &#39;processed wood&#39; - that&#39;s a <i>very</i> new interpretation (Phobos&#39;, I think). Your list should actually read: &#39;sunflower, lichen, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Otik">mythological character from Czech folklore</a>, daisy drawn by one of Jay&#39;s friends, mythological character from German folklore&#39;. See why he fits the list now?<br><br>Jay and Acacia weren&#39;t building a comprehensive mythology - they were putting in random references to whatever seemed funny. I think it&#39;s virtually undisputable that the &#39;Greenman&#39; is the Green Man - possibly by way of cross-contamination with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Giant">jolly green giant</a>.<br><br>What you feel like making him in the shared universe, since authorial intent is <i>not</i> more important than what actually gets written, is up to you - or whoever feels like using him.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Not my interpretation, actually.  I got my information from the wiki.  Looking into it, this appears to be Rodtheanimegod4ever&#39;s interpretation from back in 2009.

            <p>Referring to something in folklore with a variant on &quot;man&quot; usually means more that the creature in question looks more human-like than beast-like, not necessarily that it has a fully humanoid body, but if there is a version of the Green Man that has actual arms and/or legs, I suppose it&#39;s a distinct possibility, since that would fill out all of the in-text requirements.<br>I&#39;m looking at the original archived list of all of the Departments and Heads Jay and Acacia created, and while Otik is the only one who is a PPC official named after a mythological character instead of being named for and based on a plant species(or a plant/fungus composite in the Lichen&#39;s case), he&#39;s also the only one listed under &quot;support staff&quot;, so that may start a different pattern, and the Greenman is definitely support staff far more then he is anything else. I&#39;m grasping at straws here to find a connection, though, and that worries me a little.<br><br>You&#39;re right; written work would supersede authorial intent. I was just saying that authorial intent would supersede outside supposition, and even though this is a shared universe, anything we say on the Board is only educated guessing from a continuity standpoint until someone writes it down in a canonical context, in which case those transcribed ideas would become written work. I wasn&#39;t intending to imply otherwise.<br><br>Mostly, though, I was just wanting some new information and/or some fun suggestions for the Greenman&#39;s identity when I started this thread. I guess I&#39;m just not satisfied with saying it&#39;s definitely the Green Man, because if I was, I&#39;d have accepted that as the truth-until-proven-otherwise when I first found out what a Green Man was and moved on. I will if it&#39;s the best option, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be the most fun that way, and I think this thread&#39;s descent into the two of us growing attached to small points supporting or denying one side or the other might be driving away people who could otherwise offer ideas, and I don&#39;t want that. That&#39;s not what the PPC is about.</p>

            <p>That if we see a man-shaped, leafy entity called a Greenman, it&#39;s probably a Greenman (or Green Man), not <s>a zebra</s> some other, more exotic thing. Jay and Acacia didn&#39;t appear to think it needed much of an explanation, so the obvious answer is most likely the correct one.<br><br>The closest I can come to an alternative explanation is the Greenwitch from the book by the same name in the <i>Dark Is Rising</i> series. The Greenwitch is... pretty much the same thing as a Green Man: a human-shaped construct of branches and leaves, in this case made to be thrown into the ocean in a ritual to ensure a bountiful harvest. Her name is even spelled as one word, like the Greenman in TOS, and I think she has a degree of sentience due to Wild Magic or something; I&#39;m not really sure. It&#39;s been ages since I read those books.<br><br>I&#39;m not personally interested in making the Greenman&#39;s identity more complicated than it needs to be, though. Not everything needs volumes of explanation, especially if it&#39;s only come up the once in over ten years. If someone wants to write about lightsaber instruction and bring the guy back, that&#39;s awesome, but otherwise I&#39;m fine with him just being a guy Jay and Acacia met once and didn&#39;t really get along with. *shrug*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That sounds like fun! I don&#39;t know anything about the Greenwitch, though, so I probably couldn&#39;t write it myself.<br><br>Hmm, but how AU would it be? Would it just be similar to the standard PPC, except more plant-people Agents are there, or an inversion in which the Agents are mostly plant-people and the Heads are meat creatures of some sort, or some third possibility, maybe involving robots? I like the second, but making the Heads just humans would be boring.<br>Ooh, maybe in that universe, instead of having plants coming to life and gaining psychic powers and sapience through radiation, it would be non-sapient sea creatures that became telepathic and intelligent! Then again, that may be a bit too silly, but my first thought of what the Head of the DMS could be in the plant-people AU was an amphibious giant squid(since, you know, plant-people being led by non-anthropomorphic plants would be a little too obvious), and I am about 60% sure that it is not a stupid idea. The other 40% is saying that it&#39;s so stupid that I shouldn&#39;t even click the Post Reply button and show it to the world, but too late! There it goes!</p>

            <p>-The Greenwitch, physically, is a bundle of twigs vaguely shaped like a woman. Rather tricky to bring her to HQ.<br><br>-The Greenwitch is arguably a canon character. I say arguably, because I <i>think</i> she&#39;s technically a new person each year. Still, recruiting a canon character is why it&#39;s probably AU.<br><br>-I don&#39;t have access to <i>Greenwitch</i> at the moment, which is why it would be very hard to write, even if I could solve problem 1 without just turning her into a generic character.<br><br>-It is, I think, implied that the Greenwitch gains both her sentience and power from Tethys, goddess of the ocean. If this is true, then removing her from the ocean might well revert her to a mess of sticks.<br><br>-Finally, the Wild Magic is... well, wild. Neither light nor dark. In D&amp;D terms, the Greenwitch would be very much Chaotic Neutral. She almost brings ruin on the whole world because she doesn&#39;t want to give up her treasure. I&#39;m not sure she could handle a standard PPC mission - particularly not if something catches her eye to steal.<br><br>-And the Green Knight Man sings all the time. Leaving aside the fact that songs have <i>power</i> in some worlds - do you know how annoying that might be?<br><br>(Possible solution to some of those: if the Green Man is part of the Wild Magic, he - and his song - might be enough to allow the Greenwitch to maintain herself.

            <p>You know what this means: at some point in the future, you will have to confront RinaAndRanda (Rina) in a battle for supremacy, to see who can truly bear the Rina name. As is tradition, it will likely take place on top of a tall spire or on a bridge stretching over a canyon, so you might want to start looking for one of those soon. It would be an unspeakable hassle to go and find a good climactic battle location at the last minute.<br><br>You&#39;ll probably need to wield some sweet energy weapons, too, for extra excitement and drama, but luckily for you, I&#39;ve got a few cases of them right here, and in honor of today&#39;s Permission Giver birthday celebration, I&#39;m offering you and your counterpart your choice of armament for free! I&#39;m partial to the plasma claws, myself, but that&#39;s mainly because I&#39;ve always been a fan of that arm-mounted dual claw weapon that I was never able to find the name of. I&#39;d be the first to admit that they don&#39;t exactly have the best reach, but they&#39;re absolutely vicious in close combat.<br>Also, Phobos can help himself to any of the weapons if he comes down to this part of the thread. It&#39;s his birthday, after all!<br><br>Wait, are you the original Rina from last year, or are you Rina from RinaAndRanda? Because if you are RinaAndRanda (Rina), be aware that there is/was someone who used the name Rina in the past, and if she returns, you using her former screen name would likely spur on the battle for supremacy that I&#39;ve spent the majority of this post talking about. I&#39;ll give you the energy weaponry either way, though. Just wanted to give you a heads-up.</p>

            <p>It wasn&#39;t a warning as in &quot;other Rina will hunt you down&quot;, more a &quot;you&#39;ll need to know that there&#39;ll probably be a fight for supremacy in your future&quot;, or in a Doylist sense, &quot;you should be aware that if you use that screen name, we will have two Boarders named Rina&quot;. As far as I know, you don&#39;t actually need to hide from anything. It&#39;s a perfectly reasonable mistake to make.<br><br>Regarding the separated screen names for RinaAndRanda, the search bar tells me that you used to go by artemis.hunt when you first arrived. Perhaps you or Randa could use a variation of that, unless you abandoned the screen name because you began to dislike it. On the other hand, there <i>was</i> formerly a Boarder named Artemis who wrote for the Bad Role-play Department, so that might create confusion, but on the gripping hand, we have at least three Boarders whose screen names are derived from &quot;Kitty_____&quot;, so that might not be nearly as big as issue as I&#39;m making it out to be.</p>

            <p>Either you attach a normal doc (.doc, .docx, .rtf) to your e-mail, and we communicate by e-mail. <br><br>Or you include only a link to a gdoc into your e-mail. Obviously this gdoc cannot be private, because I wouldn’t see it, but it may be hidden by the fact that only you and I know where it is. Apparently it is possible to enable commenting for everybody who has the link to the gdoc (but I don’t know exactly how the gdoc’s owner does this). In this case, I wouldn’t need to quote parts of the document to point you to where my comment belongs; I could highlight a word in the gdoc and attach a comment to it.  That’s what I did when I beta read for the first time. <br><br>There may also be options to limit access to a gdoc to specific persons who need to login, but this wouldn’t work for me, because I don’t intend to create an account. So, if you want to share your gdoc with me, you may want to copy it to get a new, secret link, and avoid getting comments from all over the board. (Or, since nobody ever looks at the second page of the board, the link published in the original thread may not be a big issue anymore.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p><a href="http://heatherdale.com/">Heather Dale</a> is, in my opinion (and as I&#39;ve often said on the Board) one of the best singer-songwriters around. According to her own description:<br><br><i>&quot;Heather finds new insight within old material, and cheerfully fuses the Celtic folk tradition with a healthy mix of world music and rock influences.&quot;</i><br><br>Her lyrics have been a particular inspiration for me - <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/CrashTitle.htm">Crashing Down</a> (and all its chapter titles) is named for one of her songs, and the PPC AU <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/TCDAFairytale.htm">Pistons of the Plot Continuum</a> is explicitly inspired by one of her albums (and features clips of the songs as soundtrack).<br><br>Heather writes-and-sings on a range of topics - from Greek mythology to Robin Hood - but a lot of her songs come back to the legends of King Arthur. She&#39;s now looking to take those songs and turn them into a stage musical: <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/heather-dale-s-celtic-avalon-touring-show-and-dvd">Celtic Avalon</a>.<br><br>I think it looks good - but then, I&#39;ve met the woman, and have every one of her albums. Fortunately (or sneakily, if you prefer), she&#39;s released a <i>free</i> album for download: <a href="http://heatherdale.com/product/perpetual-gift-full-album-download/">Perpetual Gift</a>. Go on, give it a listen - no catches, no hidden strings.<br><br>And if you like it - or if you just think <a href="http://heatherdale.com/home/celtic-avalon-the-show/">what she wants to do</a> with Celtic Avalon sounds as cool as I think it does - then why not consider <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/heather-dale-s-celtic-avalon-touring-show-and-dvd">donating through Indiegogo</a>? She&#39;s halfway there in about half the time, so it looks like Celtic Avalon is on track - but only if people <i>keep</i> donating.<br><br>I have - but like I said, I own all her albums (and you can certainly <a href="http://heatherdale.com/store/">buy those</a> if you like - or, if you donate $75 to Celtic Avalon, you get two of those $10 albums to download as a reward; in other words, if you were inclined to donate $45 for the DVD, <i>and</i> were planning on buying some albums, the $75 donation only costs you an extra $10).<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I realise that was a bit wordy, so here&#39;s the summary:<br><br>Singer-songwriter with Celtic influences wants to make a King Arthur musical. <a href="http://heatherdale.com/product/perpetual-gift-full-album-download/">Check out her music for free</a> and/or <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/heather-dale-s-celtic-avalon-touring-show-and-dvd">donate to Celtic Avalon now</a>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;d heard about this, though! I don&#39;t really have much money to donate but I&#39;ll be checking out what I can, and I&#39;ve been seeing if I can help out at all. Couple years back I actually talked to her event manager about setting up some concerts in the area; it fell through but I might have to see what I can do next time she&#39;s around the Northeast US. It&#39;s awesome to see Celtic Avalon getting a signal boost, all the same; I guess to get to the point I&#39;m seconding your &quot;people should support this&quot;. :P</p>

            <p>Out-of-universe, it&#39;s an homage to/parody of Indiana Jones, but within Equestria, it&#39;s a popular book series in which pith-helmet wearing pegasus and esteemed adventurer Daring Do removes magical artifacts from temples and undoes the sinister plots of assorted legendary creatures, most notably an Ahuizotl from Aztec mythology. The series was introduced in the second season during the show&#39;s &quot;reading is fun!&quot; episode, and Daring Do became a popular character in the fandom, with several fanfics created in which she is brought to the physical world and fights monsters with/is shipped with one of the main characters, usually Rainbow Dash.<br><br>Two seasons later, it was revealed that Daring Do&#39;s adventures are thinly fictionalized accounts of actual events, and Daring Do herself sends the books out under the name A.K. Yearling. It wasn&#39;t made clear whether A.K. Yearling was just a pseudonym, or if it&#39;s her real name and Daring Do is just what she calls herself while adventuring to keep from being tracked back home, but either way, it established the origin and author of the stories. The  reveal episode was pretty predictable and underwhelming, IMO, but it established that the universe of Daring Do and the universe of Equestria are the same, which means that Daring Do badfics would do direct damage to the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic canon.</p>

            <p>Yes, that event is what I&#39;m referring to. Do you want a full history, or just the short version of what happened? Because Derpygate actually gets rather complicated the more you look into it. I&#39;ll tell you the short one for now, but if you want me to break it down, I&#39;d be happy to.<br><br>Basically, as a nod to the fandom, the show allowed fan favorite Derpy Hooves to become canon. She had aperences in the show with her defining wall-eyes, had some minor shenanagins in the background, and played Wheres Waldo with the fandom. Then Over a Barrel happened. Derpy spoke, had dialouge with Rainbow Dash, and had her name canonized. The fandom rejoiced. iTunes then took down the episode a day or so later, and re uploaded it with brand new dialouge, straightening her eyes and removing her name. The fandom EXPLODED. Apparently, Derpy was seen as offensive to mentally disabled people. The fandom disagreed. The fandom did some realy stupid things, making us all look bad. In the end, Derpy remained nameless, the scene is still censored, and everybody involved (brony and Hasbro alike) looked awful.<br><br>If anybody wants, I can give a detailed version of what happened, though be warned, it will be long.</p>

Naturally, we had flames spread across the internet, righteous fury consuming message boards acrossthe web. We complained to show staff, mostly voice actors, as they were the most accessable.

And then.<br><br>The Site.<br><br>The website that shall live on in infamy in the fandom.<br><br>#savederpy was a common hashtag during Derpygate, spreadng outside of twitter as the cry of angry bronies across the interet. The Site desided to take that cry and make that its name. It was a petition, demanding Hasbro to change Derpy back. However, what nobody knew at the was <i>how</i> it told them. Every click on the website sent an email to Hasbro, sign or not. If you did sign, it sent two more. This site shut down Hasbro servers and created a flood that took weeks to clean out. I signed. I had no idea what it was doing, but I signed all the same. I checked the webpage several times for updates. That is what I am ashamed of with Derpygate. Well, that and the vitriol spread across the internet, but that was probably the worst. </p>

            <p>The identity of the author of Daring Do was unknown for a good two years, not even a hint coming out as to the identity of the writer. So, I made an OC that was my version of the author. He wrote Daring Do as more-or-less Discworld for adventure rather then fantasy. Over time, what started as a silly parodist adventure book turned into a long seres where he explored topics and questions relevant to Equestria through a pegasus adventurer who lives for excitement, and takes things in much more stride then she probably should. <br><br>Printworthy filled a gap in the canon, and allowed me to explore an author&#39;s reactions to badfic. Yes, there was a fanfic involving Printworthy as the main character. No, I will not show it to the world. It&#39;s was never finished anyway, and what was done was not that good either. Basically, Printworthy visits Ponyville, Rainbow Dash shows him her fanfic, it sucks, he helps her re-write it. They grow closer and shipping is teased (though it would never amount to anything) and Printworthy get a new appreciation for fans. It was fun to think about, but not much more. Then, I dropped him into the PPC with this fic in mind, and proceeded from there.<br><br>Then, season four and the comics happened. While the comics was an insinuation, and I could ignore them for the sake of my character, I could not just ignore the show. Printworthy became uncanon in one fell swoop, and while I like the episode, it created some problems for the character. However, hS seems to have found a solution...</p>

            <p>There is a difference between being non-canon and being decidedly uncanon. He could have filled a hole in the Canon, not officially recognised, but there, being acceptably original and non-canon. Now, he directly contradicts it. He is uncanon. Normally, this would not be much of a problem, and would only have a minor retcon and some identity issues. However, I had a plan for a mission where Marvin and Printworthy enter a Daring Do badfic (probably created for the mission) and Printworthy has some interesting reactions. <br><br>Naturally, Printworthy gets angry at his world being corrupted, but he also starts having these strange bursts of powerful magic. This is particularly strange, as he is a rather weak spellcaster, yet now he can open passageways that did not exist before, and cause changes in the weather. As it gets closer to the climax, Printworthy has more bursts, and begins to hear voices in his head. Eventually, he would command the fic to stop, rise into the air with a white glow in his eyes, and begin speaking in the voice of The Author. The Author is the creator of Daring Do, yet who has no Canon form. Printworthy acts as the Author Avatar, and begins to remove the effects of the badfic as he charges. At last, when The Author is satisfied, it leaves, dropping Printworthy to the ground. The mission ends as his vision fades, and he falls into darkness.<br><br>...He&#39;d be fine. Just got magical overload from being an Avatar for a god. However, now that there not only is a Daring Do author, but the adventures actually happened in real (Equestrian) life, it makes that idea impossible. Perhaps I can still do something similar, but as far as I see it now, that idea has to be scrapped. Oh well.</p>

            <p>Around two years or so ago, two of my friends and I adopted badfic personas and started writing crossover trollfics for the purposes of dramatic reading and topping one another&#39;s poor writing decisions, in a fun competition sense. I never actually published any of them anywhere, but I still have the text document for a Daring Do/Pokйmon/Kirby trollfic on my computer, and I could send it to you if you&#39;d like. It&#39;d save you the trouble of writing a new story to send Printworthy into for his trans-authorial encounter, and your reactions could be more genuine. Well, sort of more genuine. Most people don&#39;t admit that a fic was purposefully bad until they become Internet famous. Don&#39;t worry; Printworthy would have plenty to rage about. I ship Daring Do with Meta Knight at the end, for instance.</p>

            <p>Bear in mind, Printworthy still <i>is</i> the author - to himself, if to no-one else. That&#39;s not just a belief of his - when he came into existence, it was as the author. I don&#39;t know of precedent for &#39;this was once true; now it is false&#39;, but it seems like an interesting notion. (By contrast, since Doctor Who was revived, Morgan has started remembering various things about Gallifrey. But she&#39;s never had a confirmed fact about herself that was abruptly made untrue)<br><br>I don&#39;t think the fact that &#39;the adventures actually happened in real (Equestrian) life&#39; is particularly relevant; actual events get written down and fictionalised all the time, without us claiming that the written version is anything other than a standard canon. Obviously I don&#39;t know the details, but the usual event&gt;author&gt;fiction dynamic could well still hold.<br><br>And this might actually make it <i>more</i> interesting. If there is now a character who is The Author of Daring Do, and Printworthy walks in as The Author - well, it seems distinctly possible that the &#39;verse would indeed try and conflate the two. This isn&#39;t a &#39;so-and-so believes this&#39;; Printworthy <i>actually is</i> the author. Only the other author is <i>canonically</i> The Author.<br><br>If I were doing it, I&#39;d probably have a semi-possession - have Printworthy take on attributes of the actual author, and also - given that he&#39;s in the &#39;verse written by said Author - the aforementioned godlike powers. You&#39;d have to change some things, certainly, but the basic idea holds.<br><br>Also: I wonder if the DoDAEG is related to this line of thinking? We power our anti-badfic efforts by the spinning of dead authors in their graves - and there may be dramatic effects by taking <i>living</i> authors into their own works - that sounds like scheming, to me.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That... That could work... Of course, I have to deal with A.K. Yearling (the pseudonym for Daring Do) being both author and main character, and the consequences thereof. The personalities of Printworthy and A.K. would clash, but it would give me an opportunity to do a Rincewind type dialouge between A.K. and Printworthy. Oh, but the comics insinuates that the author is Twilight Sparkle&#39;s mother. So that&#39;s some psudo-canon as well. Hmmm... Perhaps The Author could yet exist...<br><br>Well hS, you&#39;ve given me some ideas. Interesting, as it was Morgan&#39;s change in history that made me decide that Printworthy could not be the author anymore. Still, I suppose there is a bit of a difference between changing memories and changing who you are. So, I suppose he is the author, just from an AU, or something. I&#39;ll have to think more on this, but that mission may yet happen.<br><br>You know, I always thought DoDAEG was a little silly. I know this is the PPC, it&#39;s supposed to be silly, but really? Dead authors spinning in their graves to generate power? It&#39;s funny at first, but when you realize how inefficient it must be compared to other means of generating electricity, it becomes just silly. Besides, why would authors spin in their graves anyway? How would that help anything? However, if it has something to do with Authorial magic... <br><br>Perhaps the bodies of the dead authors spin because the body is trying to wring out enough Authorial Magic to maintain order in the continuum. Now, perhaps they only release a little of that magic, and normally that energy just seeps into the earth and does not actually help. However, if the PPC learned how to harness not only the kinetic energy of the spinning bodies, but this Authorial Magic for use in fighting badfic, now DoDAEG has a greater purpose. That would explain how plotholes could stabilize into portals, or how Agents can just kill Sues and Stus who&#39;s main ability is to warp reality around them. Perhaps Authorial Magic gives an edge to Agents so that they actually stand a good chance against the things. And now, Printworthy shows the ability to generate this energy directly, and in great quantities... Ooh, ideas are forming! <br><br>Feel free to use this idea for DoDAEG and Authorial Magic if you want, whomever is reading this. Feel free to make a more clever name for the magic too, if you want. But unless somebody directly contradicts this idea, I&#39;m thinking this is the real purpose behind DoDAGE&#39;s existence.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been sort of influenced by the Sweetie Belle Chronicles and Pony POV interpretation of fanfiction in-universe(which may have affected the way I view the PPC as a whole, too. It&#39;s certainly helped me quantify it.) as a series of alternate possibilities for the way a world could operate, each existing as its own separate entity, but all under the sway of the Heart World, or the actual canon, in that changes in the Heart World can create changes in the deviations from it. No one would have included Breezies in fanfiction back in Season Three, but now that they&#39;ve been introduced, they&#39;re going to start popping up in a number of places, but not necessarily in all places. However, that does not automatically invalidate the fanfictions written before the introduction of the species or the fanfictions that decide not to include them, just like Twilight getting wings at the end of Season Three doesn&#39;t invalidate any future scenarios that show Twilight without wings at some point late in her life.<br>Therefore, everything not canon is, by default, AU to some extent, and the stories that are labelled AU are the farthest-flung from the Heart World while keeping to its... I suppose the best word would be orbit. To get back to the point, I think that Printworthy interacting with his role as it would have been as opposed to what it is now would be a great idea for character development. He is from a world where he is the author of Daring Do, and both has to come to terms with the fact that the advancement of the Heart World has blocked him off from one of the certainties of his past, and to terms with what he is now as a PPC Agent and a divergence from canon that still seeks to defend it. Also, the idea of canon trying to reassert itself around Printworthy as the &quot;author&quot; and placing him in direct conflict with/partial fusion with A.K. Yearling could provide plenty of fodder for comedy, and could give you a third voice to comment on the badfic with if you want to.<br><br>Actually, the authors spinning in their graves is a humorous extension of a popular idiom. When someone does or says something that completely goes against a famous figure&#39;s work and accomplishments in life, people may say that the person is &quot;spinning in his/her grave&quot;, suggesting that even the dead body of the figures would be so affronted by the transgressions that they spasm in their coffins out of sheer rage. The sheer number of terrible fanfictions in the multiverse would, therefore, mean that the author would be ragefully shifting and convulsing around more or less constantly.<br>DoDAEG discreetly exhumes the corpses of particularly maligned authors and replaces them with body doubles, then wraps the body in a special material that regulates their spinning and allows the body a full range of motion, and then straps those bodies into several large machines, which act as generators by collecting the energy of that constant motion. There&#39;s no magic involved. Just defilement of graves and some extremely dubious science. Then again, this is a setting that stabilizes plot holes and uses them as a mode of transport, so science isn&#39;t really the top priority.<br>I doubt that the author generators are the <i>only</i> source of power in DoDAEG, especially since the Power Cut that the Black Cats created back in 2006 showed everyone how vulnerable they were, but they&#39;re still the most well-known and prominent ones, since they&#39;re part of the name of the Department after all.</p>

            <p>But the presence of a magical energy that seeps from the bodies of dead authors is just as implausible as the &quot;spinning in their graves&quot; power supply, if not more so. The thing is, most of what the PPC does doesn&#39;t make much literal sense. Even from a standard perspective of fiction, we can get away with a lot more than we otherwise might be able to by, paradoxically, using our knowledge of good writing to apply aspects of bad writing to our advantage. People can have unexplained powers because of an oddly-placed typo. Concentrated plot contrivances written down really quickly by plants provided the fuel for the first portal-creating devices. But it&#39;s none of it taken too seriously, because as a great man once said, what&#39;s the fun in making sense?</p>

            <p>I was in a rush and just typed the first thing that came to mind. I had a minute to say something, and rather then be smart and wait to say what I meant. What I meant to say was, yes, I get the joke. Yes, the PPC makes no sence. Yes, we are in a community that loves puns. So do I. However, I like the idea that there is a second, more useful use for the authors rather then generating electricity based on the kenetic rotations of their dead bodies. My question is, why do they roll? Because they are mad or insulted. Right, so what does sombody do when mad about somthing? Try and fix it. How do they fix it? By repairing the world with the energies they used to make it. So, their bodies relese that energy,  in an attemt to fix it. Does that not make some strange sence? Certainly make more sence then using the bodies for a morbid way to get electricy when there are much better systems in the multiverse. That is what I meant by &#39;in the literal sense.&#39; I will admit that I phrased it in the absolute worst possible way, but that&#39;s the way it is.</p>

            <p>For the second, the amount of time the treatments wood take and the effectiveness they have would depend on the individual Sue. Their original level of power and personality would have a lot to do with how well and how quickly they rehabilitate, and some just don&#39;t do as well working in the new setting as others. Some might not like having to be part of a team instead of taking the glory for themselves, some might be too tempted to use their powers during a mission, which would formerly have attracted the attention of the DIS or DIO but in the modern setting would still be dangerous and addictive, etcetera etcetera.<br>To give a few examples of reformed Sues from PPC history, Priyala was more or less just a human with unexplained telepathic powers in her home fic, so she contains her Sueishness easily, which is aided by the fact that she feels resentful for the damages that she did to her home canon in her original badfic and doesn&#39;t want to repeat those problems in her new environment. Meneltari, on the other hand, had both a larger amount of base power as the uncanonical and immortal daughter of Eru Ilъvatar himself, and had a much less mindful attitude toward keeping herself in check. Her last confirmed actions in the PPC involved accidentally causing most of HQ to lust after her and getting thrown into the Void as a consequence.<br><br>You&#39;ll want to aim somewhere between those, closer to the Priyala side than not, but the situation is very dependent on the character&#39;s personal disposition and background. Do you have any details decided on yet?<br><br>To help with Suvian recovery, there&#39;s a Sue Support Group that&#39;s intended to keep Sues from misusing their powers, as well as providing them with therapy and moral support. There&#39;s also a medication called Logicillin that, while initially created to ward off Suvian encroachment on Agents from infections like Suemonia and Vambiolaria, also helps Agents who started out as Sues keep their Suvian tendencies in check. I&#39;m pretty sure the former would be made mandatory by Personnel for at least a short amount of time, and the latter probably wouldn&#39;t hurt, especially during the period during which the ex-Sue recruit is still adjusting.<br><br>Also, a question tangential to your name change: do you know about Bionicle? There was a species from there called the Skakdi, and Iximaz is a very Skakdi-esque name. It&#39;s got the hard consonants and long &quot;a&quot;s that they like. I&#39;m not saying it sounds bad, before you take this the wrong way, it&#39;s just that the new name reminded me of them and it would be nice to see a fellow Bionicle fan here.</p>

            <p>For some odd reason, I never was interested in Bionicle... probably because for the majority of my childhood, it was Harry Potter, Power Rangers, Pokemon, and Digimon. (That and the Bionicle creatures kind of scared me. ^_^&#39;) I might have to look into that, though.<br><br>And thanks for the information; Nyx, the &#39;Sue we have targeted, actually wasn&#39;t too bad and only barely tips the &#39;Sue level (she learned how to gallop on a horse within a few minutes despite never having seen a horse in her life before, was the only literate member of her barbarian tribe (in multiple languages, too!), was a better archer than Link, got Link to spend a quarter of his wallet on an OUTFIT, and has the whole shadow beast thing going for her. Oh, and her eyes are yellow.<br><br>I know that all seems like a lot, but if the author was a bit more careful with how she handled the story, it could have been really good. I wasn&#39;t too sure why Randa sent me the story until I read to the shopping spree. Then I got mad. But with a little bit of tweaking, I think Nyx-maybe-to-be-renamed-something-else would make a good agent. She&#39;s already got Sue archery under her belt, but that could be plausible since she belonged to a barbarian tribe, and of course some natural talent. The shadow beast form could make for some interesting missions if she can&#39;t control it, either.</p>

            <p>Seriously, that&#39;s like the fourth or fifth one I know of! What is it about that name? Because, in greek mythology, that&#39;s the name for the personification of darkness and night. I suppose that works for, say, Nightmare Moon reborn, but not so much for an emo teenager with black hair and cuts herself. At least this Nyx has some weird shadow beast thing in her, so that <i>might</i> be excusable for the name, but I&#39;m sorry, unless she has darkness powers, the name&#39;s silly.<br><br>Ooh, a lycanthrope, nice! I played with a lycanthropic agent for a little while. May find some use for her in some story later, though probably not PPC or fanfic related. While I&#39;m not a fan of how most lycanthropes in the PPC are handled, should the uncontrollable beast nature of her actually be explored, it could be very interesting. I would say funny, but being forcibly transformed into a ravenous shadow beast is not funny, it&#39;s terrifying. That&#39;s not to say that terrifying is bad. It&#39;s not, and indeed, should be used more in the PPC. However, as long as it develops character, and funny moments can come out of it, then it&#39;s all for the better.</p>

            <p>I think they use Nyx so much for those exact reasons you said. What better way to show the readers the Sue is a Speshul Snowflake than to give her a name that means the personification of night itself?<br><br>As for the whole shadow beast thing, I don&#39;t think she&#39;d have problems actually controlling the wolf form (Link didn&#39;t in Twilight Princess- it was just a big shock when he woke up and was a wolf.); she&#39;d just have trouble not fursploding. If that&#39;s even applicable to her situation. Which I am not sure of. I don&#39;t think Link fursploded. ...I really ought to try finishing Twilight Princess; I haven&#39;t played it since I was about twelve... almost five years should hopefully make a difference. But anyway, she&#39;s not an actual lycanthrope, so the shape changing isn&#39;t... uh, lycanthropic. <br><br>And about Link spending a quarter of his wallet on an outfit: it wasn&#39;t anything special. It was just fancy. &gt;_<br>Anyone have any name suggestions? I&#39;m thinking about Brooke, but if anyone can think of something more suitable to a Hylian mountain barbarian tribe, it would be much appreciated. ;)</p>

Link turned into a wolf as a way for the Triforce of Courage to rationalize the mutagenic energies of the Twilight Veil. The shadow beasts are directly transformed into monsters by Zant&#39;s corruptive magic or transformed from people&#39;s spirits by other shadow beasts. The process is different, and Link&#39;s circumstances are more or less unique, since there are only three Triforce pieces and the Triforces of Power and Wisdom appeared to offer full immunity to the Twilight Veil&#39;s mutagen.</p>

            <p>Well, the fic specifically said &#39;shadow beast&#39;, but she turns into a wolf like Link because she&#39;s Speshul. Sorry about the confusion; I haven&#39;t played Twilight Princess since I was twelve or so, and I never finished it in the first place. (Also, she&#39;s half Twili or some crap like that, if you wanted to know. I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t, but meh.) Randa just sent me the fic; we haven&#39;t discussed it much.

            <p>I tried to find the original fic you were talking about after putting up that post, to get a better view of what the transformation entailed, and I have found four Twilight Princess-era Nyx-Sues so far without barely trying. One of them is queen of the Zoras despite being a shadow monster from another dimension, and another is half-Twili and banished from her home realm due to some gobbledegook involving invisible tattoos. I&#39;m not going to search any longer. This is only going to hurt.</p>

            <p>Namely, her annoyingly tragic &quot;the last survivor of my people&quot; cliche, the fact that she is a crossbreed between two species that have never been even implied to be interfertile, the aforementioned invisible tattoos, or the fact that she is changed into a shadow beast but keeps an intact mind due to her &quot;mixed blood&quot;.<br>In fact, the very possibility of a Twili and a Hylian(I can&#39;t find anything saying what her other half is, only that it was a female native of the world of light, but I&#39;m going to assume it&#39;s Hylian because being part surface human isn&#39;t speshul enough and none of the other races more than faintly resemble Link. I guess she could be part Gerudo, but she&#39;d probably have angsted about that because Ganondorf is a Gerudo and Sues tend to believe that morality is bloodborne) meeting for long enough to bear a child is preposterous enough, from a canonical standpoint. The Twilight Realm was intended as a prison plane from which no one would be able to escape without being released from the outside, ipso facto, no random Twili would be able to just wander into a Hylian village and mate with people. Zant was only able to get out by using a mix of Twilight Realm magic and the Triforce of Power energies that Ganondorf gave him, which was a combination that the Light Spirits who imprisoned the Twili most likely wouldn&#39;t have anticipated. Nyx&#39;s briefly touched-upon backstory implies that her father just left somehow, sired her, went into exile on Snowpeak, and was killed by the barbarians that later raise his daughter because he &quot;didn&#39;t belong here&quot;. That raises <i>so</i> many questions, not only on the hows and whys of the escape, but why the barbarians didn&#39;t kill Nyx as an abomination, or why she doesn&#39;t feel anything about the fact that her biological father was killed by her surrogate family for being a foreigner.<br><br>That&#39;s a very implausible backstory, to sum up, and I made my judgement too quickly because I didn&#39;t know about it. If it were me, I&#39;d say that she seems to have done too much damage to canon to be recruited, in combination of the little distortions and the larger matter of the way she arranged the circumstances of her history.<br>Since it&#39;s not me, I would recommend two things: one, play Twilight Princess all the way through before sporking this, or at least the rest of the way through from where you left off. It&#39;s not good to go into a mission for the Protectors of the Plot Continuum with only partial knowledge of the plot that&#39;s being protected. Two: if you do decide to recruit her despite everything, the Flowers are going to be very angry with you. Recruiting the central Sue of a mission has only happened twice, as far as I know(a few Agents were recruited as Sues offscreen, but even then it only raises the number to about six or so), and both times the Sue wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as the story around her. In this case, the Sue is everything bad about the story, since without her, it would just be a fanfic that stays near canon in just about every fashion, with the only significant deviation being that Link can talk. You <i>will</i> need to address this. On the plus side, this means that her planned eventual assignment to your RC could be the Flowers deciding that even though she went through Agent training without maiming or Sueifying anyone, she still needed to be supervised, and the best people to do so were those who thought recruiting her would be a good idea. On the minus side, your Agents are going to be getting horrible, horrible missions into perpetuity as punishment for their transgressions(probably out of the Circle), not to mention that they would never be in what passes for the Flowers&#39; good graces again if they recruit that level of Sue on their first mission together before proving that they know what they&#39;re doing. At the very least, it would take a while and they&#39;d need to prove themselves competent to their superiors.<br>She might also need to settle into one of her two ancestral species, both as a way of rejecting her Suvian heritage and because, again, those species were never meant to mix, but I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d go about accomplishing that.<br><br>By the way, if it says that she&#39;s a &quot;shadow beast&quot; in-story, she&#39;s going to look like a shadow beast, especially since she doesn&#39;t seem to have full description of herself in beast mode, just that the form&#39;s furry and about the size of Wolf Link. That&#39;s the way the Word World works. It takes the Words that comprise it very literally.</p>

            <p>Well, we already have <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Nyx_Nightingale"> a relatively prominent Nyx</a>, but that Nyx could be given a last name and fit in fine afterward as long as said surname wasn&#39;t &quot;Nightingale&quot;, in case you end up deciding not to rename her entirely.<br><br>Keep in mind that there is plenty of canonical precedent for Link spending lots of money on clothes. The resistant tunics in Ocarina of Time cost 200 Rupees each, which is a full Adult&#39;s Wallet, and the Magic Armor in Twilight Princess cost... let me check the wiki for the exact number... 598. Still, those have magical superpowers that protect Link from harm, so it makes sense why they&#39;d cost so much. It would be bad if the clothes that cost so much money both did nothing and made Link look like a moron, though.<br><br>You&#39;re right; when it&#39;s considered from an in-universe context, those traits aren&#39;t all that Suvian aside from the ones that make her a multilingual werebeast, since Link has shown that horse riding and archery can be learned within an incredibly short time span in the Zelda universe. There are theories that Link is capable of expertly using any weapon or tool he touches thanks to the latent power of the Triforce of Courage, but that wouldn&#39;t apply to games where he doesn&#39;t get the Triforce of Courage until most of the way through, and even if it was the case, it still doesn&#39;t explain his insta-equestrian skills. At least Twilight Princess explained those by saying he was a rancher before becoming a hero. Back on topic, I agree with you that she&#39;s salvageable, especially if the werebeast transformations become a problem that she has to deal with instead of the minor and little-thought-of annoyance that similar transformations have been treated as in spin-offs past.<br><br>At least we have Pokйmon and Digimon in common for our childhood fandoms. I&#39;m personally as guilty for never really getting into Power Rangers, but I distinctly remember watching some of Wild Force and owning a couple of Dino Thunder toys, so it wasn&#39;t a total disconnect. I&#39;ve been getting some remedial Power Ranger-ology from Linkara&#39;s History of Power Rangers videos, to try and catch up on the pop culture phenomenon.<br>Hey, have you tried that Digimon game where you go onto the <a href="http://wikimon.net/Main_Page">online Digimon catalogue</a>, hit the Random page option, then whatever Digimon that comes up is treated as one set stage of your Digimon partner and you look through its list of pre-evolutions and Digivolved forms to find the best/your favorite ones to build your entire Digivolution chain from Baby to Mega? Or, Fresh 1 to Ultimate, as the catalogue calls them, because apparently it only uses the original Japanese terms for everything. It&#39;s quite engrossing, or at least it was for me. I got BigMamemon, and there are a surprising number of branching paths that can lead up to an Ultimate(well, &quot;Perfect&quot; in the catalogue&#39;s terms).</p>

            <p>Baby 1 was the catalogue&#39;s name for the first stage of a Digimon, and Fresh is the official English name. Bluh. I could maybe understand if the two terms had entirely switched places in my sentence, but that was just sloppy. Go to your room, Past Me.</p>

            <p>Hey, folks.  I don&#39;t start new topics very often, so . . . um.<br><br>I am here to discuss <i>Pokйmon</i> minis!  I&#39;ve been chugging away at making pages for minis, but I wanted to get the community&#39;s thoughts before I made the one for the Pokйminis.  We&#39;ve wound up with three different types.  The older <i>Pokйmon</i> OFU (the OFU of Kanto) had mini-Deoxys.  A newer OFU, the Pokйmon Fanfiction University, has mini-Missingno.  I can&#39;t find it now, but I seem to recall the Warrior of Many Faces asked permission on the Board to start the new one and change the mini, so that&#39;s pretty much a retcon.  The troublesome bit is that between the active periods of the two OFUs, Sylibane published a <i>Pokйmon</i> mission.  Probably unaware of the by-then-super-old, and also deleted-from-the-Pit-and-rehosted-elsewhere, OFU of Kanto, s/he made a new mini type, the mini-Rayquaza.<br><br>So what I&#39;m asking is, do we want to call mini-Rayquazas a mistake, and stick with Many Faces&#39; mini-Missingnos as the legit mini for <i>Pokйmon</i>?  Or stick with the Wiki&#39;s explanation that minis have one form on missions and others in the OFUs?  (A bizarre third option would be to assign each mini type to one aspect of the canon--games, anime, and manga.  The drawback here is that both Sylibane&#39;s mission &quot;Luke&quot; and Many Faces&#39; OFU are pretty clearly both in the game universe, while the manga remains unrepresented throughout the PPC/OFU multiverse.)<br><br>(Sylibane, if you&#39;re still around, I&#39;m not trying to call you out or anything.  Just trying to keep the bookkeeping under control.  (: )<br><br>The other thing I wanted to mention was an interesting and practical find I discovered while looking for older spin-offs.  On this outdated copy of the Complete List of PPC Fiction:<br><a href="http://archive.is/DLiat"><a href="http://archive.is/DLiat">http://archive.is/DLiat</a></a><br><br>I found the old site of Chana&#39;s &quot;Hal and Chana&quot; spin-off, wherein lay a super-old email directory of PPC oldbies:<br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090724140452/http://geocities.com/PPCdirectory/"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090724140452/http://geocities.com/PPCdirectory/">http://web.archive.org/web/20090724140452/http://geocities.com/PPCdirectory/</a></a><br><br>There is a <i>wealth</i> of info on here.  It&#39;s got links to old writing, both PPC and not; I haven&#39;t had a chance to get through them all yet, but hopefully there are at least some archived links in there.  It might also help connect some agents to their proper owners, as it contains alternate names for a lot of Boarders.  The most immediately helpful section for me is the mini adoptions, as they allowed me to fill out the Mini-Balrog page most dramatically.  It also has a few mini-types that had been lost for a while--<i>Sailor Moon</i> makes mini-youmas!  Who knew?<br><br>That&#39;s a major reason I&#39;m sharing the link--I wanted a bit of self-accountability, so people didn&#39;t think I had just made up arbitrary misspellings and mini types.  But I also just wanted to show off what I found, as it&#39;s a pretty dang cool artifact of our history.<br><br>(Side note, though: that list has people&#39;s emails in it, but let&#39;s NOT go bothering people out of the blue about a community they left a decade ago, okay?  It would be Impolite.  And most of them are probably defunct, anyway.)</p>

            <p>The Mini Adoption Center has been mentioned in missions before, but it is kind of a place that you dump off minis that no one on the Board wants and that don&#39;t have their own OFU&#39;s of Adoption Centers to go to. <br><br>It may be a sort of generic type place that only exists in a few missions.<br><br>If I can find the name, I&#39;ll post it.</p>

<li>A real world location that also exists in the fictional universe you&#39;re dealing with would indeed make a mini.  So &quot;Gurmany&quot; in an IJ badfic would make--whatever you&#39;re going to make the mini be, since they don&#39;t exist yet.  I reckon the same would be true for real world figures who appear as characters in the fiction, like Hitlur.  (Did I just Godwin&#39;s Law a mini question?)<br><br>I guess the same would be true for real world locations that didn&#39;t originally appear in the canon?  Like, Jones never went to Hawaii (that I know of, haven&#39;t seen all the <i>Young Indiana Jones</i> movies), but there&#39;s no reason to assume Hawaii magically doesn&#39;t exist in the IJ-verse.  (If it doesn&#39;t, I blame either aliens or some ancient magic.  Or magical ancient aliens.)<br><br>But again, I&#39;m not sure on that point.  Anyone else want to chime in?<br><br>2. HQ has <i>several</i> mini adoption agencies.  Most of them are for individual varieties of mini, like Miah and Cali&#39;s mini-LEO AA, Skeet and Amelia&#39;s mini-Mogget AA, and the mini-razor adoptions run through the Creepy Bloodstained Victorians Protection Society.  These are basically instances where someone wrote a mission to a smallish fandom, found minis there, and realized there was no OFU author to manage mini distribution.  They then took it upon themselves to handle mini adoptions.<br><br>I&#39;m sure there is also a capitalized Mini Adoption Agency, although it&#39;s typically described somewhat vaguely (that I&#39;ve read).  This was for instances where the mission author, upon finding said minis, did <i>not</i> want to manage adoptions, and wrote a generic place to drop them off at, which other people started to use when they wanted to adopt minis with no caretaker.  Since it&#39;s been kind of haphazardly used, it probably never got a wiki page created.  That&#39;s something you could work on, if you feel like it!<br><br>(There&#39;s also Mini Care, a daycare-style service to keep minis safe and out of trouble while their adopted agents are on missions.  As far as I know, it only appeared in Tawaki&#39;s spin-off.  That could warrant a wiki page, as well.)</li>

            <p>1) While the specific location in Venice that got mangled isn&#39;t mentioned in canon that I&#39;m aware of (I should probably check with the IJ wiki), Venice itself exists in canon.  I would think that should be close enough for mini-creation.<br><br>And for the record, &quot;Snakes.  Why did it have to be snakes?&quot; :D<br><br>2) If the overtime drops off, I&#39;ll see if I can pull together a page for the various adoption agencies.  Tawaki, if you&#39;re reading this, mind if Mini Care becomes a branch of the main Mini Adoption Agency?  Something like the &quot;doggy day care&quot; that my local humane society runs?<br><br>The first draft has an unnamed assistant helping collect the minis because the MAA supervisors are out of the office.  (I was writing it offline and couldn&#39;t check the wiki.)  I may leave that alone for now, and expand it when the wiki page is written.</p>

            <p>I am relatively certain that any misspellings of real-world countries or cities will create <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini/Axis_Powers_Hetalia">mini-Mochi</a>. Maybe if the location is specific enough and important enough to the plot, like Indepnednce Hall in a National Treasure badfic, for example, it would create that continuum&#39;s mini, but in most real-world location situations, they&#39;re Mochi. It&#39;s more streamlined that way, too.</p>

            <p>It would be kind of weird if misspellings of settings like <i>Heroes</i> or <i>Jane Eyre</i> or whatever made an anime-style mini.  (Also, they&#39;re <i>Hetalia</i> characters, so it doesn&#39;t make sense for them to represent &quot;real&quot; Earth.)<br><br>I&#39;m a strong advocate of one mini per continuum, personally.  If we start making all these individual guidelines for specific situations, any given mission could potentially turn into too much bookkeeping, which would make the writing experience less fun.  (While I like it when PPCers use minis as characters in a mission, too many minis drawing description time away from the action would probably be bad for narrative flow.)</p>

            <p>The way I hear it, <i>Hetalia</i> kinda gets away from reality, like, a lot, so their minis wouldn&#39;t be remotely appropriate for Real World places. I can&#39;t back that up, though, because I couldn&#39;t sit through more than a handful of episodes. &gt;.<br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>1) The <i>Indiana Jones</i> continuum has a lot of overlap with the Real World, so in this case I&#39;d say yes, you&#39;d get an <i>Indiana Jones</i> mini out of it.<br><br>2) Maybe? There are definitely several specific mini adoption centers run from response centers in HQ, and there have been occasional references to a generic one, but it&#39;s ambiguous.

            <p>I had most of this post written before, and then the Internet locked up and I couldn&#39;t make another one for hours because of classes. Bah. Now it&#39;s shorter. Then again, knowing me, it may have been better for whoever is reading this, since they do not need to confront one of my legendary walls of text.<br><br>Okay, to the point. Mini-Rayquazas are the most well-known incarnation of the Pokйmon mini that we have. According to the Board search bar, the only mentions of mini-Missingnos or mini-Deoxys within recorded Board history were as alternatives to the mini-Rayquaza, which has been treated as the default Pokйmon mini by several badfic analyses and miscellaneous statements. Plus, the mini-Rayquaza has been mentioned in other published missions before(I know there are more times people have talked about them, but Google is acting up today and would only give me <a href="http://miah-arthur.livejournal.com/17149.html">this one</a>, while the mini-Deoxys and mini-Missingno have not been seen outside of their native OFU. Neither of the others has that kind of ground. Removing the mini-Rayquazas entirely at this point or retconning them as being the guise of some other shapeshifting mini species would produce more problems than it solves. I say we keep mini-Rayquaza as the form of the Pokйmon mini when it appears in a badfic, and have the OFU minis categorized as altered versions.<br><br>Tied into that, the wiki&#39;s explanation is based in part on something that was decided on a while ago to provide an in-universe explanation for OFAS&#39;s mini change, and was later applied to several other continua with multiple mini species. Certain minis might be unsuitable for OFU protection, and if a force exists in the continuum capable of altering the forms of living beings, such as Q in Star Trek or Arceus in Pokйmon, they could be adapted to a form better suited for their new job. True, mini-Rayquazas would still do a better job guarding the canon characters than mini-Tribbles would, so a change isn&#39;t as necessary from an in-universe standpoint, but the ability to fly at incredible speed and shoot tiny little energy bolts from one&#39;s mini-mouth pales in comparison to the glitch powers that the mini-Missigno could have, especially when working in tandem. They might be able to transport people across vast distances and appear in any location with a hiss of static, to guard the staff section from the attacks of fangirls, their wide move pool would make them more unpredictable, etcetera etcetera. The Pokйmon OFUs were shown to have the blessings of the Sinnoh legendaries, since the Warrior OFU mentioned that Dialga would be responsible for keeping up temporal consistency, so it&#39;s not out of the question that Arceus would be up to transforming the minis into a form that the Coordinator thinks would be best for the job at hand. Arceus is capable of creating and reshaping all Pokйmon life, after all.</p>

            <p>They got added to the wiki&#39;s mini list waaaaaay back on August 8, 2008, by an anonymous IP address.  For context, the mission &quot;Luke&quot; wasn&#39;t published until July 30, 2011.  The mission you linked, where mini-Rayquazas are mentioned in passing was published a few months later, on September 23.<br><br>SOURCES<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini?oldid=7856"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini?oldid=7856">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini?oldid=7856</a></a><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=214547;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=214547;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=214547;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board</a></a><br><br>I don&#39;t think this was a regular, unsigned-in PPCer (their only other contributions were to expand the &quot;Robecca&quot; page) and adding it after a Board discussion, as the first mention of this mini on the Board is by me (hurr duur durp) on February 19, 2010.  (Although it is possible that much of the Board&#39;s past discussions have vanished off the internet, but I don&#39;t want to think about that.)  <br><br>SOURCES<br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=193238;search_term=rayquaza"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=193238;search_term=rayquaza">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=193238;search_term=rayquaza</a></a><br><br>So basically, it got thrown up on the wiki by an unknown someone (who was obviously unaware of the mini-Deoxys at the OFU of Kanto), and no one questioned it until now (well, until the Warrior of Many Faces changed it for his OFU).<br><br>This makes me even more inclined to support Many Faces&#39; mini-Missingo as the Pokйmini.  Especially since minis originally came from the OFU multiverse, anyway, and OFUs have traditionally trumped the PPC on the topic of minis.</p>

            <p>Even if it didn&#39;t have a primary source before, it definitely has some now, and those stories featuring mini-Rayquaza are currently the only sources describing what Pokйmon minis appear as during a mission. Even if the original mention was inspired by the Minis page on the wiki, and there&#39;s no real way to confirm or deny that at this point, that doesn&#39;t make the choice invalid. It&#39;s not terribly different from choosing a mini type based on another Boarder&#39;s suggestion.<br><br>I think that the unregistered user only making one edit aside from the one on the Minis page may support the idea that the original editor was a non-signed-in Boarder as much as it debunks it. It&#39;s entirely possible that the unlogged edits there predate the person in question&#39;s creation of a Board presence, or that the person just hadn&#39;t logged in when those edits were made. Speaking as someone who originally made unlogged edits before I started using my main account and tracked several unregistered users back when I more frequently edited the wiki, an unregistered user would normally only make one or two small edits, suggesting a similar issue of not logging in or a random Internet user correcting a typo that was bugging them, or they would make several in a string and then vanish, which occurred for any number of reasons.</p>

            <p>What are we going to do about the No Links pages on the wiki? Some of them are Agents by Boarders who are still around and might conceivably put their inactive Agents in stories, some just have never been sourced properly(I&#39;m working on a couple of those now, actually), and some are free-to-use characters such as Flowers, but some are pages for Agents or other miscellaneous characters that never appeared in a published work and are unlikely to in the future, since the person writing them vanished from the PPC years ago, abandoning the characters in the process. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Kippers_Axolotl">This one</a>, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Suichi_Sanders">this one</a>, and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Eesa_Greenley">this one</a>, for example. Do we just delete the pages? Is there a protocol for this sort of thing? It&#39;s wiki policy that you don&#39;t put anything up unless there are sources for it, but not only have those pages not shown any links for several years, the characters in the latter category are unlikely to ever appear anywhere, or to have made any past appearances prior to their abandonment.<br>And what about <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Reiar">these</a> <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Matsu">two</a>? The pages were made for Agents that the author didn&#39;t yet have Permission to create, and then the original page creator vanished before Permission was attained. Can we delete those by now?<br><br>Also: should the Peyote get its own page? It&#39;s mentioned on the wiki, in connection to its role as one of the Flower staff members in the Janitorial Department(it appears to have been created by Trojanhorse, judging by one of the links below that page), but it&#39;s also shown up in at least two more stories, those two being <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/phobos/ctbag.html">Phobos&#39;s bad future AU</a> and the <a href="http://stranglerfig.webs.com/mission2.htm">original ESAS spin-off</a>. Three appearances give it officially more screen time than some formally recognized Department Heads, notably the Head of its own Department, and most of the Division Heads.</p>

            <p>All right, then. I&#39;ll get on that as soon as I have some free time and can find a good picture. Google Image search keeps giving me things with watermarks or visible containers.<br><br>There are ways to recover deleted pages, you know.

            <p>At least if it was a mainstream Pokйmon, it would have an established series of behaviors, abilities and reactions set up over the numerous generations. Missingno was never intended to exist, and did not exist at all after the first three games, so there&#39;s really nothing to work with on it. At least if they were restricted to being guardians of the OFU, they would behave as fitting their role, to protect the canon characters, keep the students within designated boundaries, and so on, regardless of what they actually <i>are</i>.<br>It seems more fitting that a mini for the Pokйmon continuum would be a version of something that existed in-canon in a significant fashion, like most of the other mini-propagating creatures are, instead of something that showed up in a small capacity for a limited amount of time but captured popular interest because of the odd circumstances that created it.<br><br>I mean, it&#39;s true that we have four dragon-like minis already(mini-Dragons, mini-Time Dragons, mini-neo-Bahamuts, and mini-Wehrs) and if I&#39;d made the choice I would have preferred something more specific and iconic like Meowth, one of the Pikachu clones, or an evolution of one of the starters(even Deoxys is actually a more unique choice, considering that its origins and activities are distinct from almost any other creature in the multiverse, but apparently it&#39;s out of consideration), but confirming the minis as versions of Rayquaza isn&#39;t bad. Rayquaza&#39;s been <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Emerald_Version">the focus of one of the games</a>, was the central antagonist in <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/M07">one of the movies</a> and was the antagonist representing Pokйmon in the <a href="http://www.ssbwiki.com/Subspace_Emissary">Subspace Emissary</a>, and it&#39;s the second-most important legendary Pokйmon in Hoenn, next to Jirachi. It&#39;s got the sort of recognition to carry a mini species, is willful and problematic to cause trouble for the Agents, and is distinct enough from the other draconic minis(representing a combination of Quetzalcoatl and an Asian dragon rather than the Western dragons shown by those four) to be more singular than it might be if it was one of the other Dragon-types like Salamence or Dragonite.<br><br>Also, changing it now raises a major question: what would have caused the mini-Rayquaza to appear in Sylibane&#39;s mission? If mini-Missingno usually appear in missions as well as within the Pokйmon OFU, why were they mini-Rayquaza that time? It can&#39;t just be a Missingno in Rayquaza&#39;s form, because one of the few things that is known about Missingno is that it cannot copy the form of another Pokйmon, and even if it could, it wouldn&#39;t have access to anything beyond the original 151, and the Agent within Sylibane&#39;s missions didn&#39;t seem surprised that the mini type was unusual, which makes it rather unlikely that there was some sort of metaphysical error.</p>

            <p>Well, the mini-Missingno.s (that looks really weird, but I can&#39;t imagine how else I would spell the plural) are given plenty of behaviors in the PFU; in fact, I would say they display a lot more personality than some other OFU minis I&#39;ve read.  Let&#39;s look at some excerpts:<br><br>&quot;<i>Several beings were spilling out of this pentagon, with forms that he vaguely recognized: although his Red and Blue days were behind him, he seemed to recall that they were the various forms of Missingno (weren&#39;t they too small, though?).</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Especially since a lot of the Missingnos were saying &#39;Mommy! Mommy!&#39;<br><br>To Liz.<br><br>He really hoped that was a mistake of some sort.<br><br>&#39;Quiet! Greet Mommy later!&#39; one (an Aerodactyl skeleton) yelled, making the others quiet down to an excited murmur.<br><br>The Aerodactyl skeleton then pushed a large pile of stapled-together papers towards Liz. &#39;Read.&#39;</i>&quot;<br><br>I do somewhat agree with your reasoning about Missingno. no longer being part of canon--which is actually why I dislike both Deoxys and Rayquaza, as well.  Generation III was a while ago, now, and we don&#39;t really see either affecting plots anymore.  Missingno. has the same problem, although at least it was around at the beginning of <i>Pokйmon</i>.  (There really is no good choice for a long-running monster Pokйmon that&#39;s served as a villain throughout the franchise; if it were up to me, I probably would have picked Mewtwo, myself.  Same problem as all the rest, but far more iconic.)<br><br>While Rayquaza may be unique from other draconic minis, Missingno. (and many actual Pokйmon, besides) would still provide far more diversity when taking all minis as a whole.<br><br>As to what would cause mini-Rayquazas to appear in Sylibane&#39;s mission: a writing mistake.  Even the PPC is not immune to them.  Many older missions contain typos and other SPaG errors, continuity problems, etc.  We&#39;ve also had at least one instance before where a mini type became popularized without appearing in writing, then being replaced by something else in an official capacity (mini-Jem Hadar getting replaced with mini-Tribbles for <i>Star Trek</i>).  And while a clever explanation was later developed for that continuum to have both a mission mini and an OFU mini, we don&#39;t strictly need to do that every time.  Sometimes, we just go on writing and ignore old info without feeling a need to explain it away.  (Exorcisms didn&#39;t originally require charge lists; the DF&#39;s head used to be called the Water Hyacinth, etc.)<br><br>What I was really hoping to accomplish with this thread was to narrow <i>Pokйmon</i> down to a single mini type.  As I mentioned before, I dislike continua with multiple minis; I think it&#39;s overly complex and inelegant to have more than one.  <i>Pokйmon</i>, despite its ostensible popularity, has seen all of four PPC missions in over a decade of this community&#39;s existence.  Of the six authors involved in writing those missions, only two are still active, and neither Lily-Gnome nor Makari have written any new missions in a year.  Only one of those missions, by one of the retired authors, actually produced minis.  I don&#39;t feel that the community is even invested in mini-Rayquazas to the point that we can&#39;t just retcon it.  (We have always been at war with Eurasia, after all.)</p>

            <p>The original OFU spelled Missingno without the period at the end. It&#39;s not strictly how the name appears in-game, but it&#39;s just as valid a spelling as MissingNO or MissingNo. or any of those other spellings that people use because the Kanto games predated Pokйmon&#39;s use of consistent punctuation and lowercase letters.<br><br>I&#39;m not seeing much other than choppy sentence structure and being very attached to their author for unique mini-Missingno activity. Were the other OFU minis just incredibly bland? I suppose it doesn&#39;t help that the Pokйmon OFU only has two published chapters before vanishing completely, so we don&#39;t get to see what might have been.<br>Besides, I was thinking more along the lines of what they would be capable of. Teleportation, duplicating items and movesets, Water Gun, and Sky Attack are pretty much the only things set by the games they appear in, which is both disparate and lacking by Pokйmon standards, and their reputation as a glitch might mean someone might give them any number of new abilities and attribute them to &quot;glitch powers&quot;, when a canonical entity should be diminished in power to make a mini, not increased. They aren&#39;t very well established, essentially. Rayquaza and Deoxys might have been left by the wayside in favor of new properties, but Missingno was never canon at <i>all</i>, and could only even be considered so within a very small time frame, since even the remakes of the Kanto games retconned Missingno and its cousins out of existence. That poses a bit of a problem.<br><br>Yes, that&#39;s the problem with Pokйmon, isn&#39;t it? New games and movies and shows come out every year, and every three years or so they drag another few dozen Pokйmon out into the light, leaving plenty of the existing ones unconsidered and forgotten about. The thing is, though, even if we picked something inconsequential like a mini-Luxio or a mini-Carbink, it would still be an improvement over Missingno, IMO, because it had an actual in-canon presence. Not that those two would be good choices, because they&#39;re not, but that&#39;s not the point. They do something, they have a well-defined power set, they might affect the average player&#39;s experience of the game rather than the experience of someone who went out of their way to create the conditions in which one could be encountered, and Missingno is so ill-defined that I&#39;m not even sure how we&#39;d decide which of its five primary forms an individual mini would take.<br>Mewtwo is another nice choice, by the way, since it&#39;s a presence in multiple generations of games as well as Super Smash Brothers Melee, has two movies and a television special dedicated to it, has well-established powers that could easily be toned down for the mini, and is a perpetual fan favorite. I&#39;d cast my vote for that if we were still in the process of selection.<br><br>But regarding your last point, about nobody in the community actually being invested in this... (sigh) you&#39;re probably right. I&#39;m probably one of only a few people who would give more thought than &quot;Huh. Didn&#39;t that used to be something else?&quot; if the mini was changed. I feel strongly about it to make another huge wall of text, but I&#39;m well noted to offer hundreds of words of support to a number of doomed topics. I admitted then and now that Rayquaza isn&#39;t the best choice. Out of the three minis we have, I&#39;d have supported Deoxys if it hadn&#39;t been apparently shoved off the table. But it&#39;s the choice that&#39;s there, due to multiple mentions in-story(not just Sylibane, either, even though I could only find one other example when pressed) and on the Board. Consistency is important, and consistency is the reason why we don&#39;t let anyone making a story in a continuum rewrite the mini as whatever they want when they want, even if the choice the second person makes is an improvement over the original. Rayquaza&#39;s not the worst choice, and though it is less diverse considering what we already have, it works well enough that I don&#39;t see any need to change it. Besides, the continuum will have multiple minis even if we decide to excise mini-Rayquaza from continuity, it&#39;s just that one will only exist in an OFU while the other exists both in an OFU and the Word Worlds for some reason.</p>

            <p>Am I the only one bothered about Rayquaza popping out of the lake in Brawl?  It&#39;s supposed to be the <i>sky</i>-themed Pokйmon, and they have it pop out of water!<br><br>I mean, my head canon for the Smash Bros. series is that it&#39;s just being acted out by a little kid with his toys.

So maybe the kid was just playing around water in his backyard, and didn&#39;t really know much or care about Rayquaza&#39;s origin?<br><br>But my nonsensical in-universe head canon aside, you would think Nintendo could represent their own property a little better.</p>

            <p>After all, the N64 Super Smash Bros game has Master Hand creating the characters and stages of the game by bringing dolls to life, and Super Smash Brothers Melee says that the place where the characters fight is an &quot;imaginary world&quot;, and that Master Hand is capable of crossing between that world and another. It makes sense that the person who is controlling and influencing the toys-turned-fighters would be the one who originally owned them. <br><br>I think the Rayquaza popping out of the water may have been because it&#39;s easier to make a lakeside stage than a stratosphere stage, especially for the purposes of a boss fight. No matter how cool that would&#39;ve been, the closest we got to one was Skyworld, and that was basically just another land-based stage but with clouds instead of dirt and enemies that could fly. Granted, the Rayquaza could have just as easily swooped down from the sky and attacked the team that was standing by the lake, but given the altitude at which Rayquaza usually dwells, there would be no reason for it to do that, since it is chiefly protective of its natural territory, which is said to be up near the ozone layer, and wouldn&#39;t pay much attention to anything happening on the ground. It would have made more sense for the Rayquaza to start harassing the Halberd, but the team already fights an OC boss up there, so it would&#39;ve been redundant.<br>SmashWiki seems to believe that Rayquaza was sleeping underwater, which sort of makes sense, because it might have been woken up by the Arwing crash and flew out of the water to retaliate, but if that was the case, there&#39;d be no reason for it to wait for Diddy Kong to show up. It would&#39;ve just collapsed the crashed Arwing with Dragon Pulse or Hyper Voice and flown off to find another lake. Even if this particular Rayquaza didn&#39;t know either of those moves, it at least could&#39;ve spat out a few Energy Balls or something instead of waiting for Fox to come out and reflect them back at it.</p>

            <p>The ironic overpower lurked there for me.  Those stupid platforms always shattered just as I was about to recover-grab them.  Like, 90% of the time, and I am NOT joking.  Whenever we got that stage, I focused more on staying on the ground than actually fighting, just because I knew what would happen if I got knocked away from the center.<br><br>See, I wish they had used Rayquaza on the Halberd instead of the random monster.  They should have made all the bosses be cameos from the different games, instead of making up generic monsters.  (Other than Tabuu; I can understand wanting a new character for the final, since most players would already now how to fight Master Hand.)  I just hope the new pair of Smashes is going to have an expanded Adventure Mode like Subspace Emissary, because I really liked that.<br><br>(And yeah, my head-canon says the kid gets older with the games.  Smash 64 had plushes and very simple mechanics.  Melee, the kid had started getting plastic action figures, and actually started playing the games, so the move sets got more complex.  Brawl is when they started branching out into non-Nintendo consoles, and got even more complex and violent.<br><br>The Primids and other SE enemies are probably random non-franchise toy monsters the kid had lying around and decided to throw in one day.)</p>

            <p>Missingno, being a glitch, has been known to look like other Pokemon.  Specifically, I recall my Missingno looking like a Kangaskhan.

            <p>When a Missingno takes on a non-pixellated form, it nabs one of the sprites not assigned to anything else. In-game, it can appear as the unidentified ghost from Lavender Tower, a few types of skeleton, or a number of ambiguous partially-loaded entities, but it can&#39;t take the form of another Pokйmon, and it can&#39;t change its shape once it selects one.</p>

            <p>What are minis, anyway? This isn&#39;t the only case of them changing over time - Star Trek has had both mini-Tribbles and mini-Gorn, for instance, and reading the <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8528580/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-Academy-of-Starfleet">current OFU</a> doesn&#39;t suggest an official explanation for that. I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve had people show &#39;formless&#39; minis on occasion, too.<br><br>So why do minis form? We know they&#39;re misspellings, which suggests a connection to the literalness of the Word Worlds: since, for instance, there is no Pokemon called Kangascan, the World decides there must be <i>something else</i> there. And since it&#39;s a spelling error, the thing that appears must be a monster - since spelling errors are bad, after all. But, being a manifestation of the Word World&#39;s sense of humour, it will also, generally, be friendly to the Canon Protection Initiative.<br><br>Perhaps the form of the mini depends on the expectation of any canon-friendly operatives in the area. So when Triumvir Cam- wait, sorry, wrong mythology, <i>Miss</i> Cam of OFUM first met the first mini, she saw what she expected - a miniature (since it&#39;s not real) manifestation of one of the worst monsters of Middle-earth - the Balrog.<br><br>As to how the other minis took their form, once people knew they existed, I propose three methods at various times:<br><br>-Their form grew out of their behaviour. Mini-Aragogs act like acrowhatsits, so even before seeing them, Meir Brin may have developed an idea of what they looked like - which projected onto them.<br><br>-Discussion among those who knew about them. If a debate (on the Board, say - or, in fiction, in HQ) leads to a general conclusion that, uh, Pokemon minis <i>must</i> be mini-Missingnos - and in this case, evidence to the contrary can be countered by Phobos&#39; argument - then people will be primed to see them in that way.<br><br>-Declarations from an OFU. If the Administrator of OFUDisc announces that Discworld minis are mini-Luggages, that&#39;s evidence enough for everyone, I think.<br><br>We have to assume here that PPC Agents do their homework - that they know what to expect in a new canon. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a reasonable assumption, though... maybe we should postulate some sort of cumulative effect? Like, if enough people believe something about a canon, then (when and only when the canon is already weakened by a badfic) it will tend to come true regardless of the current agents&#39; lack of belief? There might be a &#39;when not directly contradicted <i>by</i> the canon&#39; clause in there, too.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Oh, and to add - I think mini-Missingnos are the best (and funniest) solution, and that Phobos&#39; argument is a good way to get round any discrepancies.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But unfortunately, it&#39;s not entirely well-founded. There have been several instances of Agents encountering a mini in a story without knowing what it is, even if that encounter was the first mission in its continuum, which suggests that while minis are based on iconic beings, machines, and monsters, they are not derived from the list of iconic entities that those who encounter them are familiar with. Also, if the mini was decided based on the impressions that the first Agents encountering one had of the continuum, there would be a lot more redundancy than we have. For a prominent example, there are so many places that have, as their best-known creature, some form of dragon, and thus the Agents would be very familiar with those dragons and could, if the Word World was looking for a blank slate, project those dragons as the continuum&#39;s mini. But they don&#39;t. We have mini-Urgals and mini-Wehrs and such. And the idea that the Agents would be primed to see minis as a certain species through either discussion of what the mini has to be or examination of their behavior suggests as a logical extension that an uninformed Agent could see a mini that they encounter as one of any number of species from the continuum it hails from, which is just not a thing that happens.<br><br>As for the OFU declaration deciding what the mini species is, I think that explanation is looking at the problem from the wrong end. Of course the Coordinators know what the mini is for the world they supervise; they didn&#39;t make them or stabilize their form on this mortal plane, but they&#39;ve got a few hundred of them running around the halls. I&#39;m pretty sure the staff would know what they look like.<br><br>The Star Trek discrepancy actually has been explained. I mentioned it in one of my other posts, but the short form is: Tribbles are really bad at being guards, and so the OFAS Coordinators got Q, Star Trek&#39;s resident omnipotent being, to make them into mini-Gorn once they arrive, so that they can be better at what they do.<br><br>The first part is pretty indisputable, though, the section on how the Word World creates the minis because there has to be <i>something</i> there that goes by the uncanon name that&#39;s presented in the Words. See? Not everything I say in one of these threads is disagreeing with someone!</p>

            <p>That does mean, though, that we&#39;re left with the conclusion that the Word World &#39;chooses&#39; the mini type - or that the species of a mini is just an inevitable outgrowth of the world itself. Or, of course, that there&#39;s a group of authors who discuss these things and somehow &#39;choose&#39; what the minis should be... but you don&#39;t want to go too far down that road.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>For Agent Doc, it would be Barnard Herrmann&#39;s &quot;The Reading&quot; from the soundtrack of the awful, awful <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> movie.

            <p>...because we&#39;re on the same wavelength. *Is hit over the head by a rubber chicken*<br><br>Bad physics jokes aside, I&#39;ve actually been thinking of this lately.

She loves a good scrap, and this seemed appropriate.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldp18SX88AM">Patrol Officer Taldaris</a>: Protoss High Templar from the doomed planet Aiur. A slow, haunting theme for a 500-year old agent with limitless patience for his partner&#39;s antics.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5DgrFXPI2Y">Special Response Officer Terabyte</a>: (Spoiler text, highlight --&gt;)Reaper-upgraded Geth unit, platform manufactured on Rannoch a few months after the Morning War. A robotic tune for a robotic agent.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6Ky2BMVWfs">Special Response Officer Naya&#39;Keegan vas Iktomi</a>: A young quarian markswoman who lived nearly her entire life on board the Migrant Fleet. A catchy tune for a cheerful and happy-go-lucky personality.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiXWfxHHdAU">Special Response Officer &quot;The Guardsman&quot;</a> Real name Emiranlanoamar, a Time Lord soldier who survived the Time War.

            <p>I&#39;ve never really thought about it, but I guess Agent Miah would be Rob Zombie, possibly branching out to others in the same genre.<br><br>Cali...maybe The Dubliners (I know they sang and played stuff ranging from somber to raunchy to &quot;make you want to dance,&quot; but that just gives him more moods to choose from.)<br><br>Unger--something suitably heroic and epic like &quot;The Ride of the Valkyries&quot;<br><br>Kelok is kind of a harder one to think about. He&#39;s definitely not human, even though his home!fic made him much more human than he should be. He&#39;s kind of a nervous type, so something soothing--definitely none of that nature sounds  with ocean waves stuff, though (bad memories for him). Maybe something with strings or maybe chanting. I&#39;m not really sure on him. (of course he could turn out to just love pop.)<br><br>Oh brother, now I am going to have to write him having only listened to Classical and chanting and then hearing pop for the first time and loving it.  :P (You have no idea how funny the image of Kelok dancing Gangnam Style is in my head right now.)</p>

            <p>Yes, it&#39;s that time of year again: time for the terrifyingly hilarious Shipficfest, where we all write awful stories shipping each other with... each other. The rules... are simple:<br><br>-Reply in this thread to say if you&#39;re willing to be shipped. If someone doesn&#39;t say they&#39;re okay with it, don&#39;t write anything with them in it.<br>--With the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17DtDKNH0ZQCkrju7naEjGQV0PWWKBepCBzNQYiiqT4E/pub">list of ships we already have</a>, it&#39;d be helpful if everyone mentioned posted to say whether they were or weren&#39;t okay with having stories about them.<br><br>-Suggest any ships you want to. Revenge shipping is <i>absolutely</i> okay (and, indeed, encouraged).<br><br>-Write terrible stories! As <a href="http://freakish_five.webs.com/hSKaitlyn.htm">this example</a> from the first Shipfest shows, the goal is absolutely not to accurately portray other Boarders - it&#39;s to make a ludicrous parody of them. Obviously, you should only write about people who&#39;ve said it&#39;s okay, and should respect any other requests they&#39;ve made (example: son<em>of</em>heaven176 says he does not want to be shipped with other men).<br><br>Some notes:<br><br>-This is for <b>Boarders</b> (or community members in general), not <b>agents</b>.<br>-Keep the ratings down! PG-13, please - this is supposed to amuse, not disturb.<br>-It&#39;s a bit creepy to create a ship of yourself with another person - but <b>writing</b> one that someone else came up with is fine.<br><br>And, just to lend a little encouragement... in the spirit of the first few Shipfests, I will be writing a story with every single ship of me that comes up (and is allowed by the other participants). Make of that what you will.<br><br>(Also, obvious fact: Kaitlyn and I are both available for shipping)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>And, since we already did a preparatory post: the Ships So Far!<br><br>(Note that appearing on this list doesn&#39;t mean the participants have agreed to be written about - check the thread for that, or look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17DtDKNH0ZQCkrju7naEjGQV0PWWKBepCBzNQYiiqT4E/pub">GDoc version</a>, where I&#39;ll try to keep highlighting up to date)

No? No, me neither.

Must be the S-T thing. (The Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ship)<br><br>Autumn<em>68/son</em>of<em>heaven176: name</em>number - coincidence, or conspiracy?<br><br>Lily Winterwood/DawnFire: because they so completely remind me of each other.<br><br>VixenMage/DawnFire: CamelCase - the ship!<br><br>Araeph/Neshomeh: Red pens of the <s>world</s> <font color="”red”">PPC</font>, unite!<br><br>Lily Winterwood/Ekyl: Multiverse Moniship.<br><br>Bryn/VixenMage: Oh, sure, they just <i>happened</i> to come back at the same time…/because they&#39;re both returnbies who returned to the Board recently<br><br>Sergio Turbo x Firemagic OTP :P/They’ve just been in the same shipping thread, after all.../because the two of them have collaborated on anime-related missions.<br><br>Sergio Turbo/desdendelle because you&#39;re in the consecutive time zones and play World of Tanks together.<br><br>desdendelle/firemagic<br><br>Sergio Turbo/firemagic/Desdendelle. Occam’s razor. A cuddly sandwich of anime and magical girls and bespectacled folks.<br><br>DawnFire x Firemagic because fire<br><br>Dawn Fire/Desdendelle, because they lived in the same country once and everyone loves a soldier.<br><br>Lily Winterwood x DawnFire, because DF is part Canadian and Lily has Winter in her name.<br><br>DawnFire/Time Engineer. They know each other IRL, I hear.<br><br>DawnFire/DemonFiren because that sounds awesome<br><br>Lily Winterwood/Desdendelle, because you&#39;ve both just shipped DawnFire with people.<br><br>Lielac and Rin because of that tilde thing <br><br>IntelligentAirhead and Lily Winterwood because they&#39;re writing fic together now. [‘IntelligentAirhead and I are in that fuzzy place between a relationship and friendship (it&#39;s the distance thing), so yeah.’]<br><br>Doctorlit/Neshomeh: because I can&#39;t say &quot;the wiki&quot;.<br><br>Huinesoron/Neshomeh seems like a really good brotp. Mostly because of the wheelhouse joke. And the number of times they&#39;ve backed each other up./I honestly thought it when I was a newbie.<br><br>Kaitlyn/Phobos, so they can comfort each other over their lost loves.<br><br>Huinesoron/Kaitlyn/Neshomeh/Phobos.

We don&#39;t want to know what you get up to. [‘It involves a lot of space. No, not that space, the final frontier space.’]<br><br>Storme Hawk/hS - &#39;Cause they&#39;ve both got bird names.<br><br>hS/VM - I ship the two-letter abbreviations.<br><br>firemagic/wobblestheclown/darklordaakmal - No capitals? Words slammed together? I&#39;d ship that.<br><br>Storm Hawk/SeaTurtle/99Hedgehog/Sevenswans - So many animal names to ship.<br><br>Huinesoron/Lily Winterwood - They do seem to be enjoying each others&#39; company further down the thread. This ship is totally not a revengeship. Nope.<br><br>DawnFire/Karen - Day call demselves Brain Twins! Day arrre worken on an OFU togethar! Karen even wrote a poem for Dawn! Iffen dat aint enough resens for yeh, oi don&#39;t know what to tell yah.<br><br>DemonFiren/darklordaakmal - Because Dark Lords and Demons need somebody to brood with. Oh, wait, my accent.

            <p>&quot;Oh no--!&quot;<br><br>&quot;-- I&#39;m late!&quot;<br><br>Two human bodies collided - male and female, black hair and brown. They went down hard, and only the thickness of the carpet prevented any bruising. The girl ended up on top, and had to brush her errant hair away from her freckled face.<br><br>&quot;Sorry!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I didn&#39;t see you! I was late for--&quot;<br><br>&quot;-- the shipfest?&quot; the guy finished. &quot;Me too. I&#39;m Khroma.&quot;<br><br>&quot;KittyEden,&quot; the girl provided. &quot;So you&#39;re here for the shipping?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Mais oui,</i>&quot; Khroma agreed, and KittyEden swooned.<br><br>&quot;You speak French! That&#39;s <i>so romantic</i>! The only way you could be more romantic is if you had a rose between your teeth!&quot;<br><br>Khroma winced. &quot;Tried that once,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s... not as good as it sounds.&quot;<br><br>On the thick carpet, footsteps made no sound; the pair didn&#39;t even realise someone had joined them until he spoke. &quot;This must be the place, then.&quot;<br><br>KittyEden turned her head, and Khroma peered past her at the tall man looming over them. &quot;That is a <i>very</i> impressive beard,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; the newcomer said, smiling. &quot;I&#39;m Elcalion. And this must be the shipfest.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; &quot;No...&quot;<br><br>Elcalion raised an eyebrow. &quot;No? What <i>are</i> you doing, then?&quot;<br><br>KittyEden looked down, realising that she was still on top of Khroma. &quot;Falling over?&quot; she offered.<br><br>&quot;Looks more comfortable than I remember,&quot; Elcalion chuckled. &quot;So you&#39;re <i>not</i> here for the shipping?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We are,&quot; Khroma said, &quot;but we can&#39;t find it.&quot;<br><br>Elcalion shook his head. &quot;You don&#39;t find <i>it</i>,&quot; he told them, &quot;it finds <i>you</i>. You trip over a sexy woman, or a hot man, and just... go with it.&quot;<br><br>Khroma and KittyEden looked at each other. &quot;Well, we got the first part done,&quot; Khroma said slowly.<br><br>The running figure caught them all by surprise, ploughing into Elcalion and knocking him down on top of the other two. The newcomer, wearing a badge proclaiming &quot;Hi my name is y2k890!&quot;, was caught in the collapse. &quot;Oh no! Now I&#39;ll <i>never</i> make it to the shipfest!&quot;<br><br>&quot;My dear y2k890,&quot; Elcalion said, wrapping one arm around KittyEden, the other around y2k890, &quot;the shipfest, for us, is right here.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Because I don&#39;t like to see anyone left out.</p>

She screamed, scrambled to her feet, tripped forward, fell, screamed again as those hands brushed over her again, but now they gripped hard, hauling her to her feet and dragging her back against the wall from behind, but her hands and body felt only the damp stone beneath the castles and-<br><br>And then she remembered, as cold, earthy-smelling breath washed over her cheek from behind her and made her gag.

            <p>Outhra woke up confused. First he was confused at the army jacket and white beret the he hadn&#39;t been wearing before, then at the short, very angry Asian girl with the circular hat and the oversized green shirt. &quot;Hello?&quot; he said to the girl carefully. She turn on him with an angry glare. He couldn&#39;t help but notice she looked kinda pretty that way. It didn&#39;t last long though as her faced grew calmer. Now she looked even prettier. &quot;I&#39;m Lily, sorry if I scared you, its just some people should know better then to combine ships&quot; she said sweetly. There was a thump, and sounds of scuffling. The girl-Lily turned away from him &quot; Excuse me I have to go teach Seychelles a lesson&quot; She turned away from him cracking her knuckles as she advanced down the hall. Yup, Outhra thought to himself. He was in love.</p>

            <p>Where did I learn html coding? When I wanted to do fancy things on the Board and several kind people told me how.

            <p>It&#39;s not actually correct HTML to use headers such as &lt;h1&gt;&amp;lt/h1&gt; just to make the font bigger. Headers are block-level tags, like paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;), and are used to distinguish structural parts of a document.

Maybe there&#39;s a character limit. A lot of the phrases that didn&#39;t take were longer than five words. I also ran some Boaders&#39; names through, and the only ones that took were yours, Trojanhorse&#39;s, Neshomeh&#39;s, and Huinesoron&#39;s; yours was the same red as &quot;color hex code&quot;, Neshomeh&#39;s was catapult blue, Trojie&#39;s was mountain lion green, and Huinesoron&#39;s was <font color="Huinesoron">a particular shade of green that I didn&#39;t see anywhere else.</font></p>

            <p>This information comes from <a href="http://scrappy-do.blogspot.de/2004/08/little-rant-about-microsoft-internet.html">this article</a>, and I&#39;ve just tested it.<br><br>First key point, and one that&#39;s not mentioned in the article: capitals don&#39;t matter. F and f are equally valid numbers.<br><br>Second key point: if you have spaces, and <i>don&#39;t</i> surround your phrase with quotes (&#39;single&#39; or &quot;double&quot;), only the <b>first word</b> will be counted. Checking the source, Outhra didn&#39;t use quotes, so your <font color="color">color hex code</font> was simply <font color="color">color</font>; this is what <font color="color hex code">&quot;color hex code&quot;</font> looks like.<br><br>Third key point: the parser flat-out ignores any symbols in your sentence which aren&#39;t hexidecimal values. Since no-one&#39;s using digits, that means the only letters, punctuation, or spaces that count are abcdef. And, in fact, only a maximum of six of them.<br><br>The method for finding the colour value of a (more than six letter) phrase goes like this:<br><br>-Write down the string.<br>-Replace everything that isn&#39;t 0123456789abcdef - yes, replace the spaces too - with a 0. So &quot;Huinesoron&quot; becomes simply &quot;0000e00000&quot;.<br>--That step is why a lot of names come out as fairly bold colours, and indeed identical ones: a lot of the used symbols will be 0s.<br>-Add 0s to the end of the string to the nearest multiple of three - in this case, &quot;Huinesoron&quot; was 10 letters, so I add 2 more to make &quot;0000e0000000&quot;.<br>-Split the string into three equal parts: &quot;0000 e000 0000&quot;.<br>-If the parts are over 8 letters each, trim each part from the <b>left</b> until they&#39;re exactly 8. This doesn&#39;t apply here, but 123456789 would become 23456789.<br>-If/once they&#39;re 8 or under, trim from the right until you have 2 letters per part. So in my case, that&#39;s &quot;00 e0 00&quot;.<br>-That&#39;s a hex value, and will give the exact same colour as my name if you HTML it as [font color=&quot;#00e000&quot;].<br><br>For comparison:<br><br><font color="Huinesoron">&quot;Huinesoron&quot;</font><br><font color="#00e000">&quot;#00e000&quot;</font><br><br>Of course, you can <i>reverse</i> this... if you wanted, for instance, to make a phrase come out in a nice medium grey - let&#39;s say <font color="#a0a0a0">#a0a0a0</font>, you&#39;d have the following options, where ~ indicates any letter, number, punctuation or space, = indicates anything <i>except</i> the valid hex values (though it can be 0), and (=) and (~) indicate any of those or nothing:<br><br>/a=a=a(=) - so <font color="anamal">&quot;anamal&quot;</font> works.<br>/a=~a=~a(=)(~) - so <font color="an ansa">&quot;an ansa&quot;</font> works.<br>/a=~~a=~~a=(~)(~) - the final = has to exist, or else it would be a 9-item string. <font color="all are anna">&quot;all are anna&quot;</font> works, and is sort of a working sentence.<br>/a=~~~a=~~~a=~(~)(~) - so <font color="amanda is awful">&quot;amanda is awful&quot;</font> is our first valid sentence.<br><br>You can sort of see how this is going, can&#39;t you?<br><br>And just for giggles: other phrases that match me exactly (with quotes):<br><br>00e000<br><font color="oliver twist">oliver twist</font><br><font color="Ho, me shipmate">Ho, me shipmate</font><br><font color="!!!!!!e!!!!!!!!!">!!!!!!e!!!!!!!!!</font><br><br><font color="hS">hS</font> (which is two letters, and thus uses slightly different rules - but since neither is a hex value, is just black anyway)</p>

Since her last lover had given her the Other One Ring, her hair had inexorably lightened as the corruption took hold. Previously a brunette, she now wasn&#39;t so much platinum blonde as plutonium. She wished it would stop singing Evanescence songs of its own accord and glowing in the dark, but it was a small price to pay.<br><br>&quot;Yes, my love,&quot; said Legolas. His voice was bland and his expression was similar to a concussed weasel.<br><br>&quot;woot! lemme get that sweet elfy pants-noodle!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, my love, your eyes are so beautiful in the moonlight, so similar in hue and brightness.&quot;<br><br>&quot;talk later, now make with the crotch-carrot!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I feel blessed that my body may sully such full, cherry-red lips.&quot;<br><br>&quot;mmfl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;OKAY, THAT&#39;S IT! EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL!&quot; The door burst open to reveal a looming figure. He was male. Extremely male, if the shadow was anything to go by.<br><br>&quot;mmfwah? huh? whats going on?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dawn, we&#39;ve talked about this. No mind controlling fictional characters and turning them into sex slaves. You know what happened when the police broke up your last play party. For God&#39;s sake, Hermione nearly died!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I... I think...&quot; Legolas&#39;s expression cleared a little, and his eyes seemed less dim. &quot;I do not know this place. Where are the halls of Rivendell? Why is my portrait on that long cushion? What is this-&quot;<br><br>&quot;oh no ya don&#39;t. someone needs his boosters.&quot; Dawn raised her hand and the Other One Ring flashed. She looked back at her flatmate. &quot;now can ya leave? we were kind of in the middle of something, weren&#39;t we, snookums?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He said Rivendell.&quot;<br><br>&quot;uh yeah-&quot; A light bulb pinged on in Dawn&#39;s mind. &quot;uh-oh. oh shoot. dont be mad-&quot;<br><br>&quot;He has leaf-shaped ears.&quot;<br><br>&quot;youre doing the thing dude. youre doing the getting mad thing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We had a deal, damn it! You leave Middle-Earth alone or I leave and take your brain bling to the authorities!&quot;<br><br>&quot;not gonna happen.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then he leaves. Now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;not gonna happen either.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then-&quot;<br><br>&quot;third option.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What-&quot;<br><br>Dawn&#39;s ring glittered, and the sparkles rose from it and settled on the man&#39;s eyes like scales on a dragon&#39;s back.<br><br>&quot;third. option. legolas, lookit that, you got yourself a playmate!&quot;<br><br>Legolas turned, his movements stiff. &quot;Hail, friend of my queen. What do your lovers call you?&quot;<br><br>The man&#39;s eyes were spinning up in their sockets and blood was rushing away from his head, but he still managed one word before the madness took him.<br><br>&quot;Huinesoron.&quot;</p>

            <p>IntelligentAirhead would have gasped as she ran, if she had not had a piece of toast in her mouth.

            <p>(Is it revengshipping if we agreed to this beforehand?)<br><br>T&#39;Intel and T&#39;Firemagic were on the surface of an unexplored planet, scanning the area for signs of life. There was nothing there except for a couple flowers. However when they got closer to the flowers they found themselves walking through a haze of pollen. T&#39;Intel sneezed, which was kinda un-Vulcan of her. <br><br>&quot;Are you hurt?&quot; asked T&#39;Firemagic.<br><br>&quot;The pollen is affecting my nervous and endocrine systems.&quot; said T&#39;Intel.<br><br>&quot;How is it affecting your endocrine syetem?&quot; asked T&#39;Firemagic curiously.<br><br>&quot;It is making me want to have sex.&quot;<br><br>T&#39;Firemagic realised then that the pollen they had inhaled was sex pollen. The other members of the away team had already succumbed to the temptation.<br><br>&quot;We must control these urges,&quot; said T&#39;Firemagic.<br><br>&quot;Indeed,&quot; agreed T&#39;Intel. &quot;But could I at least have a hug?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; said T&#39;Firemagic, so the two Vulcans hugged.<br><br>&quot;We should move away from the flowers and the rest of the away team,&quot; said T&#39;Intel.<br><br>&quot;Good idea,&quot; said T&#39;Firemagic.<br><br>&quot;And maybe we could touch each other&#39;s fingers,&quot; added T&#39;Intel.<br><br>&quot;Of course,&quot; said T&#39;Firemagic.<br><br>&quot;Perhaps a mind meld?&quot; wondered T&#39;Intel once they had sequestered themselves into a cave far away from the sex pollen and the, ahem, busy away team. <br><br>&quot;If you want,&quot; agreed T&#39;Firemagic.<br><br>&quot;Very well,&quot; said T&#39;Intel, and they melded.<br><br>END.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t realize it until a while into the movie, but my younger (ten-ish) brother had snuck up and was also watching from around the corner.<br><br>The way I discovered he was there is that I heard him giggling.<br><br>He pretty much laughed through the whole movie.  (Although I don&#39;t think he stayed to the spider* part at the end.)<br><br>So I guess it kind of supports your argument; my brother had never been given reason to fear clowns, and wasn&#39;t frightened of a clown doing overtly scary things.

            <p>My eyes, they water.<br><br>I see you have introduced another rank into the clown hierarchy. Now, in addition to the whiteface clown, instigator of comedy, the auguste clown, recipient of slapstick, and the other third one I can never remember, there is now the shouty clown, who peppers their circus act with unprompted rage.<br><br>doo-doo-DOO doo-doo-doo-DOO doo-doo-DOO <i><b>IF YOU KIDS CAME HERE EXPECTING NOT TO SEE ME JUGGLE BALLOON ANIMALS, YOU&#39;VE  GOT ANOTHER THING COMING!</b></i><br>DOO doo-Doo-doo DOO-doo-doo doo <i><b>LOOK HOW WHIMSICAL I AM! IF YOU AREN&#39;T OVERJOYED BY THIS INCREDIBLE DISPLAY OF MIRTH, I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU!</b></i><br><br>I&#39;m with you on Pennywise being a poor indicator of the average clown, though. The guy just wanders around laughing awkwardly in public places, obsessing over balloons and other things that float, growing sharp teeth for no reason, and occasionally turning into a giant spider. He&#39;s not funny, the way most clowns are, and he&#39;s not scary, which is what he was intended to be. He is kind of a mess all around. Do people really see him as the prime example of clownhood?</p>

            <p>The Joker&#39;s current persona wasn&#39;t created for him. It was inspired by Frank Gorshin&#39;s performance of the Riddler in the Batman 1966 TV show. The Joker used to be very different. His plans during the 50s and 60s were more often comprised of nonsense and pranks that he thought would be fun at any given moment, basically like Gotham&#39;s version of Discord. He was still a dangerous killer in his first few appearances, but back then he hadn&#39;t really been developed and was originally intended as one of Batman&#39;s many villains-of-the-week.<br>Personally, I think unpredictable and dangerous fits better on the Riddler. The guy&#39;s been given a bad reputation in the pantheon of Batman villains that he really doesn&#39;t deserve, sort of like the evil counterpart to Aquaman, and that&#39;s probably because the self-styled Clown Prince of Crime took most of his distinctive personality traits. That and the Super Friends TV show, which is another low point that he shares with Aquaman.</p>

            <p>I cannot begrudge anyone with coulrophobia, however mild. It&#39;s for much the same reasons I hope people do not begrudge my own phobia. Cynophobia, FYI. I cannot handle dogs at all under any circumstances.<br><br>I have not been bitten by a dog. Nor have I been attacked by a dog in any way. I still pretty much freeze up whenever dogs come near me and I&#39;ve suffered panic attacks when dragged to the vet by my parents when I was younger. Why did I go? My parents being the sort of people who regard phobic reactions as non-existent unless they&#39;re prefixed with homo- or xeno-, at which point they agree with them and consider writing another letter to the Daily Mail and I&#39;m getting really off topic and Freud would probably have an absolute field day with this.<br><br>I imagine it is largely the same for people with coulrophobia, arachnophobia, nyctophobia, or any of the other phobias. Phobic reactions are <i>irrational</i>. I cannot in good conscience attack someone for a medical condition that is not their fault.<br><br>I can and will attack people for going &quot;Ew clowns are creepy I never want one near my children&quot; when you need more extensive and strenuous background checks to be a children&#39;s entertainer in the UK than you do to own a high-powered assault rifle in the US. I will attack the media for pushing the image of the Monster Clown without showing the good side. I will attack the media for having the last real popular image of clowns that <i>aren&#39;t</i> axe murderers or paedophiles-in-waiting be one designed to sell dangerously-produced boxed helpings of cowpat flambйe to impressionable children. THINGS SHOULD NOT BE AS THEY ARE.<br><br>Perhaps there are more worthwhile causes. Actually, scratch that, of course there are more worthwhile causes. But this one I can actually do something about besides middle-class slacktivist hand-wringing and the occasional bin liner full of old clothes to whichever charity shop&#39;s got the proprietor with the sanest expression. I can change people&#39;s experiences of clowns. I can change people&#39;s minds. I can get them to accept that the clown is, essentially, a positive force.<br><br>The clown is your friend, because the clown is everyone&#39;s friend. The clown might be silly and goofy and prone to acts of pratfalling clumsiness that border on self-harm - seriously, ask Ailavyn and Techno-Dann how much pain you go through as a trapeze artist and imagine doing it in bouncy trousers and shoes the size of a small South American country - but it&#39;s to make you laugh and smile. This is the best thing. This is the only thing <i>worth</i> doing, to me at least. Making someone&#39;s life better, even if they only feel better, is the best thing to do with your life, and the best part of that is how many forms it can take! If you&#39;re a doctor you&#39;re doing it, if you&#39;re a binman you&#39;re doing it, even if you&#39;re a politician you&#39;re probably doing it for a certain amount of people (mostly the ones that funded your election campaign and very occasionally one of the cleaner voters): it&#39;s all worth it if it makes someone else smile. At least to me.<br><br>That&#39;s what the clown is to me. Not a monster under the bed, but the person who makes it go away.</p>

            <p>&quot;Seriously, guys? <i>Seriously</i>?&quot; DawnFire glared up at Outhra and Phobos. &quot;Guess off-topicness is in this year, huh?

It doesn&#39;t generally require a reason.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agreed,&quot; Outhra put in. &quot;Actually, the word nonsense can be used to refer to--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not now,&quot; DawnFire said, and sighed. &quot;Do either of you want to explain the colored text, please? And the, I don&#39;t even know, the chatspeak? Netspeak? Something?&quot;<br><br>Phobos and Outhra exchanged looks. &quot;I have an explanation,&quot; Outhra said finally. &quot;But I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be too happy with it.&quot;<br><br>DawnFire raised both eyebrows. &quot;Why not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s composed entirely of technobabble and references to two animes, three messageboards, and a cheetah.&quot;<br><br>There was silence. Eventually, Phobos broke it.<br><br>&quot;Well, in light of that--LOOK, A CLOWN ARMY!&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>What</i>?&quot; DawnFire turned to look. Behind her, Phobos grabbed Outhra&#39;s hand, and they ran for it. By the time the female Boarder turned back, they were...well, only about ten feet away, really, but they kept running. DawnFire rolled her eyes.<br><br>&quot;Whatever,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Better get back to Canada, I&#39;m missing some maple-leaf shaped pancakes...&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>&quot;Nonsense is fun,&quot; Outhra said, panting, as they finally came to a half. &quot;We&#39;ve lost her, right?&quot;<br><br>Phobos checked. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;Actually, I&#39;m not quite sure where we are anymore. We seem to have lost ourselves.&quot;<br><br>They considered this.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; Outhra said at last, &quot;at least we&#39;re still together.&quot;<br><br>Phobos nodded slowly. &quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And,&quot; Outhra added, &quot;there&#39;s no one around.&quot;<br><br>Phobos nodded again, less slowly. &quot;I&#39;m aware of that, yes. Why--?&quot;<br><br>Outhra shrugged, moving closer. &quot;No interruptions. We could have a great discussion...&quot;<br><br>Phobos started to grin, nodding. &quot;A discussion. With no one to stop us or curb our details. That sounds wonderful.&quot;<br><br>And with that, both Boarders leaned in...<br><br><br>--<br>And, there you have it. My first completed shipfic, although technically not the first I&#39;ve written (but that&#39;s still in the works at the moment).<br><br>Apologies, of course. Sort of.

            <p>DawnFire had just sat down to her meal of maple-leaf shaped pancakes when there was a knock on her door.  She let out an exasperated sigh and pushed herself away from the table.  As she walked sullenly to the door she muttered under her breath about being interrupted and things she might do with a hockey-stick to whoever this was.<br><br>The knock came again.  &quot;I&#39;m coming!&quot; she called, wondering why her dining room was so far from the front door.  &quot;Hold your horses.&quot;  She reached the door and opened it.<br><br>Outside, there was a man in a dress.

            <p>It took me a while before I figured stuff out. It&#39;s actually kind of funny because my mom was- still is, to be honest- incredibly confused when I told her and dad that I like girls, too. She&#39;s always saying stuff like, &quot;You never acted like it before!&quot; And she also can&#39;t seem to grasp that there&#39;s more to sexuality than just gay, straight, bi, and asexual.

Any questions?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um...yes,&quot; said Techno-Dann.  &quot;Why is it necessary for us to be naked and covered in grease paint?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very important, that,&quot; explained wobbles.  She gestured with the rubber chicken as she continued.  &quot;You need to get in touch with your inner clown, and the best way to do that is to get in touch with your outer clown.&quot;<br><br>Ailavyn raised her hand.  &quot;So, why are you naked, then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; said wobbles, a mischievous glint in her eye, &quot;sometimes the best way to get in touch with your inner clown is to get in touch with someone <i>else&#39;s</i> outer clown.  Now, if that is all the questions...&quot;<br><br><br><br>[[ I regret nothing. -Phobos ]]</p>

            <p>&quot;All shall bow before me! None may dispute my might!&quot;<br><br>A deafening silence burned through the Hall of Kings as the nobles and slaves cowered together. Dread Emperor Phobos reached down slowly to lift the crown from the fallen king&#39;s brow, and raised it over his own head.<br><br>There was a knock at the door.<br><br>Phobos froze in place, crown mere inches from his hair. &quot;Er... is anyone going to get that?&quot; he bellowed.<br><br>There was no reply. The nobles all averted their gazes from him.<br><br>There was another knock at the door.<br><br>&quot;Oh, <i>fine</i>.&quot; Grasping the crown in one hand, the Dread Emperor Phobos stalked across the Hall of Kings and wrenched the door open. Outside stood a diminutive man dressed in immaculately-tailored black velvet suit, hand raised to knock a third time.<br><br>&quot;Oh thanks,&quot; the man said, stepping under the Dread Emperor&#39;s outstretched arm, into the hall. &quot;It&#39;s awful weather out there, and you know how orcs get when they&#39;re out in the rain. Awful, simply awful.&quot; The small man registered the sight in the hall, and beamed. &quot;Oh, is all this for me? Very kind of you, but you don&#39;t have to. I just want to sell clothes, really. But I suppose I&#39;ll rule you if I have to.&quot; He reached for the crown in Phobos&#39; hand.<br><br>The Dread Emperor drew his hand back as if burned. &quot;You do not rule here!&quot; he declared. &quot;I am the Dread Emperor Phobos! I have slain the king, and none may challenge my right to his domains!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, really, that&#39;s a shame, actually,&quot; said the little man, &quot;because I&#39;m actually a Dark Lord myself, you know? I don&#39;t like to go on about it, I&#39;m more interested in the clothes, but I do happen to be darklordaakmal - a little problem with the scribes way back when, you see - and I-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cease your prattling!&quot; the Dread Emperor Phobos boomed. &quot;I shall crush you like a watermelon!&quot;<br><br>&quot;A watermelon? Really? That&#39;s what you&#39;re going with?&quot; the diminutive Dark Lord shook his head sadly. &quot;And I just had this suit made, too. Although... there <i>is</i> an alternative.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I care not for alternatives!&quot; Phobos proclaimed, then frowned. &quot;Probably,&quot; he amended. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, it&#39;s in the rules, you know? Two Dark Lords, or Dread Emperors as it may be, who both claim the same kingdom, can decide the matter in a duel.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I... but... that&#39;s what <i>I</i> said.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, but no.&quot; Darklordaakmal glanced at the crown, then looked back at Phobos. &quot;This isn&#39;t a duel of weapons or strength, but a duel of <i>lust</i>.&quot;<br><br>Phobos blinked once, then again, and then a <i>third</i> time before saying, &quot;You mean... who can sleep with the most women, that sort of thing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah. No.&quot; Darklordaakmal beamed up at the Dread Emperor. &quot;Tell me - are you familiar with the term &#39;slash&#39;?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>It&#39;s a good thing we&#39;re not currently writing for the Baronies of Plort, or Baron Phobos might get ideas...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You can&#39;t fool me, Anonymous. I know you&#39;re secretly Phobos, or perhaps Neshomeh, or perhaps a servant of one of those two, planting the seeds in the Board collective mentality for Phobos to rise up and overthrow the other Barons/Permission Givers! But your plan was imperfect! <i>I</i> figured you out, and I am usually terrible at figuring out plans!<br><br>Unless... you intended for someone to figure you out. Unless this entire charade was a red herring! But that&#39;s even less likely than me stumbling onto a villainous plot all by myself, so it&#39;s not really worth considering.

            <p>That&#39;s the first drop I ever learned, despite everyone else learning either star or slack drop first. I love it so much.

            <p>I&#39;m torn between the two... You&#39;re right, fabric hurts a lot less. On the other hand, there are things that can be done on the rope that just look straight-up impossible - the Russian climb variation for rope, toe climb (I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called?), and so on...<br><br>And yes. I continue to be amazed by classmates and other classes. They make it look like gravity is really just a suggestion.<br><br>A couple weeks ago, there were a couple little kids in the waiting area during my class. I was doing Catcher&#39;s Sequence -&gt; Peter Pan -&gt; Candlestick on the rope, and they were staring  with wide eyes and open mouths. For a moment there, I felt like a real aerialist! And then I got to the big sit-up at the end of Candlestick and was quietly muttering profanities. But the point is that you are entirely capable of amazing people, regardless of how long you have or haven&#39;t studied.</p>

            <p>Have you ever seen a really, really skilled person on silks? Or even just someone who has their splits? *watches them float* Although I do agree with you in that rope is basically pure strength, and you can see that when someone&#39;s performing. There is nothing quite like a professional rope act. (Well, maybe a straps act. Anyone who does straps as their primary apparatus earns my instant respect.) Maybe it&#39;s because the rope is so stark and simple that it feels like the performer isn&#39;t hiding anything, whereas tissu is sort of made for grace and flowiness and really pretty lines and <i>look at Anna and Ava&#39;s amazing doubles tissu act that I somehow got grafted onto for the library show</i>--<br><br>*ahem* Right. Yeah. Sorry, sort of got carried away there.<br><br>(And I hate toe climb with a burning passion. It <i>hurts</i>, and I can never coordinate my hands and my feet anyways. I&#39;m not very good at really any of the fancy climbs, unless it&#39;s straddle climb, and even then I&#39;ve not been doing much rope or tissu lately so I think my straddle-ups are suffering.)<br><br><i>&quot;Gravity just a suggestion...&quot;</i> Oh, <i>yes</i>. Have you ever seen a cloudswing act? One of the teachers I&#39;ve had, Eve, did cloudswing, and the one time I saw her in a show... <i>wow</i>. It&#39;s called cloudswing for a reason. (And yes, there&#39;s probably an infinite number of apparatuses.)<br><br>I literally do not know any of the tricks you just mentioned because literally everything has about a million names (well, except star drop), and that only gets worse when certain enterprising people such as myself make up names for tricks they, well, don&#39;t know the names for or have just improvised. Although I&#39;ve taken to calling tricks I&#39;ve made up names more along the lines of &quot;that twirly thing from fish that&#39;s sort of like an opposite unicorn&quot; than anything coherent, so I&#39;m probably not the best example.<br><br>But yes, that <i>feeling</i>! When you get down, and people are clapping, and it was a good run for once, and you hurt, but there is an audience clapping for you, <i>for you!</i> and you&#39;re actually satisfied with how you did, and you finally remembered to smile--<br><br>Really, if you do circus, you&#39;re gonna want to show off. That&#39;s just the way things go.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>I got this one from hS&#39;s list of ships; I would never have come up with this idea in a million years. And yeah, I kind of twisted the whole &#39;ship&#39; thing, but I thought it was funny. So... yeah. Enjoy!<br><br><br>The sickly sweet smell of purйed watermelon was what finally woke Desdendelle. He groaned and opened his eyes, blinking owlishly as he tried to make out his surroundings. The floor beneath him seemed to be moving, which, coupled with the watermelon smell, didn&#39;t exactly do wonders for his stomach.<br><br>&quot;Oh, good, you&#39;re awake,&quot; a girl said. Des looked around for the speaker. A lanky girl who looked to be about his age was sitting on what looked to be a horse-print Japanese body pillow, fiddling with a small painted wooden duck.<br><br>&quot;What- who-?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, sorry, I guess I should have introduced myself.&quot; The girl tossed the duck over her shoulder and  moved from the pillow to sit next to Des; he realized that, for whatever reason, he was lying in a pile of fluffy plush penguins. The girl gave him an apologetic smile. &quot;I&#39;m Iximaz. My friend Randa&#39;s around here somewhere, and that&#39;s Bernard in the corner, and the lady you&#39;re sitting on is Neshomeh.&quot;<br><br>Des jumped almost a foot when the mound of penguins shifted, revealing a woman dressed in a penguin suit. &quot;What even-?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Someone say my name?&quot; penguin!Neshomeh asked, yawning. She focused on Des. &quot;Oh, hello.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh... hi?&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh smiled vaguely and buried herself back under the penguins. A moment later, a faint snoring could be heard issuing from the mound.<br><br>Des shook himself and stood- rather, he tried to stand. The floor pitched, throwing him off his feet and into a small stack of books titled <i> Zambezi Mod for Civilisation V.</i> An indignant <i> squawk</i> from the unlucky penguin he&#39;d landed on echoed through the room. <br><br>Iximaz held out a hand and pulled Des off the poor bird. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fine,&quot; he replied, swatting a sticky electric toothbrush off his pants. Where the heck had that come from? And was that penguin wearing bikini mail? What the-?<br><br>&quot;Uh, I guess you want to know what&#39;s going on,&quot; Iximaz said, leading Des over to a wall and sitting down. Des hesitated, but when the floor rocked again, he decided he&#39;d rather sit than risk falling on another aquatic bird.<br><br>&quot;An explanation would be nice,&quot; he said.<br><br>Iximaz grimaced apologetically. &quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t <i> my</i> idea, but someone thought it would be funny to... well...&quot; She trailed off, biting her lip.<br><br>&quot;<i>What is going on?</i>&quot;<br><br>She reached up and flipped open a circular window covering to reveal an endless plain of gray-blue waves. Des stared at the ocean, a nasty feeling forming in the pit of his stomach.<br><br>He&#39;d been shipped.<br><br></p>

            <p>Either your resources or the quality of your summoned creatures may be a little lacking. A true dark wizard is capable of shaping forms for his selected ones from the very earth, or the living matter surrounding the site of the dread beings&#39; entry upon the world! Or at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard from those who&#39;ve managed it. I&#39;ve been thinking about trying, but I can never find the right equipment to isolate a single extraplanar entity, and they get a little grumpy when they need to share a body. It&#39;s best to have proper preparations in place before trying that sort of thing, you know. Nobody wants an unscheduled apocalypse.</p>

            <p>Because what I and my Fell Brothers working with involves an <i>extremely</i> protracted blood sacrifice and about a month of solid chanting. The coterie&#39;s got to do it in shifts and I&#39;m on my <i>twelfth</i>, by the Unspeakable One! We ran a few tests using the usual derelicts and it transpires that neither watermelon nor the sedatives affect the outcome of minor versions of this ritual; it just meant the bonds were slightly less stable than we&#39;d have preferred.

You&#39;re just...not quite caffeinated enough for me right now, you know? It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s just--I&#39;m in my last year of high school, and the Bagruyot*, and--well, I just need a bit more caffeine these days, you know? I love you, Orange. It&#39;s just that my lifestyle is changing, and, well...you don&#39;t quite fit into it anymore.&quot;<br><br>The box of Orange Pekoe tea managed to convey a sniffle. Desdendelle patted it again.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll call you, yeah? Maybe we can still get together on weekends...&quot;<br><br><i>Don&#39;t touch me!</i><br><br><b>Present day:</b><br><br>&quot;You&#39;re the only tea for me, Earl Grey,&quot; Desdendelle said happily, smiling sweetly at his teacup--or rather, at its contents.<br><br>Steam wafted fondly towards him. <i>Keep talkin&#39;, luv...</i><br><br>The soldier--he was now in the army--took a sip before he complied. &quot;You&#39;re wonderful. So caffeinated...you get me up the morning, and cuddle with me at night--&quot;<br><br><i>Traitor!</i> sobbed the half-empty box of Orange Pekoe. <i>You once told me that I was your one and only!</i><br><br><i>Well, this is awkward, innit...</i> Earl Grey murmured. <i>Hm...Orangey, howsabout you join us?</i><br><br>&quot;What?&quot; Desdendelle said, and <i>What?</i> Orange Pekoe demanded.<br><br><i>Come join us. Two teas&#39;re better than one, Des luv, you know that...</i><br><br>Desdendelle looked at the Orange Pekoe for a long moment, before he nodded. &quot;That sounds...wonderful.

Point is, the Bagruyot are a test that Israelis take at the end of high school. They&#39;re apparently difficult, and resemble the SATs. At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve gathered. Anyone who&#39;s taken them can feel free to correct me or provide more detail...<br><br>--<br><br>I&#39;d like to disclaim that I don&#39;t know anything about Desdendelle&#39;s preference--or lack thereof--for Orange Pekoe tea. Nor do I mean to suggest that Orange Pekoe tea goes well mixed with Earl Grey. I don&#39;t even claim to know what Orange Pekoe tea tastes like...but I do claim the knowledge that Des likes Earl Grey tea! /runs away/<br><br>(And yes, I had to. Did anyone do this last year?

Now you&#39;re all cute and moe!” Sergio was saying.<br>“B-b-but I don&#39;t w-wan&#39;t to wear this!” Firemagic answered.<br>“He&#39;s right, you know,” Des commented from the bed he sat on.<br>Sergio turned to look at the messy-haired teenager. His face brightened and he ran out of the room.<br>Des turned to Firemagic with a questioning look, and she shrugged.<br>While he was looking at her and wondering how Sergio made her hair that straight, he felt something descending on his head, and everything went black. When he woke up, he found himself sitting next to Firemagic. Looking down, he saw he was wearing a similar costume to Firemagic&#39;s -- a black skirt, a white shirt with puffy sleeves and a red tie. He even had purple ribbons glued to his head.<br>“Now you&#39;re both mine!” said Sergio, who towered over the sitting pair. “MINE! BWAHAHA!” </p>

            <p>If so... Deshomeh!<br><br>=PAUSE O MEN FOR THE VIRGIN=<br><br>The creaking noise from upstairs was beginning to get on the clown&#39;s nerves.<br><br>Why had she introduced them? Well, she knew the answer; they were both alone and lonely, both adrift in a universe that didn&#39;t really care for its inhabitants all that much, and her self-imposed mission was to spread joy and laughter among her friends. She wasn&#39;t entirely certain <i>what</i> she&#39;d made the two upstairs spread, but she could make a decent guess. The creaking was only getting worse.<br><br>Their courtship was something of a whirlwind romance, in that there had been loud noises and a staggering amount of property damage. Each of the pair had taken an almost instant dislike to the other that matured into mutual, staggeringly powerful hatred as time wore on. Hate, of course, is just love with a goatee glued on, so the clown didn&#39;t think it was surprising that they were now making, ahem... creaking noises. Damn her if they weren&#39;t grating on the ears, though.<br><br>Eventually, the clown admitted defeat and switched on her stereo. Deafening circus music expelled the creaking noises from her brain and she relaxed into a state of bliss. Upstairs, the pair began to match their pace with the disembodied oompah band.<br><br>Several hours later, the two looked each other in the eye.<br><br>&quot;D&#39;you think we ought to tone it down a bit?&quot; asked Neshomeh.<br><br>&quot;Nah,&quot; said Desdenelle, &quot;this is revenge for the last time Sergio came over. I can still hear the squeaking from those balloons.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, yeah, that... happened.&quot; Neshomeh shuddered. &quot;Ready for round,&quot; she glanced at the chart on the wall, &quot;tilt?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aw, we broke the counter again. That does explain why I could smell smoke about an hour ago.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I thought it was you trying to use the microwave again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I - that <i>thing</i> is not a microwave. It is a portal into Hell. Shaped like a microwave.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, yeah, but it reminds me of home.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Half-succubus-half-angel-half-elf-half-dwarf=half-halfling-half-kitsune-half-dimensional-shambler-half-weasels. Who&#39;d date &#39;em?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Halfwits.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Touchй.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t mind if I do!&quot;<br><br>The next morning, they found Wobbles cowering in the corner with eighteen pairs of earmuffs and a bucket on her head.</p>

Almost impossible to pull off?&quot; wobblestheclown picked up an infantry unit and pushed it forward, then grinned widely. &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m doing it. <i>Over the top.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Machine guns!&quot; Herr Wozzeck cried. &quot;Vere are my machine guns?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Out of position,&quot; wobblestheclown gloated. &quot;Come on, chaps! Jerry&#39;s on the run!&quot;<br><br>&quot;...&quot; Herr Wozzeck reached out and tipped over his own flag. &quot;The field is yours, English pigdog. Though your uniform is stupid-looking.&quot;<br><br>&quot;At least it&#39;s period appropriate,&quot; wobblestheclown sniffed. &quot;I mean, really? A Prussian helmet? Take it off, Herr, really.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You only noticed the helmet?&quot; Herr Wozzeck stood abruptly, gesturing down at himself. &quot;This is a <i>complete</i>, authentic Prussian uniform.&quot;<br><br>wobblestheclown rose in response. &quot;Authentic to the wrong war! Take it <i>all</i> off!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Only if you do, too!&quot;<br><br>&quot;... yeah, all right.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to keep doing this; three shipfics (counting my own) is more than I usually do. But the idea struck me, and I had to write. Suitably ridiculous? I hope so.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, my fake German accent probably would be that terrible. But hilariously, it&#39;s fun that you got me to wear the most anachronistic uniform possible, and I love that it&#39;s a Prussian uniform. (Fun fact, kiddies: Georg Bьchner wrote the original <i>Woyzeck</i> in 1837. Its association with WWI only came out &#39;cause it was premiered in 1913. Let&#39;s just say that <i>Woyzeck</i> was <i><b>WAY</b></i> ahead of its time, as evidenced by Alban Berg and friends.)<br><br>But yeah, this was hilarious!</p>

            <p>Storme Hawk sat in his lofty eyrie, pondering the currents and winds of the air, when he heard a sound behind him. Not a rustling breeze, or a crack of thunder, or even a shower of rain - this was more of a squeaking grunt, and could best be written as, &quot;Eee?&quot;<br><br>Storme Hawk turned to see a furry... thing. It was about waist-high, and looked like nothing more than a feathered teddy-bear. &quot;What,&quot; he said, then had to start over. &quot;What are <i>you</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eee,&quot; the feathered bear said firmly, pointing at Storme Hawk.<br><br>&quot;... me?&quot; Storme Hawk shook his head. &quot;You&#39;re certainly not me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Eee</i>,&quot; the creature insisted. It pointed at Storme Hawk again, then held out a hand (paw?), palm down, and slowly lowered it.<br><br>&quot;... <i>mini</i> me?&quot; Storme Hawk studied the creature dubiously. It certainly didn&#39;t look like him. Okay, there was something around the ears, and maybe the colour of its eyes - and, of course, the feathers - but overall, it wasn&#39;t much of a copy.<br><br>&quot;Eee! Eee.&quot; The creature was getting restless. Storme Hawk shrugged. No harm could come from humouring it, surely?<br><br>&quot;All right... mini me. What brings you here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eee! Eee eee, eee <i>eee</i>. Eee?&quot; This time, the creature&#39;s gestures were unambiguous, and even more unprintable than gestures normally are. Storme Hawk swallowed hard.<br><br>&quot;Really? But you&#39;re a... whatever you are, and I&#39;m-&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Eee</i>.&quot; Never before had so much emotion been poured into a single squeak.<br><br>&quot;... oh, all right, then.&quot; Storme Hawk stood up and led the way to the bedroom. &quot;What harm can come from this, after all?&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>It&#39;s just that the Agents have to wait until they get to a significant breach of Canon. Some agents find the first major breach; others wait for one that&#39;s better for their purposes. For example, Agents Nume and Ilraen and Nurse Robinson waited until their Sue in &quot;Blood Raining Night&quot; tried to give birth to God to charge her, despite the entire fic being a trainwreck of a Canon breach. In contrast, my Agents usually wait for the first major breach of Canon to charge the Sue because usually by then the fic is just too annoying for their mental health to continue (or, in case of a recent mission, triggered one of the Agents so they kinda have to get out there as soon as possible).<br><br>If there&#39;s an OC without enough charges to justify a killing, usually they&#39;re recruited into the PPC or dropped off into another continua with their mind wiped. Frequently, bit characters that are generic enough assimilate back into Canon.</p>

            <p>&quot;Blood Raining Night&quot; is a megacrossover, and it&#39;s not set in any of the canons it mentions as far as I can tell. I treated it as an independent reality sustained only by the will of its Mary Sue, which is why the whole thing collapsed at the end. A canon breach as such isn&#39;t really possible under those circumstances. The best you can get is a violation of the story&#39;s own internal logic, but BRN set the logic bar so low it took a <i>lot</i> to reach the equivalent of a canon breach. Basing your existence on an unstable paradox whilst blatantly failing to understand how pregnancy works <i>and</i> claiming you&#39;re so awesome that you&#39;re the mother of God fit the bill.<br><br>Also, the Sue was nicely incapacitated and her only friend around was out cold, so it was the best place to strike strategically. Nume and Ilraen generally try to isolate their target as much as possible, since it makes the job less dangerous—this is one reason they waited as long as they did in &quot;Ring Child,&quot; too. Even with Suicide and Diocletian as backup, they couldn&#39;t have taken Archir the Emerald down while he was protected by the entire Fellowship of the Ring.<br><br>And finally, the main reason my agents strike when they do is that I choose the point I think will make the best story. The point where the agents do the Duty is the climax of the story, so it should be the biggest thing that&#39;s happened so far, and it should tie together whatever themes or arcs are present. Reicheru giving birth to God is far and away the most ridiculous, over-the-top, arrogant thing I&#39;ve ever seen in <i>any</i> fanfic, so it had to be the kill point, even though I could have reasonably chosen an earlier point, such as Kagome&#39;s torture or the &quot;aborition.&quot; Both of those things were made so much worse by how the story neglected them afterward, though; stopping at either of them wouldn&#39;t have done them justice.<br><br>I basically agree with what you said, though. There has to come a point where you can make the case that the canon/internal logic is officially ruined, and the charges you&#39;ve gathered up to that point must be enough to support the case, whatever they number.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hello all. I&#39;ve just found the PPC less than a week ago through TVTropes, and I love it already. As such, attempting to join the boards seemed like a decent idea.<br>I have read the Constitution, Original Series, the FAQs, and a handful of those other little guides on the wiki. My fandoms include, but are not limited to: Castle, Disney, Valve Games, Avatar (the non-blue cat one), Disney, Star Wars, Tabletop Games, Legos, Disney, Criminal Minds, and My Little Pony.<br>So, now that introductions have been squared away, I have just one question: what&#39;s next? As far as I gathered from all those guides, what I do next pretty much amounts to bumming around on the boards. So, am I mistaken, or should I just start mucking about around here?</p>

            <p>I share most of your listed fandoms! Yay! (Except Castle and Criminal Minds, but they sound cool.) I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m allowed to give gifts per se, so you can have this Nelson Mandela quote:<br><br>&quot;If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.

            <p>Hi, have some fudge!<br><br>Good to see another tabletop gamer, do you have a favorite system?  I started with 1st edition AD&amp;D, finally quit that system with 3.5.  These days almost all my regular gaming is with Hero System, but I&#39;ve played a lot of other systems at conventions.</p>

            <p>Glad to see some other people still like to play old school. Personally, I like the system Legend Quest, but I haven&#39;t actually been able to play anything else. My dad wrote the system, so he doesn&#39;t exactly appreciate me bringing up the other games.</p>

            <p>Feel free to bum around as much as you like, I promise we won&#39;t bite :) I&#39;m still pretty green myself since I&#39;ve yet to claim and-or spork a fic (though I do have one in mind but I want to take my time). <br><br>Personally I think it wouldn&#39;t hurt to lurk around the wiki some more--familiarize yourself with the smaller (and funnier) details in the PPC lore before and if you decide you want to create your own agents and go sporking. <br><br>(The Things I am Not Allowed to do in The PPC in particular is a perfect comedic gold mine.

            <p>Well, first you need to collect your gifts as a new boarder! They are crucial to your success on your missions!<br><br>*Dumps a mixing bowl, a bar of bleepolate, and a tangled skein of yarn on you.*<br><br>Second: I&#39;ve been bumming around the board for well over a year now without bothering to get permission, but reading/helping to grammar pick missions is always a good step in the vague getting permission. So is writing in one of the event threads when they come up, knocking around reading other missions, and finding goodfic. (Finding badfic is also good, but mostly people like to be able to pick and choose some of the most amusing samples of badfic, and let&#39;s face it, we don&#39;t see enough goodfic when we only focus on that.)</p>

            <p>I saw it with a friend a while back and for a Disney movie...I&#39;m kinda impressed. <br><br>I really liked the two female leads in this film. Yeah they&#39;re pretty conventional to the Disney Princess archetype in terms of aesthetics and beauty buuuut--that&#39;s pretty much it. They&#39;re arguably the most alive female leads that I&#39;ve ever seen in a Disney film. Their mannerisms, the way they move speak and act and grow as the story progresses...they felt genuine to me. <br><br>I&#39;m not going to say that Frozen was a perfect Disney movie but it took me by surprise. I just wrote it off as Tangled with ice and more humor and it turned out to be the near complete opposite. I&#39;m not going to spoil anyone who hasn&#39;t seen the movie but as far as fairy tales go, I think Frozen was a genuine step in the right direction of where Disney needs to take its princess tales for the 21st century.<br><br>What say you guys? </p>

            <p>I myself was feeling sort of indifferent about the movie, especially since my little brothers had seen it first, and they are AWFUL about revealing spoilers. (&quot;Hey! Hey! You want to know about Marshmallow? The reveal at the end is totally awesome! It caught all of us by surprise! It&#39;s awesome!&quot; Etcetera.) <br><br>But yes, the movie is totally awesome.

            <p>Admittedly it had problems, but overall I thought it was good. Most of the songs were catchy and neat, the animation was gorgeous, and I really like how the climax turned out. There&#39;s also the fact that Elsa is a Disney heroine with major mental disabilities like depression and anxiety, which is freaking awesome because representation.</p>

            <p>And now I have an excellent mental image of the Duke of Weselton playing with plastic dinosaurs. Olaf would also be there, but the poor guy doesn&#39;t really have the waist articulation to bend down and move toys around the floor. </p>

            <p>I thought that Elsa was going evil. I don&#39;t mean that as a bad thing, and in fact when I was watching I thought something along the lines of &quot;Wow. This is probably the most well-structured and natural descent into villainy that I&#39;ve ever seen in a movie.&quot; I knew that if she did, it wouldn&#39;t be permanent, both due to Disney law and the culmination of her character arc, but I&#39;m still convinced that if she hadn&#39;t hit Anna in the heart and nearly killed her, Elsa would&#39;ve at least temporarily turned evil. All the steps she took getting to that point, from the personal tragedies, to her sudden decision to not only accept but embrace what makes her unique after a life of repressing herself out of fear, to the path that had been set up for her and she had reluctantly prepared for all her life seemingly crashing down, to her decision to discard her old life and build herself a new identity, all has the makings of a really good villain origin story. It could also be backstory for a future protagonist, but we already had protagonists in Anna and Kristoff. (Maybe Elsa will be the central character in the now-pretty-much-inevitable sequel. That should be fun.)<br>It was due to Anna&#39;s idealism, Elsa&#39;s still-intact feelings toward her sister, and an unexpected revelation coupled with the onrush of a second psychological break that made Elsa realize how dangerous she was, and that was a turning point in her character. It also could very easily not have happened.<br><br>Elsa was already experiencing some self-denial, claiming that the cold had never bothered her when in fact, the cold, in the form of her powers, was originally the source of many of her problems. To break that down, she willingly discards and avoids considering important information about her past to become more free from her old troubles in the future. There&#39;s a slow but final motion from something like that to making decisions that your older self might not have approved of. Evil&#39;s not just a switch; there&#39;s not just one event that&#39;ll suddenly set someone off. It creeps up on you, and you don&#39;t notice that you&#39;ve suddenly gone against the ideals and morals of others because you&#39;ve come to believe in something new. They say it&#39;s wrong? Maybe they see it that way, but they&#39;re also the same people who were giving you problems in the past, right? If it hadn&#39;t been for them, you&#39;d be as happy as you are now back then. They made you live in fear, and you know that <i>that&#39;s</i> wrong. So, no, you&#39;re not wrong. <i>They&#39;re</i> wrong. And suddenly, you have a hard time turning back.<br><br>Plus, just listen to those lyrics. Like, actually listen to them. &quot;My power flurries through the air into the ground&quot;? &quot;I am one with the wind and sky&quot;? &quot;No right, no wrong, no rules for me&quot;? That is straight-up unimpeachable villainous posturing.</p>

            <p>In fact, one could argue that Elsa is a villain who is redeemed, because she freezes Arendelle and runs away, and is so against fixing it that she freezes her sister&#39;s heart. Like I said, she is redeemed in the end, but one could argue she was villainous.<br><br>But nobody will, because all her actions make sense. She told to hide her power, so she runs away where she can hide. She&#39;s afraid of her powers to the point of believing she can&#39;t control them, and her fear of herself is misdirected at the world. It&#39;s important to note that it wasn&#39;t a specific targeted blast that froze Anna&#39;s heart, more of an icy wave directed outwards that happened to hit Anna.<br><br>So if, say, Elsa ran further when she realized what she&#39;d done, would it have been villainous to leave the kingdom to freeze, or could it be justified the same way as her other actions? What is the event horizon? Is it actions or is it feelings? Because I don&#39;t know if her bitterness wouldn&#39;t have consumed her - when Anna tells her that Arendelle&#39;s in snow, the villainous thing to do would be to act indifferent. That would&#39;ve been the point where her change became clear. But it didn&#39;t - cue amazing musical number. When actually faced with her actions, she couldn&#39;t act like her past didn&#39;t matter. I like to think she would have had the same reaction even if she had more time to decide everyone else was wrong, but I don&#39;t know. Maybe if Anna hadn&#39;t gotten there when she did...<br><br>I didn&#39;t really get a &quot;villainous posturing&quot; vibe off those lines, except for &quot;no right no wrong no rules for me&quot;. (You could also argue &quot;I&#39;ll rise like the break of dawn&quot;.)She&#39;s exalted at being able to express the side of herself she&#39;d had to hide, and since she was showing off powerful elemental magic of course she feels in touch with nature. In the line &quot;I am one with the wind and sky&quot;, it&#39;s about acceptance, feeling like she belongs. This is emphasized in the Spanish translation (which I have been listening to as well), where the line is &quot;El viento me abrazarб&quot;. That translates to &quot;the wind will embrace me&quot;. (Note that I don&#39;t actually speak Spanish, I took a few years in school and found this translation on Tumblr. I really like the Spanish translation in general - &quot;Conceal don&#39;t feel don&#39;t let them know/well now they know&quot; is roughly &quot;You must not open up your heart/well I opened it&quot;.)<br><br>Sorry, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time thinking about this. Specifically, falling in love with Loki made me think about what villainy means, and my sister and I are learning the First Time in Forever reprise, and I&#39;m singing Elsa.<br><br>Oh, and I hope there&#39;s a good sequel. Although I don&#39;t think Disney will do the story I want. That story being an idea I saw on Tumblr involving a fire queen and a romance. With said fire queen. To quote Olaf - &quot;The hot and cold are both so intense, put them together it just makes sense!&quot; Although in my headcanon the fire queen melts Olaf because he annoys her. In general she and Elsa hate each other at first, but in the process of fighting some sort of mutual problem have to put their differences aside and learn to respect each other. If I could come up with a more coherent plot than that I&#39;d write it and submit it to Disney.</p>

She didn&#39;t even know she&#39;d frozen Arendelle until Anna came and told her. And she&#39;s not against fixing it - she just has absolutely no idea how. The freezing of Anna&#39;s heart is accidental, when she&#39;s become so full of emotional turmoil from thinking that, and I quote:<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m such a fool, I can&#39;t be free!<br>No escape from the storm inside of me!&quot;<br><br>And up until the end of the reprise she&#39;s begging Anna to leave, because it&#39;s not safe for her. The freezing is completely accidental, an involuntary explosion in every direction due to Elsa&#39;s emotional stress.<br><br><br><br>Also, that thing with the fire queen is such a good idea, I hope it happens. Especially if they take the Tumblrian idea of having her be a hijab-wearing queen names Noor.</p>

            <p>The animation was great, although some people like to nitpick a moment with Elsa&#39;s hair.

            <p>The best part, I think, was the &#39;act of true love&#39;. I groaned when ******* decided that meant a true love&#39;s kiss, and was more than pleasantly surprised at the actual act.

            <p>And there were no mentions of Arendelle at all. Everything seems to be set up in similar ways, but with several distinct differences in the way the two worlds operated. The latter might be due in part to the change in tone between the two movies, but I didn&#39;t see any hints that they were set in the same universe. Also, I&#39;m not sure what establishing that would&#39;ve done to serve the plot. One of the many things I enjoyed about Frozen was that pretty much everything that was brought up had a place in the story at some time or other, and that tightness of narrative might have been compromised if there were diversions from the story to connect it to another movie.<br><br>Not that I&#39;m saying I&#39;m opposed to it, mind you. Heck, if the two stories did take place in one universe, we can have a crossover sequel between those two, and maybe some other recent Disney animated movie added in for good measure and extra plot elements. Avengers-style crossover between a set of structurally similar but up-to-that-point unconnected movies? Count me in. I even came up with an admittedly-incomplete idea of what the impetus for their crossover would be, but I found out in a bit of background research that Flynn didn&#39;t actually have a mysterious between-scenes recovery after getting stabbed in the kidney and depowering the only thing in range that could heal him, and my video store must have given me a DVD that was missing a crucial scene for some inexplicable reason. That fills that plot hole, and restores a little of my good feeling toward Tangled&#39;s storytelling that the skip had made me lose, but it also casts into doubt every DVD that I&#39;ve ever gotten from there. Was there actually an explanation for how Bruce Wayne got back to Gotham from Bane&#39;s prison in the Middle East in the Dark Knight Rises, or the depowered Superman got back from the North Pole in Superman II, and the DVDs just cut those out, too? I guess I&#39;ll never know, or at least never until I watch copies of those movies that I can guarantee are undamaged.<br><br>There goes my planned story featuring Flynn fighting back-to-back with his own Life Model Decoy-equivalent. I&#39;m only half kidding, by the way. My story idea may have been really dumb.</p>

            <p>Because due to the nature of the Slenderblogs, no one is entirely sure which ones are in-canon and why. Still, though, they normally have a set of rules that they follow to keep the story going and working properly, and the Slenderblog known as H(a)unting breaks more or less <i>all</i> of them. The Sue had an Operator symbol carved onto her eye in a car crash and somehow does not feel horrible constant pain from a damaged cornea, the Slender Man is her housemate/bodyguard who talks to her by writing on a chalkboard he wears around his neck, and they team up to fight an &quot;even worse&quot; member of Slender Man&#39;s species known as ///It///. She <i>names</i> the Slender Man&#39;s species, by the way, and the Rake is basically her adorable little pet doggy. I wish I was making this up.</p>

            <p>It started out similar, but sort of grew into its own thing, with a full fictional universe and more-or-less stable rules and such. The problem arose in the fact that the canon is incredibly loose, and there&#39;s not really any central deciding force behind it, so it&#39;s possible that anyone might consider any random connection of Slenderblogs to be canon and for the rest to be wrong, and come up with a rationale for how their picks are all connected. It&#39;s basically a mess.</p>

            <p>What do you guys think about Almost Human?<br><br>Personally, I was very impressed with it. The science is really cool (and for the most part seems plausible), and the cases that they do every week are pretty enthralling.<br><br>I also like the whole foggyness when it comes to Dorian and whether he is a person or not. We know that he&#39;s a machine, but he isn&#39;t treated as <i>just</i> a machine. <br>Does he have a soul? Does he have rights? I hope we get a new season to consider these questions.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure if Global is following Fox in their airing episodes, but I&#39;m watching it on the Canadian network. I&#39;ve missed a few episodes here and there, so, I can&#39;t exactly say if it seems out of order.<br><br>That said, I really enjoy the show.

            <p>It&#39;s unfair that Fox aired the episodes out of order. I really want to see what it&#39;s like in order; people who have done it say it makes everything make sense. As it is, the narration feels choppy because it&#39;s being aired out of order.<br><br>That being said, Dorian is precious and John is just McCoy as a cop and I really hope John/Dorian becomes canon because they honestly seem to care for each other a lot and I like representation. <br><br>The other characters are great, though. I love Rudy. He&#39;s adorable. I want to see what happens if he meets Hermann from Pacific Rim. Like how I want to see what happens if Dorian meets Data from Star Trek.</p>

            <ul>
<li>more ideas about Data and Dorian.<br><br>See, for me it&#39;s hard to decide who&#39;s more human because it&#39;s not just about their personalities and emotions (in which case Dorian is definitely more human) but also about how society treats them, and who their friends are, and what those friendships are like. Dorian is clearly treated as police property, while there&#39;s an entire episode where they explore the question of whether Data is property. Dorian responds to that treatment with some resentment (disliking the term &quot;synthetic&quot;), but so far despite being more emotional he&#39;s less vocal than Data, who corrects people who call him &quot;it&quot; and tells off an officer for challenging his command. This could indicate that Dorian was programmed to be more obedient than Data, whose creator was definitely trying harder to give him free will. However, it is also circumstances - Data&#39;s allowed much more autonomy, and has his superiors on his side, while Dorian can&#39;t really speak up without being seen as malfunctioning.<br><br>Then there&#39;s their friendships. Their human best friends couldn&#39;t be more different - Data was drawn to Geordi because Geordi accepted him and treated him kindly, while Dorian is drawn to John because John&#39;s the reason he got reactivated and he knows that underneath all the gruffness John&#39;s got a good heart. John and Dorian banter and needle each other, while Data and Geordi bond over their similarities. John dislikes his synthetic part and bickers with his synthetic friend, while Geordi likes his synthetic part and is kind to his synthetic friend. In a way, I feel like it would be more interesting to see Geordi and John discuss having android friends, because they have such radically different takes on it.<br><br>Data also has a much larger support system of friends - you kind of get the impression that any of the main characters would defend him. <br><br>I&#39;m planning to write a crossover at some point - not sure if it&#39;s going to be the characters meeting or casting Data and Geordi as Dorian and John (or heck, maybe two different stories.) So I&#39;ve spent a lot of time thinking about this.</li>

            <p>Data would be so jealous of Dorian. Here&#39;s an android who desperately wants to be human, and here&#39;s another android who is almost indistinguishable from humans. Dorian would be very empathetic and explain how Data doesn&#39;t need emotions or reactions, that he&#39;s fine just the way he is.<br><br>I disagree with you on the John/Dorian point, though. <br>While they do care for each other, that is not the only requirement for a romantic relationship, and I don&#39;t think that they are particularly compatible in that sense. A good friendship is not equivalent nor prophetic of a romantic relationship. I have been friends with a guy since I was three, we&#39;ve been going to the same school since we were 6, and now in university we&#39;re housemates. With all of that, we have <i>no</i> romantic interest.<br>I also have a female friend who is in all of my classes and who I&#39;ve been hanging out with for the last year and a half. I have absolutely no romantic interest in her either, even though we&#39;re fairly compatible.<br><br>The tl;df of this is that friendship doesn&#39;t have to lead to romance, in spite of the fact that society tells us that it does.</p>

            <p>in terms of queer representation on TV we are constantly fed the idea that male-identifying characters who are close are just bros whereas heterosexual friendships inevitably end in romantic interest. It would be nice if a drama like this with two male leads had them get together, just like how it was nice that Holmes and Watson in Elementary, who are of different genders, do not and will not get together.<br><br>As it is, all of the indications that John and Dorian care for each other can go both into a friendship or a romance, but if the writers decide to suddenly declare that both are heterosexual, it would be considered queerbaiting, which is harmful to idea of more diversity in this predominantly heteronormative media (cough cough, John and Sherlock in BBC Sherlock).<br><br>And that&#39;s why I hope they make John/Dorian canon. I think they work both as a friendship and a relationship, but it would be a great thing for us queer viewers to see representation for us in the form of John and Dorian expressing romantic/sexual interest in one another. The setting is futuristic, so it conceivably should have more diversity in its interpersonal relationship dynamics. <br><br>Also, while we&#39;re on the topic of representation: Frequently, characters of colour in media aren&#39;t the love interest. To have Dorian be John&#39;s love interest would be another point in terms of representation, since not only would they be main characters in a queer relationship, they would also be an interracial couple and huzzah, queer people of colour who watch this show can find more to identify with in Dorian.<br><br>tl;dr: I know friendships don&#39;t have to lead to romance, but imagine the queer -- especially queer POC -- representation we&#39;d get if it happens.</p>

            <p>This is a very solid starting mission. Your agents have a good rapport and play very well off each other. I especially liked the moment where Rina&#39;s fangirling sets off the CAD. It&#39;s a nice touch.<br><br>The biggest thing that bothered me about your story was the ease with which Rina is set off by the badfic. The pounding her head against things, the shouting, the wailing, the general gnashing of teeth: it&#39;s a kind of hyperbolic rage that seems to be quite common in the PPC. There&#39;s nothing strictly wrong with it, but to me it feels a bit forced, a bit fake. People don&#39;t typically react like that in real life. They groan and moan and facepalm, not bash their skull against a window. However, I can sort of excuse it in this case from a in-story perspective. This is their first mission, after all. Rina and Randa (the characters) are fresh-faced rookies. They haven&#39;t built up all those psyche scars that most veteran agents (should) have.<br><br>The other thing that troubled me was the charge list. It&#39;s a big blocky paragraph that dominates the page and messes up the otherwise pretty good pacing you&#39;d established throughout the mission. It also repeats every problem with the badfic that you&#39;d already shown us. Generalize. For example: &#39;you are charged with three counts of making canon character OOC, one count of creating minis, one count of blah de blah with hur de gur&#39; and so on.<br><br>Look forward to seeing what you do next.</p>

            <p>Huh, I guess the badfic reactions were kind of overblown, or at least I didn&#39;t write them as well as I could have.

            <p>And I was right to be, because this was great. I agree with the people who&#39;ve said it&#39;s very reminiscent of TOS-era PPC; it&#39;s got the same kind of vibe as those stories and it&#39;s laugh-out-loud funny in places.

            <p>This was fun!  It reminded me a lot of the Original Series, with the agents clearly being friends, and getting along . . . most of the time.  And still being willing to chide each other, and keep the other&#39;s more problematic traits from causing difficulties.  (Sort of like the way the Sorting Hat described Ordellya, but with showing instead of telling!)<br><br>You picked a great fanfic for a first mission: short, simple, and with lots and lots of typos that turn hilarious when interpreted literally.  (Actually, my absolute favorite line from the original story was when Sirius was described as having the <i>other</i> black hair.)<br><br>I like that you had Peter pop back into existence upon the Sue&#39;s loss of control over the canon.  His absence from most scenes casts a pretty clear light on the story&#39;s real purpose: not to explore the Marauders&#39; time at Hogwarts, but Ordellya, Ordellya, always Ordellya, <i>only</i> Ordellya.  You helped highlight this as well, by focusing on the canons&#39; OOC reactions to her, and with the scene where they (including the other OC!) stood still and actionless until Ordellya arrived.  (Also, it&#39;s not fair to punish preteen!Peter for his adult, bad guy self&#39;s actions!)<br><br>One charge you included that I feel a bit picky about is that she knew Hogwarts better than the Marauders.  I agree this would be unrealistic for the average, just-got-to-school OC, but in Ordellya&#39;s case, being Dumbledore&#39;s daughter, and apparently being raised on the Hogwarts grounds (actually, does Albus even have a home outside Hogwarts?  Maybe even <i>that</i> would be canon), the Sue probably <i>would</i> have much more familiarity with passages and such than the Maruaders would have after only two school years of exploration.  (I am the son of a high school teacher.  By the time I actually attended that school, I knew the details of teacher&#39;s lounge, the location of the underground staff cafeteria, many administration offices that most students would never see, the storage layout of the textbook store, etc.)<br><br>There are also a couple little typos to fix:<br>&quot;. . . then held up <b>to</b> yo-yo so Rina could smell the string . . .&quot;<br><br>&quot;Rina <b>squng</b> around and jabbed a finger . . .&quot;</p>

Normally, I would say that she would have an advantage over them because she grew up at Hogwarts, but I&#39;m <i>pretty</i> sure that shortcut she used wasn&#39;t canon. She just wanted to show how Speshul she was.<br><br>Hee hee, the other black hair was making me and Randa laugh so hard when we were reading over the story. The way Randa interpreted it was Sirius being bald except for one black hair. I still grin whenever I read that.<br><br>Peter&#39;s absences in Marauder tics makes me so mad, I can&#39;t even tell you. Sure, he was a d*** when he was older, but I really doubt the Marauders would have counted him as a friend if he was like that as a kid. At least in my self-insert Marauders fix, I tried to include Peter and actually had him find a girlfriend before the other guys (not because I think everyone should be paired up, but because I wanted him to have at least a little love before I killed her off).<br><br>And of course nobody goes after Remus except Tonks.

            <p>...is that, well.<br><br>HE WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND. THEY TRUSTED HIM. THEY SUSPECTED <i>REMUS</i> BEFORE HIM--THEY NEVER SUSPECTED PETER AT ALL! AND HE WAS WORKING FOR VOLDEMORT FOR AT LEAST A YEAR BEFORE THE POTTERS WERE KILLED AND SIRIUS WENT AFTER HIM!<br><br>Sorry, it&#39;s an old fandom for me. And this has become one of my buttons for it.<br><br>It&#39;s so easy to vilify Peter. Oh, yes, he&#39;s going to be evil when he grows up, so he must be evil now! Oh, hey, he&#39;s a coward when he&#39;s older (never mind the argument I can make against that, it&#39;s currently irrelevant), he must be the same way when he&#39;s younger! Oh, hey, he&#39;s going to betray them--so they never trusted him in the first place!<br><br>That&#39;s not exactly how betrayal works. That&#39;s not how Peter&#39;s &#39;evilness&#39; works. I <i>know</i> it can be easy to use him as a plot device by making him a Death Eater earlier on--I&#39;ve used it myself--but if you want to stay at all true to what we know of him? That&#39;s not how to do it.<br><br>In addition, there&#39;s this idea that he was stupid. What people tend to forget is that he was hanging around with James, Transfiguration prodigy, Sirius, popular and talented, and Remus, quiet but very smart. If anything, he was average! Not stupid, not talentless--just average! And that&#39;s something that people tend not to realize.<br><br>I don&#39;t at all support what Peter did when he grew up, even if I understand some of it. Young!Peter? I&#39;ll defend him forever.<br><br>I&#39;ve got a fic where (don&#39;t throw rotten tomatoes at me for this) I&#39;ve been trying to do the Fifth Marauder thing relatively realistically (albeit with a slight AU, because there obviously wasn&#39;t a fifth Marauder in canon). It&#39;s undergone a massive reworking--several of them, actually. In the first version, Peter ended up transferring to Beauxbatons at the end of the second year. He just never ended up becoming friends with the others, and decided to leave after getting rather the wrong impression about some of their jokes. (Also, who wants to be the only one of five boys left out of the four-boy friendship?) So he left...and therefore never betrayed Lily and James...and probably lived out his life happily. At some point, I decided to change that, and bring him back in. In the new version (this is such spoilers, actually), he helps them solve a mystery at the end of the first year, whereupon he joins their group. Because it didn&#39;t make sense to me that they&#39;d take him on <i>just</i> because he&#39;d follow them around and praise them (yes, I know, but that doesn&#39;t really make for trust), I figured he must have had something a bit more useful than that...and made him very good at thinking quickly and putting things and plans together. Where&#39;d I get that from? Well, when Sirius went after him, <i>he formulated and executed the plan to frame him pretty much on the spot</i>. It&#39;s possible he thought it out ahead of time, but...he couldn&#39;t have been sure. So, logically, that&#39;s one of his skills...and, as I said before, he&#39;s not stupid. He&#39;s just an average kid, who happens to hang out with a group of somewhat exceptionally talented kids. That&#39;s all.<br><br>But yeah, to sum up: bashing young!Peter is something that people find very easy to do when they haven&#39;t thought very hard about him, and I&#39;ve even done it myself; however, he doesn&#39;t deserve that, and it&#39;s not accurate. So any fanfic bashing young!Peter is probably going to get me ranting.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I myself have a fifth Marauder series planned out, all the way up to how that would alter Harry&#39;s years at school. My OC is a distant cousin of Professor Trelawney and she has brief visions of the future, but they&#39;re always vague and I make sure to keep the visions so that the scene she sees will happen in both her universe and the canon one. Basically, there&#39;s a point where (SPOILERS) the OC keeps seeing visions and getting this feeling that she &#39;chose the wrong path&#39; and eventually goes back in time and takes away her baby self&#39;s magic and causes the timeline to snap back to canon. The AU continues in a &#39;what if&#39; where she doesn&#39;t do that, and THAT is when Harry&#39;s time gets changed.<br><br>*ahem*<br><br>Sorry about that, but there is a point to it- even when I was first getting started on that series and was a Suethor, I still don&#39;t think I was as bad as I could have been. Yeah, if I were to rewrite it, it would almost certainly be better, but I keep it as it is to remind myself how far I&#39;ve come. But even back then, I tried to keep Peter as a part of the group. And honestly, though I absolutely hate his older self, if I were to see young!Peter, I&#39;d probably give him a hug and tell him he is a good person. I legitimately cried in Deathly Hallows when he was about to save Harry&#39;s life and was then strangled by his own magic hand. <br><br>Either way, although Peter was probably very average as a student, I really doubt James and Sirius would let him be a part of their group if he didn&#39;t have something good to his name. (Yeah, according to Pottermore, it was Remus who initially was responsible for James and Sirius to include Peter, but that would probably last for only so long.)<br><br>I once wrote a fluff fic for Peter in retaliation for all the young!Peter hate I&#39;d seen going around. It was actually very cathartic.</p>

            <p>I disagree on anyone knowing the school better than the Marauders. After all, they had their map. Since the magic used to make the map is never fully explained, we can only guess that it actually does show every passage in the school.</p>

            <p>In PoA, Chapter 18, Remus tells that James, Sirius and Peter became Animagi in their fifth year, and then: &quot;<i>Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. (...) I doubt whether any Hogwarts student ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did ...  And thats how we came to write the Marauders’s Map, and sign it with our nicknames.</i>&quot;<br><br>Also, we know that the Map doesn’t show the Room of Requirement and that Draco vanished from the Map whenever he entered this room in HBP. The Map’s magic, showing everybody who is in a place the Map &quot;knows&quot;, is awesome, but the Map doesn’t show every room and passage that exists. The Marauders didn’t know the castle better than everybody else because they had the Map to show them everyhing, they knew the castle better than everybody else because they explored nearly everything and wrote it on their Map (but they never needed and thus never found the Room of Requirement).<br><br>Since the Marauder’s Map still didn’t exist during the Marauder’s third year, and much of the exploration happened only later, it is entirely possible that a child who grew up at Hogwarts knew a secret passage they still didn’t know, and since I’m quite sure that <b>we</b> have never seen all secret passages, it doesn’t matter that this specific passage isn’t canon.<br><br>Don’t get this wrong. I really like your first mission. I’m only saying that I might like it even more if there were an in-mission discussion of the possibility that the Sue coincidentally got something right when she tried to show off and upstage the Marauders, but then messed it up when she thought she could use a misspelled greek spell to access her secret passage.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Hello there everybody my name is y2k890. I found the PPC a few years ago through Tv Tropes and Cupcakes (Yes, it was one of the first MLP fanfics I read.) however, It&#39;s only now that I&#39;ve decided to take part in the discussion. <br>I have read the constitution, the FAQ, a few missions in the MLP canon, and I&#39;m starting to read the original series. <br>The various things that I&#39;m a fan of include Megaman, Sonic, Mario, Nintendo in general, Power Rangers, Super Sentai (AKA the source footage for Power Rangers.), Kamen Rider, My Little Pony, and Doctor Who.</p>

            <p>So, thanks to my morbid curiosity I decided to look for more MLP but this time using &quot;pinkiepie&quot; (sic). What I came across was a poorly written crossover between MLP and LotR by the name of Burning Ponies. Skimming over the chapters &amp; knowing exactly how improbable the crossover is, the story seemed to be almost as bad as legolas by laura. It was at this point that I decided to look at all the other works by the author and their other fics are even more improbable crossovers. There is one with The Legend of Zelda, one with Portal, and one with Doctor Who. I&#39;m linking their fanfiction page here so everyone can see for themselves.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4150204/Archsteel"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4150204/Archsteel">https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4150204/Archsteel</a></a></p>

            <p>...Thought you ought to know.<br><br>In case this was not obvious, this author is such a troll. I just took one look at the descriptions of most of the stories, and read the first page of the MLP one, and I am beyond positive that this is a troll. The plots are so ridiculous, so insane, so obviously made to piss people off, that I just start laughing. Honestly, it&#39;s kinda adorable, and I will definitely continue to read once I have more time. <br><br>The orcs terrorising Ponyville are hilarious, by the way. All they want are h-o-r-s-e-s! Not even kidding, for some reason a goblin desides to spell out horse to his commander. And then they eat the ponies. There was SO MUCH BLOOD. I mean, papercuts are bad enough, but there was way more blood here!<br><br>…TROOOOOOOOLL!!!!!</p>

            <p>What is up with this popular fad that seems to love making blood-and-guts squickfests out of things like MLP:FIM?  I get that some people don&#39;t like a lot cutesy girly things, but giving it gratuitous violence and bloodshed is an appallingly cheap and unpleasant method of writing.  </p>

            <p>Namely, &quot;Nothing is sacred&quot; and &quot;The more beautiful and pure a thing is, the more satisfying it is to corrupt it&quot;, respectively. The so-called Rules of the Internet should have been forgotten about long ago, not least because most of them are dumb jokes, nonsense, or sexist, because they were created by 4Chan, but the Internet likes them anyway for whatever reason. It&#39;s gotten supremely attached to a handful, those two included, to the point that most people have forgotten where they came from.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s assume, for a moment, that the author has never heard of these laws. What then is the motivation? I have found a few, some serious, some not as much. What the heck, I&#39;m supposed to be sleeping, but I&#39;ll take some time to explore why people write gory or disturbing MLP fanfiction.<br><br>First, and probably formost, is contrast. The land of Equestria is a bright, happy land, where multi-colored ponies can sing and dance with relative peace. Sure, you may run into some jerks, some hazards, and even a few monsters, but on the whole, it&#39;s a happy place. So, how better to add some contrast to your story then to add some morally disturbing actions to this land of joy? While this sounds to some like a horrfic idea, and is the reason we can&#39;t have nice things, to others, this is fascinating. The ones that do it right explore how thse acts of horror effect such a joyus place, and look to use that contrast to drive home greater points. Take, for example, Fallout Equestria, one of my favorite fanfictions of all time. It is a bloody, gory fic, and does not hold back. It is in total and complete contrast to the Equestria we know and love, and kkat uses that to explore friendship and morality in a much more powerful way then arguably even the show could. Done wrong, and you have stories that use it as a cheap way to illicit a reaction.<br><br>Another reason is for shock value. This is closely related to the wrong way of using contrast to tell a dark MLP fic, but different in a distinct way. While the guy who&#39;s doing it wrong for contrast is at least still trying to add credibility to the story as a piece of literature, the shock value motivation is always just for quick, cheap reactions. Done right, it can make you feel like it was terrifying or disgusting, yet odly fitting or creepy in a good way. Done wrong, and you get Cupcakes. Not eerie, not disterbing in a horrifyingly fitting way, just torture porn for no reason other then to make unsuspecting readers squirm.<br><br>Speaking of Cupcakes, another reason people write squik fic: Cupcakes&#39; success. As parodied in RatherHomely&#39;s fic &#39;Terrible and Horrible Stories,&#39; (I think, I may have gotten the fic name wrong) people write these fics in responce to the popularity of Cupcakes and related stories. Sweet Apple Massacre, Pattycake (Pretty sure I spelled that wrong. Do not care at all), Rainbow Factory, you know the type. These stories try to take some of that popularity away from Cupcakes or the like, by making it just that much worse. Some try by copying Cupcakes exactly, some try to make Sweet Apple Massacre look tame. It is here we find the worst of the worst, the stuff that makes you want to give up all faith in the fandom and just go home. No matter how well written, this stuff is always bad, no exceptions. It is gore and sex for the sake of attention and infamy, and quite frankly, I don&#39;t have to put up with it.<br><br>So, that&#39;s all of the reasons I could think of for why people would write this kind of MLP: FiM fic. I&#39;m sure there are more, but I think they all boil down into one of these three categories at the core. I know I focused on gore rather then disturbing sex, but for that, I have to remember that YKINMK, and just not read. Then again, if it&#39;s in 120 Days of Blueblood, it is wrong and should not be allowed.</p>

            <p>...that you might be picking this story for reasons not entirely in the spirit of the PPC. Your entry on the Claimed Fic page (<i>&#39;because I&#39;m probably the only person here with a strong enough stomach for this&#39;</i>) set off warning bells in my head.<br><br>We&#39;re not about rectifying perceived wrongs or crusading against that which we find distasteful. Nor are we about subjecting ourselves to the worst stories out there in some sort of self-imposed test of mental fortitude.

            <p>What I&#39;ll say is this: me PPCing the fic is not about me finding the subject matter ugly, nor is it about some kind of badfic tolerance dick-swinging contest. This fic deserves our treatment because this fic deserves to die, and I think I&#39;ve adequately proved that I can dredge comedy out of horrible, awful fics.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read my first mission. If not, please do, I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on it. If so, please keep in mind that it was for a fic that involved, er... let&#39;s say it involved things happening to children that should not ever happen and leave it at that. I milked a lot of comedy out of it by focusing on the interaction between my agents rather than the more noisome elements of the subject matter, and for this fic I&#39;d take much the same approach.<br><br>It also makes sense for my agents to be given this fic as a mission; Wobbles is unremittingly cheerful (arguably to the point of genuine psychosis) and the Notary might well die, which despite the PPC&#39;s chronic staffing problems is probably something the Marquis de Sod would consider a positive outcome. Also, not only am I familiar enough with Friendship is Magic to snark this piece of... <i>work</i> with the accuracy and flair required of a PPC fic, I&#39;ve also read 120 Days of Sodom, the themes of which the badfic nabs for its own vile purposes.<br><br>In short, I do think I can squeeze humour out of this fic, because despite being a neophyte in excelsis here at PPC Towers, I&#39;ve got <i>form</i>. Your concerns are entirely valid, though. It will likely be a lot of hard work to do a PPC-ing of this fic to the standard we&#39;re used to.<br><br>I just think it needs to be done.</p>

            <p>That right there? That kind of sentiment is the thing that concerns me. I don&#39;t like when people equate sporking with murder or death. It&#39;s unseemly and tasteless. It conveys a sense of mean-spiritedness I don&#39;t like to associate with the PPC.<br><br>People shouldn&#39;t write a mission because &quot;it needs to be done.&quot; We&#39;re not fanfiction vigilantes out for some sort of internet justice.<br><br>That being said, you seem like you&#39;ve got credentials to back up what you say, at least in terms of canonical knowledge.

            <p>There&#39;s a British children&#39;s television show called Rastamouse. It concerns small knitted mice who solve mysteries and listen to a lot of reggae. It&#39;s brilliant, if a bit on the odd side. The reason I bring it up is that the show&#39;s big message is &quot;make a bad thing good&quot;: i.e. take something that&#39;s wrong or unfair or ghastly and make people&#39;s lives a bit better because of it.<br><br>That&#39;s what I mean when I say something needs to be sporked by us. I consider it to apply the strongest when dealing with fics like 120 Days of Blueblood precisely <i>because</i> of its subject matter: it is a bad thing we need to make good. That&#39;s what the PPC is to me, and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve claimed this mission.<br><br>I realise I didn&#39;t make this clear when I first responded, for which I apologise. Hopefully this clears it up. I still think this fic deserves to be sporked (I mean, I wouldn&#39;t be doing the mission otherwise), but I agree with you on my saying it needed to die. While I still think it <i>does</i>, because... well, because it&#39;s a novel by de Sade with the themes transposed to something designed for small children, I accept that it is not the sort of thing that should come across in a PPC mission. You have my word that it will not.<br><br>Instead, a clown and a singularly obnoxious Time Lady will bicker with each other and try not to look at all the gore.

            <p>I love his riffs, and have re-read many of them several times. He&#39;s a braver soul then I, let me tell you... My Little Unicorn is proving to be too much, even when I had time to write! All I can say is, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s mostly recovered.<br><br>Anyway, since it seems I neglected yo introduce you to the board previously, I shall do so now. Hello! Welcome to our little board! Leave your sanity at the door and enjoy your stay.<br><br>As you are a brony, I shall give you my usual MLP gift: a crystal statue of your favorite character from the show! However, this statue is special, as it is enchanted with some of the character&#39;s personality. For example, Futtershy makes you feel nicer and more inclined to help people, Pinkie Pie makes you happier and want to make others smile, ect. Just be warned, shadow pony kings may try to take your statue because CRYSSSSSTAAALS!<br><br>PS. I read your message to me on fimfiction (I&#39;m Printworthy, just so you know) and it got me thinking. I really need to do more with that thing. Review some fic, join some groups, something! Anyway, I can&#39;t get on fimfiction right now, so I&#39;ll just answer your question here. <br><br>The basic answer is, he&#39;s from an AU. The more complicated answer can be found just a little further down the board, actually. Just go down to where me, hS, Outhra and a few others derail some poor newbie&#39;s intro thread and talk about Printworthy and how his backstory works now. I would post a link, but I&#39;m on a kindle touch, making that impossable. If you want an in-character responce, I&#39;ll be writing a story about that soon. And by &#39;soon,&#39; I mean &#39;as soon as I have some bloody time to write.&#39;<br><br>PPS. Since we&#39;re talking about Printworthy, did you read my mission? If so, what did you think?</p>

            <p>It just happened durring the time skip, that&#39;s all. That was part of what Printworthy was reffering to with his line, &quot;It is our duty to clean up these messes.&quot; I was going to write out the destruction of Griffala, but desided that I had spent long enough in this mission, and it was just better to skip ahead and wrap it up.<br><br>If you must know what happened, Printworthy set fire to the land of Griffala with a lighter from HQ. As it burned, the land faded into a strange shifting plane that could only be described by the words, &quot;Here be Griffons.&quot; There was more description then that originally, but once I cut it, I only kept the basic summary in my head.

            <p>Using links from a Kindle isn&#39;t that bad. You just need to copy the URL by holding on one spot long enough for two word-selection pentagons to come up, and then moving them to surround the text you want, in this case within the navigation bar. After that it&#39;s simple copy and paste, as long as you remember the HTML code for link-making.

            <p>Still don&#39;t like the system of copying things though. Besides, you&#39;re probably thinking about the kindle fire. I&#39;m dealing with the touch, which is much more annoying.

            <p>I found a fic that is bad- I mean, it is bad. It involves not one, not two, but <i>three</i> alicorn OCs: one is the lost princess of another kingdom who is adopted by Celestia, one is the daughter of Luna, and one is the prince of another kingdom, one that lies beyond the land of the griffons. Obviously, they&#39;re all Sues and Stus, but the writing is absolutely horrendous and the two princesses become so OOC I&#39;m fairly sure they&#39;re replacements after a while.<br><br>Obviously, such a fic would require more attention than normal- and that&#39;s where Marvin and Printworthy come in. What do you say to them teaming up with Rina and Randa to take this one down?<br><br>Here&#39;s the link if you want to see it: <a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9926560/1/"><a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9926560/1/">https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9926560/1/</a></a><br><br>Bring Bleeprin.</p>

            <p>I want to say yes. I really, really want to say yes. However, I am in a period of time whe I have absolutely no time. I&#39;m stealing a few minute to write this that I probably should not be. To do a proper coaberation would quite simply require more out of me then I can give at the moment.<br><br>That said... That fic is awful, and I do want to colaberate with you. You bring a more TOS feel to your missions, while I&#39;m more wordy and want to explore the consequenses and actions of badfic. Our writing could couple in an interesting way. Hmmm... What to do...<br><br>Alright. I probably shouldn&#39;t, but alright. I&#39;ll do it. HOWEVER, there are some conditions that must be met.<br><br>1. You have to do most of the writing. I do not have the time to write a mission right now, even with help. I will beta read and make sure Marvin and Printworthy are in character, and do some expantion on your points, but you have to do most of the work. I wish it could be more collaborative, but with my situation right now, I just can&#39;t.<br><br>2. Be prepaired for a long wait. I will try to respond to your messages and writings as soon as I can, but that may well be several days apart. I will try to be as thurough as I can, but it may take time to properly formulate my thoughts. Be patient. I&#39;m sure you are already, but I want to be sure you fully understand my constraints.<br><br>I was going to have a third, but I can&#39;t think of one. I just want to be sure we are clear on this. Again, feel free to use Marvin and Printworthy, and I am willing to help, but due to time, that may be limited.<br><br>That said, I&#39;m excited. Hopefully I can clear my schedual reletavely soon so I can get to work on my own missions, including futher collaborations. This will be interesting.</p>

            <p>EmmaLeUnicorn probably isn&#39;t Randa, since she <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=248593;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">predates RinaAndRanda&#39;s introduction</a>, and probably isn&#39;t World-Jumper, since he already has a screen name.

            <p>I&#39;d suggest that you find another beta as well. I&#39;ve been watching the Tiger and Bunny anime, and I&#39;ve seen the 2011 ThunderCats, so I can help with those fandoms.

            <p>So, I just watched <i>Endless Love</i>.<br><br>It&#39;s the 2014 remake of a 1981 movie based off a book by Scott Spencer. In the book, the main character, David Axelrod, burns down his girlfriend Jade Butterfield&#39;s house because of his obsession with her, which he believes is love.<br><br>Now the 2014 movie, for me, is proof that even Suethors can make movies, because all that really remains of the characterisation from the novel is the characters&#39; names. The new characters are infuriatingly flat (except Hugh Butterfield, the dad, who is played by the guy who plays Reboot Captain Pike), the romance shallowly developed yet still touted as true love, and the entire plotline has been completely rewritten so as to make David out to be some guy who&#39;s being framed by Jade&#39;s rich dad for shit so that the dad has an excuse to keep them apart. <br><br>For me, David and Jade in this remake are Suvian and make extremely dumb decisions (Jade freaking gives up a competitive internship to stay with David; I don&#39;t know about you but I think that&#39;s bull), the only good things about the movie can be counted on one hand (a discussion on consent, music, Pike being completely done with everything), and I am extremely glad I didn&#39;t actually spend money to watch this Suefic of a movie. What&#39;s really disappointing, though, is that this film was directed and written by a woman, which definitely would cast aspersions on the rest of us aspiring female screenwriters. I don&#39;t even want to know how many female directors and writers are going to be denied the chance to make their own ideas into reality because this one decided to pull out every romantic drama cliche starring white heterosexual couples and stick it into one film.<br><br>Anyone else ever watch a film and think immediately that it&#39;s a Suefic that got turned into a movie? And no, Twilight doesn&#39;t count.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not always the best judge of what makes a sueific adaptation but considering how Kristen Stewart&#39;s Snow White had NO CHARISMA WHATSOEVER and still managed to win almost everyone she needed to win over to her side. <br><br>Seriously I tried to like this movie. The CG was awesome and I kinda liked the portrayal of the evil queen but...Snow White herself has no discernible character, psychological and/or emotional motivation behind her actions. The whole &quot;She represents life and she&#39;s part of some sort of prophecy to overthrow the evil queen and save the kingdom&quot; felt really underwhelming and droll because she&#39;s such a one-dimensional character. <br><br>This isn&#39;t even taking into consideration the fact that the best asset Snow White is supposed to have is her physical beauty. That&#39;s her greatest weapon against the queen and the driving force behind this whole &quot;prophecy&quot; shtick from the get-go.<br><br>My Sue alarms were ringing big time during this film. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s a Stu.

            <p>Helsing as a character is fine. What they did in that movie was... ugh. The movie had a lot of potential, but they tried to do too much with the movie, too much CG effects and the writing was just bad.<br><br>Speaking of THAT (LoEG) movie, my beef with that movie and the one thing stopping me from purchasing the DVD (Yes, people still do that still and don&#39;t stream everything) is TOM SAWYER!<br><br>What. Is. He. Doing. In. That. Movie?!?!<br><br>There is nothing extraordinary about him and is such a useless Stu, self insert and ruins the entire movie for me. Hyde I can live with.<br><br>The only reason that Tom is in the movie was that the movie people wanted to get an American in the movie for their audience to &quot;relate&quot; to. Ugh.<br><br>As Hyde goes, the movie was based off of the comic series and as far as I know, they made him look like huge ape-man in the comics. While canonically, yes, he is supposed to be ugly in soul because no one can put their finger on why he looks distorted, this is based off of comic books where nothing is set in stone for appearances. The thought was most likely &quot;Make him look badass.&quot;<br><br>So they did and then made a movie out of said comic books.<br><br>~AW~</p>

            <p>Madoka Magica The Movie Rebellion. Just... no.<br><br>Those who follow my mission blog or IrregularS already know how I feel about that thing. (Desdendelle and Firemagic in particular - sorry for my extremely long rants on Skype)<br><br>Why is that movie so bad? Well, let&#39;s start with the minor offences. For example, the fan pandering. They tried to cram in everything that was popular with he fandom - and did it wrong in 90% of the cases. For example, the character of Nagisa... who got a total of five minutes of screentime and basically did nothing relevant to the plot. Or the Mami fanservice - we know she&#39;s popular because she&#39;s busty, no need to put her in a towel in a rather pointless scene just to show her assets some more (Oh, and she&#39;s 15, by the way)<br><br>Then, the inconsistencies with the original series. A good chunk of the plot could happen only if you retconned several rules of the continuum, so I assume they did.<br>For example, the Incubators trying to interfere with Madoka&#39;s Wish - it can&#39;t happen because doing that would prevent the Wish itself from being &quot;granted&quot; and so invalidate the Contract.<br>Then, the character derailment. OK, some characters had an excuse for being OOC (having altered memories can do that to you), but you know stuff is bad when the screenwriter says that the OOCness is &quot;character growth&quot; when you barely find an ounce of it in the whole movie.<br><br>Then... that ending. Just that ending. Aside from how it could have happened (it COULDN&#39;T and don&#39;t try to prove me wrong. It won&#39;t end well.), it&#39;s the cheapest of all the &quot;reopen the door after you just closed it&quot; endings.<br>Not to mention that it managed to shed a ton of negative light on my favourite character needlessly (as it was basically they only way the managed to come up with to keep a finished story going).<br><br>The fun thing is, though, that the movie somewhat touches a lot of the themes I was going to touch in Blank Sprite too, and that despite the fact that I came up with its plot way before the trailers for the movie came out...<br>Hopefully I&#39;ll do better.</p>

            <p>Should Kyuubey have been aware that he made a contract with a girl who (according to his words) never existed in the past and had no possibility of existing in the future? <br>Is it that he couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t?

            <p>The issue is that the characters who were OOC had figured out their memories were altered and had remembered the truth. Therefore after that point their OOC behavior is inexcused. And their behavior in the ending wouldn&#39;t even make sense with the altered memories because it&#39;s so at odds with every other facet of the character, and the altered memories wouldn&#39;t have caused that kind of outcome.</p>

            <p>Do you mean that after finding out that their memories were altered, they didn&#39;t act the way they would? That would be OOC if that was the case. I was saying that as long they reacted plausibly when they treated their altered memories as if they were their true memories (before realizing they weren&#39;t true), then it wasn&#39;t OOC. <br><br>I&#39;m interested in seeing specific examples on the conflicting differences between the versions of the characters, because I don&#39;t see them.</p>

            <p>...watching Pirates of the Caribbean 4 (On Stranger Tides) left me feeling like I was watching a rather boring fanfic. Seriously, it had everything: Captain Jack Sparrow, &#39;references&#39; (ie, rehashes) of scenes from the earlier movies, notably the first and second ones, a rather weak plot, and--well, let&#39;s just say that I gave up watching about halfway through, and haven&#39;t continued it since. It was ridiculous, and, like you (Lily) with Endless Love, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t pay any money for it. (Funnily enough, when it first came out, I didn&#39;t really want to see it...even though I like PotC.)<br><br>I&#39;m told it got a bit better in the second half, but that our dear Captain didn&#39;t seem to really need to be there. As fun as it was to see him running around again, I found it very disappointing that he was basically just rehashing his scenes from previous movies...and so I think I agree.<br><br>This is the movie that made me understand what a PPC agent must feel like in a mission. <i>That&#39;s not a good thing.</i>*<br><br>And, of course, out of all the possible results of this movie...I had to find the Suefic where the author confused the mermaids--who I never saw onscreen--with Sirens. And made the Sue Syrena&#39;s daughter...by which I mean, Syrena&#39;s daughter with Poseidon, beloved of all the Greek gods. Sorry, did I forget to mention it&#39;s a crossover? It&#39;s a crossover. Of course, this isn&#39;t the thread to rant about actual Suefics in, so I&#39;ll stop, but I thought it bore bringing up.<br><br>~DF<br><br>--<br>*There&#39;s also a wonderful little video of legolas by laura that made me feel like PPC agents were hiding just out of sight in it, but that&#39;s a different story, and <i>that was awesome</i>.

            <p>...but certainly there was no respect for canon. There&#39;s so much wrong, including:<br><br>-Grover as black stereotype (I wouldn&#39;t have cared if they race-lifted him, but they could have kept his personality the same. Also, there&#39;s some uncomfortable implications in the fact that the only character who was racelifted is one who&#39;s part animal.)<br><br>-Annabeth as excessively warlike action girl (aka let&#39;s take away her entire characterization and replace it with a sexualized version of Clarisse)<br><br>-Persephone being in the Underworld in the summer (Basic Greek mythology guys. *sherlock voice* Do your research!)<br><br>-Percy using the winged shoes<br><br>-Annabeth&#39;s hair color (they couldn&#39;t even bother to get <i>that</i> right until the second movie)<br><br>-Actors too old for the part<br><br>-Hades as villain (the books are good about staying true to his mythological characterization)<br><br>-the side quests with the pearls<br><br>-the Parthenon bit<br><br>-lack of Annabeth&#39;s knife and invisibility cap<br><br>-Percabeth in the first movie<br><br>-Silena Beauregard already working for Luke<br><br>-whatever the Hades happened with Kronos at the end of the second movie<br><br>-and probably more things I&#39;m forgetting<br><br>I just really hope people don&#39;t get discouraged from reading the books because the movies sucked.</p>

            <p>With the second film, I think they had three very difficult tasks:<br><br>1/ To try and fix the continuity problems with the first book. So they had to introduce the Kronos motif, bring Luke back, explain the increased ages (by changing the prophecy... it jarred, but it was better than ignoring it).<br><br>2/ To try and stay true to the book, as far as possible, while still fitting it into a film. I was actually surprised they did as well at this as they did - those books are <i>complex</i>.<br><br>3/ To try and make a standalone film. That&#39;s the reason for Kronos, for what it&#39;s worth. Most of the time, films based on a series of books assume the whole series will get made. But <i>Lightning Thief</i> was such a terrible flop that <i>Sea of Monsters</i> almost didn&#39;t. If you were making it, would <i>you</i> bank on making the rest of the series?<br><br>So they needed a resolution - an actual fight with the Big Bad. And I think it worked... pretty well, actually. It&#39;s not what happened in the book, but in the book, Luke never got his hands on the Fleece. What was his plan if he had? Presumably it <i>didn&#39;t</i> involve sacrificing a bunch of demigods and turning into Kronos himself - because that&#39;s what he ended up doing.<br><br>No, I can see it as &#39;the Fleece will put Kronos back together directly&#39;, and what happened in the amusement park as a valid AU scenario. And then they had to work out an ending that <i>could</i> lead into the rest of the series, on the offchance of them being made.<br><br>It&#39;s not a task I envy. Though I wish they hadn&#39;t changed the Prophecy (other than the word &#39;sixteen&#39;).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The next logical step would be making the prophecy refer to the fight with Gaea. But that rips a gigantic hole in Heroes of Olympus continuity. Jason proved himself in battle against the other Titans, and we don&#39;t know whether they were involved in this. Would Jason count as another potential child of the prophecy, or does &quot;eldest gods&quot; refer to the earliest versions of the gods (Greek, in this universe)? Without the whole Atlas thing (it was directly tied into Kronos&#39;s rise) what happens to Nico and Bianca? Does Bianca live? What about Thalia? Without the Hunters she would be the child of the prophecy - unless the shifted age means she&#39;s less likely?  With the original prophecy referring to the fight with Gaea, how do they know that there are seven demigods? How does Hazel get out of Asphodel, if Nico&#39;s time line is impacted?<br><br>Bottom line, they should just forget it and in twenty years, remake it properly.<br><br></p>

            <p>The end of <i>PJ: Sea of Monsters</i> wasn&#39;t the final defeat of Kronos - it was a defeat of him <i>in his own body</i>. As Wikipedia states:<br><br>&quot;The last scene shows the sarcophagus with Kronos&#39; remains in it glowing, presumably showing that Kronos is still alive somehow.&quot;<br><br>This attempt was defeated, so Luke has to fall back on the absolutely terrible backup plan: give up his own body for Kronos&#39; sake. In other words - back to the books.<br><br>So what else will they need to fix? We&#39;ve had no mention of Pan yet, but honestly, he&#39;s a sidequest anyway. The Hunters don&#39;t show up until <i>Titan&#39;s Curse</i> anyway. Ehm... did Clarisse get her prophecy in <i>SoM</i>, or not? Because the &#39;every quest needs a prophecy&#39; thing is fairly important in <i>Titan&#39;s Curse</i>.<br><br>And, of course, there&#39;s the Great Prophecy itself, which in film canon runs:<br><br><i>... this half-blood of the eldest gods<br>Will reach twenty against all odds<br>And see the world in endless sleep<br>The evil soul, cursed blade shall reap<br>A single choice will end his days<br>Olympus to preserve or raze<br>And that&#39;s raze as in destroy<br>I checked.</i><br><br>Wait, sorry, scratch the last two lines. (They were funny, though)<br><br>I... well, &#39;twenty&#39; is because of the actors, of course. But I worry about that &#39;evil&#39;. They needed it to make &#39;hey I can totes kill Kronny&#39; a viable conclusion - despite the fact that Percy wasn&#39;t old enough yet, <i>big hint, dude</i> - but it&#39;ll mess with <i>Last Olympian</i> (yay Hestia!).<br><br>My suspicion is that we&#39;ll slap a happy ending on - Luke gets possessed, Percy stabs him with Riptide and kills the Kronos part of him, letting Luke come back. Feh.<br><br>You can also drop Rachel Elizabeth Dare entirely from the plot - she exists solely to say &#39;You are not the hero&#39;, and now there&#39;s no mention of a hero in there. There&#39;s also no ambiguity - the <i>only</i> available reference for &#39;his&#39; is &#39;this half-blood of the eldest gods&#39;. &#39;The evil soul&#39; doesn&#39;t work.<br><br>So hey! New climax! Percy stabs Luke!Kronos, Luke gets better, and Percy dies of a broken heart when Annabeth immediately gets back together with Luke. Sounds good to me! Then we can start the new series: <i>Heroes of Olympus 1: Wait, Weren&#39;t You Evil?</i>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If bloomin&#39; only. Apparently, there is some debate as to whether Persephone was in Hades for winter, when everything was dead - or the height of summer, when everything was scorched and dead. It seems the Greeks understood it both ways. The only constant is that she was down there for the dead season, and with Demeter for the growing season.<br><br>Which, in the US, I guess means Hades in winter... depending on how well she&#39;s naturalised.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>-This is actually in the Constitution, sort of. Article 22 reads as follows:<br><br><b>22.</b> Also feel free to share links to badfics you find, if you think they’re worth telling us about. Sometimes we need a good laugh, sometimes we want to offer constructive criticism, sometimes we need something to kill for a mission. Not all badfic needs to be mentioned by itself, though — you can just post it directly to the List of Unclaimed Badfic, or add it to an already existing badfic thread on the Board. (And if you’re replying to a badfic plug, or reviewing it, remember Rule 3!)<br><br>And if anyone thinks that needs making more explicit, we can convert this thread to discussing possible changes (there or elsewhere). Also, the Constitution is bloomin&#39; huge these days, and if we did have such a thread, I&#39;d be agitating to shorten the blasted thing.<br><br>-But (and it&#39;s a big but) it&#39;s hardly an epidemic right now.  We have <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255226;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this thread</a>, and then five threads down, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255101;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this thread</a> which failed utterly. Then you&#39;re into the Shipfest and no-one wants to scroll past that.<br><br>There&#39;s also <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255111;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this thread</a>, in between, which, yes, should have been tacked onto the thread posted an hour before it. But... yeah, not really epidemic. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re posting prompted by events longer ago than the past week, yes?<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Dropping back to the Constitution, I wonder if #22 isn&#39;t both too restrictive and too vague. We might want something more like this:<br><br><b>22</b>. The PPC has always been about badfic, so feel free to talk about that, and post links if you find something you think is worth sharing. That said, we don&#39;t want badfic threads to overwhelm the Board, so if there&#39;s a thread about badfic on [the top half of] the front page already, please add to that rather than starting your own. (And when replying to a thread about badfic, or reviewing a badfic, please remember Article 3!)<br><br>That version is both more inclusive (discussion <i>about</i> badfic), and more explicit (put it in an old thread, not &#39;you can&#39;). So what does anyone think?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Article 4:<br><br><b>4.</b> People engaged in any violation of the Constitution, particularly Articles 1 &amp; 2 will be given at least one actual chance to stop and apologise. Telling someone to shut up because their opinion is unwanted does not constitute a chance. Giving someone a chance means informing them their behavior is wrong or unwanted according to our Constitution and why, as per Article 9.<br><br>And Article 9:<br><br><b>9.</b> The PPC as a community is responsible for upholding the Constitution. If you see someone breaking any of the rules and guidelines herein, please ask them to stop (politely- remember Article 7!) and explain why. If this doesn&#39;t resolve the situation, you will be backed up - and if it continues, a persistent rule-breaker should be shunned or asked to leave.  (If you&#39;re being accused of breaking a rule, take a step back and, if you are in the wrong, stop, apologise, and move on. Grudges are no fun!)<br><br>Having a rule which explicitly states that badfics should be confined to one thread opens up the possibility of someone being told to leave the Board because they forget to do so - in fact, it would make it a possible response if they do it <i>twice</i>, only.<br><br>We&#39;ve had people on the Board in the past who would have done that - not officially, but if you glare at a person and imply they should leave often enough, they do. I&#39;ve seen it happen. I don&#39;t want it to happen again.<br><br>So... punishment and sanctions. I believe that everyone on the Board is capable of following the rules, and that lapses should be reminded, not reprimanded. Someone who is actively out to cause trouble can and will be blocked. If we&#39;re reworking this thing, I think we need to say that: a) breaking the Constitution without malign intent happens, and everyone has the responsibility to remind you when you do - with no hard feelings. b) Long-term, low-level deliberate violations or &#39;forgetting&#39; may result in you being asked to shape up or leave. c) Deliberate malevolence (ie, violation of Articles 1-3) may result in (up to) &#39;apologise and stop, or be blocked&#39;.<br><br>I also think we need some sort of protection for people falsely or mistakenly accused. The following situation (heavily anonymised and modified) has occurred:<br><br>Oaken Thorinshield: I think this movie sucks.<br><br>Lacksidacksical: Oaken, you are so right!<br><br>Oaken Thorinshield: Don&#39;t use that word, you scumbag. Apologise now.<br><br>Lacksidacksical: What word? I don&#39;t understand. I&#39;m sorry if I upset you, all right?<br><br>Oaken Thorinshield: Apologise for saying That Word, or leave the Board, swine!<br><br>Lacksidacksical: I have no idea what&#39;s going on, but I&#39;m still sorry something&#39;s offended you. Are we all right now?<br><br>Summertide: Due to your callous disregard for Oaken&#39;s feelings in continuing to use the word &#39;right&#39; when everyone knows she hates that word because of what happened to her r*ght hand, Oaken has now left the PPC. You should be shot for this.<br><br>Now, we can&#39;t ask Oaken not to be upset - she was very attached to that hand - and asking her to calm down and stop insulting Lacksi probably wouldn&#39;t go very well... but equally, having her and Summertide demanding Lacksi apologise for something she&#39;s not even sure she did or be banned would be a perversion of everything the Constitution stands for.<br><br>You can create your own analogous situations which are less ridiculous (if 464646 says something in all innocence which OlderThanThou takes as an insult, should 464646 apologise for insulting OTT, when she never did so?), but the situation needs considering, at least.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Two of them, one much bigger than the other. Since we already have a First Amendment, I guess that makes these:<br><br><b><u>The Second Amendment</u></b>, or, the Badfic Amendment<br><br><b>Current text:</b><br><br>21. Feel free to shamelessly plug stories, websites, or anything else to your heart’s content, if you think they’ll be of interest to the PPC in general. We’re in dire need of entertainment and good fanfic.<br><br>22. Also feel free to share links to badfics you find, if you think they’re worth telling us about.

(And if you’re replying to a badfic plug, or reviewing it, remember Rule 3!)<br><br>23. The Board in particular is a fairly small space for the number of people we have, so before you post, see if someone else is already talking about your pet topic. Got a fic you want to plug? Add it on to an already-extant badfic or goodfic thread — there’s usually one floating around. In accordance with Article 9, if someone breaks this guideline a few times, be nice! You may have seen it a hundred times before, but they probably haven&#39;t.<br><br><b>Proposed Amendment:</b><br><br>21. Feel free to shamelessly plug stories, websites, or anything else to your heart’s content, if you think they’ll be of interest to the PPC in general. We’re in dire need of entertainment and good fanfic. Before you post, though, see if someone else is already talking about your preferred topic - no-one will object if you add to a relevant thread instead of starting your own (in fact, we often prefer it)!<br><br>22. The PPC has always been about having a good laugh at badfic, so feel free to talk about it, and post links if you find something you think is worth sharing. That said, we don&#39;t want badfic threads to overwhelm the Board, so if there&#39;s a thread about badfic on the top half of the front page already, please add to that rather than starting your own. (And when replying to a thread about badfic, or reviewing a badfic, please remember Article 3!)<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br><br>This is a consolidation, clarification, and expansion amendment. It consolidates 3 articles into 2, clarifies the times when you should add to an old thread, and expands &#39;badfic threads&#39; to include &#39;threads about badfic&#39;. Overall, a fairly minor change.<br><br>Unlike this:<br><br><b><u>The Third Amendment</u></b>, or, the Dispute Resolution Amendment<br><br><b>Link:</b><br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mlDm26QBLkOVTLcW17lDSodtAdLn2cADb0ty9pBcvfM/edit?usp=sharing">The Third Amendment</a>. It covers Articles 1-10, though the document includes the rest of the Constitution as well, in order to update the numbering.<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br><br>The Dispute Amendment is a major restructuring (again) of the first part of the Constitution. In summary, I&#39;ve tried to:<br><br>-Separate dispute <i>resolution</i> out from the rules you can actually break.<br><br>-Clarify the treatment of people you accuse of breaking the rules - ie, don&#39;t flame, give them an actual chance. It was already in there, but this I think is clearer.<br><br>-Expand on the responsibilities of the community. Instead of &#39;If this doesn&#39;t resolve the situation, you will be backed up&#39;, the Amendment states, &#39;any and all uninvolved community members have a responsibility to back up the person who is in the right, or to defuse an unclear situation.&#39;.<br><br>-Clarify the way to react to <i>misunderstandings</i>.<br><br>-Highlight that ignoring an apology or valid explanation is a form of persecution.<br><br><b>Controversial changes:</b><br><br>Most of what I&#39;ve done is rewording and reshuffling, but there are a few pieces that might be controversial:<br><br>-I have stated that, &#39; It is never wrong to ask a third party to comment on a dispute - but try to find someone uninvolved; you want an honest comment, not just someone to say you’re right.&#39; I think it&#39;s important, if badly-phrased, but do we rather want people to look first for someone who can convince the other person they&#39;re wrong?<br><br>-&#39;8. Wilful ignorance is not an excuse. If someone is ignoring the Constitution and claiming that they’re not really doing anything wrong - despite explanations to the contrary - that may constitute using up their chance. However, wilful ignorance on the part of the accuser is also not an excuse. If someone clarifies a genuine misunderstanding, continuing to push for an apology may count as persecution on your part.&#39; This is the new &#39;wilful ignorance&#39; clause. Are we happy with saying that repeatedly claiming you don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve done wrong (in face of explanations) is no defence? And are we happy with the final sentence (with emphasis on &#39;may&#39;)?<br><br>-Related to the above, Article 5 now states: &#39;Equally, if there has been an honest misunderstanding, accept the mistake and  move on. Apologies for making a mistake, and for being unclear, are recommended, but should not be demanded.&#39;. If the latter point above is unwanted, how should this be changed?<br><br>-&#39;if you find yourself being harassed or bullied by another PPCer, please make the community aware!&#39; Are we happy with this? Do we want to clarify how you should do so?<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I suspect the Badfic Amendment will be relatively uncontroversial, so unless anyone objects to it, I intend to insert it when there&#39;s a fair number of replies here. The Dispute Resolution Amendment, however, I will keep in the works until we have a satisfactory version.<br><br><b>Please comment</b>. Like the thing says, all opinions are welcome - and important!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My main problem is that the two parts of the community have totally different ways of operating. If you&#39;re on the IRC, and someone&#39;s hassling you, you can straight up discuss it on there (I guess). If you&#39;re on the Board, do we want people starting a thread to say it? I don&#39;t know; we might, actually. Thoughts? Anyone? I&#39;m not trying to write this whole thing myself, you know.<br><br>hS</p>

Maybe &quot;about having a good laugh at badfic&quot; instead? I&#39;d like to see more of that, less taking it very seriously all the time. I mean, we all know it can&#39;t <i>really</i> hurt us even though it can make us mad sometimes, right? Hyperbolic wailing and gnashing of teeth is just part of the fun, right...?

            <p>Just when I had it all nice and sorted that I knew what was going on, you step in and throw it all for a loop!<br><br>See, I thought that the Trousers of Time was the event you were referencing to when you first posted that image. See, what made me think that was that each of the different symbols were completely separate organizations, and in the blue box, we see the symbol for the Paladins, the alternate future for the PPC. But at the time, it was not an separate organization, it was the same one, just evolved over time. So, when the Trousers of Time happened, the Paladins could truly be considered separate!<br><br>Now this thing comes out! War propaganda? Posters preparing for the defense of canon? Well, this is completely against what I was thinking! Now they are organized... into... factions...<br><br>Wait a minute...<br><br>The invasion of the EPC. It&#39;s been hinted at in other stories, including one where some spies found their way through to our sector of the multiverse. Now the EPC is coming through, but they face several fordable foes, including the PPC. Now, they are uniting with other Suvian organizations, especially  the Mary Sue Factories, which can mass-produce Sues and Stus to fight. They find the city of Sparklee, the ultimate Suetopia, and gets them to lend assistance. So the respecters of canon have to unite against the Suevian front, and push them back into the Pit from whence they came!<br><br>...No. No, there&#39;s more then that. There is somebody involved, somebody specifically. At the very top of the graph, it says &quot;Respect for Character.&quot; We could take that to mean, in order of respect for original characterization, however, I think there&#39;s something more.

Could it be those who are allowed to interact with our Personification of Canon? Or is it a place, with important information?

I don&#39;t have the time now, but at some point in the semi-near future, I may want to slam out some early drafts of those stories and send them to you, Huinesoron, so I can see how they fit with this story you have, and how I can change it so it better fits your ideas. If I do, I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9w4N5Jus08">Pinkie Promise</a> that I won&#39;t share a word of what&#39;s going to happen.

            <p>I&#39;m seeing the Mary Sue Factories involved in this, definitely, but considering all of the other buildup involving Selene&#39;s escape from the Psychs, and the occasional mentions of an Ispace war involving multiple trans-dimensional organizations, I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not an EPC invasion. It might involve them in some capacity, since that cactus-with-a-sword symbol at the bottom left looks very similar to the symbol for <a href="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101022041208/ppc/images/6/6b/EPC_DoA_flash_patch.jpg">their Department of Arrests</a>, but I&#39;m guessing the real heavy hitters here will be Ispace and their allies.<br><br>See, Ispace is sort of like the Department of Elf Protection we used to have, except where ours kept any elves or elf-like creatures save from being afflicted by Sues or maligned by inaccurate descriptions of their character and culture, Ispace is just trying to keep any elves or elf-like creatures(or Eoelc, as I&#39;ve just now decided to abbreviate it) from being harmed in any way whatsoever. The problem here is that a lot of Mary Sues are Eoelcs, or take on an Eoelc-inian appearance to be more speshul.<br>Ispace started out as a similar organization to the PPC, at least in theory, protecting not a specific canon but anything in the multiverse that they see as &quot;elven&quot;. They believe that if elves are allowed to be damaged and defamed,  eventually there will be no more Eoelc of any sort, and that a universe without any elven influence is a universe that is about to fall apart on a cultural level. They&#39;re a very specific kind of crazy and dogmatic.<br><br>I think that they may have met up with the League of Mary Sue Factories, or at least as many of them as can be gathered under one banner, and negotiated with their leader,  nominally the Venomous Tentacula but quite possibly someone who would be less rash and more receptive to their propositions. While the goals and modus operandi of the two organizations are very different, Ispace hates the PPC and the OFUs for oppressing the diversity of Eoelcs by killing Mary Sues and preventing Mary Sues from being born, respectively, and the League hates the entire Canon Protection Initiative for destroying and discrediting their product, and the PPC in particular for warding off their numerous attempts to establish a firm foothold in the multiverse. The Biohazard symbol probably means that they&#39;ll be getting supplies from the Flower who took over after PPC Bioengineering was jettisoned during the Reorganization, the mysterious Horsetail. That&#39;s the logo of his restructured &quot;BioInc&quot;. I&#39;ve <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=247459">seen him referenced here before</a>, but to my knowledge he has never made an appearance in a story. The Horsetail would have reason to work with Ispace and the League, in part because they&#39;d be one of his company&#39;s most interesting and lucrative customers in years, but also because they lost one of their biggest trading partners when the PPC excised them.<br><br>Now, the Selene part. Dafydd&#39;s been world-hopping recently, and while he&#39;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TjFsuVhzR_iPwxw_sxLz9LjuDF6ylRbA6FrXMI-EVrw/pub">shown up back at the PPC at least once</a>, another time we see him is <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndGale.htm">when he travels to the multiverse of the TCDA</a>. It took a lot of exchange to confirm this, but evidently, Dafydd and Selene&#39;s TCDA counterpart broke her out of her cell and took her out of Headquarters, and then exposed her to a device that allowed her to recover at least a portion of her sanity. It&#39;s possible that Dafydd was just going to the first multiverse that had the technology to repair the mind of his former partner and old friend, but now that I know the book surrounded by three shapes represents the PPC, that book-with-shapes next to it is starting to look a lot like a gear, isn&#39;t it? <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=245926">Dafydd&#39;s family and associates have known about Ispace for a while now,</a>, though they hyperbolically refer to it as the &quot;anti-PPC&quot;, and Dafydd may be attempting to set up some sort of resistance to it. It is possible that Dafydd, being both an elf and Huinesoron&#39;s former self-insert(he&#39;s had three or four now; it&#39;s crazy), may have been involved with Ispace in the past, but it is more likely that he&#39;s heard of it during his travels through the multiverse and knows what the group is capable of.(Of note: Ispace has as of now made confirmed contact with <a href="http://ofudisc.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/ispace-chapter-six-fight-for-your-life.html">at least one of Huinesoron&#39;s other self-inserts</a>. If this starts going meta and ties into the Message, it will officially be one of the most unexpected reacharounds I&#39;ve seen here, but it probably won&#39;t, considering the circumstances, and I&#39;m getting off-topic.) My personal theory is that he&#39;s planning on rallying the TCDA and any other vestiges of canon he can find to stand up against it when it finally decides to invade in force. This will, in all likelihood, include several alternate versions of the PPC. The white dog in the Restricted Access box may indicate that we&#39;re getting the Mirror DIS in on this, too, since several members of their organization were last seen rebelling against the tyrannical leaders of the Mirror Multiverse and fleeing to some ill-documented corner of the main multiverse, which should be fun. Selene may be an important part of Dafydd&#39;s plan, though he could just as likely have broken her out for more sentimental reasons, like a desire to fight off another threat to canon together with his first partner, or a guilt for leaving her in her cell all alone and insane while he&#39;s safe in the unpublished haven that he retreated to post-resurrection.<br><br>I can&#39;t see any sort of symbol that would represent the Neo Abduction Schemers Treaty of Youth, though. Maybe the pink crown with wings. NASTY would almost certainly be involved here in some capacity. They&#39;re trans-dimensional fangirls with access to giant robots and the ability to hijack portal devices, which they&#39;ve used to sneak their members into HQ before, occasionally in large numbers. Judging by their name, they&#39;d also have some sort of stake in wanting to get rid of the PPC, so that they can capture canon characters and locations to have them all for themselves, though several parts of that motive are admittedly largely speculation at this point. They&#39;d make very good soldiers for Ispace&#39;s alliance, too: they&#39;re motivated enough to have broken into HQ before, they&#39;ve got giant robots, which are always an advantage, and they most likely do not contain a large number of Eoelcs, so Ispace might see them either as expendable or as people who are capable of operating on their own without Ispace needing to be around to ensure that there aren&#39;t any unwarranted elf deaths.<br><br>As for what the &quot;Character&quot; and &quot;Access&quot; section mean, I think it might just be how they treat characters and how they bring in employees and/or interact with the outside world. The PPC is restrictive, in that it will only recruit characters from within badfics they encounter or those who fall through plotholes, in small numbers at a time, the TCDA is a little more restrictive in that they limit that to only canons containing steampunk or published before the 1940s or so, and the OFUs hardly ever take on any new staff at all.<br>To take on the second definition, neither the PPC nor the TCDA want anyone to know that they exist, but the news sometimes gets out anyway, and the OFUs are isolated from pretty much everyone until they bring in a new class or something nasty invades the campus. Meanwhile, BioInc down there would recruit or do business with anyone in the multiverse, since they&#39;re a business and would be primarily concerned with profit, and the League would still do business with plenty of people, but they wouldn&#39;t advertise broadly, in part because the PPC might step on their salad again and in part because their product is much more specific and refined than the sorts of things BioInc would put out. There are only so many uses for a Sue.<br>The one major hole in my idea is the fact that the Department of Arrests is all the way down at the bottom, since they&#39;d have more recruits than the PPC, what with the entire Mirror Multiverse being devoted to the production of Mary Sues. Then again, it&#39;s possible that this relates to activities within our multiverse, in which case it is entirely justified. People from our multiverse would need to be willing and able to cross time and space to join a Suvian organization for them to pick up recruits or customers from the main multiverse, and those three factors rarely converge.<br><br>Respect for Character would not necessarily mean that there was a specific character, and since that&#39;s a subtitle to &quot;Respect for Canon&quot;, and the bottom of the canon-respect list contains the League of Mary Sue Factories, I&#39;d say that&#39;s pretty much locked. Besides, we&#39;ve dealt with Agents trying to do something pertaining to the murkily defined &quot;power of all of canon&quot; before. It didn&#39;t turn out so well, and I mean that from a storytelling standpoint. The people involved mostly came out alive, but it was an unsatisfying story that didn&#39;t really take the most of its potential.<br><br>So, yeah, it looks to me like it&#39;s shaping up to be PPC, alternate-PPCs, and OFUs against forces of uncanon hailing from across the omniverse. Bring it on. If I can see some Agents from the Magical Girl PPC AU fighting off a fangirl-driven giant robot on the deck of a steampunk battleship to rescue it from the dogmatic elves that captured from the protectors of the Victorian era, I will go out <i>very</i> happy.</p>

            <p>People keep coming up with interesting theories that I could <s>steal bits of</s> be inspired by.<br><br>And three things, since that&#39;s a lot of words to go unrewarded:<br><br>-&#39;Restricted&#39; and &#39;Freedom of Access&#39; are to do with to what extent the organisations want non-canonical people to be able to access the canons. Left of centre wants to restrict that in some way, with the further left being more restrictions - the PPC wants to stop badfic characters, while the OFUs try to restrict <i>any</i> access that hasn&#39;t gone through them. On the centre-line we have the &#39;anyone can come in if they don&#39;t mess with [our particular concern]&#39;. Anything right of centre is actively encouraging access - whether it be making Mary-Sues and sending them in (the Factories), or more benign forms of access. The horizontal axis was a secondary consideration when making the chart - the vertical access was considered more important. So the TDCA has probably been pushed to the left a bit, in order to keep it lower down than the OFUs. (Honestly, the OFUs, PPC, and TCDA should be overlapping - but that would look ugly)<br><br>-Secondly, I think you overestimate NASTY. They&#39;re focussed on a single character, were defeated by one person, and have never reappeared. They&#39;re actually in the story, but as a minor player - so I&#39;m afraid they&#39;re not on the chart.<br><br>-Finally, this:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/FreedomPoster.png"><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I mean, <i>they</i> were only in one story, and <i>they</i> never appeared again. The Eminence crew don&#39;t even really have any claim to fame, other than their leaders being three Overpowered!Sues who apparently &quot;took out&quot; Neyna, Rosie, and Dafydd offscreen, and occasionally ending stories by taking Sues out of their fics and into the starship instead of by killing them. It&#39;s certainly a hook for <i>something</i> to happen, but I wouldn&#39;t see them as being a more potent presence than the trans-dimensional fangirls with giant robots and plenty of opportunity for development of motive and exploration of methods. Plus, NASTY could serve as a set of Psycho Rangers to KittyEden&#39;s Sue Slayers, if they&#39;re still getting involved in this, as a permutation of the wild, semi-Suvian Squees that the Sue Slayers often fight.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure where you got the idea that NASTY was only focused on one character, though, and the only reason that they were able to be fought back so easily(and it took considerably more than one person to do so, by the way) was because there weren&#39;t very many of them. Actually, their one  confirmed appearance ends with Dann and WyldeHorse beating one of their robots and then Dann just leaving before <i>anyone</i> deals with the rest of them. It&#39;s just said that Dann had to help with cleaning up the broken robot&#39;s parts, and not even whether or not the fangirls fled after he knocked out the robot or anything to explain why the reinforcement NASTY troops just stopped being around. There&#39;s just not anything else there. From what we have, it looks as though the fangirls ran through the halls, the robot stayed back to beat up Dann, it was defeated, and Dann left before seeing how the rest of the fight would turn out. It&#39;s not really his affair, true, but that seems almost irresponsible.</p>

            <p>I think &quot;Neo&quot; there means something more along the lines of the modern shorthand, a.k.a. &quot;the new version, better than the (insert relevant object here) that came before&quot;. Because, you know, they&#39;re Suvian-derived fangirls, and have all of the egotistic self-importance that fangirls create amplified to titanic levels.<br>I&#39;m not sure why you thought it had just been Neo as in Keanu Reeves Neo, other than because Tessa is from the <i>Matrix</i> continuum and she was helped beat the first wave of NASTYs, and that&#39;s a very tenuous link. There&#39;s nothing to support that NASTY was a <i>Matrix</i>-themed group. In fact, several of the NASTY members were explicitly idenified as &quot;anime fangirls&quot;, and there was never a Matrix anime. There was a direct-to-video animated movie based on the Matrix, but that&#39;s not the same thing.</p>

The racks each had a sign on top. There was a Star Wars rack, a few Matrix racks, a Star Trek rack, and so on. As they walked, Zim began to talk.<br><br>&quot;We have weapons for every major fandom, and bunches of generic weapons that can fit into smaller canons. We&#39;ve got hand to hand weapons, ranged weapons, bombs, missiles, and even a few large weapons. We can equip an agent to go into almost any fandom, disguised as almost anything. Want to be a Matrix rebel? We have the stuff. Want to be a Jedi? Same deal. You said you were going into Lord of the Rings? What were you thinking of going as?&quot;</i><br><br>The giant robot sounds a lot like the things in the Matrix sequels, too.

Makes-Things says &quot;We&#39;ve been found&quot; - and the two sets of fangirls we <i>see</i> come through portals never have the term &#39;NASTY&#39; applied to them. The latter set is the one specifically highlighted as &#39;anime fangirls&#39;. It could well be that NASTY posted the coordinates on the internet. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>1/ NASTY are in the story already, as a bit part.<br><br>2/ The only reason they don&#39;t have an emblem on the chart is because I can&#39;t come up with a good design.<br><br>3/ NASTY are boring. They&#39;re just... generic fangirls-with-portals. There is nothing to distinguish them from the fangirl horde attacking the Lonely Mountain at the end of the original Ispace. Shifter, though? Shifter&#39;s interesting. She&#39;s on a mission to rescue Mary-Sues - but along the way, most of her crew have developed character of their own. They <i>aren&#39;t</i> &#39;Sues any more - they just use the name.<br><br>She&#39;s also more interesting from a historical perspective. I was <i>here</i> when Yukai na Itazura showed up, claiming to be a Very Oldbie under an alias, and presented the idea. It&#39;s an anti-PPC story which was cowritten with members of the PPC (and features the only surviving Artemis-written appearance of Black and Irvine). I always wanted to see how the story was going to go; since that never happened, I&#39;m giving them a minor role in mine.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>A question regarding the first: are there any trans-dimensional groups you&#39;ve come across that you <i>didn&#39;t</i> want to include in this upcoming event? I&#39;m just curious. I see you have representatives of canon sources, every in-universe party that has ever interacted with the PPC in a major way, and evidently a large number of less prominent players. Was there anything that you looked over and thought &quot;Nah, that won&#39;t work&quot;?<br><br>The second is a good point. Since they&#39;ve not really been defined or explored, there&#39;s not very much to draw from to make a symbol out of. That makes sense.<br><br>I suppose we have reversed ideas on this, then. Nothing wrong with that. I see NASTY as fully capable of expanding in a number of directions, in part because &quot;an organized group of fangirls caught up in the fictional multiverse&quot; is such a broad concept, and in part because they have the opportunity and potential to become a PPC enemy that isn&#39;t either a force derived from the PPC or some sort of dark inverse of PPC principles. They&#39;ve got portals, yes, so they&#39;re still a little derivative, but how else are they going to pass from world to world? By being tossed?<br>...Actually... (scribbles frantically in a Word document)<br>The <i>Eminence</i> crew, on the other hand, I see as the pinnacle of generic advancements. &quot;The PPC hunts Sues, so what if there were Sues that <i>rescued other Sues from being hunted</i>? And they could be a <i>team</i>, and be <i>exiled from the world</i>, because if they come back they&#39;ll be hunted down, but they&#39;ll also be super-mysterious and a huge enough threat to be able to bring down the best Agents all by themselves without the audience seeing, and it&#39;ll be <i>so rad</i>!&quot; Yawn. What do they intend to do other than going around and being a mild nuisance? You say they &quot;aren&#39;t Sues any more&quot;, but they seem to be just as small-minded and paint-by-numbers as any Sue might be. They&#39;re just not Sues in the same sense that the delicate and beautiful secret half-sister of Elrond who falls in love with Samwise and makes it rain in Mordor for the first time in centuries is. The three leaders we see have multiple personality traits, true, and their interactions with one another are far less annoying than those between a typical Sue and her disciples, but I don&#39;t see any distinction that makes them more important than some random aberration that managed to dodge the God-Mod Agents sent to get rid of her would be if said aberration had the resourcefulness to survive.<br>It might be a good concept, if it was explored and elaborated upon(What happens to the Sues they rescue? Are there other roving bands of independent Sues? What has been the Canon Protection Initiative&#39;s response to the independent Sues other than &quot;omigosh omigosh it&#39;s <i>her</i>, we can&#39;t beat her on our <i>own</i>!&quot;), and I&#39;m not going to disparage the historical significance of Ashes to Glory, but I just don&#39;t think the <i>Eminence</i> crew&#39;s significance is so huge that it would make other groups look pointless by comparison. Again, though, just a difference of opinions. There&#39;s nothing wrong with either view.</p>

            <p>In theory, everyone is probably <i>involved</i>: there&#39;s a low-key war going on across the Multiverse, with enough sides that everyone has an opinion.

            <p>There was some talk about a crossover a while back, but their methods and structures were different enough from ours despite the surface-level similarities that we eventually decided to leave each other&#39;s universes alone, or at least that&#39;s the explanation for it based on what I&#39;ve been able to pick up. That and the fact that I don&#39;t think they&#39;re not really organized in any traditional way, which might have been what Huinesoron was talking about with &quot;coordinating&quot; them. There are a few loosely connected locations that they appear to frequent on occasion, but no real inter-connectivity, and to involve them in anything could easily necessitate bringing together several disparate sub-groups before negotiations were even started.<br><br>So, anything that is done in this event wouldn&#39;t affect them in any way, unless they decide to have it affect them for laughs, because the universes don&#39;t co-exist. Likewise, if they decide to go through with what from brief inspection of their archives looks to be a project to clone Cthulhu, we won&#39;t have to deal with the after-affects of a newborn Great Old One who is aware of the existence of the multiverse. That&#39;s a very bad idea, really, teaching one those sorts of things. It&#39;s like tutoring Vanamonde in sorcery. Nothing good is going to come of it.</p>

            <p>Mutually uncanon is mutually uncanon, though. They, in all likelihood, wouldn&#39;t even notice, because, out-of-universe, there are dozens of Sue-hunting groups and fics and characters, and hardly any of them exist in the same continuity as any others. There are just different rules for each one. And since it&#39;s mutually uncanon, they wouldn&#39;t necessarily be checking up on us, since they have their own scenarios to set up and problems to deal with that don&#39;t overlap with ours. <br><br>Well, the good news is that, since the Key to Canon was created as a Doctor Who rip-off, the version of the Snooze that manifests because of it will actually be the S&#39;mьz, from the quintessential Doctor Whooves fic &quot;Time Lords and Terror&quot;! All we need to do is find some sort of absorptive source or containment field for psychokinetic energy, and it will be much easier to real with!

            <p>Going by my theory above, General Dandy would be a member of one of the alternate PPCs, probably encountered either by Dafydd&#39;s rounds through the multiverse or through some Cascade-related shenanigans. In fact, he could be the TCDA&#39;s Captain Dandy equivalent, seeing that the few Flowers we know about are referred to with loftier titles, such a &quot;Sir Mallorn&quot; for the Bonsai Mallorn.<br><br>The Cascade bit is a little less likely, but seeing how the Cascade created plothole tunnels cutting through reality in one universe that Captain Dandy and his Weeds decided to explore for the purpose of warding off foes and mapping the tunnels, it would probably create the same or similar effects if it was set off in another universe. There might be any number of Captain Dandies lost in the web of cracks spidering through the PPC&#39;s world.</p>

            <p>Look at his right leaf, the cactus with the sword is desplayed clearly. The EPC will be involved, and while hS is likely to focus on ISPACE, as you mentioned, I hope there is some focus on the actions of tje EPC. There has been some build up for a while of the EPC invading the &#39;main&#39; multiverse, and I hope it is not shoved to the side for a bunch of insane pointy-eared bastards. That said, hopefully this event won&#39;t be for a good while yet, because I just do not have the time to write out my mirror!Jumper stories right now, which explore the EPC in a little greater depth then we have managed to see thus far.<br><br>That said, I do like your theory. It sounds the most complete and logical of all of the theories, and is most likely the closest to what is going to happen. The only thing I would like to bring up are the pink city with Gondor&#39;s tree on it. I will put money down that the pink city is the city of Sparklee from the PPC musical (especially since hS added it after I thought the crown with wings was Sparklee) but the question is, how? How are they important enough to warrant a symbol on the graph? NASTY is involved, yet plays such a minor role that they don&#39;t have their symbol on the chart. So what do they do, other then send in troops? Well, the city already has a Mary Sue Factory, and is somewhat of a haven for Sues and their defenders as is, so perhaps Sparklee is the main base of operations for the Mary Sue faction. The capitol of the Marizu, if you will.<br><br>Whatever this event is, I am very much looking forward to seeing how it all works out. Who knows, if hS wants to get meta on us, perhaps he could bring the Protectorate of Plort. That may be interesting. Or beyond stupid. Whatever it is, I am looking forward to seeing how this mystery plot unravels.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sure that there will be some important EPC business at some point, but if we play the full invasion card when there are already a half-dozen other groups invading, it won&#39;t be nearly as significant. Sending in some Tiger Lily-loyalist DIS members and a number of Department of Arrests Agents, perhaps led by this mirror Captain Dandy, to aid Ispace&#39;s attacks would help development for a later event without depleting all of the buildup. Maybe there would be a few EPC troops brought in after somebody finds out a way into the mirror multiverse to serve as backup for Ispace, and when everything goes pear-shaped, one of the EPC group&#39;s leaders can make a move to capture some of the uncanon alliance&#39;s resources for their planned invasion in the future, using the information that they&#39;ve gathered from helping Ispace to better assess the strengths and weaknesses of the forces accessible to their mirror counterparts.<br><br>Wait, there was a PPC musical? When? I tried looking both it and Sparklee up on the wiki and the Board&#39;s search bar just now, and I couldn&#39;t find anything more conclusive than &quot;that sure was around at some point&quot;.

            <p>To be honest, the reason that it took so long was that I was looking for multi-character combinations that would make a single letter. It didn&#39;t occur to me that it would be one number/letter to one letter, so I started by looking for hex code patterns. After several hours of this not working, I tried other letter multiples and then gave up in disgust. <br><br>Then,this morning I got the information that each letter was tied to a specific character. With this knowledge, and some fancy typing in MS Excel, I was able to make a spreadsheet that would turn each coded character into its real value, and see how that would fit with the other letters in real time, as soon as I found it. <br>I started with I and T, and then found the grouping of 10 letters with an I as the 3rd letter. This gave me 10 letters in total that I knew, and adding in 0 as the space gave me 11 out of 16. From there it was a simple matter of looking at the words and seeing what letters should fit where.<br><br>Thats pretty much it. <br><br></p>
