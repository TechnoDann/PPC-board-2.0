            <p>So. I have I fic (well, a three-sentence-drabble series, but same difference). It needs a beta. It&#39;s a Welcome to Night Vale/Dresden Files crossover, major spoilers up to <i>Cold Days</i> for Dresden and, mm, &quot;Lazy Day&quot; for Night Vale, I think. It won&#39;t even make <i>sense</i> without &quot;Yellow Helicopters&quot;, though. Anyone who wishes to beta will be immensely appreciated and effusively thanked.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqYiBi0Vcu08lH9XHPc04Tqqbm5SGlv36WrpzITB3Lc/edit?usp=sharing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqYiBi0Vcu08lH9XHPc04Tqqbm5SGlv36WrpzITB3Lc/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqYiBi0Vcu08lH9XHPc04Tqqbm5SGlv36WrpzITB3Lc/edit?usp=sharing</a></a><br><br>Thank you in advance!<br><br>-Aila</p>

I don&#39;t do any explaining except as to how they fit together, and a lot of things are referenced but not expanded on, as they happen in canon and I expect the reader to know them. Still, if you&#39;re up to date on The Dresden Files and Welcome To Night Vale, or even if you&#39;re not and feel like looking for grammar issues, I welcome you with open arms.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>You&#39;re almost there, it&#39;s target audiance is 8 year old girls and their parents. Both parents. and so, 20ish year old guys get into the show. Which I don&#39;t see much problem with this concidering the fact that this is rated E for everyone<br></p>

            <p>People immediately assume bronies are creepy or pedophiles or gay. And while yes, there are some bronies who are creepy, or pedophiles, or gay, the creepy pedos aren&#39;t the majority, thank god. I&#39;m not sure of the statistics regarding gay bronies, and though I know a few gay bronies, I&#39;m fairly sure they&#39;re not the majority- and even if they are/were, people shouldn&#39;t make such a stink about it.<br><br>The fans just aren&#39;t seen very favorably because of that stupid thing called &#39;gender stereotypes&#39;. It 20 year-old women were watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, nobody would call them perverts.<br><br>Tl;dr it&#39;s kind of a sore spot for me... especially when people just put bronies into an even more negative light by writing crap like this.</p>

            <p>When my mom was first made aware of the fandom, she sat me down to warn me that probably most adult male bronies were only in it because they were pedophiles hoping to get some young girls. <br><br>I&#39;ve met several bronies, and they&#39;re mostly nice people who will give you help on your stories if you ask for it.</p>

            <p>Brony study, headed by the fandom&#39;s personal team of psychologists (who are outside of the fandom, yet find it interesting) have conducted numerous studies on bronies. One of the fist ones was, quite simply, what is a brony. You can find all kinds of interesting things <a href="http://www.bronystudy.com/index.html">here.</a> <br><br>However, to answer the question on the sexuality of bronies, here are the numbers. Now, granted, this study was taken a year or two ago, so it may not be 100% accurate, but close enough for our purposes. Here are the numbers:<br><br>84% heterosexual <br>1.7% homosexual <br>10.3% Bisexual <br>3.8% Asexual<br><br>Also, 86% of the fandom is male. Sorry trans folks, they asked a binary question. The rest are assumed female. So there we go.<br><br>Also, since I&#39;m here. Iximaz, how&#39;s the mission going?</p>

            <p>I also happen to be good with Latin, but I know that with a language as complicated as Latin, it would be advantageous to have one translator, or at least two working together, than two working independently--you&#39;ll inevitably get two different translations in the latter case.</p>

Kitty winced slightly.<br>&quot;Uhh... can someone change that?&quot;<br>The doors were open, the tables were full to overflowing, Kitty had begun to carelessly boogie on the dance floor, and already some minis were drifting in.<br>Now, all the ball needed were some Boarders...<br><br>PLEASE REFER BACK TO THE POST &#39;AN INVITATION&#39; FOR DETAILS ABOUT THE  BALL.</p>

            <p>The party was grand, and all had fun, but now it is clear that the festival has ended. The lights have dimmed, the snack bar is empty, and only a few boarders remain, passed out in various compromising positions. The jukebox is stuck playing a slow, instrumental song for the rest of the night.<br>Suddenly, a lone boarder bursts in through the door in a disheveled suit and a party hat.<br>&quot;I&#39;m here!&quot; He announces to the sleeping boarders, &quot;Where&#39;s the chocolate?&quot;<br>Scanning the room, the boarder realizes a horrifying truth about the party, and about himself. He was tardy.<br>&quot;But, but I brought bunny ears.&quot; He sniffles, holding up a headband with crudely made paper ears stapled to it.<br>Then, a light catches his eye. Tiptoeing over to the snack table, the late boarder finds a wilver egg nestled into a cooler. Inside are a half dozen bleeprin jellybeans.<br>&quot;Well, good to see I didn&#39;t miss everything. Just most things.&quot; The boarder says, chuckling to himself.<br>He sets his homemade bunny ears on the table and strolls out into the rest of the board, egg in hand.</p>

            <p>&quot;All the time some nasty person goes and breakses the nice jukesbox, precious, and we grow so tired of having to change the songses on it to go the length they are supposed to.&quot; muttered a mini-Aragog, crawling over a Meganium to reach the jukebox. It paused. &quot;And now we&#39;ve forgotten what we needs to do to fix the jukesbox, oh joy.&quot; Temporarily lost, it resorted to hitting a side panel with its head, which resulted in two more songs suddenly playing alongside the current one for a few seconds before all three ceased entirely.<br><br>Suddenly, something in the ceiling gave off a low whirr, and the dimmed lights returned to their previous brightness. The mini-Aragog glanced upward, noting with pleasure that some mechanical creature appeared to have patched some of the circuits and was now descending on a nearby pillar.<br><br>&quot;Thanks you, precious,&quot; the tiny acromantula said, scuttling over to the other entity, which, the mini noted with satisfaction, was also spider-like in appearance. &quot;Now if you would be kind, would you deign to be fixing the jukesbox over here?&quot; The other arachnoid perked up, scuttling over the the jukebox and prying another panel off of the back. As the new arrival scanned the innards of the device, the mini-Aragog sighed in relief. Now if something was broken, the blame wouldn&#39;t fall on its cephalothorax. Clicking its pedipalps in satisfaction, the mini scuttled off to go find something else to do.<br><br>((This is a specific mini-Aragog, by the way. When I was looking through the list of unadopted mini-Aragogs a while back, I saw that one of them was named <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041029201059/users.adelphia.net/~sandragon/Mini-Aragogs.html">Death Easters</a>. How could he <i>not</i> be invited to work at this party?))</p>

            <pre><code>    A tall skinny fellow with purple eyes and crazy white hair stumbled into the vaguely described portion of the Board that was to serve as a ballroom. He wished for the fifty-third time in the last two minutes that he hadn’t looked at the giant invitation nailed to the Board as he tripped over his feet and landed with a smack on the floor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   The accursed invitation had been written in urple ink of all things, and it had burned itself into his eyeballs. Still the words floated, transfixed in front of his vision wherever he looked:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…No Sues or Cute Animal Friends permitted,&lt;br&gt;Always expect the Spanish Inquisition!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…A spork of your choice,&lt;br&gt;Some sort of Easter item…&lt;br&gt;Chocolate will be served.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…Oh yeah. Beware the Llamas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Those words had plagued him for the last week- it had completely ruined reading for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    And now he was headed to this ball that had plagued his thoughts (and his poor eyeballs) for the past seven days, to see if, at last, the words would fade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Agent Legacy (because that’s who he was) looked up from the floor in time to see an angry man in red vestments bustle past, muttering about… fluffy pillows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Legacy got to his feet and dusted off his white suit, looking about the room. There was a slow trickle of people entering the room, and already a small crowd had gathered at some sort of dance floor. A row of tables to the left of the dance floor bore a small army of snacks, almost all of them chocolate. Generic music played in the background. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  “…Quaint.” He said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  “Brwaamph.” Said something behind Legacy. He whirled to see…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  …A llama.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; (Dramatic music! Boy, do I LOVE this!)&lt;br&gt;

            <p>Another Boarder walked through the door, adjusting his glasses and flinching as the motion of his arms prompted the spider robot hanging on his back to struggle for a better grip. Three mini-Agents walking just behind him took advantage of the pause to scramble into the room, eying the chocolate-filled bowls on a nearby table with undisguised glee.<br><br>&quot;Well, this seems like someone expected a much bigger turnout than there was,&quot; Outhra said, looking around the outrageously massive ballroom and comparing it to the small number of people filling it. He glanced down at the mini-Agents, who were shifting back and forth anxiously. &quot;Go have fun, you guys. Don&#39;t climb on people without their permission, though. And don&#39;t harass those... are those llamas?... those llamas over there. I don&#39;t want anybody getting trampled today.&quot;<br><br>Cackling, Cadamr dashed off to one of the large unoccupied patches of the floor, quickly followed by Accadia and MakesThings. Outhra watched them carefully for a few moments. They&#39;d been ordered not to bring anything sharp to the party, but it would have been just like Cadamr to smuggle in some toothpicks or something and start sword-fighting the chocolate mascots. After he was convinced that they weren&#39;t going to do anything more hazardous than irritating people, he placed the spider robot down on the floor.<br><br>&quot;Go on,&quot; he said. &quot;Go mingle.&quot; The robot glanced around the room in a series of quick, jerky motions. Noticing a flaw in the electrical system, it immediately climbed up a nearby column and started tinkering. Outhra blinked. &quot;I meant go mingle with the mini-Aragogs, but that&#39;s fine too. It&#39;s not like I brought you here to do that or anything.&quot;<br><br>He shrugged and walked over to a central table, where a handful of other Boarders had gathered. Someone nearby was slowly covering the entire floor around himself in a low mound of rabbits, the creatures too confused to hop away and thus quickly becoming covered under a mountain of their own kind. Outhra was glad he wasn&#39;t on that end of the table. He wasn&#39;t sure how he&#39;d deal with the situation if the rabbits suddenly realized what was going on and decided en masse to stampede. He wasn&#39;t sure if rabbits stampeded, but considering the circumstances, he wasn&#39;t going to disqualify the possibility.<br><br>Outhra turned and waved to a nearby Boarder who was holding a handful of chocolates. He immediately regretted doing so. He was almost certain most people didn&#39;t actually wave when they were only about five feet away. Either way, he carried on, trying to cover up his mild embarrassment.<br><br>&quot;Hi,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you know how long that guy over there&#39;s been tossing out rabbits like that? I just got here, and I&#39;d like to know about how much longer we have before this area starts re-enacting Night of the Lepus.&quot;<br><br>((I was going to send in one of my agents, or maybe a Dalek, but since this is non-canon, why not involve a version of me?))</p>

Not that these were in easter eggs, but the point still stood.<br><br>She pulled irritably at her ever-frizzy brown hair, thankfully bound into a manageable braid, and looked up. There was a Boarder awkwardly trailing off a wave and looking at her. She flicked her hand in her own wave, enthusiastically. Of course people waved when they saw someone. Well, she did, at least. She&#39;d never seen anyone else do it.<br><br>He asked about the rabbits that were now piled up so high as to cover the table, nearly. Well, they were both confused.

            <p>Agent-to-be Chris entered the room with a confused expression and a bag of jellybeans. &quot;We can try to understand/The New York Times&#39; effect on a man,&quot; the Bee Gees crooned from the jukebox. &quot;Whether you&#39;re a brother or whether you&#39;re a mother, you&#39;re staying alive, staying alive. Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking and we&#39;re staying alive, staying alive...&quot;<br><br>It was a nice catchy song, but Chris wasn&#39;t much of a disco person. He walked over to it and nearly tripped over a three-foot-tall spider. &quot;Ow! What the...&quot;<br><br>On closer inspection, the spider bore a name tag reading &quot;Jorden.&quot; &quot;Be careful!&quot; it hissed. &quot;Nassty place for Mini-Aragog, yes precious. Clumssy folk all over. No fishes, no eggses.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh...sorry about that. My name&#39;s Chris. Could you move out of the way, please?&quot; Chris asked politely. &quot;I&#39;d like to change the music.&quot;<br><br>Jorden blinked all eight red eyes, then scuttled off to converse with some kind of fire demon. Chris chuckled over the strangeness of HQ, then finally made his way to the jukebox. <i>Wow, I&#39;ve never heard of half these bands,</i> he thought as he flipped through the selection. One song by a group called &quot;Soft Cell&quot; caught his eye. He pressed play, filling the room with the iconic funky bassline of &quot;Tainted Love.&quot;<br><br>And that was how a girl in a blue denim jacket and ratty jeans found him; standing in the corner with his Meganium, awkwardly grooving to &quot;Tainted Love&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Happy Easter!&quot; she smiled. Chris looked up, surprised to see another person. &quot;You&#39;re new, aren&#39;t you? My name&#39;s Rina Dives. I just joined last month. Ooo, jellybeans! Can I have some for my friend Randa?&quot;<br><br>&quot;OK,&quot; Chris said. He handed the bag over to her and she stuffed it in her jacket. &quot;I&#39;m Chris, by the way. Let&#39;s sit down so we can talk better.&quot;<br><br>Then someone yelled &quot;BUNNY FIGHT!&quot; and he got hit in the arm with something fluffy. Meganium picked the fluffy thing up with its head and brought it around to Chris. It turned out to be a cute brown rabbit with a sign around its neck: &quot;Free to a good home.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Awww, what a cutie-pie,&quot; Rina cooed. &quot;Your Meganium looks super healthy! Is he your starter? How long have you had him?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, we&#39;ve been a team for about nine years,&quot; Chris replied. &quot;He&#39;s almost like my best friend.&quot;</p>

            <p>Did you have permission from Randa or Iximaz to use their agent?

            <p>That means that you were in the prime timeframe to read all of the new Blackout stories fresh from their keyboards! It was fun when I was watching everything unfold, but I think it would have also been a lot of fun to come in as you did, just in the wake of an important yet impermanent event that a large portion of the Board got involved in.<br>By the way, do you still have the translocator I gave you when you first arrived? i was looking up your newbie thread, and I just found out that I gave you that. I think you&#39;re the only newbie I&#39;ve ever given a teleportation device!<br><br>So, this is probably a little late, but happy one-year anniversary! It&#39;s already been said that you&#39;re pretty awesome, so I don&#39;t need to reiterate that, but on a more individual level, it&#39;s great to see that someone else who joined around the same time I did is still here! The March-April 2013 batch of newbies doesn&#39;t have a lot of members left(Are we the last ones? Maybe.), and I&#39;ve always liked seeing you around!<br><br>And you&#39;re not alone in your long wait for Permission. I&#39;ve never even applied, in part because I&#39;m insanely nervous about the quality of my Permission piece, and in part because any time I try to write one, I either ditch the idea or decide it would be too long for reasonable Permission limits if it was going to be any good. At least laziness is easy to explain.<br><br>Oh, drat, I&#39;m making this about me again, aren&#39;t I? It&#39;s <i>your</i> party, and it should be treated as such. That said, I&#39;ve prepared a cake! Most people have already eaten, with the free chocolates and all, but I wouldn&#39;t want you left out!</p>

            <p>Having checked the files, I can confirm that.

            <p>So out of that full third of a year, there are only four people who stuck around into 2014 without falling into the &quot;long hiatus&quot; category. The newbie turnover rate is even higher than I&#39;d expected. Granted, not a lot higher, since I had already anticipated being among the last of my batch, but there are even more never-realized newbies than I thought there would be. Well, if you&#39;re anywhere nearby, DemonFiren and Lenore Snow, feel free to help yourselves to the anniversary cake!<br><br>Did you find your flash drive with all of the Board post data saved on it, or did you make a new one? I remember you saying that you lost it a while ago, and if you haven&#39;t found it again yet, compiling all of the thousands of Top Fifteen Poster posts must have taken a lot of work!</p>

            <p>And has apparently gotten worse in the past... month and a half. Or at least, <i>something</i> has. Here&#39;s the number of unique IPs visiting the Board per day since last March:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/IPPerDay-1.png"><br><br>You can see we had an April-June dropoff last year, followed by a slow climb - followed by a <i>massive</i> collapse beginning at the start of March this year. The number of IPs - and thus, we have to assume, the number of people - visiting the Board has <i>halved</i> in the last two months.<br><br>The number of posts, though, don&#39;t seem to have followed suit - March had more than any month since, wow, last May. And, actually, April and May last year - the months of the dropoff - had unusually high post totals. The heck, guys? We post more, and less people visit? How does <i>that</i> work?<br><br>I did actually find my memory stick eventually, thank the stars - I should probably have mentioned sooner! So I once more have my list of the ~1500 people with recorded posts on the Board, and their precise breakdowns. I even have a new graph calculating the number of current Boarders at any one time (not <i>posters</i>, since people could miss a month or two, but <i>Boarders</i>); it looks like this:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/BoarderCount.png"><br><br>(Note the one-month spikes in &#39;08 and &#39;11 on the blue plot - those are Badfic Games! Also note that this is a far longer timescale than the other graph)<br><br>Yeah, that one&#39;s a bit depressing, too. I&#39;m hoping it will turn out to be an artefact of some kind.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I tend to agonize over things like this, but if I don&#39;t actually get anything sent in, I&#39;m never going to see if I would have succeeded. Actually, I think I&#39;m going to roll up my prompts with the new Permission system now. Even if I don&#39;t get to them for a few days, it&#39;ll be a first step, and the way most of the new prompts are structured, I&#39;d definitely be able to keep them to a manageable length.<br>Hmm. The grid I landed on after my random roll is kind of one-character-centric. Would I be able to choose a second prompt to be centric to the other character, which would make three stories total? I don&#39;t want to show character moments leaning too steeply toward only one of my agents in my Permission request, but I don&#39;t know if it would be a bad thing to throw the chosen prompt/random prompt dichotomy out of balance.<br><br>Oh, right, I never actually sent that next RP post! Argh! I will write it up tonight. Should I just attach it to this thread? I imagine it would be annoying for both of us to look for the original Purim RP thread in the future. It&#39;s probably four pages away by now.<br><br>While I&#39;m at it, I should get around to finishing the Dalek-centric Continuity Council Epilogue that I was planning to put up somewhere when everyone else was writing them, didn&#39;t finish in time, and never found a spot where it would be appropriate to bring up. Fearn is fun to write, but as it stands now, he sort of just went away after the time streams were put back in place, with it being ambiguous whether he actually <i>accomplished</i> anything. That won&#39;t do.</p>

            <p>...as you said, the Purim RP is so far down the Board it would be a pain to search for it. Just a question: for how long do you want the exchange to continue? I&#39;m game as long as you are. <br><br>As for your Permission piece, I&#39;d suggest choosing a prompt that gives equal screen time for both of your agents.

            <p>I&#39;m not sure how much longer I&#39;d prefer. I&#39;d like to see the exchange go on for a little longer, but since the rest of the party is over, I&#39;m not sure how far a continuation would best work. Then again, since one of the conversants is a Time Lord and the other is temporally sensitive, we could easily use this as an opportunity for time-displacement meta-shenanigans.<br><br>I&#39;d like that as well, but it looks as though part of the point of the new process is that one part of the new Permission piece-set would be randomly selected to ensure that the applicant is able to adapt. Just choosing <i>all</i> of the Permission prompts that one would use during the request might defuse that concept. This is assuming I didn&#39;t misinterpret its intent, of course.<br><br>It was only going to be one of the epilogues. I <i>do</i> have a Dalek Council-based sequel in mind, but at this point I have no idea how it&#39;s going to end, which is going to be a problem because endings are sort of super-important, and a few of the plot elements I&#39;m working with are currently ambiguous at best.

            <p>...how about we have three replies each and we see if we want to go on from there? <br><br>Point taken on the Permission prompts.

It&#39;s a blatant Star Wars rip off (there&#39;s even a podracing scene, except with birds instead of speeders) and it&#39;s good(life) versus evil (rot).<br>But my biggest problem with the movie was that the chosen one to save this world was a human who was shrunk down. They manage to deal with the concept well but I think that it would have been much better had it just been about the Djinn (the tiny people living in the woods) and their fight against the rot.<br>That and one of the fight scenes would have been even more epic without music, in my opinion.<br>So, does anybody else know of movies like that, where the world itself was amazing but the introduction of someone from ours lessened the coolness?</p>

            <p>Most of the stories I like have been high fantasy. It can go just fine without a character from our world, as long as they feel like people we can relate to.<br><br>But if your world is to crazy you might need to have a character that is more normal, to ask questions for the audience  </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been having a hard time finding some good fanfiction that shows romantic relationships between my favorite characters. I&#39;m particular toward Gambit/Rouge, Nightcrawler/Scarlet Witch, and Storm/Black Panther, but honestly anything&#39;s fine. <br><br>I&#39;d also love anything that shows  platonic relationships within the X-men, or family fics. Just as long as it&#39;s not really angsty.</p>

            <p>Hey there, PPC Board!<br><br>I am in need of a little bit of advice. I&#39;m not happy with the results that <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9697398/1/The-Vexos-Chronicles-Part-I-Lost-Luster">my crossover</a> is generating, and I want to know if I am overreacting, and if not, what I can do to fix it.<br><br>My fic is currently nine chapters long (with more on the way), but it only has eight reviews and seven favorites. Furthermore, the view count generally <i>decreases</i> with each succeeding chapter. I can understand that not everyone who sees a story follows through for whatever reason, but for the view count to go from 350 for Chapter 1 to 44 for Chapter 8 is disconcerting: people seem to be dropping away with each succeeding chapter.<br><br>I know that it isn&#39;t SPaG errors: between me and my beta, we&#39;ve done a good job at catching them. Could the relatively small size of the Bakugan fandom account for it? Or perhaps the fact that crossovers don&#39;t tend to get as many views and reviews as single-fandom stories do? Personally, I fear that I&#39;m somehow failing to attract readers&#39; attention, or keep them attracted as the chapters go on.<br><br>So, in short, I&#39;m open to advice. Am I overreacting? And if not, how can I make my fic better?</p>

            <p>From what I&#39;ve read so far, the consensus seems to be that I am overreacting. That&#39;s comforting to hear. And as for those of you that have said &quot;write for yourself, not the reviews,&quot; don&#39;t worry. As I mentioned, there are still chapters on the way, and goodness knows that I have big plans down the line for the <i>Vexos Chronicles</i>. But if any of you are fans of either Pokemon or Bakugan and have the time, please give my story a read. Concrit never goes out of style.</p>

            <p>The first one is sheer luck. You can have the best fic in your fandom, but if by pure chance nobody looks at it it won&#39;t be successful.<br><br>The second one is the crossoverability (is that even a word?) of the two series. If the two series share nothing with each other, chance are that people who like one don&#39;t follow the other and so ignore it. Or maybe they know both series, but think their themes are too different to work together.<br>For example, my own fic is a crossover between Madoka Magica and Lyrical Nanoha, and is doing very well. The two series are both in the same genre (Magical Girl series with a serious plot) and, while their main themes do clash, it&#39;s the kind of clash that actually makes the plot instead of distracting from it.<br><br>And the third one... wait, I can&#39;t think of a third one...</p>

            <p>I would think that it being a crossover doesn&#39;t help it gain hits. I tend to avoid even looking at crossovers unless the summary makes me really believe that there is a reason I would like to see those characters together. And of course, that is subjective to me. For some reason someone has decided that a Battle Star Galatica charatcer needs to appear in Haven. Honestly, I despise BSG and will probably never click on that fic no matter how much I like Haven. There is a fic that has Tony Stark land in Haven, and I might someday get bored enough to read that one, since Tony really doesn&#39;t like magic, and the Troubles tend to ignore the laws of physics. But I haven&#39;t read it yet, because I prefer not to think of Haven as being in the same setting as the Marvel movieverse.<br><br>So, yeah, crossovers in particular are hard sales. Then there are all those people who click on it, read a paragraph or two and decide this isn&#39;t for them, and the people that go back to your story, hit chapter one and then bounce up to the newly posted chapter. It is kind of neat that ffnet tracks the hits on each chapter, but I would expect chapter 1 to always drastically outstrip the rest.<br><br>The point about WIP&#39;s is very true, also. There is nothing worse than getting into a story, then the author not finishing it. Most of the time, I won&#39;t pay much attention to one that isn&#39;t finished, unless that author already has a sterling reputation when it comes to story completion.<br><br>I hear you on the wishing for more reviews and likes. Those things are addicting! Mine, I know people are still clicking on it. The number of hits keeps creeping up, but I haven&#39;t gotten a comment or kudo from the last 150 hits or so. Every time I check my dashboard, I&#39;m like, &#39;Come oooon, new comment!  Darn. Oh well, at least got another hit.&#39; Considering how very tiny the Haven fandom is on AO3, I&#39;m really not sure where this continuing trickle of hits is coming from, really, but I do like seeing them. :D<br><br>Still, you really have to write the story because it makes you happy to do so, not because of the accolades it can bring you. Seeing the hits, likes, and reviews is awesome, but if their numbers are going to bother you so much, you may need to take a few deep breaths and refocus on why you started writing this story in the first place. (Unless it was purely to get hits, then ignore that last bit and go write short shipfics of the two most popular characters)</p>

            <p>most of us are never going to write a fic that gains a huge following and becomes well known.  That doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s a bad story, just that it doesn&#39;t have the exposure.  There isn&#39;t really any way to advertise fanfiction, so we basically just have to rely on Pit users searching for stuff they like, and coming across our story--and that still doesn&#39;t guarantee they&#39;ll read it through to the end.<br><br>Out of curiosity, let me peek at my old fic&#39;s stats . . . wow, they&#39;ve made this a lot harder to read than it used to be . . .<br><br>So, out of eighteen chapters, the first one has 504 views, and the second has 124.  Three of the remaining chapters have more than fifty views, while all the rest have less than fifty.  I&#39;ve also received a total of seven reviews and three favorites, even after the story has been sitting on the Pit since 2008.  Your story has already beaten mine, by those counts.<br><br>The Pit just isn&#39;t a reliable source of exposure or concrit, basically.  That doesn&#39;t mean you should stop writing; just make it the best story you can, and maybe someday it will gain a bit more acclaim.</p>

            <p>And sometimes they&#39;ll just wait for there to be more developments so they can binge-read chapters, or wait until things are finished. A lot of people dislike WIPs and will just wait for it to be completed to read/review.<br><br>It&#39;s a natural thing, don&#39;t worry. Write for yourself, not the reviews.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your input. I do write for myself, not the reviews; I truly believe that my story&#39;s a good one. But given that there are stories out there that generate reviews from the first chapter alone, I want to be sure that nothing&#39;s amiss. (Granted, the pace of my story is such that expecting a ton of reviews to come from the first chapter would be unreasonable, but I hope that my point is nonetheless clear.)</p>

I am a guy, my favorite color is bright green, and I like anime, manga, books, movies, video games (especially Bioshock and Planetside 2) along with Hobby Class R/C and editing and reading fanfiction.

If any of you have any tips or greetings, then please, give them!  I would also like to show you guys a Hub Document for an idea I stumbled across one day.

            <p>Thanks, I like both Mario AND popcorn, SCORE!  Hub Doc, yeah i&#39;m proud of it.  And about your question... prepare for a rant, MWAHAHAHAHA~<br><br>Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen those little Remote Control cars at Wal-Mart and other such places, but these are, well, different.  Let&#39;s say you jump a wal-mart car off your stairs.  It breaks, no?  Well, something from, let&#39;s say, Traxxas, will laugh in your face and shout, &quot;LET&#39;S DO THAT AGIAN!&quot;  Not to mention if it DOES break, you can find replacement parts that can be either the same or even an upgrade from the standard parts!  You can change everything from the screws to the motor/engine (yes, some of them are GAS/NITRO POWERED), the ESC (Electronic Speed Control), or even the tires and suspension system!  Heck, you can change the REMOTE!  This class of R/C, along with being more durable and able to be repaired, are usually MUCH bigger, and even an electric model can go anywhere from 35 to 70+ MPH OUT OF THE BOX, not to mention being water proof.  There is even an electric model that has two motors, two batteries, and will go 100+ MPH.  The downside?  It&#39;s ALL expensive.  Did I mention that that is just the cars?  There are rock crawlers, airplanes, helicopters, models with actual JET ENGINES, tanks that shoot BB balls, boats, aircraft carriers, battleships that fire, jet boats, submarines, sailing ships, spy drones, fighter aircraft, and some of these are bigger than me?  For reference, i&#39;m 5&#39;9.<br><br>Did I also mention that it&#39;s expensive?  For reference, my Traxxas Slash (cool name included) is roughly 300$.  Here is a few videos showing just how damned CRAZY these things can be:<br><br>Massive Jet: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrQPr1ZZCvA&amp;list=PLJrxZRfqxDn2A80GJ2EauIRO_N8mfqEj5"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrQPr1ZZCvA&amp;amp;list=PLJrxZRfqxDn2A80GJ2EauIRO_N8mfqEj5">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrQPr1ZZCvA&amp;amp;list=PLJrxZRfqxDn2A80GJ2EauIRO_N8mfqEj5</a></a><br><br>BB Tanks made of actual steel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQexdLH7kAU"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQexdLH7kAU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQexdLH7kAU</a></a><br><br>Slash video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJwFXm3W21o"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJwFXm3W21o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJwFXm3W21o</a></a><br><br>By the way... these are expensive.</p>

            <p>Oh, no worries!  I actually did read the constitution, and I know people have lives, but I was just asking, making conversation.  I&#39;ve prowled the wiki for a while, so yeah, and  I&#39;ve read a bit of the original series, but not all of it.  I think I was at the chapter with the Amazonian Sue?

            <p>Wow!  A fluffy Velociraptor!  I&#39;ll have to find it a collar... Also, you really should try RWBY.  If you don&#39;t like that kind of stuff, no worries, but if you like gunblades, anime, and humor... then this is a must watch.  One of the main characters has an HCSC (High Calibre Sniper Scythe).  It is hilarious, and by rooster teeth, the creators of Red vs. Blue.  Also... what floating cat?</p>

            <p>If you were here for the last Badfic Game, you may remember my alter-ego JayBird posting a story &#39;for a friend&#39;. It was described as canon-friendly Jay/Acacia slash - not something that necessarily happened, but something which <i>could</i> have happened, off-screen.<br><br>And it was <i>heaps</i> of fun to write. So I decided to write some more.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idHDc_w73h6mHz7t6P6xLuuNak6DofzvBICARJVViu4/pub">Near Misses</a> - the original Jay/Acacia (which I think got named Byrdtree).<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10kHxFcbrrN-kS0-5FAvc_kAZ12zj2_iHjgEPLkatIE0/pub">Rejection</a> - Selene/Dafydd.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-_a2DzzqizVpZA5DcZoaU6CR5MqqE5Cqj4vsvJE4AE/pub">First Sight</a> - Constance/... well, read it and see.<br><br>All three stories are targetted somewhere around PG-13 - there is discussion of sexual matters, but no actual sexing.<br><br>As to canonicity... well, like I say, they&#39;re canon-friendly. These are stories which <i>could</i> have taken place - but there&#39;s no firm evidence either way. If you ship the pairings, you can believe they happened; if you don&#39;t, you don&#39;t have to.<br><br>However, the <i>non</i>-ship details <i>are</i> canonical. Things like the Medical-Operations &#39;cold war&#39; (mentioned in <i>First Sight</i>), which have never been mentioned before, but are canonised in these stories. If and when they make their way onto the wiki, the reference/link should make the semi-canonical state of affairs clear. (And heaven knows what we&#39;ll do about the shippy side of things... &#39;According to one account&#39;?)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>And the challenge/request: I&#39;ve pretty much exhausted my supply of agents for this. Everyone else either doesn&#39;t spend enough screentime with anyone (as you can see, I try for five or six scenes to extend), or is actually in a relationship with them (which would make the &#39;canon-friendly&#39; part redundant). Or at least, I think I have. If you can think of any other agents of mine who I could do this to, I&#39;d be very grateful, because it&#39;s heaps of fun. ;)<br><br>And since it <i>is</i> heaps of fun - do <i>you</i> have agents you could do this to? They need plenty of screentime together, to not be in a relationship with each other, and to not be firmly stated <i>not</i> to be in such a relationship.<br><br>(And on that note - how do we feel about people writing &#39;canon-friendly&#39; stories about other people&#39;s agents? Since it&#39;s fanfic, not new canon, I&#39;m not as sure as I would otherwise be...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;d love to see what you could make of Morgan/Notary. I know there aren&#39;t that many moments they share, but that&#39;s mostly because the Notary hasn&#39;t shared all that many moments with anyone except Wobbles, and shipping Wobbles with anyone at all... kinda makes me uncomfortable. =]</p>

            <p>I like all three of these stories, although if you had to press me for specifics I&#39;d probably say &quot;Rejection&quot; was my favorite. (I&#39;ll get into reasons why in just a moment.) The format of the stories -- the little vignettes jumping forward through time -- worked really well. It gives the reader a sense of how these relationships are progressing in a very efficient manner. One of my favorite shipfics, &quot;Maslow&quot;, had a similar structure to it. We don&#39;t need to see every moment the characters are together and possibly say something flirtatious (something that many writers of bad shipfics and slashfics forget), just the most pertinent ones.<br><br>I can&#39;t say too much about &quot;Near Misses&quot; canon and character-wise because it&#39;s a been quite a while since I&#39;ve read the Original Series. From what I recall, this seems very faithful and realistic to the characters of Jay and Acacia. I will say that I might have liked it a bit more if it had ended right after the line <i>&quot;I think I might do.&quot;</i> That, to me, felt like it would have had more oomph.<br><br>&quot;Rejection&quot; was my favorite, as I mentioned. It is so rare to see what is almost an anti-shipping fic. Not in the sense of bashing the concept of shipping (that&#39;s very un-rare), but more that it doesn&#39;t end how most shipfics end. There is no happy ending. The confession of affection fails. I also like the gradual decline from silly to serious and sad.<br><br>&quot;First Sight&quot; felt the weakest of the three to me. It was still pretty darn good, but I wasn&#39;t as involved in the story as I was with other two. The wide swathe of characters that appeared made doing so a bit difficult, particularly regarding the agents I wasn&#39;t familiar with.<br><br>All in all, very nice work.</p>

            <p>Still fun, but difficult. The problem is that the only person Constance spends more than one story around is Dafydd - and they end up together anyway. So I had to write the story you&#39;ve seen - and that involved giving poor Connie an obsession verging on neurotic. It worked okay when she was 13, but when she&#39;s <i>twenty-four</i> and still doing it... well. Yeah.<br><br>&#39;Rejection&#39;, on the other hand, might well be canon.

Or someone who likes to use disguises to alternate their physical sex on alternate days? Or... well, the two situations that show up in the story.

            <p>The thing about romantic/sexuality words is that they either have to proliferate until there&#39;s no tomorrow, or be eliminated entirely. We have words to distinguish which gender you&#39;re attracted to (specifically with reference to your own) - so why <i>don&#39;t</i> we have words for, say, having a strong preference regarding hair colour? If you really are only interested in redheads (say), why doesn&#39;t that qualify for a noun of its own?<br><br>Historically, the answer is &#39;because society cares to a fanatic extent about gender, but not about most other things&#39;. But that&#39;s changing - slowly, but it is. In a certain theoretical future world, sex/gender will be as irrelevant an issue to society at large as hair colour. Which, ultimately, I suspect means that people will stop seeing those things as a big part of their identity. &#39;Gay Pride&#39; would become as nonsensical as &#39;Hazel-Eyed Pride&#39; - because no-one would care either way, so why get agitated about it? That&#39;s the ultimate end of &#39;normalisation&#39;, and I&#39;m really trying to think of a historical example that doesn&#39;t still have repercussions, but it&#39;s not proving easy. So maybe I&#39;m being over-optimistic - humans ain&#39;t that good at letting go. But <i>imagine we are</i>.<br><br>In that theoretical future, will we abandon words like &#39;gay&#39; entirely? Or will we start proliferating words for every other preference, too? The answer, I suspect, lies in how useful they are - is it easier to turn down a proposition by just saying &#39;no thanks, not interested&#39;, or by saying &#39;no thanks, I&#39;m russosexual&#39;? (That&#39;s as in &#39;russet&#39;, not as in &#39;I only sleep with people named Russ&#39; - though that could be a thing too!). Um... probably the latter, because how can you argue with &#39;my biology/psychology says no&#39;? So what it really comes down to is, is it enough of an advantage to bother with learning all the words?<br><br>Darn, two types of human laziness running into each other. Most epically halfhearted fight ever?<br><br>hS, rambling again</p>

It seems to become less urgent as she gets older, just a fading dream that she&#39;s still hanging onto simply because it&#39;s her dream, even though she&#39;s realizing it may not be very likely.

            <p>I never settle on one group long enough for this form of shipping to work.

            <p>Ooh, ooh, I know! Morgan/Agent. Because I give permission for basically all of my agents to be used in endeavours such as these, and the Agent did at one point like Morgan (because she looked like Romana).<br><br>As for my own, of course Agent/Disentangler would be feasible since they have their crazy suicide pact thing and they&#39;ve know each other for so long, but they aren&#39;t in a relationship (as far as I know anyway).<br><br>And for shipping, I feel like it&#39;s fun to have Agents speculate on other Agents&#39; relationships in-universe, and in the Badfic Game to write shipping goodfic because I would honestly love to see other people take on my own characters.

            <p>Morgan/Agent might be difficult - there&#39;s the Continuity Council, of course, and I think they met a couple of times during the Blackout? But it would still make for a very truncated story.<br><br>Agent/Dis, however, would totally work. They&#39;re close enough to have real moments you can go &#39;hey, what if they--?&#39; about - just like J&amp;A - and there&#39;s enough &#39;footage&#39; (particularly if you include Tawaki&#39;s) to make it feasible.

            <p>Earlier I was thinking about such things as Bad End and the Hostile Hostel, and wondered what it would be like if there were a whole neighborhood of &#39;malignant architecture&#39; as it is called. There&#39;s not anything concrete yet, but it&#39;s an interesting idea.<br><br>So, can anybody think of a misspelled building (or any type of architecture at all, statues, sculptures, skyscrapers, anything at all) that might appear in such a place?</p>

            <p>Well there could always be stachoos - statues with a sneezing problem.<br><br>I could also imagine, in a neighbourhood like that, that certain canonical and non-mispelled things might like to move in - e.g. Weeping Angels (didn&#39;t somebody find a Weeping Angle once?), gargoyles, Blockers etc. Perhaps they&#39;d be the only residents to dare live in such buildings...<br><br>On a related note: how about the Witch Wall from OFUM?</p>

            <p>I reevaluated myself with the canon-compliant test, and I wound up with Seer of Space. I actually think that fits me a lot better than Knight of &quot;Keys&quot;/Mind, since regardless of how awesome psionic powers would be, I would work much better in a passive class. Plus, the Space aspect combined with Seer would mean that my primary ability would be observation and analysis of the Medium, and processing the information that I collect for mutual benefit of the rest of the session. It would be equally useful in combat, detecting and assessing enemy encampments from far away, determining spawn patterns, and figuring out the layout of dungeons or other areas to prevent, ambush and find good places to hide. In between battles, I could locate plot-important areas and other zones of sweet loot for myself and various fellow Sburb players, which would help everyone with the all-important &quot;completely breaking the game&quot; aspect of any worthwhile Sburb session. Also, since I&#39;m the Space player, you know what that means! Come on, everybody! Frog hunt on my planet!<br><br>Discussion time: let&#39;s see... let&#39;s start with the basics. Plot twists corner. Which did you like the best, and which did you dislike? For new Homestuck readers, these plot twists contain spoilers, surprisingly enough. My opinions will be a little influenced by the fact that I&#39;ve been reading Homestuck for so long that most of the pre-Act Five elements don&#39;t really seem like plot twists any more, since they&#39;ve been entwined in the story for so long I can&#39;t remember them not being important. So, all of these will come from Act Five or Act Six.<br><br>Favorites: I have two, which might be cheating a little, but they both cover similar ground, so I&#39;m saying they both count. First, Becquerel&#39;s prototyping. With one quick action, not only were several theories about the stuff lying around Jade&#39;s house entirely debunked, the stakes were raised for the rest of the session. If there were any doubts that things just got escalated, the low-level enemy who sent Jade on a wild teleportation chase across all of the Medium cemented that yeah, their entire session is like this now. I almost wish we&#39;d seen a dog-eared teleporting Giclops at some point, but we can&#39;t have everything.<br>I will willingly admit that I was part of the group that thought that the Becquerel-enhanced Jack Noir would eventually become Lord English, because if anyone was likely to become a multiverse-terrorizing monster of horrific might and ferocity, there&#39;s a good chance that it&#39;d be the noted psychopath who has suddenly been gifted with the power to rend reality into tiny little chunks. But hey, him becoming the monster who blew up the trolls&#39; session was a pretty awesome consolation prize. Wait, is that a third plot twist? I&#39;d better move on to my other pick before I start describing entire character pathways.<br><br>Two: Aranea&#39;s sudden reveal as a villain. I have a hunch that this isn&#39;t a lot of people&#39;s favorite, but I absolutely loved it. Not only was it a culmination of several minor plot threads that gave numerous characters their own reasons to interact with her, and not only did it give an alternate-universe ancestor troll some role in the main story, but I just love Aranea&#39;s brand of villainy. Most of the other Homestuck villains were either near-mindless monsters, world-wrecking maniacs, or people who turned maniac due to something in their environment, but Aranea is just this incredibly cold and direct character, wrapped up in a case of warm friendliness. And the thing is, it&#39;s completely genuine. The helpful and somewhat desperate-seeming exposition fairy from half the act ago wasn&#39;t putting up a facade, and wasn&#39;t driven crazy by moral isolation or being taken off her sopor. I really like when a character doesn&#39;t go suddenly adopt the shape of the typical looming and overdramatic archlord when they go evil, and Aranea&#39;s outbreak of antagonism is a great improvement on the type. She&#39;s completely calm and even occasionally cheerful, even as she bursts in after millions of years of inactivity with a plan to rebuild time and stop a reality-threatening godling by literally cutting him off from his past. After all, being more traditionally antagonistic would be out of character. Also, her method of fulfilling her plan by mind-warping Jake and Gamzee(and maybe testing her mind-altering powers on Terezi, but that&#39;d probably just be wishful thinking on my part to justify Terezi&#39;s angst) to act as facilitators both allows for her plan to start out surprisingly subtly(that bit falls apart after she mind-warps Jake, but that&#39;s mainly because nothing is subtle when it involves a sixty-foot orb of light hovering in the sky and screaming &quot;Gadzooks!&quot;) and to distinguish her from her counterpart, Vriska, showing how far the other Mindfang&#39;s developed from her earlier callous self. Also, as I mentioned, all of those minor plot threads villain-Aranea brings together. Just the best. It&#39;s like she was driving the story specifically in her direction for half the act, and didn&#39;t want to show it because getting too directly involved would prevent things from getting where they needed to go.<br><br>Not favorite: The secret treasure, a.k.a. that house-logo-shaped weapon and/or portal that John stuck his hand into. I have always loved how Homestuck can introduce a plot element, leave it somewhere in the background for years on end, and then bring it back into the main fold. It&#39;s been an extremely entertaining and very effective way of telling an intertwined story, especially one of Homestuck&#39;s complexity. The portal-house-weapon&#39;s effects retconned the image of John&#39;s arm, not only in that montage of arm-panels, but directly into the past scenes, and given how great Homestuck had been in the past with their story elements, just retconning in another plot thread and pushing it to a major position in a story already full of dozens of them just seems like cheating.<br>Also, in slightly pettier terms, I&#39;d been working off of a primary image of how Homestuck&#39;s world works for a while, and managed to squeeze a measure of consistency out of its inner workings, but the portal-house-weapon immediately circumvents one of the few core rules of the setting, the time travel mechanic. That&#39;s petty largely because Homestuck has never been averse to defining some new elements of its universe because of or for the sake of a joke.<br>It did make for some entertaining scenes, but now the constant threat of &quot;that thing you just saw never actually happened&quot; is looming over the story. It was bad enough when Doc Scratch was doing it, and at least that guy was both established beforehand as unreliable and drawing from canonical-but-unimportant doomed timelines. Now I&#39;m just concerned that John is going to go and redefine something important at the last second or something.<br><br>...In other news, I appear to have regained my sovereignty in the field of Typing A Whole Lot Of Words. Hooray! Maybe if I pull all of my walls of text together, I can build a mighty castle on my Incipisphere planet! Now, where did I put my towing cables?</p>

            <p>Haven&#39;t known you for very long, but it sounds a lot like you, too.<br><br>Both those plot twists you mentioned took me completely off-guard. (I literally stared at my computer screen with my mouth hanging open for a full minute when Bec got prototyped.) As for Aranea&#39;s thing, I appreciated it a lot for the reasons you described, but more so perhaps because it advanced Vriska&#39;s character development. Vriska is probably my favorite character, partially because I kind of relate to the way she thinks (don&#39;t worry everybody, I don&#39;t kill people to feed my mom) and partially because she&#39;s grown so much as a character.<br><br>She hasn&#39;t changed a whole lot per se, but she&#39;s learned that she makes mistakes and is well on her way to recognizing them and eventually perhaps even to fixing them - actually fixing them, as opposed to being a jerk and blaming everyone else while claiming she&#39;s trying to help. As a person she&#39;s flawed and still unaware of a lot of the flaws, which I also appreciate (I know I&#39;m unaware of the majority of my flaws). Seeing her ancestor making a mistake similar to her own helped Vriska grow a lot, and I love that about her. I certainly don&#39;t agree with most of her actions, but it&#39;s easy (for me) to understand how she thinks and why she thinks that way, and she displayed character development on an absolutely perfect level (in my arrogant opinion).<br><br>I understand your issue with the secret treasure and its effect on John. It threw me for a loop, and I&#39;m still not sure whether or not I like it. (Although John ending up in Caliborn&#39;s &quot;parody&quot; made me laugh so hard I thought I was gonna suffocate.) But it seems to me that &quot;all that stuff you just watched never really happened&quot; has always sort of been in Homestuck. Take the doomed timeline where John went to fight his denizen too early, for instance. We got quite a bit of explanation on why that didn&#39;t happen, but then Vriska&#39;s duel with Jack (didn&#39;t) happen. I seriously thought Jack had killed Terezi and Karkat for a while, then suddenly, Just Kidding! She never even left the meteor. I guess I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s not really new. I still don&#39;t know if I like it.<br><br>I don&#39;t think that John&#39;s sudden ability to time travel without consequences is supposed to make sense by the rules, though. I do agree with you that it would not be cool if he changed some things: for instance, what if he prevented SGrub from ever being invented? The whole thing would never even have happened.<br><br>I don&#39;t really know if I have a favorite plot twist. It&#39;s hard to choose, since the whole thing is, the way I see it, a gargantuan conglomeration of curling twists and turns and whatnot. There are just so darn many! But I guess Bec&#39;s prototyping was one of the best. Left me with a reaction akin to &quot;Uh... Not good? Bad?&quot;<br><br>Although I have to admit, I&#39;m down with the Condescension taking over Alpha Earth. Which sounds so cold when I say it like that, but it took me totally by surprise. She&#39;s a bit stereotypical, but she is a great villain. I can&#39;t wait to see where her part in the story goes. I&#39;m wondering if Karkat&#39;s blood is going to have something to do with it. (She is the same Empress from the time of the Signless, right?)<br><br>Anyway, not to change the subject so much as to gush, I&#39;m just wondering what everybody ships? Personally, I was taken by surprise when I realized I ship Karkat and Terezi so hard it&#39;s not even funny. I&#39;ve never shipped anything that hard before, not even Aragorn and Arwen. Especially since it&#39;s not exactly canon. So what does everyone else do?<br><br><br>Hehe... Can I borrow those towing cables when you&#39;re done?</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have the best assessment of you yet, so I can&#39;t say how well your Rogue of Time title fits your personality. You do have another pretty awesome title, though! Especially if your &quot;stealing&quot; of time means that you&#39;d be able to cut out the intermittent moments between actions. That&#39;s an incredibly useful power! By removing the transition time for motion, you can essentially teleport great distances in milliseconds, by removing waiting time, you can near-instantly complete a process that would otherwise take hours, and you could benefit your allies by shortening the charge times between their uses of super-powerful abilities. Of course, you wouldn&#39;t be able to do any of those on a game-breaking scale unless you hit God Tier, but even without it, that is a really great and versatile ability.<br><br>Yes, a fellow Vriska fan! To me, one of the best parts of the trolls&#39; story is how central a few character interactions are to the entire process, and if it weren&#39;t for Vriska, the entire setting would have unfolded completely differently. Not only did she set off the cycles of spite and revenge that almost killed the whole session, she developed enough to realize how misguided those beginning actions were in the first place. I also love the character development stuff, most of what you already said. I think Vriska gets the best gradual development in the story. Most of the characters either experienced their development through building personality where there hadn&#39;t been a lot previously, or through reacting to specific and individual situations, but Vriska starts out as one person and ends up as someone completely different and more capable of handling themselves, largely through her own actions. That scene at the lip of the crater, where she has that speech about her own past life and her plans for her post-life? The best. Even though she starts getting uncertain about it later after Aranea breaks back into the waking world, I still love it.<br><br>I just wish the interplay with Terezi had gotten a proper resolution, though I suppose the lack of closure ties itself into Terezi&#39;s arc. Terezi never got to close out her own feud with Vriska before the latter died, and Terezi&#39;s still torn up about that, even though if she hadn&#39;t forced a resolution the way she did, Vriska would&#39;ve fought Bec Noir and the rest of the trolls would&#39;ve been wiped out. Yet, Terezi still struggled with the consequences of her decision, despite making the right one. I&#39;m still not happy about her subsequent angst and shacking up with psycho-Gamzee, though. Just because it&#39;s a logical fallout from previous actions doesn&#39;t make it the best or most effective fallout, or in my opinion, it&#39;s not an entirely in-character one either. I know that despair can change people, and her choice to allow Aranea to restore her sight has given her regret at shedding what she formerly thought of as a symbol of her dead lusus and her former life that she hasn&#39;t yet worked through, but I sincerely doubt that the same troll who spent half of Hivebent laughing at the worst of situations, and remained upbeat even after her session had been blown to bits just prior to the moment of victory would spend the better part of a year soaking in juggalo juices because she made a couple of tough decisions.<br><br>While I&#39;m on the subject of stuff that should/could have happened, I wish we&#39;d have had some kind of character structure for Feferi. I mean, all we ever got was &quot;she&#39;s the nice one, even though her unique caste means she doesn&#39;t have to be&quot;. Nice start, but it never really moved beyond that. All she did in the story was provide a springing point for Eridan and Sollux&#39;s arcs, and Eridan&#39;s arc got cut off after the Jack-attack left him in horrible crushing despair and he decided the best way out was to start killing everybody. Nothing really happened with Feferi; there were just too many characters around her squirming for attention, and we didn&#39;t see much outside of the main five trolls: Karkat, Terezi, Vriska, Kanaya, and Tavros. I guess Gamzee and Aradia could get honorary advancement, since they did technically develop, even though their developments consisted of having complete 180s for their personalities, and Sollux did get a little space to himself, but I wish Feferi&#39;d at least gotten a framework of a personality like we&#39;d gotten from the other non-central trolls. Heck, Nepeta proved you don&#39;t need to go all that far beyond framework to be entertaining. Nepeta&#39;s one of my favorites, and I was sad when the opportunity for her to have a spotlight moment post-moirail-death never came to be.<br><br>John ending up in Caliborn&#39;s parody was one of those entertaining scenes I mentioned. I&#39;m not saying that it was all bad, I&#39;m just not fond of the implications of the new powers. I mean, when Homestuck had its &quot;this isn&#39;t really affecting the story&quot; moments before, they were either obvious or revealed to be doomed timeline/jokes/PSYCHEs shortly after the fact. There was just never an undo button before, and I don&#39;t really enjoy the fact that there is one now. Even the Scratch had powerful consequences for future events, but if John mucks with space-time with his new house-powers, he&#39;ll be the only one who knows anything changed, if he even knows that there was a change at all. Yes, it&#39;s clear in-story that John&#39;s unstuck from reality, so it makes in-story sense that he doesn&#39;t have to follow the rules, but it&#39;s narratively problematic.<br><br>Wow, this turned into way more complaining than I thought it would. I suppose it could be considered the mark of a good fan to be able to tell where one&#39;s favorite stories could have been made even better, but I&#39;m not going to commit to that statement, because it reeks of slippery-slope to me.<br><br>Yes, Betty Crocker is the same Condesce as the one that enslaved the Ψiioniic back in the Sufferer&#39;s day. Leader-class trolls apparently are nigh-on immortal until killed, or something like that. I was going to bring up a humorous little continuity error there by linking to Feferi&#39;s introduction page, where it said that Feferi was heir apparent because her blood was even more pure than that of the current empress, but I see Hussie&#39;s edited the page to replace it with a reference to Her Imperious Condescension. Pretty sneaky, Hussie. Dealing with continuity problems by wedging in later continuity. At least it&#39;s a more elegant solution to the problem than the one raised by Jane&#39;s &quot;I feel so <a href="http://media.tumblr.com/ebf1170ee82826b64ec152ec17d47875/tumblr_inline_mgi8lwFuJa1ruqz7p.png">Caucasian</a>!&quot; The <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/trickster.php?s=6&amp;p=007623">new page</a> just seems forced now.<br><br>Well, I tend not to ship anything that&#39;s more than slightly canonical. Evidence takes all the fun out of it! My primary pairing for Homestuck is Eridan/Terezi, because those two psychopaths deserve each other, and I mean that in the best possible way.<br>An AU that a friend and I co-wrote contained the pairing as an ex-flushed relationship, but to be fair, we had Eridan in a lot of weird pairings there, and the AU was written to be deliberately preposterous. I can&#39;t even remember them all, since it was three years ago(and suddenly the passage of time smacks me right in the face), but I distinctly remember one of them involved Eridan self-identifying as Tavros and Vriska&#39;s auspistice, but neither of the other two knew about it. My friend was the only one who actually posted any of it online, and I&#39;ve lost my files(I had a lot of ideas, but was too lazy at the time to actually adapt most of them, so this was bound to happen), so I don&#39;t know if any of the bits mentioning the Eridan/Terezi relationship are up anywhere. Or any of the bits that I was primary writer for, in fact. Well, <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/124945/chapters/176370">Grocery Day</a>, the founding stone of the AU, was something that I made the plot and basic outline for, but he adapted it, so about half of those jokes are his. It&#39;s been years, but I still feel inordinately proud of my joke-premise of the trolls&#39; primary mode of transport being a bus that Nepeta unscrupulously bought on the Internet. The massive Walmart being patrolled by a specially trained platoon of pseudo-military order enforcers was all his idea, though. I think the original draft just had a handful of mall cops or something.<br>You know, I suddenly realized that if readers don&#39;t find the story funny, its entire premise is incredibly dumb. True, that&#39;s how it is for most comedies, but be warned that either the story behind that link might be kind of dumb or I&#39;ve subjected myself to another wave of self-deprecation. Maybe both?<br><br>I don&#39;t know about lending you those cables; it looks like I&#39;m going to be needing them again.</p>

It&#39;s going to be mildly disappointing for me when I finally get around to rereading Homestuck from the beginning when I see those in the Flash animations. One of those was from [S] Wake, dang it! Why did [S] Wake need to be screwed around with? It was so great!<br><br>Oh, right, the pun.

I can hold far more words per post than just that measly 840 that you had when you rain out of room! I fit 1,189 in my &quot;I like my new mythological role&quot; post on this very thread!(Microsoft Word counted the words, not me. I don&#39;t have that kind of patience.) However, I have no idea how I do it, as much as I would like to educate an heir for my twin fields of Self-Indulgence/Self-Deprecation and Writing Just So Many Words, Sweet Grob, Who Is Even Going To Read All Of These Words. Knowing how these things go, you will probably need to go on a several-chapter-long journey of self-discovery. I&#39;ve got a few extra robots to spare if you need a wisecracking sidekick. I&#39;ll just have to put their vocal emitters back in.<br><br>Oh, no, the last one is probably going to be permanently down, if you mean whether there will be any more chapters of Road Trip. That was another one that was plotted and designed by me, and I&#39;ve lost my notes and he&#39;s lost interest. It&#39;s a shame, too, because during the events that I remember from it alone, Tavros gets stuck in the middle of a trash island on a river, Feferi has a chance to drive the bus and sends it careening off of a bridge to avoid hitting a squirrel, and Eridan finds out that Terezi still keeps his gallbladder in a preservative tank back at her respiteblock. He had to have it surgically removed in a past story I wrote when I decided that the trolls should play havoc in a hospital. Terezi and Eridan&#39;s relationship was weird, as I&#39;ve established.<br><br>Hey, then they&#39;re an even better set of powers, since they can facilitate personal growth! Just like my powers would, I suppose. I&#39;d need to constantly fight off the urge to use my newfound near-omnipresence to go on some sort of crazy power trip. Never mind that any attempts that I would have to go on said power trip would be flawed to the point that they collapse in on themselves, because I am just the worst at leaving loose ends everywhere. Double personal growth!<br><br>I can do better than that in terms of Betty Crocker references. For a &quot;make a commercial about a product&quot; project in high school, two friends and I made a commercial about a Crockercorp product that was intended to help the character I played with... general tasks that were never elaborated on in any detail in the commercial itself, only to attack any humans nearby and turn them into drones. It was full of deliberate bad acting(and no costumes of any sort, and corny narration), and as a result is so embarrassing that I&#39;m not going to post the link to it here. You can just imagine it. Unfortunately, I never got to add in the tagline: &quot;Buy one now! Buy several now!&quot; Pointlessly generic, check. Overwrought, check. Sounds like it was made at the last possible second, check. Commercial gold.<br><br>I cried when Kanaya died the first time. Not a lot, but I was sad all day. This is back before we had the ghosts and rainbow drinkers and B2 sprites and the half-dozen other ways to bring people back, so it looked like she was gone forever.<br><br>Hey, Vriska&#39;s a main character! Even if she doesn&#39;t end up striking any decisive final blows like she wanted to at the start of her arc, she&#39;s definitely going to do something significant in the last stretch of the story. She wouldn&#39;t <i>let</i> herself not be important.<br><br>No, you&#39;re fine to not worry. Jade is almost certainly going to be around in some form or another later. They had to cure her of her reality-warping rampage syndrome somehow, and two hundred tons of tower makes for a pretty good suppressant.

Wow, all of these points are in just the wrongest of orders. This is what happens when I reply to two posts at once.<br><br>Let&#39;s see here... according to the MSPA wiki&#39;s character list, it looks like, if we assume Wayward Vagabond was actually dead when alt-Feferi revived him and not just mostly dead, the only characters with any standing in the plot to have never died were Spades Slick, Terezi(her dream self died, but that doesn&#39;t really count as much), and the Peregrine Mendicant. There were some robots and other related inorganic entities there as well, but I excluded them for the sake of convenience, since they can usually be rebuilt or transferred into a new chassis after their destruction.<br><br>Drat, everything being out of order means there&#39;s no best opportunity to end this post.

            <p>Yes, to borrow Roxy&#39;s words: The Robin Hood of Time! Pretty sure it doesn&#39;t get cooler than that. At least for me. Those are some pretty cool powers. Sounds like the sort of thing designed to challenge me, though, as I&#39;m terrible with time management.<br><br>That speech was pretty cool. But yeah, I know what you mean. She&#39;s very 3-dimensional as a character. Actually, I&#39;ve met a couple of people now who refer to her as &quot;the spiderb*tch&quot; and it makes me so mad! Yeah, she wasn&#39;t the greatest person ever and did a lot of bad things, but you can&#39;t just slap the word b*tch on it and leave it at that! There&#39;s so much more to her than that. And like you said, her character development is probably the best, so gradual we hardly notice it. I kinda hope she gets to have another chance at affecting the story, but I won&#39;t be too upset if she doesn&#39;t, because she&#39;s influenced so much of it already.<br><br>I was kind of left wanting more about her relationship with Terezi too. Which is unusual; generally a decisive stab makes for pretty good closure. I suppose that was what was used to facilitate her spending the better part of a year soaking in juggalo juices. But I&#39;ll try to reserve judgement until her arc is over. At the moment, I&#39;m just a little more concerned about her continued survival... Although I don&#39;t suppose it should bug me. After all, I think the only character who has died and not come back (yet?) is Doc Scratch. (Is it bad of me to admit that I&#39;m actually not all that worried about Jade being dead?)<br><br>I read the bit where Terezi killed Vriska right before going to bed and then cried myself to sleep. I haven&#39;t done that since I read <i>Martin the Warrior</i>, which was when I was twelve. It really struck me that I could completely support Terezi in her actions and yet still be incredibly sad that Vriska died.<br><br>Yeh... Feferi. I like her, but I think it might be primarily because she&#39;s just that girl everybody likes. I do think more could have been done with her, but all we really get besides some initial exposition is her breaking up with Eridan and then being friends with Sollux. We haven&#39;t really seen her since she died, too, so I&#39;m wondering if she&#39;ll come back or not. Unfortunately probably not.<br><br>Nepeta&#39;s awesome. She <i>looks</i> like that cute little girl who is so sweet and just loves cute little puppies and kitty cats, but bear in mind that she is one of three characters to have successfully landed a blow on Gamzee, and the only one to do it while he was sober/otherwise in possession of his mental faculties. It was really very awesome, but I expect the fight just didn&#39;t last much longer after that.<br><br>I found a box of Betty Crocker food coloring in one of my church&#39;s cupboards yesterday. Holding the cupboard door open, I turned to the person closest to me and asked, &quot;Why are we supporting the Batterwich?&quot;<br><br>She kinda looked at me funny and said, &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing,&quot; I said, and then I closed the cupboard door.<br><br>... Yeah, I&#39;m probably the only one who finds that funny.<br><br>That story... was actually incredibly funny. The basic concept is ridiculous, but hey, I&#39;ve seen stupider. The bus was actually pretty funny. I read the whole series and I&#39;m currently wondering how it still runs. (Given the premise of the last one, that will probably change soon.) But... yeah. My AU &quot;parody&quot; idea was to get a bunch of the characters stuck in a hotel room with three laptops and a sticky note that says &quot;Don&#39;t read the fanfic.&quot; As I was &quot;plotting&quot; this out in my head, I realized that it would degrade into a cacophony of Karkat swearing up a storm within the first four pages and there were only so many times I could dredge humor out of Terezi licking fan art. So I dropped it, because I don&#39;t think <i>I</i> would read that. But things like that always seem worse to the writer, y&#39;know? I liked your idea.<br><br>As for Eridan&#39;s romances in the story, the only one I noticed was the one where he decided to be Tavros and Vriska&#39;s auspistice. Which was... weird. (Although I am perfectly capable of subconsciously blinding myself to romance I don&#39;t like, so there might have been other things going on I didn&#39;t notice.) Is there a good way for people to be psychopaths?<br><br>Oh, wait... Heh, I can&#39;t believe I just typed that.<br><br>And I&#39;m feeling the urge once again to add loosely related self-indulgent comments. You can probably skip this bit if you want. So I got my brother into Homestuck. I actually got to say, &quot;Let me tell you about Homestuck.&quot; It was awesome. Actually, no, it was stupid. But it was also fun.<br><br>Hang on, I appear to have run out of space.</p>

            <p>At least, if it isn&#39;t it&#39;s one of those classes like the Rogue, where there can be a player outside the standard, but the class usually leans to one over the other. Then again, Word of Hussie recently stated that there can be a female Prince, so the gender restrictions might be a little more flexible than current impressions would suggest.<br><br>To find out for sure, have some <a href="http://inaniloquacity.tumblr.com/post/35681927354/homestuck-title-test">mythological role</a> <a href="http://thepageofhopes.tumblr.com/post/13517446964/homestuck-title-test">tests!</a> Neither of them are perfect, because that first one has a lot of psychological quizzes you need to do before you can determine your results and the test skips over the confirmed male/female restrictions(then again, the only confirmation came from Calliope, who might not have all the answers), and the second is not canon-compliant. I wouldn&#39;t have even posted the second one, but it&#39;s the most well-known test in the fandom, and I think most of the others here got their mythological roles from it. I tested on it myself at first, but I&#39;m going to run through the canon-compliant one soon, because the other one said I was Knight of &quot;Keys&quot;. Never mind that it&#39;s one of the aspects that a friend and I fan-expanded to full size a while back, not only is a fan-expansion not really a basis for much, but a Knight of Keys would be practically worthless.<br><br>Once I run through the other tests sometime later tonight, I&#39;ll post my updated results back on this thread. Also, since there doesn&#39;t seem to be as much discussion of the comic as I thought there would be, I&#39;ll try to start discussing something at the same time. I almost guarantee that fangushing will be imminent.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of situations where a real person is not going to follow the rules of a fictional world.  A guy could be a Witch or Maid, if that was the class that fit.  A woman could be a Page or...other male-only class.  Point is, it works in the fictional world because it is written to work.

            <p>I think your interpretation is a little off.  It isn&#39;t &quot;one who guides themselves with nothing/lack of knowledge&quot;.

            <p>Incidentally, the primary reason I haven&#39;t been around is Homestuck. Read the entire thing, then started again at the beginning, drew fan art, scouted out the internet communities related to it, wrote fanfic, drew fan art, scouted out the fanfic for it, drew fan art, looked at fan art, checked out fan vids, made a study of Rose&#39;s clothing for possible cosplaying, drew fan art, got a friend into it. Drew fan art.<br><br>Anyway, I got a Spark of Time by a test, but the first time I took it I tied for something, but didn&#39;t remember what. Took the test again and got a Rouge of Time. I&#39;m not sure what exactly I would do, but hey, it sounds cool. It sounds like we have most of the players we&#39;d need for a viable session.<br><br>And I&#39;ve felt the need to throw this out there ever since I thought of it: When the kids first got in the game, the whole goal was to beat the game, maybe defeat the denizens. Then the black king and queen raised the scene, then Jack made his appearance. For a while I was wondering if Doc Scratch was going to turn out to be the demon mentioned in one of Sollux&#39;s viruses. Then Lord English and the Condese showed up. This whole thing keeps on getting bigger and bigger, and it seems at the moment that Lord English is going to be the &quot;final boss&quot; so to speak. But there seems to be something similar to the Ironic Overpower and the Narrative Laws of Comedy at work in the Homestuck continuum, and at one point Vriska went on at length about how Lord English was <i>definitely</i> the final boss. Personally, I&#39;m expecting a sudden twist in which he is in fact working for or being manipulated by someone else.<br><br>I think it&#39;s probably Gamzee.<br><br>Homestuck has made a shipper out of me.

            <p>That means you&#39;d steal time (both in the metaphorical and literal sense) from the enemy to benefit your team. Before God-Tier, I think that you&#39;d be able to &quot;steal&quot; time through actions that somehow delay the Reckoning or hinder assassination attempts made by enemies on key targets that are fated to fall (the White King comes to mind). Post God-Tier, you&#39;d be able to make time behave in ways that hinder enemies and boost allies: create slow-time fields around monsters and make your allies move like the Flash, for example. Maybe you could freeze time entirely if you were skilled enough, essentially robbing an entire area of Time itself...<br><br>Speaking of final bosses, I&#39;ve also got my own crackpot theory on how Dave will be able to harm Lord English: if Calliope is a key element in his defeat, then she needs to be brought back to the waking world. One way to do that is by using the Ring of Life, but it&#39;s already in someone else&#39;s hands at the moment. <br><br>The other way is to change the past.<br><br>Every session of Sburb must have a Time player and a Space player. If there&#39;s a Time player, then they must have a planet. If they have a planet, then logically there must also be a Scratch construct on it as well...<br><br>I&#39;m calling it right now: Dave will somehow venture into the Cherub session and set off a Scratch so that he creates a timeline where Calliope dominates Caliborn. That way, Calliope will be able to be brought back to B2 and ready to fight Lord English. </p>

            <p>That&#39;s a good theory. It makes a lot of sense, actually. I&#39;ll be very impressed if that&#39;s what actually happens. But I expect it will be something nobody will see coming.<br><br>Sounds like my racket&#39;s really cool!

            <p>I can see a Thief of Mind acting as a saboteur/assassin, actively denying enemy movements or sowing confusion among their ranks. They wouldn&#39;t seem to be very useful in a direct battle-- Thieves are stereotypically more renowned for their cunning-- but they&#39;d be able to support their teams by killing high ranking Mooks (denial of decision), manipulating the environment, local infrastructure or material resources to force a specific outcome (denial of choice), and destroying information pertaining to their team or important events (denial of memories). <br><br>A Bard of Mind &quot;allows the destruction of [choices/thoughts]&quot; or &quot;invites destruction through [choices/thoughts]&quot;. It seems to me that they&#39;re a classpect specifically designed to sow chaos in the session. </p>

            <p>One of the most joyous occasions. I spent a good portion of it re-watching a bunch of the flashes.

            <p>...to see that she&#39;s really in touch with emotions-- be it hers or others&#39;. If I recall correctly, she drew shipping charts and was hailed as a skilled matchmaker. <br><br>On a more practical basis, one can also interpret Heart as &quot;Soul&quot;. Being guided by/manipulating Soul is actually a very dangerous power, since you&#39;d have a working knowledge of what makes other people tick and all the ways to manipulate them. As a Mage, you have a full understanding of the intricacies of your aspect, allowing you to utilize it to its fullest potential. On the other hand, some fan theorists believe that  Mages tend to suffer the negatives of their aspect. For example, consider Sollux and his repeated deaths (Doom) and Meulin and her tormented romantic life (Heart). Personally, I don&#39;t buy it: the population sample is much too small to generalize. </p>

            <p>Whereas you can provide good fortune and wisdom to the team, I... don&#39;t do much? I won&#39;t lie to you, getting the most obscure classpect sucks. The best I can do is-- if somehow informed of the B1 megacancer and the dream self starting on Derse-- try to get the pick on Jack Noir before he can do too much damage to the session. The dream self will most likely die in the process, but it&#39;s a good trade in the long run: the main form of the Cancer will have been neutralized. <br><br>Afterwards, it&#39;s a matter of completing the planet quest as fast as possible, not being a chicken and God-Tiering when appropriate, and level grinding before the Reckoning. </p>

            <p>I really like the fact that Hussie is going the extra distance for his fans. It really shows how much he cares for the community. I&#39;ll be sure to keep my eye on this thing...<br><br>Ah, a Heart player! With your classpect, our session&#39;s mental health is in good hands. We can move forward without having to fear one player succumbing to Grimdarkness. <br><br>As I recall correctly, Outhra is a Knight of Mind and Snowy is a non-canon class Time player (though in the event the Heir class is not male-exclusive, it would be the closest canonical analogue).

We&#39;ve actually got a lot more repeated aspects and classes than a viable session would have, and I was going to break this into multiple groups to keep from having redundancy, but the only arrangement I could find would leave SeaTurtle separate from the main body, due in part to IntelligentAirhead&#39;s title making this arrangement very difficult, and that wouldn&#39;t be fair, since he started the idea.<br><br>Session:<br>SeaTurtle, Mage of Void<br>Outhra, Seer of Space<br>Snowy the Sane Fangirl, Rogue of Time<br>wobblestheclown, Knight of Life<br>Phobos, Bard of Mind<br>123bugsy, Maid of Heart<br>Lily Winterwood, Monk(non-canon title) of Light<br>IntelligentAirhead, Mage of Heart<br>Elcalion, Seer of Mind<br>firemagic, Maid of Light<br><br>Other:<br>Neshomeh: Unconfirmed &quot;something or other&quot; of Light<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure someone has been left out, since I rearranged this list about three times when I was still trying to make two sessions out of it.

            <p>Agent Linda <br><br>Home continuum: Pokйmon (anime) <br><br>Age: 18 <br><br>Birthday: March 6th <br><br>Department: DF <br><br>Leagues: Sinnoh (was not in any of the tops in the Lily of the Valley Conference), Johto (top 48 in the Silver Conference), and was unable to compete in the Kalos Conference (joining the PPC being the reason) but did get all eight badges <br>(Note: did not compete alongside Ash Ketchum, they competed after him) <br><br>Personality:  Linda is an energetic, social, and bold young lady with a love of adventure and discovery.  She tends to forget her own strength, so she can give pretty hard high-fives and back slaps unintentionally.  She loves to be around people and hates to judge new people when she first meets them, this leads her to being a very easy person to get along with.  It also leads her into being a bit gullible and though she has a strong moral compass, like she wouldn’t smoke just because everyone around her is smoking, she tends to give in to peer pressure, like if everyone says that a certain movie is terrible she will then agree with that popular opinion.  <br>Instating facts:<br>  She loves to draw, so it’s not uncommon to see her doodling in her sketch book form time to time<br>   Her preferred Bleeprin product is Bleepnerds <br>    Linda loves to skateboard <br>   She’s a lot better cook then her bother <br><br>Backstory:  Linda and Dean were just your average Pokйmon trainers, until they got sucked into a plothole.  Lucky for them they were sucked straight into the PPC.  After some explaining, Linda was instantly hooked on the idea of joining the PPC and became an agent alongside her bother.  <br><br>Skills: Linda is an expert when it comes to parings (shipping) she even has an art book dedicated to keeping track of not only her OTPs but her brothers, canon parings, popular fan parings, and popular crack parings.  Linda has an extraordinary amount of patience, gained from her helping/dealing with her younger cousins.  She prefers hand-to-hand combat over long-ranged (mostly due to being a very bad shot) but after receiving a battlespork of zillywut, she has been learning how to wield it properly. <br><br><br>Agent Dean<br><br>Home continuum: Pokйmon (anime)<br><br>Age: 20<br><br>Birthday: Dec. 29th  <br><br>Department: DF<br><br>Leagues: Hoenn (top 20 in the Ever Grande Conference), Sinnoh (winner of the Lily of the Valley Conference, also hall of famer), Johto (top 14 in the Silver Conference), and was unable to compete in the Kalos Conference (joining the PPC being the reason) but did get all eight badges <br>(Note: did not compete alongside Ash Ketchum, competed after him) <br><br>Personality:  On the outside, Dean is a kind, relaxed, and intelligent person but is seems to be very quiet and prefers to be either alone or with Linda.  If you able to get through to his inner self you would find a talkative, adorkable, prankster with a lot more energy than you would expect when you first meet him.  He is also a major gossiper so be careful with special information when you see him close by (though don’t expect him to give up any of this special information, at least without buttering him up a little).  Sometimes when he gets extremely focused on something, he forgets everything else around him, Linda at times has to get him get going or else he would completely lose track of time. <br>Instating facts: <br> Dean can be seen writing in his notebook (his new infinite notebook to be precise) a lot, mostly random ideas he has at the time (and sometimes things he hears while listening on/to others) <br>   His preferred Bleeprin product is NM&amp;NMs <br>    He enjoys sewing and is very good at it <br> He also good at the guitar<br><br>Backstory: Dean and Linda were just your average Pokйmon trainers, until they got sucked into a plothole.  Lucky for them they were sucked straight into the PPC.  After some explaining, Linda was instantly hooked on the idea of joining the PPC, Dean on the other hand was very unsure (to say the least).  After some taught he joined with his sister as his partner.  <br><br>Skills: He is a little far sighted and there for needs glasses, this is not a huge set back as he mostly just needs them for reading.  Dean’s preference in combat is his whip, his father was in the tamer class so was able to teach him how to properly use one, and since joining the PPC he has obtained a different one with a metal spike for a tip.  He also owns a mega pin which he wears on his hat.  <br><br>Extra info: <br>Pokйmon Trainer* <br>The tamer class (<a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tamer_(Trainer_class"><a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tamer_(Trainer_class">http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tamer_(Trainer_class</a></a>))<br>Just to clarify, Linda may still get a mega item of some kind.  I was planning on finding a Mary sue fic in which she has a mega item and taking that one for Linda (hey, it’s not like that sue will be using it any time after that) but that won’t be for a while.  Dean still got a mega item because I thought it would be odd for a hall of famer to not at least be offered one. <br> As usually tell me what needs fixing and/or what needs to be added and I’ll fix it as soon as I can.  :)  <br></p>

Dean’s game file is in Y and you cannot obtain the mega stone for Manectric in that game so I also don’t’ count it that one either.  Also if people would like to borrow them for mission in the Pokйmon continuum you just have to ask.  The reason I’m offering this is because since Linda and Dean come from the anime continuum, which seems to allow the ability to let others borrow Pokйmon without needing to trade them. Plus I think it would be useful option to have there.  Also when Linda needs to mega evolve her Pokemon she just borrows Dean&#39;s mega pin, but if Dean has any mega Pokemon at that moment but still gives her the pin the Pokemon will devolve and vice-versa.

Is she ok, at least? Also thats just plain cute :3&quot;<br><br>And to quote her again: <br>&quot;Pfft yeah she’s fine.

            <p>...are stories about an eponymous university where badfic writers learn to be goodfic writers, taught by the canon characters. The story usually revolves around one badfic writer&#39;s journey to goodfic writer and the important lessons they learn along the way. The first one ever written was Miss Cam&#39;s Official Fanfiction University of Middle-Earth.If you&#39;re at all in the LOTR fandom, I highly recommend it. The Hetalia one is the International Academy of Hetalia Fanfiction, written by our very own Lily Winterwood. I haven&#39;t read it, but I know Lily is a fantastic writer.<br><br>OFUM is here: <a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/644826/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Middleearth"><a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/644826/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Middleearth">https://m.fanfiction.net/s/644826/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Middleearth</a></a><br><br>IAHF is here: <a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6746784/1/The-International-Academy-of-Hetalia-Fanfiction"><a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6746784/1/The-International-Academy-of-Hetalia-Fanfiction">https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6746784/1/The-International-Academy-of-Hetalia-Fanfiction</a></a><br><br>Hope that answers your questions!<br><br></p>

            <p>There are many fandoms that have their own Fanfiction universities, from Harry Potter to Star Trek to Good Omens. A complete list can be found here: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Fanfiction_Universities"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Fanfiction_Universities">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Fanfiction_Universities</a></a>.<br><br>The wiki has a bunch of useful lists and resources, so chances are that it can answer a lot of questions you may have on a variety of subjects concerning any OFU, departments of the PPC, and anything else you might find interesting. It&#39;s also a cool way to kill a few hours if you&#39;re interested in looking for some entertaining tidbits.<br><br>I hope that helps!<br></p>

            <p>Who&#39;s seen <i>The Winter Soldier</i>? <br><br>What&#39;re your thoughts on it?<br><br>Personally, I really enjoyed the whole conspiracy theory part.

            <p>I was in Florida with sporadic Wi-Fi.<br><br>It was absolutely fantastic, though I have to admit I didn&#39;t think about the PPC at all. My thoughts about the conspiracy were mostly &#39;I knew it!&#39;. Not that there was a specific conspiracy with Hydra, but that SHIELD wasn&#39;t all great. I&#39;m not exactly sure where I got that, but my sister pointed out to me that in Thor, SHIELD are kind of the bad guys because they took Jane Foster&#39;s equipment and (mistakenly, but still) tried to kill Thor. Basically, trying to suppress knowledge of anything fantastical. Which was sort of justified but also a tiny bit shady. And the movie where I really started to get into the Avengers fandom was Thor. <br><br>Plus, there was the bit with the weapons in the Avengers movie, and now we see that that was a precursor for the helicarriers. And I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the ethical decisions made in the first episode of Agents of SHIELD.<br><br>I also gained much more appreciation for Cap, I want Falcon to get his own movie, and am glad Black Widow is going to get her own movie.<br><br>So yes, I loved it.</p>

            <p>I loved how the whole thing really shook up the universe and changed what we thought was the status quo.<br>And the realization that SHIELD thought they had been fighting for good and might just have been making things worse, because their resources were being diverted. That was just ... wow!<br><br>This may very well be my favourite of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies so far. And the funny thing is, that I&#39;m not much into Captain America (thought he was a bit dull) so I would probably have skipped this one and caught it later on bluray, except that I had a couple of vouchers for free tickets that I needed to use. And boy, was I glad I did!<br><br>And I have to add that it was nice to see some diversity in the cast and female characters that actually do stuff and are there for other reasons than just to be female. It&#39;s not perfect, no, but it&#39;s good to see that maybe screenwriters are starting to climb down from Hetronormative White Dude Mountain.</p>

            <p>It was funny, because when I leaned over and told my mom, &quot;Oh my god, it&#39;s just like the Black Cats in the PPC!&quot; she just gave a &#39;what on earth are you talking about?&#39; look.<br><br>It was the Reorganization that involved the Flowers running a Sue factory.

            <p>I usually wouldn&#39;t talk about them so long before asking permission, but I once tried to post a version of this character (she&#39;s one of my common OCs, was created for a Fallout: Equestria idea that I haven&#39;t put to paper yet) as a character for a collar, and was rejected harshly on the grounds that she was overpowered, so I&#39;m going to show a version here and check with you guys. If she is, I will moderate her.<br><br>Her name is Amanda, and her age is undetermined, although she looks like and is a mature adult. She has very short, somewhat spiky hair, that has turned white from stress early on, and dark eyes, and somewhat light skin (light enough to sunburn).<br><br>In the past, Amanda ran afoul of a chaos god somewhere (originally it was Discord) and ended up with a curse: She would not die until the maximum possible age for a human, not age after maturity, and would quickly heal from would-be lethal wounds, and heal somewhat faster than a regular human from regular wounds, although she still feels pain.<br><br>The curse part is that she would get to use that talent often, dying often in hilarious and commonly quite painful ways. A day when she only dies once is considered a really good day. Amanda signed on to the PPC because it was a dangerous job, so she could fill up her dying quota while still doing something useful.<br><br>Her curse has given her a very hard shell, and she is quite crabby and rather anti-social and snarky, although she does have a generous heart hidden in a dark corner somewhere. She&#39;s usually a bit laid-back. Thinks she is immune to insanity, but isn&#39;t really, she just reacts to it in different ways. <br><br>Her major randoms are Harry Potter, Dresden Files, Discworld, Hitchiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, Star Trek, Star Wars, Dwarf Fortress, and Minecraft.<br><br>Her lust object is Ron Weasley, whom she thinks is cute, and when he&#39;s bashed she gets mad, and if the Sue really bashes Ron she can be sure of a painful death.<br><br>Methods of fighting/assassination: Keeps knives on her person, tipped with various poisons. She likes to use large, collateral-damagey methods of assassination, often involving lava. Yes, she gets herself with these too, but that&#39;s what the curse is there for. She&#39;s moderately good at hand-to-hand combat, and fights dirty.<br><br>Doesn&#39;t really care what she wears, as long as it&#39;s practical.<br><br>Belongs to the Department of Floaters.<br><br>So, commentary and advice.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s what Amanda reminds me of, though as far as I know, Jack&#39;s immortality allows him to still age- so he&#39;ll eventually look like a wrinkly little old man (or a giant face).<br><br>Don&#39;t think I&#39;m saying you&#39;re copying his character, because I&#39;m not. That&#39;s just what I&#39;m reminded of.<br><br>The curse could make for some rather hilarious situations (like Amanda getting killed almost immediately on her first mission and her partner freaking out- and then freaking out even more when Amanda starts breathing again)<br><br>How would it affect her, personally? The first few times she died, especially, probably left some pretty big emotional impact on her. How does Amanda react to her deaths now? I&#39;m assuming she&#39;s used to them at this point in her life, but it&#39;s probably still weird to die so often and come back. How long does she take to regenerate? Does it depend on the wounds (like being stabbed would take less time to heal than going ka-splat off a cliff)? Is she ever disoriented when she comes back to life? What happens if she gets vaporized?<br><br>The collateral damage bit I&#39;m not too sure on... What if she burns down Hogwarts castle? What if she blows up the Millenium Falcon or the Enterprise?<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m most definitely not a PG, but I think Amanda could work as an agent. ;)</p>

            <p>Yeah, I only realized the similarities to Jack after I thought her up. Although, Jack arguably has it better; he can theoretically take a vacation without dying horribly several times a day.<br><br>Hilarious situations involving death is pretty much what her curse is used for (other examples might be a Jerk Sue killing her and then freaking out when it doesn&#39;t work).<br><br>Her curse is the reason for half of her personality; she&#39;s crabby and anti-social mostly because of the trauma from it. <br><br>She heals from deadly wounds at the same rate (very quick; she only spends a fews moments dead from both a stab wound and vaporization), but any non-lethal wound (say a broken arm), heals at a rate twice as fast as normal human healing, unless that&#39;s OP. She was probably disoriented the first times, but by now she&#39;s used to it.<br><br>The collateral damage thing is usually either a small-scale thing, or used to kill Sue locations.</p>

            <p>The person I&#39;m thinking of for her partner is a Monk of Rinjswand (the home-brew class I posted about earlier), and is a coward and survivalist (although this doesn&#39;t mean that she foists all the duties of assassination on her partner; she just tends to use a megaphone, record of herself, or a written message to deliver the charges while she shoots Sue from a safe distance) who, due to following the path of Rincewind, is, like him, constantly getting into dangerous situations and then surviving them. Other than that, she&#39;s usually sweet and preppy with a fondness for pink, is very religious, and may whatever supreme being you choose to believe in help you if you blaspheme or take away her pendant with a design of her holy symbol (Rincewind&#39;s wizzard hat) on it. </p>

            <p>The curse sounds sort of like the Japanese variety, where the character gets amazing superpowers, but is still suffers from being, y&#39;know, cursed and all.

            <p>Like Pretzel says, the nature of her immortality will take a bit of tweaking, but other than that, she sounds interesting. Her age--fortyish? fiftyish? makes her somewhat unique among agents, who are mostly young. Playing with somebody who&#39;s had half a lifetime of experiences will add to the story.<br><br>I agree with Pretzel that her immortality and bad luck doesn&#39;t sound like a chaos curse. To me, it sounds more like a wish twisted by a particularly sadistic or incompetent genie--perhaps worded something like, &quot;I wish I could recover quickly from anything but old age.&quot;--a wish for a full lifespan, a relatively sensible one from a sensible person who knows that living forever isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be, but who still wants to live long enough to raise their children, see their grandchildren, and finish what they&#39;re doing before they pass on. Perhaps she had a terminal illness or severe injury that would otherwise have killed her.<br><br>With her being, say, fiftyish, she is old enough to have a grown child. Maybe the child was why she made that wish to begin with--she wanted to live to raise the child, and now that they&#39;re grown flown the nest, she wants something useful to do.<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s just one of many possibilities. Essentially, you want to have her curse/power be an intrinsic part of her character, something that tells the reader more about her rather than a power stuck on for her to use. </p>

            <p>Really, the whole &#39;chaos god&#39; thing was more of a leftover from her MlP FiM beginning, where the only character powerful enough to place such a curse would be Discord.

            <p>I&#39;ve seen the same argument--&quot;immortality is overpowered&quot;--and I never understood why. There are many things that are much more powerful than immortality. It&#39;s certainly not so powerful that you&#39;d have to categorically rule it out.<br><br>A character who doesn&#39;t age would be very lucky in the real world, but in a role-play or in a tabletop game, dying of old age is highly unlikely to ever be a threat to the characters. In a tabletop game, I would give a character this kind of immortality--doesn&#39;t age but can be killed--for free, if the player wanted it. It won&#39;t make the character any stronger and it&#39;s not unfair in any way.<br><br>Being unkillable is a pretty powerful ability. However--it&#39;s not infallible. It doesn&#39;t mean the person can&#39;t be imprisoned, slowed down, drugged, tricked, turned into a frog or a statue, or put into a situation they can&#39;t get out of. They don&#39;t have super strength or speed or intelligence. They&#39;re vulnerable to everything but actual murder, including things that are worse than death. (Drop them into an active volcano, for example...)<br><br>Being able to repeatedly come back from death--once again, a powerful ability, but not out of the question. There have to be rules: Do they resurrect in the same body in the same position? What happens if their body is destroyed at death? Do they leave multiple bodies behind, one for every death, or do they re-create their old one? How long does it take to come back? If the place where they died is incompatible with life (see previous &quot;active volcano&quot; suggestion), do they repeatedly die, or do they just not come back until something makes that location survivable? How long does it take to rebuild their body, and are they vulnerable while that&#39;s happening? A consistent set of rules goes a long way, and offers interesting story possibilities.<br><br>Even at the extremes of immortality, the trait won&#39;t make an automatic Mary Sue. It&#39;s totally possible to create a good character who doesn&#39;t age and can&#39;t be killed. Their storyline would focus on their interactions with others and with the world around them. They can&#39;t lose their lives--but they can lose just about everything else that&#39;s important to them, and they&#39;re not superhuman in any other way. You can still get them into deep trouble that their immortality can&#39;t get them out of.</p>

            <p>I agree on tweaking the exact details of how she came across the power/curse, but it is a rather interesting twist for an agent, and dependent upon how long it takes her to revive, it could be a serious impediment during a mission. I think the possibility of leaving her partner to face something dangerous could make the power seem less powerful. It could always interfere with the mission. I kind of like the genie origin idea, but any of the others could work with the right telling of back-story. I&#39;m kind of fond of the agents who are crabby, but hide a softer interior, too.</p>

            <p>I suppose my first question is this: why such a specific curse? It seems more like something a vengeful sorcerer would put on someone than a chaos god. Usually chaos deities are all about the instant gratification: they want panic and disorder as soon as possible. What would said deity be getting out of such a prolonged curse on someone? Also, depending on what canon you use for a human&#39;s life span, that&#39;s anywhere from around 120 years old (the common max lifespan for a World One human, IIRC, but which is very, <i>very</i> rare). I&#39;m not sure if there are any continua that have long-living humans, but I&#39;m sure someone else knows.<br><br>To me she almost seems like an expy of Jack Harkness thanks to her basic immortality, but with a dash of Highlander Immortals. Actually, that gives me an idea. You could still have a similar character, but get rid of the whole curse thing. The Highlander-style Immortals, for example, can&#39;t die unless their heads are cut off. It&#39;s a firmly established fact within the Highlander universe. You could still have her be immortal and go through wacky hijinks, but without the onus of a time limit or a curse.<br><br>Everything else looks good to me, however, and not OP. Take my advice as you will, but in her current form, she&#39;d definitely need to be nerfed heavily to be acceptable.</p>

            <p>Originally, it was a curse on one of her ancestors, with the curse simply giving a good effect and a bad effect, evening out to having an interesting life. She simply got one of the more obviously supernatural effects.<br><br>And yeah, I was thinking somewhere along the span of 120 years for the curse&#39;s effect, at maximum.<br><br>And believe me, I didn&#39;t have Jack Harkness in mind when I created her.

            <p>Hi everyone. It&#39;s been a while since I was last here, but a very, very &quot;special&quot; set of badfics inspired me to consider returning to the Board and trying my hand at writing PPCs again. (A setting-breaking SI turns Homura into a lovestruck blow-up doll and ruins everyone else&#39;s characterization while never shutting up. Also, the first one-third vampire, one-third human, and one third-dragon OC I&#39;ve seen in the Madoka fandom.) <br><br>I just had two questions. <br>1. How many Madoka PPCings are there? I&#39;ve seen a few on the wiki.<br><br>2. Has anyone named the minis for that fandom? Mini-Anthonies maybe?<br><br>Hello again to anyone who remembers me; it&#39;s good to meet everyone else!</p>

            <p>Oh, and welocme back Ugolino!<br><br>Anyways, the guy who wrote this has a lot of potential as a writer - in fact, the first half of the one I read (the one based on the Rebellion movie) was surprisingly good to the point that I linked it to Desdendelle and Firemagic.<br><br>Then the guy revealed hiself as part dragon ad part vampire (acquired, actually - he was born as a normal human. Still, I&#39;m pretty curous to know how does he know the exact percentages...) and seduced Homura. I was like &quot;no, no, WTF are you doing? You were supposed to fix her not bed her!&quot;<br><br>I left a review, hoping to help him with some constructive criticism, but didn&#39;t receive an answer.</p>

            <p>But then again I had an unfair advantage in that I&#39;d suffered through his earliest fic so I knew what was coming. The out of character isn&#39;t Homulucifer being Homulucifer: it&#39;s what he actually thinks the character sounds like.<br><br></p>

            <p>Not perfect, though - Homura doesn&#39;t want Madoka to reciprocate her love - she just wants her safe.<br><br>And Madoka loving everyone exactly equal is bad too, &#39;cause even our friend-to-all-living-things ex-Goddess doesn&#39;t work that way. I mean, what was the naked space hugs scene all about? Madoka recognizing Homura as a very special, very close friend. You can&#39;t claim that Madoka loves her as much as she loves the perfect stranger at the other side of the world afterwards.<br><br>So basically one of the main conflicts of this story, while an interesting one, actually doesn&#39;t exist in canon and in fact looks like it was just an excuse to break the HomuMado pairing.<br><br>The SI character looked interesting in the beginning, he had his &quot;bad&quot; sides but they were treated as such by the other characters so it was fine. Until Chapter 3 it still was a pleasant read.<br>Then he transformed in his dragon form in chapter 4, and things went downhill from there. In chapter 5 I was like &quot;wtf is happening now I liked the story how it was in the beginning&quot;. In chapter six I was facepalming (in fact, I skipped the sex scene completely because, well, only knowing that it was happening was enough to disgust me).<br><br>I left a still fairly positive review in the hope that it would make the author more likely to take up my offer for concrit - on a technical level his writing looked pretty good to me, it&#39;s such a shame that it is used for this kind of fics.</p>

            <p>Considering the thread subject, I think I&#39;ll have some cake. Many thanks for the welcome and the information!<br><br>I was thinking the same thing; talk about your classic Sue (Stu) tropes. That was the least of this story&#39;s problems though: Homura&#39;s out of character by line three and unrecognizable halfway down the first page. The author&#39;s rather disturbing views, character assassination (quite literally in the case of poor Mami), and tendency to BABBLE about things we&#39;d rather not learn about himself pale in comparison to the sheer creepiness that makes for a story that turned my stomach in a way most Legendary Badfic didn&#39;t.<br><br>Homura and the others rapidly become unrecognizable- and not even character replacements deserve what happens to the cast of this story. The unjustified ancestry is the least of the issues with this one.<br><br>WARNING: NSFW, NSFB, Not Suitable For Anyone Dear God Why Does This Exist:<br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713694/1/Homura-Afterstory"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713694/1/Homura-Afterstory">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713694/1/Homura-Afterstory</a></a><br></p>
