            <p>WARNING: The following post contains vague spoilers for &quot;Fallout: Equestria&quot; and serious spoilers for the <i>Fallout</i> series. Proceed at your own risk.<br><br>It&#39;s been a while since I read the &quot;Fallout: Equestria&quot; series, so I will admit up front that I might be misremembering some aspects of it. However, I&#39;m not writing this post to talk about the minutiae of the story. I want to present why I believe that this story does not execute the crossover concept well. &quot;Fallout: Equestria,&quot; in my view, fails to understand key aspects of both <i>My Little Pony</i> and <i>Fallout</i>. Especially <i>Fallout</i>.<br><br>First off, <i>My Little Pony</i>. I felt that the characterization of the Mane Six (who appear in various flashbacks sparked by stored memories) was exaggerated to fit the concept of a <i>Fallout</i>-colored universe. They felt flat to me; exaggerations of the character&#39;s most notable qualities slathered with a grim paint. The decisions they make in the story don&#39;t gel with what I know about them from the show (and that is taking into account when the story was written in relation to the show&#39;s production).<br><br>The story&#39;s relationship with <i>Fallout</i> is even more tenuous. For all its destruction and horrors and war that never changes, <i>Fallout</i> is at its core a story about hope. We see in that series -- particularly in <i>Fallout 2</i> and <i>Fallout: New Vegas</i> -- a world that may scarred and nasty, but at the same time is mending. People are surviving. Civilization is recovering. In <i>Fallout 3</i>, that&#39;s admittedly a bit harder to see (and I feel like &quot;F:E&quot; takes the most inspiration from that entry). But even there, the audience has hope. In &quot;F:E,&quot; the only real suggestion we get that the world might repair itself comes at the very end. Up until that point, the audience is continuously hammered with the point that almost everything is terrible and almost everypony is suffering.<br><br>Yes, player choice in the video game does mean that you can potentially make things even worse. But consider what we know about the canon of <i>Fallout</i>. We know that the Master&#39;s army from the original game was destroyed. We know that the Enclave&#39;s plan to dose the world with a modified Forced Evolutionary Virus from the second game was stopped. This implies that ultimately the characters from those iterations of the games were forces for good (for the most part). I admit that&#39;s an area up for debate, though.<br><br>There are also other problems with the story that don&#39;t necessarily extend from the canons involved. The characterization of Little Pip, for one. I found her constant angst to become rather grating as time went on, especially considering the amount of praise she receives from others. The pacing of the story is also really rough. You can get away with padding and side-quests in an open-world video game; not so much in a written story.<br><br>It&#39;s not the worst thing I&#39;ve ever read, but neither does it necessarily deserve the praise it has received. There&#39;s just too much wrong with it, in my mind.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>... Does it deserve to be PPC&#39;ed, or whatever the phrase is, then? Because if it has good aspects, but has rather big flaws, that may put it up for grabs, especially if you&#39;re suggesting that Little Pip is a Sue. Right?</p>

            <p>First, I never said that Little Pip was a Sue. I said that she had a questionable characterization. Had I believed she was a Mary Sue, I would have said so.<br><br>Secondly, I would argue that the story is far too long to make an effective mission out of. It&#39;s longer than <i>War and Peace</i>, if the Internet is to be believed.<br><br>Finally, we don&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t, anyway) make missions out of stories because we believe they &quot;deserve&quot; it. It comes down to whether we can think we can make something entertaining out of the original story.</p>

            <p>((Dann here: I&#39;m posting this on behalf of Ekyl because his internet is being silly and insisting that the Board doesn&#39;t exist when he tries to post things.))<br><br>The length&#39;s certainly an issue, but I don&#39;t think it would necessarily preclude a mission. It would definitely make it much, much harder to make an interesting PPC story out of the fic though; I&#39;ve thought about how I would tackle this a few times, and it&#39;d probably have to be towards the end of a story arc spent building up to <em>Fallout: Equestria</em>, maybe even require a collaborative effort to take it down. The question at the end might be if it&#39;s worth the effort, but as tricky as it could be I think if good enough writers put their heads together they could figure out a way to make a good mission/story out of it, hopefully without it taking for ever or the mission itself being ridiculously long! <br><br>The bigger concern is the possibility that sporking F:E would throw the Board into civil war. Last time I said I didn&#39;t like this thing the bronies around here acted like I said I kick puppies for fun.</p>

            <p>I do feel sorry about that whole mess, by the way. Feel free to hate it, I don&#39;t care. People love and hate different things, and to be fair, there are very valid criticisms of the fic. However, I just cannot see how it could possibly be missionable. But that is a can of worms I do not want to open again. So, let us agree to disagree, and know that Marvin and Printowrthy will stand in the way of anybody who tries to kill that fic.</p>

            <p>...but writing up an entire fanfic just for the sake of missioning it seems, I dunno, not so much cheating as more time and effort than it&#39;s worth. Surely there&#39;s plenty of regular badfic without adding to the pile for the sole purpose of writing a mission.

<li>Not that I know. As far as I know, the only time when someone missions something they wrote is when they wrote the badfic before joining the PPC and want it sporked. Otherwise, the closest thing I can think about is what Huinesoron did - he wrote a couple of purposefully bad fics for others to mission as part of his &quot;Ispace Wars&quot; story-line.<br>2. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000">In the grim darkness of the future, there is only war.</a><br>3. Related to what you mentioned above, Cupcakes isn&#39;t grimdark. It&#39;s a darkfic. Grimdark is basically a &#39;verse that everything in is screwed up and hopeless (see WH40K. There&#39;s a reason why the phrase comes from its tagline).<br>4. Generally speaking, both AO3 and the Pit host fics.</li>

            <p>The following review is going to contain my honest opinions. I apologize in advance if I seem to be insulting in places. That is not and has never been my intention.<br><br>As doctorlit mentioned, I don’t understand why Rashida is so unpleasant to her partner. She hits Falchion with insults and sarcasm right out of the gate and it doesn’t really let up. It makes me not really like her as a character. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course, so long as that was your intention.<br><br>Do you really need Rashida to go over almost every bit of basic information with Falchion? Has he not received any training in the three days he’s been in headquarters? Not even a quick spiel from one of the Flowers? I would presume that anyone who joins the PPC at least has some cursory knowledge about what they do. Otherwise, why would they join? Plus, it feels somewhat redundant from a meta-audience standpoint. Most of the people who are going to read your story know about Sues and the PPC.<br><br>I fail to see the point of the recurring bit with Falchion recording the tickling scenes. I’m not sure if it was supposed to be funny, some kind of character building, or something else. Because Rashida is right; he is jeopardizing the Duty by doing that. It almost feels like he’s an addict considering that he runs away to film Neo in a separate room at one point. It’s also questionable in the sense that he is recording people without their knowledge or consent for his own personal use. If your intent was to build up his character, I’d question your methods in that regard.<br><br>There are points where Rashida and Falchion’s dialogue sound pretty much interchangeable. Act 3 page 13, for example, when the two are talking about the Chell/Neo ship. I had to read the section a few times to determine who was saying what.<br><br>Falchion’s revelation occurs far sooner in the fic than I had anticipated. It’s also a bit… anti-climactic. It’s just sort of “and then he remembered” and the story continues on from them. I feel like you could have kept dragging that out. To have the revelation in the first act drags down the pacing of the rest of the story in my view, particularly since he seems to get over it relatively quickly.<br><br>Everything involving Ripper confronting the agents feels very contrived. Anyother agents would have assassinated him the moment he found out about their existence, story be damned. Rashida has several instances where she can and should shoot him in Act 4 when he first shows up (also he pulls a gun out of nowhere in that scene). Plus, considering that his threats have no payoff, what was the point?<br><br>On a more positive note, you do a decent job balancing the agents with actual lines from the fic. It’s a hard mix to get right. There are some areas where it could be better (if the fic-text takes up more than half a page, it’s probably a bit much) but it was never too obtrusive.<br><br>I also liked the agent’s transition into the pseudo-scriptfic style of the story. I feel like it goes on a bit too long, though. And you really didn’t need to bring it back.<br><br>Finally, some specific criticisms:<br>– <i>“No, this is Bad Slash [...] Of course you&#39;re in RC #227! It gives me such joy to think that you honestly got the number wrong.”</i> The structure of this phrase is rather strange, which I would argue is in part due to the sarcasm feeling forced.<br>– <i>“Canonically, Stratogale only appeared in one scene in the film[...]”</i> Why would Rashida need to say this if Falchion is the big <i>Incredibles</i> fan? He should probably be the one saying it.<br>– The transition between Acts 3 and 4 was very jarring. The two were at each others throats and then… everything’s fine. Maybe you haven’t rewritten that part yet.<br>– Why didn’t your agents immediately take the real Violet back to Medical immediately upon finding her? There’s no point to them dragging her around other than to create unnecessary drama.<br>– Your first charge list is a block of text nearly half a page long, making it nearly impossible to read. Your second charge list isn’t much better in terms of its length.<br><br>All in all, I did not enjoy this story. Your characters were unlikeable in my eyes and your actual story dragged on for far too long for what ultimately far too little of a payoff. Starting off with the epic multiparter was perhaps not the best way to introduce readers to Falchion and Rashida.</p>

            <p>I read this mission during a work shift, so this may not be as comprehensive as usual, due to the lag between reading it and writing this.  I just wanted to make some general, overall observations.  (I also obviously couldn&#39;t listen to the music at work, so I won&#39;t comment on that.)<br><br>First, on the relationship between Rashida and Falchion.  I don&#39;t understand why Rashida has so much enmity towards Falchion.  Being upset at him filming the tickling scenes is understandable, and, of course, there was the fight scene in the introductory interlude.  However, in this mission, Rashida keeps saying that Falchion is incompetent and arrogant, and as a reader, I don&#39;t understand why.  As far as I can tell, Rashida hasn&#39;t seen any evidence of Falchion being incompetent: their fight was close, as they both had red health bars in the final turn.  He also displays functioning knowledge of the crossover&#39;s main canons.  Sure, there are some things he&#39;s unfamiliar with, but all in all, he&#39;s doing pretty well for a recent recruit on his first mission, especially in light of what he discovers later.<br><br>I have an even harder time understanding Rashida&#39;s claims of arrogance on Falchion&#39;s part.  The audience gets a paragraph of narration from Falchion&#39;s perspective during the battle, but Rashida isn&#39;t privy to that; from her point of view, Falchion is acting just like a regular, wild Skarmory (putting aside the question of just how self-aware Pokйmon are, since that varies by title).  I also don&#39;t see much pride in this mission; Falchion is acting pretty green, both questioning his partner about unfamiliar things as well as testing what behaviors she&#39;s comfortable with him performing in her presence.  Some changes need to be made on one side or the other: either add some instances of Falchion behaving in ways that justify Rashida&#39;s complaints, or change her dislike to something more concrete that we-the-audience can see in the text.<br><br>I like both agent&#39;s frequent usage of phrases from their homeworlds in their speech and thought.  It makes them feel more like denizens of those places, rather than being a sphinx and a metal bird who just talk like Earth humans.  I don&#39;t know ancient Egyptian mythology well enough to understand all of the references Rashida makes, but it still leaves the impression of her culture on her character, and also gives further evidence of her role as a deity&#39;s champion.  Falchion&#39;s usage of Pokйmon descriptors is quite amusing and creative, too.  (Although &quot;right off the Zubat&quot; doesn&#39;t quite work for me, since that phrase is referring to a baseball bat.)<br><br>I also think the mission has some excellent pacing.  Despite the jumble of canons present, with each one, you give the reader a chance to absorb it and see it&#39;s effect on what was already happening.  It made it very easy to follow.  The way you divided the mission into acts helps this as well, as it gives mental stop-points for me to digest it in chunks.  Considering how long you&#39;ve indicated the original fic was, (I&#39;m guessing) you&#39;re doing a good job of trimming the parts presented in the mission down to just the bare bones needed to show the plot and demonstrate how bad it is.  I am looking forward to seeing the remainder of the mission, and the massive disentangling on the horizon.</p>

            <p>I apologize for the SUPER LATE response, with the usual excuse of research. I&#39;ll try to address any issues brought up as quickly as I can, as I need to sleep.<br><br>Falchion&#39;s current agent bio doesn&#39;t label him as being arrogant or incompetent by any means, but what it DOES state is that he lacks initiative, especially when it comes to what&#39;s important. He&#39;s also the kind of person to make snide comments rather than apologize for minor slip-ups (<i>&quot;Oh, I’m *so* sorry, *Rose*,&quot; he snapped back. &quot;I just can’t help but record these kinds of scenes!&quot;</i>), though he knows to back off when he&#39;s REALLY screwed up. I might have edited the writing such that Rashida doesn&#39;t accuse him of arrogance so much as getting distracted too much. I&#39;ll probably look through the text again to see if this is really the case, and edit her dialogue to make this more apparent if need be.<br><br>As for eatpraylove&#39;s response, which I replied to by sending her the current draft for further fixing up earlier, I think the problem was that I wanted this mission DONE so that I could move on to sporking other fics (I have a lot of story ideas for my agents in my head that I want to put on paper, after all). Ironically, this is one of the very problems that led to the badfic itself turning out as it did, along with my desire to shoehorn certain ideas into the writing in spite of others&#39; opinions. I&#39;m happy to know that I&#39;ve cleared up the length issue, and I&#39;m willing to let my beta-readers take care of the rest of the material I&#39;ve finished up for this mission as well (though I&#39;m still waiting on feedback for the post-mission, which hasn&#39;t been beta-read AT ALL just yet).<br><br>And this, folks, is why I enjoy constructive criticism! :D</p>

            <p>(Disclaimer: The following comment is because I want to help you improve your mission, not because I&#39;m a demanding or mean beta reader. Please reply with that in mind.)<br><br>It&#39;s great that you reformatted and shortened it, but you appear to have ignored several of the wording changes I/Storme Hawk/Desdendelle/whoever put in while this was under construction. There are a few stray &quot;we&quot;&#39;s in the third person sections, for example, and the narration still has <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Ing_Disease">Ing Disease.</a> And what are you doing posting a mission before it&#39;s done anyway?<br><br>I&#39;ll have to ask you to open Mission 1.1 and 1.2 for comments/suggestions...again.

            <p>So... I haven&#39;t been here in a while... stupid quadruple projects.  And Warframe.  And many other thi-  ooh shiny!  In any case, I&#39;d like to know a list of peoples personal goodfic.  Stuff you like, from any fandom, any AU or weird quirk the author introduced, any continuation.  Just stuff you consider to be a goodfic.  I&#39;ll start.  <br><br>    First off, Shinj and Warhammer 40k, by Charles Bhepin.  This &#39;fic is also known as Shout Outs: The Fanfic.  Great crossover of NGE and WH40k, with Shinji being a genius with the AT Field, Rei getting a freaking Hellbore, and Asuka pulling off a Giga Drill Breaker.  Mana Kirishima, from Girlfriend of Steel makes an appearance to command the Trident Land Dreadnought, which is just as awesome as the 40k dreadnought, only nobody needs to be crippled.  Many, many other awesome things are introduced, but I&#39;ll stop rambling.  <br><br><br>Next is Yet Again, With a Little Extra Help, a Naruto &#39;fic by Third Fang.  Fair warning, there is timetravel and godlike beings, but it&#39;s actually justified.  The author also self inserts... as a semi-sentient scythe with an insatiable thirst for blood.  Danzo betrays Konoha, Akatsuki extracts the Kyuubi, and Naruto is in a coma during the procedure, at least until an unfamiliar figure rips into his mindscape, drunk, a little bit high, and screaming.  He promptly empties his stomach.  With a mix of humor and awesome fights, this &#39;fic is easily in my top 5.<br><br><br>The last two &#39;fics are In Flight and Hill of Swords, both by the same author whose name escapes me.  IF is a Fate/stay night and Sekirei crossover, whereas the second is a Familiar of Zero and Fate/stay night crossover.  Both are love &#39;em or hate &#39;em fics, especially with HoS, because of a Shirou that is a mixture of the Fate route Shirou and the Unlimited Blade Works Shirou.  Both make into my top 5.<br><br>That&#39;s it for me.  I can&#39;t think, so tired.  Anyway, go wild.  I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all like to share some of the jewels we&#39;ve found recently.</p>

            <p>...for people to respond.  I&#39;m in need of things to read as well.  Advice I&#39;d give (Haven&#39;t done my own missions yet, and I haven&#39;t read many, but, why not.) is start off from the the middle of the mission, where things are just starting to go awry, and then jump to the beginning.  This might help hook people in and give you the in-your-face factor you want.  Just a n00b&#39;s two cents.</p>

            <p>. . .the deal now is an experiment in a new sort of Permission-granting, I think? The type where the applicant writes an example mission and whether or not permission should be granted is based on that. I&#39;m like, 99% sure that&#39;s where it left off with Darkbrother16, but I&#39;m not totally sure.</p>

            <p>We can spork this author&#39;s fics, Huinesoron never said anything against that.

            <p>THE SINGULAR MEMBERS/CREATURES ARE CALLED SILENTS.<br><br>I can&#39;t even. I really can&#39;t. I&#39;m also about to check out the SPN/Torchwood crossover...here&#39;s hoping I make it out with my sanity.<br><br>Comments regarding &quot;Three&#39;s a Crowd&quot;:<br><br>-Kindly explain to me why Ianto is chasing a demon.<br>-Kindly further explain to me why the demon is running from Ianto and not doing <i>anything at all</i> to deter him despite Ianto&#39;s chasing and shooting the demon three times. You&#39;d think he&#39;d have at least thrown Ianto into a wall by now.<br>-...Ianto, I&#39;m going to make allowance for your loose-lippedness about Torchwood because hey, you&#39;re obviously off-balance due to sudden angel appearance.<br>-...Author, I don&#39;t think every single person who meets Cas needs to reiterate Dean&#39;s comment about him looking like a holy tax accountant.<br>-IANTO, YOU DON&#39;T JUST TAKE AN ANGEL OUT FOR DRINKS WITHOUT EVEN CHECKING IN WITH JACK AND, I DON&#39;T KNOW, MAYBE LETTING HIM KNOW THAT YOU&#39;RE ALIVE, THE CREATURE YOU WERE CHASING IS TAKEN CARE OF, AND OH, HEY, THERE&#39;S A GUY HERE CLAIMING TO BE AN ANGEL. GOOD GRIEF.<br>-For that matter, Jack, shouldn&#39;t you be trying to contact Ianto? You haven&#39;t heard from him in a bit, and Tosh is bound to have noticed that he&#39;s no longer running anywhere but is instead heading to a bar. With company. If Torchwood doesn&#39;t show up within the next few paragraphs...<br>-...booming voice. Dean Winchester. <i>Booming voice</i>.<br>...I don&#39;t know, but...I tend to associate &#39;booming voice&#39; more with Thor. Not really Dean. But. I suppose I can let that one slide, Dean can get pretty loud...<br>-CAS IS GRINNING. AND HE WAS LAUGHING BEFORE. AND THERE&#39;S NO WAY HE CAN BE DRUNK, THAT TAKES A LIQUOR STORE.<br>...Okay, Cas is OOC.<br>-THEY&#39;RE NOT EITHER HUNTERS, THEY&#39;RE TORCHWOOD. IT&#39;S NOT THE SAME THING. FOR ONE THING, THEY TAKE DOWN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CREATURES, AND FOR ANOTHER, THAT&#39;S NOT THE ONLY THING THEY DO.<br>-...you and Cas, huh, Dean? How about Sam? When is this set? Is he with you? <i>When is this set</i>?<br><br>So yeah, this doesn&#39;t seem to be finished. From this...that may be a good thing. Read at your own risk--specifically, if you think that Cas and Ianto <i>flirting blatantly</i> isn&#39;t something you can handle (I&#39;m not sure how well I&#39;m handling it), give it a miss. Or prepare to cringe.<br><br>...prepare to cringe either way.<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: ...hold on...one more question:<br><br>/ahem/ WHY ARE CASTIEL AND DEAN IN CARDIFF.<br>HOW DID THEY GET THERE<br>WHY DID THEY GO THERE<br>WHY WOULD YOU BRING DEAN WINCHESTER THERE<br>IF YOU GOT THERE ON A PLANE, DEAN WOULDN&#39;T BE HAPPY<br>IF YOU&#39;RE ONLY THERE FOR THE ONE DEMON...THAT HAD BETTER BE ONE NASTY DEMON, WHICH IT ISN&#39;T, BECAUSE CAS TOOK IT OUT WITH ALMOST NO EFFORT, SO WHY BRING DEAN IN THE FIRST PLACE? AND FURTHERMORE, WHY EVEN CHASE IT TO BEGIN WITH?<br><br>/heavy breathing/ Okay, I&#39;m done. Anyone who wants to do something with this, go with my blessing and support.<br><br>~DF<br><br>PPS: (All ranting aside, I&#39;m not entirely sure it&#39;s mission-worthy...but you never know.

            <p>Aside from the obvious My Immortal and 30Hs, I think it would have to be The adventures of Dark Yagami. Horrifically OOC Light and Ryuk, ridiculous logic leaps, and a blatant Gary Sue OC named (unsurprisingly) Dark Yagami, who is supposed to be Light&#39;s long lost twin brother with his own death note and shinigami partner named bluud.</p>

The situation and characters are twisted out of all logic in order to force &quot;drama.&quot; I hate this thing more than Agony in Pink, because at least that fic was honest about what it was going for.

            <p>There was one Pokйmon badfic I found that was pretty bad. Spelling and grammar that rivaled My Immortal, a blatant Mary Sue named Ruby, reality that remained inconsistent (her love interest died no less than four times), and crossovers with Titanic, Avatar the Last Airbender, Twilight, and even reality. The author would write amusing death threats to various people who wrote bad reviews, and would devote entire chapters to killing them off. Too bad it was a Trollfic. I had so much fun with it that I made it into the (planned) first episode of my own series, Imaginations Collide, if anyone remembers me mentioning it.<br><br>Other than that, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a toss up between The Girl Who Lived Septology and a Walking Dead badfic I found called The Walking Dead Reprisal.<br><br>The Girl Who Lived doesn&#39;t have that many spelling mistakes compared to other badfics I have read, but the so called logic of the series is painfully bad. There is one point where the main character teleports to deliver a letter from somewhere where she is trapped, and then goes back to where she is trapped! It would have made much more sense to just teleport out and stay there, right? And then there is the horrendous pro-nature, pro-nudist and arguably pro-gay themes in there. Not that I have a problem with any of those things. I mean, I personally don&#39;t conform to those viewpoints. But I&#39;m open-minded enough to tolerate them, as long as they are not forced down my throat, like this set of &quot;stories&quot; does. Of course, the main character is a Mary Sue, and the main characters are put out of character. <br><br>But as a side note, this series had so much potential, even though it is a rip off of the Harry Potter series. For example, two of the main characters, Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom, are taken out of character, sure. But Neville is given a more interesting backstory, and Ron has replaced Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets as the vessel of the diary. These things could easily have worked, and that&#39;s what is frustrating! Neville is given a more interesting backstory, but his personality is very much like Ron at that point, and they are used interchangeably, when that should never happen! Ron being the victim of the Chamber of Secrets could have been really good, if he was kept in character and wasn&#39;t reduced to a weak and helpless ***wipe. <br><br>And to top that off, there were several new aspects of this story that I was looking forward to. The Druids were just begging to be more fully explored! And if they were going to be used, then- The story mentions Necromancers! That would have been awesome! <br><br>The reason I hated this series so much is that it had so much potential. I genuinely wanted it to turn out to be something more than it is. Unfortunately, the author just took on something too ambitious for them to handle.<br><br>The second pick I have is The Walking Dead Reprisal. This Mary Sue has a Katana and two pet wolves. Yes, a pair of pet wolves that she had met on her travels and tamed to follow her and attack on command! The sword is pushing it, but I would have let it slide. The wolves, on the other hand... Why?! Why a pair of wolves and not something more realistic, like a pair of regular dogs? They&#39;re still cute, they could still help her out, but they provide the extra challenge to protect because they were, I don&#39;t know, domestic at one point or something and not really used to fighting for their lives! But I&#39;m going off topic, here. There is something set up at the beginning that I&#39;m probably making more out of it than it really is, but it seems that there is some secretive shadow government watching Mary Sue in this story. And guess who Mary Sue falls in love with. DARYL, of course. And she meets him and his group when they are searching for that little girl. She follows them to Hershel&#39;s farm and tries to steal from them, but gets caught. I think it was Shane and Andrea who were the ones who were out of character and wanted to get rid of her. Shane probably would have done that in the TV series, but not for the reasons that were given. The series goes on and last I read, the crew was in the prison. I do not like this one because the Mary Sue is a classic case of when a main character, in this case, Daryl, falls in love with the Mary Sue for no real reason and with little to no time at all, when in fact, it&#39;s not in his character to do so.<br><br>So those are my Dishonorable Mentions. I hope you enjoyed them, they were The Gratest Pokйmon Master (yes, that is how it&#39;s spelled), The Girl Who Lived Septology, and The Walking Dead Reprisal. And when I say &quot;enjoy&quot;, I really mean &quot;develop a brain tumor from pure frustration and vomit out your last meal from disgust&quot;.

            <p>Hello again, everyone!

Quite literally, because we moved back into a house we rented, and the renters were slobs. <br><br>And then after that, I was accepted into College! That&#39;s right, I&#39;m currently in College. My hard work in my academic life has paid off.<br><br>So, soon, I will be able to get started with PPC stuff again some time soon. Obviously, I have assignments for College, and every now and then, I&#39;ll be able to devote some time to planning my next several missions.<br><br>If I need to submit my agents again for approval, please say so, so that I can get that out of the way when possible.<br><br>It&#39;s good to be back. :)</p>

            <p>Remember me? :3 <br><br>Not gonna lie, I was wondering what had happened to you. Glad to hear you&#39;re doing okay- doing great, by the sound of it. College? Yikes!

            <p>Yeah, I remember you. :)<br><br>Yep. College. It&#39;s been great so far, though. I&#39;m doing pretty well.<br><br>Well, I don’t know really if I got permission or not. I was trying to get the bios ready and up to par, and I forget who it was, but the PG told me to try and write a first mission to see if I could do it without diverting into a larger story, like I plan to, eventually, do. It&#39;ll be something kind of small scale, though, so I doubt the entire community will need to get involved, unless they want to. Still working out how to do this, but for now, I&#39;m just going to do the missions.</p>

            <p>You were spending all your time writing bios and short stories that told us absolutely nothing about how you would actually write. I made the decision that you would be better off trying to write an actual mission - the thing you&#39;re trying to get Permission so you can keep doing - and showing me that, to demonstrate how you&#39;d actually write. That mission, all by itself, will constitute a Permission Request.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>From what I remember, you were denied permission but an alternate route- writing a mission as your permission application instead of bios and whatnot- was provided. <br>I&#39;m pretty sure you were just given a different option for applying for permission, not permission itself.</p>

            <p>A mission is a type of sporking, but not all sporkings are missions. Considering The Girl Who Lived&#39;s length, I&#39;m pretty confident it was not missioned.<br>In fact, I doubt it is a fitting fic for a mission because of its sheer length - a mission that will no doubt be longer than a book will be both problematic and time-consuming to write and (at least in my opinion) very annoying to read.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got some notes up for the Mini Adoption Center.

Feedback on Henton and Rhonda would also be appreciated; the Center staff will be free-to-use as soon as I get them finalized, we might as well make sure the community is happy with them.</p>

            <p>Getting this center fleshed out will be useful, to reduce the number of &quot;portal to an off-screen OFU that we don&#39;t know really exists&quot; scene that so many missions feature.<br><br>I like the set of characters you&#39;ve developed here.  They each have a reasonable reason for wanting to work with minis, but it&#39;s a variety of reasons across the board, which gives each staff member the opportunity to have their own personality rather than be interchangeable, generic staff.  I especially like that you&#39;ve involved World One and New Caledonia in Rhonda&#39;s backstory, especially since it&#39;s in a way that continues to affect her.  It will be good to see New Cal get a bit of screen time now and then.  (And good research job, giving Dr. Beaufils a French name.)<br><br>Also, we do have one existing character already shown to work in the MAC: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Omri_Stone">Omri Stone</a>.  I&#39;m not surprised you didn&#39;t know about him, because even though I knew he existed, I couldn&#39;t remember his name, and it took me about five straight minutes of searching around the wiki to get to his page.<br><br>Anyway, neither of his appearances cast him as being in charge of the operation, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any harm to keep your co-administrators co-administrators, and let Omri be regular staff.  (We can certainly ask Miah, Omri&#39;s creator and only writer to-date, just in case.  We&#39;ll have to catch her in the chat sometime.)  (And look!  That first link on Omri&#39;s page mentions other agents working in the background.  Your new characters already have appearances!  WOOOO!)<br><br>A few very minor nitpicks in the text itself.  Sacor&#39;s section refers to this as creation of a new department, but it should just be a division of the Department of Operations.<br><br>Also, more of a subjective thing, but we know where all your characters come from, except for Janelle.  I know she last saw her original canon as a five-year-old, so it probably wouldn&#39;t affect her character very much, but it would still be nice to know which corner of the multiverse she&#39;s from.<br><br>So all-in-all, good, practical world-building, with some excellent character design to boot.  Good show!<br><br>(Now someone with Microsoft Publisher skills and free time, make a couple of those pamphlets mentioned in Sacor&#39;s section!)</p>

            <p>Thank you, Doc. Honestly, it has been so long that I couldn&#39;t remember his name, either and hadn&#39;t worked up to finding it yet. <br><br>I had in mind that he was a full-time worker, but not definitely not in charge, so he fits in well as a background character to the ones that you&#39;ve got so far. I think he&#39;s sort of a &#39;little big man&#39; if that makes sense? I&#39;m sure there is a much better term for that. Basically someone who has very little actual power or prestige, but tries to throw around what he does have over the people he can. It kind of makes him a good target for people like Agent Miah who have just a bit of a vindictive streak in their humor.<br><br>He&#39;s human or at least near human in appearance, but beyond that I know nothing about him, and I am unlikely to ever do anything else with him, so have at it.</p>

            <p>In my headcanon, I figure the real Hogwarts does have lessons on the more mundane topics, but Rowling didn&#39;t mention them in the books because they weren&#39;t interesting.  (Who wants to open a fantasy novel about magic and read about calculus exams?)<br><br>Basic math is probably covered during arithmancy.  English probably had an unmentioned class of its own, although it&#39;s questionable whether they read any Muggle literature, or only books published in the Wizarding World.  Perhaps Muggle lit is covered in Muggle Studies?  It&#39;s just hard to swallow the idea that British children wouldn&#39;t be raised on Shakespeare, even children who can fly and shoot fire.</p>

            <p>And after they gained a huge following, the Ministry(?) at the time decided it was easier to just pass Shakespeare off as a Muggle fantasy writer than to try memory-charming nearly everyone in England.<br><br>Also, while I don&#39;t subscribe to the theory that Shakespeare was a front for another playwright, perhaps it&#39;s true in the Potterverse: maybe the Wizarding World needed to set up someone with a known Muggle history as the face of the plays, since the actual wizard author wouldn&#39;t have any birthplace where people could attest to his growing up there.  Shakespeare was likely a squib, or perhaps related by marriage to a wizard or witch.<br><br>(An aside: I&#39;m surprised and disappointed that I never see the theory that that the &quot;real&quot; author of Shakespeare&#39;s plays could have been a woman.

            <p>Considering he had a tie and everything... How was it allowing his chest hair to show? Was he wearing the suit jacket but no shirt? Or was his hair so thick it was popping through the buttons? And in that case, how could it be called &#39;well-groomed&#39;?</p>

            <p><i>On the porch was standing a huge, muscular man with a big, manly beard; and he was dressed in a plaid, red shirt, blue jeans, and sturdy, leather boots. His chest was covered in a thick, unruly carpet of coarse, brown hair.</i> - Hagrid, in CHapter 1.<br><br>In fact, hair - chest, facial, or otherwise - seems to be the first and often only description these people get. I wonder what&#39;s up with that.<br><br>Also: new chapter! Apparently, the Dark Forces of the world do not like Christians - &quot;And when I say Christians; I mean Gryffindor Hats.&quot; They like Hufflewashies because they &#39;believe everything these people say and slap the label &quot;Christian&quot; onto that philosophy&#39;, and they like Ravenmeans because &#39;hey pretend that the Ravenclaw Hats&#39; extremism applies to all Christians&#39;. So, er... the Dark Forces are simultaneously rejoicing in Christians apparently believing anything, and in Christians being extremist haters? Man, the Dark Forces need to get their act together. They should open a Hogwarts School of Wickedness and Debauchery.<br><br>Oh, and Slytholic is working for Voldemort (who&#39;s trying to get Congress to ban freedom of religion, remember). Quite why they&#39;re doing this when they&#39;re even more religious than Gryffinbest - having statues and a whole extra book of commandments on hand - is not made clear.<br><br>Calling it now - Voldemort has a tragic backstory to explain why he hates Christians, is possibly possessed by the devil (depending on whether such a thing is possible in this verse), and he ends the story being saved. Also: it only lasts one story.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I’m so, so sorry to inflict like this upon you guys, but I don’t think I can bear the weight of something this Bad alone anymore <br><br>These are the worst pieces of Badfic to come out of the Brony fandom. no, that’s not enough to describe them. These are the worst thing in the history of written fiction. <br><br>These are worse than even Cupcakes, Rainbow Factory, Pattycakes, Cherilee’s Garden, Sweetapple Massacre and Pages of Harmony combined. <br><br>So without further ado, let the truly brave amongst us dive into the lowest circle of Badfic Tartarus. <br><br>(Disclaimer: A good portion of the writing in this rant is taken from the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/TheConversionBureau">Tv Tropes The  Conversion Bureau YMMV page </a> and I give the wonderful tropers who wrote and edited it express credit. They can better articulate what I currently can’t in my own seething hatred for these atrocious abominations)  <br><br><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Chatoyance">Chatoyance&#39;s work</a> in the <a href="http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/03/story-conversion-bureau.html">Conversion Bureau-verse</a> - NSFB<br><br>The original work The Conversion Bureau is already Badfic enough on its own, being absolutely misanthrofic, depicting humans as irredeemably flawed and show ponification making humans into categorically better beings with kinder, less violent minds.  <br><br>In both the original fic and Chayotance&#39;s work, Celestia is replaced by a misanthrophic tyrant commonly known in the rest of the Brony Fandom as Xenolestia. <br><br>Chayotance however, further adds brimstone to the hellfire by bashing religion, furthering the horrifying brainwashing aspects of ponyfication and the fact that Equestrian ponyfication barrier wipes away anything that was created by humans in a way that leaves no evidence of their prior existence; which includes the arts, sciences, physical memories, buildings, and human advancements; in other words, the last step of the <a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/8stagesofgenocide.html">perfect genocide</a><br><br>The most atrocious example are probably <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/27678/ten-minutes-aftermath">Ten minutes:aftermath</a>  which inferred to be a direct insult to author of a Conversion Bureau fixfic, <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/27938/the-reasonably-adamant-down-with-celestia-newfoal-society"> The reasonably adamantly down with Celestia Newfoal Society</a>  which is yet another caustic insult towards critics of her work and<br>critics of the TCB-verse in general, and well... I will need a whole section to cover the absolutely worst one.<br><br><a href="http://jenniverse.com/stories/The-Conversion-Bureau_-Brand-New-Universe/3.html">Universe Three: The Friendship Virus</a> . Fans of show are repelled because it has nothing to do with ponies. Conversion Bureau fans are turned off because it is a Conversion Bureau story in name only. Males would be repulsed at the incredibly misandric subject matter and the idea of forcibly feminizing men via bioterrorism. Feminists might be repelled because of how Chatoyance portrays all women as flawlessly angelic Purity Sues. So who or what is this story supposed to appeal to exactly?<br><br>Furthermore, it has been blasted for its incredibly sexist portrayal of men as Always Chaotic Evil barbarians who are responsible for 98% of the world&#39;s violence and women as one dimensional angelic Purity Sues who are all nurturing and kind. The eponymous DNA altering virus makes men become like women in every way except for their physical sexual characteristics (and even then those things are altered somewhat), while the women who were exposed to the virus are just made to become even more nurturing and gentle.<br><br>Furthering the issue, Chayotance rejects any Canon that does not befit her vision or that she dislikes and makes open statements that are interpreted as her knowing the show better than even Faust herself. yeah!<br></p>

            <p>The National Department of Redundant Redundancy Department of Redundancy of Our Great Nation, in conjunction with the Nonsense League and the Association for the Stupidification of All Things presents:<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8279745/1/Phoenix-White-Justifications-of-Justice">Pheonix White: Justifications of Justice!</a><br><br>To be honest, this made me laugh really hard, simply because it&#39;s so incredibly absurd. It&#39;s kind of like <i>Thirty Hs</i>, in that it makes about as much sense. I especially appreciate how the author goes out of his or her way to note that impossible things are happening, whereas usually impossible things happen in a badfic because the author forgot something or just doesn&#39;t know something. It manages to be both a great deal less disturbing and more redundant than Thirty Hs.<br><br>In fact, it&#39;s so redundant that I think this may actually be a job for the Department of Redundancy Department...<br><br>All that being said, I <i>think</i> it&#39;s a troll. While the <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3463320/CloudMistDragon555">author&#39;s profile</a> and other stories are nearly as confusing as <i>Justifications</i>, I can&#39;t help but notice that he or she took the space and effort to link to no fewer than two sporkings of <i>Justifications</i>, as well as compliment and thank the sporkers. So either it&#39;s a troll, or the person just has a supermassive sense of humor.<br><br>Either way, this story made me laugh and go &quot;What the -&quot; and was all around amusing. I&#39;d recommend giving it a read &quot;for the lulz.&quot; 😄</p>

            <p>Well. I decided to crawl back here and check up on you people out of boredom.

Did something happen during my absence?<br><br>If you don&#39;t remember me, all the better. I&#39;ve mostly forgiven all of you for what you did. Mostly.

            <p>(No, not really.

            <p>I have found a new sue, specifically, a SotINF sue. Anyone who&#39;s familiar with the canon who can do a mission on it? The link is <br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10084888/1/Jazmine-and-Cinnamon"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10084888/1/Jazmine-and-Cinnamon">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10084888/1/Jazmine-and-Cinnamon</a></a><br>and the summary is: <br>Jazmine Dare is anything but ordinary. As a master of Fire and Air Magic, the only humani to have a black aura and one of the top assassins in the world under 20, she&#39;s considered the most extraordinary girl in the Earth Shadowrealm.But there&#39;s more than meets the eye with this girl. Warning-lots of OCs, don&#39;t like, don&#39;t read. Part of the Stars series.</p>

            <p>Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls, and starfish, we here at <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/">fanficWorld</a> have an <b>important announcement</b> to make: after twelve months of anguish, of pain and suffering, of sweat, tears, and other bodily fluids, we are <i>finally</i> ready to roll out the new version of our <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/PPCIndex.htm">Protectors of the Plot Continuum category!</a><br><br>Now, you may say, &#39;What&#39;s the difference?&#39;, and I&#39;m very glad you asked me that. So glad, in fact, that I will take this opportunity to make you a promise: <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/">fanficWorld</a> pledges to each and every one of you that our site will remain <b>ad-free</b>! That&#39;s not an offer you&#39;ll get every day (or even every year!).<br><br>So go forth, faithful followers! Write whatever comes to mind, and bring it along to fanficWorld - for the fanfics you can&#39;t find anywhere else!<br><br>~ffW Admin, 22/09/2014<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Or, in other words... welcome to the PPC Badfic Game 2014.<br><br><b>What is this?</b> This is the thread where we let our inner badfic writers have free rein. All PPC stories are technically fanfics of the Original Series - but they&#39;re all <i>good</i>fics. That&#39;s clearly unreasonable - most fanfic of <i>anything</i> is terrible. So this is your chance to write the baddest of the badfics. Go nuts!<br><br><b>Who can I write about?</b> Any agents in the PPC are open for you to mutilate. There&#39;s a Creativity Shield around ffW, so everything here is emphatically uncanon. The only exception is that, if someone asks in this thread that their agents not be used, please honour that. I can&#39;t imagine why you <i>would</i>, but the offer&#39;s there.<br><br><b>Where do I post?</b> In this thread, please. fanficWorld is an archive, not a functional website. I&#39;ll be putting all your stories up on there after the fact. To aid in that, please please <i>please</i> provide your stories with:<br>-A title (and chapter titles if you like).<br>-A summary.<br>-A rating (eg, PG-13).<br>-A genre or pair of genres.<br><br>In addition, you should choose <i>yourself</i> a badfic author name - <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/PPCIndex.htm">take a look at our previous examples</a> - and provide an author bio. It can be as hilarious as you like. (Previous profile holders - yes, you can update them.)<br><br><b>What sort of story should I write?</b> A bad one! Obviously. But also one that&#39;s fun to read. Illegible ultra-typo stories are a bit boring after the first one, y&#39;know?<br><br><b>Can I leave reviews?</b> Emphatically yes - that&#39;s half the fun of the game! But do remember to leave them in character - and equally, remember that the flames you receive are <i>not</i> real flames. They&#39;re a game. Don&#39;t get upset.<br><br><b>Do I need a beta?</b> Hahahahahahahaha. Don&#39;t be ridiculous. <sup>-^</sup> What sort of badfic writer has a beta?<br><br><b>Do I need Permission?</b> Again, what sort of badfic writer asks permission? (No. No you don&#39;t)<br><br><b>Why are we doing this?</b> Because it&#39;s fun!<br><br>hS</p>

Tehre are ppl reading tihs who DON KNW WHO JAYCACIA ISS!!! Tahts UNBELIEABLE!!!! ~(Izimax&amp;- you NEAD to read teh othr sotries on my bio like RITE NOU. Tehyr really goo.<br><br>kk so tihs next bit wuld hav been reely intresting but hottestly I cant&#39; be bothed to write it so iLL sunnerise:<br><br>So Aurora tells Jaycacia that she&#39;s her biggest fan and then Illian says that no he is and then they fight a little until Jaycacia tells them that they can both be her biggest fan and then they kiss (eech othr not Jaycacia LOL). Then Supernumberary asks how Jaycacia is still alive because she went to the beginning of the universe and she says that the power of the Starflower kept her alive but it also kept the evil Spies alive so she had to fight them for thousands and hundreds of years until they were just bones and dry leaves (teh ones she was wapped in!!1) and they died and she was all alone. But then Illian cast his spell and called her back (yey!). And then Al&#39;s Waiter asks why she isn&#39;t a Flower any more (b/c he was sneakretly there when she truned into teh Starfowler!) and she says that the power of the Starflower came from the beginning of time and once it went back there it could never leave, but she could separate herself from it and so she did.<br><br>kk so tahts wehre we ar. soz abut not writin taht bit but righting is HARD.<br><br>Suddenly Jaycacia looked mournful. &quot;The battle was hard and long,&quot; she said sadly, &quot;and it has wounded me in more ways than you know. I have news - news I must share with my husband and my mother.&quot; She looked around, despair evident in her face. &quot;But they are not here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll go and get them!&quot; Aurora exclaimed, and ran off into HQ. The agents waited until she came back with the SO and Jay.<br><br>&quot;Oh my lovely daughter!&quot; blubbered Jay, &quot;I never thought I&#39;d see you again!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nor did I, mother,&quot; said Jaycacia, hugging her tight and kissing her all over. &quot;And you, my husband...&quot;<br><br><i>I have missed you,</i> said the SO, embracing her, <i>so very much.</i><br><br>&quot;I need to tell you something,&quot; Jaycacia said seriously. &quot;Husband mine... the battle with the Sub Rosa and her minions scorched me inside and out. My flesh has healed, but my inner places... my womb...&quot; She blinked back the tears. &quot;Husband - I can no longer have children.&quot;<br><br><i>Oh, my beloved,</i> said the SO, holding her closer as the agents gasped in dismay. <i>I knew from your face that something was wrong.</i> He paused a moment, then said, <i>... but you can still have sex, right?</i><br><br>&quot;Absolutely.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;Do you think she&#39;s trying for foreshadowing?&quot;<br><br>Acacia leant back, sinking into Jay&#39;s sofa. &quot;You know what I&#39;ve missed?&quot; she mused aloud. &quot;Soft furnishings. Reeds just aren&#39;t the same.&quot; She glanced over at her friend. &quot;Sorry, what?&quot;<br><br>Jay waved the sheet of paper at her. &quot;The pregnancy thing. Do you think it&#39;s supposed to be foreshadowing?&quot;<br><br>Acacia frowned at the page. &quot;Hard to say. Because on the one hand, I&#39;m really not sure she&#39;s bright enough to foreshadow-&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, you don&#39;t have a high opinion of the intelligence of someone who writes a summary of half their chapter?&quot; Jay blinked. &quot;I think that sentence got away from me a bit.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re doing fine,&quot; Acacia assured her. &quot;And no. But on the other hand... if she </i>did<i> try to foreshadow... that&#39;s exactly how unsubtle she&#39;d be.&quot;</i></p>

I followed the horse footprints back to HQ; that&#39;s how I knew where you were.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I left you to protect you,&quot; Illian said bravely. Constance just laughed.<br><br>&quot;You left me so you could sleep around!&quot; she explained. &quot;Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve been up to. For instance, most recently you have been kissing... her!&quot; She pointed at Aurora.<br><br>&quot;Constance... rwl paware pev!&quot; Illian protested in their secret language (A/N: &#39;I lov yu!&#39;)<br><br>&quot;Pel cheedaware mwv,&quot; Constance snapped back.

Don&#39;t you think she&#39;s hot?&quot;<br><br>Constance looked at Aurora. She was 5&#39;0&#39;&#39; with curly blonde hair dyed with dark red-brown streaks, worn in a ponytail down to her mid-back. She had dazzling blue eyes just like Jaycacia&#39;s, and was wearing a PPC uniform but cut to be flattering to her curves and show her stomach and also she wore big sexy boots.<br><br>&quot;I do think she&#39;s hot,&quot; she said, and Aurora blushed prettily. &quot;So are you planning on having sex with her?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Riol rilwrev pev,&quot; said Illian, &quot;ka rwl rilwrev pev, ka kioth rithwrev pev!&quot; (A/&#39;: &#39;I wil sleep wit her &amp; ill sleep with yu &amp; all selp with everone!&#39;) He threw his arms wide, and Constance looked at him in awe.<br><br>&quot;I think I prefer you now you&#39;re blue,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&#39;s have sex.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ok,&quot; said Illian.<br><br>The SO looked at Jaycacia. <i>Let&#39;s have sex.</i><br><br>&quot;Ok.&quot; Jaycacia looked around at everyone. &quot;Let&#39;s have sex.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ok,&quot; said everyone.<br><br>So they all took their clothes off (A/n egsept Jaycacia who was already nud!!) and then Illian had sex with Constance in the missionary position, and Jaycacia had sex with the SO in the doggy position, and Aurora had sex with Supernumberary in the butterfly position, and Al&#39;s Waiter had sex with Jay in the spoons position, and then Illian had sex with Aurora in the cowgirl position, and Constance had sex with Supernumberary in the lotus position, and Jaycacia had sex with Jay in the reverse cowgirl position, and the SO had sex with Al&#39;s Waiter in the lateral coital position, and then Illian had sex with Al&#39;s Waiter in the reverse cowgirl position, and Jay had sex with Supernumberary in the suspended congress position, and Constance had sex with the SO in the leapfrog position, and Aurora had sex with Supernumberary in the T-square position, and then finally they all had sex at the same time in all the different positions.<br><br>&quot;Wow,&quot; said Jaycacia, &quot;that was really good. I&#39;m glad I came back from being trapped at the beginning of time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes it was,&quot; said her lovers, &quot;and so are we.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But wait!&quot; exclaimed Jaycacia, and her hair began to glow brighter. &quot;Something&#39;s wrong... no, something&#39;s <i>right</i>... that&#39;s impossible!&quot;<br><br>&quot;What is?&quot; asked her lovers.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m... pregnant!&quot;<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;Dear sweet generic deities...&quot; groaned Jay. &quot;What is she </i>on<i>?&quot;<br><br>Acacia looked smug. &quot;I&#39;m well out of it,&quot; she said. &quot;In fact, hey, I wasn&#39;t in the last one, either. Life is good.&quot;<br><br>Jay scowled at her. &quot;And women - even Roman women - who comment on that fact get their comeuppance.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Says you,&quot; Acacia sniffed. &quot;But Legal has no authority over me, and I left the </i>Parcae<i> behind two thousand years ago.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jay agreed, &quot;but you haven&#39;t left </i>me<i> behind... and it&#39;s my spare bed you&#39;re sleeping in.&quot;<br><br>Acacia sat bolt upright. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t </i>dare<i>!&quot;</i></p>

Supernumberary! The other parent of your baby is Jay... and the baby is Dafydd and also Al&#39;s Waiter (because they are the same person)!&quot;<br><br>Jay gasped. &quot;But then why are they blue!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because of who <i>thy</i> parents are,&quot; intoned Lux. &quot;For you see, you are the baby currently in Al&#39;s Waiter&#39;s tummy - and your other parent is Dafydd!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Incredible!&quot; explained Al&#39;s Waiter.<br><br>&quot;Dafydd!&quot; Lux declared, starting to have sex with Jay as well as Aurora. &quot;The other parent of <i>thy</i> baby is...

And thy baby is Supernumberary!&quot;<br><br>Constance looked smug. &quot;You can consider that payback for making me have all our other babies and also for cheating on me and walking out on me,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;And Constance,&quot; continued Lux, &quot;thy baby&#39;s father is Supernumberary, and the baby is... yourself!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Incredible!&quot; gasped Illian. &quot;I never would have guessed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sunflower Official!&quot; announced Lux.<br><br><i>Me, too?</i> the SO said. <i>It should be impossible... but I can feel it!</i><br><br>&quot;And it is well you can,&quot; said Lux, &quot;for the other parent of your baby is Constance - and the baby is Aurora!&quot;<br><br><i>Unbelievable!</i> said the SO. <i>But I believe you!</i><br><br>Now Lux began to have sex with Illian and Constance at the same time. &quot;Jay,&quot; she said, &quot;you finally have the pleasure of bearing Jaycacia&#39;s baby... and that baby will be the SO!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Jaycacia gently. &quot;Who else but the Starflower and the PPC&#39;s number one Assassin could ever be my husband&#39;s parents?&quot;<br><br>Now Lux looked troubled, and she stopped having sex with <i>anyone</i>. (A/N: DUN DUM DUUUUUUN!!!!&quot;!) &quot;Aurora,&quot; she said, turning to Aurora, &quot;you will face difficult times. For the baby you bear is Dafydd&#39;s, and her name will be... Acacia Byrd!&quot;<br><br>Aurora gasped and burst into tears, so Illian went to comfort her.<br><br>Jaycacia looked worried. &quot;But what about <i>my</i> baby?&quot; she asked. &quot;What can you tell about my baby?&quot;<br><br>Lux went over to her and ran her hands over her stomach. &quot;Its father is the SO,&quot; she said, &quot;as I believe you know. And its destiny...&quot; She shook her head. &quot;I cannot see. Its destiny is too bright, too fierce, for my magickckckc. But...&quot; She stood back and looked at Jaycacia seriously. &quot;Given the circumstances,&quot; she said seriously, &quot;there is only one person it <i>can</i> be!&quot;<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;Jay.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mm?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What are you scribbling?&quot;<br><br>Jay beamed manically at her ex-partner. &quot;My Jaycacia-approved family tree,&quot; she said. &quot;Did you know I&#39;m apparently my own grandmother? Twice? I&#39;m yours, as well.&quot;<br><br>Acacia shuddered and downed her coffee. &quot;I think I feel worst for Constance,&quot; she said. &quot;She&#39;s her </i>own<i> mother? How does that work?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s her own granny, too,&quot; Jay mused, then shrugged and got to her feet. &quot;I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s not </i>true<i>. So, want another drink before the next chapter?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What next chapter?&quot; Acacia asked. &quot;Didn&#39;t you see the author&#39;s note?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ooh, it&#39;s over and I didn&#39;t even notice? Awesome.&quot; Jay bounced over to the sofa. &quot;Show!&quot;</i><br><br>~<br><br>A/N: So tahts it! TEH END! I hop you lieked my sotry! Suprising, huh?!?!?! Plz R+R!!!!!<br><br><b>Jaycacia Thornbyrd will return, in... <i>The Child of Jaycacia Thornbyrd</i></b><br><br>((And that&#39;s a wrap. No more Jaycacia this year - thank the stars! I hope you had as much &#39;fun&#39; as I did.<br><br>Also, yes, I drew out the &#39;family tree&#39;, and it is as horrifying as it sounds. On the plus side, I&#39;m pretty sure an entirely closed genetic loop is incapable of accumulating the flaws seen in other incestuous situations...<br><br>And for the record: Lux&#39;s portrayal is entirely in-character with her previous appearance in the Jaycaciaverse. And Nesh - sorry! ~hS))</p>

            <p>Author Profile: Hi! I&#39;m a girl who loves fantasy stories and especially dragons. I&#39;ve already written most of a novel (it&#39;s way better than Twilight) and someday I&#39;m going to be a real author! I&#39;m so excited to be here! :D<br><br>Title: First impressions<br><br>Summary: Deriks’ first mission into Eragon goes . . . depending on how you look at it very wrong or very right ;)<br><br>Genres: Action/Hurt/Comfort<br><br>Rating: T to be safe because *somebody* gets what&#39;s coming to them.<br><br>Derik was standing in thew oods outside Carvahall by himself disguised as a genreic villager and waiting in silence. He had heard about this continuum was full of Canon Sues and Stus and could only assume this was a cruel joke from the Flowers because it had dragons. Hadn’t he suffered enough losing his own dragon had almost killed him? Now he was stuck in an awful continuum having to save a whiny brat of a dragon rider the likes of which woudn’t even have survived a hatching (A/N: It’s been forever snce I read Pern I don’t remember what teh ceremony is called *Shrug*)<br><br>There was the Sue—the one he was allowed to kll anyway. She was a elf woman with enbony black hair and electric blue eyes with delicately pointed ears and luminisecent moon skin. She also ripped off the scene in the LotR movies with Arewen Derik threw up in his mouth a little bit.<br><br>Sue: Freeze, mortal.<br><br>Derik didn’t rwrite down the charge of slang his gaze was fixed on the egg gleamed in the moonlight. Its shell was deep blue and iridescent like lapis lazuli but perfectly smoth and oval. It was smaller than a Pern’d sdragon egg. It was stll close enough for Derik to feel the sfamiliar longing. But nothing could replace his Skephanth. Just thinking about him made him start to flash back. His memories of Pern weren’t exatly real but they were real enough of avoiding Thread or burning it or the Between had stayed in his mind particularly. He wondered if Skepnath was just gone or trapped in Between forever. <br>Derik didn’t know which would be worse<br><br>Derik didn’t remember what happened next but he guessed a time shift had taken him to the next morning. The sun was up and Eragon and the Sue—her name was Angel—wer cuddling next to the egg. Derik had to read the words said the two had argued over who could take the egg but Angel had fainted so Eragon stayed with her and the egg all night to protect them because he felt protective of the Sue. Of course he did.<br><br>Derik knew from the words he read that Eragon was having a dream of angel’s past. Glablatorix had killed her patnetns in front of her—they had been some of the last Dragon Riders which was why she wanted to be Saphira’s rider. That only made Eragon felt more protective.<br><br>It was getting hard for Derik to concentrate on the mission with the egg right there. Somehow, he could almost sente the baby dragon inside, warm and alive and eager to hatch to bad her future rider was such a perfect fool. He would turn a perfectly good dragon into another Sue—or at least a Cute ANimal Friend.<br><br>Angel stirred and her eleyis fluttered.<br><br>It wasn’t fair. Derik’s fsits clenched. Saphira was just as bad off as skepnath—not going to die but trapped because of a Sue. He couldn’t let that happen to another dragon.<br><br>Derik didn’t realize his weapons were in his hands until he was lafway across the clearing. He’d drawn his sword and was swinging it down at the Sue. He didn’t care about Charges; she was a sue and it was obvious.<br><br>Angel’s eyes opened as the blade came down, and she just had time for one screqech burst ouf of her before the sword took off her head. Slue blood stained the ground glittery, and Eragon woke up. He was still confused by the Sue’s influence as Derik turned on him, shaking.<br><br>Derik: I need to do this right. You, Eragon, are chrged with being a Gary Stu. With being an author=insert with a boring personality and your name is one letter from Dragon and everything handed to you instead of threading earning it and whining about everyone else doing all the hard work for you, getting super magical powers, controlling the dragon is almost the last of her species and deserves much better than you!<br>“Huh?”<br><br>The egg’s shell began to crack. Drawing in a deep breath, Derik turned back on Eragon.<br><br>“For these crimes you ar sentenced do death.”<br><br>Eragonw as still just af armboy by this point and couldn’t do anything to stop the sword going into his liver. He let out a choking noise and collapsed, dying quickly. As he did the world rumbled, and the words began to fall apart. Sheathing his sword Derik snatched up the egg. The cracks sread across its shell. He portealed away, landing in his RC.<br><br>As he put the egg on his bed began to flake off pieces. He coruched beside it and watched intently. Bits flew off until the egg efell apart and a tiny blue dragon tumbled out. Her wings tangled around her and Derik pulled them away she looked at him and he felt a familiar feeling in his head.<br><br>Derik?<br><br><br>oOo<br><br>Derik stood in the SO’s office. SO: What are you doing here?<br><br>Derik looked surprised. “I broke a PPC rules state that canon characters can’t be killed. Even Sutes.”<br><br>“Oh. Right. That was because we thought that if you killed canon characters the canon would break: Your recent activity has merely caused the Eragon universe to shift. Murtagh is now the protagonist and the word world is much better. We will be sending agents into Twilight and other continua to fix them too. You’re going to be rewarded.”<br><br>Derik stared in amazement. “Then—<br><br>“You can keep Saphira.”<br><br>Derik I call her Saphirath now.<br><br>The SO shrugged. He dismissed Derik, who ran back down the hall led back to his RC where Saphirath was waiting eagerly. Derik didn’t have to tell her the news had already reached her throught heir telepathic link and she tackled him as he came through the doors.<br><br>“Derik!” She was still a baby but she knew his anme and her name and knew he was very happy so she was too.<br><br>The console beeped but Derik didn’t pay attention to the fact that tears were coing down his face either as he reached out and touched the dragon’s nose. She ran her head under his fingeriips with a purring noise like a happy kitty. H felt whole again.<br>---<br><br>I feel I should note that MS Word did its darndest to fix my typos—I had to go back and manually reenter quite a few.<br><br>-Thantosiet</p>

            <p>You know, I&#39;m having a hard time coming up with in-character badficcer reviews of this because it&#39;s just a few shakes shy of actually being good. O.o Like, the one majorly canon-breaking thing is that Derik would never, ever deliberately set himself up for getting a new dragon, even a non-Pernese one. The rest... I can kinda see it. Even through xXxDragonLoverxXx&#39;s weird habit of sticking different thoughts together where the words happen to match.<br><br>So... Kudos for that?

            <p>I usually try to incorporate something I legitimately like into my parody badfics, give them a grain of sincerity. In that case it&#39;s the fact that Derik is a fascinating character, and the Inheritance Cycle would be a painful continuum for him both because of his personal issues and that series&#39; flaws. For the thoughts thing, I figure Dragon&#39;s stopping a lot and starting again halfway through the sentence without looking back at what came before or something.<br><br>Now I&#39;m wondering if I should try to revise it to make it either good or way worse...</p>

            <p>Because this idea has been eating at me since I worked on the Artemis and Bodldops stuff on the wiki, earlier this year.  This is my take on a possible scene while Halley was <a href="http://agent-halley.livejournal.com/3240.html">stuck in Mid-World.</a>  There is some <b>NSFW</b> language to be found below.<br><br>Halley belongs to bodldops.  The man in black and Mid-World belong to Stephen King.  The Shades and Gaspode the Wonder-Dog belong to Terry Pratchett.  I just discovered last night that a friend I had loaned some books to has lost my copies of the first four <i>Dark Tower</i> novels, so the MiB will probably be acting more like he did at the end of the series than he did at the beginning.  This scene does contain one major spoiler for <i>The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower</i>.  (As in, it literally spils the entire series, you will not be able to enjoy the books at all if you read this first.)<br>* * *
<br>As Halley began to wake up, she felt an uncomfortable heat beating down on her above.  Sunlight, surely, but the Shades weren&#39;t well-known for being very brightly-lit.  As she began stirring, trying to get to her feet, she discovered three very important details about her knew and unknown location.<br><br>1. There was hard-packed sand beneath her.<br><br>2. Her hands and feet were tied.<br><br>3. She had a massive bruise on the right side of her forehead, which she had inadvertently just scratched across the aforementioned sand.<br><br>Halley cried out, opening her eyes, and snapping her body up and into a kneeling position.  The sun and sand had vaguely impressed into her groggy head that she had found her way into either a desert or a beach, an she now saw that it was, indeed, a desert.  It was a long expanse of white with no obvious landmarks.<br><br>There was, however, a man dressed in black standing right in front of her.  He had been grinning, and now grinned even wider.  &quot;Greetings, Lady-sai!&quot;  He bent down one leg and bowed, holding a closed fist against his forehead.  &quot;Life for you, and life for your crop.  I do say sorry for that goose egg—&quot; He tapped a single finger near his right temple— &quot;But when I saw you pop out of that odd thinny-hole, I just <i>had</i> to talk to you.&quot;  His grin—it didn&#39;t seem possible, but it got <i>even wider</i>teeth bright and white, and glinting down on Halley.<br><br>She shivered a bit, despite the desert heat.  When she first saw a smiling figure in black, she figured it was another agent.  After all, she had worn black herself for her vacation back to the Disc.  (It was a good color in the Shades, but also useful for identifying yourself to other agents out on missions.)  But this man&#39;s weird behavior, and speech, and, well, the fact he had apparently knocked her out and tied her up, definitely did not point in that direction.  He almost looked like a cowboy, with chaps and boots and a vest worn over a button-down collared shirt, all in black except for the buttons.  the only thing missing was a wide-brimmed Stetson, but the man wore no hat.  His hair was, again, black, and fell all around his head in messy strands.<br><br>He just continued to stare at her.  He raised his eyebrows, as though surprised at her lack of response.<br><br>&quot;Um.  Hi.&quot;  Halley finally said.  &quot;Sorry, I . . . I&#39;m still a bit woozy.&quot;  Why was she even apologizing?  He was the one who had knocked her out!<br><br>&quot;Hm.&quot;  That unreal smile finally vanished, and a look of contemplation settled over the face of the man in black.  &quot;I still feel the same.  You&#39;re not like her, are you?  Ah, well.  There&#39;s more than one use for a damp rag, eh?&quot;<br><br>Halley, suspecting that she may have been the damp rag in the previous sentence, had been about to argue, but was stopped when she saw the man&#39;s face . . . <i>shift</i>.  There was no other word for it; the nose became just a bit more pointed, the eyes closer together, the mouth sat a bit lower in his face.  For just a hairline of second, Halley could have sworn she was looking at Irvine—not DIA Agent Irvine, but that <i>other</i> one that had been sneaking around HQ for a couple of years.  But less than a second later, it was back to normal.  Halley flailed for a moment, forgetting that her feet were tied and trying to stand, leaving her on her side once again.  &quot;Who are you?  <i>What</i> are you?&quot;<br><br>The man seemed unperturbed.  In fact, he seemed rather bored as he said, &quot;Oh, the name, yes.  Let&#39;s go with . . . Ah, but I had best say &#39;Marten&#39; if I&#39;m taking you back with me, as all in Gilead know me by that one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere with you!&quot;  Halley kicked at the crusted sand forcing herself away from this bizarre person.<br><br>Marten only laughed—a high-pitched, fast-paced giggle that made Halley feel almost physically sick until he stopped—and said, &quot;Look around thyself, cully, and tell me where it is you plan to run to?  &#39;Tis all flat and empty, this Mohaine Desert, though it shouldn&#39;t be <i>quite</i> bad, not yet.<br><br>Halley looked wildly all around, as much as her bound limbs allowed.  The man in black was telling the truth; it was nothing but a flat expanse of sand all around, bleached so white it might have looked like snow in a photograph, with the sun&#39;s heat removed.  Except—<br><br>Halley stopped moving when she it.  There was one spot on the horizon that looked different.  It was the air there; it had a certain shimmer to it beyond what mirages the heat was casting all around.  A place against the sky where the color . . .<br><br>&quot;Wilver,&quot; Halley said aloud.  There was a wilver distortion against the sky.<br><br>&quot;Wilver?&quot;  Marten echoed.  He watched for a moment, then continued, &quot;Ah.  &#39;White&#39; and &#39;silver.&#39;  Yes, she fancies herself a warrior of the White, but really!  She is only here for herself.  And so she casts an off shade of color!  the Wilver; do ye say so?&quot;  He looked expectantly at Halley, grin now gone.<br><br>&quot;Uh.  Sure.  I mean, we call them &#39;Mary Sues,&#39; and I think, for the most part they go for urple over wilver, but wilver&#39;s pretty common, too.&quot;  Halley shook her head.  She shouldn&#39;t say to much; she wasn&#39;t quite sure, but it was seeming more and more likely that this man was a canon in some universe Halley didn&#39;t know.  But it was hard to fight those eyes.  Something in the man&#39;s face made her <i>want</i> to explain herself.  And indeed, as if he realized what she had just realized, that intense look seemed to slide away for a moment.<br><br>&quot;Do you want to know a secret?&quot; Walter said, distracting her.<br><br>&quot;Um.  Honestly, I would rather—&quot;<br><br>&quot;The young Gunslinger is a farce.&quot;<br><br>&quot;. . . The what?&quot;<br><br>Marten giggled again.  &quot;You really are an outsider.  Like her.&quot;  His face shifted again, looking suddenly youthful.  &quot;We have your woman, outsider!&quot;  Then the face settled back into Marten&#39;s.<br><br>Halley glowered.  That had been a line in a horror movie Talia had convinced her to watch one Halloween.  Which meant: &quot;You are inside my head.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hee hee hee!  I try.  Allow me to enlighten you about Gunslingers.  They are the fancy heroic lawmen around here.&quot;  He pretended to hook his thumbs through suspender he didn&#39;t wear and cast a stern frown that might have come from Barney Fife during a proud moment.  Roland, son of Steven, may they rot in hell as I ... both their mothers, seeks to go on a mythical quest to the Dark Tower, where he believes he will enter and put to right all that&#39;s gone wrong—&quot; he gestured at the desert around them&amp;mdsh; &quot;with the world.  <i>Except</i> that he fails every time.&quot;<br><br>Halley quirked an eyebrow.  &quot;He gets redos?&quot;<br><br>The man in black shrugged.  &quot;I get a second chance every time he does, so I suppose I can&#39;t complain.  Especially as I&#39;m a bit of a risk taker, and have a tendency to get killed before Childe Roland comes to the Dark Tower.  But I have a problem now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It sounds like you have <i>lots</i> of problems.&quot;<br><br>Marten ignored Halley.  &quot;This outside force.  She who stands for the Wilver and Urple, as you tell it.  Now, <i>she</i> is the one who enters the room at the top of the Tower.&quot;<br><br>&quot;. . . Oh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now she is getting the second chances.  Now she is starting us over, and starting us <i>far</i> further from the end of her quest than the Tower made Roland do.  I can at least be grateful the Mohaine had moved too close to Gilead—that at least shaves a bit of time off each cycle.  But still, I am losing <i>centuries</i>.&quot;  Here, finally, Marten&#39;s voice took on a vicious growl, his face lost that creepy, pressing smile.  &quot;And no longer does anything change! Even Roland, that smug and stubborn old ass, would do things different, with or without my intervention.  But not, she, oh no, she can&#39;t allow anything to change.  It&#39;s always exactly the same; I still can&#39;t be certain if she doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s happening, or enjoys the attention so much she simply doesn&#39;t care.  I can&#39;t do a thing to fix it, oh no.  I have my parts I am <i>compelled</i> to play, and I must be there to fulfill them.  When I&#39;m near her, my words and actions are not my own.  As though <i>she</i> is in <i>my</i> head, and that is supposed to be <i>my</i> trick on <i>others</i>, may it please thee.&quot;<br><br>Halley&#39;s eyes widened.  There was only one direction this canon could possibly be going with all this.  &quot;But then I came.  I&#39;m something that didn&#39;t happen before.&quot;<br><br>The grin again, so wide and white.  &quot;YES!  Yes, lady-sai, do thee see it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see it.&quot;  <i>See it very well,</i> she thought, which then struck her as odd.<br><br>&quot;You can see what&#39;s happening, when the Deschain family and Roland&#39;s precious ka-tets cannot.  You can act against her, when I cannot.&quot;  He drew a folding knife from the pocket of his chaps and opened it.  He kneeled down over Halley, who stiffened reflexively.  But Marten only smiled—a real smile, for once, a smile of hope mismatched with the face that gave it.  He cut her bonds, and offered a hand to help her stand.  The two, dressed in black, looked out to the cloud of distortion that hung over Gilead in the distance.<br><br>The Sue in wilver fled across the desert, and the agent in black followed.</p>

You are a druid. You do magic!&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is a difference. Did you ever pay attention to the back story when you played the game? We can safely use the magical forces of nature, but when our ancestors discovered this well of arcane magic, they called the demons from the Netherworld upon us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you need to know the canon,&quot; insisted Hieronymus.<br><br>&quot;How can I know that the magic in this book is not arcane? I will not take the risk.&quot;<br><br>Hieronymus gave in. &quot;Well then, there may be an alternative.&quot; He turned the monitor to an angle more convenient to be read by two persons sitting side by side, but not too close together. &quot;Sit here and look what I found on the Internet.&quot;<br><br>Androia pulled a chair over to the console and sat down, carefully keeping a distance that would neither insult her partner by obviously staying away nor provoke unwanted action by undercutting his cuddling radius. Then she read what was displayed on the screen:<br><br> Books &gt; Harry Potter<br><b>Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles )</b><br>By: proudhousewife<br>Do you want your little ones to read books; and they want to read the Harry Potter Books; but you do not want them to turn into witches?

            <p>(Issuer’s note: I post this again for my friend, although I cannot agree here. Implying that the Department of Inaccuracies doesn’t actually exist is ridiculous. Hrnms.)<br><br>Author’s Note: I may like to do more chapters. The miracle of Harry instantly knowing the whole holy scripture by heart deserves a honorary mention, as well as unnecessarily prayparating to Hogwarts when they could just as well take the Gospel Express or the Enlighten Bus. I would like to ask how her husband prayperating dinner and breakfast makes Minerva a good housewife and to speculate about which plot we will get with Voldemort. Will he abandon all religion, or will he abandon freedom of religion to establish one religion to fit all? But in case Real Life continues to interfere, I remembered the good tradition of writing the epilogue first. If this follows chapter 1, please pretend that Hieronymus returned from the bathroom.<br><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>&quot;You know,&quot; said Hieronymus, &quot;if the Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies really existed, they should be sent in to replace some wrong words. To begin with, change Harry Potter to Gary Toddler, and make the Dursleys Lobelia and Herman Unbecome.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What should we do with Dudley?&quot; (A/N: If Dudley was not mentioned yet, ignore this question and the following answer.)<br><br>&quot;Just remove the one line that mentions him? There’s no real reason why this should be there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And then send Gary to Pigfarts? That might be fun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Androia! Did you secretly watch A Very Potter Musical behind my back?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course not. I just extrapolated. Is this really a thing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is, and since it’s already taken, we can’t use Pigfarts, and we still need a new name for Hagrid.&quot;<br><br> (A/N: At the end of the second chapter, we still don’t know that Athena McGoodyshoes didn’t adopt her husband’s name and that Hippolyta Stranger is supposed to be their foster daughter.  Since I don’t intend to include stage directions for every chapter this epilogue may be attached to, I decided to stop before we try to find new names for every character at school. Also, I ran out of names :-).)<br><br>&quot;I would like Rufus Goodfellow,&quot; suggested Androia.<br><br>Hieronymus looked puzzled for a moment, but then let it slip to ask the more important question. &quot;So you agree that this is original fiction and you can’t learn anything about Harry Potter from it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What? No! I learn a lot from reading this. You tell me what is uncanonical, and then talk about canon and science and – are you aware that you talked more today than you did for the whole last week?&quot;<br><br>This was the moment when the console made “Bip”, and the displayed chapter was replaced by a message.<br><br><i>Stop this nonsense now! Since you will be assigned to the Harry Potter Division, Agent Androia is required to know the original books.

            <p>(continued)<br><br>&quot;Hagrid laughed wisely. ‘Evolution is a fairytale. You don&#39;t really believe that, do you?’&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;’Yes, I do!’ Aunt Petunia screeched.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But she probably got it all wrong.&quot;<br><br>&quot;’Well then prove it!’ – Can you prove it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Actually no, because science doesn’t actually prove anything ever. We just attempt to describe the world in a formalized way that allows calculating the outcome of future events. If what happens doesn’t match the calculations, the hypothesis is disproved. If there is enough evidence that the world matches our calculations, the hypothesis may be promoted to the status of a theory, or even a natural law. But dropping five hundred billion stones still doesn’t prove that nobody will ever find a way to disprove Newton’s law of gravity.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is interesting, I –&quot;<br><br>&quot;From a scientific point of view, it&#39;s entirely possible that somebody created the world just yesterday or last year, and that the creator faked our memories, wrote our history books and arranged all these false evidence to make us believe that the universe must exist since at least several billion years. This hypothesis is inherently non-disprovable, it&#39;s just not very useful. Sorry, I interrupted you?&quot;<br><br>“I once tried to drop a bird,&quot; said Androia. &quot;It flew high up into the air. Did I disprove the law of gravity?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, if you experiment with living beings, you get into dealing with the concepts of free will and defying entropy. Next time, try to drop an airship or a balloon, and then learn something about buoyancy. The so-called natural laws are actually simplifications that work in many circumstances, but if you want to make them work in all circumstances, you have to take additional factors into account, and it becomes more and more complex. If we ever find the perfect description of everything, it may be so complex that a universe-sized computer would be needed to do the calculations.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wonder whether Petunia knows this. –<br><br>&quot;Aunt Petunia could only stare at him; and her big mouth hung open dumbly. Here she thought she was so educated; and always demanded that Christians prove what they believed in; but she couldn&#39;t even prove her own religion. It was then that Harry knew who the smart one here was! – Demanding to prove what we believe is a bit stupid. Why would we need to believe if we knew?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t see how either of them won the argument. They’re both stupid.”<br><br>&quot;&#39;Tell me how to get to this heaven place!&#39; Harry cried wistfully, clasping his hands together. Sometimes, the wisdom of little ones is really amazing. We think we grownups know it all; but then God speaks through the mouths of little ones; and shows us how we are all mortals struggling along the path of life. Humility.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s god who speaks, but I wouldn&#39;t say that this is entirely wrong – except Harry&#39;s behavior in this story.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;All you have to do is be saved. Do you want to be saved?&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sounds easy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;I do, I do!&#39; Harry squealed, jumping up and down.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Really, Harry is supposed to be eleven! Do eleven years old kids act like this Harry? I don&#39;t remember, it&#39;s been a long time.”<br><br>&quot;There is no sense in asking me. You made me full grown up and gave me no childhood memories.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s how the game works. Can we watch how Harry is saved now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Then pray the sinner&#39;s prayer!&#39; – What is the sinner’s prayer?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dunno. You may look it up when we finished this chapter. We&#39;re nearly there.&quot;  <br><br>&quot;Aunt Petunia tried to stop him; but she was powerless against Harry&#39;s pure, innocent, holy energy. Soon, Harry had said the prayer. Hagrid beamed happily.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, that <i>was</i> easy.&quot; <br><br>&quot;&#39;You&#39;re a Christian now, Harry!&#39; Hagrid cried proudly. – That is it? Where is the conflict? The character growth? The struggling for doing good over easy?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Good over easy? Did you secretly read the books?&quot; <br><br>&quot;No, I just extrapolated. And look, it is not over yet –<br><br>&quot;Harry smiled but then interrogated, &#39;But how do I be a Christian? I don&#39;t know how!&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Does he <i>grill</i> Hagrid?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Hagrid grinned widely. &#39;There is only one place to learn that-Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles!&#39; – Oh, he dropped the closing parenthesis.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re right. The title says Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles right bracket&quot;.<br><br>&quot;May this be a typo?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That’s possible. Or maybe, for some weird reason, this site doesn’t display the full sideways smile you get when you type a colon, a hyphen and a closing parenthesis.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You mean this may be a parody? And it was even intended to show in the title, but it does not work? &quot;<br><br> &quot;Excuse me, a have to go to the bathroom. We&#39;ll discuss this later.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And there is another <i>Author&#39;s Note: SO what do you all think? I may not be a professional writer; but I think I am being given the talent to pull this off in service of a greater mission equal sign closing bracket.</i><br><br>&quot;<i>Blessings!</i><br><br>&quot;<i>- Grace Ann</i>  – I wonder what Hieronymus would have said to this if he were still here.&quot;<br><br>(may be continued)<br><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>And another author&#39;s note: It is hard work to navigate this minefield with an Agnostic raised Christian and a Believer in a fictitious religion I know nearly nothing about. They are so easily distracted by their own issues. But it’s fun so far.<br><br>I hope I didn&#39;t offend anybody. <br><br>I also hope I didn&#39;t butcher <i>World of Warcraft</i> canon too much. <br><br>HG.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1<br><br>&quot;<i>Author&#39;s Note: Hello, friends! My name is Grace Ann. I&#39;m new to this whole fanfiction thing; but recently, I&#39;ve encountered a problem that I believe this is the solution to. My little ones have been asking to read the Harry Potter books; and of course I&#39;m happy for them to be reading; but I don&#39;t want them turning into witches! So I thought….. why not make some slight changes so these books are family friendly? And then I thought, why not share this with all the other mommies who are facing the same problem? So-Ta da! Here it is! I am SO excited to share this with all of you! So, without further ado-</i> &quot;<br><br>&quot;This is not what the summary said,&quot; grumbled Hieronymus. &quot;I&#39;ve read fiction that had no magic and still wasn&#39;t family friendly.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I bet you also <i>wrote</i> some fiction that was not family friendly, specifically about us. I just never found it, yet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s unfair,&quot; complained Hieronymus. &quot;How often do I need to apologize? There are really only the two pieces you know, and I tried to be subtle about the matter.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I would not call it subtle,&quot; retorted Androia. &quot;But since there was some magic involved, my comment may have been missing the point. I apologize for this. Now let me read further.&quot; And thus she ended this inane argument and continued reading. <br><br>&quot;Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Harry Potter who lived under the stairs in a house on Privet Drive with his aunt and uncle. He was a good, obedient boy who did all his chores;  –&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now that&#39;s not how I would describe him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;– but he felt that there was something missing in his life.&quot;<br><br>&quot;May have been his parents.&quot;<br><br> Androia raised her voice. &quot;Something big and special; but he could not quite name it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The names might be Mrs. and Mr. Potter.&quot;<br><br> &quot;He stayed up every night; and wished for this special something; but then one day, there was a knock at his door-and everything changed.&quot; Androia stopped reading to ask &quot;Hieronymus? Do you know that it is impolite to interrupt when somebody else is speaking?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sorry, I&#39;m still not over this author&#39;s note. I always thought that Harry Potter <i>is</i> family friendly, and now I&#39;m afraid that her take on family-friendliness may be quite different from mine. The start doesn&#39;t look good. She may have changed more than would be good for our purpose.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You saying that the main character is not characterized properly does worry me. I admit this. But do you also imply that the original book revealed everything about Harry&#39;s parents in the first paragraph? I would probably call this bad story-telling. And it seems clear enough here. Mrs. and Mr. Potter are not available for some reason that is still unknown, so that these kind people took Harry in, although their house is so small that they cannot even give him a spare room to live in.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Part of the problem is that the Dursleys aren’t kind. They dislike Harry so much that they don’t want to waste a room on him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So I got this wrong. But it may be clarified later. And I am curious who may be at the door. May I continue now, uninterrupted?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Go on then. I hope we will not be drowned in semicolons,&quot; muttered Hieronymus.<br><br>&quot;’Answer the door, Harry!’ his Aunt Petunia, a career woman, barked from her armchair where she sat with her feet up. She had short, curly blonde hair and never wore any makeup. Uncle Vernon nodded sheepishly from the kitchen; and put a tray of moist, chocolatey brownies in the oven.&quot;<br><br>Hieronymus shook his head in disbelieve. <br><br>&quot;What is wrong now?&quot; asked Androia. &quot;We get a strong female character, and a male character who is not above helping with the household work. Is this not what we want for children to read?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just read on,&quot; sight Hieronymus.<br><br>&quot;<i>Shouldn&#39;t you be doing that?</i> Harry thought; but he was a very obedient young boy, so he answered the door right away. He turned the brass, metal doorknob; and pulled open the heavy, wooden door.&quot;<br><br>“Now this sounds actually sensible. Don’t let your little kid open the door for a stranger, while you’re just sitting in your armchair. In case it is an alien monster, you are better suited to defend yourself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You see, it is already clarified that this Aunt Petunia is not as nice as I thought. It may not be word for word what you expected, but it is an accurate retelling and I can learn from it. Now let me see whether it is an alien monster – <br><br>&quot;On the porch was standing a huge, muscular man with a big, manly beard; and he was dressed in a plaid, red shirt, blue jeans, and sturdy, leather boots. His chest was covered in a thick, unruly carpet of coarse, brown hair. He wore a necklace that looked to Harry like a lowercase T. Just looking at Harry feel happy, peaceful somehow; but  ...&quot; Androias voice trailed off. She frowned. &quot;Who is looking at Harry? Why do they specifically look at Harry feel  happy and why does Harry feel happy in the first place? His recent thoughts didn’t sound happy.&quot;<br><br>“I’ve no idea who this man might be,&quot; admitted Hieronymus. &quot;But I think it may make more sense if Harry looked at something that’s unfortunately missing there, and looking at it made him feel happy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will take a wild guess then, and also correct the tense shift,&quot; agreed Androia. “Just looking at the little tee Harry felt happy, peaceful somehow; but he couldn&#39;t say why!  – Well, I could not say either, but it appears to make more sense this way. Let me see whether I guessed right –<br><br>&quot;’Good morning, kiddo,’ the man greeted amiably; and smiled at Harry. He had the peaceful, friendly sort of face you just knew you could trust. ‘My name is Hagrid. Could I speak to your mommy and daddy?’&quot;<br><br>&quot;He’s meant to be Hagrid? This is far too rushed! Hagrid should not appear before chapter four! And since you don’t allow me to interrupt you, I would also like to mention now that up there I wondered how Harry could see the unruly carpet of coarse, brown hair through the man’s red shirt.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I just assumed that Harry got X-ray sight. Since you imply that this is not the case, should I fear that there may still be some magic left in this retelling?&quot;<br><br>“I don’t think so. There will probably be a reasonable explanation. Read on.&quot;<br><br>&quot;’I don&#39;t have a mommy or daddy,’ Harry replied sadly; and looked at his raggedy, old shoes that were blue. Perhaps that was why he felt so lonely, he thought, not for the first time. Maybe that was what he was missing-a mommy and daddy. But no, that was not quite right. – Look, there was no need to interrupt me with sarcastic remarks in the first paragraph.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Okay, I apologize for talking out of order,&quot; said Hieronymus, not using any adverb. &quot;But I wonder what he might have missed even more than his parents.”<br><br>&quot;’I am so sorry to hear that!’ Hagrid uttered empathetically.  – I wonder,&quot; added Androia, &quot;how you utter something empathetically. May this be a case of the threaded Thesaurus Abuse?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Maybe.&quot; Hieronymus’ response was quite monosyllabic. &quot;Go on.&quot;<br><br>&quot;’You can speak with my auntie and uncle,’ Harry retorted politely; and blinked his big, blue, childlike eyes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Green,&quot; groaned Hieronymus, &quot;his eyes are green. You know, she may be retelling the movies. But even then a lot is left out.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wouldn’t know,&quot; replied Androia, using a contraction once just for the fun of confusing the reader. &quot;Are Harry’s eyes blue in the movies? Did you notice that the semicolons are back? Can you imagine a polite retort? &quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, they are. Don’t tell me you missed them. There was just one short paragraph with no semicolon in it. And no, I can’t. &quot;<br><br>&quot;Well then – ‘What do you want?’ Aunt Petunia peered out the door with her narrow, suspicious eyes; and she was wearing a baggy, unflattering pantsuit.&quot; Androia hesitated. “Is this, together with short, curly blonde hair, and a career woman never wearing any makeup, an accurate description of Harry’s aunt?” she asked at last.<br><br>&quot;The eyes and hair may be canon, but –&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don’t want to sound misogynistic, but from what I have seen of World One media, I would expect that it is impossible to be a woman, have a career, and never wear makeup.  Wearing a nice dress at work and baggy pantsuits at home I can imagine though, and I am not sure whether this is meant to be set in World One.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your definitions of career may differ. You think big business’ Chief Executive Officer, she thinks mechanic in overalls. But what I wanted to say before you interrupted me – canonically Harry’s aunt is a housewife, while Harry’s uncle is something like a CEO and never seen doing any household work.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So they were changed into their opposites? Why should this be?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I haven’t any idea. I hope we’ll find out when you read further.&quot; <br><br>&quot;&#39;Hello, neighbor! I was wondering if you have been saved,&#39; Hagrid exclaimed brightly; and tipped his wide-brimmed, straw cowboy hat.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Will somebody please say something unadverbalized,&quot; grumbled Hieronymus. “We’ve already dropped most of the speech tags to compensate for the overflow.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aunt Petunia laughed a gravelly laugh; and leaned forward on her sturdy, practical boots. &#39;Saved? Don&#39;t tell me you are you – ah, there is one you too much here – one of those Christians?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Two,&quot; murmured Hieronymus for no apparent reason.<br><br>&quot;Harry did not know what that word meant; but Hagrid&#39;s smile was the most peaceful smile he had ever seen. It made Harry feel warm and happy inside just seeing the glowing, radiant grin on the kind, friendly stranger&#39;s face. He wondered why Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon did not smile like that... I am not sure what I shall do with this ellipsis here. If this implies that the narrator’s voice trails off and there is a pause, I may take the chance to comment on the word that Harry does not know. It is one of World One’s bigger religions, but not being native to this world, I never studied it in detail. I suppose that Christians are obligated to always smile and save people? &quot;<br><br>Hieronymus winced. &quot;That’s what this version of Aunt Petunia may believe. But most of us – ah, most Christians I know, I mean –&quot;<br><br>&quot;But Hagrid is meant to represent Christians! Or maybe he is not? Oh –<br><br>&quot;&#39;Yes, I am,&#39; Hagrid replied kindly. &#39;Are you?&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I’m not,&quot; mumbled Hieronymus.<br><br>&quot;Aunt Petunia laughed again; and stuck her pointy, sharp nose up in the air. &#39;We are too smart for that. Haven&#39;t you read Dawkins? God is dead! Dawkins proved that. Would you like us to educate you on the Dawkins?&#39; – Who or what is the Dawkins?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Clinton Richard Dawkins, famous British biologist and atheist,&quot; explained Hieronymus, who had quickly googled this on his smartphone that had never been mentioned before. &quot;You know, that’s interesting,&quot; he continued. &quot;To prove that god is dead, it seems necessary to prove that he was once alive first. I may need to read Dawkins works to find out how he did this.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Can we pretend that this is not the right time to get lost in the internet?&quot; asked Androia, slightly worried.<br><br>Hieronymus shrugged. &quot;Oh well, it may not be worth the effort; Aunt Petunia probably got this wrong anyway. Go on, then.&quot;<br><br>&quot;’What is a Christian?’ Harry queried innocently; and scuffed his shoe on the shaggy, yellow carpet which had not been vacuumed in quite some time. &quot;<br><br>&quot;Uncanon,&quot; snarked Hieronymus. &quot;Petunia is one of the tidiest persons I’ve ever seen. Is she so busy having a career in this AU that she didn’t find the time to hire a cleaner?&quot;<br><br>&quot;’Christians are people who want to be good,’ Hagrid explained wisely; and crouched down so he was on eye level with Harry. ‘We want to go to heaven after we die. Do you know what heaven is, Harry?’ &quot; Androia frowned. &quot;Implying that people who are not Christians do not want to be good is a bit unfortunate. I might feel offended. And, supposing that this heaven is a good place, doing good only because they want to go to heaven sounds like a quite selfish motive. But you seem to believe that Hagrid does not represent Christians well. Can you educate me on the topic what a Christian is, then?&quot;<br><br>A brief smile showed on Hieronymus&#39; face. It had been a long time since she had asked for education. But the smile vanished soon. Better not touch these shameful memories. And concerning the topic – <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s – complicated. You should ask a priest.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You should ask a priest! This is what you made me say whenever somebody asked why I knelt at a moon well. It is not fair to quote it back on me!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I’m sorry. I don’t know your religion, and I don&#39;t even know where you got this belief. I just thought I should play you showing some respect at places I perceived as meant to be holy. Unlike some of the guys we’ve seen there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And apparently you do not know your own religion either. We have a serious case of not done the research here. &quot;<br><br>&quot;It’s not my religion. I –&quot;<br><br>“Harry shook his head; and his big eyes were wide and curious.<br><br>&quot;’Heaven is a beautiful place where we can be with God.’ – Is this like being with Ysera in the Emerald Dream? Although – Ysera is not a god, and we do not need to be dead to share the Emerald Dream. Actually, we need to be alive.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don’t know how being in the Emerald Dream is like.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As I said: not done the research. Well, I have to draw on other sources then –<br><br>&quot;Aunt Petunia smacked her hands over Harry&#39;s young ears; and her voice was sickly sweet when she said, ‘Thank you very much for your concern, sir, but he does not need your religion, he has science and socialism and birthdays. Haven&#39;t you heard of Evolution? I have a very good textbook on Evolution that I could give you on it if you would like to learn things.’&quot;<br><br>&quot;Evil Aunt!&quot; shouted Hieronymus. &quot;I don’t need any religion,&quot; he continued calmer. “But I decided this on my own, after checking the facts. You shouldn’t shut your pupil’s ears and eyes. Helicopter parents don’t do any good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Helicopter parents?&quot; asked Androia.<br><br>&quot;They always hover above the kids,&quot; explained Hieronymus, &quot;guarding them against any bad experience that might ever occur, and actually denying them any own experience at all. Effectively, they make the kids more vulnerable to the first bad experience that will inevitably come when they are not around.&quot; <br><br>&quot;This reminds me of something,&quot; said Androia with a faint smile. &quot;But I forgave you, and I predict now that Harry, since he was never allowed to think on his own, will inevitably be lost if his Aunt cannot defeat the intruder.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, Uncle Vernon is apparently of no use there.&quot;<br><br>(to be continued)</p>

But I swear I&#39;m not copying u, lol. I ttly got the idea from some1 else.)<br><br>&quot;Yes, I am aGent Dafydd,&quot; said Dafydd, &quot;but I say again: Who r u, and what r u doing in my RC?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Im AGent Aurora E. Lorra,&quot; said Aurora, &quot;but u can call me Aurora. I fell thru a plothole and now I m here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And I&#39;m Selene,&quot; said Selene. She folder her arms meanly. &quot;Dafydd, we have a mission 2 do. Wat r we going 2 do w/this girl?&quot;<br><br>Dafydd thought 4 a minut. &quot;She must b here 4 a reason. We better take her w/us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;WHAT?&quot; shouted Selene. &quot;U must b joking!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I am not,&quot; said Dafydd. &quot;U don&#39;t want 2 leaver her alone in r RC, do u?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, no,&quot; said Selene. &quot;Ok, she comes w/us. BUT JUST THIS ONCE. When we get back, she goes trait 2 the Flowers, and they can dwal w/her.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ok, I wil go w/u,&quot; said Aurora. &quot;I can use a slingshot and a knife and I have poison dars. I promis I will b really helpful and not ge tin ur way!&quot;<br><br>&quot;We will c,&quot; said Selene, and Aurora frowned at her. Y did she have 2 b so meen?<br><br>&quot;what is the mission?&quot; said Aurora.<br><br>&quot;Middle-earth,&quot; said Dafydd. &quot;Elves enslave a race. A species of witches and warlocks. A Ring that holds the creator’s power. The daughter of the Witch-King. And a pretty land in Angmar.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Interesting,&quot; said Aurora. &quot;Will we b elves?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Dafydd. He set the disguises. &quot;Now lets get this over with.&quot;<br><br>The blue doorway opened, deposited the agents in a tree, and closed again. Selene groaned. &quot;I think there is a branch through my spine.&quot;<br><br>Aurora couldn&#39;t help but gigle a little, even tho she was uncom4table 2.<br><br>“Shh,” whispered Dafydd. “The ‘Sue is right below us. Making a speech from a branch, it seems.”<br><br>&quot;She is <i>weird</i>,&quot; whistpered Aurora.<br><br>The Suehad a waterfall instead of hair, and the ground underneath was all wet, and so were the ppl down there. They wer immortalsthat looked like humans, which waz stupid bcuz only elves r immortal im Middle-earth, and also the elves don&#39;t keep slaves but the immortal ppl were slaves even tho they had magic, which waz also stupid.<br><br>&quot;Her name is Sairalindл,&quot; said Aurora. &quot;What a pretty name. Does it mean anything?”<br><br>“Yes,” said Dafydd. “It means ‘I want to call myself ‘Saira’, so I’ll add a random elvish – or more likely elfish – word to it’. Lindл actually means ‘singer’.”<br><br>Aurora giggled. &quot;Saira-singer.&quot;<br><br>They followed the Sue and collected more charges. Then there wz a scene hwere Sairalindл tried to convince Daeron to steal her ring back. Aurora had a bad feeling about this.<br><br>They portaled 4ward. They reached the king’s study just as Sue put on her wonderful shiny ring and glowed. Selene rolled her eyes, and looked around for Dafydd. He wasn’t hard to spot.<br><br>&quot;I want that ring,&quot; Dafydd said.&quot;<br><br>Selene rolled her eyes.<br><br>I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Auroroa. &quot;It is a poweful Sue weapon. It&#39;s a total canon-distorter.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So?&quot; said Dafydd.<br><br>But then the Sue did soething else stupid and there were spiders singing Avril Lavigne songs, so they had 2 mortal again.<br><br>They arrived in a patch of Generic Terrain (TM), the slightly colder air hinting at a higher altitude. Selene glanced at the words and sighed.<br><br>Dafydd was watching the ‘Sue’s ring as the people prepared for the night, and “Saira felt her ring warm on her finger; it glittered in the moonlight”. This resulted in an interesting image, the silver ring managing to visibly glow warmer whilst simultaneously glittering.<br><br>After a short period of general Angst, an elf stepped out of the shadows.<br><br>“Give it up, slave.”<br><br>“Give up the Halfling, she-elf,” added Dafydd, in a reasonable Nazgul voice.<br><br>Selene smirked.<br><br>&quot;That waz pretty good,&quot; said Aurora.<br><br>dAfydd smiled. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br><br>As the ‘Sue caused the hapless elf to fall off a cliff, he glared at her. He then continued to glare until she left.<br><br>&quot;Dont owrry,&quot; said Aurora. &quot;Wee will get her soon. It&#39;s night now, so let&#39;s get some rest.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ur right,&quot; said Dafydd. &quot;I guess I&#39;m just tired bcuz this Sue is so stupid.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or SUEpid,&quot; said Aurora.<br><br>They all lauged.<br><br>The next morning, it waz time 2 kill the Sue. Aurora got her slingshot ready. The Sue waz standing on top of a hill, and Selene threw a throwing star at her and cut off her hand!<br><br>&quot;U missed!&quot; Said Dafydd. &quot;u were only supposed 2 get her ring finger!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sorry!&quot; said Selene.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I got the other 1!&quot; shouted Aurora, and she used her slingshot 2 hit the Sue&#39;s boyfriedn in the head. He fell down, knocked out.<br><br>Dafydd started 2 charge ths Eue. “Sairalindл and Daeron, you are hereby arrested by agents of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum. You are charged with having impossible hair, multiple stupid descriptions, grandstanding and unnecessary Drama, slandering the entire elvish race by causing them to keep slaves, messing with timescales - there haven&#39;t been &#39;many ages&#39; in Middle-Earth - creating an uncanonical species, to whit, witches and warlocks, with Ainu-esque &#39;magic&#39; – this isn’t Harry Potter, you know. Honestly, why did you have to do that? None of them have used this ‘magic’ except you, and you used that ring for it anyway. Oh, yes... where is that thing?”<br><br>Dafydd went 2 go get the ring. Aurora wanted 2 stop him, but they had 2 finish reading the charges.<br><br>“You are also charged with stealing two canonical names without good reason, having a nonsensical name, giving an elf a non-elven name, speaking in sentence fragments, utilising random italics, employing gratuitous Angst, diminishing the power of the One Ring by having a ring which acts in a similar way, disrupting the flow of time, speaking in brackets, manifesting gags, causing mysterious voices, creating a mini-UnCanon species, using the words &#39;people&#39;, &#39;snuggling&#39;, &#39;each other&#39;, and &#39;bondage&#39; in the same sentence, using stupid turns of phrase, annoying PPC Agents, and being Mary-Sues. For all these offences, you are sentenced to death. Do you have any last words?”<br><br>“You can’t kill me!” cried Saira weakly. “If you do, the elves will-“<br><br>“Whoops, wrong answer,” cut in Selene, and killed her with another throwing star.<br><br>Meanwhile, Dafydd got the ring, and tey dropped the Sue&#39;s body under the NAzgul&#39;s horses 2 b trampled in2 oblivion and Daron was dropped in a 4est somewhere. Then they went back 2 HQ.<br><br>&quot;And now,&quot; said Selene 2 Aurora, &quot;We can deal with u. Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait,&quot; said Dafydd. &quot;I think I like her. We should let her stay.&quot;<br><br>&quot;WHAT?!&quot; shouted Selene, and lignting came from here yes!<br><br>&quot;Y r u so mean?!&quot; yelled Aurora. &quot;I didn&#39;t do nething 2 u!&quot;<br><br>&quot;U do not blong here!&quot; yelled Selene. &quot;Dafydd is MY partner, not urs, and u shoud leave and go back where u came from!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t u think I would if I could?!&quot; cried Aurora, and tears went down her cheecks. &quot;I don&#39;t know how! NEway, I think Dafydd is right, I must b here 4 a reason, and I want 2 stay and help!&quot;<br><br>Dafydd stared at Slene seriously, and finally she stopped the ligtning. &quot;Ok fine. U win this time. But if u cause ne trouble, I wil kill u yself! U got that?&quot;<br><br>&#39;Ok,&quot; said Aurora. &quot;I hope u will c that I just wat 2 help. So! Where do I sleep?&quot;<br><br>(AN: OMY that is the longes chappie I hve ever written!!! Aurora got 2 go on a mission w/Dafydd and Selene! Wow, lol! I had so much fun writing this! I hope u liked reading it. Plz R+R!<br><br>XOXOX)<br><br><br>(( The butchering begins... ))</p>

She ran her fingers through her fiery rev hair that followed over het shoulders. Look in the mirror she saw a woman with perfect breasts, Petty sparking bye eyes , and pink lisps. Today she was wearing a hot pink minis it that emhasixed her curbs. She also wore a glittly sliver top that showed off her boobs. Delilah sliver shoes where worsen on de feet. She walked over to her phone and called her best friend Air Winter. (Did you like it? Chaptah to conin mep weak?!!!!?!!!!,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>(Yay! Flaming!)<br>Wow, I don&#39;t think you could ever get a beta. They&#39;d be too horrified by the job and run away screaming. Your sentences are awful, and your logic is non-existent. Does Fire Love <i> seriously </i> use &#39;Air-chan&#39;? Just because Air Wind is &#39;Japanese&#39; does not mean that everybody around her calls her Air-chan. I think you just wanted to show &#39;ohmigosh! I know soooo much Japanese!&#39; and be an irritating fangirl. (Speaking of, why do so many fanficcers use all this Japanese in their writing?)<br>And why, WHY, are you giving us so much description of their clothes, and not the important stuff? Both of them seem to be in a huge white place with a bed, a phone, and Kamakura town. I&#39;m sure, since you gave such interesting descriptions of their clothes, you could do it!<br>One last thing. The dialogue. There is no way any child would talk like that. Oh! I&#39;ll just randomly ask you what you&#39;ll be wearing, because.... Logic!<br>One last thing part 2. This is so cliche that... I can&#39;t. Japanese girls don&#39;t always wear kimonos, unless this was like... The seventeenth century. <br>I was blown away.<br>By your stupidity.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s my prescription for improved writing:<br><br>1. <i>Write</i>. Write some more. After that, keep writing.<br>2. Read quality published literature of the sort you want to write. Read some more. After that, keep reading.<br>3. Compare what you read to your own writing. Notice the differences. Figure out what you can do with your writing to make it more like quality literature.<br>4. Rinse and repeat.<br><br>... Okay, I&#39;m not actually saying this just to be nice.

            <p>Summary: Agent Darkotas uses his dark powers to eliminate the threat posed by Mary Sues. Fantasy/Action. PG13. <br><br>Darkotas crouched in the bushes, tracking his prey. Using his superior Fel-enhanced senses, he soon found them - a horde of Sues. Grinning wickedly, he turned to his minions, who suddenly appeared behind him with a wave of his hands. &quot;Are all of you ready?&quot; He said with a smirk. They all nodded. Rushing out of the hole he was in, he set upon the Sues. He grabbed the first one with both of his hands, cursing the unfortunate target with a withering curse. As he did so, he drew his spell blade to stab another nearby Sue, consuming the soul as it exited the body. After the curse was complete, he removed his hands from the first Sue, turning to face another. Behind him, his minions pounced on a third Sue, tearing it apart. As he faced a large group of heavily armed Sues, he saw a lone figure attempting to sneak up behind him. Still facing the armed group, he turned to cast a horrifying illusion towards the attacker. The threat averted, he resumed charging his spell. They rushed towards him, and he released his power, immediately incinerating the Sues into a pile of steaming glitter. He turned once more to glance at the final Sue, screaming in fear as the visage showed him his greatest fears. The Sue stabbed wildly, catching Darkotas with a direct hit. The blade bounced off of his armor harmlessly, and slew the Sue. He decided to take a trophy, and shrunk the head of his foe after burning the rest. As he walked towards the barren land where he was hiding earlier, he cracked a smile.</p>

            <p>I can tell that my creative genius is unappreciated here. The lack of dialogue represents the void that exists in the heart of the character, while the sparkles of the Sues represent the futility of endeavor that the flames attempt to quench. The minions are the inner demons of the protagonist in an outward form. Not that I would expect any of YOU to understand, though. I shall simply take my works of art to another fanfiction site.</p>

            <p>Summary: The beauteousness of the Fictional Worlds is invisible to those blinded by hatreds of beauteousness. <br><br>Rating: PG13<br><br>Genre: Drama/Character Study<br><br>________<strong><em><br><br>Author&#39;s note: I am greatly disappointed by the quality of fiction offered upon this cite, but there is no better place upon which to place my stories because the PPC is not as broadly appreciated by intelligent people as it should be and the categories available upon other cites are effluvia. Here is a tale more appropriate for the needs off the world of the PPC.<br><br></em></strong>__________<br><br>Gleaming, glittering morning sunlight suffused the penumbra of mists lying upon the deep green leafy woods of Mirkwood, terpsichorean photons swaying between droplets of suspended moisture in the mist in an intricate dance of magnificence. Far off in the distant view of the agents stepping foot into the woods, the stolid mountains loomed in porphyrous shadowing against the light of the misty morning glow.<br><br>Agent Cicily Orion inhaled a deep, cleansing breath and breathed out again, watching the smoky fog she exhaled become part of the mist and the swirl of colors upon the morning light. Her partner, Agent Joe, ignored the glories of the gleaming, suffusing mist and sharpened his ugly, notched knife. &quot;Let&#39;s go get this bitch,&quot; he said roughly, his voice raspy but somehow slick as oil spilled on trembling waters innocent of wrongdoing. <br><br>&quot;Wait a little moment or two, Joe,&quot; admonished Cicily with gentleness and faith in her partner&#39;s ultimate humanity and openeyedness to beauty in the world around them. &quot;Observe and behold the colors and intricate dance of the world around us. Truly a world woven of words would be nothing so beautiful if it were not for the eye beholding it, for beauty is in the eye of the beholder and we are privileged to behold its beauty. Do you not see what magnificence is here in the smallest of raindrops or the intricate, effervescent swirl of a galaxy&#39;s primal dance? We are privileged.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t care about beauty, no matter how terpsicohorean the glory of the universe is,&quot; Joe snarled. &quot;I don&#39;t have time for beauty or glories. I am here to end a life, not prattle about foolish things that mean nothing to the business of blood. The only beauty I care about is the beauty of the Sue, and beauty is a crime for a Sue to have!&quot;<br><br>Cicily&#39;s breath caught as if her breath had been stolen from her chest by the breath of Boreas, God of the North Wind. &quot;Beauty is never a crime!&quot; she cried out passionately, her words ringing in the mist-wreathed woods. &quot;You are blinded by your hatred of things that are good in the world! If words are truly foundations of everything, as the ancient people of ancient Egypt knew to be true in their wise hearts, why do you hate a world made of words? Words and beauty are like the ancient twins of Greek mythology, Castor and Pollux, bound together for eternity in harmony and effervescent joy of beholden union!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shut up,&quot; sneered Joe.<br><br>Cicily bowed her head as if pleading forgiveness. She did not beg forgiveness from the universe for herself, but for Joe, who did not understand what was to be understood. Then she drew her long, gleaming, silver spear with the authentically shaped Roman head and thrust it into her sneering partner&#39;s chest. <br><br>He gasped as he fell, and his misty breath mingled with the mist and his red blood fed the soil upon which he fell. Even Joe could be beautiful.<br><br>&quot;When shadows fall across the face of time,&quot; Cicily murmured, &quot;those with clocks will regret their foolishness.&quot; <br><br>The world sighed around her as her words of purest truth blended and suffused the misty morning, twining in harmony about the wise young queenly woman who fought to help them against the forces of sneering smug impetuousness and vicious cynicism. She felt their humble, loving thanks and laughed joyously, stretching out her arms to engulf them.<br></p>

            <p>One is that IE is stupid, or possibly smart; either way, it couldn&#39;t read slightly-misformatted XML (I believe it was a single-character ellipsis in one of the summaries that broke it). The other is that IE - unlike Chrome - won&#39;t allow javascript to insert portions of tables.

            <p>That&#39;s just CSS tweaking, I was doing that anyway.

            <p>Summary: Another amazing adventure in the Department of Inaccuracies.<br>Genre: humor/parody<br>Rating: E for Everybody who can read can read this.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: I still don’t own the PPC, nor do I own World of Warcraft or anything else that you may recognize. But Androiaavata is mine, and I will never give up on her!<br><br>Author’s Notes:<br>All the reviews I got <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story40-1.htm">last time</a> were so enthusiastically encouraging that I just have to do this again. Thank you, Dazz, I love you.<br><br>Somebody (not a reviewer) told me that putting author notes into the story is annoying. I will not do this again. It’s all up here now.<br><br>I was reminded that it’s good practice to link to the story that was &quot;visited&quot;, or at least give its title and acknowledge the author. Since I forgot this: The &quot;Minor Correction&quot; was applied to <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission08.html">&quot;Why am I Here&quot;</a>, which belongs to Jay Thorntree and Acacia Byrd.<br><br>Somebody complained that I announced a badass team, but then my second agent was not more than a bit character who didn’t really do anything and wouldn’t even have a name if it had not been mentioned in author’s notes. I promise to give her more to do this time, and you may even note some character development.<br><br>My cat got kittens, they are adorable. If you want one, e-mail me. The address should be in my profile. (Please don’t misuse this to send me flames.)<br><br>Oh, I nearly forgot again. The story to which the mission goes this year can be found here [broken link]. <br><br>BTW, the Universal Translator has been repaired. On to the mission now:<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The agent whose name will not be revealed sat in his RC writing fan-fiction when the console BEEEPed and a half-dressed night-elf ran out of the bath-room. The male eyes watched with pleasure as she crossed the room and bent over the console to read the Intel report.<br><br>&quot;Oh, it is for our secret second department again&quot;, said Androiaavata. &quot;And I’m afraid this time we will need the wiki printout.&quot; Her partner looked puzzled and slightly disappointed as she hefted the flash patch displaying the quill dropping red ink onto her long blue gown, heaved a huge tome from the book-shelf and, holding the book high above her very pointy ears, strolled over to his desk.   <br><br>&quot;What story is it?&quot; asked the man.<br><br>&quot;This one&quot;, answered the night-elf, bringing the book down on his head. WHACK! &quot;Watch your rating!&quot; WHACK! &quot;You know quite well –&quot; Whack! &quot;– that I would not –&quot; Whack! &quot;– appear half nude  –&quot; WHACK &quot;– in a place –&quot; Whack &quot;– where you can see me.&quot;<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>A/N: Ouch, this was unexpected. Anyway, read and review, please. (Yes, I learned what Plz R+R! means.) And maybe you can tell me in your comments what you think the rating should have been. I don’t get why Androia was so angry. Is this adult content or what? <br><br>I expect to get at least twice as many reviews as I got for the previous story, otherwise I will never write again. <br><br>((OOC Note to fanficWorld Admin: The [broken link] is broken because I cannot edit the Board. Inserting a link back to itself there might add to the fun. HG))</p>

It&#39;s pretty big.~<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s the Tomb of the PPC Agent,&quot; said Supernumberary. &quot;It&#39;s where we write down all the names of all the PPC agents who have been all the killed.&quot; (A/N: C what I ddi their???)<br><br>~Oh wow,~ said Illian, ~so who are all the people who are named here?~<br><br>&quot;Well, there are lots,&quot; said Supernumberary, still kneeling. &quot;There are Elizabeth and Anya and Osbert, who were the first PPC Agents. There is the Mysterious Somebody, who was in charge before he got killed. There is Jaycacia Thornbyrd, who has since come back to life.&quot;<br><br>~Of course,~ said Illian, ~I know that. Everyone knows the great Jaycacia.~<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; said Supernumberary seriously. &quot;There is also the Untangler and the Agent, who are Time Lords, so they got better as well.&quot;<br><br>~That must be really useful,@ said Illian. ~I wish I was a Time Lord.~<br><br>&quot;Maybe someday you will be,&quot; said Supernumberary encouragingly. &quot;And there are lots of other names, like (A/N: culdnt&#39; think of tehse so fil it inn yousef!)&quot;<br><br>~But what about Acacia?~ asked Illian. ~Surely she is also dead.@<br><br>&quot;We can never be sure of that,&quot; said Supernumberary seriously. &quot;Acacia had powers beyond our understanding and also she is evil.&quot;<br><br>~Oh ok,~ said Illian. ~So why are we here?~<br><br>&quot;I needed to pray,&quot; said Supernumberary, &quot;but I have done it now. So we can go.&quot;<br><br>~I don&#39;t like this place,~ said Illian, as they walked out of the door. ~It&#39;s sad.~<br><br>~Yes,~ said Supernumberary seriously. &quot;It is the Tomb of the PPC Agent.&quot;<br><br>~Ah,~ said Illian, ~that would explain it.~</p>

(A/N: He has no muth so he tlaks finny to oky?!?)<br><br>~Thank you very much,~ said Illian seriously, taking the place. On it were seven crystals of different colours arranged into a rainbow.<br><br>&quot;How will you eat them?&quot; asked Supernumberary, who was still on Illian&#39;s back.<br><br>~Watch,~ said Supernumberary. He bent his head and stared at the crystals, and from them leapt beams of coloured light like tiny lasers which shone up into his eyes and filled them with glowing light, and when the beams faded the crystals were gone and Illian&#39;s eyes were glowing like the Northern and Southern and Eastern and Western Lights all in one.<br><br>~That is how I eat them,~ he told Supernumberary.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; said Supernumberary seriously. &quot;I suppose it saves on brushing your teeth. So are we going now?&quot;<br><br>~No,&quot; said Illian. ~That is not why I brought you here.

Many of you are my friends, and some of you,~ he looked significantly at Agents Lux, Suicide, and Falchion, ~are more than that. But there is something none of you know about me.~<br><br>&quot;What is that?&quot; asked the agents simultaneously.<br><br>~This is not the first time I have been in the PPC,~ said Illian seriously. ~Before I was Illian I was... <i>Dafydd</i> Illian!~</p>

N/Eway I knowticed Supernumberary&#39;s pratner had teh saym naym (LOL see wha i did tehre?) as Dafid Ilien so tahts&#39; wher tihs sotry came form. Aslo at teh edn of tihs caphter ehre is aNOTHR surpise so se if yo can gess who or waht it is!!!<br><br>The agents in the cafeteria gasped as one, and Supernumberary gazes at his partner in awe. &quot;But how is that possible?&quot; he asked seriously. &quot;Agent Dafydd was an elf, and you are an ansalight (A/N: Tahnks ~&amp;Izimax*# fo teh name!). They are very different.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are very observant,~ said Illian. ~But here is something you have forgotten about ansalights: we can change our shape!~ And he held up his arms, and from out of his eyes poured light in all the colours of the rainbow which bathed the agents in a tumescent glow like if all the stars in the sky were glowing together and when it faded Illian had turned back into an elf, though he was still blue.<br><br>&quot;Oh, now hang on!&quot; called an angry voice, and another blue elf came out of the crowd with his arms folded. &quot;You cann&#39;t be a blue elf,&quot; he said, &quot;for I am <i>the</i> Blue Elf, who is called Al&#39;s Waiter.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why are you called that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because I work in the Cafeteria as a waiter, and my boss is the Al-Flower,&quot; said Al&#39;s Waiter.<br><br>&quot;Oh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Anyway you cannot be blue, because you have not eaten too many Smurfs,&quot; said Al&#39;s Waiter. (A/N: Iz taht righ?!?!?)<br><br>&quot;But there is something you do not know,&quot; said Illian, who was Dafydd Illian. &quot;I am actually <i>you</i>... from the future! (A/N: when he waz Dafid hi war makup ok?!) I came back in time to join the PPC again, and that is how I know your real name.&quot; And he bent down and whispered in Al&#39;s Waiter&#39;s Ear&#39;s.<br><br>&quot;Oh ok then,&quot; said Al&#39;s Waiter.<br><br>&quot;But I don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Supernumberary. &quot;Why have you joined the PPC three times? Why are you revealing it now? How did you time travel? And why aren&#39;t you wearing any clothes?&quot;<br><br>Illian laughed and through his arms back. &quot;So many questions!&quot; he said. &quot;But they all have the same answer. As Al&#39;s Waiter, I saw what is about to happen, and knew that I would have to cause it. As Dafydd Illian, I made my plans, but had to leave when the evil Assassin Acacia tried to kill me. So I came back as Illian, hiding from her followers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think that answered <i>any</i> of my questions,&quot; said Supernumberary seriously.<br><br>&quot;But this will,&quot; said Illian, holding up his arms. &quot;By all the powers of the Elves, Smurfs, and Ansalights - by all the magic of the Flowers That Be - by all the wonders of the Word Worlds - I summon the rift!&quot; And rainbow light shone out of his eyes and hit a point in the air in front of him, where they widened into a tumescent hole in space and time, glowing with all the colours of the world and even more which Supernumberary had never seen before.<br><br>And through that hole fell...</p>

Tahnk you for all teh revuews!!!<br><br>Through the swirling rainbow of the rift fell a tangled mass of vines and bones. Supernumberary jumped back. &quot;Ew!&quot; he stated. &quot;Why did you want to bring <i>that</i> to HQ?&quot;<br><br>Illian frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Every time I change, my memories get a bit scrambled (A/N: liek a THYME LORD!!!) so I&#39;ve forgotten. I&#39;m sue I had a good reason though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am not so sue,&quot; Supernumberary said seriously, only he didn&#39;t, because he was interrupted by Agent Aurora E. Lorra (A/N: HUJE BIG TAHNKS to brandy<em>baby for ledning me her charachter! Yu sohuld go reed her sotries when your&#39;e done with min!!!) who had gone over to the bundle.<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s someone in here!&quot; said Aurora, pulling away a handful of dead leaves. &quot;OMG! She&#39;s beautiful!&quot;<br><br>The girl in the leaves was indeed beautiful. Her hair shone with a pure silver-white light, her skin was smooth and soft and warm, and though she had a youthful figure she still had curves in all the right places. Her eyes were closed as if in a peaceful sleep, but there was nothing peaceful about the way her hands were clenched around the vines which entangled her.<br><br>She was also entirely nude, and Supernumberary gazed on her in awe. &quot;Is that why you had to be naked?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Apparently,&quot; said Illian seriously. &quot;Certainly I don&#39;t intend to complain. Do you think I need to do something to wake her up?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You could kiss me,&quot; said Aurora, and then blushed prettily when Illian looked at her. &quot;Her! I meant her. It&#39;s traditional, after all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I might take you up on that,&quot; Illian murmured, &quot;but only when we have figured out why she is here.&quot;<br><br>Suddenly the girl in the vines shifted slightly. &quot;Father,&quot; she groaned.<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s your <i>daughter</i>?&quot; Supernumberary demanded. &quot;That&#39;s just sick, and also I didn&#39;t know you had a daughter.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t!&quot; Al&#39;s Waiter protested.<br><br>&quot;Actually you have several, but not yet,&quot; Illian told him, and then told Supernumberary, &quot;and she isn&#39;t any of them. I would know.&quot;<br><br>The girl on the floar moaned again, digging her fingers into the floor. &quot;<i>Father,</i>&quot; she said insistantly.<br><br>&quot;Well, she isn&#39;t <i>my</i> daughter,&quot; Supernumberary said seriously. &quot;Does anyone recognise her?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; said the agents gathered around them - all except Aurora. She had been kneeling next to the girl, and watched as she slowly opened her eyes. They were the blue of sapphires, of lapis lazuli, of the sky and of the sea.<br><br>Aurora gasped aloud. &quot;But that&#39;s impossible,&quot; she gasped. &quot;You were supposed to be dead - or at least trapped, for eternity!&quot;<br><br>The girl smiled weakly. &quot;Eternity is a very long time,&quot; she said, and with Aurora&#39;s help got to her feet. &quot;Hello, my friends,&quot; she said, looking around at the agents, &quot;it&#39;s nice to meet you. My name is Jaycacia Thornbyrd.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;Jaaaaaaaaaaa-!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shh.&quot; Jay&#39;s hand snaked between a couple of branches and slapped itself over Acacia&#39;s mouth. &quot;Look.&quot;<br><br>Acacia struggled free, gave her former partner a quick glare, then sighed and looked where Jay was pointing. &quot;It&#39;s a bird,&quot; she said. &quot;Some sort of songbird, I think. So? I didn&#39;t think birdwatching was your thing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shh.&quot; Jay pressed a finger to her lips. &quot;Any moment now...&quot;<br><br>The hawk struck like a lightning bolt. One moment the songbird was sitting cheerfully on its branch, minding its own business; the next it was simply </i>gone<i>, replaced by the stooping hawk, or more precisely by the pathetic bundle of feathers in its talons.<br><br>Acacia tore her gaze away as the hawk began to feed, and found herself face-to-face with Jay&#39;s best manic grin. &quot;Go on,&quot; Acacia said, &quot;say whatever it is you&#39;re beaming about.&quot;<br><br>Jay&#39;s smile got even wider. &quot;</i>Dinosaurs<i>,&quot; she announced. &quot;And much cooler than the lumbering great things of the past. These ones </i>fly<i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... right.&quot; Acacia took a deep breath. &quot;Jay: she&#39;s back.&quot;<br><br>Jay&#39;s eyes hardened in an instant, the smile simply vanishing. &quot;She&#39;s dead.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And when has that ever stopped her before?&quot;</i><br><br>((Oh yes. Yes I did. And you would not believe the size of the grin on my face when I got to write that name again.<br><br>Nesh - I&#39;d apologise for dragging Aurora into this, but quite frankly she deserves it. ;) And her first story&#39;s first chapter established that she shared a universe with Jaycacia - which means that, in light of &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://fanfic">http://fanfic</a></em>land.webs.com/Story29.htm&quot;&gt;2007&#39;s <i>Love and Secrets</i></a>, there are now three Jaycaciaverse (oh dear Iluvatar) stories featuring Dafydd...

And Illian sed he would kiss her?!?! I LOVE IUT!!! <br>But who is her father?

In fact, she is now explicitly out to wreck Dafydd&#39;s timeline. See, it occurred to me that I couldn&#39;t remember seeing a PPC badfic in a classic &quot;Tenth Walker&quot; sort of vein, with an OC joining the canon characters, upstaging them, stealing their lines, and messing up important plot points, so I decided to do one. *g* I&#39;ve established that Brandy has a bit of a thing for him, and he has such a nice arc with the Ring of Sairalindл, not to mention his female partner and his love interest to bash out of recognition along the way. It&#39;s perfect. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Also,</sup></sup> after what you&#39;ve done to Nume and Ilraen I&#39;m pretty sure that (a) you deserve it, and (b) you&#39;ll probably laugh about as much as I have been. <sup>_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</sup> ))</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a fine way to start my morning! Sheesh. That is gloriously pointless. Also, I am fascinated by JayBird&#39;s apparent talent for picking up on fringe details while completely missing the important ones. I&#39;m curious: did she read on the wiki that &quot;Supernumberary&quot; was raised Catholic, or did she just happen to notice that he says &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; a lot without realizing that he&#39;s swearing? *g*<br><br>I&#39;ll have to come back and try to get in-character later.

            <p>Uhhh..... Where&#39;s Herr Wozzeck these days? I haven&#39;t seen him since late February.<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;m working on a fic based in the Persona universe. Herr Wozzeck appears to be the only one familiar with the series on the board, and I&#39;m not confident (or good) enough to check my own work.<br><br>So, anyone else want to help me with this? (to note, full familiarity with the series, including pre-3 games, would be greatly appreciated.)</p>
