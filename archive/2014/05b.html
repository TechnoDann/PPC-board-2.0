            <p>I&#39;m finally starting work on a bit in FicPsych that I&#39;ve been thinking of doing for ages, but I need several agents whose writers don&#39;t mind them being just a little bit, er, poisoned. After eating lunch in the Cafeteria. Don&#39;t worry, the effects aren&#39;t permanent; you&#39;ll get them back in one piece and possibly a touch saner than they were to begin with. They&#39;ll need a friend or partner to escort them in the meantime, though. Infrastructure agents (e.g. DoSAT, Finance, anyone who might conceivably get a regular lunch break) are preferred here, but Action is great, too.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to reveal too much, but e-mail me (neshomeh [dot] soul [at] gmail [dot] com) if you&#39;ve got a non-human agent and want to discuss the effects of the substance in question on an alien physiology.<br><br>Permission is preferred, but not required. No guarantees that I&#39;ll use everyone if I get a lot of volunteers.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Give me RTD&#39;s weird and occasionally silly but usually overall entertaining material over Moffat messing up his own time travel rules any day.<br><br>Also, I am so absolutely tired of people using Love and Monsters as the big sticking point of &quot;see, this is why _____ is so bad! Because Love and Monsters is part of the _____ group!&quot; Yes, it was a bad episode, but it was a bad episode in major part because it tried to do too many things that the new series wasn&#39;t ready for at the same time.(Another reason is because every one of the new characters is a moron, but I digress.) Even though it failed miserably at doing so, I actually see the attempt as commendable. It gave the show&#39;s creators the opportunity to look at what they did, see what went right and what went wrong, and improve the format for the future. If it wasn&#39;t for Love and Monsters testing out a non-traditional Doctor Who format, we wouldn&#39;t have gotten episodes like the well-regarded Midnight and Blink, the latter of which was created by pre-takeover Moffat. Of course, Blink&#39;s concept is a little ruined in retrospect now that the Weeping Angels have been put into several stories where they don&#39;t belong and warped to fit their new confines, but the original is still a standout.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a connoisseur of both Doctor Who and woefully bad SF; <i>Love and Monsters</i> is both, and not in the fun way. The things you bring up as mitigating circumstances for one of the worst episodes ever made (and <i>definitely</i> the worst Nu Who episode) would be fine... if they were actually the case. Are you seriously trying to suggest that Doctor Who just &quot;wasn&#39;t ready&quot; for a chase scene at the start of an episode ripped straight from an episode of Scooby bloody Doo? D&#39;you think that we needed time for the series to settle so that fans would willingly accept a monster <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/William_Grantham">designed by a nine-year-old</a>? I get that the whole Doctor-lite structure was used to great effect elsewhere, but the episode was an absolute abortion and no amount of misguided &quot;oh, but it had <i>ideas</i>&quot; hand-wringing is going to change that. I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just not.<br><br>Russell T. Davies made the worst episode of Doctor Who that has ever aired. Worse than Delta &amp; The Bannermen. Worse than The Horns Of Nimon. Worse even than Fear Her. The concepts are uninteresting, the episode looks atrocious, none of the comedy works, and I don&#39;t watch Doctor Who to see Danny from Hustle playing ELO covers with his <i>sodding garage band</i>. But the worst part?<br><br>Uncle Rusty didn&#39;t learn from his mistakes. He continued to make episodes that featured boring slapstick, stupid bit-part characters that somehow got an episode to themselves, and atrocious ideas for both monster design and episode themes (cf. the aforementioned Fear Her, another RTD-era episode which features <i>all of these things</i>). He still considered it acceptable to write abject turds like <i>Gridlock</i> and, well, the worst excesses of <i>Torchwood</i>. As a writer, he operates on a vastly lower level than Moffat. If you disagree, fine, but for goodness&#39; sake don&#39;t hold up <i>Love And bloody Monsters</i> as an example of RTD&#39;s incredible writing talent.</p>

            <p>mistaking your personal preferences for facts.<br><br>Personally, I don&#39;t think <i>Love and Monsters </i>is &quot;<i>definitely </i>the worst&quot; anything.  It&#39;s about average terms of technical storytelling quality, even if it&#39;s <i>definitely </i>not average in terms of subject matter.<br><br>You see, I have a soft spot for stories that try to do something weird and different and unusual, even if they don&#39;t quite succeed in getting all the bits to fit together.

            <p>Despite the fact that I prefer Russell T. Davies&#39;s run to Moffat&#39;s, I am not at all claiming that everything in it was anything near the pinnacle of quality. I&#39;ve mentioned how much I dislike The Idiot&#39;s Lantern and The Next Doctor before, for example. Love and Monsters was an abject failure, and I&#39;m not contesting that, but it wasn&#39;t a failure because of random sequences that didn&#39;t work. You can pick out random unlikable parts from anything, because every show and almost every episode of those shows has random sequences that don&#39;t work. The episode failed when it tried to take a risk bridging multiple unrelated ideas and plotlines and couldn&#39;t make anything good out of the attempt. I just like the attitude that tried to go in new directions with the show more than the general mentality behind what the Eleventh Doctor&#39;s tenure did, which admittedly might have colored my views on the episode itself some, even after taking into account my views that claiming it as the worst episode ever would be greatly overreacting.<br>Moffat&#39;s run doesn&#39;t take risks, doesn&#39;t accept that the Doctor would have long-term effects on anything, and whenever it looks like the Doctor might have to face up to a difficult decision or deal with some drastic change to the universe or the people around him, someone just hits the reset button so that everything can stay exactly the way it is as though nothing ever happened. Love and Monster&#39;s wasn&#39;t a display of any sort of talent, but I&#39;d prefer the sort of writers who want to go in new directions with their material even though it might occasionally collapse around them to the sort of writers who want to create the appearance of good storytelling while not actually advancing their characters in any way.<br><br>I think the showrunners did learn from at least of few of their mistakes in Love and Monsters. The contest-winning monster design was stupid, so they decided &quot;hey, let&#39;s make future contests about smaller and less potentially ruinous things&quot;. And the padding... well, there was still plenty of padding in future episodes, let&#39;s not kid ourselves here, but at least most of the time it was less obvious than the pointless band sequence.<br><br>Some of the problems you mentioned with the episode I don&#39;t mind, in part because I suppose everyone goes into a show looking for different things. I don&#39;t mind the Scooby-Doo chase scene, because it is obviously a joke. True, it&#39;s not a funny joke, because the episode isn&#39;t funny, and on that I greatly agree with you, but it&#39;s nothing to be upset over. The occasional giving of episodes to people other than the Doctor I see as more of a change of pace than being a stupid choice in and of itself. I actually really like the concept behind Love and Monsters, about people who had met with the Doctor but hadn&#39;t quite grasped how dangerous his world was gathering together and sharing their fandom with one another only for the entire affair to be interrupted once part of the Doctor&#39;s world forces itself into theirs, and I think it could have been, while not great, quite good, if it hadn&#39;t needed to couple itself to the outrageously awful Abzorbaloff and hadn&#39;t been shackled with a clutch of bit-character morons who don&#39;t even turn around when they hear an ear-splitting scream every time they leave their meeting place. And since I see Gridlock as more unmemorable than bad, but something in the episode appears to have harshly angered you, that suggests an even wider rift in what we might consider good or bad in television. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.</p>

            <p>My initial point, and the main reason that I agreed with Pippa&#39;s Ghost that the capacity to make something like Love and Monsters makes RTD superior to Moffat, is that I would much rather have a producer who tries new story paths and takes risks in the name of being entertaining, even if said producer occasionally fails at it and even if those failures are immense, than a producer who forces the story into certain pre-ordained directions, is unwilling or afraid to do anything new or weird with the material, and hasn&#39;t got any real connection to how a universe that could produce characters like the Doctor would operate. I wasn&#39;t saying that Love and Monsters was a testament of writing skill, but that the fact that it and other, more successful episodes like it were made shows a certain tone for the run.<br><br>Any place that creates people like the Time Lords and the Sontarans and the Cybermen and the Daleks is going to be a very strange and occasionally very silly place, but while Russell T. Davies embraced that weirdness, and occasionally embraced it with a little too much force, Moffat tries to drown it out with plot contrivance, pointless drama, and an inability to mesh his stories with one another, much less make them fit the universe as a whole.</p>

            <p>Merely the more camp ones. It&#39;s what he felt more at home writing - hence the barrage of crap comedy during his tenure. I do amateur stand-up, so maybe I feel it a bit more keenly than you do, but RTD&#39;s near-total inability to tell a decent joke just makes me want to tear my own face off, closely followed by his fingers.<br><br>Look, if you want to claim he embraced the weird side... why get rid of the Time Lords and Gallifrey? There&#39;s nothing stranger than Time Lord society, and believe me, there&#39;s a hell of a lot more potential for stories set there than there is in <i>Love And Monsters</i>. Oh, wait, we know why. It&#39;s because RTD didn&#39;t want the Time Lords hanging over him so he had the Doctor wipe them all out. And the Daleks, except not really because they&#39;re iconic and nobody&#39;d let him get away with it.<br><br>And frankly, that&#39;s another thing I disagree with you on. Maybe Moffat doesn&#39;t take as many risks as RTD, but the risks he takes? They tend to have a much higher success rate. Yes, he screws up, lots of people do, but when he&#39;s on, he&#39;s really on. Uncle Rusty&#39;s approach to risk-taking was to dive head first into a burst sewer main in the hopes of finding a lucky penny; a whole lot of shite for precious little reward. None of the &quot;more successful&quot; episodes were written by RTD, with the exception of Midnight - and that episode&#39;s one that I can take or leave, personally. And don&#39;t even get me <i>started</i> on his arc writing compared to Moffat&#39;s - well, actually, you can&#39;t, because he never really did any. He started to, but then he just got bored and wandered off to look at some trees so some poor sod had to turn up and hang it all together with chicken wire and hope.<br><br>Uncle Rusty&#39;s great mission in his time as showrunner was to make Doctor Who more child-friendly, but you can do that without making something childish. Rather than tell accessible stories well with good, memorable characters, we wound up with <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Aliens_of_London_(TV_story)">flatulent mutant Teletubbies</a> and <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Tooth_and_Claw_(TV_story)">Victorian kung-fu monks</a><a>. Every single time he brought up Classic Who references, he screwed it up. For Christ&#39;s sake, he made the Macra into the interstellar equivalent of guests on the Jeremy Kyle show! One of the vanishingly few aliens that&#39;s actually, y&#39;know, non-humanoid, and he gets it just so totally arse-backwards, we can only be grateful he never got his mitts on the bloody Rutans... guh.<br><br>This is just rambling now, so I&#39;ll get to the point. Moffat makes television of a higher standard of quality than RTD does. The worst of RTD&#39;s asinine campness got thrown out the window as soon as he lost power, and I consider that a good thing. You are well within your rights to disagree, but I still don&#39;t think that anyone who makes something as pathetic as <i>Love And Monsters</i> - the episode for which the denouement is &quot;man vigorously and repeatedly rogers a paving slab with Moaning Myrtle stuck inside it&quot; - ought to be defended, particularly since <i>he stands by the episode</i>. I just - no. No, no, no.<br><br>I&#39;mma watch The War Games again. And then the Five(ish) Doctors Reboot, because <i>that</i> is how you do comedy.</a></p>

            <p>You&#39;ve all (I think) said things equivalent to &#39;RTD prefers to write about bizarre, non-mainstream subject matters, while Moffat doesn&#39;t&#39;. I&#39;m... honestly not sure what you mean by that. There&#39;s clearly a fandom consensus on this that I&#39;m not aware of - thank goodness - but can one-or-more of you explain it to me? Because, to literally roll a random dice a couple of times, <i>The Shakespeare Code</i> and <i>Blink</i> don&#39;t seem a whole lot less weird than <i>The Lodger</i> and <i>The Name of the Doctor</i> (I rolled 36 &amp; 28 for RTD, 11 &amp; 39 for Moffat, using only the main series&#39; and ignoring all specials - so out of 52 for RTD, 39 for Moffat).<br><br>Of course random chance would throw up an actual Moffat episode for RTD... but my point rather stands. <i>Shakespeare Code</i> was &#39;aliens try to use Shakespeare to take over the universe&#39;; <i>Blink</i> was &#39;the Doctor makes videos while really awesome aliens try to... er... do not a lot&#39;; <i>The Lodger</i> was &#39;the Doctor rents a room and a lonely spaceship kills people&#39;; <i>The Name of the Doctor</i> was &#39;something something timeline something and also River&#39;.<br><br>To rephrase my question, and skip the rambling above: what <i>are</i> these &#39;bizarre, non-mainstream subject matters&#39; which RTD was so good at writing, while Moffat ignores?

            <p>I&#39;m not sure your examples help very much because none of them were actually written by RTD.<br><br>If you look at the stories that RTD actually wrote, he seems to love throwing in material from different genres that you wouldn&#39;t normally associate with each other, let alone with <i>Doctor Who.  </i>(e.g. Farting Teletubbies doing topical political satire; gameshow parodies; <i>Scooby Doo</i>-style chases in a story that&#39;s structured like Radio 4&#39;s <i>Play for Today</i>; etc.)<br><br>Moffat&#39;s own scripts don&#39;t seem to mix and match genres quite as often or as thoroughly as RTD&#39;s did.  (e.g. <i>Blink </i>features a gothic-style concept in a gothic-style story.  It&#39;s very well written and enjoyable.  But it doesn&#39;t have any genre-smashing weirdness.)<br></p>

            <p>After all, if I&#39;d picked and chosen my examples, you could have accused me of... well, picking and choosing my examples!<br><br>I can... sort of see your point, though I&#39;m not positive I agree. It feels like you&#39;re defining &#39;material from different genres that you wouldn&#39;t normally associate with each other, let alone with Doctor Who&#39; on the fly. How - and now I <i>will</i> pick and choose an example - does &#39;suit-clad <i>X-Files</i> aliens under the Nixon government&#39; come out as less mix-and-match than the RTD stories? For that matter, why does &#39;rhino in a hotel&#39; (<i>The God Complex</i>) lose out to &#39;rhinos in a hospital&#39; (<i>Smith and Jones</i>) - when the former had far more engaging characters (including one who my wife wanted to be a new companion), and a far more complex plot than &#39;alien hides &gt; police think Doctor is alien &gt; Doctor proves them wrong &gt; Doctor saves day&#39;?<br><br>(But, yes, &#39;God Complex&#39; wasn&#39;t written by Moffat, I know. It was still under his tenure, though, and finding direct analogies between stories is <i>hard</i>)<br><br>I&#39;m still dubious. I&#39;m also not sure - even if you&#39;re right - that it makes up for the fact that I (personally) find Moffat&#39;s stories almost across-the-board more enjoyable to watch. Since this <i>is</i> entertainment, that has to count for something. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m only comparing them as writers for stories they&#39;ve actually written, not their eras as a whole.  Sorry if I didn&#39;t make this clear.  As show runners, they&#39;ve both been very good at hiring writers who write the sort of stories that they don&#39;t.  RTD hired Moffat, for example, and Moffat has hired writers who are good at the unusual stuff.<br><br>Anyway, the reason &#39;suit-clad <i>X-Files </i>aliens under the Nixon government&#39; aren&#39;t that weird is because, <i>X-Files </i>aliens and the Nixon administration are both already associated with corruption in the US government.  The only weird thing is the suit.<br><br>I won&#39;t deny that <i>The God Complex </i>is weirder than <i>Smith and Jones</i>.  Toby Whitehouse is one of those writers who seems to enjoy genre mixing as much as RTD did.  (And he wasn&#39;t writing it with the disadvantage of having to introduce the first post-Rose companion in the episode.)<br><br>As for why you prefer Moffat&#39;s era, it&#39;s not surprising.  I think your tastes are naturally more mainstream, less weird in general.  And not just in <i>Doctor Who.  </i>For example, Jay &amp; Acacia created a random bit of weirdness with a telepathic sunflower; you went out of your way to make that sunflower seem less weird, less incongruous (more congruous?) by explaining it with an origin story.<br></p>

            <p>Yes, I explained the Sunflower - by claiming that a sailing ship fell through a natural plothole to a planet where mysterious radiation made the Flowers sentient so they could build a city populated by vegetables and stabilise plotholes and encounter Mary-Sues in the wild.

            <p>The main reason I generally prefer RTD&#39;s episodes to Moffat&#39;s is that, while I feel they are both exceptional writers, Moffat has a tendency to write himself into a corner and use some ass-pull to get out of it, instead of developing a plausible reason for whatever Timey-Wimey stuff the Doctor&#39;s been messing with.<br><br>I&#39;d have to go back and find specific instances if you want examples, but for the majority of the time- <i>majority</i>, mind you- Moffat&#39;s episodes are the ones that feel not very well concluded. I say majority because there was one episode (can&#39;t remember the name, unfortunately- by the way, SPOILERS) where the Master captured the Doctor and forcibly aged him into a tiny, wrinkly baby-creature... thing. The Doctor was completely fine when Martha managed to coordinate the entire planet to think about the Doctor <i>at the exact same time</i> and caused the Doctor to change back to normal- and the explanation was that he&#39;d integrated himself with the Master&#39;s satellite network and recieve the mental signals, or something nonsensical like that.<br><br>Tl;dr, I like both writers, but I mostly prefer RTD to Moffat due to his better explanations for the episode&#39;s shenanigans.</p>

            <p>For the sake of fairness, I won&#39;t compare the first episodes each writer did - RTD might not have gotten into the swing of things - nor the last - epic finales, etc. Instead, I will look at the  stories they wrote in each of their second series&#39;. (That puts Moffat at a disadvantage, because I really like <i>Doomsday</i>, but we&#39;ll see) Conveniently, that&#39;s four each. Let&#39;s take a look at those endings:<br><br><u>RTD</u><br><br>-New Earth: They cure the zombies by pouring IV medicines over them and telling them to cuddle. They fix the Cassandra problem by... letting her get out of dying, and then she chooses to anyway. I&#39;m not sure either of those follow from the episode, and I&#39;m positive the second doesn&#39;t.<br><br>-Tooth &amp; Claw: The house is a werewolf trap (despite not being in any way werewolf-proof) and the Koh-i-Noor diamond is used to focus moonlight on it and kill it. Did we see the diamond or the telescope - or any hint that the house was a trap - before the finale? I can&#39;t remember.<br><br>-<s>Love &amp; Monsters</s> In the interests of fairness (since we&#39;ve acknowledged no-one liked it) I&#39;ll swap this out for <i>Gridlock</i> from Series 3: A nurse teleports the Doctor out, reveals that the Motorway was sealed because of disease, and then the Face of Boe demonstrates that &#39;life energy&#39; == electricity enough to open the giant doors. Was <i>any</i> of that foreshadowed? Were Novice Hame and the Face even in the rest of the episode?<br><br>-Army of Ghosts/Doomsday: Part One - the ghosts are Cybermen walking between dimensions. That&#39;s foreshadowed by the rest of the series. The Sphere is Dalek, which isn&#39;t foreshadowed but is awesome. Part Two - the Genesis Ark is a prison with a massive army of Daleks in, and then one Cyberman resists the irresistable programming and cries oil, then the Doctor opens the breach which now has a vacuum on the far side (despite the Cybermen walking out of it earlier), and it pulls both armies in from all over the world despite being preeeeetty small. I&#39;m... not convinced that comes out of the episode, either.<br><br><u>Moffat</u><br><br>-The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon: Part One - There are Silent, like, everywhere, and the little girl is <i>inside</i> the spacesuit that was coming for her. Part Two - &#39;You should kill us all on sight&#39;. I can&#39;t remember to what extent the idea of the Silent planting instructions is in these episodes, though the other factors - not remembering them, that they&#39;re everywhere - certainly are.<br><br>-A Good Man Goes To War: The baby is Flesh, just like Amy previously was. The baby is River, which comes out of the Gamma Forest girl writing her name; that&#39;s foreshadowed by &#39;the only water in the forest is the river&#39;.<br><br>-Let&#39;s Kill Hitler: River saves the Doctor by giving up her remaining regenerations. The healing power of regeneration energy is established - in this very story, even - but the actual &#39;get out of death free card&#39; has no buildup.<br><br>-The Wedding of River Song: Letting River kill the Doctor fixes the timeline, which was brought up as soon as they came close together. The Doctor doesn&#39;t die because he was inside the Teselecta; we&#39;d seen him talk to it at the beginning of the episode, but we&#39;d also seen his body burnt on a pyre, so that&#39;s a bit iffy.<br><br><u>Conclusions</u><br><br>I&#39;m not going to do a &#39;score&#39; - it&#39;s way too subjective for that - but it seems from this sample that a lot <i>more</i> of Moffat&#39;s endings come out of the episode than RTD&#39;s. Thinking about it, though, what you might be noticing is the tendency for Moffat to give the Doctor a situation he can only fix by dying - &#39;The Big Bang&#39;, &#39;Let&#39;s Kill Hitler&#39;, and &#39;The Wedding of River Song&#39; all jump to mind - and then having him come up with a clever way out. RTD was more inclined to give him a situation he couldn&#39;t fix at <i>all</i> - Dalek invasion in &#39;Parting of the Ways&#39;, the cage you mentioned in &#39;Last of the Time Lords&#39; - and then having him come up with a clever way out. Or, sometimes, having someone <i>else</i> come up with a clever way out - the two examples (the two <i>season finales</i>) I named both rely on the Doctor&#39;s companion to work, though the latter was at least the Doctor&#39;s plan. Apparently.<br><br>hS</p>

I&#39;m sorry for doing that. I guess I just wanted to try to explain myself a little better.<br><br>And ugh, did it really sound like I was defending Love and Monsters over Blink? I really wasn&#39;t trying to. It&#39;s just that Blink is so incredibly well-regarded that anything good that I might reinforce about it has already been praised dozens of times by others, and the episode hadn&#39;t been more than partially connected to anything I&#39;d been saying. Even though I didn&#39;t jump to instant adoration of Blink like many fans did, I would greatly prefer future nasties to be in the mold of the Weeping Angels than to be like the Abzorbaloff.<br><br>Still, though, I agree with you, Iximaz. Let&#39;s put this unwinnable conflict aside, pick up our favorite sonic plot device, and join forces in complaining about something more universal to the fandom, like how solidly disappointing the Classic Who selection on Netflix is.</p>

            <p>Kelok and Unger are in an Action Department, but regularly eat at the Cafeteria (their favorites are the meatloaf that crawls off your plate and the blue pudding-like substance). <br><br>Kelok as a Wraith normally wouldn&#39;t be able to be poisoned, because the Wraith healing factor is so incredibly high, but his badfic origins and the Nigel he takes to activate his digestive system both lower that factor a lot. <br><br>Still, the better bet for getting sick is Unger. He&#39;s a D&amp;D 3.5 half-elf, which means he&#39;s half-human, and the half-elfs seemed to have generally inherited all of the weaknesses and few of the benefits of each species as far game play went. Also, if physical assistance will be required Unger is half the size of Kelok (though stronger than he looks).<br><br>Anyway, they aren&#39;t currently doing much of anything, so whatever you want to use them for. They both should know a lot of people in FicPsych since they started out there before getting to work as agents. They were last at the Purim party throwing food (Unger) and getting drunk and singing Irish folk songs with minis(Kelok).</p>

            <p>Lee, Ian, Orion, Agents Mal, Grace, and Alex are all up for you to play with. On the note of alien physiology, Agents Mal (Maeryn/Kaliel) are Tok&#39;ra, so are more hardy than a normal human, but you can treat everyone else as a garden-variety human save for Alex, who tends to have... odd ...responses to things. Nothing that would cause severe anaphylactic reactions, but I&#39;d recommend dosing Grace rather than Alex, unless you&#39;re going for rule of funny here, which in that case, go with Alex.</p>

            <p>Yes, the symbiote provides an enhanced immune system and longer life. As for Alex, nothing too odd. He tends to get drunk faster than most, but that&#39;s about it.

            <p>...anything about Gaspard&#39;s father yet, but you are free to mention him! I can whip up a description for you real quick: <br><br>Physically speaking, he&#39;s an abnormally tall (180 cm) 54 year old Chinese man who can trace his roots all the way back to Canton province in the southern part of China. His face is fairly oval with a flat nose and almond-shaped eyes. He wears his slightly greying black hair in a regular haircut. As for his personality, he is very direct and sometimes curt with his patients. He is rather strict with Gaspard and expects his son to always give his 110%-- within reasonable bounds, of course. Burnouts tend to decrease productivity. He has a deadpan sense of humour.<br><br><br>Just a few things I want to add for my crew: if Penny gets sick, then Nasir will be there to support her. If Gaspard or Harris (or both) gets sick, expect Gaspard&#39;s grandmother*, Marianne, to drag the boy to someone that can help. Yakov is kinda stupid and will try to Apparate (and subsequently hurl everywhere) by himself to Medical/FicPsych/what-have-you. <br><br><br><br><br>- - - <br><br><font size="1">*Grandmother on the mother&#39;s side. </font></p>

            <p>I just tweaked FrÃ©dÃ©ric&#39;s origin a bit: he actually comes from Canada, not France. If you&#39;ll just permit the mini-infodump I&#39;ve been keeping in my head for the past few months:<br><br>FrÃ©dÃ©ric was born in QuÃ©bec city, Canada sometime in 1960. He was the eldest son of a family of immigrants who left Communist China for Hong Kong, then across the sea to Vancouver, then a long train ride eastward to the province of QuÃ©bec. He learnt French in school and later became a psychologist (much to the approval of his family) and set up shop in MontrÃ©al, where he met Nicole in 1990 and married her in 1993. Gaspard came in two years later, in 1995.<br><br>Marianne, however, <i>is</i> born in France: she was born in Paris in 1929. She grew up during the occupation and subsequent overthrow of the Vichy government and later became a journalist. She married a Canadian businessman, Albert Roy, in 1960 and moved to MontrÃ©al with him. Nicole Roy, Gaspard&#39;s mother, was born in 1965.</p>

            <p>I realize that this is a bit premature, but I&#39;m cooking my agents now and it will be at least a month before I complete all of the steps anyway.<br><br>Stats: Samantha, female, Nosgoth Cabal vampire, age 23 plus 450,&quot;real world&quot; and Nosgoth.<br><br>Appearance: Petite, about 5-foot 4-inches.  Black hair to mid-shoulderblades, pale skin tone, yellow eyes.<br><br><br>Samantha was a twenty-something inhabitant of the &quot;real world&quot; and a fangirl of the Legacy of Kain video game series.  She then was sucked into Nosgoth and was a Mary-Sue for the full five minutes it took to realize what was going on and save a main character from dying.  Then some flavor of reality kicked in and she had a horrible and miserable week of being a less-than average human in Nosgoth.  Then she became sick, had to beg the canon characters not to let her die, and the only way to save her was to turn her into a vampire.<br><br>Her memories and official PPC file show that she was confronted for breaking the universe.  She apologized that she didn&#39;t mean it and said that she wanted to be human again and taken home, but also showed concern for the reality she was in since she knew about the damage.  (The C-CAD popped before giving a good reading.)<br><br>Once settled into the PPC, she&#39;ll have some difficulty relating to younger agents.  She will have an internal thought process that artificially prompts her to treat everyone as a person even if she sees them as walking prey.  But she is used to being subordinate, so will follow instructions from someone she respects as more-knowledgeable.<br><br>Her counterpart will be a normal 30-something, to prompt condescension until he actually says something useful.  He will also be excited about going into fics, to prick her irritation about how much it can suck to get dragged into even your favorite world.  He will be a fan of many things, to justify bringing her as the partner who may not have even heard of the fiction.<br><br>I&#39;m still working on the details of the partner, except that he has an academic interest in weapons and fighting style.  He is also afraid of spiders for no good reason.<br><br>They will be in the Department of Floaters, though about half of the assignments are overflow from the Legacy of Kain Division.  (Official story is that the division has all of the permanent staff it can handle.)</p>

            <p>This is a third-person sample from Self-Insert-Authoress-Tripe.  Basically the Legacy of Kain cast know that they are in a bad copy of their world and that it&#39;s run by the Author avatar.<br><br>-HR-<br><br>The Chess Museum was a humble building that felt more like a public library than a gallery.  Rows of shelves held glass display boxes of chesspieces and boards instead of books, though there also was a small collection of books about chess near the entrance. <br><br>Some chess sets were normal except for the artistic quality of their pieces.  Others had oddlyÂ­ shaped boards or were designed for more than two players.  There were even chesslike game sets like Shogi and Chaturanga in the rear shelves. <br><br>Multiple tables were scattered in the main area.  Kain and Vorador often met at this place.  It was completely neutral and open to all, but quiet because few knew that it existed.   <br><br>Kain and Vorador had chosen the most generic example of a normal chess set to play with, and were playing with the standard rules.<br><br>âWhat possessed you to raise my sire&#39;s murderer as your child?â Vorador asked.<br><br>âThat detail had been lost to legend,â Kain admitted.  âI had merely found the tomb of their most revered warriors and defiled them.â<br><br>âI hope you are satisfied,â Vorador grumbled.<br><br>âIt was magnificent,â Kain grinned.  Then he sobered.  âI shall miss them.â<br><br>Vorador frowned, but did not press for details.  For most, it was impolite to inquire about dead fledglings.  In Kain&#39;s case, Vorador was afraid of the answers.  He hadn&#39;t minded when he learned the fates of the traitors he had mistakenly sired, but was still sore that Umah had been lumped in with them.<br><br>âAnd now we have to suffer Malek&#39;s presence,â Vorador scowled, changing the subject.<br><br>âI never understood the value of simply humiliating an enemy,â Kain admitted.<br><br>Vorador was about to make his move, but he let his talon fall to the arm of his chair instead.  âI wish that he had found me sooner so that I could have killed him outright.  Rage had blinded me, and I was afraid of the damage I had already done.â<br><br>âWhy did you help me, then?â Kain asked.<br><br>âI had a small shred of hope that you were our savior, but for the most part, I no longer cared.â Vorador finally reached across the board and placed his knight with a firm tap.<br><br>Kain stood.  âHow dare you keep me ignorant of my role?â<br><br>âThose prophesies destroyed far greater vampires than you, Kain,â Vorador answered, also standing.  âEither you would save us or you wouldn&#39;t, and I was not going to burden you with incomplete scraps that could be misinterpreted so easily.â<br><br>Both froze in dread at the palpable sensation of being watched.  Every shadow seemed to stare accusingly for the simple crime of speaking too loudly.  Vorador and Kain both took their seats again and tried to concentrate on the game until those inscrutable presences once again gave them the barest of notice.<br><br>âThe only thing that is protecting Malek now is that we have been told not to kill him,â Kain said, pointedly ignoring their argument and the forces that had stopped them.<br><br>âAs if you have ever paid attention when told not to do something,â Vorador complained. âThough I do believe that she phrased it as a request.â<br><br>Kain frowned.  He had faced impossible odds, a mad god, and defied fate itself.  It wasn&#39;t that he was afraid of a capricious girl who could control all of existence and bend his very thoughts to her whim.  Kain was simply aware that some scenarios were preferable to others.<br><br>âTread carefully, Vorador.  She has given you very little attention, but that may change,â Kain warned.  âIgnoring Malek is a small indignity, one that he may suffer for without our interference.â<br><br>âMalek did say that he suffered a fate worse than death after I had left him defeated,â Vorador conceded.  âI can only hope that allowing him to live now will bring him nothing but misery.â<br><br>When their game was finished, Kain and Vorador simply left the set sitting on the table, knowing that the mysterious caretakers would return it to its place.</p>

            <p>I already want to bring Elizabeth from Selfishness in.  Her story is pretty close to being a Pepe Le-pew.<br><br>Would it be wrong to blame her crazy on brain-effecting food sensitivity?  Unlike the correlation between autism and gluten, Elizabeth has something else.  It was discovered when she had to go on a severe diet during training, and suddenly she stopped wanting to be in an action department.

            <p>I think I&#39;m still going to let other people play with these two, but I fell in love with them.  I think I want to develop them as my first team.  I decided to name the Ghostbusters refugee Kimberly and I&#39;ll do her bio once I&#39;ve sorted her out.  Chroma is now Hue.<br><br>The agents first meet â Kimberly and Hue<br><br>Kimberly studied a crossword puzzle as she wandered through the hallways of HQ.  She had never been to RC 414 before, but it wouldn&#39;t have made it easier to find if she had.  She became slightly excited to read a room number in the 400&#39;s, but she had been here long enough to know that she wasn&#39;t even close.<br><br>After she grew bored with the puzzle, she popped her chewing gum a few times and decided to head to the cafeteria.  The way her luck was going, there was a chance that she would end up at the cafeteria, but wandering aimlessly hadn&#39;t worked.  She almost missed the door to RC 414 as she wandered past, but she noticed it just in time.<br><br>A small creature opened the door.  It stood about two feet tall, and resembled a ball of fur on legs.  A pair of beady eyes and a round pink nose were the only features distinguishable in the mass of black fur.  It wore blue mittens, socks, and a belt.  âHello?â he chirped in a hi-pitched voice.<br><br>âWhat are you supposed to be?â  Kimberly had seen stranger things living in the RCs, but it was useful to know the species of your roommate&#39;s pet.<br><br>âDo you speak English?â he asked.<br><br>âWhat do you think, wise guy?  Never met someone from Brooklyn before?â  Kimberly bent down so that she could intimidate the fuzzball.<br><br>He made a placating gesture with his hands, then reached behind his back and pulled out a headset communicator.  He pointedly showed it to Kimberly before settling it on his head.<br><br>She straightened up and crossed her arms.  âVery funny.  I&#39;ve been assigned to this Response Center.â<br><br>âYou&#39;re my new partner?â  He gestured inside.  âEnglish is hard, do you have a comm?â<br><br>Kimberly rifled in her bag to humor the pipsqueak.  Whoever her partner was, they sure knew how to go out of their way for a joke.  Her communicator was a bulky walky-talky, but it came with a headset.<br><br>âI&#39;m Hue,â he said before launching into a string of gibberish that sounded like a 78 record played at 33 rpm.  The comm&#39;s built-in translator made him sound like a teenaged boy.  âI would like for you to learn how to understand Happytalk and I will try my hardest to understand you.â<br><br>âAre you serious?  You look like a stuffed animal!  Why would someone assign something like you to Despatch?â Kimberly had just lost her patience.<br><br>âDon&#39;t judge me by my looks.  I may be small, but size isn&#39;t everything.â</p>

            <p>This is a sample from the 2011 rewrite of Drop a Stone.  (I realize that Sam is already talking like a Nosgoth-resident when she should be using slang and simpler words.)  Things that fans would know: Janos is a vampire, but he was born with angelic wings. Kain is closer to a traditional vampire. The Reaver is a sword that is also a key. Samantha was not in the original, this is a snippet from before she was turned into a vampire.  Janos will be her sire and begin treating her better, but still like a little kid.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>All too soon, one of the servants escorted Samantha back through the opulence of the mansion. His eyes shone with pity as he left her at the door to the library. Dread should have seized Samantha&#39;s heart then, but there was something freeing about having nothing left inside to feel.<br><br>Janos was standing in the middle of the library, and he fixed Samantha with a hawk-like gaze as she slowly descended the stairs.<br><br>âYou are different than you were two days ago. It is good to see that you have learned how to be afraid, even if it came too late to avoid a painful lesson,â Janos told Samantha. âYou have no right to call yourself a coward. Fear is justified for someone who is called to face more than they can handle. That you are still struggling against what you cannot overcome shows that you have not lost your foolishness.â<br><br>Samantha did not expect the flame of anger that ignited in her heart, and could not quench it before saying, âI didn&#39;t ask to come here, at least I don&#39;t think I did. And I admit that it was stupid to get involved. Now I&#39;m just trying to stay alive without wrecking anything else.â<br><br>Janos&#39; patience was not easily dispelled. âTrying to help Kain seems like a poor bid for survival.â<br><br>Samantha&#39;s anger faded, and her shoulders slumped. âIt&#39;s complicated. When I came here, I acted on impulse. Ever since, I&#39;ve been subject to the whims of others. And really, this morning is the first time Kain has actually threatened me.â<br><br>âAnd yet you were already terrified,â Janos pointed out.<br><br>âI know what he&#39;s like, and that he&#39;s been extraordinarily lenient with me so far,â Samantha admitted. âI&#39;m worried about what will happen when he comes back.â<br><br>âYou need not concern yourself with Kain,â Janos insisted.<br><br>âI assume that you&#39;re protecting me because you want something?â Samantha asked.<br><br>Janos nodded. âYou claim to have seen the future. Perhaps there is something in your knowledge that vampiric seers have overlooked.â<br><br>âIt would be easier if you were willing to answer my questions,â Samantha said.<br><br>âWe trusted your kind once before, and they betrayed us. I will not make that same mistake,â Janos insisted.<br><br>âThen why bother listening to what I have to say? Why did I stay up half the night drawing for you?â Samantha asked.<br><br>âBecause I can tell if you lie,â Janos answered.<br><br>âThis is a problem,â Samantha muttered. âYou could change the future, so I can&#39;t tell you much about it. I can&#39;t change the past, but you won&#39;t tell me.â<br><br>Samantha went over to the table, where her drawings from the past night were still scattered. She pulled out the first version of the two champions mural, the one where neither was impaling the other. âAll I have is murals and scraps of explanation. I know what happened, but not why. What are the signs that you&#39;re reading?â<br><br>âLittle girl, you cannot hope to comprehend the wisdom of my race,â Janos&#39; voice was stern. âWhat sort of map did you give to Raziel?â<br><br>âIn addition to the location of the citadel, it was just the locations of six portals that led to elemental shrines,â Samantha said.<br><br>Janos gave Samantha a condescending gaze, âWhat good would that do him before he claims the Reaver?â<br><br>Samantha froze. Raziel did have the Reaver, in a roundabout way. Lie-detector or not, Janos would never believe her explanation, not that it was her business to tell him. It was that same power that held her back from trying to make something up. Finally, she settled on, âOops.â<br><br>âYou are leaping from the heights in your fuzz,â Janos muttered in disgust.<br><br>Samantha sat in confusion for a moment at Janos&#39; words. It sounded like an expression, but from a very alien culture. The connection of heights and fuzz made her think of a cute baby bird falling out of the nest.<br><br>âI may be out of my depth, but at least I&#39;m not drowning,â Samantha snapped. She covered her mouth and brought her temper back under control. âI&#39;m sorry.â<br><br>Janos could understand the shift in element easily enough and said, âHow long can you stay afloat?â</p>

            <p>Hello all! I&#39;ve been reading PPC and the boards and the wiki on and off for. . .geez, probably since middle school, and I guess I finally decided to join in on the community? Haha. . .I am not really interested in applying for permission any time soon- I&#39;m a little wrapped up in my own personal projects- but I&#39;m always open to beta or illustrate if anyone needs! I&#39;d rather just interact with the community for a while, to be honest. (I&#39;ll be adding myself to the Beta Directory after this is posted, actually.)<br><br>I&#39;m into science and history and theology and music and tea, and fond of new and old-ish scifi, fantasy, horror, and fiction that is not too realistic. Authors I generally enjoy include Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, Roger Zelazny, Clive Barker, and Garth Nix, to name a few, as well as the ever-classic Tolkien and Rowling. Webcomics are also great; I think Nimona is still my favorite right now. I also really like (the first few) Artemis Fowl books. When I was in elementary school I wanted to be Artemis Fowl when I grew up. Whoops. I&#39;m also fond of some TV/movie scifi.<br><br>It&#39;s great to meet you all, and I really look forward to finally being a part of this board!! </p>

            <p>Glad you decided to join the crazy! Can you tell me about Nimona? I&#39;ve never heard of it. What other webcomics do you read? I like the Ensign Sue series (started as a parody webcomic set in the new Star Trek movie but has since expanded greatly), The Order of the Stick (long-running fantasy with meta humor throughout), and Scandinavia and the World (like Hetalia but focusing on the Nordic countries).<br><br>Anyway!

            <p>Have an Eevee in a Ranger cloak! Why is she wearing the cloak, you ask? Why, how else would she carry around the shards of Moss Rock or Ice Rock in case you want an evolution into Leafeon or Glaceon? She&#39;s your birthday present, so you should get the full selection of evolution choices for her! I suppose I could&#39;ve just given the shards to you separately, but the cloak is cuter and crosses over fandoms, so it was the preferable choice.<br><br>Also, feel free to take something from the big bin of assorted energy weapons! I don&#39;t think you actually took anything when I offered one to you last time, and even if you did, it&#39;s always nice to have a backup.</p>

            <p>Not to much to do rigt now, but I know very, very soon I am going to be extrodenaraly buisy. However, the days I have been up here have been absolutely gorgous. Not a single cloud in the sky, including around Denali (or Mt. McKinley, according to the US government) which is amasing, as the mountain is so tall, it generates it&#39;s own weather. This means that, through the summer, Denali is only visable 20% of the time. Some tour groups even give out little buttons to people on a train or motercoach on a day that Denali is visable that say they are part of the 20% club. So, I guess that means that I am officially 20% co-*bricked*<br><br>I&#39;m sorry I could not get the next part of the mission out. If you want, you can just procede from where you have it now. We can work somthing out later when I have more time.</p>

            <p>So, I have been reading Fallout: Equestria recently, and it made me wonder: could it be a full continuum? It has fanfiction of it, fan music, fan art, tabletop games, even a fan game in the style of Fallout 3 and New Vegas (which looks really cool, check it out <a href="http://theovermare.com/">here</a>) anoung other fan works. It has it&#39;s very own fandom-within-a-fandom, and a very clear canon, with set rules and history. Sounds to me like it could be a continuum, but is it? Would the PPC see it as worthy of protection?<br><br>This is mostly asking if it is possable for recursive fanfiction to be sporked, but also askes for an in-universe stance on fanfic. If fanfiction can, indeed, become it&#39;s own world, at what point does it separate itself from it&#39;s source world/worlds? What are the canon sources? Why does the PPC protect it? Questions like that.</p>

            <p>How does the PPC work? We know that each fanfic doesn&#39;t - can&#39;t - actually alter the original canon, since multiple missions take place simultaneously. However, we also know that they can <i>affect</i> the canon in some way: LotR canon has been weakened by the onslaught of badfic. We know that plotholes destabilise the world around them; if each fanfic is a pocket universe version of the canon, then destabilising the pocket verse will feed back into the original. The more badfics, the more unstable the canon.<br><br>Equally, since we&#39;re not just trying to wipe out fanfic entirely, goodfic must have a <i>stabilising</i> effect. In some cases, it can even act to partially fill in plotholes in the <i>canon</i>, thus improving the stability above the baseline. So (assuming F:E to be goodfic), F:E itself should be encouraged - ie, left alone.<br><br>But what about spinoffs? If F:E is a pocket universe off MLP, then F:E fanfic must be pocket universes off F:E itself. And that means they <i>must</i> have the same stabilising/destabilising effect on it. And <i>that</i> means that, while they are lower priority (because further separated from the &#39;real&#39; world - remember, the Flowers are able to travel directly to Word Worlds; they have a genuine existence), they can still be PPC&#39;d as F:E fanfic.<br><br>As to when it &#39;separates&#39; itself from its source world - it doesn&#39;t. F:E is still MLP fanfic. In-universe, we&#39;d protect it because destabilising it would destabilise MLP. But <i>any</i> fanfic-of-a-fanfic can be PPC&#39;d based on its differences from the original. If you desperately wanted to PPC <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1521401/1/Diary-of-a-Pancake-Fangirl">Diary of a Pancake Fangirl</a>, you&#39;d have to do so as a fanfic of <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1259630/1/Pancakes">Pancakes!</a> - if something is &#39;canon&#39; to Pancakes! or F:E, it must be treated as canon for spinoffs.<br><br>It&#39;s sort of the same as the PPC. We don&#39;t concrit new missions by saying &#39;well, there&#39;s no such thing as portals between dimensions, and that navigation around &#39;headquarters&#39; is ridiculous&#39;; we concrit it based on the PPC &#39;canon&#39;. Of course, I don&#39;t think that argument would get much traction in-universe - they <i>know</i> they&#39;re real, after all. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... that assumes the situation is F:E has fanfic in the same way as MLP does. If, instead, what exists is a shared universe like the PPC - where characters in one F:E fanfic will be continued in others - then you run into a problem: you could spork something that was regarded as &#39;canon&#39;.<br><br>What if you kill a Mary-Sue, but the community likes her and she keeps showing up in other stories? Do you kill her every time? Do you ignore her? It might be funny for <i>one</i>, but what if there are ten such characters?<br><br>In that case, the only way to handle it would be to either a) treat F:E in its entirety as &#39;canon&#39;, and only spork things that have been officially declared <i>not</i> to be part of the shared universe, or b) treat the entire shared universe as one huge fanfic, and when it gets corrupted enough as a whole to be &#39;badfic&#39;, spork the whole lot of it at once. That might be quite tricky to do. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>While it can technically be argued if it is good or not, it does not fall under the PPC&#39;s definition of badfic at all. We look for bottom of the barrel, worst of the worst, absolute garbage fics that nobody (besides the author) could question as goodfic or not. F:E is not one of those fics. Even if you do not like it, even if you think it takes MLP&#39;s themes and buries them under gore and radiation, or is a senseless smashing of the Fallout franchise into a world where it does not belong, it cannot be argued to be badfic. Not under the PPC definition at least. <br><br>Besides, if it can get <a href="http://onemansponyramblings.blogspot.com/2012/07/6-star-reviews-part-80-fallout.html"> this good of a review</a> from an English teacher, and one of the fandom&#39;s best critics, I&#39;d say that it&#39;s pretty darn good fic.</p>

            <p>How are you claiming &quot;Don&#39;t Panic&quot; as not goodfic? It&#39;s canon-friendly and well-written (which is the PPC&#39;s standard for badfic/not-badfic), and beyond that, it explores characters we never see much of - Halbarad - and gives an interesting new viewpoint on the canon. On top of that, I personally find it really entertaining to read, and very moving in parts.<br><br>It&#39;s not really a deconstruction beyond its original premise.

            <p>Fluttershy and Rarity weren&#39;t even in the infamously bad Cupcakes, and there wasn&#39;t really anything that could be described as a kink, let alone portraying one as common. And what was that about having mental scars after a description of how using a washing machine is preferable? I don&#39;t think I&#39;m entirely sure what that means even in context.<br><br>The Legendary Badfic Cupcakes involved Pinkie Pie, or more accurately a murderous character replacement that the bronies have since dubbed &quot;Pinkamena&quot;, knocking out Rainbow Dash with a sedative pastry, dragging her into a dungeon, and putting the pegasus through a drawn-out torture scene that I don&#39;t remember most of the details of. Her wings were sawed off at one point, and her meat was collected to be baked into cupcakes that were fed to Twilight in one of the fic&#39;s dozen or so alternate endings, but that&#39;s all I remember. It&#39;s probably all for the best that I don&#39;t recall much, though. It&#39;s probably been willingly blocked from my memory.</p>

            <p>I know where they got the name <i>from</i>, but not why they chose it. The &quot;Pinkie&quot; in &quot;Pinkie Pie&quot; is short for &quot;Pinkamena Diane&quot;, which was the first part of Pinkie&#39;s name during her youth when she worked on a rock cultivation farm. After she moved out, canon-Pinkie started using the shorter form, presumably because it was peppier and saying her full name would waste time that could be otherwise spent partying.<br>I&#39;m not sure why the early Cupcakes readership equated &quot;cannibalism and torture&quot; with &quot;going by a longer, but not yet fully extended, version of one&#39;s name&quot;. Maybe because when she decided to shorten her name, canon-Pinkie was simultaneously starting what would become her life&#39;s work of helping others to be cheerful, and the longer name shows that Cupcakes-Pinkie is not wanting people to be happy, because she wants to eat them? That&#39;s ended with a question mark because it&#39;s more of a wild guess than a good hypothesis.</p>

            <p>Yes, Pinkamena refers to straight-maned crazy!Pinkie we see in <i>Party of One,</i> who is in turn associated with Cupcakes!Pinkie. Now, why is Pinkamena connected to Party of One Pinkie? Simple. Pinkamena Diane Pie, the filly, is depressed and has a straight mane. Crazy!Pinkie is depressed and has a straight mane. Ergo, straight maned Pinkie = Pinkamena. Simple.</p>

            <p>You know exactly what argument I&#39;m making and you&#39;re deliberately misinterpreting it. On the off-chance that you&#39;re genuinely as thick as you&#39;re presently pretending to be, I shall spell out my argument:-<br><br>There are criteria for something to meet before it&#39;s classified as badfic within the PPC. Let&#39;s check the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Badfic">badfic page</a> and go through them with Fallout: Equestria in mind.<br><br>1) <i>spelin and gramer</i><br>There are very few technical flaws in the brick that is F:E. Indeed, there are fewer flaws than there are in some PPC missions, and the original story&#39;s a hell of a lot longer than the average mission. I think it&#39;s in the clear on this one, Iunno, you be the judge.<br><br>2) <i>OOC Canon Characters</i><br>This one&#39;s debatable, but I&#39;d argue that the Mane 6, when they do show up, are about as accurate as they can be - especially given the circumstances Equestria&#39;s found itself it. I don&#39;t believe that characters can be considered OOC if they&#39;re responding to a chain of events in a way that would be in character for them that leads to disaster. Then again, I&#39;m rather lenient on that score.<br><br>3) <i>Poor plot</i><br>Insert obvious joke here. But no, the plot in F:E is perfectly acceptable - hell, it&#39;s basically a retelling of the Fallout 3 storyline in Equestria, and while that may not be your cup of tea, that doesn&#39;t make it bad. Fallout 3&#39;s a narratively driven game with a story that&#39;s won praise from a plethora of critics. While I freely admit that I&#39;m not fond of straight retellings, I reckon if you&#39;re going to rip something off, it might as well be something that&#39;s, y&#39;know... good.<br><br>4) <i>Sues and Stus</i><br>I don&#39;t consider Littlehoof to be Sueish - it may seem that way at first, but it isn&#39;t up to her to save the day by herself, and she doesn&#39;t do that. She&#39;s the Vault Dweller in pony form, so yeah, the narrative does centre on her, but you could just as easily criticise a PPC fic for centering on the agents and the criticism would be equally spurious. If you dissgree, that&#39;s fine. Back it up.<br><br>5) <i>Horrible Writing Overall</i><br>No. I&#39;m sorry, but just... no. This is the story from Fallout 3 reworked to fit Equestria, and yeah, there&#39;s going to be some horrible things that show up - but that&#39;s because <i>it&#39;s the story from Fallout</i>. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever played it, but Fallout&#39;s vision of the United States is not a playground full of kittens and sunflowers. It is a post-apocalyptic hellscape and it&#39;s your job to try and fix it. F:E just uses the Elements of Harmony instead.<br><br>tl;dr: You cannot say something is badfic just &#39;cause. We&#39;re the PPC. We&#39;ve got to have some friggin&#39; <i>standards</i> about this, otherwise we turn into what badfic writers say we are: arbitrary snobs in dire need of a visit from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOtmdHiCJNY">this august body</a>.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s is not just a re-telling of Fallout 3. It also takes elements from <i>Fallout</i> 1 and 2. The Goddess is based off of The Master, the main enemy from <i>Fallout</i>. I know there were some things from <i>Fallout 2</i> in there, but heck if I can remember. I have never played any of the Fallout games, see, so it&#39;s difficult to tell what comes from where. Anyway, from what I have heard, it&#39;s a blend of all of the <i>Fallout</i> games, taking primary inspiration from <i>Fallout 3</i><br><br>Oh, and while I&#39;m nitpicking. It&#39;s Littlepip. Or LittlePip. Not Littlehoof.<br><br>However, as I said, I completely agree with your points. Especially since they got to the point much sooner then my monster of a rant did.</p>

            <p>Anyway, what I was getting at there is that a chunk of Jumper&#39;s argument is &quot;this fic is popular, so it can&#39;t be bad!&quot; I then responded rhetorically to Wobbles&#39; &quot;just because you don&#39;t like it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad&quot; by highlighting a Legendary Badfic for the purposes of my point - I might dislike &quot;Cupcakes&quot;, say, but I don&#39;t think many are going to argue it somehow isn&#39;t bad, and to point out there are reasons to deem something &quot;bad&quot; other than personal distaste.<br><br>(I suppose you could step past that and make an argument that all criticism is expression of personal distaste and justification <i>for</i> that distaste, but a lot of that depends on if you believe in the existence of objective good and objective bad in re: creative work. But rest assured this isn&#39;t mudslinging like seems to be implied - I can back this up and I&#39;m writing a reply to Jumper for that purpose, it&#39;s taking time because it&#39;s a post I want to research a bit and put some thought into.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll level with you, that thing is horrible by any measure I&#39;ve looked at it with, and just as emblematic of the worst parts of the fandom as Cupcakes. On top of the technical qualities it shows nothing but contempt for its source canon. And if we truly went off the model you described the PPC with, we&#39;d only ever kill Legendary Badfics.<br><br>But arguments like this are why I only put it as a hypothetical.

            <p>I said that you could think that it is nothing but ponies killing each other in brutal, horrifying ways. I never once said that I thought that opinion was right. However, since that is a common complaint against the story, I decided that the opinion should be voiced. Let me, then, provide my own explanation as to why F:E is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of fan fiction ever written.<br><br>When many people look at the premise, and indeed, the first couple of chapters, it is easy to assume this story is nothing but gore and violence thrown into the magical land of Equestria, for no reason then to see a happy world turned into a horrific wasteland. However, if you read further then Ponyville, and begin to see the history of the Wasteland, you begin to see the true point to this story. This is a story about innocence lost, about good intentions turned wrong, and how it can be restored. It is a story about heroism, virtues, and, yes, friendship. <br><br>This story explores friendship and its power in a way that is even more powerful then the show. We see our band of heroes go through the most horrifying parts of a post-apocalyptic world, and face true changes to their health, sanity, and friendship. The bonds that they build are often the only things that pull them through this horror, not because of the additional firepower that they bring, but the comport and help that they can give. They bring each other out of depressions, they call each other out on their faults to make them better people, they go to any length necessary to make sure everybody is cared for. For a fanfiction based on a show which praises and studies friendship, I think it honors that aspect of the show and explores it in a way that only hardship can do.<br><br>It is a story about virtues. What makes a pony and what values they represent is a massive part of the story, and is explored in great detail. It looks at good, honest virtues, and what can happen when they are &quot;corrupted,&quot; turned dark and vile, yet still recognizable. Corrupted honesty, who tells the absolute, whole truth, even when it is unnecessarily painful. Even using truth to purposefully harm and hurt those around them. Corrupted generosity, who will work and toil to make the best possible future for those after them. Even if it means the loss of freedom and lives of others for now. But it also looks at the positives of virtues. Honesty that benefits, a dedication to being the core truth to the world, for the benefit of all. Sacrifice, who will put themselves in harms way to save another. These virtues are what keeps you sane. They are what gives you purpose. These are also praised in the show, exemplified through the Elements of Harmony. This, to, is in the spirit of MLP.<br><br>The respect this author has for the show is tremendous. She looks at the characters of the show, and gets to the heart of who they are. Then, puts them through the worst of situations possible: War. She looks at what war would do to these characters, and while remaining true to who they were, see what they would do to try and end it. These characters are completely in character, even when it seems like they are not. You will eventually see what their intentions were, how they came to reach those conclusions, and it makes horrifying sense. The phrase, &quot;The portal to Hell is opened through the best of intentions,&quot; is one that is repeated again and again. This phrase summarizes the past Equestria in a better way than anything else I could possibly say.<br><br>This story is a story of hope. Of light in the dark. Yes, Equestria is a radioactive wasteland, with ponies murdering and sometimes even cannibalizing each other to survive.  But this is not shown as a good thing. And there is hope. Littlepip, the main character, finds ways to make this war-torn land a better place. She builds communities, removes raider encampments, and protects the innocent. Most importantly, she finds ways to bring back the old Equestria, in a way. This is not just a horror story. It is a story of hope.<br><br>Now, onto technical aspects. The first 1/3 of the story has the occasional dropped word, or  incorrect punctuation, but this is rare, and not all too serious. Later on, the writing quality vastly improves, and becomes near flawless. Kkat&#39;s use of onomatopoeia is clever, and often a treat on it&#39;s own. The use of first person first the story so well, much better then third person would. We see the world through Littlepip&#39;s eyes, as she comes out blinking from the <s>vault</s> stable, lost and confused. This is, on the whole, good writing, technically speaking.<br><br>The characters are some of the most engaging, interesting characters I have read in any medium. I am not saying they are the absolute best, but you become invested in them. When they are hurt, you feel for them. When they joke and laugh at eachother, you laugh with them. Many of them become your friends. The side characters are interesting to learn about, and plenty of thought has gone into them as well. The villains, while a little clichÃ©d, are still interesting and engaging themselves. They have reasons for what they are doing, and not just &quot;for the evuls.&quot; You love to hate them, and in some cases, even miss them when they do eventually get dealt with.<br><br>Firther, this story has one of the most realistic depictions of addiction I have ever seen. Littlepip becomes addicted to these drugs called Party-Time Mint-Als. They make her think clarer, faster, and even speak better. basically, she&#39;s smarter while on them. However, they have negative side effects, degrading her mind slowly to the point where she needs them to think properly at all. because we are in Littlepip&#39;s mind while she is addicted to this stuff, we see what it does to her. How she craves the next Mint-Al, how she justifies it&#39;s constant use, and the effect it has on her friends. Even when she does get help, and the physical addiction is handled, the mental addiction never leaves her. It is eerily accurate, and worth reading a good deal of the story for that alone.<br><br>I have even more I could day about this story, but I think I have gone on for long enough. Let me end by saying this: this is a good story. It is well written, has fantastic characters, and despite how it seems, it honors both source materials. You do not need to have any knowledge of Fallout to read this, though you do have to know MLP up to around mid-season 2. Is it for everybody? Lord no. Is it flawless? Absolutely not. But this is, and I am being completely honest when I say this, a story I would pay money for. I am going to play the game when it comes out, I am going to read more side stories, and I am absolutely going to read it again and again. If you do not like it, fine, good for you. That does not make it badfic.<br><br>One final thing: You mentioned that &quot;Just because an English teacher likes it, does not make it good.&quot; You are correct, and I am sorry if it came off that way. However, let me ask you this: did you read the review? I mentioned that he is an English teacher to lend to his credibility, but if that is not helpful, then let me elaborate on why I shared that review. Chris is one of the best reviewers I have seen in the fandom. He is clear and concise, remaining professional the entire way. He explains what he likes and what he does not like in a story in a professional manner, where you can see exactly why he thinks the way he does. He is well read, and knows what works and does not work for him. That is why I shared the review.<br><br>I hope this clarifies my stance a little more. I apologize if I rambled, which I am certain that I did, but I cannot sing the praises of this story enough. If you can stomach the violence, gore, and swearing, it is honestly one of my favorite stories, period.</p>

            <p>F:E has one and only one canon story: the first. The author, kkat, loves all of the spinoffs of F:E that others write, but has stated many times that only the first is canon. Well, the first, and a single lemon chapter that sombody wrote that she declaired canon, but there is nothing special in that. Heck, even things that kkat herself wrote for a tabletop are explicitly not canon. She said that if the community wants to use them, fine, but they are not official.<br><br>So, now I may have to consider what, exactly, happens when a spinoff destabilises.

            <p>All fanfics are, if you want to get technical, AUs of the original continuum (or continua if it&#39;s a crossover), with varying levels of divergence from the original; some are canon-friendly enough that their separate continuum could be assumed to merge harmlessly with the original, others have a stable coexistence, and the continua created by the badfic the PPC kills warp and feed off the original continuum, eventually trying to replace it. <br><br>It&#39;s... debatable which of those latter two (harmless coexistence or malignant warping) FE falls into, and because of (no offence) the fandom&#39;s tendency to shoehorn ponies into everything the main continuum has a <i>tonne</i> of crossover subcontinua at any given point, but when you have a fanfic-generated continuum that <i>itself</i> gets fanfic, yeah, things get complicated. My stance is that, because it&#39;s still derived off two canon sources, it doesn&#39;t become a full continuum of its own, but it is a very large sub-continuum of its source materials; what you have is a fanfic world that has stabilised enough to become a whole setting of its own, but the PPC would be under no obligation to defend it as an &quot;actual&quot; canon because it&#39;s inherently tied to Fallout and MLP. Under this view, yes, something like Fallout Equestria could be sporked, and the way I view it is killing the main fic would, in-universe, destroy all the ficworlds that spun off from it; imagine walking into a house and suddenly blowing up all the support beams.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s an off-the-cuff attempt to answer the question of &#39;exactly how nasty can you make the PPC sound - without changing what they actually <i>do</i>?&#39;. It&#39;s more inspired by my own comments than wobbles&#39; post, but it seemed better to put it at the top of the thread.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The elf settled at the table and looked around at his companions. Tall and dark, with a fierce light flickering in his eyes, he was one of the most infamous Deep Elves of all time, and a Kinslayer three times over. Those who crossed him rarely survived the experience.<br><br>âI thought that went rather well,â he said, stretching his arms and leaning back in a show of lazy indulgance.<br><br>To his left, the ancient vampire grinned, baring her cruel fangs. She may have looked young, but those dark eyes had seen hundreds of years roll by. âYes,â she agreed, a hiss in her voice. âAnd the girl certainly deserved what she got â or is that the other way round?â<br><br>The third member of the quartet didnât bother to turn towards her. What use would it be, when his eyes had been torn from their sockets weeks before, leaving only gaping wounds? âI was impressed by how skillfully you brought her down,â he said to the elf.<br><br>The dark one smiled, reliving the moment his arrow had pinned Aragornâs new bride to the tree. The first shot had not killed her instantly, and he had watched as the light slowly faded from her eyes, her life draining out with her dripping blood. âThank you,â he said. âI was rather more taken with your partnerâs efforts.â<br><br>Again, the blind man didnât turn â but what need was there, when he could hear his ragged-haired partnerâs quiet giggling, that constant background to their concentration? âShe has her moments,â he allowed. âAnd she is very good at exorcisms.â<br><br>âShe needed to be,â the bloodsucker recalled. âThe things Legolas was trying to do to Gimliâ¦â She shuddered as she recalled the filth that had permeated the elfâs heart â the violations he had planned to inflict on his friend, the horrors of his unbridled lust for his fellow man. âIt was almost as bad as that village.â<br><br>The fell elf chuckled, a sound that seemed to rise up from subterranian caverns, not from any pair of lungs. âIâm glad <i>thatâs</i> gone,â he said, smirking at the memory of flames licking over thatched roofs, the cries of children and mothers as they burned within their homes. âIt was a blight on the world, it truly was.â<br><br>âWell, itâs been fun,â the vampire said, and her colleagues nodded as they recalled the long hunt: how they had watched their prey from the shadows, recording their most intimate moments, gathering everything they could. Then the denument, when they had exposed each characterâs weaknesses, baring their secret deeds for all to see â and, while they stood confused, had struck, murdering the girl and tearing the lovers apart, barring them forever from their twisted passions.<br><br>âYes,â the eyeless man stated. âIt certainly has.â<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Or, in the non-creepy version:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Dafydd sat down and stretched his arms. âI thought that went rather well,â he said, glancing at his companions.<br><br>Selene grinned. âYes,â she agreed. âAnd the girl certainly deserved what she got â or is that the other way round?â<br><br>Salamander, the blind Slasher, smiled. âI was impressed by how skillfully you brought her down,â he said to Dafydd.<br><br>The elf grinned. âThank you,â he said. âI was rather more taken with your partnerâs efforts.â<br><br>Kayleigh, sitting next to Salamander, was off in her own world (as usually), giggling at some remembered joke. âShe has her moments,â Sal allowed. âAnd she is very good at exorcisms.â<br><br>âShe needed to be,â Selene pointed out âThe things Legolas was trying to do to Gimliâ¦â She shuddered, thinking of the way the elf had practically thrown himself at his friend in a display about as far from their canonical relationship as it was possible to get. âIt was almost as bad as that village.â<br><br>Dafydd chuckled. âIâm glad <i>thatâs</i> gone,â he said, picturing the glittery cottages Aragornâs ânew queenâ had created to be her origin. âIt was a blight on the world, it truly was.â<br><br>âWell, itâs been fun,â Selene said, standing up and looking for the exit.<br><br>Salamander reflected on their joint mission and shrugged. âYes,â he agreed, âit certainly has.â<br><br><hr>
<br><br>That was actually alarmingly fun. (And not canonical, since Sal was only blinded-and-back-in-HQ after Dafydd had retired - but apart from that, it&#39;s close enough) It also demonstrates the points I&#39;ve tried to make: that <i>anything</i> can sound bad if you phrase it right.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... we can do the same &#39;render the department down to its basics and make it sound creepy, horrible, and downright immoral&#39; to any department in the PPC.<br><br>The DMS: kill people&#39;s girlfriends and then make them forget about it (because it doesn&#39;t count if they never know it happened)<br><br>The DBS: drive out the gayness! Only straight people are allowed in <i>our</i> fandoms!<br><br>DOGA: Firebomb entire countries because we don&#39;t like one of their former inhabitants.<br><br>&amp;c &amp;c. The fundamental difference in all these cases is that the thing that&#39;s being removed is <i>uncanonical</i>.

Sort of like:<br><br>The police: pulling people off the street or out of their houses and putting them in chains.<br><br>The fire brigade: spraying high-pressure water over people&#39;s belongings.<br><br>Ambulances: kidnapping unconscious people and taking them to massive complexes full of others like them in order to inject them with strange substances and cut their skin with knives.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I see your point, but I think it can be hard to draw the line about emotions in certain continua, particularly the one I&#39;m focusing on, Twilight. Wobbles is a recovering bit from a Twilight angstfic, and while I&#39;ve seen a lot of Pinkie Pie antics being hurled at people by the DoA, there&#39;s very little in the way of actual <i>therapy</i> being offered by them as far as I&#39;ve been able to make out from the material available.  No doubt you&#39;ll prove me wrong about this, possibly with an example of how the Samaritans are secret mind-rapists or whatever, but I&#39;m genuinely squicked by what they do.<br><br>Take Twilight. More specifically, take New Moon, which is the second book in the series for those lucky enough to not know what I&#39;m talking about. It&#39;s a story that&#39;s absolutely riddled with idiotic, pointless angst between cardboard characters. If a DoA mission was sent to a New Moon badfic, I imagine it&#39;d be fairly tricky to judge what was canonical pointless miserable whinging and what wasn&#39;t. Maybe that&#39;s all covered by FicPsych, Iunno, but even if it is, dropping someone who&#39;s had their brain bombed flat by cuddly toys and Prozac into their tender embrace does not sound like an easy thing to fix.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s why they pay us such big salaries. ;)<br><br>Seriously, it could be equally hard to determine whether a character is OOC - except we have CADs for that. The agent&#39;s <i>job</i> is to determine whether something is canonical or not.<br><br>Taking <i>New Moon</i> as an example, having Bella angsting over Edward to any degree is probably canonical, since she, y&#39;know, tries to kill herself over him. Having her go suicidal over <i>Jacob</i> wouldn&#39;t be canon-friendly, since she only vaguely mopes about him. Equally, Edward trying to kill himself would be canonical (since he does), but, oh, Alice having a breakdown over E&amp;B wouldn&#39;t be. Except insofar as she&#39;s a walking permanent breakdown.<br><br>Yes, it can be tricky to determine whether something is in or out of character - but, uh, that&#39;s their job.<br><br>And no, the Department of Angst don&#39;t provide therapy, and the Department of Mary-Sues doesn&#39;t provide well-written OCs. What both departments do is remove the uncanonical influence long enough for canon to snap back into place. Except in severely broken canons, you don&#39;t need to try and fix everything - just break the lock. DOGA doesn&#39;t have to move mountains around to repair geographical contraction - the canon does that itself, once there&#39;s no badfic holding them in place. Angst doesn&#39;t have to solve a character&#39;s emotional problems - the canon does that itself, once there&#39;s no badfic holding them in angst. The situations are directly analogous.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Or all right, if we&#39;re going to have <i>that</i> lovely little digression again.<br><br>I&#39;ve obviously misconstrued the mission statement of the DoA entirely, probably because of my own views about and experiences with psychotherapy.

            <p>I am hearing you about psychotherapy.  Sometimes it can be like &quot;Donkey for a Day&quot; <a href="http://pooh.wikia.com/wiki/Donkey_for_a_Day"><a href="http://pooh.wikia.com/wiki/Donkey_for_a_Day">http://pooh.wikia.com/wiki/Donkey_for_a_Day</a></a> Which I think MLP:FiM ripped off.<br><br>As long as the DoA can determine what the baseline for that character is, they should be fine.<br><br>Actually, I am seeing a problem.  They need to be more in-tune with the characters they are de-angsting.  I imagine the agents in the hallways aren&#39;t the only ones who react negatively to glitter.  For the Good Omens fic, I would have liked to see them try classical music and fluffing an old book in their face.  (Shop should already have been saturated with the scent.)<br><br>It&#39;s probably the difference between fixing an extrovert, (you get them into their element by dragging them to a party,) and fixing an introvert, (wrap them in blankets and distract them with a good movie.)  You don&#39;t fix an introvert by trying to turn them into an extrovert.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to look at the actual corpus for a minute, rather than just the Wiki (because older Wiki articles tend to be full of unsupported statements). There are only apparently two DOA missions (technically, by the way, Action departments have all-caps acronyms, so it&#39;s DOA rather than DoA):<br><br>-In the <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/97761.html#cutid1">second mission</a>, the only treatment seems to be stomach-pumping a badfic-induced alcoholic and then neuralysing him.<br><br>-In <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/26887.html#cutid1">the first mission</a>, we have this introduction:<br><br><i>Lasa clawed caked glitter out of her face and continued to rifle through the cupboard. âSo did I. But thatâs not whatâs in the cupboard. Instead we have glitter. And balloons. Chocolate. Origami paper.â<br>âWell the Aloe Vera told us we had to cheer up canon characters who were angsty. So I guess we-â<br>âWhat? Put on a circus act? Apparently thatâs not going to be enough. Listen to this. Weâve also got an industrial sized jar of Prozac. An industrial sized jar of something called âPPC-modified Benzodiazepine - Addictive Properties Completely Removed!â and something else called âPerphenazine; Completely Elf-Safe!â And a book, mysteriously entitled âPsychotherapeutic Drugs for Dummies â A Reference for the Rest of Us.ââ<br>âWeâre supposed to drug them? I thought the Department of Fictional Psychology handled that?â<br>âSays here,â and Lasa waved the synopsis of the Departmentâs âfunctionsâ, âthat if theyâre really bad then they do go to the DFP, but if we can deal with it ourselves, then we should. And, if possible, without recourse to drugs.â<br>Mombi hauled herself across the room and peered short-sightedly at the labels on the jars. âWeâre going to have to come up with something else to call these. I mean, âBenzodiazepineâ. It doesnât exactly roll off the tongue.â She pushed the huge jars of pills aside to reveal . . . more jars of pills. <br>âWhat are these?â<br>âBleeprin,â read out Lasa, âCan we give Bleeprin to canon characters?â<br>âI guess,â said Mombi uncertainly. âOnes that have been squicked really badly, perhaps. And look here;â she hauled a bag out of the bottom of the cupboard. âWeâve got an exorcism kit.â</i><br><br>Then, in the actual mission, we have this:<br><br><i>âExcuse me? The where?â<br>âI think she means Hell. This angst is reaching excessive levels. Glitter rain time, I think,â said Mombi, checking her wristwatch Angstometer. âWill you do the honours?â<br>Lasa took the glitter jar and the telescopic stepladder that Mombi fished from the Bag (which had been based by Makes-Things on Mary Poppinsâ bag and had unfathomable depths. Mombi swore she had a particle accelerator in there, although Lasa doubted this) and, climbing to a height of about four feet, started gently raining glitter on the angsting angel. Mombi, constructing saccharine balloon-animals and origami figures, accidentally let one of her pink poodle balloons go. It bounced softly past Aziraphale, over each of his feet, and off into the opposite corner of the bookshop without him noticing. The atmosphere was starting to get so sweet and sugary that even Lasa started feeling slightly happier, but it appeared to have no effect on the angel. The blonde agent called down to her partner.<br>âMombi, this isnât working. I think weâre going to need the light.â Mombi rooted around in the Bag some more, and produced what looked like a torch. She passed it up to Lasa, who turned it on. Immediately the room was suffused in a warm, sunshine-like yellow light.<br>Still nothing. <br>âWhat are we going to do? This isnât working.â<br>Lasa thought hard, then switched off the torch and screwed the lid back on the glitter jar.<br>âWhat are you doing?â<br>âWe drug him up, leave here, and go follow Crowley. The Words are recording some heinous errors there, and heâs coming to see Aziraphale. We nip back, grab a Bad Slasher and exorcise the pair of them. Two birds, one stone. Bang. Easy as pie. *Pigeon* pie.â<br>Mombi shivered. She quite liked pigeons. But she handed Lasa the spray hypodermic (blatantly stolen from the Red Dwarf continuum by Makes-Things, like so much of their equipment), packed with benzodiazepine, nevertheless.</i><br><br>And this:<br><br><i>âUm, guys?â began Mombi, tugging at Lasaâs sleeve. Lasa half-turned, impatiently, and saw what Mombi was worried about. Aziraphale was bouncing off the walls. Literally; his angelic powers being of great help here.<br><br>âOoooh, weâre screwed,â said Trojie very seriously. âHow much did you give him?â<br>âThe normal dosage for a human of his height and build,â said Lasa, beginning to look concerned. âWhy?â<br>âBecause supernatural beings have much more sensitive metabolisms than humans. Look, letâs sort out Crowley and then get to Aziraphale. Might have to take him to the Doc.â<br>âWe canât leave him like this!â cried Mombi. She was right to worry. The angel had spread his wings and was hovering around the lightbulb, making âpow!â noises and incinerating things with miniature bolts of lightning. Intermittently he would hum snatches of the 1812 Overture.</i><br><br>This all suggests that the DOA has two methods: the circus act (which doesn&#39;t work), and the drug-and-neuralyse technique. Since - as Neshomeh pointed out - taking uncanonical drugs into Word Worlds shouldn&#39;t really be done, perhaps the next person to write the DOA should upgrade their techniques (based on the fact that their &#39;primary&#39; method didn&#39;t work anyway): take a slower approach to the circus show that will lighten the mood over several scenes, and break them out gently. If that doesn&#39;t work - which it <i>should</i> most of the time - create a hybrid <a href="http://larryniven.wikia.com/wiki/Tasp">tasp</a>-neuralyser which hits them with a concentrated burst of happy to break the angst-lock, then switches it off and immediately neuralyses them. If you wire them together like that, it would be impossible to misuse it (and leave them <i>remembering</i> the tasp effect, which could lead to addiction).<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: &#39;rede&#39; means &#39;counsel&#39;, and is the word in the name of Ãthelred UnrÃ¦d. The OED seems to think that &#39;ready&#39; derived from an unrelated (though identical) word; they link &#39;rede&#39; to  Middle Dutch &#39;raet, rait, raedt&#39;, but the root of &#39;ready&#39; to Middle Dutch &#39;reet, reede, rÄde, ree&#39;. That latter suggests that &#39;ready&#39; might be connected back to &#39;right&#39; - as in &#39;upright&#39;. I&#39;unno. Linguij iz hart. ~hS</p>

            <p>The two others addressed this a bit, but it seems to me your reservations might be more in how the DoA&#39;s purpose is worded than what they actually do. Their job isn&#39;t &quot;force unhappy people to be happy&quot; unless you strip it right down to its barest bones minus any context. If my friend is massively, uncharacteristically depressed, am I a bad person if I try to cheer him up? <br><br><br>...Aaaaaaaand Neshomeh basically said what I was going to while I typed this (except the &quot;ignore it if you want&quot; because selective continuity bugs me), so I&#39;ll just leave you with that rhetorical until I think of a new thing to contribute.</p>

            <p>Dear Mrs. Trellis,<br><br>I think &quot;forcing them to be happy&quot; is inaccurate. They&#39;re not leaving the characters in a state of uncanonical happiness, merely driving out an uncanonical force of angst long enough for the canon to take over. It&#39;s not significantly different from neuralyzing them or exorcizing them to induce a canon snapback; they&#39;re just doing it with anti-depressants, balloon animals, and puppies.<br><br>That said, I am a little dubious about using something like Prozac in a world where it doesn&#39;t belong, like Middle-earth, but presumably that&#39;s heavily discouraged, just like non-canonical weapons are discouraged.<br><br>Bottom line, though: This is the PPC. It&#39;s meant to be played for laughs, so putting a &quot;so vile you shouldn&#39;t even look this up&quot; spin on it is way off. If it rubs you the wrong way regardless, the recommended response is to simply carry on with your own spin-off like it doesn&#39;t exist. For instance, I will never mention Bleep-Blaps, Bleepnerds, or half the other Bleep-things in my spin-offs, because I personally think Bleeprin derivatives have reached the point of absurdity (and not the good kind). That doesn&#39;t mean other people can&#39;t have fun with them, though; it&#39;s just that I&#39;m old and crotchety and prefer the classics. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. I hear North Wales is lovely this time of year.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m no expert either, but it seems to me using their methods on stories with lots of angst is like watching a classic cartoon after a rotten day; the act of laughing at the characters gets your mental state/bodily chemicals back to normal, so making the fic&#39;s characters laugh will cancel out the angst. Also, they&#39;re new according to the Wiki; I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll work out a proper way to do things.<br><br>You raise a good point about the &quot;don&#39;t force people to be happy&quot; thing.

            <p>I don&#39;t know if anyone has seen it, but there&#39;s a story on fanfiction.net that has a lot of OOC and Mary Sue-ish characters.<br>It&#39;s about the Akatsuki, from Naruto, turning into cats and coming to our world. It&#39;s called &quot;Consider Yourselves Kitties&quot; by DaniZaraki if anyone cares. There are two sequels: &quot;Man, I Miss the Kitties,&quot; and &quot;Screw the Kitties.&quot;<br>The main characters, Alice and Kathryn end up being loved by the Akatsuki within hours of meeting them, which seems pretty weird in a not-gonna-happen-for-the-life-of-me kind of way. Alice can even threaten them with no repercussions, which makes absolutely no sense, considering the Akatsuki consists of  cold-blooded murderers.<br>And on top of all that, Alice has perfect photographic memory to the point that she changes the storyline of Naruto so the Akatsuki can survive and she can have a happily-ever-after ending. <br>Also, apparently iPods and cellphones work and have reception and internet access across world/dimensional barriers.<br>The list goes on and on. <br>Here&#39;s a link if anyone cares: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6603075/1/Consider-Yourselves-Kitties"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6603075/1/Consider-Yourselves-Kitties">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6603075/1/Consider-Yourselves-Kitties</a></a></p>

            <p>The thing to remember is that in the real world, badfic authors mostly <i>aren&#39;t</i> out to wreak havoc on the Word Worlds. They&#39;re mostly just people - actually, mostly just <i>kids</i> - who have an idea and want to write it down. Sometimes their skills fall a bit short of their vision - or, as it may be, several miles short.<br><br>But ultimately, the only way to improve at writing is to <i>try</i>. &#39;A man&#39;s reach should exceed his grasp/Or what&#39;s a heaven for?&#39; If you stick to writing See Spot Run, you&#39;ll never be <i>able</i> to write beyond that level.<br><br>So write as ambitiously as you can dream. Sometimes - often - you&#39;ll fall flat on your face. But even if no-one offers you any concrit whatsoever - even if, in fact, no-one else ever sees it - if you&#39;re <i>trying</i> to improve, simply writing more and more will help you get there.<br><br>But concrit helps a lot more than just doing it. So if you want to improve as a writer, you <i>want</i> people to see your work... even when it&#39;s bad. And yeah, there are better ways to do that than to post on FF.net. But a lot of people don&#39;t know that.<br><br>Like I say, I don&#39;t know if this is a troll or not - I can&#39;t make head or tail of the first chapter, even once I get past the punctuation. But &#39;it&#39;s bad so it must be a troll&#39; is a dangerous thought regardless of circumstances.

            <p>Well, partly missing.  The part hosted on Miss Cam&#39;s site is still fine, but the chapters hosted on Lord of the Rings Fanfiction are gone, along with the entire rest of the website.  The banner at the top of the tab declares it to be hacked by a (apparently Nigerian, as if that matters) hacker.  (I&#39;m not going to link there from here, just in case.  Links are on the &quot;Suedom&quot; page on the wiki.)<br><br>I can&#39;t seem to find &quot;Suedom&quot; archived on the Wayback of lotrff.com, either.  So, does anyone have the rest of Suedom saved?  And if not, are there any steps we can take to give control of the website back to the webmasters and restore it?  (The Contact Us page <i>appears</i> operational, but I&#39;m not sure it should be trusted.)</p>

            <p>... the most obvious way for a mission to fail is for something bad to happen to one or both agents, and that&#39;s something most writers don&#39;t want to do to, y&#39;know, the characters they plan on using again. Heck, I have two missions of my own which resulted in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=19EprDuFxOQWljGI_mTMjeoZzi9EQI9UmTVKxIZuq1Sc">serious injury</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18kau8JXCwSLBJrzCP4ZGyr2WeBRkdoSYOpeV8qhQNnk">worse</a>, plus one which <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1o-WydVPWUJZBx8Ewlm8UhV7UCEDXw7Dga0jXZSE7GUM">knocked two agents unconscious</a> partway through. But none of those <i>failed</i>, because PPC agents finish the job.<br><br>Heck, take a look at the ending of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1-s7LIQsH6vWklzYLPriCMYS5CWQDIsUdtRXJ5qHdgCM">this one</a>. The Sue put herself way out of reasonable reach - and we brought half the PPC in and <i>exorcised an entire planet</i> to be sure of getting her. Agents of the PPC don&#39;t give up on a mission.

            <p>... if an agent pair <i>were</i> to fail a mission due to something bad happening to both of them, how would we know? If they don&#39;t survive to make their report, then we probably aren&#39;t going to be reading about it. <br><br>The Wiki notes that the DMS &#39;has a fairly high turnover rate, mostly due to the inherent risks of bad writing and in confronting beings that, due to their speshulness, are often far more powerful than the agents themselves.&#39;, and yet it&#39;s very rare to hear about any deaths occurring in missions - that sort of thing was much more common in Emergencies. <br><br>My own personal headcanon is that all of the agents that had a couple of missions and then haven&#39;t been heard of for a few years are listed as MIA, presumed KIA. Agents <i>do</i> fail missions, it&#39;s just that when they do, they don&#39;t tend to be able to tell their stories. I&#39;m not saying that agents fail missions all the time (if they did then the staffing shortage would probably be an even bigger problem), but it probably does happen.   <br><br>A less dramatic possibility for a &#39;failure&#39; would be to have the agents only be partially successful - maybe a pair of Assassins succeed in capturing a Sue and charging her, but then she breaks loose and escapes via a plothole. Her influence is gone from that particular story, so the agents succeeded in part, but the Sue could still cause damage elsewhere (and now has experience dealing with the PPC), so it could&#39;ve gone better. That could be a way of setting up a bit more of a story arc if an author had used the same self-insert/character in multiple stories. </p>

            <p>Wait... &quot;interminable&quot;? That means something like &quot;unending&quot;. The word I suggested was &quot;indeterminate&quot;, which is the actual word meaning what was intended by &quot;undeterminable&quot;. What you&#39;ve put is not wrong; it&#39;s just changed the meaning of the sentence.<br>As for Mary Sue... Thinking about it, I do prefer &quot;&#39;Sue&quot; as the contraction, because it clarifies that it&#39;s part of a larger term. So that&#39;s all good. :-)<br>And I&#39;m happy to help. I might do a couple of other stories, if you want, though the Board is perhaps not the best place to put that sort of thing.</p>

            <p>...The typical agent seems pretty good at what they do, at least enough so they keep surviving missions, so mission failures probably only seldom happen. If it looks likely to happen they&#39;re probably allowed to call in reinforcements (like what happened with Alumia; helping agents who&#39;ve found themselves in over their heads is also one of the duties of the DIA&#39;s Special Response Division, as well as Floaters&#39; Special Operations Division according to the wiki), and should a mission go completely belly-up I imagine the Flowers just send more agents into the fi...il <i>someone</i> manages to kill it.</p>

            <p>Most are referred to by serial number alone, and one is referred to as &quot;the Skipper&quot; because he&#39;s skipper of a boat, but the three named ones are Scrapper, Scervo, and Dreadfuse. Those sound like Decepticons. I would fully support your decision if you choose to name your new robot after someone like Soundwave or Dirt Boss or Demolishor.</p>

            <p>Nobody has posted anything all day today. How odd. Maybe I&#39;m the only one with no life at the moment. (He, he.)<br><br>Anyway, I have a question about the Department of Internal Affairs. I have been looking around the fiction for that Department, and I haven&#39;t caught any instances of reading charge lists to suspected rule breakers. I mean, obviously they can&#39;t do that very much in an invasion, but it got me wondering (since I have not read very many actual missions other than Mary Sue Invasions). Do agents of the DIA need to read off any charges? I am assuming that they don&#39;t, because I haven&#39;t found any in the one purely DIA mission I read, but as usual, I like to make sure.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re just reading invasion stuff... need I explain why this is concerning to me at this point? Lemme skip that and get straight to my recommendations for missions to read that should give you a <i>real</i> idea of the PPC:<br><br>* <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">Jay and Acacia</a> - Duh. If you haven&#39;t finished the Original Series yet, make it a priority!<br><br>* <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2557254/1/">Caitlin and Sidh</a> - This is just a one-off, but I think it introduces the PPC really well, has excellent characterization, and is overall high quality writing. I wish they&#39;d written more.<br><br>* <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/architeuthis/">Architeuthis</a> - The original Department of Intelligence series. Her definition of a Mary Sue is out of date now, but this is still an important foundational series.<br><br>* <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/JAAKSONS/">Nenya and Rosie</a> - The Jay and Acacia Kooky Spin-Off Nerd Society. Of particular inspiration to me is the FicPsych chapter.<br><br>* <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?keyword=PPC+Missions&amp;user=uncommon_comma&amp;sortby=des">Mara and Isaiah</a> - The Department of Technical Errors. Excellent and foundational. Araeph is a real-life editor, so you can&#39;t go wrong taking cues from her.<br><br>* <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/48575.html">Trojanhorse and Paddlebrains</a> - Department of Bad Slash. Absolutely hilarious. Takes an under-appreciated department and <i>owns</i> it in a way few others have managed before or since.<br><br>* <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Agents.htm">Dafydd and Selene (and Constance)</a> - Department of Geographical Aberrations. This is how you start if you want to work your way up to tackling Legendary Badfics and big, sweeping plots.<br><br>* <a href="http://bronzeclockwork.livejournal.com/1229.html">Suicide, Diocletian, and Ithalond</a> - Tungsten Monk is quite simply one of the funniest people I know. Also, she&#39;s a real-life published author now.<br><br>I could go on at length with this (and include some more recent writers), but those are, in my opinion, some of the most historically important spin-offs as well as the best-written. If you read nothing else, you could do a lot worse and no better than reading those.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. I&#39;m obviously rather partial to <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/">my own work</a>, too. Supernumerary even had a real fangirl for a while. (She got better. ^_~ )</p>

            <p>Over the decade-plus of the PPC Board&#39;s existence, we&#39;ve had several Gatherings - get-togethers of community members for a day of fun and general randomness. Starting with <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/OxfordGath.htm">Oxford 2004</a>, Britain has been a hub for Gatherings - we&#39;ve done <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/LondonGath.htm">London</a> <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/LondonGath05.htm">three</a> <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/LondonGath06.htm">times</a>, <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/BathGath.htm">Bath twice</a>, and even went as far north as <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/YorkGath08.htm">York</a> (and <a href="http://tea-fiend.livejournal.com/172300.html">Leeds</a> and Hull, but I wasn&#39;t there for those).<br><br>But it&#39;s been a few years since the last one. So is anyone up for it?<br><br>Activities are pretty ad-hoc, and decided on the fly by all attendees - so there&#39;s no need to worry about being dragged into something you don&#39;t want to do. Anyone in the PPC community, however long or short your stay, is welcome - and yes, you can bring friends, parents, bodyguards, anything. You won&#39;t need them, but this is the Internet - I understand people get a bit wary about safety.<br><br>This is a UK Gathering, but it&#39;s not just for people in the UK. If you honestly think you can get here - or are planning a trip to Britain anyway - you&#39;re welcome to come along. Just try and distinguish between &#39;I wish I could&#39; and &#39;I actually can&#39;!<br><br>Now the tricky parts... when and where. For now, I&#39;m going to leave these wide open. Well, mostly wide:<br><br><b>When</b>: This summer. Assuming we still have school or university students on the Board, the summer holidays are usually the best option. We usually (but not always) run Gatherings on Saturday. So suggest some dates that are good for you, and we&#39;ll try to narrow it down.<br><br><b>Where</b>: We&#39;re going high tech with this one... <a href="http://www.mapservices.org/myguestmap/map/Huinesoron">here is a map</a>. Zoom in on your location - or rather, your nearest big city or town, or whatever you feel comfortable with; we don&#39;t care where your house is - click, and fill in your name. The &#39;message&#39; can be your town (again) or just... a message, but I think it does demand you put it in. And select a face to represent you.<br><br>The &#39;where&#39; will be decided based on where people are. If everyone lives Up North, there&#39;s no point planning a Gathering in London! Folks from overseas, unless you have a specific location you&#39;re visiting, it&#39;s best to stick your pin in London - that&#39;s where most of the transport network comes in to.<br><br>I&#39;ve already pinned myself and Kaitlyn (apparently I live in a school and she in a park - so pretty accurate!), so come along, and join the... uh... the preparing-for-fun, I guess.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If I get the job I&#39;m going after, I&#39;d probably have to see how late a flight I can get on Friday or if I can conjure some reason to get that day off so I can get up there, but this lands between my summer courses and the fall semester so at least school wouldn&#39;t be in the way.

            <p>... flying back and forth across the Atlantic costs a <i>lot</i> of money. It&#39;s really not something you want to do as a day-trip.

            <p>I&#39;m a Northerner, as some of the older guys might remember, but the map won&#39;t load for me. I&#39;m from Lancashire. But if I get enough advance warning of the date I can plan it around work (yes, I have a JOB now) and I SHOULD be able to make it!

            <p>It&#39;s in a fairly central-ish location in America, as far as population goes, and at this time of year, we could all go watch some horse races at Churchill Downs! <br><br>Okay, maybe not. Tickets during Derby season are ridiculously overpriced. And, to be honest, there&#39;s really nothing to do here. Chicago would probably be a better American location since it&#39;s fairly central, very populous, easy to get to, and has a lot of stuff to do. <br><br>Or St. Louis! Have you ever visited there? The Botanical Gardens are beautiful. Of course, NYC is great; I&#39;d love to visit again. Last time was... *checks photo album* Holy crap, ten years ago??<br><br>So, any other Americans who&#39;d be willing/maybe able to do a US gathering in 2015? Might as well start planning now. ;)</p>

            <p>Exactly what it sounds like, really. I found this amazing story about a D&amp;D player who was in a campaign sent to aid a nation of Victim Sues, and he instead outwitted his DM to continue a war that would end in their destruction (oh, and he got the girl. Sorta), but I&#39;m not sure if that sort of thing is welcome here, and I&#39;m too insecure to just post it anyways. So, should I, our shouldn&#39;t I?</p>

            <p>When we last left our heroes, they had taken charge of the Royal Guard and imprisoned him in the cellar of their manor. He is prevented from leaving the corner he&#39;s in by some Magic Circles against Fae, there&#39;s an Eye of Warning ritual in case the Tiefling tried shenanigans. The Guard himself was blindfolded and had his arms tied behind him in a sort of iron sleeve thingy, because his race (Eladrin- a close relative to elves) can teleport to anywhere they have line-of-sight to. <br><br>With that out of the way, here&#39;s what happened with the plot: The DM decided that the elvish investigators would question everyone on their alibis. OP&#39;s was that he had underestimated elvish wine and had been passed out drunk.<br><br>To foil Detect Lies spells, he told the truth: He had indeed drunk too much wine and passed out that night. He&#39;d just done it after he&#39;d killed the Prince (he failed to mention this bit).<br><br>The real fun happens when his compatriot, the Ranger, is questioned, and something comes up. In OP&#39;s words &quot;I don&#39;t know whether it makes my compatriot brilliant, or intensely creepy&quot;. When the Ranger is questioned, she ends up admitting that she had slept with him while he was drunk. OOC he doesn&#39;t know quite what to think, as he knows she did it to secure her alibi.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Dwarf brothers spent their time messing with the elf casting Discern Lies. They did it like this: The Bard brother, who had high charisma (and thus Bluff) would tell an outrageous story and be believed, and then the Fighter, who had Charisma as his dump stat, would confirm it, which would show as a lie. Sometimes they&#39;d switch off. Also, they wore identical clothing. Quoting OP: &quot;Dwarves love to make Elves suffer.&quot;<br><br>The Tiefling did his best to cast suspicion on OP. He actually got caught out in several lies, claiming that OP had been &quot;sneaking off&quot;.<br><br>The last party member didn&#39;t have much to say, had a solid alibi, and didn&#39;t know anything.<br><br></p>

            <p>There is a trial for the Royal Guard, whom everyone thinks killed the prince.<br><br>At this point, the Tiefling makes his first appearance, outright accusing OP of killing the prince. His justification? OP had hated them for being in love. Before that could get very far, the other party members pointed out that, on the surface, OP would not have a reason to kill the prince, because of his patriotism, had been friends with both lovers (he suspects that the DM was trying to get him into a threesome or in a relationship with another elf), and had a good alibi.<br><br>OP demands his rights as a diplomat (which his party are being treated as, although technically they weren&#39;t) to hold the guard, and keeps him in the cellar of the party&#39;s manor. <br><br>Here&#39;s how he held the Guard: First, OP blindfolded the prisoner and put his arms in an iron sleeve-like thing so that he couldn&#39;t get the blindfold off, and be able to use his power of teleportation (the Royal Guard was an Eladrin, which was a kind of elf that could teleport). He then constructed two Magic Circles against the Fey, one around the wall, and a secondary one in the room that the Guard was held in, as well as setting up an Eyes of Warning ritual (makes an almighty racket if someone considered an &#39;intruder&#39; steps over a designated line) in case the Tiefling got any ideas about trying to free the prisoner. <br><br>This is before the trial, and the Guard could not be allowed to testify, as it was his word against a gardener&#39;s about the fight, and the Guard&#39;s word would probably be believed, because Twu Wuv.</p>

The war has been incredible for the human nation (because the DM wanted to show the humans being greedy jerks), revitalizing the economy, patriotism, and all other such things, and OP was a patriotic human, who also appeared to be taking notes from Light Yagami from Death Note. <br><br>So, this is how it went. The OP disguised himself and the Half-Orc as the prince and his elvish lover, and went walking in the garden while the real prince and his lover were elsewhere. They made sure to be in sight of a gardener, and then had an argument. Tears were shed, angry words spoken, and finally (with the gardener as witness), the &quot;prince&quot; struck the &quot;elf&quot; across the face.<br><br>The DM went with this mostly because OP told her that what he was doing was part of a complicated scheme to get the Prince home incognito. <br><br>Then, the big part of the plan. There was a party that night, and OP made sure that everyone thought he was passed out drunk (really it was his familiar, who he disguised to look like him), disguised himself as a servant, and brought wine mixed with sleeping potion. While they were both asleep, he created a phantom warrior (who could attack like a real one), and killed the Prince (possible because the Prince was level 1). He then soaked the prince&#39;s lover&#39;s sword in blood.<br><br>At that point, he returned to his room and drunk himself asleep (to fool lie detection spells; he could truthfully say that he&#39;d drunk himself asleep that night, and have an alibi)</p>

            <p>Ok, here goes with my Permission Request.  Please be gentle with me.<br><br>* * *
<br><br><b>Agent Sean Bellman</b><br><br><b>Department:</b> DMS<br><br><b>Partner:</b> Agent Hild (at first.  I have a sort of story arc planned for my characters, so this will change.  Email me if you want spoilers.)<br><br><b>RC</b>: 4<br><br><b>Species:</b> Human.<br><br><b>Home Continuum:</b> World One.<br><br><b>Age:</b> 27<br><br><b>Hair:</b> Dark, curly, cropped short.<br><br><b>Eyes:</b> Brown.<br><br><b>History:</b> Sean worked as a reader for a small publishing company, vetting unsolicited manuscripts from the slush pile.  As most of them were, to put it bluntly, rubbish, he tended to get very angry and work out a lot of his frustration in the gym afterwards.  One day he finally snapped, ran through the offices screaming, beat up one of his colleagues, and locked himself in the companyâs toilets yelling, âIâm a potato! Iâm a potato!â<br><br>Finding a new job was hard, especially since his old employers refused to give him any references.  Then he saw the advert in the paper.  Someone was looking for employees who hated bad writing, were in good physical shape, and âcomplete sanity not required.â  He applied and got the job.<br><br><b>Personality:</b> Rather bitter and cynical.  He&#39;ll always be the one to see the worst in a situation, especially in a fic.  So naturally he gets teamed with more optimistic, easy-going partners - usually rookies who haven&#39;t been in the PPC long enough to lose their sense of wonder.<br><br>He still likes to work out to get rid of his stress, usually accompanied by loud heavy metal.  (He doesnât actually like heavy metal, but he finds itâs great for working out to.)  His current partner, Hild, is one of the few people who doesnât mind the smell of his sweat following a workout.<br><br><b>Likes:</b> Working out, cheesy old thrillers, MST3K, dogs, pasta.<br><br><b>Dislikes:</b> Being reminded of the potato incident, bland lager, raw tomatoes, people asking if he&#39;s Luxury&#39;s ex-boyfriend Sean, people asking if his name is anything to do with the Bellman in Jasper Ffordeâs novels.<br><br>* * *
<br><br><b>Agent Hild</b><br><br><b>Department: </b>DMS<br><br><b>Partner:</b> Sean Bellman (at first.  This will change as my story arc goes on.  Email me for spoilers.)<br><br><b>RC: </b>4<br><br><b>Race:</b> Human (Dunlending, but with some Rohirrim ancestry)<br><br><b>Home Continuum:</b> Arda.<br><br><b>Age:</b> 21<br><br><b>Hair:</b> Blonde, usually worn in a messy bun<br><br><b>Eyes:</b> Dark grey<br><br><b>History:</b> She&#39;s from a semi-fic blip, an unwritten Boromance in which she was a member of a group of Dunlending bandits who captured Boromir at Tharbad on his way to Imladris. Assigned to watch over Boromir while they planned to ransom him, Hild found herself getting to know him, and slowly starting to feel affection for him. She eventually helped him escape, giving her life to help him get away.<br><br>But since her fic was never written, she ended up slipping through a plothole, and ending up in HQ. She was cured of her borderline Sueness and trained as an agent. Her weapon skills from her bandit life meant she became an assassin in the DMS.<br><br><b>Personality:</b> She&#39;s optimistic, full of excitement and wonder about this new life, not having been in the PPC long enough to start getting cynical about it. Despite this, she&#39;s still a hardened, experienced warrior, and won&#39;t hesitate to fight someone if necessary.<br><br>One aspect of modern life that she&#39;s having trouble getting used to is hygiene. Coming from a semi-nomadic bandit tribe who washed once every few days in the river, she sometimes forgets that she&#39;s supposed to wash herself every day now.<br><br><b>Likes:</b> Boromir (although she strongly denies that heâs her lust object), trying new experiences, Baroque music, the smell of sweat.<br><br><b>Dislikes:</b> Heavy metal, being called âHildaâ, spicy food, people assuming that she speaks Elvish languages just because sheâs from Arda.<br><br>* * *
<br><br><b>Control Prompt: </b><i>One agent tells the other how they were recruited/We see both agents recruited.</i><br><br>âSo, youâve never told me, how did you come to join the PPC?â<br><br>Sean Bellmanâs favourite way of distracting himself while walking to the Cafeteria was by talking to his companion: in this case his partner, Agent Hild.<br><br>âOh, the usual way,â she replied.  âI fell through a plothole and landed in one of the corridors.â<br><br>Sean grinned.  âOnly in this place could that be considered âthe usual wayâ.â<br><br>âWell, my plothole was larger than most, if you want something unusual.  My author had never actually written my story, and very little was fixed.  I didnât know at the time, of course, but she actually thought she was doing me a favour by keeping it unwritten and flexible.â Somehow Hild managed to giggle and sigh at the same time. âHave you ever heard anything so silly?â<br><br>âI guess not.  So what happened?â<br><br>âWell, apparently she never quite decided whether the messengers with Boromirâs ransom demand would be sent to Imladris, Isengard, or direct to Minas Tirith, and what happened to them anyway.  Not that I knew anything about that.  The first I knew anything was wrong was on our flight from the bandit camp.  We overtook the messengers to Imladris, who were flickering in and out of existence.  I reached out to touch one, and fell into the space where he wasnât.â<br><br>She gestured around at the corridor, and continued.  âWhen I landed in HQ, I thought Iâd died and gone to Mandos.  I was disappointed that it wasnât as grand as Iâd expected.  I wondered if maybe that was just for elves, and humans got the plainer end of the Halls.  Then half a dozen or so agents ran in, grabbed me, and dragged me off.  And after Iâd been analysed and tested, they told me who I was.  And thatâs when I learned I was fictional.â<br><br>âMustâve been a nasty shock.â<br><br>âNot really, it explained all the strange inconsistencies in my life.  Everything seemed to make much more sense.  Maybe it wouldâve been different if Iâd been from a written story.  One that was complete and made senseâ  She shrugged, then continued.  âAnyway, I decided to stick around because I had nowhere else to go.  What about you?â<br><br>âMe?â<br><br>âYes.  How did you join?â<br><br>âOh, the usual way.â  Sean smiled.  âWell, what would be the usual way in most places.  Nothing as usual as yours, of course!â<br><br>âVery funny!â  She shoved him playfully.  âCome on, tell me more.â<br><br>âItâs really not that interesting.â<br><br>âCome on.  You know I love learning about your world.â<br><br>âWell, after I lost that job with the publishers - I told you about that, right?â<br><br>âYes.â<br><br>âOK, well, I was having trouble finding a new one.  One day, there were a couple of ads that looked promising.  It was either this, or be paid five pounds to move a piano from one room to another.â<br><br>Not surprisingly, she didnât get the joke.  âAnd you chose this one?â<br><br>âYeah.  The job ad was pretty vague, but I applied anyway.  Went for an interview, at a small office in south London.  I saw a pompous little guy named Rogers.  He asked me all sorts of strange questions, but wouldnât say what the job was about.  And the really weird thing is, when I left, I couldâve sworn the building was a couple of blocks away from where it had been when I entered.â<br><br>âKnowing this lot, Iâm not surprised.  Probably a final test or something.â<br><br>âYeah.  Anyway, I mustâve passed.  The next day, a portal appeared in my living room, and Rogers asked me to step through.  I didnât know what was going on, but went along with it anyway.  Curiosity, I guess.â<br><br>âAnd when you found out, you decided to stay?â<br><br>âYeah.  They wanted to put me in Bad Het because of my experience rejecting romance manuscripts, but Iâd had enough of that.  And besides, I still donât see why they need two departments.  Bad romance is bad romance, no matter whether it just happens to be het or slash.â<br><br>âOoooh!  Did someone mention slash?â  The new speaker was Agent Luxury.  She jumped up from her table and bounced over to them excitedly.  âThatâs my <i>fave </i>subject ever.â<br><br>Theyâd finally reached the Cafeteria.<br><br>* * *
<br><br><b>Random Prompt: </b><i>One or both agents realise they are beginning to lose enthusiasm for their favourite canon due to all the badfic.</i><br><br>I still donât believe it,â grumbled Sean, as the two agents stepped through the portal back into their RC.  âUpstairs gave us an Observer/Bobo PWP.â<br><br>âWell, they  <i>were </i>Replacement Sues, after all,â said Hild.  âThe Sorting Room probably thought assassins would deal with them better than badslashers.  Itâs like that <i>Hunger Games/Crying Game </i>crossover we had a couple of weeks ago.  The one where she couldnâtâve been the real Katniss because she had a ââ<br><br>âNo, itâs not that.â  Sean slumped into his chair.  âItâs just that fic.  I mean, how could someone call herself an MST3K fan and still write that?â<br><br>Hild walked over to the fridge and took out a couple of Bleepbeers.  âWant to tell me about it?â<br><br>âMST3K means a lot to me.â  Sean accepted the proffered drink.  âWhen I had that dead-end job with the publishers, sometime the only thing that got me through the day was imagining Mike and the Bots riffing the manuscripts.â  He took a long drink of his Bleepbeer, then continued.  âI still do it on missions sometimes, but I donât think I can manage that after this.â<br><br>âWhy not? You coped after that fic where the Sue tried to save Frank from Torgo.â<br><br>âThis was worse.  Much worse.

            <p>Oh...you were waiting for another PG?  Sorry about that, I&#39;ve been in tech since Thursday.  So, let&#39;s have a look.<br><br>I like the characters.  You seem to have put a lot of thought into them, which is always a plus.<br><br>Now the prompts, yes?<br><br>The control prompt is good.  I would like to point out that Bad Het is a division of Bad Slash, but that is a smallish thing.  The rest is pretty good, though somewhat lacking in description, as others have pointed out.<br><br>The random prompt is definitely a different tone from the control, which is good.  I like the solution they come up with in the end.  Totally against regulation, I&#39;m sure, but that&#39;s what makes it fun.<br><br>All in all, I like it.  You don&#39;t have a badfic yet, but I&#39;m not too worried about it since the writing is strong.<br><br>So, <b>Permission Granted</b>!<br><br>Congratulations.<br><br>-Phobos *Crawls back into a dark theatre*</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s the Random Prompt re-done with extra added narration.<br><br>* * *<br><br>âI still donât believe it,â grumbled Sean, as the two agents stepped through the portal back into their RC.  âUpstairs gave us an Observer/Bobo PWP.â<br><br>âWell, they  <i>were </i>Replacement Sues, after all,â said Hild.  âThe Sorting Room probably thought assassins would deal with them better than badslashers.  Itâs like that <i>Hunger Games/Crying Game </i>crossover we had a couple of weeks ago.  The one where she couldnâtâve been the real Katniss because she had a ââ<br><br>âNo, itâs not that.â  Sean slumped into his chair.  âItâs just that fic.  I mean, how could someone call herself an MST3K fan and still write that?â<br><br>Hild had never seen Sean like that before.  Normally after a particularly bad fic, he would take out his frustration on the punch bag hanging in the corner of the RC.  But this, this was different.<br><br>She walked over to the fridge and took out a couple of Bleepbeers.  âWant to tell me about it?â<br><br>âMST3K means a lot to me.â  Sean accepted the proffered drink.  âWhen I had that dead-end job with the publishers, sometime the only thing that got me through the day was imagining Mike and the Bots riffing the manuscripts.â  He took a long drink of his Bleepbeer, then continued.  âI still do it on missions sometimes, but I donât think I can manage that after this.â<br><br>âWhy not? You coped after that fic where the Sue tried to save Frank from Torgo.â<br><br>âThis was worse.  Much worse.  Now every time I think of MST, Iâll imagine Bobo with that big heart shaved into his hairy back, and the words âBrainâ and âGuyâ tattooed on his bright red buttocks.  No amount of Bleeprinâs gonna get an image like that out of my mind.â<br><br>âCould FicPsych help?â<br><br>âIâm not letting them mess around in my head!  I had enough of that back on World One.â<br><br>âWell, is there anything I can do?â<br><br>Sean managed a little smile.  âNo, but thanks for offering anyway.â  There was a brief, awkward pause, then Sean continued, âYouâll understand when it happens to you.  Not the shrinks.  Losing your love for your favourite canon after too much badfic.â<br><br>Hild thought about this for a moment.  âMaybe one day.  I donât know.  I donât think Iâve got a favourite yet,â she said.  âI mean, I know quite a few canons from basic training, of course.  But thatâs about all. â<br><br>âWhat about Middle-earth?â<br><br>âThatâs different.  That was my home.  You donât stop loving the land where you were born because of stuff that happened after you left.â<br><br>âGuess not.â<br><br>Another pause; the two agents continued drinking their Bleepbeers lost in thought.  Sean was staring down at the floor.  Hild wanted to go over to him and give him a big hug, but she knew that wouldn&#39;t help much.  Sean was <i>not </i>a touchy-feely person.<br><br>She turned her glance away from him, and found herself looking over towards the console.  <i>It&#39;s ridiculous, </i>she thought.  <i>With all this magical technology at our disposal, there must be something we can do to change things.  What if...</i><br><br>âHey, I have an idea.â  Hild broke the silence and leaned forward in her chair, a grin spreading wide across her face.  âCould we reopen the portal back into the beginning of the fic?â<br><br>âI donât know.  I donât think anyoneâs ever tried it before.  But why go back <i>there</i>?â<br><br>âWe get whatshisname, Cambot, on our side, get him to record everything, and play it back for Mike and friends to riff on afterwards.  That should help, right?  Now when think of it, youâll think of their riffs instead.â<br><br>Sean paused for a moment or two then said, âItâs probably impossible, and even if it isnât, it probably wonât work, and even if it does, itâll probably be against every rule in the book.  But what have we got to lose? Letâs give it a go.â<br><br>He sprang from his chair and dashed over to the console, with something of his old determination in his face again.<br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m sure the other PGs just haven&#39;t been on the board in the past day or so; they&#39;re sure to see it fairly soon. The fact that your characters are getting some positive feedback is probably indicative of the PG&#39;s possible decision!</p>

            <p>To tackle those in reverse order: I&#39;m not making a decision because I&#39;m the resident Tolkien geek - as you&#39;ve probably sussed - and I don&#39;t think I can objectively judge Hild. She&#39;s just way too far into my &#39;that&#39;s awesome&#39; band. If I were in a decision-making frame of mind, I&#39;d probably say yes - but I&#39;ll abdicate that responsibility to someone else.<br><br>And the comment: Kaitlyn&#39;s pointed out to me that your dialogue is superb, but your narration is virtually non-existent. And she made a suggestion:<br><br>Have you considered script format? You&#39;re practically writing in it anyway (&#39;Another pause; the two agents continued drinking their Bleepbeers lost in thought&#39; could be stuck into the present tense and square brackets or whatever and need no change at all), and it seems to be suited to your strengths while avoiding your confessed weaknesses/dislikes. And we&#39;ve never <i>had</i> script-format missions before - the Playscriptes take place entirely in HQ.<br><br>There&#39;s also the fact that it&#39;s the most common format for MSTs and actual MST3K fanfic, which you&#39;re very much into - so it could be something of a homage.<br><br>And just to demonstrate how close you are to it already, the opening of your Control Prompt:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>[A CORRIDOR in PPC HQ. <b>Sean Bellman</b> and <b>Hild</b> are walking towards the Cafeteria. Sean is engaging in his favourite method of distracting himself while navigating HQ - talking to his companion]<br><br><b>Sean:</b> So, youâve never told me, how did you come to join the PPC?<br><br><b>Hild:</b> Oh, the usual way. I fell through a plothole and landed in one of the corridors.<br><br>[Sean grins]<br><br><b>Sean:</b> Only in this place could that be considered âthe usual wayâ.<br><br><b>Hild:</b> Well, my plothole was larger than most, if you want something unusual. My author had never actually written my story, and very little was fixed. I didnât know at the time, of course, but she actually thought she was doing me a favour by keeping it unwritten and flexible.<br><br>[Somehow Hild manages to giggle and sigh at the same time]<br><br><b>Hild:</b> Have you ever heard anything so silly?<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I didn&#39;t have to invent or delete anything; that&#39;s how close it is to your existing style. (Of course, the exact formatting of the script would be your decision - this is just an example. But since you&#39;re not actually writing a screenplay, it could be as simple as this)<br><br>We think it&#39;s worth considering. And note how I&#39;m claiming partial ownership of an idea that was entirely my wife&#39;s. That&#39;s how good an idea I think it is.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Interesting idea.  I&#39;m not sure how well that would work for a mission to a normal, non-script fic.  It would have the side effect of putting a feeling of distance between the agents and the fic&#39;s narrated action, rather than placing them in the thick of events.<br><br>(Hmmm... Maybe a fic where the SPaG&#39;s so bad, the agents operate an emergency option on their RA to take them outside the narration, and they end up in script format as a result?  I just have to find a suitable fic and hope it doesn&#39;t drive <b>me </b>flamethrower-crazy.)<br><br>Ironically, my most recent stalled project is a scriptfic: a <i>Round the Horne/LOTR</i> crossover.  You&#39;ve inspired me to go back and have another go at that.<br></p>

            <p>(You may have noticed I&#39;m frequently of the opinion that questions can best be answered through story)<br><br>For this exercise, I&#39;ll be taking an excerpt from early in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1qbQw01fcZCAguT8JJFHmAMbB1i76dXmdtp0lWMXNfUw">Garden of Noncoty</a>, Narto and Lou&#39;s first mission.<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>The Words:</b> <i>Frodo Baggins had expected something different of where they were heading when he left the Shire. He thought that it would be like Lothlorien, the Elfish forest, aglow with perfection and light. This was like the place he had left, except...except he was going to stay.</i><br><br><b>Narto:</b> [growls] Okay, first off, Elfish? Isn&#39;t a word here. And secondly, it <i>should</i> be more like LÃ³rien, and a lot less like the Shire.<br><br>[Lou nods]<br><br><b>Lou:</b> Ah, Frodo, Frodo, you poor Hobbit. Headed for the Blessed Realm, ended up in North America.<br><br>[Gandalf walks up behind Frodo and places a hand on his shoulder]<br><br><b>Gandalf:</b> <i>Well, what do you think Frodo Baggins?</i><br><br><b>Narto:</b> What does he think Frodo Baggins?<br><br><b>Lou:</b> [speaking over Frodo] Mark it down as a missing comma.<br><br>[Frodo replies to Gandalf, but it is inaudible under Lou&#39;s comment]<br><br><b>Narto:</b> Not what he expected? Of course it&#39;s not what he expected.<br><br>[Narto glares at the ground, as if it has personally offended him... which is has, in a sense]<br><br>[Gandalf apparently grows bored with the Hobbit, turning back to watch the party leaving the ship]<br><br><b>Lou:</b> [mumbles a commentary as the party disembark] Elrond, Celeborn, Galadriel, and a bunch of other elves. Hmm. So where&#39;s Bilbo?<br><br><b>Narto:</b> And why is Celeborn there? He stayed in LÃ³rien.<br><br>[Lou gives Narto an approving look]<br><br><b>Lou:</b> Indeed he did. [she looks up at the Words, reading ahead] Narto, take a look at this, it&#39;ll be useful for your charge list.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>It&#39;s not perfect, because the speech assumes narration, so it has a slightly different structure to what you&#39;d use in script; also because the stage directions are equally taken from the mission. But you know what? It&#39;s not half bad.<br><br>I&#39;ve treated the badfic in three ways. For narrative description, making &#39;The Words&#39; a character - if it were actually staged, they&#39;d be printed on the screen or projected on the back wall. For narrative <i>actions</i> - paraphrased or directly stated - I&#39;ve used stage directions. And for speech, I&#39;ve added the characters from the fic as characters. Anything directly quoted from the badfic is in italics; my paraphrases are in straight text.<br><br>Yes, it would feel rather different to other PPC missions - so? First-person missions feel different to third-person ones. The &#39;mission&#39; in <a href="http://genericsurface.livejournal.com/4878.html">Generic Surface</a> feels different to any of the above. That&#39;s what different formats do.<br><br>Anyway, it&#39;s up to you, of course. I&#39;m just saying that it is a viable option.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: &#39;But how much of the badfic would I have to include? I don&#39;t want to script the whole thing!&#39; Then don&#39;t. Imagine it as a stage play, with our agents on the stage, and most of the &#39;action&#39; taking place out of sight. So mostly what we see is them commenting, with occasional glimpses of the actual fic - just like any other mission. ~hS)</p>

            <p>I think this is great! Hild came up with a really clever idea at the end of the second prompt, and the first one was pretty funny. You&#39;ve clearly been perfecting these two for a while now. Nice work, Pippa! (Also, Sean and Hild play off each other very well.

            <p>Ok, here goes with my Permission Request.  Please be gentle with me.<br><br>* * *
<br><br><b>Agent Sean Bellman</b><br><br><b>Department:</b> DMS<br><br><b>Partner:</b> Agent Hild (at first.  I have a sort of story arc planned for my characters, so this will change.  Email me if you want spoilers.)<br><br><b>RC</b>: 4<br><br><b>Species:</b> Human.<br><br><b>Home Continuum:</b> World One.<br><br><b>Age:</b> 27<br><br><b>Hair:</b> Dark, curly, cropped short.<br><br><b>Eyes:</b> Brown.<br><br><b>History:</b> Sean worked as a reader for a small publishing company, vetting unsolicited manuscripts from the slush pile.  As most of them were, to put it bluntly, rubbish, he tended to get very angry and work out a lot of his frustration in the gym afterwards.  One day he finally snapped, ran through the offices screaming, beat up one of his colleagues, and locked himself in the companyâs toilets yelling, âIâm a potato! Iâm a potato!â<br><br>Finding a new job was hard, especially since his old employers refused to give him any references.  Then he saw the advert in the paper.  Someone was looking for employees who hated bad writing, were in good physical shape, and âcomplete sanity not required.â  He applied and got the job.<br><br><b>Personality:</b> Rather bitter and cynical.  He&#39;ll always be the one to see the worst in a situation, especially in a fic.  So naturally he gets teamed with more optimistic, easy-going partners - usually rookies who haven&#39;t been in the PPC long enough to lose their sense of wonder.<br><br>He still likes to work out to get rid of his stress, usually accompanied by loud heavy metal.  (He doesnât actually like heavy metal, but he finds itâs great for working out to.)  His current partner, Hild, is one of the few people who doesnât mind the smell of his sweat following a workout.<br><br><b>Likes:</b> Working out, cheesy old thrillers, MST3K, dogs, pasta.<br><br><b>Dislikes:</b> Being reminded of the potato incident, bland lager, raw tomatoes, people asking if he&#39;s Luxury&#39;s ex-boyfriend Sean, people asking if his name is anything to do with the Bellman in Jasper Ffordeâs novels.<br><br>* * *
<br><br><b>Agent Hild</b><br><br><b>Department: </b>DMS<br><br><b>Partner:</b> Sean Bellman (at first.  This will change as my story arc goes on.  Email me for spoilers.)<br><br><b>RC: </b>4<br><br><b>Race:</b> Human (Dunlending, but with some Rohirrim ancestry)<br><br><b>Home Continuum:</b> Arda.<br><br><b>Age:</b> 21<br><br><b>Hair:</b> Blonde, usually worn in a messy bun<br><br><b>Eyes:</b> Dark grey<br><br><b>History:</b> She&#39;s from a semi-fic blip, an unwritten Boromance in which she was a member of a group of Dunlending bandits who captured Boromir at Tharbad on his way to Imladris. Assigned to watch over Boromir while they planned to ransom him, Hild found herself getting to know him, and slowly starting to feel affection for him. She eventually helped him escape, giving her life to help him get away.<br><br>But since her fic was never written, she ended up slipping through a plothole, and ending up in HQ. She was cured of her borderline Sueness and trained as an agent. Her weapon skills from her bandit life meant she became an assassin in the DMS.<br><br><b>Personality:</b> She&#39;s optimistic, full of excitement and wonder about this new life, not having been in the PPC long enough to start getting cynical about it. Despite this, she&#39;s still a hardened, experienced warrior, and won&#39;t hesitate to fight someone if necessary.<br><br>One aspect of modern life that she&#39;s having trouble getting used to is hygiene. Coming from a semi-nomadic bandit tribe who washed once every few days in the river, she sometimes forgets that she&#39;s supposed to wash herself every day now.<br><br><b>Likes:</b> Boromir (although she strongly denies that heâs her lust object), trying new experiences, Baroque music, the smell of sweat.<br><br><b>Dislikes:</b> Heavy metal, being called âHildaâ, spicy food, people assuming that she speaks Elvish languages just because sheâs from Arda.<br><br>* * *
<br><br><b>Control Prompt: </b><i>One agent tells the other how they were recruited/We see both agents recruited.</i><br><br>âSo, youâve never told me, how did you come to join the PPC?â<br><br>Sean Bellmanâs favourite way of distracting himself while walking to the Cafeteria was by talking to his companion: in this case his partner, Agent Hild.<br><br>âOh, the usual way,â she replied.  âI fell through a plothole and landed in one of the corridors.â<br><br>Sean grinned.  âOnly in this place could that be considered âthe usual wayâ.â<br><br>âWell, my plothole was larger than most, if you want something unusual.  My author had never actually written my story, and very little was fixed.  I didnât know at the time, of course, but she actually thought she was doing me a favour by keeping it unwritten and flexible.â Somehow Hild managed to giggle and sigh at the same time. âHave you ever heard anything so silly?â<br><br>âI guess not.  So what happened?â<br><br>âWell, apparently she never quite decided whether the messengers with Boromirâs ransom demand would be sent to Imladris, Isengard, or direct to Minas Tirith, and what happened to them anyway.  Not that I knew anything about that.  The first I knew anything was wrong was on our flight from the bandit camp.  We overtook the messengers to Imladris, who were flickering in and out of existence.  I reached out to touch one, and fell into the space where he wasnât.â<br><br>She gestured around at the corridor, and continued.  âWhen I landed in HQ, I thought Iâd died and gone to Mandos.  I was disappointed that it wasnât as grand as Iâd expected.  I wondered if maybe that was just for elves, and humans got the plainer end of the Halls.  Then half a dozen or so agents ran in, grabbed me, and dragged me off.  And after Iâd been analysed and tested, they told me who I was.  And thatâs when I learned I was fictional.â<br><br>âMustâve been a nasty shock.â<br><br>âNot really, it explained all the strange inconsistencies in my life.  Everything seemed to make much more sense.  Maybe it wouldâve been different if Iâd been from a written story.  One that was complete and made senseâ  She shrugged, then continued.  âAnyway, I decided to stick around because I had nowhere else to go.  What about you?â<br><br>âMe?â<br><br>âYes.  How did you join?â<br><br>âOh, the usual way.â  Sean smiled.  âWell, what would be the usual way in most places.  Nothing as usual as yours, of course!â<br><br>âVery funny!â  She shoved him playfully.  âCome on, tell me more.â<br><br>âItâs really not that interesting.â<br><br>âCome on.  You know I love learning about your world.â<br><br>âWell, after I lost that job with the publishers - I told you about that, right?â<br><br>âYes.â<br><br>âOK, well, I was having trouble finding a new one.  One day, there were a couple of ads that looked promising.  It was either this, or be paid five pounds to move a piano from one room to another.â<br><br>Not surprisingly, she didnât get the joke.  âAnd you chose this one?â<br><br>âYeah.  The job ad was pretty vague, but I applied anyway.  Went for an interview, at a small office in south London.  I saw a pompous little guy named Rogers.  He asked me all sorts of strange questions, but wouldnât say what the job was about.  And the really weird thing is, when I left, I couldâve sworn the building was a couple of blocks away from where it had been when I entered.â<br><br>âKnowing this lot, Iâm not surprised.  Probably a final test or something.â<br><br>âYeah.  Anyway, I mustâve passed.  The next day, a portal appeared in my living room, and Rogers asked me to step through.  I didnât know what was going on, but went along with it anyway.  Curiosity, I guess.â<br><br>âAnd when you found out, you decided to stay?â<br><br>âYeah.  They wanted to put me in Bad Het because of my experience rejecting romance manuscripts, but Iâd had enough of that.  And besides, I still donât see why they need two departments.  Bad romance is bad romance, no matter whether it just happens to be het or slash.â<br><br>âOoooh!  Did someone mention slash?â  The new speaker was Agent Luxury.  She jumped up from her table and bounced over to them excitedly.  âThatâs my <i>fave </i>subject ever.â<br><br>Theyâd finally reached the Cafeteria.<br><br>* * *

            <p>When are they good and when are they bad. Are there any particular Cships you like? I have always liked the pairing Joker&#39;s Daughterx X-23 (the teenage female clone of Wolverine, long story, comics are weird) J.D strikes my as always trying to keep a smile on her face, to find something to laugh about. While X-23 has had a very messed up life and has a very cynical attitude. They&#39;re complete opposites, yet have very shitty lives, so they both have common ground.</p>

I used to ship her with Cyborg, but after some thought, I realised he&#39;d be too reminiscent of Grue for her, considering [SPOILERS].<br><br><i>Black Widow (MCU Edition)-X-Captain Scarlet (Captain Scarlet)</i><br>I&#39;ve always seen Black Widow as someone who doesn&#39;t really date because people die on her; it&#39;s a fairly common trope for hardened badass female protagonists in any media, but particularly comics. What does she need? Someone equally badass and <i>LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KILL</i>. Enter the good Captain, a SPECTRUM agent par excellence who can and will survive anything the universe can throw at him. Hell, SPECTRUM even has a friggin&#39; helicarrier!

            <p>Was my reaction when I saw this post. <br><br>Favourite lines:<br><br><i>The man blinked. âLion? What lion?â</i><br><br><i>The man - MakalaurÃ« - grinned, his teeth white, his eyes dark. âMe.â</i><br><br>Susan calling herself &quot;Susan the Socialite&quot;.<br><br><i>âRelax,â Susan said, making sure of her grip. âItâs only a field point.â</i><br><br><i>The wound was oozing blood, and she considered the hem of her skirt for a long moment - but there was no point ruining good clothes.</i><br><br><i>âIf you want it in the simplest of terms - Iâm an elf. A very </i>old<i> elf.â</i><br><br><i>âThatâs two questions,â Susan pointed out, âand they will both have to wait. I need to support your arm.â</i><br><br><i>âWhy did you try to kill me? Youâre clearly not a bloodthirsty maniac.â<br>MakalaurÃ« gave her a tight smile. âI wouldnât count on that.&quot;</i><br><br><i>For a moment she stared in disbelief, then sat bolt upright. âHow did it get this late?â<br>âThe usual way, I imagine,â MakalaurÃ« said. âIs there a problem?â</i><br><br><i>âAre all Eldar this unpleasant?â she asked.<br>âOnly around mortals,â MakalaurÃ« replied cheerfully. âOr should I say, only around mortals who </i>shoot them in the leg<i>.â</i><br><br><i>âWhy couldnât you have broken your right shoulder?â Susan had demanded, as yet another hop went wrong and nearly dragged her down on top of him.<br>âBecause Iâm contrary.â</i><br><br><i>Susan felt her mouth drop open. âYou want to sleep </i>on top of<i> me?â she demanded.</i><br><br><i>âA jewel,â he said tersely. âI tried to claim it. Itâ¦ didnât like that.â</i><br>That, Maglor, is quite the understatement.<br><br><i>âNo,â Susan admitted, not opening her eyes. âItâs </i>annoying<i>.â</i><br>Her petulance is hilarious.<br><br><i>To the east lay home, and a fairly ridiculous level of inherited wealth. All her friends, her possessions, her entire life. To the west lay an immortal, conceited elf, exiled to the borders of civilisation, and - lest she forget - liable to wandering off with no warning. It should have been no contest.</i><br><br>-----<br><br>Oh, this was <i>perfect</i>. If I could, I probably would have quoted the entire thing, but I&#39;ll have to be satisfied by the frankly ridiculous amount of quotes I put here. As you can see, I enjoyed the snark immensely, and I love your characterisation of both of them, and the entire thing was so <i>wonderful</i> and not what I expected yet exactly what I expected at the same time, and the little detail that they didn&#39;t share their life stories but only the little things, becasue of <i>course</i> that&#39;s how it would go...<br><br>Oh, and I literally laughed aloud in delight when I read the ending. That was <i>perfect</i>.<br><br>(Please put it on FF.net so I can favourite it and have easy access? Please?)<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a very well-written story, and very enjoyable to read.  But I just plain don&#39;t get your interpretation of Maglor.  (I have the same problem with Agent Dafydd too.)  Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve not read much of HoME yet, so perhaps I haven&#39;t seen any of the bits that make Maglor a sympathetic character.  But in the Silm, he and Maedhros always strike me as being like those hypocritical cops from <i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy.</i><br><br>MÃDHROS:  &quot;Now listen up Eonwe!  And you&#39;d better listen good, because it&#39;s gonna be very intelligent, and thoughtful, and humane!&quot;<br><br>MAGLOR:  &quot;That&#39;s right!  We&#39;re not a couple of typical bloodthirsty thugs who go around committing genocidal Kinslayings and then boasting about it afterwards in seedy Hithlum bars!&quot;<br><br>MÃDRHROS:  &quot;No, we&#39;re a couple of sensitive and caring bloodthirsty thugs who go around committing genocidal Kinslayings and then agonise about it afterwards to our foster children!&quot;<br><br>MAGLOR:  &quot;And I write poems!&quot;<br><br>MÃDRHROS:  &quot;He writes them in crayon!&quot;<br><br>MAGLOR:  &quot;But I&#39;ve not any of them published yet, so I&#39;d better warn you, I&#39;m in a mean mood!&quot;<br><br>MÃDRHROS:  &quot;Yeah, a mean mood!  Hey, shall we Kinslay them again for a bit?&quot;<br><br>MAGLOR:  &quot;Yeah!  Why not!  Chaaarrrrge!&quot;<br><br>MÃDRHROS:  &quot;Chaaarrrrge!&quot;<br></p>

            <p>First up, this version of Maglor is significantly less sympathetic than Dafydd. He starts out trying to kill Susan outright, and only relents because he&#39;s seriously injured and he has the weapons. Oh, he&#39;s moderately charming, but so&#39;s a tiger. Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not going to bite you. Ultimately, yes, he leaves her alive - but after what&#39;s probably the longest conversation he&#39;s had with anyone (other than Tolkien and Shakespeare) for hundreds of years.<br><br>But leaving him aside, and despite the fact that your script version is hilarious, I&#39;m not convinced by your perspective on the eldest Feanorians. We know most about Maedhros, so let&#39;s look at him:<br><br>-Maedhros was friends with several of his relatives - notably Fingon. This friendship persisted <i>after</i> the first Kinslaying, so we can&#39;t peg it on &#39;hiding his true colours&#39;. There was clearly something worth liking.<br><br>-Maedhros was the only son of Feanor who stood aside from the burning of the ships at Losgar. Given that his maniac of a father was <i>right there</i>, that took a certain level of moral courage.<br><br>-Maedhros actually yielded the High Kingship to Fingolfin; yes, this was for political reasons, but I can&#39;t see most of his family doing the same (and I dread to imagine how Caranthir took it).<br><br>-Unlike certain of his brothers, Maedhros was committed to taking out Morgoth. He stayed on the defensive line after the Bragollach - unlike Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur, who ran as far as they could possibly get - and helped plan the next assault. It was only after the disaster of the Nirnaeth and the complete collapse of any hope of taking out the Dark Lord that he allowed the Second and Third Kinslayings.<br><br>-Maedhros, with Maglor, rescued Elrond and Elros - and kept them alive and safe throughout the War of Wrath - and, judging by the way the half-elven turned out, raised them pretty well.<br><br>And ultimately, yes, Maedhros was the one who decided to take one last stab at the Silmarils. It was a stupid idea. <i>Maglor</i> said it was a stupid idea, which says a lot about him. But he didn&#39;t exactly do it willingly. Maedhros&#39; entire outlook is based on the fact that they swore not just by the Valar (who could release them from their oath) but by <i>the Name of Iluvatar</i>. The only other use of that Name we know of is in Elven marriage ceremonies - you know, the marriages that are unbreakable while the world lasts. To Maedhros, this wasn&#39;t just &#39;hey, let&#39;s get some shiny rocks&#39; - it was &#39;if we do not (try to) fulfil this Oath, there is a very real chance our souls will be forfeit&#39;.<br><br>Was he a nice person? No - he was a son of Feanor, and everything that entails. But he was the one who <i>tried</i> to be nice.<br><br>As to Maglor, well, he was a harper, of course - wrote a very famous lament about the Fall of the Noldor. But beyond that, he was rather weak-willed. He stood by his father when they burnt the ships, and when the High Kingship fell on his shoulders after Maedhros&#39; capture, he didn&#39;t even <i>try</i> to rescue his brother. And ultimately, he was persuaded by Maedhros to go along with the final theft.<br><br>But he doesn&#39;t come across as a <i>bad</i> person. There&#39;s a comment somewhere that of all the Feanorians, Maglor was the most like his father - with respect to the non-insane parts (the most Feanoresque nutter was Curufin, who&#39;s actually named after him). Which means he was viewed as the successor not to the Kinslayer, but to the elf who made the Silmarils. Sort of explains why his music was so highly-regarded, yes?<br><br>And on top of <i>all</i> that, there&#39;s the fact that - unlike Celegorm, Caranthir, <i>and</i> Curufin - neither Maedhros nor Maglor ever displayed any hostility towards mortals. I&#39;m sure they had as much disdain as you could ask for... but Caranthir left the Haladin to die in order to get an edge in negotiations, and Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur wanted to cut Beren loose without any aid whatsoever. Maedhros and Maglor accepted the service and fealty of Uldor and Bor, and fought alongside them in the Nirnaeth - which didn&#39;t turn out too well, all things considered, but that wasn&#39;t their fault.<br><br>And on top of all <i>that</i> - Maglor&#39;s the one who never went home.<br><br><i>--he who harps upon the far<br>forgotten beaches and dark shores<br>where western foam for ever roars:<br>Maglor, whose voice is like the sea.</i><br><br>That, ultimately, is why he&#39;s a sympathetic character - because I sympathise with him.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...especially the full explanation of why it mattered so much that the Oath was in the name of Iluvatar.  (That was never really very clear in the published Silm.)<br><br>I agree that M&amp;M were the least worst of a very bad bunch, at the start of the story anyway.  OTOH that&#39;s really saying very much, is it?  (And I&#39;m not sure why you mention Maglor being a harper.

            <p>Why is Maglor being a harper relevant? Well, mostly it&#39;s not, I was just trying to list everything we knew. But you could look at the fact that his only named song is a lament entitled &#39;The Fall of the Noldor&#39;, which is partly about the First Kinslaying. If nothing else, it shows that he had some regrets - and wasn&#39;t afraid to air them to the world.<br><br>Points two and three are things I thought of a bit later, so:<br><br>2/ The view of the Feanorians as bloodthirsty maniacs who go a&#39;kinslaying at the drop of a hat is <s>accurate</s> possibly overly simplistic. If we ignore Cel&#39;n&#39;Cur&#39;s despicable behaviour in Nargothrond (which is at least a kinslaying-by-proxy), there are only <i>three</i> incidents. Heck, even if we include both Nargothrond and Losgar (where the burning of the ships led directly to the deaths on the Grinding Ice) there&#39;s only five - in over <i>six hundred years</i>.<br><br>And they&#39;re pretty spaced out. Alqualonde was about twenty years before Losgar, according to Tolkien. Nargothrond was ten years after the Bragollach - which makes it <i>four hundred and sixty-six</i> years after the Rising of the Sun.  Doriath was destroyed forty years after <i>that</i>, and then there was another <i>thirty-two</i> years before the Sons of Feanor attacked the Havens of Sirion.<br><br>My point is that the <i>minimum</i> time the Feanorians went between bouts of murdering was twenty years. That&#39;s... a very long time for people viewed as serial killers, and they managed nearly five <i>hundred</i> years without any Kinslaying at all. They were clearly able to keep a lid on their tempers most of the time.<br><br>3/ I also hadn&#39;t realised this: the Kinslayings were <i>not</i> the actions of a murderous family. They were actually national acts of warfare. We don&#39;t normally think of the Houses of the Eldar as nations - but that&#39;s what they were. So, if you will, it was the Kingdom of Feanor which attacked the Kingdom of Alqualonde - not just some elf with a sword.<br><br>Equally, though the Silmarillion just states &#39;the sons of Feanor&#39; were the perpetrators of the other two Kinslayings - it also says &#39;the sons of Feanor&#39; defended the eastern marches. Do we imagine Maglor held his Gap all by himself? That Maedhros was the only elf in Himring? Of course not. So why do we all - including me - picture just them attacking Doriath and Sirion?<br><br>Rather than seeing the Second Kinslaying as a massacre, picture it for a moment as a culmination of long tensions between two neighbouring countries. The Kingdom of Doriath had banned all Feanorian citizens from entering its borders, and had actually forbidden their native language from being spoken - even in their <i>own</i> country. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Feanor was guarding Doriath from the terrible threat of Morgoth - and getting nothing in return, nor even any reinforcements. In fact, every nation in Beleriand was behind massive natural or supernatural defences - except the Kingdom of Feanor, which was way out in the open.<br><br>And there <i>were</i> tensions. A Feanorian ally (Aredhel) was turned away from Doriath&#39;s borders - despite the fact that her alternative was facing a giant-spider-infested valley. A vassal of Doriath&#39;s king came to Nargothrond - where two of the kingdom&#39;s leaders were living at the time on a diplomatic mission - to try and rally support for a plan to steal the Kingdom of Feanor&#39;s previously-stolen Crown Jewels - the ones they&#39;d been trying to get back for literally centuries - so that he could hand them over to Doriath. When the princes quite rightly refused to help - and persuaded their allies in Nargothrond to stand with them - they were painted as villains. Later, the Crown Princess of Doriath came along, stole their extremely valuable dog - and later one of their horses, and an absolutely unique knife - and went on to continue the crown jewel theft. Of <i>course</i> there was never any question that they&#39;d hand it back to the Kingdom of Feanor.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Doriath had utterly failed to offer <i>any</i> assistance in the desperate war against Morgoth - the one which was defending more of <i>their</i> people than it was the Feanorians&#39;. King Maedhros doubtless sent several increasingly angry letters - except, oh yeah, he couldn&#39;t, because his people weren&#39;t allowed across the border.<br><br>Then the King of Doriath died squabbling over <i>the Kingdom of Feanor&#39;s crown jewels</i>, and his successor... still refused to even <i>consider</i> returning their property, or joining them in the now nearly non-existent defensive line. With support crumbling at home - King Maedhros&#39; disasterous &#39;final battle&#39; had left the entire kingdom on the run - was it any wonder the political leadership decided they needed &#39;a short, victorious war&#39; to up everyone&#39;s spirits?<br><br>And it <i>was</i> victorious - the first victory for the Kingdom of Feanor in nearly a hundred years. Except the last remnants of the Doriathrin army managed to retreat, taking - oh, <i>naturally</i> - the Feanorian crown jewel which all this was about. So yes, they followed, they rebuilt their forces (as much as they could), and when they saw an opening - they struck.<br><br>Am I saying they were <i>nice</i>? No, absolutely not! The thought processes and course of action I&#39;ve just described are the actions of a fundamentally misguided nation. But... imagine instead of elves, all this took place in Medieval Germany. In <i>that</i> setting, we&#39;d see the Kingdom of Feanor&#39;s actions as fairly normal. The only reason we find them so horrifying in the Silm is that it&#39;s an elven book - and the Eldar were utterly appalled by the notion of Eldar killing Eldar. Humans... don&#39;t have that hangup. Not to nearly the same extent.<br><br>hS says lots of words</p>

            <p>And Book!Susan <i>is</i> an archer. She received two presents from Father Christmas - her famous horn, and a bow and arrow. She doesn&#39;t <i>use</i> it much, but it&#39;s there. Similarly, Lucy gets her cordial paired with a dagger (and Peter gets a shield to go with his sword).
