            <p>Is there a thread for this already? If not, I think this should suffice <sup>_<sup><br><br>I&#39;m</sup></sup> pretty sure everyone in the Pokemon fandom and their Pikachu knows about ORAS nowadays. I want to play it as soon as I get a 3DS! So here&#39;s my general question: What do you Poke-fans like the most about what we know so far? Gym Leaders? Mega Evolutions? Other plot details?</p>

            <p>Looking forward to the new Mega&#39;s, should be interesting to see what effect they have on the metagame and what tier they&#39;ll be in. <br><br>When I get the game (and a 3DS, I still lack one of those) I&#39;ll probably go for either Mudkip or Treecko, if Mega-Swampert has more bulk than normal Swampert then it&#39;ll be amazing, and if Mega-Sceptile has more power and speed, that&#39;ll be good too. <br><br>The thing I&#39;m most looking forward to though is moves no longer being physical/special based on type, I now it&#39;s been around since Gen 4, but to finally get it in Hoenn (my most played region) will be brilliant. <br><br>Storme Hawk<br></p>

            <p>That&#39;s probably what drove me the most nuts about generation three. <br><br>I used to only like the Treecko line, but I got stuck with Mudkip on my Sapphire run and it kind of grew on me... Still not too much of a fan of Torchic, though. Sorry.</p>

            <p>Normally I&#39;d say play from the beginning, however another &#39;good&#39; starting point seems to be Black/White, one of my favorite things about Black was that it was in some way a re-invention of Pokemon yet it still contained enough of the old stuff for gamers from the previous Gens to enjoy. So grab a DS (the originals should be fairly cheap by now and they&#39;re very durable. Mine&#39;s lasted me since they came out, and despite a shorter battery life it&#39;s still got a few more years in it yet) and get Black or White. That&#39;s my advice if you want to get into Pokemon anyway. </p>

            <p>Well, I didn&#39;t know about it, so thanks for informing me!<br><br>Having looked it up, I&#39;ve got mixed feelings on the plot.  The more recent games have had very complex and intriguing villains, whereas I think Ruby and Sapphire were about the weakest, plot-wise.  I&#39;d like it if they gave them a little more depth, but I&#39;m not sure how far you can go with their motivation.<br><br>I will confess to also having very mixed feelings about the use of Mega Evolution.  Torchic is just so adorable, and its evolved forms are kind of weird-looking.  Originally, I never let mine evolve, but with Mega Evolution, there&#39;ll be even more pressure to let it evolve.<br><br>Also, Sableye is broken enough already without a Mega Evolution.</p>

            <p>Happy to help :)<br><br>Design-wise, I&#39;m personally spazzing out over Mega Sceptile, because FINALLY WE GET A GRASS/DRAGON TYPE AND IT BREAKS OFF ITS TAIL IN BATTLE LIKE REAL GECKOS DO WITH THEIR TAILS ASDFDSAFDSAFDSAF *The bird continues his bout of excited screeching for another full minute.*<br><br>Anyway, not too keen on the rest of the ORAS Megas, though Mega Metagross looks pretty badass. I&#39;m holding out on Mega Swellow myself, though...<br><br>The rest gets a &quot;meh&quot; response from me so far. I&#39;m all for Primal Groudon/Kyogre, though, it would be interesting to see the history of Hoenn fleshed out.</p>

            <p>Well, what did you think this message was gonna be? :D<br><br>Basically, I&#39;m an aspiring artist and fiction writer, and I just recently gained interest in PPC (i.e. I just started binging on it today XD). I really love a lot of your stories, as I&#39;ve just recently discovered how entertaining it is to go around sporking badfic and murdering bad OCs. I used to be active on deviantART but I left for personal reasons, and I&#39;m mostly on Tumblr now. All that said, I would like to contribute with some of my own characters, stories, and gruesome fic butchering. Now if only I can do that without stumbling over my own feet and making an ass of myself.<br><br>Soooo... hello? *waves nervously*</p>

            <p>I already have some characters lined up for use as Agents, and I&#39;ve already read the Permission article on the PPC wiki... I&#39;m aware that I&#39;ll likely hang out for several weeks before actually setting up any permission requests for them, but may I ask if I can create their bios and writing samples (from the 36 Prompts) at this time?

            <p>I&#39;m honestly rather self-conscious about being caught (especially by someone on the other end of a board posting terminal), so I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to decline.

            <p>Welcome! Since nobody else did that yet, I&#39;ll point you toward the important trio of Constitution, Wiki and Original Series.<br>That said, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Murder">the PPC does <b>not</b> murder anybody.</a> It assassinates Sues.

            <p>Here, have some candy. It&#39;s not poisoned or anything.<br>Skarmory... tells me that you&#39;re a fellow Pokйmon fan (I hope). Anything else you&#39;re really into? (If you have a Nintendo 3DS, get Fire Emblem: Awakening NOW!)<br>And there&#39;s really nothing more cathartic than watching a Mary Sue get what&#39;s coming to her. Or writing it, of course, but I can&#39;t confirm that personally.<br>I imagine hS will come along shortly to explain whatever he&#39;s changed Permission to this week, but basically they don&#39;t just let anyone write this stuff. It takes months, if not YEARS, of intensive training...<br>...nah, just kidding. Read stories, read the wiki, then come back and show everyone what you&#39;ve got. And have fun.<br><br>(No, seriously, that candy&#39;s not poisoned. Nor have I magically infected it with mummy rot, because why would I want to scare the newbie?)</p>

            <p>Sweet Celestia&#39;s mane, how could I have forgotten to include My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic among my listed fandoms?! My brother and I love that series and we&#39;ve been planning to catch up on the entirety of Season 4 (we missed most of it due to matters in college).<br><br>So on that note, I&#39;d also be interested in testing out an OC I made for MLP as well in the future with the help of the PPC!

Other fandoms I&#39;ve joined or otherwise dabbled in include The Incredibles, Jurassic Park, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Danny Phantom, Ben 10, Godzilla, The Legend of Zelda, Kid Icarus, Rise of the Brave Tangled Dragons and all related movies thereof, and most recently The Lego Movie.

            <p>So we&#39;re about five months out from the release of <i>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</i>. With the usual caveat that I&#39;m going to be wildly annoyed by the many ways PJ will undoubtedly break the canon, I&#39;m looking forward to it - though I&#39;m also a bit sad (again!) that this December will be our last trip to Middle-earth. On the other hand, <i>next</i> December, the EE should be out... six-film marathon, anyone? (Or maybe eight, if we include the two award-winning fan-films)<br><br>So the film&#39;s coming up, but as far as I&#39;m aware, we still don&#39;t even have a trailer! :O That must mean it&#39;s time for wild speculation to fill the gap. So, here&#39;s what I think we could see in <i>H:B5A</i>:<br><br>-The majority of the film will be the Battle of the Five Armies itself.<br>--To make it more exciting, Smaug will somehow not die until the battle happens. Or he&#39;ll come back.<br><br>-The B5A will take place simultaneously with the assault on Dol Guldur.<br>--This may require Gandalf to teleport.<br><br>-In a concerted effort to make the later films utterly impossible, Sauron will sense Bilbo&#39;s use of the Ring.<br>--In fact, here&#39;s a concrete prediction for you: on sensing the Ring at Erebor, &#39;the Necromancer&#39; will resurrect Smaug to have him try and steal it.<br>---Following which, Bilbo will (re)kill Smaug directly.<br><br>-Some of the dwarves who are supposed to live will die.<br><br>-Another solid prediction: Tauriel will die, probably at Kili&#39;s side, probably while Legolas fails to save her.<br><br>-Bard will continue to look disturbingly like Will Turner.<br><br>-Bilbo will not get knocked unconscious for most of the B5A, but will run around killing things.<br><br>-Azog will duel Thorin; they&#39;ll probably kill each other.<br><br>-Bolg will continue to be a non-entity. He&#39;ll probably be killed by Legolas/Tauriel/Kili.<br><br>-Physics will yet again be defied for &#39;comedic&#39; purposes.<br><br>-That Moth.<br><br>-Gollum will make an appearance.<br><br>-Galadriel will either put on her &#39;all shall love me and despair&#39; face, or not participate at all in the fighting at Dol Guldur. No middle ground.<br><br>-To lead in to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_Mordor">this game</a>, we will see Sauron fleeing/retreating to a timeline-shatteringly green-and-pleasant Mordor.<br><br>-We will end where we started: with Bilbo and Frodo, around the beginning of <i>Fellowship</i>.<br><br>And things I would love to see, but doubt we will:<br><br>-Galadriel wielding a sword. Seriously, give me this.<br><br>-The Necromancer trying his Annatar face on.<br><br>-&#39;The Eagles are coming!&#39; as a genuinely fantastic moment.<br><br>-Radagast taking up the role of the lesser Power he is.<br><br>-Saruman being a ridiculously powerful wizard.<br>--In fact, I want to see the entire White Council in their full might - three Ainur uncloaked, the most valiant lady of the Noldor, the Herald of Gil-Galad... and is it too much to expect cameos from Celeborn the Wise and Cirdan the Shipwright? (Ans: probably)<br>--Seriously, how cool would it be to see a publicity shot of the three Istari surrounded by auras of power, flanked by the four highest and noblest elves in Middle earth in full battle away? Please, PJ, give me that!<br><br>Ahem. Think I got a little carried away, there. So, c&#39;m on, I can&#39;t be the only one waiting for this...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;-The B5A will take place simultaneously with the assault on Dol Guldur.<br>--This may require Gandalf to teleport.&quot;<br><br>I started both laughing and shaking my head here. PJ&#39;s recurring problem with the Hobbit is that he has no sense of scale whatsoever.<br><br>&quot;-The majority of the film will be the Battle of the Five Armies itself.&quot;<br><br>I dunno, PJ loves wandering in caves and there will still be Smaug&#39;s assault on Lake Town for the first eh, twenty minutes. We need to get Bard and co. up to the lonely mountain, but PJ thinks that&#39;s a day&#39;s hike, so it won&#39;t take any screentime. I guarantee no wandering around with the Arkenstone, but maybe Thorin being a jerk about it because the Arkenstone is apparently as addictive and irrationality-making to his line as a Silmaril is to a Feanorian.<br><br>&quot;-Some of the dwarves who are supposed to live will die.<br><br>-Another solid prediction: Tauriel will die, probably at Kili&#39;s side, probably while Legolas fails to save her.&quot;<br><br>Not before there&#39;s another showdown with Thorin and Azog, though. That will happen first.<br><br>&quot;-Bard will continue to look disturbingly like Will Turner.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;d managed not to see that yet. Now I can&#39;t unsee it.<br><br>&quot;-Bilbo will not get knocked unconscious for most of the B5A, but will run around killing things.&quot;<br><br>Pretty much guaranteed. He may still be knocked out though... at like the end of the battle or something.<br><br>Things I would love to see: Galadriel with a sword would be awesome, but they probably won&#39;t have her show up if Tauriel&#39;s there. While I would love for them to even battle <i>near</i> each other, I&#39;m pretty sure these movies can&#39;t pass the Bedschel test unless there&#39;s a child involved. (I do love Bard&#39;s kids, though.) She&#39;d be at Dol Gildur, probably.<br><br>Any action or even group sequence in which I can pick out more than 6 of 13 dwarves and remember which name goes to which face. (Bombur, Thorin, Fili, Kili, Dwalin and Balin are the only ones whose faces I can identify right away: I need a lineup for the other seven, which isn&#39;t good when we&#39;re two movies in already. I did better with the random extracanonical Rhorrim in the last trilogy.)<br><br>I agree with you on Sauruman: he needs to be shown earning his keep on the white council. He also needs to stop hitting us over the head with unnecessary &quot;foreshadowing&quot; that he&#39;s Omg!evil! because 1) WE ALREADY KNOW 2)Galadriel and Gandalf are not that dense, even if they&#39;re busy playing with their random telepathy, 3) PJ does remember that 60 years pass between this and Fellowship, right?<br></p>

It&#39;s actually quite shocking when the author spells a word correctly. I definitely know what fic I&#39;m claiming when I get permission.<br><br>The author claims she has not actually <del>read</del> watched Homestuck, but I&#39;m just wondering how her autocorrect didn&#39;t interfere.

The actual text of the story is better spelled, but contains cartoonishly-abusive!Dursleys, Harry being renamed Hadrian (which sounds even less like an Avatarverse name than Harry), and some of the jerkiest scene changes ever within the first two chapters.  Other notable occurrences are Toph being used as little more than an accessory and what might be the first ever Hufflepuff!Stu.</p>

            <p>OK, that first one doesn&#39;t have nearly enough hilarious malapropisms to be compared to the Most Comedic &quot;My Immortal&quot;.<br>That aside, it&#39;s pretty bad. If there&#39;s a single word of multiple syllables in that mess that&#39;s spelled correctly, I can&#39;t find it.<br>The second one has a lot of exclamation marks, doesn&#39;t it?

            <p>The author figures out how to use paragraphs in chapter four - then promptly forgets. That&#39;s about two chapters after everyone goes gothic and starts dressing in black and grey (Because that&#39;s such a huge change from the way those particular characters dressed before!)<br><br>The first one really gave me a laugh when there was an <del>explosion</del> ASSPLOSSIN for the sole purpose of <del>killing Aradia</del> making Sollux single.

            <p>A Red Herring is something totally unrelated.

            <p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s technically missionable, since it&#39;s mostly some kind of original story (Slenderman may or may not make an appearance, but honestly it&#39;s so vague I can&#39;t tell).  However, I would very much like to demonstrate to the Sue what a Pure (Were)Wolf really is.  I don&#39;t play that much Werewolf, but I&#39;m pretty sure the Predator Kings would be happy to eat her.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got an idea for a potential agent, but it&#39;s kind of different, and I&#39;m not entirely sure it works.  What I&#39;m basically looking for is someone to do a Bad Idea Check and say &quot;No, that&#39;s really dumb&quot; if it is, in fact, really dumb.<br><br>The character, Aaron Hunter, is basically Eren from Attack on Titan as a Fallout 3 character.  I kind of keep meaning to write a story about it, but I can&#39;t decide if I want to make him the Lone Wanderer or a Wasteland native whose hometown was under constant attack from Super Mutants.  The former allows for emphasis of the thematic parallels, but the latter allows for the appearance of other AoT characters (mostly Mikasa).  As a side effect, Agent!Aaron has two sets of memories.<br><br>As far as his PPC counterpart goes, he&#39;s basically a generic Brotherhood of Steel recruit in terms of ability.  The AoT connection is mostly there for the wacky hijinks angle; he&#39;s not really aware of it, but I can see it causing some amusing incidents when he gets missions from that continuum. Like a case of mistaken identity if he loses his cloak, or being forced to replace Eren by a Sue who consistently misspells the name, or trying to transform by biting his hand and being extremely embarrassed when absolutely nothing happens.<br><br>My main concern is that with the AoT connection, he&#39;s a borderline Stu, but without it, he&#39;s either not terribly interesting or a canon character.  Is it okay?  Or should I scrap the idea?</p>

            <p>Figured I&#39;d add a writing sample, to give anyone reading more of an idea of the kind of things I have in mind.<br><br>Unfortunately for Aaron, the Laws of Narrative Comedy had a better sense of canon than the fic itself did.  As he activated the MMD, his footing slipped and he turned slightly.  Before he had time realize what was happening, he was flipped over, banging his head painfully against the ground, and end up dangling upside down.  &quot;What the hell?&quot; he cried, trying to right himself.  &quot;That&#39;s not supposed to be possible!

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Hi there! Since I have a few minutes, I&#39;ll take a look at this. As a PG, I look for five things: activity in the community, understanding of the PPC, interesting characters, writing ability, and spelling-punctuation-grammar. So let&#39;s take a look.<br><br>Activity: Well, I recognise your name, and don&#39;t have an immediate &#39;hey, she&#39;s that annoying one&#39; reaction, so I&#39;ll tick that one off straight away. ;)<br><br>-SPG: Your spelling looks okay to me - I&#39;m sure there are mistakes (everyone has those), but nothing&#39;s popping out. Grammar too, though there are some slightly strange phrases - &#39;When they had visited the PPC the last time&#39; would feel more natural as &#39;the last time they [had] visited the PPC&#39;. But in general, I&#39;ll pass that.<br><br>Punctuation you&#39;ve got a few problems with. You start off with a load of full stops with no spaces after them - you can follow a full stop with one or two spaces, but not none. You also have a lot of missing commas, such as:<br><br>*&#39;However&gt;&gt;&gt;,*&#39;As an added note&gt;&gt;&gt;,*&#39;She could see that it was just so precious and wonderful&gt;&gt;&gt;,<br>And more, but I&#39;m not going to list every single one. As a rule, if you&#39;d pause there while speaking, it needs a comma. &#39;Well, there&#39;s his answer&#39;, because out loud, you&#39;d stop after &#39;well&#39;, if only briefly.<br><br>You also have a habit of ending quoted speech with a full-stop-and-capital. When the next words outside the quote are a dialogue tag, that should be a comma-and-lower-case. An example:<br><br>*&#39;“Hurry up.” She whipered urgently.&#39; should be &#39;&quot;Hurry up,&quot; she whispered urgently.&#39;<br><br>Of course, you <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> do this where the next words aren&#39;t a dialogue tag. You didn&#39;t, I&#39;m just making the note.<br><br>You have one instance of a missing apostrophe (actually, &#39;6:00 o clock in the morning&#39; is entirely strange - it should read either &#39;6:00 in the morning&#39; or, more naturally, &#39;six o&#39;clock in the morning&#39;. Or &#39;6 am&#39; if you really want. Oh, and PPC time is HQ Standard Time, or HST), and a couple of split words or lost hyphens (&#39;green dresses under over sized lab coats&#39; can either be &#39;oversized&#39; or &#39;over-sized&#39;, though the former is probably preferable in that case), but in general, apart from the dialogue endings and the commas, pretty good.<br><br>Oh, you also have an exclamation point in narration. I&#39;d normally condemn it outright, but it&#39;s a pseudo-thought from Murder, so... dunno. It&#39;s generally discouraged, anyway.<br><br>Understanding of the PPC: Well, it&#39;s... hard to tell, really. Nothing in the story after Seyche&#39;s first line is really anything to do with the PPC; if you remove &#39;PPC time&#39;, the whole story could take place in any research lab in the multiverse. You don&#39;t say anything that indicates you <i>don&#39;t</i> understand the PPC, and the things you do describe fit, but... there&#39;s not a lot to go on. (Oh, you said &#39;Division of Mary Sues&#39; where you meant &#39;Department&#39;)<br><br>Character: I have no quarrel with the concept of either of your characters. Zombie survivor with violent reactions is reasonable enough, and the idea of being immortal as long as the Seychelles endure is nice enough (though I wonder what you&#39;ll do if they ever break up...?). As to specifics...<br><br>I&#39;ll take Seyche first: you don&#39;t describe her personality in the bio, just her physical characteristics. She comes across as fairly pragmatic in the story... how close is that to what you&#39;re planning?<br><br>Murder: ... well, I&#39;ll push the easy one first - you say he reacts violently to being startled, and doesn&#39;t like to be surprised, but what you <i>show</i> is him jumping in a non-violent manner after being startled, and not being at all annoyed by Seyche&#39;s random screaming. He seems to be more on the &#39;must protect Seyche&#39; thing than what you wrote - which is also fine as a zombie survivor, but... yeah, doesn&#39;t match the profile.<br><br>But, bigger problem: you need to show us his actions. Take a look at this:<br><br>&#39;Murder sat up a little in his chair and adjusted his glasses. [...] Seyche didn’t seem to share his eagerness. She just nodded once to show that she understood the gestures&#39;<br><br><i>What</i> gestures? Sitting up and adjusting his glasses? Because that&#39;s all you&#39;ve shown us. If you had a character with a voice and never actually wrote out their lines, you&#39;d notice immediately that there was something wrong; this is the same thing.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying you should describe his gestures in great detail, but... well, what are we talking about, here? Sign language? A simple &#39;Murder&#39;s hands moved rapidly in reply, conveying his disappointment. It had taken ages...&#39; would work. But not saying anything comes across very strangely.<br><br>(Also, why does he use gestures no-one understands? Why not pick one of the standard sign languages, at least? A language ain&#39;t much good if you&#39;re the only one who speaks it)<br><br>Writing in general: I quite like the style of this story. Murder&#39;s pseudo-thoughts make it stand out, you play around with the &#39;tension&#39; of the duck quite well, and you keep the characters physically in the space, rather than letting them turn into talking heads. So okay, sure. (Can you tell this is the one I have difficulty with? Me not flagging up problems = good)<br><br>One final point...<br><br>Procedure: you haven&#39;t exactly hit all the points we ask for in a Permission Request, here. Now, those points are designed to make things easier, not as an arbitrary barrier, so don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to say no on that basis. You haven&#39;t linked a badfic, but I get the impression you&#39;re not planning on taking them into a solo mission right now? So that can be written out. But you also only have one writing sample, and one that leaves me with questions about your PPC knowledge besides...<br><br>Essentially, I have three concerns about your writing.<br><br>*First, punctuation, which I&#39;ve covered in detail above.<br>*Second, PPC knowledge, whether you have any or not, which isn&#39;t particularly clear from this.<br>*Third, Agent Murder: showing his actions, and deciding whether he&#39;s violent or not.<br><br>And fortunately, I can make one request to answer all of those:<br><br>-Please write a second sample. Your carefully-selected prompt is &#39;Murder and Seyche receive a scientific sample from an agent&#39;. You can use any Free-to-Use character from the Wiki; alternately, if you need one, I can lend you one of my agents (please ask first, though!). (It would probably be Kayleigh, because she has a very... distinct personality) Find someone to beta the sample - I see Iximaz has offered already - and post it to this thread when you&#39;re ready; I&#39;ll make the call from that. And remember the three things I&#39;m looking for - punctuation, good characterisation/description of Murder, and PPC knowledge.<br><br>(Did I say &#39;a few minutes&#39;? More like 45... oh well, close enough!)<br><br>hS</p>

It&#39;s in the FAQ)<br><br><b>Name:</b> Kayleigh Leonard, though she&#39;s universally known just as Kayleigh.<br><b>Species:</b> Human female.<br><b>Home Continuum:</b> World One.<br><b>Age:</b> Mid-twenties.<br><b>Department:</b> Bad Slash, with her partner Salamander. He&#39;s blind. They semi-specialise in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.<br><b>Appearance:</b> Generally your average Caucasian female. Fairly short (&quot;I&#39;m short for my height!&quot;), brown hair, brown eyes, and, usually, an insane grin.<br><b>Personality:</b> Kayleigh is insane. Actually, technically that&#39;s not true. Kayleigh has ADHD, and hasn&#39;t been treated for it in years (she claimed the pills made her boring). Most people think she&#39;s turned herself into an intentional self-parody of hyperactivity - but there&#39;s always the worrying thought that she might be for real.<br>She is incessantly and invariably cheerful, grinning and exclaiming - not to mention spouting non-sequiturs - everywhere she goes. She cheerfully (there&#39;s that word again) accepts any situation; she also wears a bikini under her uniform, and has no problem stripping down to sunbathe at every opportunity.<br>Since Salamander was blinded, Kayleigh has developed a habit of occasionally narrating her actions. &quot;Hi! Wave! I&#39;m Kayleigh! BIIIIIG smile!&quot; This is theoretically so he knows what she&#39;s doing, but in practice, she does it everywhere.<br><b>Abilities:</b> Kayleigh has a fondness for oversized weapons, which she pulls out of nowhere. When asked about her comically-large mace, she claimed it came from &#39;Mace-Space&#39;. She has no problem with (cheerfully) murdering Mary-Sues and the like.<br><b>History:</b> Kayleigh joined the PPC in 2003, having found a door to HQ in a cave in Switzerland while on holiday there. She quickly established a niche for herself as a crazy (see above) conspiracy theorist - she is behind the DAVD Conspiracy Theory, which states (with no evidence) that DAVD are out to get everyone.<br>Kayleigh was involved in the <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/CrashTitle.htm">2006 invasion</a> by the Black Cats; she demonstrated a rather disturbing level of intelligence for someone so hyper.<br><b>Other:</b> At one point, Kayleigh changed her middle name by deed poll every few days; it&#39;s unknown if she still does this. She also has a trio of three-year-old children; whether they are adopted, or naturally hers by one or more fathers, is unknown (and no-one wants to ask).<br><br>So, is that enough to go on?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Now Huinesoron will get the impression that you don’t do the research. He gave you a link to Kayleigh’s page on the Wiki, where all here appearances are linked. To read all her &quot;missions&quot;, you just need to follow these links. <br><br>On first glance it seems that she doesn’t have any real missions, all her appearances are probably in interludes and other stuff. So I may have got you wrong. Did you ask for &quot;real missions&quot; which aren’t linked there?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry for my mistakes. I&#39;ll be sure to be more careful in the future. If I had to choose a canon for Murder I would say High School of the Dead.

            <p>Hi, guys. I&#39;m seeking the help of the Board brain collective to potentially re-name one of my agents, currently known as <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Gall_Bonecrusher">Gall Bonecrusher</a>, and her <a href="http://howtotrainyourdragon.wikia.com/wiki/Monstrous_Nightmare">Monstrous Nightmare</a> dragon, currently known as Snerri.<br><br>Since <i>How to Train Your Dragon 2</i> came out (and was completely awesome), I&#39;ve delved deeper into the franchise, and it&#39;s become more and more apparent to me that their names are stupid—not &quot;Gall,&quot; that&#39;s fine, but the rest just doesn&#39;t work. I suspected as much from the start, if I&#39;m being honest, but I sorta figured I could skate by on the basis that she&#39;s a badfic character and came up with those names all by herself. The problem is, I myself am no longer satisfied with that excuse, and it&#39;s bugging me enough that I&#39;m having trouble continuing to write them. I&#39;d like to come up with some new names that I don&#39;t hate and get them more canon-compliant.<br><br><u>The first problem</u>: Gall&#39;s surname. I&#39;m looking for basically a normal Nordic surname, because they have those. Ones that are already taken are Hofferson, Ingerman, Jorgenson, and Thorston. I&#39;d like to stick to the suffixes evident in the franchise if possible, so names ending in -son, -man, or -(s)ton are preferred. I&#39;m also hoping for something sorta crunchy-sounding, with <i>S</i>es and <i>K</i>s and other things you might have to spit to pronounce properly. Anything starting with <i>L</i> is right out. I have a few possibilities in mind (topping the list right now are Knutson and Skogman; I briefly considered Saknussemm for the lulz, but I&#39;m pretty sure Jules Verne made that one up), but I want to see if you guys can come up with something good that I missed before I make a decision. {= )<br><br><u>The second problem</u>: The dragon&#39;s name. The dragons in the franchise all have names constructed of regular (English) words, such as Toothless, Stormfly, Hookfang, Meatlug, Torch, Thornado, etc. I thought about simply transferring &quot;Bonecrusher&quot; over to the dragon, but since there&#39;s one in the new film called Skullcrusher, thaaaat&#39;s off the table. I&#39;m hoping for something kinda punny but also badass, like &quot;Thornado.&quot; To give you an idea of the direction I&#39;m going, here are a couple names I came up with but rejected for various reasons:<br><br>* Pyrefly - too girly, too similar to Stormfly. Also an actual thing in <i>Final Fantasy X</i>, if I remember right, though this isn&#39;t necessarily a negative point.<br><br>* Razerwing - kinda... I dunno, generic? And he&#39;d end up getting called Razer for short, which is kinda dumb. Plus, I think &quot;razorwings&quot; may also already be a thing somewhere. Again, not necessarily a negative, but just goes to show that my brain is incapable of an original thought in this matter. {= P<br><br>This is for a large blue dragon who can light himself on fire for an awesome intimidation factor. Plays on words to do with fire, explosions, general destruction, blueness, things that are blue, etc., would be sweet.<br><br>There&#39;s only so much that one brain can come up with by itself.

            <p>I think I&#39;m gonna go with &quot;Gall Knutson,&quot; because it&#39;s just a funny, quirky surname. I don&#39;t even know how to pronounce it. Nut-son? Noot-son? Kanut-son? Kanoot-son? {X D Doesn&#39;t matter, I like it any which way.<br><br>To answer the question of patronymics, they don&#39;t strictly follow the rules in the franchise, so yeah, it&#39;s -son. To give a couple examples, Snotlout Jorgenson&#39;s father is called Spitelout Jorgenson (voiced by David Tennant!), and Astrid is Astrid Hofferson, not -dotter.<br><br>As for the dragon, first let me thank you guys for your great suggestions. You all had some really good ideas and helped get my brain working in new and different directions. Plus, I learned about some cool things, like blue jets and red sprites, which led me to something called black-body radiation, which just sounds awesome, doesn&#39;t it?<br><br>I also dug up some cool new words in my own search for good punbait:<br><br>* Brontide: a low rumbling sound, as of distant thunder or minor seismic activity.<br>* Ingle: a fire in a hearth. Also &quot;inglenook,&quot; a fireplace.<br>* Scarfskin: the outermost layer of skin; the epidermis.<br><br>But ultimately, I think the dragon&#39;s name is Fellrazer. Yeah, I&#39;m back on the &quot;raze&quot; thing... I didn&#39;t mean to cling to that, it just works. I like this because it sounds like something Gall would come up with, and it also sounds like one whole word rather than two randomly stuck together. Plus, it has <i>three</i> layers of meaning, which is more than I ever hoped for:<br><br>1. Sounds like &quot;hellraiser&quot;<br>2. Fell = fierce/dangerous, razer = one who razes (&quot;deadly fire-starter&quot;)<br>3. Fell = the skin or hide of an animal (<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fell">yes, really</a>; scroll down to fell<sup>4</sup>!), razer = &#39;&#39; (&quot;sets himself on fire&quot;)<br><br>&quot;Fell&quot; sealed the deal for me. {= )<br><br>I&#39;m not <i>totally</i> closing the book on this just yet, though, because I&#39;d hate to commit and change everything only to come up with something cooler today or tomorrow, so if you still have ideas, please share them! I&#39;d love to hear it if anyone thinks they&#39;ve come up with something even better. {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m seeing a lot of spikes in that design, so how about something like Pyrospine? Infereck has also suggested itself (Inferno + wreck), but is a bit too oblique. Ehm... Flamithorn? Ooh, or Wrathfire, that&#39;s a <i>cool</i> name.<br><br>Of course, you wanted a pun... well, there&#39;s always <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyracantha">Firethorn</a>. Or Catastrophire (possibly with an F)?<br><br>One question: are you planning on having the name-change be an in-universe thing? We have enough precedent for that - Morgan got a heap of memories dumped on her after the Time War was invented (and at various points since), and I believe Printworthy suffered a similar shift when his identity was assigned to a canon character. Of course, you could just have them change their names, too, I suppose.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And no, I&#39;m just gonna retcon it, since I wasn&#39;t 100% thrilled with my choices to begin with.

            <p>... on whether it&#39;s a family name or not. The naming convention in Nordic countries used to go something like &#39;Mikkel, son of Magnus&#39; and his son would then be &#39;Magnus, son of Mikkel&#39; (first-born son was typically named after the paternal grandfather, second son after the maternal).

            <p>That was a lot of good advice. I think I was following most of it anyway, but it&#39;s nice to get confirmation that I&#39;ve been going about betaing in the right sort of way, and haven&#39;t been missing out any important aspects of it. <br><br>Continuing my pattern of using Officer Shacklemore in these workshops, here’s a little Interlude that I&#39;ve got. This piece assumes that Shacklemore has met Skeet and Amy several times in the course of his duties, and that Skeet has been caught with contraband on a number of occasions. <br><br>I wanted it to come across that Shacklemore sees Skeet more as a nuisance than a criminal – Skeet is supposed to get in trouble fairly frequently, but only for relatively minor things. As such, he’s probably been questioned a few times, but it hasn’t gone far enough for Skeet to just get locked up. I’m not sure how well that came across though, so any thoughts on that would be appreciated.<br><br>Other than that, I’m just looking for feedback on general SPaG and PPCishness. <br><br>---------<br><br>Agents Amelia and Skeet were still putting away the gear from their last mission when Theodore Shacklemore walked in.<br><br>“This is harassment!” Skeet protested, before the DIA Officer had had a chance to say anything.<br><br>“No, this is a <i>conversation</i>. If you’d like, I could probably arrange for some harassment, and you could do a compare and contrast study.”<br><br>“Skeet!” Amy said, looking (and sounding) just like a teacher scolding a naughty child, “You’re being rude!” <br><br>She turned to their unexpected guest, smiling brightly. “Hello, Theo.” Her smile was replaced by a frown as she contemplated her partner. “What did he do <i>this</i> time?”<br><br>“Nothing!” Skeet’s initial outburst was just an automatic reaction, but then he realised that it was actually true. “Wait, no, I mean <i>really</i> nothing - what the hell are you doing here?”<br><br>Verbal reprimands were clearly having no effect, so Amy changed tactics and glared at Skeet instead <br><br>“Hello, Amy,” Shacklemore said, “It’s nice to see you.” Then he turned to Skeet. “I’m here to ask a favour.”<br><br>“From me?” Skeet gave a snort of laughter. “Wow, you really must be desperate.”<br><br>“Not desperate, but I believe that you may be able to help us. And I thought that you might be interested in building up some goodwill with the department.”<br><br>“And what help could I be to Infernal Repairs?”<br><br>Shacklemore ignored the jibe at his department. “Have you ever heard the saying ‘use a thief to catch a thief’?”<br><br>“You need <i>my</i> help catching a thief? Training standards in your department must’ve slipped.”<br><br>“No, I want your help catching an idiot that’s been bringing in black market Bleeprin.” He walked in further and propped himself up against the console. “It’s marketed as the regular stuff, but it’s less than half as strong. FicPsych have already noticed an upsurge in the number of agents being admitted for ‘enforced R&amp;R’ after regular missions. And there has been at least one case of an agent overdosing on actual Bleeprin after the fake pills made him assume that he’d built up a tolerance to it. Doctor Freedenberg is currently trying to rebuild his memories.”<br><br>With that news, Skeet’s whole demeanour changed. “Shit, sorry. I didn’t mean to make light of something like that. So, what do you actually want me to do? I mean, I could shoot the guy, but I’m not really an investigator.”<br><br>“We are both aware that you have, how shall I put this politely, ‘access to sources of supply outside of the official channels’-”<br><br>Suddenly Skeet was back on the defensive again. “Hey, that’s never been proven. You can’t just come in here making unjustified accusations.”<br><br>“Indeed. But there’s a world of difference between ‘unjustified’ and ‘unproven’, wouldn’t you agree?”<br><br>Skeet opened his mouth to reply, then closed it again. That sounded like it might have been a trick question to him, and his inadvertent diplomatic silence was probably the best answer he could have given. <br> <br>“Besides, do I really need proof of your misdeeds in order to ask a favour?”<br><br>That <i>definitely</i> sounded like a trick question to Skeet. Fortunately, his partner’s diplomacy skills extended beyond a simple talent for avoiding self-incrimination.<br> <br> Amy had taken the opportunity to make herself comfortable on the sofa, and one of the many mini-Moggets had taken <i>that</i> opportunity to make herself comfortable on Amy. The white-haired, and exceptionally fluffy, cat wriggled in pleasure as Amy petted her. “What exactly is this favour? An investigation like this sounds like it’d need subtlety, and Skeet, well… he isn’t exactly subtle.”<br><br>“I am glad that I can count on you to be the voice of reason, Amy,” Shacklemore then turned back to Skeet. “If you have information on how to evade the security departments, then withholding such information from our investigation would be directly harming your fellow agents. Does the wellbeing of your fellows really mean so little to you that you would ignore their plight?”<br><br>“Oh for fu-” Skeet cut himself off before cursing, and gave a sound that was halfway between a growl and a sigh instead. “If I ever end up in a carton with a good angel on one shoulder and a bad angel on the other, that prissy little do-gooding <i>guilt-tripper</i> is gonna look just like you, you know that? <br><br>“Alright, listen, I’m not saying that I <i>can</i> help, but, hypothetically speaking, <i>if I could</i>, then you’d probably be getting an anonymous, and completely-untraceable-to-me, letter giving some details in, say, two or three days time.”<br><br>“Well, equally hypothetically, if  were to receive such a letter, then you would have my thanks. That wasn’t so difficult, was it?”<br><br>“I dunno, it still feels weird to have you ask me for a favour. Usually you’re asking things like ‘where was I between the hours of 8 and 12 yesterday?’.”<br><br>“yes, well, I’m sure that I will have the opportunity to ask such questions of you again soon. Good day, agents.” With that, Shacklemore left. <br><br>Skeet turned to Amy, who was still stroking ellismere fro forwin mill - the longest named mini out of their entire collection. “How come you get to sit there looking like a <i>Bond</i> villain, and <i>I’m</i> the one that gets interrogated?” <br><br>“Because I’m actually nice to people, and you have about as much social graces as a Viking raid!”<br><br>“Oh, whatever. And what was that about me not being subtle? I was pretty subtle at the end there, don’t you think?”<br><br>“For you, yes. Which isn’t saying much. And Theo’s insult earlier was much more subtle.”<br><br>“What? He didn’t insult me.”<br><br>“See what I mean?”</p>

Doctor Freedenberg is currently trying to rebuild his memories.”<br><br>With that news, Skeet’s whole demeanour changed. “Shit, sorry. I didn’t mean to make light of something like that. So, what do you actually want me to do? I mean, I could shoot the guy, but I’m not really an investigator.”<br><br>“We are both aware that you have, how shall I put this politely, ‘access to sources of supply outside of the official channels’-”<br><br>Suddenly Skeet was back on the defensive again. “Hey, that’s never been proven. You can’t just come in here making unjustified accusations.”<br><br>“Indeed. But there’s a world of difference between ‘unjustified’ and ‘unproven’, wouldn’t you agree?”<br><br>Skeet opened his mouth to reply, then closed it again. That sounded like it might have been a trick question to him, and his inadvertent diplomatic silence was probably the best answer he could have given. <br><br>“Besides, do I really need proof of your misdeeds in order to ask a favour?”<br><br>That <i>definitely</i> sounded like a trick question to Skeet. Fortunately, his partner’s diplomacy skills extended beyond a simple talent for avoiding self-incrimination.<br><br> Amy had taken the opportunity to make herself comfortable on the sofa, and one of the many mini-Moggets had taken <i>that</i> opportunity to make herself comfortable on Amy. The white-haired, and exceptionally fluffy, cat wriggled in pleasure as Amy petted her. “What exactly is this favour? An investigation like this sounds like it’d need subtlety, and Skeet, well… he isn’t exactly subtle.”<br><br>“I am glad that I can count on you to be the voice of reason, Amy,” Shacklemore then turned back to Skeet. “If you have information on how to evade the security departments, then withholding such information from our investigation would be directly harming your fellow agents. Does the wellbeing of your fellows really mean so little to you that you would ignore their plight?”<br><br>“Oh for fu-” Skeet cut himself off before cursing, and gave a sound that was halfway between a growl and a sigh instead. “If I ever end up in a carton with a good angel on one shoulder and a bad angel on the other, that prissy little do-gooding <i>guilt-tripper</i> is gonna look just like you, you know that? <br><br>“Alright, listen, I’m not saying that I <i>can</i> help, but, hypothetically speaking, <i>if I could</i>, then you’d probably be getting an anonymous, and completely-untraceable-to-me, letter giving some details in, say, two or three days time.”<br><br>“Well, equally hypothetically, if  were to receive such a letter, then you would have my thanks. That wasn’t so difficult, was it?”<br><br>“I dunno, it still feels weird to have you ask me for a favour. Usually you’re asking things like ‘where was I between the hours of 8 and 12 yesterday?’.”<br><br>“yes, well, I’m sure that I will have the opportunity to ask such questions of you again soon. Good day, agents.” With that, Shacklemore left. <br><br>Skeet turned to Amy, who was still stroking ellismere fro forwin mill - the longest named mini out of their entire collection. “How come you get to sit there looking like a <i>Bond</i> villain, and <i>I’m</i> the one that gets interrogated?” <br><br>“Because I’m actually nice to people, and you have about as much social graces as a Viking raid!”<br><br>“Oh, whatever. And what was that about me not being subtle? I was pretty subtle at the end there, don’t you think?”<br><br>“For you, yes. Which isn’t saying much. And Theo’s insult earlier was much more subtle.”<br><br>“What? He didn’t insult me.”<br><br>“See what I mean?”</p>

            <p>When Officer Shacklemore arrives, Skeet immediately expects an accusation, Shacklemore expects that Skeet has at least some standards and doesn&#39;t have any proof of Skeet being a smuggler anyway, and I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t ask a favour from a hard-boiled criminal. Yes, you brought this across quite well. Also, the scene feels very PPCish to me, depicting the impact fake Bleep products would have on the daily work at HQ.<br><br>SpaG: Apache Open Office spell check says that &quot;wellbeing&quot; is not a word, it should be &quot;well-being&quot;.<br><br>Officer Shacklemore may have dropped a word in &quot;... if were to receive such a letter ...&quot;.<br>Didn&#39;t he intend to say &quot;... if <b>we</b> were to receive such a letter ...&quot;.<br><br>And Skeet sounds weird here: “Usually you&#39;re asking things like &#39;where was I between the hours of 8 and 12 yesterday?&#39;.” <br>I don&#39;t believe that Shacklemore usually asks Skeet where  Shacklemore was.

            <p>I&#39;m glad that the right sort of tone came across for Skeet and Theo&#39;s interactions, and that the piece felt PPCish overall. <br><br>Huh, Microsoft Word is perfectly happy with &#39;wellbeing&#39; being a word, but my copy of the Oxford English Dictionary agrees with Apache, and in any conflict between Word and the OED, I always side with the OED. So thanks for pointing that out - I wouldn&#39;t have spotted that otherwise.  <br><br>You&#39;re right in that Shacklemore dropped a word, although what I actually intended him to say was &#39;...if <b>I</b> were to receive such a letter...&#39;. <br><br>Hmmm, I see what you mean about Skeet sounding weird in that sentence, and I think it&#39;s because we can read the quote marks, which aren&#39;t as apparent in actual dialogue that you can hear. Technically speaking, the first alternative that you suggest is correct, however, when I speak it out loud (something I do with a lot of dialogue, so that I can check it sounds right for the character) is sounds like Skeet is asking Shacklemore where he was, because of the &#39;you&#39; in there. In this case, while I believe that what you suggest is more grammatically correct, I&#39;m going to keep it as it is, because I&#39;m more interested in having dialogue sound natural than being technically correct. If it was in the narration, then I&#39;d be interested in making sure it was all technically correct. <br><br>Yup, you got the insult right. </p>

            <p>Firstly, I love the nuisance criminal vibe you&#39;ve got going. I love the show <i>Haven</i>, and the main vibe in the first two seasons between two of the main characters (one a cop, the other a smuggler, but with a hugely complicated backstory) is pretty much what you said you wanted here. I compared Theo and Skeet&#39;s conversation here to Nathan and Duke talking as I read it. (Sorry it&#39;s one of those &#39;readers bring their own weirdness&#39; things that a writer can never control for). Anyway, I thought it worked well. In this case it is definitely Officer Theo who is the smarter and more patient of the pair. <br><br>He gets a bit of the &#39;obnoxiously superior&#39; thing going at the end, but that fits well with the cop dealing with a nuisance criminal (and being forced to ask a favour, which I imagine he doesn&#39;t find the most pleasant).<br><br>It speaks well of Skeet that he changed his tune when he heard that it was something dangerous that Theo needed help with. That also lends credence to your statement that Skeet is more of a nuisance than a serious bad guy.<br><br>Details: <br><br>Did they have their RC door open, or did Shacklemore open/unlock their door to get in?<br><br>[“No, this is a <i>conversation</i>. If you’d like, I could probably arrange for some harassment, and you could do a compare and contrast study.”] I love this line. It fits so well with the cop vs nuisance criminal thing.<br><br>I loved that Skeet&#39;s reaction was immediate denial followed by the realization that he really hadn&#39;t done anything (this time). <br><br>The Infernal Repairs jibe is great, too.<br><br>[If I ever end up in a carton] cartoon Also, I love the mention of shoulder angel/devil. I&#39;ve always really liked that in cartoons.<br><br>[if were to receive such a letter,] missing word. I or we probably.</p>

            <p>Thanks very much for your comments, and sorry for taking so long to reply. <br><br>I&#39;ve never heard of <i>Haven</i> before, but I might have to keep an eye out for it for use as a reference. The stuff that I had in my head when thinking about Theo and Skeet&#39;s relationship/interactions was some scenes from the smuggler storyline from <i>Star Wars: The Old Republic</i>. I&#39;m glad that you think it worked well, and you&#39;re right - Shacklemore is definitely smarter and more patient than Skeet. But Skeet is probably unpredictable enough to give him a run for his money.  <br><br>As for the details...<br><br>Huh, that&#39;s a very good point about the door. I&#39;ve never really thought about it before, but I&#39;ve got several scenes written up (although not posted, so I do have time to change this if I want) that have people just walking I, although sometimes they do knock. At the moment it seems like Skeet and Amy don&#39;t routinely lock their door when out of the RC. <br><br>The conversation/harassment line is one of my favourites too. <br><br>&#39;Infernal Repairs&#39; come from the <i>Lethal Weapon</i> series, I forget which one, but I always thought it was a cool jibe too, so it just stuck in my head. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to bring it out. <br><br>As for the shoulder angel, I think I&#39;m going to have to send Skeet into a cartoon, just so that I can have it looking like Theo. I&#39;ll have to think of someone else to use for the shoulder devil (having it look like Skeet just doesn&#39;t seem creative enough). <br><br>Yup, the missing word was &#39;I&#39;, which I guess technically makes it a missing letter. </p>

            <p>Good to see a DIA agent in action again!  You gave a good description of Shacklemore&#39;s work (love that name on a DIA officer, by the way), which was important, since most spin-offs don&#39;t portray agents committing actual crimes like the DIA would get involved in.  I like that you involved Bleeprin in the story not just as a background detail, but by showing the potential consequences that bootlegged, less efficient Bleep could have on HQ.  (Any chance of this story being fully fleshed out from Shacklemore&#39;s view someday?)<br><br>You definitely succeeded on the &quot;nuisance vs. criminal&quot; thing.  From their speech and mannerisms, the reader can see that Skeet is feeling panicked, and assumes it&#39;s about him getting in trouble, while Shacklemore is just taking a relatively hum-drum step in a much larger and more important event.  The one thing that seemed a bit odd to me in this situation is that Shack (Can I call him that?) didn&#39;t argue for Skeet to get the letter to him faster than &quot;two or three days&#39; time.&quot;  I know it&#39;s in HQ, and time is wibbly-wobbly, but considering agents&#39; sanity is being actively threatened, I think the DIA might want potentially breakthrough info sooner than days away.  Unless I&#39;m not understanding something about the letter, that it would take that long to compose?<br><br>[. . . ‘use a thief to catch a thief’?”]<br>* I think the question mark should go inside both sets of quotation marks.

Can anyone else weigh in?<br><br>[. . . sources of supply outside of the official channels’-”]<br>*(I think) The hyphen goes inside both quotation marks, same as above.<br><br>[. . . a world of difference between ‘unjustified’ and ‘unproven’,]<br>*Here, the comma definitely goes inside the single quote.<br><br>“&#39;If I ever end up in a <b>carton</b> with a good angel on one shoulder . . .&#39;&quot;<br>*We don&#39;t want Skeet on a milk carton!

However, since you have that whole phrase hyphenated, it might be okay to leave that first hyphen in just for aesthetic reasons.<br>*&quot;Days&quot; should have an apostrophe.

            <p>Sadly, I can&#39;t take credit for Shacklemore&#39;s name - the Shacklemore Agency is the name of a bounty hunting organisation from his home continuum (&#39;Tales of the Ketty Jay&#39; - an action/adventure series with a  steampunk setting and plenty of sky pirates. I thoroughly recommend it). I figured someone like that would be drawn to the DIA rather than Floaters, DMS, etc. <br><br>Strangely enough, I&#39;ve just noticed that Shacklemore&#39;s first appearance featured black market Bleeprin, although in that case it was sugar pills being sold as Bleeprin, resulting in some very excitable agents, so presumably those two cases are unrelated. Although I&#39;m starting to think that maybe Theo spends a lot of his time dealing with Bleeprin and other substances - does the DIA even have a vice squad?  <br><br>I&#39;m glad that I succeeded at portraying Skeet as a nuisance, and the fact that Skeet sees this as potentially a really big deal, whereas Shack (sure you can call him that) just sees it as a run of the mill event. That&#39;s a very good point about the time delay actually - I may have unintentionally made Theo psychic, because of course I knew exactly what both characters were thinking. <br><br>You&#39;re right, the DIA probably would want the information quicker than that, and it wouldn&#39;t take Skeet that long to write something up. However, it might take him that long to write it up in such a way that gives them all the relevant details, without implicating himself in anything. If Theo tried to force the issue, Skeet would probably have just clammed up - looking out for himself rather than other agents that he may not even know. I figure if Theo had encountered Skeet a few times before, then he&#39;d probably know this about him, so decided to play along with Skeet rather than risk loosing his source. <br><br>With regards to the various bits of punctuation being outside of the quote marks, I must admit that grammar isn&#39;t my strong point, and you&#39;ve got me doubting myself now, but I believe that this is just a difference between American English and British English. I&#39;m pretty sure that British style is that punctuation should only go inside the quote marks if it&#39;s actually part of the quote itself. Although if someone that is more confident on British grammar could confirm or deny that, it&#39;d be useful. <br><br>Thanks for pointing out those other SPaG errors (I actually spotted the &#39;carton&#39; one as I was uploading it, and was sorely tempted to correct it myself because it made such a ridiculous sentence, but in the end I decided to leave it as part of the workshop. It&#39;s a pesky little one though - slipped straight through the spellchecker). In particular, thanks for pointing out the requirement for a hyphen in &#39;longest-named&#39;, I actually didn&#39;t realise there was anything wrong with how I had it. <br><br>Personally, I consider &#39;alright&#39; to be acceptable in dialogue (it&#39;s listed in my copy of the OED, although it does specify that it&#39;s slang), although I would use &#39;all right&#39; in narration. </p>

            <p>The insult is fairly subtle, and could even be accidental  on Shacklemore&#39;s part / Amy just reading too much into things. Theo refers to the idea of using a thief to catch a thief - if you follow the same logic then he should use an idiot to catch an idiot, and he came straight to Skeet for help with that. <br><br>Yeah, I suppose I didn&#39;t really give a proper introduction for the characters in this one - it never occurred to me that it might need one, because I know who they are (obviously). So yeah, Amy and Skeet are my main agent pair (in the DMS), and the only ones that I&#39;ve actually written missions for so far. I do plan on writing for the DIA, so Shacklemore will get his day in the limelight at some point. <br><br>Shacklemore doesn&#39;t have that much stuff at the moment, as he has so far only appeared in these workshops. What there is can be found <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=249204;search_term=shacklemore">here</a> and at the bottom of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=252844;search_term=shacklemore">this post</a>.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen agents overdosing on Bleeprin before. The wiki page lists a couple of examples, although neither of them actually sound familiar to me, so there might be some other examples floating round the place. It certainly seems like the kind of thing that could happen, after all, every other drug/medicine has unwanted effects of you take too much of it. <br><br>Thanks for pointing out the lack of speech mark in that line, and the typo (for future reference, when betaing it&#39;s useful to highlight the word in question somehow, rather than just saying &#39;you&#39;ve got a typo in there somewhere&#39;). I don&#39;t think the line needs any more commas - it reads fine to me as it is. </p>

            <p>This is just a quick excerpt from an interlude or the start of a mission with the two agents that I&#39;m considering.<br>***<br>Aaron and Natalie had agreed to familiarize themselves with each other’s canons, and while Natalie was greatly enjoying Fallout 3, she had seen more than enough Fire Ants for one lifetime.  “Hey, kid,” she said, removing her headphones, “is it worth it to leave the queen, or should I just kill her?”  Aaron, who was in the middle of playing Fate/Stay Night, did not respond, and Natalie noticed that he was oddly hunched over the screen.  She put a hand on his arm, frowning.  “Kid?”<br><br>Aaron jumped in his seat, and quickly hit the menu button.  “Y-yes?” he stammered, his face pink.<br><br>“What’s wrong?”<br><br>“Nothing!  Nothing’s wrong, I just got a little… distracted.  By the game.”<br><br>Natalie sighed.  “Let me guess, you’re not playing the Realta Nua version.”   <br><br>If it was possible, Aaron blushed even harder, but his posture became slightly defiant.  “I might be a kid to you, but I am nineteen, so I can watch the… the explicit scenes if I want to.”<br><br>She rolled her eyes.  “I don’t care that you’re playing h-games – I wouldn’t have recommended that you play this one if I did – but I’m not babysitting a hormonal teenager.  If we get a Fate/Stay Night mission and you start mooning over Saber instead of being useful, I will sit you down and make you watch the No-Drool videos.” <br><br>Aaron snorted.  “Says the woman who lusts over every man with a trench coat and a gun.”<br><br>It was Natalie’s turn to blush, though her darker complexion meant that it wasn’t as obvious.  “I do <i>not</i> lust after – ”<br><br>“Oh please, I’ve read your list.”  He grinned, his voice teasing.  “Emiya Kiritsugu, Malcolm Reynolds, Harry Dresden…  Do you notice a pattern here?  Because I’m definitely noticing a pattern here.”<br><br>“So maybe I have a type.  But I can actually say the word ‘sex’ without turning the color of a rutabaga and switching it out for ‘explicit’, so I’m the one who gets to assign the No-Drool videos.”<br></p>

            <p>Nice banter. What I get from it is an insecure young man and a woman who may be more caring than she likes to admit. I don’t know their canons, so I will probably not understand much of their missions, but I may still be interested in learning to know them better.<br><br>Grammar check is a bit confused at some points, but in the end I trust my own judgment better: no errors detected.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Overall impressions: I like these two. They will make a good agent pair. Mismatched, but enough balance so I don&#39;t expect that one of them will overshadow the other. <br><br>Nothing really stood out to me on the first reading that just had to be commented on, which is good. It read very smoothly.<br><br>Natalie: I do not know her continuum, so I don&#39;t know much about her at all except that she is quite a bit older than Aaron (or pretends to be). I am not sure she is human, but the tone of her speech makes me think she might be. She seemed concerned about him when he didn&#39;t answer her at first, which tells me that she may be rough around the edges, but cares. <br><br>Does an h-rated game mean Hentai? It doesn&#39;t really matter, I assume that at some point we&#39;ll get physical descriptions of these two and more background info. This is well-written enough that I&#39;m willing to wait and read a lot more of the story to get those answers as they come up naturally in the story. <br><br>I love that she has actual registered Lust Objects, and that they have a type. Has she ever encountered Ronon Dex of Stargate Atlantis? He doesn&#39;t wear the long coat all the time, but he does sometimes.<br><br>Aaron: We get his age, and I like that he is embarrassed to talk about sex. I don&#39;t know what Department they will be in, but I imagine this could be rather funny in, say, a DBS mission. It doesn&#39;t say here, of course, but I get the impression that he may be physically smaller than Natalie as well as younger. This may just be me taking in that she is treating him as smaller with calling him kid and such. I would be amused if that assumption of mine was turned upside down. I&#39;d be happy if it was right, too, though.<br><br><br>Details: <br><br>[I just got a little… distracted.] I may be wrong, but I think that if you leave a space after an ellipsis that you have to capitalize the next word.<br><br>I missed it the first time through that Natalie is described as darker complected than Aaron. So there is some physical description hints in here. <br><br>I like that they talk about the No-Drool videos. I think those get forgotten sometimes.<br></p>

            <p>This scene is different from most &quot;introduction to a new spin-off&quot; scenes, and I kind of like how simple it is.  Two new partners get to know each other by &quot;studying&quot; the back-stories of each other&#39;s worlds.  I&#39;m surprised it doesn&#39;t happen more often, really.  I also love that Natalie&#39;s &quot;game guide&quot; is just to ask a resident of the game world for advice; it&#39;s a simple joke, but it&#39;s really funny when you think about it!<br><br>Also, kudos on making Natalie a character of color.  We&#39;re definitely in need of more around here.  (Says a person whose primary agents are both white.)<br><br>Out of curiosity, are these going to be Bad Slash agents?  I only ask because of the forthright discussion of lust objects right at the outset of their partnership.<br><br>The only technical thing I see is that titles of major works (<i>Fate/Stay Night</i> and <i>Fallout 3</i>) should be italicized.  On this Board the code is Fallout but with no spaces inside the s.<br><br>(Fun fact: I have failed to spell &quot;italicized&quot; correctly on the first try every single time I&#39;ve typed it in this whole thread!

            <p>It&#39;s meant to take place more after they&#39;ve had a few missions together, and have gotten a little more comfortable around each other.  They&#39;re going to be either DMS or Floaters, as they&#39;re both from backgrounds that involve shooting people.<br><br>That&#39;s the issue with copying from a word document.

            <p>The following is an excerpt from James Pittman&#39;s origin story. Some of the references might make more sense if you know anything about the <i>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</i> series, but it&#39;s not a requirement.<br><br>~~~~~<br><br>Something was burning nearby. James could smell it. Some kind of plastic, maybeThere was something oily about it. A bit of ozone as well. They were familiar scents, and yet… not, for some reason.<br><br>It might help if he could open his eyes. He considered it for a moment, but the way his head was spinning and his ears were ringing just made laying down and doing nothing a far preferable course of action.<br><br>He couldn’t quite remember why he was laying down. Especially on what felt like concrete, if the feeling in his face was any judge. Not the best place to take a nap.<br><br>The ringing was giving way. It was replaced by… a voice? No, voices. All talking over each other.<br><br>No. Not talking. Screaming.<br><br>“<i>--is down! I repeat, Wardog--</i>”<br><br>“<i>--is that thing--</i>”<br><br>“<i>--a medic over--</i>”<br><br>“<i>--help--</i>”<br><br>The voices began to cut out, one by one, until there was only one left.<br><br>“<i>--do you copy? Say again. Long Shot, do you copy?</i>”<br><br>The voice was so familiar. James could have sworn he knew its owner from somewhere. And ‘Long Shot,’ why did that--<br><br>His eyes snapped open. His memories -- the mission, the team, that… thing, that robot war machine or whatever it was, that beam it had fired right at him -- came back in a flood. So did the pain, a crushing sensation in his chest.<br><br>James let out a feeble curse moments before his lungs spasmed. He could taste blood in his mouth as he coughed, could see it splatter on the floor in front of his face. <br><br>That was a lot of blood, actually. Probably more than he could stand to lose at this point. <br><br>He pushed himself on to his hands and knees long enough to roll himself onto his back.<br><br>He tried to get his breathing back under control as he reached up for the communicator in his left ear. “Big Sky,” he croaked. “Big Sky, this is Long Shot.”<br><br>“<i>This is Big Sky,</i>” the Skyranger pilot replied. “<i>What’s your status, Long Shot?</i>”<br><br>James reached down and touched his side, the one where most of the pain seemed to be raidating from. Not the best idea. It was all he could do not to scream in agony. “Not… not good,” he murmured. “I’m beat pretty bad. Where’s the rest?”<br><br>He could hear the pilot sigh. “<i>We’ve lost life signs from the rest of Strike One. The site’s crawling with X-Rays, including whatever that robot thing was.</i>” There was a pause. “<i>Can you make it back to the evac zone?</i>”<br><br>James tilted his head just enough to see through the giant hole in the wall, the one that the robot’s beam had made. He thought he could just make out movement throguh the plumes of smoke rising into the air.<br><br>“Guess I’ll give it a try,” he said.</p>

            <p>I really like this. The way that the intro builds up, with James knowing that <i>something</i> isn&#39;t right, and then it all suddenly snapping into place is very well done. <br><br>There are a couple of SPaG errors, but they&#39;re just little things. <br>- In the first line you&#39;ve got &#39;Some kind of plastic, <u>maybeThere</u> was something oily about it&#39; - there should be a full stop and a space before &#39;There&#39;. <br>- Toward the end, you&#39;ve got &#39;where most of the pain seemed to be <u>radiating</u> from&#39; - this should be &#39;radiating&#39;. <br>- And then in the second to last line you have &#39;He thought he could just make out movement <u>throguh</u> the plumes of smoke&#39; - this should be &#39;through&#39;.  <br><br>There&#39;s also one that I&#39;m not sure about, which is in the third paragraph. You&#39;ve got &#39;He couldn’t quite remember why he was <u>laying</u> down.&#39;. If I remember rightly, &#39;lying&#39; and &#39;laying&#39; can both be used to refer to being horizontal on some surface, but I think they have slightly different meanings, or are applicable in different contexts. I would have used &#39;lying down&#39; here, because that sounds more natural to me when I read it out loud, but as I said I&#39;m not 100% certain that that&#39;s correct. If you&#39;re sure about your usage, then keep it as it is. If you&#39;re not sure yourself, then I recommend double-checking with someone else. <br><br>There are also a couple of points where you&#39;ve made what I consider to be slightly odd word choices - there&#39;s nothing technically wrong with what you&#39;ve written, these are just my opinion, so don&#39;t feel obliged to change anything. <br>- The first is the &#39;crushing sensation&#39; in Pittman&#39;s chest after he was hit by that horrific beam weapon (still remember the first time I encountered one of those mechs in the game - I didn&#39;t do quite as badly as Strike One here, but it wasn&#39;t much better). The weapon looks like laser, or some other kind of directed  energy weapon, so I would have thought that it would give &#39;burning sensations&#39; rather than crushing ones. Personally, I&#39;d have probably gone for &#39;So did the searing pain in his chest.&#39; for that sentence. <br>- The other is Big Sky&#39;s use of &#39;whatever that robot thing was&#39;. I&#39;m torn between two opinions on this one. My first thought was that it sounded quite unprofessional, but then it occurred to me that seeing one for the first time, and the disastrous nature of the mission, would probably be enough to shake his professionalism. Can you remember if they use a specific term to refer to those things in game? <br><br>I enjoyed reading this, and will certainly look out for more stories featuring Pittman. Out of interest, what character class is/was he? </p>

            <p>I like the slow buildup, revealing to the reader over time that they&#39;re looking at a battle scene.  It&#39;s obvious right away that something is wrong, but you feed little details here and there to show just how wrong, until we hit confirmation with the radio chatter.  The impact there is especially strong, since it&#39;s the first italicized text we see in the story, and therefore has a feeling of physical change in the reader&#39;s head.  The suspense of drawing out the situation then continues as you reveal how badly injured Pittman is a bit later.<br><br>I have to admit, I&#39;m surprised Pittman came from such a futuristic continuum.  (Even though, reading back now, he flat-out stated it in &quot;FNGs,&quot; and it&#39;s also listed on his wiki page, so hurr durr I&#39;m smart.)  I really had him pegged as being from a Western, or something like it.  I was going to say I thought his voice pattern was different here from before, but apparently I was the one giving him a cowboy drawl in my head, so . . . HURRRRRR.<br><br>Some kind of plastic, maybeThere was something oily about it.<br>*Period and space between the sentences.<br><br>James reached down and touched his side, the one where most of the pain seemed to be <b>raidating</b> from.<br><br>He thought he could just make out movement <b>throguh</b> the plumes of smoke rising into the air.</p>

            <p>So, to start out, I just want to say that I usually do a ton of editing on my own before I let even a beta read my work.  This means that when PC said to “keep your own editing to a minimum . . . Whatever state your rough drafts are typically in when you&#39;re ready to get a beta is the state your assignment should be in,” that was a contradiction to me, because my rough drafts are usually pretty smooth before I allow any other human to see them.  Ultimately, I&#39;m leaving this piece way rougher than I would like, simply because I haven&#39;t gotten any backing up of PPC stories done yet today, and want to spend as much time as possible on that for the rest of the night until I <s>pass out from exhaustion</s> need to go to sleep for work tomorrow.  (I&#39;m a bachelor, baby.)<br><br>So this is a plotbunny that nibbled upon me while I was reading the surprisingly interesting <i>The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop</i> by Edmund S. Morgan.  (Yes, I do read nonfiction sometimes.  In very small doses.)  It&#39;s basically a sneaky way of doing a Real World mission without missioning a real person fic.  I&#39;ll probably expand it eventually and make it a canon part of my spin-off, but it obviously doesn&#39;t take place yet, since Doc and Vania are currently on the verge of a fight.<br><br>Hey, look!  I kept it under the two page limit!  Woo!<br><br>* * *<br><br>Stepping into the cobbled streets of London through a portal, Doc couldn&#39;t help fanning his hands through all the frills that surrounded his neck.  “I feel like a I have more petals than the Marquis.”<br><br>“No complaining,” said Vania in a low voice, rolling her eyes and seeing the overcast sky above.  The grey clouds made the dirty stones around them look even more toneless and dull.  “Corsets, corsets, of coursets.  Always.”<br><br>The exited the alley and followed the corner of the brick building on their left, taking in the activity filling the avenue.  Carriages drawn by horses clopped up and down the street at intervals, but the sidewalks were filled with people moving from shop to shop.  Heavy, wooden doors opened into each establishment, with gentlemen and ladies filing in and out of each almost constantly.  On the corner behind them, a man was standing on a sturdy wooden box, holding a glass bottle aloft before a half-interested crowd.<br><br>“Welcome to Earth before inflation,” Vania explained.  “Well, before inflation at the level you knew in your time.  We can get edible food here for way cheaper.”<br><br>Doc glanced back at the man on the corner.  “And better than the Cafeteria has?”<br><br>“Oh yes.  Just—”<br><br>“Hang on.” Doc turned around and approached the man.  He had caught part of the speech—something about limes—and yanked the bottle from his hand.<br><br>Startled and angry, the man said, “Ah, Sir, that does coste six pounds!”  He added a soft “uh” sound at the end of “coste.”<br><br>Doc uncorked the bottle and took one sniff of the liquid inside.  “More watere than either lime or fish liver,” he pronounced.  “Save your money for elsewhere, goode people.”  With that, Doc tossed the recorked bottle back to the salesman, then turned away and took Vania&#39;s hand, leading her away from the angry calls of the man and the laughter of the crowd behind them.<br><br>“What was that?” Vania asked.<br><br>“Colonization of the Americas is becoming more common right now,” Doc explained.  “Scurvy is common during the journey, so some people started taking advantage of it, and selling quack remedies.  That stuff was more water than vitamin C.”<br><br>Vania allowed herself to be pulled along.  “I&#39;m impressed, Doc.  That was very take charge of you.  Even if it was against the rules.”<br><br>Doc froze in midstep in front of another alley, turning around to look at her.  (The neck frills spun rather amusingly, like a dancer&#39;s skirt.)  He stared quizzically, then turned pale.  “Oh.  This is a world.”<br><br>“Yep!”<br><br>“And he was a canon character, and that was a canon scene.”<br><br>“Yeeeaaah.”<br><br>“Oops.”<br><br>Vania patted his hand.  “No worries.  It may not even count, since you&#39;re native here.  Let&#39;s worry about the Flowers after we finish shopping.”<br><br>“All right.”  Doc looked away, into the alley.  “Sorry if—”  His eyes widened.<br><br>Vania followed his look.  Based on the layout of the streets around them, this should have been another dead end alleyway.  But it wasn&#39;t.<br><br>An old person stood behind a wooden cart covered in bottles.  People stood around, staring at the figure as if mesmerized, as the seller—the agents couldn&#39;t tell if it was a man or woman, with stringy black hair covering the face—held a glistening, twisted bottle aloft, speaking in a low monotone.<br><br>The crowd around the cart almost seemed to subconsciously want to escape, as they kept shuffling their  shoes uncomfortably against the generic surface they stood on.<br><br>Doc stared at the line, two yards into the alley/road, where the pitted cobbles abruptly ended and the flat and featureless ground began, making even the dark stones under that overcast sky look detailed and beautifully colorful.  “Is this a <i>fic</i>?” he asked.  “Right here, in the middle of the town?”  He scanned all the people stepping around them on the sidewalk, and none of them seemed to notice the odd sight down the former alley.<br><br>“It certainly looks that way,” she replied, closely watching the figure behind its cart, and the pink eyes that now watched the agents curiously.</p>

            <p>No. I’m joking. Beta reading this is fun. Two sentences in and I know already that we are in a historical setting. I like how you do this without stating the year. Would I have guessed the correct time period if you had not mentioned puritans in the introduction? I hope so. <br><br>We are immersed into a busy mercantile district of a sixteenth century city, while Doc and Vania’s comments, interjected at the right points, remind us that they don’t belong there. Yes, I really like this.<br><br>But then, Doc interferes with a canon event, and I am confused. Not that I cannot see him doing what he does, but there is this specific sentence:<br><i>“Oh. This is a world.”</i><br>What else would it be, a holodeck? Apparently Doc and Vania are on a shopping trip, not on a mission, but how can Doc not be aware that there is a canon around them? Maybe you intended to write “Oh. This is a <b>word</b> world,” and Doc believed they were time traveling in real life? I hope for clarification later in the story.<br><br>Doc is native there? He originates from a history novel? I guess I’m over-thinking this. Since Vania apparently is not from World One, she may say that he is native there even if the time period doesn’t fit.<br><br>Technical errors:<br><br><i>I feel like <b>a</b> I have more petals than the Marquis.</i><br>Drop the bolded word.<br><br>I assume that <i>Corsets, corsets, of coursets</i> is a pun, not a mistake. <br><br><i><b>The</b> exited the alley and followed the corner of the brick building on their left, taking in the activity filling the avenue.</i><br>“The” should be “They”. And there is again the problem with not being a native speaker. Even when the error is corrected, the sentence looks somewhat off, but I cannot tell why. <br><br><i>coste</i>, <i>watere</i> and <i> goode</i><br>I assume that these are no errors; Doc knows (or parodies) how sixteenth century people talk, I don’t.<br><br>MS Word spell check says that <i>recorked</i> isn’t a word, it should be “re-corked”.  But “uncorked” is okay? The mysteries of the English language.<br><br>MS Word spell check also says that <i>midstep</i> isn’t a word, it should be “mid-step”.  <br><br><br>A fic invaded the town, or the history novel, or whatever they are in? Stopping at this cliffhanger is evil, and keeping it under the two page limit is no excuse. I want to read more! Well, at least I can now go and read the other comments.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Oh, thank you!  I had given up on getting anymore reviews!<br><br>Sorry for the confusion.

            <p>This is a really nice piece -  it really reads like a nice relaxing trip out somewhere. <br><br>I like how Doc&#39;s anger at seeing people get scammed makes him just jump in and get involved. Vania being so cheerful about pointing out to him that he&#39;d just broken the rules was also very entertaining. <br><br>Out of interest, when Doc grabbed the bottle out of the man&#39;s hand, how surprised should the man and crowd have been? Usually PPC agents are hidden from the sight of canon characters, either by the canon itself or SEP fields depending on the author, until they interact with them, or get pointed out by someone that can spot them. Having someone snatch the quack remedy you&#39;re selling out of your hand would be a little surprising, having someone appear out of thin air to snatch it away would be <i>really</i> surprising. <br><br>You&#39;ve got some really nice lines in here, my favourites are Doc&#39;s about having &#39;more petals than the Marquis&#39;, and Vania&#39;s &#39;Corsets, corsets, of coursets&#39;. <br><br>The idea of a fic just cropping up in the middle of the normal world and twisting things up is very cool. And the fact that the figure noticed the agents and is now watching them is a nice end to the piece. <br><br>I spotted one mistake (and in Doc&#39;s best line too!): “I feel like <u>a</u> I have more petals than the Marquis.” - that &#39;a&#39; shouldn&#39;t be there. <br><br>There were a couple of bits that I noticed, that just seemed like odd phrasing to me. The first is &#39;Carriages drawn by horses&#39; - I&#39;d use &#39;Horse-drawn carriages&#39; here, as I think it sounds more natural. The second one is even more subjective, and that&#39;s the use of &#39;sidewalks&#39; in London. It just sounds odd to me, because it&#39;s an American term - the British equivalent is &#39;pavements&#39;. If this were a longer piece, I&#39;d have asked if you wanted it Britpicked while I betaed. I&#39;m assuming that you probably don&#39;t in this case, as that might lead to inconsistencies with the rest of their missions/interludes, and of course there&#39;s nothing wrong with American tourists using American terms while in Britain. The &#39;sidewalks of London&#39; is always going to look a little odd to me though.   <br></p>

            <p>I may need to reread <i>Life, the Universe and Everything</i>, but I’m quite sure that somewhere therein it’s explained that the SEP field is much better than an  invisibility cloak: People don’t run you over, because they clearly see you and thus avoid collisions; they just don’t think about who you are, why you are there, whether you should be there, and why they had to avoid a collision with somebody who should not even be there, because all these are Somebody Else’s Problems.<br><br>To not only see, but consciously be aware of something under an SEP field, you need to concentrate really hard to distract yourself from thinking about your own problems and automatically ignore everybody else’s problems. Or you need to be really very altruistic.<br><br>When Doc started to act in a way that made him a problem, he didn’t appear out of thin air. Everybody remembered that he had been there, a totally uninteresting bystander nobody had bothered having a closer look at. At least that’s how I think it works.<br><br>HG </p>

            <p>From what I remember, it doesn&#39;t go into that much detail about the SEP works, or how people observe it - but I may be wrong. <br><br>Your point about it being better (safer for the user) than an invisibility cloak is a good one, and I would agree with that. <br><br>I don&#39;t believe that seeing through an SEP field has anything to do with distracting yourself from your own problems, or being altruistic. If I remember rightly anyone can see through an SEP if they catch it out of the corner of their eye, and once you&#39;ve seen through it you continue to be able to do so. The trick is in trying to deliberately &#39;accidentally&#39; catch sight of it out of the corner of your eye, which is why Ford was behaving so oddly (even for him) in that scene. <br><br>As for what happens when you do pierce through an SEP field, I imagine that as something which has been completely unnoticeable to you before is now just suddenly there. If that happened with a person standing next to you, it would be surprising, after all, we normally have a good idea if someone is standing next to us through peripheral vision, hearing them move, etc. <br><br>And I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen the canon-cloaking failing as agents being invisible one moment, but fully there the next, which again would be very surprising if it happened in close proximity to you. <br><br>Either way, it doesn&#39;t really matter, as doctorlit has said that the agents weren&#39;t cloaked in any for this trip, so Doc would&#39;ve been in sight (and just ignored as you would ignore any stranger) at all times anyway, with no surprising reveal. </p>

            <p>(No quotes, because it&#39;s a German translation.)<br><br>Apparently Ford doesn&#39;t see through the SEP field. Out of the corners of his eyes, he can only vaguely see that there is Somebody Else&#39;s Problem, but he cannot tell Arthur what it looks like. Ford only sees the space ship after Arthur pointed out that the SEP is a space ship. <br><br>Distracting yourself from your own problems was actually just my speculation, based on the field&#39;s name. Fitting nicely with not noticing that HQ is a maze may also have played into it. Being altruistic then was a logical extension of this thought.<br><br>But now I&#39;m wondering how Arthur can see the spaceship (and may have seen it for a while, not realizing immediately that this is what Ford calls Somebody Else&#39;s Problem). Arthur was occupied with his own problems until Fords strange behaviour distracted him. My theory may hold more water than I expected.<br><br>An &quot;explanation&quot; of the SEP follows several pages later, when they enter the space ship. It says that it is incredibly difficult to make something invisible, but much more easy and efficient to make it Somebody Else&#39;s Problem. It also mentions walking around or across a mountain, not noticing that it&#39;s there. How would people walking across a mountain not fall on their noses if they didn&#39;t see how far they have to lift their feet? The SEP seems to depend on the difficult distinction between seeing, noticing and being aware of something.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Thanks for reviewing!  I&#39;m glad the setup was interesting and enjoyable.<br><br>I totally wasn&#39;t thinking about the SEP field/canon cloaking thing here.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily relevant since they (initially) aren&#39;t in a badfic: canon isn&#39;t suffering, so its immune system isn&#39;t going off.  Plus, Doc himself is canon to this world (though not this time period, but that&#39;s another question).  So in this case, I don&#39;t think they would have been invisible to the characters/people.  Plus, there&#39;s already a crowd around that first vendor, with people going up and down the street, so the vendor could have written it off as him not noticing someone approach out of all the people passing by, even if the agents had been invisible prior.<br><br>And thank you for the British correction!  I think I will change it, just to match the setting better.  (Interesting.  In America, the pavement is where the cars drive.  If you&#39;re ever over here, Turtle, make sure to walk on the pavements, not the pavement!)  And when I do eventually expand this story, maybe I can hit you up for some beta with a side of britpicking?<br><br>I had avoided using &quot;horse-drawn carriages&quot; because it felt a little over-used to me.  When I hear that phrase, it pulls up a static image in my mind, while &quot;carriages drawn by horses&quot; feels like it has more movement to it.  But that sounds a bit crazy, now that I&#39;ve typed it out.  I&#39;m still a little on the fence about this one.</p>

            <p>Close.  They&#39;re shopping for food to bring back to their RC, and they&#39;re doing it in the so-called real world--which I treat as just another canon in my spin-off.

            <p>I like describing the background setting, you&#39;re good at describing characters (which I&#39;m terrible at).  By our powers combined, we are . . . a fully described scene!  Part of the reason I went so heavily on detail in such a short scene was for the contrast with the generic surface&#39;s appearance later on.<br><br>I initially had Vania messing with the salesman, since Vania tends to rush out and do everything, and not leave Doc much to do action-wise.  I switched it to Doc since it&#39;s his home world, if not home <i>when</i>.  (Hey, he reads all the same books as me, and I knew about it, so . . .)  I&#39;m glad you enjoyed Doc getting a scene like this!  I can hopefully get him to be more assertive as he becomes less of a newb.  (I&#39;ve got <s>fun</s> things planned for him to do during the Blackout, as well!)  And I am planning to finish this, though it will probably be a while, since I&#39;ve fallen behind and need to rap up plot points I have dangling.<br><br>Thanks for finding the mistakes.  The corset/of coarset joke is reeeaaaally dumb, and I may just remove it if it just confuses people.<br><br>I also need to do better (any) research about that extra &quot;e&quot; on the end of words.  I know from the book, which quoted a lot of letters from Winthrop&#39;s time, that people wrote with it, and I know from high school that people spoke that way in Chaucer&#39;s time.  But I need to find out if the soft extra &quot;e&quot; was still being pronounced into the seventeenth century. </p>

It&#39;s in a very different format from our outline (ours pretty much just focused on the beta&#39;s side), and it works, though it feels a little disconnected to me in places. For instance, in &quot;In the Loop,&quot; you mention that you&#39;ll discuss problems that might come up due to lack of communication in the section on finding a beta, but &quot;Finding a Beta&quot; doesn&#39;t cover this—&quot;Be Considerate&quot; sort of does, but it&#39;s more about advising the writer not to be a self-centered jerk than about advising the beta how to avoid causing confusion.<br><br>(I&#39;m the kind of self-centered jerk who tends to avoid communicating when I&#39;m ashamed about my lack of attention to something.

A mission! &quot;Ear&#39;ig, ge&#39; the—&quot; He tried to sit up, but couldn&#39;t. There was a weight on his stomach. Across most of his body, actually.

Why are you in my response center?&quot;<br><br>She stared at him, and he wasn&#39;t sure whether it was because she thought the question was stupid or because she was struggling to come up with the answer herself. Then she said, &quot;Because it&#39;s mine, too, lunkhead.&quot; The former, then. &quot;Remember? The giant thinky daisy said so.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It did?&quot; He put a hand to his forehead in concentration. Come to think of it, he did seem to recall standing in front of the Marquis de Sod recently. What had it said?<br><br><i>Based on your field evaluation, and because you currently lack a partner, I have decided to officially assign Agent Knutson with you henceforward. Good luck!</i> Something like that. Possibly with the hint of a maniacal cackle at the end, but he couldn&#39;t be sure.<br><br>&quot;It did,&quot; he had to agree. &quot;So . . . we&#39;re partners now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yep! You are totally stuck with me. How&#39;s it feel?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Like I had too much to drink and agreed to some things I&#39;m going to regret,&quot; he muttered. Stipples of the previous evening were starting to come back—a grin here, a gleam of metal there. A whiff of beer, leather, and sweat.<br><br>Rudi&#39;s. He remembered Rudi&#39;s. Gall had promised to buy him a drink, and she decided to turn it into a celebration of her assignment. Derik wasn&#39;t about to turn down a cup or two after the day he&#39;d had, so he went along with it. Then Gall had nearly gotten into a fight with that tattooed, dark-haired girl, Gremlin, and there was something about a team? Achoo, hairball . . . some sport with an odd name. That was about when the serious drinking had started. Everything afterward was a blur of strangers&#39; faces amid a din of boisterous shouts and laughter. It really had turned into a party of sorts.<br><br>A thought struck him, and he wondered why it hadn&#39;t done sooner. He looked up urgently at his new partner. &quot;Gall, did we—? I mean, last night; I don&#39;t remember. Did we . . . get carried away at all when we came back here?&quot;<br><br>Again, that stare. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br><br>He felt his fist clench of its own accord. &quot;I <i>mean</i>, when we were drunk and stupid and falling into bed together, did we have sex?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, no?&quot; She opened the blanket, showing that she had a loose tunic and leggings on underneath. &quot;Still dressed here. And you&#39;ve got pants on, if you hadn&#39;t noticed.&quot;<br><br>In fact, he hadn&#39;t. And there they were. He let out the breath he&#39;d been holding. &quot;Ah, good.&quot;<br><br>Gall nodded and turned toward the console, but then spun around again. &quot;Hey! Whaddaya mean, &#39;good&#39;?&quot;<br><br>It was Derik&#39;s turn to be baffled. She wasn&#39;t relieved, too?<br><br>&quot;You saying I&#39;m ugly or something?&quot; She raised a fist as high as her waist, warning but not quite threatening—yet.<br><br>&quot;No! I&#39;m saying I like to know who I&#39;m sleeping with, that&#39;s all.&quot; And the fact was, he hadn&#39;t considered anyone that way since he had come here. He wasn&#39;t sure he remembered how.<br><br>&quot;Well, good.&quot; Gall planted her hand on her hip. She seemed about to say something more, but instead she went back to the console. &quot;Yeesh, get a load of this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What is it?&quot; He swung his legs over the side of the cot, but thought better of standing up immediately.<br><br>&quot;Something stupid. Too stupid to deal with on an empty stomach.&quot; She shut off the monitor before Derik could protest. &quot;What&#39;s for breakfast?&quot; <br><br>Fellrazer lifted his head and gave an inquisitive hum at the word.<br><br>&quot;Normally I would just scrounge something up on the mission,&quot; Derik said, regarding the dragon, &quot;but I suppose it will have to wait this time. I&#39;ll be dashed if I know how we&#39;re going to find steady food for him, though.&quot;<br><br>Gall tossed her head dismissively. &quot;Please, like that wasn&#39;t the first thing I figured out when I got here? I know a guy. Come on, get up. You gonna wash again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We should both wash,&quot; he informed her in a tone that brooked no argument. &quot;Would you like to go first, or shall I?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Or</i> we could go together, to save time.&quot; She cocked her hip in a way that suggested this wasn&#39;t just a practical suggestion. &quot;Since we&#39;ve established we can both stand the sight of each other and all.&quot;<br><br>Derik stared a moment. He had thought he was fully awake now, but perhaps his dehydrated brain was still a bit sluggish, because he couldn&#39;t quite get it to accept that this was really happening to him. &quot;No,&quot; he finally said, slowly, &quot;I don&#39;t think the shower is big enough.&quot;<br><br>And just like that, everything was casual again. Gall didn&#39;t miss a beat. &quot;You mean you hog the soap. In that case, <i>I&#39;m</i> going first.&quot; She balled up the blanket and threw it at his cot, only just missing his head, and went to get started. </p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t find it to be too long. I thought of it sooner than he did, but I took it as an indication of how out of it he was that he didn&#39;t think of it until later.

            <p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read Gall last, so I don&#39;t totally remember her personality beyond brashness.  I like what you did with her here, easily standing up to Derik both verbally and (threat of) physically.  Her personality stands out quite a bit to me now, beyond just &quot;generic violent Viking.&quot;  (But, again, I haven&#39;t read her in a while, so apologies if she was already like that.<br><br>I also like what you did with Derik.  In the past, even when he was mourning his dragon, he primarily expressed himself with anger.  I liked seeing him a bit more vulnerable and on the defensive here.  I think I&#39;m respecting him a bit more now, as a result.<br><br>A minor detail: I&#39;m delightfully shocked to see a console <i>finish</i> BEEPing, and start again, <i>multiple times</i>.  Is that a first?  I think that&#39;s a first.  Just goes to show these agents are REALLY, REALLY drunk.  (That poor dragon, though!)<br><br>I don&#39;t quite think I can ship them, though.  I&#39;m not sure I can express why not in words; I just don&#39;t think Derik can quite handle that level of emotional attachment right now.  I think the fact that Gall still has her dragon will be a source of jealousy for Derik, though I think he&#39;ll have a little too much respect (for Fellrazer, if not for Gall) to express it openly.  (What?  shipping speculation doesn&#39;t count as concrit?  Oops!)<br><br>I love Fellrazer&#39;s new name!  It&#39;s got a fantastic, aggressive meaning and sound, without being too much of a clichй.  However, I am going to miss &quot;Bonecrusher.&quot;  I know the change is to keep her more in line with her canon, and &quot;Gall Knutson&quot; doesn&#39;t sound half bad as far as names go, but man.  &quot;Knutson&quot; just doesn&#39;t have the same flair as &quot;Bonecrusher.&quot;  (But I didn&#39;t even participate in the renaming thread because I couldn&#39;t come up with any good ideas on my own, so I can hardly talk anyway.)<br><br>(Also, sorry about screwing up all those Glossary links.  I would have happily fixed them, if you had asked!  I didn&#39;t realize we were doing them differently. :( )</p>

            <p>First, no worries about the Glossary links. At least half of them were my own doing, when the Glossary was new and before I figured out all the reasons it&#39;s better to make a redirect page with the agent&#39;s name if there isn&#39;t one, and I don&#39;t mind undoing the results of my own stupid decisions.

It&#39;s the perfect time to realize he&#39;s going to have to deal with this somehow.<br><br>Going back to the top of your comments...<br><br>Gall is fun. Her base archetype is &quot;schoolyard bully,&quot; and building up facets of her personality beyond that is a challenging balancing act—how to show caring without being mushy, how to express her intellect without getting too intellectual, how to let her be the assertive top-dog type without needing to diminish anyone else... in short, how to make this character who would normally be a one-note antagonist into a likeable human person.<br><br>Derik being mostly angry in the past is my fault. I intended for him to be more unhinged, having sudden wide mood swings from one extreme to another, but writing that in a way that makes narrative sense and doesn&#39;t render him totally unrelatable is <i>hard</i>.

            <p>I don&#39;t get a good sense of your headcanon about Gall.  Is she non-victorian in the sense that nudity and lack of personal space is just a thing?  Is she aware of sex yet?  Does her culture value chastity?<br><br>It was getting me to laugh before I started thinking about this.<br><br>I think Derik is in-line with McCaffrey.

            <p>It&#39;s mostly her individual personality. She&#39;s a self-assured young woman who knows what she wants, and she&#39;s not afraid to go out and take it. She&#39;s 100% hitting on Derik toward the end, but she&#39;s not too serious about it (this time), so she can be cool and brush it off when he doesn&#39;t go for it.<br><br>As for headcanon, though... the HtTYD franchise is family-oriented, so there&#39;s not much to go on about nudity/sexual taboos in Berkian society. The characters (both male and female) certainly aren&#39;t shy about expressing their attractions in the second movie, though, so I&#39;d guess they&#39;re not too uptight about such things.<br><br>On Pern, dragonriders are particularly open-minded about sex, since they get caught up in their dragons&#39; passions and can end up sleeping with someone just because one person&#39;s dragon catches the other&#39;s in a mating flight. (Dragons being so in tune with their riders usually means that completely unwanted encounters don&#39;t happen, though.) It&#39;s a tough adjustment for some people, since some holders do maintain more conservative views, but I think that&#39;s mostly the higher-ranking types who have to worry about succession. Even then, though the custom is for a blood relation to take over when a Lord Holder steps down or dies, it&#39;s not set in stone. If all a Holder&#39;s relations are unfit, the Lord Holder can choose a foster child or someone else entirely who&#39;s proven worthy of the job. ... But I digress.<br><br>Derik&#39;s spin-off follows a mostly self-contained timeline, so even though it&#39;s been years since I last wrote about Earwig, for Derik, it&#39;s only been a couple of months at most since he left. It took him a bit to remember.<br><br>On top of Gall most likely not being a frequent bather, they&#39;re fresh off a long mission and a night of drinking. Neither of them is smelling like roses at the moment. *g*<br><br>Thanks for commenting. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>This is from something I need to rewrite.  If anyone can handle NSFW, I&#39;d love for a rough lookover of the full version to see if it&#39;s even missionable and if I didn&#39;t self-mark any mistakes.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Agent Kimberly Feinstein sat alone in RC 414, filing her nails and cracking her gum.  She was reading an essay on quantum mechanics, but would have denied enjoying it if anyone caught her.  She was human, young adult, and wore her 80&#39;s-style glasses completely un-ironically.<br><br>The console started to beep, and she calmly pressed the accept button.  Normally the alarm was loud, and its volume would have increased if it were ignored for one full minute, but the machine knew that Kim would shove the nail file between its keys if it startled her.  She still gave the console a stern glare and twiddled the file as she tabbed to the intelligence report.  She then paged her partner.<br><br>Five minutes later, Hue burst in.  The sprite was breathing heavily, but his beady eyes were wide in excitement.  <br><br>“For some reason,” Kim lazily pointed her nail file at him without turning around, “we got something worse than a clopfic.  I left the Department of Bad Slash for a reason and I might just ask for a different partner if this keeps happening.”<br><br>Hue gave a series of apologetic squeaks.  He knew that she was disturbed at how a supposed children&#39;s cartoon was inundated with so much mature content, but he was sad that he got paired with someone who had been specifically trained to deal with adults-only subjects.  He slapped a new packet of bleepettes on the console in front of her and shook his flask to indicate that it was full.<br><br>“No need to butter me up, furball, but thanks.”  Kim grabbed the packet as she stood up from the console, and smiled as she shoved it into her bag.<br><br>There was something human within Hue that knew that making her happy would make dealing with her easier, but the main part of his nature was driven to be helpful and serve the needs of others.  Still, he liked it when the New-Yorker openly showed her emotions.<br><br>She finished her last-minute check in under a minute, thanks to efficient planning skills.  “I&#39;m setting it for our usual disguises, are you fine with that?”<br><br>Hue gave the thumbs-up, and they entered the story.  He immediately turned into a gray squirrel, (wearing a Despatch flash-patch on the back of a harness,) but Kim&#39;s unicorn disguise flickered and faded as the setting rejected it.  Neither panicked since this was normal for pony fics that began in the “real” world.  <br><br><hr>
<br><br>Hue turned on the CAD again and pointed it at the ponies. It translated as in-canon 19 percent OOC, which was pretty decent considering the foreign element. He commented on it.<br><br><br>“Intel said that this was bad. Either someone made a mistake, or this story is luring us into a false sense of security.”<br><br><br>Time blinked, and suddenly there was a party in one of the nearby buildings. Kim flinched and said, “That had to be five minutes, tops. Charge for having an instant party.”<br><br><br>Hue squeaked out a refusal.<br><br><br>Kim walked to the door of the building to get a closer look. Again the party was not described, but the world decided that there should be streamers, balloons, and piles of sweets. “How is that even possible?”<br><br><br>“Pinky Pie,” Hue remarked, though he couldn&#39;t pronounce the P&#39;s properly.<br><br><br>Suddenly the pink pony bounded up to the agents. “Hi, I&#39;ve never seen you before. My name&#39;s Pinkie Pie, what&#39;s yours?”<br><br><br>Kim was so shocked that she almost sat down. She wracked her brain and stammered, “Desert Wine.”<br><br><br>“It&#39;s great to meet ya. Come on in, it&#39;s a &#39;Welcome to Ponyville&#39; party for Wolf, he&#39;s the tall one over there. I can throw another party just for you tomorrow.” Pinkie Pie bounced away happily.<br><br><br>Hue squeaked irritatedly.<br><br><br>“She put me on the spot, and my dad won a tidy sum by betting on that horse,” Kim complained as she ducked away from the doorway and found a window to look into. “How did she notice me? Is she a replacement?”<br><br><br>Hue checked the CAD, and assured her that Pinky Pie was mostly in-character.<br><br><br>“At least we&#39;ll have to neuralyse them all anyway,” Kim muttered.<br><br><br>She gazed through the window as “Wolf” met the ponies. Then he decided that he needed to go outside for some air, and Kim hoped that it wasn&#39;t a trend. Fortunately he simply sat there moping until a minty-green unicorn interrupted his thoughts.<br></p>

            <p><b>First impression – part one:</b><br><br>Yes, this feels like the PPC, and it makes me interested in learning to know these agents better. I have already a vivid mental image of agent Kim. Hue’s image is still quite vague, because I don’t know anything about his home continuum, but that’s a general problem with this trans-dimensional setting. I don’t know most non-human agents&#39; home continua, and I cannot expect that everything I should know is cramped into the first paragraphs I read. If you had Permission and wiki pages for your agents, I could look him up there.<br><br>I can only guess what a clopfic is. Can you tell that I’m still new to this fan fiction business?<br><br>I don’t understand why Kim blames her partner for getting this mission, and apparently also for similar missions in the past. Is this explained later? Or do I read this out of context and it should be clear from previous missions/interludes? Also, I wonder whether Hue blames his partner, <i>who had been specifically trained to deal with adults-only subjects</i>. <br><br><b>Details:</b><br><br><i>its volume would have increased if it <b>were</b> ignored for one full minute</i><br>Grammar check says that “were (plural)” should be “was” to match the singular subject. <br><br><i>There was something human within Hue that knew that making her happy would make dealing with her easier, ...</i><br>This sounds awkward. The repetitions (that – that, making – make) are probably what puts me off, but the general problem may be that you try to tell too much about Hue in one sentence. Try to break it up using other words.<br><br><i>Kim&#39;s unicorn disguise flickered and faded as the setting rejected it</i><br>This may contradict PPC canon. I’ve never seen the disguise generator not working because the agents chose a disguise that didn’t fit their target environment (but then agents usually don’t do this). Why don’t you want to make fun of Kim being disguised as a unicorn in the badfics version of the real world? You didn’t post the full mission, but I assume that Kim’s unicorn disguise will just flicker back into existence when the badfic goes to Equestria. Use of a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/DORKS">D.O.R.K.S </a>to achieve this may be more appropriate. The wiki page gives only two references, but I know that D.O.R.K.S . were used in many missions. (Personally, I would prefer to go with the inconvenience of being a cartoon pony in the real world; the D.O.R.K.S . makes things too easy if it isn’t used in a clever way.)<br><br><b>First impression – part two:</b><br><br>You have a formatting problem there. One blank line between paragraphs is good, two are a bit much.<br><br>For proper beta reading, I need a link to the badfic. Otherwise I cannot determine whether it is represented accurately. <br><br>On the other hand, readers should not need to read the badfic, and I’m not sure whether the mission can stand alone. It may need more quotes or more description of what’s going on in the badfic, but that’s hard to tell when I don’t see the full mission.<br><br>I assume that Wolf is supposed to be a trans-dimensional hopper. (But, judging from what you said on another thread, he actually isn’t?)<br><br><b>Details:</b><br><br><i>It<b> translated as in-canon</b> 19 percent OOC</i><br>This is confusing. Why doesn’t the CAD just show that the ponies are 19 percent OOC? My apologies in case I’m not fully aware of the PPC’s canon for Despatch and the CAD would show something else if the ponies had been snatched out of their canon. Or if you try to expand canon to different CAD readings for Hopper and Snatcher scenarios and this doesn’t contradict what’s already established for Despatch. In this case, it should be explained better. What you actually may have done in a part of the mission I didn’t read. But still wondering why it “translated”.<br><br><i>Hue squeaked out a refusal.</i><br>Why? Would I know the reason if I hadn’t skipped the part of the mission that is not posted here? <br><br><i>Hue squeaked <b>irritatedly</b>.</i><br>Spell check says that Hue should be and squeak “irritated” (adjective), apparently there is no adverb form of this.<br><br><i>“She put me on the spot, and my dad won a tidy sum by betting on that horse,” Kim complained ...</i><br>I don’t understand what Kim is talking about. Again, may be caused by reading out of context.<br><br><b>A note on “Despatch”:</b><br><br>Looking it up on the wiki, I don’t like what I see there. It is not in tune with the general gist of the PPC, or at least it is badly worded. So this should be handled with extreme care.<br><br>As far as science knows, real persons lack the ability to hop into word worlds, and Not-yet-an-agent Hieronymus is not Boarder Hieronymus, even if his story is written in first person, present tense. Thus, trans-dimensional hoppers (and snatchers) are neither real persons from the real world, nor are they the authors of their stories. They originate from and need to be returned to &quot;World One&quot;, which is not exactly &quot;Real Life&quot;. If their presence in the continuum they invaded is explained by &quot;wrote themselves in&quot; or if it isn’t explained at all, so that &quot;wrote themselves in&quot; might be assumed, then they may be authors in World One in the same sense as some agents have been fan fiction readers in World One before they were recruited into the PPC. It may be difficult to make this distinction, but, to avoid any appearance of author bashing, I would never call a self-insert character &quot;the author&quot;. <br><br>Also, involving the Legal Department contradicts everything else we know about Legal (which isn’t much). The &quot;Legal Department&quot; here sounds more like the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/SunderingRest.htm">Department of Author Correction</a> that fortunately <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndTrousers.htm">will never exist</a>. But apparently this is not just speculation. It comes from actual missions written before Huinesoron wrote about the other <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legal_Department">Legal Department</a>, so I don’t know what to do about it.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I promised to say something about the Disguise generator, so here we go:<br><br>In TOS, <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission25.html">Mission 25</a> and <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission26.html">Mission 26</a>, Agents Jay Thorntree and Rhus Radicans followed trans-dimensional hoppers from the badfics versions of &quot;real life&quot; to Middle-earth. The assassins were disguised as elves throughout the missions; their disguises didn’t suddenly kick in when they entered Middle-earth. <br><br>But these were DMS missions, not Despatch missions, because the trans-dimensional hoppers were also Sues. So, Despatch may use a special type of disguise generator, which helps agents to fit in better during the real world part of the badfic.<br><br>Unfortunately, <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/megwill/mission02.html">Teddy Bear – Celeste</a> doesn’t support this theory. Agents Meg and Will (Despatch, <i>LotR</i> Division) and Agent Shelley (DIC, <i>LotR</i> Division) were all disguised as elves for the meeting in Middle-earth and they all lost their disguise when they portaled to the crossover’s <i>Sailor Moon</i> part. So it is not specific to Despatch, and the reason is not &quot;being in World One, where they fit in being just themselves&quot;, the reason is &quot;not being in <i>LotR</i>, where there disguise fits in&quot;. Apparently Agents Erica and George (DMS, <i>Sailor Moon</i> Division), being anime schoolboys in <i>LotR</i>, and Agent Nia (DIC, <i>Sailor Moon</i> Division), being a young anime woman in <i>LotR</i> and in <i>Sailor Moon</i>, but actually only twelve years old, used different types of disguise generators, probably a &quot;DG Mark 1&quot; as described in TOS for Erica and George (Meg saw them assuming the disguises when they stepped through the portal) and a &quot;DG Mark 2&quot; for Nia (who was already disguised when she came through the portal).<br><br>Throughout TOS, the disguise generator (&quot;DG Mark 1&quot;) is integrated into the portal generator. The agents step into the portal being themselves and arrive at the other side disguised as whatever they have programmed. This was established in the early missions, when the &quot;portal thingy&quot; was just a remote activator which allowed them to reopen the portal from inside the badfic and return to their RC. Quite naturally, they reassumed their natural appearances when they passed the portal in the opposite direction. Later, things became more complicated, because the &quot;portal thingy&quot;, though it is still called &quot;RA&quot;, evolved into a remote control, allowing the agents to reprogram the portal generator and portal to other places in the badfic or even to leave the badfic in other directions than back to their RC.<br><br>In some spin-offs, we see that agents program their disguise generator and then their appearance changes <b>before</b> they step into the portal. Since we don’t want to call every discrepancy from TOS a mistake, we have to assume that these agents use a &quot;DG Mark 2&quot; which operates independent of the portal generator. This DG may be set to &quot;automatic switch off when the agents return&quot;, or the returning agents may stay disguised until they switch the DG off manually. <br><br>In <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission24.html">TOS Mission 24</a>, Agents Jay and Dee were disguised as dwarves before they went from a <i>LotR</i> badfic into a music video to drop a Sue. They were human in the music video, but this may depend on using a &quot;DG Mark 1&quot;. If the &quot;DG Mark 2&quot; allows the agents to keep the disguise when they return to their RC, they should be able to keep the disguise everywhere. (Other TOS missions are more ambiguous.) <br><br>The agent you refer to is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Amelia_Keaton">Amelia &quot;Lee&quot; Keaton</a> in <a href="http://rc-6237.livejournal.com/5606.html">&quot;The Secret of the Rainbow Wands&quot;</a>. But she doesn’t appear to be surprised in the I-did-not-expect-this way:<br>[They slipped away into a shadowy alleyway between two buildings and opened a portal to the Royal Fanfiction Academy of Equestria. Lee stepped through, levitating the minis&#39; saddlebag with her magic. She retained her pony shape, something that intrigued her. <i>Maybe it&#39;s part of the magic in place here</i>, she thought.]<br>I don’t know the &quot;Royal Fanfiction Academy of Equestria&quot;, but I assume its magic is that, similar to &quot;OFUM&quot;, students who wrote a pony species on their application form are ponies at &quot;RFAE&quot;. Also,  like &quot;OFUM&quot; is located in Middle-earth, &quot;RFAE&quot; is probably located in Equestria. Why should an agent going from a <i>MLP –FiM</i> badfic to &quot;RFAE&quot; disguised as a pony not be able to keep the disguise, even if this is not what happens regularly when an agent leaves a badfic? Lee may not have been entirely sure and was intrigued when it really worked.    <br><br>Coming back to Agent Meg in Despatch, she, Will and Shelley may have used old fashioned &quot;DG Mark Zero&quot;, which were not able to provide a disguise that didn’t fit the environment, but were already outdated at the time.<br><br>Or they may have used prototypes of an insufficiently advanced &quot;DG Mark 3.0&quot; based on the assumption that no disguise is better than a disguise that doesn’t fit the environment. As far as I know, such disguise generators were never seen again. The prototypes were probably scraped when the number of non-human agents increased, because just being your own alien self in a modern World One environment is <b>not</b> better than being a human in anachronistic clothing or even an elf wearing a bandana to hide the pointy ears. The development of a sufficiently advanced &quot;DG Mark 3.1&quot; that would know when to drop the disguise of which agent was prevented by the invention of the more flexible DORKS. Even the hypothetical &quot;DG Mark 3.1&quot; would not be able to disguise Hue as a realistic squirrel in the &quot;real life&quot; part of a badfic and then switch to cartoon squirrel when he goes to <i>MPL – FiM</i>.<br><br>All this said, you may try to explain why your disguise generator is not one of the standard types, or you may use the DORKS to change disguises in mission. Or you may use a &quot;DG Mark 1&quot; or &quot;DG Mark 2&quot;, pretend that your agents don’t know what a DORKS is, and deal with Kim cantering through World One disguised as a cartoonish pony.

            <p>Since the <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/791153/1/PPC_Tales_from_Despatch">&quot;Tales from Despatch&quot;</a> were published twelve years ago, there have been many discussions about what the PPC does and shouldn’t do. I’ve been here for less than a year, so I don’t know all this from first hand, but apparently highly valued members of the community left because they felt no longer comfortable when the PPC as a whole was accused to destroy the hopes and lives of aspiring young authors. Thus, nowadays we try to be very clear about these facts:<br>We are not evil, that’s our dark allies, the OFUs.<br>We don’t want to hurt real people.<br>We certainly don’t want to discourage authors who fail in their attempt to write good fiction.<br><br>The OFUs (pretend to) abduct badfic writers and torture them to teach them better writing. This is unethically cruel, illegal under most jurisdictions, and fun to read or write. It’s acceptable because these &quot;authors&quot; are clearly fictional and the real persons they may be based on voluntarily submitted their overblown avatars to be victims of these procedures.<br><br>The PPC deals with real badfics, whose authors, unlike the author avatars at the OFUs, are really real persons who can be hurt, like you and me. Sometimes we spork our own stories, and in very rare cases, authors submit their shameful past to the PPC, but most authors don’t volunteer for this treatment. This is the reason why I despise the use of the terms &quot;real person&quot; and &quot;author&quot; on the wiki page. It’s the author’s self-insert, not the author, and it is not more a &quot;real person&quot; than any fictional character who is not said to be &quot;unreal&quot; in-story is a real person in the context of the fic. Why would Despatchers bother to take snatched characters back to their home if these characters weren’t real anyway?<br><br>The OFUs’ methods don’t really work. People learn from experience, and the best way to learn writing is to write. (I’m not saying that every writing exercise should be published, but to get concrit you need to show it to somebody.) We may want to arrest or even destroy the trans-dimensional hopper who inserts himself into <i>LotR</i> and <i>Startrek</i> and <i>MLP – FiM</i> and twenty other continua. But for the author of these stories, we can only hope that someday he will get it right and will contribute to the total amount of good fiction that helps to out-weight the bad fiction. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=251789;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Callista may have expressed this better than I can do</a>.<br><br>This said, I would really like to see more Despatch missions. I wish, someday the wiki’s Despatch page could be based on References (6) – (10), saying that &quot;In the early days, some agents didn’t get all their Department’s premises right, like Reference (2) confusing a snatcher and the snatchfic’s author. But the Hydrangea called all agents in to a meeting and set things straight.&quot; <br><br>(Someday, the Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies may try to enter &quot;Sleepover!!! – A Girl Called Bob&quot; and change every occurrence of &quot;author&quot; to &quot;snatcher&quot; to see whether the mission still works just as well. But since this happens behind the creativity shield, it doesn’t affect PPC’s continuity.)<br><br>May it be appropriate to joke about all the other agents thinking of Legal as &quot;sooo mysterious&quot; when Despatchers are in regular contact with Legal’s &quot;Fictional Law Enforcement Division&quot;? May it be appropriate to joke about &quot;Fictional Law Enforcement&quot; now being dysfunctional, because the Legal  Department wanted to be more mysterious? If Legal’s work wasn’t delegated to somebody else (who might this be?), Despatch may just warn the self-inserts that this time, they got away with a forceful decontamination, but next time, they might be forcefully enrolled into the appropriate OFU or, if they act too sueish, the assassins might come after them.<br><br>Reading this first Despatch mission, I now see where you got the idea that a human Despatcher looks human in the fics version of the real world and the disguise only kicks in when the agent enters Middle-Earth or Equestria. I may have to say something more about this, but, you know, there is work to do.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>First impressions: Agent Kim is not entirely likable, but I think that is probably at least partially intentional.

            <p>I could have posted more than I did, but I decided just to go with two big chunks.<br><br>One of the chunks I ripped out was describing Kim as a white unicorn with red hair.

Things go wrong for her a lot, so much that I have to let her win one that I wanted her to lose, or not, I&#39;m still wrestling with those.<br><br>I&#39;ll fix Kim so that she&#39;s a little nicer to Hue.<br><br>A lot of Hue is there in the backstory, and I might do a few other missions with him.  He&#39;s a ripoff of Twink, which means he can speak English, it&#39;s just that Happytalk is more efficient and is a subtle nod to Star Wars.  <a href="http://www.rainbowbrite.net/characters/twink.html"><a href="http://www.rainbowbrite.net/characters/twink.html">http://www.rainbowbrite.net/characters/twink.html</a></a><br><br>Hue normally sounds like RomeoTalk.mp3 but he can do Twink-IllBetRainbowsInThereSomewhere.mp3  <a href="http://www.rainbowbrite.net/sounds/episode_sounds/The">www.rainbowbrite.net/sounds/episode_sounds/The</a> Mighty Monstromurk Menace Part 2/  I do describe his sounds later as &quot;sick teakettle&quot; and &quot;abused squeak toy.&quot;<br><br>I wasn&#39;t planning to make Hue much more assertive, more that his hidden mental problems finally show and getting help makes him unsuitable for Action.<br><br>Pinkie Pie is a forth-wall breaker who I think can set up a party that fast.  I think I did push her ability to break the SEP field too far when she actually talked to them, but I have noticed her glancing at agents when in-character, and the same for Luna Lovegood.</p>

            <p>Agent Feinstein feels like a rather unique character for the PPC.  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve had a brusque secretarial personality in an agent before, and that alone makes her entertaining to watch/read.  At first, I was worried that she was too aloof from things happening around her, since a large source of a mission&#39;s entertainment value comes from what the agents experience.  But you showed that she is stuck facing missions of a type particularly distasteful to her, and that she isn&#39;t necessarily the best at thinking on her feet when she is met with an unexpected encounter.<br><br>That said, she has a personality that feels like it dominates a lot of the action, especially while she and her partner are still in their RC.  Hue isn&#39;t described here beyond &quot;sprite&quot; (although that could just be because this is an excerpt from a larger piece) and communicates more through gestures and actions than through dialogue.  This makes Hue feel like a lesser presence compared to Feinstein, and that, combined with his &quot;helpful and serving nature,&quot; creates a risk of actually turning him into his partner&#39;s servant, which I for one don&#39;t feel is an appropriate relationship for partnered agents to have.  It&#39;s a personal feeling, I admit, but I think agent pairs work best when both parties are on roughly equal terms overall; it would be less entertaining to read a mission that was essentially one character solo, with a &quot;servant&quot; tagging along to carry things for them.  Just something to watch out for.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about what I could do to bolster Hue.  I don&#39;t think that allowing him to talk would really fix anything.  Even if I start thinking of him as a Carebear or a Digimon, there&#39;s still the natural lack of dominance that can&#39;t stand up to a designated complainer like Kimberly.<br><br>I think someone else just had a similar problem with a house-elf.  I think the only type of person Hue could really shine against is someone really mousey and young.  Hopefully I&#39;ll figure out what to do with a team like that.<br><br>But this might also solve the problem I&#39;m having with Larry.  He couldn&#39;t stand up to Samantha as a green recruit, but she&#39;ll be tempered by being the newer agent if I stick Larry with Kim first.<br><br>I&#39;ll still rewrite this with Hue since I like it, but I&#39;ll note that it&#39;ll never leave the out-of-continuity even if any of my other stuff is allowed in.</p>

            <p>This is <i>quite</i> fun.  I love the idea of a computer game (itself a connection both between points in our world and the game world&#39;s canon) serving as the source of a plothole and sucking someone in, and then the published text of the Original Series serving the same purpose to lead to Headquarters.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too short; I generally like a lot of detail, but this particular piece has a good flow from beginning to end, that keeps it easy-to-understand and very direct.  I&#39;m not sure you really want to clutter this up by describing what the internet is like.  On the other hand, though, that could potentially be fun.  Maybe you want to come back to the concept later in your spin-off, and have both agents get trapped there together for a while?<br><br>I don&#39;t think Hieronymous is too rational at all.  He shows clear worry and fear at the recognition of his problem, then focuses his attention to fix it afterwards the only way that could obviously work.  In addition, you began by telling us that Hieronymous had been playing a video game, with someone he potentially cares about a lot, so even in such a short piece, he already comes across as having emotions and interests.  Overall, he feels fairly ordinary, despite approaching his problem from a very logical direction.<br><br>As to quoting TOS, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s strictly necessary here.  It might be fun to do if you expand on this or include the scene of Hieronymous physically entering Headquarters later.  (It would make for a fun reference, for sure.)<br><br>A few grammar notes:<br>&quot;To be precise, I don&#39;t feel my body as well.&quot;<br>*Since &quot;don&#39;t&quot; is a negative verb, &quot;as well&quot; should be &quot;either&quot; since &quot;as well&quot; suggests adding something.<br><br>&quot;This must be a <b>dreem</b>.&quot;<br>*&quot;dream&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hieronymus Graubart, software engineer extraordinaire was sucked into his computer.&quot;<br>*Put a comma after &quot;extraordinaire&quot; since that whole phrase, &quot;software expert extraordinaire&quot; is an extra phrase added to describe Hieronymous.<br><br>&quot;So what did I do wrong.&quot;<br>*Since this sentence is asking a question, it should get a question mark at the end instead of a period.  (Even if it&#39;s just Hieronymous talking to themself and not really expecting an answer.<br><br>&quot;What were all these flashes and sparkles?&quot;<br>*Since this story is in the present tense, &quot;were&quot; should be changed to &quot;are.&quot;<br><br>„Exit-Point“ does not equal „Reality“?<br>*I&#39;m not sure if the placement of the quotation marks here is computer code, or just the German way to do quotes.  In English, quotes go at the &quot;tops of words.&quot;  Also, punctuation should go inside the quotes, so „Reality“? would look like &quot;Reality?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course there is air, stupid, how would you <b>breath</b>!&quot;<br>*&quot;Breath&quot; is the noun name for the air we take in.  You want the verb here, which is &quot;breathe.&quot;<br><br>„PPC Archive. Mission Report 2001/01: Rambling Band.“<br>*Move the quotation mark up to the top.  (Again, I apologize if this is just computer code I&#39;m unfamiliar with.)</p>

            <p>I haven’t planned anything beyond the point when the console beeps and Hieronymus and Androia get their first mission together. But I’m afraid that being sucked through the internet is a singular event. It took tons of willpower to force a reaction from the PPC’s main computer, and in the end, Hieronymus didn’t even get out, he was sucked further in. He definitely doesn’t want to repeat this experience. So I will probably never describe the horrors of the internet.<br><br>Thank you for improving my grammar.<br><br>The opening quotation mark at the bottom is German style. I normally correct this before posting, but since PoorCynic had requested minimal editing and I am unable to ignore a mistake when I see it, I skipped alpha reading and had set spell check off.<br><br>I have to disagree on two points:<br><br><i>What were/are all these flashes and sparkles?</i><br>Hieronymus remembers the flashes and sparkles he has seen immediately after the blue light. But then it is dark, while he ponders his situation and then attempts to move. There are no flashes and sparkles present, so I think <i>were</i> is correct.<br><br><i>&quot;Exit-Point&quot; does not equal &quot;Reality&quot;?</i><br>You became confused by a bad computer interface design. Let me expand the relevant part of Hieronymus’ thoughts:<br>Did I give conflicting directions or is the computer confused about the direction in which I want to move? If I were able to get output from the computer, might a message like &#39;Error: &quot;Exit-Point&quot; does not equal &quot;Reality&quot;&#39; be the result of my actions?<br>The questions are not enclosed by quotation marks, because they are only a part of Hieronymus’ inner monologue; speech marks would enclose the whole story.<br><br>The single quotation marks I omitted in the short version enclose a quote from imagined computer output. Even if this quote were incidentally at the end of the question, it would not include the question mark. <br><br>A generalized form of the error message in the imagined computer output would be: &#39;Error: The value of the variable PRIMARY<em>DESTINATION  does not equal the value of the Variable CONFLICTING</em>DESTINATION&#39;, but in Hieronymus imagination, the computer inserts the variables’ actual values, enclosed by double quotation marks. Obviously the second variable’s value doesn’t include a question mark.<br><br>I redesigned the computer interface. The new version of Hieronymus&#39; fast thoughts – still omitting single quotation marks for the quote from imagined computer output, to avoid further confusion – is now:<br>Confusing directions? Error: [Exit-Point] does not equal [Reality]?<br>Does this work better?<br><br>To become really nerdy, in one of Hieronymus’ commands, EXIT-POINT is in all-caps because it is meant to be a generic name in this made-up programming language; Hieronymus doesn’t know where the Exit-Point is or what its actual name might be.<br><br>Also, if Hieronymus could read the computers output, it wouldn’t be what he imagines. It would be something like <br>&#39;Unable to locate [Reality]<br>Available LOCATOR(s) is/are:<br>1. PPC Archive<br>2. ...<br>3. ...<br>Select LOCATOR<br>Default LOCATOR will be selected in 10...9...8...&#39;<br><br>Unfortunately, Hieronymus doesn’t know that he is expected to select from a list he cannot see.<br><br>My inability to make up other funny locations that may be available was one of the reasons why I chose first person present tense for this.<br><br>Thanks again, your concrit is appreciated.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>First impressions: Oh wow! If this is officially how agent Hieronymus got to HQ, then this is the coolest one I&#39;ve seen. I love it!<br><br>I don&#39;t really know a lot about computers. Purely a computer user, nothing under the hood, but I liked the inclusion of the commands. It is short, but you get a lot of characterization of Hieronymus into it. Initial panic, followed by immediate rational thought and testing of possible solutions, then a sense of wonder at what he found. I don&#39;t believe he was too rational. I saw it as a statement about his personality. That I should expect him to be pretty level-headed and jump pretty quickly to problem solving. If that isn&#39;t the impression you want to give, then he was too rational.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t really long enough to get more than a sense of disorientation and panic. I think real horror would take a longer piece, but I really like what you&#39;ve got here.<br><br>You could quote TOS, but I don&#39;t think it is necessary. Everyone in this audience should be familiar enough with TOS to be able to fill in that blank. Not quoting actually lets people think of their own favorite parts and fill that in for themselves.<br><br>Details: <br><br>[This must be a dreem.] dream<br><br>[ Do the research!.] two punctuation marks</p>

            <p>I ponder over my future agents’ background since I joined the board, but I had never considered to do this part in first person present tense, until I got the challenge (I’m never prepared for these events) and had to put something up within hours.

            <p>This is really a unique and interesting story.  I&#39;d like to know how he managed to get out of the computer.

            <p>Uh, so I started this one here a while ago. You don&#39;t actually need much knowledge of either fandom. It&#39;s.. well, it&#39;s better to read it, actually. All you really need to know is that in this universe, Rose never met the Doctor, and the Doctor probably doesn&#39;t exist. So yeah.<br><p><br>BEEP-BEEP. BEEP-BEEP.<br>A hand shot out from underneath the covers and slammed down hard on the alarm clock’s Snooze Button. The hand flailed about in the air for a moment, before ripping off the sheets, revealing a teenage girl with messy blonde hair. She groaned for a moment, still sleepy, before tumbling out of bed. The room was pink, various shades of it mixed with the slightest bit of purple. She pulled on some clothes- a simple pair of jeans and a white T-shirt. Quickly and efficiently making her bed, she grabbed a pair of shoes off the rack from the corner of the room, and walked out of the room, flicking off the light as she went. A middle-aged woman, still in her pajamas, bustled about the kitchen, making breakfast. She glanced up as the girl stepped into the room, and sat down in a chair. <br>“Morning, Rose,” she told her, and served her some toast. Rose grabbed it and hungrily chowed down. <br>“G’morning, Mum.” <br>She slipped on a jacket, and exited the house. It sat on a slight rise, just above the other houses in the neighbourhood. The sign in front of the arrangement of houses and apartments read, in big, bold letters ‘POWELL ESTATE’. Rose strolled down to the bus stop, and casually waited for a bus to arrive. A few stragglers were seated around the bus stop, but she ignored them, fixated on her mobile phone. A text had just arrived from her friend, and she was focused on replying to her. A bus pulled up, and Rose climbed on, and sat down in a seat, still reading her social media updates. The bus chugged along the road, stopping only to pick up the customary early-morning workers. Rose glanced out the grimy bus window, noting her reflection. She could use a trip to the hair salon, the dye was wearing off, and the brown was showing through. She exited the bus as it pulled up at Henrick’s. She pushed open the glass double doors, and began her job.<br><br>The day passed, as it usually does. Rose showed the customers at the store to the areas that they wanted. She collected cash at the register, and filed reports. At lunchtime, she met up with her boyfriend, Mickey, in the square and they ate together, teasing each other as they did. As the day wound to a close, an announcement came over the Tannoy.<br>“This is a customer announcement. The store will be closing in five minutes. Thank you.”<br>Rose headed towards the exit, and a guard shook a plastic bag at her. She noticed, and took it, telling the guard that she’d deliver it to the Chief Electrician right then. She dashed across to the lift and took it to the basement. It was dark and gloomy down there, and Rose was more than a little spooked. She crept along the darkly illuminated hallway, calling softly.<br>“Wilson? Wilson, I’ve got the lottery money!”<br>There was a noise behind her, and she spun around. There was nothing there.<br>“Wilson! Where are you? This isn’t funny! Wilson?”<br>She rapped for a moment on his office door. There was no reply, but a crash echoed from one of the storerooms. She headed directly for it. <br>“Wilson? It’s Rose.”<br>She carefully opened the storeroom door, and flicked on the lights. There was absolutely no one in there. Shop dummies stood in various states of dress, and boxes were strewn across the room. Wire hangers hung loosely on racks. <br>“Hello?” she called, and made her way across the storeroom, her gaze searching the area. Still, no one. “Is anyone down here?”<br>There was a creak, and she glanced in the direction of it. A shop dummy had been moved. But still, no sign of human life. <br>And that was when the dummies began to move. <br>She backed away slowly, not exactly afraid. It was probably a student prank, after all. But they continued for her, moving slightly unsteadily. Plastic dummies were approaching from all directions.<br>“Yeah, this is really funny,” she informed them sarcastically. “Can you please stop this now?”<br>The dummies didn’t listen, and she was now stuck between a coat rack and the wall. A narrow water pipe pressed at her head. The dummies were surrounding her, and she began to feel slightly afraid. “Who are you?”<br>And then a tiny hand grabbed hers. She looked down, and saw a small boy with spiky blonde hair that seemed to defy gravity, staring at her with piercing blue eyes. He was clutching a stuffed tiger with one hand.<br>“Run!” he told her, and the water pipe exploded. He gripped her arm tightly, and they were off. He tore across the room with inhuman speed, practically dragging her behind him. They reached the lift, and dashed inside. He jabbed the ‘Close’ button frantically, but the plastic shop dummies were advancing. <br>“Get them, Hobbes!” he yelled at the tiger. Rose couldn’t have been entirely sure what happened, but the plastic dummies were suddenly MOVING BACK from the stuffed tiger, which had inexplicably moved across the lift, and then the doors were closing, and a plastic arm lay on the ground next to them.<br>“What?” Rose managed weakly. The boy turned towards her.<br>“Oh, I almost forgot.”<br>He hit her on the head with a rubber hammer. Rose stumbled back, shocked.<br>“What was that-!”<br>She then noticed a tiger standing on two legs, leaning against the side of the lift, and quickly changed tack.<br>“What are you?”<br>“A tiger,” the tiger replied calmly. “Hello. I’m Hobbes.”<br>“A...tiger...” Rose was having trouble getting her mind around this. <br>“What, you were just faced with homicidal shop models, and you’re surprised by a talking tiger?”<br>Rose blinked. “They aren’t homicidal, it was just a student prank... wasn’t it?” She wasn’t entirely sure. What else could it be, though?<br>The boy gave a superior snort, and tossed her the plastic arm from the floor. “Does this feel like a prank to you?”<br>She ran her hands over it. “What in the-”<br>The lift dinged, and shuddered to a halt. Rose stumbled out of the lift, still staring in shock at the boy and his tiger. He gave her a little shove towards the exit at the back, and she immediately started walking.<br>“But what are you doing here?” she asked them.<br>“Trying to get rid of them, of course,” Hobbes told her. He held up an object that looked vaguely like a remote control, but with a lot more buttons. “The controller is around here somewhere, and we’re here to stop the Earth being destroyed.” He glanced over at the boy. “This is the, what?”<br>“Seventy-th time,” he completed. He opened the exit door, and gestured with his hand out the door. “What was your name?”<br>“Rose,” Rose told him. “Rose Tyler.”<br>He gave her a small wave. “Nice to meet you, Rose Tyler. I’m Calvin.” He grabbed the remote control from Hobbes with a swift movement, and held it up, looking slightly deranged. “Run for your life!”<br>With that, he slammed the exit door, leaving Rose and Hobbes staring at the door.<br>“You’d better run,” advised Hobbes. “When he says something like that, it usually means one of three things; one, there’s an immense danger and he’s being all noble and sacrificial; two, he’s about to go work on a birthday surprise for someone and doesn’t want us to see, or three, he’s about to blow something up. Since two is a bit unlikely, we really should move.”<br>“Oh!” Rose exclaimed, and tucked the plastic hand into her belt. “Let’s move, then.”<br>They dashed out into the darkened street, Rose glancing quickly behind her. The looming figure of the Henrick’s building was still standing. Nothing notable had happened. They had reached two blocks over when the explosion occurred. <br>It was spectacular, really. Plumes of red-white flame spurted out of the windows, seemingly in slow motion. The roof collapsed into shreds, the shrapnel flying every which way. <br>“That’s my cue, then,” decided Hobbes, brushing off dust from his fur. He extended a paw to Rose, who shook it tentatively. “It was nice to meet you, Rose. We might see you later, then?”<br>He winked at her, and strode off into the darkness.<br>Did a stuffed tiger just flirt with me? she wondered.<br></p></p>

            <p>I noticed that lot of this is cribbed straight from the <i>Doctor Who</i> episode &quot;Rose,&quot; albeit in written rather than recorded form. This is bad form in two ways. First, it&#39;s vaguely plagiaristic. That&#39;s always a bad thing. It casts your work in a bad light. Fans of the source material are going to notice what you&#39;ve done and call you out on it.<br><br>Secondly, it&#39;s a poor execution of a crossover-alternate universe. Your point of deviation is that the Doctor never met Rose and probably doesn&#39;t exist. If that&#39;s the case, then things should not be proceeding as they are. The Doctor&#39;s existence was a tipping point for a lot of different things. If the Doctor didn&#39;t exist, would the Time War occurred in the same fashion (or even occurred in the first place)? Would the Autons have been forced to come for Earth looking for a new planet? Calvin and Hobbes can&#39;t just be pushed in to substitute for the Doctor. These are characters with radically different outlooks (for the most part). Not to mention that the Doctor is over 900 whereas Calvin is 10ish.<br><br>Some SPaG notes:<br>-- Not technically SPaG, but a tip on formatting stories for the Board. Since paragraphs on the Board aren&#39;t indented, try separating them with extra spaces (a blank paragraph, as it were) to improve readability. When you want to transition scenes, as you do when Rose&#39;s day passes, use some symbols as a break (I like the ~ or * myself).<br>-- &quot;A middle-aged woman, still in her pajamas, bustled about the kitchen, making breakfast.&quot; The second comma following &#39;kitchen&#39; is unnecessary.<br>-- “A...tiger...” There should be a space between the first ellipsis and &#39;tiger&#39;.<br>-- &quot;&#39;Seventy-th time,&#39; he completed.&quot; It is spelled &#39;seventieth.&#39;</p>

            <p>Did you try to compress this to fit it on two pages? On one occasion you forgot to remove the extra blank line that should be below every paragraph :-).<br><br>Is there a reason to capitalise <i>Snooze Button</i>?<br><br><i>Quickly and efficiently making her bed, she grabbed a pair of shoes off the rack from the corner of the room, and walked out of the room, flicking off the light as she went.</i><br>I have to wonder whether she was still making her bed when she grabbed the shoes. Also, <i>off the rack from the corner of the room</i> sounds weird, especially when the word <i>room</i> is repeated within the same sentence. Better: &quot;Quickly and efficiently she made her bed, then grabbed a pair of shoes off the rack in the corner, and walked out of the room, flicking of the light as she went.&quot; This is still a run-on sentence, so you may want to break it up into two sentences.<br><br>Apache Open Office spell check doesn&#39;t know the word  <i>pajamas</i>, not even when I set it to Australian English. Should this be <i>p<b>y</b>jamas</i>?<br><br>I have never read somebody <b>telling</b> somebody a salute. Is this something specifically Australian? <br><br><i>Rose grabbed it and hungrily chowed down. </i><br><i>chowed </i> is apparently Australian. MS Word spell check doesn’t know it, but Apache Open Office does. But I still wonder whether the word &quot;it&quot; is missing between <i>chowed</i> and <i>down</i>.<br><br>The end of the first paragraph seems a bit rushed (if this is supposed to be the end of the first paragraph). Apparently, Rose’s mother, who had been preparing breakfast, saw Rose, sat down, greeted Rose, and served Rose some toast. Rose didn’t return the greeting, never sat down, and finished breakfast within one sentence. Then (second paragraph), she said &quot;Good morning&quot; when she meant &quot;Good bye&quot;. I admit that I’m only vaguely aware of the canons that are crossed over here. Maybe this is just what Rose does, and she is always in a hurry?<br><br><i>At lunchtime, she met up with her boyfriend, Mickey, in the square and they ate together, teasing each other as they did.</i><br>There may be a comma missing behind <i>square</i>, but take this with several grains of salt. I’m not really good at punctuation rules.<br><br>Is there a reason to capitalise <i>Tannoy</i>? (Weird: Apache Open Office does not know this word, but MS Word and my preferred translation site do. Whom shall I trust?)<br><br><i>Rose headed towards the exit, and a guard shook a plastic bag at her. She noticed, and took it, telling the guard that she’d deliver it to the Chief Electrician right then.</i><br>How does Rose know that this bag should be delivered to the Chief Electrician? Reading further, Rose, the Guard, and Wilson (the Chief Electrician?) may share a secret concerning this lottery money. But if Rose follows their conjoint plan, why does she need to say anything? In case some lurker wonders what happens there with the bag? I think it would be more plausible if the Guard had said something.<br><br><i>A shop dummy had been moved...</i><br><i>And that was when the dummies began to move.</i><br>This is confusing (and thus less horrifying than it is meant to be), because that was <b>actually not</b> when the dummies began to move. At least one of them had already moved earlier. This may just be my habit to be overly reasonable (do  you call this &quot;fridge logic?&quot;). For me, it would work better if it was made clear that <i>A shop dummy <b>had been moved</b></i> is what Rose assumed, but not what really happened. Replace this sentence with a sentence saying that Rose saw that a shop dummy was not where it should be, and let the reader assume that the dummy had been moved or guess what else might have happened. Fans will probably guess that the dummy moved on its own (so much I know), but regardless of precognition <i>And that was when the dummies began to move</i> now correctly depicts the moment when Rose realizes that the dummies move on their own.<br><br><i>“Run!” he told her, and the water pipe exploded.</i><br>Do Australians tell everything? This exclamation point looks more like the boy shouted, and shouting seems more appropriate to the situation (or something like hissing, in case he doesn’t want to attract the dummies’ attention by making too much noise).<br><br><i>They aren’t homicidal, it was just a student prank</i><br>This comma should be a semicolon, or it should be a full stop, making this two separate sentences.<br><br><i>“Seventy-th time,” he completed.</i><br>Why not <i>Seventieth</i>? Is this a quirk of Calvin? (I assume it’s the boy completing Hobbes sentence, although it’s not entirely clear.)<br><br><i>“Rose,” Rose told him. “Rose Tyler.”</i><br>This looks awkward. It may be better to replace the second <i>Rose</i> by “the girl”.<br><br>So, putting PoorCynic’s advice bottom-up, I looked at the details first, and here is my overall impression and a radical suggestion:<br><br>While reading the first three(?) paragraphs, I feared I would not be able to get into this, like it happened with Storme Hawk’s story. But then I actually started to care who this girl is, what her life may be like, and how it may change when somebody from this other canon shows up. So you did a good job in an awkward way?<br><br>Since I never watched <i>Dr. Who</i> (I’m much more a reader than a watcher) I cannot be sure about this, but it looks like you try to retell a <i>Dr. Who</i> episode where Calvin and Hobbes take the role of the Doctor – and possibly somebody else? You rush through the opening scenes, eager to get to where the good stuff happens, and not taking the time to explain what may not have been well explained in the original episode in the first place. But in visual media it’s much easier to make the viewers forget that they never really understood why the protagonist is in the place where the good stuff happens.<br><br>I don’t know how significant Rose’s morning routine, lunch with Mickey, and the unexplained lottery money are for the rest of the story. If there aren’t really good reasons to have all this, the story may work better starting in the afternoon, much closer to when the good stuff begins. And it may even fit on two pages :-). <br><br>To introduce Rose, show us what she does on her job in more than two sentences. If the scenes at the bus stop and on the bus are necessary to show that Rose is obsessed with her smart-phone and social media, this may be shoved in when she gets a pause. Then explain why she goes to the basement. If it isn’t out of character, these may be combined: Rose gets into trouble because she is playing with her mobile phone when she should attend to a new customer she didn’t notice, and that’s the reason why she is sent on an extra errant to the basement after working hours.  And from there on, the story rocks.  <br><br>My apologies if you thought I’m poking fun on Australians. I’m actually poking fun on my unawareness of the English language’s variations. Not counting translations, where I often don’t know the authors nationality, I read exactly one book by an Australian author and don’t remember any specifics of Australian English. (For the record, it was <i>The Book Thief</i> by Markus Zusak, one of the best books I’ve ever read.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been avoiding doing so, since I&#39;m not officially taking part in this thread, but it looks like no-one else has seen <i>Rose</i> recently enough to spot it, but...<br><br>This story is, so far, a direct retelling of the episode in question (the first episode in the revived series). As in, it&#39;s a shot-by-shot remake. Rose&#39;s messy hair, the very few lines before she reaches the basement, the lunch-break with Mickey - everything is straight from the episode.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t mind so much - after all, it&#39;s <i>supposed</i> to be a retell - except for two things:<br><br>1/ The retelling is taking a visual medium and describing it shot by shot. That&#39;s not the best way to do this. The intro works on the TV because it&#39;s a high-speed flurry of images set to musi...il we hit the basement. It really doesn&#39;t work as well in written form.<br><br>2/ More seriously... KittyEden, you haven&#39;t really changed <i>anything</i>. Okay, you&#39;ve tweaked lines that absolutely can&#39;t apply any more, but... are you seriously telling me Calvin talks exactly like the Ninth Doctor? “Yes, we can. See, this is us. Swanning off. See ya.” <i>Really?</i><br><br>Not to mention, Rose interacts with the Doctor as if she was talking to an adult. “I told Mickey to chuck that out. You&#39;re all the same. Give a man a plastic hand. Anyway, I don&#39;t even know your name. Calvin, what was it?” Um, Rose, demanding the full name of a small boy who&#39;s following you around is not only creepy, it&#39;s absolutely <i>not</i> the course of action you should be following.<br><br>Furthermore, you&#39;ve removed lines and then failed to account for it. “I&#39;ll tell everyone. You said, if I did that, I&#39;d get people killed.&quot; No, Rose, he actually didn&#39;t. You didn&#39;t have that conversation. You&#39;re thinking of something else.<br><br>I usually make this point regarding the Fellowship of the Ring, but it works just as well in this instance: changing one thing <i>will</i> have knock-on effects. But you haven&#39;t taken that into account, um, at all.<br><br>On the <i>positive</i> side, it&#39;s really well written - which is probably why no-one&#39;s noticed how directly you&#39;ve copied the episode. So well done on that score.<br><br>hS has lightning going off all around and has to turn the PC off</p>

            <p>Pajamas is an acceptable spelling.  Looking things up, I&#39;m American and it&#39;s a regional quirk.  Pyjamas or jimjams might be better for a British canon.<br><br>Chowed down is also something that makes sense to me.  Might again be regional slang that might not fit the fic.</p>

            <p>I really, really like this one!  I&#39;m a big fan of both series and I love well-done crossovers, so it hits all my buttons.  I think you&#39;ve got Rose really in character here, and I love Hobbes sort of flirting with her, it&#39;s surprisingly in-character for him.<br><br>Personally, I don&#39;t think Calvin comes off as being quite manic or overdramatic enough, but there may be reasons for that we haven&#39;t gotten to.  I would say that referring to someone by their full name, exactly how they introduced themselves, is more of a Doctor thing (i.e., &quot;Tallulah with three l&#39;s and an h&quot;); it would feel more like Calvin to just call her Rose.  &quot;There’s an immense danger and he’s being all noble and sacrificial&quot; sounds <i>very</i> British to me for some reason and feels a little awkward coming from Hobbes, but since this is Doctor Who, they might be British as opposed to American.<br><br>Also, I have a feeling that if Calvin was fighting aliens he&#39;d be narrating everything he does, a la Spaceman Spiff, but again, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what you&#39;re going for.</p>

            <p>(Oh, wow, one of the few episodes of DW I&#39;ve actually watched!)<br><br>I like the opening sections, where you just go through Rose&#39;s ordinary routine, lulling the reader into a false assumption that you&#39;re just retelling the episode.<br><br>I&#39;ve only read C&amp;H very sporadically throughout my life (mostly off of university professors&#39; doors).  His speech here doesn&#39;t strike me as being very kid-like, but then, I&#39;m not too familiar with his canon speech; plus, the fact that he regularly fights alien monsters in this story might make him more serious, too.  Hobbes seemed more spot-on, though.<br><br>I guess I&#39;m mostly just saying I wouldn&#39;t have been much use as an actual beta, here.  :(<br><br>Oh, one question about hitting Rose with the rubber mallet.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a reference to something in either of the two canons, and I&#39;m not really questioning it letting her see Hobbes, as it&#39;s just silly enough to work anyway.  But, isn&#39;t rubber a type of plastic?  I&#39;m having trouble researching this, myself, and I just thought you might want to double-check Calvin wasn&#39;t walking around with a material in his pocket that could potentially come to life and attack him.<br><br>-doctorlit definitely doesn&#39;t ship Mickey/Rose&#39;s mom.  because that would be weird!

            <p>I didn&#39;t realise it until you pointed it out, but rubber <i>is</i> a type of plastic, and Calvin had it in his pocket the whole time. 0-0 The general idea was that although children could see Hobbes easily (the definition of &#39;child&#39; being up to about 13 years old) most adults need a good whack on the head to bring them to their senses. And, speaking as a kid here, that is (sadly) true. <br>But, hey, no one&#39;s perfect. Can I just point out that in the actual episode, the Doctor&#39;s shoe soles were probably rubber too. <br><br>Thanks for the ConCrit, and I actually am working on fleshing this out. I&#39;m currently in the middle of rewriting &#39;Aliens of London&#39; and I&#39;m having some pretty fun times writing Hobbes/Rose friendship scenes, including an awesome bit involving a hovercar race. (Calvin, BTW, is off in the Time Machine, screaming at it. It keeps zapping him with electricity). <br>As for Calvin&#39;s seriousness, it&#39;s explained later on in the episode. Although he does have his childish tantrum moments later on... :-)<br><br>Thanks for the feedback!<br>~Kitty</p>

            <p>Have to admit that my first reaction was Doctor Who/Calvin &amp; Hobbes fic? What the...? And I sort of kept that throughout, but this is funny and works in context of what I remember of both canons. (I suppose I am remembering the correct canon of Calvin and Hobbes. I was an avid reader of the Calvin and Hobbes funny in the papers. I may even still have a few of those half page full color Sunday comics clippings somewhere in a folder. We definitely still have a few of the books of Calvin and Hobbes, but I recall that there is a another thread on the Board that I didn&#39;t read, so maybe there is a new Calvin and Hobbes thing and I am evaluating this through the wrong lens.)<br><br><i>Anyway</i>, I thought the intro was a great written version of the first episode of new Who. I loved that Calvin is able to blow up the entire building just like that, and Hobbes winking at her is a great ending place. <br><br>I don&#39;t have a lot of commentary, because this really is a rehash of the first episode up to this point. It does a good job of that, but not a lot of you to go on plot-wise so far. I assume that the further into the story it goes, the further away from the Doctor Who canon it will be. <br><br>I really did start out thinking that&#39;s just crazy, but now I would continue reading this.<br><br>Details:<br><br>Is Snooze Button a capped thing? I don&#39;t really know, but it caught my eye.<br><br>I would prefer that there be a blank line between each paragraph. It&#39;s easier to read that way on a screen. <br><br>[clothes- a simple pair of jeans] Believe this should be a double dash and no space. clothes--a simple</p>

            <p>Starting info: This is based in the Dresdenverse, but as should be quickly apparent it doesn&#39;t take place on the same continent as 90% of the Dresden Files, so it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll be seeing a familiar name or face from the series. Set somewhere between Grave Peril and Changes, I want to try an work with a couple of run-of-the-mill White Council wizards/apprentices who are being slowly drawn into the war with the Red Court, who are also having to deal with the issues of being a student at university. So here is the intro that I&#39;ve got so far, coming in at around the 2 page mark. <br><br><br><br>“Are you sure you can’t get there any faster?” I asked, hoping that the tracking spell I was currently using would get us to where our target was in time.<br><br>“What do you expect?” Rebecca, my partner and current driver of the car, replied. “It’s a Saturday, at the start of the summer holidays, the sun’s out and we’re in Brighton. Of course the roads are going to be full.” I could tell she was just as frustrated as I was, slowly crawling along the main road into, and out of town.<br><br>“Touche.” I replied. Looking back down at the spell I currently had laid out on a piece of card on my lap. “Good news, he seems to have stopped, just up ahead on the left.”<br><br>“Peter?” Rebecca asked, slightly nervous.<br><br>“Yeah?” I replied, looking up briefly and wondering what was wrong.<br><br>“You know how you said you wouldn’t mind having a fight on campus one day?”<br><br>“Mmm” I could sense where this was going, and, actually looking around outside of the car I saw I was right.<br><br>“It’s your lucky day.” Rebecca said, smiling as the queue moved forward a bit, just enough so she could pull into the bus lane and accelerate towards the Uni, earning a few honks on the way.<br><br>_________________________________________________________________________<strong><em><br><br><br>I should have started somewhere near the beginning, at least then I wouldn’t need this over cliched thing where I introduce myself. So, my name’s Peter T.B Williams, no you don’t need to know what the T and the B stand for, I’d rather not have someone conjuring my name. I’m a student at Brighton University alongside my girlfriend and fellow wizard, Rebecca. We’re members of this thing called the White Council, which is basically a collection of wizards from all around the world who generally try to stop bad stuff from happening, of course it’s a bit more complicated than that but such things always are. <br><br>Knowing most people, you probably want to know more about us, and to be perfectly honest, there’s no real reason why I’m not allowed to tell you. I stand at a tad of six six, messy brown hair that always seems to want to defy gravity, two normally neatly trimmed sideburns run down the sides of my face. Rebecca and I always argue over the colour of my eyes, but I say they’re Hazel so it might as well stick here.<br><br>Talking of Rebecca it might be a good idea to properly introduce her as well, after all you’ll be seeing, or rather reading, a lot of her. She’s a tad shorter than me at only six foot, yeah it’s tall for a girl but still. Her hair normally changes colour every so often although she seems to have stuck with blue for now, probably something to do with matching her eyes. <br><br>As normal when we’re doing wizarding stuff we’re wearing our standard wear, leather jackets with half a dozen or so spells woven into it, blue jeans, trainers and a white T-shirt, it does make us look like something out of the cast of Grease, but that’s half the reason we chose it.<br><br>I should probably get back to the story before someone complains about me taking so long describing everything.<br><br></em></strong>_________________________________________________________________________<br><br><br>So there we were, standing outside our university, not somewhere we’d normally be on a Saturday afternoon, but circumstances had called for our plans to be changed. My tracking spell was only so good and so having got us to the campus I’d ditched it, breaking the small circle on the card to do so. <br><br>“You’d of thought he’d of made more of a mess of the place” I observed, looking around entrance to the main building which, besides from the lack of people, looked just like it did on any normal weekday, or any other day I suppose but the amount of times I’ve gone to or by Uni in the weekends is none. <br><br>“Probably doesn’t want attention, and it’s likely he’s in his human form now.” Rebecca guessed, before saying out loud what I was thinking “Which means we can’t just follow the trail of destruction like normal.”<br><br>“Shame.” I agreed. “But where would a Hexenwolf go to in the University of Brighton, and for that matter why the Uni?”<br><br>“Weak threshold, not many people there, hoping the traffic would hold us up?” Rebecca guessed again. “Not that the why matters at the moment, especially seeing as some people work on a Sunday.”<br><br>“Right” I said, turning more serious. “We don’t want to split up for this one, we can’t take it alone. So which building should we take?” Like I said, we may have been on the White Council but it didn’t mean we were powerhouses. <br><br>“Cockroft’s got more people in it I’d guess.” Rebecca said, “Also only building that’s actually open at this time on a Sunday.”<br><br>I glanced at her, “You’ve been here on a Sunday?” <br><br>“Once.” She replied, “Needed to get some coursework done and couldn’t concentrate at home. Ended up taking out half the machines in the computer pool before I decided to stop stressing out the technicians and finish it elsewhere.”<br><br>“Ah.” I said, nodding. “So, time to take on a Hexenwolf?”<br><br>“I believe it is.” Rebecca smiled, pulling a blasting rod out from her leather jacket. “Let’s get going.”<br></p>

            <p>I think that you have the general writing style of the Desdenverse pretty close. That being said, Williams&#39; internal narration -- a bit snarky and rather genre-aware -- skews a bit too close in tone to Harry Dresden&#39;s own narration (or least how Dresden&#39;s was up to <i>Blood Rites</i>, which is as far as I&#39;ve gotten in the series so far). Admittedly the Dresedenverse is a continuum filled with snarky and vaguely clever people, but it&#39;s something you should keep in mind to avoid creating a &quot;Like Harry Dresden but _<strong><em>&quot; kind of character.<br><br>Rebecca has a sudden mood swing from nervousness to satisfaction in the first section (between the fourth and eighth paragraphs). It&#39;s also not really explained why she has cause to be nervous, especially considering her confident &quot;Let&#39;s get &#39;em&quot; attitude throughout the rest of the piece.<br><br>If they are both Dresdenverse wizards, how are they driving a car without any problems? Dresdenverse magic and technology don&#39;t mix, or at least not without a lot of wheezing and sputtering. The stories suggest that most wizards aren&#39;t involved with the modern world for exactly that reason, and that Harry&#39;s something a strange cause because he does exactly that.<br><br>Is there a reason they&#39;re both so tall? Canonically, I mean. I know Harry&#39;s extremely tall but I wasn&#39;t sure if that applied to all Dresdenverse wizards. 6&#39;6&quot; means that Williams is as tall as Dolph Lundgren and Michael Jordan. There&#39;s nothing wrong with them being so tall; I was just wondering why.<br><br>&quot;Like I said, we may have been on the White Council but it didn’t mean we were powerhouses.&quot; Except you didn&#39;t mention that they weren&#39;t powerhouses before this point, only members of the White Council. &quot;Like I said&quot; does not work in this case.<br><br>SPaG notes:<br>-- The first non-dialogue sentence in the piece (&quot;I said, hoping that the tracking spell...&quot;) has a lot of unnecessary words that make it awkward to read. An alternative might be &quot;I asked, hoping silently that my tracking spell would get us to the target in time.&quot;<br>-- You do not need to capitalize &quot;hazel&quot; when you are talking about Williams&#39; eye color.<br>-- Whenever you transition from dialogue to narration with &quot;</em></strong>__ said,&quot; there should be comma separating the two lines rather than a period. (&quot;&#39;It&#39;s your lucky day,&#39; Rebecca said&quot; or &quot;&#39;Shame,&#39; I agreed.&quot;)<br>-- Don&#39;t use &#39;of,&#39; use &#39;have&#39; in the second paragraph of the final section. &quot;You’d <b>have</b> thought he’d <b>have</b> made more of a mess of the place.”<br>-- There are a lot of run-on sentences in the piece. More than could really be addressed effectively in this thread post. If you would like for me to lay them all out, I would be more than happy to do so in a medium that would support it (like in a Google Docs or something similar).</p>

            <p>I like the set-up of this selection: the way it begins in action, cuts to some very informative but entertaining description, and ends on the promise of further action.  Peter&#39;s narrative voice is almost conversational, helping to provide both him and Rebecca with personality in the midst of an action sequence.<br><br>I like that we&#39;re told Rebecca and Peter are in a relationship, but that they continue to focus on the task at hand without getting romantic with each other, showing the dedication to their work.  You did a good job of including details of the magic the characters use and the nature of the monster they&#39;re chasing without cluttering up the narrative action with immediate explanations, but still giving enough details for the reader to understand what&#39;s going on.<br><br>Some errors:<br>&quot; . . . slowly crawling along the main road into, and out of town.&quot;<br>*I think you want to get rid of the comma after &quot;into,&quot; since that whole phrase is just describing the road.  As it is, it sounds to me like the car is driving out of town on the rod into town.  (Against traffic!)<br><br>“&#39;Touche.&#39; I replied. Looking back down . . . &quot;<br>*Both of these periods should be commas; otherwise, this is a series of run-on sentences.<br><br>“&#39;Mmm&#39; I could sense where this was going . . .&quot;<br>*A period after &quot;Mmm,&quot; since the following sentence can stand by itself.<br><br>“&#39;It’s your lucky day.&#39; Rebecca said . . .&quot;<br>*Change the period to a comma.<br><br>&quot;I should have started somewhere near the beginning, at least then I wouldn’t need this over cliched thing . . .&quot;<br>*Both these sentences have a subject and verb, and could stand alone.  They need to be linked with a semicolon instead of a comma (or use a period and split them up).<br>*Also, adverbs that don&#39;t end in -ly need a hyphen to link them to an adjective.  So, &quot;over cliched&quot; should be either &quot;over-cliched&quot; or &quot;overly cliched.&quot;<br><br>I notice there are a couple more sentences like this in this background info section.  If this is a part of Peter&#39;s speech/thought/narration pattern, then they&#39;re fine and I apologize; if not, then you&#39;ll want to take a look at each sentence there and see if they need to be connected differently, as I described for that previous sentence.<br><br>&quot;. . . it’s a bit more complicated than that but such things always are.&quot;<br>*Since these are full sentences linked with &quot;but,&quot; you need a comma after &quot;that.&quot;<br><br>“I stand at a tad of six six, messy brown hair that always seems to want to defy gravity, two normally neatly trimmed sideburns run down the sides of my face.”<br>*”Tad” is an adverb, and needs to describe an adjective or verb.  I think you meant either “a tad less than” or “a tad more than.”<br>*Since “stand” is the verb at the beginning of the sentence, it applies to each phrase for the rest of the sentence if those phrases have verb of their own.  In other words, this sentence is saying, “I stand messy brown hair,” and “I stand two normally neatly trimmed sideburns.”  (Which is especially weird for the last phrase, which is actually a full sentence.)  You need to throw in the verb “have” (or whatever) before the second claus.  It might be easiest to split the height sentence off on its own, then have second sentences talking about the head hair, using the verb “have,” with that second clause linked with a semicolon or changed so that it can keep the comma and mooch of the “have” at the beginning.<br><br><br>“. . . but I say they’re Hazel so it might as well stick here.”<br>*”Hazel” doesn&#39;t need a capital “h” (unless this is a Dresdenverse thing).<br>*A comma after “hazel.”<br><br>“Talking of Rebecca it might be a good idea to properly introduce her as well, after all you’ll be seeing, or rather reading, a lot of her.”<br>*I usually hear the phrase “speaking of” rather than “talking of.”<br>*Since “Speaking of Rebecca” is an incomplete clause, it needs a comma after “Rebecca” to attach to the rest of this sentence.<br>*A comma after “all,” for the same reason.<br><br>“. . . yeah it’s tall for a girl but still.”<br>*A comma after “girl.”<br><br>“Her hair normally changes colour every so often although she seems to have stuck with blue for now . . .”<br>*A comma after “often.”<br><br>“As normal when we’re doing wizarding stuff we’re wearing our standard wear, leather jackets with half a dozen or so spells woven into it, blue jeans, trainers and a white T-shirt, it does make us look like something out of the cast of Grease, but that’s half the reason we chose it.”<br>*This is a really big and complex sentence; even if this is the way Peter think-narrates, I would suggest splitting this one up with a period after “T-shirt.”<br>*I would also put a comma after “stuff” to help break up the flow more.<br>*As the title of a major published work, <i>Grease</i> should be italicized.  On our Board, that&#39;s Grease but with no spaces inside the s.  (Same works for bold and underlines  )  Incidentally, <i>Grave Peril</i> and <i>Changes</i> in the author&#39;s note should also be italicized (assuming those are novel titles).<br><br><br>“&#39;You’d of thought he’d of made more of a mess of the place&#39; I observed, looking around entrance to the main building which, besides from the lack of people, looked just like it did on any normal weekday, or any other day I suppose but the amount of times I’ve gone to or by Uni in the weekends is none.”<br>*This is another big, honking sentence that should be split up.  I suggest a period after “main building.”  Then, “(either “Aside from” or “Besides”) the lack of people, it looked . . .”<br>*The “of”s at the beginning should be “have”s. (“You would have,”  “he would have.”)  “Have is part of a verb, but “of” isn&#39;t.<br>*You forgot “the” in front of “entrance.”<br>*The phrase, “I suppose” needs commas around it, since it&#39;s being inserted in the middle of another sentence.<br><br>“&#39;. . . and it’s likely he’s in his human form now.&#39; Rebecca guessed, before saying out loud what I was thinking &#39;Which means we can’t just follow the trail . . .&#39;”<br>*Change the period after “now” to a comma, and add a period after “thinking.”<br><br>“Shame.” I agreed. “But where would a Hexenwolf go to in the University of Brighton, and for that matter why the Uni?”<br>*The period after “Shame” should be a comma.<br>*”for that matter” should be surrounded by commas.<br><br>“&#39;. . . especially seeing as some people work on a Sunday.&#39;”<br>*At this point, you have switched from Saturday to Sunday.<br><br>“&#39;Right&#39; I said, turning more serious.”<br>*A period after “Right.”<br><br>“Like I said, we may have been on the White Council but it didn’t mean we were powerhouses.”<br>*A comma after “Council.”<br><br>“&#39;Cockroft’s got more people in it I’d guess.&#39; Rebecca said, &#39;Also only building that’s actually open at this time on a Sunday.&#39;”<br>*Commas after “it” and “guess.”<br>*”the” between “Also” and “only.”<br>*Heh heh.

            <p>I&#39;m confused about the timing.  They went there on a Saturday afternoon and then talk about it being Sunday?  Did they have to find him and then risk loosing him by waiting until the next day?<br><br>I got a little bit tripped up in the description part.  Are there tense shifts?  It might just be the informal voice.  Take the s off of leather jackets to make each outfit singular, or replace it with them and add s to t-shirt to make both outfits plural.  Ignore if this is a quirk of British English.<br><br>I don&#39;t know much about the Dresden universe, but this is friendly to that.  Another sentence describing the spell on the card might allow non-fans to see what it looks like.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading through it<br>1. Yeah, the Sundays are meant to be Saturdays I just didn&#39;t realize until after I posted it. Sorry about that. <br>2.

            <p>First impressions: I like the tone. It fits well with the tone of the series. Sort of wry and the narrator frequently speaking directly toward the audience. It&#39;s part of why I like the series, so this is a good thing in a Dresden files fic.<br><br>It hadn&#39;t dawned on me until they mentioned it about the gremlins with electronics issue and at least semi-modern University. (It&#39;s been a while since I read any Dresden verse stuff)<br><br>I like their outfits. Wizards do seem to have sort of unique styles in the series. I don&#39;t know enough to know if a Hexenwolf is canon or not? If not what I&#39;ve heard so far makes it sound like a good monster for the verse.<br><br>Second pass: <br><br>[slowly crawling along the main road into, and out of town.]  The end of this sentence feels off to me. Maybe the last comma isn&#39;t needed?<br><br>“Touche.” cliched --Missing special characters<br><br>[over cliched thing] I think this needs a dash between over and cliched]<br><br>[I stand at a tad of six six,] missing word<br><br>[two normally neatly trimmed sideburns] This feels like too many -ly words in a row. <br><br>[ yeah it’s tall for a girl but still.]  missing comma before but. I think. Get a second opinion on anything I say about commas.<br><br>I just realized that at the beginning of the last section, they are saying it is Saturday and later they say it is Sunday.<br><br>[looking around entrance to the main building]  looking around /the/ entrance<br><br>[Cockroft’s ] I am assuming this is a real building name there, but I am immature and it makes me laugh.<br><br>Definitely get anything I mention that involves SPaG double checked, but those things caught my attention as not sounding/looking right. Some of it could also be Brit/American differences that I don&#39;t yet know to ignore.<br><br>Overall, very good beginning, and it has hooked my interest. I would like to read more of it.</p>

            <p>I realize no one else probably knows these characters, or this fandom, but the basics are this: Every 24-25 years the Troubles return to the town of Haven. The Troubles are like supernatural abilities that you don&#39;t want, can&#39;t control, and are very likely to cause great suffering and/or death to you or those around you (unless you are very lucky and get one that only cause inconvenience to yourself). Troubles come in every possible flavor from your sweat contacting someone else turning them into a mummy to all food you touch turning into wedding cake.<br><br>Nathan&#39;s Trouble is that he can&#39;t feel pain, pressure, hot, cold-basically any info he should get through his nerves is absent during the Troubles. He&#39;s Chief of Haven PD. <br><br>His partner is Audrey Parker, who is immune to the Troubles, so Nathan can feel her touch. Duke Crocker is a smuggler and bar owner, who helps them deal with the Troubles. He&#39;s a pretty decent guy as an adult. He and Nathan are frenemies at the time this is set (late season 2). Duke used to torment Nathan when they were kids, the most notable event being Duke inciting a bunch of kids to see how many tacks they could stick into Nathan&#39;s back before he noticed the blood dripping off him. Then sending him to talk to a girl he had a crush on when he didn&#39;t notice.<br><br>Warning this story has some mild cussing and talks quite a lot about bullying. This is the opening scene for a Haven fanfic. It is under two pages on Gdocs (barely). <br><br>Later they will realize that someone has a Trouble that is affecting bullies and their victims, so I am fully aware that they are somewhat out of character in this scene. Evaluate Duke from the perspective that something is influencing him to be increasingly penitent/desiring to be punished for his past actions, and Nathan is being influenced toward carrying out the revenge he couldn&#39;t when he was a kid, though the influence on him is not as strong (possibly because of Audrey).<br><br>I am generally not great at SPaG. Commas especially kill me.<br><br><br><br>_____________________________________<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Nathan.&quot; Duke pressed a folded stack of papers into my hand.<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; It wasn&#39;t like Duke to apologize for anything.<br><br>&quot;For everything on that list. I&#39;m sorry I did those things to you. I was wrong, an ass, a jerk. When we were kids I made your life miserable. Obviously, I can&#39;t take it back, and I&#39;m not asking forgiveness or understanding, but I wanted you to know that I know what I did.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That sounds rehearsed.&quot; Why had I let Parker convince me to come to the <i>Grey Gull</i>?<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a Hallmark card that says, &#39;Sorry I bullied you when we were kids.&#39; But I thought it might, you know, help if I admitted to it.&quot; Duke retreated to the end bar stool with a shot glass and a bottle of whiskey. <br><br>I looked at the papers. He&#39;d listed shitty things he&#39;d done to me as a kid. I glared at his back. How the hell had he even remembered all this? I had even forgotten some of these.<br><br>Parker came around the table and leaned over my back to read, her chin pressing against my shoulder made a sharp focal point against the normal blankness of my body. It had a grounding effect that I didn&#39;t really want. <br><br>After reading over the entire list--and it took a long time as Duke had detailed his transgressions in a tiny script over several pages--I realized that he left off the thing that started it all. I jumped up, fast enough to knock Parker off balance, and marched over to Duke. The bottle was nearly empty, and I wondered if it had taken me that long to read the list, or if he was drinking that fast. A glance, and maybe it had taken me that long, because the three of us were alone.<br><br>I pushed the list across the bar to him, barely holding in check a vengeance-demanding anger like I&#39;d not felt since we were ten years old. &quot;You left off the first time.&quot;<br><br>Parker came up behind me and stared at Duke, waiting for him to answer. Guilt, anger, and something else flashed across Duke&#39;s face, but he said nothing. <br><br>Parker touched my bare arm, and that grounding effect hit me again, pulling me back from anger that I suddenly saw was out of proportion to the time. I&#39;m not that kid anymore. Dimly, it even entered my thoughts that I know now that Duke&#39;s father was a bastard and Duke, as a kid, fit certain unpleasant profiles that cops look for when the parent&#39;s are that kind of asshole.<br><br>&quot;What happened, Nathan?&quot; Parker&#39;s question pulled me even further toward my normal control.<br><br>She moved her hand and the veil of righteous anger fell over me again. &quot;He broke his hand punching me.&quot; Duke still refused to make eye contact. Guilty bastard. <br><br>&quot;Just like that? One punch and his hand was broken?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I jumped on him after he punched me. I was out for months recovering from the sledding accident and learning how to function with my Trouble. I had only been back at school for two days.&quot; That moment had started years of bullying that still hurt, even if we were something approaching friends now. &quot;Before that I thought Duke was my friend.&quot; <br><br>Duke muttered, &quot;Didn&#39;t break my hand punching you,&quot; as he added it to the list anyway.<br><br>It hit my nerves like it was every excuse he had ever used to weasel his way out of trouble, and, by God<i>know</i> you broke it.&quot;<br><br>“You stepped on it. I deserved it, though.” <br><br>He was lying. I could see it in his face. I should have known this was just another trick. I resisted the urge to look in the mirror to check my back for tacks. “Why me?”<br><br>Duke poured another shot of whiskey and drank it in one gulp. Then he stood up and leaned into my space; poked a finger at my chest. “Because <i>you</i> were an easy target. Because face it, I <i>enjoyed</i> talking people into doing what I wanted them to do. I still do.”  <br><br>I wasn&#39;t looking down, so I couldn&#39;t tell if he was actually touching me or not, and it made me even madder. I knocked Duke’s arm away, but something was slowing me down, telling me that this wasn&#39;t right, and it kept my fists at my side. Then Duke threw a punch at my gut, doubling me over with the suddenness of it. I saw spots and heard my breath whistling, but felt no pain to slow down my reaction. I came back up, tackling him to the ground, wanting nothing more than to hurt him, because he <i>could</i> feel it. Suddenly Parker was there, hands on my face, and I felt that. It pulled me back. I was still mad, but the veil was gone. <br><br>Duke hadn&#39;t even struggled since we went down, and that had to be a first in one of our fights. I cuffed him and hauled him up. He shook his head and said, &quot;Now see. This is a problem, because I really planned on getting my ass kicked tonight, then crawling off alone. You arresting me is just all kinds of messing with those plans.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not going to hit you.&quot; And just like that, I&#39;m thirty-five again. In control, the anger of my ten-year-old self lost to the years. <br><br>Duke started to speak a few times, but finally, his shoulders slumped and his chin fell to his chest. &quot;Fine. I&#39;ll go quietly. I deserve to be locked up after everything I&#39;ve done.&quot;<br><br>I shook my head, but put him in the truck. He&#39;d surely sleep whatever this was off and be back to his normal obnoxious self by morning. <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>I can&#39;t comment on the canonical accuracy of the characters involved (maybe soon, though -- <i>Haven</i> is currently in my Netflix queue) but I can say that you did a good job of laying out the story in a compelling way.<br><br>The very brief fight scene between Nathan and Duke felt a bit strange to me in terms of its pacing. First off, I feel like it should have its own paragraph starting right after Nathan knocks Duke&#39;s hand away. A good rule of thumb I&#39;ve observed is that scenes with a lot of action should have less compound sentences due to how commas induce pauses. Something like &quot;Duke suddenly lashed out with a fist to my gut. I could hear the breath whistling out of my lungs.&quot; or similar. Returning to longer sentences starting with &quot;Suddenly Parker was there&quot; indicates both that the fight is over and that Nathan has returned to his normal state of mind.<br><br>Finally, some SPaG notes.<br>-- There does not need to be a comma following &quot;Obviously&quot; (&quot;Obviously I can&#39;t take it back&quot;) in the fifth sentence of the third paragraph.<br>-- There does not need to be a comma following &quot;the list&quot; (&quot;...that long to read the list or if he was drinking that fast.&quot;) in the third sentence of the eighth paragraph.<br>-- There does not need to be a comma following &quot;Parker touched my bare arm&quot; in the first sentence of the 11th paragraph.<br>-- The 17th paragraph seems to be missing some words (specially, the transition between narration and dialogue).<br>-- There does not need to be a comma following &quot;I deserved it&quot; (“You stepped on it. I deserved it though.”) in the 18th paragraph.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know anything about <i>Haven</i>, but your introduction at the beginning seems to have covered everything that needed covering for me to follow your fic. (It&#39;s also gotten me interested in checking out the show if I can find it on Netflix or something.) I only regret that I couldn&#39;t read the fic intro without the plot being spoiled first.<br><br>In short, I think this is pretty good. I can&#39;t comment much on characterization, but the interactions between Nathan and Duke work well, and I think people who know them will be interested to see why they&#39;re behaving oddly.<br><br>Audrey&#39;s presence seems a little vague, though, like she doesn&#39;t quite exist except when she&#39;s touching Nathan. I&#39;m not sure what prompts her to do it when and how she does, either (aside from the plot needing it). Does she normally touch him frequently in the show? Are they an item? In particular, it strikes me as odd that she grabs his face to break up the fight. Getting between one guy and another guy&#39;s fists is generally a bad plan, so why would she do that as opposed to grabbing him by the arm or the shoulders or something, especially if she doesn&#39;t yet know the effect she&#39;s having on Nathan&#39;s anger?<br><br>On a related note, the position of Nathan and Audrey in the setting isn&#39;t established until they go over to Duke (who is on the end bar stool). I know they&#39;re at a table, since Audrey comes around a table to look over Nathan&#39;s shoulder, but establishing where she and Nathan are early on would help give Audrey a bit more presence and help the readers visualize the scene more clearly. If they have a usual arrangement at a usual table, just putting in a reference to that would probably be enough for fans.<br><br>Out of curiosity, how deep does Nathan&#39;s Trouble go? It&#39;s basically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_sensory_and_autonomic_neuropathy#Type_2.2C_Congenital_sensory_neuropathy">this</a>, right? I started wondering when he reacted to being punched by doubling over, which I think is at least partly a reflex. Is it just the sensory nerves in his skin that don&#39;t work? What about proprioceptors in his muscles and joints, responsible for the brain&#39;s ability to know where one&#39;s body parts are in relation to each other? Or specific receptors related to sight, hearing, smell, and taste (it seems like he has those)? What about the ones responsible for regulating his internal body temperature, heartbeat, blood pressure, smooth muscle contractions, etc.? Those pretty much <i>have</i> to work, or he&#39;d die.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m overthinking it. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>Anyway,</sup></sup> SPaG stuff. Overall, the SPaG looks pretty good to me, but I did catch a few things:<br><br>* A comma splice: &quot;Parker came around the table and leaned over my back to read&gt;&gt;&gt;,<br>This could be fixed either by using a semicolon instead of the comma or by splitting this into two sentences.<br><br>* Evil As: &quot;and it took a long time <u>as</u> Duke had detailed his transgressions in a tiny script over several pages&quot;<br><br>This is a pet peeve of mine. {= P &quot;As&quot; means either you&#39;re comparing one thing to another (&quot;good as gold&quot;) or you&#39;re describing things happening simultaneously (&quot;the rooster crowed as the sun rose&quot;). Here, you mean <i>because</i>, so it&#39;s best to simply say <i>because</i>.<br><br>(Also, there should be a comma after &quot;time.&quot;)<br><br>* Confusing: &quot;A glance, and maybe it had taken me that long, because the three of us were alone.&quot;<br><br>Whose glance? At what?<br><br>* Clunky: &quot;Dimly, it even entered my thoughts that I know now that Duke&#39;s father was a bastard&quot;<br><br>Could do with fewer words. Maybe something like, &quot;Dimly, I even recalled learning that Duke&#39;s father was a bastard&quot; etc.<br><br>* Misplaced apostrophe: &quot;when the <u>parent&#39;s</u> are that kind of asshole&quot;<br><br>Should be &quot;parents,&quot; plural.<br><br>* I don&#39;t even know: &quot;and, by God<i>know</i> you broke it.&#39;&quot;<br><br>I checked to see if this was an HTML error, and it doesn&#39;t look like it. This line got mangled somehow, though.<br><br>* Possible missing comma: &quot;Because face it&quot;<br><br>Normally you&#39;d put a comma after &quot;Because&quot; here. If it&#39;s left out on purpose to show he&#39;s really not pausing there, though, disregard.<br><br>* Confusing word choice: &quot;I <u>cuffed</u> him and hauled him up.&quot;<br><br>I realized you meant &quot;handcuffed&quot; when I read further, but I wasn&#39;t immediately sure whether Nathan wasn&#39;t cuffing him upside the head or something else. Easily fixed by saying &quot;handcuffed&quot; instead of just &quot;cuffed.&quot;<br><br>* Some kinda punctuation thing: &quot;Now see. This is a problem&quot;<br><br>Is &quot;Now see&quot; a question: &quot;Now, see? This is a problem ...&quot; ? Or, is it more like &quot;Now see, this is a problem ...&quot; ? I don&#39;t know the character&#39;s voice, so I don&#39;t quite know the best way to write this. It might be what you&#39;ve already got. {= )<br><br>Aaand that&#39;s it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You should definitely watch Haven!! The first three seasons are on Netflix. Season 4 is not hard to find online, and it was renewed for a double sized season 5 to be aired half this fall and half next spring. <br><br>I&#39;ve been watching Farscape, and you were right. It is a great show! I&#39;m almost halfway through season three right now. <br><br><br>I will have to remember the rule about as. I think I do that a lot.<br><br>Doc hit on the glance one, too. Here it is revised. <br>[I glanced around. Maybe it had taken me that long, because the three of us were alone.]<br><br>[Dimly, I recalled that Duke&#39;s father] is fewer still, does it still work?<br><br>The mangled sentence, I am blaming on my kitten that is completely obsessed with walking on my keyboard and then on myself for not noticing what he had changed. Here is what was supposed to be there.<br><br>[It hit my nerves like it was every excuse he had ever used to weasel his way out of trouble, and, by God, did it piss me off. &quot;Your arm was in a cast for weeks. I <i>know</i> you broke it.&quot;]<br><br>It should definitely have been &quot;Now, see? This is a problem,&quot; I&#39;m really proud of this line for some reason.<br><br><br><br>The biggest secret of the Haven fandom is this:  You can never, ever overthink it. That&#39;s the big appeal.<br><br>On Nathan&#39;s Trouble: I couldn&#39;t remember the name for the genetic disorder, but it is similar to that, only without the actual genetic damage. It will turn on and off with the Troubles. One common thought is that Nathan&#39;s kinesthetic and proprioceptive senses do work. Otherwise how can he walk, write, and fire a gun?

            <p>German and English punctuation rules are obviously different. I’m afraid even British and American punctuation rules may be different. So I may not be much help there, but I will try anyway. <br><br>It might have been a nice experiment to read this without reading your explanations first. Alas, it’s too late. But I think that I didn’t really need the introduction. I wouldn’t understand why Duke goes from apologizing through provoking to starting a fight, or why Nathan’s mood changes so swiftly, obviously depending on Parker’s actions. But I would get that these are the mysteries the story is about, and that answers to my questions will be provided later. I might even be able to deduce that Duke is the barkeeper or the bar’s owner, because nobody else is there, and that Nathan is a cop, who legally can cuff and arrest people. I would assume that Parker and Nathan are good friends and also may be colleagues, although that’s still not confirmed, and that Nathan and Duke have a long and complicated history, but Parker wasn’t present in their past. So, this opening scene is a good introduction to the story.<br><br>The SPaG is actually better than I had expected, but several sentences stuck out to me for different reasons:<br><br>Is a <i><b>H</b>allmark card</i> something specific that needs to be capitalized? It’s probably okay and I just shouldn’t try to beta read for a continuum I don’t know.<br><br><i>Duke retreated to the <b>end bar stool</b> with a shot glass.</i><br>The problem may just be that I’m not a native speaker. I understand that Duke retreated to the last stool at the far end of the bar, but I’m not sure whether <i> end bar stool</i> is a good choice of words. (Also, I don’t know what a <i>shot glass</i> is, but I’m assuming that it looks like I imagine it.)<br><br><i>I had <b>even</b> forgotten some of these.</i><br>I’m not sure what irritates me. It may be the repetition of the word <i>even</i> from the previous sentence, or a problem with word order. “Even I had forgotten some of these” might be better? And/or it may help to drop the word <i>even</i> in the previous sentence.<br><br><i>After reading over the entire list<b>--</b>and it took a long time as Duke had detailed his transgressions in a tiny script over several pages<b>--</b>I realized that he left off the thing that started it all.</i><br>There should be spaces on either side of the dashes. Also, I wonder whether there is a way to insert a dash instead of two minus-signs, but I don’t know which editor you are using.<br><br><i><b>A glance,</b> and maybe it had taken me that long, because the three of us were alone.</i><br>This sounds like the narrator is speaking in sentence fragments, which would be okay in actual speech, but appears to be a bad choice of words here. Weird fact: MS Word grammar check doesn’t say that <i>A glance,</i> is a fragment, it advises to drop the comma, but I don’t think that this is right.<br><br><i>... pulling me back from anger that I suddenly saw was out of proportion <b>to the time</b>.</i><br>Again I’m not sure why this choice of words irritates me, but I would probably have said something like “after all this time” or “after so much time”.<br><br><i>Guilty bastard.</i><br>This time, MS Word grammar check says that this is a fragment, and I say that a fragment is justified here, but it needs an <b>exclamation point</b> instead of the full stop to show Nathan’s rising anger.<br><br><i>It hit my nerves like it was every excuse he had ever used to weasel his way out of trouble, and, <b>by Godknow you broke it.&quot;</b></i><br>Somewhere in this sentence Nathan goes from narrating his experience to speaking directly to Duke, but I don’t see where he starts to speak.<br><br><i>Because face it, I enjoyed talking people into doing what I wanted them to do.</i><br>I feel like <i>Because</i> should be followed by a comma, but MS Word grammar check doesn’t confirm this and since Duke is speaking here, it may be justified that <u>he</u> dropped the comma.  <br><br>(My inner rules also made me want to see a comma behind <i>Suddenly</i> in <i>Suddenly Parker was there, hands on my face, and I felt that.</i> But on second thought, it’s really better that there is no comma to make Parkers action appear to be more sudden.)<br><br><i>Duke hadn&#39;t even struggled since we went down, and that had to be <b>a first in one of our fights</b>.</i><br>This is another case where I’m not exactly sure why it feels wrong. It may be the use of <i>one</i> contradicting the fact that the narrator is talking about all their fights.<br><br><i>And just like that, <b>I&#39;m</b> thirty-five again.</i><br>This is an unjustified tense shift.<br><br>But I really liked these tense shifts:<br><i>I&#39;m not that kid anymore. Dimly, it even entered my thoughts that I know now that Duke&#39;s father was a bastard and Duke, as a kid, fit certain unpleasant profiles that cops look for when the parent&#39;s are that kind of asshole.</i><br>It’s so often done wrong, insisting on all past tense when the narrator clearly speaks about something s/he still feels – or which is generally true – while s/he narrates.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Ack! Over-explanation gets me again. It&#39;s a terrible habit I have, and I will probably do it again in responding.

            <p>If &quot;in&quot; isn&#39;t just the wrong preposition. Maybe instead: &quot;and that had to be a first <u>for</u> one of our fights&quot;? I think &quot;one of&quot; makes sense. It suggests an ongoing conflict rather than a set of fights that are all in the past (though I couldn&#39;t exactly tell you why).<br><br>Also, for the record, American usage doesn&#39;t usually include spaces around dashes. That&#39;s more of a British thing; also, I think they sometimes use en dashes instead of em dashes. I would guess that it&#39;s all to do with saving space in printing. Since saving space on the page isn&#39;t a problem online, though, I think it&#39;s probably okay to choose whichever most appeals to you. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So the spaces around dashes are a European thing – at least British and German. I will not longer tell Americans that they should have spaces around their dashes.<br><br>But my installation of MS Word is so smart. If I have spaces around the minus-sign I typed on my keyboard, it transforms the character to a dash when I start to type the next word. If I don’t have spaces around the minus-sign, it continues to look like a minus-sign or a hyphen. Isn’t Microsoft an American company? Is this a European setting and disabled in the USA? Do American Keyboards have different keys for the hyphen and the dash?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>... I despise <u>not</u> leaving spaces around dashes. It just looks ugly and cramped, and doesn&#39;t fit with the rest of punctuation - the only other marks which are joined to words on <i>both</i> sides are part of the words, like hyphens and apostrophes.<br><br>I also see no need to make your dashes soooooo looooong, particularly when they&#39;re, y&#39;know, based on <i>handwriting</i>, where I highly doubt people distinguished. ;) A single hyphen/dash character is enough for me.<br><br>Which is why, given your fervent beliefs to the contrary, I&#39;ve been doing my level best not to use any dashes at all on the Wiki; it saves on trouble.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know this continuum, but thanks to your very thorough author note, I understand what&#39;s going on just fine.  All three characters are showing quite clearly either the effects of the bullying Trouble or the nullification of that Trouble.  I like that you&#39;ve seeded the scene with those clues to hint to the reader of the full fic what&#39;s actually happening, as well as giving the characters some clues at the same time.  One thing I&#39;m not clear on is the end confrontation; is Parker continuing to touch Nathan throughout the arrest, stifling the bully revenge effect long enough for Nathan to remain in control?  Or has the revenge effect worn off for another reason?  (Apologies if this is answered later in the fic, and I just can&#39;t see because of the size limit, which isn&#39;t your fault.)<br><br>A couple errors:<br><br>&quot;Parker came around the table and leaned over my back to read, her chin pressing against my shoulder made a sharp focal point against the normal blankness of my body.&quot;<br><br>This is two sentences, so either change the comma into a semicolon or change &quot;made&quot; into &quot;making.&quot;  (Or just split it into two different sentences.  Lots of different options!)</p>

            <p>Thank you for pointing that out. I looked back over that section and ended up writing almost another 300 words of reaction spread over the last few paragraphs. I intended for it to be Nathan snapping out of it, but I really had no clues in there at all to support that intention, and hadn&#39;t really planned on showing it later. Just left it out.<br><br>I went with changing made to making in that long sentence. I knew it bugged me for some reason, but couldn&#39;t figure out how to change it. The tenses in this fic are driving me crazy. For some reason I keep randomly switching between present and past as I write it. I don&#39;t normally have that problem, but at least it sounds like I caught them before posting.</p>

There were watches in the washroom, sundials in the sink, cuckoo clocks on the console, and a water clock on the wardrobe.  Amid the chaos, a Clockwork Maid bustled.  She was completely made of silvery metal and wore a French maid&#39;s outfit.  She moved quickly, but with an odd quality reminiscent of stop-motion animation.  She was sorting the clocks that her partner had left in a state of total disarray.<br><br>&quot;I swear, that woman will be the end of me,&quot; the maid said to herself.  Her voice had a metallic, ticking quality.  &quot;I am going to get buried under a mountain of stop watches and cease to function.  And then where will she be?&quot;<br><br>At that point, the door opened and the Maid&#39;s partner entered the RC.  She was a Homestuck-verse Troll and, as such, had grey skin, shoulder-length black hair, and a pair of orange horns.  The horns were in the shape of arrows, and one was clearly shorter than the other.  Her shirt had a yellow ᛃ on it.  She dropped a bag of assorted clock parts on the bed and said, &quot;Hey, Jiffy.  Wha7&#39;s, shakin&#39;?&quot;  She always paused after the first word of every sentence, which could be a little infuriating to those who weren&#39;t used to it.<br><br>&quot;Do we really need more debris, Monath?&quot; asked the maid.  &quot;We can barely move around as it is, and you cannot even get into your bed.  You have been sleeping in the bathtub.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As, soon as I can ge7 main7enance to ins7aLL a recuperacoon, I won&#39;7 need to sLeep in 7he abLu7ion 7rap anymore.  ALrigh7,?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is no metal off of my posterior,&quot; said Jiffy.  &quot;You may sleep in the bath, in your bed, or in a bucket, for all I care, so long as you stop cluttering up our quarters.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, now.  7here&#39;s, no need 7o be vuLgar.&quot;<br><br>Jiffy was about to respond when the console, sick of hearing this fight for the 82,365th time, decided to take action.  [BEEEEEEEECuckooEEEEECuckooEEEEEECuckooEEEEEP!]<br><br>Monath sighed.  &quot;I, guess we&#39;ve go7 ano7her consuL7.  Who, is i7 7his 7ime?  DMS,?  I7&#39;s, aLways 7he DMS.&quot;  She opened a small case, containing the various Deparmental badges they&#39;d collected.<br><br>Jiffy pushed one of the cuckoo clocks out of the way so she could read the screen.  &quot;It...it is not a consult, Monath.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh,,&quot;  said Monath.  &quot;We&#39;re, finaLLy being decommissioned, 7hen?  We, knew i7 was coming.&quot;<br><br>The Maid turned to her partner.  &quot;We have a mission.  A real mission!

            <p>Being a former reader of Homestuck, I didn&#39;t really have a problem with Monath&#39;s dialogue quirks. I do think they might become a bit obnoxious to the reader given the course of a full mission, but I could understand what she was saying.<br><br>It is always good to see missions outside of the most usual departments. I&#39;m assuming that Jiffy and Monath work for the Department of Temporal Offenses (&quot;Someone is mucking about with time and they need us to fix it!&quot; is what I&#39;m going on for that).<br><br>Your physical descriptions of the agents felt a little out of place in my eyes pacing-wise. I know that descriptions can be a tricky thing to tackle using only the written word and that sometimes a little break is needed to paint a picture in the audience&#39;s mind, but the way it&#39;s been set up here just felt awkward to me. Monath&#39;s description in particular feels somewhat disruptive to the story. <br><br>Mentioning that Monath is always pausing seems redundant given that the reader can see the comma in every sentence. Given, I&#39;m sure some people might miss or overlook that, but it still felt a touch unnecessary.<br><br>The time frame that the agents exist in seems a bit odd to me. They say they&#39;ve been working in their unnamed department for years. And yet Maintenance has still not installed a recuperacoon for Monath in all that time?<br><br>Finally, SPaG notes:<br>-- For the sentence in the third paragraph that begins &quot;She was a Homestuck-verse Troll,&quot; the word &quot;Troll&quot; should not be capitalized. <br>-- I feel like &quot;main7enance&quot; in paragraph five should be capitalized due to it being a proper subdivision of a department (as in the Department of Operations, Building Maintenance).<br>-- It should be &quot;various Depar<b>t</b>mental badges&quot; in the last sentence of the ninth paragraph.<br>-- There should be a space between the end of an ellipsis and the word following it in Jiffy&#39;s dialogue in the tenth paragraph (&quot;It... it is not a consult, Monath.&quot;)<br>-- Final paragraph, first sentence. There does not need to be a comma between &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;now.&quot;</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve got the time theme down <i>solid</i>.  Without you stating it explicitly, I (think I) already know that a) Monath is a time-affiliated troll (I don&#39;t know the proper way to say it in HS-speak) and b) Monath and Jiffy are in the DTO.  (And if I&#39;m wrong about either, I will feel really awkward.)  I like that even Jiffy&#39;s name, the type of robot she is and the console&#39;s sound effect all fit in with the clocky/time theme.  This is majorly tight and well constructed for so few paragraphs.<br><br>I didn&#39;t find Monath&#39;s speech characteristics difficult to understand; after a few paragraphs, her dialogue sounded just a clear as plain English in my head.  (doctorLi7, was ac7uaLLy fLuen7 in cha7 speak, many years ago.  7he, more you know!)  Ironically, though, I found one aspect of Jiffy&#39;s speech unclear.  You say her voice had a &quot;ticking quality,&quot; but a tick, by definition, is a short, quick noise, and wouldn&#39;t really be able to convey the kinds of sounds necessary for speech.  I think maybe you meant that she has ticking &quot;background noises&quot; while she speaks?<br><br>I also want to point out one sentence that I love, for its consonance: &quot;There were watches in the washroom, sundials in the sink, cuckoo clocks on the console, and a water clock on the wardrobe.&quot;  Fantastic!  (Although, what&#39;s a water clock?  o.O)<br><br>One typo: &quot;She opened a small case, containing the various <b>Deparmental</b> badges they&#39;d collected.&quot;</p>

            <p>Monath does, in fact, represent the Time Aspect from Homestuck.  Her class is Maid, if you are interested.

            <p>But I like it. Monath is obsessed with clocks and has a Clockwork Maid for a partner, and they are in the Department of Temporal Offenses?

            <p>I recall that you had the same problem the last time Monath appeared in a story.  I wonder if there is a way that we can work around that.

            <p>The problem with The Dreaded Quirk is that you explicitly say in the story that the commas represent pauses. Which... doesn&#39;t make sense before a question mark. English doesn&#39;t have a separate interrogative sound (well, it does, but we write &#39;huh?&#39; and &#39;eh?&#39; in), so you&#39;re writing &#39;she paused after finishing her sentence&#39;.

Since your report is a translation of fictional voices into written form, you can and should duplicate textual quirks; to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the idea. Though it does invite the question of precisely how audible the quirk in question is... and who&#39;s writing the mission reports. Presumably Monath would write the <i>entire</i> report in quirk format, Jiffy would ignore the non-audible parts (such as ,?), and a third party or automatic transcript wouldn&#39;t know about them anyway?<br><br>Maybe Jiffy&#39;s doing it, and sees writing it in as a form of racial sensitivity. Or maybe I&#39;m thinking waaaay too hard about this...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Each Troll from Homestuck has what is called a &#39;typing quirk&#39;.  It is so named because they communicate mostly through instant messaging software.  A quirk involves patterns of capitalization, punctuation, syntax, and text color (I decided not to put all of Monath&#39;s text in <font color="#a1a100"><strong>Yellow</strong></font>.  I&#39;ve done enough damage already.).<br><br>Some are simple: <font color="#008141"><strong>Kanaya, For Instance, Simply Capitalizes Every Word And Offers A Multitude Of Words Where Perhaps Fewer Would Have Sufficed To Get Her Point Across.</strong></font><br>Some are complex: <font color="#2b0057"><strong>GaMzEe dOeS SoMe rIdIcUlOuS StUfF AlL Up aRoUnD HiS CoNvErSaTiOnS. :o)</strong></font><br><br>However, these quirks are also seen to be used when the Troll is speaking directly to another character.

            <p>I see for the umpteenth time that haste = bad. <br><br>I was slightly irritated when the agents talked about “consult”. Are they consulting detectives or what? I sorted this out rather quick. They mostly accompany agents from other departments, when the ‘fic also contains something Monath and Jiffy are specializing in (and the last line reveals that these, of course, are temporal offenses).

I should have mentioned that there might be a problem.<br><br>Also, when I figured out the “consult”, I remembered that some agents, while doing this, wear special badges showing which department they help out.

            <p>Initial impression: I have never read Homestuck, and I&#39;m afraid that reading a lot of Monath speaking at once would drive me up a wall. Not the fault of the story at all, just how I relate to the rules of her origin. I do find her fascination with time pieces to be interesting. I wonder where she finds them all.I like the clocks. <br><br>Jiffy immediately draws my interest. She is a Clockwork Maid, who is taking care of a whole RC full of clocks, and she has the capacity for snarky attitude. I like her right away. I don&#39;t recognize what canon the Clockwork Maid comes from, but she is still interesting and I want to learn more about her abilities. <br><br>I still don&#39;t know for sure what Department they are with, but I am not sure if that is because they are in a Department that has been defunct and I am just not thinking of it off the bat, or because this is a new Department whose existence is being retconned. I like the touch that they have flashpatches (or are the Departmental badges indicating something else?) for the various Departments that they have worked with in the past. It is a handy way to say they were around for a long time without other agents really noticing it.<br><br>Second pass: Whatever is on Monath&#39;s shirt has been rendered by the Board as a rectangle. I am not sure if that is on purpose, but it looks like one of the smart-quote type errors. <br><br>[&quot;Oh,,&quot; said Monath.] two commas there.<br><br>I am now wanting to see what mission a Time Department could have that requires a crash dummy.<br><br>I just had a thought that there was an episode of Dr. Who that involved clockwork people, but I don&#39;t remember them talking.

            <p>Quite honestly, reading much of any Troll can grate on the nerves after a while (with the obvious exception of the Trolls who grate right away).

An agent wears a badge to denote that they are working with a department other than their own.<br><br>Monath&#39;s symbol...yeah, I thought there might be a problem there.  It is a unicode symbol that looks vaguely like this, &quot;L7&quot; just tilted a bit.  It is a Norse rune.  More specifically, it is the one that means &quot;year&quot;. More time references.  I need to figure out a way to make that work for everyone.<br><br>The double commas were intentional.  The rule states that there is a comma after the first word of every sentence she says.  I just add a comma no matter what.  That includes right before ending punctuation.  I am still considering whether this is a wise move or not.  Do you think it is too much?<br><br>The crash dummy shenanigans are, to be quite honest, the funniest thing in the mission, so far.  Look forward to that.<br><br><br>Now, I do have some questions for you, if you&#39;ve the time to answer.<br><br>Do you think I&#39;ve overdone it with time references in this introduction?  I&#39;ve jammed them into as many places as possible, but I&#39;m wondering if they are mostly obscure enough so as to not distract.<br><br>How do you think the agents work, as a pair?  Do they feel like they balance?  I know there is not much to go on at the moment, but your first impressions would be helpful.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I couldn&#39;t find them anywhere.  I had to go looking for a mission they appeared in.  Which brings me to &quot;badges&quot;.

            <p>It looks like I&#39;ve been... quite inconsistent. Kayleigh&#39;s announcement is entitled &#39;Mission Pins&#39;, but doesn&#39;t use that term anywhere in itself; Mortic calls them &#39;mission badges&#39; in &#39;Help from the past&#39;, and hS alternates between &#39;pin&#39; and &#39;badge&#39; in &#39;Of Wolves&#39;... hmm.<br><br>My thought is that &#39;pin&#39; is more useful than &#39;badge&#39;.

            <p>This computer won&#39;t let me on the Wiki, and Google hasn&#39;t cached it yet, but it&#39;s at &#39;Mission pin&#39;, or maybe &#39;Mission Pin&#39;. The structure I&#39;ve used is one that will change when they become more widespread; at the moment, there are only two attested users (not counting your agents, because citing an unpublished fragment of a mission seems wrong ;)), so the &#39;agents known to use them&#39; section can be useful. When they become more widespread, it will be traded first for a &#39;missions featuring&#39;, and then for simply more information in the article.<br><br>The list of badges (ie, the galleries) is incomplete: it&#39;s attested that there&#39;s at least a DCPS badge (which will be a gold outline of a shield). As detailed on the Talk page, I&#39;m trying to reconstruct my method of creating them; I think I&#39;m about 90% of the way there - close enough that I could make &#39;looks mostly the same&#39; images - but I&#39;d prefer to get it spot-on.

            <p>Well, this is really, really short to see well they work together, but I get the sense that have good potential to work well together. Monath is the more hyper, obsessive one, and I figure she&#39;ll be the more *flail* one in the missions. Jiffy is the more snarky, take charge (though ineffectually based on the number of time related devices in their RC) one, who is more likely to hold it together until she goes flamethrower crazy, sort out of the blue. Being a mechanical creature, she can&#39;t use bleep products, right?<br><br>Both of those are solid PPC archetypes that work well together for an agent pair. I may be wrong about how I expect they will react to the missions or even in general. Like I said, this isn&#39;t much to go on.<br><br>The comma thing, I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t realize that, because I remember seeing at least one comma in front of question mark and understanding that that was a style choice. The double comma, though, I didn&#39;t think of that. Maybe because a comma in front of a question mark is odd enough that I had to think about it a second, whereas a double comma, just got automatically flagged in my mind as a typo. I don&#39;t think it is too much. You just might want to add that note to the list of her peculiarities, so people expect it. <br><br>I wondered about the badge thing. I didn&#39;t remember about the badge thing, so my first thought was flashpatch, but then I did wonder a bit. Maybe a bit of a description of their appearance at some later point when it might work in naturally, because now I am imagining something that looks rather different than a flashpatch. I&#39;m probably not the only that won&#39;t immediately remember them.<br><br>I didn&#39;t think the references were overdone. I quite liked them in reference to Jiffy. The ticking, etc. It helps remind that she is a clockwork creature.  I meant to say in my first response, but I really liked the cuckoo clock sound mixed in with the *beep*.<br><br>On Monarth, the only line that was really hard to read was this one: &quot;I, guess we&#39;ve go7 ano7her consuL7. Who, is i7 7his 7ime? DMS,? I7&#39;s, aLways 7he DMS.&quot; Just because there are so many 7&#39;s. </p>

            <p>The scenario I&#39;m working with is that they read the first Author&#39;s note, say that they have to assume that it&#39;s a real person anyway because they got it.  Then they get over halfway through the fic and read a new author&#39;s note that really confirms that the Sorters didn&#39;t read the author&#39;s notes, plus a lot of other evidence, and just proceed as normal because the fallout is not their problem.  They&#39;re working with a (not sure what her classification would actually be) former Sue that was assumed to be a real person.<br><br>Basically since they aren&#39;t assassins, they can&#39;t make the judgement call whether to kill her or try to recruit her.<br><br>I&#39;m working with Selfishness, which has a good chargelist regardless of whether or not she&#39;s a Sue, Self-Insert, or a Bit.</p>

            <p>You can&#39;t stick any kind of file just anywhere on the Internet. The best way to share a written work with the Board is to upload or copy the text someplace like Google Drive (this is especially useful for beta-reading), a journal or blog service (e.g. Dreamwidth or Wordpress), your own website (most webhosts these days come with or are based entirely on graphical sitebuilding services, so you don&#39;t have to learn HTML if you don&#39;t want to), or in this case, maybe even FictionPress.com, which is FanFiction.net&#39;s companion site for original fiction. Then you can provide a link to the webpage containing your document.<br><br>However, since you&#39;re currently seeking a beta for this work, you shouldn&#39;t be uploading or linking it anywhere public yet, let alone on the Board. Stick to a private Google Drive document (or equivalent, if there&#39;s a similar service you and your beta like better), or else e-mail the file back and forth with your beta, depending on what they want to do. Save the publishing services for when your work done, beta&#39;d, and <i>ready</i> to publish.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If you have, what do you think about the latest plot twists? I mean, Lost At Sea (rewritten) really changed a lot about Calvin&#39;s relationship with his parents. And the idea that Rupert and Earl use shock collars on their crew seriously scared me.<br>I also think that Frank (DOCTOR BRAINSTORM!!) is getting a whole buttload of character development. And now the world knows he exists. Gulp.<br><br>GarfieldOdie announced at the end of Lost at Sea that the next story arc (The Collective) will change a lot of things. And that&#39;s going to begin next week. So what do you think will happen? I&#39;m really psyched up for this one, and I hve a feeling they won&#39;t disappoint.<br><br>So, wgat do you think?<br>Thoughts? Ideas? Duplicates of Socrates?</p>

            <p>I recommend you start with <i>Can You Imagine That?</i> since it&#39;s pretty much the prequel to the Series. Luckily enough, GarfieldOdie just rewrote it, so it&#39;s reallyreallyreally good now.<br>LINK- <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915180/">www.fanfiction.net/s/9915180/</a><br><br>At the end of that story, there&#39;s a timeline of the order the various stories and episodes are in, so you can just follow that list. Most of the seasons are posted on Swing123&#39;s account, which is here.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/%7ESwing123">www.fanfiction.net/~Swing123</a><br><br>However, some other things are posted at GarfieldOdie&#39;s account. So just look around a bit.<br>A bit of a warning- the early stories, although sort of funny, are not very good with SPaG.  The awrsomeness kicks in mid-Season 2, and the best storis are Season 3 and onwards. Bu you really have to read everything for it to make sense.<br><br>~Kitty</p>

            <p>Yeah, I think that one would be the first recorded PJO mission. (And what a first mission.)<br><br>Out of all the wild and wacky creatures from Greek mythology, mini-pegasi seem like the safest idea. (There&#39;s more than one way to botch a name, so mini-pegasi can come in more than just black.) Dunno what they would eat, though; we&#39;ll let people more familiar with the canon talk about that one.</p>

            <p>I want to bring Elizabeth the Sorter along for a mission.  It looks pretty standard as it devolves into heavy script plagiarizing.  Actually, Noth Null explains it better.  <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/r/9741423/"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/r/9741423/">https://www.fanfiction.net/r/9741423/</a></a><br><br>What justification could I use for bringing her along that won&#39;t upset the Flowers?  <br><br>Samantha figures that it&#39;s a pretty safe story, and she might be trying to find a surrogate for when she would have loved the opportunity.  For Larry, the reason they let the fic run its course is that he hasn&#39;t learned the canon yet and what better opportunity than to watch it from up-close.  To bring Elizabeth with is that I think it&#39;s funnier to have her be a living barometer of what the fic is doing.  <br><br>With this scenario, I could have Larry be too squeamish to kill his first Sue.  It would be his second try.  Without Elizabeth, he&#39;d have to solo because the safest way to deal with the Sue is with the in-universe MacGuffin that disables vampires.</p>

Having a complete list of non-missions would at least make non-missions easier to find, much like the complete list of killed badfic makes missions easier to find.<br><br>Going up a little, I had clicked on Mordecai to learn more about the postal department, and ended up reading &quot;forbidden fruit tastes nasty.&quot;  Bad luck on the coin flip there.<br><br>On the list by department, it&#39;s a huge gamble on how much clicking and searching I&#39;ll have to do to actually find what I&#39;m looking for, or if I&#39;m just going to get distracted by something that looks more interesting.

            <p>The problem is that my favorite interludes aren’t just events that happened between missions. They are parts of story arcs and can’t be understood without reading the missions that happen between these interludes. So I recommend the interwoven adventures of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Cali_Still">Cali</a> (by Miah) and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Cadmar">Cadmar</a> (by Caddy-shack). <br><br>To get it all in chronological order, start with ‘First Interlude: “How Cali met Miah”’ linked on Agent Cali’s page and read through the missions also linked there up to ‘Third mission ... with Trainee Cadmar’, which is also linked on Agent Cadmar’s page as ‘Training mission 1: ... with Agents Cali and Miah’. From there you have to follow the separate story arcs on both agents’ pages, synchronizing where missions and interludes are linked on both pages: <br>‘Cameo B: “First Contact”’ a. k. a ‘Interlude 1: Agent Intro”’<br>‘Second Interlude: “Truth and Dare”’ a. k. a. ‘Interlude 3: “Truth and Dare”’<br>‘Tenth Mission: “Dragon Lady”’ a. k. a. ‘Mission 4: “Dragon Lady”’<br>‘Third Interlude: “Picking up the Pieces”’ a. k. a. ‘Interlude 4: “Picking up the Pieces”’<br>‘Eleventh Mission: “Optional”’ a. k. a. ‘Mission 6: “Optional”’<br>‘Fourth Interlude: “Truth and Dare II”’ a. k. a. ‘Interlude 5: “Truth and Dare 2”’<br>‘Thirteenth Mission: “Sateda”’ a. k. a. ‘Mission 9: “Sateda”’<br>‘Fifth Interlude: “McKaLoy’s Forttnight”’ a. k. a. ‘Interlude 8: “McKaLoy’s Forttnight”’<br>‘Sixth Interlude: “Christmas ... On Sheep Cloning Day”’ a. k. a. ‘Interlude 9: “Christmas”’<br>‘Sixteenth Mission: “Against All Odds”’ a. k. a. ‘Mission 10: “Against All Odds”’<br><br>If you also try to follow the stories of other agents who cross Cali or Cadmar’s way, it becomes quite an achievement, and in the end you know half of the PPC.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Disclaimer: These are &quot;classic&quot; spin-offs that I think are particularly helpful in gaining an understanding of the PPC and which I personally enjoy. I&#39;m in no way intending to imply that other spin-offs aren&#39;t good or that you HAVE to like these ones. There&#39;s a <i>lot</i> of good stuff out there, by authors both old and new. {= )<br><br>* <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2557254/1/">Caitlin and Sidh</a> - This is just a one-off, but I think it introduces the PPC really well, has excellent characterization, and is overall high quality writing. I wish they&#39;d written more.<br><br>* <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/architeuthis/">Architeuthis</a> - The original Department of Intelligence series. Her definition of a Mary Sue is out of date now, but this is still an important foundational series.<br><br>* <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/JAAKSONS/">Nenya and Rosie</a> - The Jay and Acacia Kooky Spin-Off Nerd Society. Of particular inspiration to me is the FicPsych chapter.<br><br>* <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?keyword=PPC+Missions&amp;user=uncommon_comma&amp;sortby=des">Mara and Isaiah</a> - The Department of Technical Errors. Excellent and foundational. Araeph is a real-life editor, so you can&#39;t go wrong taking cues from her.<br><br>* <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/48575.html">Trojanhorse and Paddlebrains</a> - Department of Bad Slash. Absolutely hilarious. Takes an under-appreciated department and <i>owns</i> it in a way few others have managed before or since. (Plus, if you&#39;re looking for badfics in which the author did not do the research, you&#39;ll find a lot of that here.)<br><br>* <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Agents.htm">Dafydd and Selene (and Constance)</a> - Department of Geographical Aberrations. hS went on to write the PPC&#39;s history (or at least, what the Flowers want us to think is the PPC&#39;s history <sup>_~</sup> ) and is an incredibly influential person hereabouts. That didn&#39;t happen by accident—that happened because he&#39;s a highly talented writer and generally well-liked.<br><br>* <a href="http://bronzeclockwork.livejournal.com/1229.html">Suicide, Diocletian, and Ithalond</a> - This is a more recent spin-off, included because Tungsten Monk is quite simply one of the funniest people I know. Also, she&#39;s a real-life published author now.<br><br>Someday, I&#39;ll put together a full rec list of PPC stories from different eras... It would be a long list, though, so I&#39;m leaving it at this for the time being.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>1) What fandoms?

            <p>I&#39;m familiar with a ton of different continuities, so for most things I&#39;ll just need a quick refresher to remember how the canon goes. In terms of what bothers me in fanfic, my ire is mostly focused towards works where the author clearly did not care about doing the research on what they&#39;re writing about. I&#39;m only familiar with the DMS right now, so I&#39;ll take a look at the other departments. Thanks!</p>

            <p>There was a brief discussion some weeks ago on the minis for Homestuck. Another person was writing a Homestuck mission and was unsure of whether minis had yet been established. We didn&#39;t decide on anything there, though great approval was given to the idea of mini-buckets. However, I didn&#39;t want a particularly large number of pseudo-sentient buckets running amuck in the OFU, so I what I have written in here are <b><a href="http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/His_Honorable_Tyranny">mini-His-Honorable-Tyrannies</a>, or mini-Tyrannies, that come holding a bucket.</b> If the mission featuring that is posted before the OFU and has something else, I&#39;ll gladly change it. (Though I still don&#39;t want too many buckets lying around. We know there will be far too many already, and the staff will be traumatized enough.)</p>

            <p>I always got the impression that minis were based on some monster in the canon, if there was a monster, and the most significant animal if there was not. I mean, we&#39;ve got mini-Balrogs, to start with, mini-Aragogs, and so on and so forth.<br><br>Yeah, there are a lot of things. I discarded several ideas, including mini-horrorterros.

            <p>Or maybe, since minis are animate misspellings, something SBAHJ-related?<br><br>Or maybe something Roxy-related, maybe mini-Mutis.<br><br><br>I noticed more than anything that minis are always somewhat tangential to the main plot of a work, never really <i>important</i> things.

            <p>For a certain... top-secret project, I&#39;ve been trying to translate the phrase &quot;There is nothing man was not meant to know&quot; (i.e. the inverse of the trope phrase) into a concise Latin motto. Google Trans gives me &quot;Nihil est, quod non hominum scire&quot;... Seeing as there&#39;s a lot of smart people with radically different skill sets wandering around here, I thought I&#39;d put it up and see if this is the right translation and if not what a better one would be.<br><br>(Ok, that last sentence probably isn&#39;t my greatest, but it gets the point across...)</p>

            <p>As has been stated on this Board before, Google Translate unfortunately sucks at translating Latin. Fortunately, you&#39;ve come to the right place.<br><br>&quot;There is nothing man was not meant to know.&quot; roughly translates to <i>Nihil est quod non sciendum homini.</i> (lit. &quot;There is nothing that is not to be known by man.&quot;)</p>

            <p>I am sorry that I let my frustrations get the better of me.  <br><br>When you denied my first request, my head had already started to clog with ideas in the first month, and it was already causing anxiety.  I couldn&#39;t find a prompt that would work with my main team, especially when I learn who they are by working with them.  I should&#39;ve explained this instead of breaking the rule about writing missions without permission.  I figured that I would be okay with you being wrong about me being one of those people who get permission and never do anything with it, but that was a mistake and I should have argued from the beginning.<br><br>Once I was breaking the rule, I shouldn&#39;t have tried to hide it since it was just building my frustrations that I couldn&#39;t ask for more specific help.<br><br>When I finally found something to wedge in as a random prompt and asked for permission again, and you just said “something&#39;s missing” twice instead of explaining what the problem is, then admitting that you were waiting for me to figure it out on my own, that pressed my berserk button.  I shouldn&#39;t have ignored that to let it fester.<br><br>I am sorry for building up this image in my mind of you being someone who likes having that sort of power over someone.  I shouldn&#39;t have gotten upset with imagining that you&#39;d reject my prompts simply because they don&#39;t follow the instructions exactly.  <br><br>And when I went crazy it shouldn&#39;t have been at you.</p>

            <p>And I do appreciate the effort that went into making it. I acknowledge that you are struggling with something I don&#39;t understand, and I will try to be mindful of that in the future.<br><br>However, I won&#39;t accept blame for something that isn&#39;t true. You assert that I &quot;just said &#39;something&#39;s missing&#39; twice instead of explaining what the problem [was].&quot; That is false. My exact words from your latest Permission thread, with the parts meant to tell you exactly what I wanted underlined:<br><br> 
<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=260882;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">First response</a> - &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m just waiting for the <u>second prompt</u> to be posted. ... &#39;Cause, y&#39;know, writing-wise, we specifically ask for character bios, a response to one of four control prompts, and <u>a response to one of the random prompts from the table</u>.&quot; 
<br>You had already posted your character bios and Samantha&#39;s recruitment story (a control prompt response; the first type of prompt I named in my post) to the Board, so I thought it would be clear that the random prompt response (the second type of prompt I named in my post) was the missing element of your request. However, you said in your reply that Samantha&#39;s recruitment was the second prompt, so I tried to explain again, drawing a contrast between what you had already posted and what I wanted to highlight the missing piece:<br><br> 
<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=260905;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Second response</a> - &quot;In that case, I&#39;m waiting for the first one. ... Because &quot;character bios, one control prompt, and one piece of fanfic&quot; is not the same as &quot;character bios, one control prompt, and <u>one random prompt from the table</u>.&quot; So far, you&#39;ve provided the former; <u>I&#39;m looking for the latter</u>.&quot; 
<br>At that point you DID post a random prompt response, so it seems like I successfully got the point across.<br><br>Furthermore, I outlined the PGs&#39; expectations for a Permission request in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=259824;">my first response to your first request</a>, and it&#39;s all explained via the Permission article on the wiki, specifically point 4 in the &quot;<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission#How_Do_I_Get_Permission.3F">How Do I Get Permission?</a>&quot; section, and in the linked &quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IE81HONRJnp0IaK92GvzyL00CZYNZG_pvdo93gRMIhY/pub">36 Permission Prompts</a>&quot; document, which you must have looked at in order to come to the conclusion that you couldn&#39;t find a random prompt you liked. (I can highlight passages from the linked stuff as I did with my posts above, if that would be helpful.)<br><br>So, while again, I do appreciate the attempt to make amends, and I want to be understanding about your personal difficulties, it&#39;s impossible for me to overlook your statement that I didn&#39;t tell you what I wanted. I certainly did, and I had every reason to believe that you would understand what I was talking about because a) I explained it to you after your first Permission request, and b) what&#39;s required in a Permission request is explained in documents that people are expected to read and understand before applying. Therefore, I would like you to withdraw the statement, at which point I will be happy to shake hands (so to speak) and move on.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. I wasn&#39;t the only one you went off on. I think VM and Ekyl also deserve an apology for being ranted at when they were being perfectly reasonable toward you.</p>

            <p>I must admit, this would be a lot more convincing if you scrolled down, read what you&#39;d written to folks last night, and then apologized to them directly. We&#39;re not unsympathetic to mental illness and the ill effects of medicines, but that doesn&#39;t excuse bad behavior towards others. However, if you&#39;re serious, a sincere apology to the people you were rude to, for your specific actions towards them, would be appreciated. This is not that.</p>
