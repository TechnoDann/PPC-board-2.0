            <p>What I find funny actually quite depends on my mood. PPC-wise, though, there are some characters that are just inherently funny (such as the Notary, Ilraen and Eargus Khan), and there are some situations that are inherently funny - agents trying to avoid making the console [BEEEEEP!].<br><br>That said, not all missions are funny. One mission I wrote was less funny and more &#39;oh gods I need to spork this before I&#39;ll go nuts&#39;.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s nothing quite as good as a couple of characters snarking, bickering, laughing, and the like. In fact, that&#39;s one of the major reasons why I like the PPC. Interaction is a large part of the comedy. On a related note, if you don&#39;t think what you&#39;ve seen of the PPC is funny, but you want to write PPC stories, what will your stories be like?</p>

            <p>All right, everyone, I have a challenge for us all.  It was inspired by both Huinesoron and Lily Winterwood in various posts over the last week or so.<br><br>Here are The Rules (which are totally not lifted directly from Huinesoron&#39;s writing challenges.  Nope.):<br><br>-Write a (reasonably short) story in response to the Theme below, and post it on this thread. You may use a beta if you wish, but it is not required.<br>-Give constructive criticism (at least one positive point, at least one negative with suggestions for improvement) to at least one other submission.<br>-You may rewrite your story based on concrit you receive and repost it, but this is not required.<br>-Obvious fact, but no flaming! This isn&#39;t like the Badfic Contest - the goal here is to write a good story and get feedback from the community.<br>-You do not require Permission to participate in the Challenge. Neither do your agents need to be approved for you to use them.<br>-However, nothing written for the Challenge is considered part of the PPC Canon unless you do have Permission, and explicitly claim it as canon.<br><br>Now for the part you have all been waiting for.  The theme for this challenge is...<br><br><b>Do something PPC-related that isn&#39;t in the usual format!</b>  <br><br>Want to write in Iambic Pentameter?  Do it.  Have a microphone?  Record something.  Is there a webcomic in your head?  Draw it.  Want to write a story that is one giant palindrome?  I would pay money to read that! (Fake money.  I am in theatre, after all.)  Do whatever you want to do, as long as it doesn&#39;t involve the usual narrative-prose, words-on-a-page format that we know so well.<br><br>We are a multi-talented group, and this challenge is a way to bring some of that out.  That may take some time, so there is no time limit on this.<br><br>I look forward to seeing what everyone comes up with.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>First up, well done! I&#39;ve been considering doing this every christmas, but never do.<br><br>My main problem with the recording is that the music is so much quieter than the singing. I had to turn it way up to hear the opening instrumental, which led to you bellowing over my speakers at quarter to six in the morning. ;) I liked the choice of music track, however (insofar as I could hear it) - the accelerated pace worked well.<br><br>I also liked the mix of images you used (though one - the logo from J&amp;A&#39;s page - was rather too low resolution for the zoom you had it on). All in all, good job! And certainly not a prose story. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I especially like the &quot;I misspell doom,&quot; line. It really cracked me up!<br><br>The only thing I can really suggest is this: in the first verse, you end with the word &quot;maligned.&quot; While this is a great word and I think everyone should be able to use it, it just doesn&#39;t go with most of the other words in the piece. (Granted, I don&#39;t really know how rap works, but I&#39;m assuming the rules are similar to other kinds of poetry.) There are lots of words that rhyme with &quot;mind:&quot; find, defined, rhymed (okay, that&#39;s a near rhyme).<br><br>I really like it, though! Great idea.</p>

            <p>Not all of the lines have a meter that follows the traditional limerick&#39;s meter, or even the meter of that individual limerick.  But most of the rhymes, at least, are quite natural (except for the &quot;mummy&quot; line, that one felt a bit forced).  I especially like the end, too; it&#39;s a detail from real life where something can seem so irritating while it&#39;s happening, but then after it&#39;s gone, you realize getting back the regular routine is no fun, either.</p>

            <p>I really enjoyed reading that (also it&#39;s cool to see more stuff for Catastrophe Theory). <br><br>I actually didn&#39;t find it to be <i>that</i> depressing, and I think that was because of the ballade structure. The subject matter is depressing (if it had just been a normal written piece I think it would have been depressing as hell), but I thought the song itself was quite rousing. It has the feel of the kind of song that the survivors would sing in memory of those that didn&#39;t make it. <br><br>Lots of good imagery in it, particularly:<br>&#39;They shoulder weapons, raise a cry<br>And march, together, to the fight.<br>Past ashen walls and off to die.<br><br>Their footsteps ring like hammerfalls.<br>They look as proud as any knight.&#39;<br><br>I could picture that bit in my head really clearly. <br><br>Nicely done, sir. </p>

            <p>Glad you enjoyed it.  Though, fun you should mention it...I already have the a story in mind that this song is &quot;based on&quot;.  I&#39;ve had a couple of characters that I thought needed proper CT send-offs, and this seems to fit them well.  So...look forward to that being more depressing?<br><br>I also know who the in-universe author of the poem is, and have considered recording it as read by them.  Might do that, might not.  Haven&#39;t decided, yet.<br><br>Just so you are aware, adding the above story to the list, there are a total of three CT stories in the works, one of which is actually in the process of being written.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Wow!<br><br>This was very haunting, especially the repetition of &#39;past ashen walls and off to die&#39;. Seriously, that&#39;ll be playing in my head for the rest of the day.

            <p>You write &#39;a-GENTS&#39; - but the natural reading is &#39;A-gents&#39; for most people. That&#39;s a trochee, not an iamb, and slapping it up against an iamb - &#39;A-gents a-MASS&#39; - tends to blue the two into each other; it reads as &#39;AGE-ntsa-MASS&#39;.<br><br>What Iximaz is looking for is &#39;AG-ents MASS to POOL their MIGHT&#39;. I seem to recall that there <i>is</i> a word for clipping off the first half of an iamb, but I don&#39;t know what it is. I do know that the &#39;AG-ents&#39; reading is an example of trochaic subsitution - as in &#39;WHETH-er tis NOBL-er IN the MIND to SUF-fer&#39; - which also ends in an amphibrach, of all things! Honestly, this &#39;Shakespeare&#39; bloke - who did he think he was?<br><br>The point is, Iximaz is right that it sounds a little off - but it&#39;s also perfectly valid. And if you&#39;re willing to suffer the slightly wrenched accent of &#39;a-GENTS&#39;, it&#39;s not even that.<br><br>(Also, I never said, but I was really impressed by your working &#39;labyrinthine&#39; into it)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The discovery of the Phobos (&#39;P&#39;) manuscript of &#39;(The Ballade of) Ashen Walls/Halls&#39; brings the total count up to four. While P is largely congruent with the later Hunter (&#39;H&#39;) variant, it presents some interesting variations of its own, and casts light on the progression of changes which led to the known texts.<br><br>The first change in P is the opening line, <i>In labyrinthine, leaden halls</i>. This line appears in the Barid (&#39;B&#39;) text, while H leads with &#39;In lightless labyrinthine halls&#39;. The far more recent British Museum (&#39;M&#39;) manuscript corrupts this into &#39;In <i>lifeless</i> labyrinthine halls&#39;. It seems clear that the P/B text is the original, with the alteration appearing in later, more sophisticated variants.<br><br>The fourth line of P is unique: <i>All knowing how ill runs their plight</i>. The other texts unanimously agree on &#39;Knowing how desperate is their plight&#39;. A marginal note in B provides the alternate reading &#39;To face the horror of their plight&#39;, which may be the best version in terms of scansion.<br><br>Line 6, <i>They shoulder weapons, raise a cry</i>, is also an innovation in P, substituting for B&#39;s &#39;Waving swords, they raise a cry&#39;. The P reading appears to be the older, and in this case by far the better.<br><br>The refrain, <i>Past ashen walls and off to die</i>, appears in this form in H and M, while B records the alternate form &#39;Through ashen halls&#39; &amp;c. It is clear that the later writers followed the P tradition, but which is the older remains unclear.<br><br>The second stanza of P is copied verbatim in H, and with minor variants in M, but is almost completely substituted in B:<br><br>&#39;Their footsteps ring from wall to wall;<br>They stand as tall as olden knights.<br>For innocence they fight and fall:<br>For those who&#39;d never stray from right,<br>But fall unnoticed into night<br>And give the agents reasons why.<br>So now they march, but not in flight,<br>Through ashen halls and off to die.&#39;<br><br>It seems clear that Stanza 2 of B represents a different tradition, the full text of which is lost. Note the B poet&#39;s use of repetition, in &#39;wall to wall&#39;, and the dual use of &#39;fall&#39; in lines 3 and 5. The variant may have been discarded due to its lower poetic value than P, though line 3 seems to be better phrased in B than P.<br><br>At this point B gives out entirely, and the textual variation is significantly reduced. H and M agree that &#39;ever nearer; in to sight&#39; in S3, L4 should be &#39;ever nearer, into sight&#39;. H provides &#39;the agents cry out&#39; in L5, while M foolishly breaks the enjambment to give &#39;The call out to their foes invite/And shouted curses they let fly&#39;.<br><br>The final lines of P contain the only repeated end-of-line word in this version: &#39;They throw themselves against the night&#39;, copying &#39;night&#39; from S2, L5. H and M agree with this reading, which suggests it may have been an intentional shift - but alas for B&#39;s truncation! If we only had the older text to contast with, we could make a definitive statement.<br><br>In conclusion, the previously accepted path of B &gt; H &gt; M must now be altered. P stands beside B as one of the oldest texts, and the one which most influenced H. M, as before, is understood to be an attempt to &#39;regularise&#39; H, but constitutes a corrupted copy; it has little research value. Of all the variants, the P &#39;Ashen Walls&#39; can safely be said to be the best <i>poem</i>, however dubious its claims to be the oldest.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Seriously, this is absolutely the best way to do it.<br><br>I do have something in the works to actually submit - hopefully I&#39;ll get it done in time. It&#39;s a bit... strange.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I believe that is a first.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever gotten such an official, academic review before.<br><br>And to top it off, it is enjoyable to read.  Well done.<br><br>I like some of the substitutions that are suggested in the &quot;other versions&quot; of the poem, and I will likely rework it over the next couple of days to incorporate some of them.  To be honest, the two days that I spent working on this were almost entirely comprised of trying to fill in three and a half stanzas without repeating ending rhymes (which I succeeded on with the exception of &#39;night&#39;), and not much on editing.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>First up, the second chapter of <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10306717/2/The-Ispace-Wars">The Ispace Wars</a> is up (and the first chapter now includes a summary of <i>OFUDisc</i>, for those who haven&#39;t read it).<br><br>Second, this was actually posted a few years back, but I&#39;m only now getting it properly filed: a pair of Assassins take on a Mary-Sue in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_RLF3oGSMN1h1SzbEzW6ldcEuZPfJHvAfM3FxHwHeQc/pub">promise ring</a>.<br><br>Third up, we have this:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHfubKjf6k9l9MZAfFpacN9pjtnxkhI96C1AqUNBIL4/pub">Ephemerals</a><br><br>We all know there are defunct departments in the PPC - but for a lot of them, we don&#39;t know much <i>about</i> them. This is a look at some of them - two which already existed, and three concocted for this story.<br><br>The departments mentioned here are, well, defunct - they no longer exist. But they <i>did</i> exist, and are available for backstories. All agents who aren&#39;t otherwise accounted for are designated Free-to-Use, as well, though what they&#39;re up to these days I have no idea.<br><br>I&#39;ve also used the opportunity to resolve a few outstanding issues. The Department of Godplayers now has a shutdown date (and a reason), way back in 2003. The Department of Floaters also has a launch date - and prior references to it are implicitly retconned by &#39;floaters&#39; being a nickname for the Department of Multiple Offences. However, this opens up a pair of possible conflicts:<br><br>-Sebak is claimed to be &#39;from Godplayers&#39; in 2008. Since his other stories don&#39;t mention this, I&#39;m assuming this is in the same way that J&amp;A are &#39;from the PPC&#39; nowadays - not current, but what he&#39;s best known for.<br>-More seriously, Tomato&#39;s Agent April Halloway claims to have joined the Floaters three years before the Reorganisation - or a full seven years before it was formed. My preferred explanation here would be that she means the DMO. However, if Tomato objects, I can tweak the story so that the Floaters existed as a minor department before the Great Consolidation.<br><br>With that out of the way... a graph!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/VisitPost.png"><br><br>A plot of unique IP visitors (black) and posts (blue) per day on the PPC Board, since March of last year. Strangely, we&#39;re in the middle of a plummet in both right now - which also happened this time <i>last</i> year - and, according to another graph, the year before (in terms of post counts). So... apparently something happens between ~March and May that either causes people to leave en masse, or causes people to stop coming to join us. Is it American exam season or something?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I had seen the Wrecked Music Department piece before.  I&#39;m not really a fan of the concept, since it doesn&#39;t seem like the PPC ever would have bothered doing something like this.  (Also, this one mission we see seems more like Plagiarism&#39;s purview.)<br><br>I like that the DCH finally gets some screen time, and that you used the opportunity to show how Mylissa went insane, as mentioned in her one other appearance.  Still, it&#39;s a little hard to imagine how a mission would go for any duck other than Mylissa, since they all seem to reinforce the same type of humor they would ostensibly be fighting against.<br><br>The DRS, I actually really like conceptually, because it would be an opportunity to do . . . shall we say, &quot;toned down&quot; romance fics, without all the icky stuff?  I might try looking for a mission that would work in this style for my floaters.  I am curious to know why this department had a flower as an agent; it would be the only Flower still going on active duty in the worlds after the Organisation expanded, yeah?<br><br>Godplayers is the one department I feel probably could have remained as its own department, but there&#39;s not much we can do about so few people having written in it.  I&#39;m glad it lived on as a division.<br><br>Willful Ignorance is my favorite of the ones presented by you here.  (It is &quot;willful,&quot; right?  Or is &quot;wilful&quot; an accepted spelling in English English?)  I love the technology you made here, and if you don&#39;t object, I would love to give it a spin with my floaters someday.  There&#39;s a huge amount of potential, both to let the first person&#39;d agent show off what they know about canon, and almost &quot;write&quot; things back to the way they should be in their mind, but also have the tech go haywire and create further complications.<br><br>All in all, some excellent and imaginative ideas here!</p>

            <p>The WMD &#39;mission&#39; is technically a training mission - &#39;Ice Ice Baby&#39; is a, uh, &#39;canonical&#39; song, so they couldn&#39;t kill it anyway. If it were, though, it would fall halfway between Plagiarism and Despatch - they have to find the stolen part and put it back. But yeah, it was basically an experiment by the Flowers that didn&#39;t pan out. The agents were pulled to go spend time in Floaters instead, and music gets to look after itself. ;)<br><br>The DCH&#39;s attitude is essentially the same as that of the original Slashers, Sean and Lux: if you spend your time doing something, then encountering it in a fic won&#39;t overwhelm you. At least, I assume that&#39;s what S&amp;L are going for... no, actually, I don&#39;t. I know full well what their motivation was.<br><br>Part of what I was trying for with these concepts was &#39;believable as a PPC department&#39;; WMD predates &#39;Ephemerals&#39;, but DRS and DUI were designed to be workable. So I&#39;m glad you liked it! As to why the Wallflower was working there - that&#39;s for it to know, and anyone who wants to write it to find out. <i>I&#39;ve</i> certainly got no idea. (Though I think there are hints of a few other Flower Agents... forget where, though)<br><br>Godplayers probably <i>could</i> have stayed, but either we bumped it off, or it got bumped off to make room for ESAS. Certainly most of its agents ended up in ESAS, and I suspect still get together in Rudi&#39;s for &#39;Godplayer Gatherings&#39;.<br><br>Wilful is a valid spelling, and one I prefer (for no real reason). All their tech is free-to-use, so go wild; just be aware that they shut down <i>because</i> it didn&#39;t work, so there was no incentive for anyone to keep working on it.<br><br>My biggest regret in this story is that I wasn&#39;t able to work Kayleigh into either the DRS or the DCH; her timeline just didn&#39;t fit. It was very tempting, though.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Either one makes teachers realize that they need to have a whole lot more paperwork filed then they have currently, so assign students all of the homework and give quizzes to prepare for the big test at the end.<br><br>Speaking of appearances on the Board: I&#39;m not going to have many soon. I know that recently I&#39;ve just about fallen off of the face of the Board, but something is coming up. Starting May 10th, I will be working at Denali National Park as an interpretive naturalist. Or, in simple terms, I&#39;m going to be a tour guide at Denali. They are providing housing for me (at the <a href="http://www.princesslodges.com/denali-lodge.cfm"> Denali Princess Lodge!</a> For only $15 a day!) and they do actually expect my off time to be spent preparing for presentations or being outdoors doing outdoorsy... things. Which means, not so much time online checking posts and writing PPC stories. If I have opportunity, I will try and take a look every now and then, but on the whole, I have to leave the community for a while.<br><br>This means that I have three things for the PPC that I want to try and get out before I go: the review for Rambling Band, the next part of that crossover I&#39;m working on, and those Alaska questions I was asked forever ago and never answered. I&#39;ll post the answers on the Board, and give opportunity for others to ask more if they want before I go. And hey, if you have any Alaska questions at any point, feel free to leave them on my Wiki page. I&#39;ll be sure to get to them as soon as I can. <br><br>Now, I&#39;m not leaving immediately, I do have until the 10th, but I suppose, for now, this is goodbye.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m working on creating a new agent at the moment, however I&#39;m not quite sure what to call her. The problem is is that she&#39;s a Quarian who&#39;s completed her Pilgrimage. I&#39;m not 100% sure if there&#39;s a limit on the given name or clan name (beyond most seeming to only be a couple of syllables long), and given she was part of the crew of a ship before she came to the PPC would she be &#39;vas [insert old ship name here]&#39; or &#39;vas PPC (or something like that)&#39;? </p>

            <p>Besides the suggestions hS has already made, I suppose she could potentially be vas [number on her RC]. It&#39;s a bit awkward, but it would make sense, if we choose to interpret Headquarters as her new fleet and all the RCs as individual ships.<br>As for whether or not she has to change her name, I&#39;m afraid I have no suggestions. I can&#39;t remember anything about Quarians who have chosen to leave the Fleet permanently, so I don&#39;t know what they would be called. I guess that makes it a personal decision for you/her, which could reflect how she feels about her old home and her new life.<br>Also, I don&#39;t know if you already know what her old ship was, but if not, have you considered having her come from the ship Qwib Qwib? It would make for a wonderful injoke.</p>

            <p>Thanks, I was thinking of it being more along the lines that the departments would compare to the ships if the Headquarters were the fleet, or maybe because of some misunderstanding, she thinks that the Headquarters is a ship of some kind and thus decides that because she&#39;s &#39;aboard&#39; the Headquarters she&#39;s vas Headquarters.<br><br>I have considered the Qwib Qwib as her old ship, however I&#39;m probably going to go with the Idenna, the quarian cruiser from Mass Effect: Ascension or another one of the cruisers that operate apart from the Migrant fleet.</p>

            <p>The best guide for the &#39;vas [What]&#39; question would seem to be Tali&#39;Zorah. The Mass Effect wiki suggests that her name changes from vas Neema to vas Normandy, which suggests that there <i>are</i> circumstances in which she&#39;d change her &#39;surname&#39;. I don&#39;t know the canon, but I&#39;d suspect that a permanent change would induce a name change. Whether it would be to vas PPC, vas Protectors, vas Headquarters (possibly my favourite), or vas [Department name], would probably be up to her - since I doubt she&#39;d be telling the, uh, Flotilla(?) about her new job.<br><br>As for given and clan names... I don&#39;t see any clear distinction between how the two are formed (for instance, &#39;Feda&#39; is a given name, &#39;Nara&#39; a clan, and similarly &#39;Zaal&#39; is a given, &#39;Raan&#39; a clan). Based on the names in &#39;Notable Quarians&#39;, we can deduce the following:<br><br>-Names start with a consonant, not a vowel - though this doesn&#39;t extend to ships.<br>-As you say, they don&#39;t go beyond a couple of syllables, and tend towards a CVCV(C) format - though the Consonants may be clusters, the Vowels may be doubled, or clustered, and there are a scattering of CVC - and even one CV - names.<br>-&#39;Ys&#39; is a consonantal sound (since it&#39;s used at the start of a name).<br>-&#39;-ah&#39; is a distinct terminal sound to &#39;-a&#39;.<br>-The letter C is not used, and I don&#39;t see W either. The most common consonant seems to be K.<br>-U is not used, and O and I are fairly uncommon.<br>-A and E are common, and can both appear as double letters, and as the cluster AE.<br>-Known consonant clusters are YS, SH, ZH, BR, and KH. MM, NN, RR, and DD also appear.<br>-At least one character (Keenah&#39;Breizh) has a very... well, <i>lazy</i> name. The first half is one letter away from the invocation &#39;keelah&#39;, while the second half is the Breton name for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany">Brittany</a>. Actually, I take back &#39;lazy&#39; - given the existence of a ship named <i>Normandy</i>, I think there&#39;s a Northern France theme here. (Which immediately suggests the clan name &#39;Kernow&#39; - Cornwall - to me)<br><br>I dunno. Anything useful there?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, I&#39;ve been looking into it, but the reason why Tali changes her name (or rather has her name changed) is that she was potentially going to be exiled from the fleet for effectively treason of the worst kind (Link for more info: <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Tali:_Treason"><a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Tali:_Treason">http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Tali:_Treason</a></a>). I&#39;ve been looking into it on my own, but couldn&#39;t really find much more than what I already knew, having played the trilogy through twice (and going for a third playthrough when I have the time). <br>Thanks for the suggestions, I think I&#39;d agree with you on vas Headquarters. <br><br>Thanks again for the help on clan and given names. I&#39;ll probably try and play around with this, and put up the profiles at some point soon. </p>

            <p>So, I was working on some ideas for PPC agents last night, and I began to wonder about something. <br><br>If I present them in the same way that I present my agents (meaning, light hearted and funny, as per PPC standards), is it okay to invent some recurring antagonists for my agents?</p>

            <p>&quot;Recurring antagonists&quot; could mean any number of things. Is it a few Suvians who they failed to kill in one mission, who then keep following them around and causing trouble whenever the Agents enter their continuum? Is it a trans-dimensional organization that your agents offended for some reason, and keeps intruding during missions to try and capture the Agents? Is it a single force that generally dislikes this one group of two or three people for whatever reason, and invades their missions to deliberately and spitefully cause problems?<br>None of those three are particularly great ideas for something that shows up all the time in a mission, because it&#39;s going to eclipse the rest of the badfic if it happens too many times, and even if it doesn&#39;t, it would be an interference. Most antagonists in a PPC story tend to either be from within an individual badfic, in which case it&#39;s self-contained within the mission, from a series of stories that a Sue appears in or a single badfic writer who makes many similar fics, which is similar to the previous option but there are recurring elements that may play a role during the mission, or from an out-of-fic threat like the Black Cats or Slorp. That&#39;s because in all of those cases, the presence of an enemy either enhances the mission in which it&#39;s encountered or does not intersect with any recorded mission and operates on its own.<br><br>Of course, that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s <i>impossible</i> for a recurring threat to be done well in this context. It&#39;s just that the PPC format doesn&#39;t really fit well with the concept of an archenemy. It is fully possible for something to be structured in a way that can take advantage of the nature of the PPC and still act as a recurring opponent, it&#39;s just not something that&#39;s been done yet. So, it will take at least a few more details before we can see if your idea would work. What did you have in mind?</p>

            <p>Okay, well, one specific example that I have in mind is a member of the PPC Legal Department who dislikes one of my agents, and is constantly trying to get another, who is almost always breaking the rules, arrested. I have him in mind for other stories besides missions, mostly, but he is my example.<br><br>He is based off of a combination of Atticus Finch and Hannibal Lecter. He is a smart lawyer, but he is also a jerk who takes the rules very seriously. The agent he wants to arrest is a nearly insane member of the Mary Sue Experimentation and Research Department, and the agent he dislikes for more personal reasons is from his fanfic of origin, which will likely remain unnamed because it doesn&#39;t really exist. (Just to double check, when creating characters, they don’t necessarily have to be from existing fics, right?)</p>

            <p>Featuring an agent of Legal would really deprive the department of the aura of mystery that makes the whole thing work - sure, there <i>are</i> named agents there, but we&#39;ve never seen one in the flesh and I think doing so would ruin Legal&#39;s mystique and reputation, especially since the department&#39;s dedicated to enforcing the laws of the multiverse without bias.

            <p>Intel&#39;s such an ideal location because he can easily create conditions that can cause them to be forced out of action, be it being killed, snapping in action or screwing up so severely they&#39;re removed from the field - though keep in mind the kind of thing that&#39;d get someone expelled from the PPC entirely is probably a really serious crime, not something he could create unless he frames them for something.</p>

            <p>We&#39;ve only ever seen members of Legal a handful of times(it&#39;s usually the Fern), always connected to something extremely important. Having someone representing or formerly representing Legal going after another PPC employee for some perceived slight or other not only breaks the whole persona, it casts a bad light on the sort of people that Legal as a whole would hire to uphold the Narrative Laws.<br><br>Also, the DIA is not going to be anyone&#39;s flunkies. That&#39;s not how it works. They&#39;re their own fully realized group, with their own means of operation. If there was an Agent acting up, they wouldn&#39;t need to be sicced on the offender by some observer; they&#39;d analyze the situation and deal with it themselves. Sure, a patrol officer or someone noticing potentially illegal activity would have to report it, because they&#39;re not omniscient or anything, but they don&#39;t need to be subservient to some shadowy figure in order to deal with people who are breaking the rules. That&#39;s already the majority of their job.</p>

            <p>As much potential as there is with Legal&#39;s workings, exploring them would ruin what Legal <i>is</i> in a sense, their role in this setting.

            <p>Yes, it was mostly just an example, but if he were to be in Legal, he would not always have been the way I described him.

            <p>I&#39;ve reread it several times, and I&#39;m still not entirely sure what you&#39;re trying to say with it. One or more of your Agents would break so many rules of the PPC so regularly that he constantly has a DIA squad on his back, and this means that the DIA squad would be someone&#39;s cronies? Whose? The rule-braking Agent&#39;s? The probably-ever-only-claimed-to-work-for-Legal guy? How do those two points match up? I don&#39;t get it.</p>

            <p>So, here&#39;s what I meant.<br><br>There are going to be a couple of agents of mine who break rules, and therefore some people in the PPC believe that they are detrimental to the organization as a whole. For example, a member of the Department of Mary Sue Experimentation and Research who has gone off the deep end and somehow still hangs around. He would join forces with the DIA to try and get him over to FicPsych. That sort of thing. And he dislikes my agents who are sane because they stand up for the ones who are not and insist that they stay on the team. <br><br>The ideas are still evolving, so that is just an example.</p>

            <p>With any story about rule-breakers, a lot depends on exactly which rules they break, and how they break them.<br><br>For example, if your agents actively kill canon characters just to get at the Sues, then your antagonist won&#39;t have to worry about finding henchmen.  All the other agents will be queuing up to work for him.  And not just the agents.  All the boarders and other members too!<br><br>OTOH if your agents regularly turn a blind eye to some of the Sues&#39; lesser (but still chargeable) offences, then why is the antagonist picking on these agents rather than all the other ones who do the same?<br></p>

            <p>Well, what I have specifically in mind is that one of my Agents who works with the Department of Mary Sue Experimentation and Research is infamous for his insane experiments, and since he is going senile, he doesn&#39;t realize that he puts his lab assistants in peril. His most successful experiment is going to be that he implanted additional personality traits into a captured Shakespeare Sue to make her a well rounded character and so that th Mary Sue traits were more like traits of a real person, meaning they have drawbacks. Since Mary Sues are not usually allowed into HQ, this makes people, especially the assassins, uneasy, because she works in the Department of Mary Sues as an assassin herself, but her Mary Sue traits are still there.<br><br>These are some examples of what rules they will be breaking, because for the reasons I have stated above, the scientist agent is constantly being banned from his lab, but always finds a way back in.</p>

            <p>What&#39;s that about &quot;no Mary Sues allowed in HQ&quot;? They&#39;re not allowed to run around freely, no, but the reformed Sues have just as much self-determinance as any other character, provided that they&#39;re taking all of the necessary measures to prevent relapse, such as the use of Logicillin and help from the Psychs, and the Sues that are being tested by the Psychs and the DMSEAR are kept restrained or in stasis when there aren&#39;t any tests taking place. There are plenty of ex-Mary Sues that are agents here. That&#39;s not really all that much of a problem. While I can see some people being suspicious of an ex-Sue agent because of her background, it wouldn&#39;t put someone who made an agent out of a Sue on some kind of watch list.<br>To another point, since PPC policy means that Mary Sues aren&#39;t considered truly sapient, while it might be unnerving for an outsider to see someone experimenting on them and putting them through numerous mental modifications, the higher-ups wouldn&#39;t get one of the scientists in trouble just for doing so, especially if the PPC gets a new agent out of his research. The department is called Department of Mary Sue Experiments and Research, after all. The experimentation is a big part of their job.<br><br>For the last part, though, that makes more sense. The DMSEAR doesn&#39;t have a lot of active scientists, so not only would potential danger to any of the lab workers would need to be cut down as much as possible, it would make sense that they wouldn&#39;t send someone into retirement after he&#39;d started becoming unstable, they&#39;d just keep him away from the current tests and subjects and such so he wouldn&#39;t mess anything up. His scientific knowledge could be important in the future, after all. Yet, he&#39;d gotten so attached to his work over the years that he keeps coming in when no one else is around, just trying to finish his last project, and he either does not know why or can&#39;t remember why everyone is always trying to get rid of him. There&#39;s character potential in that.</p>

            <p>I see.

            <p>The PPC at least recognises Sues as sentient enough that torturing them, like torturing anything else, is strictly forbidden; at least one agent has actually been arrested by the DIA then forced to go to FicPsych for it. So if the experiments start crossing into the inhumane I imagine there&#39;d be some trouble.</p>

            <p>You could take totally the opposite approach, and make the antagonist one of the Flowers.

            <p>Keep in mind a few things, though:<br>1) There would still need to be a good reason why it was doing what the story makes it do. Petty grudges or minor whims are still not the best motivation of someone in authority, though admittedly, a Flower would probably be able to spin some of the minor mishaps agents get up to on a daily basis into a legitimate grievance in case of trouble.<br>2) Since the Flowers are of a higher status, one of them picking on members of another Flower&#39;s staff might result in a loss of standing for the aggressor. Only the Department/Division Heads are allowed to ruin their agents&#39; lives, consarn it! On the plus side, if the &quot;rogue&quot; Flower is found out and demoted or something, the grudge wouldn&#39;t be nearly as petty any more.<br>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing something else crucial, but I&#39;m pressed for time now and don&#39;t want to have to retype my post later.<br><br>Well, you&#39;ve never heard of it because there&#39;s been no Acacia Flower shown in any stories yet. That doesn&#39;t mean one can&#39;t be made, of course! It would be a bit of a one-joke character, but it would at least be an amusing single joke.</p>

            <p>Not only would we get to see some passive-aggressive competition between the two sides, if one causes problems for someone, the disrupted employee could pick up their basics from the other, ensuring that there would have to be at least some modicum of customer service remaining even if the Morning Glory decides to get spiteful. Plus, the fact that someone else in HQ does the same thing it does and it&#39;s not powerful enough to do anything about it could lead to even more seething.<br>Oh, what if, after seeing how ambitious and encompassing the Morning Glory was, the Wisteria set up the Supply Depot expressly for the purpose of keeping the other Flower in check? It makes sense given his personality; since the Wisteria never liked direct management, and Crashing Down says that &quot;his Divisions operate by shouting as loud as they can for attention&quot;, he might think a little healthy competition would help show the Morning Glory its place without him needing to be disrupted from whatever he was doing that day to deal with the matter officially.<br><br>Personally, I think being official Quartermaster would mean that the Morning Glory would have a larger number of the standard-issue basics and that she would be the one responsible for outfitting new agents for the first time, ensuring it had at least a bit of guaranteed workflow by the other Flowers, while Kelemen would have a wider range of potential items for sale, but not many of the more official wares at one time. There&#39;s nothing to support that beyond speculation, but it seems like a logical enough distinction to make.</p>

            <p>The mission the Depot&#39;s appeared in pretty much had it doing exactly that - it didn&#39;t charge, you just went to Kelemen with what you needed and he got it. It&#39;s not like the difference between, I dunno, the Armoury and Big Murphy&#39;s, because the Depot&#39;s implied to sorta be the official supply place.<br><br>(Also keep in mind the 2006 invasions were almost eight years ago.

            <p>I don&#39;t know if anyone else has used the Supply Depot or Kelemen Totth. When I added them in to the story, it was with the idea that since agents basically don&#39;t get paid, but somehow all have uniforms, people always have chalk, candles, and bells, and the minis all get fed (even the ones with specialized diets), that the PPC should have some sort of place where basic supplies are issued not really for free, more like as part of the job--like how uniforms are supplied to armies. Kelemen had a list (that seemed to sort of magically update) of every agent and their minis, and what the agent was issued was entirely a standard set of items based on that. Luxury items like chocolate and bleep-products were not included at all. Tech products and weapons were also not included at all, because they have their own places. This was much more like the very basics--mini supplies, uniforms (on a replacement schedule), and those little items for things like exorcism that don&#39;t fall under tech, weapons, or canon source, but are still needed. Nothing from the Supply Depot would be fancy at all. Just the absolute basics.<br><br>I very intentionally left it vague, so that other people could fill in more details as the story progressed. I think the idea that he works directly for the Morning Glory works best with what I originally had in mind (and makes continuity simpler, if that is what we want). The Flower is the Quarter Master who keeps track of supplies and determines what is on the lists, and he is the manual labor that interacts with the agents. I have no idea where they would obtain these standard items--that might make for some interesting infrastructure stories. <br><br>Also, I think it would be funny to see agents that had destroyed their uniforms (through whatever means) way before it would be time to issue a new set, and had to face the wrath of the Morning Glory or scrounge enough trade goods to buy replacements at one of the stores.</p>

I do. Also Pokémon, Metroid, Zelda, Ace Attorney, Etrian Odyssey, Doctor Who, Torchwood, Harry Potter, A Song of Ice and Fire, Questionable Content, The Order of the Stick and 8-bit Theatre. (Bad American spell-check. Down.)<br>Oh, and my favourite fanfic is My Immortal.<br>...<br>Don&#39;t look at me like that...<br>As for me, I&#39;m from New Zealand (is Trojie still around? She&#39;s from Wellington, right? Love your work, Trojie) and am NOT A GIRL (shock).<br>I first read the original PPC some years ago, and immediately wanted to join in. Then I read Permission requirements and my nerve broke (why do I have to sit an exam to write a story? Jay and Acacia were much more forgiving...)<br>Anyway, I think I&#39;m running up against the character limit, so I&#39;&#39;ll leave it there. And once again, hello all! (please don&#39;t eat me)</p>

            <p>OI!  OVER HERE!  Welcome a&#39;Board, and welcome to the PPC!  One, for your n00b gift, have one coupon for a free custom gunblade of your choice, smithed by yours truly.  Also, I&#39;m thinking of buying Fire Emblem:  Awakening.  Should I?  Pokemon... What&#39;s your starter?  Metroid, been meaning to pick one up.  Zelda?  HELL YES.  Ace Attorney, memes abound, and that&#39;s about it.  Etrian Odyssey... never heard of it.  Doctor Who?  EXTERMINATE!  Torchwood, heard of it, and that&#39;s all.  Harry Potter.  Hello fellow Potterhead!  A Song of Ice and Fire, been meaning to read it, too busy.  Last ones I have also never heard of.  Nearly done here, but do you have ANY IDEA how much text 16 Kilobytes holds?!  Easily any of the posts.  You weren&#39;t anywhere near.  Last but not least, watch out for the tea leaves.</p>

            <p>If you like strategy RPGs, definitely get Awakening. It&#39;s the best game on the 3DS, as far as I&#39;m concerned (my four separate playthroughs and obsessive buying of the DLC stand tribute to the enjoyment I got from it. Oh, and my 60-odd hours on Fire Emblem 8 (which was part of the Ambassador Programme way back when (stacked brackets woo!))).<br>If you&#39;re reading ASoIaF, be prepared for all of your favourite characters in it to die. Only two of the characters I&#39;ve been rooting for are still alive. :-(<br>Which generation of Pokémon are you talking about? I have shinies of Torchic&#39;s entire line, so maybe that at the moment. But Treecko, Piplup and Fennekin are all pretty nice, too.<br>I suppose I should have thought about this: 16kB = 16*2^10 = 16384 characters. Which is far more than I ever expect to post.<br>Gun... blade? I&#39;m, uh, not certain that&#39;s safe. Is it retractable, like Link&#39;s in Exoria?</p>

            <p>Cool.  I&#39;m definitely gonna get it then.  Any generation.  My personal favourite starter would have to be Turtwig.  Gunblade... how to explain?  Well, a Gunblade is a blade and  a gun, together in one weapon.  Sometimes they are retractable  , or can even have a few forms.  An example would be some of my own creation, a pair of tonfa with chainsaw blades and a built in SMG.  Or a pair of over-sized hatchets with with shotguns built into the head.  As you could imagine, THWACK, BLAM! your blade is free.

            <p>Sure!  <br> Link wields a gunsword, which is effectively a longsword that can fold back up to a silenced handgun...or vice-versa. <br>...a Valentine Duchess personally led Valentine forces against Zoran crusaders in battle more than two hundred years ago, and, using a gunsword, achieved two hundred and thirty-two confirmed kills to her name personally.<br>Hey... you know the VBCS?  It sounds awfully similar.  If you want, I could combine the two?  Spice it up a little.  What I&#39;d do, is have the standard longsword/pistol combo, but with the pistol in the handle of the sword.  I&#39;d also add a rope of some sort to it, and a new mode.  Said mode would allow the blade to fold back onto the top of the pistol and let you swing it around, like a kusarigama.  Last but not least, depending on how you fight. If you wanted versatility, I could either give you exchangeable weaponry, ranging from: a shotgun, high-power revolver, your standard silenced pistol, and a machine pistol, or if you want durability and a reliable, deadly weapon, I could just put an extended mag and fire selection dial on the standard pistol.  Also, I&#39;m gonna need the names of all the guns.  Gunblades are serious freakin&#39; business.  Also, take joy in the fact that you are the only one who has redeemed their coupon. </p>

            <p>OK, what we have here is Link&#39;s gunsword, standard.  However, there is now a matte black auto-loading Raging Judge Magnum revolver, instead of the suppressed semi-auto.  The Raging Judge is capable of firing the .454 Casull, a MONSTER of a bullet.  This round should be used for when you need to kill something extremely strong, or when you need to take out 2-4 mooks standing in a row.  It will fire a .45 Colt round as well, which is a good round for when you want something dead, but not blown to pieces (see .454 Casull).  Finally, a 3 inch shotgun shell.  This is for when you want to have a shot-pistol/personal defence gun.  It also has an enhanced ammo cap of 12, using roughly the same mechanisms in the Bioshock 2 shotgun ammo upgrade.  This gives you everything short of full auto fire.  It also has a high-tensile, razor sharp chain, and it&#39;s blade can extend partway for similar functionality to a VBCS, while keeping the gunswords&#39; spirit.  The chain can function as garrotte wire, and is also capable of making shallow cuts to a fleshy target that are prone to bleeding a lot.  I will mention that the 3 inch shot shell is recommended for swinging around, or a Casull for when you want ridiculous speeds.  Overall, the entire weapon is made of the same allotrope as Link&#39;s weapon, and is ridiculously hard to dent, much less break.  Also, if you like, I can quickly edit the description to make the gun chromed instead.  Custom, silver bullet style Anti-Sue ammunition is also available, with the complete works of whichever author you need micro-inscripted on the bullet.  Excellent for exorcisms or especially persistent sues.  You get 12 Anti-Sue Casull rounds in LOTR, HP, and Naruto stylings.  Any more and you have to pay.  Also, congrats on being the first to get a high quality, custom TwisTed Blade!</p>

            <p>Yes, I&#39;ve read the Original Series. And all of Trojie&#39;s stuff. And most of the stuff on Huinesoron&#39;s Webplex. And once I started to read the entire body of PPC fiction, but I gave up, because it was mostly pretty generic. Also, it&#39;s less interesting to read if you aren&#39;t a fan of the series in question.<br>I first came across the PPC several years ago, while browsing TV Tropes. I read the first mission, went &quot;Jay And this Ditto is super cute! Yay!</p>

            <p>Hi! Welcome to the PPC. <br><br>Oh, I like Harry Potter as well. <br><br>My Immortal?! Yeah! My Immortal is an example of so bad it&#39;s good, and I like that about it. Very, very bad story, but very enjoyable to criticize and stuff. It gives you a sense of superiority, even though you really ought not compare yourself with those who are not as good as you are. <br><br>I knew someone from New Zealand back in my Fanfiction.net days. The story &quot;The Gratest Pokemon Master&quot; wouldn&#39;t mean anything to you, would it? Because that was a fic he wrote as satire.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it is. And that would be fine with me. But there is one problem. Throughout the games, Link doesn&#39;t usually show any psychological effects from his adventures. Or at least as far as I have noticed. Sure, he becomes more inventive, and he becomes way more brave than he may have been, but there have to be some negative things that happen to that mind of his, right?<br><br>Otherwise, the games seem decent to good. Most of them.</p>

            <p>Ooh, presents! I do so love presents!<br>Etrian Odyssey is a... dungeon crawler, I guess. You choose from a handful of preset character looks for each class, give them names, then go out into the wide world. You can take five at a time, with some exceptions (but I won&#39;t say too much). The older ones were on DS (and I haven&#39;t played them. I believe they were rather more difficult). The one I have is number 4, and it has a range of features designed to make it more accessible (the others are seriously hard. 4 can be, if you choose Normal difficulty).<br>Of course, the main draw for me is that you have to draw your own maps. Best. Game. Ever! :-p</p>

            <p>I bring you... answers to questions!<br><br>-Alas, Trojie left a long time ago.<br>-The character limit, as someone else said, is absolutely massive. I once posted <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_RLF3oGSMN1h1SzbEzW6ldcEuZPfJHvAfM3FxHwHeQc/pub">this entire story</a> in a single post - so nope, you weren&#39;t anywhere near it. ;)<br>-Permission... ah, Permission.<br><br>You&#39;re right, <a href="http://misssandman.com/PPC/rules.html">Jay and Acacia were a lot more lenient about it</a>. But when <s>Rome fell, like a writhen oak</s> Jay left the Board, she appointed Miss Cam, GreyLadyBast, and Thalia Weaver as Official Permission Givers (all right, Cam technically already had it). From that point on, Permission has been a requirement, not just a suggestion. The way we give it has evolved: I got Permission by basically saying &#39;I&#39;ve got a great idea!&#39; and having Cam &amp; Bast approve.<br><br>The thing is, Back In The Day(TM) the PPC was just a bunch of stories with a vague theme. Architeuthis could write about the Security Dandelions who patrol the walls of HQ without anyone worrying, because no-one else had gone anywhere near that part of HQ.<br><br>Since then - and largely (he said modestly) as a result of my work - we&#39;ve turned the PPC into a true shared universe. You can&#39;t (say) decide to found a Department of Multiple Offences, like Nenya and Rosie did - because that job is already filled by the Floaters. The only ways to maintain a working shared universe with so many writers are either to vet each new story regarding canonicity... or to require Permission to write for the PPC at all.<br><br>With that said, getting Permission isn&#39;t all that hard. Once the revision goes through, the process will be as follows:<br><br>-Stick around until we know who you are. That&#39;s not hard, and if you want anyone to know your story exists, you&#39;d kind of have to do it anyway.<br>-Read enough that you know what the PPC is, how it works, etc. It&#39;s kind of common sense to do this for something you want to write about, right? The &#39;Permission Self-Check&#39; or whatever I called it is just that - an optional check for you to see for yourself how much you know. It doesn&#39;t even take your name.<br>-Come up with some agent characters. You&#39;d have to do that anyway, since without characters you can&#39;t, y&#39;know, write anything. (Though I&#39;d be intrigued to see someone ask Permission in order to write solely about Free-to-Use characters...)<br>-Write a couple of short - 200-300 words - stories with your agents. Since you want to write PPC stories, saying you have to write some PPC stories before you can do so - apart from being oxymoronic - isn&#39;t terribly strenuous.<br>-Post the stories &amp; a summary of your agents and ask for Permission. That takes... about a minute?<br>-Wait for one of the hard-working Permission Givers to put in the time to read your stories and form an opinion.<br><br>That&#39;s a lot of words, but it&#39;s honestly not a big deal. It comes down to &#39;stick around, get to know us, and show us you can write&#39;. The basic goal is to stop you spending weeks on your first mission, and <i>then</i> having someone point out that your agent is a Mary-Sue. Because no-one wants that.<br><br>Lots of words? Lots of words. Permission isn&#39;t hard if you know what a decent character is and know how to spell-and-punctuate. +++End of message.+++<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Okay, folks, folkettes, folkarans, folkonians, and folksters! For the past few months we&#39;ve been quietly working on a revamped and (hopefully) easier and smoother path to getting Permission. Rather than the current &#39;link to one of your stories and we&#39;ll complain that it&#39;s not quite the write sort of story, and also that your bios don&#39;t tell us enough&#39;, we&#39;re going for &#39;write two short PPC scenes based on random prompts, so we can see your agents, adore them, and give you Permission with no further hassle&#39;. Sounds cool, no? No? Shh.<br><br>Anyway. In order to do this, we need to actually come up with the random prompts - and rewrite the Wiki article to accommodate the change. That&#39;s what we&#39;ve been trying to do, and we need your opinions.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IE81HONRJnp0IaK92GvzyL00CZYNZG_pvdo93gRMIhY/edit?usp=sharing">This finely-crafted link</a> goes to the document that contains both of those things. The Wiki article is above, and the prompts below. I&#39;ve restricted editing to comments, so please comment on:<br><br>-Things you think need changing in the Wiki sections. This can include the wholesale addition of FAQs, and actual alterations to the way things work. Also please comment on any ongoing discussions, if you have something to say.<br><br>-Any problems you see in the instructions for the prompts. They&#39;re meant to be self-explanatory - if you have to ask &#39;What?&#39;, then they&#39;re not, and we need to know so they can be rewritten.<br><br>-Any issues you have with the prompts themselves. They&#39;re set up so that each box has one prompt (the top) that can apply to <i>anyone</i>, and one that may not apply to every agent.<br><br>-Anything else!<br><br>This request is particularly for Permission Givers (who&#39;ll have to deal with the resulting requests), those who have recently been granted (or not granted) Permission (and therefore know best how the <i>current</i> system works), and those who are thinking of seeking Permission (and thus have a vested interest in having a system that works). But comments from anyone else are also welcome!<br><br>And since the first question I get is always &#39;deadline?&#39;, let&#39;s say one week from today. Unless there&#39;s significant ongoing debate, we&#39;ll roll it out on Friday 9th May, 2014.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This new version makes it a lot less stressful for Permission-requesters.

            <p>I had a quick look and I really don&#39;t like it.<br><br>It seems most of those prompts are about the boring, non-mission bits of a story that no-one ever bothers to read because we all just skip past them to get to the good part where you poke fun at the badfic and kill the Sues responsible for it.<br><br>Maybe it&#39;d be if the prompts gave us examples of badfic writing and we had to show how we&#39;d mock them and how our agents would react to it.  Otherwise what&#39;s the point?  No-one, not even Jay and Acacia themselves, ever managed to make the non-mission parts of a PPC story interesting, so how are we expected to do it?<br><br>(Having said that, at least Dark Brother 16 deserves credit for trying to think of ways that the HQ stuff can at least be made relevant to the mission, with his bureaucratic antagonist idea.  It&#39;s just a shame the killjoys are all trying to stop him, rather than suggest ways his idea could be made to work.)<br><br>(BTW you seem to be one of the worst offenders for wasting readers&#39; time with pointless HQ stuff.  Some of your stories don&#39;t even have any mission in them at all!  Until you can fix that problem with your own stories, I don&#39;t see what gives you the right to judge others!)<br><br>Anyway, other problems with the permission procedure are that we have to think up out own agents.  Yes, I know this is something inherited from the old system, but it still needs to be fixed.  If I should ever see a badfic so bad that I personally want to be the one to kill it, then I won&#39;t want to waste my time having to create new characters before applying for permission to do it.  I&#39;d just want to grab a couple of off-the-shelf, free-to-use agents and send them after her as quickly as possible.<br></p>

            <p>Just speaking what&#39;s on my mind.<br><br>I guess it&#39;s because I&#39;m coming at this from the perspective someone who <i>hates </i>writing fiction.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, it was one of those unpleasant things we were forced to do in school, like dissecting frogs, that I can&#39;t imagine anyone doing unless they absolutely <i>have </i>to.  (But that &quot;have to&quot; includes &quot;have to because your innate skill and talent for writing compels you to.&quot;)<br><br>So, yeah, the thing about the PPC that I love is the missions, the way they&#39;re taking the piss out of stories that really shouldn&#39;t have been written but Suethors went ahead and wrote them anyway, even though they didn&#39;t need to!  That&#39;s just about the main thing that makes the PPC so much better than ACMSES or the OFUs, and why I chose to follow you rather than them.<br><br>My ideal PPC fic would start with the agents arriving on the badfic side of the portal, and end with them leaving after having killed the Sue.  Nothing else.  (Seriously, is there anyone who likes reading all the pointless HQ stuff?)<br><br>If I ever ask for permission, it&#39;ll be because I&#39;ve seen a badfic I hate so much that I <i>have </i>to write its death personally.  And I won&#39;t want to waste my time doing all the boring writing-fiction stuff like creating characters and especially deciding what they look like.<br><br>(And the annoying thing is that I have seen a couple of badfics I might like to be the one to kill.  And it&#39;s just the thought of all the unecessary writing that&#39;s putting me off asking for permission!)<br></p>

            <p>And I like writing it, too. In fact, it&#39;s my favorite part of any mission, because the authors aren&#39;t restricted to their agents&#39; reactions to the badfic. It&#39;s just two people chilling in their RC either shooting the breeze or trying not to shoot each other, or wandering about HQ and interacting with other agents, or buying some lava mitts to give their mini-Balrog a hug. It&#39;s the entire universe of the PPC that makes it so fascinating to me, and I want to see it all.<br><br>It might seem odd to you, but character interaction is one of my favorite parts of any story. Everyone knows that agents go into badfics and kill them, but what is Headquarters like? What do the agents do in their free time? Why do they act the way they do? How do they interact with people other than their partner?<br><br>A lot of what has made the PPC different from the rest of the Canon Protection Initiative is our shared world and story format. Without the &#39;pointless HQ stuff&#39;, we&#39;re just a group of people who write disconnected stories where people go into badfics and kill them as part of their own vigilante justice system.<br><br>Without the HQ stuff, we set ourselves up as the fanfiction police, and I don&#39;t think there are many of us here who want that reputation.<br><br>I doubt I&#39;ve convinced you, but think about it this way: have you ever watched a YouTube video of a cat playing a piano? Probably. Did it serve a purpose? Of course not! But it was funny, right? A lot of stuff we as humans do is pointless, but we do it anyway because we think it&#39;s enjoyable- and that right there is enough to make it not pointless.</p>

            <p>...If you hate writing fiction so much, and seem to really disapprove of the PPC setting being more than glorified MSTs, why even be here? I&#39;m not sure I understand why you don&#39;t just write MSTs then, which is of course perfectly valid in its own right.<br><br>(Also, an MST doesn&#39;t literally have to be done with the MST3K crew, if I&#39;m understanding a point you made in one of your replies to hS correctly.

            <p>To answer both your questions in one:<br><br>I don&#39;t usually enjoy MSTs that don&#39;t feature the SOL crew.  An OC MSTer in the theatre feels as wrong as, for example, an OC Tenth Walker in the Fellowship.<br><br>Maybe it&#39;s because nearly every OC MSTer I&#39;ve read seems to be a thinly-disguised Sue or Possession Sue who speaks Gratuitous Fangirl Japanese at every opportunity even when they&#39;re not MSTing anime fics, and they&#39;re not even characters who should know any Japanese in the first place.<br><br>(When you read Frodo and Sam as the MSTers calling a character &quot;baka&quot; or &quot;hentai,&quot; suddenly the badfic being MSTed doesn&#39;t seem so bad.)<br></p>

            <p>I think you&#39;ll find that the majority of people here like the &quot;HQ stuff&quot;.  That&#39;s why there are whole series dedicated to FicPsych, the Kitchen Staff, Postal Department, DoSAT, Building Maintenance, and others.

And when I say &#39;most&#39;, I mean &#39;I can&#39;t think of anyone who&#39;s ever said otherwise&#39;. Some have <i>difficulty</i> with it, of course, but that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t enjoy it.<br><br>So, to answer your question, yes, most of us like reading the, uh, &#39;pointless HQ stuff&#39;. It&#39;s what differentiates PPC writing from MSTs.<br><br>And, actually, if I can interrupt myself, you might find MSTs more your reading style. If you haven&#39;t run into them before, they consist literally of going through a story line by line and mocking it. <a href="http://www.alswaiter.net/LOTR/msts.htm">AW&#39;s site has some examples</a>, or you can probably find your own to suit your fandoms. Anyway, back on topic.<br><br>So I was quite baffled by your &#39;Until you can fix that problem with your own stories&#39;, since, well, a lot of what I&#39;m known for is <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/index.htm">the non-mission stuff</a>, and your defining it as a &#39;problem&#39; is rather strange - from <i>my</i> point of view. If you&#39;re coming from the viewpoint that the only good thing the PPC can do is kill badfic, then yeah, I can see that would make sense. But I really can&#39;t get my head around that idea.<br><br>Can I just ask: why do you read anything at all? You read PPC missions for the snark, and it seems from context that you read fanfic to laugh at how bad it is. Do you read anything else? Because as far as I can see, you&#39;re classing everything other than mocking bad writing as &#39;pointless HQ stuff&#39; and its equivalents; how do you get through, say, a novel?<br><br>Also: you said &#39;I&#39;d just want to grab a couple of off-the-shelf, free-to-use agents&#39;. Thing is, we don&#39;t actually have a lot of free-to-use Action agents (Lux, maybe?), and a lot of the ones we do - recruits from badfics - have very little personality defined. You&#39;d still have to decide on their character before you tried to write them. That&#39;s... just how writing a character works.<br><br>Like I&#39;ve said earlier, MSTs may be more your cup of tea. You can take the in-character approach like AW, or you can literally sit down and eviscerate a story line by line, just detailing everything that&#39;s wrong with it. No fiction-writing in sight - just pure snarky dissection.<br><br>hS, still... rather baffled</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.<br><br>The reason don&#39;t like writing fiction is that I have so many story ideas that are all <b>alive</b> in my head.  And by &quot;alive&quot; I mean they&#39;re all active, jumping about from the end to the beginning then back to the middle, and twisting and altering and changing themselves all the time.<br><br>But in writing the story out, I have to start at the beginning and continue to the end in a straight line, with no contradictions, and just basically suffocating, murdering the once-living idea in my head.  It&#39;s so depressing to see the corpse being laid out one word at a time.  How do you guys cope with that?<br><br>My other problem is writing descriptions.  I&#39;m just not the sort of person who thinks visually at all.  There have been times in real life when I&#39;ve literally not noticed whether someone was black or white.  That&#39;s how non-visual my mind is!<br><br>OTOH I love writing dialogue.  It&#39;s the one bit I enjoy.  I&#39;m just not any good at it.  All my characters all seem to speak with exactly the same voice.  It&#39;s annoying.<br><br>So, if there was a type of fiction with no descriptions, no plot, and only one speaking character, I&#39;d love to write it.  (But who would ever want to read it?)<br><br>Anyway, to get on to your other questions...<br><br>Yes, I do love reading.  I really, really love reading.  But what I love to read depends on my mood.  I tend to go for PPC stuff when I&#39;m in a vicious, bad-tempered mood and want the satisfaction of seeing something nasty being disposed of.  Otherwise, there are plenty of other things I could be reading instead.<br><br>And yes, I love MSTs.  I&#39;ve even tried writing them in the past, but without much success.  I&#39;m British but Mike, Joel and the Bots are all American and make many America-specific references that I don&#39;t even understand and can&#39;t get right when I try to do them.  (e.g. I&#39;ve only recently found out that it&#39;s a company called The Land of Dairy Queen, not a person called the Landov Diary Queen!)<br><br>Yes, the alternative is to create my own own characters instead of the SOL crew, but that brings us right back to where we started.  Not to mention that new characters take it further from MST3K canon, and respecting canon is as important to me as it is to the rest of you.<br><br>And of course, there&#39;s the problem of writing the various host segments, invention exchanges, etc. that people fast forward past to get to the MST proper.<br><br>More importantly, MSTs don&#39;t have the cathartic release of seeing the main character being killed by the MSTers at the end.  (You know, I&#39;d love to see Mike accidentally blow up the Sue&#39;s world during the final host segment at the end of a MST!)<br><br>Anyway, thanks for your patience.  And I promise that if I ever do apply for (and get) permission, I&#39;ll make dure my story includes at least a couple of scene of tedious HQ stuff, just to keep you guys happy.<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been mulling over how to best respond to this series of posts. My previous attempts have all been scrapped due to my coming off as antagonistic and jerk-like. I can&#39;t say whether this post will come off any better, but I&#39;ll give it my best.<br><br>I put it to you that an untold story, regardless of how fluid or dynamic it might seem to you, is far more &quot;dead&quot; than anything put to a page. You say that your ideas are &quot;alive&quot; in your head because they have the ability to change and evolve. That&#39;s all very well and good, but change for who? You craft a beautiful and moving story in your head. Who&#39;s being moved? You&#39;re the only person who can see these spectral narratives. It&#39;s all very well to say you have ideas, but ideas not acted upon are ultimately pointless.<br><br>I feel a great deal of satisfaction when I wrap up a written piece. I haven&#39;t killed the story; I&#39;ve given it to my audience. People get to see this thing that I have crafted for them, this world to which I have given substance, these characters into whom I have poured my sweat and blood. And if I can move the readers in some way? If I can make someone laugh or cry or think with my words? Pure gold.<br><br>Yeah, not everything you write is going to make you happy. You have to compromise. Sometimes that leads to mistakes. I&#39;ve looked at plenty of my old pieces and gone &quot;Shoot, I&#39;d wish I done this instead of that.&quot; I don&#39;t let that stop me from writing. It just means I try twice as hard to make my next project better.<br><br>Writing for the PPC should not be a chore. It should feel like a school assignment. We write to sharpen our skills. We write because it&#39;s fun. We write because we have ideas and stories that we want to present to the wider world.<br><br>We do <i>not</i> write (or at least, we should not write -- I&#39;ve harped on that point quite a few times, but people either don&#39;t listen or don&#39;t remember) for catharsis, or for some twisted form of internet justice. Writing through anger is not a good way to approach a story. You shouldn&#39;t be walking away from a story going &quot;That&#39;s so stupid, MAIM KILL DESTROY BURN.&quot; You should ideally be saying something like &quot;That&#39;s so stupid, it might actually be entertaining if I do this and this and this.&quot;<br><br>Finally, I just want to advise you to try moderating your tone in the future. Calling the veterans &quot;killjoys,&quot; referring to anything not mission-related as &quot;tedious&quot; and &quot;pointless,&quot; and telling Huinesoron that he was &quot;wasting readers&#39; time&quot; strike me as being borderline insulting. If that was not your intention, then I apologize for jumping to conclusions.<br><br>PC</p>

It&#39;s so depressing to see the corpse being laid out one word at a time. How do you guys cope with that?</i><br><br>This reminds me to some extent of J.R.R. Tolkien, who worked on <i>The Silmarillion</i> from 1917 until his death in the &#39;70s, and never got it to a point where he was satisfied. He kept rewriting, reworking, and generally meddling with it. The only reason <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> was published was because his publishers dropped a deadline on his head (and actually made one stick!).<br><br>I know what you mean about living ideas, and actually, it&#39;s one reason I like playing in the PPC ball-pond. Because the world is so <i>huge</i>, virtually every story you write is a vignette. It doesn&#39;t murder an idea, pin a character to the page - it just snapshots a moment, or a day, in their life. Then, next time you find a moment you&#39;d like to pin down - or, if you prefer an alternate metaphor, a memory from their life that you&#39;d like to catch on film - you write another one.<br><br>A lot of my more recent stories have consisted of this: taking snapshots of what the characters are doing, not filling in the gaps. Example: <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/OriginsTitle.htm">Origins</a> is nine scenes spanning several decades. Perhaps an even better example: <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndTitle.htm">The End of the Beginning</a> is what happens to my agents - and their children - in the next <i>thirty years</i>. The &#39;pins&#39; I&#39;ve stuck into Dafydd (to take a random example) consist of 1) leaves PPC, 2) has kids, 3) ... runs away into the multiverse with his wife.<br><br>Since the last Dafydd entry in <i>EotB</i>, I&#39;ve brought him back to HQ twice (most recently <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255874;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">for a party</a>), have him dropping in on an upcoming mission, and even have him forming a trans-dimensional organisation of his own. In no way is his story murdered - it just keeps on growing. And because I&#39;ve written the core of it - because I know <i>who</i> he is, and what experiences he&#39;s had (like, say, accidentally killing himself with a magic ring in the middle of the worst badfic around... that was kind of formative) - those past and future tales can be better shaped to fit him.<br><br>And I think that&#39;s kind of my view. By writing their stories down, I&#39;m not <i>killing</i> my characters - I&#39;m letting them grow. Unwritten characters are just ribbons of potentiality waving in the breeze - hard to grasp, and however pretty they are, they&#39;re never going to be anything other than ribbons. But pin one end down, and you can weave a braid - or a celtic knot - or a rope - or add wire and make a sculpture - or repaint it in different colours - or even, if you choose, cut it up.<br><br>And characters are the same way. Once you start setting their experiences in stone, they act like real people - they adapt to fit their circumstances, they change as a result of what&#39;s happened to them. They can have all the adventures you can think of if they stay in your head - but until you start fixing things in, they can never <i>grow</i>.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>And yes, that applies to plots, too. Imagine you&#39;ve got this character in your head, we&#39;ll call him Luke Skywalker. He lives on a desert planet with his aunt and uncle. One day you imagine him racing his skyhopper down Beggar&#39;s Canyon, another you picture him at Toschi Station with his friend Biggs. He can have all the adventures you can dream of on Tatooine.<br><br>But until you sit down and say, for certain, that he&#39;s followed his new droid to Ben Kenobi&#39;s hut, seen his guardians killed, and fled the planet with a smuggler and a wookie... he&#39;s never going to become a Jedi. And frankly, I&#39;ll take <i>Star Wars</i> over the unlimited adventures of Luke in the desert any day.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You&#39;re not doing a very good job selling it.  The idea of twisting and arranging a freshly-killed corpse into a braid or a celtic knot is a bit too macabre (even for someone who claims to be a &quot;Ghost&quot; in the screen name!)<br><br>And as for the Star Wars thing, presumably the attack on the Death Star is the main focus of the story idea, and what changes is the plot leading up to that: who&#39;s attacking it, and why.  Like I said, story ideas don&#39;t necessarily start at the beginning.  And once the Luke version got written down, all the possible alternate versions died, or were consigned to the living death of AU.<br><br>OTOH if there <i>is </i>any advantage to actually writing it&#39;s the chance to make sure your ideas die with dignity.<br><br>(Long, rambling, and slightly incoherent explanation/example coming up.  You have been warned.)<br><br>My recent brainstorming session with Dark Brother has given me a brilliant idea for a scene with a couple of PPC agents in a Doctor Who fic.  I&#39;d love to share it, and because it&#39;s just a short scene, not big enough to twist and turn in my mind, I should be able to write it up easily enough.<br><br>This idea relies on the agents being in a fourth-wall-breaking Doctor Who fic with a borderline redeemable Sue.  So I&#39;ll have to invent a parody Sue for the scene, of course.  That shouldn&#39;t be too hard.  After all, like you said, they do have their generic aspects.  And it&#39;s not as though there&#39;s going to be a perfectly suitable fic in the Unclaimed Badfic list, is there?<br><br>Except, I went to check the list anyway, just out of curiosity, and found: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5757949/1/Every_Fangirls_Dream">this.</a><br><br><b>CURSE YOU IRONIC OVERPOWER!!!</b><br><br>My scene idea has now attached itself to that, re-written itself to match that particular TARDIS crew.  So now if someone else PPCs that fic, my idea will die anyway by not being included in it; a slow, painful death from neglect.<br><br>I really, really want to write that mission just so that the scene gets to die a quick, dignified death in my mind, and a decent funeral and wake afterwards.  Then the will can be read and the inheritance passed on to that idea&#39;s heirs.<br><br>(A funeral and will is definitely a better analogy than your idea of tying origami knots in the deceased!)<br><br>The question is, will I be able to do it, or am I too much of a coward to actually kill the idea myself?<br></p>

            <p>Huinesoron wasn&#39;t talking about making objects out of dead bodies. He was comparing potential characters to ribbons, and those ribbons were what was being shaped into different forms, each form being representative of a similar base idea that was exposed to its stories and developed differently because of a character&#39;s experiences. Your metaphor was the one about the process of writing stories being comparable to dragging something up from the depths and slaughtering it. Both metaphors were viewing the same topic from different angles. No one is saying that those ribbons need to be made from dead bodies. That would be gross, and would make for very impractical ribbons.<br><br>I understand where you&#39;re coming from, though, in a way, since I used to have a similar view myself. Everything was just so much more dynamic in my head, and if I didn&#39;t like something, I could go back and change it. No one flubbed their lines, the action was always just as well-paced as it needed to be, and I could always get to the good character moments and fun climaxes without having to get through any of that morass in the middle. The problem, though, is that if I didn&#39;t write it down, it all went away. No matter how great an idea was, or could have been with a little more effort, it eventually vanished, leaving only a vague sense of frustration as I stumble on a box of fragments months later. I didn&#39;t want to trap anything on the screen, where it couldn&#39;t fill any and all available space the way it used to and keep itself constantly growing and changing, but I didn&#39;t want to lose crucial portions of what I&#39;ve invested so much thought in, either.<br>Even if I only save little pieces, there are still spores left of what was. If there&#39;s no record of an idea because I&#39;m afraid of what will happen to it, I&#39;d never be able to see what it could become under adversity, I&#39;d never be able to look at it months later and say &quot;Well, this is stupid. Why did I think this was worth anything? Wait, no, it can still work! Maybe if I do <i>this</i>...&quot;, or my personal favorite, fitting ideas into one another and building a world out of scraps and possibilities. Sometimes, an idea won&#39;t work, maybe because of something I hadn&#39;t considered, maybe because of character inconsistency, or maybe because I hadn&#39;t set it to anything quickly enough and someone else has done something, however unintentional, that renders it unusable, but if I know what it is and where it is, I can always come back to it, rearrange a few pieces, and send it skittering out into the world.<br><br><br><br>So, yeah, that long ramble happened. Sorry. Once it started, I didn&#39;t want to cut it off until it went on for a certain amount of time. Basically, though, even though you want to see your thoughts grow as much as they can, they won&#39;t be able to if they aren&#39;t used for anything. Even if they burn out in the end or they need to be taken apart, it&#39;s far better that they have a chance at becoming something more than remaining unrealized forever. If you&#39;ve got three stories for Luke and only one leads to him becoming what the story that&#39;s being set up needs him to become, who says that all three have to be Luke? Who says that they have to all even live in the same location, or take up the same destiny? Maybe you could get three characters for the price of one, and then all three of them could start prompting stories of their own, and impressing, or influencing, or inspiring yourself or others to start making new stories based on the old ones. Maybe Jedi destiny Luke could meet up with speeder-adventure Luke that you decided early to merge with another character you had good feelings about but only ever came up with a name and backstory for, and speeder-Luke takes Jedi Luke to his desert oasis castle that you thought up one night and needed to use for something and figured &quot;hey, used-to-be-Luke needs an awesome place to stay&quot;. Even if everything gets put together out of order, or you need to rework something important about the castle so that it won&#39;t all fall apart when speeder-Luke inevitably overshoots the landing and crashes into the portcullis, it&#39;s better that you get to see your stories grow than to let them fade away.<br><br>Ugh this is turning into a subjective ramble again I did not have this in mind when I started out I only wanted to point out a misinterpretation and maybe share a bit of personal experience I&#39;m going to stop now</p>

            <p>My mind&#39;s mental vision of a written story is so strongly a dead corpse, that even when he says it&#39;s a ribbon, I&#39;m not really convinced.  I&#39;m still seeing a corpse instead.<br><br>Interesting comments about going back over old ideas months later.  It&#39;s pretty much the exact opposite of the rules the teachers forced us to use when writing fiction in English lessons in school. (Write a story with one of these opening sentences.  It must be at least so many words.  You must complete your first draft in full before going back and changing or editing anything.  Your story must be finished and handed in by end of class.)<br><br>Of course, that was years ago, so maybe the rules for writing have changed since then, and you can be more flexible nowadays.  If so, I wish I&#39;d known sooner!<br></p>

I can describe canon characters fine, because I have someone else&#39;s description(s) to imitate.  But my own characters, PPC or not?  I really only have a vague idea what they look like, because to my (slightly sociopathic) mind, a person is a set of actions and words, not a physical form.<br><br>Anyway, what I really wanted to say was, when you do get permission, don&#39;t feel obligated to world-build any PPC stuff before and after the mission.  If you want to focus on the action, that&#39;s fine.

            <p>I still don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve matured since the age of twelve or so. I suffer from Peter Pan Syndrome- I don&#39;t want to grow up. (^_^)/ I do like to think I can make better choices than most kids my age, but if someone cracks a fart joke, I&#39;ll start snorting like a pig. If I see a tree, I want to climb it. If I see a shiny object on the ground, I run over to see what it is. ADD for the win.<br><br>School just sucks all around. You never get to learn what you want to learn and you have to put up with idiots who don&#39;t know what a preposition is. (I&#39;m not kidding- at the beginning of the year, my Latin teacher had to give the class a crash course in basic English grammar. It was scary.)</p>

            <p>Yeah, that FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS thing sounds familiar.  (And the opposite, when you really don&#39;t want to focus to something so you let yourself get distracted by <b>everything </b>around you, so so still don&#39;t end up really noticing anything.)<br><br>Thanks for your words of encouragement.

He showed the results to Hild, who pulled out her own Canon Analysis Device and pointed it at the Doctor.<br><br>[The Tenth Doctor – or maybe the Eleventh depending on whether you include the War Doctor, and don&#39;t even get me started on those faces from &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot;...]<br><br>Hild hit the CAD firmly on the side.  <i>Doctor Who</i>&#39;s flexible canon meant that CADs sometimes had trouble focussing.  Those agents who worked permanently in the <i>Doctor Who </i>Division were usually issued with special models that were shielded against such effects.  Being a general assistance assassin, not assigned to any particular division, Hild didn&#39;t have that advantage, but fortunately, a good thump could often achieve the same result.<br><br>[The Doctor, Canon character, Timelord, Male, 15.5% OOC]<br><br>[Donna Noble, Canon character, Human, Female,  10.2% OOC]<br><br>&quot;Not too bad, yet,&quot; said Sean when she showed it to him.  &quot;So far it&#39;s mostly just fallout from crossing into the wrong universe.&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, Abby had stepped out from behind the tree, and introduced herself to the Doctor.<br><br><i><b>&quot;I&#39;m your number one fan!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fan?&quot; Donna asked. &quot;Of him?&quot; She gestured to the Doctor.<br><br>Abby nodded. &quot;Also president of the fan club.&quot;</b></i><br><br>&quot;Of course, she <i>would </i>be the president,&quot; sighed Hild shaking her head.  &quot;Typical Sue.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wonder how many adult fans like having this girl as president of their club?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe we&#39;re being too harsh.  The so-called club&#39;s probably just her and her friends.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; snarled Sean, &quot;imaginary friends at that.&quot;<br><br>----<br><br>What do you think?

            <p>Thanks.  The CAD thing pretty much wrote itself.  We&#39;ve normally seen them either working perfectly or blowing up, and it was time for something between those two extremes.  (You know, like the way most technology sort-of works most of the time, even if it isn&#39;t exactly in the way you want it to work!)<br><br>Hild is the old Anglo-Saxon form of the name because she&#39;s part-Rohirrim.  (Is it &quot;part-Rohirrim&quot; or &quot;part-Rohirric&quot; or even &quot;part Rohir&quot;?)  Anyway, she&#39;s a semi-fic blip that&#39;s been going round my head for years, so I know her quite well.<br><br>OTOH Sean is specially created for the mission.  (I wanted to call him John.  He preferred Sid.  I thought &quot;said Sid&quot; looked silly in text, so we agreed on Sean as a compromise.)<br></p>

            <p>At the risk of sounding supremely egotistical, do you ever wonder if authors (and film-makers and game developers, etc.) have &quot;better&quot; (more active) imaginations?  Or do other folks get story ideas too, but have no interest in making them?</p>

            <p>But in reverse order.<br><br>Writing MST3K fanfic is <i>not</i> the same as writing MSTs. MSTing is a concept - the concept of taking a story or watching a film and making comments throughout. MST3K is a very entertaining TV show. But you don&#39;t have to write MST3K to write MSTs. It would be like... uh... insisting that every sonnet have to be about comparing someone to a summer&#39;s day? I dunno, something like that. MSTing is a style of writing, and like I say, you can write it with characters, host-segment-equivalents, etc - or you can literally write your comments interlinearly, in your own voice.<br><br>Still, I take your point about not getting to kill anything. ;) So, is it possible to write a story with no description and no plot?<br><br>(I&#39;m actually going to address your &#39;how do you guys cope?&#39; opening in a second reply; it seems like it deserves its own sub-thread)<br><br>A story with just one character speaking, taken literally, is probably a stream-of-consciousness sort of thing; they tend to get a bit strange. But let&#39;s be a little looser. Some suggestions:<br><br>-Write in first person, and give your &#39;narrator&#39; character free rein. If you imagine it&#39;s literally your character telling you about the events - getting sidetracked, forgetting details, refusing to talk about the tough bits - you&#39;ve actually turned a story <i>into</i> a one-sided dialogue. You can even have a silent second speaker, leading to things like this:<br><br><i>We ducked behind the barn because, well, would </i>you<i> stay in plain sight when there&#39;s a multi-hued dragon on the rampage? I turned to Amelia and demanded, &quot;Could you maybe </i>think<i> next time?<br><br>No, Sally wasn&#39;t there. Didn&#39;t I say? Oh, right. Yeah, she ducked into the tower off to our right. Came out a few hours later with a-- but I&#39;m getting ahead of myself.</i><br><br>That might well fit for you - your <i>narrator</i> would be &#39;jumping about from the end to the beginning&#39;. If you muck about with it a bit, you might even find a way to stop the story having to be consistent. Maybe your character hops timelines at random - or maybe they&#39;re just a liar. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yes there is, although it isn&#39;t between platforms four and five it&#39;s right next to the shop (the nearest two platforms to it are 11 and 0 I believe).

            <p>My favorite character? Hmm... I say Snape, because he is pretty complex. (The movies do nobody justice.)<br><br>I personally think I would have done well in Slytherin. Why? Because I have more of their personality traits than I have anyone else, I think.<br><br>I&#39;m a Muggle Born. Because they are awesome. <br><br>My favorite moment... is when Harry and Dumbledore fight off the Inferi while they are going for the fake locket in that cave.<br><br>My favorite book is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Why? Well, it establishes some finality to almost everything. You see people you came to root for get offed in heroic ways (Fred and Dobby). Also, it gets me thinking about what the Weasley and Potter kids get up to at Hogwarts.<br><br>My favorite villain is Antonin Dolohov. Why? Well, because every time he appears, he is being used as a hitman. And he is good at his hob. He led the attack on the Prewitt brothers, he beat Mad Eye Moody in a fight, he almost killed Hermione, the book never says that he tries to run from Dumbledore when he shows up, he attacks Harry, Ron and Hermione again- He&#39;s just crazy!<br><br>It&#39;s a toss up between Percy and George for me. Percy is the classic example of both the annoying, snobby older brother who thinks he knows better than his parents. I grew to really hate him, which made his eventual redemption (and his cracking a joke) all that much more satisfying. George, on the other hand, is different. He is Fred&#39;s younger twin, and I can personally identify with that, because I am a younger twin. He has to live up to his brother, who as far as I can tell, is the one who concocts all the master plans. He just seems like the one who hangs on the coat tails, and that to me makes him more realistic and likeable.</p>

            <p>Ooo, jellybeans! *takes a handful, munches* Mmmm, peppermint! I like Hermione. She&#39;s smart, she&#39;s gutsy, and she has the greatest reactions to the crazy shenanigans around her.

Those two are spectacular; probably my second-favorite characters after the Trio.<br><br>Favorite villain...well, I&#39;m currently re-reading Order of the Phoenix, so I&#39;d have to say Umbridge.

            <p>Fred and George&#39;s escape was definitely a Crowning Moment of Awesome. And their fireworks show. And their swamp. And the shop. And... actually, pretty much everything they do.

            <p>I hear that. Snape was on the side of the angels, but he certainly wasn&#39;t one of them.<br><br>A lot of people on the fandom side of social media (Tumblr, Facebook, etc.) seem to be going back on their forgiveness to Snape. I mean at first (especially after the movie) there was all kinds of sympathy for him, but now people are insulting him again for how he treated Harry.<br><br>Yeah, Snape was unquestionably a jerk to poor Harry, but losing the love of your life to your greatest enemy is going to harden your heart.

            <p>Hi, guys. I&#39;ve been looking around the wiki for a while, after being led to the original series via Tvtropes. One thing led to another, and soon enough, I decided I&#39;d like to be involved. For now, I&#39;ll just hover about on the Board, but I might make a permission request in the future.<br><br>I&#39;m a huge fan of the original PPC series. I also love Pokémon (just the games), LotR, HP, LoZ, and Fullmetal Alchemist. I&#39;d be happy to meet up with other fans!<br><br>Also, I have one concern. I was worried at first that you guys might be dead, seeing as there weren&#39;t many late-April missions. Obviously, you&#39;re alive, but I still have a question: How long does it usually take for a mission to be written once someone says they&#39;re going to write one? Just curious.</p>

            <p>Hello, fellow Nintendo fan! Have an Ice Rod! Wait, LoZ does stand for Legend of Zelda, right? If not, I&#39;m sure I can find something else to provide a more fitting welcome present.<br><br>New stories don&#39;t come out all that frequently, actually. I don&#39;t know the exact numbers, but I&#39;d estimate the average to be... once a month someone publishes new ones, when considering missions, interludes, and miscellanea all at once? That&#39;s probably wrong. Heck, this past month it happened twice from one person, who made four stories in total, so that alone is probably throwing the numbers off. </p>

            <p>Hi, have some fudge!<br><br>I&#39;ve got a mission in beta right now, but things have been going slow.  My work location moved down the strip mall, and it&#39;s harder to pick up a wifi signal, so I have to go to a coffee shop if I want to update anything on my Google Drive account.  (I&#39;ve dropped a couple hints to family about my upcoming birthday and a wifi antenna, but it&#39;s too early for any results.)</p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>I like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter as well. I&#39;m a bigger fan of Harry Potter than I am of Lord of the Rings, though. It&#39;s been a while since I have done any Lord of the Rings stuff.<br><br>Well, I&#39;m new here too, so I can&#39;t write missions yet, but I would think that it all depends on the writer how long it takes, because once you get permission, you do not have to go through the process every time you make a new one.

            <p>Were you looking for badfic that involved dragons, possibly from the How to Train Your Dragon fandom? I ran across one the other day, that I&#39;ll be honest and say I didn&#39;t read, because the summary was so bad. But it definitely involved dragons. I won&#39;t post a link unless someone says they want it, as it was rated NC-17, I think. Maybe just M. I&#39;m not sure if that is the sort of fic you&#39;d even be interested in at all. I just saw &#39;Gah! gouge my eyes out with a spork and pour in brain bleach!&#39; summary and thought you might be looking for dragon based fics to kill.</p>

            <p>In the badfic, I was fairly sure it&#39;s character possession, but it&#39;s looking more like all out replacement. The only thing is, I&#39;m not entirely certain. Is it just a judgement call?<br><br>I&#39;m about halfway through the mission, but I need to know in case I need to go back and have Rina and Randa rescue the canon Harry.</p>

            <p>I had one mission where I was just certain that that Holmes and Watson had been replaced. I was writing it that way and the agents were speaking that way. Then as I went through the story, I realized that there were times when un-Sue-like things happened to the characters. A lot of Sue type things, too, but some things that Sue would not normally tolerate at all. I changed the way it ended to say that the characters were suffering character rupture instead of being replacements. <br><br>The mission could have been legitimately written with them as replacements (I think I ended up saying they were 94 point something and 99.99% OOC).  It was purely a judgment call.<br><br>Which way makes for a more interesting story? Will your agents have to make a turn around? There was a character in my story who was rather disappointed he didn&#39;t get to kill them.  It did take a bit longer to have the agents change direction. It sounds like it would take longer for your agents as well, since they&#39;d then have to go find the canon character. <br><br>Taking a bit longer can be good or bad. My story ended up being over the post limit on LJ and had to be broken up into two sections. Some people do not like to read long missions. (Personally I enjoy long stories--missions and fanfics--so I tend to find that concept a bit foreign, but I understand that some people read slower than I do or just have more things pressing on their time), so that would be bad. It could give you space to come up with something really interesting or some nice characterization, though, so that would be good.<br><br>Maybe look for places that the Harry in the badfic <i>doesn&#39;t</i> act like a Stu, and see if those are significant enough to you, to justify in your mind that he is not a replacement. You might have to use alternatives to a CAD though, if they are going to be in the 85%+ OOC range. They tend to explode above that. OK, I&#39;ll quit rambling at you now. Good luck on your mission!</p>

            <p>I would say it&#39;s still a Possession and not a full on Replacement just yet.<br><br>Halfway through the mission??? I personally don&#39;t think the stories ready to be sporked just quite yet, I would say hold back and wait a little while, at least until this third person in the bond is revealed, for all we know it could be a Mary Sue pretending to be Voldemort&#39;s daughter. <br>If it does turn into a Replacement you can always search for the canon Harry at the end.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Role-play time! This is open to anyone regardless of their permission status, so bring your agents or hopefully future agents and get ready to RP!<br><br>This is based off something SeaTurtle said in my &#39;You are a Sue&#39; thread; what would the agents of the PPC do if they met their Sue or Stu counterparts? &quot;And there you have it. A perfect RP subject: agents meeting their Suvian counterparts during some strange wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey event.&quot;<br><br><b>Da Rules</b><br>1) Write your posts in third person past tense to keep things simple.<br><br>2) You can only control your agents unless someone else says it&#39;s okay for you to use theirs.<br><br>3) None of this is canon unless you and anyone your character(s) interact with want it to be, so have fun! <br><br>4) Since this involves Sue/Stu counterparts, don&#39;t forget to include them! The counterparts can be the same sex or the opposite sex, or if you really want to go wild, why not include both?<br><br>5) To show you (the Boarder) speaking separately, use some way to distinguish that fact. It looks like ((double parentheses)) is a fairly common way to do that, but as long as you&#39;re clear on who&#39;s speaking, it doesn&#39;t matter.<br><br>6) Try to keep the RP in a continuous line of posts to make the chronology easy to follow.<br><br>I&#39;ll kick things off below, so get ready- we&#39;ve got some Sues to kill.</p>

            <p>...as the one seen earlier had just been shoved through a portal.  As &quot;anyone who knew xir intimately&quot; (that is, xir, xirself, and xe) would tell you, xe was looking for a name which would fit, and hence picking a new ambiguously gendered name at random from behindthename.com daily.  Today xe was going by Quinn, as stated by a small label on the inside (directly opposite xir water-lily flash patch) which served as a reminder, but xe most certainly wouldn&#39;t have snapped at someone for not realizing that xe had a name!  If anything, xe&#39;d have been impressed with Rina&#39;s knowledge of pronouns both uncommonly used and nonstandard.<br><br>From a few feet away, however, and in a shadow, the OTHER pair could have been mistaken for xir.  <i>She,</i> nevertheless, was very different- of course in personality, but also in appearance.  Dark yellow had become glittering gold, comfy cotton ostentatious lace, precise green polka-dots poorly-rendered urple and blello hibiscuses, a rather modest cut a bikini. She&#39;d be ideal underwear for a Sue, although redundant, if her rather large ego could abide such a situation.<br><br>She did share the waterlily flash patch with her counterpart, although it was gilded, wilver, and urple.  Hopefully that would be sufficient for the next stage- it wasn&#39;t often that one got this sort of opportunity for infiltration, after all.<br><br>She waited, thinking- what sort of name would avoid suspicion?<br>.......................................................................................................................<br>Meanwhile, two boys gestured frantically, if near-indetectably.  Ending with gestures along the lines of &quot;tell the truth again?&quot;  &quot;yes no better option&quot; &quot;yes you then&quot;, they straightened up and the one closer to the door spoke.<br><br>&quot;We are trainees.  We have no rank.  We are sorry.  We lack further proof-&quot; but then the other touched a finger to his palm, silencing his &quot;twin&quot;.  He&#39;d thought of something.<br><br>&quot;Bleeprin.  It makes you feel better about bad Sue ish structure.  Would a Sue know this?&quot;<br><br>If not before, a certain Sue now knew.  Her counterpart, however, was pretty distracted from getting back due to xir ire over not only constantly being dumped in the laundry (although xe didn&#39;t mind it happening occasionally; being laundered for her was like a nice long bath for a human) but having it happen NOW of all times.  In a normal locale, such distraction would have delayed xir substantially; this was HQ.  She was back in less than twenty seconds, and, in the hope that politeness would be returned in kind, knocked yet again.<br><br><i>Fup. Fup. FUP.</i><br> ((Briefs, thank you for asking.  Cotton (t-shirt type fabric.)))</p>

            <p>&quot;No need for more proof; Bleeprin is definitely a PPC-only substance. Welcome to the club, guys. What are your names, by the way?&quot;<br><br>Before either of the twins could answer, the Spy caught a glimpse of something shiny out of the corner of his eye. It was somewhere to his left, in the shadow of the equipment cabinet that stood beside the door. <i>There should be nothing behind the cabinet</i>, thought Gaspard. <i>It&#39;s an empty corner. Merde! Suvian!</i> The Spy waved to his colleague and pointed to the corner. Yakov&#39;s eyes flicked to the suspicious spot. The wizard nodded and adjusted the grip on his wand. Making a &quot;hang on a second&quot; gesture to the rest of the agents, Gaspard pointed his Webley at the corner and very carefully started to walk around the cabinet, not wanting to get any closer to it lest the Suvian thing decided to break cover. <br><br>He spotted the floating gilded undergarments and fired. Against all the laws of kinematics, the underwear wasn&#39;t pierced when the .455 bullet hit it: who had ever heard of Suvian clothing damage anyways? Instead, the bikini bottom was nailed to the wall, the bullet preventing it from escaping. Yakov and Gaspard-- both standing a safe distance away from the thing and pointing their weapons at it-- exchanged a confused look. <br><br>Just then, the pair of underwear known as &quot;Quinn&quot; floated back into the room, let in by one of the twins. Looking from Quinn to the feebly struggling bikini, Gaspard said: &quot;I don&#39;t get paid enough for this insanity.&quot;<br></p>

            <p>((Clarifying a few things.  Thing One, I&#39;m very new.  Please let me know if I mess something up.<br><br>Thing Two, although hopefully you&#39;ll pick this info up from the posts, Stephanie is a former Sue who ended up being pulled from her story into my mind when I lost interest in the former; eventually, she started to evolve into a more balanced character.  She travels through time and space supposedly randomly (she typically ends up somewhere/when convenient for the plot, but absolutely cannot control it) if she says something on the hour to within 1 second.  I do not have permission, but will probably request it in June, and am likely to attempt to use her.))<br><br><i>Thump.</i><br>Stephanie, who had been rereading the <i>Harry Potter</i> series to ensure that she would be familiar with the canon, scooted a little closer to her desk.  She didn&#39;t even have a mini- so what could have made that noise?  As she considered copying her author and scooting underneath, she caught a glimpse of her watch.  <i>Twenty seconds past ten o&#39;clock.</i>  It should have beeped on the hour; the fact that that hadn&#39;t occurred more likely than not meant that a Narrative Law had been invoked.  Comedy, Irony, and... Something that didn&#39;t come up a lot.   Irony probably would have been the console beeping, as she hadn&#39;t acted in such a manner as to tempt the Ironic Overpower... Or so she thought, anyway.  Comedy... Who knew?  Maybe the thump was perfectly innocuous, and her reaction was supposed to be funny.  Heartened by the thought, the girl swiveled around before she lost her nerve-<br><br>And almost screamed as she came face to face with a girl whom she thought that she&#39;d left behind years before.  The girl&#39;s hair was blonde to Stephanie&#39;s dyed black-brown, her eyes were such an intense, deep shade of the color blue that it almost became a Hoovaloo while (due to Logicillin) Stephanie&#39;s were graying, her figure was that of a Barbie to Stephanie&#39;s boyish frame, her skin shimmered peach to Stephanie&#39;s unhealthy pallor,, and she wore an elaborate dress of wilver and urple.<br><br>&quot;I am Stephaniella Annibell Rosa Nuitcommevelour. Join me?&quot;<br><br>Stephanie could almost feel her GL rising due to being in the same room with her counterpart- but then her gaze fell on the Harry Potter book, and suddenly she remembered- she was going to be a part of something bigger, going to rescue characters from bad chacterization... <br><br>&quot;no.  NO.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can control it, you know.&quot;  Stephaniella leaned in.  &quot;I can rescue our parents.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They&#39;d never be the same.  They were just bits.  I don&#39;t mean- I love them.  But it wouldn&#39;t be them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I could make you think that they were.  We could be happy, Stephanie.  Twins.  Pick a name.  I can force our author to write our story...&quot;<br><br>Stephanie was in tears by this point- not of the Single variety, but sobbing that reddened her eyes and made her feel sick.  She swung at her counterpart, who flicked out for a second and then reappeared in the same spot as before.<br><br>&quot;You just don&#39;t understand, do you?  I&#39;ve discussed it with her.  She more or less offered.  THEY WOULDN&#39;T BE THE SAME PEOPLE!!!11!1!&quot;  She willed the punctuation downpour, should one form, to hit her counterpart.  &quot;You are disrespecting their memory.  STOP!&quot;<br><br>Barely caring- it wasn&#39;t as though her counterpart would be stopped by a locked door anyway, if her powers could be used anytime- Stephanie rushed out of RC 593, grabbing her RA on the off chance that it could have proved useful to the Sue, and- steeling herself, a bit afraid to be so loud after so long barely speaking- yelled, &quot;HELP!  SUE!&quot;</p>

            <p>...and almost empty. Taking up the left side of the long room was a shooting range and on the other wall was a filthy kitchen.

            <p>Through the portal came... himself. But taller. With animu eyes. And grey hair. Wearing fancy armour. Brandishing a very large sword. Come to think of it, he looked very Bishonen.

            <p>Rina cursed herself for leaving her crowbar in her RC.

            <p>&quot;Well, that was a waste of two hours,&quot; Lonny muttered, walking back to his RC with an angry trudge. &quot;Of <i>course</i> it was right under the radiator. That was the same room we started looking for it in, after all, and you <i>always</i> find things right where you started off. Except when you <i>don&#39;t</i>. If narrative convention was a person, I&#39;d tell  them to be a little more consistent with all this crap.&quot;<br><br>His mood brightened up when he noticed a distinctive form  just a little further down the hall, covered in a black shell and with prominent white eyes. Not only another carapacians, but another Dersite! The other being seemed to be carrying an unnecessary number of weapons, namely a pair of crossed battle-axes mounted on its back, but Lonny ascribed that to being from another department. He knew how some Assassins could get about weaponry, and he expected that there were Disentanglers and Sue-centric Floaters that felt the same. Well, there was one way to find out the details: conversation!<br><br>&quot;Hey! Hello!&quot; Lonny said cheerfully, walking up to the other Dersite and turning to make eye contact. &quot;Wow, I thought I was  only Dersite in HQ, and here you are! Neither of us is alone now, and that&#39;s great! We can share experiences, have common cultural reference points, and all those other things people like! What did you do back on the homeworld?&quot; <br><br>The other turned around in response to the voice, and Lonny was briefly taken aback. The being in front of him wasn&#39;t just another Dersite; it matched Lonny&#39;s appearance in almost every respect. Without the over-the-top weaponry, the only major difference he could see were the other&#39;s eyes, sparkling with tiny motes of red glitter and glaring with blind malice and judgement. Lonny had dealt with Suvian character replacements before, but had never expected to see one of himself.<br><br>&quot;Out of my way, dweeb,&quot; the other Lonny snapped, reaching for one of the weapons strapped to his back. &quot;You&#39;ve got some nerve getting in front of <i>me</i>. Back of the freakin&#39; line, or I&#39;ll show you what color your guts are.&quot;<br><br>Under normal circumstances, Lonny would have asked what line, made a snarky comment about what the other was waiting for out in the middle of the hallway, or something else of the sort. But back in his home fansession, he&#39;d encountered a fair share of alternate versions of himself, recognized early on how dangerous they could get, and had developed an ironclad strategy for dealing with them.<br><br>Lunging forward, Lonny drove his foot into a spot directly between the chest and abdomen of the double, who fell down, his wind knocked out.<br>All right, so it wasn&#39;t an ironclad plan so much as knowing his own weaknesses, but Lonny wasn&#39;t complaining. He took advantage of the lapse to grab one of the battle-axes off of the double&#39;s back, planning to knock the aggressor out with its handle. However, as soon as it separated from its holder, the axe quickly dropped to the ground, and Lonny grunted in surprise from the sudden increase in weight. Instants later, the other Dersite rose with a light chuckle, recovering his wind far faster than he should have.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m as weak as you are just because I look like you, dingus,&quot; the double snapped with a patronizing sneer. Effortlessly, the other Lonny picked up the axe from the ground, wrenched it out of the PPC Agent&#39;s hands, and pointed it at him menacingly. &quot;Advantage lost.&quot;<br><br>He then bent over again, stunned from another hard blow to the sternum enhanced from Lonny&#39;s convenient position underneath him. The PPC Agent took advantage of the momentary lapse to scramble to his feet.<br><br>&quot;Bad angle, ha ha, better luck next time, I&#39;ve learned I&#39;ve gotta scram bye!&quot; Lonny said, his words emerging so quickly that they almost blurred together. Without wasting another second, Lonny bolted down the hall, partially hating himself for being bested so easily.<br><br>Lonny had to admit, the <i>first</i> part of his strategy hadn&#39;t been all that effective. But the backup second part, &quot;find someone who knows what they&#39;re doing, tended to fare much better.<br><br>-----<br><br>Back at the RC, Copernicus straightened his sash, glancing at the vision of himself reflected off of the inactive television. He pulled at the top, letting it slide more evenly off of his shoulder gears. Even though he was only headed out to get supplies, he needed to make sure his flash patch was secure and prominent. He wouldn&#39;t want to be mistaken for an intruder or a lost DoSAT experiment again, after all. Once was enough.<br><br>Waving goodbye to the RC 52080 minis, he pulled open the door, only to find himself face-to-face with another being, approximately his size and body shape, but obviously fully robotic in nature. It also had a wider stance, darker coloration, two glowing red eyes, and most prominently, two massive cannons prodtruding from its shoulders. Upon seeing him, the machine tried to push past him multiple times, but each attempt was blocked by Copernicus&#39;s unyielding bulk. It settled for leaning in to peer over the golem&#39;s shoulder at the RC&#39;s interior.<br><br>&quot;Woah, this is a sick-rippin&#39; pad you&#39;ve got here, my home-brother!&quot; it exclaimed, its words tinged with an unplaceable accent.<br><br>&quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Seems like a most radical place for <i>this</i> bro to hang his hooks and keep tight, you know what I&#39;m saying?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. No, I do not.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aw, man, don&#39;t be a stickler. You&#39;ve got to admit this place is mondo suited to my grand vibes! I <i>deserve</i> to call your zone here my spot to crash!&quot; <br><br>&quot;Nothing that you&#39;re saying is in any way resemblant of actual language, and what little I understand I interpret as confrontational. I am going to close and lock the door now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What? You&#39;ve got no spot calling those shots, bud, and I say that in full-&quot;<br><br>Copernicus pulled the door down, cutting off the intruder&#39;s words with a powerful clang, and immediately strode over to Anersin the mini-Colossus&#39; charging station and pulled a switch concealed behind it. The door made a low whirring sound as the seal engaged, and Copernicus noted with satisfaction the groans and muffled complaints that issued from the other side.<br><br>-----<br><br>Out of breath, Lonny rounded the last corner to his RC before drastically decreasing his speed. He clutched a hand to his chest and bent down, coughing slightly. Whatever his class of carapacian was supposed to do back on Derse evidently had not included running with any degree of speed for any notable distance. That or he was out of shape, which was a possibility that he dismissed immediately.<br><br>&quot;All right,&quot; he panted, slowly regathering  his strength. &quot;I&#39;ve got my evil double running around here. What makes a double? Maybe it... hoo... maybe it escaped from an alternate universe. Maybe it&#39;s from... the future. Maybe from a magic mirror. Like, it sucked out my jerkness or something. I&#39;d remember that last one if it happened, but maybe I was asleep.&quot; He coughed again. &quot;No, those are dumb. I&#39;m dumb when I&#39;m tired. But Nick will know. He&#39;s good with this stuff. Just another few doors and I&#39;ll be back to ask him.&quot;<br><br>Shaking his head, Lonny glanced up, hoping to see the familiar door of his RC a short distance away. He did, but unfortunately, he also saw an eight-foot brownish-yellow machine blasting away at said door with a pair of massive shoulder cannons.<br><br>&quot;Yo, I&#39;m only gonna say this once, brah!&quot; it howled, projecting its words over its cannons&#39; dull and repeated booms. &quot;I&#39;m gonna crack this fridge if you don&#39;t pony up and free your zone, and we both know that!&quot;<br><br>Lonny backed away slowly, taking care not to make any loud noises or bump into anything. Once he rounded the corner, he scrambled away, slowly and quietly due to both his relative exhaustion and his hope that whatever he&#39;d just seen wouldn&#39;t hear him.<br><br><i>Or,</i> he thought, <i>I can go get backup, and then we can deal with that thing, and</i> then <i>Nick can help out with jerk-me. I like my new plan. It is a better plan. I don&#39;t have to fight robots by myself with the new plan.</i><br><br>Making a few random turns to make sure he was good and lost, Lonny suddenly stumbled into a hallway he&#39;d never been in before. He was sure he&#39;d never been there before, because he&#39;d definitely remember a hallway smelling of dead plants and filled with almost a dozen sparkly-looking entities, one of which spun around moments after his arrival and stared at the Dersite with vacant confusion. A human-looking Agent was slumped at the wall across from the Suvian, distinguishable from her in part by the fact that only the Sue had a slow stream of glittery blood trickling from her nose. A little further down the hallway, a second smaller Suvian, evidently noticing Lonny&#39;s presence, glanced up and hissed.<br><br>&quot;One of these days,&quot; Lonny muttered. &quot;One of these days I&#39;d like to make a simple, straightforward plan that doesn&#39;t have to deal with any new variables until I&#39;m almost done carrying it out.&quot;<br><br>((Ugh, I had half of this written on another computer yesterday, and then it froze and I had to redo it all on my tablet. The description is not nearly as good now, and Stu-Copernicus was supposed to be annoying, but now he just comes across as incomprehensible because I couldn&#39;t remember any of his lines and made up about half of his new slang. Which might be... better? I don&#39;t know.<br>Also, this might not be supposed to go here, but I&#39;m trying to keep chronology moderately stable. Then again, this post is so long that it might start warping time from its sheer gravitational mass.))</p>

            <p>Dawn had been having a good day. No, really, she had. The console hadn&#39;t [BEEP!]ed yet, no one had come by to bother her, and her tribble had yet to eat anything and start multiplying.<br><br>This, of course, had changed the moment a rather impossibly perfect version of herself (well, presumably: the glitter made it difficult to be sure) had appeared in front of her, wiggled her fingers in a wave, and giggled with a sound like too many bells chiming at once.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t a nightmare, Dawn decided, after making several sweeping arm movements while the intruder remained still. This wasn&#39;t her reflection. That meant...<br><br>A Sue. A Sue version of herself, no less.<br><br>Dawn McKenna nodded to herself once, and went for the flamethrower. Oddly enough, the Sue just continued to wave and giggle. Dawn paused for a moment, staring, but then shook her head and raised the flamethrower.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll give you one chance to get out of my RC,&quot; she said.<br><br>The Sue pouted. &quot;But it&#39;s my RC! Everyone loves me. Even with my tragic estrangement from my sister, and the three children I saved from death by canon characters, and I know everyone in HQ, and--&quot;<br><br>Dawn&#39;s mouth twisted, and it wasn&#39;t with a smile. &quot;Name?&quot;<br><br>The Sue giggled. &quot;I&#39;m, like, Constable-Agent Aurora Heather Way--but you can call me Dawnie! It&#39;s my nickname :D&quot;<br><br>Dawn grimaced, especially at the emoticon. &quot;Right. Aurora Heather Way, also known as <i>&#39;Dawnie&#39;</i>--which is Dawn Summers&#39; nickname, by the way, not mine--you&#39;re charged with impersonating and mimicking a PPC agent, knowing everyone in HQ, invading my RC, invading HQ, having a mostly illogical nickname, and warping my backstory. Oh, and annoying me. And being a personification of one of my worst nightmares. Your sentence is death, by flamethrower, to be carried out by me, Agent Dawn McKenna. Any last words?&quot;<br><br>Agent-Constable Dawnie batted her (ridiculously long and glittery) eyelashes. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t kill a helpless--&quot;<br><br>Half a minute later, Dawn glared down at the Glittery smear on her floor. &quot;I&#39;m not helpless. And I don&#39;t like Sues.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, that&#39;s a shame.&quot; Dawn spun around, and aimed the flamethrower at the speaker, who only smiled at her. &quot;Maybe you&#39;ll like me a bit better?&quot;<br><br>&quot;And you are?&quot;<br><br>The man smiled. He appeared to be about twenty or twenty-one, and looked almost completely ordinary compared to the Sue Dawn had just vanquished. His hair was light brown in color, his eyes were blue-green, and his smile was almost sweet. He wore a silver ring on his left forefinger, and was dressed almost entirely in black.<br><br>&quot;Lieutenant Commander Maverick Strife.&quot; At Dawn&#39;s raised eyebrows, he laughed softly. &quot;Well, no, not really. I just saw that on a list.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What sort of list?&quot; Dawn demanded.<br><br>The man grinned. &quot;It was titled &#39;<b>You are a Gary Stu</b>&#39;.&quot; He stumbled slightly over the bold, but managed to make it work. &quot;My real name&#39;s Shachar Brenton. I&#39;m, uh--&quot; He smiled again, a little sheepishly, and ducked his head. &quot;I&#39;m you. From an alternate universe.&quot; He paused, ducking his head again briefly. &quot;Uh. Surprise?&quot;<br><br>Dawn stared at him. He did look rather like her: same hair (in a wildly different cut), same eyes (a little deeper set), even a similar smile and build (excepting the obvious physical differences).<br><br>What really made Dawn believe it, though, was the shoelaces. They were purple, in the same shade as the thread holding her flashpatch to her t-shirt.<br><br>&quot;Great,&quot; she said, lowering the flamethrower. &quot;Wonderful. What&#39;re you doing here?&quot;<br><br>Shachar opened his mouth to answer, but then stopped, frowning. &quot;Um. Do you smell that?&quot;<br><br>Dawn frowned too. &quot;No? Wait, yes. The boiled cabbage and lavender and sunshine--Glaurung it. More Sues.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think it&#39;s coming from the hallway,&quot; Shachar said worriedly. He drew what looked interestingly like a Night-Night Gun from the <i>Agents of SHIELD</i> continuum, as well as a standard-issue <i>Star Trek</i> phaser (TOS-era), holding them easily. &quot;Should we--?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Dawn hoisted her flamethrower higher, checked that her Klingon knife was securely in its sheath, and subtly made sure that the Muggle-use wand was still in her pocket. (So it had been a quiet day, so what. It paid to be prepared. And the wand was cool.) &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br><br>Weapons at the ready, they walked out into the hallway, and straight into what seemed to be a battle on pause. Sues and Stus stood everywhere, along with several people who might have been (were hopefully) agents. Another agent slumped against the wall.<br><br>Dawn sighed, hefted the flamethrower, and decided that after this was done she was going to treat herself to a lot of chocolate. Maybe she could even swing a vacation in Mr. Wonka&#39;s Chocolate Factory...<br><br>But no, that would require actual good luck.<br><br>--<br><br>((Shachar is the Hebrew word for &#39;dawn&#39;, and can be used as both a male and a female name. Brenton has some sort of &#39;fire&#39; root words from Old English, although I&#39;ve forgotten exactly what. (It should perhaps be noted that Dawn&#39;s surname, McKenna, means something along the lines of &#39;born of fire&#39;). And Shachar&#39;s Stu name is, of course, taken from Neshomeh&#39;s list over on the main Board... ~DF))</p>

            <p><i>All right, good, she&#39;s not unconscious,</i> Lonny thought. <i>That&#39;s two against twelve now. Those are still bad odds, but-</i> His train of thought was interrupted by the two brown-haired humans who suddenly emerged from a nearby RC door, both purposefully holding what looked like a projectile weapon. <i>Okay,</i> he thought, <i>Now these are better odds. Not the best, but they&#39;ll work.</i> Fishing out a rubber bouncy ball from beneath his coat, Lonny tossed it at at the bleeding Sue, who had just tried to land a kick on her double. Upon impact, the ball flashed with red and blue light and made a sound like an air horn, causing the Sue to involuntarily stumble back.<br><br>Lonny smiled as he leaned forward, catching the ball with both hands as it bounced back at him. <i>Heh. I guess the time I spent finding this thing wasn&#39;t wasted after all.</i><br><br>-----<br>Copernicus had locked himself in the RC for precisely three minutes and fifty-two seconds by the time he realized that the machine outside was not going to stop. Never mind that the doors for his size of RC were specially prepared by Building Maintenance to be nearly shatterproof so that they wouldn&#39;t have to come down and fix size-related mishaps like an Agent breaking off part of the frame with his head, and never mind that the intruder would be able to break in much more easily if he aimed at the much more vulnerable wall right next to said doors, the intruder was apparently content to blast at the immovable object and scream nonsense at the person beyond it. Copernicus shrugged. He&#39;d learned long ago not to point out the mistakes of his opponents.<br><br>After clanking to the back of the RC, the golem bent over to pick up a small case of his possessions. Ignoring the screaming tirade of the machine outside(it seemed to be negatively comparing him to a mountain range at this point), he rummaged within it, and in the course of a few seconds retrieved a pitch-black oblong of uncertain material.<br><br>He paced along the back wall for a moment, trying his best to think of a good place to escape. It was no use going through the side walls; if he had any neighbors, they&#39;d be going through enough problems having to deal with all the noise, and if he didn&#39;t, the machine would notice him if he just walked out a door immediately to any side. The ceiling was no good, for obvious reasons, and the floor... well, Copernicus had been in the PPC for long enough to know an avoidable setup for hijinx when he saw one. So that left finding the right space on one of the back walls.<br><br>Roughly estimating as best he could with HQ&#39;s tenuous grasp of architecture, Copernicus flung his portable hole at a spot near a rear corner, and nodded with satisfaction when the wall faded away to reveal an adjacent hallway. Picking up the hole&#39;s carrying sack on the way out, Copernicus stepped through the gap in his wall, feeling the unpalatable twisting feeling he got when stepping through a spot where space and time disagreed. Once through the other side, he peeled the hole off from his exit point and walked calmly down the hallway, the primary concern in his mind being whether he should call the DIA or the DMFF to get rid of the robot. This lack of peril lasted a full fourteen seconds before a female agent turned a corner and almost crashed straight into him.<br><br>((From what it looks like, either Pippa&#39;s Ghost, Alltoometa, or Tigeress have agents who can interact with Copernicus now. I wanted to make it non-distinct to increase the chance of future interaction, and also I&#39;m not sure what their Agents looks like beyond a few details, since they&#39;re all pretty new to me.))</p>

            <p>&quot;All right. Emiran, I&#39;m taking a shot at Greystorm. Do the follow-up.&quot; Special Response Officer Naya&#39;Keegan crouched by the wall, invisible to the naked eye thanks to her armoursuit&#39;s cloaking field. She quickly shouldered her M-92 Mantis rifle and carefully lined up a shot at the armoured Stu. &quot;Firing.&quot;<br><br>The hypersonic slug caught Greystorm in the back, right below the sword arm&#39;s shoulder pauldron. To the quarian&#39;s great surprise, there was a sound like two hollow cans smashing together and then a part of the Generic Surface ceiling disintegrated into dust. Naya&#39;s cloak dropped and the now-visible quarian backed away to the cover of a Response Centre&#39;s doorway, drawing her sidearm. &quot;Ricochet! How the... ugh, Suvian armour. Emiran, staser him! I&#39;ll pick off the rest!&quot; <br><br>She motioned to her partner who was leaning against the doorway of the RC opposite. The Time Lord dashed out of cover, black Inverness coat flapping about him, and made a beeline for the armoured Stu. The ex-soldier slid to a halt two metres away from Greystorm and shot multiple times. This time the blasts managed to make the Stu stumble backwards, but he was still alive thanks to his unnaturally strong armour. Seeing as he bought the Greystorm&#39;s would-be victims some time, the DIA agent grabbed the closest person by her denim jacket and pulled her away from the Stu. &quot;Move it! Get out befo-- URK!&quot; <br><br>Emiran&#39;s rifle clattered to the floor as its owner was picked up and thrown down the hall by Greystorm. The Time Lord flew into Naya and the two were left on the floor, struggling to find their breath and to get back on their legs. <br><br></p>

            <p>Lonny had waited a little too long wondering how he was going to incapacitate a now-prepared Sue with his light-up ball. On the plus side, the extra time had given him a chance to regain his breath, but on the minus side, the entire hallway had now erupted into turmoil. Lonny heard a loud boom from somewhere off to his right, and suddenly something incredibly fast had smashed into one of the Stus, ricocheting off off its armor, hitting the wall, and finally slamming into the ceiling, breaking through concrit and Generic Surface with equal ease.<br><br>Lonny yelped and dove down, passing directly under the damaged spot on the concrit wall, which was currently leaking complaints about improper use of a semicolon. He looked up just in time to see his potential ally wrenched from the quite literal mouth of her attacker, and the Stu that the object had bounced off of, who seemed to have taken a position of most prominent figure if not outright leader of the Suvian band, gloating loudly in bold capital letters and holding his sword before him as a sign of challenge. <i>Blast it, I should have known to bring my knives with me,</i> he complained. He stopped and grunted in irritation. <i>While I&#39;m having this nice bout of wishful thinking, I should&#39;ve also brought an armored car and two dozen cans of whatever these Sues are allergic to.</i><br><br>Lonny looked up from his position on the floor, staring above <b>LORD GREYSTORM</b> to the ceiling beyond to make sure there wasn&#39;t going to be anything blank, gray, and deadly falling on his head from above. When glancing past the titanic Stu, he double-took, noticing from his vantage point something very odd about his armor placement. Lonny couldn&#39;t put his finger on it at first, and then the realization hit him.<br><br><i>No, no, I can&#39;t be seeing that, that&#39;s stupid, why would the armor not cover that spot, it&#39;s kind of important,</i> he thought for a moment. <i>Then again, Mary Sues don&#39;t cover their navels half the time, and that&#39;s a </i>huge<i> disadvantage. Might as well see what I can do.</i><br><br>The Dersite lay motionless on the floor for a few seconds, waiting until the sword-wielding enemy had his back to him. Then, just after seeing a brief opportunity, Lonny scrambled to his feet, adjusted his position for just long enough to confirm his balance, and quickly and powerfully launched an upward kick between the Stu&#39;s legs.<br><br>Lonny flinched upon making contact; he&#39;d aimed his foot imprecisely, and it had caught on a piece of <b>LORD GREYSTORM</b>&#39;s back plating. Regardless, the Stu howled in quite-possibly-played-up agony, bending over and bellowing at the top of its lungs. Lonny knew that if he showed weakness, the massive being would take advantage of such as soon as it regained its footing, so he decided to take advantage of a time-honored narrative tradition.<br><br>&quot;And that,&quot; Lonny said, smiling through the new pain blossoming in his ankle, &quot;is why you should never think your opponent is above making attacks to the crotch.&quot; <i>Note to self:</i> he mentally appended, <i>I am also bad at making one-liners when I&#39;m tired.</i> The Dersite climbed awkwardly onto his incapacitated opponent&#39;s back, wrapping his legs around the Stu&#39;s neck while sitting on its shoulders in a move he half-remembered from his brief time watching wrestling. He wasn&#39;t sure how much longer he&#39;d be able to hold the position, but he knew that while he should be cutting off the Stu&#39;s airflow if his stance was right, said stance could very easily be wrong. To tip the odds a little further in his favor, he leaned forward, using his full body weight to push the Stu closer to the ground. Lonny wasn&#39;t sure if he could kill the Stu unarmed, but he could at least hold it down long enough for someone else to make the final blow.<br><br>((I was originally going to end this with Lonny picking up Emiran&#39;s rifle and blasting the Stu in the head, but I couldn&#39;t get him to do it. He&#39;s not squeamish, and he&#39;s not averse to taking Suvian life, since he uses his knives and daggers all the time, and he knows it&#39;s dangerous to leave someone like <b>LORD GREYSTORM</b> alive, but he apparently just really does not like guns. Character moment! I&#39;ve just not figured out all of the reasons behind it yet, or if there even are any.<br>Besides, him taking the time to go over and get the rifle would allow <b>LORD GREYSTORM</b> time to charge him and either slash at him with the sword or pin him down beneath hundreds of pounds of Stu-armor. That said, I fully expect Lonny to get that massive sword hurled at him before this is up.))</p>

            <p>The swarm-Sues hovered around each other in vague clusters clicking their insectoid mandibles together while staring implacably down at the mass of Agents and other Sues below. Since the hallway hadn&#39;t been intended to carry nearly their number, most of them were quickly pressed closely onto each other, blocking the portal with their combined slimy mass. The few that had managed to break free of the collection swooped down on Sue-double and Agent alike. The hissing Sue Lonny had noticed earlier latched onto the chest of one of the swarm and crashed it into a wall, but many of the Sue-doubles were picked up and flung around mercilessly by members of the swarm, while others swooped down to antagonize the two brown-haired blaster-wielding humans.<br><br>Lonny picked himself up off of the Agent he&#39;d been thrown on top of, his eyes closed in response to the bolt of pain that suddenly began shooting up his wounded leg and into his lower back. &quot;Ow, ow, ow. Is whoever I hit okay? I felt bones on whatever I landed on, and that&#39;s rarely a good thing.&quot; Suddenly, a new voice sounded from behind a nearby corner, seemingly packaged with its own derisive sneer.<br><br>&quot;Ah, <i>there</i> you are.&quot; said the voice, growing more self-satisfied as its bearer drew closer. &quot;I&#39;d almost thought I&#39;d lost you for a second, pipsqueak. For a <i>second</i>.&quot; Lonny opened his eyes just in time to see his Stu double rounding a corner, still holding one of his immense battle-axes in his hand. With a flick of his wrist, it burst into blue-green flame.<br><br><b>LORD GREYSTORM</b> limped toward the new arrival, obviously still smarting from the recent blow to the groin. &quot;<b>SO A FOOL ARRIVES TO CHALLENGE THE MIGHT OF LORD GREYSTORM?&quot;</b> the summoner bellowed. <b>&quot;HAVE AT ME, BEAST OF WICKEDNESS!&quot;</b><br><br>&quot;I wasn&#39;t talking to you, you unobservant little pitstain!&quot; snapped Stu-Lonny, removing a thick and noticeably sharp knife from one of his many holsters and throwing it at <b>LORD GREYSTORM</b>. With typical Suvian accuracy, the blade struck right between <b>LORD GREYSTORM</b>&#39;s eyes, the massive swordsman&#39;s reflexes too dulled by pain and the summoning of the portal to form a proper block, and the other Stu collapsed. Other-Lonny smirked. &quot;Good freakin&#39; riddance. He was making so much noise I&#39;d have found you sorry sacks in the freakin&#39; <i>dark</i>.&quot;<br><br>Lonny frantically turned to the Agents next to him, which he now noticed included a quarian and a Time Lord in addition to the unfortunate fellow he&#39;d landed on. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve got any other plans for how to deal with this?&quot; he asked. &quot;Because I think I&#39;ve used up all of my practical ideas.&quot;<br><br>((I think Lord Greystorm(no need to bold-caps any more, since he&#39;s dead) went a little overboard as a threat when he summoned a mass of swarm-Sues. We&#39;ve only got a handful of people in this RP, you know. Outnumbering the Agents is one thing, but if you&#39;re going to absolutely overwhelm them with enemies that by their nature are better than almost anything that&#39;s thrown at them, I say that&#39;s time to retire a bit of the opposing force, even if it&#39;s only the figurehead and a few of the bit Sues that we never actually described in full. We need to have at least a <i>little</i> balance here.<br><br>Now, all I need to do is find an excuse for Stu-Copernicus to stop obliviously shooting up RC 52080&#39;s door. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll think of something.))</p>

            <p>Emiran was the first agent to push himself off the ground. He quickly shut both portals, wrung out his tricorn, and plopped it back on his head. Drawing a staser pistol from its holster, the DIA agent took aim at Stu!Lonny and sank several stun-shots into the carapacian&#39;s chest. The Stu convulsed as the bolts of energy hit him and was still. The Time Lord quickly rushed to the Other Dersite, rolled him on his belly, and slapped several pairs of handcuffs around the unconscious Stu&#39;s wrists and ankles. &quot;You&#39;re not going anywhere, buddy-boy,&quot; grunted the Gallifreyan man as he worked. &quot;DMSER will take good care of you. Don&#39;t try to break the cuffs: your powers don&#39;t work here.&quot;<br><br>Naya, by virtue of her hermetic bodysuit, was relatively unaffected by the wave of water. After a quick electronic systems check, she typed a command into her Omni-tool and tuned her suit radio to a DIA frequency.<br><br>&quot;Central, this is Keegan reporting. Requesting backup in Reality Room nine. We flushed a bunch of Suvians into it with the Frost Maneuver. Be advised: we have PPC agents and Suvian duplicates in the crowd. Bring glitter detectors and flamethrowers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Acknowledged, Keegan. We&#39;re sending a team your way. Stand by.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Understood, Central. Keegan out.&quot;<br><br>Naya patted her right hip and sighed in disappointment as she realized her Carnifex pistol was lost in the wave. She flipped her sniper rifle&#39;s safety to on, grabbed it by the barrel, and slammed the stock into the face of a insectoid Suvian that had tried to sneak up on her. As it fell to the ground, Naya gave it another solid whack and turned to face the rest of the agents.<br><br>&quot;Well? Are we gonna start cleaning this place up or what?&quot;<br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Rina grinned in reply to the DIA agent&#39;s question. She paused. &quot;How exactly do you propose we do that?&quot;<br><br>Naya gestured around the room. &quot;You know what a Reality Room is, yeah? If we can lure the Sues in here somehow, their power will be pretty much gone, but I don&#39;t see Techno-Dann ready with his speedo...&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>What?</i>&quot; Rina shook her head. &quot;Never mind. Hang on- I have an idea.&quot; She ran over to the door and peeked around the corner. Upon seeing that Sues were continuing to appear from various portals, she gritted her teeth and stepped into view.<br><br>&quot;Edward and Jacob are totally gay for each other, Harry Potter promotes Satan worship, and Legolas looks like a Barbie doll!&quot;</p>

            <p>((I thought we agreed that we couldn&#39;t control other peoples&#39; agents? That line was fairly OOC for Naya: she would definitely not have mentioned Dann in speedo... in fact, it kinda looks like a non sequitur to me.))<br><br>- - - <br><br>Naya, in the middle of clubbing another Agent!Sue, looked up at Rina. &quot;You could have at least <i>waited</i> until we killed all of the Sues already in here! Emiran! Go and do some crowd control at the door, will you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye, miss!&quot; said the Time Lord, picking up his sidearm. &quot;Keep an eye on black-shell over here: he&#39;s a dangerous one!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m busy right now!&quot; shouted the quarian as she blocked a katana slash with her rifle. &quot;Find somebody else! Actually, never mind! Here comes the cavalry!&quot;<br><br>A dozen blue-edged portals <i>popped</i> into existence, each letting though a stream heavily armed DIA officers. The Internal Affairs Agents started clearing the room one Suvian at the time with the help of glitter-detecting medical tricorders and good old-fashioned flamethrowers. <br><br>Minutes later, the air stank of smoke and fuel. Both the swarm-sues and the agent lookalikes were reduced to ash puddles. One of the DIA reinforcements, a towering protoss clad in a black tunic and a glimmering golden chestplate, pointed at the doors and telepathisized a command to the entire room:<br><br>&quot;<i>Let in the next batch of Suvians! Abbot, Park, and Becker: use a portal to emerge on the left side of the corridor. Fire Flash, Archer, and Molina: take the right side. Cut off their retreat and force them into this room.</i>&quot;<br></p>

            <p>&quot;You flatter me, you really do,&quot; he groaned, blinking the wet muck out of his eyes. Slowly getting to his feet, Lonny noticed the Floater who had turned and ran away from the watery onslaught, lying supine on the floor next to the battered bodies of two swarm-Sues. The Dersite limped over to his shackled counterpart, leaning against him with one hand and searching through the Stu&#39;s weapon collection with the other.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, he probably meant you,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But it&#39;s nice to think I&#39;d have a reputation among the sort of people who can wipe out the contents of a corridor in seconds, you know?&quot; Stu-Lonny growled incoherently in response, and struggled mightily against his restraints.<br><br>Lonny waggled a finger with his foraging hand. &quot;Hey, no thrashing. Don&#39;t be a poor sport about all this. Be realistic; they&#39;d just take all of these from you anyway.&quot; The PPC Agent untied a pair of knives from a collection of scabbards and cords on the Stu&#39;s back, weighing them and their sheaths in his hands with satisfaction. &quot;Not the size I&#39;m used to, but it&#39;s a fine product you&#39;ve got here. I&#39;d thank you if you hadn&#39;t tried to kill me a few minutes ago.&quot;<br><br>Spotting his rubber ball flashing damply on the floor a few feet away, Lonny snatched it up and placed it securely in a jacket pocket. He cursed himself for not doing so earlier, but to be fair, when faced with an unexpected tidal wave one tended to think of how to preserve oneself above how one could best avoid damaging the electronic parts of a novelty toy.<br><br>Suddenly, a recognizable telepathic voice thrummed in the space between Lonny&#39;s thoughts, and when he looked up, he saw a massive being in gold armor stepping into the room, taking charge of several patchless Agents who were neutralizing the remaining swarm-Sues.<br><br>&quot;Oh, wow!&quot; the Dersite exclaimed, all grogginess suddenly leaving his voice as he rushed toward the protoss as best he could with his injured ankle. &quot;It&#39;s <i>you</i>! Taldaris, wasn&#39;t it? The guy who torched the shapeshifter in New Caledonia? Remember me? I was there too! Too late to help, unfortunately, but hey, I can help out here! I&#39;ve got new knives and everything!&quot; Lonny leaned back to make eye contact with the massive Officer, his usual grin extra-bright as it returned to his face.</p>

            <p>&quot;<i>Yes, I remember you,</i>&quot; said Taldaris telepathically, bending over slightly to look over his chestplate at the grinning carapacian. &quot;<i>New Caledonia, nearly a year ago. Your name is Lonny, correct?</i>&quot;<br><br>The High Templar raised his head and surveyed his surroundings. Agents and DIA staff were positioning themselves in a very large semi-circle around the main doors, waiting for the next wave of Suvians. Anything that entered the room would be caught in the crossfire of over two dozen well-armed PPC agents. Satisfied that his colleagues were prepared for the next fight, the protoss looked at Lonny again. <br><br>&quot;<i>I would advise you to stay out of the next fight, Dersite. Your ankle is starting to swell; it might be sprained or broken. You should head to Medical to have that looked at.</i>&quot;<br><br>There was some commotion at the doors and a squad of Sues rushed into the Reality Room, chased by five human DIA agents and a MLP-verse Earth pony. Taldaris raised his right forearm, channeled his psionic energy into the gauntlet that covered it, and pointed the newly-formed psi-blade at the Suvians. &quot;<i>Close the doors! Weapons free!</i>&quot;<br><br> </p>

            <p>Silver just ran. Away. To somewhere. Away from Sue!Silver. She fumbled at her side for her hunting knife and unsheathed it while she ran. Unfortunately for her, she had completely lost her sense of direction. She glanced back over her shoulder. Sue!Silver was gaining on her. In desperation, Silver charged into another corridor, her hope almost lost. But then, upon turning the corner, she found that many, many agents were fighting against different &#39;Sues, yet more were coming from around another bend. With Sue!Silver behind her, she really couldn&#39;t do anything but turn and face her. <br>So, she did, her small dagger clashing against the &#39;Sue&#39;s longer, sharper, better knife. <br>Almost immediately, she received a long scratch on her arm. She walked backwards slowly, trying to keep away the &#39;Sue&#39;s strokes with her dagger.</p>

            <p>...the butt of a spear came and knocked the Sue&#39;s dagger out of her perfectly manicured hand. The Sue span around to face her new attacker-- make that <i>attackers</i>: a brown-haired woman with the spear and a blond bare-fisted man that suddenly darted forward and swung his fist.<br><br>Harris Frost threw what witnesses would later recall as the sloppiest, harmless, and most comical left hook in the history of the PPC. The Spy&#39;s fist lazily arched towards the Sue&#39;s jaw like a crane and, despite the Sue leaning back to avoid the blow, managed to bop her chin with his wrist. As momentum carried Harris forward, the Spy looked up and saw Sue!Silver reach down with both hands to throttle him. Again, the spear darted forward-- tip first this time-- and scored a grazing hit on the Sue&#39;s left side. Harris fell to the floor and hurriedly crawled behind his spear-wielding companion for protection. <br><br>&quot;Stay out of this, Harris!&quot; said the spearwoman, slowly circling the Sue with her weapon at the ready. &quot;Just-- look! Take care of the real agent over there. I&#39;ll hold this one off.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You got it, Sonia!&quot; replied Harris as his comrade positioned herself between Sue!Silver and the real agent. Harris approached  Silver and grabbed her by the non-injured arm, pulling her away from the fight. &quot;Let&#39;s go, ma&#39;am! This place isn&#39;t safe!&quot;</p>

And if there was a Sue nearby who had similar powers...<br><br>&quot;If she is a Mary Sue with HQ&#39;s walls capable of temporal distortions on the level you imply, we will definitely need to destroy her as soon as possible,&quot; he replied. &quot;Do you know any ways that we would be able to incapacitate her ourselves?

I have encountered another problem that they will need to help clean up later, and I do not wish to overtax them.&quot; He blinked. &quot;Oh, and my name is Copernicus, in response to your introduction.

Stephanie could have, pretty easily, become Stephaniella.))<br><br>((I&#39;m also enjoying that subplot, quite a bit.  That being said, it&#39;s likely that at some point contact with a different Sue or Agent in the know will occur.))</p>

            <p>Copernicus scanned the area around him. On his third pass, he saw motion at the corner of his vision that fit the pattern of something trying to duck out of sight.<br><br>&quot;I see her,&quot; he said, keeping his voice low. &quot;If she can do all you claim, I don&#39;t know how to get rid of her completely with what I have, but I&#39;ve devised a plan that should keep her contained for a while.&quot; He stood up, not quite to his full height but close enough to not attract suspicion while still keeping his quieter voice audible to the shorter agent.<br><br>&quot;But you shouldn&#39;t be so conspicuous. If she didn&#39;t think that you had noticed her before, she probably will now that you have risen up on your toes and whispered in my ear. That&#39;s just for future experience, of course. There&#39;s nothing that we can do to alter what already happened.&quot; Copernicus briefly considered moving toward the direction of the motion, but nixed the idea. He didn&#39;t have all of the relevant information yet. &quot;You said she had a weakness, didn&#39;t you? What is it? I want to know how to keep her from teleporting away before she can be captured properly.&quot;<br><br>-----<br>An indeterminate distance away, Copernicus&#39;s darker-colored mechanical counterpart noticed something strange. The sound his blasts were making had changed, no longer the low booms produced by his explosive blasts landing on an unyielding surface, but a more hollow thumping. He paused in dim confusion, slightly grateful for the chance to cool off his shoulder cannons. They may have possessed unlimited ammo, but the vibrations from their unending barrage had started to make his head ring.<br><br>Stu-Copernicus glanced around the site of impact, noticing with distaste that the door had not been visibly harmed in the slightest. Somewhat more encouragingly, however, the constant blasts had damaged its foundations, pushing the doorframe in from the wall on one side and revealing a small split in the Generic Surface. Since Stud rarely stop to wonder whether what was happening in front of them violated multiple laws of architecture, the machine wasted no time in bending down and testing the new opening. It was too small to pass through, and in the wrong position to use as leverage for ripping the door out, but it was a perfect size to shout through.<br><br>&quot;Almost there, dog! Quaking yet? If you&#39;re not, I&#39;ll stock a few ticks to let you drop down quietly... wait.&quot; Narrowing his eyes, Stu-Copernicus scanned as much of the RC as he could from the hole. From what he&#39;d seen of it, there were only a few places for the other to hide, but none of them held anything other than what had been there to begin with. The machine reeled back, Stuish rage beginning to rise in him.<br><br>&quot;What? The hopper bounced? That&#39;s not even in the realm, man! How&#39;d he pass it? He was as box as an armored car, and that just doesn&#39;t grok to stealth!&quot; Raising his shoulder cannons to their highest position, Stu-Copernicus fired several shots into the ceiling. Not even the resulting muffled sounds of fearful confusion from the floor above him were enough to lessen his anger.<br><br>&quot;You can&#39;t just carry this bro on like that, you hear?&quot; he shouted into the nearby corridors. &quot;You&#39;ve got to get back here and pop this candle, or I&#39;ll just take my loss and rip down the whole zone!&quot; Clanking off in search of his counterpart, Stu-Copernicus shook his head in frustration. No one had any respect for the process of breaking open doors any more. He remembered when this used to be easy.</p>

            <p>Revealed, Stephaniella abandoned her attempt to be stealthy.  &quot;But I just want to help you, twin! Can&#39;t you see that?  We...&quot;<br><br>Stephanie considered making a snappy retort, but on second thought-  &quot;Stephaniella&quot; would likely have a difficult time hearing her clearly while she was talking like this- Wait.  If she&#39;d be deaf to a retort- might she be unable to hear a whisper?  It was worth trying- already, she was properly positioned.<br><br>&quot;Her power may be tied to her voice like mine is.  I already know that the travel isn&#39;t random, and can be triggered at other times rather than actually on the hour, BUT I THINK that silencing her for a while could do the trick.  In theory.  Unless or until she caught on...&quot;<br><br>There was <i>something</i> nagging at the girl&#39;s mind- something involving the book still clutched in her hand.  What was she missing...<br><br>-It&#39;d have to wait.  Her statement regarding her GL had been no exaggeration.  Her eyes were becoming more and more speshul.  Her skin was starting to glitter.  Her hair was growing out and becoming impossibly smooth, causing roots of blonde bright enough for an urple prose description to start showing.  Even her uniform looked more attractive, having stretched and ruched itself in a flattering manner as she went up 1.6 cup sizes, gained a narrower waist, and otherwise grown curvier.<br><br>Worst of all, she was becoming more and more sympathetic to her counterpart.  Which reminded her-<br><br>&quot;I AM NOT YOUR EFFTRIPLEASTERISKING TWIN!&quot;  Perhaps foolishly- hopefully the Sue wouldn&#39;t read it and realize what Stephanie wasn&#39;t quite thinking of- she hurled <i>Philosopher&#39;s Stone</i> at her counterpart.<br><br>It missed.  But having done something that unwise and failed so miserably- the opposite of a Sue- helped in a different way- Stephanie&#39;s skin stopped glittering, her eyes turned blue-gray again, and her hair, though it stayed at its current length, started getting very tangled as her roots stopped meriting urple prose.<br><br>Unfortunately, however, her uniform hadn&#39;t snapped back with her- because that would just have been Sueish.  Unbuttoning several shirt buttons at her waist, glancing ruefully at the... deflation, and being a bit glad that her bottoms had shifted to the cut of low- rise jeans and hence wouldn&#39;t further hurt her waist, Stephanie fixed the situation as well as she could- tying a jacket around her waist to conceal skin, tying a knot in the pants to narrow the band.  She wouldn&#39;t have bothered that much, but Sues had a habit of showing skin and being further Sued really was the last thing she needed.  Fortunately, her... poorly fitting uniform seemed to be preventing that for the moment- Sues&#39; clothing more often than not fit perfectly, after all.<br><br>(And, of course, it just wouldn&#39;t be okay for her pants to fall down right now.)<br><br>((Just thought of something- what if an urple cloud were to form?))</p>

The junior agent and the wizard peeked out from behind the couch, threatening Rina with a Webley Mk VI revolver and a wand respectively. <br><br>&quot;Hey, missy! You put your &#39;ands up in the air where we can see &#39;em!&quot; said Yakov. &quot;No sudden movements or we shoot!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... how about only <i>you</i> shoot, sir?&quot; whispered Gaspard. <br><br>&quot;Whaddya mean? &#39;Stupefy&#39; never &#39;urt anyone. You gots your wand, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Technically speaking sir, the only spell on this thing is shooting up to six bullets at people. They&#39;ve been known to cause high velocity lead poisoning in their targets.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, right. You gots that Muggle pew-pew thing. Well, wot&#39;s the point of carryin&#39; it if you ain&#39;t gonna use it? Sheesh! Er... yeah. Don&#39;t move or <i>I</i> shoot,&quot; said Yakov, gesturing with his wand at Rina.<br><br>Gaspard half-lowered his revolver and said: &quot;Prove to us that you aren&#39;t one of <i>them</i>! Tell us something only a real PPC agent would know!&quot;</p>

As Yakov moved towards the door to barricade it again, Gaspard stopped in front of Rina and said: &quot;Apologies, ma&#39;am. We can never be too careful in our line of work.&quot; The Spy noticed the Assassin&#39;s crowbar on the floor. &quot;You know, there are still Sues outside. Shouldn&#39;t you be carrying a gun instead of a mêlée weapon?&quot; He pulled the Five-seven pistol he acquired earlier out of his Adventure pouch and offered it to Rina grip-first. &quot;Here, take it. I&#39;ve already got a gun and I don&#39;t need another one. Er... It&#39;s loaded but not cocked. The safety is still on--&quot;<br><br>Gaspard&#39;s explanation was cut short by the arrival of two twins bursting though the door and spouting gibberish.

            <p>After conferring by means of shared signals- such comes in handy for rebels, and the pair (having led identical lives up until their arrival at the PPC) understood each other&#39;s personal signals well enough so that the transfer of info could have very easily been mistaken for one done through paranormal means- and speaking up, the pair repeated themselves, voices blending rather eerily into one.<br><br>&quot;Err...

Well, when I say <i>different</i>, I mean sad and alone and unimportant. Look at this. So spartan! Table with chairs, couch with TV, smaller table with stuff on it, half-stocked kitchenette over there, bedroom over there, bathroom there. Back at <i>my</i> pad, I&#39;ve at least got some decorations up. You should do that too, son. Livens up the place. Oh, come on. Don&#39;t just stand by the door looking like you just saw a ghost! Come, sit!&quot; the Other gestured towards the couch in front of the television with his pistol. &quot;Oh, and close the door too. Lock it, please. I don&#39;t want any interruptions during these talks.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... right.&quot; said Gaspard quietly, gently closing the door and fumbling with the lock with his suddenly very cold and sweaty fingers. He stiffly walked back towards the couch as the Other pulled a folding stool from his Satchel of Holding. As Gaspard took a seat on his couch, the Other sat on the stool and put his legs up on the coffee table, kicking away the neat stacks of notes and DVDs as he did so.<br><br>&quot;Firstly,&quot; said the Other, producing a flask from his satchel, &quot;I would like to apologize for the brusque entry. I like to think I am a gentleman, but sometimes there needs to be a little force applied in the right places for things to happen.&quot; He took a swig from the flask and offered it to Gaspard. &quot;Firewhiskey. Want some?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, no, that&#39;s okay,&quot; said Gaspard, blinking sweat out of his eyes. &quot;You said you wanted to talk?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. Now, second order of business...&quot; the Other put his flask back in his satchel, pulled a smartphone from his pockets, and snapped a picture of Gaspard with it. &quot;Thank you. Tomoko is gonna get a real laugh out of this. Into the bag it goes. You know, alternate me-- <i>you</i> that is-- you&#39;re really ugly. Like, really fekking ugly. How do you live with yourself, son?&quot;<br><br>The Spy&#39;s mouth worked silently for a few seconds. &quot;Uh... I don&#39;t... what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, seriously. You got acne out of the wazoo, a crooked nose, ugly eyes-- which look like some sort of mud brown colour to me-- stupid haircut, and even stupider bowtie. What the heck, man? Wear a tie like a real man!&quot; The Other pointed to his simple black tie with the muzzle of this Five-seven. &quot;Did you buy it yourself?&quot;<br><br>&quot;N-no. It w-was a gift.&quot; said Gaspard, trying to keep his voice steady. <br><br>The Other stared at his &quot;host&quot;, then at his pistol. He made a sudden movement with this firearm and Gaspard dodged accordingly. &quot;Oh. Still worried about this thing, right? Like I said, I&#39;m a gentleman. No need to feel threatened among alternate selves, eh?&quot; The Other thumbed the magazine release and let the mag clatter to the floor. He then pulled sharply on the slide and caught the ejected cartridge in midair. To finish, he pointed the unloaded pistol at Gaspard and pulled the trigger. &quot;CLICK! Ha ha! You should see your face! Ha ha ha... ah. Now that I&#39;m disarmed, you should do the same. Oh, don&#39;t play stupid with me. We&#39;re the same person, you and I! I know we both have weapons on us. I put aside my pistol, you do the same to yours. No funny business, eh?&quot;<br><br>Gaspard very slowly reached into his Adventure Pouch strapped to his belt and pulled out a Webley Mk VI revolver. He broke the revolver in half to show it was unloaded and set it on the table. The Other arched an eyebrow and picked it up. <br><br>&quot;A revolver? Really? You&#39;re ugly <i>and</i> stupid. Sheeeit, don&#39;t you want a semi-automatic by your side?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not what I&#39;m supposed to do,&quot; said Gaspard. &quot;I&#39;m a Spy. I&#39;m just there to see the sights, not kill loads of people. A revolver reminds me that what firepower I have is limited and should not be used wastefully.&quot;<br><br>The Other shrugged and started playing with the Webley&#39;s hammer. &quot;Yeah, so? I&#39;m a Spy too. Recon Department: first ones in, last ones out. If something doesn&#39;t fit in a fic, we shoot it dead! The Assassins take out the stragglers and BAM! The Word World has been saved. That&#39;s not how it works for you guys? No? Man, this world sucks. Oh, personal questions: ever had a girlfriend? Been promoted? Had lots of friends? Killed something, maybe?&quot; The Other put the revolver back on the table and stared at his alternate self over steepled fingers.<br><br>&quot;Er.... none of the above...?&quot; said Gaspard.<br><br>&quot;Not even a kill? I thought we were in the business of removing unwanted influences from worlds. What good is someone who can&#39;t fight?&quot;<br><br>The Spy stared at his Webley lying on the table. &quot;<br><br>&quot;I just wanted to know how much of a loser you are. I&#39;m hopping from AU to AU, interviewing all my alternate selves, and you&#39;re the biggest loser so far. Look, more evidence,&quot; the Other pointed to the fallen stack of DVDs. &quot;You watch <i>My Little Pony</i>. Hey, where is your fedora?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Look, did you specifically come here to insult me or do you have something else to do?&quot;<br><br>The Other struck a mock pensive pose. &quot;Hm... You&#39;re fun to screw with, but really boring. I should go. Well, I can&#39;t say this has been a pleasure. I&#39;ve met the most pathetic <i>me</i> yet. Maybe the next one will be a bit more interesting. Toodle-oo.&quot;<br><br>With that, the Other scooped his Five-seven off the table, retrieved the magazine from the floor, and put the parts in his suit&#39;s front pocket. He folded the stool back up and tucked it under his arm as he walked towards the door. <br><br>Gaspard suddenly grabbed his revolver in one hand and pulled a speedloader from his Adventure pouch. He pushed the six bullets into the cylinder using the device and snapped the revolver shut. The Spy quickly rose from his seated position and pointed the gun at his doppelgänger. &quot;Stop right there. You&#39;re not allowed to leave. Any suspicious move and I&#39;ll shoot.&quot;<br><br>The Other stopped with one hand on the lock. &quot;You&#39;re too much of a coward to shoot me. You never killed anything before, so why start now?&quot; he asked without turning around.<br><br>&quot;You are a threat to the PPC. I&#39;ll stop you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll be travelling to another universe in a couple of minutes. Sure, some of my kind are out in the hallways, but agents from your universe should clean them up quickly. I promise I won&#39;t cause trouble.&quot; <br><br>Click. Gaspard had thumbed the revolver&#39;s hammer. &quot;I&#39;m serious. If you know what&#39;s good for you, surrender now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think so. Goodbye.&quot; the Other unlocked the door and twisted the doorknob. <br><br>&quot;All right,&quot; said Gaspard, lowering the revolver. &quot;I guess that means Yakov can take care of you instead.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What--&quot;<br><br>The Other unlocked the door and pulled it open. At that moment, the RC&#39;s bathroom door exploded outwards and let through Yakov Minin, wand drawn, yelling &quot;PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!&quot;<br><br>The Other&#39;s arms and legs snapped together, causing him to fall backwards. The Russian wizard ran over to the Stu&#39;s body and dragged it away from the door while Gaspard locked the door again and shoved a nearby table in front of it for good measure. Once the PPC agents caught their breath, they looked at each other and grinned. <br><br>&quot;That was a really lucky time to go for a bathroom break, right?&quot; chuckled Yakov, twirling his wand around his fingers. &quot;Didn&#39;t even notice me in there. I heard everythin&#39; that poor sod said to ya. Rude fellow, isn&#39;t &#39;ee?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed he is, sir,&quot; said Gaspard, wiping the cold sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. &quot;Your timing is impeccable, as always. What should we do with him?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I say hand him to DMSER. It&#39;s where &#39;ee belongs, right? We don&#39;t get lots of agent look-alike Suvians, do we?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agreed, sir. I should message the DIA while I&#39;m at it: he mentioned others in the hallways.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do it, man. Afterwards, &#39;ow about we finish that movie?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sounds good, sir.&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>Rina was unused to the silence, but with Randa off exploring Headquarters and Mcgonagoll being suspiciously silent in his web nest thing, she allowed herself to lounge on her bed, a well-thumbed copy of <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i> in her hands, looking forward to a good long time to read.<br><br>She&#39;d barely turned to the first page, though, when a smell similar to boiled cabbage met her nostrils, quickly followed by a loud shriek.

            <p>Seventeen years ago, a nerdy guy and his right around nine months pregnant wife sat down to watch The Empire Strikes Back. At the point where they&#39;re wrapping up the Hoth story arc, the wife has become incredibly bored. So bored, in fact, that her body decides it would rather go into labor than continue watching. So it does. The wife is in the hosptal until eleven o&#39;clock, when she finally gives birth, an hour before May 5th. So, that&#39;s how my mother went into labor to get out of watching Star Wars, then gave birth to me on May the Fourth. That&#39;s not even the best part. My Dad paused the movie for her so they could finish when they got home.</p>

            <p>And yeah, it&#39;s not really laid out anywhere on the wiki, is it? I might go fix that later today. Most of us know this from reading a bunch of spin-offs, though. I recommend doing that.<br><br>Anyway: In modern times, people tend to wind up as agents in one of two ways:<br><br>1. They were recruited from a badfic. This generally entails the assigned agents giving them a choice about it, but when the choice is A) join us, B) become a background nobody, or C) possibly cease to exist, most people are gonna choose A. Especially since a lot of them get to witness why the bad writing is so bad up close and personal, which tends to motivate them to help fix it.<br><br>2. They wandered or fell into HQ through a plothole (or similar vehicle) from their universe of origin. Why they decide to stay is up to them, but it seems that plotholes attract people who love fiction, hate bad writing, and are intrigued by the idea of adventures to their favorite worlds. It seems likely to me that other types fall through, too, but we don&#39;t hear about the ones who decide HQ is too freaky for them and get someone to send them home and (I&#39;m guessing) wipe their memory.<br><br>In the past, people joined by actually hearing about the PPC and applying for a job. <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/DoSAT/story02.html">Techno-Dann</a> and <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/architeuthis/mission01.html">Architeuthis</a> both did this. It&#39;s rare to see this now, but still a perfectly valid option. Dann had an interview with his Head of Department after visiting Personnel, too. This might be unique to DoSAT, or (and this is what I think) it might be common to any of the departments that require a certain level of practical skills/technical expertise/strength of character. Medical springs to mind first and foremost. FicPsych, the DIA, and Finance, too.<br><br>A vanishingly rare few have discovered HQ by finding one of the Doors, such as the one in New Caledonia. You have to get past an SEP field and the DES to pull that one off, though.<br><br>Once they&#39;ve (presumably) gotten someone to explain what&#39;s going on and decided to stay in HQ, as Hieronymus Graubart (did I finally spell it right this time?) mentioned, they&#39;re sent to the Marquis de Sod to fill out paperwork and receive an official assignment. Sometimes they&#39;re given training, sometimes they&#39;re immediately sent to their new partner.<br><br>Badfic recruits sometimes do a stint in FicPsych before being sent to Personnel. It just depends on how boggled they are by their badfic and/or the transition from their previous life to HQ. There may be a bit of an existential crisis involved with finding out they were controlled to some degree by some kid with a keyboard. Also, they may lack certain life skills due to the poor start they were given by the badfic author. Note: This is not to suggest that badfic recruits experience a lot of ANGST and DRAMA. As with everything else in the PPC, the tone should generally be kept light.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It is pretty rare, now, huh? Funny how that happens. I did actually go with that for Agent Dawn, though (but she joined back in...2006 or 2007, I think, so I decided it worked.) I&#39;ve no idea how exactly she managed to apply, but she had some sort of interview with the Marquis and then basically got told &#39;it&#39;s your funeral&#39; and had her request to join the DMS approved. (She wasn&#39;t initially suited for the DMS, of course, but that&#39;s what you get when you&#39;ve just turned 14 and think Jay and Acacia have--or is it had, by that point?--really cool jobs. It worked out in the end, though, more or less.)<br><br>Another way that people end up as agents, of course, is that they&#39;ve grown up in the Nursery as the children or adopted children of one or more agents. That&#39;s exceedingly rare as well, though, as far as I&#39;m aware, but I think it&#39;s happened at least a few times...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>... it&#39;s rare because no-one writes it.

            <p>The challenge being to write an advert which could be run in the papers and bring in recruits to the (fictional) PPC. I don&#39;t have many ideas, but I&#39;ll start us off:<br><br><hr>
<br><b>NEEDED!</b><br><br>Active, enthusiastic fans of fiction to join large &amp; growing team. Meet new and interesting people (albeit not for very long). Must have eye for detail and be willing to push hard for correctness. Will work with highly advanced technology &amp; employ own initiative to achieve a shifting set of goals.<br><br><hr>
<br>Alternately, there&#39;s the &#39;sarcastic&#39; version.<br><br><hr>
<br>Wanted: &#39;assassins&#39; to join an &#39;organisation&#39; which &#39;travels into fiction&#39; to &#39;kill&#39; &#39;Mary-Sues&#39;. Must be &#39;trained&#39; with &#39;weapons&#39;, willing to work &#39;long hours&#39; for &#39;no&#39; pay, and not mind working for &#39;Flowers&#39;.<br><br><hr>
<br>Or, finally, the Filthy Stinking Lies version:<br><br><hr>
<br><b>Join the PPC!</b><br><br>We are an organisation dedicated to quality, committed to writing, devoted to our staff. Our pay rates are unlike any you&#39;ve seen, and out holiday plans are out of this world. Luxury on-site accomodations, innovative scheduling, and a pool that has to be seen to be believed!<br><br><hr>
<br>So... can anyone do an actually decent job of these? ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It really does depend on how the agent in question found their way to the PPC. Rina, for example, fell through a plot hole and asked to join after she learned about the PPC. She wanted the DMS, specifically, and since they&#39;re always in need of more agents, it wasn&#39;t a problem.<br><br>As for badfic-rescued characters, they&#39;d probably end up working in whatever department deals with the kind of badfic they came from (someone from a Suefic would join the DMS, someone from a bad slashfic would join the DBS, etc.)<br><br>In regards to tests... there isn&#39;t really one. If you survive your fist mission, you&#39;re good to go.<br><br>At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen so far. Of course, Agent Techno-Dann was a part of the civilian reporting force and was recruited via letter. Just go with whatever seems to best fit.</p>

            <p>Or it may be just the opposite. Someone from a bad slashfic joins <i>Misplaced Flora and Fauna</i>, hoping they will never see any bad slash again. Someone from a Suefic joins <i>Bad Slash</i>, hoping they will never meet a Sue again. And the Ironic Overpower is cackling in the background.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The Original Series and many spin-offs skip this and tell about agents who have already been in the PPC for some time, or begin with new agents trying to find their assigned RC, meeting their partner or getting the first mission.<br><br>But if you don’t want to skip it, there should probably be an &quot;interview&quot; with the Marquis the Sod, who needs to assign the Agents to a Department before they even know who their Department Head would be. Also, when bit characters are recruited in missions, there is often talk about taking or sending them to the Marquis or to the Department of Personnel in general, so this seems to be the point to start. I put the &quot;interview&quot; into quotation marks, because I’m not sure whether the Marquis would ask many questions or just send them to a Department that needs some more agents. He should consider their qualifications, but he doesn’t seem to enjoy the presence of agents, so he may just want to get rid of them as fast as possible. As so often, the advice is to do what is most funny. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I will keep that in mind. I thought it might be something like that, though. I&#39;m not entirely sure if I will actually show the interviews, but I might. It could make a difference, give possibilities to show character development and, of course, comedy. </p>

            <p>Welcome to the Board! I joined a few days ago, and also found the PPC via TV Tropes, although unlike you, I lurked on the wiki and the Original Series for about two weeks. As a fellow newbie, I give you best wishes!<br><br>I&#39;m glad that we share a few fandoms. Percy Jackson is one of my minor fandoms that I didn&#39;t include in my introductory post, for whatever reason. I also really love the Harry Potter series.<br><br>Logging in isn&#39;t necessary, by the way. You can just type in a name.<br><br>I bestow upon thee a large U-shaped pillow. It may or may not bite; I&#39;m not going to try to find out.</p>

            <p>One of my favorite puns (granted, they&#39;re all quite good, but this one was pretty memorable) from that series was the catastrophe.  I haven&#39;t read all of the books, but have read some- enough at any rate to know that the only known party able to grant a Magician-caliber talent would be the Demon Xanth, and there&#39;s no way that he&#39;d do that to the group of kids in the story mentioned.  Again... Grr.<br><br>Anyway, regarding gifts: what&#39;s customary?  I mean, am I supposed to come up with some for you guys?</p>

Just let us all crowd around and make you uncomfortable. Heh heh.<br><br>My mom has a fairly large collection of Xanth books, but I haven&#39;t read all of them either.

            <p>No point beating around the bush (even though it would be much less nerve wracking), so here you guys go. Hopefully I haven&#39;t done too badly with these guys.<br><br><br>Agent #1:<br>  Jack Bennet is a human guy from the “real world.” Any physical description of Jack must begin with the heavy facial scarring around his right eye. Jack has never explained to anyone how he got these scars, and has said that it just doesn’t matter. Jack is tall and lanky, with most of his height coming from his long legs. Jack spent a few years in the Department of Internal Affairs checking charge lists before requesting a transfer into an action department. As far as he saw, he “didn’t spend eight years getting a law degree so [he] could sit around and let other people get the bad guys.” Jack applied for a job in PPC in his junior year of law school, and seems to believe he was only recruited because they were running out of people willing to file paperwork. He stays in touch with his mother, and has told her about the PPC. She doesn’t seem to care, but has made him swear to a handful of deities that he would be careful not to get killed. This, and some foolish thing he calls self-preservation, and everyone else calls cowardice, mean that Jack prefers not to participate in combat, which is why he bothered to stick around in DIA for so long. Aside from a thorough understanding of court law, Jack has very few skills. He knows basic wilderness survival, but his days in the Boy Scouts didn’t exactly train him for ‘Sue hunting. Now, Jack is transferring into the Department of Floaters so he can do some work, and hopefully find someone besides his mother to talk to.<br><br>Agent #2:<br> Shawn O’Thomas is a twenty something (and not a day older) male human from a (nonexistent) badfic set in the DC continuum, specifically the Batman mythos. He’s lean somewhat short, a few inches shy of six feet. Shawn has obviously died bright red hair, and a penchant for wearing leather jackets and jeans, no matter the weather. Shawn was a bit character gang leader who died within two chapters of his fic. However, due to OOC circumstances regarding his death, when the canon snapped back, it undid Shawn’s demise. After that, Shawn joined up with the Floaters, hoping he could put his skills to use, and pick up some new tricks for when/if he gets back into the crime game. Shawn is a decent shot with handguns, as well as various blunt weapons. Gotham streets tend to teach you how to wield a pipe pretty well. On the other hand, Gotham also tends to warp your morals a bit. Shawn’s suggestions tend to be a bit more cruel than necessary, and the handful of things that anger him will turn him close to feral rather quickly. Shawn has, fortunately, realized this doesn’t exactly fall in line with the PPC’s ideals, and is acting to correct his behavior. On the bright side, killing ‘Sues is a pretty good way to vent aggression.<br><br>Control Prompt (One agent tells the other how they were recruited):<br>  “That went better than I expected.” Jack said as the portal from the most recent mission closed behind him.<br> “Still can’t believe she was supposed to be Jack&#39;s sister. She had to be like nineteen tops, right?” Shawn asked, flopping down onto his bed.<br> “Sues are weird sometimes, what’d you expect?” Jack asked, tossing his remote activator onto a desk before sitting down on his bed.<br>   “I guess you’re right.” Shawn said, digging through his backpack for a few moments before pulling out an apple.<br>   The room was quiet, save the sound of Shawn’s snacking, for a while before Jack spoke up, “Actually, and I’m being serious for once, what did you expect when you joined the PPC? I mean, I had a whole interview thing, but you kind of just got thrown into it.”<br>  “When I joined? I had no idea what the looney punks were talking about. Took me a few days to figure out I would still be able to put people six feet under.” Shawn said.<br>   “So, you just went with it? No suspicions or anything?” Jack asked.<br> “Hey, be fair. I just came back from the dead, so I was a little out of it.” Shawn said.<br>    “Whoa, you died? I heard you couldn’t keep a DC character down, but I always thought those were just jokes.” Jack said.<br>   “It wasn’t exactly normal circumstances.” Shawn said.<br> Jack got up and moved over to Shawn’s bed, “Well you can’t just bait me and not explain yourself.” He said, sitting next to his partner.<br>    “Alright, so I was a mob boss, right? And I’ve got this real small crew, just me and a couple other guys. Except, one of the guys is a Sue.” Shawn said.<br>  “You got killed by a Sue?” Jack asked with a huge grin.<br> “No, now don’t interrupt.” Shawn said.<br>    “I make no promises.” Jack said, leaning back against the wall.<br> “Can I continue? Good. Anyway, so this Sue and me are poking around the security office for this bank, gotta disable the cameras before the other guys can sneak in. Out of nowhere though, Nightwing, freaking Nightwing, smashes my head into the wall!” Shawn said, crushing his apple core against the wall.<br>    “Ouch.” Jack said, cringing.<br>    “You’re telling me. Snapped my neck. So, Bat wannabe brings the Sue in, and gets off with a warning from the big bad Bat. A warning. I got put in Arkham for killing a few guys, and he gets scolded?” Shawn ranted.<br>  “Sue influence, it does a body bad.” Jack said.<br> “Oh, it gets worse. See, the Sue was actually Nightwing’s sister, so she goes to a cell in the Bat Cave instead of prison. Then she falls in love with the new Robin, he falls for her, they live happily ever after.” Shawn said.<br>    “Somehow I think you missed the part where you come back from the dead.” Jack said.<br> “Oh yeah, that. So, some Agents come in and kill the Sue, right? Then canon puts itself back together, bird boy goes back to normal, nobody broke any moral codes, and so I never got killed in the first place.” Shawn said.<br>   “And the rest is history.” Jack said.<br>   “Pretty much. Agents said I could go with them or just sort of drift into the background. I don’t work in the background, so I took their offer.” Shawn said.<br> “Interesting. I don’t suppose you remember being dead? What hell is like, and all that stuff?” Jack asked.<br>    “Who says I didn&#39;t hit the pearly gates?” Shawn asked.<br>  “Seriously? You got killed while robbing a bank.” Jack said.<br>    “Yeah, well,” Shawn started. Just then, a loud beeeeeeeeeeeeeeep filled the room.<br>   “Saved by the bell.” Jack said, jumping up to check the console.<br>    “We aren’t through talking about this.” Shawn said, grabbing a few extra bullets off his desk and stuffing them in his pockets.<br>   “Whatever you say.” Jack said, “Now, how do you feel about killing aliens?”<br> “Let’s find out.” Shawn said.<br><br>Random Prompt (The agents discover what the new adaption has done to their beloved canon):<br>   “I just heard about the Superman/Batman movie. Don’t freak out. I’m sure it’ll be fine.” Jack said, bursting through the door of his RC.<br>  “I know right? I mean, everyone’s freaking out about it, but they did the same thing for Dark Knight when they cast Heath Ledger as Joker. I say we wait until we actually see the thing to decide if it’s good or not.” Shawn said.<br>    “Right, good, you’re taking it rather well. You’re referencing the Batfleck thing, right? Nothing else?” Jack asked.<br>    “What else is there to talk about?” Shawn asked. Just then, the console let out a bip.<br>  “I’ll get it!” Jack said, jumping at the console.<br> “Okay, you’re freaking me out. What is it?” Shawn asked, reading over his partner’s shoulder.<br>   ‘Attention Agents who work in, come from, or in any way have some relation to the DC Universe:<br>    We understand that you are not pleased with the fact that Wonder Woman will not be getting her own movie. We also understand that you do not like that she is Kryptonian now. We do not, however, think this means you may set fire to anything in headquarters. It has already happened no less than six times today, and we will be enforcing punishments on anyone else who attempts such things.<br>    Thank you for your time,<br>    Upstairs.’<br>    Shawn stood completely still, with his mouth hanging wide open, for a few moments. Jack took this opportunity to kick Shawn’s gun under the bed.<br>  “Kryptonian.” Shawn eventually said.<br>    “I’m sure they explain it very well.” Jack said, frantically looking around to make sure there were no sharp objects in sight.<br>    “It blew up! Everyone died! How are they going to explain it, exactly?” Shawn shouted.<br>  “Now, that’s a perfectly logical argument, but the comics already have,” Jack started before being cut off.<br>   “The comics say she’s an Amazon! A mythical warrior woman! Gifted by the gods! Does that mean Captain Marvel is a Kryptonian too?” Shawn shouted.<br> “Technically, his name is Shazam now.” Jack said.<br>   “Oh, don’t even get me started on that! What moron would name themselves after the phrase that takes their powers away? It’s like if Zatanna changed her name to Deh-id I.” Shawn said.<br> “I dye heads?” Jack asked.<br>  “It’s really hard to say consecutive vowels backward, okay?” Shawn said.<br>  “Hey, listen, why don’t we just head down to the general store, pick up something mind altering, and you can forget this ever happened?” Jack offered.<br>    “You know what? That’s not such a bad idea.” Shawn said, grinning.<br>    “Why are you smiling?” Jack asked.<br>  “I’m not smiling.” Shawn said, showing an unsettling number of teeth.<br> “You were going to injure me with the booze somehow, weren&#39;t you?” Jack asked.<br>  “No, of course not.” Shawn said.<br>    “It still counts if other people are injured too.” Jack said.<br>   “Oh, come on, it would only be one Molotov.” Shawn said.<br>    “Son of a, you know what? How about, instead of hitting the store, we sit here and play a nice, quiet game of Don’t Kill Anyone?” Jack offered.<br>   “But I really want to kill someone.” Shawn mumbled.<br> “And I’m alone in a room with you, that’s great. Gee, it sure would be a shame if we got a mission right now!” Jack shouted.<br>    “What are you doing?” Shawn asked.<br>  “I’m certainly not tempting fate. You’d have to be an idiot to want a mission right now!” Jack shouted.<br> “It’s not going to work.” Shawn said.<br> “By the Hat, what do you want from me?” Jack shouted to the ceiling.<br>    “You know, since you’re busy, I think I’m gonna hit that general store.” Shawn said, leaving the RC quickly. A mere five seconds after he left, a beeeeeeeeep filled the room.<br>  “I really hate that guy sometimes.” Jack said to no one in particular.<br><br>And, if all goes well, I&#39;ll be sporking Grox and Kisses (<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6398344/1/Grox-and-Kisses"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6398344/1/Grox-and-Kisses">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6398344/1/Grox-and-Kisses</a></a>) from our very own List of Unclaimed Badfic.<br><br>So there we go.

            <p>Well, let&#39;s start at the top.<br><br>Jack:  I like this guy.  He knows the fine art of cowardice, and that can only help him.  I think you did an excellent job of telling us who he is in this blurb.  The relationship with his mother, the Boy Scout training, the belief that they only wanted him for his paperwork; all of that is really nice.  I imagine the facial scars are going to be a revelation later, which can be a little cliched if done poorly, so just be aware of that.<br><br>Shawn:  I don&#39;t know why, but I read this guy as a 80&#39;s-90&#39;s British Punk-rocker, which might be why I picture him with a mohawk or liberty spikes (note: This is not a bad thing.  It is an interesting image.).  That aside, his backstory explains his choice of weapons and his particular moral structure.  I do worry about him being &quot;more cruel than necessary,&quot; but at least you seem to already be aware of that being a potential problem.  Just keep an eye on that.<br><br>Control Prompt:  You used the name Jack for the canon character, which was a problem since we got no last name and you have a character named Jack speaking.  Muddied things a bit at the beginning.  I like the dynamic between the two here.  It makes Jack seem caring and Shawn seem violent without being over the top about it.<br><br>Random Prompt:  This, I think, is the stronger of the two short stories.  It reverses, but still, reinforces the dynamic from the first story.  It starts with Shawn being the calm one who is freaked out by Jack, which is nice to see.  There are several moments that I think work particularly well.  Jack kicking the gun under the bed, for instance, perfectly suits the character.  I also really like the ending.  The whole thing of actively tempting fate/the Ironic Overpower/the Laws of Narrative Comedy was well done.  Also, the Molotov Cocktail did not help dissuade me from seeing Shawn as a Punk-rocker.<br><br>The Badfic:  No idea, honestly.  I don&#39;t know anything about Spore.  I am, however, fairly certain that no one named Amy Marks could possibly be the Empress of anything called the Groxian Empire.  The names just don&#39;t fit.<br><br>Verdict:  Permission Granted.  Happy hunting.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Drat, I was wanting that fic. It&#39;s got so much improbability and awfulness in it. It&#39;s going to take a while to find another fic on the caliber of &quot;giving a religious figure to a group of omnicidal cyborgs and giving said figure the power to turn other species into Grox&quot;. That&#39;s not even counting taking the entire species so out-of-character that not only could they not touch the real Grox persona with a mile-long pole, they <i>can survive on Earthlike planets with no ill effect</i>. I suppose that&#39;s what I get for holding back on my fic claims.<br><br>Hey, if there&#39;s a spot in there that would let you recruit one or two of those oxygen-breathing Grox, try to see if you can do so. It could be interesting having a few of them around, and if not, you&#39;d have to wipe them out anyway. The whole subspecies is going to be incapable of assimilating into canon, seeing the way all spaceborne species react to Grox. Even one of the 80,000 fan-made Grox cosplay races will hate you if you so much as make a mutual-not-killing-each-other agreement with them. Don&#39;t recruit Grox Captain Kirk, though; he&#39;s a Stu in his own right, and even if he wasn&#39;t, he&#39;s too entwined with the Sue to be dealt with in anything less than a fatal aiding and abetting charge.</p>

Her powers are that she can draw recognizably, has a freakish memory for things she has put the effort into noticing and memorizing, (notably the canon events of the five games,) and her presence in a particular world causes the rules about Destiny to go haywire.<br><br>Since then, she has become an ordinary vampire sired by Janos Audron.  When working in other incarnations of that universe, she will lie and say she is Vorador&#39;s childe instead of his much younger sister. (She is about equal to Umah and the traitors.)<br><br>She is old enough to tolerate sunlight, but prefers to avoid it.  She is very sensitive to water, blessed or not, but does not have issue with religious places or symbols.  She is mildly telekinetic, as in a weapon isn&#39;t out-of-reach until it&#39;s a yard away, and she can draw blood into her mouth from body at about three yards.  I haven&#39;t decided what her unique &quot;Dark Gift&quot; would be, but it is not combat-related.  She will need training in non-lethal unarmed combat and how to use weapons offensively.<br><br>She would seem a little sociopathic and aloof.  She hasn&#39;t interacted with humans as equals for centuries, so will take time for her mannerisms around them to seem natural. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m thinking about making my agent&#39;s joining of the PPC be that she came through my forth-wall-aware Self-Insert-<br>Authoress-Tripe.  Agents come in with a charge-list a mile long, my avatar and the character replacements work to convince them that containing the badness in a blatant AU is useful, and that I could just create another world and clog up the continuity.  Basically it would part of the Tripe universe because of the first-person of my avatar, but I would request a beta from a PPC member even if it isn&#39;t canon to this group.<br><br>My agent is a Sue that was handed over as a consolation prize.

It might be that most return emails get lost because of censoring.<br><br>I&#39;d like to give her a binder full of things about the video game that she wouldn&#39;t have looked up before getting sucked into it.  Q&amp;A with the developers, information about cancelled games, and research into deleted content, mostly.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m interpreting the backstory here as: PPC Agents go into a Suefic, charge a Sue, and then the author of the original badfic intervenes, rewriting the badfic as an AU to put the Agents sent to kill it off of their jurisdiction and sending one of the characters from the original story into the PPC, giving that emissary a mobile phone to report to the author&#39;s avatar about other Sues and... her reactions to them?<br>Is this what you were going for?  There was also something about video games, which didn&#39;t really fit into the rest, unless Tripe is a video game and also the continuum that the ex-Sue would come from.<br><br>I can&#39;t comment on the backstory as whole, because I&#39;m not sure if I got it right, but here&#39;s a few comments on the parts that are indisputably part of it:<br>Just because a badfic is an AU doesn&#39;t mean that it can&#39;t be sporked and can&#39;t be targeted for destruction. There&#39;s a Department of Improbable AUs that gets rid of those. It isn&#39;t as popular among the Boarders as the other Action Departments are, so it&#39;s not mentioned often, but if a badfic was classified as a Suefic and turned into or turned out to be an AU fic, it would be treated more or less the same, except the DMS Agents would need to be replaced with or joined by DIAU Agents. You said the Sue was given to the PPC to become an Agent as a &quot;consolation prize&quot;, so I&#39;m not sure if that means that she was created by the author avatar to placate the PPC and convince them not to follow her, or as a recruit from the new AU, or if the Sue was the protagonist of the original Suefic given over to PPC custody to show good faith, or what exactly is going on there.<br><br>An author avatar doesn&#39;t usually interact with the PPC to defend their Sue. I don&#39;t know if the author is usually in-universe aware that the PPC are in their story at all, since we try our hardest not to show the out-of-universe versions our sporking lists, and <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc1110/01smasher.html">in the one exception I could find</a>, the author avatar was so upset with his Stu self-insert that he killed it himself. Would there be any particular reason for your exception here?</p>

If an effortless Q is a full author, my avatar from Self-Insert-Authoress-Tripe is pretending to be dependent on a training machine like Trelane.

(If someone wants an easy bad-fic, their submission to LOK had nothing to do with the category.)<br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>The PPC and ACMSES communities have actually interacted before, and common consensus if I recall right is that they&#39;re mutually non-canonical - the ACMSES doesn&#39;t exist in PPC-verse, and vice versa. I could be wrong though.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll go ahead and give your questions a shot.<br><br>I don&#39;t think there are any missions in Legacy of Kain. We&#39;re a multi-fandom organization, but there are many, many fandoms without any missions for them at all. Heck, even major fandoms like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are not represented at all. However, there is a way to fix this: write one yourself! However to do that, you need permission. If you are not familiar with the permission process... Actually, I&#39;d wait a bit to familiarize yourself. We&#39;re <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=258051;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">in the middle of changing it, you see.</a><br><br>Painless way to use the Board? Nothing more then what you probably already know. You can use HTML tags in posts, to <b>bold,</b> <i>italicize,</i> <s>strike through,</s> and much more. Other then that, either make sure you&#39;re logged in or enter your username every time you post. Funnily enough, just entering it manually each time is, in a way, easier. The log-in feature is a little buggy at times. Just so you know.<br><br>Oh, thank goodness. The paperwork is really quite extensive, utterly massive it is. Normally, the Spies just write up a basic report that can usually be boiled down into OH GOD WHY, and sent to Agents to be killed. However, with a particular Time Lord agent insisting on all paperwork being filled and filed properly, we have to do things proper. Now, if you get started on filling out form MST-3k, I can wrap up with R1-ff and SP0-rk.<br><br>However, before you get started with that, I have to give you a gift! It&#39;s a thing we do around here, don&#39;t question it. Anyway, I give you: an enchanted quill! This quill writes down what you say aloud, with flawless spelling and grammar. However, if you want to break a law of grammar for stylistic effect, the quill has some trouble writing that down. It can, it just won&#39;t be happy about it. Now, why don&#39;t you test out that quill on these files, hmm?</p>

            <p>Well, not the Nuzlocke challenge, because I would not be able to handle having a load of effort put into a Pokémon that I&#39;d have to perma-box when something goes wrong. But normally when I play a Pokémon game, I link it to all of the other ones I&#39;ve played: no training something too high if there&#39;s already a fully-trained member of that species on another version, take advantage of trading as much as possible even and especially when it could provide low-leveled versions of powerful Pokémon early on, and other various little guidelines of that sort. I&#39;ve not actually just played through the game, picked up whatever I think looks good, and based my team around what I liked instead of coverages and typeadvantages, since back when I first got Ruby Version in 2003. Well, my Diamond Version sort of followed Ruby&#39;s pattern, but my Diamond Version was pretty haphazard in general and I had to share it with my brother for a while(he traded away my Entei over Wi-Fi!), so it doesn&#39;t really count.<br><br>I was considering buying SoulSilver from someplace to set my new isolationist file in, since the only region&#39;s story I&#39;m unfamiliar with is Johto&#39;s,  but after the Hoenn remake announcement a few days back I&#39;m tempted to just wait for AlphaSapphire to roll around. I&#39;ll probably just pick up SoulSilver, though. Gap-filling is always nice, and since it&#39;s been out for years it&#39;ll probably be at a low price somewhere, not to mention the fact that places will have more of them in stock since the hardcore supporters will have already bought their copies years ago. I swear I saw a HeartGold Version at a Barnes &amp; Noble once, and if you&#39;ll be able to pick up the game at a bookstore, imagine how easy they&#39;ll be to find at a regular store! Yes, i know that&#39;s faulty logic, but I&#39;m holding out hope that it won&#39;t be the other way around and the stores all just decided not to restock the games after X and Y came out.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not exam season for me (army and all that) but it <i>is</i> Independence Day here. And, well, lotsa weirdness happened:<br>1) I met a group of Dutch students.

            <p>Well, you came to the right place with that little tale.<br><br>In similar vein, I&#39;d like PPCers more experienced than myself to take on an old shame of my own.

            <p>I got to the mushrooms before making some snap judgements.

            <p>I appreciate that, thanks for giving my little abomination a look. This is almost a ten year old story of mine that I posted out of (a misguided) hope of revising it into something suitable. I&#39;ve long since given up on it and want to see it die a fitting (preferably funny) death.  Its amazing what reading the Silmarillion can do to a persons perception on their fanfics. <br><br>I&#39;ll save you the trouble and describe my Sue (from what I remember, its been a while). Shes a tenth-walker, throws the cannon&#39;s (particularly Galadriel and Boromir) FAR out of character, has a terrible past, unusual appearance, falls in love with Legolas, created by Sauron (somehow), a made up race, and I can go on.    <br><br>But the point is, spork away! Just be sure to send me the link. :)  </p>

            <p>Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself.  There are some good ideas buried in the mix.<br><br>I love the way the story keeps twisting between books and movieverse near the start, and even has both Arwen and Glorfindel turning up for the Flight to the Ford.  It&#39;s like the universe is trying all different combinations of itself to see where your Sue fits in.  (Then when she finally reveals her origins, the universe just stops caring and reverts to pure movieverse.)<br></p>

            <p>Reading a bit more, as far as Lothlorien, there&#39;s a a lot of fun metatextual stuff going on in the background of the story.<br><br>Your inner writer wants to create a fully-rounded, complex, three-dimensional character while Neveil just wants to be a Sue inserting herself into the movie for the sake of it.  This is a sort-of reversed mirror-image of what happens in-universe, with Sauron creating what was supposed to be a one-dimensional projection of his will, a mockery of a real person, only for someone (presumably Eru?) granting her a soul and giving her the freedom to develop as a character.<br><br>This first comes to a head on Caradhras during that flashback to the Rivendell stables.  It&#39;s a nice, non-movie scene to showcase the more complex non-Sueish aspects of the Neviel&#39;s character.  And she responds by breaking the fourth wall and attacking you for including a non-Sue scene.<br><br>However, you&#39;re not going to let a Sue win that easily.  You turn your attention to Boromir.  While Neveil has been mechanically going through the motions of lusting after Legolas because that&#39;s what Sue&#39;s are supposed to do, your inner writer seems to have a genuine soft spot for Boromir.<br><br>Up to now, this affection has shown itself by trying to hide the Sue&#39;s Designated Misogynist Bastard!Boromir behind large yellow Post-It notes saying, &quot;AN: Not a misogynist but a tragic hero, honest!&quot;  But now you get the radical idea of actually writing him like a tragic hero instead of a misogynist.  By the time the Fellowship arrives at the gates of Moria, Boromir is getting back to something like his in-character canon self.<br><br>How does the Sue respond to his developing and reacting in ways she hadn&#39;t expected?  She literally punches him in the face!<br><br>So, I&#39;m actually enjoying this story, but for all the wrong reasons.  It&#39;s trying so hard to redeem the Sue, and she&#39;s trying so hard to resist it.  I want to keep on reading and see which one wins.<br></p>

            <p>I personal do have a huge soft spot for Boromir, I would even go as far to say he is my lust-object. The way I portrayed him all that time ago is part of the reason I&#39;m embarrassed of this tale. I went into this story with an idea of doing Boromir justice as a character but I guess it got tainted by all the suefics I had been reading at the time. Very astute of you to pick up on that. <br><br>I think that if Neveil were not a tenth-walker, I wrote her today, and she had a better integrated back-story, she could be a pretty decent character.  <br><br>....and my authors notes.....don&#39;t judge me to harshly, I was just a hormonal teenager. If there is anything in there that I REALLY hate, its my authors notes. They reek of an immature teen writer.<br><br>On a final note, I&#39;m glad you are getting some enjoyment out of this, and your positive points certainly made me smile. :)  </p>

            <p>So, I was writing in my notes, trying to think of some good humor for my PPC missions that I could stash away and use later, and I began to drift off on a tangent. I began thinking of &quot;Yo mama&quot; jokes, but then it came to me. I need to have one or more of my agents give some epic Mary Sue insults.<br><br>Here is what I came up with so far.<br><br>1. &quot;You&#39;re such a Mary Sue, you think &#39;conflict&#39; is a type of cereal.&quot;<br>2. &quot;You&#39;re such a Mary Sue, you bathe in the drool of canon characters.&quot;<br>3. &quot;You&#39;re such a Mary Sue, you should grow a few more heads to hold all that impossible forbidden knowledge.&quot;<br>4. &quot;You&#39;re such a Mary Sue, your mother says &#39;thank you&#39; when you call her fat.&quot;<br>5. &quot;You&#39;re such a Mary Sue, there are no words for it. You know why? Because they all went into describing your face and your anorexia.&quot;<br><br>Can anyone else think of any more?</p>

Forget bacon and raw eggs, this bad boy eats live pig and screaming fangirls. (Unfortunately, as Titans don&#39;t have a digestive tract...yeah.)<br><br>The main issue here is the various different ways of spelling character names in English; Hanji(Hange), Yeager(Jaeger), Levi(Rivaille), and Krista(Christa), for example. How do we determine whether a certain spelling is just the author&#39;s preferred transliteration or an actual error? If someone misspells a Titan Shifter&#39;s name, are we gonna have to deal with a mini-Abnormal?<br><br>On a lesser note, I think it&#39;d be kind of funny if mini-Titans came in different sizes to reflect their canon counterparts. (more flagrant/bizarre misspelling = bigger mini-Titan) How this would work given that most minis are about three feet tall and Titans are measured using meters is for someone with more patience than me to calculate.<br><br>What say you all?

            <p>I basically tend to look for an &quot;official&quot; spelling too, and would accept any version with &quot;official&quot; usage (for example, Kyubey from Madoka Magica can be romanized also as Kyubei or Kyuubey, and Kyoko as Kyouko, so I tend to accept those. Things like Kubei or Kyuko are minis instead).<br><br>I also tend to ignore any re-naming the official dubs do - for example, one of &quot;my&quot; series is Cardcaptor Sakura, and the two dubs I know (Italian and American) both use different names.<br><br>Using the Japanese ones is the only way to keep things neat - some of my readers know one character as Yuki and some as Julian. However, while they might not be aware of the other dub version of the name, they&#39;re all very likely to know that the character&#39;s original name is Yukito.</p>

            <p>I mean, we&#39;d hope that at least one of them has some form of training - I can&#39;t think of any instances off the top of my head of two people wandering into HQ and being sent straight out on a mission - but partnering two agents with no experience happens all the time. From the Flowers&#39; viewpoint, it makes sense: the agents already know they&#39;re not all that concerned for them, and training newbies takes more work than just giving them, ah, &#39;on-the-job&#39; training.<br><br>Of course, where circumstances allow, they&#39;ll stick a newbie with someone who&#39;s actually been out before - but the Flowers <i>really</i> don&#39;t like breaking up partnerships, so that relies on an agent dying, going mad, or, technically, retiring. And they don&#39;t do that on schedule. The &#39;intern&#39;-style training is occasional but not, as far as I know, common.<br><br>hS</p>

<li>Nope. In many cases, PPCing the entire fic would be a terrible idea. You only need to carry it long enough to a) collect sufficient charges and b) come to a good spot for the agents to act. It&#39;s not uncommon for the agents to have enough charges, but wait until they can get the Sue or possessed character or whatever into a more convenient position to take them down. Also, there may be an even greater canon breach that you&#39;ll want to include even if the mission could technically be ended earlier. The risk is that the longer it goes, the harder it gets to maintain a good pace and keep things interesting.<br><br>2. No, you don&#39;t have to do both, and I expect you don&#39;t have to start with the first one if it&#39;s decent but the sequel sucks. You certainly can, though. <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc1110/03abwos.html">My latest DMS mission</a> covered two fics, the first of which was very flawed, but not god-awful, and its sequel, which is what got the OC killed. (It wasn&#39;t the best-received of my missions, though, so take that for what it&#39;s worth.)<br><br>3. You could probably handle that more or less the same way as a regular sequel, but I don&#39;t think it has ever come up before. The world is your bivalve mollusc!<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>It&#39;s called the Sub-Department of Rare Fandoms, composed of a loosely-knitted bunch of pseudo-divisions from fandoms too small or too little-known to have dedicated presence in, such as MacGyver and A Series of Unfortunate Events. Nominally, it&#39;s attached to the DMS, but in practice, it seems to be more like Floaters in execution, possibly because it would be easier to send what little badfic those obscure fandoms get to them even when there&#39;s not strictly any Suvian presence. One of the Agents written for the SDRF had three out of his five recorded missions be non-Suvian.<br><br>I don&#39;t think Gargoyles would be classified as a rare fandom, though. It was a fairly popular show in its day, and even now is still influential and well-remembered. It&#39;s probably got loads of fanfiction, but some of it wasn&#39;t bad enough to attract the attention of the Boarders and some of it just either didn&#39;t merit missions or never had any missions written about it.<br><br>Oh, and by the way, an agent pair is going to be in the same Division of the same Department for as long as they&#39;re partnered. That&#39;s why they&#39;re, you know, partners. It&#39;s not unheard of that an agent pair would cooperate with a group of agents from another department so frequently that they are practically a combined team unit(see Miah&#39;s and Caddy-shack&#39;s agents for an example of this), but it&#39;s not an official arrangement. Maybe you didn&#39;t mean that, but from what I read, you implied that one of your agents would be a Floater and their partner would work for another department entirely, and the PPC doesn&#39;t work like that.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not entirely dependent on how popular the show was when it was on, or even how many fanfics it has. When the first missions for Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis came out by Indemaat, the fandom was rare within the PPC, even though it was in the top 10 for the TV show fanfics of FFnet.

            <p>There&#39;s nothing against anyone being transferred somewhere else, and not even any criteria for where they&#39;d go aside from fandoms and authorial decision, as far as I&#39;m aware. An agent would just need to work in the same place as their partner at any given time, and if they didn&#39;t, they&#39;d be given a new one.<br><br>Well, I suppose in the out-of-universe sense, the criteria that gets a fandom classified as part of the SDRF would be entirely up to the mission writers. At this point, DMS Stargate is covered by the Sci-Fi and Steampunk Division, but that&#39;s only after a few Boarders decided that it was a big enough deal to move it.

I&#39;ve been pretty busy the last few weeks, and it sort of slipped my mind until recently. I&#39;ll get back to it as soon as I can.</p>

            <p>... can be answered by the first, unspoken one: &#39;Where do I find PPC fics?&#39; There are two answers:<br><br><a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">This is The Original Series</a>. This is where it all started. It&#39;s one of the three links at the top of the Board, and it&#39;s really a good idea to read them.<br><br>More generally, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Killed_Badfic">the Killed Badfic list</a> is probably the best place to look. Each mission is sorted by the fandom the fic was from, so you can prioritise. If you find an agent or department you really like, look them up on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction">the Complete List of PPC Fiction</a> to find the rest of their adventures.<br><br>And since other people have covered your other questions, I&#39;ll leave it there.<br><br>hS</p>

<li>Yes.<br>2. Agents can have powers; Agent Cali Still, for example, dropped in from the movie <u>Mystery Men</u>, and the Continuity Council is entirely Time Lord Agents. You don&#39;t want to make them overpowered, though. (Read the Guide for Newbies)<br>3. A mini is a small version of a canonical monster created when an author misspells a character&#39;s name. As far as I can tell they cause chaos while in their fic and comedy relief in HQ/Official Fanfiction Universities.<br>4. Generally at least one of the agents is familiar with the canon being warped, and the mission report provides a brief description of the fic. I have seen research occur on a mission, though.<br>5. I have no idea. Sorry!</li>

            <p>I imagine the Powerpuff Girls agents would have all of the powers that come from exposure to Chemical X. That is a very large number of powers for a PPC agent to have, so it wouldn&#39;t make it very challenging for them to defeat a Sue. They could just be near-invincible at it until they got close enough to hit it with their ice breath.<br>Agents of any given species or distinction have all of the powers that that species or distinction would normally possess, with extrapolations for changes that can occur within their home continuum(a member of a magically capable species being raised as a wizard), or something that only occurs once they enter the PPC(an agent from a non-supernatural universe beheads a Gil&#39;s All-Fright Diner-verse werewolf and as such is transformed into a werewolf themselves), but there are no powers that are given just for being a PPC agent. They can generate portals through the use of their Remote Activators, but that&#39;s not really a power.<br><br>You can find all currently available PPC stories linked somewhere <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">on the wiki</a>. Some of the links might not work, because some stories have been deleted or made inaccessible, but most of them are there.<br><br>World One is... sooort of the &quot;real world&quot;. In simple terms, it&#39;s the equivalent of our world as it exists in the PPC multiverse. Self-inserts of Boarders are native to World One, World One experiences all of the same social events and intakes all of the same media that our world does, and it has all of the overall tells of the &quot;real world&quot;, but World One contains doors into Headquarters, a few retired PPC agents living in seclusion, and a PPC-colonized city in France run by a Flower version of one of the plants from Myst, among other things. It&#39;s not the same place, but it&#39;s the &quot;real world&quot; for PPC story purposes.<br><br>A mini behaves differently depending on its species. Most of them are somewhere between animal intelligence and full-on sapience, with a few even having the ability to speak. Most minis enjoy causing trouble and eating raw meat, most famously bacon.<br><br>The Department of Intelligence goes into the fic beforehand, scouts out potential dangers, and sends a summary of the events to the RC of those who are going to clean it up, with notes on particular canon breaks, potential dangers, and the categories that the badfic falls under. It doesn&#39;t tell them everything, of course; that would ruin the fun!<br><br>When you try to exorcise a character replacement, nothing happens to it. Well, it gets mad at you, but it isn&#39;t depowered or anything. Still, that&#39;s better than assuming a canon character was replaced and then killing them when they were only possessed. You would get in the worst sort of trouble for making Medical need to take out their resurrection equipment again.</p>

            <p>The &#39;PPC universe&#39; is really a sort of jigsaw of all the other universes - a single corridor in HQ might contain tunnels in Middle-earth, Hogwarts, and the Citadel of the Time Lords. It&#39;s all coated in Generic Surface anyway, so it doesn&#39;t matter what world you&#39;re in. ;)<br><br>But by long tradition, magic works anywhere in the multiverse. So a Harry Potter native can (unless I&#39;m mistaken) cast spells in Middle-earth (though they probably shouldn&#39;t; they&#39;ll get told off). And so on.<br><br>Of course, a lot of magic systems require an inborn aptitude for it. So a Real World human couldn&#39;t become a Potterverse wizard, say, or a Jedi - the magic/Force aptitudes don&#39;t exist in her world, and they can&#39;t be learnt.<br><br>But a magic system that doesn&#39;t rely on aptitude, or where the aptitude can be induced? Yes, those can be learnt. Just like a Middle-earth agent can learn to use a gun, even though they don&#39;t exist back home. It&#39;s just a tool that isn&#39;t normally available to them, basically.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, since I got to the end of Homestuck, I&#39;ve been surfing around checking out the fanfic, fan art, etcetera, and I have come to the conclusion that there is a need for a Homestuck OFU.<br><br>Now I&#39;m aware that permission of any sort is not really required for this sort of thing, but I wanted to make certain of a few things so I wouldn&#39;t do something I&#39;d regret. The first being that I want to make sure I&#39;m not usurping anyone else&#39;s plans. I checked several lists and ran a search and I didn&#39;t find one, but I wanted to make sure no one else was working on one, and this seemed like the place to ask.<br><br>The second thing: the minis. I haven&#39;t found any references to Homestuck minis anywhere, but once again, I wanted to make sure. Also, just an opinion request: I was thinking mini-horrorterrors. What does everyone think of that? I also considered mini-Becs, mini-Gl&#39;bgolybs, and mini-frogs, but I think I like mini-horrorterrors the best.<br><br>If everything&#39;s looking good, then I have one more thing to ask. I&#39;m going to want a beta or co-writer for this; perhaps more than one. Preferably someone who&#39;s read more slash than I have and knows the ups and downs in that department. Also preferably someone who does not ship Karkat/Terezi, as I&#39;d like a counterbalance to my prejudice in that area.<br><br>I guess that&#39;s it. Here, have a list of some classes and their instructors I thought up.<br><br>Troll Romance 101 - Karkat Vantas<br>The Hemospectrum 050 - Equius Zahhak<br>Sexual Orientation 146 - John Egbert and Dirk Strider<br>typing qUirks 200 - Calliope<br><br>Okay, it&#39;s currently quite late. I&#39;ll probably wake up regretting this tomorrow. If that&#39;s the case, I apologize. Have a nice night/day.</p>

            <p>Can we put the fanbrats through military training so they can see exactly how hard it <i>really</i> is?

            <p>Argh I want to help but I am already doing like six things at once and doing any more would mean some of them would drop in quality bluh bluh<br>I don&#39;t know much about slash anyway. I have read a fair amount of troll romance fic, so I&#39;m pretty good at telling the good from the bad there, but not slash.<br>Wait, does shipping any of the trolls count as slash? Their different biology and culture might make that mean something different to them. Also, they are, in some interpretations,  all biologically male in the way humans understand it, since the Mother Grub is the one responsible for the development and gestation of the troll grubs, so maybe shipping any of the trolls at all would always count as slash? Homestuck is making me challenge the definitions of words.<br><br>That looks like a good mini species. I had been batting a few ideas around for a while, but none really worked, and I&#39;d never even thought of mini-Horrorterrors. The closest I&#39;d thought of were mini-Giclopses, which might also work, but they&#39;re pretty close to the standard vein.<br><br>I want to see Equius teaching his class now.<br><br>CT: D--&gt; So as you know, the hemospectrum is a sacred part of our culture.

Maybe as two classes, one for assigning based on personality and one for creation of fanmade classes and when doing so is and is not appropriate. They can maybe be the same category but with different numbers. The two versions of Aradia should probably teach the personality-based class, since she has personal experience regarding how an aspect and title can be relevant to multiple individuals or relevant even after personal development, since robo-Aradia and god tier-Aradia interpret their classpect different ways after their resurrection and even before the resurrection knew what it was all about.<br>I don&#39;t know who&#39;d teach the other one, though. Nepeta? Nepeta should teach something about fan-created content, especially since Karkat is already teaching the class that would cover shipping. Maybe her class could be right next door to his, so that they can surprise-guest-lecture one another!</p>

            <p>Do you mind if I use that segment with Equius? It is just a bit OOC, but I&#39;m sure it can be fixed.<br><br>Well, don&#39;t overtax yourself. Depending on when you have more time you may be able to help after all. I&#39;m not gonna start posting this right away.

            <p>It&#39;s a subject that would&#39;ve eventually come up anyway, after all! It&#39;s important that the little fanwriters get some guidelines on how to decide troll blood color. I&#39;ve seen too many trolls who declare that they&#39;re silver-blooded or black-blooded or something. Deciding to use a different shade of brown from canon or to add in the implied orange blood is very different from deciding to give something rainbow blood. Actually, rainbow blood wouldn&#39;t only be painful for the reader; since rainbow blood would mean that the various chemicals giving the blood its various colors are not mixing, that would more likely than not kill the troll within its first few hours of life.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ve managed to pin down one of the main OOC points in that Equius piece: He didn&#39;t spell &quot;paradox&quot; with a %! I forgot that part of his typing quirk. I wonder how he pronounces that in speech. We know the typing quirks do manifest in speech somehow, since Sollux 2peak2 wiith a biit of a lii2p and Eridan has a wwavy soundin accent, but a % isn&#39;t exactly obvious. You pronounce the % in Karrank% as a double glottal stop, but that wouldn&#39;t really work as part of words with the x in the middle. Would it?<br><br>Good! I have no OFU-writing experience, but it seems like taking extra time and effort to keep things in order are very important for a project like this, since the OFU cast of characters being fluid means it would probably be difficult to put a story in the right direction otherwise. I hope that&#39;s why we&#39;ve gone so long without a new OFAS update, because of planning. If it&#39;s because it&#39;s gone the way of most of the other OFUs and vanished halfway in, then that would just be depressing.<br><br>Well, the definition of gender is pretty much the same even if the trolls fill the biologically male role in their species, since the two aren&#39;t the same thing. The other two seem to be relatively valid challenges, though. Of course, Homestuck&#39;s been challenging the definition of shipping ever since it introduced the ashen, pale, and black romances.<br>I like to see when an ashen fic is done well. It&#39;s difficult to keep the dynamic properly without it degrading into something that would more easily match with a three-person moirallegiance, but it&#39;s great when done properly. On a related note, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1g-B8BJzwc">I definitely ashenship these three</a>.<br><br>Hmm. I don&#39;t know about having Nepeta&#39;s class being only available when students have already taken all of those other classes. Shipping is kind of a big deal in the Homestuck fandom, and if there&#39;s going to be a primary shipping class, it should be covered fairly early on. Maybe the shipping course will need to be taken alongside Dirk and John&#39;s and Karkat&#39;s, to ensure best effects and to make sure that no one is missing important components. Aranea&#39;s class can be <i>linked</i> to that, but I doubt it would work as a requirement, because come on, people are not going to go to a class taught by Aranea for reasons other than being able to speak freely amongst themselves while she goes on and on about whatever she&#39;s been given free reign to exposit on. Also, we don&#39;t know that much about leprechauns in general, so there might not be enough material to make a class. We don&#39;t even know what the majority of their nine romance symbols mean. On the plus side, this means there can be plenty of student-planning shenanigans. And Caliborn should just in general not be allowed near children unsupervised.</p>

            <p>Okay, leprechaun romance is incredibly rare, at least from what I&#39;ve seen. But I&#39;ve never seen anyone successfully manage to follow what guidelines we do have on it. Perhaps the leprechaun romance and cherub romance could be combined into one seminar? I understand your reservations on having Aranea and Caliborn teach anything. Who would listen to Aranea and Caliborn is just... Caliborn. But who else is there for the job? John, I suppose, or Vriska, since they were there and listening when Aranea explained this. Or maybe one of the leprechauns? I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be able to express their personalities correctly in such a situation.<br><br>You&#39;re right about Caliborn. I&#39;m definitely reconsidering having him teach anything. Even though the fanbrats would be getting all they deserved and resurrection is a thing that exists both in the OFU-verse and the Homestuck-verse. And it would be really funny.<br><br>Do you think I could have Karkitty as a mini-horrorterror? I&#39;m pretty sure nobody ever called him that in canon, not even Nepeta.<br><br>That&#39;s a good point with the rainbow blood... I&#39;m pretty sure they don&#39;t think these things through. I just read <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1567631">a story</a> in which Dave gets Karkat pregnant, then Karkat proceeds to <i>lay eggs</i> and is apparently still pregnant after the eggs are laid. No one was concerned enough to try to figure out why Karkat was extra large in the belly until he went into labor. It&#39;s one of those things where you look at it and it&#39;s like, &quot;Did you even think about this before you wrote it?&quot; No. No you didn&#39;t. They never do. :(<br><br>And that one made more sense than others I&#39;ve seen.<br><br>(To the writer&#39;s credit, there was plenty of WhatThe going around amongst the characters while the egg laying was happening. Even though the fact that Karkat <i> just laid some eggs</i> took second seat to who the other parent was once it was done.)<br><br>I think if Equius were to pronounce his words that way it would be a little hard to understand him - and pretty hard for him to talk, though I suppose he&#39;d be used to it. He might just pronounce it like an X, I suppose, although that seems a tad pedestrian.<br><br>That&#39;s another reason I want to wait on this. I don&#39;t want to end halfway through like a lot of OFUs have. That would be a bad thing. And of course there needs to be character growth on the part of the fan writer whose escapades I follow in particular, and the students in general. And of course this character growth needs to be believable.<br><br>I definitely enjoy reading good fanfic in the other three quadrants (although I think even the red quadrant isn&#39;t quite what we traditionally think of as romance). But it&#39;s hard to find the good stuff. Moirallegiance can be found in plenty, but people have so much trouble with the other two.<br><br>I haven&#39;t seen <i>The Avengers</i> yet. :( But I can definitely see the dynamic in that video. It&#39;s fun to take the quadrants and apply it to other stories, isn&#39;t it?<br><br>My parents are suddenly really freaked out that I know what juggalos are and want to know where I&#39;ve been frequenting on the internet. This is not how I envisioned explaining Homestuck to them...</p>

            <p>PG&#39;s, may I have your attention please?<br><br><br>I believe that I have worked out everything I need, so here are my agents&#39; profiles. I expect this to be rather long, so I will divide this up into two posts- one for the profiles, another for the control prompt and the random prompt. The second post will be in the very first response to this one.<br><br><br>So without further ado, here are the works I have for you.<br><br><br>Agent #1) <br><br>Name: Spencer Ellis<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 32<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Sky blue<br>- Hair: Light brown, short and combed<br>- Height: Average<br>Additional Features:<br>- He is rather fat, but not morbidly obese<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br>Personality: He is highly focused on academics, has greater need for dominance, leadership and attention than is usual, and he prefers initiating activity. He is very detail oriented, and can therefore catch things about someone&#39;s personality that others wouldn&#39;t based on small bits of evidence. He can learn very quickly, and he feels uncomfortable without a detailed plan laid out. He therefore is strongly agitated whenever someone doesn&#39;t follow the plan. Likewise, he becomes irritated whenever someone does something without telling him first. He holds the emotional needs of others in very low consequence, and is therefore not generally liked among the other, rather mentally unstable Agents. However, he hates losing someone during a mission and will obssess over their overall safety. Lastly, he holds views of Mary Sues that border on racism, constantly blaming Agent Bessie for the team&#39;s shortcomings and misfortunes and calling her a Mary Sue.<br><br>Abilities: Though he is a fairly skilled sharpshooter, Ellis&#39; skills lie not in his combat prowess, but in his ability to analyze a situation, create complex battle plans, improvise when those plans fail, and work cohesively with whatever group he is in. He also has the makings of a fine leader.<br><br>Backstory: Spencer Ellis and Melvin Moore were both lawyers in Maycomb County, Alabama, alongside their peer, Atticus Finch, in a To Kill a Mockingbird fanfic. One particular case, the Case of Marietta Crocker, drew the attention of a pair of assassins from the PPC, who proceeded to kill the Mary Sue, Marietta Crocker, in the county jail.<br><br>Fascinated by their methods, Ellis and Moore decided to join the PPC. While Moore decided to apply for a job in the Department of Internal Affairs, Ellis tried out for a position in The Legal Department, but was turned down because he &quot;wasn&#39;t what they were looking for&quot;. <br><br>Dissatisfied with this, Ellis joined various Departments- the Department of Plagiarism, the Department of Technical Errors, and eventually the Department of Finance- but was fired for various reasons, such as the inability to play well with others and attempting to get directly involved in missions he was not given. He eventually got a desk job in the Department of Finance, but deeply hated that he was not &quot;doing his Duty&quot;.<br><br><br>Agent #2)<br><br>Name: A. W. &quot;Bessie&quot; Besserdchenney<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 21<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Unremarkable Brown<br>- Hair color: Brown, shoulder length<br>- Height: A little short for her age<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br>Personality: She has a playful wit that she uses to either pull elaborate pranks on people or make fun of them. She is cunning, intelligent, deceitful, and can think outside the box. This last trait can give her the urge to make some foolhardy or implausible strategies during missions. She tries to stick to a strict code of honor; she will not fight an unarmed opponent, unless they show that they are capable of fighting her unarmed; she will not kill innocent civilians; she will not kick someone while they are down or running away; she will not abandon people she is close to or feel need her. However, this code of honor does not always apply, such as when she is hunting Mary Sues. She is unaware that she was a Mary Sue in a previous life, and takes offense whenever someone calls her one. <br><br>Abilities: A powerhouse duelist, she has an almost perfect balance of agility and strength, which she employs with brutal ferocity in battle. Her Kampilon sword is sharp, her armor is hard, and she can learn from her mistakes and successes quickly. <br><br>Backstory: The character that would come to be known as Bessie originated in an unnamed Shakespeare Suefic. She was captured by PPC agents Plank and Wells, and her story was destroyed because of its mechanics and horrible geography and flora and fauna.<br><br>The experiments that Plank performed on her worked, if only in part, and Plank insisted that she be inducted as an Agent, despite various protests from all over the PPC that Bessie, as she was now called, was not fully de-Sued. <br><br>However, Bessie did become an Agent, and her first job was with the Disturbing Acts of Violence Department, Action Division. She participated in several classified assignments, the purpose of which was to damage her brain even more and suppress her memories of being a Mary Sue further.<br><br>However, she was removed from the Department due to her overly violent outbursts resulting from massive consumption of Flaming Balrog after missions. She was sent to the Medical Department, where she had a six week recovery period, and which sent her to the Character Protective Services upon orders from the Flowers.<br><br>It was during this time that Bessie became infatuated by various Harry Potter and Twilight characters. <br><br>After a distinguished mission in which Bessie saved Sirius Black from a Mary Sue Death Eater, she was transfered to the Department of Mary Sues as an assassin.<br><br><br>Agent #3)<br><br>Name: Vivian Elsa Wells<br><br>Species: Human <br><br>Age: 29<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Brown<br>- Hair: Dirty blonde, blown back so that it sticks up<br>- Height: Average<br><br>Department : Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br>Abilities: Aside from her extensive knowledge of animals, plants, land masses and time paradoxes, Wells possesses a strange ability to run at superhuman speeds, which may or may not be connected with the candy she eats.<br><br>Personality: Vivian Wells is a woman with a manic and unruly personality. She really enjoys physical activities that involve her use of her insane bursts of speed, such as racing people. She also loves candy, often going entire days with a strictly sugar diet. However, she also adores the color pink, unicorns, and throwing parties. She goes into long talks about strictly feminine activities, such as cooking, fashion misshaps, the attractiveness of other female Agents, etc. She also likes to go shopping whenever she can, but at the same time she is wise with her money, usually only buying things that she thinks will be useful in some way. She likes to make fun of people when she knows it won&#39;t hurt their feelings, and therefore places a lot of emphasis on the emotions and mental wellbeing of others. She likes playing pranks. She has mastered the puppy face, notably being able to use it to sway the stubborn and resilient Ellis on several occasions, and can sometimes whine and complain when she doesn&#39;t get her way. Concerning her extensive knowledge, she has trouble recalling what she knows due in large part to her perpetual sugar high.<br><br>Backstory: When she joined the PPC, Agent Vivian Wells was initially placed in the Department of Floaters. However, she quickly gained a vast career, joining various Departments, such as Geographical Abberations, Misplaced Flora and Fauna, Bad Slash and Temporal Offenses. <br><br>Unfortunately, it was during her tenure in the Department of Temporal Offenses that she became clinically depressed and began her sugar addiction.<br><br>After this time, she joined Agent Plank, eventually capturing Bessie.<br><br>Wells then faced a troubling time in her life. Because of his exposure to a particularly powerful Mary Sue, Bessie, Plank began to contract Suemonia. However, instead of the usual effects, it began to drive him insane with grief and self loathing.<br><br><br>I believe that is the end of the profiles section. They are a little long, but I did my very best to keep each profile as close to four hundred words as possible. Agent Plank is not on here because he is more of a supporting character. However, if you would like to see his profile, let me know and I will happily show it to you. But for now, this is the end of part one of my permission request. Part Two will be up momentarily. <br><br></p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t seen much of anything in the thread about Vivian&#39;s clinical depression and feel like I should add my two cents.<br><br>Now, obviously, I can&#39;t speak for everyone who suffers or suffered from depression, but I&#39;m pretty sure sugar doesn&#39;t work like that. Sometimes I would feel so upset and disillusioned about the world that I would go on a sugar binge- I mean, actual granulated sugar, straight from the container- and I would feel better for about as long as the sugar was in my mouth. Then the sugar would be gone and I would be the same as ever, except I&#39;d feel worse because I just ate like two cups of pure sugar and had nothing to look forward to in life. <br><br>I can get why Vivian would hide her depression under a hyper facade, but you need to realize that depressed=/=unhappy all the time. Maybe she is genuinely a hyper person who suffers from depression.<br><br>Is it major depression or minor depression, or somewhere in between? My therapists classed me as minorly depressed until my failed suicide attempt. If I&#39;d been showing symptoms like losing interest in things that interested me, generally withdrawing from family and friends, or giving away possessions, they would have labelled me majorly depressed, but apparently trying to kill myself wasn&#39;t enough to merit the reclassification.<br><br>Sorry if I&#39;m being too blunt, but this is a really touchy subject for me for obvious reasons. So why am I putting it out here for everyone to see? Because people need to know this stuff. There&#39;ve been improvements in the general understanding of depression, but unless you&#39;ve directly experienced it (or one of those psychotic so-called experts, I guess), you can&#39;t really capture what it&#39;s like.<br><br>Most days I used to wake up dreading having to go through a new day. I would go to school and see my friends and for a while, everything would seem fine, even wonderful. Then I would get the latest update on my grades in a particular class and my world would fall apart inside, but I wouldn&#39;t let anyone see how I felt because I didn&#39;t want them to worry or brush me off or call me crazy or send me to a mental hospital. <br><br>You can seem completely normal to everyone else, but there is a lot you keep bottled up because you don&#39;t want anyone to know what you&#39;re going through. <br><br>What really bugs me about Vivian&#39;s description is that it seems like you gave her depression just for the heck of it. How do I make a three dimmentional character? I know! Let&#39;s make her depressed!<br><br>I&#39;m really sorry if this comes off as harsh, I really am. I just want to let you know that you&#39;ll need to handle it carefully so you don&#39;t really insult someone.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that. I know that you probably heard these things before, and there isn&#39;t a whole lot I can do about it, but you have my sincere sympathies. I totally understand why it would be a touchy subject.<br><br>But since you have some experience, may I ask a question, if it isn&#39;t being insensitive to do so?<br><br>The question: If the person were to be in total denial about their condition and found some escapist fantasy (such as indulging in homicidal tendencies on a sugar high and with a disproportionately odd personality to begin with), would that work? <br><br>I mean, I have a friend who is only nine years old who is an unashamed Bronie who told me that, uh, Pinkie Pie, I think her name was, was in some sort of state of denial about something that was apparently a psychological problem. A strange example, I know (and I had to figure out what he meant after a full five minute discussion, which was hard on me, since I&#39;m no Bronie), but does that happen in psychology? </p>

            <p>I have been declared &#39;recovered&#39; for about six months, though I&#39;m still on meds. I&#39;m definitely not depressed any more, but it does bother me when I hear people discussing it and they have all sorts of wrong ideas and I just want to scream at them that it&#39;s <i>not funny</i> but I don&#39;t because it&#39;s usually not people I like very much and I don&#39;t want to get into the personal stuff with them.<br><br>Sigh.<br><br>I suppose everyone&#39;s coping methods are different. For me, it was mostly reading. A lot. I must&#39;ve read Harry Potter more times in that last year than I have in the rest of my life put together. But it wasn&#39;t a cure, just a... Hmm... Okay, think of it like this. Someone collapses in the middle of the street, you give them CPR and then they&#39;re fine. You still want to take them to the hospital, because emergency first aid isn&#39;t always enough and you want to make sure there aren&#39;t any other complications.<br><br>That&#39;s kind of what coping methods are- first aid. They&#39;re enough to keep us going for a while, but we can&#39;t rely on our coping methods alone.<br><br>And there is a lot of debate among Bronies about whether or not Pinkie Pie is crazy (and I don&#39;t like to use that term, but the closest example I can think of is some bizarre Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde). Basically, when she thought a bunch if her friends were ignoring her, her mane went completely flat and she held a party where the guests were a bucket of turnips, a stack of rocks, and (I think, it&#39;s been a while since I watched that episode) a potato. And she was convinced they were talking to her. Then Rainbow Dash came along and dragged Pinkie to a surprise birthday party and Pinkie&#39;s mane poofed back up and she was back to her bubbly self. <br><br>That&#39;s not depression; it&#39;s more like disassociative personality disorder or something along those lines. I wouldn&#39;t use a nine year-old Brony as information about depression, especially if his information came from MLP.<br><br>The Jekyll and Hyde thing seems really obvious when you say &#39;homicidal tendencies&#39;... you might want to rethink that or rephrase it.</p>

She is &quot;the wimpy one&quot;, as the nine year old calls her. Then there is Rainbow- something, who I think looks like a hippie, but I guess is kind of the opposite of Fluttershy. I don&#39;t even know the name of the purple one. But there is supposed to be some evil dragon thing, I guess.<br><br>Or at least, that&#39;s what the nine year old told me, and I have learned the hard way not to take his word for stuff I don&#39;t know about...

            <p>So I&#39;ll fill in a bit more.<br><br>Don&#39;t underestimate Fluttershy. She might be extremely timid around most everypony, but she actually ended up shouting at a dragon <i>and making it cry</i> when it hurt her friends. She also stared down a framing <i>cockatrice</i>, managed to befriends Discord (the embodiment of chaos, pretty much), and there was one episode in particular where she took assertiveness lessons from a Minotaur and ended up terrorizing Ponyville when she took things too far.<br><br>There&#39;s also a dragon as part of the major minor characters (does that make sense? Eh...) named Spike. He&#39;s always referred to as a baby dragon, though considering he acts as Twilight&#39;s assistant and has a crush on Rarity, I&#39;d say he&#39;s more the equivalent of a ten or twelve year-old human kid. He&#39;s usually a pretty cheery character, though he always feels like he needs to prove his worth by doing- or trying to do- stuff way outside of his abilities.<br><br>Then you have the Cutie Mark Crusaders. They&#39;re a trio of young fillies who want to earn their Cutie Marks (the symbol on a pony&#39;s flank representing their special talent) so they aren&#39;t the targets of bullies at school. The thing is, though, you can&#39;t force a Cutie Mark, you have to discover it, but no matter how many times older ponies say so, the CMC don&#39;t listen.<br><br>The first member is Apple Bloom, who is Applejack&#39;s little sister and the founder (if you can pick one specifically) of the CMC. There have been a few indications in the show that her special talent has something to do with building, but she&#39;s not really noticed that herself yet. Like her sister, Apple Bloom is stubborn and doesn&#39;t like to listen to other ponies, and she usually feels like she has to prove her worth as the kid sibling of Big Macintosh and Applejack.<br><br>Sweetie Belle is Rarity&#39;s little sister and sees a Rarity as her role model, wanting to get a Cutie Mark in fashion or design or something similar, even though it&#39;s pretty obvious her talent is more of a musical nature. Sweetie Belle can be a bit naive, but she usually is the first of the CMC to realize when they&#39;ve gone too far in a particular stunt and acts as the mediator between Apple Bloom and Scootaloo when they butt heads.<br><br>Scootaloo is the last member of the Crusaders and is definitely a tomboy. She sees Rainbow Dash as the coolest pony ever and thinks of her like a big sister, even though they&#39;re not related. Scootaloo&#39;s favorite thing to do is zip around Ponyville on her scooter, using her wings to get up to great speeds. Her wings are a bit smaller than other ponies her age and she can barely fly, something that&#39;s a huge sore spot for her. Still, she&#39;s very kind, if a bit blunt.<br><br>If you want a good episode to get started watching, I&#39;d suggest &#39;A Canterlot Wedding&#39; because OMG PLOT BAD GUYS EPIC SONGS ACTION!<br><br>*ahem*<br><br>But I really do recommend it as a starting episode. It&#39;s fantastic.</p>

            <p>My Little Pony can&#39;t even keep its characterization straight between episodes.

            <p>There are six main characters, actually, seven if you count the Dragon you mentioned.<br><br>The purple pony is Twilight Sparkle(yes, everyone has already made all of the vampire jokes), the studious and magically powerful unicorn and current prodigy student of the country&#39;s ruler. The dragon isn&#39;t evil; his name&#39;s Spike, and he works as her personal assistant.<br><br>Rainbow Dash isn&#39;t a hippie. She&#39;s actually the sort of pony who would get bored very quickly with the hippie ideology. She spends most of her time breaking speed records and convincing others that she&#39;s awesome. She&#39;s managed to sway a large portion of the fan community, who have largely elevated her to mostly-uncontested &quot;best pony&quot; status ever since Twilight&#39;s... let&#39;s call it a &quot;promotion&quot;, at he end of Season Three.<br><br>Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie you already know, just not in detail.<br><br>Rarity is the first of the main characters you missed. She&#39;s a unicorn with aspirations of high status, and usually gets involved in the story when there are fancy clothes that need to be made or important ponies that need to be fraternized with. She tends to be overdramatic and a bit full of herself at times, but she&#39;s very supportive of her friends and family, especially her sister Sweetie Belle, who is part of a side-character organization referred to as the Cutie Mark Crusaders.<br><br>Applejack is the other, an apple-harvesting farm girl who serves as Rarity&#39;s occasional dramatic foil. Blunt, honest, and accepting of no nonsense, Applejack is the most straightforward and grounded of the main characters, but she&#39;s also the most uncompromising and stubborn. Her sister, Apple Bloom, is moderately less apple-obsessed than her sister, and spends most of her screen time as another member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders.<br><br>Sorry, World-Jumper; Marvin and Printworthy&#39;s hover-booth wasn&#39;t available. I had to deal with this one myself. Sorry if I accidentally misrepresented any details. (jetpacks away)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m away at work, and what happens? Somebody on the Board asks for a crash course in MLP. <i>And I missed it!</i> Come on guys. That&#39;s like, my thing.<br><br>Anyway, the others covered just about everything. I would give you a list of episodes to watch, but honestly, the others have that covered too. So, here I am, the guy with the agents in the MLP department, and I cant even cover it for you. *sigh*<br><br>Well, if you do have any questions on the <i>fandom</i>,  and any popular fanon, let me know. I&#39;ve been reading up on the fandom&#39;s most famous fanfics (the good ones, I&#39;ll have you know). It&#39;s been interesting, reading the old famous fanfics, and seeing how they have affected the fandom as a whole. For example, there is a popular fanon idea that Deer are the equilavelt of Elves in Equestria. That idea was started by <i>It&#39;s a Dangerous Business, Going Out Your Door,</i> by Jetfire. Not canon by any streach of the immagination, but something you may come across. But anyway, just ask, and I will happily tell you anything you want to know.<br><br>Also, Outhra, Marvin and Printowrthy&#39;s hover-booth is always available. Just keep in mind that it runs off of a Fallout: Equestria Spark Battery, which may or may not explode if not treated properly. But don&#39;t worry too much about it. They&#39;re sure absolutly nothing bad could possably happen.</p>

            <p>There might have been important establishing moments or character development I haven&#39;t taken into account, such as whatever Iximaz saw that redeemed Rarity for her. Also, I might be biased toward or against specific characters and not recognize it.<br><br>I hadn&#39;t said what the &quot;promotion&quot; was because I hadn&#39;t wanted to give you spoilers for an event that happened three seasons in. Not that the information wouldn&#39;t have been easy to find, since the change coincides with an obvious alteration in her character design, but spoilers are not the sort of thing that should be dropped in freely.<br><br>I personally recommend the Return of Harmony two-parter for your first episode. Canterlot Wedding is great, but it&#39;s not quite in tune with the rest of the show and might give you the wrong impression if you start out with it, like what the Friendship is Magic series premiere does. Honestly, it&#39;s tonal whiplash between the premiere, the not-very-good episode 3, and the rest of Season One. Return of Harmony shows the main six at their worst and best, pits them against an interesting and unpredictable opponent, and features the awesome John de Lancie. Everything is better with John de Lancie.  </p>

            <p>It&#39;s okay. We all have our preferences and biases. <br><br>A change in character design. Hmm... Okay, I&#39;ll look into it.<br><br>Return of Harmony. Okay, I&#39;ll look it up as well. While I&#39;m at it, I&#39;ll watch the first, ohhh, two seasons in their entirety. From there, I will probably move on to season three, or whatever numbers there are. I think there are at least four, maybe five, according to the nine year old. This time, if I get it wrong, it&#39;s my fault, because I was not paying that close attention to him when he said how many there were.</p>

            <p>I believe the dragon that was being referred to was actually Discord, who is a mish-mash of various creatures (ironically, so is a dragon) known in the show as a draconeques. Discord served as the big villain of the season two premiere before being reformed into a trickster style character in the third season. He is the embodiment of chaos, as well as the mini for this incarnation of My Little Pony. I imagine that means Tirek (who is a dragon [man this show likes dragons]) is the mini for the older generations?</p>

            <p>&gt;&quot;<i>Someone collapses in the middle of the street, you give them CPR and then they&#39;re fine.</i>&quot;<br><br><br>Not even close: CPR is administered when a victim is unconscious and no longer breathing. It involves compressing the chest at a specific point (from the bottom of the sternum, two fingers&#39; width up, then one hand span above those fingers) five centimetres down (roughly two inches) for a 30 compressions to 2 breath cycle (breaths can be omitted if you don&#39;t know how to do them or if the mouth area is FUBAR) to the beat of the Bee Gees&#39; <i>Stayin&#39; Alive</i>.<br><br>CPR done right will dislocate/break the sternum and fracture ribs. Your victim will be in a world of <b>P</b>ain if they wake up.

            <p>...was talking to a nine-year old Bronie!?!<br><br>No wonder you don&#39;t have any idea about it.  Seriously.  That grotesque, nightmarishly-cheerful cartoon is literally not in the same universe as anything like true clinical depression.<br><br>Anyway, going back to what Iximaz said...<br><br>For a start, adults just plain can&#39;t get the same kind of intense hyper sugar highs that children do.  That&#39;s called the &quot;cube rule&quot; but it&#39;s nothing to do with sugar cubes, just simple maths.  If an adult is twice the size of a child all round (i.e. twice as tall, twice as wide widthways, twice as wide front-to-back) then it will need <i>eight </i>times the amount of sugar to produce the same result (because 8 is 2x2x2, the first 2 for twice the height, the second 2 for twice widthways, the final 2 for twice front-to-back.)  This is why adults use alcohol or stronger drugs to get their buzz more efficiently!<br><br>And that&#39;s before you start taking into account the effects of depression in actively cancelling out the high.  Despite what the ponies may have told your friend, true depression isn&#39;t merely an absence of happiness; it&#39;s something that actively seeks out and destroys happiness and turns it into misery.<br><br>You would know this if you&#39;d done real research into the subject instead of asking a random kid about cute cartoon creatures!

            <p>I like you.  You mind me of a younger me but with less self awareness.<br><br>(Yeah, yeah, I know, objectively, that&#39;s probably not a very useful thing for you to be, but I like it anyway!)<br><br>We both have an overactive imagination that&#39;s always coming up with wonderful story ideas that won&#39;t go away, but we don&#39;t know how to do anything with our ideas to make them work or turn them into really good stories.<br><br>The difference is that you haven&#39;t given up trying.  You still have that enthusiasm.  It hasn&#39;t been drained out of you yet.  Don&#39;t let us take that away from you!<br><br>(Now I&#39;m picturing you dressed up as Fred Astaire, singing &quot;<a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3ctdg_fred-astaire-they-can-t-take-that-a_news">They can&#39;t take that away from me...</a>&quot;)<br><br>Anyway, let&#39;s get back to business.<br><br>What do you want to achieve, in story terms, with Vivian&#39;s history of mental illness?  Is it just an excuse for her sugar/cocaine/Bleepcaine/whatever addiction?  Or are you also going somewhere else with it?<br><br>If the depression&#39;s not important, then just drop it, and go with something else.  (e.g. My earlier suggestion that she&#39;s a former badfic writer who, after joining the PPC, found herself transformed by an author&#39;s note she&#39;d written as a kid, and now has superspeed and this implausible addiction to sugar as a result.)<br><br>OTOH how important is it, in story terms, that she comes from the real world?  Are you going to do anything important with that?<br><br>If neither of these are important, then maybe you could just drop them both and say she comes from a universe where people&#39;s bodies react differently to sugar and so superspeed and sugar addiction are normal.  Problem solved.<br><br>But if there&#39;s no other choice and she absolutely has to come from the real world with a real mental illness, you&#39;d better do it realistically.<br><br>I&#39;ve had a few mental health problems in the past, and I&#39;m using that as <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Pippa%27s_Ghost/Ideas_for_agents_-_Agent_Sean_Bellman">part of the back story for one of my characters</a>.  But I&#39;m trying to keep it realistic, and also making it an important part of his motivation for joining the PPC in the first place.<br><br>Anyway, keep on finding ideas.  You&#39;re good at that.  But also try and take time to let them breathe and grow naturally.  And feed them with plenty of research.  They&#39;ll thank you for it.  Ideas love research the same way that Minis love bacon!<br></p>

            <p>Thank you for that. <br><br>What do I intend to achieve with it... Well, I certainly wasn&#39;t using it only as an excuse to give her the sugar high (which is, even now, evolving into something more technologically advanced). I intended to bring it back every once in a while to force her to face the source of the depression, which mostly resulted from her long time in the field and watching someone she grew close to suffer. Forcing her to face those things, at the time, seemed like a good way to develope her character. Now that I am reevaluating my agents, I may choose something different, but that was the general idea.<br><br>I remember that suggestion. It&#39;s in my pool of possibilities still, along with a few others. If she were to be a former badfic writer, it would be interesting to bring in her former stories for missions... Oh, the possibilities! <br><br>I had a sense of irony in mind, actually. Ellis comes from a fanfiction story based in the early twentieth century, and therefore he would be behind the times, despite his ability to learn rather quickly. (Not Mary Sue quickly, but still...) Bessie, on the other hand, is a Mary Sue, and her grasp of logic, physics and reality in general are shaky. Wells was supposed to be the one out of the three who anchored them in reality the most. And there in lies the irony, because Wells is obviously the hyper one with the short attention span and stuff. I thought the idea was amusing.<br><br>I will, and thanks for the help. (air five)</p>

            <p>To me that sounds like you are edging out of depressed territory and into Dissociative territory. That sounds like a near complete break with reality. I don&#39;t have any experience personally or research-wise with this, but I suppose you could be falling into something close to mania. (which can be very bad for your health, especially untreated, so no saying she is bipolar and in a manic phase just to explain away why she was depressed and is now super hyper and eating candy is not a good idea).<br><br>But I think the basic point to the entire Permission thread, and to these last two posts, are that you need to do some basic research on your own. It kind of seems like you operate like this: Idea! Post question about idea! Oh, someone says idea doesn&#39;t fit very well. Think thirty seconds, alter idea, post alteration!<br><br>I know that&#39;s probably a little overly blunt and a bit of an exaggeration on the time spent, but go read articles on clinical depression. If you aren&#39;t comprehending the first ones, read more. Check out the further information and related articles links. Google words you don&#39;t know. <br><br>Bad Medicine and Bad Psychology are two of my biggest pet peeves in fanfics. I know this information can be found on the Internet, because I&#39;ve gone and done the research myself. I spent probably three weeks researching how EMTs respond to various emergencies. I watched real training videos, went to real product sites, and read real standard operating procedure manuals from several different companies/counties/hospitals that currently operate ambulance services. I had to look up a lot of medical jargon, and I also read blogs by EMTs that covered training scenarios and explained common slang. I did refrain from speaking to an actual EMT, which for accuracy&#39;s sake I really should have, but I don&#39;t do well in RL social situations. All of that research was to be able to fairly accurately write a single scene in a fanfic, and honestly the medical stuff was the background that allowed the plot stuff to happen--it wasn&#39;t even the centerpiece of the scene. If it had been the main point of the scene, or if the story was going to be about the EMT&#39;s, then I would have gotten out of my comfort zone and talked to people who actually do the work. The point being is that if you are going to write something that you don&#39;t already know about then you&#39;ve really got to put in the effort for it.</p>

            <p>When I decided I wanted Rina to be allergic to Bleep products, I did some digging on allergic reactions and the different kinds and time before symptoms show up and such. When I realized there was a lot more to it than I originally thought, my &#39;bit of digging&#39; turne into several hours&#39; worth of poking around on medical websites and the like, gathering information. <br><br>I doubt any of the information will be used after one scene I have planned, but it&#39;s pretty important.

            <p>Honestly, all it takes is time an effort to check whether something is &quot;common knowledge&quot; or just something that time-pressed television writers got wrong.  Often that&#39;s why some shows hire a consultant if it&#39;s worth the budget.<br><br>Have her suffer from non-specific soap opera disease if it&#39;s so important.

            <p>As far as Spencer and Vivian go, I see no fundamental problems with them. You have the basic setup of thinky versus hyper, which should (could) work out well. I will point out that the Department of Finance isn&#39;t an Action Department - while I&#39;ve got a &#39;mission&#39; in the works for them, all their jobs are fundamentally desk jobs. And on Vivian, I&#39;ll also note that giving a character clinical depression - and then covering it up with a permanent sugar high - is something that certainly <i>should</i> lead to problems (for her) down the line. If you&#39;re not planning on that, either remove the depression, or start planning it.<br><br>Bessie... worries me. Perhaps appropriately for a Mary-Sue, her bio is riddled with plotholes. I&#39;ll just paste in the notes I took so you can see what I mean:<br><br>&gt;Fairly contradictory. Intelligent but prone to implausible strategies? Strict code of honour she discards at will?<br>&gt;Cunning/deceit doesn&#39;t usually combine with brute strength.<br>&gt;Why was Plank on the mission /and/ performing missions.<br>&gt;How did Plank persuade the Flowers to make her an agent? The Flowers are <i>in charge</i>.<br>&gt;Why the torture of her?<br>&gt;Why the idea that DMS is a &#39;promotion&#39; from DCPS?<br>&gt;How does Ellis know Bessie was a MS? Or, inversely, how does she /not/ know when everyone else seems to?<br><br>If I have seven issues with her and her backstory from just the bio, there&#39;s a fairly serious problem there.<br><br>Moving on to the samples:<br><br>Sample 1 I have only a couple of problems with, but given Sample 2, they may be significant. You say &#39;PPC compound&#39;, which suggests you may not understand what PPC HQ is like. You have an exclamation point in your narration, which is generally frowned on in third person; you also have a random capital letter on Brown hair and, worryingly, your &#39;Shakespearean&#39; dialogue contains an error: <i>t&#39;is</i> should be <i>&#39;tis</i>. If you&#39;re going to write in that style, you have to do it well - misusing Shakespearean English is a fairly common charge in missions. Still, overall, yes: you give a decent look at your agents.<br><br>But Sample 2... oh dear. I only wrote two notes, but they&#39;re big ones:<br><br>&gt;<i>Flowers do not speak in quotes!</i> It&#39;s one of their primary characteristics<br>&gt;The SO is wildly out of character in most of his lines. The only one that feels in is &#39;I cannot eat those. I am [a Sunflower].&#39;, and that one has a typo.<br><br>You seem to have a good grasp of your characters, though I&#39;m still dubious about Bessie. Moreover, you seem to be able to <i>write</i> your characters, which is even more important than being able to craft bios.<br><br>But you are also displaying serious holes in your understanding of the <i>PPC</i>. &#39;Flowers speak in italics&#39; isn&#39;t a subtle thing you can miss - it&#39;s a feature of every single one of their appearances. And your SO... doesn&#39;t feel like the SO.<br><br><u>Permission Checklist</u><br><br>-Active in the community - YES.<br>-Characters not Suvian - YES.<br>-Acceptable writing ability - YES.<br>-Understanding of the PPC - NO.<br><br>I&#39;m going to turn down Permission at this time, based on that last concern. To put it another way, it feels like you&#39;ve learned all the names of things without learning what they <i>are</i>. That&#39;s the same issue people raised in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=257982;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">your big thread</a>, and you don&#39;t appear to have solved it yet.<br><br>My advice is this: for each PPC concept that will appear in your writing - in this case, the SO and PPC HQ - read two or three missions or stories that contain them, from different authors where possible. So if you wanted to write something about DAVD, you could read <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/DAVD2009.htm">this</a>, <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/ifidie.html">this</a>, <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission24.html">this</a>, and <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/buffyverse/highway.htm">this</a>. The Wiki will be your friend here - most pages have some form of &#39;Appearances&#39; section, or failing that, there&#39;s the References. It might be more difficult with the SO, but he&#39;s in so much that you shouldn&#39;t have much trouble.<br><br>Once you&#39;ve <i>read</i> about the character or concept - as presented in multiple contexts, and by multiple authors - be sure to base your version on what you&#39;ve read.<br><br>With that in mind, unless other concerns are raised I&#39;ll be happy to consider this again in this same thread, if you&#39;ll provide:<br><br>-A rewritten version of Sample 2, with the SO in character. The suggestion above should help you do that.<br>-A 200-or-so word very short story with one or more of your agents going... oh... from their RC to the Cafeteria. No portals allowed.<br><br>Addressing some of my concerns about Bessie too wouldn&#39;t go amiss.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Here are the revisions you asked me to make.<br><br>First, Here is my revised bio of Bessie.<br>Agent #2)<br><br>Name: A. W. &quot;Bessie&quot; Besserdchenney<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 21<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Unremarkable Brown<br>- Hair color: Brown, shoulder length<br>- Height: A little short for her age<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br>Personality: She has a playful wit that she uses to either pull elaborate pranks on people or make fun of them. However, this does not make her intelligent, and she is prone to foolhardy moves in combat. She tries to stick to a strict code of honor; she will not fight an unarmed opponent, unless they show that they are capable of fighting her unarmed; she will not kill innocent civilians, unless they are non sentient; she will not kick someone while they are down or running away, unless they are a Mary Sue; she will not abandon people she is close to or feel need her. She is unaware that she was a Mary Sue in a previous life, and takes offense whenever someone calls her one. <br><br>Abilities: A powerhouse duelist, she has an almost perfect balance of agility and strength, which she employs with brutal ferocity in battle. Her Kampilon sword is sharp, her armor is hard, and she can learn from her mistakes and successes quickly. <br><br>Backstory: The character that would come to be known as Bessie originated in an unnamed Shakespeare Suefic. She was captured by PPC agents Plank and Wells, and her story was destroyed because of its mechanics and horrible geography and flora and fauna.<br><br>The experiments that Plank performed on her worked, if only in part, and Plank insisted that she be inducted as an Agent, despite various protests from all over the PPC that Bessie, as she was now called, was not fully de-Sued. <br><br>However, Bessie did become an Agent, and her first job was with the Disturbing Acts of Violence Department, Action Division. She participated in several classified assignments, the purpose of which was to damage her brain even more and suppress her memories of being a Mary Sue further.<br><br>However, she was removed from the Department due to her overly violent outbursts resulting from massive consumption of Flaming Balrog after missions. She was sent to the Medical Department, where she had a six week recovery period, and which sent her to the Character Protective Services upon orders from the Flowers.<br><br>It was during this time that Bessie became infatuated by various Harry Potter and Twilight characters. <br><br>After a distinguished mission in which Bessie saved Sirius Black from a Mary Sue Death Eater, she was transfered to the Department of Mary Sues as an assassin. <br><br>Next, I decided to add something else. Quite a few things are left unanswered by my not elaborating on Agent Plank, so I decided to include the bio for him as well. Please keep in mind that he is meant to be more of a supporting character. <br><br>Here it is.<br>Agent #4)<br><br>Name: Alfred Plank<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 59<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Grey<br>- Hair: White and messy<br>- Height: Slightly above average<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sue Experimentation and Research<br><br>Abilities: Aside from being a crack shot with a Phaser and an ambitious inventer, Plank is a veteran agent with a highly developed understanding of Mary Sues and Sue Wraiths.<br><br>Personality: He has a scientific curiosity in all things to do with Mary Sues, going beyond normal boundaries and even coming across as obsessive and pushy. He takes risks that most other scientists wouldn&#39;t take, partly because he is going senile. He has a passionate hatred of Mary Sues, and after contracting Suemonia and starting to become Sued, he began to loath himself. <br><br>Backstory: Little is known about his early life, except that he probably came from a Star Trek fanfic. What is known is that he joined the PPC around twenty-five years ago. During his time in the Department of Floaters, he began showing an aptitude for using chemical components as weapons. Because of this, he was made an assassin in the Department of Mary Sues. <br><br>He went through several partners, all of whom have apparently been killed in action, from year one to year twenty.

Wells became less and less patient, and this began to make Ellis angry.<br><br>&quot;If you want to there so bad, then help us find it!&quot; he finally snapped. <br><br>&quot;Just follow me, then.&quot; Wells almost took off at high speeds, but stopped herself at the last second and led them along at an almost leisurely pace. <br><br>&quot;A truly excellent show of restraint, mine friend.&quot; Bessie congratulated Wells. &quot;I am proud of thee.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; Something about the way that Wells answered bothered Ellis. He could not put his finger on it. But there was clearly some unspoken tension between his partners, for whatever reason. <br><br>How was that? Better?</p>

            <p>Leaving aside absolutely everything else that&#39;s come up in this thread, your Sample 3 at the end demonstrates that you did <i>not</i> do the research on what makes navigating HQ difficult. Since the prompt was given with the explicit intent that:<br><br><i>for each PPC concept that will appear in your writing - in this case, the SO and PPC HQ - read two or three missions or stories that contain them, from different authors where possible. [...]<br><br>Once you&#39;ve read about the character or concept - as presented in multiple contexts, and by multiple authors - be sure to base your version on what you&#39;ve read.</i><br><br>You also continue to show problems with the Shakespearean English that you want to use - to take a single example, &#39;I do not knoweth&#39; is wildly wrong - and for some reason have only responded to the first comment I made about Bessie. You&#39;ve kept the torture, and added abuse of prescription drugs to Plank&#39;s repertoire. I&#39;m pretty sure <i>adrenaline</i> is not a cure for depression. And you now have Plank both hating Mary-Sues and trying to find a cure for them, which is a massive contradiction.<br><br>You haven&#39;t offered any explanation for Plank switching randomly between DMS and DMSE&amp;R, for the fact that the Flowers have apparently allowed an agent to join despite their disapproval - for the fact that they disapprove at all - for the reason Bessie was given to the assassin Plank for rehabilitation rather than to FicPsych - for your insistence that DMS is a &#39;promotion&#39; from DCPS.<br><br>You also haven&#39;t rewritten Sample 2, which I specifically requested. As a consequence of all these things, I have to say Permission Denied at this time. That doesn&#39;t mean you should try to make frantic changes and repost as soon as possible - it means you should sit back, read a few missions (maybe even review them as Neshomeh suggested), get a better feel for what the PPC is like, and rework your characters. Pippa has uploaded her prospective agents onto her blog on the Wiki, and I think that&#39;s a brilliant way to get concrit on them without constantly making new threads. But however you do it, do <i>not</i> go away right now and start crossing things out. That&#39;s the best way to end up with a wrecked and useless character. Characters should be cohesive wholes, not a bundle of edits made in response to specific comments.<br><br>I really wanted to be able to grant Permission here, Dark Brother 16. You can spell-and-punctuate, you have ideas I think are interesting, and the combination of grumpy control freak, ditzy sugar-high, and Shakespearean duelist looked really interesting. But every time you&#39;ve added more information it&#39;s revealed bigger and bigger holes in the logic of the characters - and in your understanding of the PPC. I&#39;m sorry. But if you take all the suggestions people have made to heart, work on making logically-sound agents who fit into the framework of the PPC rather than trying to bend that framework around them, and ask again in a month or two, we will definitely consider it again.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The defining characteristic of HQ - and the thing I was looking for in Sample 3 - was stated by Jay Thorntree way back when: <i>&quot;It&#39;s a bit of a maze, unless you haven&#39;t noticed.&quot;</i> You do <i>not</i> get anywhere in Headquarters by trying to find it - instead, you distract yourself with music or rambling conversation, try looking for a different room, or in many cases, bang your head into a wall until you&#39;re dizzy.

            <p>While I agree that Dark Brother has been active in the community, and that his writing is technically acceptable, I feel that the characters presented are all a bit speshul and/or contradictory.  I won&#39;t bother mentioning Bessie, since you&#39;ve done an excellent job of cataloging those problems.  Here are some instances in the other agents:<br><br>Ellis &quot;work[s] cohesively with whatever group he is in&quot; and has the makings of a fine leader.  However, he doesn&#39;t really care about the emotional needs of others and he isn&#39;t well liked (which makes sense, since Dark Brother mentioned elsewhere that he is supposed to be unlikable).

If the latter, why was he on a Mary Sue mission with someone who was, as far as I can tell, in the DTO?<br><br>Wells is a World-One human who gets super speed from a combination of clinical depression and sugar-high.

            <p>My notes described Ellis simply as &#39;Control freak&#39;. The impression I got is that he will work with whatever tools (y&#39;know, other people) he&#39;s got, but not treat them <i>as</i> people. He doesn&#39;t care about their feelings, but basically wants to keep them intact because they&#39;re useful. The phrase &#39;has greater need for dominance, leadership and attention than is usual&#39; fits into this - it&#39;s not actually talking about I&#39;ll-lead-and-you-follow type of leadership, but more, well...<br><br>... actually, more like how I imagine <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JYZ7eqTClNA4Y7rMd_q1Gw7FfkVLrQXQqO07wUqiTtE/edit">the Strategist</a>, ironically enough. I don&#39;t <i>like</i> him, but I can see him as an interesting character.<br><br>Plank is only talked about in Bessie&#39;s bio, so I covered him in there, but I do agree with your comments.<br><br>Wells... well, I think she&#39;s basically a hyperactive fangirl. I have no problem with her sugar high giving her super speed (or even &#39;runs everywhere and so looks like she has super speed&#39;) because <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=258509;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Pippa&#39;s not-so-silly suggestion</a> makes perfect sense to me. At least the parts about sugar highs. Maybe she got first-person&#39;d into an author&#39;s note of the kind Pippa describes, and can&#39;t shake it off? That would be funny, I think.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t see Pippa&#39;s comments.  They seem to have been posted about the same time as my comment, which always seems to happen, doesn&#39;t it?  I do agree with her and you that with an appropriate explanation, it could work.

            <p>Specifically, I agree about Wells. I think I did bring up her depression/hyper dichotomy, though I don&#39;t believe I mentioned the speed thing. So yeah, I think that needs explaining.<br><br>But Ellis... I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m coming up with an explanation. &#39;Control freak&#39; is what I read right there on the page. I mean, look at his &#39;personality&#39; bio again:<br><br><i>He is highly focused on academics, has greater need for dominance, leadership and attention than is usual, and he prefers initiating activity. He is very detail oriented, and can therefore catch things about someone&#39;s personality that others wouldn&#39;t based on small bits of evidence. He can learn very quickly, and he feels uncomfortable without a detailed plan laid out. He therefore is strongly agitated whenever someone doesn&#39;t follow the plan. Likewise, he becomes irritated whenever someone does something without telling him first. He holds the emotional needs of others in very low consequence, and is therefore not generally liked among the other, rather mentally unstable Agents. However, he hates losing someone during a mission and will obssess over their overall safety.</i><br><br>The only thing I&#39;ve snipped is the &#39;racism&#39; part at the end. Every other sentence in the bio supports the idea that he is very clever, very good at forming plans, has a burning need to be in charge and have everyone <i>follow</i> his plans - and doesn&#39;t care about them as people in any way, but as elements of the plan.<br><br>The only place that breaks down is in &#39;abilities&#39;, and I admit I didn&#39;t see that on my first read. Let&#39;s take a look:<br><br><i>...his ability to analyze a situation, create complex battle plans, improvise when those plans fail, and work cohesively with whatever group he is in. He also has the makings of a fine leader.</i><br><br>Analyse a situation. Create plans. Those fit perfectly with what we&#39;ve already been told. The last three clauses are a bit more debatable, but the fact that he is <i>good</i> at improvising, doesn&#39;t invalidate the fact that he <i>dislikes</i> doing so. I&#39;m not actually sure what the phrase &#39;work cohesively with&#39; means ;), but Ellis - as described - could certainly work-with-as-in-use any group. Y&#39;know, provided he was allowed to issue orders.<br><br>As to &#39;the makings of a fine leader&#39;... only if he learns to get his ego under control! And that, yes, is jarringly different from what we&#39;ve been told. But one line doesn&#39;t break a character.<br><br>Anyway. Hopefully, Dark Brother 16 will be reading everything that&#39;s being said about his characters, in an attempt to learn what problems there are and what to do about them. Hopefully, he&#39;ll take this hint I&#39;m dropping - this one, right here - and rework his bios so that every portion of the personality and abilities is justified by the history (which is something I&#39;m going to put into the doc right now). If he <i>doesn&#39;t</i> read the entirety of his own Permission thread... then that says something else entirely, doesn&#39;t it?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Just want to put this out there: I get the impression that Dark Brother isn&#39;t actually interested in writing about the PPC for its own sake, but rather for an extra dimension he can tack on to his original story. Kinda like how he doesn&#39;t seem interested in editing the wiki to make it better, but simply to collect badges. This is borne out in a lot of the question threads he&#39;s started since joining, but perhaps most worryingly <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=257630;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">in this thread</a>, which is less than two weeks old.<br><br>Until I see signs of that changing—such as him reading and possibly reviewing missions, demonstrating a regard for PPC concepts, and giving up (not just backpedaling and tweaking, <i>giving up</i>) the kinds of overlarge, high conflict spinoff ideas that I and others have objected to—I&#39;m not personally going to be in favor of giving him Permission.

            <p>Remind me again how grand and sweeping done well is, y&#39;know, bad? I get you having reservations about particular people doing it, but in and of itself, &quot;overlarge&quot; is a meaningless descriptor to dole out as a negative. Hell, you could chuck it at George R. R. Martin from the moment he introduced the rest of Essos, and at Iain M. Banks for, well, pretty much every book involving the Culture.<br><br>I&#39;m also not particularly fond of how you&#39;re talking about him asking questions. How else is he supposed to learn about the intricacies of the PPC, osmosis? I mean, I did a lot of research before coming in, but that&#39;s because my life&#39;s about as empty as it&#39;s possible for a human life to be. Asking people questions is [i]how human beings learn[/i]. You may consider it pointless, you might consider the questions witless, but you&#39;ve been here for a lot longer than he has and you have sufficient knowledge of the PPC to be a permission giver. Not everyone has that knowledge base, particularly someone who hasn&#39;t been around very long.<br><br>Oh, while I&#39;m here, so what if he wants to write something as a spinoff? We&#39;re fanfiction authors, for goodness&#39;s sake. We don&#39;t write anything [i]except[/i] spinoffs. Hell, my most Internet-famous piece of writing is the bastard offspring of a medieval folk ballad and My Little frigging Pony. It&#39;s a spinoff of two different, totally disparate themes, and it seems to make people laugh.<br><br>tl;dr: I understand where you&#39;re coming from in regards to PPC knowledge base; I just think you&#39;re overegging that particular pudding a bit.</p>

            <p>I think some of what you said is addressed in my reply to hS, but a few things in particular:<br><br>- Grand and sweeping done well is great... in a universe that was built to accommodate it. The PPC wasn&#39;t; the PPC was built for short and silly lampoons of bad fanfic. If you&#39;ve been around long enough to build up the trust and experience to pull it off, maybe you can try something grander here, but no newbie in the history of ever has had those qualifiers. Overlarge with the implied <i>for this context</i> is a valid complaint, I think.<br><br>-  I was not complaining about Dark Brother asking questions. I was pointing to his question <i>threads</i> as places to discover the intent I&#39;m concerned about. (That said, it does say right up in the Board&#39;s header that doing research before asking a question is a good idea. It perfectly reasonable for me to have that expectation.)<br><br>- All PPC spinoffs are indeed spinoffs... of Jay and Acacia&#39;s Original Series. Or at least they should be. If you&#39;re trying to make it into something else with a PPC decal slapped on for show, that&#39;s a problem in my book, just as writing a so-called <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fic that relates to the original in name only is a problem in my book.<br><br>I think you may have been expecting the worst of me here. I hope this gives a more accurate sense of my meaning.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>For that, I apologise. I may not agree with you, particularly on the subject of scale in comically-oriented universes (read Sluggy Freelance all the way through for my rebuttal), but it was wrong of me to put my reservations in such a diffident way. Reading through your response to hS, which did not exist while I was writing the original comment, I can see what you were driving at. I shouldn&#39;t have snapped at you and I&#39;m sorry for it.<br><br>You misconstrue my point about spinoffs, though. Not only are PPC fics spinoffs of TOS, they&#39;re also fanfiction for the universe we&#39;re entering (specifically a weirdly meta breed of Fix Fic), and fanfiction by its very nature is transformative. I&#39;ve read tender character-driven stories based on grotesquely violent anime series and Cornwell-style war stories based on a Western show about talking animals in various delightful pastel shades. Good is good, regardless of the original intent of the setting. I don&#39;t hold with diving headlong into a game of Obscure Trivia Bingo at the expense of telling a good story, much like I can forgive slightly iffy grammar and spelling if the ideas are praiseworthy.<br><br>Iunno, I guess I&#39;m just more lenient than a Boarder should be.</p>

            <p>I agree that the wiki editing was bad, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s done it in the last few days; granted that might indicate he was busy, but I&#39;m willing to hope he&#39;s actually paid attention to the things we&#39;ve said.<br><br>On the subject of <i>isn&#39;t actually interested in writing about the PPC for its own sake, but rather for an extra dimension he can tack on to his original story</i>... well, how much of a &#39;bad thing&#39; is that? Always provided the PPC writing is done <i>well</i>, I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d feel comfortable objecting that people weren&#39;t paying their fanfic enough attention, but were writing their own things instead. ;) To put it another way - after <i>The Ispace Wars</i> ends I plan on opening it up as a free-to-write-for shared universe, but won&#39;t be offended if people only use it as an add-on to the PPC.<br><br>Your other comments, however, I don&#39;t have much objection to. Reading missions was one I mentioned in my response - my &#39;recommendation&#39; was more of an instruction ;) - though the idea of reviewing them didn&#39;t occur to me (<a href="http://terrireviews.blogspot.co.uk/">though it should have</a>). &#39;Demonstrating a regard for PPC concepts&#39; is essentially what I failed the request on. As for giving up on &#39;overlarge, high conflict spinoff ideas&#39;... well, perhaps I have a higher tolerance for those that most. Given my history (and my History) I&#39;d look a bit hypocritical saying &#39;No overarching plotlines! No big stories! No drama!&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... is that you didn&#39;t <i>start out</i> by saying you were going to co-opt the PPC universe and cause trouble in it (say, by resurrecting killed Legendary Badfics) for your own side-purposes. I think we absolutely can and should object to people coming in with that mentality. In fact, we <i>do</i> often tell people to start small and not immediately go gunning for Legendaries, novel-length AUs, or bottom-of-the-barrel squick. I feel that&#39;s appropriate, and I think we can quite reasonably extend that response to this situation.<br><br>Also, the heart of my concern is that I think writing for a world and concepts you aren&#39;t invested for their own sake basically guarantees they&#39;re not going to be well-written, just as they weren&#39;t well-written here, and we&#39;ll keep seeing more of the same until that changes. It&#39;s not that I think no one should ever write other stuff and the PPC at the same time, or even that no one should ever involve the PPC with outside stuff. It&#39;s that, at this time and for the near future, I don&#39;t trust that the stuff I have some guardianship over will be handled well. That could totally change, but only over time.<br><br>So, tl;dr, I don&#39;t want to see your &quot;no&quot; reversed too soon, is all.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>To every Boarder who hates Mary Sues, this is my permission request, part two!<br><br><br>Okay, I chose both of the prompts at random, and here they stand. <br><br><br>Control: The agents first meet<br><br>Random: The agents meet a robot in HQ wearing a mask of a canon character, OR, one Agent plans a surprise party for the others.<br><br>As I have said before, I will likely separate the prompts. One will be located here, and the other will be located in the response to this response. <br><br><br>Without further ado, here is what I have for you.<br><br><br>Response Center 525, one of only a few triplexes in the entire PPC compound. This was Ellis&#39; new home. He knew better than to hope for a partner who was anything like he was. <br><br>Sure enough, as he opened the door, utter chaos struck him hard in the face!<br><br>Or rather, a Boston Crème Pie hit him hard in the face. Ellis began swearing profusely, dropped his luggage and began wiping the crème out of his face.<br><br>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; cried a high, scratchy, yet distinctly feminine voice. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I fell into that broken table again. Here, let me help you.&quot;<br><br>Ellis felt a cloth begin wiping off his face. &quot;No, &#39;t&#39;sall right, I got it. Jus- hey- stop.&quot; he added when she didn&#39;t stop. <br><br>Whoever she was, she gave him his space as he finally managed to open his eyes. His new partner was slightly shorter than he was, and had Brown eyes and dirty blonde hair that stood up, as if they had been blown back while she had been traveling at high speeds. <br><br>She began shaking his hand furiously. &quot;Hi! I&#39;m Vivian Wells, your new partner.&quot;<br><br>Ellis drew back, regained his balance, then told her, &quot;Nice t&#39;meet ya.&quot; Though he didn&#39;t entirely sound like it was nice to meet her at all. &quot;I&#39;m Spencer Ellis.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Want some?&quot; Wells offered him some sweets. &quot;You look like you might enjoy these.&quot;<br><br>Spluttering in indignation, Ellis demanded, &quot;Is that a fat joke?&quot;<br><br>Wells giggled mischievously as she burst away toward her side of the RC, 525-B, with inhuman speed.<br><br>&quot;Do not, Mr Ellis, take offense to her joking personality,&quot; came a bored, imperious voice from 525-C. &quot;She means only to test you and find your limits.&quot;<br><br>This voice belonged to a slightly short young woman with brown eyes and brown, shoulder length hair. She could not have been more different from Wells, as, instead of wearing a tank top with a daisy on it and sweats, she wore a set of steel plate armor.<br><br>But Ellis knew who this was. &quot;You! You&#39;re-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bessie. Aye, t&#39;is so. Like many others, you know me, then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I...&quot; Ellis struggled to find a new subject. &quot;I... I gotta unpack.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very well.&quot; Bessie replied, turning to return to 525-C. &quot;Consider fixing the table Wells broke.&quot;<br><br>And that is the control prompt, everyone! I am experiencing difficulties with posting both of the prompts, there fore the next one, the random one, will be up momentarily in the reply to this reply. Stand by!</p>

Candy?&quot; she asked politely as she offered him some sweets.<br><br>But the Sunflower Official held up its leafy arm. &quot;I cannot eat those. I am sunflower.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, right.&quot; Wells giggled. She popped the candy into her mouth and felt the rush of energy fill her veins and heard the hum of the world around her slowing. &quot;I&#39;d better go and get started with the preparations, then.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Alright. Have a nice day.&quot; The response was very strange, coming to Wells in slow motion.<br><br>Wells rushed off at the top speed that she could maintain for however long she needed. She had work to do, and she needed Plank &#39; s help.<br><br>And that is all, ladies and gentlemen! Please tell me what you think.

            <p>The writing samples seem rather short. Plus, since the second one only has Wells, I think you&#39;ll be asked to redo them. They&#39;re supposed to let us see how you write your characters, and all we really got from Bessie was her saying hi. However, you did write quite a bit for your character intros, so I feel like we have a little to go on from those. Bessie seems like she&#39;ll be an interesting character, but you seem to forget that there are many former &#39;Sues working in the PPC. As such, the prejudices against her would most likely come from few besides her partner. Speaking of Ellis, he seems rather unlikable. Very sure of himself, very spiteful, and very abrasive. For Wells, there is one thing in particular that catches my eye. You say she was clinically depressed at one point, then Bessie inadvertently killed her partner. This tortured past doesn&#39;t seem to fit with her energetic character, no matter how much candy she&#39;s gnawing on. Also, would she really want to be near Bessie after Plank caught Suemonia from her? I mean, the Flowers might like their buddy cop mismatches, but that seems a bit much. Lastly, where does Wells come from? You never mentioned it in her bio, and I&#39;m curious as to why you didn&#39;t simply say &quot;Oh, she comes from the DC Universe&quot; or some such to explain her super speed.</p>

            <p>Mm-hm. Good advice, thanks. However, I have a fee things I want to point out, which I probably should have mentioned in the bios and excerpts. <br><br>1. The writing samples, I think, we&#39;re only supposed to be 200-400 words long, so I didn&#39;t have a lot of room there.<br><br>2. There are other Agents that used to be Mary Sues, I am aware of thst. The controversy is that there are those who believe that she didn&#39;t go through enough &quot;reengineering&quot;, if you will. I had hoped to make that plain in the bio, but maybe I should touch up on that.<br><br>3. Yes, Ellis is supposed to be unlikable at first. That is the point of his character development. Also, I had hoped to have a lot of the comedy happen to him for a while. <br><br>4. That is a good point, the relationship between Wells and Bessie ought to show some kind of strain. It&#39;s only human for that to happen. Maybe... Naw, that won&#39;t work. I&#39;ll think of something.<br><br>5. She was meant to come from the real world. You&#39;re right, I forgot to include that in the bio. My bad.</p>

            <p>Now I&#39;m very confused.  This is probably a very silly question, but...<br><br>If Vivian Wells is from the real world, why does she have superspeed?  Maybe you haven&#39;t noticed this, but real people don&#39;t have that kind of superpower.  (At least, I don&#39;t think they do, do they?)<br><br>You hint that it might be connected with all the sweets she eats, but that&#39;s more likely to just make her fat, unless there&#39;s something <i>very </i>weird about the way her body&#39;s biochemistry reacts to sugar.  Although, since sugar can also apparently cure her clinical depression, maybe that is the case.<br><br>(If it really was that easy to cure depression, all the antidepressant manufacturers would&#39;ve gone bankrupt long ago!  I know from sad, personal experience that eating lots of sugar when you&#39;re clinically depressed just gives you the energy to convert your depression into random anger and aggression.)<br><br>Hmmmm...<br><br>There <i>might </i>be one specific type of people in the PPC&#39;s version of the real world who respond to sugar the way Vivian does.  Badfic writers often leave author&#39;s notes saying thing like, <b>&quot;AN: Soz this chapters so craaaazy but id just had sum sugar wren i rote it and i wz rly rly hyper!!!&quot;</b>  What if those excuses are true in the PPCverse?  And Badfic writers really do react strangely to sugar?<br><br>So... Vivian could be a former badfic writer who joined the PPC to make amends for all the bad stories she wrote when she was younger.<br><br>This would also the relationship between Vivian and Bessie.  Bessie is from a fic that Vivian wrote, so Vivian feels a sort of motherly affection towards Bessie.  That&#39;s why she&#39;s forgiven her for infecting Agent Plank.  And, of course, you&#39;ll have the humour of someone with the personality of a hyperactive 12-year-old wanting to act like a protective mother to someone who is emotionally more mature than her.  (Especially if Bessie doesn&#39;t know why she&#39;s doing it!)<br><br>However, that&#39;s only a suggestion and it probably doesn&#39;t fit in with any of your other ideas, so just ignore it and go with something better instead.<br></p>

            <p>Ah, now I see why they&#39;re so short. I believe the 200-400 words limit was intended to be for the character descriptions, and not the writing samples. Also, perhaps I simply haven&#39;t noticed it, but I don&#39;t remember any of the &#39;Sue agents being &quot;re-engineered&quot; before. Honestly, it almost comes off as creepy. The way you&#39;ve described it, it sounds like we&#39;re brainwashing the poor thing, then traumatizing her so she&#39;ll accept the brainwashing. I mean, we traumatize everyone here, but the brainwashing thing is a bit off. Hopefully, I just misunderstand what you&#39;re trying to convey.</p>

            <p>At least, if you&#39;re going to enforce the &#39;max. 400&#39; bit. I think that&#39;s fine for a character bio, which is just supposed to be a summary anyway, but seems like it&#39;d be quite restrictive for the actual writing sample. Not that I think it&#39;s a bad idea to have word limits on the samples, but I think the bios and the sample should have different limits (at least in terms of the maximum allowed). <br><br>For reference, my own Permission piece was just over 2500 words. While it was an extended scene that I could&#39;ve shorter, I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d have been able to show off my characters <i>and</i> that I understood the PPC universe sufficiently well if I&#39;d been limited to 400 words. </p>

            <p>... the whole process is still in &#39;open beta&#39;. ;)<br><br>I understand what you&#39;re saying, and it&#39;s true that the numbers in that section are essentially random - but I also think that a shorter story is better. Remember, you&#39;ve already given us a bio, so we know <i>who</i> your characters are - we&#39;re trying to see that you can <i>write</i> them, too.<br><br>I think there&#39;s a balance to be struck, too, between &#39;what&#39;s useful&#39; and &#39;what won&#39;t turn people off&#39;. If we say (for instance) &#39;You must write two 1000-word stories to be considered for Permission&#39;, we&#39;re heading back into Pippa&#39;s &#39;exam&#39; territory - that&#39;s more than a day of NaNo, for Aule&#39;s sake!<br><br>That said, the stories of mine which I think of as analogous to the samples are up around 800 words... hrm. What about a &#39;guideline&#39; of 400-800, with a note that you can go higher or lower if you feel like it - but watch out for on the one hand, not giving enough to work on, and on the other, waffling?<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Okay, blind test time. I&#39;ve rolled myself up a prompt, 5-6:<br><br><i>The agents discuss their career plans (current or past).<br><br>OR<br><br>One agent tries to impersonate a Flower.</i><br><br>And this is what I think would constitute a decent writing sample:<br><br>-----<br><br>&quot;Department of Operations, Building Maintenance Division. Whaddaya want?&quot;<br><br>I glanced at Lou, still leaning against the wall, and she nodded cheerfully. Taking a deep breath, I bent over the microphone.<br><br>&quot;<i>This is the Really Big Monkey Puzzle Tree,</i>&quot; I said, putting on my best breathy &#39;Flower&#39; voice, and trying to give off a feel of being large, spikey, and wooden. &quot;<i>I require your assistance in-</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Quit joking around,&quot; the voice from Building Maintenance said. &quot;Do you need anything or not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er, no,&quot; I managed, dropping back into my normal voice. &quot;Sorry. It... sorry.&quot; I hit the switch to cut the circuit, then turned and glared at my partner.<br><br>&quot;You <i>knew</i> that was going to happen.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, Narto,&quot; Lou said, grinning, &quot;of course I did. I <i>always</i> know.&quot; She flicked her head slightly in the direction of the ceiling.<br><br>I looked up at the Generic Surface, and at the massive yellow-black stain that covered half of it. &quot;Fine,&quot; I grumbled, &quot;be like that. But have <i>you</i> got a better idea for getting it cleaned?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Always.&quot; Lou pushed off the wall and vanished into the bathroom, returning a moment later with a black towel. &quot;There you go, get to work.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... this is <i>my</i> towel.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And it was your experiment,&quot; Lou said. &quot;Come on, Narto, keep up.&quot;<br><br>-----<br><br>That&#39;s 215 words (possible a little less, depending on how Word dealt with the HTML), but it shows a) that I can write properly, b) how my agents interact, c) that I can make something of the prompt other than a literal &#39;Ho ho, see my impersonation&#39;, and d) that I can make use of PPC concepts. (That was Colt in BM, by the way, since he was given to me. A bit cheeky, I know)<br><br>We&#39;re <i>not</i> trying to conduct an evaluation of every aspect of your skill at writing. Those four things are what we&#39;re looking for - and you don&#39;t need thousands of words to do it.<br><br>Still, I&#39;m (thankfully!) not Permission Dictator General. If we can generate a discussion, I&#39;ll update the document with the consensus version.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Aside from all of that: I don&#39;t think we&#39;d &#39;enforce&#39; the word limit, no. Part of the PPC&#39;s Thing is taking ideas and running with them - we could hardly say no to a &#39;I started writing this and it kept taking me really interesting places!&#39;, could we?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Definitely at least 400, maybe 500 words each. Any less than that may come off as a bit of a shallow effort. 800 is probably a good upper signpost (unless you&#39;re turning it into a full interlude, in which case, cool).<br><br>For a counter-example, <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/lok/intro.html">this writing sample</a>, which could be a response to &quot;the agents receive a mission&quot; and which I enjoy quite a bit (not sure if in spite of or because of fourth-wall-pushing meta), is 775 words according to the Word Count Tool add-on I have for Firefox. It could be a little shorter, perhaps, but it&#39;s not <i>long</i> by any means, and it feels more like a complete, solid narrative, with multiple exchanges between the characters. They feel more whole and grounded to me than Narto and Lou in your example, possibly because they were given more space to breathe. They don&#39;t feel like vehicles for a punchline, whereas Narto and Lou in this instance do. In the absence of any description or particularly defining mannerisms, you could probably swap in any two names, and it would still work as well. (<span style="font-size:0.8em;">Also you inserted a paragraph break between two of Narto&#39;s lines and it was confusing because I was expecting a change of speaker. &gt;.&gt;</span> )<br><br>So yeah, I&#39;d rather see longer writing samples.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First up, a 2:1 consensus is still a consensus, so I&#39;ve changed the doc. And actually, since it&#39;s Friday already, I&#39;ll be rolling it out onto the Wiki tonight. People are already using it, so that&#39;s not going to change anything - and I&#39;ll leave the table open for comments at the same address!<br><br>As to my &#39;sample&#39;... well, for one, I object (StReNuOuSlY1!1) to the idea that you could swap in any two names. In fact, let&#39;s do it and see!<br><br>-----<br><br>&quot;Department of Operations, Building Maintenance Division. Whaddaya want?&quot;<br><br>Selene glanced at Dafydd, still leaning against the wall, and he nodded cheerfully. Taking a deep breath, Selene bent over the microphone.<br><br>&quot;This is the Really Big Monkey Puzzle Tree,&quot; the vampire said, putting on her best breathy &#39;Flower&#39; voice, and trying to give off a feel of being large, spikey, and wooden. &quot;I require your assistance in-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Quit joking around,&quot; the voice from Building Maintenance said. &quot;Do you need anything or not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er, no,&quot; Selene managed, dropping back into her normal voice. &quot;Sorry.

Not just the situation as a whole - the <i>words</i>. You know, without even having to ask, how Selene would react to someone telling her to use her towel to clean the RC, and it ain&#39;t pretty. Narto, though, is submissive enough to potentially do it (though honestly, I suspect Lou will stop him before he actually ruins his towel).<br><br>More to the point, you say &#39;in the absence of any description&#39;. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not suggesting that every writing sample - which are given in concert with a bio which contains a physical description - must state the colour of every character&#39;s hair and eyes, their general body shape, etc etc. But since there <i>was</i> a fair amount of movement in the story, can you clarify what you <i>are</i> suggesting? I&#39;m a little lost.<br><br>But apart from <i>all</i> that... from what you&#39;re saying, I get the feeling you&#39;re wanting the writing samples to be complete stories - ie, you could come into them cold, with no supporting material, and &#39;get&#39; them in their entirety. (Actually, that&#39;s not interpretation, is it? You said &#39;feels more like a complete, solid narrative&#39;) But... why? That means our requirement to get permission to write PPC stories is no longer &#39;you must be able to spell&#39;, but &#39;you must have written two complete stories set in the PPC universe which pass muster with your Permission Giver&#39;. That&#39;s a very high bar to set for a universe we <i>want</i> people to write in - and to learn to improve their writing <i>while</i> writing in.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>That was a lot of words (again!) so I&#39;ll close with a suggestion. How about we give the Control Prompt a high wordcount (500-1000), and an explicitly stated expectation that it be a complete story - ie, what people were doing anyway. But then we give the <i>random</i> prompt a low count (300-500), and state that it&#39;s expected to be a snapshot - ie, <i>not</i> a complete story. It&#39;s something that could be a scene in a mission or interlude, not a comprehensive story in itself.<br><br>That would mean our control prompts gave something like <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1o8dLTTkC_q7Pr9tJj89rU3GB558agIaQvzMvgc0YGzE">this</a> - Dafydd&#39;s introduction (which clocks in at around 600 words) - while the random prompts would be something more like <i>one partner apologises to the other</i>:<br><br>-----<br><br>Dafydd wandered back to the response centre, meandering through the grey corridors, idly dreaming his dreams. Of course, as he was in no hurry to arrive at his destination, he was there within seconds. Opening the door, he stepped through and was greeted by the sight of someone he hadn’t seen in a long time.<br><br>Selene was slumped in the corner of the room, looking more tired than Dafydd had ever seen her before. Still, she was still glaring at him, and he did have a crossbow aimed at his head so she was obviously still mostly herself. Dafydd’s well-honed preservation instincts kicked in.<br><br>“I’msorryI’msorryI’msorrywhateverIdidIdidn’tmeantodoitpleasedon’tkillme!”<br><br>Selene raised an eyebrow at this performance and then put her crossbow down next to her, checking that the safety catch was on. Dafydd took this as a good sign and inched further into the room, Thanduril flapping forward to meet him. The two agents stared at each other before Selene broke the silence and said, “I’m sorry I shot at you. Thank you for the crossbow, anyway; it was a thoughtful gift.”<br><br>Dafydd relaxed a bit more. Remembering Vemi’s reaction to what he said he had done, he felt as if he should apologise again.<br>“I’m sorry for whatever I did wrong, I didn’t mean to do anything worthy of being shot at.”<br><br>Selene closed her eyes and breathed in deeply, trying to regain her composure. The skills of self-control she had honed over centuries had been severely atrophied over the past month, and she did not want to lose those skills completely. She replied, “As a note for the future, if I come back from having a mutant plant lecture me on restraint and camaraderie, threaten me with even more probation, send me for counselling and group therapy, and <i>then</i> reveal that my food has been drugged for at least six weeks, it’s not a good idea to say, ‘Oh, you got off lightly.’”<br><br>Dafydd winced, and was about to apologise again when he was cut off by the sound of a plot device masquerading as the console.<br><br>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]<br><br>-----<br><br>Taken from the opening of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1kFSzuBR7gx7XO_go9qR_FvAle2v-yLOrDmO7dcRzVOo">Echoes of the Narbeleth</a>, and clocking at around 350 words.<br><br>Thoughts?

            <p>You can&#39;t swap in any two names—definitely not if they belong to established and well-known characters. That was unfair of me. I&#39;m sorry.<br><br>What I was trying to say was that, if I didn&#39;t know who Lou and Natro were, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be able to pick them out of a crowd based on that particular example of them interacting. Since the writing samples are supposed to show us who these people are, that could be a problem for me in a real sample.<br><br>That said, you are also right that the bio should do at least some of the work on that front; the writing sample should corroborate what&#39;s been laid out in the bio. If it does (did? would? Damn hypothetical tenses...), then I suppose I&#39;d be okay with it in the absence of any other problems.<br><br>What I&#39;m looking for... lemme ramble for a few paragraphs and see if I can figure it out.<br><br>&quot;Complete stories&quot; isn&#39;t right, because as you say, we don&#39;t want to set the bar to ridiculous. I&#39;m not looking for &quot;beginning, rising action, climax, denouement, end&quot; or any other traditional structure you care to name.<br><br>&quot;Complete&quot; is, though. For instance, I kinda want to know what experiment Narto was doing that caused the stain—then I could identify him as &quot;that guy who does X kinds of experiments in his RC.&quot; In Dark Brother&#39;s second sample, I want to see the actual planning for the actual party—as it is, it&#39;s just &quot;Hey, can I plan a party? Yes? Good!&quot; The End. It starts something, but doesn&#39;t finish it.<br><br>The requirement for Permission isn&#39;t merely &quot;Can you spell?&quot; It&#39;s more like &quot;Can you write interesting characters, in a setting recognizable as the PPC, in an entertaining style that is free from (serious, preferably any) mechanical/structural and logistic errors?&quot;<br><br>The thing about short stories/vignettes/snapshots is that every word must have a reason to be there, so in a sense they&#39;re harder to write well than longer pieces. I think this is where I&#39;m coming from. If I only have a few hundred words to look at, I&#39;m inclined to analyze every single one for all the information I can possibly glean. If those few words don&#39;t amount to something whole and wholly pleasing, it&#39;s hard to cut them much slack.<br><br>So, there it is: asking a short piece or two to prove the writer&#39;s ability to construct a full story is placing a lot of weight on narrow shoulders. Whatever we ask for a writing sample needs to be big and strong enough to bear it. A short work needs to be completely solid through and through, and it needs to accomplish something, else what hope is there that they can pull off a longer, more complex work?<br><br>The length isn&#39;t really that important. It&#39;s what the author can <i>do</i> with whatever space they have to work with. I wouldn&#39;t want to force anyone to pad an idea to achieve a word count, but on the other hand, I don&#39;t want to put people in an impossible box with a too-small sample.<br><br>Maybe different suggested counts for the different prompts would help. Other opinions would be good, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh, rambling on.</p>

            <p><i>Can you write interesting characters, in a setting recognizable as the PPC, in an entertaining style that is free from (serious, preferably any) mechanical/structural and logistic errors?</i><br><br>That seems like the sort of quote that should appear in the Wiki article or the doc: an actual description of what we&#39;re looking for. And I agree with it in every respect. (That said, we also need to make it clear that &#39;interesting character&#39; doesn&#39;t mean &#39;quirks&#39;; Narto is/can be interesting despite being Just Some Guy)<br><br>I also agree - I guess - about &#39;complete&#39;. You&#39;re not talking about complete <i>as a story</i>, but as an <i>idea</i>. I think it&#39;s very hard to quantify - basically everything falls into scope if you pull the viewpoint back far enough - but the notion that, for instance, you shouldn&#39;t end on a &#39;here&#39;s what we&#39;ll do&#39; cliffhanger in a sample - because we&#39;ll never actually hear what it <i>is</i>. It&#39;s great for some types of story, but here we want to know the idea - it informs the character.<br><br>The &#39;experiment&#39;, by the way, was a chemical one - that was an implicit assumption on my part, because that&#39;s how I think of the word, not an intentional omission. It&#39;s actually one we did at school, and wrecked the ceiling - I believe it may have been the reaction of iodine with aluminium. It produces a <i>huge</i> cloud of purple smoke, and leaves a horrible yellow stain. I&#39;m guessing Nar remembered it like I did, and couldn&#39;t resist trying it when he found out (by accident) what the chemicals were. ;)<br><br>As usual - and as expected - I feel you&#39;re being too strict about how much a sample should accomplish, but I do at least think we&#39;re in the same chapter, if not the same page.

            <p>Going back to your &#39;impersonation&#39; prompt, while your point about not being able to just swap any old names in is certainly true, I think Nesh is right in that some names could be swapped in. The piece is just so short that that we get bare snippets of characterisation, which makes them more interchangeable with A. N. Other. <br><br>My own agents could probably swap in without going too far out of character. Skeet would replace Narto (committing some random act of vandalism in his RC and then trying to get out cleaning it up is 100% in character for him), leaving Amy to take Lou&#39;s place. That&#39;s trickier for her, but if we assume this is an Amy that&#39;s been with the PPC for a bit, and gotten used to her partner, then it more or less fits. <br><br>The two bits that would stand out would be her &#39;nodding cheerfully&#39; at the beginning, because I think that makes it look like the impersonation was her idea and she was encouraging Skeet to do it - the idea is silly enough that it&#39;d be one of Skeet&#39;s, and he really doesn&#39;t need the encouragement. However, some context (which the sample is currently missing, and possibly links in with the intention that the sample should be a complete idea, even though it&#39;s not supposed to be a complete story) could provide an explanation - maybe just before he picked up the phone Skeet bet a week&#39;s worth of chores that he could get the mess cleaned up without any effort. In which case Amy would quite happily encourage him to do something she was sure wouldn&#39;t work. <br><br>The other bit that&#39;s a little off (for my character) is the line &#39;&quot;Oh, Skeet,&quot; Amy said, grinning, &quot;of course I did. I always know.&quot;&#39;, mostly because of the implied omniscience, which isn&#39;t really Amy&#39;s thing. However, changing the wording to &#39;of course I did. <i>Anyone </i> would&#39;ve known that!&#39; preserves most of the same character interaction, and keeps her in character. <br><br>There was one bit that stuck out to me while reading that piece: <br><br><i>&quot;Oh, Narto,&quot; Lou said, grinning, &quot;of course I did. I always know.&quot; She flicked her head slightly in the direction of the ceiling.<br><br>I looked up at the Generic Surface, and at the massive yellow-black stain that covered half of it.</i><br><br>I honestly can&#39;t tell if Lou looking up here is meant to be a hint of the power mentioned in her bio, or just that the stain happens to be on the ceiling. And if I can&#39;t tell the difference between an explicitly stated character trait and a coincidence... well, then, you&#39;ve kind of failed at presenting the character to me. I just think the scene is too short and light on detail. Going into more depth would better showcase your talent. <br><br>In contrast, your &#39;apology&#39; piece just seems better. Is it just coincidence that I think the longer piece is better? Well, maybe, but I don&#39;t think so.<br><br>With regards to your earlier comment concerning the necessity of character descriptions when they&#39;re presented along with a bio, I&#39;d like to see at least a little bit of description in the sample, unless there&#39;s a particular reason not to. It depends a little on which style of character bio is used - the list style that Lou&#39;s currently using on the GDoc is fine for a bio, but would be really jarring if it was just dropped into the narrative like that. Giving good written descriptions is a skill, I think, so it&#39;d be a useful thing to see in a sample. I&#39;ve also read enough badfic where the author has assumed that everyone is familiar with how the characters look (more common for fic of TV/films) and hasn&#39;t bothered to give any, that I tend to think of a lack of such descriptions as a sign of poor writing. <br><br>My thought on the word limit was to keep the minimum at 200 (if someone thinks they can do a good enough job with a piece that short, I don&#39;t see why they shouldn&#39;t try. I just know that I&#39;d need to write something longer to feel like I&#39;d done it properly) and raise the maximum to 1000, just because you tend to stick to round numbers for this sort of thing, and a thousand feels like a &#39;rounder&#39; number than eight hundred to me. <br><br>As for your comment about not enforcing the word limit, well, this is just my opinion, but if you&#39;re not going to enforce it, why bother even mentioning it? If you want to give some advice on length without being restrictive then I&#39;d call it a guideline rather than a word limit (pedantic I know, but to me &#39;max. word limit X&#39; means that someone who writes X+1 should be getting marked down). <br><br>I&#39;m also wondering if we should encourage people to use Betas for Permission samples a little more. I don&#39;t recall seeing Dark Brother 16 ask for one, and no Beta credit was given, so I&#39;m assuming he didn&#39;t use one. But it strikes me that a lot of the reasons you gave for denying Permission (particularly on the second attempt) could&#39;ve been spotted by someone else before taking it to the Official Request stage.<br></p>

            <p>That was <i>deliberately</i> ambiguous. Lou is making use of one gesture to do two things - indicate the problem, and reference <i>why</i> she always knows. So if you can&#39;t tell which it is - good! That was the point. ;)<br><br>hS, will reply longer when he has more time</p>

            <p>... well, two things. One is that there&#39;s only a very small sample size - 20-odd Permission requests in the last sixteen months. But more than that, it&#39;s the circumstances under which we&#39;ll each respond.<br><br>For instance, I&#39;m the only one of the lot of us who&#39;ll really reply with a &#39;don&#39;t know; someone else check&#39;. When that happens, you&#39;re likely to be the second responder - and you&#39;ll probably say no to something I wasn&#39;t sure about. ;) So that bumps your &#39;no&#39;s up.<br><br>And, as you said, you do a lot of the &#39;<i>duh</i> no&#39; responding (although I have a relatively recent &#39;I&#39;d like Permission, can I have it?&#39; one I replied to). So again, that bumps your average up.<br><br>And, well, Phobos only has three responses in the timeframe. It&#39;s not exactly a statistically significant sample. One more might mean he&#39;s perfectly balanced - or that he has a 3:1 ratio of yes to no. It&#39;s all in the maths.<br><br>I wonder what it&#39;ll look like when I get back to Jan &#39;12...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Older Permission requests might not be the best source, especially before the practice of writing a story within the PPC world became the standard practice. At one point that was kind of frowned on before getting Permission. I like the shift, as this method gives a better view of how someone writes in the rather unusual PPC setting. </p>

So, hypothetically, the person who sprays this liquid trust on themselves will appear more trustworthy to other people.<br><br>Now, isn&#39;t that like Aura of Smooth, or what?</p>

            <p>Oxytocin isn&#39;t just a cuddle/trust/romance hormone. It&#39;s also associated with prejudice--with loyalty to your own group and hostility to others. In some experiments, oxytocin exposure raised the amount of punishment that test subjects were willing to impose on out-group members.<br><br>So not only does it make you want to bond with someone... it makes you want to hurt everybody else.<br><br>Is Aura of Smooth oxytocin? I&#39;d say--no. But, like a lot of drugs, Aura of Smooth probably works on oxytocin receptors, at least in cases where the species involved has them, or an analogue of them. It&#39;s an artificial substance, much stronger, that was never meant to be in the brains of the poor canons to begin with. It&#39;s not like the gentle feelings of attachment that oxytocin brings. Aura of Smooth creates more of an addiction and an inability to think for oneself. It is literary parasitism.<br><br>But Sues do even more than that. They can influence even characters who are incapable of attachment. They can romance Voldemort, force normally sociopathic characters to care about them, and even entrance robots, aliens, and inanimate objects. Their influence isn&#39;t a matter of simple chemistry--they warp the story directly. A Mary Sue isn&#39;t just a simple parasite; she&#39;s a reality-warping eldritch abomination.</p>

            <p>It might be real oxytocin, but you&#39;re not going to get any kind of dose from just being around someone who&#39;s sprayed it on themselves. To administer oxytocin, you would need to use an oxytocin nasal spray on yourself. It&#39;s a human hormone, so it&#39;s supposed to be in your body. If you want to know what oxytocin feels like, just go cuddle a kitten or kiss your significant other. The &quot;You&#39;re all mine and I want to hold you close&quot; feeling?

            <p>That sounds pretty close. But since Aura of Smooth warps the characters&#39; thought processes so all they can think about is the Sue while in her vicinity, I&#39;m thinking there&#39;s some Glitter involved in the genuine article.

            <p>I mean, they&#39;re still capable of cooing over a cute mini, falling in love with each other, or getting protective of the canon or the stories they love. All that stuff floods your brain with oxytocin. Strangely enough, so would killing the Mary Sue--oxytocin is all about bonding, and it&#39;s involved in hostility to things that are outside your group. In this case, it&#39;s involved in killing a Mary Sue that&#39;s attacking the story you love.<br><br>Agents&#39; brains use oxytocin just fine--but when they see a Mary Sue, any increased oxytocin activity would be more of the &quot;protect my turf; defend my friends&quot; variety.</p>

            <p>And, in my case, rather counterproductive: unless the new films are <i>really good</i>, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be buying any of the &#39;new canon&#39; novels. Since I own a fairly high percentage of the, uh, &#39;legends&#39; novels, that&#39;s a big shift. Oh well, maybe they&#39;ll keep publishing new &#39;legends&#39; alongside it.<br><br>As far as the PPC goes... well, we have six <i>Star Wars</i> missions listed, and, er, <i>none</i> of them are set in the EU. In fact, they&#39;re all Prequel Trilogy-inspired. So I don&#39;t think our written agents will be running into problems. ;)<br><br>But what do we call the two canons? &#39;Bookverse&#39; and &#39;Movieverse&#39; worked for LotR, but won&#39;t here - the EU is canon with the first six films, and the new films will produce books of their own. And we can hardly call one &#39;canon&#39; - that&#39;s far too non-specific. It seems clear we&#39;re going to have to peg the label &#39;Legends[verse]&#39; on the EU - how about &#39;Disneyverse&#39; for the new canon? Or simply &#39;Newverse&#39;?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This has already been pretty well addressed, but I will add that in the Original Series, Jay and Acacia frequently distinguish between &#39;bookverse&#39; and &#39;movieverse&#39;, implying that either is acceptable to the PPC. Besides, all the EU stuff is published and therefore part of *a* canon, if not necessarily the *main* canon. So it actually doesn&#39;t affect anything (though you may be able to charge for mixing canons).</p>

            <p>I even work with canons where that is a major, major issue, and it never crossed my mind this morning!<br><br>I remember also (now that I am thinking) that there is discussion of which one is considered primary? There was some video game that was used as an example for this. Maybe Resident Evil or Castlevania. Tolkien works well though for the discussion. The written materials can always influence what we know about the movies. If there are details not otherwise specified in the movies, it defaults to what is written. However, in a case where the movie adds <s>random crap</s> information to canon that information can only apply to the movie!verse. It doesn&#39;t reverse influence.<br><br>I&#39;d see the Star Wars EU the same way, only the movies are first and the primary canon. The movies can influence and over write the EU, but the EU can&#39;t go over the movies.<br><br>So, totally a long-winded way of saying, I totally agree with you. ;)</p>

            <p>As far as the PPC is concerned, once something is published/released/whatever, it&#39;s <em>a</em> canon. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s overridden by later canon, it&#39;s still a published work that needs protecting (and thus a Word World which can affect PPC history - so the Mysterious Somebody doesn&#39;t retroactively cease to exist). Though combining elements of two contradictory works could be a charge, I guess (maybe even a job for Implausible Crossovers, come to think of it).<br>As far as Star Wars goes (this isn&#39;t just aimed at you, Miah), there have always been &quot;levels&quot; of canonicity in that franchise. The new films shouldn&#39;t necessitate a change in PPC procedure.<br>Bleh. That ended up sounding condescending, but I can&#39;t think of any other way to put it. :-/<br>And, Miah: I think it would reverse influence unless directly contradicted by the original material. Alternatively, there&#39;s no cross-influence and the different media constitute separate Word Worlds. Though calling a film a &quot;Word World&quot; is rather counterintuitive. (And the spell-check doesn&#39;t recognise &#39;canonicity&#39; or &#39;counterintuitive&#39;. Or &#39;recognise&#39;, apparently.)</p>

            <p>Basically, the movies, the Clone Wars CGI series, Rebels and the new book that&#39;s soon to come out are canon. Everything else is &#39;legends&#39;.

            <p>Or rather, slight thread hijack because creating another thread would be pointless and a waste of space.<br><br>I&#39;m currently trying to write a bit of fanfiction, based in the Dresden Files universe, far away from Chicago and Harry Dresden, and indeed most characters we know, although references will be made, (for any of you wondering where in the series it takes place it&#39;s somewhere between Dead Beat and Turn Coat). <br><br>Anyway, the question I&#39;m trying to ask, is does anyone have any idea roughly how old an apprentice has to be before they are allowed into the White Council as a wizard?

            <p>...but that seems about right, going by evidence in-canon.<br><br>Let&#39;s list the facts we have:<br><br>-Harry joined the Council at sixteen, but he was special circumstances. And he thought he&#39;d be training with DuMorne for tenish years, IIRC.<br><br>-Molly... well, Ghost Story happened, and then Cold Days, so I don&#39;t think she ever became a Council wizard, though she&#39;s certainly not Harry&#39;s apprentice anymore.<br><br>-Carlos was an apprentice in Summer Knight and Regional Commander of the Wardens in Dead Beat, and he was, I think, twenty-five-ish then, so that adds evidence.<br><br>I can&#39;t think of anyone else, but I don&#39;t have any of the books, so I could very well be blanking.

            <p>He wasn&#39;t named in Summer Knight, but if you read the scene with the Council, he&#39;s the brown-robed apprentice hiding a grin when Harry starts mouthing off at said body of wizards.

            <p><s>Obviously, the Mysterious Somebody retroactively never existed and PPC history has fallen apart! Oh no!</s><br><br>Honestly, it doesn&#39;t seem to be a much different status than the EU already enjoyed; Lucas was already vocal about considering the movies the only &quot;real&quot; canon for example, and as much as he was happy to support the EU he&#39;s said on multiple occasions that he never even reads it. The announcement says that while the EU&#39;s status is being changed, it&#39;s not being dismissed, and it&#39;s open for the &quot;new&quot; canon to explore as much as they want, with most of the famous stuff running under the Legends banner. <br><br>From the perspective of the PPC, the post-ROTJ EU - which seems to mostly be the only stuff affected so far - at worst seems like it&#39;ll have turned into a subcanon or alternate universe, which can still be travelled into and stuff. Maybe we&#39;ll suddenly have to start charging for old EU stuff being treated as canon, once the new canon exists to contradict it? But it&#39;s hardly Armageddon.</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s probably safe to assume that a lot of the smaller side stories of the EU will escape largely unscathed. I would think that in this case it might be best to go with, &#39;it&#39;s canon until it isn&#39;t.&#39; If that makes sense? <br><br>Like Wedge Antilles. If he&#39;s never mentioned in the new stuff, then what is there to say that the reports from the EU that have him continuing to pilot an X-wing and eventually get promoted to General and be in charge of several groups of X-wings is not what happened to him?<br><br>As long as he isn&#39;t specifically mentioned in the new canon materials, it makes sense to just take the EU stuff about him as his canon.<br><br>Where it gets complicated is when one of those side stories does have something potentially significant. Wedge did help take down Coruscant, and that is a pretty big event that might well get contradicted in the new movies. In which case, does that throw out <i>all</i> of his canon from EU, or only that part of it?</p>

            <p>An interesting phenomenon that I&#39;ve observed in series (mostly trilogies), is that the last installment always seems to be worse, or at least more badly-reviewed, than the others. A good example of this would be the Divergent Trilogy; I&#39;ve read the first two, I liked them and they were well-reviewed, but the third (Allegiant) is badly reviewed, with the reviewers claiming way-too-overdone and needless tragedy and sacrifice, the bad guys getting the good ending, and Un-logic.<br><br>So, what happens? Do authors spontaneously lose the ability to write when it comes time for the finale? <br><br>My current theory is that it&#39;s the same as always, but the audience has higher expectations for a series finale, and so the author tends to fall short, but still.

            <p>She said it was like writing an essay the night before it&#39;s due. You start at like, 7, and you&#39;re still pretty awake and you have plenty of time, so you can perfect it and do your best work. Then it&#39;s like, 9 and you&#39;re starting to get a little stressed but not too bad. You&#39;re not doing your best, but it&#39;s not terrible. Then it&#39;s midnight, and you&#39;ve just got to get this essay done because if you don&#39;t you fail the class and you&#39;re just trying to do it as fast as possible.<br><br>The thing with Hunger Games and Divergent is that they both have huge, potentially obnoxious fanbases that want the new book as soon as possible. In fact, I think fandom&#39;s inability to deal with hiatuses is a problem. There&#39;s a difference between &quot;I can&#39;t wait I love this show/book/franchise!&quot; and &quot;They need to get the new season out soon or the fandom&#39;s going to go insane!&quot; (shout out to the Sherlock fandom). I&#39;m digressing a little, but there&#39;s  this general mentality of &quot;I want it now!&quot; that businesses -like the publishing business - pick up on.<br><br>Interestingly enough, one of the FAQs on Rick Riordan&#39;s website is &quot;Could you get the books out faster?&quot;. The response is that he&#39;s trying to make sure they&#39;re good. And I haven&#39;t met a Rick Riordan book I haven&#39;t liked.<br><br>That&#39;s not the only factor, but I think the others have been more thoroughly discussed already.</p>

            <p>Having read all of the Hunger Games trilogy, and the first two Divergent books, I have a different idea.<br><br>A lot of the time, the scope of a series will start off small. In <i>Divergent</i>, we&#39;re mostly concerned with a single factor; even in <i>Insurgent</i>, we&#39;re looking at one city (and practically ignoring the existence of the outside world). Similarly, in <i>The Hunger Games</i> and <i>Catching Fire</i>, the scope is mostly limited to &#39;teenager fights in arena&#39;. Yes, there are hints of more, but they&#39;re just that - hints, things taking place which our protagonist doesn&#39;t take (much) part in.<br><br>And then, for the finale, the scope widens explosively. That definitely happens in <i>Mockingjay</i>, and the conclusion of <i>Insurgent</i> suggests <i>Allegiant</i> will go the same way. Which means... well, partly that the fans are getting a distinctly different book to the last two, but partly also that the <i>author</i> is working outside their comfort zone. To pick another (non-trilogy) example: J.K. Rowling spent six books writing about a school, then wrote the last book as an epic quest. There were complaints about that on this very Board.<br><br>I think to a large extent this is local to young-adult fiction - or at least fiction starring young adults. They quite deliberately start with a &#39;teenagers think [small thing] is the most important thing EVER&#39; approach, and build up to &#39;then the world ends and they&#39;re involved&#39;. The 74th Hunger Games, the Dauntless initiation, finding the Philosopher&#39;s Stone - those were all pretty much business as usual for Panem, Chicago, and Hogwarts (respectively). But the finales? Those were world-changing events - or, in the case of <i>Allegiant</i>, seem set to be.<br><br>And a lot of the time, the author can&#39;t cope. I&#39;ve not read <i>Deathly Hallows</i>, but a fair number of people here disliked it for just that reason. <i>Mockingjay</i> is my least favourite of the Hunger Games series - though I do still enjoy it. (I actually really disliked the Divergent Trilogy, but that&#39;s another story).<br><br>So what&#39;s the solution? Simple: make the shift <i>before</i> the last book. I&#39;ll use another YA series - Percy Jackson.<br><br>In <i>Lightning Thief</i>, we&#39;re fairly small-scale. Three teenagers go on a road trip across America. Yes, the stakes are high, but the <i>scope</i> is small. In <i>Sea of Monsters</i>, we have two sets of teens, plus a villain who&#39;s actively out to get them. <i>Titan&#39;s Curse</i> expands the group, and introduces literal world-changing with the raising of Othrys, and also threatens the gods directly. <i>Battle of the Labyrinth</i> starts off as a quest, but turns into... well, a battle.<br><br>So by the time of <i>Last Olympian</i>, we&#39;re already primed for a big, all-out fight. If the first four books had just consisted of &#39;go on a quest, find the thing, try to thwart the villains along the way&#39;, <i>Last Olympian</i> would have been as big a shift as <i>Mockingjay</i> was. And yes, that goes for both the readers - we wouldn&#39;t have been ready for the change - and the author. If you&#39;ve written two or four fundamentally-similar books, writing a completely different last one is <i>hard</i>.<br><br>Another example: <i>Lord of the Rings</i> (of course). <i>Fellowship</i> has a very small scope - them, not to the world. In <i>Two Towers</i>, though, we see the build-up - Aragorn starts out as a Ranger chasing orcs, but finishes the book leading a battle. That primes us for the big battles of <i>Return of the King</i>. If the Hornburg hadn&#39;t happened, or had happened off-screen - if Aragorn had travelled to Edoras, then ridden straight to Isengard - the battles in the final volume would have come pretty much out of nowhere.<br><br>Too many words, nowt left to say; stopping now.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...is that, in my estimation, it does start looking towards expanding its scope part of the way through <i>Catching Fire</i>, at least through some of its world-building. I don&#39;t know, I felt like the hints dropped about District 13 still being around at the start of Part 2 started expanding the world, and I feel like the victory tour did the same thing there. And then, you know, there&#39;s the whole fact of Katniss spending most of the 74th Hunger Games either alone or with only one other person to help her out (Rue or Peeta, depending on when in the games we&#39;re looking at); I think it starts providing a sense of widening scope considering that she then gets into an alliance with five other people part of the way through <i>Catching Fire</i>.<br><br>So to me, there is a sense of build-up in <i>Catching Fire</i>. I don&#39;t think it really happens enough, but I don&#39;t think that the widening of the scope is as sudden as you&#39;re suggesting.<br><br>And actually, that might actually help the film franchise, now that I think of it: since <i>Mockingjay</i> is being split into two movies, that might help the expansion of scope in a certain sense. I guess we&#39;ll wait to see what happens with that, but it could help the film franchise. And I used to be a skeptic of &quot;let&#39;s split Mockingjay into two movies&quot;!</p>

            <p>Is that it&#39;s Twilight but written as a ropey action movie rather than a ropey Mills and Boon-knockoff TV movie. None of it works for me, like, at all. This is partly because I find the whole &quot;last days of Rome&quot; thing they&#39;ve got going on to be extremely trite, and partly because the characters feel like cardboard cutouts. Same with Divergent, which is basically what happens when a YA author decides to try and adapt the storyline of a bad sci-fi RTS game.</p>

            <p>That is, that the initial installment is super well-received, but any and all sequels get panned.  I think this is because the (collective) audience enjoys being introduced to an entire new world at the beginning of the story.  The sequels, however, are showing us more of the same setting, and more of the same characters (for the most part), and for some reason, it just doesn&#39;t hold the audience&#39;s attention as well, even if the plot is still steamrolling forward.<br><br>I&#39;m specifically thinking of two examples here.  One is the <i>Matrix</i> series, where the first movie dedicates a huge amount of time to being inside the Matrix, where everyone is clean and pretty, in cool costumes and doing amazing, physics-defying fight scenes that had pretty much never been seen before.  The rest of the trilogy had that as well, no question, but not as much, and spent a lot more time in that universe&#39;s real world, where everyone is grimy, dressed in whatever they could sew together, and <i>eventually</i> having a fairly ordinary steampunk-leaning scifi shootout.  <s>And also having really gross sex scenes that are also dance montages somehow.</s>  I think part of the reason the <i>Matrix</i> sequels get panned is that they got more mainstream compared to all the newness of the original.  For the record, I love the entire trilogy, and don&#39;t really look at them as separate movies, but a single storyline that got split up.<br><br>The other example is <i>Lost</i>.  The first season was pretty much fantastic and amazing, and it threw at the audience two mysteries: &quot;What is going on on this island?&quot; and &quot;Who are these people?&quot;  The first question only got answered slowly, throughout the show&#39;s run (and only partly, really, because that was never the point of the show), but the second question was most heavily dealt with in season one.  Sure, new characters were introduced in later seasons that had new backstories and motives to show us, and not every secret of every season one character was revealed in season one, but I think all the later seasons suffered a bit for drifting away from the characters&#39; flashbacks and focusing more on the island&#39;s immediate action.<br><br>Focusing specifically on the finale aspect of this discussion, I think the last installment tends to suffer from this problem the most, having to focus more energy and time/space on the events that complete the story and less on new aspects of the world or characters.</p>

            <p>Tell that to my mom and brother. They watched the first matrix sequel, against my warnings, while I was gone, and when I next met my mom, I got the joy of being right because of something I came across on Tv Tropes. Apparently, the movie was so extremely cheesy and unrealistic that they both immediately became lactose intolerant. <br><br>The phrase we usually use to refer to the movies is: &quot;I can stand a little cheese, but that cheese was rancid!&quot;</p>

            <p>Audience expectation is definitely part of it, especially for a really popular series. People get invested in long-running stories. They craft a golden ending of their own in their head. That can sometimes lead to disappointment if reality doesn&#39;t match up with one&#39;s preconceived hopes.<br><br>Another aspect, as eatpraylove mentioned, is the difficulty in wrapping up a multi-part story conclusively. Character&#39;s fates need to be addressed. Plot lines need to reach a satisfactory end. Plot holes need to be filled. Failure to do so on the part of the author can result in a less than fulfilling conclusion.<br><br>Some of it might even be a bit of fan bitterness, if you&#39;ll allow a bit of speculation on my part. I&#39;m sure every trilogy has a few fans that are upset that the story is coming to an end at all. They&#39;re getting part of a story that they love, but they won&#39;t be getting any more after this point (unless the author changes his or her mind about continuing, of course.)<br><br>But there can be other reasons. Sometimes a multitude thereof. The original <i>Mass Effect 3</i> endings, for example, had both of the above issues plus internal mismanagement. Apparently, the endings were only written by one or two people and were not subject to the same collective peer reviews as the rest of the story. And thus a sizable fan outcry was born.</p>

            <p>Interesting idea. Tamora Pierce has written several fantasy quartets, most of them set in Tortall, and all the books in each quartet have been given good reviews/blurbs. Same thing with the Harry Potter series (or so I&#39;m told; I&#39;m only up to Order of the Phoenix myself).<br><br>On the other hand, my brother described &quot;Mockingjay&quot; as feeling rushed, like Ms. Collins just wanted to get the story other with. So maybe it&#39;s just hard to end a series conclusively or something? I don&#39;t know. (I think your high audience expectations theory makes sense, though.)</p>

            <p>Just a bit of fun.  Try and think up the <i>worst possible </i>pairs to ship.  Only restriction is that they must be pairs who could actually meet (i.e. both be from the same canon and time period).  Other than that, no restrictions.<br><br>I&#39;ll start with:<br><br>Oedipus and Antigone.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think Cap&#39;s exactly the kind of guy to not respect Spidey based on something like age, especially considering the fact that Bucky was even younger when he was Steve&#39;s sidekick. Now, I think the ship is still a bit wonky, but that&#39;s more because I tend to think Spidey has immense respect for Cap. I mean, Cap is as big of a legend in-universe as he is in real life. I imagine this would make Cap more of a mentor figure for Spidey than anything else.</p>

            <p>Yeah, Bucky was a lot younger than Steve when he was his sidekick. However, Bucky <i>died</i>. Sorta. And eventually became the Winter Soldier. In a way that&#39;s only <i>not</i> mind-meltingly stupid in the MCU. If you lose someone like that, when they&#39;re as young as that, in a war, when you&#39;re Steve Rogers (there&#39;s a reason the guy has a shield as his personal symbol)... it&#39;s going to affect you and your perception. Lest we forget, Spidey&#39;s young. He&#39;s, like, in his early twenties at most. I can&#39;t see Cap looking at someone that young and thinking &quot;Yup, that teenager should be in the most dangerous occupation in the known universe&quot; given what happened to Bucky.<br><br>As an aside, getting insurance in Marvel&#39;s New York must be hell on Earth.</p>

            <p>I have no idea why the meme isn&#39;t about Diglett and Wailord, honestly. Diglett is only eight inches tall, and Wailord is forty-seven feet. Diglett is never seen fully outside of its underground tunnels, while Wailord can barely move outside of the water. And yet, the two can breed, creating any number of baby Wailmer that know Fissure. Maybe the meme&#39;s not HDOWA because you couldn&#39;t find Diglett in Hoenn, where the main concentrations of Wailord and Wailmer are, but that seems like a small obstacle, especially since you&#39;ve been able to find them in the same region during other games.</p>

            <p>After all, it is a bunch of entries written by a ten-to-fifteen-year old in the middle of a stressful saving-the-world journey with very little knowledge of what the Pokémon are and do. Some of the numbers are way off(the famous &quot;Alakazam has an IQ that literally does not exist on the scale&quot; entry in most of the games comes to mind, along with the one you mentioned where Magcargo is almost hot enough to ignite the atmosphere), and some of the behaviors seem wildly out-of-place or extrapolated. Though I really do like the idea of a bunch of Cacturne gathering together and forming a roving gang of pursuit predators.<br><br>I still remember the answer when someone asked Masuda what Diglett looked like underneath. He said that officially, none of the development team had come up with a definitive answer, but he thought it was probably &quot;a hand or something&quot;. That is amazing. Diglett as this giant thumb poking up from underground, joined by the middle and index fingers when it evolves into Dugtrio. That makes just the right amount of no sense whatsoever to be absolutely hilarious.</p>
