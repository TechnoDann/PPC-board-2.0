            <p>I&#39;ve never actually played a Crash game, but I did play one of the PS1 Spyro games. I don&#39;t remember which one.

            <p>I have played some of the other Spyro games though, I think they were for the GBC and GBA, not 100% sure though, it was more my sisters kind of game. I was more into Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh, which had one hell of a confusing game on the PS1 if I remember correctly, can&#39;t remember what is was called but it was really hard to work out the controls and everything. </p>

            <p>The GBA spin-offs were pretty decent; at least, Spyro Orange and Attack of the Rhynocs were. Didn&#39;t play much of Season of Ice or Season of Fire (Flame?) before tiring of them, so I can&#39;t give much of an opinion.<br><br>Man, Pokemon was my jam as a kid!

            <p>I have every Crash game ever made and I love pretty much all of them. I do find Spyro the cuter protagonist, though. Maybe it&#39;s because I had a plushie version of him in my youth that I <i>definitely do not cuddle now when sad and/or drunk why would you even think that?</i></p>

            <p>Out of interest, when you say the &#39;original games&#39; do you mean the actual first ones that were released, or just the series in general from the Playstation era?<br><br>I started playing with Crash Bandicoot 2, although I did play a little of 1. I have vague memories of 1 being really difficult for some reason, like the save points being spaced really far apart or something...?<br><br>They were both very good series of games - I played more Crash just because I owned them, but my sister had the Spyro games so I played them a fair bit too.

            <p>Well, if we&#39;re just talking the very first ones, then I didn&#39;t really play that much of the original Crash, but I&#39;m pretty sure I finished the original Spyro. That was a very fun game, and I&#39;m going to have go find out if it&#39;s one of the playstation classics that are available for download.<br><br>Oddworld: Abe&#39;s Oddysee (as I&#39;ve now discovered is the &#39;correct&#39; spelling for that title) was a 2D platformer with a fair bit of puzzle-solving involved in completing the levels. You took on the role of Abe, a humanoid alien creature, that was trying to escape from the factory he worked at after overhearing that his species was going to be next delicacy for the alien overlords that ran the place. On your way out you had to try and rescue as many of your fellows as you could, and you could interact with them in a basic way to solve the puzzles to help you escape (simple stuff like following you, waiting at a certain spot, pulling a level - or as a last resort distraction to prevent the guards from spotting you). It was good fun, but very challenging.  <br><br>A mate of mine was very interested in all three of those games, so when you mentioned the first two, I was immediately reminded of Oddworld. I think Spyro was my favourite. </p>

            <p>You are the second person today that I&#39;ve seen, just today, who was being nostalgic for Crash Bandicoot.  Well...I think the other person was being nostalgic.  They were actually offering to buy it off of anyone who might have it, so I assume they wanted to play it.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve played many of the Crash and Spyro games.  Crash is more my speed, though.  I like the cartoony way he moves and spins.  I also really love Cortex.  He&#39;s an amazing villain.  All in all, it is a wonderfully goofy game.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I loved those little creatures. That was the only reason I continued playing the games, really. You&#39;re right about DX being super glitchy, which made it annoying to play.  Adventure 2: Battle was decent. The Chao Gardens were the only thing that made the games stand out to me, though. <br><br>Sonic Heros, I found really fun. I don&#39;t know why everybody makes it out to suck. I used to go against my brothers and friends a lot.<br><br>RPGs weren&#39;t something I got into until I was a bit older, with RuneScape (which is dead now, too. Such fate for once-good games, pile-driven into complete crap by &quot; cool new updates&quot;.) After that, it was The Elder Scrolls, with Morrowind and Oblivion (my favorite of all the games).</p>

            <p>You basically play the role of Ein, who&#39;s a Grim Angel that&#39;s being sent down to destroy the world of Riviera for reasons that I don&#39;t remember.

            <p>Most of my friends had PS1s, so every so often I would get the chance to play Crash Bandicoot and/or Spyro. Crash Bandicoot, from what little I played of it, was pretty awesome.

            <p>But that wasn&#39;t as good as the original PS1 games. I think they actually kinda killed it, but not as badly as they did with Spyro. (I mean, the games are good, they&#39;re just not Spyro games at all. It seems like the company just wanted a popular character so people would buy the game, as they completely changed everything except for his name.) I would absolutely love to see reboots of the old, original games! I would want them to play the same way and, actually, I feel like the graphics were part of what made the game what it was as well...  I mean the old, blocky PS1 style. I get so much feels just looking at it. I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to a graphics update if they did it right, however...</p>

            <p>This is the perfect place to discuss fandoms and other stuff we like. No worries there! {= )<br><br>The first three Spyro games are among the few video games I&#39;ve actually played through to the end. I&#39;m not a big gamer, but I love everything about the first one: the design, the music, the sounds, the way Spyro moves, the dragon names... everything. I don&#39;t like the second and third games quite as well, but they&#39;re okay. They&#39;re a little less magical and quirky, a little more wacky/goofy. Or something like that. I dunno; I just wasn&#39;t enchanted by the side characters and critters in the various worlds.<br><br>On a tangential note, another game I&#39;ve played through is <i>The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time</i> for PC.

            <p>I&#39;ve never heard of that game. What&#39;s it about? I&#39;m always looking for new things to play, maybe I&#39;ll check it out! <br><br>The second Spyro, Ripto&#39;s Rage, is my favorite of the three. Probably at first because it was the only one out of my Collectors&#39; Edition pack that didn&#39;t lock up, and later on because of the nostalgia. It&#39;s the first game I finished to the end (though, I&#39;ll admit, not 100% completed until recently) by myself, and one of the first games I fell in love with. Everything about it was just so... magical! The little dragon himself was adorable and pretty rad, the music was great, the gameplay was addictive and fun... I haven&#39;t seen too many recent games like it, and that makes me sad for future generations of gamers. And there was no DLC crap! You could just buy it and play it!<br><br>On another note, but still relevant- Any opinion on what the Spyro series has become?</p>

            <p><i>Ripto&#39;s Rage</i> is definitely better than <i>Year of the Dragon</i>, which I am hard-pressed to even remember. I think there was skateboarding in it, and that crossed my threshold for tolerating stupid mini-games. I wasn&#39;t playing <i>Spyro</i> because I was into skateboarding, I was playing <i>Spyro</i> because I wanted to run around as a cocky little purple dragon, fly, set stuff on fire, and trash things with my horns. Skateboards do not enter into this equation. Also, way too heavy on side-characters I didn&#39;t care about. See above note about wanting to play as a dragon, not a monkey or a bird or whatever else was in there.<br><br>Most of the mini-games in <i>Ripto&#39;s Rage</i> are pretty good, though. The flying ones are always great, and I was okay with most of the rest. The endgame always disappointed me, though. I thought the fight with Ripto was uninteresting, challenging only because it was a long grind and I sucked at dodging with the weird camera angle they used there, not because anything creative was happening, and I never felt a good sense of closure by defeating him. It always surprised me that it was really over, just like that. Plus, again, I never cared much about the side-characters. I wanted a lot more dragons from my dragon games, or at least more fantastical creatures like fauns, less random anthropomorphized animals like cheetahs with running shoes.<br><br>As for the rest of the series, I never played anything beyond <i>Year of the Dragon</i> because I couldn&#39;t afford new systems. Therefore, I don&#39;t know very much about the newer games. I guess there&#39;s a girl dragon, and she&#39;s named Cynder, or something like that? *shrug*<br><br>As for <i>Legacy of Time</i>, it&#39;s kind of similar to the <i>Myst</i> series in that it&#39;s a puzzle game where you run around picking up clues and items to work your way through each stage. In this case, you&#39;re a time-traveler who&#39;s trying to collect the pieces of an alien artifact that ended up stashed in various places and times on Earth, specifically Atlantis, El Dorado, and Shangri La before they were lost. You explore the areas, pick up various items that you&#39;ll need to use to solve the puzzles, and eventually you get the artifact piece from each area. You&#39;re assisted by Arthur, the AI in your chameleon suit (which lets you look like a native, wherever you are). Arthur is hilariously snarky, and one of the major reasons I liked the game so much. Also because it looks good and sounds good, and the puzzles are challenging without being impossible. The tunnels under Shangri La were definitely the toughest for me. I spent many, many hours running around mapping that place.<br><br>Oddly, I never played any of the other games in the series. I don&#39;t know why. Definitely check out that one at least, though. It&#39;s a little confusing, not having all the backstory, but once you&#39;re into the game it doesn&#39;t interfere too much.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>its about the in-game story and my agents, see I would like them to have gone though the Kalos story line (for the other regions I&#39;m having them be ether background characters or tag-a longs to the game canons, as the canons to the story based stuff) but I worried that would technically make THEM canons.  <br><br>So my main question is, would it be possible to have a Pokemon continuum agent and have them go though the in-game story. <br><br>I await the answers, oh, to answer one possible question myself I&#39;m asking this question because I really couldn&#39;t find an answer on the wiki, pulse I couldn&#39;t find any other agents that have a Pokemon trainer background for reference (if there is one then I&#39;ll be honest and say I didn&#39;t look hard enough :P) I hope this all makes sense. </p>

            <p>I hope that&#39;s okay!<br><br>1. What would happen if an agent tried to read the words inside of HQ?<br>2. I don&#39;t swear very often, but I have still picked up the habit of using <em>leaf and frond</em> when I do. Is that something I should worry about or simply a healthy dose of insanity?<br>3. Could it be that the position as head of finance has similar effects on one&#39;s wellbeing as the position of defense against the dark arts-teacher at Hogwarts?<br>4.

            <p>1/ That really would depend on the agent. I suspect most of the time, since they&#39;re not in a badfic, they wouldn&#39;t see anything. Other agents, though, might see the Words of whatever canon they happen to be passing through - recall that HQ is basically a mass of plotholes linked together by little stretches of canon worlds. So one step you&#39;d be under the Misty Mountains, the next, in an abandoned building on Coruscant.<br><br>Finally, there&#39;s those agents who are aware that they&#39;re fictional characters (my own Lou is one; I think DawnFire has one of these, too). They might well be able to read the words of the PPC story they&#39;re in.<br><br>2/ Well, I tend towards &#39;stars and water&#39; myself... despite what some may say, people are allowed to say anything they want when they get frustrated. ;) The fact that you swear like a Flower is nothing to worry about (though it does make you quite, quite mad).<br><br>3/ A word from the Rhododendron, secretary to the Board:<br><br><i>Just because there have been a few... er... highly-publicised incidents involving the incumbent Heads of Finance, there is no reason to indulge in such wild speculations. For the record, the Evermind held the position in perfect safety from the department&#39;s inaugration until the regrettable events of 1998 HST. Admittedly the Bindweed lasted only a short time, due to her support for the Mysterious Somebody, but the Clover was entirely secure in his post for more than a decade. The current Head wishes to- what? I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m going to have to go.</i><br><br>4/ It is possible for a character - either your self-insert, or a PPC agent - to sign up voluntarily. <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9130619/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Discworld">OFUDisc</a> had multiple volunteer attendees. Regrettably, there are no actual OFUs, so you can&#39;t actually attend GrammarBootCamp (at least, not until we organise one during a Gathering, but how likely is that?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>1) I&#39;m pretty sure reading the Words only works in a mission, when you&#39;re in the Word World constructed by the fic. I seem to recall something somewhere saying trying to read the Words in HQ just straight-up won&#39;t work, but I could be completely wrong.<br><br>2) Those are rather odd things to use as curse words, but I think you should be okay.<br><br>3) Eeeeh, not really. The Clover was Finance head for a long time before Peter happened, without too many ill effects. It does seem to have a way of drawing unstable agents though - be they people who don&#39;t feel they&#39;re paid well enough, or ones with more sinister designs like what happened to the Evermind.<br><br>(Of course, the simple answer is that since the Head of Finance has usually been written by hS, when a Flower needs to be killed off they&#39;re one of the easier ones to do. :P I think someone was writing up a story for the new Head, but I think they dropped the project...)<br><br>4) OFUs don&#39;t seem to be as much of an actively-written thing as they used to be, but yeah, pretty sure people sign themselves up all the time.</p>

            <p>Asking questions is perfectly fine.<br><br>1) That probably depends on the agent.  In general, I would say...whatever is funniest.<br><br>2) Nothing to worry about...unless it is.  Probably nothing.<br><br>Or is it?!<br><br>3) Seems to be the case.  I know I wouldn&#39;t take that job.<br><br>4) OFUs are not really our jurisdiction.  However, I might be able to help with this question.  So, are you asking if you, the actual person who is sitting at a computer right now, can join an OFU to help better yourself and your writing?  Or, are you asking if a fictional version of you can be enrolled in an OFU?<br><br>The answer to the first is a no.  The answer to the second is a maybe.

            <p>It&#39;s okay :)<br><br>1. I&#39;m not sure but at best you would get a mild headache at worst the world blows up (that being the worst thing to happen to anyone)<br>2. I don&#39;t think you should worry sometimes people need ways of expressing their anger, especially if they don&#39;t like to swear :) <br>3.

            <p>If you really want to write a story about a Pokémon trainer, why don&#39;t you just, well, write a story about a Pokémon trainer? If you leave the PPC out of it, you can just do it without having to worry about getting Permission and making it work with our canon. Also, if you still want to use your trainer as an agent later, you&#39;ll have that character and their backstory fully developed already, plus a complete writing sample about them to show the PGs. It seems to me that trying to force PPC mission and Pokémon fanfic to cohabit one story/series is making things a lot more complicated than they need to be.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>But I not trying to force a PPC mission into a Pokemon fanfic (or at least not intentionally trying) I&#39;m just figuring out how I should go about making their backstory work once their in the PPC.  Like in the in-game story line of Kalos you HAVE to capture the two main legendary Pokemon (Xerneas and Yvelta) and I&#39;m just curios if I can keep them once they join and if I can&#39;t then work around this by not not including the main story line in their backstory. <br><br>If I&#39;m just being to paranoid about this backstory thing and should just not care that much about the Pokemon training part IN their backstory then please tell now so I can just stop with all these questions and work on their backstory the right way (because to be honest, I&#39;m feeling like a real idiot and an annoyance with all these questions :(.)<br><br>(by the way I&#39;m saying what I&#39;m feeling right now, so if I sound mean or nothing seems worded right then I&#39;m sorry.)</p>

            <p>Hello! <br>So... *nervous wave* Um, hi. I&#39;ve introduced myself in a different thread, but I&#39;ve been told to make a seperate one. <br>I&#39;m Rina, and I make up half of the RinaAndRanda team that will hopefully one day take on missions! My friend Randa and I are planning on tackling badfic together, but I&#39;ll do most of the writing (and Randa will check it over to make sure I get her agent in-character). <br>I stumbled across the Original Series about two weeks ago, and when I found out the PPC was still alive and going strong, of course I wanted to join- but I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to handle the job by myself. So I introduced Randa to the Original Series and asked her to team up. She said yes, obviously. <br>We&#39;re both really into Harry Potter (and consequently, we&#39;ll probably deal with badfics from there. We should be fine- after Sporking My Immortal a few years back, there shouldn&#39;t be much that can shock us. *knock on wood*). Other fandoms for both of us are Percy Jackson, My Little Pony, Pokemon, and Lord of the Rings (though I&#39;m the only one who&#39;s read the books, Randa&#39;s heard me talk about them often enough that she should be able to tell what&#39;s strictly bookverse and movieverse).<br>Everyone I&#39;ve talked to so far seems really nice. *cuddles newly acquired potato cannon* Hopefully, one day, I&#39;ll be also welcoming people to the Board. :) <br>Randa&#39;s probably going to be a while in posting her own entry, since her internet connection is... sporadic. We see each other every day at school, so the communication issue is really just online.<br>Anyway, so far, I&#39;ve had a great time talking with other people. Um... I guess that&#39;s really all there is to say. <br>*awkward silence*</p>

My brother likes Pinkie Pie best just because she&#39;s so random. <br>I&#39;m not sure if the writers intentionally didn&#39;t give Twilight any princess duties and princess is more an honorary title, but... Hmm. I&#39;m kind of glad, because the series hasn&#39;t changed much, but I&#39;m also more than a little disappointed because it would have been interesting to see how they would handle Twilight&#39;s new royal duties. It would have been a good message to kids, too: being a princess isn&#39;t all about pretty dresses and getting everything you want. <br>Bah.<br>Wow, I just realized how insanely off-topic we&#39;re getting. :P</p>

            <p>Okay, um... I dunno. I think I&#39;ll go ahead and ask for a scene of my DIC agents. I&#39;m thinkin&#39; of something slightly on the sappier side, maybe.<br><br>Hm...

            <p>I love it! Printworthy&#39;s face there is great. Staring at the canon break in bewilderment, unsure of what exactly is going on.

            <p>That&#39;s right, folks! Sit up straight and get out your notebooks, &#39;cause it&#39;s time for the second of my possibly many workshop/rant/advice/things. Today&#39;s subject will be speech and speaking -- specifically, speeches and speaking done by your characters. I&#39;ll go over how to make it, how to intertwine it with your characterization, and how to avoid abusing it. Just as last time, I will begin with my own personal recommendations and conclude with an open writing challenge.<br><br><b>Definitions</b><br><br>I&#39;ll be using the words &quot;speech&quot; and &quot;voice&quot; quite a few times over the course of this post. These are both being used to describe a character&#39;s manner of verbal communication. &quot;Dialogue&quot; refers to shared communication between two or more characters, just as &quot;monologue&quot; refers to a person speaking by his or herself.<br><br><b>Speech and Characterization</b><br><br>You might recall from my first entry on characterization that I very briefly mentioned finding some aspect of your character&#39;s voice that was distinctive. A good character has something about their manner of speaking or word choice or what have you that sets them apart from anyone they might be speaking to.<br><br>But the connection between voice and character goes further than that. Who an individual is can inform how they speak to others. A character who goes to college to study sociology will likely not sound the same as the high school-educated barista who serves him coffee at the campus Starbucks.<br><br>How you want someone to sound when they speak is something you should consider while making the character, at least for a little bit. If you make a super-strict rule-stickler and then make them speak like someone fresh off the Californian waves, your audience might be a bit baffled. (Not to say such a character wouldn&#39;t be interesting; you&#39;d just need to throw out a lot of explanation for why they&#39;re like that).<br><br><b>Dialects and Foreign Languages</b><br><br>Related to characterization in speech is the concept of dialects (regional and social elements in a character&#39;s voice). Using dialects in one&#39;s writing can be very much a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it&#39;s a convenient way to indicate elements of someone&#39;s background without having to spell it out. Someone talks about going up to Haavahd to see their brothah, you might be able to work out that they&#39;re from an upper-class Boston family (or doing a terrible JFK impression; sorry to anyone from Boston). <br><br>The risk is taking it too far, to the point of unreadability. It&#39;s okay to throw a few phonetically-spelled elements of dialect into someone&#39;s speech, but not for every word. You don&#39;t want to confuse the audience... unless of course that&#39;s your intention and you&#39;re making a joke out of someone having an ultra-thick Bayou or West Country accent (like in <i>Hot Fuzz</i>).<br><br>On a similar note are elements of foreign languages. Used sparingly, they add a bit of color to characters (see <i>Firefly</i>). Used too much or without context (when and with who is this character using a foreign language?) and your audience is once again left in the dark. You should ideally know at least a bit of the language you&#39;re using, too. Having someone who speaks the language help you is also acceptable. Looking up common phrases can be a bit hit or miss. Online translation services should be avoided, unless you&#39;re okay with people who know the language asking you why you inserted such a butchered phrase.<br><br><b>We Don&#39;t Need No Stinkin&#39; Rules</b><br><br>Speech doesn&#39;t necessarily have to follow the same grammatical rules as most other written text. The vast majority of people in the world don&#39;t speak according to the proper rules of whatever language they follow. They speak in run-ons or fragments. They begin sentences with &quot;and&quot; or &quot;but.&quot; They use words or phrases like &quot;ain&#39;t&quot; or &quot;the big stabby thingy.&quot; The rules someone does or doesn&#39;t follow when they speak can tell the audience a great deal about who they are.<br><br><b>Actually, We DO Need Some Rules</b><br><br>Just because your characters can ignore the rules of proper grammar doesn&#39;t mean that the author (that is to say, you) can. There are some things you can&#39;t ignore:<br>   • When you follow up speech with a descriptor (he said, she said, etc.), the speech must end with a comma and not a period. Ex.: &quot;...and that&#39;s how I got that particular scar,&quot; he remarked.<br> • One cannot &quot;smile&quot; or &quot;frown&quot; spoken words. One can &quot;say with a smile&quot; or &quot;comment with a frown.&quot; Ex.: &quot;I&#39;m good,&quot; she smiled. VERSUS &quot;I&#39;m good,&quot; she replied with a smile.<br> • Different people speaking get their own paragraphs. No exceptions.<br><br><b>The Challenge!</b><br><br>Write a short story -- just a few paragraphs, really -- that is mostly someone speaking. Let&#39;s say at least seventy to eighty percent speech. It can be a dialogue or a monologue. I leave that up to you.<br>Remember to read and critique the responses left by others, as well as to enjoy yourself. Have fun and good writing to you all!</p>

            <p>The first actually isn&#39;t one of mine, but comes from a published book. However, I read it just after reading the Workshop post, and it seemed to be a little masterclass in how to give characters distinctive voices, so I figured it was worth sharing.<br><br>This extract come from <i>Starfighters of Adumar</i>, book 9 in the &#39;X-wing series&#39;, written by Aaron Allston. <br>* * *
<br><br>Wedge said, “This is Red Leader. Understood. We launch at arrival plus five seconds. Red Flight, are you good to go?”<br><br>“Red Two, ready.” That was Tycho, as economical of words as he was of motion.<br><br>“Red Three, four lit and ready to burn.” Janson’s inimitable voice and enthusiasm were evident even across the standard X-wing comm distortion.<br><br>“Red Four, nothing’s gone wrong yet.” There was almost a hopeful note to Hobbie’s dour tone. <br>* * *
<br><br>It&#39;s not perfect - sometimes Tycho simply has a lot to say, and Janson tends to get more serious and brief when they&#39;re in combat, but you can usually take a good guess at who is speaking, without having to rely on their names/callsigns. And you can pretty much always tell whenever Hobbie is speaking. <br><br>The next one is just a random piece of mine. I&#39;ve had the Captain&#39;s first words in my head for quite some time now, as an intro / establishing character moment, and just built the scene around that. I don&#39;t have a story for this character yet, but when I do, some variation of this scene will probably play out pretty early on. <br>* * *
<br><br>The corporate headquarters of Zanex rarely hosted such unrefined guests, but when the need arose one of the smaller and less well furnished meeting rooms was used.<br><br>Five corporate employees, their suits perfectly tailored and spotlessly clean, sat opposite the two men in rough spacers’ clothes. Five was far more than would be needed for the negotiation, in fact, the senior policy maker had the authority to handle the matter himself. But he could hardly be expected to talk with people of such low status. The suited men to his immediate left and right were mid-level executives; it was they that would take care of the actual communication. The final two were junior executives, present merely to observe the proceedings.<br><br>At a gesture from the policymaker, the man on his right began speaking. “Welcome, Captain Ivaken, Master Jacus, to our prosperous business. It is our hope that together, we can work…”<br><br>Jacus wished that he could share a look with his captain, to see if he had started to tune out the man’s obsequious speech, but to do so risked insulting their prospective client. Instead, he waited patiently, nodding occasionally at the man’s words to give the impression of attentiveness.<br><br>The voice faded into the background, droning on for long enough that Jacus’ thoughts drifted further than he’d intended. With a start, he suddenly realised that the room was silent, and that expectant faces were watching him from across the table. Either the Captain wanted him to take the lead, or he’d been bored enough to lose concentration altogether.<br><br>Jacus stepped forward, till he was level with the Captain in his seat. “Thank you for the welcome, and for the opportunity of doing business with you.”<br><br>The central suit whispered something into the ear of the speaker, and Jacus inwardly braced himself for the next monologue. <br><br>“Forgive me for asking but, while we have dealt with Drenai before, and you come highly recommended by him, your ship and crew are an unknown quantity for us. How do we know that we can trust you?”<br><br><i>Sweet merciful gods, he’s actually being brief.</i> “A perfectly reasonable concern. Please allow us to offer you some reassurances-”<br><br>The sound of snapping fingers, reverberating in the small room thanks to its lack of soft furnishings, cut him off exactly where he expected it to. He stepped back, resuming his place just behind and to the right of his Captain. <br><br>“My loyalty is a commodity like any other – it’s available to the highest bidder. If you’re not the highest bidder in these parts, then you probably don’t want to be doing business with me. And I <i>certainly</i> don’t want to be doing business with you.”<br><br>“You mean that you’d break our agreement if someone offered you more money?”<br><br>“Of course not.” The tone of the words carried an unspoken ‘don’t be an idiot’. “If one of your rivals were to try and buy me out while I was carrying your cargo, I would immediately contact you, so that you’d have the opportunity to put in a counteroffer.”<br><br>“And how do we know that you won’t say you have received such an offer from one of our rivals, even if no such offer were actually made, in order to drive your price up?”<br><br>“You get what you pay for, and I’m very good at what I do. My price structure reflects that. I think you’ll find that they’re high enough already.”<br><br>This time there was a whole whispered discussion, rather than just simple instructions being passed down. <br><br>“And what would your price be for this job?”<br><br>“Five hundred thousand.”<br><br>“What!? We could buy our own ship for that!” The executive’s calm demeanour had been shattered, and his face flushed with embarrassment. The harsh whispers directed at him carried a hint of reprimand.<br><br>“Yeah, you could buy a ship. But not <i>my</i> ship. And Zanex can count several ships on its roster, all of which cost more, and none of which are suitable. If they were, you wouldn’t have asked us here.”<br><br>There was silence for a while, as the suits digested the fact that their guests were not the simple-minded space-juicers they’d expected them to be. <br><br>The quiet was finally broken by the second executive. “The price that you have quoted still seems high for a simple transit of cargo, even for transport through potentially hostile territory. Perhaps we could see a cost breakdown? How did you come up with that figure?”<br><br>“You think the galactic banks issue insurance to people in my line of work? If my ship gets damaged doing your job, I gotta pay for that outta my own pocket, <i>twice</i>. Once for the repair costs, and once for the time it wastes where I can’t work. My fee includes shipping and handling, fuel costs, the bribes I’ll have to pay, plus a risk factor to cover any damages.”<br><br>“It sounds as if at least some of your fee is based on variables that you can’t properly determine at this time. What if we were to negotiate a lower initial fee, but with higher charges for any actual damage sustained in your endeavours on our behalf?”<br><br>His words were met with silence from both parties, and the young executive began to wonder if he’d made a mistake. Maybe the smuggler was insulted by the talk of a lower price, maybe his own superior was offended that he’d offered a deal with consulting with him… <br><br>“Finally there’s a businessman among you!” Ivaken pointed a finger at the suddenly relived exec. “You, I can make a deal with.” His finger shifted to point at the former speaker. “Get him outta here.”<br><br>* * *
<br><br>My final piece features a couple of PPC Agents, including DIA Officer Shacklemore, whose <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=249204;search_term=shacklemore">first and only other appearance</a> was in PoorCynic&#39;s previous Workshop.<br><br>* * *
<br><br>Officer Theodore Shacklemore calmly finished writing up the latest transcription, then looked at the DMS Agent across the table from him. “I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that that last remark was close to an act of insubordination.”<br><br>Skeet leaned forward, his wrists settling on the table with a metallic jangle. “Technically speaking, wouldn&#39;t I have to be your subordinate in order to act insubordinate? Last time I checked, that’s not how they run this place.”<br><br>“As you well know, Assassin, insubordination refers to any act of disobedience or rebellion. And given your current status, disobedience is hardly going to be helpful to you.”<br><br>“Hey, I have a name, Shacklemore, and I know you know it – it’s in my file, along with rest of my details. I don’t call you ‘Officer’.”<br><br>“Have you considered doing so? It would be a show of respect. You gain nothing from this defiant act-”<br><br>“I have no intention of performing an act of defiance. An act of <i>violence</i>, on the other hand…”<br><br>“Would gain you even less.”<br><br>“Yeah? Well we’ll see if you feel the same way after I bounce your <i>head</i> off this table.”<br><br>“A task that will not be aided by your restraints.”<br><br>“What, these old things?” Skeet held his manacled wrists up. “A holdout blaster, a decent knife… hell, I could get out of these with a <i>toothpick</i>!”<br><br>“That sounds like quite a feat. I’d be very interested in seeing you do that.”<br><br>“Oh, errr… I-I don’t actually have a… toothpick on me… at the moment.”<br><br>Shacklemore made another note on the tablet in front of him, then reached up into his breast pocket and pulled out a pack of toothpicks. He selected one, and proceeded to work it into the gap between his incisor and canine, then put it down on the table. He then selected a fresh one and offered it across the table.<br><br>Skeet leaned back from the proffered pick, slouching in his chair and running his hands through his hair as if to straighten his ponytail, a movement that was slightly hampered by the cuffs. By the time he brought his hands back into view again, he’d somehow acquired a vibroknife.<br><br>The weapon made short work of the steel restraints.<br><br>“You were searched for weapons before being brought here.”<br><br>“Yes. Yes I was.”<br>* * *
<br>So I&#39;ve tried to do something a little different to normal here and focus exclusively on the dialogue, only including the other narration when it was absolutely necessary to show what was happening in the scene. If I do end up using this scene in the actual storyline, I&#39;ll probably &#39;fill in the blanks&#39; a little, actually give some descriptions and a few more speech tags, etc. For now, I&#39;m just wondering how well I did characterising these guys just through their words. <br></p>

            <p>...My concern with the third bit you wrote is it seems to be set up to make the entire DIA look like idiots to make your agent look cool. I don&#39;t know if this was intended but it&#39;s the inescapable vibe I get from reading it; this bit of feedback&#39;s probably useless now the thread has fallen off the front page, but I can elaborate anyway if anyone reads this. :P</p>

            <p>No feedback is ever useless, particularly in this case as I&#39;ve never had any problem with the sign in system on the Board, so I get an e-mail alert whenever someone replies to a comment of mine :)<br><br>It wasn&#39;t my intention to make the DIA seem like idiots (I&#39;ll admit that I do like making my agents look cool, but Shacklemore is just as much an agent of mine as Skeet is). I was just going for conflicting personalities, and a situation involving actual conflict, so that I could get their respective voices as distinct as possible. <br><br>Personally, I think it&#39;s Skeet that&#39;s being the idiot here - he&#39;s being incredibly brash and cocky, when polite co-operation would be far more beneficial to him. Let&#39;s face it, he&#39;s been arrested by the DIA; Skeet isn&#39;t going <i>anywhere</i> until they choose to let him do so. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t want the DIA to seem like idiots. As well as having some DIA members, such as Shacklemore, appear as supporting roles in Skeet and Amy&#39;s stories, I do plan on writing some stuff for the DIA itself. I think it&#39;d make an interesting change of pace from the typical missions, which tend to follow the same general patterns, and can be broadly classed as comedic action/adventure. With the DIA, I could try my hand at writing a PPC detective story.<br><br>Hope that clears things up. Do you have any advice on how I could change things to avoid that vibe you got? Just in case anyone else thought the same.    </p>

            <p>Regarding the <i>Starfighters of Adumar</i>:<br><br>This snippet doesn&#39;t read well at all to my eyes. The description that follows after each bit of dialogue is completely redundant. I can tell Jansen is enthusiastic for a fight based on what he said. Hobbie is obviously something of a wet blanket based on his apparent anticipation of something going wrong. The dialogue seemed capable of standing on its own without the added descriptors.<br><br>Regarding the piece with Captain Ivaken:<br><br>This is better than the first example. Ivaken has a very strong and distinctive voice, although I do wish it had been a bit rougher (as benefits what seems to be a somewhat shady smuggler). I might be a bit spoiled in that regard by images of other space-wandering rogues a la Han Solo or Malcolm Reynolds, though. I&#39;m definitely interested in seeing him interact with more people, and how different those interactions would be depending on who those other people are.<br><br>A few minor things:<br>-- &#39;Five was far more than would be needed for the negotiation&#39; should be a separate sentence.<br>-- Word choice: &#39;obsequious&#39; is a bit too much. What about &#39;oily&#39; or &#39;ingratiating&#39;?<br>-- &#39;The central suit whispered something into the ear of the speaker, and Jacus inwardly braced himself for the next monologue&#39; can be separated into two separate sentences.<br><br>Regarding the piece with Skeet and Shacklemore:<br><br>This is great bit of back and forth. Very nice contentious banter, like you might hear out of a good cop drama. The ending also feels a bit cliff-hangery, which I really quite like. Is violence actually going to break out, or was Skeet just messing around to make a point? Solid stuff.<br><br>The only major qualm I have is Skeet&#39;s line &#39;Oh, errr… I-I don’t actually have a… toothpick on me… at the moment.&#39; The sudden awkwardness just seems to clash with his previous sort of quiet bravado. Unless that&#39;s actually part of his character and he&#39;s putting on a very front for Shacklemore.</p>

            <p>Regarding <i>Starfighters of Adumar</i>, I do sort of see what you mean. To give a little bit of context to the scene, it takes place near the beginning of the book, and I think it&#39;s one of the first times the main characters are actually gathered together. They&#39;re all recurring characters from the series (and the expanded universe in general) so I guess it&#39;s just supposed to be a little refresher of the characterisation that they&#39;ve had before. (On a side note, I wouldn&#39;t personally class Hobbie as a wet blanket - while he is a very pessimistic &#39;glass is half empty&#39; kind of guy, he is still a pilot in an elite fighter squadron). <br><br>I agree that avoiding redundancy/repetition is a good general rule, but I think it does have a place if it&#39;s used to confirm/emphasize a point, which is what I think it was doing in this case. <br><br>Having said that, it does feel a little clumsy, and that&#39;s part of the reason that I decided to strip down the piece with Skeet and Shacklemore to just the dialogue and the minimum description necessary for it to make sense. <br><br>The X-wing series also provides another really good example of giving a character a distinctive voice: Admiral Ackbar. He&#39;s an amphibious alien, and frequently uses ocean analogies when speaking - threats that they can&#39;t identify are referred to as riptides, fleets of spaceships descend on their targets &#39;like a tidal wave&#39;, etc. (I don&#39;t have the books in front of me, so I can&#39;t give actual quotes). It&#39;s quite subtle, but very effective when you notice it. <br><br>Regarding Captain Ivaken, I&#39;m glad you feel that I was able to give him a distinctive voice, and I do take your point that he could sound a bit rougher. Being honest, I hadn&#39;t really given much thought to his characterisation beyond that single defining introductory line. Thanks for pointing out that other stuff too, particularly my use of &#39;obsequious&#39; - it doesn&#39;t really fit with the rest of the piece. I think I&#39;ll use &#39;oily&#39; for the re-write. <br><br>Regarding Skeet and Shacklemore, thank you for the comments. I&#39;ll have to bring Shacklemore into my actual spin-off sometime soon, instead of just using him in these workshops, because he&#39;s incredibly good fun to write. <br><br>Skeet&#39;s awkwardness with that line is supposed to be because he wasn&#39;t expecting Shacklemore to call his bluff (and yes, he was bluffing, he doesn&#39;t know how to get out of handcuffs using only a toothpick - but then, he doesn&#39;t <i>need</i> to). Maybe I over-exaggerated it a little, but I was trying to convey that through the dialogue alone, instead of using something like &#39;Not prepared for his bluff being called, Skeet stammered out a response...&#39;. <br><br>Going back to the general subject of your workshop, one other way of giving a character a unique voice is to use a different font for them, like Death has in the <i>Discworld</i> books. As with transcribed accents/dialects I don&#39;t think it&#39;d work if it was overused, but it&#39;s used very effectively in <i>Discworld</i>.<br><br></p>

            <p>I was going to mention that as a method of creating unique voice. <i>Discworld</i> provides quite a few examples of that being used effectively besides Death (the golem written font in <i>Feet of Clay</i> and the Klatch-specific font in <i>Jingo</i> for example). The trouble is, that technique is a bit more difficult to use online for things like the PPC. Trying to implement different fonts can be a difficult task depending on how you choose to present your stories.<br><br>If you&#39;re looking to actually publish your story, using different fonts can open up a different problem all together: licensing. Fonts are considered to be copywritable. Some require licensing to be used in published material.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, I&#39;d forgotten about the golem script and the Klatchian. I get your point about the potential difficulty of doing using that particular technique, it should be straightforward if you&#39;re using Google Docs to publish missions, but I don&#39;t know about anywhere else. And I never knew that fonts could be protected like that, that could certainly make things more complicated.<br><br>Thinking about it a little more, another way to give characters a distinctive voice is to give them unusual speech marks. Andalites have a distinctive way of speaking, so if you see someone talking &lt;like this&gt; around HQ, it&#39;s a safe bet that it&#39;s Agent Ilraen. Similarly, I&#39;ve seen mechanical/robotic individuals talk +++like this+++, ::or this::. It&#39;s similar in effect to using a special font, but should be much easier to implement.<br><br>Character speech is actually a remarkably thought provoking topic. There&#39;s a fair bit that I&#39;ve just done unconsciously before, and am only realising it now that I&#39;ve stopped to think about it. <br><br>One of the things that I do tend consider when I&#39;m trying to find a character&#39;s &#39;voice&#39; is whether or not they use contractions, especially the more slang terms like gonna / going to. <br><br>Another, relatively minor, thing that I tend to think about is what they say when they pause for thought - whether they ummm..., errrrr..., or just always have a ready answer. </p>

            <p>The use of speech in your piece was... well it was rather unremarkable. Generic, almost. Nothing about it stood out. Nothing about it really told me anything about the characters.

There are missing commas, commas in places of periods, improperly structured sentences, and improper capitalization amongst other issues.

Who is Vanaduke? What is a Bark Module? Why are they needed for Pulsars? People should not have to skim through a Wiki to figure out what you&#39;re talking about. In regards to matters of canon that might not be known to a large audience, the impetus should not be on the reader to research, but for you to explain in a clear and concise manner.</p>

            <p>This reads pretty well to me. It doesn&#39;t strike me as being particularly speech-heavy as per my request, but there are still plenty of good moments conveyed through what dialogue there is.

I did like her saying &#39;mon coeur&#39; upon being surprised, however. That&#39;s a good way of using foreign languages right there.<br><br>I have one final note not related to the content of your writing.

            <p>I think there needs to be a balance, though, between using the foreign-language words realistically and using words the audience will actually recognize.

            <p>...is that it&#39;s all about context. You can use phrases and words that people might not specifically know so long as they can make a close guess (although I will admit that I actually do speak and read a little French).<br><br><i>Firefly</i> is a prime example of this. The vast majority of its audience probably did not know what the occasional Chinese lines meant, but they were at least able to hazard a guess from the context in which those phrases were used. So when Inara says of the bounty hunter Early &quot;Any chance the <i>xiong meng de kung ren</i> might survive?&quot; after he&#39;s terrorized the crew and almost killed Simon, you can guess that it might not be particularly complimentary sentiment.</p>

            <p>So I answer. The French seemed pretty good, though there was one thing I wasn&#39;t sure about. <br><br>In <i>&quot;&#39;Bon bon!

            <p>The use of a unique dialect for each character made it totally clear who was speaking each line, with no further clarification needed once they&#39;d been introduced.

            <p>I would definitely not try to put all three of the Trolls into the same long piece.  It would be overkill, to be sure.<br><br>I also like that line.  I figured, part of Tuff&#39;s dialect is that he is several paragraphs behind everyone else, and I needed a way to show that the other characters are aware of that.<br><br>As for the Watering Hole, it is not just for non-humans.  Martin, the owner, is human, after all.  I imagine there are some human agents that go there to prove themselves to their fellow agents by doing shots of Water (the substance the bar is actually named for).  I wouldn&#39;t recommend it, myself, but &quot;agents will be agents,&quot; as they say.  The clientele is mostly non-human, though.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Very nice. I look forward to seeing these characters built upon.<br><br>I think you use dialects fairly well. Barid&#39;s was a bit questionable (dropping the aitches from each here felt like a small step too far) but otherwise I thought I worked pretty well.

            <p>In <i>World of Warcraft</i>, the Trolls all talk like Barid.  In game, they tend to not spell out the dialect, though.

            <p>Rina kicked her feet up on the console, being careful to keep her clunky boots away from any buttons. She yawned and raked her fingers through her short hair.<br>&quot;You know,&quot; her partner, Randa, said from the floor, &quot;When you asked me to join the PPC, I didn&#39;t think it would be so... boring.&quot;<br>Rina made a face. &quot;Just give it some time, okay? Why don&#39;t you go play Solitaire or something?&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#39;t know how to play Solitaire.&quot;<br>&quot;What about War? That always takes forever; I&#39;d be willing to play...&quot;<br>Randa shrugged and rolled over so she was lying on her back. &quot;I can&#39;t believe they didn&#39;t give us any beds,&quot; she muttered.<br>&quot;They?&quot;<br>&quot;The freaky talking plants.&quot;<br>Rina stifled a snort. &quot;Well, you can&#39;t really blame them, can you? It&#39;s not like the S.O. needs a bed.&quot; She paused. &quot;Although, considering the majority of agents use beds, you&#39;d think we&#39;d get at least cots or something.&quot; She looked around their RC, but the only things to see were the Generic Material of the walls and floor and the weapons rack.<br>Rina yawned again, vaguely thinking about taking a nap. Of course, the Universal Laws of Narrative Irony decided to manifest.<br>[BEEEEEP]<br>&quot;Ack!&quot; Rina sat bolt upright and swung her feet off the console. &quot;Hey, Randa! We&#39;ve got our first mission!&quot; <br>&quot;Really? Awesome! What is it?&quot; Randa peered at the screen, not noticing her partner&#39;s mouth fall open. Randa somehow managed to groan and giggle at the same time. &quot;Seriously? This one hatched from a dragon egg?&quot;<br>&quot;Bwah?&quot; Rina could only gape at the readout. <br>Randa glanced at Rina, a frown creasing her forehead. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br>&quot;They&#39;re screwing with me. It&#39;s the only explanation,&quot; Rina muttered, rubbing her eyes and double-checking that she hadn&#39;t been seeing things. She glared at the ceiling. &quot;This isn&#39;t funny!&quot; She yelled.<br>&quot;Rina, you&#39;re not making any sense,&quot; Randa said irritably. &quot;What is going on?&quot;<br>Rina gestured at the screen. &quot;I- I- I wrote this! When I was ten!&quot; she said miserably. &quot;Jade Leanna Dragonheart, hatched from a Hungarian Horntail&#39;s egg, has a dragon tail and wings and is immune to fire. She can breathe it, too.&quot; She groaned and sank back in the chair, wondering how difficult it would be to smash the console.<br>A burst of laughter made her look up. &quot;Stop laughing!&quot; she snapped.<br>&quot;Sorry,&quot; Randa said, gasping for air. &quot;Just- you wrote- dragon tail-!&quot; Randa was positively howling with laughter at that point.<br>Rina snarled several choice expletives as she stood and stomped to the weapons rack. Randa&#39;s laughter was cut off when Rina thrust an axe into her arms. &quot;We&#39;re going to kill this abomination as soon as possible, and we will make it painful. Torture&#39;s unfortunately out of the question, so we&#39;ll have to be... creative.&quot; She slung a quiver over her shoulder and grabbed a recurve bow. &quot;And stop laughing!&quot;<br>Randa bit the inside of her mouth, her shoulder shaking with silent guffaws as Rina opened a portal and stormed through.<br><br>(Unfortunately, yes, I did in fact write this Sue. Thank god I only ever wrote one chapter, but it was a doozy. Ugh.)</p>

            <p>This is a fairly solid little piece. I liked the acknowledgement that yes, physic human-sized plants are vaguely freaky. It&#39;s easy to forget how strange that would seem when writing for more experienced agents.<br><br>The biggest weakness to my mind is how similar Rina and Randa sound. There wasn&#39;t enough in their voices to really distinguish them from each other. Keep in mind that the vast majority of any missions you might write in the future are going to consist of these two bantering with each other and reacting to badfic. Fortunately, repeated practice should help you both develop a separate voice for each agent.<br><br>The only other thing I would note is there are a couple paragraphs with some slight repetition.

            <p>I figured the characters would sound kind of similar... Though Randa and I have talked about little things like our agents&#39; first day at the PPC (if we get permission), I wrote this without Randa&#39;s input on her agent. Randa herself is a LOT quirkier than me, so it should be interesting. (She&#39;s thinking about fighting with a titanium yo-yo complete with steel cord. Not sure how practical that is, but it&#39;d be kind of funny...)<br><br>Hmm... I was trying to convey that Randa just wouldn&#39;t. Stop. Laughing., but looking back...

            <p>I couldn’t spot a single mistake. But don’t be too proud now; I’m not a native speaker and our “teacher” may still have to say something. Also story wise, it works well as an introduction of the agents. But I wonder why they didn’t get beds and how they sleep. I expect you to elaborate when you get Permission and continue to write this story arc.<br><br>One tip, though. Leaving empty lines between the paragraphs makes your text more readable; otherwise it may be difficult to determine whether you intend to start a new paragraph when a line incidentally ends near the right margin.

            <p><i>Knock, knock.</i><br><br>“Come in!” called Androia, putting down her book and looking for something to use for a bookmark.. <br><br>“Expletive not translated,” muttered a deep voice from the direction of the door. Androia let the book go and turned to gaze at the stocky male human in the open doorway. The human gazed back with wide eyes.<br><br>“I beg your pardon,” said Androia, “I could not hear you clearly. What did you say?”<br><br>“Uhm, wrong language,” explained the human, distorting his face into an awkward grin.“I meant to say good morning, or whatever time it may be in this corner of Headquarters.” As far as Androia could determine through all the facial hair, the movement of his lips did not match the sound of his words, but she was used to this; very view agents spoke her native language. <br><br>“Good morning, sir,” answerded Androia with a little frown, “it is short after breakfast time for me, and incidentally this is also the announced arrival time for my new partner. So, may I assume – no, you are not possibly a field agent?”<br><br>“Well, this sodden plant gave me a potted cactus flash patch and told me to go to this arr zee,” growled the man, “so what would you think? Having second thoughts about my age? It’s the grey beard, right?”.<br><br>“Come in then, and forgive me if I were unpolite. I should not have jumped to conclusions. I do not know whether you are what I assume you are, and this colour my not have any significance.”<br><br>Surprisingly, Androia could watch the man’s face colour change to match the natural colour of her skin, just before he turned to close the door. “Expletive girl, expletive, human enough,” he murmured. “You didn’t need to step on the other toe. Okay, I’ll calm down, it’s forgiven, you couldn’t know.” When he turned back to face Androia, his skin had paled and the awkward grin was on his face again. “May we start this all over again?” he offered. <br><br>“Welcome to response centre one thousand nine hundred fifty three,” replied Androia, not eager to push one of his berserk buttons again. “My name is Androia Avatar. I am a nigth elf from <i>World of Warcraft</i>. Is it usual to shake hands in your culture?” <br><br>The human stepped forward to grip Androia’s outstretched hand, and then held it a bit firmer and longer than would have been appropriate. “I’m glad to meet you,” he sang out, “and I’m sure we will be a good team.”<br><br>“This is still to be seen,” responded the night elf. “What, did you say, is your name?” Her mysterious new partner let go off her hand and shrank back.<br><br>“Uh, there’s a little problem with this,” he stated. “If you don’t mind, I would like to be anonymous.”<br><br>“Anonymous? That would be ridiculous,” retorted Androia.<br><br>“No, not ridiculous, the name would be Anonymous.”<br><br>“I refuse to work with an anonymous partner!”<br><br>“Ah, well then, if you insist on misspelling my name,” the male gave in, “you may call me Hieronymus. That’s what the Marquis registered anyway.”<br><br>“Agent Hieronymus,” declared Androia, “we need to come to an agreement immediately. If we will be partners, we need to be honest to each other. You have already lied to me at least once.”<br><br>“When did I lie to you?”<br><br>“There is no wrong language for a Universal Translator. You clearly did not say good morning when you entered this room. I will not insist on a translation, nor will I ask why you want to hide your real name. But you have to explain what you meant when you said you were human enough. When we are in a badfic together, I need to know your abilities and limits.”<br><br>Androia had to take breath, and Hieronymus used this pause to interject “I didn’t ask what your abilities and limits are.”<br><br>“You may look me up in the World of Warcraft Wiki; I am a level ten druid, specializing in Healing. Now, what are you?”<br><br>“Okay, I will tell, but it’s a long story.”<br><br>“Then you should start soon.”<br><br>“Well, the essence is that I lived in the PPC archives for some time, until one of DoSAT’s Hollywood Hackers tracked me down and they got me out. They say I’m a digital clone of my original self, and I cannot go home to world one, because there is another me at OFUA, and when Miss Kitty sends her students home at the end of the year, there will be two of us.”<br><br>“That is a bad fate,” empathized Androia, “but how did you get into the archives?”<br><br>“They also threatened me that I might not be able to survive in a world were narrative laws don’t precede scientific laws,” continued Hieronymus, ignoring the question as well as the implications that   mentioning his enrolment at the Official Fanfiction University of Azeroth had given away. “Oh, and the DIA tried to neuralize me before they realized that they cannot send me home, so I actually don’t remember my real name.”<br><br>“This is – “ started Androia, but she never ended the sentence, because this was the moment the console went BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.<br><br>________________________________________________________________________<em><br><br>Author’s notes: <br>The provisional claim of RC 1953 is pending Permission.<br><br>Agent Hieronymus would speak English, but swear in German, if there were no Universal Translators. I imagine that Androia hears everything he says in her native language, so she wouldn’t know the difference. <br><br>In a scene written from Hieronymus’ POV, he would obviously know which language he is using. But trying to speak English and only swear in German would make no sense when he knows that everything is translated for the audience’s convenience, and it would probably break the fourth wall, because the only conceivable reason to do so anyway would be Hieronymus’ attempt to keep his story K-rated for the readers. But then he is wall-breaking anyway?<br><br>So here is a question: Are Universal Translators smart enough to know that, when a person says some words in a language that is not their working language, this should not be translated? Which, in accord with the general mischief of PPC-technology, means that, if Hieronymus swears too much, the UT would no longer realize that Hieronymus native language is not his working language, and would start to translate? <br><br>“&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Universal">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Universal</a></em>Translator&quot;&gt;Of course, they sort of take the fun out of swearing in foreign languages (though some Translators appear to be governed by the Laws of Narrative Comedy in this regard).</a>” Yes, works for me.<br></p>

            <p>You do a good job communicating character through speech in this piece. Spelling out RC phonetically is a particularly nice touch. My favorite bit was probably the exchange of &quot;Anonymous? That would be ridiculous.&quot; &quot;No, not ridiculous, the name would be Anonymous.&quot; I was immediately reminded of the &quot;Surely you can&#39;t be serious&quot; gag from Airplane!.<br><br>I like your take on universal translators. You bring up things (like how lip movement wouldn&#39;t match the words being said) that aren&#39;t typically thought about. Still, I think you&#39;ll find that fictional universal translators have a long history of not translating foreign curse words. But the Laws of Narrative Comedy should work as a decent cover. They certainly did for me when I had Gremlin curse in what probably wasn&#39;t very good Chinese in an old interlude.<br><br>I was a bit confused by the reaction Hieronymus had before he went to close the door. Not by the intent -- he&#39;s obviously sensitive about being a clone -- but by what he specifically said and how quickly he calmed down. It just felt awkward in how it was staged. Maybe if you had stretched that exchange out for a few more sentences; had a bit more of a heated back and forth.<br><br>You should only follow &#39;said so-and-so&#39; with a comma if the dialogue that follows it is part of the same sentence that preceded &#39;said so-and-so.&#39; There are a few run-ons (the paragraphs beginning &quot;I beg your pardon&quot; and &quot;Good morning, sir&quot;) caused by your using commas where you should use period. And while people sometimes do speak in run-on sentences, these particular run-ons sound a bit off.<br><br>Some minor things:<br>-- Spelling: “ &#39;Good morning, sir,&#39; <b>answered</b> Androia with a little frown.&quot;<br>-- You are missing a quotation mark at the beginning of the eighth paragraph.<br>-- There should be a period after &#39;interject&#39; in the twenty-first paragraph.<br>-- Spelling: &quot;...the implications that mentioning his <b>enrollment</b> at the Official Fanfiction University of Azeroth had given away.&quot;</p>

            <p><b>Enrolment</b> is British English, and this is what I learned at school. But I read a lot of American stuff since then, so I am often not aware (or don’t even care) which language I am writing.

            <p>I really liked the contrast between the two characters; I can easily imagine Androia getting fed up with Hieronymus&#39; attitude. Funnily enough, though, what made me grin while reading this was Hieronymus&#39; pronunciation of RC. That was a nice touch.</p>

            <p>I really like this scene.  You&#39;ve set up some nice backstory secrets to discover as these two work together.  You&#39;ve got a nice voice on Androia, too; very formal, which works well next to Hieronymous&#39;s more relaxed tone. I also liked how you handled the swearing in this.  It is a nice little joke, which keeps the rating at family friendly levels, and you can guess what he actually said, if you are so inclined.<br><br>Overall, well done.

            <p>I like dialogue. Of all the elements of storytelling, it&#39;s always come the most naturally for me. I can just about hear my characters&#39; voices when I&#39;m writing them, and it&#39;s fun sounding out particular word choices.<br><br>I&#39;ve got a piece of prequel that I think fits the bill. It was already written, but I&#39;ve tidied it up a little. The rest of the story will be even more dialogue-heavy, once all the necessary descriptions are in place, but I&#39;m not going to be able to write it in time to post here. So, here&#39;s the beginning.<br><br>---<br><br><i>Late 2003</i><br><br>The young twenty-something standing at the counter of the nurses&#39; station was tall—quite a bit taller than Head Nurse Suzine. She had to tilt her head back to look him in the face. It made his thin, slanting eyebrows seem even more arched than they already were, and in her professional opinion, they were approaching Elven Eyebrow o&#39; Doom levels.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;but we just don&#39;t take agents. It&#39;s the Department of <i>Fictional</i> Psychology for a reason, you know. Why don&#39;t you try Medical?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because that&#39;s not what I <i>need</i>,&quot; said the young man. He had a clipped way of speaking, as though each word were a cut-out from a different magazine. The fingers of his left hand drummed an erratic sequence into his thigh. &quot;My body is fine. They don&#39;t want to see me. They have more important things to do.&quot;<br><br>Suzine was not a fan of the disdain with which he spoke the last sentence. &quot;Look, if you think you can stand there and insult our line of work while you insist we make an exception for you, you&#39;ve got—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, what&#39;s up?&quot;<br><br>Suzine turned around to see who had entered the station. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you, Robinson.&quot; The intern, a brown-haired, green-eyed woman a little older than the young man, was a pain in Suzine&#39;s neck. &quot;What do you need? Make it quick.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nurse Dewstan sent me to tell you they were able to release Mulder, but we&#39;ve got a Spike and Angel situation over in 204 and Legolas is back again.&quot; She sounded bored, and immediately broke eye contact with Suzine to peer at the young man. &quot;Who&#39;s this?&quot;<br><br>That was her problem: she never knew when to mind her own business. &quot;Just an agent who thinks he&#39;s somehow more deserving of our time than everyone else in the multiverse. It&#39;s not your concern, Robinson. Tell Nathon—&quot;<br><br>&quot;But maybe I can help,&quot; said the insufferable woman. &quot;Come on—you don&#39;t trust me with the canons, so let me handle this kid. What does he want?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m right here, you know.&quot; The young man folded his arms.<br><br>&quot;He declined to say,&quot; Suzine said archly.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk to anyone who&#39;s not going to help me,&quot; said the young man.<br><br>&quot;Suzine, it isn&#39;t as though you&#39;d be taking me away from anything important,&quot; said Robinson. &quot;<i>They</i> don&#39;t need me.&quot;<br><br>Suzine breathed heavily through her nose, counting to five. Then she threw up her hands. &quot;Fine! Robinson, you can see him in your office. Just stay out of my way, both of you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great!&quot; She beamed and practically skipped out the side door to the station. She tried to take the young man&#39;s hand, but he jerked it away. &quot;Well, this way, then,&quot; she said, spirits somewhat dampened.<br><br>&quot;I want a complete workup, Robinson,&quot; Suzine called, leaning out the front window. &quot;No shirking, no funny business!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No problem!&quot; Entirely too flippant for Suzine&#39;s liking, the girl waved over her shoulder as she led the young man away to C-14.<br><br>---<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m with you 100% when it comes to dialogue. Sometimes I&#39;ll speak lines aloud as my characters (or at least, in terrible impersonations of my characters) just to hear how they would scan. Sure, it&#39;s lead to people questioning my overall sanity, but it&#39;s all for the good of the craft!<br><br>This piece is pretty solid overall. It&#39;s definitely got me interested in seeing the full story when it comes out. I definitely got some sense of each of the three character&#39;s personalities through their vocal choices. Nume has a odd preciseness about him, Suzine is a bit spiky towards others, and Jennifer is cheerful and energetic.<br><br>There were, to my mind, a few issues. For one: &quot;Suzine was not a fan of the disdain with which he spoke the last sentence.&quot; This line feels like it leans a bit more towards telling rather than showing. I would have liked to see Nume&#39;s disdain in his speech by itself. Maybe something like: &quot;They don&#39;t want to see me. They have more... <i>important</i> things to do.&quot;<br><br>When Jennifer says &quot;<i>They</i> don&#39;t need me.&quot; Who is <i>they</i> and why are they deserving of italics? If you&#39;re referring to the canons, the point was already made that she isn&#39;t trusted with them.<br><br>Finally, a little thing that&#39;s more about the PPC than dialogue. According to the wiki, Medical gave up treating the mental issues of deranged agents (or rather, gave up handing out Bleeprin like it was candy) in early 2003 HST. But your story has FicPsych still not addressing the needs of agents in late 2003. I understand that those dates are extremely vague, but there&#39;s still an apparent gap. I guess it can be easily explained away by bureaucratic hemming and hawing. Still, something to consider.</p>

            <p>As said before, it&#39;s a danmaku game that involves dodging bullets (or at least trying to). It&#39;s hard as hell, and I haven&#39;t beaten the 4th level of this game yet, it gets so difficult.<br>It&#39;s fun, though. You should try it.</p>

            <p>I think this mission was a success.  The major point that dawned on me as I read was that it &quot;fit&quot; so well into the LMPverse.  Aside from the one unavoidable badfic scene where Shining Armor got stabbed, all the scenes felt appropriate for a cartoon aimed at children.  One example of this was the relationship between Marvin and Printworthy; their friendship read very naturally to me, very simply buddy-buddy.  Even the more serious ones were handled properly so that they didn&#39;t fly in the face of the canon&#39;s values.  You did this by either toning down violence and aggression (like in the final fight scene), or adding a bit of little silliness when the badfic inflicted overwrought emotion on us (as when Cadence started acting insane--love that &quot;Neighcronomicon&quot; joke, by the way).  At the same time, you still allowed the characters to express emotions appropriate to what was happening around them, which helped the mission get across the damage the continuum was suffering from the badfic.  The absolute epitome of this was the ending scene between Cadence and Shining Armor.  I like that, after the removal of the sparkle specters, the characters still felt the consequences of what they (thought they) had done, and own up to it.  I like it when we show a bit of the canon characters back to normal after a mission; it&#39;s something I need to get better at, myself.  All in all, this mission did an excellent job of involving both the agents (and mini!) and the canon characters in the solution to the badfic problem, even including the Changelings.<br><br>Other things I enjoyed include your excellent use of cartoon physics (another example of making the mission feel in the MLPverse); some of the actions the agents make feel like they belong in the flash cartoon-style MLP.  Your interpretation of the rather unique time distortion&#39;s effects was good as well.  You went beyond stating the agents felt sick from it, and used their speech to demonstrate what was happening to them in a more concrete form for the reader.  Rartiy&#39;s characterization was also excellent, and you made good use involving it in the finale, especially since you had it act through aspects of Discord&#39;s personality.  It was a perfect way to show off the more negative aspects of a mini-Discord&#39;s personality while still keeping the mini allied to the agents and canon.  I also liked that the agents used their foreknowledge of the title to realize what was coming and modify their plans as a result. It&#39;s something that a person reading the badfic would have done, and helps link the reader to the characters.<br><br>There were a couple of very unique things you tried, which I don&#39;t see in missions very frequently, but which you accomplished quite well.  First, you used one of the badfic&#39;s own events (resurrecting Shining Armor) against it.  This doesn&#39;t really make sense when you think about it, but canon <i>is</i> stronger than fic, after all, so I can interpret this as the canon words seeing an opportunity to regain some influence and seizing it.  It wasn&#39;t just a standalone event for convenience&#39;s sake, either, but a clue to the agents as to the nature of the wraiths present in the other canons.  The second, and especially interesting thing, was providing a &quot;rewrite&quot; of Shining Armor&#39;s death scene.  This made stronger the assertion that the death had been neglected by the single paragraph in-fic, and also made it easier for the reader to understand why Marvin got so upset over that, simply by showing (not telling) a very obvious contrast between the two different portrayals of a single scene.  It does contradict our typical reporting (whatever the fic says is what happens, and if the fic says it stupidly, it happens stupidly), but you made this scene do so much work that I personally find that a negligible problem.<br><br>One thing that confused me was the &quot;manes and tails on sticks&quot; thing.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the result of something in the words, but I can&#39;t quite see the connection between what was written in the badfic and what resulted from those words, based on what you show us in the mission right now.  Also, at a couple of points you refer to the MLP characters speaking English.  I doubt the Ponies speak the same languages as appear on Earth, but I know this gets confusing between universal translators and such.<br><br>And now, your first exposure to doctorlit&#39;s really quite obnoxious listing of minor errors he found  (I read the mission yesterday and wrote this comment today, so I apologize if you already fixed any of these):<br><br>&quot;Rather, happiness is a sign to those in the Legal <b>Departments</b> that the agents are getting too comfortable, and need to be reminded of the nature of their work.&quot;  Pretty sure we only have one Legal Department.  I think.  Have I missed anything, guys?<br><br>&quot;Shining Armor and Cadence magically appeared in the middle of the room and, by the sound of it, an argument.&quot;<br>I think a verb &quot;had&quot; is missing in front of &quot;an argument.&quot;  Unless you&#39;re saying that the argument appeared along with the characters, but if so, that sounds a little clunky.<br><br>&quot; . . . said Printworthy. I know how important grooming is for pegasi . . .&quot; A missing open quotation.<br><br>&quot;Printworthy stared, baffled at his <b>surly</b> insane partner . . .&quot;  I <i>think</i> you meant &quot;surely&quot; instead of &quot;surly&quot; here.<br><br>&quot;With a final whistle from the <b>Agent</b>, the Wraith flew out of Cadence’s body . . .&quot;  That should be a lowercase &quot;a,&quot; so as to avoid kidnapping Lily Winterwood&#39;s Time Lord character.<br><br>&quot;&#39;I will open the portal to the Medical <b>department</b>.&#39;&quot;  A capital &quot;D.&quot;<br><br>Finally, the alrights.  &quot;Alright&quot; is not a word; the phrase is &quot;all right.&quot;  I won&#39;t list them all; just use the search function for that.</p>

            <p>This is a very thorough and thought out review, and I thank you for posting it. <br><br>Yes! I was worried some bits got too violent in the mission, so I&#39;m thrilled that you noticed that I tried to make it sound apropriate for the universe of MLP. I thought, if I am going to be writing missions set exclusively in Equestria, I can&#39;t have them feel inappropriate to the tone of the show, as I would be far too hypocritical for blasting fic that felt wrong in a way that was also contradictory to the show. I also thought Marvin and Printworthy should be friends because of this. While agents who can&#39;t stand each other can be funny, it is the Magic of Friendship that will pull these two through.<br><br>I like to explore the effects of badfic, which is why I used the canons in the way I did. Just because they have been released from the Specter&#39;s, erm, Wraith&#39;s grasp, it does not mean the fic never happened. The end scene with Shining Armor and Cadence is one of my favorites, as it drives home one of the points I tried to make: this story can work. Yes, as it is, the fic sucks, but the core story has such potential it <i>hurts!</i> So, I take glimpses into &#39;what could have been,&#39; to both tell good fic and to show how it is done.<br><br>Ah, Rartiy. You know, I missed this mini the first few times I read it. Originally the mini was going to be griffon. Turns out, in Equestria, griffin is spelled griffon, as shown in the merch and the episode &#39;Griffon the Brush Off.&#39; I was so sad to lose my mini, but then I found Rartiy and, well, you saw what happened from there. Rartiy&#39;s personality is a bit of Discord blended with the drama of Rarity, as well as her pension for &#39;organized chaos.&#39; This was not too evident in this mission, but will come to provide Printworthy with no shortage of headaches.<br><br>I debated with myself for a long time on how to present Shining Armor&#39;s death. I wanted to do the rewrite version, which I did, yet I also knew how the PPC usually treats these scenes. In the end, I desided that ultimately what was important was that the Agents were physically there in the fic. The paragraph left too little information to make a joke out of, so I showed how it &#39;really&#39; happened. I am thrilled so many people like that scene, and that I had made the right decision. <br><br>The Wigs-on-Sticks were made because when the badfic tried to insert description, it always described the pony&#39;s mane. It was jarring and very sudden when it happened, so I desided to make the strange mane descriptions a joke item. Perhaps if you read the fic, it would be funnier. Sadly, the fic is deleted, though I do have it saved. Oh well.<br><br>I think I remember one of the ponies referencing English in the show, though I may be wrong. I do know that Equestrian is suspiciously like English though, so perhaps I&#39;ll make a joke out of that.<br><br>Ah, more things to change. Some things I caught, others are new to me. However, I will not be changing the alrights. To me, alright and all right are two similar, but different phrases. Alright is a synonym for acceptable, fine, OK, ect. All Right means correct, factual, ect. Plus, alright is becoming more widespread and accepted, enough that my Kindle dictionary recognises it as a word, with the definition I used. So, to do my part to make alright an accepted word, I will use it when appropriate. Thank you, though, for voicing your concern.<br><br>Thank you so much for this review. I am thrilled you enjoyed it, and I hope the next one is as good, if not better.</p>

            <p>I <i>could</i> post the descriptions, since I have a copy of the badfic, but now that you&#39;ve said that the fic is deleted, I&#39;m having second thoughts. Was the fic deleted before or after you sporked it? Apparently, the author knew that his fic wasn&#39;t as good as it should have been.<br><br>As for the question of how the wigs on sticks came about, it was due to clumsy phrasing. Since the mission almost quotes the text leading to the Cadence wig verbatim, I&#39;m not that squeamish about posting that:<br><i>Shining Armor told his pink alicorn wife with a long blonde mane and tail that has shades of dark pink and purple in it as he wiped the tears from her purple eyes &quot;hey don&#39;t worry there&#39;s no way i&#39;ll let a griffon/ changeling hybrid get the best of me plus do you want them to attack and take over Canterlot.&quot;</i><br><br>The author clearly intended to integrate a description of Cadence into the sentence, but as PPC humor requires badly-written sentences to be interpreted in the most humorous way possible, <i>voilà!</i> Shining is talking to Cadence while holding a Cadence-mane wig!<br><br>Similar clumsy phrasing led to the Twilight and Celestia wigs.</p>

            <p>I only learned that it was deleted because I was looking to provide links to the badfic for the Wiki and other such places. So, I can&#39;t be sure when it was deleted, though it was up while I was sporking it, and a good way into it. However, this is not the first time the author has done this. He likes to put his stories up, leave them there for a few months, then take them down and put them back up with relatively minor canon edits and barley any grammar changes. He&#39;s allowed because he&#39;s making it &quot;up to date,&quot; when really, he&#39;s just having his story on the front page. I may seem like I&#39;m attacking the guy, but when I watched him do the same basic thing to three other stories, I feel fairly safe on this assumption. So no, he does not think it could be better. He wants more traffic.<br><br>Also, based on my philosophy on how works are separate from their creators, I may post the whole thing. I&#39;d have it as a link only view at the end of the mission so that nobody could just stumble across it and bring the guy any more embarrassment then the mission itself would. I would also note that he is likely to come out with a (slightly) edited version at some point, and encourage readers to see his new work and support his improvement as a writer. He seems like a nice guy, just a bad writer who has (thus far) ignored criticism of his work. I want to bring support to his new works, while also laughing at the old, worse ones.<br><br>...That said, this is not likely the last fic from dbzponyninja that Marvin and Printworthy will &#39;fix.&#39; Really, he seems to be a good guy with an honest heart and some great ideas, but just terrible writing. All of his fics so far have been bad. All of them. I&#39;m almost convinced he is the nicest troll ever.</p>

            <p>Mini-Aragogs were considered to be small acromantulas rather than simply little versions of Aragog from the beginning, and they were the second or third mini to be created, so not every character-derived mini has to <i>be</i> the character, just a being with a similar appearance and some similar personality traits, such as a propensity for chaos with the mini-Discords. But the mini-Aragogs are still called mini-Aragogs, because that&#39;s what they are and that&#39;s what they&#39;ve been for years.<br><br>What I think World-Jumper meant was that he was planning on fleshing out mini-Discords as a mini species capable of more variance than their name would imply, like the mini-Aragogs are. It makes sense, since Discord is a spirit of chaos, after all, and his mini-selves would probably be opposed to acting the same, especially if they already have to look the same. I don&#39;t think World-Jumper wanted to change the species name. If he did, he probably wouldn&#39;t have called Rartiy a mini-Discord in his mission.</p>

            <p>Discord is referred to as a draconequus, so that makes him a draconequus, doesn&#39;t it? Even if his design was based off the Chimera, that doesn&#39;t make him one.

            <p>Couple of minor things, though: faithful is spelled thus and occasionally you call the wraiths Sparkle Spectres rather than Shimmer Spectres. Other than that, it&#39;s a great fic.

            <p>I think Wobbles may well be my favorite agent right now. If your characters stay this consistently awesome, I can tell your missions are going to be a treat!

            <p>I know <i>literally nothing</i> about MLP, and I still loved this mission so very much. The bits from the perspectives of inanimate objects, especially the RC who just wants peace and quiet, were my favourite parts, I think, because they were both funny and, in the case of the second RC POV, oddly, unexpectedly, poignant.

            <p>I really liked the way this one started. Most first missions either aren&#39;t really an Agent&#39;s first excursion into the Word Worlds, personal chrononology-wise, or have the supposedly fresh-from-recruitment Agents jump right in, taking to the experience in a strangely natural way. It was nice to see Printworthy being somewhat anxious about his first mission and see Marvin have no idea how to work the console. It felt very genuine.<br><br>There seems to have been a consistent name misspelling here. In every official work I&#39;ve seen, the alicorn known here as &quot;Princess Cadence&quot; was spelled as &quot;Princess Cadance&quot;. I noticed the &quot;Cadence&quot; spelling in both the badfic quotes and in the Agents&#39; dialogue; while the instances of the former would simply cause the team&#39;s first mini-Discord to fly around and pester people far before Rartiy shows up, the instances of the latter should be fixed, unless the &quot;Cadence&quot; spelling is supported by another official source that I&#39;m just unaware of. Actually, since every time Princess Cadance should appear in the original badfic, the misspelled name is shown instead, under normal circumstances the mini-Discord would either take her place in the story, which is beyond suggestion at this point since it would require too much rewriting and take out some of the mission&#39;s best scenes, or follow her around, copying her actions and speech, which isn&#39;t used very often in the PPC, but it would stave off the potential problem of rewriting a load of descriptions and would also be funny to watch.<br><br>&quot;Printworthy’s quill stopped as he slowly raised his head, watching the once proud Captain of the Royal Guard get reduced into having the vocal capabilities of a foal who had just learned how to speak, only with far less enduringness, and much more mental pain.&quot; Is it Printworthy who is experiencing mental pain here, or Shining Armor? The way the sentence is phrased now, it seems to say that Shining Armor is speaking with more mental pain than usual, but that doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense for Printworthy to recount, unless he&#39;s telepathic. It would make sense if Printworthy&#39;s mind was hurting as he watches Shining Armor act in such an undignified manner, but the sentence doesn&#39;t imply that. Also, something about the word &quot;enduringness&quot; is rubbing me the wrong way. It&#39;s a real word, at least according to Google, but it seems out of place somehow. It might be connected to the same confusion involving the owner of the aforementioned mental pain.<br><br>&quot;intently, waiting for the three to use it, waiting to see how the spell works.&quot; The tense switches to present from past at the end of the sentence there. It should probably say &quot;would work&quot; instead of &quot;works&quot;.<br><br>&quot;At some point though the reading, they said nothing slightly different, but whatever it was, it was clearly the right way&quot; I&#39;m just confused on what&#39;s being said here. Judging by the sentence directly before it, &quot;The mares began to read once more, silence echoing though the room, building in strength&quot;, I think it might have denoted that all of a sudden, the two ponies began to be silent correctly, but that&#39;s just odd to me. Is there a wrong way to be silent? As long as no noise is emitted, silence is only affected by the context it exists in, right? I think that&#39;s how it works. Is that line paraphrased from a badfic quote? I liked most of your paraphrasings, since they translated the original badfic&#39;s ungrammatical mush into coherent actions and descriptions. However, if this was one of them, it might be best to leave it in its original form, because it wouldn&#39;t be beyond a badfic to make vaguely baffling claims on the correctness of a silence, so the section would make more sense, in a roundabout way at least.<br><br>That climax was awesome, by the way. My favorite parts were the scenes where Cadance was exorcizing Twilight and when the changelings turned against the Hybrids. I liked both scenes for entirely different reasons, and since you put a couple of great tonal shifts in there so that the story cuts between and captures the Agents&#39; attitudes, the emotional responses of the ponies, and the simple, pragmatic malice of the changelings, it doesn&#39;t feel like anything was out of place, even though there was so much going on. I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing more from these two!</p>

            <p>I thought that the first mission should actually be their first mission. Marvin had some training before, and Printworthy was shown some of the ropes by Marvin beforehand, but otherwise, this is their first time actually on the field. The console VS Marvin gag is going to continue, with Marvin continually thinking that he finally has it figured out, and the console proving that he does not. It will just build and build until finally Marvin and the console have a sit-down together and talk out their differences. Or something. I don&#39;t know, we&#39;ll see what happens.<br><br>On Cadence VS Cadance. This is something of a debate that honestly, I&#39;m just going to leave alone. In the credits to the season three opener they spelled it Cadence, as well in some of the books that nobody reads and promotional material for the Royal Wedding. Cadence is also a musical term, as you know, and fits better with the pony name formula. However, in most of the toys and the credits to Equestria Girls, it&#39;s spelled Cadance. So, which is the &#39;canon&#39; spelling? Probably Cadance, but Cadence is so wide-spread and used in canon as well, I&#39;m just going to accept both as canon, so no mini-Discords from either spelling.<br><br>What I was trying to say with that sentence is that babies mangled english is endearing, but Shining Armor&#39;s is painful to hear. I see what your saying though, and I&#39;ll see how to fix that line to make it more clear.<br><br>Whoops, my mistake. I&#39;ll fix it when I can.<br><br>Alright, I&#39;ll explain the silence magic. The reason I went with silence magic is because the badfic never said how the spell was cast, only that it was read. So, because there was no information on the nature of the spell, I decided to make it the crashing tones of silence. Then, later, the badfic said, &quot;Twilight agreed as he and Princess Celestia reread the book again and performed the spell once again this time the right way.&quot; So, since the spell was merely cast again, only the right way, I had the silence spoken again, only the right way. I may change the &#39;silence magic,&#39; but I think I&#39;m going to just leave this as it is. I see what you are saying, I just don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth it to change it.<br><br>Well, thank you. I had a heck of a time thinking of an ending, and Herr Wozzeck gave me the great suggestion of absolute chaos breaking out in the middle of the charge list. I took that idea and ran with it, making it as chaotic and clustered as I could, while still having the story make sense. I think my favorite parts were between Marvin and Cadence, as she finally got to express the grief she had bottled up inside this entire fic, through beating the tar out of Marvin. Plus, I think this was the first instance of a canon character performing an exorcism. Am I correct in saying this? I think I am.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you liked it! Hopefully the next one won&#39;t take near as long to write! I&#39;ll be tackling the worst Gary Stu I have ever seen for the next one, and then... My Little Unicorn. <br><br>DUN DUN DUN!<br><br>Actually, I might take on My Little Unicorn next, though if I do, I may need some help. This is not a hint for people to start agreeing to help tackle that monstrosity, I&#39;m just thinking ahead.</p>

            <p>There are three or four My Little Unicorn stories, though. Which one are you going after? Is it one of the ones that takes place in space? Because dropping Marvin and Printworthy in the middle of a space battle between three-horned alicorns would be the cruellest kind of hilarious. (I don&#39;t actually know if there are any space battles; I&#39;ve never read any of the series. I don&#39;t doubt that there are, though.)<br><br>I&#39;d seen the Season Three credits instance of &quot;Cadence&quot;, but I&#39;d just thought it was a typo, since the rest of the material that I&#39;d seen had it spelled &quot;Cadance&quot;. If it appears officially in other official media, though, I suppose it can count as apocryphal canon or something. That&#39;s fine, then.<br><br>Regarding the &quot;silence&quot; lines: I can see what you meant now, but considering that the previous mention of the spell as silence was several pages before, maybe you could just rephrase the disputed section to be a little clearer. Maybe something like &quot;At some point, the rippling of silence slightly changed, differing from the previous soundless spell in a way that, somehow, seemed to be indescribably more correct than the last reading.&quot;<br><br>Extending from that, maybe the altered version of the disputed Shining Armor description can just be a modified version of that sentence you just used while referring to it, i.e. &quot;reduced into having the vocal capabilities of a foal who had just learned how to speak. However, while a foal&#39;s messy language could potentially be considered endearing, Shining Armor&#39;s was simply painful to listen to.&quot;<br>Maybe that was my problem with the word &quot;enduringness&quot;. Because it was probably supposed to be referring to something as &quot;endearing&quot; rather than &quot;enduring&quot;.</p>

            <p>Having worked on that mission, I think I deserve one of those, don&#39;t you think?<br><br>As for the story itself, you did quite a good job. I like the way that you&#39;ve dealt with the suggestions that I made, especially the introduction of the term &quot;Shimmer Specter.&quot; And congratulate your brother on a job well done; the formatting is just as it should be—with the exception of one word. He missed &quot;definetly&quot;; that should be italicized.<br><br>Overall, a very good mission, and I like the A/N that you put at the end. BTW, I believe you meant to say <i>wasted</i> potential, not <i>waited</i> potential.<br><br>Hopefully the next mission will not take another year to type. If so, I might have the entirety of <i>Lost Luster</i> up by then!<br><br>PS..: A few errors that you might want to fix:<br><i>&quot;The Pegasus blinked for a few moments, processing the unicorn’s strange explanation.&quot;</i><br>&quot;Pegasus&quot; should have a lowercase P there. Microsoft Word AutoCorrects &quot;pegasus&quot; to &quot;Pegasus,&quot; so please keep an eye on that in future missions.<br><br><i>&quot;Oh! I see what you did there! Shimmer Specters, that’s an interesting name for them.&quot;</i><br>&quot;Shimmer Specters&quot; should be enclosed in single quotes.<br><br><i>“No, really, wrap it up! The Changelings are-!”</i><br>That should be an em dash at the end there, not a hyphen. If your keyboard has a number pad, the command to input an em dash is ALT + 0151. Otherwise (assuming that you are typing in Microsoft Word), you can use two hyphens. Word will AutoCorrect the two hyphens into an em dash after you finish typing the next word.</p>

            <p>...so far this has been my favorite first mission from anyone in the PPC. Only this time, it&#39;s <i>so</i> much better with the new action climax.

            <p>My younger brother plays our party&#39;s Rogue and he&#39;s such a power gamer that his character has more hit points and healing surges than our Warlord. (There are only three of us plus the DM, so our Warlord has been trying to build himself like a tank. If my brother didn&#39;t spend hours maxing out his character, our tank would actually be able to, you know, do his job.) <br><br>I&#39;m the liability in our group. My Wizard&#39;s Constitution score is 8, so she actually has FIVE healing surges instead of six+ like most Wizards would. If you don&#39;t mind me giving a tip: focus your damage on one or two more threatening enemies at a time and let the party&#39;s controller wipe out the minions. Focusing damage instead of spreading it around will take out monsters faster and leave fewer that can hit you. It really works- my group got pitted against fifteen Orc minions and five... berserkers, I think... plus their pet Owlbear. The only one who took any damage that battle was the Rogue because he had the brilliant idea to perform in the Owlbear Rodeo.</p>

            <p>Since you&#39;re a Sorcerer, you would focus on taking out the minions while the rest of your group ganged up on the nastier foes. Also, I suggest you keep an eye out for some Shimmering Armor (Adventurer&#39;s Vault 1). It basically negates the opportunity attacks that you provoke when you used a ranged attack when next to an enemy.

            <p>Hey! <br>So, I&#39;ve seen some Dungeons &amp; Dragons players around recently, and I had yet another of my ideas that will probably never work.<br>Ah well.<br>Anyway, I was thinking that we could create a D&amp;D geared towards the PPC. Like, instead of dragons and bugbears, we could have Mary Sues and other creatures in badfic. And instead of the character classes, we could just have different types of Agents. And, you know, modify the character sheets. A campaign could center around a specific fandom, and a big event happening in it. I don&#39;t know.<br>The name I came up with was Fandoms &amp; Fanfics, or F&amp;F, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.<br>If this actually worked, we could all pitch in to make &#39;monster&#39; sheets and such.<br>So, feedback?<br><p><br>~Kitty</p></p>

            <p>GURPS might work.  It is the system that they use in the Discworld RPG, after all.  I used a seriously simplified version for my own Discworld game, and such a system would be perfect for the PPC.  You can really focus on role-playing.<br><br>Another choice, which would give greater diversity to your agents, might be BESM (Big Eyes, Small Mouth).  Since it was designed to encompass all varieties of anime, you might have a Magical Girl and an Android Battle-Maid working together.  Or a Tech Genius and a Ninja.  Or a Detective and a Sentai team member (think Power Rangers).  All of these combinations, and more, are possible.<br><br>Because of the broad range of anime, you can have high magic and high tech in the same game, which I think is important for the PPC.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Back when I read Inheritance Cycle fanfic (yes, you all can laugh at me now), someone wrote their version of book four.

Anyways, the author wrote too much for one book and split it into two. Unfortunately, they gave up half way through the sequel.

            <p>I&#39;m a <i>huge</i> fan of the BBC series Hyperdrive. It&#39;s kind of a spiritual successor to Red Dwarf, it&#39;s got Nick Frost (of &quot;starring Simon Pegg and&quot; fame) at the conn, it mercilessly takes the mickey out of TOS-era Trek... what&#39;s not to like?</p>

            <p>... because I was posting from work last night, right before closing (and needed to get out of there right away).<br><br>It&#39;s closer to a mystery/urban fantasy crossover than SF, but I really like the Lord Darcy stories by Randall Garrett.  (I haven&#39;t read any of the continuations by other authors.)  It&#39;s an alternate history with two major changes from our world; Richard the Lionheart survived to become a good king, and the laws of magic were codified in the middle ages.  Lord Darcy is the chief investigator for the Duke of Normandy, assisted by a forensic sorcerer.</p>

            <p>I always recommend Iain M. Banks&#39; <i>The Culture</i> series, which is so obscure it only has two &#39;fics in the Pit (both are meh crossovers, by the way). It&#39;s an awesome series and the books are surprisingly deep for sci-fi, though some of them are really depressing. Oh, and the last one&#39;s pretty bad.<br>Other than that... I read an obscure sci-fi novel called <i>The Forge of Mars</i> by one Bruce Balfour some years ago and quite enjoyed it.</p>

            <p>Warbreaker is probably my favorite of his books. All the characters were great, especially Lightsong. It was also awesome how it was able to take color changing hair, which is normally a Sue characteristic and turn in into a display of character development. Awakening was also a great magic system, and he managed to show how such a system would create superstition.<br><br>As for his short stories, I recommend I Hate Dragons. The main character has two &#39;knacks&#39;: he smells good to dragons; and he can hear spelling, punctuation, and grammar. Both of these annoy him.

            <p>I really enjoy the Garrett, P.I. books. It&#39;s about the cases of a hardboiled detective living in a city in a fantasy reality, encountering the fantasy standards like gods and wizards, and a few less-than-usual features like a psychic ghost haunting its own body, but focuses on using the fantasy elements to tell its detective stories instead of it just being one genre with elements of the other running about in the background. Not every book has been great, but most of them were a lot of fun. The same author&#39;s also made a few other series, but I&#39;ve only read his space opera one all the way through. It contained intangible space sharks and a race of people that comb the galaxy for free-floating FTL communication crystals with the help of giant psychic starfish, though, so I&#39;m glad I spent the time.<br><br>Also, if fantasy Internet works also count, I&#39;ve liked all of the <a href="http://www.rice-boy.com/">Overside</a> webcomics I&#39;ve read so far. I&#39;ve not caught up with Vattu, but I&#39;m planning on dedicating a few hours to it in the near future. I always enjoy the Overside comics more when I have time to look through several dozen pages in one sitting.</p>

            <p>One of my favourite authors is Susan Cooper, and not just for The Dark Is Rising, which is perhaps her best-known work. King of Shadows made me cry, Seaward is just... beautiful, and so on. And her stuff is just the beginning. I have read an absurd amount of books in the past threeish years, and most of them have been fantasy. Robin McKinley&#39;s worldbuilding is <i>fantastic</i>.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>So, I guess I&#39;m currently the newest Boarder.

I don&#39;t see it as bad so much as not really worth the time it takes to read.)<br><br>I&#39;m aware of just how bad C*l*br**n is. Don&#39;t try to link me to it or the other bleepfics. My Immortal is always good for a laugh, though.<br><br>As for how I found this place, I can&#39;t really remember. I think I was reading some Sue Slayer fics on the Pit and stumbled across some of these about a year ago. After I finished those I mostly forgot about it. A few days ago I stumbled across a link to the wiki, and a few days later decided to start posting.<br><br>Does anyone have any questions they want to ask?</p>

            <p>Colours in gemstones - a category that I&#39;m pretty sure includes ilum crystals - are simply chemical impurities that got into the stone. The ruby, for instance, is only red because some chromium got in there. Since the construction of artificial diamonds and other precious stones is commonplace even today (industrial diamonds are admittedly not gem-quality, but w/e.), it is not that big of an ask for the boffins at DoSAT to synthesise an ilum crystal containing the particular chemical impurities to render the beam blello.<br><br>Why you&#39;d <i>want</i> to, of course, is a different matter. =]<br><br>--parp</p>

If your clue for &quot;fried chicken&quot; is pronounced exactly like &quot;fried chicken&quot;, someone would call you on that. I can&#39;t recall what the game uses to track who&#39;s winning, though, so I don&#39;t know if points would be deducted, but there is probably some sort of penalty.</p>

            <p>mostly about my sis&#39;s agent, to specify she has two ideas an attack on titan agent or a magical girl agent and the problem is that o-so very simple one, which one should we do.  <br><br>With the magical girl agent she used a random generator to get the description (body and powers mostly) but she doesn&#39;t have a fanfic or anything to describe the world her agent came from (at the moment at lest).<br><br>The attack on titan agent, is just a girl from the continuum she has the gear, the swords, and is possibly a titan shifter (my idea) but we are unsure if we want to do that part.<br><br>So state your opinions and give us some help, its always appreciated.  Also (just so everyone isn&#39;t completely confused) Linda, Dean, and this girl meet up AT the PPC (the girl arrives at the PPC first then Linda and Dean meet her, become friends/teammates, do missions together, and so on and so forth.)   <br><br>P.S.

            <p>Which is use both. I mean I originally came up with Apollo (who is an OC from a scrapped version of my original writing/story thing), then came up with Kelly to support him. I also had at that point the idea for an Agent from a lesser-played video game called Spiral Knights, and was struggling to work out which one to use.

            <p>It&#39;s not unheard of for original characters coming from actual unpublished fiction to unexpectedly drop in the PPC and hang around-- <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Miah_Arthur">Agent Miah Arthur</a> is an example of this. Besides, a plothole dragging an OC into HQ doesn&#39;t need to be explained: that is the very nature of plotholes themselves.<br><br>The SNK agent sounds cool, but I&#39;d recommend to drop the shifter idea if she&#39;s going to kill badfic. That&#39;s getting dangerously close to Speshul, because it&#39;s both a rare power (we still don&#39;t understand how Shifters work) and a complete game breaker for PPC missions. Besides, where are you going to use those powers? Most &#39;verses don&#39;t have people randomly shift into Titans.<br><br>Or you <i>could</i> have her go into External Security... Things get pretty hairy when defending HQ from extradimensional threats, so I&#39;d love to see how that plays out... <br><br><br>Another great tool you can use to help guide yourself is Huinesoron&#39;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?pli=1&amp;formkey=dExsRGpKMzhPbWVnTlB6TmJVdEttc1E6MQ#gid=0">Permission Self-Check</a>.

            <p>You wouldn&#39;t expect a Time Lord organization to stay down from something as simple as a thread being pushed from its place, would you? Well, that&#39;s not going to happen again for a while. The threads on the Other Board hardly <i>ever</i> move!<br><br>A summary in case you need to be refreshed or you didn&#39;t read the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=252261;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">original thread</a>: the PPC&#39;s Time Lord Agents have formed a Continuity Council, which was designed ostensibly to watch over canon and keep it stable, but in practice seems largely concerned with bickering between its members. Several Boarders decided after the Council had been formed to write minutes on some of the Council&#39;s meetings, which continued until the thread was pushed off of the front page. So, I decided to move copies of the original scripts to the Other Board so that people could keep working on them if they wanted to. I wouldn&#39;t want the fun to stop just because the original thread is out of most peoples&#39; way! I&#39;m only including the sequence dealing with the aforementioned Council meetings, though, because it was both the section that was left unfinished and the section that the Boarders seemed to most enjoy working on.<br>Huinesoron has compiled the original thread&#39;s in-character sections, including the scripts, into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uy4SLX7yyCfirx6yCfOFrKdl9uK_wpFsqbnIevZEOFQ/pub">this Google Docs page</a>, which I&#39;m adding here as an additional reference. I wanted to put in all of the scripts here in their initial form, though, both to keep the natural progression going and to keep the individual sections distinct while we&#39;re still in the process of finishing the story.</p>

            <p>Well played.<br><br>---<br><br>Notary [clearly relishing the infighting a little bit]: A-hem. If it please the Council, I have composed a short preliminary constitution for our dealings.

Any questions?<br><br>Reader: ... is it over?<br><br>Disentangler: How is it possible for a single person to contain that much legalese?<br><br>Morgan: Do you just not need to breathe or something? How can you exist without breathing?<br><br>Notary: I was primarily concerned with your comprehension of the preliminary constitution, but if you wish to behave like the gang of slovenly renegades you are, perhaps I need to express myself more clearly-<br><br>Disentangler: Morgan, you&#39;ve set her off again!<br><br>Fisherman [jamming his fingers in his ears and burrowing under the table]: If I can&#39;t hear it, it&#39;s not really happening, if I can&#39;t hear it, it&#39;s not really happening...<br><br>Morgan: Ugh. Notary. For the love of... whatever you hold dear, I don&#39;t know, well-organized filing systems or something, just shut up. Please.<br><br>Notary: Why, of all the - I&#39;ve never been so insulted!<br><br>Morgan: Only &#39;cause you weren&#39;t paying attention, now shut. Up.<br><br>Notary: Feh. I don&#39;t know why I expected better from you and the rest of these exiled miscegenators. Oh, if only Rassilon could see what his people are reduced to-<br><br>Reader: Yeah, sure! If Rassilon was here, everything&#39;d be A-okay! Just so long as we, you know, tried to destroy the universe and all of reality! Oh, and behaved like good little thought-slaves, can&#39;t forget that!<br><br>Notary: Our Lord President was doing what he thought best for the Time Lords and for Gallifrey, as was his right-<br><br>Reader: His RIGHT? Morgan, where didja dig this one up, I want it carpet bombed-<br><br>Morgan [screaming herself hoarse]: ENOUGH!<br><br>[The room falls silent.]<br><br>Morgan [much quieter now]: Enough. Especially you, Notary. Just sit down. This isn&#39;t going to be like the High Council. Nobody here is Rassilon. Nobody here is above another. We are just trying to do what&#39;s right for Gallifrey and for the plot of our home. Remember that? Good. Now then... thank you for your proposals, Spinel Promotor, I&#39;ll bear them in mind when we draft our constitution. All of us. Together. All in favour?<br><br>[Everyone raises their hands, even the Notary, albeit with a hint of bad grace about it.]<br><br>Morgan: Good. Now. Who&#39;s got something to talk about who isn&#39;t the Notary do I have to duct-tape your mouth shut or something?<br><br>Notary: Are your particular preferences really suitable for airing at a solemn gather-<br><br>Morgan: AUGH!<br><br>Reader: I&#39;ve got something to say.<br><br>Morgan: Alright, you have the floor. [to herself] Deep breaths, Morgan, deep breaths...<br><br>Reader: Are you sure there&#39;s nobody above another in this room? Because you seem to be railroading us quite a bit, and that&#39;s how it all started-<br><br>[Morgan&#39;s collar switches off as her head bounces repeatedly off the table.]<br><br>Fisherman: ...

This is entirely unnecessary-<br><br>Morgan: Nuh-uh. That legal mumbo-jumbo that came outta your face like a busted dam, that was unnecessary. Calling us exiles like we were war criminals or something was unnecessary. This? Entirely justified. The council does not recognise your complaints.<br><br>Notary: Well!

Hey, look, we did something, guys! We actually made a decision! Was that so hard?<br><br>[The Notary motions to speak, but thinks better of it.]<br><br>Morgan: And the Notary&#39;s learning too.

Why would we want to?<br><br>Fisherman: It was the Notary.<br><br>Morgan: Of course it was the Notary. Who else would it be?<br><br>Notary: As we possess superior intelligence, although it would be difficult to discern this fact from these gatherings--<br><br>Fisherman: Hey!<br><br>Reader: You do realize, of course, that it would be extremely difficult for us to actually prove superior intelligence to every single person in HQ? They&#39;re pretty varied.<br><br>Librarian: /thoughtfully/ True, although with all of us together, we might well be--<br><br>Morgan: Can we focus? Notary, we&#39;re not taking over HQ.<br><br>Notary: /snidely/ Of course you would curtail the--<br><br>Fisherman: Does anyone else hear that?<br><br>Disentangler: Hear what?<br><br>Agent: Wait, is that--?<br><br>Reader: That sounds very familiar...<br><br>Librarian: /to the Notary/ It is not a question of denying ourselves the right to our proper place, but rather the denial of a wish to stage a coup against the Flowers--<br><br>Morgan: We&#39;re not staging any coups! No one is staging--<br><br>Fisherman: Um, Morgan, Librarian--<br><br>Morgan: Not now, busy--<br><br>Doctor: ...so, what&#39;s going on here, then?<br><br>Disentangler: Well, you see, it started when...<br><br>/Morgan, the Librarian, and the Notary are now engaged in a shouting match/<br><br>Doctor: ...a Continuity Council?<br><br>Reader: It&#39;s...been interesting. I mean, we&#39;ve withstood a Dalek invasion--<br><br>Fisherman: It was only Fearn, wasn&#39;t that much of an invasion--<br><br>Reader: --and, well, the Notary&#39;s always one to withstand--<br><br>Notary: Excuse me?<br><br>Reader: --and no one&#39;s shown more than a few false alarms in the way of wanting to follow Rassilon, so, generally speaking, we&#39;re doing pretty well!<br><br>Disentangler: /dryly/ We also manage to get things done, from time to time.<br><br>Doctor: A Continuity Council.<br><br>Morgan: Doctor, when did you get here?<br><br>Doctor: Oh, I just--popped in--/to Notary/ um, you were saying?<br><br>Notary: You would agree, Doctor, that Time Lords possess superior intellect--<br><br>Reader: Oh, do shut up for a change, we can&#39;t possibly prove--<br><br>Agent: Maybe we should try to. It would keep her quiet, if nothing else--<br><br>Morgan: I think you&#39;re missing the fact that even if we could prove &#39;superior intelligence&#39; we won&#39;t be staging any coups--<br><br>Doctor: What&#39;s this, then?<br><br>Disentangler: /rolls eyes/ The Notary&#39;s latest idea is to take over HQ.<br><br>Morgan: Nothing to worry about, we stop most of her ideas. Shouldn&#39;t you have a companion?<br><br>Doctor: She&#39;s at home, actually.<br><br>Agent: Shouldn&#39;t you have regenerated by now?<br><br>Doctor: Oi! Nothing wrong with this body!<br><br>Reader: /quietly/ Well, if you like floppy hair...<br><br>Fisherman: And bow-ties, for that matter.<br><br>Librarian: Could we perhaps return to our true objective for this meeting?<br><br>Morgan: Yes, of course.<br><br>/pause/<br><br>Doctor: So, what&#39;s this meeting about? Vacations? Intelligence? Jammy dodgers?<br><br>Fisherman: I think it had something to do with mapping Gallifrey&#39;s position in the sky from multiple planets...and there was definitely something about duct tape and the Notary...<br><br>--<br>I keep feeling like I&#39;m missing a Time Lord, but there just aren&#39;t too many of them, are there...I mean, we&#39;ve got Morgan, the Fisherman, the Disentangler, the Agent, the Librarian, the Notary, and the Reader...and I think that&#39;s everyone, isn&#39;t it?

We know what a subcontinuum is.<br><br>Doctor: Well I don&#39;t!<br><br>Agent: [whispers to the Doctor] You know jumpers? And you&#39;ve got all these fibers that make it up? If that&#39;s a continuum, a subcontinuum is like a bobble on the jumper. It&#39;s part of it but... not part of it.

All of you are children, bickering and squawking back and forth.<br><br>Reader: Oh really? How old are you, then, Notary?<br><br>Notary: When you address me, you address the office of Spinel Promontor - adjust your tone to suit, Citrine Theorist.<br><br>Librarian: You avoided the question, &#39;Spinel Promontor&#39; - how old are you?<br><br>Notary: As if it is relevant - 186.<br><br>Fisherman: Excellent!<br><br>Librarian: What about the Notary being 186 is excellent?<br><br>Fisherman: Well, I was seriously worried about being the youngest one here...<br><br>Disentangler: [Bursts out laughing] Hang on! 186? I was still doing my research project at the Academy when I was 186.<br><br>Notary: Which shows a distinct lack of academic aptitude, clearly.<br><br>Doctor: I never finished mine - I wasn&#39;t allowed. They never could get over that incident with the rhinoceros and the kangaroos.<br><br>Notary: So it was you who inspired those safety posters - I might have known.<br><br>Morgan: [Retrieves a small microphone like device from under the table] OKAY! EVERYBODY PLEASE SHUT YOUR RESPECTIVE PIE HOLES!<br><br>Fisherman: What on many, many Earths is that?<br><br>Morgan: AN AMPLIFICATION DEVICE. MAYBE YOU&#39;LL LISTEN TO ME NOW.

Who are you lot then?<br><br>11th Doctor: I remember, it&#39;s the Northern one - hello there! Wow... I&#39;d almost forgotten about the ears, those are quite something.<br><br>Reader: Er, Morgan - I think we might have found our first official item of business, because I&#39;m pretty sure what&#39;s happening right now can&#39;t actually happen.</p>

Right.<br><br>11th Doctor: Yes. Exactly.<br><br>9th Doctor: Well, the one in yellow&#39;s right - this can&#39;t happen.<br><br>11th Doctor: You&#39;d be amazed how often I hear that.<br><br>9th Doctor: Oh, I know. &#39;That&#39;s impossible, Doctor!&#39; &#39;Doctor, that doesn&#39;t make any sense!&#39; &#39;Doctor, I don&#39;t-&#39;<br><br>11th Doctor: &#39;-understand!&#39; Yep, that&#39;s the one.

I would never &#39;misfile&#39; anything.<br><br>Morgan: Antrilovorasilendar, First Taxation-Related Intermediary of the Arcadian 7th District Council Reasonable Expenses Subcommittee.

Hey, Fisherman?<br><br>Fisherman: [Through the amplification device] YES?<br><br>Morgan: Give. [Morgan grabs the amplification device] HEY, EVERYONE. LISTEN UP.<br><br>[The room slowly falls into silence]<br><br>Morgan: Thank you.

There&#39;s a lot you can&#39;t know. There&#39;s a lot you have to do before you can get to where I am.<br><br>9th Doctor: Does that include getting my dress sense erased?<br><br>11th Doctor: Hey, bow ties are cool - doesn&#39;t matter. The point is, the actual pointiest point of it is, that... well, not everything stays dead. You can&#39;t know how I know that until you&#39;re standing here on my side of the room.<br><br>9th Doctor: Heh.<br><br>Disentangler: Uh, did I miss the funny part?<br><br>9th Doctor [smiling wide, but with the anger of a god behind his eyes]: Not at all. It just... makes sense. I met a Dalek a few days ago, well, a few days ago for me, subjective time and so on. It thought it was the last, they&#39;re never the last, so what we did... what I did... it was all for nothing, wasn&#39;t it? All for absolutely nothing. We lost. The Time Lords lost. And that&#39;s the biggest joke of all, isn&#39;t it? That we all fought and died for absolutely nothing.<br><br>11th Doctor: I&#39;m-<br><br>9th Doctor: Sorry? Is that the word that was going to dance merrily out of your mouth? You&#39;re sorry?<br><br>11th Doctor: No. I&#39;m just going to let you believe all that because you&#39;re not ready to accept how wrong you are about it. Not yet. Not for a while.<br><br>9th Doctor: ... How wrong?<br><br>11th Doctor: I can&#39;t say. You know I can&#39;t. You know the rules.<br><br>9th Doctor: Hmph. Well, when have either of us cared about the rules?<br><br>Notary [shoving a hand in her pocket]: Councillors, let us put it to a vote. All those in favour of, in theory, informing the younger Doctor of his homeworld&#39;s fate?<br><br>[A few hands rise. Morgan gapes at the Notary.]<br><br>Morgan: You&#39;ve snapped. You&#39;ve finally up and snapped-<br><br>Notary: [whispering to Morgan] I have an idea, one I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t think of. [louder] And those opposed?<br><br>[An equal number of hands]<br><br>Notary: Tigereye Castellan, you have the deciding vote.<br><br>Morgan: I... vote in favour.<br><br>Notary: Excellent. The motion is carried. Older Doctor, it is the will of this Council that you explain the events of the Last Day of the Time War to your younger self.<br><br>11th Doctor: But... what about-<br><br>Notary: This Council will hold you in its contempt should you not do so.<br><br>11th Doctor: Oh, will it now?<br><br>Notary: Yes it will. Chop chop, renegade. You&#39;re running late.<br><br>[The 11th Doctor sighs and shakes his head, then begins to tell the 9th Doctor what happened in the serial Day Of The Doctor. The latter is so engrossed in the telling that he doesn&#39;t notice the Notary palming something from the pocket of her robes. Finally, the tale ends.]<br><br>9th Doctor: They survived?<br><br>11th Doctor: Locked away, outside of time. But this is your future, and you shouldn&#39;t know it.<br><br>Notary: And you won&#39;t.<br><br>9th Doctor: What- [He is interrupted by a flash of red light. The Notary tucks her neuralyser away in her pocket and begins to set up some details]<br><br>Morgan: Huh. That was kinda obvious, now that I think about it. Wait, where did you even get that?<br><br>Notary: Stores. I filled out the requisition forms in triplicate some time ago as a matter of course.<br><br>Agent: Is that how you get off or something? I mean, glass of wine, smooth jazz, rose petals leading up the stairs to some 15-Bs that have to be filled in, that&#39;s romantic to you, right?<br><br>Notary: Were it to be so, Amethyst Keeper, I guarantee that you would be the last person I choose for such an endeavour.<br><br>Agent: Oh, thanks.<br><br>Notary: You are quite welcome, Amethyst Keeper.<br><br>9th Doctor: So, fun as all this was, it doesn&#39;t answer the question: how did both of us get here?<br><br>Fearn: THROUGH THE WORKINGS OF SUP-REME CHANCELLOR FEARN, SUP-REME CHANCELLOR OF THE HIGH COUNCIL OF THE DA-LEKS!<br><br>---<br><br>Tune in next week for the shocking continuation of... er... whatever we&#39;re calling this thing that we do.</p>

Back, all of you! Get back!<br><br>(He and Eleven run to the front of the group, sonic screwdrivers pointed at Fearn)<br><br>Fearn: AND WHAT, PRECISELY, DO YOU INTEND TO DO WITH THOSE, DOC-TORS? UNSCREW MY TRAVEL MACHINE CASING?<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: Regrettably, I almost agree with him. This may not have been the best plan.<br><br>Ninth Doctor: Since when was this ever a plan? (beat) And when did they start making blue Daleks?<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: Well, I&#39;ve seen Daleks in blue before, saw a whole rainbow of Daleks once, though none were this one&#39;s frankly delightful and decidedly non-terrifying shade of robins-egg.<br><br>Fearn: I AM EM-PY-RE-AN! IT WAS A THE-SAUR-US MIX-UP!<br><br>Ninth Doctor: You&#39;re a bit mixed-up yourself, I&#39;d say. Look at you, another washed-up dreg of the Dalek race, probably here to wipe out the last few Time Lords in existence-<br><br>Librarian: (whispered to the Notary) He recovered quickly.<br><br>Notary: A neuralyzed mind is a very flexible structure. Besides, I pre-loaded the new memories. I don&#39;t like taking risks.<br><br>Ninth Doctor: (continues, not having heard the previous exchange) -and you can&#39;t even be organized about it! Look at you, just bounding in announcing your so-called victory and babbling about thesauruses, and you&#39;ve not even tried firing a single shot! I&#39;d already thought the Daleks had hit their peak of delusion, but I see you can still top yourselves!<br><br>Fearn: YOU ASSUME TOO MUCH, DOC-TOR. I CAN SEE WHERE YOUR FUTURE SELF OVER THERE GAINED HIS TOWERING ARROGANCE FROM.<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: Oy!<br><br>(Morgan stands up from her seat abruptly)<br><br>Morgan: All three of you, shut it!<br><br>(The Doctors look over at Morgan, while simultaneously keeping Fearn within their sight.)<br><br>Morgan: It&#39;s my responsibility to protect this Council, and that includes keeping these meetings from devolving into a series of unnecessary brawls. I have enough of that to do without unexpected visitors coming in and aggrieving one another. Doctors, Fearn is not a threat.<br><br>Fearn: I RESENT THAT!<br><br>Morgan: (groan) Not a threat to us.<br><br>Fearn: ...BETTER.<br><br>Ninth Doctor: Oh, of course, the Dalek who just barged in here shouting about its race&#39;s inevitable triumph is completely docile. The last time I met a Dalek who was supposedly &quot;harmless&quot;, it ended up, surprise, surprise, killing hundreds of unprepared people! I&#39;m not letting that happen again.<br><br>Librarian: It won&#39;t. Fearn has been instilled with something called the &quot;human factor&quot;. You have seen it before, in your second incarnation, if I recall correctly. It alters the Dalek psyche, disabling some of their pre-conditioned restrictive processes and enabling a wider range of non-aggressive action.<br><br>Disentangler: Translated, he&#39;s friendly. More or less. It&#39;s not as though he doesn&#39;t cause problems, but they aren&#39;t of the &quot;trying to kill you&quot; variety. Trust us.<br><br>(Eleven turns off his sonic screwdriver. Nine scowls, but does the same a few moments later)<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: Fine, then. What would a so-called &quot;friendly Dalek&quot; have to gain by sending two time-displaced versions of the same person, their race&#39;s greatest enemy no less, into unfamiliar territory?<br><br>Fearn: YOUR TOWERING ARR-O-GANCE SHOWS ITSELF ONCE A-GAIN, DOC-TOR.<br><br>Disentangler: Fearn, this would go quicker for all of us if you just stop with the insults and answer the question.<br><br>Fearn: ...FINE. YOU, DOC-TORS, WERE NOT THE FO-CUS OF OUR PLAN! THE AR-RI-VALS OF THE ON-COM-ING STORM AND THE HUN-TER OF SLORP WERE A SIDE EF-FECT!<br><br>Reader: &quot;Our&quot; plan? Who else is involved here?<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: &quot;Hunter of Slorp?&quot;<br><br>Fearn: JUST LIKE A TIME LORD TO FOCUS ON THE DE-TAILS BEFORE THE WHOLE! IF YOU MUST KNOW, I AM CURRENTLY COLLABORATING WITH DA-LEK OMICRON AND DA-LEK CHAR-LIE ON-<br><br>Ninth Doctor: Hold on. There&#39;s a Dalek named Charlie?<br><br>Fearn: YES.

Well, barged in twice, anyway. We can&#39;t exactly get a council going with all of these interruptions.<br><br>Fearn: (faces the Council table) YES, BECAUSE YOU ARE DIS-PAR-ATE AND IN-COM-PAT-I-BLE. WHILE THE TIME LORDS WERE FORCED TO TRAWL THROUGH THEIR IN-SIG-NI-FI-CANT STORE OF A-GENTS TO SELECT COUN-CILL-ORS, THE DA-LEKS, SPEARHEADED BY THE GLO-RI-OUS KNOWLEDGE AND AC-TION OF MY-SELF, FEARN, HAVE BEEN SCOURING THE MY-RI-AD OF WORLDS FOR ALL POSS-I-BLE VAR-I-A-TIONS ON THE DA-LEK FORM! TRULY OUR SU-PER-I-OR-I-TY IS UNMATCHED IN THE COSMOS!<br><br>Agent: Is that what you&#39;ve been trying to tell us this whole time? Because honestly, that didn&#39;t tell anyone of much of anything. Normally, when you give someone new information, it helps if you explain it.<br><br>Fisherman: Wait, I think he&#39;s talking about the temporal fold.<br><br>Fearn: I SEE THAT NOT ALL TIME LORDS ARE IN-CAP-A-BLE OF DE-DUC-TION!<br><br>Fisherman: Did you cause that? How would you even know how to do that?<br><br>Fearn: I AM A STRA-TE-GIST OF THE DA-LEKS, WITH YEARS OF EX-PER-I-ENCE IN THE DE-PART-MENT OF TEM-PO-RAL OFF-EN-SES! THERE-FORE, I AM AN UN-PAR-ALL-ELLED SUPER-GENIUS SLASH CY-BORG SLASH TIME TRAVEL EXPERT. I AM QUITE SURE THAT I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING.<br><br>Morgan: I don&#39;t think the cyborg bit helps much with that.<br><br>Fearn: I BELIEVE IT DOES.<br><br>Ninth Doctor: So, let me get this straight. You&#39;ve been creating temporal folds, which have the well-deserved reputation of being dangerous and quite possibly threatening to local causality, summoning other Daleks to... wherever this is, and generally trying for an amateur-hour run of mucking about with space-time- (turns to the Disentangler) -and this is the nice Dalek?<br><br>Disentangler: I said he was friendly. Not nice.<br><br>Fearn: WHY IS IT THAT ONLY THE DA-LEKS REFUSE TO PUSH AWAY THE RISKS OF INN-O-VA-TION? YOU TIME LORDS WOULD MONITOR YOUR PEOPLE FROM THE DI-LU-TED PER-SPEC-TIVE OF A SINGLE BATCH OF DRIF-TERS, OUT-CASTS AND RE-NE-GADES, SIM-PLY BECAUSE YOU SEE POSSIBLE HARM IN STRETCHING YOUR BOUNDARIES. ON-LY THREE DA-LEKS WERE IN-TER-ES-TED IN COUN-CIL PO-SI-TIONS, SO WE USED OUR TEM-POR-AL FOLD TO BRING IN MORE RE-CRUITS! THERE ARE THOU-SANDS OF WORD WORLDS, MILL-IONS OF POSS-I-BLE UN-I-VER-SES, AND A SIMPLE DIS-TOR-TION OF SPACE AND TIME COULD OVERLAP THE SPA-CI-ALLY AM-BI-GU-OUS HALLS OF HEAD-QUAR-TERS WITH A-NY OF THEM! THE DA-LEK HIGH COUNCIL IS NOW COM-POSED OF THE BEST AND GREA-TEST OF THE DA-LEKS, OF ALL FACTIONS AND SUB-TYPES! I EX-PEC-TED THE DOC-TOR TO IN-VES-TI-GATE THE DIS-RUP-TION OF TEM-POR-AL PRO-GRESSION, OF COURSE, THOUGH I HAD PREDICTED ON-LY ONE INSTANCE. IT IS IN THE DOC-TOR&#39;S NA-TURE TO FLY RIGHT IN-TO AN-Y-THING HE DOES NOT UN-DER-STAND.<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: Got me pegged there, mate.<br><br>Fearn: (angry staccato) WHAT IS IT WITH YOU TIME LORDS AND IN-TERR-UP-TING MY MON-O-LOGUES TO-DAY‽ (Fearn briefly pauses, and performs an feat that would be unthinkable for any non-humanized Dalek: calming down slightly) NOW IF I MAY CON-TIN-UE-<br><br>Notary: Hold it! I was going to say something when you erroneously labelled me a renegade(the Notary rankles at the very thought), but this is just going too far.<br><br>Fearn: YOU WOULD OP-POSE THE OB-VI-OUS TRUTH OF THE DA-<br><br>Notary: I wasn&#39;t finished! You&#39;re claiming to have, between this meeting and the last one, set up something to allow you to overlap this timeline with an inconceivable number of others, just so that you could pull random Daleks into our reality and ask them if they&#39;d like to me members of your imitation council. Never mind the poor planning involved in literally every step of that, no three Agents would have the resources to enact that plan, even if they were, in your words, &quot;supergenius cyborgs&quot;. Besides, the power drain on the DoDAEG generators would cause another blackout before the fold could stay in place for ten seconds. You are just, once again, trying to use the problems that this council has experienced to draw attention to yourself by claiming responsibility for them. In layman&#39;s terms, you&#39;re bluffing.<br><br>Librarian: Notary, I believe that you are disregarding one irrefutable fact. The fold does still exist, even if the Daleks are not causing it. In fact, this Council has directly experienced its effects.<br><br>Fisherman: You took the words right from my mouth, Librarian. Well, not really, since I&#39;d have said them slightly differently. But still, Notary, you should know about the fold better than anyone, since your timeline was overlapped so much that for at least a few minutes you were replaced with a five-hundred-years younger doppelgänger who wanted to take over HQ!<br><br>Notary: It is not my fault if my fellow Councillors mishear me. I stated my precise age, and if you choose to believe otherwise, you may.<br><br>Fisherman: She called herself &quot;Spinel Promontor&quot;! Promontor isn&#39;t even a word in our reality!<br><br>Notary: (ignoring him) I propose that, even if Fearn were, for some inexplicable reason, the cause of the alleged disruption, he would not be able to maintain it long enough to get anything through it, let alone a cross-multiversal squad of Daleks!<br><br>Fearn: I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY THAT. (turns to the door) FELLOW DA-LEK COUN-CILL-ORS! YOU MAY NOW ENTER!<br><br>(A Scientist Dalek rolls into the room, flanked by a Time War Dalek and a Crucible Dalek. The two gold-colored Daleks move to opposite sides of the room, one of the two turning to face the Doctors, and the other to face the Council table)<br><br>Fearn: (spins toward the Scientist Dalek) DA-LEK LAT! REPORT! REPORT!<br><br>Lat: SUPREME CHANCELLOR FEARN! CROSS-TEMPORAL SYNCHRONIZATION HAS SURPASSED SEVENTY PERCENT! THE DALEK HIGH COUNCIL HAS REACHED ITS HIGHEST RATE OF POTENTIAL CANDIDATE TRANSPORT!<br><br>Fearn: EX-CELL-ENT!

ANOMALOUS TRANSPOSITION OF DENIZENS MAY RESULT IF FURTHER SYNCHRONIZATION IS ATTEMPTED WITH THE CURRENT INCREASE IN CROSS-TEMPORAL PACE.<br><br>Fearn: ENOUGH. WE WILL DIS-CUSS THIS LA-TER.<br><br>(Fearn turns toward the Councillors again, regarding them with a swoop of his eyestalk. Somehow, despite the inability of a Dalek travel machine to show visible emotion, Fearn seems to be emitting waves of smug triumph.)<br><br>Fearn: WELL, TIME LORDS? DO YOU DOUBT ME NOW?<br><br>(And the belated Fearn post finally arrives! Three days late! Wooo... I would&#39;ve had it up two days ago, but I needed to rewrite it because the version I had didn&#39;t make any sense.<br>Thanks to Huinesoron for some of these lines, both the ones I lifted directly from his sample and the ones I paraphrased. [Since this is a new thread and you can&#39;t see the initial post unless you click on <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=252674;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">this link</a>, Huinesoron permitted using portions of his sample in whichever script section came next, saying that he&#39;d be &quot;quite happy for this to be inserted in full, ripped to shreds, or totally ignored. Uppa&#39;you&quot;. As you can see, I chose the &quot;ripped to shreds&quot; option. ;)]<br>For further clarification on the &quot;empyrean&quot; thing, Fearn is a lighter color than the standard Strategist Dalek, to differentiate him from the other Strategist Dalek in the PPC, Omicron, who is, as far as we know, more-or-less standard in design. My explanation for this is that the original badfic he came from was full of purple prose and thesaurus abuse, and used what it thought was a synonym for &quot;blue&quot; and turned out instead to notify a specific hue of the color. He&#39;s, as you can see, kind of sensitive about it, as far as that word can be applied to a Dalek.<br>You&#39;re up, Lily! We might need to move the Continuity Council to a different thread, though. This one&#39;s just about to fall off the front page. I can set up a duplicate on the Other Board, maybe, and link to it from here. That would work.)<br>[I already did, Future Me! For once, we followed through on one of our ideas!]</p>

To my knowledge no-one&#39;s ever closed a temporal fold before it blew, so we have to move fast. Sapphire Watcher, Amethyst Keeper, I&#39;d really rather be wrong about that, so I need you to scour the canon and find anything that even <i>might</i> be helpful. Jade Warden, you&#39;re on monitor duty: work with Lat and Rho to keep track of everything that&#39;s-<br><br>Reader: Hang on a minute-<br><br>Notary: -why are <i>you</i> in charge?<br><br>[They glare at each other for a second, angry at having agreed on something]<br><br>Morgan: [Icy] What is my job?<br><br>Reader: Tigereye Castellan. What-?<br><br>Morgan: And what does that entail?<br><br>Notary: Defending the Council.<br><br>Morgan: Then let me bloody well defend it!<br><br>[Deafening silence. Everyone stares at Morgan]<br><br>Morgan: Jade Warden, if anything <i>really</i> bad shows up, tell the Doctors. I&#39;m deputising them to Dalek elimination duty.<br><br>11th Doctor: Wait, what? Why?<br><br>Morgan: Because you&#39;re so good at it. Spinel Promotor... you&#39;re on Dalek distraction duty. Stop Fearn&#39;s &#39;Council&#39; from causing any more havoc.<br><br>Notary: And how do you intend me to do that?<br><br>Morgan: I don&#39;t know, file their taxes or something. Just <i>do it</i>!<br><br>[Everyone scurries to work. Nine comes over to Morgan]<br><br>9th Doctor: You&#39;ve changed. You&#39;re not the kid I once knew.<br><br>Morgan: Yeah. Things have been... difficult, these last few years.<br><br>9th Doctor: The Time War?<br><br>Morgan: Mm. [The Librarian taps her on the arm and shows her a tablet. She grimaces] We&#39;ve got a Special Weapons Dalek in the Mongoose Shelter. Doctors, can you contain it?<br><br>11th Doctor: Just tell us where to go.<br><br>Fisherman: I&#39;ll show you. [He shrugs] Not like I&#39;m doing anything else around here...<br><br>[Some time passes. Morgan is standing at the head of the table, which is now covered in books, CDs, DVDs, portable computers, the works]<br><br>Morgan: Yellow, what&#39;ve we got?<br><br>Reader: It&#39;s not just a single fold any more. According to Fearn, there&#39;s at least eight layers to the thing. It&#39;s going to be murder to sort out.<br><br>Morgan: Thanks. Blue, pink, I hope you&#39;ve come up with something.<br><br>Agent: It&#39;s <i>purple</i>!<br><br>Disentangler: It&#39;s pink, I&#39;m afraid. Uh, no actual temporal folds, but plenty of loops, pockets and the like. We&#39;re thinking the best comparison to this event is a slow-motion time ram - two TARDISes crashing into each other.<br><br>Reader: In that case, the simplest way of solving it would be to just pull the folds apart again.<br><br>11th Doctor: That doesn&#39;t sound simple to <i>me</i>.<br><br>Librarian: It sounds like a recipe for a massive temporal implosion.<br><br>Agent: That&#39;s what we&#39;re facing anyway! But if the Reader&#39;s right-<br><br>Reader: It&#39;s my job to be right. If we anchor a TARDIS to each of the folds, we can yank them apart - set everything back to normal.<br><br>Librarian: We will have to move fast. The last refolding brought full-on Alternate Universes into play - we have Thaleks coming in now.<br><br>Morgan: Red? Is it possible?<br><br>Fisherman: Depends how much you like your TARDIS. It&#39;ll knock years of the warranty, I can tell you that much - but they should be able to pull through.<br><br>Librarian: The alternative is the TARDISes being the only things left after Headquarters is destroyed in a cataclysmic explosion.<br><br>Morgan: Green&#39;s right. We- [She pauses, sighs, and turns to the Notary. Very formally:] Spinel Promotor, do you have anything to say about this course of action?<br><br>Notary: Only that it is the riskiest, most reckless, most improbably, and generally downright unworkable plan I have ever heard.<br><br>[Silence, for just long enough that Morgan starts to turn away.<br><br>Notary: <i>But</i>.<br><br>[Morgan turns back and gapes at her as the Notary gives a small smile]<br><br>Notary: It is also our only chance - and it is a work of genius.<br><br>Morgan: ... thank you, Grey. And all of you - thank you. TARDIS keys, everyone!<br><br>[She fishes in a pocket to produce an ornate key, while the Doctors pull out their simple Yale keys. The Notary hesitantly follows suit, followed by the Reader and the Fisherman. The Agent and the Disentangler glance at each other, and the Agent feels in his pocket and produces a key]<br><br>Morgan: Librarian?<br><br>Librarian: I told you. I walked here from my group&#39;s TARDIS - I do not have one with me.<br><br>[Morgan crumples]<br><br>Morgan: Then this has all been a waste of time. We don&#39;t have time to find another ship - and without it, we won&#39;t have enough to fix the fold before it collapses. Omega&#39;s teeth, we were so close!<br><br>[Fearn swivels his dome to look at Lat and Rho, then turns back to Morgan]<br><br>Fearn: WE HAVE A TIME SHIP.<br><br>[Morgan turns slowly to stare at him]<br><br>Fearn: WHAT? DID YOU EXPECT OTHERWISE? DA-LEKS ARE SUPREME! THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF TIME ARE UNDER OUR CONTROL!<br><br>[Slowly, a smile breaks out on Morgan&#39;s face]<br><br>Morgan: Fearn - I might just start to like you. All right, Councils - let&#39;s fly!<br><br>~<br><br>That was fun. :D I&#39;m not actually sure if the Reader has a TARDIS, but it&#39;s only a minor change if not (eight becomes seven, &#39;Librarian&#39; becomes &#39;Librarian? Reader?&#39;, and the Reader gives an explanation. Simples!). And I enjoyed letting everyone actually do their job.<br><br>If someone wants to finish this, this is a good place - either an action sequence or an after-action meeting would work. Alternately, if you think there&#39;s still milage in it, another open-ended section would be fine too.<br><br>hS</p>

Including you. [She gestures at the Daleks with her Concussor, and they fall silent] Red, can you fix this TARDIS?<br><br>Fisherman: This <i>alleged</i> TARDIS might hold together long enough, but I can&#39;t say for sure. Hush now, sweetie, it&#39;s gonna be okay.<br><br>Notary: What is it with renegades and treating TARDISes like people? It&#39;s not a Type-103, it&#39;s not sentient.<br><br>11th Doctor: Oh, all TARDISes are a bit alive, right from the word go. It&#39;s how they&#39;re made. Even the Type I&#39;s were, though they were mostly grumpy old codgers shaking a walking stick at you from their living room.<br><br>Disentangler: Now who does that remind me of?<br><br>Notary: [with an air of defeat] Look, it was all I could get, alright? The Dromeian Chapter is not noted for its lavish funding.<br><br>Fisherman: Hold up.

Everyone, report to your TARDISes. I&#39;ll set up a conference call from mine.<br><br>[Exeunt omnes, save the Notary and The Fisherman.

Anchor yourself to a particular timeline and pull like crazy!<br><br>Notary: That&#39;s it?<br><br>Morgan: What, you want to make us fill out a Health and Safety form first?<br><br>Notary: Well, I do have some on hand, but I was merely surprised. This scrapyard refugee&#39;s flaws will actually be useful.<br><br>Morgan: What d&#39;you mean?<br><br>Notary: The brakes don&#39;t work, the accelerator locks on half the time, and it only stays in one direction if I hit the central control nodule with a brick.<br><br>Fisherman: It&#39;s like watching someone beat up a kitten.<br><br>Morgan: Your hearing back, Red?<br><br>Fisherman: Nah, I put subtitles on.<br><br>Morgan: Let&#39;s get pulling!

            <p>I have to admit, I&#39;m rather baffled as to what Fearn&#39;s plan is. So far, it seems to be &#39;The Time Lords have made a council in HQ. I&#39;ll make one too! Wait, there&#39;s no-one to join... I&#39;ll bring someone in!&#39; He (why do I keep thinking Fearn is female?) doesn&#39;t seem to have a goal in mind.<br><br>Questions arising from this:<br><br>-What is Fearn&#39;s goal (if any)?<br>-Did Fearn give Lat and company the Human Factor? If not, I foresee a rebellion against his presumed authority, and ultimately Fearn + the Continuity Council vs. the Dalek invasion of HQ.<br>-Why isn&#39;t Tigereye Castellan Morgan doing anything? The unexpected introduction of more Daleks into HQ would seem to warrant her intervention (probably to drop the lot of them into a temporal pocket until she can get the DIA on Fearn&#39;s case - she&#39;s not a vigilante, at least not in HQ). My guess is she&#39;s just as baffled as I am about where this is going.<br><br>(Of course, if Lily&#39;s section doesn&#39;t answer these questions, I may end up writing the response myself.

            <p>1) I left Fearn&#39;s goal partially ambiguous for a reason. On one hand, he does like one-upping people to prove how much better the Daleks, and by extension he, can do than they can, so that&#39;s something of a goal in itself, but on another hand, I&#39;m not wanting to constrict the progress of the story by saying &quot;Yes, (plan) is what is happening now, and it would be out of character for the Time Lords not to deal with this problem in a very specific manner&quot;. This is a collaborative effort, and I don&#39;t want to seem like I&#39;m trying to force the story in my direction.<br><br>2) He and the others have given the new Daleks the Human Factor, yes. If they hadn&#39;t, the Daleks that the High Council brought in would have killed the founding members within seconds for having an impure Dalek genetic code.<br><br>3) It is partially bafflement, and partially because she hadn&#39;t really been taking Fearn all that seriously. Remember, the last time Fearn came in, he shouted for a few minutes and then she dispatched him with a single shot from a concussive weapon. She probably would&#39;ve thought that she could do the same any time she wanted if he got too problematic and the Doctors got tired of making fun of him, but then three more Daleks showed up only seconds before the section ended. For all I know, the next section will have her deciding that enough is enough and dropping the new arrivals in some sort of time-suspension field until she can deal with the temporal fold. It would be a bit anticlimactic, but I ended my section in a spot that I felt would leave the most options open, so it&#39;s a possibility.</p>

            <p>/Fearn and Lat materialize in the middle of the Continuity Council&#39;s meeting room.

And she&#39;s got some ideas that, well, aren&#39;t quite what we, the renegades of Gallifrey, have been holding as right. /pause/ She&#39;s been causing the quakes. She wants to destroy HQ--destroy the multiverse--get rid of all the enemies, and of all physical form...<br><br>Notary: /sharply/ You mean to say she plans ascension?<br><br>Reader: Got it in one. /to Morgan/ Thanks for shooting the Doctor; he&#39;s one less person for me to deal with.

            <p>There are a lot of moments and pieces I really liked. The Council&#39;s reaction shot in the first piece, the whole of the &#39;Howling&#39; scene, Morgan&#39;s quiet &#39;Fearn can&#39; in &#39;can&#39;t be trusted&#39;, and the whole of the &#39;Master&#39; scene (though I do wonder: does he look like the Twelfth Doctor, or the Doctor&#39;s twelfth incarnation, ie the Eleventh?)<br><br>The main things I have trouble with are - sorry - the last two, biggest scenes. I&#39;m... very dubious about the Reader&#39;s motivations (&quot;I never wanted to be on this Council! I have to do it because I&#39;m the Onyx Monitor!&quot;), and about the total lack of reaction to Morgan shooting a canon character. I did, I admit, like the Reader&#39;s explanation for why she&#39;s not going to monologue, but the scene as a whole doesn&#39;t really work for me.<br><br>As for the last one... eh. I do like the sense of complete mayhem - the idea that there&#39;s about half a dozen plot threads that we, jumping in mid-loop, have <i>no</i> idea about. But the Doctor is way too stable for being, judging by his first line, immediately post-regeneration. At this point in time, his canonical line is &quot;Do you know how to fly this thing?&quot; - here he seems entirely too calm and composed.<br><br>And, um, the Reader got stabbed with a sword. It seems like that would have warranted a bit more attention.<br><br>This isn&#39;t to say there weren&#39;t <i>lines</i> I liked - most of them, in fact, were good and/or funny. But for those two scenes in particular, the plot didn&#39;t work for me.<br><br>(Terrible idea for the next Continuity Council story, if we decide to do this again ever Guardians preserve us: a closed timeline where the Councillors end up going through multiple regenerations each in order to prevent their timeline coming into existence. I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d make an environment <i>that</i> hostile - though <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JYZ7eqTClNA4Y7rMd_q1Gw7FfkVLrQXQqO07wUqiTtE/edit#bookmark=id.7catfxe9ablp">the Alchemist</a> once managed to get killed twice in 48 hours - but it seems like a story where the time limit is &#39;we have to finish before we run out of deaths&#39; would be quite interesting)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>To be honest, the scene with the Reader&#39;s motivations...well, originally she was going to be the villain. And then I sort of switched ideas. I guess I didn&#39;t edit the set-up well enough (or at all, quite probably). And you definitely have a point with the lack of reaction to the Doctor being shot...maybe I&#39;ll try expanding that scene again, in a different way. This way was pretty much &#39;ooh, the Reader could be the villain--nah. Hey, let&#39;s try this plotline!&#39; While there are pieces of it that I like, I think you&#39;re right about the flaws in its execution.<br><br>For the last scene...fair point with the Doctor. I think I was trying to jump ahead and speculate as to what his personality would be like, but ended up making him a bit too stable? Not sure. I am curious to see whether he&#39;ll act and speak anything like this in the actual show, though. Should be fun. As for the Reader getting stabbed--for some reason, she was, what&#39;s the phrase, transparent? Incorporeal? Well, anyway, she was basically ghost!Reader in my head, but I think I forgot to explain that in the text--if you look earlier, she also runs through the wall...maybe I&#39;ll make an edited version of this scene, too.<br><br>And, for the Master scene--he&#39;s meant to look like the Twelfth Doctor, although it would admittedly be hilarious if he resembled Eleven. The problem with the War Doctor is that he complicates descriptions...<br><br>(I&#39;m not entirely sure I follow all of that--they regenerate in a closed timeline so that their timeline won&#39;t exist? It does sound interesting, though. As to how to make it hostile...amp up the tension. The Notary&#39;s been at them all to do their paperwork, everyone&#39;s been having a bad day, the Daleks won&#39;t leave them alone, a Weeping Angel snuck aboard the Disentangler&#39;s TARDIS and now they don&#39;t know where it is, a Sue-created Weeping Angel!mouse made its way into the Auditorium via the Fisherman&#39;s TARDIS, the Flowers have been complaining about the Time Lords taking so much time from their missions and now someone&#39;s suggested having a Council meeting while on a mission...there&#39;s no end to the possibilities.)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I&#39;m thinking that the Council get themselves, and probably all of HQ (or possibly reality) into a situation which is incompatible with continued existence. As one possible example: they accidentally let Rassilon and the High Council out, and they begin their ascension program - from inside HQ; all across the multiverse, people start randomly vanishing, or exploding, or whatever.<br><br>So the Council have to find a way to put it right - to travel back and undo the ongoing catastrophe. If they succeed, none of it will ever have happened - I suspect any of them who survive until the reset will remember it, but no-one else will, since they weren&#39;t involved in resetting.<br><br>But the catastrophe is making the environment ludicrously hostile. It seems like every time they enter a room, something horrible happens to one or the other of them, causing a regeneration. So - either with day-long gaps in between, or with a technobabble evil way of getting rid of the &#39;invincible within 12 hours of regenerating&#39; ability - the Council end up burning through their remaining lives at a rate of knots. Their only goal at this point is to reach the reset button, whatever it is - and regardless of the cost to them (since the catastrophe will, ultimately, never have happened).<br><br>But... I don&#39;t have any idea what the catastrophe could be, other than the half-formed Rassilon notion which I don&#39;t think holds up. It needs to be something which makes HQ - or wherever they are - a total deathtrap.<br><br>Hmm... maybe a coalition of fictional evil characters with trap-filled mazes is accidentally created by the work of the Council - and given knowledge of HQ -, and their objective is to go back (and cross their own timelines) and prevent that information?<br><br>I&#39;unno. It&#39;s all hard thinking work.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The suggested title is <b><i>Siege Mentality</i></b>, and like <i>Gallifrey Bickers</i>, the story takes place entirely in the Council chamber.

For some reason (to be explained during the story, of course), all these monsters, after wreaking mayhem on their immediate surroundings, head directly for the Council.<br><br>Now the Continuity Council are burning through their remaining lives, desperately trying to survive the onslaught long enough to untangle the cause of the event - and repair it before it ever happens.

            <p>Okay, that&#39;s it, I&#39;m going to revive that idea I had a short while back of the Reader meeting some of her past regenerations and write it as a bonus scene/mini interlude kind of thing. (I originally tabled it because it wouldn&#39;t fit into the main Gallifrey Bickers storyline, and nothing particularly viable sprang to mind when I considered writing it as part of a PPC mission or interlude- it&#39;s really just an excuse for character development and probable drama.

            <p>Huh... I figured she&#39;d been so careful with her life that she was still on the first.<br><br>Also: that was hilarious, and persuaded me to write my own story, which takes place <i>after</i> the events of <i>Gallifrey Bickers</i> (although, honestly, it has no temporal anchor - it could as easily be the end of a mission).<br><br><hr>

You there?&quot;<br><br>Silence.

You were... fun. I mean, you were a bit of a ditz, and I don&#39;t know <i>why</i> you needed that much cleavage, but you had a good time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Command not recognised.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And then you turned into maudlin old me, the grumpy drunk with the gun.&quot; Morgan shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t know how you bear it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Command no-o-o-o-t recognised.&quot;<br><br>Morgan blinked as the hologram wavered and reformed, this time as a skinny brunette woman in a scruffy jacket and trousers.<br><br>&quot;Amelia,&quot; she breathed.<br><br>&quot;Incorrect. This is a voice inter-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, <i>yes</i>, I know.&quot; Morgan scowled at the image. &quot;That&#39;s not like you at all, Amelia Earhart. You were never one to say &#39;no&#39;, were you? Seems like half our adventures were your fault.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Command not recognised.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And we <i>loved</i> it, didn&#39;t we?

Still exploring strange new civilisations or however it goes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Commmmmmmmmmmmmmmmand not recognised.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not like you,&quot; Morgan continued to the clean-cut man in the suit. &quot;Oh, I suppose you enjoyed it as well as we did, but you were always missing Earth, weren&#39;t you, Fred?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Command not recognised.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I guess that&#39;s why you had me take you back.&quot; Reaching into a pocket, Morgan pulled out a gold coin and rubbed her finger over the face on one side. &quot;I wonder if you ever found her again, your Mary? If so, you might be the luckiest of us all - out there, living a normal life, while I&#39;m stuck in this madhouse.&quot;<br><br>Command not not not not not recognised.&quot;<br><br>Morgan choked back a sob. &quot;Traf...&quot; she whispered, holding out a hand towards the short woman, her black hair tumbling over her shoulders. &quot;I never got to...&quot; She shook her head sharply. &quot;I failed you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Command not recognised.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I <i>meant</i> to show them to you,&quot; Morgan went on. &quot;As soon as we got a break, I was going to take you out there.

Only for a little while - but longer than I ever will. I don&#39;t know. A Time Lord touches the world only lightly - it&#39;s our blessing and our curse. What would it be like to live a human life?&quot;<br><br>Silence. Morgan looked up to find yet another face staring at her: one better suited to a wide grin than to the sombre expression it held.<br><br>&quot;And it&#39;s all your fault,&quot; she said to the image of her first self. &quot;All the pain, all the loss, all the failures - they&#39;re all because of you. You could have stayed on Gallifrey - you could have been on the High Council! - but you had to leave. You had to start running.&quot;<br><br>Silence.<br><br>&quot;And would you do it again?&quot; Morgan demanded. &quot;Knowing what you know now, would you still leave - still abandon everything for a life filled with ever more abandonments?&quot;<br><br>Silence.<br><br>&quot;I suppose you would, wouldn&#39;t you? Because without pain, there can be no joy. Without loss, you never understand what you had. Without death-&quot;<br><br>Silence. Morgan took a deep breath, then closed her eyes and turned away.<br><br>&quot;Thank you. Deactivate voice interface.&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>But in answer to your earlier question, yes, five times now. When the Time War erupted, she nicked a blockade runner and, well, ran away. As far and as fast as she could. She was 590 and on her first regeneration when she started running, and the Notary currently on the Council is number 5. This should tell you a lot about how good she is at avoiding trouble and avoiding getting shot or blown up by bits of her own TARDIS.<br><br>The 4th Notary was the fun one, and she only regenerated a couple of years before her arrival at the PPC. Y&#39;all missed out by inches. Meh, maybe number 6&#39;ll be a bit better, despite my little headcanon that the 6th regeneration is the one that always goes a little bit wrong. =]</p>

            <p>From what I remember from what you and DawnFire told me about the planned Gravedigger mythos, having a Boarder-analogue that is also a Time Lord named the Gravedigger would have been a little too... on-the-nose. It might have thrown off one or more of the others, or at least the audience&#39;s perception of one or more of the others.<br><br>Also, the Boarder Time Lords were outside of continuity, or at least in an alternate universe, except for the First Librarian(or possibly Librarian-1; it was never made clear before Aelin left the PPC to create her own short-lived knockoff whether or not the two Librarians were the same person or not, so it&#39;s up to Desdendelle to decide that now), who started out of continuity but was pulled into the main PPC universe through a plothole after Anebrin quit the PPC to serve as a secondary replacement partner for Desdendelle&#39;s self-named Agent. Having another Gravedigger in the Boarder-Inspired Time Lords Universe would probably end up creating a Gravedigger-4, unless a truly mobius double-reacharound level of time-space shenanigans and/or cosmic retcons would take place, and three of them were hard enough to keep track of as it stood.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JYZ7eqTClNA4Y7rMd_q1Gw7FfkVLrQXQqO07wUqiTtE/edit?pli=1">the official list of all of the Time Lords who had details before the thread dropped off of the front page and people decided that was probably enough</a>, there were already three &quot;bookworm&quot;-characterized Time Lords, so adding in The Scholar might be stretching it. The Blogger would be funny, though, in an entirely-out-of-character kind of way. Also, that sort of activity is enormously out of place on Gallifrey, so I can clearly see why she would have gone renegade; she got too attached to social media, and didn&#39;t want the stodgy Time Lord councils taking it away. &quot;Ooh, look, the Cybermen are attacking again! Wait until Tumblr hears about this!&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t come up with a snappy comeback for what you just said at this moment, Mechanic, but once I do, I&#39;m totally posting it on Twitter!

            <p>There&#39;s a scene interspersed into the final story, &#39;The Crowded TARDIS&#39; (which, mortified, I just noticed wasn&#39;t linked in - it is now) which highlights the differences between them. Splicing it together, it looks like this:<br><br><i>Meanwhile, the First Librarian was tapping away at his tablet computer. He beckoned his possible later form over and pointed at something.<br><br>Now the Second Librarian, nodding in agreement with her counterpart, beckoned the Archivist over. Together they peered at the screen, and then the Archivist scurried off into the depths of the TARDIS.<br><br>The Archivist returned, carrying a thick book, and passed it to the Second Librarian. The latter flicked through the pages, hunting.<br><br>The Second Librarian, having found her page, hurried over to the Analyzer and pointed at something. The latter woman frowned, then raised her eyebrow. The Librarian whispered something in her ear.<br><br>The Analyzer, still frowning at the book, crossed the room to the Speaker. She ran her finger down the page, demonstrating something to him, then entered into a whispered conversation.<br><br>The Speaker had tapped [the Strategist&#39;s] shoulder, and the Strategist leant down to listen. After a few moments he stood again, and shrugged.<br><br>&quot;Apparently,&quot; he said, &quot;a study by the United Universities of Raxacoricofallapatorius has conclusively demonstrated that, when it comes to starship crews, a larger, more varied team is always preferable. I&#39;m quite surprised, I will admit, but the Analyzer says the proof is undeniable.&quot;</i><br><br>It would be quite tricky to fit the Scholar in there, it&#39;s true.

            <p>Well, except for hS, although he&#39;s technically building on a misconception...<br><br>Outhra: Wrong one, I&#39;m afraid. I mentioned the Sixth Reader here because he&#39;s both the youngest-looking one to date (it&#39;s really ridiculous, he looks about twelve years old and would do well in an anime with--oh, heavens, I think I modeled him accidentally after a Hetalia character. Whoops!) He&#39;s also the most...we&#39;ll go with unstable, although it&#39;s a bit more like vengeful, at least at first--he will eventually get over it (probably), and he does have good reason to be that way. However, no, he&#39;s not the Gravedigger!Reader. You&#39;re right in that the Gravedigger!Reader is female, but I&#39;m not actually sure which regeneration she is--quite probably the ninth, to be honest, as I have concepts for the seventh and eighth that don&#39;t match up with the Gravedigger. (On the other hand, who knows? Nothing&#39;s set in stone...)<br><br>As to which regeneration the Reader is currently on--this is the fourth. The fifth--bother, hold on. ATTENTION, LILY! Right, then. The <i>fifth</i> is the one who looks and acts ridiculously like AOS Jim Kirk. The First Reader died on Gallifrey, the Second Reader died <i>leaving</i> Gallifrey, and the Third Reader died on a PPC mission. (For reference: As currently known/planned out, Readers I and II are male, Readers III and IV are female, Readers V and VI are male again, Reader VII is probably female and possibly non-Gallifreyan-looking, and Reader VIII is possibly--probably?--non-Gallifreyan-looking. Yes, I did the initial pattern more or less on purpose, and yes, that&#39;s all the information I currently have on Readers VII and VIII :) ).<br><br>Aaaand...I think that&#39;s it! Thanks for having this discussion in my absence, it was very fun to read :D (especially considering I wasn&#39;t expecting it).<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Due to today&#39;s influx of new threads, the Continuity Council thread has been pushed off of the Board main page. In most cases, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem, but the script-story that several Boarders had been working on went away with it, and at least one person who had plans for adding to it never got to. So, I&#39;m duplicating the script parts of the thread and moving it <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=3143;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">to a thread on the Other Board</a>, in case people want to continue contributing to the story but might take a while to do so or don&#39;t want to have to go to the next page to check on it.<br><br>I copied the posts containing scripts(and the two immediately-preceding posts that led to the scripts) in their entirety, with the original subjects, author names, and text. The only one that was modified in any way was the last one, the new Fearn-related section that I&#39;d intended to post two days ago but actually only got around to doing earlier today, and I still left its script text unchanged.<br><br>Have fun, everyone!<br><br><br>Oh, and while we&#39;re on the subject of the Other Board, on its main page, the links to the PPC Constitution and the &quot;main PPC content page&quot;(I&#39;m not sure what that means, but it may have been another Board or an early version of the wiki) are currently both dead. They appear to have both linked to a site called Oddlots originally, but now only redirect to one of those &quot;this site was not found, so maybe you mean one of these&quot; browser web searches.<br><br>Could someone with sufficient knowledge change where those links go? I know that there&#39;s at least one person active who can change the Other Board, because there&#39;s a reminder to read the Constitution at the top of every page that wasn&#39;t there a few months ago, but I&#39;m not sure who it is, so I can&#39;t ask them directly. It might have been Huinesoron, since he was the one who changed the main Board&#39;s header a while back, but again, I&#39;m not sure.</p>

            <p>And since the story wasn&#39;t finished, I wanted people to be able to contribute to it in its original format regardless, as several distinct script sections each followed up on by different people. The GDoc is very good for looking at it as a whole, though, since a reader can just scroll down all the way through the script without needing to click on several different posts. I just don&#39;t think it would be the best format to work in while people are still creating the story.</p>

            <p>...as I&#39;m fairly sure I hadn&#39;t even heard of the PPC yet. Actually, I don&#39;t think I even knew what fanfiction was yet, so...basically, it definitely wasn&#39;t in 2004. Odds are I caught it closer to 2006 (anywhere between there and 2009, really)...oddly enough, it may have contributed to my assumption that the PPC was no longer very active? I mean, up until last January, I had no idea there were more than a handful of active PPCers left. So...you never know.<br><br>A six-month downswing? Wow. Any theories on what caused that? (Or is it normal, somehow...?)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Posts02-13.png"><br><br>This is a plot of every single post still available in PPC Board history (I know, I know), up to December. The white line is monthly counts; the mysteriously straight rows of black points are where I&#39;ve had to use averages to fill in the gaps.<br><br>You can see that we do get periodic &#39;slumps&#39; - the winters of &#39;09, &#39;10, and &#39;11 all show a dropoff in posts, as in fact does &#39;13. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s mostly &#39;summer holiday/back to school/Christmas&#39;, or simply people not having much free time.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Users02-13.png"><br><br>This graph is rather more fun: I looked at when a person&#39;s name first and last appears on the Board, and used that to plot the number of Boarders at any one time. Obviously it falls down when someone like Saphie comes back for one post, or when we get a second user named Artemis, but in general, it works.<br><br>The blue line is the raw data; the red is tweaked to remove users who post only in one month. A lot of those are typos, but it does eliminate the massive one-point spikes in &#39;08 and &#39;11 - I&#39;m pretty sure those are the Badfic Games.<br><br>You can ignore the massive dropoff in the last four points - that&#39;s bias from people who posted, say, through to November, then just didn&#39;t say anything in December. The sloping down prior to it, since mid-&#39;11, is real, though.<br><br>And you can see the downswing I&#39;m talking about. In late &#39;09, around 20 people simply... left. And I think that may well have been due to the front page vanishing. Those are the people who had the FP bookmarked, and never made the transition to the direct link. The pickup at the end, I suspect, is from us appearing on TVTropes.<br><br>You can see a similar fall in early &#39;08, but I think that&#39;s a data artefact - due to the low number of surviving posts from that time, the data doesn&#39;t show the new people until later, and shows people leaving earlier than they actually did.<br><br>So yeah... far and away the most active time for the PPC was back in &#39;04-&#39;05. Since then, we&#39;ve mostly been staying level. And now? Ehm... not sure. The second graph says we&#39;ve got decreasing numbers of posters; the first says we have an increasing post count. And if you look at the right hand side, the grey scribble at the bottom is the number of IP addresses looking at the Board each day: that&#39;s on the increase, too (and has virtually doubled since March &#39;13).<br><br>So there we go. Data, data, everywhere, and not a drop to drink.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m about to just type all my thoughts for this character up into one thing, because I want opinions on her and I wanna know if she would be good as an agent, or if I should continue working on her.<br><br>Akishme the Argonian <br><br>Akishme is an upbeat Argonian female, who prefers cracking jokes to cracking heads during a mission, though she wouldn&#39;t say no to doing both. She comes from Cyrodill, -a shack on the Imperial Waterfront, to be exact- and can be fiercely protective of her home continuum, preferring not to tackle missions concerning the Elder Scrolls world. <br><br>Akishme is very optimistic, and will do anything to have a good time. Back in her home continuum, she was a thief, working with the Thieves&#39; Guild, so rules and laws aren&#39;t exactly a concern of hers. She sees getting around them as half the fun to something, anyway. This Argonian is very carefree, and easy to make happy, but also easy to anger if you press all the wrong buttons. When angry, she is sure to let everybody know! She can and will get pretty loud, telling everybody what had made her unhappy and why she is unhappy with it, even if they didn&#39;t exactly want to know in the first place. Her usual mood, however, is an over-confident one. She tends to believe nothing can really kill her, backing up her claim with the blade of a Daedric sword and a handful of magic spells. That isn&#39;t to say that she&#39;s good with magic, though, because really, letting her handle it is a Very Bad Idea.<br><br>As a member of the Argonian race, Askishme is able to breath underwater, and is a gifted swimmer. Being immune to poison and very resistant to disease comes with that as well and, boy, does she need that. She seems to find trouble at every turn, most just due to her mischievous attitude and actions. She is a talented thief and fighter, preferring a sword to anything else, though she can also use magic. Just, not as well. <br><br>Some of her hobbies include collecting (&quot;Making a mess of our RC!&quot;, as Penchant calls it.) various objects, in a borderline-hoarder kind of way, cooking, painting, and getting up to trouble. She enjoys being social and, as a result, has a lot of friends. She also acts on impulse and in the moment, which has given her many enemies as well. She doesn&#39;t really let that stop her, though.</p>

            <p>I would like to comment on the sword though. You said she had a Deadric blade. If my memory serves me correctly, the Deadric blades were rather rare for various reasons. While it would not be impossible for an Argonian from (let&#39;s face it) the slums to have one, it would be very unlikely. <br><br>Though that distinction does depend on when she&#39;s from. I&#39;d imagine that after the war, the blades would be a bit more common, and the Imperial army would be less capable of confiscating such a dangerous weapon.</p>

            <p>Though you are probably right on the sword being uncommon for an Argonian thief to have in her possession. She was originally based on my character from Oblivion, and that happened to be my weapon. I may change it to a glass sword if I cannot think of a good enough reason for her to have it.</p>

            <p>If the character doesn&#39;t need some ability or weapon, if it doesn&#39;t make them more interesting, give them more strategies to use, etc., then you can drop that ability or weapon, because it is unnecessary detail that doesn&#39;t add to the story.<br><br>It&#39;s better to have a character with a few interesting abilities than one with a lot of abilities, many of which seem to be only for &quot;decoration&quot;.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t worry about a Daedric weapon as far as power or rarity is concerned; the more useful question is whether it gives you more opportunities to do interesting things with the character that you couldn&#39;t do otherwise.</p>

            <p>Here are the agents that everyone here helped me get off the ground :D I hope a lot of people like them<br><br>To be quick with it, they basically discovered the PPC by via plothole created by a Mary sue (this process also killed their mother, will be explained in full later) <br><br>Dean Atwood, a quick description: Dean is a decent shot despite being far sited and knows what to do when someone needs medical attention, so between his two partners he mostly sticks to long raged attacks and medical care.  <br>Though Dean is a nice guy he prefers to be alone as such he would never be the one to start a conversation and prefers to listen more then talk when in a conversation.  Because of a certain incident involving an evil, super powered, Mary sue and their mother, both gained a very strong hate for Mary sues, though it was Dean who joined DMS.<br><br>Linda Atwood, a quick description: Linda is excellent in hand to hand combat but is terrible in long range and is so far only decent with the battlespork she was given.  Unlike her brother, Linda is incredibly sociable and is always ready to talk, unfortunately she tends to talk over others and most of the time its unintentional.  Though both of them hate Mary sues with a passion she became a DF because she is actually kind of squeamish, not terribly enough that she wont kill a Mary sue if her brother can&#39;t but she would rather not.<br><br>if you want a visual on them click here: <a href="http://123bugsy-universe.tumblr.com/"><a href="http://123bugsy-universe.tumblr.com/">http://123bugsy-universe.tumblr.com/</a></a><br><br>as usual tell me if anything is wrong and what I should fix, please and thank you :)   </p>

            <p>So I re-did the agent info I hope this is much better. :) <br><br>Agent Linda<br><br>Home continuum: Pokémon (anime)<br><br>Age: 21<br><br>Department: DMS<br><br>Leagues: Sinnoh (top 64 in the Lily of the Valley Conference), Johto (top 60 in the Silver Conference), Unova (top 48 in the Vertress Conference), and was unable to compete in the Kalos Conference (joining the PPC being the reason) but did get all eight badges <br>(Note: did not compete alongside Ash Ketchum, competed long after him)<br><br>Personality:  Linda is an energetic, social, and bold young lady with a love of adventure and discovery.  Sometimes when she gets extremely focused on something, she forgets everything else around her.  This does not get too bad as long as there is someone to help her keep track (usually Dean).  Linda thinks the PPC is the best place to be; a new and exciting adventure every second, new and interesting people to see and meet (even if they are Mary sues, for they are always interesting), and every time she gets back to their RC she knows she helped the word world for the better.   She also loves to draw, so it’s not oncoming to see her doodling in her sketch book form time to time.<br><br>Backstory:  Linda and Dean were just your average Pokémon trainers, until they got sucked into a plothole.  Lucky for them they were sucked straight into the PPC.  After some explaining, Linda was instantly hooked on the idea of joining the PPC and became an agent alongside her bother.  While there she and Dean became friends with another new agent named Tabitha (a magical girl) and since then they have occasionally joined each other on missions (when it is appropriate).<br><br>Skills: If there’s one thing Linda’s an expert on, its parings (or ships/shipping) she even has an art book dedicated to keeping track of canon parings, OTPS, popular fan parings, and popular crack parings.  She prefers hand-to-hand combat over long-ranged (mostly due to being a very bad shot) but after receiving a battlespork of zillywut, she has been learning how to wield it properly. Both Linda and Dean own a mega ring. <br><br><br>Agent Dean<br><br>Home continuum: Pokémon (anime)<br><br>Age: 21<br><br>Department: DMS<br><br>Leagues: Sinnoh (winner in the Lily of the Valley Conference, also hall of famer), Johto (top 4 in the Silver Conference), Unova (top 4 in the Vertress Conference), and was unable to compete in the Kalos Conference (joining the PPC being the reason) but did get all eight badges<br>(Note: did not compete alongside Ash Ketchum, competed long after him)<br><br>Personality:  Dean is a friendly and intelligent but is very quiet and prefers to ether be alone or with Linda and/or Tabitha.   Dean actually has aspergers; as such he is very awkward in conversations and does not understand non-verbal cues at all, he also likes it when commands that given to him are very specific (which is why when he makes plans he tends to over think and over detail them).  Dean is the kind of AS person who dose like physical contact (as long as it’s friendly and what he deems appropriate).  Even though he has AS he dose like the life of a PPC agent (even though he is still getting use to the change) mostly for the fact that he can now do something about tough’s terrible fanfics and Mary sues.  He also enjoys sewing and is very good at it.<br><br>Backstory: Dean and Linda were just your average Pokémon trainers, until they got sucked into a plothole.  Lucky for them they were sucked straight into the PPC.  After some explaining, Linda was instantly hooked on the idea of joining the PPC, Dean on the other hand was very unsure (to say the least).  He was scared but didn’t want to stand in between Linda and what she considered her dream P.T. retirement job (or worse, have her join and leave him behind).  After some taught he joined with his sister as his partner.  While there he and Linda became friends with another new agent named Tabitha (a magical girl) and since then they have occasionally joined each other on missions (when it is appropriate).<br><br>Skills: Dean loves to learn about new fandoms and will learn as much as he can about them.   Between the twins he is the one who makes the plans, though he over thinks them a lot.  He is near sighted but this is not that big of a problem.  Dean’s preference in combat is guns, mostly pistols, but he is also very reliable when it comes to medical aid.  Both Dean and Linda own a mega ring. <br><br>Also I re-did Linda’s and Dean little bio pages, nothing to big in my opinion but I thought I should still tell and show:  <a href="http://123bugsy-universe.tumblr.com/"><a href="http://123bugsy-universe.tumblr.com/">http://123bugsy-universe.tumblr.com/</a></a><br><br> I know that I’m trending on some prickly ground here but I think I can make this work with Dean having AS.  As usually tell me what needs fixing and I’ll fix it as soon as I can.  :) <br></p>

            <p>Sorry, I really am, but I haven&#39;t talked to my sis much.  Not because we&#39;re on bad terms but mostly because she is working on some things for her deviantart group and I don&#39;t want to make her feel rushed.  I planing on talking to her about everything ether Sunday or Monday.  She basically has the character down but there are still some things we need to discuss, obviously.<br><br>Now, about the Atwoods, I&#39;m going to put a full list of their teams on the Board at some point but it will be after the first mission me and my sis do.  The reason being is that the mission we have right now doesn&#39;t call for any Pokemon, so it would be pointless to bring any of them along.  I do plan on giving the info out at least before I even think about doing any Badfics in any of the Pokemon continuums (I hope that makes sense).  When it comes to were they put them, I&#39;m not entirely sure, I just assumed that they would have a PC in their RC but if I&#39;ve learned any thing about the PPC, it&#39;s never assume.  So now I don&#39;t know what to say about this, I never saw anything about how or where Pokemon agents keep their Pokemon while living at the PPC, so would you have any ideas?<br><br>When it comes to the Mega Rings i&#39;ll be honest and say I just want them to have the ability to Mega Evolve their Pokemon.  I know this sounds selfish but can I get away with just this one thing.  Pretty, please with sugar on top.  OuO<br><br><br>Also I went and fixed somethings with the spelling, so I&#39;ll post that after i&#39;m done with this.  :)<br><br>P.S. I like to believe that to access one&#39;s PC account, one must type one&#39;s Trainer ID number into the PC (again if that makes any sense).<br></p>

            <p>I like the idea of characters using their Trainer ID to use the PC&#39;s in the Pokemon World like some sort  of username, but the problem I see with it is that the Atwoods are from the anime universe, yes? If they are, I can&#39;t remember Trainer ID&#39;s ever coming in the anime at all, in fact I was fairly certain they were a game-only thing. I may be wrong (I often am), but it just caught my eye. </p>

            <p>I may have learned something here:<br><br>a) Owning a Mega Ring is unusual and needs a good explanation.<br><br>b) Both your agents owning a Mega Ring each is nearly incredible and needs a very good explanation.<br><br>c) You don’t already know a point in a mission you are planning where it would be more funny (or more dramatic, but the PPC mostly goes by funny) if your agents could surprise the Sue with their ability to Mega Evolve their Pokemon.<br><br>d) Nor do you plan a mission in a badfic that is so dangerous that you know already that your agents will need the assistance of mega-evolved Pokemon. (If it even works this way. Mind, I know Pokemon only from watching my daughter play the early editions several years ago.)<br><br>e) Also, you haven’t planned a mission-surpassing story arc in which your agents and their Pokemon will develop in a way that necessarily includes mega-evolution at some point.<br><br>f) You just want your agents to have this ability for no apparent reason, or you want to keep your motives secret.<br><br>As far as I can determine, you may well end up getting Permission, writing five missions and three interludes, finding something more interesting and leaving the PPC without ever using these Mega Rings. Thus, it seems unreasonable to go through the trouble to explain the Mega Rings just to keep them.<br><br>On the other hand, you have already been called out for retreating whenever you are challenged. Saying now that your agents don’t own Mega Rings, and then bringing it up again when you actually find an opportunity to use these Mega Rings, would be weird.<br><br>So, your best strategy may be to put a meta-joke on your agent bios, like:<br>&quot;They both own Mega Rings, but keep this secret, because they are aware that they cannot use them until their author comes up with a very good explanation for this incredible fact.&quot;<br>Or more simple:<br>&quot;They may own Mega Rings, but this is still just a rumour.&quot;<br><br>Thus you get more time to think about it, and only need to confirm the rumour by telling the back story when you actually make use of it.<br><br>HG, trying to be as helpful as he can be</p>

            <p>What I mean is, could the plothole that brought them to the PPC also &#39;give&#39; them the mega rings.  <br><br>Like, hear me out, before the plothole they don&#39;t have any mega rings or mega stones (what you give to the Pokemon to mega evolve them) but after the plothole sucks them through, they suddenly have them and the correct mega stones for their Pokemon, could this work out? <br><br>(Warning: the rest is just me trying to give a good reason to have the mega rings in the first place)<br><br>When ever me and my sister go and do a mission in the Pokemon continuum I was planing to do it like this; Linda and Dean grab the correct Pokemon for the right time period (like say the fic is taking place manly in the Johto region time period and because of this know one would know what on earth a six gen Pokemon would be and that would cause problems for the agents if they showed one during a battle) but, oh no, the sue/stu they have been sent to destroy has a legendary Pokemon with her/him!  well that is were the mega Pokemon would come in to play, &quot;but wait&quot; you say, &quot;wouldn&#39;t that cause problems for the agents, for as you said no one would know what a mega Pokemon is in the Johto time period.&quot;  well you are right but what are the agents going to do about that legendary now?  <br><br>Fight it themselves? No, that would put the agents in needless danger (and even with their skills an un-winnable battle, plus it would also harm the legendary in the processes).  Have the Pokemon fight it without mega evolution? Well that could work, in them games continuum, but in the anime regular Pokemon would stand little chance against any legendary (and to have them be equal or even defeat the legendary as a regular Pokemon would make them very sue-y, in my opinion).  have the agents through out their own legendary?  No, for that would make them no better then the sue/stu they are fighting against (plus, Linda and Dean don&#39;t have any legendary Pokemon).  <br><br>&quot;well I&#39;m out of ideas&quot; you say &quot;but what can the mega evolved Pokemon do about the legendary any way?&quot; <br><br>Another good question, you see unlike regular Pokemon a mega would be able to last much longer in a battle with a legendary.  Its basically the best chance the agents got to even distract the legendary, while the agents &#39;take care&#39; of the sue/stu the legendary thinks is its &#39;dear partner&#39;.  When it comes to the people who see the mega; well if their just another sue/stu their just going to end up dead (or joining the PPC) anyway or if not, then they will just have their memory erased.  Of course when saying this will bring this question to mind &#39;why not just bring any kind of gen Pokemon with them?&#39;  well it would just cause instant confusion if one just threw out a Lucario vs. throwing out a Houndoom and then mega evolving it when the legendary is brought in.<br><br>I hope this all makes sense, I&#39;m sorry if its really long I just wanted to get this out of my brain. :)<br><br></p>

            <p>If the Poké Ball is destroyed, the Pokémon contained inside it is released, as a safety measure. The legendary Pokémon could then exact some well-deserved vengeance on the being who contained it against its will. Simple and effective, and you don&#39;t need to bend the rules sideways or pester Medical for high-powered animal sedatives to do it.<br><br>On another note, I never read French Pony&#39;s missions before today, since I tend not to read most of the spin-offs that are primarily chronicled on PPC: The Lost Tales on account of the pop-ups, but I&#39;m actually pretty glad he or she only made two. Adam and Frenchie seem pointlessly sadistic. It&#39;s one thing to off a Sue in a particularly painful manner as a matter of catharsis for an Agent, or to kill her through poetic justice, but out of the two that were published, the one Huinesoron just linked has the techies laughing like psychopaths as the Sue is electrocuted in front of them and the other Sue was left to be torn apart by mini-Balrogs that French Pony twisted out of character so that they would act like wild animals. Lordy lord. It&#39;s almost as bad as that time when Rez Montrose deliberately handed her Firefly Sue to the Reavers, and her partner just went along with it. Almost. Pretty much nothing can be worse than that.</p>

            <p>My revised agent profiles for you guys to dissect. Sorry &#39;bout the hijack, 123bugsy.<br><br>RC#7149 - Department of Floaters<br><br>Formerly the All-Purpose Yugioh Department, but I can&#39;t write duels to save my life, it seems. <br><br>--<br><br>Agent Jackets<br><br>Home continuum: World 1 <br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Class: College Student/Amateur Duelist/Floater<br><br>Personality: Jackets is a jumpy, polite, absent-minded introvert with a nigh-insatiable thirst for knowledge and a fondness for books, SCIENCE and body horror. She also has self-esteem issues, which she is trying to overcome. She is very loyal to the organization and a stickler for rules. She truly believes that since the PPC rescued her, she owes them her life.<br><br>Backstory: Jackets was a was a college student who has found herself sucked straight into a Yugioh GX badfic. She was eventually rescued by the PPC, but instead of returning to World 1, she renounced her old name and joined the PPC as a chance to save her beloved Word Worlds from badfic mayhem and repay the PPC.<br><br>Skills: Jackets has a good grasp of multiple canons, but there are a lot of TV shows and books she is totally cluless about. She is also well-read in a number of subjects and is often seen reading books on varying subjects, even during missions. She has shown a preference to using poisons and nasty chemicals.<br><br>She absolutely has no sense of direction, and has to rely on either Catharsis or SP in order not to get lost.<br><br>--<br><br>SP<br><br>Home Continuum: Yugioh GX<br><br>Species: Duel Spirit (Specifically, D.D. Scout Plane)<br><br>SP is Jackets&#39; Spirit Partner. She found the card while wandering about and decided to keep it, since she always wanted to have Different Dimension cards. She cannot see it (yet), but she can hear it on occasion.<br><br>It is easily exasperated, but it always does its best to help her.<br><br><br>--<br><br>Agent Catharsis<br><br>Home continuum: Fire Emblem 8<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Class: Summoner<br><br>Personality: Catharsis is intelligent, overworked, willing to please and kind (a bit too kind for a PPC agent), with a large number of neuroses and a rather weak stomach. He is easily nauseated, disgusted and disturbed by badfic shenanigans, and has a crippling fear of humanoid abominatons. In spite of this, he is determined to do what he considers the right thing.<br><br>Backstory: Catharsis was one of Prince Lyon&#39;s researchers during the events of FE8. He went by a different name back then. He was supposed to have been killed during the events of the game, but he barely survived via accidentally transporting himself to the PPC with a warp staff. After some of his initial shock has worn off, he volunteered to join the PPC. <br><br>Skills/Traits: Catharsis has an absurd magic resistance that can act as a repellant against ambient magic and magical versions of Aura of Smooth. (As to how much he can resist is unknown, as he is terrified of Mary Sues and variants thereof.) As a FE8 Summoner, he is also capable of using Dark magic along with the ability to use staves and summon semi-disposable units called &quot;Phantoms&quot;.<br><br>He could also see things other people couldn&#39;t. This may be the reason he is terrified of Sues. (Wobbles the Clown just plain freaks him out though. Sorry, Wobbles.)<br><br>----</p>

            <p>We didn&#39;t really need two threads about your agents in the top four, y&#39;know?<br><br>(And while I&#39;m here: capital letters! Please!

Something&#39;s been worrying me about your method of creating characters, and it&#39;s something I&#39;ve seen before.

That suggests two things:<br><br>-You don&#39;t really care or have a reason to put things in; if you did, you&#39;d be better to explain or expand on it, rather than just cross it off.<br><br>-You don&#39;t seem to have the confidence to stand up for your decisions.<br><br>As an example of either or both of these, you said: &#39;I think i&#39;ll just get rid of the Iphones I don&#39;t know what I was thinking then.&#39; But... this is, what, your third or fourth characters thread? Did you actually just write (draw) the tech stuff in on a whim (in which case, you&#39;re not using the threads to hash out your characters, but as a sort of &#39;can&#39;t use this, what&#39;s next on the list?&#39;), or did you just... see someone ask a question, and fold immediately?<br><br>I&#39;m not trying to sound harsh (I&#39;m in a bit of a hurry, so I don&#39;t have a chance to go back over this), so I apologise if I do; but I think this is a significant point you need to address - to yourself - in your growth as a writer.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Thank you for the SPGaC corrections I always appreciate it, I really need to get my sister to look over this stuff.<br><br>I think I&#39;m a little of both, sometimes I just don&#39;t think or notice something is important until someone points it out and if they do I will just fold and and change it or just get rid of it.  I think I do this because i&#39;m just trying to be agreeable to everyone and I find it easier to just change what I got or get rid of it, as I feel I have this really nasty habit of going beyond what is ok in guide lines (even when I know were the line is).<br><br>I really, really want to be apart of this group and so I feel I should just conform myself to what I feel the group wants my characters to be, if this isn&#39;t what people want me to be please, please don&#39;t be mad at me because I can change as long as I know I have people I can stand by. :)</p>

            <p>Subjectivity first: Yay, you used my gifts! The little Lord Vyce is absolutely adorable, and now I&#39;m wondering what sort of fighting style one would use with a battlespork. It would probably involve lots of thrusting and blocking, since the sharp bits are only on the end, but there&#39;s both space between the sharp bits to intercept a weapon and only a small amount of blade that a block could conceivably dull. I&#39;ve always hated the way that swordfights look in movies, with people constantly slamming the blades of their swords together while they fight. Maybe you can get away with that if your sword was indestructible, or made of plasma like a lightsaber is, but if you&#39;re using a metal blade, you&#39;re just going to be getting all kinds of chips in it if you smash the sharp part against someone else&#39;s sharp part.<br>Also, in unrelated news, you putting Linkara and Wheatley so close to each other on Linda&#39;s favorites list is making me imagine a probably altogether-too-large number of Atop the Fourth Wall/Portal crossovers. My favorites are probably corrupted!Nimue teleporting Linkara down into Comicron One&#39;s inner structure and forcing him to portal-gun through the corridors to escape, since it would be the only way to outwit her sensors, and Lord Vyce&#39;s living data form taking over a personality core. <i>It&#39;s only blue portals from here on out.</i><br><br>Okay, now to what I really came here for: analysis. First, I&#39;m not seeing anything on this &quot;Tabitha&quot;. If she is intended as the Atwoods&#39; partner, she should have a section as well, so that we can see what they look like as a team as well as individuals.<br>When two people are partners, they would normally need to share an RC and Department. There is nothing wrong with having a brother and sister work in different portions of the PPC, but they would need separate partners in order to do that, because Departments are not interchangeable. If Linda got a Bad Slash overflow mission as part of her Floaters job, would Dean simply not be able to go with her? His purview is Mary Sues, and doesn&#39;t necessarily overlap with Bad Slash, but if the two Atwoods were partners, they would need to go on all of their missions together. And if Linda just decided to only go on Mary Sue-related missions so that she could be with her brother, wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just transfer to the DMS?<br>Also, if you are planning on submitting a Permission piece soon, you are going to need to get it betaed before submitting it here, to ensure that you keep spelling and capitalization in order. Saying that someone is skilled in &quot;long-range&quot; attacks is very different from saying that he is skilled in &quot;long-raged&quot; attacks, for example, and &quot;the Board&quot; is very different from &quot;the broad&quot;, not to mention a few other miscellaneous mistakes. One swapped letter implied that Dean is capable of causing pain at a distance through the power of his anger, and not only does the Word World jump all over things like that, it just doesn&#39;t look very good.<br>You probably are going to need to explain the &quot;a Mary Sue killed their mother with plot holes that sent them to the PPC&quot; angle before getting much farther. Not only is that pretty dark, it raises a few significant questions, &quot;Why did the Sue attack their mother in the first place?&quot; and &quot;How and why did the Sue open a plot hole to the PPC?&quot; being the big ones. In addition, having &quot;a relative was killed by (opponent), so (protagonist) swore vengeance on all (opponent)s&quot; is one of those bits of backstory that <i>will</i> need to affect the story in some way, or it runs the risk of being trivialized, which is a nasty badfic trait. When you get right down to it, the immediate death of a presumably-beloved family member would have a sizable effect on someone&#39;s psyche, and you don&#39;t want to run the risk of being comparable to the Sues that have their whole species slaughtered in front of them, but then cheerily go off on adventures and romance a main character and are never affected by their horrible tragedy ever again. It&#39;s shaky ground, is what I&#39;m trying to say, because following through could easily be too dark for the PPC, but not following through would be trivializing death.<br>Their personalities are very bare-bones, but seem decent enough so far. You&#39;ll need to elaborate on a few more traits before their final form, but what they have now is a good basis to build off of.<br><br>Lastly, miscellaneous questions.<br>Why does Dean have a mini-sewing machine? What does he use it for? Making tiny scarves for mini-Turrets?<br>Which version of the Pokémon continuum are they from? The games, the anime, or one of the manga?<br>When did they pick up all of their fandoms and technology? I suppose the former could be explained away by saying that they showed affinity for them during agent training, but as for the latter, I don&#39;t recall the Pokémon continuum having smart phones and wireless Internet. I&#39;d almost say that the continuum seems to have the rough technological level of the 1990s, but it has matter-to-energy conversion, giant airships, the ability to restore life from lifeless material, and whatever process was responsible for creating Golurk and Claydol, so that&#39;s not right.</p>

            <p>Sorry, just saw this and thought I&#39;d add my two cents. <br>There is wireless internet in Pokemon, definitely the games and anime (not sure about the manga) if you think about. The PC, and the ability to transfer Pokemon from one place to another is one example of wireless tech, others include the Pokegear, Pokenav and the X-transciever all working like mobile phones, the first also being a radio. It wouldn&#39;t be an advanced wireless network to the point that we know today, but there is definitely a wireless network of sorts around. I&#39;d say especially in the regions from the last two or three generations of games. </p>

            <p>I personally always saw the Xtransceiver and its upgraded form, the Holo Caster, more as a mobile phone version of the video call devices that the Pokémon Centers use(which, inexplicably, Bulbapedia has neither a page about nor a name for), and the PC as an extension of the Poké Ball&#39;s ability to keep Pokémon stored in data form indefinitely.<br><br>The mobile phone analogues would be wireless by default, but anything wireless seems mostly to be for communication only in the Pokémon universe, instead of being multi-purpose devices like a smart phone or a personal computer, and their technology hasn&#39;t yet developed to the point where a cohesive information sharing service exists. I can see why the franchise&#39;s creators wouldn&#39;t advance it any further, though, even though the rest of the series has shown several instances of technology so advanced that it&#39;s practically magic: if they did have an Internet analogue, the Pokédex would become obsolete, and no one would want to go around catchin&#39; em all to fill up a database that people around the world already completed piecemeal in their spare time.</p>

            <p>Porygon is a Pokemon made out of computer code. In other words, in the Pokemon world, if you can program a computer, you can make a Pokemon - or a hundred of them, if you want. And then you can let them loose in the ecosystem.<br><br>In a world where that is possible, programming is a serious, viable, and <i>easy</i> terrorist weapon. Given the profusion of terrorist groups floating around, it makes perfect sense that it would also be a <i>restricted</i> technology.<br><br>And, based on the games, it seems to be. Every region has its own communications-and-information device - but they are all wildly different. There&#39;s no way the Pokétch and the PokéNav are both running, say, Java. Looking at just the Pokétch, the picture we&#39;re given is of one man coding the programs for it - and, given how frankly rubbish they are, he takes an inordinate amount of time to do so.<br><br>My theory is that he&#39;s having to program directly in machine code - there are no higher level programming languages in Pokeworld. If there were, digital Pokemon would be creatable on your home PC - no one would go hunting for them, because they could just custom-build their own.<br><br>... which leads to one conclusion: if the Pokemon universe ever gets an internet, that internet would very swiftly give birth to a varied race of <i>digital</i> Pokemon.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon">Or, as we know them, Digimon</a>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The D-Reaper was specifically created as a security program for the Digital World when the network that the Digital World grew from was in its infancy. Normally, the D-Reaper&#39;s only directive is to delete sections of the population whenever there get to be too many new Digimon, but when it sees a program it deems to be inherently destructive, it snaps down on the threat and destroys it. That&#39;s what brought it into conflict with the DigiDestined when it appeared in the show; it had begun to see humanity as a corruptive force on the Digital World, with all of their new data created every day and all of the forced Digivolution that some of their children were introducing into the system.<br><br>A creature like Missingno, if introduced into the Digital World, would almost certainly register as a threat, if not an outright virus, and the D-Reaper would try to end the potential problem. Missingno might try to fight back, but the D-Reaper would most likely end up deleting or assimilating it due to its higher level of power, and then going back into a dormant state to prepare for the next incursion.<br>Of course, there&#39;s always the chance that Missingno&#39;s consciousness could be inadequately absorbed, and the D-Reaper, unprepared for an attack from within, might conceivably have its primitive mental structures overridden by the last desperate throes of Missingno&#39;s mind, leaving a dangerous glitch-being in undisputed control of a massively powerful creature of living data that can pass through the boundaries between universes. <a href="http://at4w.wikia.com/wiki/The_Entity">But what&#39;s the chance of that happening?</a></p>

            <p>I&#39;d say that a witch turning someone into a small dog in that universe makes this a pretty high-caliber badfic as it stands. In fact, it&#39;s situations like those that prompted the founding of the Department of Improbabilities. I don&#39;t know the movie that this fic is about, so I can&#39;t pick out any out-of-character charges in the short two chapters, but the dog has apparent romantic plans for this presumably-canon human, which is incredibly gross. Also, it has human-shaped eyes coated with fur, and apparently turns into the form of a naked man at random, which are both just confusing. The problem with missioning this, though, is that it&#39;s quite short and, aside from the massive genre break where a witch turns a man into a dog, nothing much actually happens. We&#39;ve had missions on short fics before, but usually something ridiculous happens to the characters or numerous words are humorously misspelled and the results can be made fun of or something. Missioning this fic could be done, since there are some pretty big charges here, but it would be difficult to thoroughly mock something this uneventful.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right. On the other hand, the fic is still in progress, so I&#39;ll keep an eye on it, and if something happens that would make it funnier/easier to turn into a mission, I&#39;ll add it to the list of unclaimed badfic.</p>

My statement about &#39;<i>every</i> character&#39; isn&#39;t an idle comment - it&#39;s honestly true.

            <p>Lady Haleth of Brethil is in rarified company among mortals. Not only is she, alongside Tar-Ancalimë, Tar-Telperiën, Tar-Vanimeldë, and Tar-Míriel, one of only five known female leaders of Mannish nations (and in both of the latter two cases, their power was weilded by their husbands), she is also, with Emeldir the Manhearted and Eowyn of Rohan, one of only <i>three</i> mortal warrior-women in Tolkien&#39;s writings.<br><br>But how did she end up that way? The Second House of Men crossed into Beleriand around the year 311 of the First Age, but refused to move with the people of Bëor and Marach into Estolad, nor to continue westward. Instead, they settled in southern Thargelion, between the rivers Gelion and Ascar. The land was nominally owned by Caranthir, son of Feanor, but he lived far to the north, part of the Siege of Angband.<br><br>Haleth was born around 341, with her twin brother Haldar. Her people lived a spread-out existence, and for the first 35 years of Haleth&#39;s life, a peaceful one. At this point she was &#39;no-one special&#39;: the Haladin had no lord, so her father would simply have been a farmer, a hunter, a parent.<br><br>Except it isn&#39;t quite so simple. In 375, orcs swarmed out of the Blue Mountains to assault the Haladin, and Haldad, Haleth&#39;s father, was chosen to be their leader. At the southern tip of Thargelion, between two rivers, he built a stockade, and the orcs laid siege.<br><br>But how did Haldad know what to do? Where did Haleth learn the leadership skills she used when, after the death of both her father and her twin, she rallied the people and defended the fortress through another week of starvation, until Caranthir came to their rescue? The Edain would not have used such fortifications on their trek into the west, nor in their pastoral life in Thargelion. The Nandor of Ossiriand, to the south, would never make such forts.<br><br>There are only two possibilities. Haldad and his family could have travelled north and visited the Leaguer - but it is explicitly said that Caranthir ignored them, which would be difficult if they were paying him regular visits. More likely, a look at the map tells us that the dwarf-road from Nogrod and Belegost followed the north bank of the Ascar. Could Haleth have journeyed with her father to their ancient halls and high fortresses, and seen their skirmishes with the orcs? An architect who could design a stockade to hold off an entire army of orcs would be a wise choice for leader - and the gruff mannerisms of the dwarf-lords of the Blue Mountains would go down well with the wild woodsmen of the Haladin, whether weilded by Haldad or his daughter. And in after years, after Haleth dragged them through spider-infested valleys to Brethil, the Haladin famously went into battle armed with axes...<br><br>One further point: there were not, in fact, three Houses of the Edain. There were four - the fourth being the Drúedain, the Wild Men of the Wood who the Rohirrim named Woses. The distant kin of Ghân-buri-Ghân travelled west with the Haladin, and lived alongside them in Brethil - and in Thargelion. Haldad would surely have gathered these squat, dwarf-like Men into his fold when he built the stockade - and when he fell, with the best of his people&#39;s fighters, could Haleth&#39;s final bitter defence have been augmented by the disturbingly magical watch-stones of the Drûgs?</p>

            <p>It wandered a bit, I think, but I did get a few deductions in.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>In all of Tolkien&#39;s legendarium, there is only one female dwarf we know by name: Dis, sister of Thorin Oakenshield, mother of Fili and Kili. She stands in the direct line of Durin (in fact, Thorin is the last king of that line, since his heir, Dain Ironfoot, is Thror&#39;s younger brother&#39;s grandson), and as such is one of the highest ranking Longbeard dwarves.<br><br>And yes, that means she has a long beard. Tolkien stated that &#39;the Naugrim have beards from the beginning of their lives, male and female alike&#39;, and while she could have trimmed it, the Longbeard tribe pride themselves on their, well, long beards - the elves of Rivendell joke that they are long enough to drag in the water below the bridge!<br><br>Dis was born in the Lonely Mountain, and was ten years old when Smaug attacked - a small child by the standards of the dwarves, who didn&#39;t reach their adult stature until 40, and (if Gimli is anything to go by) stayed at home until around 60 years of age. She fled with her family to the Blue Mountains, far to the west - and there she would have stayed. Her childhood spanned the most tumultuous years of dwarven history since the fall of Moria - the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, nearly ten years of war which culminated in the cataclysmic Battle of  Azanulbizar. Dis was 39 years old when the battle was won.<br><br>(To compare her to other famous characters from the Quest of Erebor: Thorin was 53. Balin was 37. Gloin was a mere child of 16, while his brother Oin was all of 25. Dain Ironfoot was 32, about as young as a dwarven warrior can be - which makes his slaying of Azog (and his glimpse of Durin&#39;s Bane) all the more impressive)<br><br>Dis&#39; life was one of tunnels, forges, and caves. There were fewer women among dwarves than men - they made up about a third of the population - and as such they tended to stay at home. They weren&#39;t required to marry - in fact, the text suggests less than a third of the men got married, which corresponds to a quarter of the whole population, and suggests that roughly one in four dwarven women did <i>not</i> marry. But Dis did, and bore two sons (and potentially a daughter or two - dwarves tended to have four or less children, and didn&#39;t record their daughters on their genealogies).<br><br>There was something slightly strange about Dis&#39; family. In every recorded case, dwarves began having children at the age of 100, within a span of maybe two years. For instance, the three famous Kings Under The Mountain, Thror, Thrain, and Thorin, were born in 2542, 2644, and 2746. And, indeed, Dis stuck to this cultural imperative - her elder son, Fili, is 99 years younger than her.<br><br>But there is another data point: the time between children. Balin and Dwalin were nine years apart. So were Oin and Gloin. Dain I, Thror&#39;s father, was ten years older than his brother Borin - and there were ten years between Thror and Fror, and nine between Fror and Gror. There were even nine years between Fundin (father of Balin) and Groin (father of Gloin).<br><br>But Thrain broke the pattern - the unwritten law. His second son, Frerin, was a mere <i>five</i> years younger than Thorin, though Dis at least was born nine years after him. And Dis continued this minor transgression: there are five years between Fili and Kili.<br><br>But why? One possibility is that Dis - and her father before her - broke with the tradition of Durin&#39;s line and married outside the Longbeard clan. When Beleriand was broken, the Firebeards and Broadbeams of Nogrod and Belegast were driven from their homes, and fled to Khazad-dum to join the Longbeards. We know the clans maintained their separate identities through the millennia that followed - Thrain was able to call on the &#39;Houses of other Fathers&#39; in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. Was this an alliance which had long been building - one which had led Thrain to marry outside his own clan, securing the allegiance of one of the other tribes?<br><br>The ruined city of Belegost lay very close to Thorin&#39;s halls in the Blue Mountains. Could Dis have followed her father&#39;s example, marrying into Firebeard or Broadbeam blood? Perhaps. Fili and Kili are both described as having yellow beards, which could suggest the fire of the Firebeards. They also both wear blue hoods - reminiscent, perhaps, of their ancestry in the Blue Mountains. And, of course, in the movies, they are portrayed with short, neatly-trimmed beards - hardly the grooming style one would expect of a Longbeard of the Line of Durin!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What do they get up to, post-First Age? In the Silmaril era, there are loads of them around, and a few serve as principal characters, but I don&#39;t recall them doing much after that story ends. A little bit of research seems to imply that a number of them joined with some other Elves and made the Silvans, but also states that there were at least six clans left, so they had to have some sort of presence during the Second and Third Ages. And on a related note, who did the Avari who founded the Silvans join up with?</p>

            <p>No Avari ever appear in the stories of Middle-earth.<br><br>Actually, that&#39;s not strictly true.<br><br>In the true meaning of the word - those elves who refused the Great March, and thus never left Cuivienen - their only named characters appear in late writings discussing the departure. Here we learn that the Avari were made up of equal parts of the second and third kindreds (the Tatyar and Nelyar - among the Eldar, these kindreds became the Noldor and the Teleri), with two leaders: Morwë and Nurwë. Even further back in time, we come across the tale of the original 144 elves who awakened at Cuivienen, including the named couples: Imin and Iminyë, Tata and Tatië, Enel and Enelyë. Of course, their names literally translate as &#39;One&#39;, &#39;Two&#39;, &#39;Three&#39; - so these may not be historical persons. If they are, any of the latter four could be Avari.<br><br>After the departure of the Eldar, the Avari lived in a very dark place. In part this was literal - the only natural light in Middle-earth was starlight - but in part it was the result of the war the Valar had waged against Melkor. Yet again, Middle-earth had been shattered and broken, and the Avari were now living in an ecosystem which was in a state of rapid change. Worse, as part of the war effort, Melkor had created the orcs - by corrupting some of the elves of Cuivienen. We know that some of these survived the war, and after the Valar retreated, taking Melkor with them, his creatures would have come crawling out. In those early days, the horror of the orcs would have been similar to that of zombies: they may well have been people the remaining Avari once knew and loved, now twisted and turned to evil.<br><br>And so, despite their mistrust of the Valar, the Avari slowly spread out from Cuivienen. We know there were at least six tribes, widely sundered, because we are told their names - six wildly different versions of the word &#39;Quendi&#39;. Some of the Avari, indeed, made their way along the route of the Great March, where they joined up with the various stragglers: east of the Blue Mountains, they lived in the wild woods of Eriador and Rhovanion with the Nandor/Silvan elves (who later became the isolated populations in Mirkwood and Lorien, though at the time there was no distinction between the two forests), while others reached Beleriand and joined the Laiquendi of Ossiriand. Still mistrusting the Valar, very few of them would have lived in Doriath, with its Maiarin queen - and it is said that the Avarin Tatyar were extremely unfriendly to their kin, the Noldor, once they returned.<br><br>The Avari make one other major contribution to the history of Middle-earth: when Men awoke in Hildorien on the east coast, with the first rising of the sun, they learnt language from the Avari and the eastern Dwarves. It was from the Avari that Men first heard of the Valar, and Valinor - and as a result of their words, the three kindreds of the Edain began to seek the West. Without the Avari, there would have been no Beren, no Earendil - and no Aragorn.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: So no, in the technical sense, <i>no</i> Avari serve as principal characters - you may be thinking of the various peoples (the Nandor and Laiquendi) who turned aside from the March.</p>

            <p>Feanor beat his wife.<br><br>The first point in this argument is Feanor&#39;s personality as a whole. He is a man who resorts to violence almost every time something goes wrong. He threatened his half-brother at swordpoint over an imagined slight. He and his sons threatened &#39;fierce vengeance&#39; on anyone who should so much as find a Silmaril by the roadside and not return it - and his sons demonstrated multiple times that this was no idle threat. Feanor rallied the Noldor to form a military expidition to find Morgoth - and when the Teleri refused to help, he attacked them without mercy. Even when abandoning the host of Fingolfin, he chose to utterly destroy the ships, rather than keeping them for potential later use.<br><br>Secondly, we have Feanor&#39;s attitude towards women. His mother died when he was young, which led to one of the messiest breakups in history: first Finwe spent an age pestering Miriel to come back to life, and then, when she refused to do so in what he considered good time, he found a new bride, and switched to convincing Miriel to <i>never</i> come back. In all of Finwe&#39;s actions - the efforts Feanor would have been watching closely - there was no consideration of <i>Miriel&#39;s</i> desires. To Finwe - at least as seen by young Feanor - she was an object to be possessed, or discarded when she could be replaced.<br><br>It didn&#39;t help that Finwe&#39;s new wife, Indis, was of the Vanyar. Unlike the craft-working Noldor, the Vanyar spent their time singing, dancing - or as Feanor might have put it, looking pretty and doing nothing of value. To his eyes, although he didn&#39;t have the phrase available, Finwe&#39;s second bride was a trophy wife. Feanor, naturally, shunned her.<br><br>We also see Feanor&#39;s opinion of his own wife, Nerdanel. &quot;Were you a true wife, as you had been till cozened by Aule,&quot; he tells her, &quot;you would keep all of [our children], for you would come with us.&quot; A &#39;true wife&#39;, in Feanor&#39;s eyes, is one who obediently does everything her husband desires. He goes on to make this even more abundandly clear: &quot;If you desert me, you desert also all of our children.&quot; Not &#39;if you choose not to travel to Middle-earth&#39; - no, to Feanor, Nerdanel&#39;s options were between being a proper wife (and doing what he said), or being a bad wife (and going off by herself). He didn&#39;t even consider she might have opinions beyond himself.<br><br>And like father, like sons. In the story of Luthien, we meet Celegorm and Curufin, who - despite Curufin being married himself (and we never hear anything about his wife) - attempt to claim Luthien as a prize. Regardless of her wishes, they want to marry her to Celegorm, and thereby claim kinship to her father. When it becomes clear that they can&#39;t have the object they desire - when their second abduction fails - they switch to trying to flat-out kill her, with only Beren and Huan stopping them from succeeding. These are not elves with the faintest degree of respect for women - and in this, they follow their father.<br><br>This lack of respect also comes out in another way. Feanor and Nerdanel had seven sons, a massive number unequalled among the Eldar. Tolkien explains that elves saw conceiving a child as something of a craft project, with the result being a person who was a being in his or her own right, but also a product of their craftsmanship. While Nerdanel was also a crafter - as all the Noldor were - Feanor was the perfectionist. He is the one who would insist on having more and more sons, in order to ensure he had created the best possible product - just as he continued to craft gemstones until he had perfected the Silmarils. We know Nerdanel wasn&#39;t actively unwilling - in Valinor, that degree of coercion would never fly - but it seems unlikely she was as eager as Feanor to just keep popping out kids.<br><br>The third, and strongest, argument lies in Nerdanel&#39;s own reactions to her husband. We know she loved him at first, when he was learning smithying from Mahtan, her father. We know that for a time, she tried to moderate his temper with wisdom. But we also know that, by the time their last two sons were born, Nerdanel had completely shut herself off, emotionally, from her husband:<br><br><i>The two twins were both red-haired. Nerdanel gave them both the name Amburassa - for they were much alike and remained so while they lived. When Feanor begged that their names should at least be different Nerdanel looked strange, and after a while said: ‘Then let one be Umbarto, but which, time will decide.’<br><br>Feanor was disturbed by this ominous name (‘Fated’), and changed it to Ambarto (‘Exalted head’). But Nerdanel said: ‘Umbarto I spoke; yet do as you wish. It will make no difference.’</i><br><br>That is Nerdanel saying &#39;One of these children is going to die; if you don&#39;t care, then fine, leave me alone.&#39; She is still trying to reason with Feanor - but she refuses to allow him to touch her emotions.<br><br>Later, after the death of the Trees, this becomes even more abundantly clear:<br><br><i>She retired to her father’s house; but when it became clear that Feanor and his sons would leave Valinor for ever, she came to him before the host started on its northward march, and begged that Feanor should leave her the two youngest, the twins, or at least one of them.<br><br>He replied: ‘Were you a true wife, as you had been till cozened by Aule, you would keep all of them, for you would come with us. If you desert me, you desert also all of our children. For they are determined to go with their father.’<br><br>Then Nerdanel was angry and she answered: ‘You will not keep all of them. One at least will never set foot on Middle-earth.’</i><br><br>Nerdanel does show her emotions here, perhaps in a final effort to get Feanor to listen - but at the same time she cuts herself off entirely from her family. Tolkien said that the Eldar would never speak of &#39;having&#39; children - they would say &#39;two children are added to my house&#39;, for instance - but here Nerdanel reduces her sons to the status of objects: &#39;You will not keep all of them&#39;, she tells Feanor, and even as she pronounces a sentence of death on one of the twins, we hear her unspoken words: &#39;Just as you cannot keep me.&#39;<br><br>Nerdanel was abused by her husband, who saw her as little more than a tool - or, later, an obstacle. Is it certain that the abuse was physical? No - but knowing what we do of Feanor, it seems a safe, if tragic, bet.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The thing is, in all of Tolkien&#39;s writings, there are... um... two words of Haradrim origin:<br><br>-Mûmakil, singular Mûmak, the giant elephants of Harad. This at least tells us how you form plurals in Haradrim (add -il).<br><br>-Incánus, said to be derived from Haradrim &#39;North-Spy&#39;, as Inkā-nūsh. That means one of those words is either an adjective (&#39;Northern&#39;) or a genitive (&#39;of the North&#39;)... but we have no way of knowing which.<br><br>Oh, I beg your pardon:<br><br>-Variag is a Haradrim word for some or all of the people of...<br><br>-Khand, a nearby country, so the name may at least be related.<br><br>-Umbar is apparently a Haradrim loanword, though its meaning is unknown. We might hypothesise &#39;Haven&#39;, and stick a circumflex over the U, but we&#39;d be stabbing in the dark.<br><br>We can draw a few conclusions about phonetics - they were fond of the hard K sound, and can modify at least some vowels with accents - but other than that (and the -il ending), there is nothing to go on.<br><br>Nothing from Tolkien, at any rate. The <a href="http://www.tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Middle-earth_Role_Playing">Middle-earth Role Playing</a> series contains about half a dozen supplements on Harad, but the <a href="http://merp.wikia.com/wiki/Haradaic">MERP Wiki</a> suggests that its &#39;Haradaic&#39; was basically a mashup of &#39;serbo-croatian, arabic, persian and fantasy-forms&#39;. As far as I can tell, there is no Haradrim language.<br><br>In fact, the only Tolkien languages it&#39;s possible to learn to any significant degree are the various Elvish tongues - Quenya, Sindarin, Telerin, and Primitive Eldarin - Adunaic, and with a lot of effort, Westron. Even the Black Speech, if assumed to be identical with Orcish, has only three sentences associated with it. <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">Ardalambion</a> is a good place to find out what&#39;s available. (Tolkien apparently wrote a grammar for Taliska, Beren&#39;s mother-tongue - but it&#39;s never been released. Sad face)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Can we employ Peter Jackson&#39;s version? If the linguists working on it worked the grammar, then it can be used as basis for new language. Granted, it wouldn&#39;t be Tolkien&#39;s anymore. But the eastern world can be fleshed out even more.</p>

            <p>We do borrow word from other languages. We as users of the langauge aren&#39;t keen to make up new words.  Instead, we also used old word we have and reused it for a new definition, or changing it only adding suffixes, prefixes, and midfixes to our words if necessary.

            <p>I was just interested in continuing my Haradrim Tenth Walker fic and I didn&#39;t want to step on any toes. The lands to the south and east of Gondor are intensely fascinating to me, though I admit I find the image of Boromir leading a Mumakil charge rather wonderful.<br><br>We know that, canonically, the Haradrim army that fought for Sauron was absolutely vast, and from what I&#39;ve been able to gather the Men of Near and Far Harad alike are a loose collective of tribes almost perpetually at each other&#39;s throats for one reason or another who only came together under Sauron because they were scared of his insane orc army. What gives me pause when talking about their army, however, is that Tolkien simply didn&#39;t care about the weird brown people from the south. We don&#39;t know how they fought, though there are some reasonable guesses we can make via extrapolating from real-world tactics, but more importantly we don&#39;t know <i>why</i> they fought. How did Sauron&#39;s minions first approach the Haradrim? Were the Blue Wizards trying to negate his influence? What hell could Sauron have unleashed if he&#39;d got his claws into more of the tribes of Far Harad, where the Men are alluded to have bred with trolls? I really want to explore that in more detail, but there&#39;s nothing to go on and making huge, sweeping additions to Tolkienian canon is a charge around these parts.<br><br>Truth be told, I&#39;m scared to do it; I don&#39;t want the really hardcore LotR fans to stab me in the gizzards for missing something when I&#39;m writing this story. That said, I really want to tell it; the Haradrim have been ignored for far too long. =]</p>

            <p>What about elven ship-naming conventions? There are definitely sea-faring folk among the Elves--Alqualonde and the Grey Havens, anyone?--and a large number of the Noldor sailed to Valinor at the end of the First Age (and others did so as well in the subsequent Ages). While the only ship-name that springs to mind at the moment is Vingilot, there must have been others--or at least, I assume there were. Care to dig into how often ships were given names, what those names were inspired by, and so on?<br><br>(Why, yes, this is related to my previous call for help about translating a Noldorin Elf&#39;s Quenya name.

            <p>Now that <i>is</i> a tricky one. So tricky, in fact, that I have two answers.<br><br>In all the recorded history of Middle-earth, there are eight ships whose names we are told:<br><br>-Eärrámë (Q. &#39;Sea-Wing&#39;), the ship of Tuor and Idril.<br>-Vingilótë (Q. &#39;Foam-Flower&#39;)/Vingilot (S.)/Rothinzil (Ad.), Eärendil&#39;s ship.<br>-Entulessë (Q. &#39;The Return&#39;), the first Numenorean ship to return to Middle-earth.<br>-Númerrámar (Q. &#39;West-Wings&#39;), a ship of Numenor.<br>-Palarran (Q. &#39;Far-Wanderer&#39;), ditto.<br>-Hirilondë (Q. &#39;Haven-Finder&#39;)/Turuphanto (Q. &#39;Wooden Whale&#39;), ditto.<br>-Eämbar (Q. &#39;Sea-Home&#39;), a floating Numenorean headquarters.<br>-Alcarondas (Q., meaning unclear)/Aglarrâma (Ad.), the &#39;Castle of the Sea&#39;, Ar-Pharazon&#39;s great ship. Its name contains &#39;alcar&#39;, glory (and in Adunaic, &#39;aglar&#39;).<br><br>Every one of these ships is named in Quenya - right down to the one built by the biggest elf-hater of them all. Clearly, that&#39;s just how ships are named; since Tuor and Eärendil both learnt the art from Cirdan, they probably picked the habit up from him, as well.<br><br>Further, we can point out that every name has meaning. You don&#39;t name your ship after your mother or what have you - you name it after its role (as Entulessë), or as a description (Alcarondas, probably), or in one case after your house (Eärrámë - Tuor was the Lord of the House of the Wing in Gondolin). So that&#39;s answer number one.<br><br>But... every one of those ships was built by men - six of them, in fact, by Numenoreans, and the other two by the father and grandfather of Elros Tar-Minyatur, first King of Numenor. We know that the elves built ships, too - at Alqualonde, on the Falas, on Balar, at Mithlond and Edhellond. But of all those ships - the Swan-Ships of the Teleri, the ship of Amroth - we are never given a personal name. The only Elf-built ship which <i>does</i> have a name is the ship that bears the Ringbearers West - and it&#39;s known simply as &#39;The White Ship&#39;. Tolkien could certainly have slipped in the Quenya form, Lossecirya or Ciryalosse, but he chose not to.<br><br>So do the Eldar actually name their ships? Given how the Teleri thought of theirs - as practically alive - I&#39;m tempted to wonder whether they believed that each ship had its <i>own</i> name, intrinsic to it - and not discoverable by them (at least, not yet). On the other hand, these <i>are</i> elves we&#39;re talking about; their whole thing, right from the start, was assigning names to things, and awakening them.<br><br>I don&#39;t know. But I&#39;m reminded of Philosopher at Large&#39;s comment on the fact that the Silmarillion doesn&#39;t bother to name the Ten who stood by Finrod when he left Nargothrond - because it is the <i>elven</i> history of Middle-earth, and they <i>already know</i> who they are. Could it be that the individually-crafted ships of Cirdan and the Teleri are so unique that they don&#39;t <i>need</i> names - that the Eldar can tell which ship they&#39;re seeing at a glance, and know which one you&#39;re talking about just by the character you describe.<br><br>It would be incredibly tricky to write - but at the same time fascinating.</p>

            <p>The thinking, mind you, should (and will) be combined with a bit of research related to who precisely built the ships the Noldor returned to Valinor in at the end of the First Age. Why, you ask? Well...nah, spoilers, but I have my reasons. I suppose they could each just be referred to as &#39;____&#39;s ship&#39;, but how would the groups aboard each ship be divided? How many Noldor even returned? How many ships were there?<br><br>...yeah, I&#39;ve got some reading to do. Thank you very much for all of this; it will probably end up being helpful (I hope), and, at the very least, it&#39;s fascinating.<br><br>One more topic, this time a person (and unrelated to my previous questions): Finduilas, sister of Imrahil, wife of Denethor, and mother of Boromir and Faramir. What do we know about her? What would she have been like? How different do you think her family&#39;s lives, not to mention the War of the Ring, would have been had she lived?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>This... sigh. This is going to be another miserable one, isn&#39;t it?<br><br>Finduilas of Dol Amroth is about as tragic as her First Age namesake. Actually, her father, Adrahil II, seems to have had something of an obsession with the original Finduilas: his other daughter, Finduilas&#39; elder sister, was named Ivriniel, after the Pools of Ivrin - and therefore after the nickname Gwindor gave Finduilas, <i>Faelivrin</i>.<br><br>Why did Adrahil attempt to disguise his reasons for his elder child&#39;s name, but abandon such deception for Finduilas? We might almost suppose a disapproving relative. While his father, Angelimir, lived until 2977 - well after Finduilas&#39; birth - we know nothing of his mother. Might she have been from a family which disapproved of the legends of the Elder Days - perhaps even a family who traced their descent back to Harondor, the Umbar-influenced southern province of Gondor which had been finally taken by the Haradrim in 2885. If she were the same age as Angelimir, she would have been some 22 years of age at the time - plenty of time for her to have picked up on the cultural, Black Numenorean influenced (though of course not actively evil) prejudices of her homeland.<br><br>Finduilas lived in an era of tension in Gondor. Twenty years before her birth, the kingdom had finally been forced to abandon most of Ithilien, while Harondor - as mentioned - had fallen fifty-odd years previously; in 2951 - the year <i>after</i> her birth - Sauron openly declared himself in Mordor. The Corsairs of Umbar were an ever-present threat to Dol Amroth - up until 2980, when a certain &#39;Thorongil&#39; of Gondor (or Aragorn, as we later know him) burned their fleet.<br><br>But by that time, Finduilas was no longer in the city. In 2976, she was wed to Denethor, son of the Ruling Steward, and moved to Minas Tirith. The following year, her grandfather - the man who must surely have arranged such an advantageous marriage - died, leaving her father as Prince of Dol Amroth - and thus unable to visit his daughter. Finduilas, who had grown up in a Sindarin-speaking city by the sea, was now stranded, cut off from her family, speaking Westron in the shadow of the mountains.<br><br>Her new husband was twenty years older than her - at the time of their marriage, 46 to her 26 - and he seems to have been rather eager to beget an heir. Certainly there were only two years between their marriage and the birth of Boromir, indicating conception around a year after the wedding. Denethor was wise, noble, and proud - but while we are told he was deeply in love with Finduilas, we can&#39;t really imagine him whispering sweet nothings to her. Her husband&#39;s older sisters were around twice Finduilas&#39; age, so unless her own sister travelled to Minas Tirith with her - unlikely, since in most cultures, the older sibling marries first, suggesting Ivriniel was already wed - Finduilas would have no real peers.<br><br>Instead, she turned to her books - the same books of ancient lore and tales that her younger son would later come to love. In this, she perhaps grew closer to her father-in-law: Ecthelion named his son after a famous elf of the First Age, Denethor of Ossiriand, and may well have shared Findulias&#39; birth-father&#39;s interest in the Elder Days.<br><br>In 2983, Faramir was born, leaving Finduilas weakened - and the following year, Ecthelion died. Denethor now became more and more consumed by the affairs of the city and kingdom, leaving little time for his wife - and he certainly wouldn&#39;t have been interested in sharing tales out of the Elder Days with her (neither Boromir nor Faramir bear elven names). The shadow of Mordor hung heavy on her heart, bringing to mind the darkness of Morgoth which ultimately consumed Beleriand. She pined for the Sea - and perhaps, in part, this came from her knowledge that the only escape from darkness, for the Eldar at least, lay to the West. With only a tiny splinter of elven blood, Finduilas could never hope to sail the Straight Road - but the Sea would still be, to her mind, a defence, a shield, a last resort.<br><br>Finduilas grew weaker and weaker. Boromir, now a grown child, would have spent his time with his father, in training to become the next Steward. Only Faramir was left for Finduilas to read her stories to, and to share her dreams - including, perhaps, that famous image of a great wave overcoming the land.<br><br>And as she felt her death approaching, could she have resisted going back to that story she must have heard during her childhood - and must also have avoided from then on - the Lay of the Children of Hurin, with its heartbreaking account of her namesake&#39;s betrayal and death? Their stories were so different - but they had come, as Finduilas surely realised, to the same place. The House of Hurin had brought ruin upon them both - for the line of the Stewards bore the same name as Turin&#39;s father.<br><br>And, somewhere in the dusty libraries of Minas Tirith, I can imagine you would find a scroll, carefully rolled, bearing the story of Turin and Finduilas in a fair hand - with one passage lightly underlined:<br><br>&quot;And this last I say to you: she alone stands between you and your doom. If you fail her, it shall not fail to find you. Farewell!&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>(I&#39;ll get to Finduilas later)<br><br>Most of the Noldor - and, for that matter, of the Sindar - who survived the First Age sailed straight to Valinor. In the Second Age, apart from such far-wandered as Thranduil&#39;s family, or Maglor, there were two Elven kingdoms: Lindon, run by the High King of the Noldor, and clinging on to what little was left of Beleriand, and Eregion, also led by Noldor (Galadriel, then Celebrimbor). There was no kingdom of the Sindar.<br><br>Of course, it&#39;s that &#39;most who survived&#39; that makes things difficult. The survivors I can think of are:<br><br>-Galadriel, Celeborn, and anybody with them. They seem to have left Beleriand before the War of Wrath.<br><br>-The refugees of Nargothrond, Gondolin, Doriath, the Falas, and the Havens of Sirion, all on the Isle of Balar under Gil-Galad. This is the group that included Cirdan, and probably formed the population of Lindon.<br><br>-The remaining Feanorians roaming in East Beleriand, down around Amon Ereb. Their leaders were dead, but there were probably some still there.<br><br>-The Nandor of Ossiriand.<br><br>(Side note: I actually want to plot out the &#39;who went where&#39; chart; it might be quite interesting)<br><br>We know that the Feanorians wouldn&#39;t really be welcome anywhere, and therefore almost <i>had</i> to have sailed West. I imagine a large part of the Balar contingent did, too: their choice was between going to Aman, or clinging to the last remnants of their old life. Gil-Galad stayed, and tried to remember the glory of Beleriand. I don&#39;t think most people would be up for that.<br><br>The Eregion group probably mostly stayed; they&#39;d already found themselves a new path. And the Nandor? Their forests were gone, and there&#39;s no indication of a large resettlement operation - neither Mirkwood or Lorien shows signs of it (and, in fact, the Nandor had always been against having a king, for cultural reasons: apart from Eregion-of-the-smiths, every Elven nation was a monarchy at this point). So I think the Nandor finally finished the journey they started at Cuivienen, and sailed West.<br><br>What ships did they sail? We know the Host of the West came over in swanships of the Teleri, and based on the previous battles that had been fought, we can guess large numbers of them died. Was there enough space to just take everyone across now?<br><br>A second option is Balar - as an island, it probably had a large fleet of ships, but once they moved to Lindon, they were no longer needed. In fact, they could have docked at Mithlond, the Grey Havens, for Cirdan to fit them up for the ocean voyage.<br><br>As for how to distinguish the ships... to render it human-understandable (if you accept my no-names theory), I&#39;d use adjectives:<br><br>&quot;Melleth stepped aboard the sleek ship, looking out over the water. Her love had already sailed, his proud vessel cutting through the surf as it sailed to the Undying Lands. Now it was time to follow.<br><br>&quot;Melleth turned, taking in her last sight of Middle-earth: the shattered remnants of the tall Blue Mountains, the pitiful gaggle of huts that Gil-Galad called a kingdom. How little it resembled the glory of Gondolin, or of Eithel Sirion before its fall!<br><br>&quot;There was no point lingering, none at all. The master of the sleek ship stood by the boarding ramp, waiting for the last passengers, and then they would be off, leaving the mortal lands forever in their sleek vessel. Melleth closed her eyes. Despite everything - she would miss it.&quot;<br><br>&#39;The sleek ship&#39; is different to &#39;the proud ship&#39;, which is different to &#39;the flighty ship&#39;, and so on. This isn&#39;t quite how I imagine the Eldar would think of it - actually, they wouldn&#39;t necessarily think a name, but rather remember with that strange living memory the way the ship feels - but it might be how they&#39;d say it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right that we know very little about Celebrian, apart from the tale of her capture and departure into the West. But still, there&#39;s a little to go on.<br><br>We don&#39;t actually know when Celebrian was born - but we can make a few guesses. The first time she is mentioned is way back in 1300 S.A., living in Eregion with her parents, shortly before they moved to Lorien. Eregion was founded around 700 S.A. - and I think that marks a good candidate for Celebrian&#39;s birth.<br><br>We know that elves didn&#39;t have children in times of war and upheaval. What better time to start a family than when you&#39;ve just founded a nice, safe kingdom? The turmoils that marked the end of the First Age are over. You have Lindon as an ally in the west, Moria to the east - you&#39;re safe.<br><br>And then there&#39;s her name. &#39;Celeb-&#39; is silver, while &#39;Rian&#39; apparently derives from &#39;Crown-gift&#39;. There&#39;s an obvious reference there to her hair (if, indeed, she had silver hair), as well as to her parents&#39; names - <b>Celeb</b>orn, and Galad<b>ri</b>el (and yes, that is the same element - &#39;Maiden <b>crowned</b> with a festive garland&#39;). So... if there&#39;s two meanings to her name already, why not assume a third? A silver crown or circlet seems a perfect ornament for the Lord and Lady of Eregion (Galadriel and Celeborn ruled there before Celebrimbor did); could &#39;Celebrian&#39; also mean &#39;A gift from the silver crown&#39;? It&#39;s speculative, but I think a birthdate of around 700 S.A. is plausible.<br><br>Around 1350-1400 S.A., Galadriel and Celeborn moved to Lorinand, the later Lothlorien. Since we know Celebrian didn&#39;t die in Eregion four hundred years later, it seems likely that she moved with her parents - and thus watched from afar as her childhood home was destroyed by Sauron&#39;s orcs. I can&#39;t imagine that was a very pleasant experience.<br><br>And then... nearly two thousand years pass before the next major event: the War of the Last Alliance. We know that Celebrian met Elrond at some point (she married him, after all) - could this have been when, with him as Gil-Galad&#39;s herald, her as part of the forces of Amdir of Lorinand? We don&#39;t know what role she took - elves didn&#39;t forbid women from becoming fighters, but she could equally have been a healer - but given what happened to Eregion, we can be certain she <i>did</i> take part. Amdir&#39;s forces were caught in the Dead Marshes during the Battle of Dagorlad - should we picture Celebrian anxiously waiting for news of her parents (remember, Galadriel&#39;s mother named her Nerwen, &#39;Man-maid&#39; - she was a fighter, too!), or should we picture her clawing her way out of the swamp, fending off orcs with a mud-caked sword? Either is possible.<br><br>Celebrian spent the next couple of millennia with her husband (they married in 109 T.A.). Like most elves, they had their children fairly quickly, and fairly close together - the twins in 130, Arwen in 241. This isn&#39;t to say that Rivendell was perfectly safe - it sat in the eastern marches of Rhudaur, the first province of Arnor to fall to the Witch-King. Angmar rose in 1300 T.A., and for the next six hundred years Rivendell would have been in a state of tension. They were allied with Arthedain, and with Lindon - but the road between was owned by the hill-men of Rhudaur, and a dangerous route indeed. Although further away, Lorien would have been a closer friend.<br><br>And then, nearly 2000 years after her own children had been born, Celebrian found herself as a foster-mother to Arahael, son of the chieftain of the Dunedain. In fact, this was a role she continued in for the next five hundred years, fostering (with her husband, of course) a full eight future chieftains. Did she know, with some inkling of her mother&#39;s foresight, that her daughter would be bound to a future member of the line of Elendil - one of the descendents of the little mortal boys she cared for, watched grow up, grow old, and die? I don&#39;t know. Perhaps. Certainly she would have seen in them the likeness of their forefathers - both the ones she helped raise, the ones she had seen from afar as rulers of Arthedain and Arnor (and remember, Valandil son of Isildur was also raised in Rivendell), and even all the way back to their first ancestor: Elros, her husband&#39;s mortal brother.<br><br>Celebrian&#39;s injury happened in 2509 of the Third Age, while she was travelling to visit her parents in Lorien. This is not a happy time in Middle-earth: Sauron had returned from the East some 50 years earlier as the Necromancer, prompting the formation of the White Council. The Ring had just been discovered by Deagol, and in 2480, Sauron had sent orcs to fill the caves of the Misty Mountains (and reoccupy Moria). We say that Celebrian was just going to visit her parents - but given the new danger of the journey, how likely is that? Of course, she&#39;d made the trip hundreds of times before, but she wasn&#39;t stupid: she knew that the High Pass was dangerous.<br><br>Far more likely, then, is that she was travelling as part of a messenger party, from Elrond (of the White Council) to Galadriel (ditto). Yes, she likely went along in order to see her family - but the trip as a whole had a different purpose. Given the surrounding events, I think I even know what:<br><br>In 2509 - the same year Celebrian was captured - Gondor was under siege. Cirion the Steward called for help - specifically, from the Éothéod of the northern vale of Anduin. In 2510, Eorl rode south, won the Battle of the Field of Celebrant, and founded Rohan. I can&#39;t imagine Galadriel would have let Cirion&#39;s messengers pass by without remarking on it - and sending messages to the rest of the White Council. When Elrond wanted to reply, Celebrian asked to travel with the messengers - and so the story unfolded.<br><br>So yeah... not a lot to say, really. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The children of Elrond are interesting, in that they all appear on-page, but tell us next to nothing about themselves.<br><br>Elladan and Elrohir were born in 130 T.A., their sister Arwen some hundred years later - which, by the time of the War of the Ring, makes them essentially the same age. By the year 350, they would all have been well into adulthood. They would have known that they had a Choice to make, the choice between elven immortality and the Gift of Men - but they also knew that it was far into their future.<br><br>Still, it&#39;s hard to imagine they wouldn&#39;t have thought about it occasionally, and watched the events around them with a judging eye, trying to determine which life was &#39;better&#39;. They would have seen, and visited, the fading remnants of the elven kingdoms - Lindon and Mithlond, Lorien and Greenwood - and would have watched the Kingdoms of Men grow into their full glory.<br><br>But then, on the flipside, they would have seen the dissolution of Arnor, and the northern Dunedain falling into civil war. They would all have witnessed the rise of Angmar - and this is where they actually step into history, for we know that the Eldar actually fought in some of those wars. Were the children of Elrond among them? Elladan, Elrohir - and even Arwen, because the Eldar didn&#39;t believe that &#39;women can&#39;t fight&#39;.<br><br>Whether they took part in the wars or not, it must have made them distinctly dubious about the mortal side of their ancestry. With all the infighting, the shattered North Kingdom was a showcase of the worst men had to offer - and in the end, it was betrayal and indifference by the South Kingdom of Gondor that led to Arthedain&#39;s final ruin.<br><br>But then the coin flips the other way. A darkness awakens in Moria - and rather than helping to fight it, or the orcs which follow, Amroth of Lorien shuns the dwarves. Galadriel and Celeborn, still living in Lorien, go along with this - if, indeed, it wasn&#39;t Galadriel&#39;s suggestion, her foresight showing her a hint of what the dwarves had uncovered. Then, too, came the great shock of Amroth&#39;s death, drowning while trying to cross the Sea - a reminder that even for the Eldar, the passage West was not a foregone conclusion.<br><br>And in 2012 T.A., a small boy was brought to their house: a cousin of theirs, Elrond would have told them, though far removed in generation. Arahael, and all the little boys who followed him, showed Elrond&#39;s children what mortal men were truly like: the innocence, the honour, the glory, and, yes, the corruption, the wickedness, the thoughtlessness. It&#39;s hard to imagine Elrond didn&#39;t know what he was doing: showing his children both sides of their choice, not hiding anything, trusting them to make their own decisions.<br><br>Then comes the great shift: Celebrian is attacked, and departs for Valinor. Arwen, whether she used to be a warrior or a healer, actually seems to suffer from depression after this - she turns inwards, to the point where her sewing a banner for Aragorn is viewed as a great achievement. We know she spent time in Lorien, on Cerin Amroth - the memorial to their lost king, and in her mind, to her departed mother. Perhaps she found some peace in the timelessness of the Golden Wood.<br><br>And then came Aragorn - one of the endless stream of little boys, now grown up, a cousin become a vision out of the past. What did Arwen see in him, that made her fall so deeply in love with him - that drew her out of herself and let her help and support him? Well, she <i>was</i> in Lothlorien at the time... did she look into the Mirror? Perhaps.<br><br>But what about her brothers? They, too, became obsessive after Celebrian&#39;s departure - but their obsession was with hunting and killing orcs. They rode with the Dunedain on their hunts - they took those little boys and followed them into battle, defending the lands around so that no-one else would have to suffer as they did.<br><br>We all know their story in the War of the Ring, I won&#39;t repeat it here - but what about after? Arwen, of course, married Aragorn and later died, but her brothers? Tolkien remains silent on whether they sailed at last to Valinor, or stayed behind to become mortal.<br><br>To find out, let&#39;s go right back - back to their names. Names are often significant to the Eldar, and these weren&#39;t just any children - they were the sons and daughters of Galadriel&#39;s child, a child who may well have shared her mother&#39;s gift of foresight.<br><br>Arwen Undomiel is the only one known to have two names - and the first, interestingly, has the same meaning as her grandmother&#39;s. Ar-wen, &#39;Noble Maiden&#39;, is not so different from Galadriel&#39;s father-name, &#39;Artanis&#39;, &#39;Noble Woman&#39;. And the second?<br><br>The Evenstar is Eärendil, Arwen&#39;s grandfather (Elrond&#39;s father). So already she is named for her two greatest grandparents - but the Evenstar name has more significance than that. Lingering in the West after the sun sets, it is a guide to the Eldar, leading them along the Straight Road - and when it fades, night has truly come.<br><br>The name is prophetic, in more ways than one. So... could the twins&#39; names be, too? The Elf-Rider Elrohir, and the Elf-Man Elladan: might it be that Elrohir was foreseen to become a brave knight in the war with Angmar, and ultimately to choose to be an elf, while Elladan, moved by the plight of mortals, elected to join them? If so, it would be a mirror to their father&#39;s life: his own twin brother, Elros, became a mortal king, while Elrond became a powerful Elf Lord.<br><br>But like all things elven, this mirror had faded by the Fourth Age. There were no kingships or lordships remaining: just the Straight Road into the West, or life in the Last Homely House as the Reunited Kingdom grew bright and glorious - without the Eldar.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Grishnakh is an Orc of Mordor, and more specifically of Barad-dur itself. He is short, crook-legged, almost apelike. This gives us the immediate impression that, unlike the tall, solid Ugluk, Grishnakh is unlikely to be a battle-line fighter. Instead, we can see him as exactly what he is: a raider, skilled at slipping into places, sneaking around, and killing without being seen.<br><br>Grishnakh is fairly high-ranking; not only is he leading a large group of Orcs on an independant assignment a long way from Mordor, he also seems to know about the One Ring - and recognises Merry&#39;s imitation of Gollum. Whether he was given this information, or obtained it for himself by eavesdropping, it is clear that he spent time actually inside Barad-dur.<br><br>Most interesting, in light of the later conflict between Shagrat and Gorbag, is that Grishnakh professes admiration and loyalty to the Nazgul. We know that even between the close-together towers of Minas Morgul and Cirith Ungol, the orcs saw each other as bitter rivals. It&#39;s hard to imagine Grishnakh, back in Barad-dur, speaking kindly of Morgul orcs. However, we see him putting on a united front for outsiders: against the goblins of Moria and the orcs of Isengard, Grishnakh will defend even his sworn Mordorian enemies. It would have been interesting to see how he treated forces out of Dol Guldur - another of Sauron&#39;s direct commands, but outside Mordor proper.<br><br>In Ugluk, we see a stark contrast to Grishnakh. While the Mordor orc comes across as brash, almost impulsive, Ugluk seems almost an &#39;elder statesman&#39;. He, alone of his company, understands the dangers of allowing a Rohirric scout to go free, and he is a skilled enough fighter to duel Eomer hand to hand.<br><br>And he knows it. As he is fond of declaring to his &#39;northern rats&#39; - &quot;We are the fighting Uruk-Hai!&quot; In the books, that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a separate species - &#39;uruk&#39; simply means &#39;orc&#39;, and &#39;hai&#39;, &#39;folk&#39;. Ugluk is claiming, in effect, that his people are the only <i>true</i> orcs. He says it with the pride of the one who shaped them to be what they are - of an orc who clawed his way out of the mass of the likes of Grishnakh, and created a company of true warriors. He may not be their father, but they are his &#39;lads&#39; nontheless. In the service of Saruman, who feeds them on man-flesh, Ugluk has fulfilled his potential as a warrior.<br><br>So how old <i>is</i> Ugluk? Tolkien was notoriously undecided on what, exactly, Orcs were, so the best way to answer this is to look for other examples. Bolg, son of Azog, reigned as king of the orcs of Moria from his father&#39;s death in 2799, to the Battle of the Five Armies in 2941 - some 150 years. We can certainly assume he was already a full-grown, experienced warrior at the start of his reign (orcs not being noted for their loyalty), and that he still had a good few years left in him at his final battle (or else he wouldn&#39;t have been able to fight). So let&#39;s assume an orc can live at least as long as a dwarf - around 250 years.<br><br>Knowing that, we can see that Ugluk clearly didn&#39;t <i>begin</i> in the service of Saruman - while already corrupted, Saruman only fell under Sauron&#39;s direct control around T.A. 3000, when the Dark Lord returned to Mordor. Nineteen years seems just a <i>little</i> young for Ugluk. The idea that he might have been sent to Isengard by Sauron doesn&#39;t hold up to Ugluk&#39;s obvious scorn for Mordor. <br><br>There is an answer, and it lies on the literal White Hand. Saruman originally opposed the idea of the White Council attacking Dol Guldur because he thought the slow rise of Sauron would prompt the One Ring to reveal itself; he later agreed when he realised Sauron might know where the Ring had actually been lost. His fascination with Rings of Power was already well engrained - and so we might assume that he had already tried to make his own.<br><br>With the fall of Dol Guldur, Sauron fled to Mordor. There is no word of what happened to his armies; many were no doubt destroyed, but could one Ugluk, then a raider much like Grishnakh, have retreated into the woods? Abandoned and betrayed by the Dark Lord, he could have remained there, watching, as Saruman hunted through the ruins - and, indeed, as the White Wizard forged his own, weaker but still potent, Ring. We know that the voice of Saruman was a powerful instrument of control, even before he wore a ring; augmented by his creation, might he not have seen the &#39;wisdom&#39; in creating an army of his own? And could he not have called the abandoned orcs out of the forest, bringing them down to Fangorn and Isengard long before Sauron claimed him?<br><br>We might even imagine that Saruman had a &#39;noble&#39; purpose in mind. He took Ugluk and his lads, the scheming, squabbling, hunchbacked, treacherous orcs of Sauron, and - through training, through control, maybe even through magic - helped them remake themselves into tall, disciplined warriors. Surely, this was an act of good! Saruman was <i>redeeming</i> these orcs - taking their malformed state and turning them into <i>true</i> warriors - the only real orcs in Middle-earth - the fighting Uruk-Hai!<br><br>Somehow, I don&#39;t think Gandalf would have been convinced.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The most interesting thing about Theodred is who he would have surrounded himself with. As a child in Edoras, he had no real peers of his own age. His cousin Eomer was born in T.A. 2991 - thirteen years after Theodred. In fact, during his childhood, his closest kin in age would likely be his aunt: we know that Theodwyn, sister to Theoden, was born in 2963, making her fifteen when Theodred was born.<br><br>Thengel and Morwen married in 2943; their second child, Theoden, was born in 2948, a gap of five years. The gap between Eomer and Eowyn is also 4-5 years, suggesting that &#39;five years between children&#39; might be the general rule for Rohan (and Gondor - there are five years between Boromir and Faramir). Given the 15 year gap between Theoden and Theodwyn, that suggests the five children were born in &#39;43 (nine months after her parents were married), &#39;48 (Theoden), &#39;53, &#39;58, &#39;63 (Theodwyn).<br><br>Elfhild, Theodred&#39;s mother, died giving birth to him; he would not remember her. Thengel, his grandfather, king of Rohan, died when he was two, so he might just remember a grizzled old man. Interestingly, though, Morwen, Thengel&#39;s wife, was nearly 20 years younger than him; she would have been only 58 when Thengel died. Further, she was not Rohirric - she was kin to the Prince of Dol Amroth, and it <a href="http://www.zarkanya.net/Tolkien/Stewards_and_Dol_Amroth.htm">has been shown</a> that the Dol Amroth line usually lived to around 100. We know that Morwen wasn&#39;t around for the War of the Ring - or else she would have been mentioned - but she may have died only a little before (she would have been 97 in 3019).<br><br>The only other nobleman we know of, who could have been around Theodred&#39;s age, was Erkenbrand - but he was born and raised in the Hornburg, again far away from Edoras.<br><br>So we have young Theodred growing up, raised by his father, now a king, and his grandmother. His teenaged aunt grew into a beautiful woman, and when Theodred was eleven, married Eomund, Lord of Aldburg, and moved out of town. Judging by the lack of mention of them, we can suppose that his other three aunts were either dead, or simply had no (living) children - otherwise, there would later have been other candidates for the throne than Eomer. His young cousins, once they were born, lived far away in Aldburg.<br><br>There <i>were</i> noble children of Theodred&#39;s age, and in a similar situation to him - in Rohan, Boromir was born in 2978, making him the same age as Theodred. Faramir was five years younger - and in 2984, Ecthelion II died, making Boromir the son of the Steward. Further, in 2988, Denethor&#39;s wife died; it is hard to imagine Theodred and Boromir meeting and <i>not</i> bonding over their near-identical life stories. And with a Gondorian grandmother, we can easily imagine the young Crown Prince spending time in Minas Tirith.<br><br>In T.A. 3000, when Theodred was 22, Eomer 9, and Eowyn only 5, everything changed. Sauron returned to Mordor, and through the Palantiri, twisted Saruman to his alliegance. Orc raids in Rohan increased dramatically - as demonstrated by the fact that, two years later, Eomund was killed. When Theodwyn died (essentially of grief), her children (Eowyn now being seven) were brought to Edoras.<br><br>How did Theodred, now 24, handle his very young cousins? The evidence suggests that he... didn&#39;t. King Theoden was now in his mid-fifties, and grief-stricken by the death of his sister and close friend (here, we might imagine, one Grima son of Galmud was a great comfort to him). Since Theoden had been the (effective) First Marshal of the Mark, that left no effective military leader in Rohan - until Theodred stepped up. He moved out of his father&#39;s house, transferring to the Hornburg, and became Second Marshal - leader of the forces of western Rohan. In fact, he rather overstepped his bounds - Elfhelm, who was under his command at the Fords of Isen, was from the Muster of <i>Edoras</i>, the traditional purview of the First Marshal.<br><br>In all this, Theodred would have had to deal with Erkenbrand - the Lord of the Westfold, a capable military leader in his own right, who was now under the command of someone who was either his own age (but new-come to the West-mark) or younger than him. How well did they work together? Were they friends, or rivals, or simply superior and subordinate? It&#39;s impossible to say.<br><br>From afar, Theodred would have watched his cousin Eomer grow into a tall, proud warrior, and eventually take up his father&#39;s role as Lord of Aldburg - and, indeed, become Third Marshal of the Mark, at just as young an age as Theodred had. Stranded out in the Westfold by the constant incursions of Saruman&#39;s (though of course, no one could <i>prove</i> they were Saruman&#39;s) orcs, did Theodred resent his cousin&#39;s easy job, back in the safe east? Or was he too busy worrying about his father, who seemed to be turning grey ahead of his time, and every time Theodred visited was more bent, more weary, less and less like Theoden of old.<br><br>Perhaps it was Morwen&#39;s death which finally broke Theoden for good, turning him into the barely-conscious king we first see in Edoras. Perhaps, too, it was this event which finally brought Theodred and Eomer together - through mutual grief, mutual respect for each other&#39;s military prowess, and mutual recognition of the perilous state Rohan had reached. Certainly we know they did reconcile - when Theodred was slain by Saruman&#39;s treachery, he spoke his last words to Elfhelm and Grimbold:<br><br>&quot;Let me lie here - to keep the ford until Éomer comes.&quot;</p>

            <p>Sadness aside--there&#39;s something in here you might want to change on Netilardo (given that I just checked and it&#39;s been transferred to there). Specifically, in the sixth paragraph, there&#39;s this sentence: &quot;There were noble children of Theodred&#39;s age, and in a similar situation to him - in Rohan, Boromir was born in 2978...&quot; Now, I don&#39;t know about you, but I always thought Boromir was born in Gondor... :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Seeing as you&#39;ve mentioned him, Elfhelm. A while back I looked around for information concerning him but came up short, just how much do we know about him and where did he get his name?

            <p>Elfhelm and Grimbold held similar positions - both were high-ranking Captains of the Mark. Grimbold was a Marshal of Westfold, while Elfhelm was in command of the defense of Edoras after the First Battle of the Fords of Isen. Grimbold was sadly killed in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but Elfhelm survived to stand as a witness at Aragorn&#39;s coronation, and to be made Marshal of the East-mark - one of the two highest-ranking soldiers in Rohan - by King Eomer.<br><br>Grimbold, we know, was a hereditary lord of some kind - his home was called Grimslade (&#39;Hillside dell of Grim&#39;), suggesting that he ruled in the foothills of the White Mountains. He also appears to be a great friend of Elfhelm&#39;s - and since Elfhelm is connected to Edoras, that suggests that Grimslade is probable in the eastern parts of Westfold, near to the capital.<br><br>But what about Elfhelm? The &#39;-helm&#39; of his name is clear - it means helmet - but is &#39;elf&#39; really &#39;elf&#39;? There are four names in Middle-earth recorded with &#39;elf&#39; at the beginning: Elfhelm, Elfhild (wife of Theoden), Elfstan (grandson of Sam Gamgee), and Elfwine (son of Eomer). Of these, the latter two are actually Old English translations of pretty famous names - Elfstan means &#39;Elf-stone&#39;, or Elessar, while Elfwine means &#39;Elf-friend&#39; - Elendil.<br><br>So we can assume that Elfhelm is, indeed, named &#39;Elf-helm&#39;, or maybe &#39;Elf-protector&#39; - and likewise that Elfhild, who died in childbirth, has a name meaning something like &#39;Elf-battle&#39; (by the literal meaning of &#39;hild&#39;), or &#39;Elf-fighter&#39;.<br><br>Those are very unusual names in Rohan. There are no other names remotely like them in recorded Rohirric history, and they even have a common theme besides the &#39;elf&#39; - both are connected to war. A mysterious, high-ranking soldier who is very close to both the son and nephew of the king, who shares a naming theme with the king&#39;s sister? I think you&#39;d be hard-pressed <i>not</i> to assume they were relatives.<br><br>Elfhelm may well be the king&#39;s brother-in-law. Theoden was thirty years old when Theodred was born and Elfhild died, but that doesn&#39;t mean she was the same age. In fact, the only hint we have suggests she may have been younger: Morwen, wife of Thengel, was only 21 when they wed (though he was 38!). There is no indication of precisely when Theoden and Elfhild married, but in a world without reliable contraceptives, first children are often born pretty quickly. So Elfhild may well have been 25 or younger when she died.<br><br>If Elfhild was the elder sibling, and her parents followed the pattern of Rohirric and Gondorian nobility in spacing their children some five years apart, Elfhelm could have been 20 (or even younger) in 2978, at the birth of Prince Theodred. That would still make him some sixty years of age in the War of the Ring - which would fit his high-ranking position, even if it seems a little old. Instead of a brother, he could be a nephew (in a whole family of elf-centric names) - or simply an even younger brother (Theodwen was younger than Theoden by <i>fifteen</i> years - and had another sister older than him!).<br><br>And so, in his position as kinsman (but not in line for the throne), Elfhelm would have been given command of the Muster of Edoras - and responsibility for training both Theodred and Eomer in battle. And, when he discovered that young Eowyn was just as fervent as her brother about fighting the orcs who had killed her parents - and remembering that his own parents had given him the name invoking armour, while his sister had the proper fighting name - maybe he took <i>her</i> under his wing as well - teaching her the skills that would one day let a twenty-four-year-old woman of Middle-earth bring low the Witch-King of Angmar.<br><br>(This doesn&#39;t <i>technically</i> answer your question. As to where he got his name - there&#39;s no hint that Rohirrim adopted names later in life, or had any traditions of prophetic names. We could speculate about an incident in the lives of the Elf-kids&#39; parents, or their ancestors, or even a connection to Dol Amroth and their supposed elven bloodline - but it would be pure speculation)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I would assume that agents would become blocky upon entering the fic world, to fit in. And the easiest way to kill her sounds like it would be to go with something from the game&#39;s continuity: you could attack her with any of the many weapons or offensive potions in the game, set up a clever trap (preferably involving lava: it is, after all, the nether), push her off a cliff, or snap canon back and have the hostile mobs kill her. <br><br>You can look at the minecraft wiki for inspiration. :D</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t really think that&#39;s going to work. It doesn&#39;t really fit the PPC&#39;s methodology to defeat a Sue by giving one of its Agents an out-of-nowhere blast of new abilities to drastically overpower her. Besides, how would the Agent even be able to promote themselves to a Moderator? It&#39;s not as though they created the fic, which in this situation I suppose would be comparable to overseeing the server, and I severely doubt there are a plethora of Minecraft servers in which any player can promote themselves at any time, because if there were, nobody would ever be without Moderator powers.</p>

            <p>I checked the wiki&#39;s results from back to last year, and in the few times it addresses the player as &quot;Steve&quot;, it doesn&#39;t use the question mark. From my admittedly brief research, it looks as though Notch was once asked if the player character of Minecraft had a name, he replied &quot;Steve?&quot;, and someone with a surprisingly literal sense of humor began telling people that the question mark was a part of the player character&#39;s name. Notch acknowledged the joke at some point, but no one has ever actually given the player character any official name, with or without included punctuation, to the point that another game including him as a pop-culture reference just calls him &quot;Mr. Minecraft&quot;.</p>

            <p>It seems like the best option would be to treat each use of Steve in badfic as either a bit character, or a canon without charges for using the wrong name. <br>However, misspellings of the name will still cause mini&#39;s to appear, as long as the name was used previously.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d recommend either a mini-Creeper or a mini-Enderman. Mini-Creeper would be more iconic, but would have to be able to survive exploding.<br>Mini-Enderman would have much more comedic potential though, I think.</p>

            <p>They seemed to come to a consensus on <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=251191">mini-Creepers</a> at that point, with the caveat that it would be a modified version <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRbRhRnFOU0">similar to these</a>, so that just puffs up and emits steam rather than exploding. It makes sense, since Creepers are the most iconic creature in the game, minis usually have dramatically reduced versions of their namesake&#39;s power, and no Agent would want to bring a mini home only to find their adorable pet replaced by a smoking crater after they go on missions or inter-story shenanigans for a few hours. Still, though, the final mini choice should probably go with whichever mob would be funniest. I just thought it was a little strange that there have been two discussions a little longer than a month apart on this same topic, and yet nobody else has brought that up yet.</p>

            <p>I think we could get more milage out of a mini-Enderman... because their owners would have to not look at them. Also, they&#39;d be like two feet high and attack your knees if you wandered into the RC and looked at them, unless you were wearing a pumpkin. :D</p>

            <p>Well, knock around the board a bit (already accomplishing that, I see!) talk to all the shiny people, drag in your fandoms, etc. Wait a bit before asking for permission so people can get to know you first. Other protip: don&#39;t indiscriminately start up new threads, the page only has room for the top twenty or so, so if there&#39;s already a badfic thread, chuck any suckers you find on that instead of making a new one. Likewise, if there&#39;s already a thread about a certain movie, stay in that thread... you get the picture. Somebody&#39;s probably been over most of this already.<br><br>Have two bent forks, a sharpie, and a handful of toffees!</p>

            <p>(By the way, commas have a space after them)<br><br>At least I think I do.

            <p>The idea was the agents would use this for a mission into the Halo universe and it would never be closed as it would lead in to a basic box canyon* and at the end of the mission,the only pelican dropship** in the possession of HQ was needed for another mission. This link to Alpha Halo would be used by the agents to sit out the macrovirus epidemic as they,during the lockdown, to have a wine and cheese hour.<br><br>*The canyon is not blood gulch, prize if you get it.<br>**At the time.</p>

            <p>Would this be a flashback? And if so, why? What is it about macroviruses that cannot be just as easily dealt with using another creature or another cause for tunneling out of HQ?<br><br>Why exactly would the hole never be filled in? Just because the break in HQ leads into the bottom of a canyon doesn&#39;t mean that it couldn&#39;t pose a potential problem. What if something floods the canyon, or spores start coming in from the outside, or Haloverse animals come in through the hole while the Agents are away and lay eggs absolutely everywhere? If there was a hole through HQ to the outside, it&#39;s most probable that either it would be immediately sealed up and the people responsible sent somewhere that they couldn&#39;t go punching any more holes in reality, or that the Security Departments would set up a permanent door outpost at the spot where the hole appeared to ensure that nothing came in that wasn&#39;t supposed to.<br><br>Also, the reason why HQ can tunnel into so many continua and not have people mining into it or accidentally teleporting through the walls or releasing rapid animals into its hallways is because it has enormously powerful shields that keep HQ&#39;s hallways self-contained, with the added bonus of keeping said hallways connected to each other instead of needing to risk a section floating off into interdimensional space. Remember a few posts back, when Huinesoron mentioned that the Flowers put an extra layer of protection around HQ? Yeah, that&#39;s what the shields are. In order for someone to get in and out of HQ without using one of the designated doors or a plothole construct such as a portal generator, they would need to shut down or punch through an entire section of the shields, and the last times the shields were depowered, it <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/2006_Power_Cut">was not pretty</a> <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Blackout">by any definition</a>.</p>

            <p>I know, its sort of a flashback. The series I have come up with tells the story of Fox Norton and Eli Hunter from 1997 to 2015 and hopefully,when I ask for permission, it will be accepted. I don&#39;t know if you have played Halo PC,the canyon is Timberland and the gate way is not monitored as it should not be there, it is a byproduct of crashing a warthog into the wall of blue base.</p>

If there&#39;s a base built on top of the canyon that the hole would be placed in, that implies that people are there, or at least were there at some point, canons or not, and thus someone would probably notice if a rip in space suddenly shows up in that area, whether or not it was caused by large animals crashing into the walls.<br><br>Unrelated to that, the main result Google gives me for &quot;Fox Norton&quot; is a racehorse.

            <p>You&#39;re quite right, of course. Mention of the Weeds, though, brings to mind the various early stories - Architeuthis&#39; and Nenya-and-Rosie&#39;s, for instance - which represent HQ as having not only doors, but also significant lengths of wall (in N&amp;R&#39;s case, I always picture them as walking up to a gigantic castle).

            <p>A character can have quirks, but you don&#39;t get a character just by sticking quirks on a person-shaped template. I see &quot;character&quot; as essentially made up of actions and reactions: How does this character approach particular challenges? What experiences does he seek out, and what does he avoid? What is his general outlook on life? How does he speak; what words does he use or not use? How does he respond to certain types of stress? How does he represent himself with his appearance? Et cetera and so forth.<br><br>And, the most important question of all: WHY? People act and react in certain ways for reasons, based on their upbringing, belief system, past experiences, etc. Very little about people is random. This should apply to characters, and is what makes them more than just a collection of traits.<br><br>To clarify, it&#39;s okay to give a character a little trait here and there just because it happens to catch your eye at the time (this is why Nume has green glasses), but it should still grow an answer to the question of &quot;Why?&quot; eventually. In fact, it probably will whether you like it or not, so beware!<br><br>See also: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:PoorCynic">PoorCynic&#39;s Writing Workshops</a>, so far covering character creation and speech.

            <p>Mikelus is a very formal person, preferring proper speech and carefully planned wordplay to quick outbursts, though he also has a love of sarcasm if he can fit it into a situation. This mostly stems from his position in his clan. <br><br>Given he is, for lack of a better term, a practically exiled prince of his clan, a lot of his motivations and psychological issues are related to proving himself and living up to expectations. For example, he hates to leave objectives incomplete, and takes a very serious approach to any task he&#39;s assigned. This would likely put him at odds with a less serious partner, and would probably make her more of a friend to the Flowers. After all, an agent that actually focuses on the duty as much as possible and takes the horrible assignments without complaint sounds like a Flower&#39;s dream.<br><br>Over time, he would probably learn to open up to his partner and others, his more frigid persona chipping away as he works over some of his issues/goes completely insane.</p>

            <p>You know how people like to say that &quot;you can&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover&quot; right? I call partial bullshit on that. In fact in my years of sifting through fanfics, there&#39;s nothing that&#39;ll turn me off to a story quicker than a really sucky summary. Better yet, I think I&#39;m starting to recognize some warning signs in the summaries of badfic or badslash fanfics. <br><br><br>Here&#39;s some of the more obvious and general faux pas that I&#39;ve found in fanfic summaries:<br><br>Emoticons, particularly of this variety: X33333 XD :3 ;)<br>Mentionings of really OOC characters (Seriously why would you put that in a summary?)<br>&quot;OMG I SUCK AT SUMMARIES!!&quot; (Admittedly this one is more of a personal pet peeve)<br>Really REALLY bad typos or grammatical errors.<br><br>Any of these things or a combination of them are liable to send me running for the hills. They just don&#39;t give me a good impression of a story&#39;s potential or quality. Moreover prior experiences of ignoring these little &quot;nit-picks&quot; and clicking on the fic anyway have taught me that most of the time, my initial iffy impression was right on the mark.<br><br>What do you guys think? Am I just being really anal-retentive about this whole summaries thing? Got any of your own dont&#39;s that you want to add to this list? Better yet, what are some good things you look for in a fanfic summary?</p>

            <p>I have a few things to add:<br><br>Barfing up keywords (especially when like seven of them are synonyms.) It does not, in fact, tell me what the story is about. It might get you a couple extra clicks, but it&#39;s extremely annoying and I&#39;ve found it has a really high correlation with low-quality stories.<br><br>Begging for reviews in the summary: everyone wants their fanfic to be read. Most want it reviewed. Throwing in a cutesy &quot;plz r&amp;r!&quot; just tells me that you&#39;re an inexperienced author who isn&#39;t going to take my constructive criticism if I do take the pains to go through the story.</p>

            <p>Hedgehog&#39;s, too. If the summary asks a question like &quot;Will X achieve Y?&quot;, you can bet that nine times out of ten the answer is yes, thus making it unnecessary to read the story to find out.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if there are any 100% reliable tricks to writing a <i>good</i> summary, though making sure everything is SPaG&#39;d correctly is always a good start, of course. A general outline of the premise can work, but if you describe it too generally, it&#39;ll sound like all other stories with a similar plot. Quoting an interesting line or two from the story can be really effective—but if the story sucks, then your quotes will probably suck, too.<br><br>...

            <p>(...and wanted to ask highly philosophical and introspective questions on this Board.)<br><br>In my thoughts on Tenth Walkers and how one could potentially go about inserting someone into the Fellowship through supplantation or whatever, I came across the idea of what would happen if the OC in question volunteered to take the Ring, like Frodo did.<br><br>How would the Ring affect them? Or, rather, if you were the one who volunteered to take this magical artefact of known danger and power, how would it affect you?<br><br>I remember reading about the similarities between the One Ring and Plato&#39;s Ring, and how both could tempt people into immorality through its numerous powers and abilities (invisibility, longevity). According to the article, one has to know themselves to resist temptation -- to resist the lure of the One Ring. Such a thing is seen with Galadriel, Sam, and Tom Bombadil.<br><br>Do you think you, or your character, has a chance of resisting the Ring? Do you think you understand your limitations well enough to be able to defy the lure of immorality?<br><br>Heck, in a world where you were in Frodo&#39;s hobbit feet, would you be able to make his decision?</p>

            <p>Hm... I don&#39;t think I can give a true answer (the baker does not say his leaven is excellent... damn, it sounds better in Hebrew) but I&#39;d like to imagine that yes, I will resist its temptation. My desires in life are simple (tea and books/stories, basically) and I have less ambitions than most people I know. I also consciously follow a certain ethical code (behave as you want other people to behave/do not try to change the inevitable/do to others as you want them to do you) so I think I have good chances of ignoring the Ring&#39;s call.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to say I could resist it, but in reality, I have no idea.

            <p>I can only hope I&#39;d be smart/resistant enough to give away the ring as soon as I notice what power it holds, otherwise I&#39;d be on a one-way trip to Gollumville, as I am not barely resilient enough to resist such temptation as is presented by the one ring.</p>

            <p>I mean, assuming I had some idea of what I had and it wasn&#39;t just a case of &quot;Oooh, shiny.&quot; But even then, I don&#39;t normally wear rings except my wedding and engagement rings.

I&#39;d either want teleportation or the ability to always say the right thing at the right time.)<br><br>Realistically speaking, though, I just don&#39;t want a whole lot. I <i>do</i> occasionally wish people would just shut up and do what I tell them because god dammit I am right and it would be <i>so much easier my way</i>... but I have already made it a habit to curb those thoughts.

I have projects to do. Also, pretty sure mind-slaves give terribly boring, unhelpful reviews.<br><br>I dunno, am I overlooking something? It seems to me that all the ring-temptations we&#39;ve seen have been about &quot;ooh, shiny&quot; (Gollum) or power (Isildur, Galadriel, Boromir, Sam) or...

Nah, I&#39;d rather just stay home with my cat and write goofy stories, thanks. Maybe I could pawn it off for a year&#39;s rent, though, that would be sweet. Or, what about a ring that makes everyone use logic/common sense all the time <i>without</i> me having to force it? That&#39;d be cool.

I guess SOMEONE has to....&quot; But then it would be like, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t you touch that. You didn&#39;t want it before. It&#39;s my responsibility now, and no way am I letting you jerks cock it up.&quot; And then it would be like, &quot;I have to keep it FOREVER because I&#39;m the ONLY ONE who REALLY CARES about DOING THINGS RIGHT.&quot; And then I don&#39;t even know.

            <p>This question actually brings up a headcanon of mine that I had about the Ring waaaay back in the day. I always thought that half of the Ring&#39;s magnetism came from its innate ability to get inside its bearer&#39;s head...like, traveling with the Ring or even conversing with it is like talking to Hannibal Lector, you know? Yeah I know this is kind of a &quot;no shit&quot; observation but it would be a really interesting thing to base a fic on. <br><br>Though admittedly I don&#39;t see why you&#39;d need an OC to do this. Granted though, I don&#39;t think any OC of mine would be able to resist its lure for long. After all, the Ring does have an uncanny ability for bringing out the WORST in people, even the best people. I think one of the reasons why Frodo himself resisted the Ring for so long was because he didn&#39;t really have anything for the Ring to exploit. With Frodo it felt like the Ring needed to cultivate that bad seed itself by exploiting the cracks in Frodo&#39;s spirit left by the Morgul Blade. <br><br>TL;DR--I&#39;d think you&#39;d have to be really comfortable with who you are in addition to having a strong spirit to resist the Ring and its temptations.<br><br>On a side note, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d mind reading a Tenth Walker fic that tried to incorporate these kinds of questions in its work but what&#39;s the possibility of that happening? I mean, having a Tenth Walker is a huge violation of cannon right off the bat (one liable to get a fic PPC-ed). Sure, you can write off the initial misstep by saying the fic&#39;s a speculative AU but still... Tenth Walker fics have already set up a bad rapport with readers and agents alike with their terrible writing and lack of consideration for the rest of cannon. You&#39;d have to play it very smart in order to avoid justifying these icky expectations.<br><br>Long post &gt;.<br> </p>

            <p>This is partially due to the fact that I never really had any sort of idea what the One Ring does or why people would wage war for it, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it would be that much of an issue.<br>Its only powers, at least the only powers that have ever been apparent, are the ability to extend life while turning that life into some twisted alternate form, like a wraith or a whatever Gollum is, to make a single person turn invisible, and to make people desire it to the point that they will do anything to possess it again. Only the third one is in any way formidable, and you wouldn&#39;t be able to use it to save Arda or however someone would decide to help people using the Ring&#39;s power. Granted, I can see why the second power would motivate people to use it for less-than-innocent means, since an object that lets one person turn invisible for an extended period of time would have a sizable number of uses, many of them immoral, but that&#39;s a very small-scale power. You won&#39;t exactly be tempted to rend worlds in two and turn yourself into a lord of evil and destruction with only the power of invisibility and a convoluted form of immortality.<br><br>I mean, I know why Sauron wants it, since the One Ring contains a portion of his consciousness and he&#39;d need that to be able to use his full power again. Plus, he was exposed to the One Ring when it was first being made, since he was the one who forged it, so he probably would&#39;ve gotten the full brunt of the Want It Need It spell the Ring exudes, possibly far beyond the level it exuded when it was finished. I just don&#39;t know why anyone else would decide to use it to start going around and conquering. Is it because the piece of Sauron inside the Ring would possess them and enhance their innate desire to rule over others? Because that doesn&#39;t really match up with Boromir&#39;s feelings(and maybe Isildur&#39;s; I don&#39;t quite recall) that the Ring would somehow be able to be turned against Gondor&#39;s enemies, as though it could be used as a weapon or something. Maybe no one knows what the Ring is actually capable of, and is just running off of the logic that if someone as big and bad as Sauron wants it, it must be insanely powerful? I&#39;m grasping at straws here, if you can&#39;t tell.</p>

            <p>The Rings of Power were all designed to be magical in that they gave the users the strength and will to govern their peoples, and thus had a myriad of powers that are more subtle than immortality.<br><br>I consider the One Ring the original Horcrux. Sauron, like Voldemort, poured what essentially amounted to his soul into the Ring (the movies said his power, his cruelty, his will to dominate all life, etc). We saw what a Horcrux can do to people in the Potterverse -- it possessed Ginny and got her to unleash a Basilisk. It said nasty things to Ron until he deserted the Trio during their own Camping Trip from Hell. I imagine the Ring&#39;s influence to be way stronger than that, way more insidious, way more... irresistible.<br><br>As far as I know, the Ring&#39;s power is expressed in the books mostly as that voice that tells its bearer all the stuff they could have if they just claimed it as their own (and then attract the attention of all the enemies who come to nab the idiot who dared to contest Sauron&#39;s power). If it, perhaps, amplified the user&#39;s ability to lead or fight or cast spells, it might come in handy -- but with that power there&#39;s also that Horcrux-y bit where eventually it&#39;s not the bearer controlling the Ring, but vice versa.<br><br>Eh, I just rambled.</p>

            <p>Or is part of its power the ability to convince people that it&#39;s capable of doing things that it would never be able to do? If the latter&#39;s the case, it would actually be pretty insidious. &quot;Why do I want this ring so much?&quot; asks a random shmuck who has shown no resilience to the magic coursing through Sauron&#39;s soul jar. &quot;I have to want it for <i>some</i> reason. Well, it said it would give me the power to shape the minds of others and the power to resurrect the dead, so that&#39;s probably why. It hasn&#39;t given me that power <i>yet</i>, but I know it will. If it wouldn&#39;t, well, I wouldn&#39;t have this unnatural longing to keep it with me, and I know I&#39;m not the sort of person who carries jewelery around for no reason.&quot; It&#39;d be the same sort of principle by which people convince themselves that they love their jobs because if they didn&#39;t, there would be literally no reason for them to be working where they are, compounded by the One Ring&#39;s ambient desire spells. Pretty sneaky, Sauron.</p>

            <p>... I&#39;d be surprised if the One Ring couldn&#39;t deliver as well.<br><br>It would be too much to say the Ring was sentient, but it certainly has a will, specifically Sauron&#39;s will.  It also holds a good chunk of Sauron&#39;s power, and Sauron was a Maia -- a fallen Maia, but Maia none the less.<br><br>We never really find out in the trilogy what a Maia is capable of if s/he is motivated.  The times Gandalf cuts loose, it&#39;s either off-page (most of the Balrog fight) or something the mortal observers aren&#39;t capable of seeing.  &quot;Saruman, your staff is broken&quot; -- there has to be more going on there than snapping a stick, but <em>we</em> don&#39;t see it.  But going back to the Silmarillion, Melian is able to keep Morgoth from scrying through the magical barrier she erects around Doriath, which argues for Maia having a great deal of power to affect the world.<br><br>Getting back to the original question, I think I&#39;d be in trouble if I held the Ring.  I had a lot of self-image issues as a child/teen, and it&#39;s something I still have to watch for today.  If the Ring can&#39;t come up with a way to manipulate that, give it back to Sauron already, we&#39;ve been worrying for no reason.</p>

            <p>Only that it will help you reach your goals until it thinks Sauron is getting close. Then it leaves you. Much like how Isildur was killed when using the ring to escape. The ring found it&#39;s avenue of escape, so it go with it.<br><br>If by making you the CEO of Microsoft gets it closer to Sauron, it will do its best to help you, with a few &#39;accidents&#39; here and there it helps to concoct.

            <p>(No ideas on how I ended up with the thing - I suspect it involves Frodo getting a seriously bad cold)<br><br>I think, like Gandalf, the Ring would tempt me with the power to do good - to make things better for, well, everyone. Precisely what it would offer would depend on its actual abilities, but maybe the ability to just... convince people to stop doing bad things. That can&#39;t be wrong, can it? I mean, sure, you&#39;d have to twist them a little on the way - but in a good way!<br><br>But there&#39;s all those people who just don&#39;t <i>understand</i>, who keep wanting to attack me, to hurt all the people I helped. And I&#39;ve got this Ring...<br><br>Of course, I don&#39;t imagine I&#39;d actually <i>get</i> that far. I rather suspect I&#39;d fall foul of the first Nazgul to hunt me down. But you didn&#39;t ask about chances of success. ;)<br><br>About &#39;know thyself&#39; - I&#39;m not so sure. Remember, Gandalf is a demigod, and he didn&#39;t want to go anywhere near the thing. Of the three &#39;resisters&#39; you mentioned, only Bombadil truly resisted - and I think that was because of who (or rather, what) he is. A nature spirit, tied to a specific feature of the landscape, wouldn&#39;t be affected in any way by bottled demigodly power.<br><br>Galadriel, of course, nearly <i>didn&#39;t</i> resist - she was on the verge of accepting (and had thought long and hard about what she&#39;d do - in fact, the way she describes it sounds more like a fond daydream or fantasy). Ultimately, yes, it was a form of self-knowledge that gave her that resistance - the knowledge that the time of the Eldar was past, and that it was time for her to &#39;diminish, and go into the West&#39;... even if the West wouldn&#39;t have her (&#39;But if of ships I now should sing/What ship would come for me?&#39;).<br><br>And Sam? I like to image Sam resisted because, of all the people who encountered the Ring, he&#39;s the only one who actually knows what hard work (as opposed to fighting) feels like. So the promise of &#39;I can do all this effortlessly&#39; would be met with &#39;There&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch (as my old Gaffer used to say)&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and powerful. Will you not take the Ring?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No!&quot; cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. &quot;With that power I should have power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly.&quot; His eyes flashed and his face was lit by a fire within. &quot;Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark Lord himself. Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity, pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good. Do not tempt me! I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too great for my strength. I shall have such need of it. Great perils lie before me.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s rather more abrupt in the film; I&#39;d forgotten the original. Still, Gandalf thought its strength would allow him to do some kind of good.<br><br>As to what the Ring - or rather, the Rings - do... this will need a Netilardo post, I think, but just off the top of my head:<br><br>There are three &#39;kinds&#39; of Ring. The Seven and the Nine were made pretty much identically, by Sauron and the Eldar. The Three were made solely by the Eldar, and the One by Sauron alone. Still, they seem to share some attributes:<br><br>-The Sixteen and the One can shift Men (and the related Hobbits) into the spirit world, along with their clothes. We don&#39;t know what effect they have on Elves, though they do not turn dwarves invisible. Nor do we know whether the Three can turn anyone invisible, though we can say for sure they can&#39;t do it to elves. We <i>do</i> know that none of them can make a Maia invisible - since both Sauron with the One, and Gandalf with Narya, were visible.<br><br>-All the Rings had the power to halt decay. In the case of the Three, this was applied to whatever the bearer chose - Gandalf used Narya on all of Middle-earth, Galadriel and Nenya sustained Lorien. In the Sixteen and the One, at least as worn by Men (and Hobbits), it led to unnatural extension of life - and, at least with the Nine, becoming eventually a wraith. (Gandalf <i>says</i> the One would do the same thing, but no-one has ever tested the idea)<br><br>-When borne by a dwarf, the Sixteen had the power to accumulate gold to a horde, somehow. They <i>didn&#39;t</i> grant extended life, since the Ring of Thror was passed down through the line of kings over thousands of years, from Durin III.<br><br>-&quot;Those who used the Nine Rings became mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old. They obtained glory and great wealth...&quot; That suggests that building wealth was an intrinsic property of the Sixteen - and maybe of the One, too: look how rich Bilbo became during his first few months as Ringbearer. But, of course, they need gold to accumulate gold.<br><br>-The quote above suggests that the Rings could also be used to enact &#39;sorcery&#39; - though what exactly that means in Middle-earth is unclear. And this is the crux of the matter - aside from domination of the other Rings (which would require great strength of will; Gandalf could have done it, and turned the Nazgul against Sauron), and the paltry trick of invisibility - oh, and the money - the power of the Rings lay in sorcery. Find a description of a non-Maia, non-Elf using magic, and you&#39;ll have a guess as to what the One could do if wielded properly.<br><br>hS<br><br>-The One is described to &#39;govern&#39; and &#39;rule&#39; the other Rings, even the Three which Sauron had no part in making - because, presumably, they all used his craft.<br></p>

            <p>any ideas on what the lesser rings (the essays in ringcraft) could do?

By that measure, there are definitely sociopathic elves: off the top of my head, Feanor, Curufin (at minimum - I&#39;d be tempted to count most or all of the Sons of Feanor), Eol, and Maeglin all count.

            <p>The fact that they were essays in ringcraft implies (duh) that they hadn&#39;t yet achieved the primary effect, <i>or</i> that they had an unwanted side-effect. I see two options:<br><br>1/ The longevity/sustaining effect (longevity in Men, environmental sustaining in Eldar and other immortals) wasn&#39;t yet in there. That means, depending on the time of making, they could have any combination of invisibility, wealth-generation, and sorcery.<br><br>2/ The sustaining was in there, but actually drained the user&#39;s life to do it. That would require adding a &#39;don&#39;t let the wearer&#39;s <i>fea</i> (soul) leave&#39; function - which is fine for an elf, but causes rather awkward side-effects in mortals.<br><br>Actually, I rather like that second idea. The Rings cause invisibility - shifting the user entirely into the realm of spirits, not bodies. To a Valinorian Elda - and the leaders of Eregion were Noldor - they burn bright in both worlds, but you can imagine a shifting of viewpoint or power-focus. In the unseen realm, they would be able to view the &#39;spirit&#39; of a location, and influence it accordingly.<br><br>For anyone who <i>hadn&#39;t</i> been to Valinor, they would find themselves shifted almost entirely to the unseen: invisibility. There they would be able to feel people&#39;s thoughts to some extent (since they would be actually looking at their souls), and would probably be able to work &#39;magic&#39; of some kind - though what, exactly, I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>The Rings apply their sustaining power to the body that wears it, in order to hold the <i>fea</i> in place - but the more a mortal <i>uses</i> a Ring, the more time their body spends in the unseen, and the less chance the Ring has to work on it. Thus the body fades away through lack of sustaining, while the <i>fea</i> is not yet free to leave, because the body never actually <i>died</i>.<br><br>(The Three, being made <i>after</i> Sauron left, would incorporate the latest innovation: they <i>don&#39;t</i> shift you into the unseen, but rather allow you to influence it while in the visible world. That explains how Elrond, Cirdan, and Gil-Galad can all use them without being invisible)<br><br>So there&#39;s a few options for what a lesser ring would do:<br><br>-Give you power, but drain your life while you use it, eventually leading to death.<br>-Give you wealth and magic, but drain everything <i>around</i> you.<br>-Give you power, but (if you weren&#39;t an Exile) make you invisible. - without the sustaining effect.<br>-... anything else, really. This is all theory. ;)<br><br>As to how corrupting they would be... while power corrupts, the main corrupting effect of the Rings (excluding the One) lies in their link <i>to</i> the One. The Master Ring - and its Master - rules over the others, and corrupts their users. It&#39;s not an intrinsic property of the rings.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That actually sounds like something super cool. Maybe he wields a lesser Ring which did option two, but since he was an elf, it didn&#39;t have that big of an effect.<br><br>However, the corruption remains. I wonder exactly how one like Sauron would go about corrupting an elf. </p>

            <p>I mean, look at his name! But Elrond will have the foresight to kick me out first, as I have a cohort of orcs weaving spidersilk for clothing.

            <p>In both the book and the film (and, for that matter, the Bakshi movie), I get the distinct impression that Frodo was being driven into taking on the Quest. This is arguably clearest in the book, where <i>Bilbo</i> is the first person to volunteer - only for Elrond(?) to tell him that no, his part&#39;s over, the Ring has passed to another. It&#39;s all he can do to keep from giving Frodo a significant look.<br><br>So that&#39;s a sort of answer to your last question: Frodo didn&#39;t really make a decision. Or rather, he did, but pointlessly: he would have ended up carrying the thing one way or the other.<br><br>I&#39;ll come back to the rest of it when I get a chance; no time now, but the question is very interesting.<br><br>hS</p>
