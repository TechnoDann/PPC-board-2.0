            <p>Hellos everyone!<br><br>I&#39;m Niko. I&#39;m new!  I&#39;ve been a silent follower of the PPC since... oh, 2005 or so?  I&#39;m not sure exactly, I just know that it&#39;s been long enough that I can&#39;t even remember how I found it to begin with.  I binge-read the first series before I even knew that binge-reading had a name, and I may or may not have cried a bit when I got to the last chapter and realized that there were no more.  I&#39;ve read various PPC (and Official Fanfiction University) fic&#39;s over the years, and just recently I came across a new one called PPC:  Driftwood, which is how I found out about this board.  I&#39;m pretty excited to see that there&#39;s a wiki and an active message board! <br><br>I have quite a few fandoms- it would take me a while to list them all, but I think my biggest are Lord of the Rings, the Marvel universe, and Harry Potter.  I also dabble in Doctor Who, The Percy Jackson universe, The Hunger Games, as well as lots of other fantasy series. <br><br>So for more about me!  I&#39;m a girl, and I just recently graduated from University with a degree in Political Science and a minor in History.  I live in the United States, close-ish to Washington DC.  In my free time that&#39;s not taken up with wedding planning, I like to read, RP, or cook.  <br><br>I think that&#39;s about it!<br><br> </p>

            <p>I would highly recommend that you read the Hunger Games books.  They&#39;re an easy read (although take that with a grain of salt, coming from me, I&#39;m a voracious reader) and, as with every book adapted into a movie, so much better than the movie.  <br><br>I do like a lot of anime as well.  There&#39;s a big anime convention in Baltimore (which is about an hour north of DC, for those who don&#39;t know) and I&#39;ve been almost every year for the past ten years. <sup>_^</sup> Sailor Moon will always be my one of my favorites - it&#39;s the first anime I watched, and the first thing that really introduced me into fandoms.  I love a bunch of other series, too- the Claymore manga is awesome, and I just started watching Shingeki no Kyojin.<br><br>I haven&#39;t really decided if I&#39;m going to law school or not yet.  Sometimes I think I&#39;d like to, but I don&#39;t want to take out student loans to pay for it.  Plus, every one I know who went to law school says don&#39;t go to law school.  I definitely don&#39;t want to be a politician, though.  Politics can get way nasty, and I know I couldn&#39;t stand that.  <br><br>Thanks for the welcome and the snowglobe!  I used to collect them when I was little. =)</p>

            <p>It seems that unless you have an encyclopedic knowledge of the area of law you want to get into (or are willing to take the time to <i>get</i> said encyclopedic knowledge), you&#39;ll have a hard time looking for and finding a job.<br><br>That said, though, don&#39;t let the chorus stop you if you truly have a passion for law; hard does not equal impossible.<br><br>But enough of Real Life Serious Business; back to fandom!<br><br>So, you&#39;ve also gotten into Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyoujin), eh?

            <p>I am pretty good when it comes to Constitutional Law, actually. I sailed through those classes.  If I do go to law school, that&#39;s definitely an area of law I would get in to.  From what I understand, though, it&#39;s super hard to find a job in the law field.  I have a cousin who graduated from law school a few years back; she&#39;s got a mortgage&#39;s worth of student loans and she spent over a year clerking for a judge after passing the bar because she couldn&#39;t find a job.  <br><br>Attack on Titan is really good!  I would definitely recommend it to any anime fans to watch.  I went to an anime convention about a year ago, and there were lots of people cosplaying AoT characters, and there were a couple of AoT AMV&#39;s in the AMV contest as well.  Everyone was raving about it so I figured I should give it a try, and I was glad I did.  <br><br>I don&#39;t watch Fairy Tail, but I&#39;ve heard good things about it, so I&#39;ve added it to my (rather extensive) list of things to watch when I have time.<br><br>I don&#39;t really watch Pokemon anymore- I used to when I was younger, but I do still play the games on occasion. I don&#39;t watch Bakugan, either.  Sorry! </p>

            <p>*glomped* I don&#39;t have a particular time period of history that I like more than others. I&#39;ve taken a bunch of history classes ranging in topics from Bronze Age Greece, to Medieval and Renaissance England, to more more modern history like World War Two, and I&#39;ve enjoyed them all.  If I had to pick, though, I&#39;d say my Medieval and Renaissance England and Ancient Greek history classes were probably my favorite, but that&#39;s because they were both study abroad classes. =)  <br><br>What got me into political science was when I started at my University from a Community College. I needed to declare a major, and in looking through a course catalog all the political science courses sounded interesting. It also didn&#39;t require any more math classes, which I&#39;m horrible at- so it ended up being a really easy choice.  <br><br>The wedding planning is mine!  I&#39;m excited for it, even though my fiancee and I are both broke from paying for school that the wedding&#39;s not for another two years.  And thanks for the food coloring!  I love baking cakes and making them pretty colors. </p>

            <p>I asked because I came across <a href="http://strngbedfellows.livejournal.com/1130.html">this</a> through a link on the PPC TV Tropes page (hey, sometimes I get bored). The &quot;mission&quot; dates back to 2008 and contains a lot of things that the PPC doesn&#39;t actually do, including having two canonical characters as agents and just killing Sues for the sake of Sue-killing. The only mention I could find on the wiki to either the authors or their similarly-named agents was one reference talking about their sporking of the Rose Potter series.<br><br>Is this a pair of writers who just adopted the PPC for their own purposes, or did I miss something in my fact-checking?</p>

            <p>They were listed by Miss Cam between February and December 2005, according to the Wayback Machine. Miss Cam was one of the original three Permission Givers; being listed by her is, pretty much, acknowledgement that they have Permission. The fact that we don&#39;t like what they did with it is pretty much irrelevant to that question. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Mervin did the Twilight sporkings, and recently finished (or is still finishing extra material?) Breaking Dawn. Mrs. Hyde tackled Midnight Sun, and regrets it. They (or Mervin? I&#39;m not sure Hyde is a mod) run a sporking community on Livejournal called das_sporking, which is full of contributing sporkers doing fanfic, published fiction, 50 Shades of Grey, and even some movies and an anime. Their sporking method is extensive analysis (often involving images, gifs, and canon/original character guest sporkers), which is one main reason why they&#39;re popular; the other main reason is that they also tend to be funny, and often provide a different analytical perspective than other sporkers do. That last bit, apparently, is a main draw for the Twilight and 50 Shades sporkings.<br><br>They also write fanfic (I highly recommend &quot;The Wedding Crashers&quot;). And spitefics. Many spitefics. And as you can probably tell, I&#39;ve become a fan.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>First of all, thank you based Hussie for making this the best flash ever. Music, art style, action, everything!<br><br><br>OK, let&#39;s make a casualty list to keep track of everything that happened. Let me know if I forgot anyone.<br><br><u>Trolls</u><br><br>The Condesce: battleship destroyed. Currently choking Aranea to death. <br><br>Aranea: getting choked to death by the Condesce.<br><br>Karkat: lava death. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much hope for him.<br><br>Kanaya: disintegrated by the Condesce&#39;s psionic beam attack. Not much hope for her either.<br><br>Terezi: part of the landscape now. Heavily injured. Potentially still alive because of the lack of &quot;kill cam&quot;.<br><br>Gamzee: suffering from split personality disorder (watch the chainsaw part carefully). I&#39;d be very surprised if he died since his hero clock was not displayed. Also, unkillable clown gig, etc, etc. <br><br><br><u>Beta Kids</u><br><br>John: WHAT A BOSS. Alive and (mostly) unharmed after beating the tar out of Caliborn. <i>Zap</i>ped out of the way shortly afterwards. Injuries he might have suffered will most likely be healed by God Tier powers.<br><br>Dave: heroic death at the hands of Bec Noir and powered-up PM while trying to recover Jade&#39;s body. <b>TIME PLAYER IS DEAD</b><br><br>Jade: chilling with Calliope in the Oubliette. Note that her body fell on her Quest Bed during the strife. Could be see another resurrection taking place? <br><br>Rose: teleported away by Roxy to safety. Stabbed through the chest by the 2 X 3 dent but since she wasn&#39;t killed on the spot doing something heroic (and subsequently retreated), God Tier auto-rez will fix that quite soon. <br><br><br><u>Alpha Kids</u><br><br>Jane: just death at the hands of Aranea. Part of a grim brochette with Jake.<br><br>Dirk: flying through space towards the Alpha session, ETA unknown.<br><br>Jake: heroic death while trying to protect Jane. Other component of the grim brochette.<br><br>Roxy: awakened Void powers enabled her to teleport Rose and herself away from the site of the Mega-Strife.<br><br><br><u>Cherubs</u><br><br>Caliborn: Alive, cape ripped, lying on the ground surrounded by little plastic horses, and got completely <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaGKCtA7qGs">rekt</a> by John. <br><br>Calliope: chilling with Jade in the Oubliette. <br><br><br><u>Planets</u><br><br>LOLAR and LOFAF: smashed together by sheer psychic might during the duel between Aranea and the Condesce.<br><br>LOHAC and LOCAH: same fate. Scratch construct potentially destroyed, if it was reusable at all. <br><br><br><u>Carapacians</u><br><br>Mayor: on LOHAC during the planetary collision. Fate unknown.<br><br>PM: protected Jade&#39;s corpse with Bec Noir.<br><br>Jack (Bec) Noir, Alpha: protected Jade&#39;s corpse with PM.<br><br>Jack Noir, Beta: flying through space towards the Beta session. ETA unknown. <br><br><br><u>Others</u><br><br>Dad Crocker: safe on Derse on the far side of the Medium.<br><br><br><br>So... thoughts? Could this be a doomed timeline we&#39;re seeing?</p>

            <p>Spoilers, naturally. <br><br><br>After re-watching the flash multiple times, I&#39;d like to correct my previous post:<br><br>Terezi: ALIVE. After getting smooshed into the landscape she&#39;s seen pulling the cane sword out of her chest. <br><br>It&#39;s Jack Noir BETA who defends Jade, not Alpha. <br><br><br>Main point: <u>I am 100% convinced this is a doomed timeline.</u>. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=008453">Remember this conversation?</a> The fact that pretty much everyone died in a spectacular fashion is further proof. Apologies for the incoming paragraphs, this is mostly stuff coming off the top of my head...<br><br><br>Question: who is going to fix the timeline? Dave is dead and not coming back. The Maid of Life is down, so no possibility of resurrection using her powers. None of the Mega-Strife survivors can do Time stuff with their aspects... save for one. Again: who will fix the timeline?<br><br>Answer: John. He&#39;s become unstuck from the narrative thanks to Lord English&#39;s treasure and has gained the power to revisit prior events and to intervene. Only he can fix this.<br><br><br>Question: how will he know what to do?<br><br>Answer: he will eventually regroup with the Mega-Strife survivors (Rose, Roxy, Dirk) and formulate a plan to stop Aranea&#39;s intervention. John will have to learn how to execute a precision <i>Zap</i> before he can do it, though. <br><br><br>Question: what needs to change?<br><br>Answer: the current situation was caused by Aranea using her Light powers to jump-start Jake&#39;s Hope powers. John needs to stop that from happening. <br><br><br>Speculation: John will see Aranea wearing the Ring of Life and take it from her. This will prevent the doomed timeline from happening. Not only is this the only way to permanently put an end to the Sylph of Light&#39;s meddling, John will be able to give it to Calliope should they ever meet up.<br><br>Bonus: John might be able to spring Dad Crocker from the Dersian VIP suite while he&#39;s at it. </p>

            <p>This may be my favorite mission ever now.<br><br>Like, this trollfic was almost custom-made to be sporked.  There are just so many random parts, and yet, they&#39;re <i>different</i> enough that they make this mission unique.  (Count Dracula?  Ancient Rome?  Godzilla?  Duuuuuude.)<br><br>I love all the creative little things you got to do with the wolf-everything.  Wolf disguises, Wolf minis, Wolf attack, Wolf control by Dracula, I don&#39;t know why I keep capitalizing Wolf, but I&#39;m not going to stop now, my zoo is supposed to finally get some Wolves around the end of next year.  Excellent choices for the minis on both new counts.  I had never heard of the Capitoline Wolf before (our world isn&#39;t fictional, so I&#39;m not much interested in it), but I like it, as it kind of has links to both actual Roman history and Roman legend.  I also like that the mini-Capitolines have a metallic sheen to their fur, as reference to the statue.<br><br>I also like mini-Children of the Night for <i>Dracula</i>.  I was imagining misspelled rats myself; I think they get mentioned more often than wolves or bats in the novel, but they&#39;re also more closely associated with Renfield.  Wolves are singularly the Count&#39;s deal, and I love that you named them with a phrase Dracula himself used.<br><br>The scene at the end was stupendous.  I love how you simultaneously treated it seriously and comically, with knocking out Edward to stop the Meyer spirit (Oh Gan, the implications) and Dracula&#39;s very dangerous presence in the final stage, vs. the troll&#39;s reaction to Selene&#39;s presence and hilarious backfiring of holding up a sword in the presence of lightning-wielders.<br><br>Out of curiosity, how did Middle-earth even facotr in to this?  You said it did at the beginning, but I didn&#39;t catch anything from it.  Also, Ancient Rome, therefore<br><br><i>The ground shook.  The brown-haired woman frowned, stopped chewing and listened.<br><br>A roar sounded—terribly nearby, and terribly familiar.  &quot;What kind of animal makes that clichй stock roar sound?&quot; Acacia wondered.  She put down the chicken leg and moved to a window.<br><br>Glancing left and right down the path outside, she saw some of her neighbors running around, screaming.  But people were running from all directions, to all directions, so it hardly communicated much in the way of information.  Then she looked up.<br><br>&quot;Oh,&quot; Acacia said.  &quot;Not a stock sound—not when he first made it, anyway.&quot;<br><br>She moved to a trunk, ignoring the somebody else&#39;s problem field with practice.  She opened it and fished out the camera her old partner had insisted on giving her; Jay would never forgive her if Acacia didn&#39;t get a picture of this.<br><br>She leaned out her door and took a picture of Godzilla towering over the tiny structures of Ancient Rome.  Then she snapped another; if that bulletin board of unlikely pictures was still in the Cafeteria, this could easily compete with any new stuff contemporary agents were posting.<br><br>The daikaiju unleashed a blast of weirdly-colored flame at something at ground level.  Moments later, Acacia watched humanoid figure covered in slight distortions riding out of town on a . . . Patronus?<br><br>&quot;Ugh.  I guess this was bound to happen eventually.  I suppose I should—Aha!&quot;  A massive blue portal had flashed through the sky.  When it ended, Godzilla was gone.<br><br>&quot;Nice.  Someone&#39;s already here.&quot;  Acacia looked again at the deep red flames scorching the trees near town.  &quot;Say.  I seem to recall something about Godzilla&#39;s fire being radioactive . . .&quot;  She grimaced, but sat back down and continued eating dinner.  &quot;Well, I&#39;m sure the modern PPC agent has the sense to get some of those pills for radiation for the townspeople.&quot;<br><br>Several hours later, Acacia found herself beginning to itch at her arms.  &quot;Or, I can always portal to Medical and do it myself.&quot;</i><br><br>This sentence only exists to double-check the closing italics tag.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sure dragging Acy into things must have crossed my mind - but since I can&#39;t remember it doing so, the credit goes entirely to you. <sup>-<sup><br><br>Thanks</sup></sup> for the review! I had great fun writing this mission (can you tell?), so it&#39;s nice to know it was fun to read, too.<br><br>As to Middle-earth - in Chapter 8 they reach Tutankhamen&#39;s mines, only to find they&#39;re closed because of a talking balrog. Then, after Kelly has been possessed by Athena, they discover Hades has been manipulating them, so Shrek sacrifices himself to save Kelly so the rest of them can get to Mordor. Obviously, on the way they have to fight Thor and &#39;the inedible Hulks&#39;, who have been turned evil by Hades (they win), and then defeat Sauron at Evil Chess, but naturally he sends his army to fight them anyway. Um, then Hercules joins the side of good, and Sauron kills Elkus, but that makes Kelly angry enough to kill Sauron (and rescue Elkus), and that&#39;s where it ends.<br><br>So yeah, there <i>is</i> some LotR, but I think the categories were chosen simply for what was most popular. <i>Twilight</i>, in particular, is way minor.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s pretty interesting to read about agents dealing with a non-human, non-sapient disguise choice. That mini wolf pack/army is going to be multiple hand(paw?)fuls, I can tell that much. (By the way, I have to ask; the snow wolves don&#39;t look like living snow sculptures of wolves, do they? Cause I can see multiple problems with that.)</p>

            <p>Given the large number of canonical things in the fic (seriously, they go after an ogre next, and it turns out to be Shrek), I wasn&#39;t sure if &#39;snow wolf&#39; was an actual creature somewhere. So I guess that decision goes to whoever uses the pack first? They&#39;re free-to-use now, after all. (They do have one canon influence from my side - I think they ended up talking like Poledra from the Eddings books. &#39;One finds this very interesting&#39; and the like)<br><br>And yeah, playing with the disguises was heaps of fun.

            <p>Nah, it&#39;s a combination of a few things. The short targets are a big help (though mission #2 was six chapters of a 140k story), but there&#39;s also the fact that I&#39;m trying to keep the <i>missions</i> under 6k. That means if there&#39;s something that looks like it&#39;d take a long time to deal with, I just skip it (again, see mission #2). I&#39;m also not bothering to nitpick every charge - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for the storytelling, honestly.<br><br>And then there&#39;s... well, the fact that I actually sit down and write. ;) It really works wonders.

            <p>First up, the Pack. It&#39;ll be revealed in the beginning of the next mission that the entire Pack has been set loose in the Miss Cam Courtyard, under the leadership of roman.

I&#39;ve finally read <i>Dracula</i> and taken note of what powers she should and shouldn&#39;t have, and weaknesses too.

            <p>What a journey! It took me eight hours to read this, and I feel I should read it again to appreciate all details. That’s a good thing. I don’t expect to understand nearly 100 pages of foreign language on first read, and I want to read it again. But I don’t have much time, and although positive feedback is important, there are more important things to say.<br><br>Rasheeda should have her C-CAD checked. Apparently it doesn’t always succeed in stabilizing the agents in third person past tense (in Acts 2+3):<br><br><i> “The Stu’s off to school with the rest of the gang,” she said, taking the steak and tearing off a piece with</i> my <i>teeth.</i><br><br><i>The glowing Alpha Male had resumed his human form, and</i> attempt <i>to blow the group up with a <b>Pea Turret</b> — a super-deformed, pea-green Turret that was somehow explosive.</i> I <i>opened up a portal and rushed us through, shutting it just as the Pea Turret exploded.</i><br><br><i>Rashida facepalmed at this supposed Reveal. “They should’ve prepared for something like this if they’d known that Stratogale was the daughter of Splashdown and Apogee,”</i> I <i>muttered.</i><br><br><i>Rashida was too groggy to react to Falchion’s pronouncing the parentheses, but she sat bolt upright the moment</i> I <i>heard the author’s Tumblr username.</i><br><br>Did Falchion get a temporary genderbend?<br>She <i>hesitated, trying to comprehend the meaning of this statement. “Huh,”</i> she <i>said finally. “You have a point there. If the author has interest in feet and tickling, then logically</i> I <i>also have an interest in feet and tickling. Guess that explains why</i> I <i>taped those scenes earlier.”</i><br>Or is this Rasheeda speaking and “I” should be “you”?<br><br><br>Is there a word missing in Acts 4+5:<br><i>A moment later, she scrambled for cover, with the mini with one hand and dragging her partner behind her with the other.</i><br><br>Concerning the mini Jurasic park: As far as I know, there can be only one mini of any name. If the same misspelling is found in another fic, then the mini has been abducted from its home, and the Sue or wraith can be charged for this (there are multiple examples of this happening). Jurasic park <b>is</b> Caddy-shack&#39;s Jurasic park and should be sent back to Cadmar. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Ah, thanks for letting me know about the POV errors! I guess they may have been left over from an earlier draft in which everything was in script fic, as I had to go back over it when Des recommended against it. All the mentioned errors have been fixed!<br><br>As for Cadmar&#39;s mini, I checked the source fic and it was spelled &quot;Jurassic park&quot; with a double S. So yeah, looks like I did indeed accidentally steal a mini-T. rex! Whoops! I&#39;ll return the poor thing tomorrow after I get some sleep.<br><br>Regarding the Galeforces&#39; integration, I intended to have them move to and protect another city, while still maintaining correspondence with the Parrs in a way that wouldn&#39;t break canon (letters, etc.). They&#39;d essentially be heroes of another story, to use the term, and their messages wouldn&#39;t be shown onscreen in a canon production (the sequel that&#39;s in the works, for example). This was also why I changed their Super names/powers, since if the dead Supers get fleshed out in canon then the Galeforces as defined in the original fic wouldn&#39;t make sense anymore.</p>

            <p>And as promised, here&#39;s Sarah&#39;s bio for your appraisal! Constructive critique is much appreciated as usual :)<br>For reference for her appearance and such, her profile from the fic she was created for can be found <a href="http://fav.me/d3jcwwq">here</a>.<br><br>----------<br><br>Name: Sarah Katherine Squall<br>Aliases: “Stratogale”<br>Species: Human (Super)<br>Home Continuum: The Incredibles<br>Department: Floaters<br>Age: 16<br>Lust Object/s: TBA<br>Favorite characters: TBA<br><br><b>Appearance</b><br>Being from the only Pixar continuum with humans as the main characters, Sarah is the first truly human agent in RC #227. She’s 5’2”, 110 pounds, lean but quite athletic with wide shoulders and well-defined upper body musculature. Her hair is jet-black and styled in a ponytail, and her eyes are Egyptian blue. Her current Supersuit is now 100% cape-free (see the History section below), with a dark blue torso region and a silvery “strap” across her chest, which frames a purple circle at the center which contains the logo of her family, the Galeforces (from her homefic, see the History section again). Her gloves, boots, and belt are also silver, and her uniform sleeves and pants are the same purple as her insignia. Instead of a cape, she has red and blue wing vanes on her shoulders and boots that help her maneuver in flight and can be folded away to avoid snagging (especially now that PPC hammerspace technology is involved). Her casual gear is much more cosmopolitan, with a red-orange shirt with brown sleeves, blue jeans, and white sneakers with red and blue accents; she also wears a maroon long-sleeved T-shirt with a silver eagle decal on the front on occasion.<br><br><b>Powers</b><br>Being one possible definition of the canonical bit character, Stratogale (see the History section), Sarah has three superhuman powers, all of which are known to have been possessed by Stratogale in canon.<br>First, Sarah is capable of flight, the mechanics of which aren’t specified in canon but presumably similar to Superman and other comics heroes (which isn’t particularly surprising, considering that her home continuum is an homage to superhero comics in general). While not capable of supersonic flight, she can fly at least as fast as a commercial airliner, and is capable of withstanding the G-forces faced by most fighter jet pilots by extension. She is not very maneuverable when airborne, however, and while more agile than other characters when both grounded and hovering, she is terrible at cornering when flying at top speed.<br>Second, Sarah’s status as an interpretation of Stratogale has given her super-strength comparable to Mr. Incredible. Because of the variance in ability manifestation demonstrated in her homefic, however, Sarah’s strength works somewhat differently from the canonical Super. Her author’s headcanon for her strength is as follows: in contrast to Bob’s raw muscle power, Sarah relies on kinetic force to back up her blows. While she needs to move her attacking appendage at a significant velocity and is normally as strong as an average human (albeit capable of lifting her own weight from a standing start), when she does put inertia to use, the momentum is boosted exponentially. The forward thrust from her fist going at 20 mph is converted by the properties of her ability to a proportional multiplication of the resultant force, allowing her to punch through plate iron after a few good rounds. This super-strength variant meshes well with her flight ability, as her increased maneuverability means her whole body is often moving quickly with each strike, her offending limb only adding to the velocity; at terminal velocity, she can deliver a dive-bombing punch or stomp that can smash a crater in a concrete sidewalk. Her bones and muscles are of course highly resistant to the kinetic forces this property entails as well as blunt-force impacts in general, a useful trait for someone who tends to crash-land more than she likes to.<br>Finally, Sarah is capable of speak with birds (again, from her corresponding bit character). This property has been rendered mostly irrelevant around avian and ornithanthrope agents (such as her own adopted brother, Falchion), courtesy of the Universal Translator; however, for occasions when she needs to communicate with avians in continua that don’t revolve around anthropomorphic creatures, it can come in fairly useful. She was able to learn the dialects of at least six different clades, along with the specific speech patterns of at least ten different species, prior to her canonical death, and she is currently broadening her studies to the languages of avians from other continua as well.<br><br><b>History</b><br>Sarah first came to life as a major character in a mega-crossover, which was partially written by the same author who created Falchion. This mega-crossover primarily took place within the continuum of a prominent Pixar movie, <i>The Incredibles</i>, and the story in question focused on the idea of some of the lost Supers mentioned in the movie being resurrected. Unfortunately, this particular fanfic turned into a series of consecutive disasters as more and more continua got dragged in for no good reason. Ironically, the concept of Super revival was both interesting and fairly well handled given the horrific context, and cloned Supers themselves were considerably more tolerable characters than certain others who were trotted in later on.<br>Sarah herself is based on Stratogale, a canonical bit Super who died while rescuing a commercial airliner when her cape snagged on a turbine. Because she was based on a bit character with very little development to begin with, she, along with the other cloned Supers, was given a personality that was fleshed out surprisingly well throughout the story, despite the escalating stupidity of the fic itself. Established as the daughter of two other Supers, one killed by another cape snag and another by Syndrome’s Operation Kronos, she basically kept everyone’s development going strong, even with the sudden arrival of a Gary Stu who claimed to be her biological brother and later derailed the fic altogether, all the while pursuing her close friend, the canonical Violet Parr, as a love interest.<br>Agents Falchion and Rashida discovered Sarah while venturing into this particular badfic on their first mission, during which Falchion began recalling experiences as the fic’s “heroic” Stu. Although she did not know the truth until much later, Sarah actually interacted with Falchion several times throughout the mission, as his disguise was virtually identical to said Stu. This came to a head when Falchion was forced to kill both the Stu and a dinosaurian Character Replacement of Violet on his own; with Rashida incapacitated due to stress overload, Falchion managed to convince Sarah to assist him with Not!Violet in particular, though this would later come back to bite him when she witnessed the deaths of both remaining Suvian characters and mistakenly thought that Falchion had murdered her brother. Falchion was able to clear up this misunderstanding, however, and Sarah eagerly accepted his offer to work for the PPC as a token of gratitude for her help.<br>Sarah is currently staying with her rescuer and his partner while the Flowers are deciding which department she is to be ultimately assigned to. She also has plans to visit her noncanonical family during the next holiday season, and still exchanges regular correspondence with Violet, whom she is still good friends with.<br><br><b>Personality</b><br>Sarah is a cheery and outgoing but headstrong girl who prefers to solve her problems with her fists. Given her history of squaring off against a wide variety of threats, such a predilection would have been vital to her survival back in her homefic. She has yet to learn that this behavior may not be the ideal choice for an environment such as the PPC HQ, where socialization with other Agents is strongly encouraged, but the PPC is all about giving poorly written characters a beatdown, and it’s hard to find someone more eager to take up the task. Though Sarah likes to metaphorically keep her head in the clouds, she’s still an excellent source on how to handle terrible fanfiction, being a former badfic character herself. She’s also blessed with a great sense of humor, and enjoys joking about the random things that poor writing may inadvertently do to the Word World during missions.<br>The biggest problem most people have with Sarah’s character is that she is as obstinate as she is strong. It’s a bit of a chore to convince her to change her course of action when she’s in a <i>good</i> mood, and when enraged she’s nothing short of inconsolable. This can lead to her rushing into things too quickly and often without thinking sensibly, which in turn earns the ire of many of her peers, especially those who prefer to actually sit down and think of the best way to handle the situation; in general, while her affable demeanor allows her to make friends quite easily, her recklessness and immaturity can lead to her making enemies just as quickly. She isn’t oblivious to her “Leeroy Jenkins”-esque temperament, however, and she often feels rightly guilty whenever her actions have unforeseen and often horrific consequences. Her reliance on reckless brute force also belies a deep sense of caring, and she’s willing to respect those who are there to cool her down if the situation calls for it. Her headstrong attitude (along with any repercussions thereof) is in fact more than welcome as far as character development is concerned, and may even serve as a benefit in the right circumstances, as long as her allies can keep her protected as she forges ahead.<br><br><b>Sexuality and Kinks</b><br>While Sarah has yet to explore any explicit subject matter (Heaven forbid she gets a Bad Slash mission), she IS familiar with at least one fetish, courtesy of her author, although her experiences with tickling back in her homefic were in no way sexual. She’s a committed switch-tickler and very merciless when on the offensive, where she can best put her super-strength to use when restraining her victims. On the flipside, her feet are somewhat larger than average and extremely sensitive, and it’s not hard to reduce her to a giggling mess simply by teasing the pads of her toes. The playful nature of such scenes in her homefic means she enjoys receiving the tantalizing sensations just as much as she loves dishing them out, and this is one of the quickest ways of cheering her up when she feels depressed.<br>Sarah is straight, through and through, and even has an uncanonical boyfriend, Wendell “Stryclone” Zuckerman, in her home continuum. Being a dominant type of character who prefers to lead the way if given the choice, she prefers her ideal partner to be submissive but also caring and dedicated to her safety the way Stryclone is.<br><br>----------<br><br>Just two things: 1) Can an agent be friends with a canon?  I know Chilever and Winston befriended a canon from Les Miserables at one point. And 2) can an agent wear their supersuit or canon-appropriate outfit during missions where a disguise is not required, or do they have to go with a PPC standard uniform?<br><br>Thanks in advance, folks! I eagerly await your response. :)</p>

            <p>The way I interpreted the NSA Files DVD extra citation, the dialects likely referred to different kinds of birds, with the species scattered across different groups. A hawk has a different dialect from a parrot for example. Besides, she spoke to members of multiple bird groups in the fic. I could indicate as such in the final bio version, though group does work better than clade as the latter is a tad too broad of a term.</p>

<li>Some of the older spin-offs had a greater amount of interaction with canon characters than we typically do today.  Eponine&#39;s presence in HQ is one of the factors that got criticized heavily in Chliever&#39;s spin-off, and contributed to his eventual abandonment of it.  (Personally, I wish we had given him a chance to resolve that storyline, but let&#39;s not get into it here.)  On the other hand, there&#39;s the situation with Xanthus Garkaran and his friend who still lives in the <i>Mass Effect</i> continuum.  She isn&#39;t an actual canon from the game, but she is treated a realistic background character for the setting.  I&#39;m not totally sure what situation you had in mind; is this answer helpful?<br><br>2. Some agents do wear &quot;regular&quot; clothes in lieu of the PPC black.  (Although in my mind, the PPC uniform is regular clothes that happen to be black.)  And that sort of clothing has often been worn into Earthish continua where they wouldn&#39;t attract attention, rather than bothering with a disguise.  A supersuit wouldn&#39;t work out so well there, though, unless Sarah was going into a world with superheroes who wear costumes.  Even then, it&#39;s a tricky question; she could probably blend in that way in Marvel or DC, but maybe not in Watchmen, where there are a finite and well-known number of heroes.  (Or maybe I&#39;m over-thinking that part a bit.)</li>

            <p>1.) While this answer is somewhat relevant in that the Galeforces as a family are similarly noncanonical but realistic enough to be recurrent in my missions, what I was thinking of is that Violet stays with her own family and within her home continuum, rather than venturing into HQ and causing trouble (which wouldn&#39;t fly with the other Boarders in light of their reaction to the Eponine story arc; Vi&#39;s going to be returned to her family during my next mission). The interaction I had in mind was that Sarah regularly exchanges correspondence with Violet in the form of long-distance communication (letters, e-mail, etc.), but even then these interactions are never actually shown in canon. And in the event that Sarah does revisit The Incredibles continuum in a future mission (which is quite likely, considering that there&#39;s a TF2/Incredibles crossover that&#39;s gotten my attention recently), Vi would probably recognize her as a friend. As long as Sarah doesn&#39;t openly tell her about the PPC, they should be good, right?<br>2.) Sarah does have civilian gear, and given this answer she&#39;s likely going to wear it more often when she&#39;s not in disguise. I&#39;m still thinking of having her keep her Supersuit in storage, in case she goes into a Teen Titans  or Marvel Comics mission, but regular clothes sounds good for most instances.<br><br>I was actually hoping for constructive criticism regarding Sarah&#39;s bio, especially regarding her abilities and how balanced they&#39;d be with respect to her home continuum, and in truth, I still am, though this response is nice too. I&#39;ll be sure to let you know when my next mission is ready for beta-reading in the meantime.</p>

            <p>If I understand this right, Violet knew Sarah only in the sporked badfic. Since this has been cleaned up Violet should not remember Sarah, which is really sad because their relationship was apparently well written. The situation with Xanthus and his friend is different; they are both OCs and no badfic was involved.<br><br>But reconsidering how you finished the mission, I’m no longer sure. You left the Galeforces to integrate into the <i>Incredibles</i> universe. I don’t remember any precedent where such a character was seen again. Does &quot;integrating&quot; mean that they live in this world, but are not allowed to interact with canons? If they had to go out of their way to avoid accidental interaction, for reasons they cannot explain to anybody, they would not really be integrated. Low level interactions which don’t change canon plotlines should be allowed. So I changed my mind. It is possible that Violet still knows the Galeforces and remembers the girl who left this family for ominous reasons. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t respond to the bio because I didn&#39;t see any problems with it.  The one thing I was a little iffy on was the talking-to-birds bit, as it doesn&#39;t really follow from the kinetics basis of her other powers.  However, you seem to have based that on a DVD extra (which I&#39;ve never seen, and can&#39;t comment on), so that seems to have basis in canon, too.  (Also, it&#39;s a lot easier to assess characters in action than it is to assess lists of info.)<br><br>As for the friendship with Violet thing . . . Well, <i>I</i> don&#39;t have a problem with it, but again, I wasn&#39;t bothered by the Eponine thing much, either, so I might not have the best point of view to give a helpful answer.  It&#39;s going to be the whole community reacting to what you write.  So hopefully, OTHER PEOPLE will GIVE ANSWERS here HINT HINT EVERYONE.  </p>

            <p>As I said when I commented on the first half, you continue to do an excellent job juggling the sheer bulk of canons and characters that had to appear on-screen in this mission.  You show the reader the sheer <i>amount</i> of complication that&#39;s intertwined, but still keep the actual mission&#39;s story plowing forward through it all.  There&#39;s one spot where this causes a problem: letting replacement!Ludlow die without being charged, which is stated in the original series to let the killed character&#39;s legacy to continue influencing canon.  However, I don&#39;t see this particular instance to be too much of a problem.  Replacement!Ludlow had the least effect on the story compared to the other three Suvians, his characterization was so &quot;generic villain&quot; that he barely resembled the canon Ludlow, and you described a very thorough neuralyzation and disentangling job at the end, which would have wiped any remaining influence from replacement!Ludlow out of the story.  Next time, though, be sure to charge OCs that get offed, and preferably do the offing yourself; I know this story got complicated, but that is part of the agents&#39; Duty.<br><br>Getting back to that epilogue, you did a good job of communicating the sheer time the agents had to put in to disentangling everything without turning it into a rote list of, &quot;and then they did blah and then they did bleh and then they did bluh.&quot;  I like that you involved Mr. Dicker in the cover-up process; since that&#39;s his canon job, it&#39;s reasonable to think he would go along with the neuralyzation process to a certain extent.  One more major scene that I feel did warrant inclusion here would have been the healed Violet being reunited with the rest of the Parrs.  Actually, bringing up Violet reminds me: I don&#39;t understand why she had a missing leg in the first place.  If there was a source for that occurring in the badfic, you should include it, because otherwise, it feels rather random, and an out-of-place thing to happen to an <i>Incredibles</i> canon.  (Unless I&#39;m just forgetting something that happened in the first half of the mission?)<br><br>The way you imitate the original fic&#39;s script format is especially creative.  Each time you had Falchion get stuck in it, it made sense, whether separated from Rashida and the RA, or when Rashida was knocked out.  I did find it rather obnoxious to read, since the way I read is to read every word on the page.  However, in this case, that annoyance is actually a plus, as it better showed me Falchion&#39;s own feelings when having to deal with it.<br><br>I see now that I was too hasty in one comment I made last time.  I made the assumption that Rashida, as the more experienced agent, was correct in her mockery of Falchion, but I see now that you were setting her up to overreact in Medical, and then get her comeuppance.  I like this; it&#39;s a nice change from the clichй of the veteran agent always being the more level-headed and wise one.  So sorry for jumping the gun last time.<br><br>As I see it, this mission does suffer one major flaw.  In your ending author note, you mention that the final chapters were basically a violent gore-fest, and that that&#39;s one of the major issues you wanted to address.  Unfortunately, your way of addressing it was to show some of the worst such scenes (but I&#39;m primarily talking about replacement!Ludlow&#39;s death here) in blocks of full quotes from the fic.  At the simplest level, this does show the reader how bad the gore was, but personally, I feel that it also aggrandizes that gore, and puts it on display.  I think it would have been far more effective to give just one or two lines, something like, &quot;Another display of gore showered the ground.  In the end, the mostly still-recognizable head of not!Ludlow slid down a nearby wall.&quot;  I somewhat understand why you wanted to show that whole display, since it leads to Rashida&#39;s break.  However, a short description like the lines above still get across how unrealistic and over-the-top the violence was without making the reader have to read it directly.  And quite frankly, <i>I don&#39;t feel that I needed to read that</i>, either from a narrative perspective, or from matters of simple taste and comfort.  This is especially true of replacement!Ludlow, who was already established as a character replacement, and was pretty much acting like a bad, generic villain; his death simply didn&#39;t deserve that level of detail and drama within the mission, because he was ultimately such a non-factor.  To further fall from the point you wanted to make about the awfulness of the violence, you wind up partaking in some more all on your own, without the badfic helping at all.  I&#39;m talking about UltraViolet&#39;s assassination scene.  We hardly needed to read about a <i>Tyrannosaurus rex&#39;s</i> worth of innards hitting the ground.  Certainly describe the explosion being cross-shaped, since that was a clever little brick joke from the earliest portion of the fic.  But the reader didn&#39;t need to &quot;see&quot; that body.  A simple, &quot;and then it blew up,&quot; would have sufficed; we&#39;re all familiar with explosions.  (Well, through media, anyway.)  But giving UltraViolet an eerily similar death scene to replacement!Ludlow&#39;s only reinforces and vindicates the unnecessary violence from the badfic.  (Also, I think it would have made the <i>T. rex</i> head popping out of the bag of holding later a heck of a lot more surprising and funny/less morbid.)  The one benefit you did derive from displaying all that gore was that it made the scene in the epilogue, when the Galeforce family had their little reunion, all the more sweet.  It gave me the sense that <i>The Incredibles</i> canon had been returned to its family and Disney-oriented roots.  It was so sappy, that it felt right at home there.  Nonetheless, I still think the mission would be better with less gore, both quoted from the badfic and as part of the mission&#39;s actual narration.</p>

            <p>Totally forgot to address that, sorry <sup><sup>;<br><br>In</sup></sup> the original badfic, two chapters before the one where Vi got turned into a T. rex, she was attacked by a Carnotaurus (from the Lost World novel) and had her leg bitten as she was carried away. I&#39;m inclined to guess that the creature liked the taste of her like the other JP dinosaurs would, but she fell into that one plot hole before it could get second helpings. The mission mentioned that a dinosaur had bitten Violet&#39;s leg off sometime earlier during the part when she was discovered (and patched up on short notice by Rashida, for reasons that should be obvious).</p>

            <p>Firstly, thank you for the kind words regarding the strong points of this mission! I&#39;m happy that most it came through in the sense that it was coherent despite its length. I was originally going to analyze every single thing that went wrong with that fic in excruciating detail, but Des warned me against it as such would draw the mission out for far too long. I may release some &quot;deleted scenes&quot; detailing bits that I particularly liked but had to cut to save time, but there&#39;s no need to rush those since I&#39;ll likely spend my time doing more productive things. As for the script-fic, I also wrote the entire mission in that format initially, but Des advised against that as well because it would&#39;ve made it unreadable. I&#39;m glad you think the way I handled that was a good thing!<br><br>As for the gore in Acts 6 and 7, the way I handled it was to let it speak for itself, and then retaliate in kind to the original material. An eye for an eye, if you will. That said, though, looking back at this mission I found it hard to read Not!Ludlow&#39;s death scene explicitly myself, cathartic as it was back then, so in the context of the mission I&#39;m not sure if it was such a good idea in hindsight. I also viewed V-Wrex&#39;s death in a similar light when I wrote the original draft, but you make a good point in that it doesn&#39;t counter the problem I&#39;d originally wanted to rectify. Guh.<br>Given both of these sentiments, I&#39;ve modified both scenes to make them more palatable, and the updated versions are listed below. Hope that helps!<br><br>Not!Ludlow&#39;s death:<br><br>&quot;Falchion realized what was going to happen, and tried to force Rashida down, but she punched him in the face before he could touch her. He collapsed again, bleeding from his nose, but it was too late to shout a warning. Right then and there, in full view of the entire cast <i>and</i> the unfortunate agents, the baby <i>T. rexes</i> fell upon the terrified Replacement and ripped him to shreds.<br>Four excruciating paragraphs of horrifyingly graphic detail later, Not!Ludlow’s severed head, torn from his body, smashed into some kind of invisible screen, mere inches from Rashida’s face. His eyes, wide and unknowing, gazed blindly into her own, and the agents watched his wretched head fall to the ground with a sickening <i>whump.</i>&quot;<br><br>V-Wrex&#39;s death:<br><br>&quot;And then the dinosaur exploded. It happened so suddenly that the Super teen had no time to make sense of it; all she knew was that she was momentarily blinded by a cross-shaped blast of light, heat, and death. When Sarah recovered her sight a few moments later, the only part of V-Wrex that remained intact was her head, which had smashed into the ground and skidded across the rail yard before stopping just inches away from her.&quot;<br><br>One last thing: I&#39;m already making some progress into my next mission, though it may take a while due to working on a conference paper. Given the constructiveness of your feedback, may I ask if you could beta-read it directly once it&#39;s done? Thanks! :D</p>

            <p>Yeah, &quot;retaliating in kind&quot; sometimes runs the risk of &quot;sinking to the badfic&#39;s level.&quot;  I mean, assassinations with ironic undertones are one thing, but emulating badly handled writing is pretty tricky to execute well.<br><br>I&#39;m certainly willing to be a beta, but just so you know, my job&#39;s busy season is picking up, and work hours are increasing.

            <p>Whew! I don&#39;t think that I have ever seen such a <i>long</i> entry as a PPCer&#39;s first mission. However, I must admit that you&#39;ve done a good job. Though it was long, it was not rambly; a laudable achievement.<br><br>Two things, however.<br><br>First, there are a few SPaG errors:<br>•  <i>“Oh. </i>Ohhhhh.<i> It was a dream sequence. Of </i>course<i> it was.” She made sure to note an extra charge for confusing the Duat out of them as well.</i>: That &quot;she&quot; should be “Rashida”; the previous paragraph of narrative was from Falchion&#39;s POV, and except for the reference to Duat, there is nothing in-paragraph to note that the speaker was Rashida.<br><br>•  <i>appeared out of no where</i>: “nowhere” should be one word here, not two.<br><br>• <i>The teens and the PPC agents rushed back to the cloning room we’d just visited</i>: Don’t you mean “<b>they’d</b> just visited”?<br><br>•    <i>and the ensuing narrative everyone, including t rex, into silence</i>: It looks like you&#39;re missing a word there. Perhaps the missing verb is “<b>stunned</b> everyone … into silence”?<br><br>• <i>Its robotic legs clung to it as though it about to pry it free.</i> As is, the second-to-last “it” is out of place. too many. Consider deleting that &quot;it&quot; or adding a verb:<br><br><i>Its robotic legs clung to it as though about to pry it free.</i><br>OR
<br><i>Its robotic legs clung to it as though it <b>was</b> about to pry it free.</i><br><br>Of course, with all those &quot;it&quot;s, you might want to add a different noun, replacing one of the &quot;it&quot;s with &quot;the scarab&quot; or &quot;the finger,&quot; as appropriate.<br><br>Second, regarding the badfic itself, I did not think that the format was that bad at all. IIRC, the premise is that the fic is actually a recording. That said, the first-person/scriptfic format is actually appropriate, as it accurately conveys the sense of people adding their two cents to the story as appropriate. Too bad that the story <i>itself</i> was horribly written, but IMO, the format was not one of the weaknesses.<br><br>Either way, good work, and congratulations on besting one of your old shames.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the lateness, research is a pain! Yeah, it was SUPER long, but for me it was necessary to make up for the majority of the mistakes I made in the past as a writer. And yeah, in hindsight the recording thing should&#39;ve been considered for the format, so I retconned a line in Act 1 to mention it. I&#39;ve also fixed all the SPaG errors, too!<br><br>Additionally, I&#39;ve decided to open up adoption for the following mini-T. rexes: t-rex, t-rexs, spinos, spinosaurus, ludlows, jurassic park, and Jurassic park (not to be confused with Caddy-Shack&#39;s Jurasic park). As noted in the fic, spinos and spinosaurus both have sails on their backs like the Spinosaurus from the third movie. I wonder if I can send them over to the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=264251;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">Mini Adoption Center</a>, and if so, may I ask how I can do so?

            <p>Remember <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Radio_Nutmeg">Radio Nutmeg</a>? Well, times have moved on since the distant year of, like, 2008 or something, and the station high in the mountains of New Caledonia has moved with them.<br><br>Freshly released by Nutmeg Television&#39;s Leaks Division (&quot;No-one reads our press releases,&quot; Agent Notte Ling is reported as saying, &quot;but agents will give up bleeprin if they think it&#39;ll get them access to an unauthorised leak.&quot;), the <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qnzbsuTymINHw4oQOrXRIMHgRIiHEIgM-mHQUY2a3rs/pub">latest broadcasting schedule</a></b> covers both <u>Nutmeg Television</u> itself and the children&#39;s channel, <u>Nutmint TV</u>.

            <p><i>Done in narrative form for fun, but rather stream of consciousness, and maybe not much fun to read?  Also, I think Doc wanting to watch TV is probably OOC for him, but uh . . . chock it up to curiosity?</i><br><br>&quot;So, do we actually <i>get</i> television, or is this just for researching games?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, no, we get all kinds of stuff!  HQ has its own channel.&quot;  Vania held down the PlayStation&#39;s start button and the screen flickered, but displayed the same image.<br><br>&quot;Is it . . . stuck?&quot; Doc asked.<br><br>&quot;Oh, this is a Let&#39;s Play.  I think the A/V Division sponsors this.  It lets agents show off what they&#39;re playing from their RC.  And then . . .&quot; she pressed a button on the remote control.  &quot;There&#39;s a separate channel for kids.  Nutmint, as opposed to the regular Nutmeg.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ugh.  Like Nick, Jr. or whatever?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, this is the PPC, so no.  It&#39;s much better.&quot;<br><br>The screen showed a thin-haired man reading from a large book.  &quot;&#39;My name&#39;s Scrubb, and this is Pole,&#39; said Eustace.  &#39;Would you mind telling us where we are?&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, Narnia,&quot; said Doc, but then he frowned.  &quot;Is that actually Lewis?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Vania calmly.<br><br>&quot;But.&quot;  Doc shut his eyes and shook his head.  &quot;But Lewis is.  Is.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dead?  Maybe on your Earth.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But that&#39;s it?  Two channels, and one aimed at kids?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, no, no, no!  Those are just the two created here, specifically for HQ.  We get reception from all different shows.  Here, do some surfing.  I gotta pee.&quot;<br><br>Doc frowned as he took the remote.  &quot;Thanks for sharing,&quot; he muttered.  He tried out an arrow key, and the channel changed again.<br><br>It was playing the theme song to a cartoon.  &quot;♪On the Transformatronic Vocational Transport!  Step inside, it&#39;s a wondrous, fantastical ride!  Ride on the Transformatronic Vocational Transport!♪&quot;<br><br>&quot;God, yes,&quot; Doc murmured.<br><br>&quot;. . . What are you watching out there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Children&#39;s cartoons,&quot; Doc replied obliviously.  &quot;Also, don&#39;t talk to me from the toilet, please.&quot;  He changed the channel again.<br><br>A bipedal green lizard was charging at a weird black doll with red eyes in a circle around its head.  A pinkish light suddenly appeared in front of the doll, which the lizard tried to slash through.  An announcer&#39;s voice called out, &quot;Claydol managed to survive that Leaf Blade thanks to Reflect, it was still super effective damage!  And now it looks like Steven is switching to another Pokйmon.&quot;<br><br>Doc flipped.  A girl with long hair was marching jerkily towards the camera with a well in the background.<br><br>&quot;Weird,&quot; said Doc, and he flipped.<br><br>A dark stairwell showed, lit only by a weird emergency light glued to a wall, which was beginning to sputter and fade.  There was just enough light to see an expressionless mask floating in midair.  It slowly began to glide towards the screen.<br><br>Doc huffed.  &quot;Weird.&quot;  he changed it again.<br><br>A stone statue of an angel stood in a mist, hands covering its face.  Hearing the sink running, Doc turned to address Vania as she returned to the main room, and so missed the statue pull its hands away from its face.<br><br>&quot;Vania, a lot of these channels are just weird.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whatcha got?&quot; she asked, coming around the corner of the screen to see a Weeping Angel advancing towards them.  She shrieked and grabbed the remote, hitting the &quot;Home&quot; button to go back to Nutmeg TV.  &quot;Let&#39;s just stay in HQ for now, okay?&quot;<br><br>Doc&#39;s brow was furrowed.  &quot;What was that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Something we wouldn&#39;t want in HQ.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But then, we&#39;re stuck with just the two channels.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, sort of.  But remember, we&#39;re in HQ.  Time only counts for a sixth, here.  Let&#39;s see what was on an hour ago.&quot;  She pressed another button.<br><br>The video game footage was replaced with a classroom setting.  A little kid in ratty clothing was talking at the head of the classroom.  &quot;And seeing as how you students is all having such difficulties in writing about the lives of Paris&#39;s poor, Miss Irene informs me that you&#39;ll each be having a turn spending a night in the elephant—&quot; he grinned— &quot;with the <i>rats</i>.<br><br>The seated students groaned, some beginning to complain before the gibbering of some book-shaped figures silenced them.<br><br>&quot;Oooh!  OFU lessons!  How about an hour from now?&quot;<br><br>The screen now showed a PicPsych nurse, apparently being interviewed.  &quot;It is hard sometimes, you know?  I mean, I&#39;m trained to improve people&#39;s mental health, and with agents, that&#39;s what I do.  But with some canons . . . Well, let&#39;s get back to Captain Ahab; he&#39;s a prime example.  He was heavily Sued when we got him, and we essentially had to get rid of all his well-adjusted behaviors, and find away to bring back the monomania.&quot;<br><br>Vania glanced at Doc mischievously.  &quot;Wanna cheat?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s see what was going on back in Jay&#39;s time.&quot;  She held a button down for nearly a full minute.  When she stopped, an agent was just setting down a paper.  &quot;That concludes our list,&quot; she said, folding her fingers together and giving the camera a look somewhere between a smirk and a sneer.  &quot;If you have any information on these dangerous rogue agents, <i>do not</i> hesitate to inform the first officer you see.  Just look for the sash with the Black Cat.&quot;  She turned herself to demonstrate the flash patch on her won sleeve.<br><br>&quot;Eh.  Bad example,&quot; Vania said, hitting &quot;Home&quot; again.  &quot;Let&#39;s try a couple decades in the future?&quot;<br><br>It was another news report.  A young woman on &quot;on the scene,&quot; as they say, of a section of hallway brutalized with scorch marks and slashes in the generic surface.  &quot;Several of the agents involved are currently being cared fro in Medical,&quot; the reported said into the microphone.  &quot;However, one agent present in the confrontation is said to be missing.  Internal Affairs is asking for any information regarding the whereabouts of Agent V—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Meh.  I&#39;d rather not know.&quot;  Vania flipped back to the present.  &quot;So anyway, what do yo feel like—watching.&quot;<br><br>Doc was back on his bed, reading.  He grunted.<br><br><i>So, uh, thoughts?  Concrit?</i> gfd</p>

            <p>Specific things that made me grin:<br><br>- Steampunk Magic School Bus! {= D<br><br>- Weeping Angels. (What is the other weird stuff? I don&#39;t recognize those things.)<br><br>- Les Mis OFU.<br><br>- FicPsych interview. I can totally see Nurse Parwill giving those comments.

The scorched and slashed walls (nice word choice with &quot;brutalized,&quot; btw) made me think of Catastrophe Theory, even though I know that can&#39;t be what you&#39;re alluding to; the timeline is wrong, and, well, so are other things. I want to know what happens, but at the same time, I hope it doesn&#39;t—it sounds bad!<br><br>- Doc back on his bed reading at the end.

            <p>I was trying to come up with some more illustrative lyrics for the steampunk Magic School Bus theme song, but it wasn&#39;t quite coming to me, and I had a work shift looming closer as I wrote.  I&#39;ll have to make a better attempt at some point.<br><br>The other weird stuff: The girl is Samara, from <i>Ringu</i>/<i>The Ring</i>, a ghost who kills people who watch a cursed VHS tape (Japan!) by coming out of the television.  The other is <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-087">SCP-087</a>, which may or not be able to leave the TV and attack people— the exploration documents linked at the bottom of that page leave it ambiguous.  (That SCP is one of the legitimately creepy ones, especially those bottom links, so don&#39;t read if well-made creepypasta bothers you.)<br><br>The OFUs.  I&#39;d like to see a bit more interaction between our shared universes, but it gets tricky with getting permission from people who stopped writing them years ago.  Hopefully, this little scene isn&#39;t stepping too far out of line. &gt;.&gt; It would be nice for them to get some cameos on Nutmeg, at least.<br><br>Oh dear.  &quot;PicPsych&quot; definitely wasn&#39;t intentional (looming work shift).  It could make a decent title, with &quot;pic&quot; being short for &quot;picture&quot;/film, but that doesn&#39;t work with the names of other departments.  Maybe it was a shrink-only special event?  And I didn&#39;t have any particular nurse in mind there, but we can certainly make it Parwill if you like.<br><br>Oh.  You <i>will</i> find out what happened in that broadcast.  But that&#39;s a long time coming.  (Twenty years  was probably conservative, at the rate I write.  But Vania wasn&#39;t being precise with the remote buttons, and also wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff.) :)</p>

            <p>I figured here would be a good place to ask, since obscure fandoms seems to be a thing for PPCers.<br><br>When I was really little, maybe eight or nine, there was a book (that might be part of a series, I&#39;m not sure) and a book series that I really enjoyed that I haven&#39;t been able to find despite the wonder of Google.<br><br>The first one had an adolescent girl who found a book in a library that taught her how to do magic, and she befriended a boy about the same age who had the same book. There were two older wizards who kind of sort of but not really became their mentors (I think one of them had a mynah bird or a parrot- some sort of talking bird) and the kids went to what I think was an alternate future post-apocalyptic Manhattan where this evil darkness tried to kill them.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if this was a series or not because I only found the one book, but I distinctly remember there was some sort of cliffhanger, which makes me think there are more books.<br><br><br>The second one started with a girl waking up from a coma with amnesia, and her aunt and uncle told her she&#39;d been in a car accident. The girl went back to her aunt and uncle&#39;s farm where she met her horse, which had a mysterious rough bony patch on its forehead. It turns out the horse was actually a bronze unicorn whose horn had been sawed off and he&#39;d come to our world with the girl to protect her, who was actually a princess. There were also black unicorns who were waging war against the girl&#39;s kingdom and they opposed the bronze unicorn and the others (I can&#39;t remember the full range of colors, but I&#39;m assuming that since the main unicorn was bronze there were unicorns that covered the metallic spectrum).<br><br>I&#39;ve been searching for these books for almost ten years and would love it if someone could point me in the right direction.  {:-)</p>

            <p>So when I was ten, my family was on an out-of-state road trip, when one of my parents saw an adorable dusty second-hand bookshop and decided to stop. We all went in, grabbed a few books to buy, and headed for the checkout. On the way, I really randomly reached out and pulled a book off the top of a stack, liked the cover, and sent it through with the others.<br><br>That one was So You Want Etc. Read it and loved it, but it didn&#39;t really occur to me to look for others.<br><br>UNTIL ONE DAY my sister randomly brought home High Wizardry (book 3) from the library, and I discovered that there were several others . . . and either that year or the next, Diane Duane resumed the series after a decade-long hiatus.<br><br>The Powers are clearly sending me a message, so I keep taking the Oath, but, uh . . . no joy yet.<br><br>(Though I should say, I got into fanfiction because of YW, then got into the PPC because of fanfiction, then met hS because of the PPC.

            <p>In my case, the PPC plus RPing and fanfiction got me into <i>Young Wizards</i>. I was hanging out with Blayze, Ori, and Hawkelf on AIM, and one of Blayze&#39;s RP characters was a version of the Lone Power inspired by a couple of really good fics: &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1514189/1/Welcome-to-Timeheart">Welcome to Timeheart</a>&quot; by Persephone Kore and &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1487734/1/On-the-Care-and-Keeping-of-Shoulder-Angels">On the Care and Keeping of Shoulder Angels</a>&quot; by Semiramis. (Both of those contain major spoilers for books after the first three or four, for anyone who&#39;s concerned.) The first one is serious and the second one is silly, and the combination sufficed to make it clear that I <i>needed</i> to read the books. It was a very good decision. {= D<br><br>I guess it&#39;s a bit late for the Oath to take for us, but maybe your kids, when they&#39;re a bit older? <sup>_~<br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></p>

            <p>Or rather, arguments. While the concept is interesting enough, the execution is very poorly done. First things first, Quirrel. He&#39;s been outright replaced; he simply doesn&#39;t act like Quirrel should (which is some sort of falling leaf-ish behaviour) and there&#39;s no justification whatsoever for the change.<br>Then there&#39;s Harry. Eleven year olds are not that smart - I&#39;ve been one and I&#39;m gifted and I&#39;m not that intelligent. Even if he&#39;s well-read (and god knows I&#39;ve had lots of books crammed in my head when I was eleven) he just can&#39;t be that sort of Palpatine-order-of-magnitude chessmaster-slash-manipulator. Add to that his ambition of wanting to become god and you have enough charges to execute this guy as a replacement.<br>Then there&#39;s the fact that the fic is a blatant author tract in the style of &quot;Rationalism and Consequentialism are good!&quot; which, in my opinion, is a bad thing to do when writing fiction.</p>

            <p>Quirrel really doesn&#39;t get much characterization throughout the book at all. We meet him once at the beginning, when he is stuttering and quivering and terrified, and though we see a little of it through the book, it culminates in the revelation that Quirrel really isn&#39;t really like that. As far as I remember? It&#39;s been a while. <br>Other than that, I pretty much agree, though that doesn&#39;t really stop it from being an engaging read for me. :P</p>

            <p>I was just going to start reading the Methods of Rationality when I thought I&#39;d look at the author&#39;s profile (it&#39;s one of those things I do on FFnet). On there the author has put up a section called &quot;The (first) Three Laws of Fanfiction:&quot; and then launches off with the first rule: &quot; If you do anything to increase the protagonist&#39;s power, or make their life easier, you must also amplify their opponent or add extra difficulties to their life. You can&#39;t make Frodo a Jedi unless you give Sauron the Death Star. Otherwise, even if it is well-written in all other ways, your story will suck because the reader will know to expect an unending string of easy victories, leading them to neither wonder or care about what happens next. &quot; OK, fair enough. It&#39;s the next (and final) sentence that&#39;s the whole reason behind this post. <br>&quot;The Mary Sue is not defined by her power being too strong, but by her challenges being too easily overcome.&quot; Personally I don&#39;t wholly agree with that, whilst having challenges that she can overcome easily is part of a Suefic, the fact that her powers are too strong is, to me, a definitive part of the character being a Sue/Stu, alongside any uncanonical elements that are bought into the story though the Sue/Stu (Which, yes could also include the power.)<br>What do you guys think?<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>It does not matter how powerful they are, what matters is that how powerful they are in relation to the canon. It does not matter if the character can destroy buildings in one hit, if it is normal for people in that canon. Also, giving power to both sides of the equation when you give power to a character is an easy way to prevent making sues, as it is still difficult for them to win. The main reasons sues are sues is not that they are powerful, but that they seem to to stuff with no effort at all. IE: killing Sauron by pointing at him. Also, I think there is a fic on fanfiction.net about Sauron teaming up with General Grievous from Star Wars, and it is awesome. I think it is called &quot;The Battle for Arda&quot; or something like that.   </p>
