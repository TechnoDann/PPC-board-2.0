            <p>After a week long seminar, I have finally had a chance to return to the boards! Over the last few days, I have come up with a few questions.<br><br>1: How exactly does one claim a badfic? Do we have to post a message about it, or do we just move it to the list of claimed badfic on the wiki? Or maybe something else entirely?<br><br>2: What is the preferable way to post PPC stories? I&#39;ve seen people use google docs, fanfiction.net, and a number of other sites in the past. Since the PPC has been around for some time now, have we found one place that is better/easier to post stories on, or is it just a personal preference kind of thing?<br><br>3: What do people use to make those little sprite image things we use as to demonstrate how the agents look on the wiki?<br><br>Thanks in advance to anyone who gives me a hand with these.</p>

            <p>1/ There&#39;s no actual formal way of claiming a badfic - if you write a mission about it, it&#39;s yours, whatever you have or haven&#39;t done. That said, if it&#39;s on the Unclaimed list, moving it to Claimed will stop anyone else trying to do the same mission (question, people: does anyone actually <i>use</i> the Unclaimed list? I don&#39;t think I ever have). You don&#39;t need to post here about it, though - &#39;claiming&#39; is only important in that it means you&#39;ve chosen something to write a mission for; it has no inherent value.<br><br>2/ Not fanfiction.net! Seriously, they have a habit of taking missions down. Google Docs are popular right now for hosting the actual text, though of course they don&#39;t make for memorable site addresses. Livejournal is always an option, and (for example) sjostenppc.livejournal.com is easy to remember. You can also make your own website - I use Webs.com, Neshomeh prefers Tripod for some unearthly reason.<br><br>It basically depends what you want. If you&#39;re happy for your missions to only be reachable via the Wiki, post them in Google Docs. If you prefer to have <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/index.htm">your own website</a>, either all for the PPC or just in part, make one - and then link to the missions in Google Docs anyway. ;)<br><br>3/ Most of them use <a href="http://www.tektek.org/dream_avatar/">TekTek Dream Avatar</a>. It&#39;s quite versatile, and the &#39;bold, flat colours&#39; aesthetic makes it easy to edit in the image software of your choice if you need to make tweaks.<br><br>hS</p>

Anything you feel that needs to be yeled acros the Grand Canyon?<br><br>Like me, for example.  I am toiling away, working towards Permission. I&#39;m currently reading The Disappearance of Ember Crow, which is such a fantastic book.

            <p>Alright at the moment, been hit with a ton of coursework and working up to the end of year exams that will appear after Easter, but getting through most of it reasonably comfortably. I&#39;m currently reading The Dragon&#39;s Path by Daniel Abraham, it&#39;s a good book once you get past the first chapter or two which dump you into the world with little information. Also working on my original piece of fiction, which I&#39;ve now decided to split into fourteen short stories of around 5-6k  each ending with a 10-15k longer story before going back to do the prequel. Going around revamping a couple of the characters and renaming a couple more so that their alias actually have something to do with their super power like the rest of the main cast. And reworking the second pair of Agents I&#39;ll be using, so hopefully I&#39;ll have their profiles ready soon (not that I&#39;m going to use them for a while though). <br>Madly happy after the weekend cos Chelsea smashed Arsenal 6-0 in football, practically securing our place at the top of the Premiership.  <br><br>That&#39;s about it, to be fair.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br><br></p>

            <p>Not to great at the moment. Thats why I haven&#39;t been on much. My mom  and dad just sat my siblings and I down, and my dad told us that he&#39;s been addicted to painkillers for five years now, and it came as a huge shock. He&#39;s getting help, but I&#39;m feeling betrayed, and a little lost. He&#39;s been lying to us, and it&#39;s not a good feeling. I love him, and just want to help, but I don&#39;t know how.He&#39;s never let his addiciton affect us, which is why we never guessed. He&#39;s the best father anyone could ask for, and thats why this is so hard.   But writing is helping a lot, as usual, so thats nice. I&#39;m actully looking for a new novel, so if anyone has any suggestions, please tell me:) <br>PS-Sorry fro any typos, I&#39;m using a phone keyboard <br>PPS-Sorry for the emotional rant. I hate to dump my problems on y&#39;all, I just haven;t been able to talk to anyone.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m on spring break right now and so far have had a friend spend the last two days at my house. Activities included climbing a fallen tree that extended over a creek and nearly falling in, exploring a drainage tunnel under the neighborhood lake, shooting trees with slingshots, and wrecking stuff and getting wrecked in Monopoly.<br><br>And then the same friend will be coming over Thursday, and then Friday, Saturday and Sunday will be spent at Louisville Wizard World Con! And I&#39;m gonna get to meet Matt Smith! *squeal*<br><br>Also I&#39;ve been working on both the next mission with World-Jumper and a Harry Potter fanfic that I&#39;ve had to take a break from because I was starting to freak myself out.</p>

Luckily it nearly all seems to be almost sorted by now.<br><br>I&#39;ve just started reading Jack Vance&#39;s Lyonesse books (still on the first one) and am also forcing myself to read a few badfics to be prepared in case I ever decide to ask for permission.</p>

            <p>IRL, I&#39;m job hunting, so, y&#39;know, <i>that&#39;s</i> fun. On the writing side of things, I just finished a ~25K story for the <a href="http://gabriel-bigbang.livejournal.com/">Gabriel Big Bang</a> over on LJ, and am now just awaiting the artwork that goes with it. Also, I&#39;m vaguely working on an original story (it&#39;s still in the planning stages) set in an urban fantasy universe where magical beings and creatures live side-by-side with humans. I think it&#39;s going to focus on a centaur living in the big city, but I&#39;m still working out the ideas/world-building for that.</p>

            <p>IRL, I&#39;ve had a stressful week at the army due to a variety of reasons. Having been sick for the whole prior week, I had to get back into the loop; I had to do so while doing double shifts because my partner was sick, and had to start moving things that ground to a halt while I wasn&#39;t there. It was also my grandfather&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahrzeit#Yahrtzeit.2C_Nahala">Yahrzeit</a> yesterday.<br><br>As to reading, I&#39;m reading a book by John le Carré as well as a book about military theory in the 20th century.<br>Writing-wise, my latest mission is in the beta-ing stage.</p>

            <p>In RL I have tons of kid drama. My oldest just turned 14, but my 12 year old is the one that gives me all the teenage nonsense. Then I&#39;ve also got a 5 year old who has some special health concerns that aren&#39;t that serious, but keep us at doctor&#39;s offices and therapists, and requires daily medication (I really suck at at keeping schedules, so that&#39;s difficult for me.)<br><br>But, things have settled down the last six weeks or so, so overall I am doing pretty good in RL.<br><br>I&#39;m planning on trying yet again to grow a bit of a garden this year. I can kill mums, and have failed at the garden thing...four...maybe five years running, so not entirely promising, but I haven&#39;t given it up yet! Someday I&#39;ll harvest something!<br><br>PPC-wise, I am working with Caddy to get some things finished. Between co-writes and individual things, there are eight PPC interludes or missions in varying states of completion in my Gdocs files. <br><br>Otherwise, I recently finished a 39k fanfic for Haven, and I am working on another, smaller fic for it. <br><br>I am also working on an original fiction novel that involves refugee faeries, human (faery) trafficking, a malfunctioning medieval spell, a Beauty and the Beast type plot, and true love saving the day. And it&#39;s set in the <i>extremely</i> likely (sarcasm) location of modern day Arkansas (obviously with magical elements added to it). I should stop now. I&#39;m still in that excited stage where I could ramble on and on about it. :P<br><br>For reading, other than  National Geographic and Game Informer magazines, and fanfic, I am reading a series of books &quot;The New Church&#39;s Teaching Series&quot; about Episcopalian beliefs and practices.<br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m 34. I will be 35 in June. My two older boys love hearing about the PPC. I&#39;ve read them some of the Miah and Cali missions, and they liked them.

He&#39;ll just have to work harder and that&#39;ll make him better for it, especially considering other kids who don&#39;t have to work for it. ...am I making any sense?

The school still gives all A certificates even if the A&#39;s are in resource/adapted classes, so he&#39;s been super proud of that (and so have I).  He&#39;s been really rubbing it in on the 12 year old, who is barely scraping up a C and D and occasional F grade level.

I&#39;m hoping to have it ready for beta reading before I have to go into high gear for a local gaming convention; I&#39;m running several games, including one demo for a RPG setting that won&#39;t be hitting the stores until August.  The author customized the magic system a bit, so I want to be certain I have clear &quot;cheat sheets&quot; available for the players.<br><br>Tearing apart my Shinrone gown and trying to get it to fit better has been put on the back burner.

But there&#39;s plenty of time for that, since the faire doesn&#39;t start until Labor Day.<br><br>I&#39;ve got several books in progress.  I was reading &quot;Rum Across The Border&quot; (a history book on the Prohibition era) at breakfast this morning.  I&#39;ve also recently gotten hooked on the Ciaphas Cain novels for the Warhammer 40K setting, and picked up four of them in e-format to read at work.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m focusing on finishing all the mini pages on the wiki.  I&#39;m also trying to get through certain sections of the older <i>Pokémon</i> games to get some of the Pokémon that require trades, since they&#39;re shutting down the online trade services for the older ones on May 20.<br><br>After that&#39;s settled, I&#39;ll get back to saving hard copies of every scrap of PPC writing I can find.  I&#39;ve been working on this for over a year now (what with my off time being what it is).  I&#39;ve pretty much put my own mission writing on the back burner until everything else is backed up, although I do have one already-finished mission I&#39;ll be releasing once I reach the Es in the mini project.<br><br>For reading right now, I have two books going during work shifts, depending on whether I need a book that fits in my lunch box or not.  For when I need it inside, I bring <i>The Puritan Dilemma: The Story of John Winthrop</i> by Edmund Morgan.  (It&#39;s non-fiction, but hey, it was free.) For days I can have the book sitting out, I&#39;m reading <i>The Dark Tower VII</i> by Stephen King.</p>

            <p>Could you leave the Bionicle one for me to write? As it&#39;s one of my core fandoms, I have all of the information necessary to create a mini-Rahkshi page, and I have a personal interest in doing so. I&#39;ll help with some of the others, but I plan to make Mini/Bionicle first.<br><br>Also, have you checked to see whether the Special:Undelete page works on the wiki? If it does, we&#39;d be able to isolate and remove the pages not supported by canonical links without the risk that you mentioned earlier about the pages being irretrievable in case their original author comes back wanting to use the character again. I&#39;d try to determine it myself, but the page restricts access unless you&#39;re a logged-in admin.</p>

            <p>That was a fandom that would have required research on my part, anyway.<br><br>And yes, the Special:Undelete page does let us retrieve pages in case we need them again.  Furthermore, looking through the delete log, there does appear to be precedent for deleting agent pages made before Permission was secured.  I&#39;ll go ahead and get to that Idunno-next-time-I-have-no-night-shift.<br><br>(The delete log also revealed the existence of a team of inter-wiki spam and troll deleters who nixed advertisement pages without leaving any trace noticeable to most of us at the time.

            <p>There&#39;ll definitely be some images mixed in the to-be-deleted category, too, since there are plenty of pageless images that are left unattached because they are out-of-date, replaced with better images, or simply don&#39;t work any more.

            <p>The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Candidates_for_deletion">Candidates for Deletion</a> category is now filled with redundant images, unattached images, or unneeded images, as well as sixteen pointless or unsupported articles and three redirects to those articles. There&#39;s also a continuum page for Trigun that was there when I started, but I heard on the Board a while ago someone was planning on making a mission there, so it&#39;s really up to you in that case, and the page on Agent Cold is still there, because it&#39;s been in the Candidates for Deletion category since before I came to the Board and evidently no one is quite sure what to do with it..<br><br>Once those have all been cleaned up, I am almost entirely sure that, due to the way the world works, I will discover a few stragglers that I missed and will need to start a Round Two, but until then, happy deleting!</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got three projects on at the minute.<br><br>1) My second PPC mission, concerning Luna&#39;s murder by a hack for ZOMGDRAMA<br><br>2) An <i>actual</i> fic; more specifically, an attempt to write a Rational!slashfic for a fandom I&#39;m barely part of. It&#39;s a birthday present, and I&#39;m perennially skint. As an aside, is anyone here familiar with Attack On Titan?<br><br>3) A column for my local magazine about a spoof art critic. I&#39;ve actually considered having an art historian character in the PPC as part of the support staff.

            <p>However, I only got up to about episode 7 or so before I just got bored.

            <p>Once upon a time, a young girl dwelt in euphoria and luxury, the daughter of a historical nonfiction enthusiast and a Trekkie. At some vague and unremembered age before her fifth year began, she was taught by her mother the Trekkie and her brother, also a Trekkie, of the wondrous and far-off land of Middle-earth. And this girl took up the sword, bow, and axe and departed from the beaten way, shunning the path of the Trekkie and donning the cloak of a Ringer.<br><br>The rest of this long and loquacious story can be summed up as follows: She also liked &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; and the Redwall series. At the age of twelve she wrote her first fanfiction &quot;which was - wonder of wonders! - neither a tale of Mary Sue nor too overwhelmingly stupid. Ah, for the vibrantly ALIVE OC who held no romantic attraction for any canon character. Ah, for the glory days...&quot; It was a Redwall fic and remains unfinished.<br><br>At fourteen she encountered her first honest to goodness Mary Sue (from a source not herself). She had seen parodies before, but always believed them to be exaggerated. Then, she opened the story &quot;All Souls Night&quot; and her innocence was destroyed when she realized that some people write characters like that and actually think it&#39;s okay. Not that she&#39;s never written a Mary Sue, but &quot;in a truly inexplicable phenomenon, the girl realized that this was inappropriate of her own motivation. She noted two instances of mind-bending illogic. She saw that Sam Squirrel was present in name only. She realized that her character lorded it over even other OCs as if they were her personal slaves, and in her heart some voice of goodness told her &#39;This is not right!&#39;&quot;<br><br>Then, salvation! For she discovered nothing other than the PPC Original Series. Imagine her joy when she discovered that &quot;All Souls Night&quot; was one of the fics hit by Jay and Acacia. &quot;She had nearly sunk into a deep mire of despair for the fate of that endeavor known as fan fiction when she first encountered reference to the defenders of logic and 3-dimentional characters.

            <p>Glad to see we both like Redwall. Here&#39;s a bucket of popcorn (to munch as you read or throw at Sues), a pair of 1950-something 3D glasses (they detect plotholes/Sue-stuff, don&#39;t ask me how), and a human-sized replica of Matthias&#39; sword. Good luck!</p>

            <p>As far as I know, the only connection between porpoises and plovers is the fact that they are both animals.

She was one of my favorite trolls, too. Not because of the quirk, but because she was so much fun!

I hope she does.<br><br>Wait, this was about the RP, too, and not just Homestuck! I should probably stop expositing, then.<br>I saw your reply, and SeaTurtle&#39;s, but between my RL commitments, I&#39;ve not had time to write a proper continuation to either for the last three days. I&#39;ve got stuff sitting in my e-mail inbox that was supposed to be read at the beginning of the week, too. Stupid real life, not working around what I want to be doing! (shakes fist at the sky) This should be a good opportunity to expand on my characters, though. Copernicus has never been directly questioned about his functionality before, and your post puts Lonny in a pretty new situation to him as well, so figuring out how they&#39;ll respond should be entertaining. And no, I don&#39;t mind that Lonny got hit with the hamantash. I don&#39;t think one would be hard enough to hurt him or sticky/drippy enough to stain anything, so he&#39;s not going to be mad.</p>

            <p>The universe isn&#39;t composed of lines, and you&#39;re right in saying so. It&#39;s not circles, either, despite what Caboose might have to say on the subject. It&#39;s more composed of individual moments, thrown together into whatever arrangement makes the most sense at the moment, which usually look an awful lot like universes from the inside, and whatever comes out is put together alongside everything that does exist, could exist, or would exist given a push in the right direction, all in a whole sort of general mish-mash. The universes themselves are not, strictly speaking, universes, because any given universe is not a <i>thing</i> as such, but rather a way of looking at the aforementioned mish-mash.

            <p>None of those moment-universes you mentioned are exactly the same as any of the others, because while the Multiverse Theory of Quantum Physics posits the theory of parallel universes, they are parallel universes only because in them we exist in some way shape or form that we can imagine, implying that because we have to imagine this state, it is different from the state that we exist in in our home universe.<br><br>Travel between separate universes is highly dangerous at best, possibly catastrophic to the individual. Parallel versions of yourself are to be avoided at all cost, though simple avoidance is most likely not enough to protect you from the destructive effects of one universe containing two of the same person.<br><br>However, when the realm of &quot;universes&quot; is left behind and &quot;realities&quot; is invoked, travel between them in and of itself can be safely accomplished, though with unpredictable results, particularly in the area of time spent there.

            <p>I&#39;m not sure what the contexts were in the original fandoms, but there really shouldn&#39;t be anything wrong with an alternate-universe version of a person existing alongside their otherworldly counterpart. At least I can sort of understand the logic behind having meetings between past and future selves be taboo, because interactions with one&#39;s past self might change the path of one&#39;s future in mutable-time continua. Meeting another entirely distinct and separate version of oneself wouldn&#39;t be any different from meeting a long-lost twin, or a clone.</p>

            <p>I say &quot;most of the time&quot; because there are also games, flash animations(with awesome music), interactive screens, and other points of differentiation from the rest of the medium. Also, it&#39;s conveyed in a series of large panels, usually gifs, rather than in strip format, but those panels have text beneath them, either from the narrator or showing dialogue between the characters. Sometimes there can be a lot of text for a single panel, and other times, there can be a series of wordless panels on several separate pages that tell a visual story.<br><br>It can get really complicated, but it&#39;s also really great, in terms of story, the telling of that story, and the interactions between the characters. Since the author has currently put progression on hiatus so he can work on other projects and on finishing Homestuck&#39;s last act, there&#39;ll be plenty of time to catch up if you want to. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com">It starts right here.</a> The first two acts are very slow going, but they are also the shortest, and act as a sort of indicator for what exactly you are going to be getting into. Also, several characters swear, especially the trolls, so be forewarned if you&#39;re sensitive about that.</p>

And a few other things, but they are major Act 5 plot points that I do not want to spoil.<br><br>Uuugh, I was going to make like five jokes about Andrew Hussie when you said that, but all of the good ones are in late Act 4 and beyond, and they would be the biggest spoilers! Why would you do this?</p>

            <p>Spark is non-canon, though several fansessions have adopted it as an <i>aspect</i> rather than a class. Seer of Spark, Bard of Spark, etcetera. They rationalize it as being the electrical power base, in the subdued and slightly misdirective Sburbian way that brought us Breath for wind, Hope for light, and Light for luck, which gives Spark a canon-compliant spot in the formula of mythological roles.<br><br>Honestly, I&#39;ve never enjoyed non-canon roles that don&#39;t follow the formula. Titles are supposed to be a rank or a class of being, not some random appellation someone thinks would look cool, and aspects are supposed to be both useful in application and accessible for a variety of interpretations by one&#39;s title. How many classes are going to be able to use &quot;Zen&quot;? The offensive titles won&#39;t be able to channel it to do anything, and the support classes will hardly get anything out of it that Mind and Hope don&#39;t do better. At least the ones on that list are all one syllable, save Seer, which is both a canon title and predates that part of the rule. No Machinists or Builders or Prodigies here.<br><br>Not knocking your results, of course. I just don&#39;t like most fansession tropes. Plus, your title being non-canon means you could potentially be free to reassign it to a canon role if we have a redundancy or an open space! So that&#39;s nice.<br><br>Hey, if you decide to solidify as the Space player, do you want to go frog-part hunting with me? It would be on your planet, so you don&#39;t need to worry about unfamiliar terrain. It&#39;s just lonely doing quests by myself. </p>

            <p>Well, it tied between Knight of Mind and Knight of Keys, and I decided to go with the canon-compliant option. Plus, Knight of Mind means I&#39;d have psionic powers, which is really something I&#39;ve always wanted. They&#39;d be a combatative variety, too, if I&#39;m interpreting the role of the Knight correctly.<br><br>Don&#39;t mind me, I&#39;ll be over on our Space player&#39;s planet hunting down some Genesis Frog parts while firing mental blasts at any underlings that pass by.</p>

Almost everyone goes through such a phase, and pretty much everyone looks back at their old days, flinches, and says &quot;No, your phase was <i>nothing</i> compared to <i>mine</i>.&quot; I am no different. I keep the original handwritten copy of my first fanfiction partially to remind myself that even when I think something is a great idea in my modern phase, it can always use more thought and development, because when I first wrote that... <i>thing</i>, I thought it was both coherent and hilarious, and in part because I may eventually mission it in the future, if I can manage to type it all into the computer without giving up on absolutely everything.<br><br>For your present, you get an Aslan action figure! Realistic articulation! Actual quotes from both books and movies! Real neck-chopping action!<br>What? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQhlmNeG-D0">He&#39;s voiced by Liam Neeson</a>.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m guessing that, similar to how just about everyone has a badfic phase that they grow out of, everyone has their own story for when they realize that badfic is a real, distinct issue and that people don&#39;t just get rid of it after time passes and they develop critical thinking skills. Well, not everyone gets to the second part, but most people do to some extent. Mine was from the Custom Bionicle Wiki. I&#39;m not going to go into detail, but Grod on Mars, the unoriginal or downright baffling concepts, the Mary Sues(well, Gary Stus, usually, since about four-fifths of Bionicle characters are either male or gender-neutral), the groups that only exist to one-up or displace existing groups, the unnecessary elemental powers added on for no good reason, just because nobody else did it before... uugh. Sometimes, there&#39;s a good reason why no one made a character that controls the elemental force of radioactivity or rubber, you know? And yet there was a set group of people that hounded anyone who logged on, reverting edits that made the changes make sense or tried to tie anything together, because people were <i>proud</i> of that garbage.<br><br>I made the first two or three chapters of a fic that was posted on the site, as per the tradition of the time, intending to pastiche the clichés that the site so often used, but I abandoned it before I even made it clear that it was a parody. Still, though, somewhere on that site people are slavishly protecting my account of killer robots being defeated by Skrall holding baskets of fruit, since the robots didn&#39;t recognize fruit as a weapon, and still don&#39;t realize I was making a joke. I gain some small satisfaction from that.</p>

            <p>I look forward to an update. I&#39;m thinking of dropping you a PM to put me in there... I have written down some pretty bad Doctor Who ideas and it&#39;s awesome anyway. Perhaps I could learn from my avatar&#39;s education?<br><br>I wrote a Lord of the Rings fan fiction last month in which Boromir declared his belief that Frodo meant to &quot;take the Ring to Sauron and <i>batray</i> us all.&quot; It took me a couple of weeks to catch it, and when I finally did I spent a ridiculous amount of time wondering where exactly Frodo would acquire a batray. Perhaps he&#39;s really Batman in disguise?<br><br>Anyway, the point of all that is that typos are perfectly okay... as long as you don&#39;t make a habit out of it. Sometimes they&#39;re entertaining (as PPC missions often demonstrate).<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely be watching that OFU. In fact, I think I&#39;ll go and follow it now...</p>

            <p>Wait a minute... is this why we never saw Frodo&#39;s parents? They were killed on their way back from watching a play, with only their young son there to witness their demises, too young to help them?<br>No, that would probably involve hobbit criminals, and judging by the odd moral standards of Tolkien&#39;s world, we could <i>never</i> have an evil hobbit or elf. Only orcs are bad guys, and occasionally humans and dwarves when they&#39;re corrupted by evil! Maybe we could have some <i>unpleasant</i> hobbits, but they would <i>never</i> think to rob or harm one another! Because you can construct a society that behaves like that!<br><br>...Or perhaps that&#39;s what the criminals want you to think. The idyllic perfection of their societies would be a perfect cover for the more covert and organized acts of illegality, because while it would be too obvious, too beside the norm to rob the Second Rivendell National Bank, no one would think to look too deep into the perfection of their little cities, peel back the skin to see the rot beneath, and the mess of criminal intellects driving that rot toward nefarious purpose.<br><br>Yes, I am suggesting that Bat-Hobbit would fight a dystopian elf mafia. It was too out-there of an idea to not mention when I thought of it. Can you even imagine what the elf Kingpin of Crime would look like? Yes, I know he&#39;s a Spider-Man/Daredevil villain, but I don&#39;t think Batman has a mob boss enemy, unless you count Tim Burton&#39;s versions of Joker and Penguin.</p>

            <p>It would all depend on how the events are going to be set up and executed in-story. It would also be important to determine what kind of tone you were going for with this, since there are so many interpretations of Batman and not all of them might work for the story one was trying to tell. Is Frodo going to run around in a bat-logoed outfit and purple gloves, and the story would be derived from the campy Adam West Batman? Is he going to be World&#39;s Greatest Detective Batman, finding out the secrets behind the elven mafia&#39;s history of crime, perhaps capping his discovery by dispensing justice with some well-placed punches and flying kicks? A Nolan-derived dramatic Batman? The version of Batman who always has the best gadgets? Some of those might not be mutually exclusive. I remember Adam West Batman having plenty of great gadgets.<br><br>It would be <i>difficult</i> to do well, since the temptation to make this too Batman and forget that it&#39;s still set in Middle-earth would be immense, but it&#39;s far from impossible. It would probably be best to have comedy as a central element, too, because, seriously, at a conceptual level, you are casting a hobbit as Batman. That is ridiculous, but not necessarily in a bad way, and Batman is no stranger to the ridiculous(see: 1960s TV show, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, pretty much the entirety of the Silver Age). Also, the author would probably need to refrain from introducing more than maybe one Middle-earthed version of a classic Batman villain, unless there was a very good in-story reason to have more than one. It wouldn&#39;t be good to lay the references on too thick. I can see a couple of characters that would translate adequately, like elven versions of Deadshot or Two-Face, but they&#39;d have to be tied in to the main plot to make any sense there. Maybe elf-Deadshot could be the elf crime lord&#39;s personal hitman, or something, hunting down and killing any elves that get too nosy, and would eventually become obsessed with killing Bat-Hobbit after the hairy-footed hero escapes his assassination attempts one too many times. Which is to say, once.</p>

            <p>They&#39;ve been doing licensed novels and audio dramas since the Second Doctor was still on television.

They&#39;re my favorites, though Nine had a very fun season in New Who. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=253826">There&#39;s a post I made a while back</a> with links to The Time Warrior, which is one of Three&#39;s best stories. You should watch it; Sontarans attack the Middle Ages, and it&#39;s as great as it sounds.</p>

            <p>You&#39;d think it&#39;d come up on a Google search. I just seemed to recall seeing it a month or two ago while I was looking for some other OFU.<br><br>Still on First myself. Typically, I got interested when I saw some NewWho and only recently started watching the Classics. Of course they aren&#39;t on Netflix so I have to get them from the library which takes time...

            <p>I mean, I&#39;m not going to claim I know anything about Sabrina the Teenage Witch(though judging by Iximaz&#39;s comment below, she is not very likable), but the very presence of a crossover between two unrelated works does not necessarily mean that said crossover will be bad. It all depends on the execution. If Sabrina&#39;s magic drastically overpowers anything Voyager is capable of, then it&#39;s Sueish at worst and renders the Star Trek elements unnecessary at best. If she does nothing while on the Voyager, she&#39;s inconsequential and doesn&#39;t need to be in the story. But there are plenty of ways a story could be executed that wouldn&#39;t involve either of those two options. Just saying &quot;Look! A crossover! These shows have nothing to do with each other!&quot; doesn&#39;t tell anyone anything. What is the story about? What happens in it? Do you know?</p>

            <p>If you did, then you&#39;d know that it isn&#39;t a straight <i>Sabrina</i>/<i>Voyager</i> crossover. Here&#39;s the synopsis from Amazon:<br><br>&quot;A misfired spell sends Sabrina into TV shows, movies, even books. Now she&#39;s handjiving with Travolta in Grease, storming the castle with Mel Gibson&#39;s Braveheart troops, and awaiting analysis by Dr. Frasier Crane. How can Sabrina pop into real life?&quot;<br><br>As we&#39;ve both mentioned, whether a &#39;fic is good or bad depends not as much on the premise as it does on the execution.</p>

            <p>If she immediately fits in in the new settings, that could pose some problem, but from the summaries and reviews, it looks as though not only does she not stay around long enough to affect much in the fictional worlds themselves, the skipping between worlds is presented as the conflict rather than the setup for a conflict. There could be a number of good stories told with that setup. I&#39;ve seen a few television shows that had an episode with a similar premise, and they usually tend to turn out relatively well, whether they&#39;re playing it for laughs, trying to prevent some sort of metafictional crisis, or in one particularly memorable case, trying to keep a fiction-hopping Tom Sawyer from using stolen magic to infiltrate a physics textbook and alter the fundamental laws of the universe.<br><br>That last example sounds really stupid, but <i>dang</i> was it a fun episode. Hey, there&#39;s execution-over-premise again!</p>

            <p>Even if you just give a name of the show, I would be interested. After all, I&#39;m rather invested in stories involving characters traveling into fictional worlds. If I can see what made those stories work or not work, I can alter my character(s) and stories to work better.</p>

            <p>I remember the Teen Titans animated series did an episode with the concept, and the Tom Sawyer one was an episode of the Fairly Oddparents, before its post-cancellation revival and subsequent downturn in quality.

            <p>I tried a few phrasing attachments and rearrangements of the words, and as it turns out, there is a swear word there. Take the last letter of the first of the two affected words and couple it with the first three letters of the second word. ...Yeah. No idea why it&#39;s censored even when the letters are separated by a space, but that word and any word containing the letters of the f-bomb will be replaced with an ellipsis in the site&#39;s censoring system. Maybe some other swears, too, but I didn&#39;t want to type in every offensive term I could think of to see whether the filter replaces them, because in doing so I would run the risk of accidentally missing &quot;Preview Message&quot; and hitting &quot;Post Message&quot; with a bunch of words I was testing still prominent and uncensored, and nobody wants that.</p>

            <p>Grob knows the sort of horror <i>that</i> would wreak. Oh no, it&#39;s the Attack of the 50-Foot Tolkien Trivia!<br><br>&quot;Say, did you know that before joining the Quest to Erebor, Bifur worked as a toy maker? I&#39;ve written a four-page paper on what that detail of his individual history means regarding his familial relations. Since I&#39;ve become fifty feet tall, the printout of those four pages is now large enough to crush the spine of a mid-sized woodland animal and smother a large-sized one!&quot;<br>&quot;Giant Huinesoron, no! Stop ripping sheds and small houses out of the ground and arranging them into a scale replica of the city of Minas Tirith!&quot;<br>&quot;Hey, I let <i>you</i> talk during that whole call you made to the Home Guard. I should at least get to enlighten you on the intricacies of a literary masterpiece. Now help me paint this tool shed so that it looks like the Gondorian barracks.&quot;</p>

            <p>Indeed, let us look <i>closer</i> look at the stories that started it all.<br><br>This week, in honor of the 13th anniversary of the PPC: TOS, I will begin my review series of the Stories of the PPC. I want to practice reviewing, so what better way to do so then reviewing PPC work over time? I will not tie myself down to a schedule, as my own schedual is all too hectic right now, and I guarantee I would break it before it had time to get established. However, I feel I can say that a review of the first mission ever will be out some time this week. I will post directly onto the Board, and then copy what I put there on my wiki journal. After that, I will try to review every mission or story in relation to when it was released. The wiki is going to be a valuable resource indeed.<br><br>Let the celebrations begin.</p>

            <p>Good luck. It&#39;ll be easy with the well-known spin-offs, but the first three years or so were stocked with plenty of lesser known series, containing stories that are now missing, stories that contradict one another, stories that embrace the killing-of-Sues aspect above all else and don&#39;t try as hard for originality, humor, or world-building, stories that all cropped up and were taken down so many times that it is by this point impossible to tell which spin-offs came first, and other various factors that add up to make it an odd time in PPC history.<br><br>Plus, finding and sorting all of the old missions is going to be very difficult. From all appearances, even the wiki gave up on that, dumping most of the earliest non-TOS material that its editors could find onto the Glossary because said material was too scattered, too non-descript, or simply provided too little information to make pages about. We didn&#39;t have a shared universe back in the early years, and from what I&#39;ve read, spin-offs were more or less copycats of Jay and Acacia&#39;s work at first rather than people trying to take the concept in new directions or at least tell it in new ways. Once you get to about 2005-2006 it&#39;ll start to look more organized, which sort of makes sense because I know the first Board would have definitely been around by that time, but even then you&#39;ll have a lot to go through.<br><br>Once again, good luck. There are a lot of forgotten and unnoticed stories early on, and while I&#39;m glad that someone might be bringing attention back to them for what is probably the first time in years, it will be a lot of work.<br><br>Or were you just talking about reviewing all of the Original Series?</p>

            <p>This will probably take a year, or two, or five, but my intention is to try and read each and every one. Now, if it is way too far lost, sucked into some digital void beyond any sane hope of restoration, I&#39;m leaving it the heck alone. If it is not on the wiki somewhere, I may give it a read if somebody links it to me, but otherwise, I&#39;m assuming lost to the void. If it has mention on the wiki, and a link, but the link is broken, I will try the Wayback Machine or some equivalent to find it. If that does not work, then it has been lost to the void.<br><br>Also, I will try for approximate time for release, rather than exact. If the first three years is just a giant cluster-buck of insanity, I&#39;m just going to go with the order that makes the most sense or alphabetical or something. Whatever I go with, if the date seems dubious, I&#39;ll use some simple meathod for organization. If I learn later that I was wrong and I read a story out of order, it&#39;s honestly not that big of an issue. What&#39;s important is that it gets read and reviewed at some point.<br><br>Also, this will include OFUs. No, it will <i>not</i> include every single OFU ever. Heck, I may cut the PPC stuff down for the sake of my sanity, I am not going to read even 1% of the mountain of stories credited as an OFU. I am only going to read/review complete OFUs, and even of those, only the influential ones. I may dabbe into complete, non-influential ones, but it&#39;s not looking like I will. <br><br>This is going to be tough. It may well be impossible.  I may drop it like so many other projects. But darn it, I am going to try!</p>

            <p>Just reading everything PPC (no OFUs) linked on the Wiki took me more than a year, and this was during a phase of my life when I had lots of time to read while I was sitting in the office, waiting for some work showing up to be done.

            <p>...I think Tamora Pierce does the best at creating &#39;unlikable&#39; heroines. Almost inevitably her female characters actually <i>feel</i> like real people, even when set against the fantastic worlds they exist in. I first ran across her when I was ten and I picked up a copy of <i>Alanna: the First Adventure</i> at the library. Her writing has stayed with me to this day, and I&#39;m eager to read <i>Battle Magic</i>, the newest of her <i>Circle</i> books (once my sister-in-law gets done with it, that is). Her female characters range from bad-ass lady knights to noblewomen with the ability to manipulate thread magic. It&#39;s awesome, and I love every minute of it.</p>

            <p>This writer makes some good points. Oftentimes female characters are portrayed unrealistically to make us like them, and I don&#39;t believe that should ever be done, because it does give young girls an idea of being a woman that is completely inaccurate and unattainable. Like the &quot;Barbie mentality,&quot; though that&#39;s more in the physical appearance.<br><br>However, I do disagree on a few points, first and foremost her list of characters that she classifies and &quot;likable&quot; and &quot;unlikable.&quot;<br><br>Take Elizabeth Bennet. When I first read <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> I immediately felt a connection with her, not as a character but as a person. The defining flaw that made her a real person, I think, was her willingness to say exactly what she thought. Yeah, she dressed right, she spoke with a certain level of decorum. But go back and read the chapter where Darcy proposes to her for the first time and you can see exactly what she&#39;ll say when she&#39;s angry. Also bear in mind that this is regency England; a lot of things that people said to each other then were far more scathing than they sound to our 21st Century minds. Passive aggressiveness was, I think, more subtle back then. Elizabeth was by no means the perfect little Miss Perfect this writer defines her &quot;likable&quot; characters as. Some would argue that by realizing that she actually likes Darcy and ultimately agreeing to marry him she lost this ability to say what she likes. But I don&#39;t believe so. For one thing, she said what she liked to Darcy&#39;s aunt Lady Catherine with no thought for the possible consequences. And if you observe the passive aggressiveness in her interactions with Wickham after he married Lydia (which Wickham was undoubtedly aware of, he wasn&#39;t stupid), she was still loaded and dangerous. For another, if memory serves Darcy said he fell for her &quot;for the liveliness of your mind.&quot; He could clearly still see it in her to the end. I really don&#39;t think Elizabeth is a good example of the &quot;likable&quot; characters.<br><br>My other big issue is Susan Pevensie. She&#39;s defined as &quot;unlikable.&quot; I never noticed a particular temper burst from her, or her thinking back that anything she did was wrong. Of course, she looks a bit shabby compared to Lucy, and she renounced Narnia in the end, but these are just the things that make her a real person instead of a cardboard cutout or (fates forbid) a Mary Sue. I always related to her a lot, but liked her at the same time. She stood up as a role model for me in the three books she featured prominently in. And, as Sevenswans pointed out, she&#39;s trying to be a replacement mother for her younger siblings. That&#39;s a lot of pressure, and when you think about it, she held up admirably. Take into consideration also that if you only read <i>The Horse and His Boy</i> she&#39;s the epitome of the &quot;likable&quot; characters that were mentioned earlier.<br><br>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that the author of this essay seems to be generalizing: Either a character is &quot;likable&quot; or &quot;unlikeable&quot; (which is a bit of an oxymoron anyway since the author clearly likes the &quot;unlikable&quot; characters, as characters, anyway). Everyone, including well-written characters, have both likable and unlikable traits, and whether or not a person ultimately likes them is a matter of personal preference, a bit like choosing cake flavors. An entire person can&#39;t be &quot;likable&quot; or &quot;unlikable.&quot; In real life, I know a couple of girls who I&#39;ve decided I ultimately don&#39;t really like. But they&#39;re nice, outgoing people who are always ready to talk about anything I want to. Why don&#39;t I like them? They fangirl obsessively and inappropriately (according to my subjective views of &quot;appropriate&quot;), are somewhat judgmental, and won&#39;t watch or read anything that was made before &#39;97, thinking I&#39;m silly for doing so. I don&#39;t hang out with them if I can help it because these traits grate on my nerves. <i>They still have likable traits.</i> They can&#39;t be unceremoniously shoved into the &quot;unlikable&quot; bin.<br><br>Stepping back a bit further into real life, I would like to briefly touch on the whole premise here. The author doesn&#39;t want characters in books and movies to paint an unrealistic picture of life for girls, and as I said before, I agree with that. But she seems to have this idea that more restraint and general happiness is expected from women than men. As a preemptive disclaimer, I don&#39;t think women should be expected to apologize for things that aren&#39;t their fault or any of that. But women are expected to be more calm, caring, and forgiving, which are all good traits. I do have one question: Why is she fighting to allow females to lower themselves from this level of grace and forgiveness to that maintained (or accepted) by the male portion of the world? Wouldn&#39;t society in general be improved if we instead expected men to rise to the same standard women are held to? Wouldn&#39;t we all be happier? And yes, perhaps the standard should be lowered. It is unrealistic; we&#39;re only human after all. But to borrow a quote from one Gene Roddenberry: &quot;Humans are at their best when they are stretching for new horizons, new frontiers.&quot;<br><br>(That doesn&#39;t excuse writing characters who are unrealistically &quot;likable.&quot; She was definitely right there.)<br><br>Well, there&#39;s my blurb with an opinion I haven&#39;t ever seen anyone else express. I hope you don&#39;t fault me for it. There is quite a lot of valuable truth in this essay you linked, but I felt I had to point out a couple of mistakes. I also may be misinterpreting the original intent of the essay, so I apologize if I am. So... yeah... have a nice day everyone!</p>

            <p>Yeah, dialogue in P&amp;P looses a <i>lot</i> of relevance if you&#39;re not terribly used to classic British humor, or if you have trouble with the vocabulary or imagining the tone in which things were said.<br><br>Susan, upon a second reading, was probably placed into the &quot;Unlikable&quot; category due to the fact that she took on a leadership role in the early books (and there was a boy available to take on a leadership role instead, though Peter was far less emotionally ready for it than she was,) and because she was later derided for her &quot;lipstick and nylons.&quot; I don&#39;t think it was intentional, but Lewis may have been demonstrating a contempt for &quot;fashionable&quot; young women of the fifties, or for a young woman choosing to focus for a bit on her appearance or the approval of peers. (Or it could just be Lucy being angry that Susan had seemingly abandoned them all and Narnia... according to the timeline, when all the Pevensies but Susan died, Lucy was seventeen, Edmund was 19, Susan was 21, and Peter was 22.)<br><br>I think the author here&#39;s problem in writing the essay is one of vocabulary: I took it to mean that she&#39;s agitating for more female characters in roles that aren&#39;t traditionally feminine, and highlighting that &quot;feminine&quot; roles are traditionally self-effacing, and that women are expected to more or less completely deny their ego in order to be considered adults. (Men rarely are.) <br><br>Nonetheless, a very good point is made, that male characters are rarely held to be unreasonable if they act on anger, jealousy, fear, or just plain crabbiness, and female characters are often derided if they act on these emotions, are flawed in any way or if their behavior is assertive... while they&#39;re at the same time derided if they cry, display any sort of fear, or react in a human manner. Society expects women and female characters to be a perfect blank slate that reflects whatever men want to read into them, and then goes on to mock many female characters (if written by a female writer,) for being &quot;mary sues,&quot; (often with very little justification: while there are plenty of awful popular novels out there, there&#39;s also plenty of average to good writing to find,) regardless of whether or not she fits that paradigm of demure incorruptible pure pureness, and to praise male writers if they even think to include a female protagonist, no matter how unrealistic she is.* <br><br>* Examples of that are far too many to list, but are the main reason why I couldn&#39;t get very far in the Honor Harrington series  or A Song of Ice and Fire (besides rape as a plot device): female authors who write characters like Honor get lambasted for daring to write a <i>female</i> starship captain, while Weber gets nothing but praise for writing his blue-eyed military-jacket dream girl in every series, and Martin spent the entire chapter I read having the female character he was writing think about her boobs. In my humble opinion, the majority of Martin&#39;s fame is due to the TV series and not due to the quality of his writing: he can&#39;t write a female character naturally because he&#39;s constantly reminding the reader that they have boobs. </p>

            <p>I really like the <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> series, so I want to try and defend it somewhat. Unfortunately, it&#39;s been a couple years or so since I read the first book, I don&#39;t currently have a copy with me, and my memory is utter crap, so please forgive me if I&#39;m off base.<br><br>I <i>think</i> the chapter you&#39;re talking about must have been from Daenerys&#39; point of view, and if so, that would&#39;ve been the scene where she was being dressed up in a slinky dress by her creepy older brother so she could be presented to a barbarian warlord as his bride for the purpose of forging a political alliance between said creepy brother and said barbarian warlord (who actually turns out to be a fairly decent guy, for the record). Daenerys is a very young woman in this scene. She&#39;s new to the world of having boobs, and also new to the world of having them shown off to some guy for the benefit of some other guy. She has <i>every reason</i> to be thinking about her boobs and what they mean for her future.<br><br>Daenerys goes on to take charge of her life and completely kick everyone&#39;s ass from here to next week. I love her. She&#39;s one of my favorite characters in the series.<br><br>That said, there IS plenty to discuss when it comes to how G.R.R.M. writes his women in general. It&#39;s not that there aren&#39;t plenty of tough, ass-kicking ladies with their own voices and agendas; it&#39;s more that nothing good ever happens to them (or really anyone else, because G.R.R.M. enjoys the taste of our pathetic tears). It&#39;s a particularly grim one of those medieval-ish societies where lots of the women have been/are being passed around for political or just plain carnal reasons, and G.R.R.M. does not shy from writing about unpleasant things that maybe some readers would shy from reading about. However, it&#39;s what the women manage to achieve in spite of living in such a crappy, depressing world that makes them great, IMO. Consider looking past the boobs and giving the series another shot. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I had one of the middle books - no idea who the character was. <br><br>... They never mentioned a brother, in the part I read (yes, I opened to a bunch of random chapters just to see if I liked the book, the other scenes I saw were one about mustard and a traveling scene) but I suppose it could have been Daenerys.<br><br>I know pretty much from that chapter though that G.R.R.M stands a good shot of personally annoying me if he continues to write so many extremely body-conscious heroines. However, I don&#39;t know a lot about the series other than what&#39;s been spoiled at me, and I&#39;m probably not going to actively look to read or to know more of it due to trigger issues, now that I know more about a couple of the characters, so there&#39;s that too. *Shrugs.* I can&#39;t judge the series as a whole, but the parts I read (which did not sound like the character was as young as I&#39;m pretty sure Daenerys was supposed to be,) severely annoyed me by the time I reached lines about how the character thought about how her breasts swung as she walked.<br><br>Personally, as a lady with ladybits, that degree of forcedly sensual body consciousness sounds pretty fake - a young teen would be more awkward, a mature woman would be more used to her body.<br><br>... I did try very hard to read Honor Harrington, though, and got through two books on the strength of the plot. I might come back to that some day, or more likely to the Safehold series, though Nimue is basically a mini Honor with  a different mission.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t realize you weren&#39;t talking about the first book. In that case, I may have been making stuff up. ^_^; I mean, the scene I mentioned happened, but I don&#39;t know if she was actually thinking about her body in it (though it wouldn&#39;t surprise me, given the circumstances). I also don&#39;t know which chapter you actually read, or who the POV character might have been.<br><br>I guess I&#39;ll just add that, as a fellow lady with lady parts, female characters dwelling on them doesn&#39;t bother me. I&#39;m comfortable with my parts, and do think about them as circumstances warrant, so it doesn&#39;t strike me as unbelievable for female characters to do so. Plus, if the character is a sensual character (was it Circe? was she naked at the time?), it could well be in character for her to think about her body in terms of sensuality. If it turns you off, it turns you off—and it definitely can get a bit much for anyone at times—but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite fair to judge the author&#39;s ability to write women based on that one point.<br><br>I have no idea who Honor Harrington is, I&#39;m afraid.

            <p>If it&#39;s what I think it is, it&#39;s from the second book. Daenerys have been asking the merchants of Qarth for help to take her throne back and the refused her. While petitioning them she was wearing a traditional Qarth dress which left one breast exposed. Later on she&#39;s back in her own clothes and feeling much more comfortable.<br>I remember reading a review/opinion piece basically deriding GRRM for thinking that women were thinking about their boobs all the time, and mentioning that very chapter as proof. I picked up the series anyway and when I finally got to that part, I thought the reviewer had totally taken it out of context.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I have no clue who the character was (she was going to some sort of political meeting, and I kept thinking that she&#39;d better start concentrating on bargaining for monetary support instead of thinking about whether or not her boobs were staying in place.)<br><br>Meh, I&#39;ve got no use whatsoever for my female anatomy, so I tend not to think about it until it gets in the way. :D (I think, looking back, that part of my irritation could have been with the people who told me to read the book - I read over some scenes after a bunch of guys on the trip said &quot;oh, G.R.R.M is the only fantasy author who&#39;s even capable of writing female characters!&quot; ... To which my reply was &quot;boys, I&#39;ll be the judge of that,&quot; while they continued to demonstrate their extreme ignorance of fantasy as a genere, or that there <i>were</i> any female authors who wrote fantasy that wasn&#39;t firmly shelved in the kids&#39; section.)<br><br>... I didn&#39;t like the moments of extreme body consciousness in <i>Sabriel,</i> now that I think of it, but they didn&#39;t last as long and happened pretty infrequently, so I got around it.<br><br>Honor Harrington is... about a war fought by a space navy, and Honor is a starship captain and a tactical ace. However, Weber falls into ruts pretty easily with her, repeating characterization and description pretty much word for word, which gets a little tedious. I wouldn&#39;t recommend reading the Honor Harrington novels all at once if it becomes tedious, and you&#39;ll probably need the wiki even if you read them all in a row. There are a <i>lot</i> of them. I liked the first two okay, but there&#39;s a limit to how many space battles I can read without them all blending together a bit. :D</p>

            <p>I think one of the reasons the author kind of put her in the likable category is because she&#39;s measuring the fans responses to the book and her character. In the series itself she may be considered &quot;unlikable&quot; but most of us readers fall instantly in love with her is because of her sense of independence, her intelligence and her wit--moreover how she manages to defy the expectations of her society while constantly having to live in said society. <br><br>A lot of women identify with her which is why she&#39;s considered to be one of the most iconic heroines in literature. What OP might be saying is that we like characters we identify with and from that sense of identity we create a list of criteria. Unlikable female characters step outside of that criteria and into unfamiliar territory. Sometimes they react in off ways that put us at odds with those expectations. I actually know a character like this myself and at one point, I made the mistake of calling her a Mary Sue because of it. <br><br>She had a tendency to react in extremes--very emotionally unstable. She was really strong; strong enough to cross that line of &quot;Badass but not too badass because that&#39;s threatening&quot;. She wasn&#39;t a badly written character by a longshot but because she stepped outside of that paradigm I unwittingly created, I just didn&#39;t want to like her. <br><br>What I kinda took from the essay is that being a &quot;likable&quot; female character is about conforming to those expectations readers have. Lizzie is likable because she&#39;s balanced and she straddles the lines the author mentioned:<br><br>&quot;Nice, but not too nice.Badass, but not too badass, because that’s threatening.Strong, but ultimately pliable.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s not a bad thing by any means but some people in this world are just so...out there. Characters too. They don&#39;t just cross the line--they take leaps and bounds straight on over it. Like, they&#39;re there own plane of existence and quite possibly--very alien, very off-putting for the rest of us. Like Sherlock. Except the fandom of BBC Sherlock is absolutely enthralled with his character, though it begs the question; would that still be true if Sherlock was a woman instead of a man? What are the chances that if Sherlock was in fact a woman, she would fall under that list of &quot;unlikable&quot; female characters? <br><br>I like to write about female characters that think and react in extremes--I&#39;m not as good at it as I&#39;d like to be but its just a lot of fun to write them. I think what OP is trying to say is that these kinds of characters are just as important as the &quot;likable&quot; characters and that their stories need to be told as well. <br></p>

            <p>I was going more with the author&#39;s original commentary on what constituted a &quot;likable&quot; female character - one that fit in with the standards of what she as a woman had constantly told was acceptable behavior in a woman who wanted to be liked by other people. <br><br>However, you&#39;re right: the fandom adores Lizzie Bennet. (One t, two n&#39;s... do we even have a mini for that? Perhaps a mini english bulldog could be invented for the works of Jane Austen and the Brontës, where we don&#39;t really have any fantastic creatures to choose from.) However... the fandom <i>also</i> adores some of the characters she&#39;s put in the &quot;unlikable&quot; category with almost as little reservation. I doubt Lizzie was subjected to unanimous approval by readers when Pride and Prejudice was published. Lizzie Bennet does not challenge today&#39;s ideas of a woman&#39;s role in society, but she was a challenge to women&#39;s roles when she was written.<br><br>I think we need <i>enough</i> rounded female characters that we feel comfortable not liking some of them, instead of feeling obligated to support them because they&#39;re, you know, ladies who aren&#39;t damsels in distress or completely incidental to the plot. These kind of heroines, that you&#39;re free to like or dislike, are fairly common in children&#39;s novels and novels written for female YA audiences (for example, I greatly disliked Pippa in <i>A Great and Terrible Beauty,</i>) but aren&#39;t as common in &quot;mainstream,&quot; fiction.</p>

            <p>It just could have been worded better in the essay, I guess. By her definition of &quot;likable&quot; I thought Jane Bennet would have been a better example. But if I&#39;m not understanding her correctly, then this all makes sense. Thanks for pointing it out.</p>

            <p>Personally, I&#39;ve never really noticed that with men, though I&#39;ve never been looking. Also, my reading pool is somewhat limited; until recently I&#39;ve only ever read books whose authors are currently dead.<br><br>My brother once told me, &quot;It&#39;s hard for us [men] to see a woman as anything other than an object for sex.&quot; (He is rather fond of the Honor Harrington series.) I can see how this would stand in the way of a male author to write a believable female character. But I think it works the other way too. I have a great deal of difficulty writing believable male characters because I have trouble seeing past how they physically look. (Though I&#39;ve never really dedicated any time to them thinking about their personal bits. I don&#39;t spend any time to speak of doing that, so I assume they don&#39;t either.)<br><br>And then, of course, there&#39;s the other end of the whole spectrum. In my original fiction, there are two female characters who fall into the &quot;traditional gender role&quot; of staying at home waiting for the men to return and prepping bandages. I&#39;m absolutely terrified that I&#39;ll get put down for writing female characters into a traditional gender role (I&#39;ve already heard it from a couple people).<br><br>The point of that is that many people are as adverse to people daring to put females in a traditional gender role as a non-traditional one. No matter what you end up doing, there are gonna be some people who are gonna hate it. (How do you think the LotR movies&#39; popularity would have been affected if Arwen had stayed in Rivendell and made Aragorn a flag like she did in the book instead of riding out to save Frodo?)<br><br>As for the idea that feminine roles are self-effacing, I don&#39;t agree with that at all. People may not notice, but that doesn&#39;t reduce the importance of the roles. Take my example of bandage prepping. All the men go out to a battle and the women go too to put more female characters in non-traditional gender roles. Battles being what they are, there are lots of injuries. After the battle, everyone goes home, and there is no medical care ready to go for all the critically injured people who are bleeding to death because no one stayed to do this important task. (Heaven forbid the men should stay, but that&#39;s beside the point. <i>Someone</i> needs to do it.)<br><br>A note on something I said above; I&#39;m not saying no men can write believable females: C.S. Lewis, after all, was a man, and I immediately related to all his females. I think they were believable characters with realistic problems.<br><br>Are there any examples of male people calling a female writer&#39;s female character a Mary Sue? &#39;Cause in my (admittedly limited) experience, this is done just as often by women (often to provide some justification to separate her from her love interest). Rose Tyler from Doctor Who has often been called a Mary Sue. The only times I&#39;ve ever seen it is when fangirls are trying to get their OC close to the Doctor, which they accomplish by bashing Rose.<br><br>I&#39;d like to correct something I said in my earlier post. I said that Elizabeth Bennet doesn&#39;t fall into the &quot;perfect little Miss Perfect&quot; category, and claimed the writer defined her &quot;likable&quot; characters like that. Upon further reflection, I have determined that this is inaccurate. She defined her &quot;likable&quot; characters as &quot;unobjectionable.&quot; Raise your hand if you found anything Elizabeth Bennet did objectionable? *Entire cast of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> raises hands along with me.* My point stands; she&#39;s not &quot;likable.&quot;<br><br>I still hold out that the solution to all this is not to lower the standard for women, but raise it for men. Certainly we should change our attitudes somewhat, given what you said about &quot;female characters are often derided if they act on these emotions, are flawed in any way or if their behavior is assertive... while they&#39;re at the same time derided if they cry, display any sort of fear, or react in a human manner.&quot; Of course we all have to understand that women are people, and hopefully female character should emulate that. I would even go so far as to say that the standard should be changed (not lowered, changed). But instead of just as a society accept women acting on emotions like anger and jealousy, wouldn&#39;t it be better to expect men not to, since very few results of these emotions are good? I mean, imagine a world where no one acted out of jealousy. I don&#39;t think we could ever achieve it, but we could try. And maybe lowering the standards for women wasn&#39;t the author&#39;s intent at all and I&#39;m just reading that into it. I apologize if I am.<br><br>And if it&#39;s a matter of men&#39;s female characters being valued over women&#39;s, well, the only thing we can really do about that is teach as many people as we can to view characters as objectively as they can. Anyone with the first lick of sense will realize that if a female character spends an entire chapter thinking about her boobs, she has a long way to go as a character.<br><br>Anyway, this is all very superfluous. I meant I saw your point about the vocabulary thing. The writer of the essay seems to have a solid enough grasp of what she&#39;s talking about (as solid as mine, anyway), but she could have chosen better words to say it than &quot;likable&quot; and &quot;unlikable.&quot; Someone pointed out that &quot;likable&quot; characters tend to be boring. Thus, by default we all like the &quot;unlikable&quot; characters better. Perhaps &quot;societally pleasing&quot; and &quot;non-traditional&quot; should have been used, or something to that effect. And of course, I&#39;m not dictating what anyone should believe on the topic. She&#39;s welcome to views that are different than mine.</p>

            <p>... What I&#39;m getting out of this article is that fandoms often dislike heroines who fall somewhere between Black Widow (displays few emotions, kills lots of stuff,) and someone like, say, Jane Bennett, who is squeakily, shinily nice to everyone and has pretty much no self-direction whatsoever. Male characters are in general cut more slack, even if their behavior <i>isn&#39;t</i> realisitic for their situation.<br><br>Interesting, though, that the author defines &quot;likable&quot; as such a lukewarm accomplishment - note that conforming to feminine stereotypes won&#39;t actively achieve anything for you, under this definition, just supposedly protect you from other people&#39;s disappointment and rejection.<br><br>Speaking of individual characters:<br><br>Elizabeth Bennett: okay, I&#39;ll give that she conforms to the standards of her society, but she&#39;s the heroine because, unlike her older sister Jane, she does actually deploy her snark against people and defy some expectations. Jo March, likewise, was written during her time intentionally to cast off feminine stereotypes. <br><br>Meg Murray&#39;s not a great example in the works of L&#39;Engle for the type of heroine the author describes, except maybe in later books which focus on her daughter Polly, when Meg has dedicated her life to raising her many children. Vicky Austen or Meg&#39;s mother, Katharine Murray, are better examples: Katharine is a sort of domestic goddess, who is depicted as 100% selfless, and able to easily make groundbreaking forward strides in biology while cooking for her husband and children over a bunsen burner in her lab. Vicky is a poet who clashes with her far more ambitious younger sister and who is relied upon to be the stable caretaker and secondary mother for the younger siblings, and the emotional anchor for her elder brother, who spends most of her adolescence making his life, or her parents&#39; lives, easier. Her reward is not to achieve literary eminence, but to be married off to her first high school sweetheart, despite the number of times she gets mixed up in the weirdness of time and causality in the L&#39;Engle universe. Unlike Meg or Polly, she does not take an active role in shaping her destiny or that of her family: her choices are <i>all</i> about domesticity, supporting her friends and siblings, and which of her love interests will make a more suitable husband.<br><br>Matilda also isn&#39;t a great example of &quot;likeability&quot; in the context of this essay: the proper one would be Miss Honey, who lives a life of demure poverty because she can&#39;t stand up to her aunt. Matilda, on the other hand, has resorted to petty revenges to get back at her neglectful parents - any demureness on her part is mostly a facade.<br><br>I&#39;d still say that the four above are, on a sliding scale, more traditionally feminine or at least compliant than the other heroines mentioned, and that they do exist on or near the unrealistic line drawn in the sand for society&#39;s expectations of women. I also think it&#39;s interesting that most of the heroines who are allowed to be difficult are comparatively young: <br><br>Amy March, the youngest of the Marches, spent most of Little Women having her behavior corrected until she became demure and ladylike enough to win the approval of their rich elderly relation (and eventually Laurie, though I won&#39;t get into that.) <br><br>Mary from <i>The Secret Garden</i> was &quot;civilized,&quot; through becoming a devoted supporter of her male friend and learning to conform.<br><br>Lyra did not become a conformist as such, despite having a love interest and the implication that young love determines the shape of your soul, which is one of the main reasons I like her so much. She matured without becoming demure or ladylike: she learned to pick her battles so that she could fight them all the harder.<br><br>Susan surprises me that she&#39;s in this category, but then I remembered that Susan is set up to fail throughout the Chronicles of Narnia. Despite the fact that she superficially conforms to society&#39;s expectations of a young woman and that she plays the mother role throughout the Narnia books, she&#39;s always going to come second to Lucy&#39;s incorruptible pure pureness, and it&#39;s mostly because she is stepping up to fill the role of their absent parents in earlier books and attempting to carve out an identity of her own in the real world in later books. Jill Poole might be a little more straightforward of an example: she deals with plenty of her own selfish decisions, but she and Eustace are equals in their books, and she&#39;s shown as trying very hard to stand up for herself in the midst of a rather awful school in the beginning of <i>The Silver Chair.</i><br><br>Hermione also changes and gets transformed into a more socially conforming girl in later books (book four&#39;s beautiful all along moment comes to mind,) but she actually gains moral complexity along the way too. Like the Murray women, she&#39;s a complicated example because she represents the female intellectual.<br><br>Hang on. I&#39;m going to go write an essay on this now.</p>

            <p>On the author&#39;s original spectrum, she does avoid conformity (she runs away because she&#39;d rather not get married,) and she&#39;s allowed to have a temper and even to make enormous mistakes in the story. On the other hand, the girls in Narnia are all judged solely by whether or not they become devoted believers in Aslan, and she gets converted <i>hard</i>. <br><br>Obviously, Aravis is no where near Lucy&#39;s incorruptible pure pureness, but she doesn&#39;t get the same engineered failure that Susan does just for going out and trying new things, and I&#39;d say she falls closer to the author&#39;s original definition of &quot;unlikeable,&quot; since she&#39;s got a temper and an opinion and isn&#39;t afraid of voicing either.<br><br>Actually, there&#39;s a whole class of heroines - Aravis, Eilonwy, most of Lloyd Alexander&#39;s other heroines, Lyra Belaqua, Meggie Folchart from <i>Inkheart</i> - who represent a paradigm that we don&#39;t see as often with adult heroines. They get to have flaws and short tempers and make mistakes and win arguments and fights against their male friends, and save their brothers and fathers and friends, <i>because</i> they&#39;re young, and they don&#39;t yet represent any idea of the ideal woman. Their tempers are often seen as something that they will need to grow out of, or moderate to some degree, but since they&#39;re at their oldest in their early teens, they don&#39;t automatically get disapproved of by the author or readers for not being demure and self-effacing.</p>

            <p>May it be telling that all the heroines I recognize (Mary, Lyra, Susan, Hermione, Katniss and Scarlett) are listed under &quot;unlikable&quot;, and I like most of them? Except Scarlett; I hate Scarlett, but at least she isn’t boring. If I ever knew a &quot;likable&quot; heroine, she was apparently forgettable.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I think the only real flaw with the article is that the author makes a false equivalency between &quot;complex characterization&quot; and &quot;she&#39;s unlikable&quot;. Granted, she does use her own definition of &quot;unlikable&quot; for her purposes, but it&#39;s still strange to hear her talk about characters as &#39;unlikable&#39; just because they happen to have a quality that doesn&#39;t make them a goody-two-shoes. To my mind, there&#39;s a big difference between &quot;this character is complex and may not always act properly because that&#39;s how people are&quot; and &quot;this character is nasty, mean, short-tempered, and all of these things are to such a degree that you want to strangle her half the time&quot;.<br><br>Thankfully, I get the feeling that she&#39;s also partly aware of this distinction, &#39;cause in the &quot;unlikable&quot; heroines list she does list people in the former category rather than the latter. So I get what she&#39;s going for: this is basically a call for more complex female heroines who aren&#39;t always demure and apologetic, and especially of heroines who aren&#39;t afraid to define their own lives independent of the expectations of others. And really, what&#39;s so wrong with that? I&#39;m sure we could use a few more ladies like that, y&#39;know what I mean?</p>

            <p>That may well be true... but it&#39;s the central thesis of her (?assuming from the &#39;claire legrand&#39; name) argument. Quote:<br><br>&#39;for my purposes here, I’ll define a “likable heroine” as one who is unobjectionable.&#39;<br><br>Or in other words:<br><br>&#39;I will define &#39;likeable&#39; as &#39;boring&#39;, then list some characters who are not boring and claim that they are unlikeable and that you should like them&#39;. The problem here is that she never made the connection that people <i>don&#39;t</i> like them. I&#39;m not saying that her argument is necessarily wrong, nor that it&#39;s right - she&#39;s discussed two issues and failed to link them.<br><br>For my part, I preferred <i>Graceling</i> over <i>Fire</i>.<br><br>Oh, also:<br><br>&#39;And, I would add, these parameters seldom exist for heroes, who enjoy the limitless freedoms of full personhood, flaws and all, for which they are seldom deemed “unlikable” but rather lauded.&#39;<br><br>I also preferred Hermione Granger over both the &#39;likeable&#39; (ie, uncomplex) child Anakin Skywalker and the &#39;unlikeable&#39; (ie, complex) adult Anakin Skywalker (as portrayed in the films).

            <p>Personally, my problems with child Annakin were partially the lack of complexity (he&#39;s supposed to be what, about nine during the Phantom Menace,) and partially that he was more a plot device than a character. <br><br>My problems with grown Anakin were that he was a smug, manipulative and narcissistic young man who then graduated into wide-scale murder, entered into a relationship that I have to characterize as manipulative, obsessive and creepy, and his portrayal in the prequel trilogy completely undermined his supposed redemption as Darth Vader in the original trilogy. <br><br>But getting back to the original point of this topic, I&#39;ve just thought of something: Padme is portrayed in the prequels (at least once she becomes a love interest) as surprisingly passive. She&#39;s allowed to physically defend her own life and Annakin&#39;s, to be a queen, and to help take back her own planet, but her practically non-existent opinions are always taking back seat to our three strong male Jedi. She isn&#39;t allowed to take initiative <i>unless</i> one of them approves it. <br><br>It&#39;s Anakin&#39;s wishes and Anakin&#39;s problems as a Jedi that define their marriage. (Much is made of how he is in so much pain keeping their relationship a secret, but when she says that <i>she</i> can&#39;t live that way her feelings get brushed aside because, well, he&#39;s a Jedi. No attention is paid to how <i>her</i> life is going to change now that they have a kid - sure, she&#39;s rich and taking care of the infant won&#39;t be a problem, but <i>Anakin&#39;s</i> struggle over all this is the only thing touched on by the plot.) Padme&#39;s decrease in competence and the ability to voice her own decisions is also directly tied to the point where she becomes a love interest - as a fourteen year old queen, she and her body double physically infiltrated a castle, shot things down, and faced down battle droids. As a twenty-something senator, she&#39;s relegated to a damsel for Anakin to rescue, and she no longer gets to question Obi-Wan&#39;s plans like she questioned Qui-Gon&#39;s in the first movie of the trilogy.<br><br>Weirdly, considering the time gap between the original and prequel trilogies, Leia is allowed to be a much more complete character than her mother - she voices opinions all the time, forms plans independently of her brother or her love interest, leads battles, discusses strategy, doesn&#39;t apologize for calling Han out, and her relationships with Luke and Han are completely independent of how Han and Luke get along. Not to mention, she shoots things, befriends the Ewoks on her own, and kills Jabba the Hutt with a chain. She fit&#39;s the author&#39;s definition of an &quot;unlikable&quot; woman, since she&#39;s assertive to the point of being verbally abrasive, and her great plan to rescue Han ends with her captured by Jabba the Hutt. (Which nobody ever blames her for, I should point out - Padme is blamed in Phantom Menace <i>and</i> Attack of the Clones for failed plans, with at least one person saying that she should have stayed in the ship.)<br><br>... All right, that was a tangent.</p>

            <p>Though I think the reason for the false-equivalency may have been OP parroting some of the collective climate in fandom towards certain &quot;unlikable&quot; female characters. Sansa from Game of Thrones comes to mind. She gets so much hate for being &quot;weak&quot; &quot;stupid&quot;  &quot;whiny&quot; and &quot;childish&quot;. It bothers me because people forget that she&#39;s only 14. She is a child trying to navigate in an unforgiving world full of adults who seek to use her for their own gain. <br><br>I personally think Sansa is a great character in a wonderfully human way and I&#39;ve never really understood the weird trend on sites like tumblr where characters like her that are &quot;too emotional&quot; are detestable female characters. <br></p>

            <p>Its funny that a lot of people defended the movie and its characters as &quot;empowering&quot; when in fact, the movie itself tries (and on some level fails) to make fun of those very same people. <br><br>You know how the movie was marketed to a generally male geek demographic by showcasing hot girls dressed up in different costumes to represent various fetishes of &quot;kick ass&quot; female characters in geek culture complete with explosions and videogame-like fantasy settings?<br><br>Well I find it interesting how these scenes were woven in to the actual movie. We all know how the movie tried to show us how Babydoll&#39;s regression into that fantasy was supposedly a metaphor for her &quot;fighting back&quot; against this male oppression but the interesting part is when the fantasy ends and Babydoll is back into her second &quot;brothel&quot; fantasy all of the guys in the movie are reduced to stunned drooling idiots like some of the guys in the movie&#39;s audience. That really wouldn&#39;t mean anything if the dudes in the movie doing the staring weren&#39;t portrayed as the bad guys Babydoll is trying to escape from. <br><br>Its interesting because the first fantasy is that of the brothel sequence where in order to earn her freedom Babydoll has to dress up in different costumes and perform different dances to pander to the corrupt, sleezy male baddies and have her gang of girls rob them while they&#39;re in a drooling stupor over her moves. In the second fantasy she&#39;s doing the exact same thing although this time--she&#39;s pandering to the male-geek demographic audience the movie was marketed to. She&#39;s playing everyone in the audience by using that mindset of &quot;b-b-but even if these girls are super super hot and in fetishizing outfits its still okay because they&#39;re super strong so that makes them empowering right? Right?&quot; against them. <br><br>And she doesn&#39;t succeed (much like how the movie didn&#39;t in adequately conveying said message). She&#39;s lobotomized and reduced to a vegetable and the other girls who followed her are dead too. The only one who lives is Sweet Pea. The &quot;big sister&quot; of the group and the only one who bothered to criticize Babydoll and wasn&#39;t impressed by her dancing because she saw it shallow, impersonal and an empty attempt to stimulate the male audience. <br><br>This is kinda what I saw after watching this movie with some of my male friends for the second time while trying to piece together the purpose of weaving three, seemingly disconnected fantasy sequences into one movie (because I literally had nothing better to do at the time). I still didn&#39;t think the movie was that good and that I would want to watch it again. <br><br>The title though was beautifully relevant. </p>

            <p>The movie takes itself way too seriously at some points so even though I feel like I got the message--I still found it a tad bit disingenuous. I mean it really should have gone for something decidedly more tongue-in-cheek satire if it wanted to make its criticisms of its audience better known.</p>

            <p>So a few days ago I started a thread on things I didn&#39;t like about shipping, This thread will hopefully be in a more postive direction. What works in a good shipping story? What is a good trend? What makes you turn into little piles of fan goo?<br><br>For me personally I like stories were the relationship is equal. Both people can stand on their own as individual characters , they have their own strengths and flaws, put them together and they balance each other out.<br><br>A good example is the more well written USUK I&#39;ve found over the years. America is there as moral support for England, Arthur talks Alfred out of his more stupid ideas.<br><br>I also prefer short fluffy fics that explore charcter to stories with plot but that&#39;s just me.  </p>

            <p>I have my OTPs, which are ones that I either think are sort of canon or could have been canon, and my challenge pairings, which is everything else.<br>For my OTPs I like having them in character, or as much in character as they could be, considering them being together would drastically change the canon in any way ( ie. John/Sherlock being together at the beginning of Series three). I also like vamplock/winglock/[insert spn thing here!lock] AUs, but only if both characters are of the type, or at the very least they are on equal footing.<br>The &#39;challenge&#39; pairings are everything else, ones that will definitely never be canon but are fun to write. A great example would be Tim McGee/Tony DiNozzo, or Kirk/Spock/McCoy. I like these to be as in character as possible.<br>I don&#39;t really like Omegaverse type fics, but that is mostly because of the fact that it is often used as an excuse to write dub-con (which personally isn&#39;t my cup of tea for various reasons), but I&#39;ve found one or two good ones.<br>I also have a massive soft spot for soulmate AUs...</p>

            <p>Across multiple fictions, you will find many characters with too similar goals, or characteristics, or even desires. Having them interact, whether competing, cooperating, or even discussing it excites me. Them ending up in bed is just one way to climax the fanfic, so to speak.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not really into romantic stuff, but some of the books I&#39;ve read have had romantic subplots that fit in very nicely--not wedged in sideways, but growing naturally from who the characters are, and how they interact with each other. In these stories, romance is one of many things going on, and it serves a purpose in the plot, to show the reader more about who they are. Sometimes it creates complications when someone can&#39;t keep their wits about them because they&#39;re too in love; sometimes it means that the romantic relationship gets tangled up in the career or the quest and makes things more difficult. Sometimes it makes things easier because people who are in love can support each other and back each other up, just like close friends or siblings would.<br><br>I don&#39;t like stories that focus entirely on the relationship, as though that&#39;s the only thing going on in the characters&#39; lives, like everything but the couple is either an antagonist trying to break them up, or else no more than scenery. That&#39;s ridiculous and unrealistic and, even without any particularly bad writing, is very likely to cause me to find something else to read. Romance in a living, changing environment, where it&#39;s only one of many things going on, though--that can be pretty cool.</p>

            <p>I like fics where the characters stay in-character. <br><br><b>Fangirling warning</b><br><br>Right now I am really liking Duke/Nathan shipfics in Haven. They have this weirdly intense relationship in canon. They spend most of their time saying they hate each other and intentionally saying things to jab at the other&#39;s insecurities. But then, when one of them is hurt or in trouble, they drop everything and run to help. <br><br>In one early episode, Duke was dying of rapid aging, and Nathan (who is definitely the angrier party) had this entirely different tone of voice (gentle) and all these familiar little mannerisms and touches to comfort and help Duke through the day. (The touching is significant, because Nathan literally cannot feel touch, temperature, or pain, so touching is a very conscious thing for him. He doesn&#39;t touch people or allow them to touch him very often). And then there are these <i>looks</i>--especially from Duke--when he thinks no one is going to see them that are just <i>pining</i>. The UST between them is intense.<br><br>They have yet to reveal more than a few extremely sketchy details of their life together before the show started, but one thing they did say is they&#39;ve known each other since they were 5, so they have 30 years of history to explore (and I am standing firm in my headcanon that they have at least slept together, and probably dated at some point), and I&#39;ve about fallen in love with fics that cover that history. Even though I know whatever their history together, and at some point it had to have been good to give them that level of intensity of emotion, you just don&#39;t get that intense with people you don&#39;t care about, it obviously ended very badly, given their starting point in the show. <br><br><b>End of fangirling</b><br><br>Well, basically I love any fic in any genre and any fandom I read that covers backstory, it&#39;s just that those two obviously have <i>so much</i> backstory--both in time and significance. <br><br>I also like a good AU that shows people in a different life, but still being themselves. There is one about Clint Barton and Phil Coulson where Clint never left the circus, Phil never joined SHIELD and they still met and ended up together. Or one in that alpha/beta/omega dynamic--which I don&#39;t normally like, but this fic actually called it on all the horror that it would cause when applied to real people. Anyway, it was a Supernatural Cas/Dean fic with that alpha/beta/omega dynamic as the horror in the world instead of the demons and monsters that are the horror in the show. All the characters were absolutely spot-on in-character. All of the messed up family dynamics and history was there. It was not a nice fic, but it was very true to the show.<br><br>I like slice of life fics, fics where one party is comforting the other or they are both comforting each other, fics where they have to deal with unusual or unexpected circumstances, and fics about characters after they are done saving the world or whatever it is they do. <br><br>Okay. Now that I think about it, I read a lot of melancholy, depressing, violent, and sad stories. Stories that explore the limits of human endurance and the extremes of emotions and psychological resilience. I do like stories to end with hope though. I&#39;m not sure what all that says about me. :P </p>

            <p>Or pseudo-canon pairings, such as Sam/Jack from Stargate SG-1 (I have a particular weakness for this one). I say pseudo because it was obvious they liked each other, though they never got together.<br><br>I greatly enjoy stories that show on any level just how much a couple really love each other, canon or not. This often involves conflict to some degree, but I&#39;ve seen a few good fics where they&#39;re just hanging out in the break room or nearest environmental equivalent.<br><br>And you can almost always get me with a story where one party gets in deep trouble and the other has to go and save them, although this particular story occurs as often in a friendship situation as a romantic one. Either&#39;s cool with me, as long as there&#39;s drama and adventure.<br><br>As for the fan goo, I love a story with a well-done Faramir/Éowyn element so much I could just cry. Except I don&#39;t, but I <i>could</i>. It doesn&#39;t even have to be the main point of the story, as long as it&#39;s there.</p>

            <p>The best ship fics, in my opinion, go on to explore exactly what the consequences of said ship are, especially when those consequences are negative. I remember one fic that shipped Rarity and Pinkie Pie, and then went on to consider what this meant in regard to Rarity&#39;s career, as well as her realistically showing what her emotions about the whole relationship would be in the first place.</p>

            <p>Fluff. I&#39;m overly fond of fluffy oneshots (for established canon pairings, mostly, because I don&#39;t spend the fic going &#39;wait, what?&#39;). The best ones obviously stay in character and aren&#39;t overly sappy. Actually, in one of my most favorite shipfics, the pair never interacted at all. <br><br>It was absolutely hilarious: It started off with Tonks filling out papers in the auror&#39;s office and a fellow female started asking her if she had any plans for the evening. Tonks had guard duty for the Order that night, but she obviously couldn&#39;t say that, so she said she had a date. Of course, her colleague immediately wanted to know more, and Tonks inadvertently began describing Remus when her colleague started asking for details. When the colleague wanders off to finish her own work, Tonks gets back to her papers and signs it- and then she realizes she signed it <i>Nymphadora Lupin.</i><br><br>Fluff for couples who have a tragic ending make me ridiculously happy before I remember what happens to them and I promptly burst into tears. If a shipfic can make me do that, it&#39;s good to me. :3</p>

            <p>While I am adverse to most fan pairings, the ones I do like are ones where the characters&#39; tastes and personalities harmonize well.<br><br>Let&#39;s take the popular Rarity/Fancy Pants pairing for example.  Both love high-class gatherings and fashions.  Fancy Pants likes Rarity a lot, and his opinion her doesn&#39;t change after he finds out that she is from the small town of Ponyville.  Rarity enjoys his company not only because he likes her, but also because while Jet Set and Upper Crust may sneer at the other Mane Five, Fancy Pants is a gentlecolt and treats her friends with respect.  He doesn&#39;t car what class another pony is, and that makes Rarity like him all the more.  <br>  They are also foils for each other.  She is very dramatic and excitable while Fancy Pants is cool, calm and collected.  For me that is an ideal pairing.  </p>

            <p>I was imagining that something much worse had been said. Not to say that what <i>had</i> been said was acceptable, because it certainly was not, but I&#39;ve only heard of the Nameless Admin interfering directly(in ways that don&#39;t involve the removal of spam or other Board backwash, at least) a handful of times, and I&#39;d projected that him or her getting involved in this case would imply the presence of something <i>really</i> nasty. Instead, it was just a supremely insensitive word in capital letters in the subject line. A little anticlimactic, given what I&#39;d expected, but it definitely makes sense that the action was taken.</p>

            <p>If you truly wish to know, you must travel to the distant lands of Wechi. There, you must find and tame a wild ypur, on the edges of the ancient stampede grounds. The truth you seek is located near that place.<br><br>That said, I can also offer you some comments: The Nameless Admin is one of us, and has been with us for a significant period of time. I&#39;m afraid I cannot provide attribution to this quote - I want to say it was hS, but I&#39;m not certain: &quot;Admins make great janitors and terrible dictators&quot;.<br><br>Thus why The Nameless Admin uses an alias - it allows them to show up and clean up the Board when it needs it, and makes people less likely to immediately associate them-the-Boarder with admin powers, and thus authority. It&#39;s more of a legal fiction than a closely-guarded secret.</p>

            <p>&quot;12. The PPC community is kid-, family- and work-friendly — make sure it stays that way. That means no cursing, no graphic violence, sex or whatever. If you feel you have to break this rule, please give a specific warning (and remember, just because you don’t have a problem with something, doesn’t mean others won’t). The PPC shared universe is also kid-, family- and work-friendly, but in this case the rule is to warn for anything that raises your rating, rather than necessarily cutting it out.&quot;<br><br>I.E nothing of telling people who have just returned (and who are probably excited to see what has been happening) to watch their language or go. That violates Article 7, which reads;<br><br>&quot;7. If someone says something that seems offensive, but you’re not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. Astonishingly enough, most people aren’t out to offend anyone. (If they are being deliberately insulting, believe me, you’ll have a lot of backup.) Don&#39;t be afraid to ask what someone meant- it isn&#39;t silly to want the full facts.&quot;<br><br>I.E if someone breaks the Constitution, don&#39;t jump down their throats by telling them to leave. This also breaks Article 9, which reads;<br><br>&quot;9. The PPC as a community is responsible for upholding the Constitution. If you see someone breaking any of the rules and guidelines herein, please ask them to stop (politely- remember Article 7!) and explain why. If this doesn&#39;t resolve the situation, you will be backed up - and if it continues, a persistent rule-breaker should be shunned or asked to leave. (If you&#39;re being accused of breaking a rule, take a step back and, if you are in the wrong, stop, apologise, and move on. Grudges are no fun!)&quot;<br><br>I.E warn breakers of the Constitution <b>POLITELY</b> that they are breaking the Constitution.

DrMarble was not being offensive for some reason that would allow an opportunity for explanation or rationalization. The message was three words long, and the swear word was used as an unneeded attachment to a message that would have meant the same thing without it. If the swear word had been removed and an apostrophe had been placed between the I and M of the first word, the message would have held the same meaning with nothing being lost and both proper grammar and further sensitivity gained.<br><br>Article 9 is less easy to refute as being attached to the situation, since it does concern reactions to someone breaking the rules, but while Phobos was not being polite, he was also not being disproportionately mean. Careless use of bad language should come coupled with a warning to cease that bad language, and if Phobos wanted to go at it from the angle of &quot;you just got back here, and you&#39;re not going to be an acceptable presence if you keep talking like that&quot;, he&#39;s within his rights to do so. Again, this is the selected article most connected to the situation, since it is likely that there were more polite options that could have been chosen, but none of them would have been as direct and effective(save the supremely direct actions undertaken by the Nameless Admin, of course, but I doubt that Phobos and the Nameless Admin are the same person, so he would not have had that power).</p>

            <p>...but the college I might be attending next year is in Worcester, which, IIRC, isn&#39;t too far from Boston. My ability to go there depends on several factors (financial aid and my fear of commitment being two predominate ones, seeing as it it&#39;s my top school), but if I do end up going there, I would definitely find a way to get myself to a PPC Gathering in Boston. <br><br>And part of the reason I love the school is because I love Boston - I went there for a summer program through my church and I got to basically live there for three weeks. Before the program started, my family visited MFA and well, if we meet up there I would be quite excited. <br><br>So that&#39;s a definite maybe. If I can go to the school, I will get myself to the MFA for a PPC gathering.</p>

            <p>My far-from-canon agent pulls a kitten out of a convenient plothole (because no one has mentioned where all these kittens are coming from) and places it on her head. Then, she acquires a second kitten and throws it at y2k890&#39;s unnamed non-canon agent.<br><br>Not allergic to adorableness, but I&#39;ve got a kitten on my head. Which is awesome.</p>

            <p>&quot;What is the big bad unnamed agent doing to you? I should have them charged for animal cruelty!&quot; She paused. &quot;Unless you&#39;re a Cute Animal Friend.

Hm. Why do our colleagues throw animals at people? Well, other animals, the only exclusion being myself and any other Time Lords in residence.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No! No, we are not doing that dance! You <i>shot</i> a <i>kitten</i>!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mrowww.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... What was that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Iunno - oh. Huh. Um, Notary, I... I don&#39;t know how to say this but... I think this kitten is staserproof.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see. I shall requisition further small arms for more in-depth testing-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nuh-uh! I&#39;mma name you Doctor Fuzzleton! You&#39;re gonna be on TV with all the boys and girls, aren&#39;t you, Doctor Fuzzleton? Whozza good lickle theoretical physicist den. Izzums?

            <p>Or more accurately...<br>Apollo ducked, a smile on his face as he did so, for behind him, stood Kelly.

            <p>Rina barely managed to intercept the kitten mid-throw before it hit the unnamed agent.

            <p>Ari yelped as a kitten hit her full in the chest. &quot;Wow, ok.&quot; She stumbled backwards, biting back a yelp as her leg gave out under her. &quot;Augh...&quot; She glared ineffectively at the kitten, who had dug claws into her (thankfully thick) clothes. </p>
