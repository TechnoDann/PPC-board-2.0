            <p>Now and then a newbie posts a link to their first mission report and asks for beta readers. This happened at least twice since I joined the board last year.<br><br>I intend to add the following to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Beta_reader">the wiki’s beta reader page</a>:<br><br>Since it is only visible for a limited time and nobody ever looks further down the board, you will not get many readers through a link on the board, but this is considered to be publishing nonetheless. You probably don’t want to be humiliated by having all your failures discussed in public, and for some beta readers it may be difficult to be honest when they know that everybody can see what they only want to say to you. Thus, do not link to your story when you ask for beta readers, but give the boarders enough information so that they can decide whether they are able and interested to beta read this.<br><br>Potential beta readers will respond to this request, telling you their e-Mail address or other ways of private communication. (Don’t ask me. I’m old and not aware of recent developments in communications technology.)<br><br>You then contact the selected beta reader(s), providing them with an address to send their feedback to. If you have a shareable document, you can just send them the link. (There is also the old-fashioned method to send commented and edited versions of the document to and fro.) You may want to enable commenting for everybody who can see your shareable document (who, at this time, are only your beta readers). Thus, rather than sending you long e-mails quoting the document to point you to where their comments apply, your beta readers can attach comments to selected parts of your document, and you can answer to the comments if further discussion is necessary. When the last cycle of beta reading, commenting and editing is finished, you can hide/remove all comments, disable commenting and then proceed to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Posting_New_Mission_Reports">posting your mission report</a>.<br><br>There is also a way to get the attention of potential beta readers who do not check the board every other day: look their e-mail address up on the wiki’s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Beta_Reader_Directory">list of beta readers</a> or on the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Beta_Readers">beta readers category</a>. (These are also the places to go if somebody responds to your beta request on the board, but assumes that you already know their e-mail address or can easily find it on the wiki.) <br><br>You may not be comfortable with e-mailing a stranger out of the blue, but since they put their address on the list or on their user page just for this purpose, we may assume that they are not uncomfortable with this. But be prepared to be rejected or never get a response at all; there is a lot of outdated information nobody dares to remove because there is still a chance that an inactive boarder may return. Try to contact persons who fit your requirements (e.g. know the continuum) and who you have seen at least occasionally on the board not too long ago.    <br><br><br>Since I’m not an experienced writer or beta reader myself: what did I get wrong?<br><br>Any objections?<br><br>Any suggestions how the existing text on this page should be changed to fit this in? My take on this: switch the last two paragraphs of the existing text; remove the last sentence (“Alternatively, you can contact someone listed in the PPC Beta Reader Directory”); add the new paragraphs at the end. <br><br>Also, I think there should be a link to the beta reader page in the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a>, probably in or close to the sub-division “Where should I post my completed missions?”, and also near the top of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Posting_New_Mission_Reports">Posting New Mission Reports</a>.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Sounds good to me. What about sharing a Google Doc with the person who volunteers to beta-read? That works great for people who use that service a lot (like me or Herr Wozzeck) and have Gmail/permission</p>

            <p>Seconding what VM said; I think it&#39;s definitely a good idea to put this idea forward more. I think your proposed text is a little cumbersome, and it&#39;ll need a clearer bridge to get from &quot;we offer beta services&quot; to &quot;posting a link on the Board is considered publishing,&quot; but unfortunately I can&#39;t help with that right now. I&#39;m checking in from a hotel room, and I&#39;m going to be signing off and going to bed pretty soon.<br><br>I also think it would be a good idea to educate people on how to be good beta-readers (i.e., reading it once, pointing out the most obvious SPaG errors, and saying &quot;good job!&quot; doesn&#39;t <i>quite</i> cut it). There was a seminar for betas proposed at one point, but unfortunately it never happened due to time constraints and people leaving. I&#39;m not sure how many of the people who were involved in that are still around, or who still has the time and interest.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it looks like I&#39;m actually the only person from that group who&#39;s still noticeably active. I might be able to get it going again, but I dunno.<br><br>Anyway. Beta-reading really only requires that you have eyes (or an extremely good screen-reader, I guess), that you&#39;re good at recognizing what&#39;s actually on the page rather than what your brain thinks ought to be there, and that you&#39;re not afraid to offer clear (but polite) critiques. (My fatal flaw as a beta... okay, the first one is procrastination, but my <i>other</i> fatal flaw is a tendency to ask rhetorical questions when I should just say &quot;this part was confusing because XYZ; here&#39;s how it could be improved.&quot;) Explaining the problem clearly is very important, as is being able to suggest a solution whenever possible. Sometimes you won&#39;t be able to put your finger on it, though, and saying &quot;I don&#39;t know, it just feels off&quot; is okay. Being able to notice and compliment things that were done well is also useful, and unfortunately, few of us have that skill. We should all strive to improve our skill at giving positive feedback.<br><br>One important rule that I learned from my editorial internship is that you never give a &quot;correction&quot; based on your personal style preferences; you should always have a sound, objective reason for making a correction. I refer to the Chicago Manual of Style as my ultimate authority, since that&#39;s what I was taught, but most style guides agree on most things that come up in fiction; they only differ greatly when it comes to citations, which aren&#39;t an issue here. You&#39;ll definitely run across differences in British vs. American vs. Canadian vs. Australian usage (and more, no doubt), so learning to spot those is important. You&#39;ll pick it up as you go, but when in doubt, always consult a reliable source. (I&#39;ve occasionally found good style guides for different parts of the world on university websites.) Also, always doubt. If you can&#39;t suspect yourself of being ignorant or mistaken, you can&#39;t learn, and you can&#39;t help anyone else learn.<br><br>As a writer, when I&#39;m looking for feedback, I always want to know how my writing is affecting the reader--did the funny parts make you laugh? did the sad parts make you cry? when the agents got hurt, did you worry about them? etc.<br><br>As a beta, though, I typically can&#39;t focus on that sort of thing until the SPaG and other distracting mechanical issues get cleaned up. That means I need at least two read-throughs to do my best job, one to proofread, the other to edit for broader issues like characterization, pacing, consistency, etc. If I find myself reading for content without getting distracted the first time through, that&#39;s a compliment to the author&#39;s technical prowess.<br><br>Sometimes the writer won&#39;t agree with your suggestions on the broader issues (and they should always be suggestions; see above note about personal preference vs. actual rules). This is okay. The beta is never responsible for the final form of a story. It&#39;s up to the writer to participate actively in the process of making their story as good as possible. They can and should pester you for explanations if they don&#39;t understand, or for feedback on a particular topic if you&#39;re not giving it. If they take a back seat and blindly do everything you say without understanding it, or if they argue and/or blow you off and do whatever they want even if you were right, there&#39;s nothing you can do about it and it&#39;s not your fault.<br><br>You probably already knew or suspected a lot of that, but I hope I&#39;ve said some things that help. I&#39;ll keep finishing the full workshop on my radar, but I can&#39;t promise it&#39;ll happen anytime soon.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It may be too subjective for a proper wiki article, but I think it will help others as much as it helps me, and it can be tweaked to fit the wiki style later, when you find the time.<br><br>Yes, I guessed much of this. I wouldn’t have thought of consulting style guides (wow, that’s professional). What bothered me most was: I obviously shouldn’t try to write the authors story, but how far can I go with suggestions, or should I only point out the problems? I also wonder whether too much feedback may be a bit overwhelming and may scare newbies who didn’t expect that this would become so professional so fast. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>That will be in a more formal style, more suitable for adapting to a wiki article. Or, there&#39;ll be the option of simply linking to it from the article.<br><br>Hm, I didn&#39;t mean to come off overly professional, or to suggest that a beta needs to be like a professional editor. I say &quot;check a style guide&quot; for grammar/punctuation/regional usage in the same way I would say &quot;check a dictionary&quot; for spelling and definition, just to make sure you&#39;ve got it right before you tell someone else what to do. {= )<br><br>I think the amount and type of feedback the writer can take is something you should discuss with them before you begin. I should&#39;ve mentioned, discussing expectations with the writer is something that should always happen before you start. Some people need and respond well to really blunt corrections, others need gentler handling. Sometimes they&#39;re okay with you simply making corrections, other times they&#39;ll want you to make a note of everything so they can make the changes themselves. If they think they may be overwhelmed with lots of corrections/suggestions, you might want to take the process in stages—maybe divide the story up into chunks of a few pages each, or do different types of feedback in different sessions. Whatever works.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure how to answer you with regard to how far to go with suggestions. I can&#39;t think of too many situations in which I&#39;d personally make a suggestion if there weren&#39;t a problem at the root of it. Maybe you&#39;re thinking of a  situation where what the author has is good, but you think it could be <i>great</i> with some changes? In that case, I&#39;d say tell them if you can explain the whys and hows of it, but of course they may not agree with you. For instance, IIRC, the betas for &quot;Ring Child&quot; didn&#39;t think we needed the end sequence in FicPsych, but Tungsten and I decided to keep it for long-term character development reasons. Still, I know I&#39;d want to hear about it if my beta thought my story could go from good to great. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

In the first story I am planning a mission for, the author continues to write &quot;her&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, even though the rest of the story is in first person. This happens a total of twenty- eight times, and sometimes in the same sentence as the first person material. <br><br>What usually happens with that?

            <p>I don&#39;t see any reason they would make copies of their reports for other departments.  It only matters that the mission got done.<br><br>If another department wanted to see the report, they could probably get a copy, but I think that would only be in extreme cases.  Like, &quot;I want a copy of that report because I heard they blew up an entire fleet of Daleks with a bottle-rocket, and I don&#39;t believe it.&quot;<br><br>Contacting other departments in an official capacity is usually just asking for back-up or advice.  Floaters is probably less likely to ask another department for help than most, however.  They should be able to get back-up from within Floaters, due to the diverse nature of the department.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>...there&#39;s a slot in the six-day schedule where one DoI colour team is assigned to... well, assigning badfic to agents. The concept is not mine: I noticed that Joe wrote about two DoI agents in their RC reviewing fics and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1-GcEQa0-EczvbrIzqCo7gUoZFmzMngbwU85a3KuYzPM">assigning them to particular agent pairs.</a> I built on that idea and introduced Spy ranks and colour teams from that.</p>

            <p>Well, I might not get around to writing down this story, but here&#39;s a brief description.<br><br>Hue&#39;s fiction of origin involves a Mary-Sue copycatting Rainbow Brite and somehow declaring Yoda as her Murky.  Hue has been at the PPC for a while, and someone else finally cleaned up the mess from that mission, which included finding the Sue&#39;s talking horse, Chroma.<br><br>Chroma is traumatized from wandering Dagobah&#39;s swamp alone.  Hue calls in a bunch of favors to find a My Little Pony goodfic.  Then he&#39;ll rescue Chroma from FicPsych, erase her memories, and replace them with those of a background pony before leaving her in the goodfic.<br><br>It&#39;s a noble quest, but he still needs to be punished for breaking the rules.</p>

            <p>I was thinking that they were going to try rehabilitation and recruitment while leaving her memories intact, and Hue knew her well enough to see that the mind-wipe would eventually be the most humane outcome anyway.  Basically it&#39;s a shortcut around making her suffer for months.<br><br>I was thinking that the disguise generator was powerful enough to turn her into a pony.  If that&#39;s not the case, the only thing I can think of is to make her forget she can talk and send her to movie!Oz.  Or if they can change her coat color to something natural, send her to Narnia.  Oh, after thinking about it, I know a bunch of old cartoons that can tolerate an intelligent horse with magenta fur, though the turquoise mane might be a bit much, especially if that&#39;s not a broadcast-legal color.<br><br>One idea for the story is that a nurse owes him a big enough favor to be convinced to help him.  Also, he&#39;s in Despatch, so he would have access to and training on the field version of the equipment.<br><br>I&#39;ll keep thinking about it.

            <p>I take exception to the notion that they&#39;re so incompetent and/or cruel that they would let someone go on in agony for months if there were a simple solution and the patient were in a position to consent to it. They do have Bleepproducts on hand; and failing that, they do keep neuralyzers around; and if pressed, they could probably wrangle someone from the Potterverse to perform a memory charm; and if a real stretch were required, they have a psychic on staff who could theoretically apply a memory block if she were allowed to remove her Sue-tracking anklet long enough to avoid getting in trouble for using powers unnecessarily.<br><br>My point is, they are in the business of helping people—they don&#39;t need to be <i>convinced</i> to do it—and they have the resources of the entire multiverse. Also, I don&#39;t think this is stated anywhere obvious, but they&#39;re not fans of agents recruiting characters who can&#39;t hack it in the PPC and would&#39;ve been better off neuralyzed and left to assimilate with their home canon. There&#39;s absolutely nothing I&#39;m aware of to suggest that they wouldn&#39;t be all for doing what was best for the patient. {= /<br><br>~Neshomeh<br>Infrastructure Anti-Defamation League</p>

            <p>Quite simply you&#39;re trying to shoehorn &quot;grimdark&quot; where it has no business being. This isn&#39;t that kind of setting, and (most of; let&#39;s allow for people who came from places like 1984 or 40K) the people who live there, Flowers or otherwise, aren&#39;t that kind of people.

Not at all, but there&#39;s &quot;let&#39;s take stuff a little more seriously&quot; and then there&#39;s &quot;everything is unrelenting darkness and pain and angst for ever, no matter how much I have to twist the nature of the setting and the characters within.&quot; We really don&#39;t want that second one, and besides, not all Flowers are alike and I suspect they&#39;d take exception to your implication otherwise. :P</p>

            <p>What you&#39;ve given us are not examples of Grimdark.  They are examples of Drama.<br><br>Are these examples darker and less funny that what we usually do in the PPC?  Absolutely.  But there are moments of lightness in the first example, between Cindy and Ilraen.  There are moments of triumph and overcoming impossible odds in Gestalt Therapy.<br><br>Even my own Catastrophe Theory stories, which are probably better examples than either of the above, have some humor and lightness in them.<br><br>That sort of thing doesn&#39;t happen in Grimdark stories.  Everything is dark and tortured.  There is no lightness.  There is no triumph.  And that is the point of the style.<br><br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Nowhere is it forbidden to have stories that&#39;re a bit more serious (except Sedri&#39;s words on the wiki&#39;s mission guide, I suppose...), and of course the dynamic you want where a lighter character is paired with a darker, more grim one is fine, but the sticking point is how you&#39;re going about establishing that. Aside from the fact you&#39;ve got drama and grimdark confused as Phobos just pointed out, you seem to be twisting or misconstruing the methods and purpose of the involved departments just for the sake of enabling melodrama; it might be better to take a couple steps back and reevaluate what you plan to do here.<br><br>Besides, I don&#39;t think a cartoon horse is really the best fit for this kind of story.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m viewing this as the difference between war veterans and the people they come home to.  Only veterans can truly appreciate what it was like.  Other people can only acknowledge that shell-shock is a real thing.<br><br><br>They&#39;re not being incompetent or cruel.  It&#39;s like trying to help a suicidal person.  You can spend years trying to help them out of that dark place, but every once in a while, all it does is lead to living longer in hopelessness.  Without knowing ahead of time that they&#39;ll never be right enough to live, the compassion of helping them can be viewed in hindsight as unkind.<br><br><br><br>I could turn the story into an argument between Hue and the Psych team.  Completely destroying Chroma&#39;s memories and turning her into a new person would be like killing her.  Compassion on their side would be trying to save who she is first.  Compassion from Hue&#39;s side is accepting the inevitable quickly.  <br><br><br>I could end with Hue being yelled at for doing the wrong thing.  I don&#39;t get enough opportunities to use the word reprehensible.  <br><br></p>

            <p>That does make sense.<br><br>However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to assume that no one in FicPsych is a veteran, to continue your metaphor. People come to the PPC from all walks of life, fictional and non-fictional. I don&#39;t know everything about the background of all the nurses, and the one I know best, Jennifer Robinson, wound up in the PPC partially due to suffering something of a cosmic identity crisis. If she can&#39;t relate to wandering lost and alone in a strange country, no one can. (That said, she would also hold out against more aggressive measures as long as possible, but she doesn&#39;t have anything like ultimate authority in the department. There are at least five people ahead of her in seniority.)<br><br>And even if none of them count as veterans in this case, they <i>do</i> have extensive experience in working with emotional trauma of all sorts, and being in the PPC, which routinely neuralyzes random bit characters without so much as asking their permission first, they ought to be very comfortable with the idea that people don&#39;t have any kind of right or requirement to hang onto badfic-induced memories, <i>especially</i> if they&#39;re competent to express that they don&#39;t bloody well want them. Perhaps putting the problem in terms of gender reassignment would be more apt: it&#39;s a person&#39;s prerogative to say &quot;even though I have X body part, that&#39;s not me, I don&#39;t want it, and I should be able to change it if I choose.&quot;<br><br>Though, you know how Bleeprin works, right? It selectively represses bad memories, leaving the person&#39;s personality entirely intact. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so popular. Granted, I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s ever tried using it on a cartoon horse before, but that&#39;s something to keep in mind before you decide a total mindwipe is necessary.<br><br>Also, are you aware of the herd of horses, led by <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Alice">Alice the <i>meara</i></a>, that lives in the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Courtyard">courtyard</a>? Integrating her with a supportive surrogate family there would certainly be on FicPsych&#39;s radar.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So...<br><br>I have some stories I&#39;d like beta&#39;d. Seven, to be precise. Details below. I&#39;ve never used Google docs before, but from what I hear it&#39;s really convenient, so that&#39;s how I&#39;d like to do this.<br><br>Story #1: Redwall<br>Title: Once a Warrior<br>Summary: How does former Abbey warrior Martin react when an old enemy appears on the path in front of the Abbey?<br>Other: It sounds like this should go longer, but I&#39;ve no intention of continuing it. Even now I&#39;m having second thoughts about writing it, so a second opinion is valued.<br>Rating: PG, for threats of violence and what have you.<br>Especially Looking For: Clarity. I&#39;m not always sure if I said what I meant.<br><br>&quot;Story&quot; #2: The Lord of the Rings<br>Title: The Land Called Imladris<br>Summary: A poem about the life and death of Aragorn and Arwen<br>Other: I&#39;ve been working on this for nine years, you heard me right, nine years, and there&#39;s still something just a little off about it.<br>Rating: PG, for character deaths and whatnot<br>Especially Looking For: Someone who can help me with word choice as it applies to rhythm (I think)<br><br>&quot;Story&quot; #3: The Chronicles of Narnia<br>Title: The Fall of Charn<br>Summary: Jasmine led her troops up the palace stair, Jadis&#39; eyes flashed at her fearless dare. &quot;Vict&#39;ry!&quot; cried Jasmine, then &quot;Vict&#39;ry!&quot; with force. &quot;Aye, vict&#39;ry,&quot; quoth Jadis, &quot;But not yours.&quot;<br>Other: A free verse poem that sort of (?) rhymes. Contains Christian implications, so either be okay with that, or be Christian, I guess? Also, be okay with haphazard &quot;rhythm.&quot;<br>Rating: PG, for nonviolent (?) death<br>Especially Looking For: Help with word flow (Is that a thing?)<br><br>Story #4: The Chronicles of Narnia<br>Title: Two Worlds<br>Summary: After she returns from Narnia the first time, Lucy considers the similarities and differences between it and her own world.<br>Other: Also contains Christian whatchama. A really short piece I&#39;m considering regretting.<br>Rating: G<br>Especially Looking For: Organization and comprehensibility<br><br>Story #5: Homestuck<br>Title: The Derse Escape<br>Summary: Dirk is caught and trapped in a cell on Derse with an ill Roxy, who is worsening by the minute.<br>Other: I&#39;m regretting this one already. I started writing a somewhat angsty piece &quot;to see if I could.&quot; The only reason it&#39;s up here at all is because I spent an entire road trip on it.<br>Rating: PG, for violence and some things that may produce nasty imagery (of the sort of gory variety)<br>Especially Looking For: Characterization and speech patterns for Dirk, Jake, and the Condesce, among others<br><br>Story #6: Homestuck/Redwall crossover<br>Title: The Gods We Can Never Know<br>Summary: Crossover with Redwall, and one of the more bizarre things I&#39;ve ever written. The universe they created was the universe containing Mossflower. Over the years they have been forgotten, but fragments of tales remain.<br>Other: Yeah, yeah, bizarre, I know. But I really think it works. Inspired by <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/449083">this piece</a><a>.<br>Rating: G<br>Especially Looking For: Someone to correct my horrid attempts at poetry and poetic descriptions<br><br>&quot;Story&quot; #7: Homestuck<br>Title: Dreams of Gold<br>Summary: The Prospitians reflect on their Dreamer.<br>Other: A school assignment. The assignment was to write a poem in three verses and then write it backwards. The challenge was making it so it still made sense backwards. It was incredibly stupid, but I&#39;m pleased with the poem that came out.<br>Rating: G<br>Especially Looking For: Someone who can help me with concrete word choices<br><br>So there&#39;s all my stories. All are complete and ready for betas at this point. And I&#39;d just like to say, the more the merrier! Thanks in advance.<br><br>And Did You Know™ that the Greek letter we get our word &quot;beta&quot; from is actually pronounced &quot;vee-tah&quot; in Greek?</a></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got a little piece from the Cafeteria Kitchens, and I was hoping to get it glanced over before I put out a link. Anybody interested? Canons of interest include: PPC (major), Fairy Tales (minor), and Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Shivering Isles (very minor). The piece is currently sitting just shy of 2000 words, and probably needs a stronger conclusion, but it&#39;s a pretty simple one.<br><br>If anyone&#39;s interested, contact info for me is just my username here at gmail.com.</p>

            <p>As a matter of interest, I have a question about the black market in the PPC. <br><br>I was reading some DIA missions, and read up on the list of Forbidden Substances on the wiki, but I haven&#39;t been able to find anything about weapons or machine parts that are strictly not allowed. Have I simply missed them, or is that something that has not been explored yet?</p>

            <p>NBC, in this context, stands for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical agents. Dirty bombs, weaponised viruses, stuff like that. However, there&#39;s stuff from other universes that&#39;s just as bad, if not worse, that we keep around - as was mentioned elsewhere, DOGA&#39;s got Sun Crushers lurking somewhere, and planet-cracker WMDs are almost a necessity for them when you consider the fact that their agents may get called to a sci-fi setting. Normal agents getting their hands on them, however... not so much.<br><br>The things that I think would most be frowned upon, though, are the ones with an obvious detrimental effect on the operational effectiveness of agents. This obviously means certain drugs are cracked down on more than others. Soma&#39;s the one Sea Turtle mentioned, but euphorics and hallucinogens of any kind would probably be considered Not Cool by the Flowers. Other stuff, however, is probably fine, particularly fictional stimulants like Red Eye and Eye Candy (what is it with people and eye-droppers?) from Cowboy Bebop and the Command And Conquer games respectively.<br><br>Hope that helped! =]</p>

            <p>&#39;Course, three of my four Action agents were recruited from badfic, so I guess there&#39;s a probability curve at work somehow. You were referring to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill">Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill</a>, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Gall_Bonecrusher">Gall Bonecrusher</a>, and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Derik">Derik</a>. For the latter two, links to their recruitment missions and interludes can be found on their wiki pages in the &quot;Recruitment&quot; section under &quot;Mission Logs.&quot; Ilraen only has the interlude part, since the mission was never finished, so you&#39;ll find that as the first entry under &quot;Mission Logs.&quot;<br><br>The aforementioned sections are generally good places to look for a given agent&#39;s recruitment story, if they have one. If not, their first mission may discuss their recruitment, though the detail will vary. If you&#39;re looking at a mysterious character, their origin may not come up until later in the spin-off. For some characters, it may not come up at all.<br><br>There doesn&#39;t seem to be a list of recruitment stories at this time, so if you want to compile one, that would be cool. The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category%3ABadfic_Characters">Badfic Characters</a> category might be a good place to start looking. For non-badfic characters, you may find the wiki&#39;s search bar helpful, though not all hits are good ones; I just took a peek myself. Otherwise, I guess you&#39;ll just have to do a lot of reading, which is no bad thing. I&#39;ve often been surprised by what I find in places I never would have thought to look.<br><br>For general guidelines, that depends a bit on where the recruit is coming from, but basically the procedure is this:<br><br>1. Convince person to join. Incentives may include threats (e.g. &quot;your other choice is dying when this fic ceases to exist&quot;), bribery (e.g. &quot;so, you like weapons and hate Sues, huh?&quot;), and outright lies (e.g. most recruitment pamphlets/ads found in World One), though probably not all at once.<br>2. Provide transport to HQ.<br>3. If necessary, take them to FicPsych; otherwise proceed to step four.<br>4. Get them to the Marquis for processing and assignment.<br>5. Training of some sort may be assigned. If not, proceed to step six.<br>6. The recruit is assigned to a department and RC. They are now an agent and should go meet their partner.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. The wiki is also useful for looking up the proper spelling of agents&#39; names. {= P</p>

            <p>okay, so, I&#39;ve come up with a plan on how to do the proposed &quot;worst badfic ever&quot; idea. we make 5 fics, each named the worst xfic(eg:worst suefic) ever, and throw every demented, insane , canon violating, you get the point, Ideas we have into these fics, and then mission them. the only rule with whatever disgusting idea is used is that one still has to be able to make fun of it(we don&#39;t want to create another subjugation), so it can be missioned. &quot;tropes&quot; I&#39;m looking for are:<br><br>thirty sue pileup(not literal,more like 10 will do)<br><br>extreme squick(for the worst smutfic ever,but not to subjugation levels.)<br><br>implausible pairings(self explanatory,only for the smutfic)<br><br>everyone OOC(this is still a fanfic,so we have to have canon characters,preferably at all character replacements)<br><br>extreme canon violations(try not to adhere to canon rules at all for this)<br><br>now,for the universe. for the suefic I&#39;m thinking about using twilight as the base canon before having a sue(or sues) that travel across the universe corrupting everything with her aura of smooth. <br><br>so, what do you think? should we do this? it could possibly replace emergencies as large events,but if you don&#39;t like them, you can still do this. besides,writing missions or HQ shenanigans has to get boring eventually. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know Twilight that well, I should probably learn.<br><br>Can one of the Sues be a unicorn that is also a vampire?  Its coat will sparkle like diamonds in the sun, and a hematophagous unicorn would be very creepy.<br><br>I think that they should run into another continuum that is known for vampires, and cause those vampires to turn into Twilight vampires.<br><br>How well-known is anime!Hellsing?  Anne Rice vampires would probably be happy at the change.  I might not read Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula, but there was a good movie made and I can look up Cliff Notes.</p>

            <p>I think that this fic should take a normally sweet female charcter, and make her into a horrible backstabbing bitch/ and or a sexually active girl who Our Sue makes a habit of slut shaming. Like those God awful House of Night books where then main hero bitches about every other female, except the ones that will answer to her every whim. Also make sure to let the audience know your charcter is gay by having him talk about it every 5 seconds.           Look<br>          I realllly hate House of Night, sorry for venting.</p>

            <p>I love that book. You need to read it. Mina Harker is a badass; that is all.<br><br>Perhaps the imaginary fanbrat who wrote the fic has read &quot;Dracula&quot;, but completely misunderstood it and believes it is a story of the tragic downfall of a noble vampire lord. Oh, and Renfield obviously loved Dracula at one point and has been driven mad grieving over his lost love, because every good badfic needs bad slash.</p>

            <p>Gratuitous rape is never, ever, ever OK and never even close to being funny. Just... no. Trivialisation isn&#39;t OK, either. I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t be OK with something parodying trivialisation of the Holocaust, for example, even if I&#39;d have known in advance it&#39;s just a parody, because that&#39;s a damn serious subject. And it&#39;s not even something that happened to me; imagine how someone who went through, for example, child abuse, would react to a parody of trivialisation of child abuse.</p>

            <p>Goes without saying, I suppose, that what you&#39;re going for is a parody fic that&#39;ll make the reader laugh.<br><br>A reader who&#39;s totally grossed out or traumatized--in real life, not in the pretend way you might be if you were writing an MST--won&#39;t be having fun. Which means, if you were to include trivialized rape, etc., you&#39;d go against the point of writing a parody.<br><br>Trivializing rape and abuse is not-funny and I don&#39;t think it could really be made funny. There are some exceptions, technically: black humor (ex., M.A.S.H), ridiculing a scary and horrible thing by using humor (ex., The Producers), or in a context that&#39;s long-established as making fun of everything, appropriate or not (ex., South Park). All of those contexts acknowledge the horribleness of the subject matter to some extent.<br><br>What I think would be funniest, would be to write the parody in such a way that the reader can laugh at its badness--to evoke ridiculous mental images, to make the reader realize that absolutely impossible things are happening in the story. Bad spelling and grammar should be used for a reason--not just to make it look badly written, but to &quot;accidentally&quot; create images that&#39;ll make the reader spit their coffee onto their keyboard.<br><br>IMO, one allowance can be made for trivialized murder: If writing an over-the-top Battle!Sue, having them kill off an army of &quot;bad guys&quot;, while implying that the author has absolutely no idea what that might involve and is just trying to make the Sue look insanely badass because s/he is better than any fighter EVAR, could probably be played for humor. But... it&#39;d have to be done right to avoid looking like trivialized genocide, which is probably not to be touched unless you are also a good enough writer to make Hitler look deservedly ridiculous.</p>

            <p>Generally, creating intentionally terrible stories without any intentions of satire or parody is known as writing trollfic. Which we generally... don&#39;t do. Obviously, you can write whatever you want under your own name. But this doesn&#39;t really seem like anything the PPC is going to, or even should, get behind.</p>

            <p>Writing horrible, unfunny badfic and then spork it is not in the spirit of the PPC as it is... rather pointless, I guess. Remember, missions are a form of parody, sarcasm and also criticism towards genuinely terrible fanfics. But we really just want to have fun, and your idea... well, seems that is quite lacking in that regards.<br><br>It&#39;s not a matter of showing it to other people or not, it&#39;s a matter of <i>it&#39;s not what we do or want to.</i><br><br>Ok, there are precedents for &quot;fake&quot; badfics. However, they were necessary to set up other, much bigger plots where finding a suitable badfic was pretty much impossible due to the other plots&#39; necessities, and they usually are never written in full if even at all.<br>As we already explained to Dark Brother 16, leave the bigger stuff for when you have some experience with normal missions.<br><br>Besides, in the PPC we do everything at the light of the day. We aren&#39;t a secret conspirative group, we don&#39;t hide ourselves. Sure, we don&#39;t want to be <i>too</i> famous either, as we would be swarmed by flaming aouthors, but you can get what I mean.</p>

            <p>Thank you so very much for the reminder. I went and gave him a hug immediately, and when I commented on being reminded of the fact that it was Fathers&#39; Day, he immediately guessed that the PPC had done said reminding. Um. I think I talk about us too much, and/or my parents know that you guys are just about my only source of information on anything that&#39;s happening ever. I&#39;m not good at paying attention to anything other than my books.<br><br>But in any case, that was off-topic. I love my dad very much, and I wish that we hadn&#39;t gotten into one of our sort-of arguments today. Then again, do you know any other fifteen-year-old girl who defends her thirteen-year-old brother with enough mindless consistency that her father gets annoyed with her contradicting him <i>again</i> after he said something mildly rebuking to said brother? I guess I have that to be proud of.<br><br>Anyhow, happy Fathers&#39; Day, all, and especially those of you who are fathers yourselves! Going to bed now!<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>A colleague of mine has recently alerted me to the fact that the England football league will be in full swing by the time of the Gathering, and London is likely to be EXTREMELY busy if there is a game going on. Not that I think we should change the date - just that we should be aware of the possible issues. Lycaenion and I will be in London from the 14th to the 16th anyway.</p>

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t even know where to look for the <s>fittings</s> fixtures.<br><br>I&#39;m assuming the concern is the Tube, rather than, er, anything else? Kaitlyn and I have been discussing the British Museum as a possible venue, which I think would escape most football-related crowds. It also sits close to stations on the Northern, Piccadilly, <i>and</i> Central lines, and is easily walkable from the Bakerloo, Circle, and District... oh, and the Hammersmith &amp; City, and the Metropolitan. And the Victoria... basically, stay off the Jubilee, and you can get there!<br><br>Ahem.<br><br>It&#39;s also within walking distance of Covent Garden if people wanted to go shopping. There&#39;s parks nearby, the river just beyond CG... I mean, it&#39;s basically central London, with all that implies. Just not the Tower Hill/Trafalgar Square/Hyde Park &amp; Museums trinity we usually visit.<br><br>But of course, if we can&#39;t actually <i>get</i> there, re-planning might be wise. ;) So, back to my original question: are we going to have trouble?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have the perfect solution for my trio situation that I have been trying for! Certainly, you all remember my proposed trio, which you have all pointed out is not very common place. <br><br>Well, I have decided to make a pair of teams, both from the Department of Mary Sues, who team up on a particularly stressful mission. What I have in mind is The Siren, a South Park badfic I have claimed some time ago. It has literally fifty original characters, at least three of whom are Mary Sues and the rest of whom are Bits. Here is a link to the story.<br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7398957/1/The_Siren"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7398957/1/The_Siren">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7398957/1/The_Siren</a></a><br><br>The two teams will consist of-<br>1. Ellis and Wells<br>2. Bessie and Butler<br><br>During the mission into The Siren, Agent Butler will begin to show excessive homicidal tendencies that do not discriminate between Mary Sues, Bits and Out of Character Canon Characters. Because of this, he will be taken down and taken to FicPsych, and Bessie will, at least temporarily, join a trio with Ellis and Wells.<br><br>Here is the profile for Agent Butler.<br><br>Agent Butler<br>Known Aliases: Subject 11479<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: Uncertain<br><br>Appearance: <br>- Eye color: Innocent blue<br>- Hair: Black and slicked back with a Handlebar mustache<br>- Height: Described as towering<br><br>Personality: The Butler is obsessed with cleanliness and manners. He will berate people for not wiping their feet on the door mate or having poor table manners, or anything of the sort. He pays very close attention to detail, and for this reason, does all the cleaning in the RC himself, an activity which he frequently can be found doing. He holds punctuality in very high regard and insists that the daily routines of him and his partner be kept up, unless there is some factors making it impossible to do so. He loves fine foods, especially Italian, and he dresses in fine clothes, listens to Baroque and Classical Era music, and enjoys classical literature.<br><br>However, underneath these traits, he is a very disturbed person. He thrives on murder, and takes pride and joy in keeping his friends and his foes alike guessing about everything regarding him. That is why he never talked with anyone about his past and why he eliminated anything and everything about him in the PPC database before trying to murdering his partner. That being said, he prefers not to put his trust in others very often.<br><br>While he goes about his &quot;dirty jobs&quot; in the field, he indulges in some eccentric urges that are mostly unique to each fandom, such as hording Chocolate Frog Cards from Harry Potter, or collecting Morgul blades from the Lord of the Rings. He has an odd habit of frightening his targets so that they either run away, giving him the pleasure of a good hunt, or turn and fight, to give him the satisfaction of defeating yet another target. That being said, he is a particularly sadistic agent. Whenever he hunts a target, he favors a Glock 18 handgun and a Freedom Fighter Combat Knife. Before killing his targets, he always gives an insincere &quot;sorry&quot;.<br><br>As he is hunting or fighting a target, he becomes more focused and, in his eyes, the world slows down. He experiences a rush of adrenaline that can help him achieve feats of amazing physical conditioning. Anything that gets in the way of him and his target as he is in this state tends to be the object of his quick and intense wrath before he immediately resumes his hunt or fight. Also, while in this state of mind, he has a bestial tolerance to pain, shrugging off what would normally slow down other life forms.<br><br>After a kill, he tends to remove the organs and intestines from his victim with surgical precision, and places them in plastic bags, clearly labeled to distinguish which organ is which. He keeps the organs and intestines as trophies in individually marked porcelain jars, a practice which his partner, Bessie, shared for a time.<br><br>Aside from all these personality traits, he is a man of his word and greatly dislikes those who are not. He seems reluctant to kill children, but will indiscriminately if he feels that it should be done. He has an odd habit of forming attachments with his most persistent foes, such as Agent Spencer Ellis or Melvin Moore. However, he dislikes Mary Sues on account of their more often than not poor manners and self centered personalities.<br><br>Abilities: He is a very observant individual who pays close attention to detail and who can correctly guess what his opponent or target are about to do based on what little he knows about them. He has a surprisingly detailed knowledge of the anatomy of many different life forms from many different fandoms, and knows how to use nearly any environment to his advantage and use any weapon he can get his hands on. He is a deadly and accurate shot with a fire arm or other ranged weapons, and he is a force to be reckoned with in hand to hand combat. He also knows how to operate PPC Technology, even what he is technically not allowed access to on a regular basis. He has sufficient knowledge of the methods of FicPsych to deceive anyone but the professional doctors into thinking he is cured.<br><br>Background: Very little is known about Butler&#39;s past. And now that he has, for as of yet unknown reasons, destroyed any evidence of his past, even his name has been lost. However, it can be assumed that he was adopted by a negligent mother and experienced some childhood trauma, possibly involving surgery of some kind. It is also probable that he was ignored or disliked by his peers early on in life. Upon joining the PPC, he was given a position in the Department of Mary Sues, until he somehow snapped, deleted all his personnel files, and began plans to murder his partner. <br><br>When said plans failed, he was taken to FicPsych, where he was evaluated with an unidentified form of psychosis.<br><br>Please note that this is not a Permission Request. I just want your opinions and suggestions. </p>

            <p>You&#39;re creating a character, just to kill him off so that you can have a trio of DMS agents?<br><br>I think you&#39;re missing the point. Butler serves no purpose as far as I can see, and trio&#39;s of agents happen in the PPC, sure it&#39;s rare but it happens so why not just go with them at the start, or have one pair at the start with a third agent join them later (see below where I go off on a tangent). You&#39;re still effectively trying to get permission for four characters, and that&#39;s not including Plank if you try and get him in from the start as well. The way forward ( that I see) is using less agents, not more. <br><br>I get that you want to bring in four or five characters. But, to me at least you still seem like you&#39;re trying to cram them all in from the start. If I&#39;m reading this right, and feel free to correct me if I&#39;m not, but you want 3 agents in the DMS, 1 in the DIA and 1 in DMSE&amp;R, yes? <br>If I were you I&#39;d start out with a pair of Agents, seeing as they&#39;re together in your post, let&#39;s go with Ellis and Wells, try and get permission with them and just them, forget about any extra story plots you have in our head for now. Then once you have permission go through a few mission and introduce Bessie as a Recruit who Wells and Ellis get the &#39;joy&#39; of training, go through a few more missions and bring in an interlude, or find a mission, that&#39;d neatly link you into the DMSE&amp;R and Plank (assuming you still want him by then), and all the way along drop little hints, nothing big about you building up the start of a plot. Now maybe wait a mission or two more, have another interlude with Plank and maybe introduce Moore into this one as well. Add more of the plot in and then wait a small while, building it up more and more until you have your climax. <br>By this point in time you&#39;ll have several missions under your belt and you should have been with the PPC for a decent amount of time, you&#39;ll know how to write the missions, what could happen, what could not and generally be in a better position for your big plot than you currently are, if at that point you do indeed want to continue writing that plot at all. <br><br>You can take or leave as much or as little of what I&#39;ve written as you want, I&#39;m just trying to throw some ideas around that could help you. But I think the crucial thing is that everyone (or pretty much everyone) starts in the PPC with one team of agents in one department. So just give it a whirl, and add in more characters and more of your story as time goes on, don&#39;t worry about any grand plot at first, just do what the DMS do best, spork stories and kill Sues.<br><br>Storme Hawk </p>

            <p>I&#39;m not going to kill him off. He&#39;s going to keep coming back. The two teams will be intertwined for a long time.<br><br>Actually, at this point, I&#39;m just looking for concrit for this character. I&#39;m not trying to get permission for him yet. He&#39;s not ready yet.<br><br>Well, I&#39;m going to try just Ellis and Wells for the first mission with Plank playing indirect roles, never actually showing up anywhere but in conversations between Ellis and Wells. I hope to introduce those other agents later, if all goes well. If not, I&#39;ll work around it. I hope it doesn&#39;t come to that, but still, I can improvise if things go pear shaped, as the phrase goes.<br><br>&quot;Our head&quot;? Oh my. X)<br><br>That is indeed what I have in mind. The only difference is that I intend to introduce Bessie in the second mission when she and her theoretical partner join Ellis and Wells on the mission for The Siren. Like I&#39;ve said, there are quite a few Mary Sues, at least three, and literally dozens of Bits. <br><br>And I appreciate your advice. It&#39;s helpful. However, I had already started making plans to act on my agents in the way you suggested. See, Huinesoron gave me an assignment mission, if you will, and said to include Ellis and Wells for now. It seems that, here at the PPC, as with almost anywhere else, creative minds think alike on occasion. <br><br>Thank you for your advice, again. :)</p>

            <p>Gotta say I hoped Luis Suarez was going to be out of action for longer than he was. However, given that Uruguay were on the receiving end of a 3-1 drubbing by Costa Rica of all people, I think England can get something out of the game even with the Premier League&#39;s finest actor back in the camp.<br><br>Also, some asides about other teams in the World Cup.<br><br>#1: Japan are officially sponsored by Pokemon. They showed up in a Pikachu jet. I want a Pikachu jet. You do not know how much.<br><br>#2: Bosnia finally qualified for a major competition! Well done, chaps. Good display against Argentina, too; let&#39;s just hope for more goals in the less horrendous games.<br><br>#3: When did the US become, like, a decent side? They looked solid at the back and attractive going forward. Also, bit of trivia, Clinton D. Dempsey III Junior&#39;s goal was the fifth-fastest scored in World Cup history.<br><br>#4: Belgium aren&#39;t living up to the hype, alas. The first half against Algeria was... let&#39;s be kind and say unconvincing. The talent&#39;s there but the coach appears to have gone completely mental.<br><br>Updates next week! =]</p>

            <p>To be perfectly honest, I don&#39;t know a whole lot about the world cup. I tend to root for whoever is winning at the moment, and I am liable to &quot;switch sides&quot; whenever the other team pulls ahead.

            <p>This comment is in no way constructive (it doesn&#39;t explain what zdimensia did wrong, and it is well after others had already explained), and it is a personal attack (just a wordier way of saying &quot;shut up&quot;). It is a flame, and that is against Article 3 of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Constitution.</a> You are consistently very rude, and I am getting tired of you needing to be told that it isn&#39;t acceptable.

            <p>If you&#39;re claiming that Ekyl is being bigoted by not acknowledging your mode of speech, you are incorrect. It is simply not appropriate to refer to the Spanish language as &quot;Mexican,&quot; and it is likewise not appropriate to refer to the English language as &quot;American.&quot; Not everyone who speaks Spanish is Mexican, and not everyone who speaks English is American. Failing to recognize that a given language does not automatically equate to a given nationality is marginalizing to other speakers of the language and therefore offensive. (Also, it makes it look like you don&#39;t know the proper name of the language.) If you want to clarify which regional variation you&#39;re talking about by saying Mexican Spanish or American English, that&#39;s fine (which is the point Des was making), but you can&#39;t leave off a word and claim you&#39;re doing the same thing. It isn&#39;t the same. Please don&#39;t insist that it is.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I like this. A lot. Really. (And this is all the praise you will get from me, because I’m really bad at explaining why I love something.) But I have some questions.<br><br><i>They talked for a few more minutes, Enelya’s hair turning bronze for one particularly interesting moment ...</i><br>Did I miss where the badfic mentions another hair color, or do you expect that your readers have seen the picture of the main protagonist? How would you describe the color of her hair there? I don’t usually look on the badfic when I read a mission, and your mission should be able to stand alone even when the badfic is deleted.<br><br><i>Silver had no choice but to pull Anna around the corner as Strider carried Enelya into another room.</i><br>Is this really what happened? Doesn’t Strider tell in the badfic that he carried Enelya to the bed in the same room where they had talked? This should be the room for which she got the key when she rented it for the night, although she only says that she asked the innkeeper for “a key” and then walked into “a room” which may or may not be associated with said key. Is she not aware how inns work?  <br><br><i>When Strider walked back in, ...</i><br>Again, is this really what happened? Doesn’t Strider tell that he, after laying Elenya down, “locking the door from the inside, walked out of the room” (how did he manage to do this?) and then into his room?<br><br><i>”Don’t want to wait.”</i><br>I get that Silver wants to portal forward in the fic. But why does she carry Anna <i>down the stairs and out into the street</i> after tugging her through the portal? Didn’t they arrive where Silver wanted to go? And then they are suddenly on the market? May I suggest having the heaving and complaining happen on the way from Enalya’s room to Strider’s room, before Strider decides not to open the letter, and then portal to the market? (I’m not sure whether we are allowed to complain that there is a stair involved when the fic didn’t mention a stair, but also didn’t say that Strider’s room and Enalya’s room are on the same floor. Does “rule of funny” take precedence over “the canon tries to help the agents and makes Strider’s room to be close to Enalya’s room if this doesn’t contradict what is said in the badfic&quot;? This may be a question to be asked to more experienced boarders.)<br><br>Being used to see quotes from the badfic bolded, I wonder why you put <i>‘just loud enough for her elf-ears to hear’</i> into quotation marks and didn’t bold it. Is this because it isn’t a full sentence or paragraph?<br><br><i>Her eyes wide, Anna reached down and<br>“We’re out of here.” </i><br>Is there a word (or more) missing at the end of the first of these lines?<br><br><i>... the author had mixed it up with a feast in the Return of the King ...</i><br>Why don’t you tell us the truth: <i>Enelya</i>, who is narrating this part of the fic, <i> had mixed it up with a feast in the Return of the King</i>? (This isn’t a really bad case of author bashing, but to be rather save than sorry it’s preferable to never mention the author at all. It may be ridiculous to hold a Sue or Wraith responsible for everything, including bad spelling and grammar, but this is an established part of the PPC’s general ridiculousness.) <br><br><i>She somehow got a bullseye on one of her first tries ...</i><br>Are your agents surprised? Oh well, portaling forward they missed the part in the first chapter where Enelya showed off: <b>One arrow hit the bullseye, the next pierced it through the center and made it shatter into many pieces.</b> Isn’t the real surprise that she becomes clumsy whenever Legolas is in sight, making him believe that he should teach her? “Getting bullseyes on your first practice with bows“, definitely isn’t a charge because Enelya was established to be a good archer long before what your agents call her “first practice”.<br><br><i>– and a dart hit the ‘Sue’s neck.</i><br>Is this still the badfic, or did your agents interfere? (I know, but only because I read the badfic, so you may want to make this more clear.)<br><br>How did your agents get the charge of <i>having bronze hair</i>? Where they mention <i>Enelya’s hair turning bronze for one particularly interesting moment</i>, Enelya actually narrates that it is <b>bronze coloured</b>, thus causing my confused first question. The joke would work in the second chapter, where Enelya showed that her <b>bronze hair was already braided</b>, but your agents didn’t see this. Charging only based on reading the words is not unheard of; the problem that bothers me here is your agents pretending to have seen something in a place where it didn’t happen. <br><br>How did your agents survive this unscathed? In TOS and other early spin-offs, agents may have braved First Person ‘fics without bad consequences (it’s hard to tell, because most of these ‘fics are gone for good and I don’t remember whether there were quotes implying that a ‘fic was written in First Person.) But since Araeph made DoSAT invent the <a href="http://uncommon-comma.livejournal.com/4333.html">“Me” and “You” crash dummies</a>, it’s no longer feasible to ignore the problem of an agent becoming “I” or “You”. Agent Cadmar can tell you a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nHgR25Gys5uLNsxbBHr6SOo-oCJTyT8haRIUaYGBVdQ/edit?hl=en_US&amp;pli=1">loooong story</a> about what may happen if your agents enter a First Person fic without a working crash dummy. (Storme Hawk mentioned this already, but he may not have been very clear about it.)<br><br>So, this is a good first draft, showing what you can do with this ‘fic and your agents, but some details need more attention before it can be considered to be finished and ready for publishing. You probably knew this when you asked for beta readers. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Thinking further, I really like your agents’ reactions to the POV shifts, and the necessity to narrate the crash dummies actions when it adapts to the new POV would probably take away from this. I don’t urge you to rewrite everything with a crash dummy. Considering that every PPC story except TOS is fan fiction for TOS, you may actually claim that, since Jay and Acacia never mentioned a crash dummy or an agent sued by a First Person fic, these fanon things don’t need to exist in your spin-off.<br><br>But of course trying to keep all spin-offs consistent is more fun. Maybe you can just add an author’s note at the end, saying that Silver and Anna had to undergo exhaustive examinations by Medical, FicPsych, DoSAT and DMSE&amp;R, but that it is still unknown whether there was something special in this badfic or whether they are generally immune against First Person effects. And then you have a story arc that may span several missions: Will they remember to use the crash dummy to be rather safe than sorry, or will they learn in a hilarious way that they actually aren’t immune? <br><br>Killing the ‘Sue is often cathartic, for the agents as well as for their author. But if you don’t feel like writing an extended killing scene, don’t drag it out just to please your beta readers. Your agents are floaters. It may be in character for them to see an assassination as just one of the many different jobs they do, not as an outlet for their anger like we would expect from specialized assassins in the DMS. So there’s no need to make a big fuzz about it in the mission report.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I like the pacing of this mission; a lot of us (myself super-included) have a tendency to get hung up on little details that bog down the narrative.  You avoid that, keeping the mission going, and only showing us the major flaws in the badfic.  One thing that could maybe use a bit more time (at least some of the time, not always) is the misspelling-induced puns.  Some folks here say it&#39;s redundant to include both the original line and the description of the unintended effect, but I personally like seeing the original sentence, as it&#39;s frequently quite entertaining on its own.  But that is a subjective thing on my part.<br><br>The pacing furthermore harkens back well to the original series, as well as other details.  I like seeing agents sleeping and eating on the job, (and playing board games together!) which is typically not depicted anymore, and which I want to get into the habit of mentioning myself.  (It doesn&#39;t help that most canons don&#39;t have the time frame delineated as well as LotR.  Oh well.)  I liked reading some agents whose personalities aren&#39;t so over-bearing and dramatic that they take over the writing and distract focus away from the mission.  You should still develop their personalities over time, of course, but it&#39;s good you didn&#39;t drop their entire psychologies on us right away.<br><br>I was going to say something about how vague the assassination was, since all you did was imply that Silver shot the Sue.  But then, just now, I looked back at the badfic/mission title and realized there&#39;s only one place the Sue could have been shot.  So excellent stealth joke there.<br><br>One thing I didn&#39;t understand, though, was the &quot;you owe me two dollars&quot; joke, though, and what it had to do with <i>Doctor Who</i>.  Also, what happened with the orc that attacked the Sue just before the assassination?  I can&#39;t tell from the words if the orc or one of the agents darted Enelya.  And where did the orc go?  It just says, &quot;. . . Anna took care of the orc.&quot; Does that mean she treated their wound?  Killed them?  Just portalled them somewhere?<br><br>Oh, and I liked Anna&#39;s mini-MST of the summary, too.<br><br>I&#39;ve got a list of mistakes I caught below.  First, I wanted to mention that, generally, a story should get betad before it gets posted to the Board.  (Don&#39;t feel bad; we almost never bring this rule up.)  There&#39;s a big old list of potential beta readers right here in the community, available on our wiki:<br>ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC<em>Beta</em>Reader_Directory<br>(Not all those names are current users, but you can always just stick to names you recognize.  And, of course, you can seek the help of multiple betas for any given story.)<br><br>The little errors:<br>(In the Disclaimer)<br>Titles of long works (<i>Lord of the Rings</i>) get italicized, while short works (&quot;Arrow Through the Heart&quot;) have quotation marks around them.  Also, the comma after &quot;<i>Rings</i>&quot; should be changed to a semi-colon, since that&#39;s a pair of sentences linked into one.  A little way into the story, &quot;<i>Doctor Who</i>&quot; should also be italicized.<br><br>&quot;. . . and with a very loud &#39;BEEEEP<b>&#39;,</b> the CAD displayed . . .&quot;<br>The comma should go inside the quotation mark.<br><br>&quot;. . . with even a <b>lightning shaped</b> mark on her hindquarters.&quot;<br>A hyphen goes between these two words, since a word that&#39;s usually a noun is being used as an adverb.  (Lightning-shaped.  Also, why no <i>My Little Pony</i> joke?<br><br>&quot;&#39;<b>Alright</b>, we&#39;re portalling ahead . . .&#39;&quot;  (&quot;Alright&quot; is technically two words, &quot;all right.&quot;)<br><br>&quot;Her eyes wide, Anna reached down and&quot;<br>failed to reach the end of this sentence!  Looks like something got deleted here.<br><br>&quot;. . . a bag of chips, <b>which</b> after an intense game . . .&quot;<br>A comma goes after &quot;which&quot; here, as it&#39;s technically part of &quot;Anna won&quot; at the end of the sentence.  (Since it could be rewritten as &quot;. . . which Anna won after an . . .&quot;)<br><br>&quot;In the morning, <b>well rested</b> and not so eager . . .&quot;<br>Another hyphen here.<br><br>(In the charge list:)<br>Having both dashes and commas in the same place (--,) is redundant.  The dash is enough of a pause that the comma (or any other punctuation) isn&#39;t needed.<br><br>&quot;. . . after using the <b>DORK</b> to become elves . . .&quot;<br>According to our wiki, this should be &quot;D.O.R.K.S.&quot;  (The &quot;S&quot; is part of the acronym, so you don&#39;t need to remove it to make it singular.)</p>

I mean, it doesn&#39;t have to take <i>pages</i>, but it felt too abrupt.<br><br>This, however, is what I enjoyed: the opening was fun, and set up your agents well. Also, the mission itself was rather reminiscent of Jay and Acacia, especially the style of badfic chosen, the whole hiding-in-the-bushes-at-the-Council-of-Elrond thing, and them going as Orks, which was appreciated. Finally, I liked everything in there that involved the word &#39;glowing,&#39; especially the discussion on its potential uses as a curse. I may just have to steal that.<br><br>Also, DORK is technically DORKS.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>Firstly, just a little thing that may make it easier, if you change the permission of those who can view it to &#39;can comment&#39; it&#39;d be easier as then Beta&#39;s can comment on the errors directly where they happen in the document. <br><br>Anyway, enough of me blabbering on let&#39;s get to work.<br><br>- &quot;Silver punched a button, and the two agents -- one protesting very loudly -- stepped through into the badfic.&quot; <br>-- I assume it&#39;s Anna who&#39;s protesting loudly? Yet she&#39;s willingly stepping through the portal, I&#39;d maybe have Silveer drag her through the portal, giving Anna a reason to be protesting loudly<br><br>-In a sing-song voice, it said: Italics are either Sindarin/Quenya or thoughts.  Main Character dash dash dash dash dash dash dash arrow [Picture Here]&quot;<br>--I&#39;d say you&#39;re OK without the it said, whilst attaching the &#39;In a sing-song voice&#39; to the previous sentence. Also not sure if you need all the dashes, and maybe describe the picture next to the A/N briefly instead of stating &#39;Picture Here&#39; not 100% sure on that one though.<br><br>--This whole fic is in First Person, yet you don&#39;t have a crash dummy to stop you&#39;re agents being Sued<br><br>-- I&#39;d make a comment on &#39;mellon nin&#39; as Strider calls the Sue, now I&#39;m not 100% sure what it means, but considering that a elvish-english online dictionary told me mellon mean friend and nin meant wet (whether that&#39;s accurate I&#39;d leave to Hs), I doubt that that&#39;s what the Suethor meant (and if the translation is correct you could get the fic to do something funny like dump a bucket of water on the Sue&#39;s head). Oh and something about the soulmate&#39;s the Sue mentions as well. <br><br>--After mentioning the first A/N at the beginning you then don&#39;t mention the others that pop up from time to time to give the link ot a picture of whatever the Sue&#39;s just been describing<br><br>-- The ending feels a tad rushed, added to that your agents portal to Mirkwood, Anna drops the Sue, Silver reads the chrages then grabs her bow, strings it, nocks an arrow, aims it and fires. And the Sue is doing what exactly? It&#39;s not like Anna&#39;s holding her because you clearly have her catch the notebook from Silver. I&#39;d agree that that time seems like a good one to get the Sue, but you don&#39;t charge for the impossible Orcs (who shouldn&#39;t be anywhere near Rivendell).<br><br>That&#39;s all I can see atm, <br><br>Storme Hawk<br><br></p>

            <p>During this month I&#39;ve been coming up with ideas for a Hetalia Superhero AU. However I&#39;ve hit a sort of a stictywickit when it comes a certain characters.<br><br>Poland was one of my favorite characters when I first began watching Hetalia. For those of you that no nothing about Hetalia, Poland  is a European Nation that speaks in a valley girl dialect and cross-dresses (And is a boy, just to be clear). He is vain and ditzy, but still loyal and protective. When I started planning this thing I origanally thought about giving him  the power to teleport before I deiced that power was better suited toward Lithuania, Poland&#39;s partner in crime. Then I got stumped trying to find another good power that would fit Poland, that I haven&#39;t given to another character. I got the idea to make Denmark a merman (long story), but nothing for poor Poland. If you guys have any ideas they would be most welcome.<br><br>PS If you guys have any ideas for other superhero countries, I can accept those as well.<br><br>PPS Spellcheck hates the word Teleport for some reason.   </p>

            <p>I think Polands ability should be a healing factor similar to Wolverine&#39;s that country has been through some very tough times in its History and Poland keeps bouncing back. I like your idea with Lithunia, I think there was a strip made about that historical event in the actuall Hetalia canon. I made Denmark a mermaid because of the fact that Hans Christan Anderson is Danish. There is no real Tony Stark like charcter in this fic, although America and Estonia come close in terms of being tech-savy. Sweden, without discussing too much has powers and backstory closely related to Norse Mythology ( and also a girl in this AU, I needed more female charcters.) France&#39;s battle strategy have some of your Ideas worked in</p>

            <p>Sounds pretty fun. Every time I try to write something bad on purpose, though, I end up forcing it to spork itself.<br><br>Example: <i>Martin soon made it to the top of the wall and leaned into the wind as he walked along it for a short ways. Then, a gust of wind caught the rose in his paws and blew it out of his hands and ripped it to shreds all for the sake of useless symbolism. Following the trend of useless symbolism, Martin wondered vaguely for a few seconds whether it was rain or tears running down his face.</i><br><br>Anyway, the point is, I&#39;m not sure I could write something honestly bad without making fun of what I&#39;m doing while I&#39;m actively doing it.

            <p>We have an annual event where we write PPC badfic—that is badfic about the PPC—for snorts and chortles. The next one should be coming up in the next couple months, actually.

            <p>I made the decision when switching over to FfW to also switch over to Javascript for fields that need updating. That means that if your browser blocks or can&#39;t run JS, you won&#39;t see the stories.<br><br>You can still <i>read</i> the stories, by typing the addresses directly, like this:<br><br><a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story40-1.htm"><a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story40-1.htm">http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story40-1.htm</a></a><br><br>There are currently 41 stories (the first being <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story1-1.htm"><a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story1-1.htm">http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story1-1.htm</a></a>); again, the chapter links are JS controlled, but changing the second digit will tell you if there&#39;s another chapter pretty quick.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>For one, I sincerely doubt that badfic will ever &quot;die down&quot;. There will always be authors out there who write some really not good things; I feel like 99% of good writers were there at some point in their life, whether they would like to admit it or not.<br><br>Secondly, in the minute chance that all badfic vanished, as a group I hope we would lay down our arms and retire as agents. There is no sense in proliferating badfic, in my opinion, even in the name of continuing PPC missions.<br><br>And if you get bored of writing missions, maybe some original fic, or fanfic of your own? Or even &#39;shenanigans around HQ&#39; types of things.<br><br>As you say, as a group our knowledge of badfic is extensive; let&#39;s just use it for good, not for evil! :P<br><br>And don&#39;t worry about proposing &quot;stupid ideas&quot;! I think it&#39;s very similar to something that some PPCers already do, which is sporking old awful fanfic of their own. Ideas are good! Never feel bad about posting ideas.<br><br>(This is just an aside, but after commas there is generally a space before the next word begins. Just an FYI!)</p>

            <p>Wait, what? Me, talking Tolkien? What is this madness?<br><br>Yes, surprisingly, I am actually going to talk about something related to LoTR, for once. Specifically, the original Hobbit film. No, not the well-animated one. The <i>poorly</i>-animated one.<br><br>Yes, it seems like the Hobbit was a short 12 minute animation, made in 1966, long before the other movies. You can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBnVL1Y2src">here.</a> However, there were some... changes made to the story. I&#39;ll wait and let you all see it, then we can vote on if this should be the film we collectively MST.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s got kind of a cute, cut and paste early film style. But Slag the terrible? It&#39;s not really recognizable as the Hobbit anymore. Also, &quot;monster lizard&quot; is really unnecessary when it is CLEARLY A DRAGON. It&#39;s not like dragons were copyrighted or anything... Why they needed to change any names when Gandalf is clearly mentioned is befuddling to me, though.<br><br>&quot;Thorin Oakensheild&quot; has a really great Dali-style moustache, though. :D</p>

            <p>-Some of the art. The opening shots of the Shire and Mirkwood, especially, reminded me very strongly of Tolkien&#39;s style.<br><br>-Gandalf&#39;s tower. Not the fact that he had one, but the design of it. It was cool. It had runes on the inside walls.<br><br>-The narration as they stepped into Mirkwood. Something about &#39;a sea of trees, with no chance to come up for air&#39;? It was very good visual imagery.<br><br>-The Unexpected Party. I know, I know - but as a summary of the book, if you ignore Mika, it&#39;s actually pretty good. And good or not, it was <i>hilarious</i>.<br><br>-The animation on the faceted Arkenstone. That was really cleverly handled!<br><br>-... no, that&#39;s it.<br><br>What&#39;s interesting is that I read about this some time ago, in <a href="http://www.awn.com/animationworld/hobbit-alized-first-attempt-animating-hobbit">this article</a>. Some choice excerpts:<br><br><i>We were well into The Hobbit screenplay when The Lord of The Rings came out in paperback editions. Having assumed there was only The Hobbit to contend with, and following Snyder&#39;s wish, we had taken some liberties with the story that a few years later would be grounds for burning at the stake. For example, I had introduced a series of songs, changed some of the characters&#39; names, played loosely with the plot, and even created a girl character, a Princess no less, to go along on the quest, and to eventually overcome Bilbo Baggins&#39; bachelorhood! I could Hollywoodize as well as the next man...<br><br>[...]<br><br>Before the time of CGI, I had proposed an impressive visual effect, combining cel-animated figures over elaborate 3D model backgrounds. I know that Max Fleisher had once tried something like it, but I intended to take the idea to greater heights and atmosphere. I even attached a special name to the technique: &quot;ImagiMation!&quot; I was thinking big!<br><br>By the time we arrived in New York, however, Snyder had already blown the deal by asking 20th for too much money. Tolkien&#39;s name hadn&#39;t yet reached them either. I had a fat script, but no other film companies were then interested. It was crushing. Even today, when I flip through my screenplay, and can almost see the fabulous scenes I had imagined, I feel a heavy regret.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The Tolkien estate had now been offered a fabulous sum for the rights, and Snyder&#39;s rights would expire in one month. They were already rubbing their hands together. But Snyder played his ace: to fulfill just the letter of the contract -- to deliver a &quot; full-color film&quot; of The Hobbit by June 30th. All he had to do was to order me to destroy my own screenplay -- all my previous year&#39;s work -- hoke up a super-condensed scenario on the order of a movie preview (but still tell the entire basic story from beginning to end), and all within 12 minutes running time -- one 35mm reel of film. Cheap. I had to get the artwork done, record voice and music, shoot it, edit it, and get it to a New York projection room on or before June 30, 1966!<br><br>I should have told him to shove it, but I was basically his slave at the time...and it suddenly became a sort of insane challenge.<br><br>I knew my screen story line by heart, so I just had to put it through a mind-shredder, and write a sort of synopsis, with a few key lines of dialog scattered throughout.<br><br>[...]<br><br>The final blow came some years later, when an animated feature version of The Hobbit appeared, starring the timid voice of Orson Bean. That film to my mind in no way approached the magnificence I had originally envisioned. I had obtained the greatest Czech artist of the time, illustrator, painter, sculptor, and director of the most famous Czech puppet films of all time, Jirн Trnka, to be the designer of my projected version. Sadly, we never got beyond his model sketches.</i><br><br>On the one hand, I feel really bad for him (him?); working that hard on something only to be ordered to rip it to shreds must be horrendous; not to mention that the art shown in that article is gorgeous. But on the other hand... yeah, that&#39;s... rather worse than the Jackson changes. :D<br><br>(I agree that someone should feed a Sue to poor Slag, though. Poor dragon gets no love)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Although someone needs to feed a Sue to &quot;the monster lizard Slag the Terrible.&quot;<br><br>I also love how the narration is all, &quot;This is a story from before mankind was mighty.  Now here&#39;s a human settlement and here&#39;s three human characters.&quot;<br><br>I actually legitimately like the princess character.

Aaaaaaaaah&#39;m not even bothered by this.  I think I&#39;ve officially read too much fanfiction.<br><br>&quot;Magically, the One Ring of Power had found its true bearer.&quot;  Oh man, you guys, Bilbo was Sauron all along, totally had me fooled, never saw that coming, Professor Tolkien is such a master.<br><br>&quot;Hey guys, I got your Arkenstone back.  Know what we should do now?  We totally need to weaponize this priceless treasure and symbolic family heirloom/national heritage and throw it right back at the monster I just stole it from.  Then we just need to fish around inside dragon guts for a week or so while the corpse slowly begins to rot around us, and we&#39;ll have your Arkenstone back.  Sound like a plan?&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve only watched the intro so far, but wow. <b>Wow</b>.<br><br>...<br><br>Gandalf has a tower? Is he a <i>Belgariad</i>-verse sorcerer now? Also, he can&#39;t see the future. That&#39;s Mandos&#39;s job, and he&#39;s not sharing.<br><br>They even messed up the opening line!<br><br>...okay, their interpretation of the lot of them barging into Bilbo&#39;s hole was pretty funny, I&#39;ll admit. But what <i>is</i> that random OFC doing there, anyways?<br><br>No. He&#39;s not a dragon-killer. He&#39;s hired to be a <i>burglar</i>, by Elbereth!<br><br>Also, that map is so <i>wrong</i> I can&#39;t even put it into words.<br><br>Well, at least Gandalf still knows how to manipulate a conversation. Also the Shire is preeeeeety.<br><br>How is Gandalf &quot;watching them from a distance&quot;? Does he have a <i>palantir</i> all of a sudden?<br><br>Wait. Are they calling Trolls &quot;Groans&quot;?<br><br>And NO. They don&#39;t slowly turn into trees. They <i>instantly</i> turn into <i>stone</i>.<br><br>....aaaaaaannd apparently the whole traveling party (which, by the way, apparently only consists of four people) are complete and utter idiots. <i>Lovely</i>. Well, apparently Bilbo isn&#39;t, but that&#39;s only because he&#39;s stealing Gandalf&#39;s plan. *grumble*<br><br>Oh, hello, Misty Mountains. We skipped Imladris, apparently.<br><br>Look, if the audience can hear the scream, then it isn&#39;t soundless, no matter what the narration says.<br><br>And Goblins are now Grablins. And Gollum is... Goo-loom?<br><br>No, Gollum isn&#39;t trying to <i>hide</i> the Ring. Also, since when is Middle-earth an isle, anyways? ...oh, they&#39;re talking about Gollum&#39;s little lake-thing. Nevermind. But either way, Bilbo definitely didn&#39;t fall onto said island. He wouldn&#39;t have survived, for one.<br><br>&quot;Bilbo <i>did</i> have the Ring. Magically, the One Ring of Power had found its true bearer, and it was Bilbo Baggins the Hobbit.&quot; I... I cannot fully comprehend the unfathomable stupidity of that statement.<br><br>Oh, we&#39;re skipping Beorn, then, I guess. Because, you know, he <i>totally</i> doesn&#39;t play a vital part in the Battle of the Five Armies. Also, where&#39;s Gandalf at?<br><br>Okay, is this a sort of flash-forward/POV-switch thingie, or are we literally skipping the entirety of both the Thranduil <i>and</i> Laketown plots?<br><br>Yep. The lot of them somehow teleported from Mirkwood to the inside of the Lonely Mountain. *sigh*<br><br>Right. Since when does Bilbo steal the Arkenstone from under Smaug&#39;s nose? He steals a blasted <i>cup</i>, not the Arkenstone itself!<br><br>A crossbow. With the Arkenstone (which is, by the way, apparently now shaped like a heart) for the tip of the crossbow bolt. And they shoot Smaug (or rather Slag, for some unexplained reason) with it, and he <i>doesn&#39;t put up a fight</i>. I. Cannot. Even.<br><br>Well, apparently the Battle of the Five Armies never happened. *is annoyed*<br><br>No. No. No. You do not put a random OFC in, have her do <i>absolutely nothing</i> for the entire story, and then marry her off the Bilbo, who for some <i>ridiculous</i> reason spends the rest of his life in Dale. <i>Absolutely not</i>. <br><br>Oh, I&#39;m sorry, they go back to Hobbiton together, eventually. Despite the logical prob--- you know what? I&#39;m not going to <i>start</i> on the logical problems. I would still be typing in four hours.<br><br>But yes, <i><b>please</b></i>, this <i>needs</i> to be sporked.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>This &quot;film&quot; was made for one reason: to sell the rights back to the Tolkien estate. It was a get-rich-quick scam that kinda worked. I mean, the guy was paid $100,000 by the Tolkien estate for the rights back, which accounting for inflation, comes to around... $731,703.70. Not bad for a rushed 12 minute short.</p>

            <p>Are the SEP field generators powerful enough to allow the agents to very quietly stand against a wall when in the same room as a Sue?  How is that sort of thing usually handled?  Is there a problem when an unforeseen scene change forces them into a room with nowhere to hide?<br><br><br>And this is something more that I&#39;ve decided.  There is a fanon error that is so widespread that making it isn&#39;t a charge.

            <p>How detailed is the description of the surroundings in the fic you are talking about?<br><br>There have been a few times when agents encountered a similar situation and used the instability of a poorly described or extremely generic setting to be able to manipulate the environment to create a hiding place. <br><br>The first place I saw it happen was in an Indemaat story, but I don&#39;t remember exactly which one. It may have been in her story thread about one agent thinking the other was a Sue, because the agent was doing it a lot, showing off, kind of, among other things. <br><br>Agent Kaliel/Maeryn used it when the story took place entirely inside a cell that had no description other than &#39;cell&#39; and someone opening and closing a door occasionally. She created a space like a duck blind that the agents could watch the fic through.<br><br>This is from a mission that will probably never get finished and see the light of day.<br><br>“If the environment is sufficiently poorly described, you can describe it and make things that could reasonably be in the scene appear. It’s something that agents should not abuse, but sometimes there is no other way to avoid being seen when you find yourself in an empty box of a room like this--&quot;</p>

            <p>Nobody&#39;s ever tried to neuralyze a Sue, though, so I don&#39;t know how it would work. Oldbies, feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s ever neuralyzed a Sue.<br><br>The bigger question would be this: why <i>would</i> the agents want to neuralyze the Sue in the first place?</p>

            <p>I seem to remember something where the Sue somewhat noticed the agents, but the story sorta closed around the outburst and continued when they were out of sight.  I think it was a LOTR Elrond Counsel with four agents, not that it narrows it down much.  (Lux was there?)<br><br>Basically if the agents somehow get dragged into a room with noplace to hide due to a scene change.  This being before they are ready to grab the Sue. </p>

            <p>Jay and Acacia actually had more than one Close Sue Encounters. One of them involved distracting her with sock puppets.<br><br>But, I think the basic idea is that most Sues/SIs are too wrapped up in their own story to care about anything else as long as it&#39;s not directly interfering. Given the opportunity, they&#39;ll ignore the agents in order to get back to seducing Legolas or whatever. And actually, I have to disagree with everyone else so far: the SEP <i>does</i> work on Sues, but only to the extent that the agents can keep themselves under control and make themselves seem not to be the Sue&#39;s problem. The canon itself cloaks the agents from the canon characters, and the original point of the disguise was to look like something that would canonically kill whatever the Sue is.<br><br>That aside, the answer as far as story-telling goes is to solve the problem as creatively as possible, or else write the mission in such a way as to avoid it. If you want to put your agents in a situation where they&#39;re in trouble and have to cry, kick, or kiss their way out of it (to mildly mis-apply a quote), awesome! If you&#39;re just gonna hit the reset button on the Sue and have things continue without a hitch, you might as well just not put them in the situation to begin with.<br><br>One way you could potentially solve your problem of the empty room: The scene is so non-descript that the agents temporarily lose all description themselves. They blend in with the background, effectively gaining active camo. Later, when it&#39;s safe, they&#39;ll have to work out how to get their proper appearances back.<br><br>You always have a choice about how to interpret the badfic. It&#39;s important to represent its flaws accurately, but you don&#39;t have to take it at its word if it&#39;s being silly.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Basically, for two of the fics that are inserted into that scene...<br><br>One has the Insert being so busy drooling over the main character that the agents could probably pickpocket her.  The other has the Sue busy gasping for air.<br><br>Just assuming that the SEP field is powerful enough to conceal someone who is trying to be a fly on the wall is the most interesting thing I can do, otherwise I will have fics where at least one agent is an actual fly or something background like a songbird.</p>

            <p>Sorry this won&#39;t be a very long review.  I read this during work yesterday, and haven&#39;t had time to respond until now.<br><br>As with the other parts of this story, you&#39;re a great hand at giving us odd and clever little details that hint at what&#39;s going on, without giving away what that is.  (I still haven&#39;t figured it out, anyway.)  You&#39;re making good use of the concept of the Defectives, and tying their presence into the mystery.  I also want to mention the driving chase scene as an excellent action scene; it was very realistic and believable, and I was easily able to follow the action.<br><br>One thing I think needed a bit of expansion was the presence of the canon characters who appear here, Madoka and Homura.  They don&#39;t speak very much in the scenes they appear in.  I know the agents are the main characters, and this is a PPC story, but I still think the canons would have a bit more to say, given the situation.<br><br>Something confused me about the police officers who appear here, too.  Are they supposed to be the same ones who appeared in part 2?  Because if they are just generic police, it seems weird they wouldn&#39;t question the agents more, and especially give them a lift anywhere.</p>

            <p>but these loan words are borrowed from French, and my German teacher for the French language explained that accents are used to denote the &quot;melody&quot; of speech. If there is an <i>accent aigu</i> (bottom left to top right), your voice should go up, while it should go down if there is an <i>accent grave</i> (top left to bottom right), so if you know how to pronounce the word and that there is an accent, you should know which one to use.

            <p>Does &quot;All The Killings Start To Blur Together&quot; sound like a mid-period Fall Out Boy album track?<br><br>That aside, I don&#39;t think we should care all that much about how our agents kill Sues, because (as several Boarders have previously been at pains to point out) what we do isn&#39;t about the actual killing of Sues. Sure, it happens, and if you can make it inventive and funny then go for it, but it shouldn&#39;t be the be-all and end-all of a mission.</p>

            <p>My &#39;all the killings start to blur together&#39; was in the same vein as Neshomeh&#39;s &#39;cunningly symbolic use of parallelism&#39; - a made-up &#39;reason&#39; for something which was almost certainly down to bad writing.

            <p>You&#39;ve heard my thoughts on this already, but I stand by what I said originally: Just ignore this guy. If he&#39;s actively harassing you despite your attempts to cease communications, that&#39;s different, but if all he&#39;s doing is attempting to PPC the PPC (and failing <i>hard</i> at it, I hasten to add), so what? He&#39;s free to spend his time and energy on it if he wants to. You don&#39;t have to let it be important enough to waste your own on him any more.

I actually don&#39;t know, though I know that the canon does have chi in it. So even if it was possible, it&#39;s likely it wouldn&#39;t have too much of a negative effect on him. That, or the fire fist thing was a likely chi attack (the main character himself can transform into a flaming fox with multiple tails, I know that much).

            <p>The So Sue Me rant wasn&#39;t exactly on target, either, and a lot of us (myself included) were really upset about it. I think that was even part of what made Trojanhorse quit. It really does suck, being falsely accused. (Or, we must admit, not-so-falsely. We weren&#39;t always so insistent upon not insulting the authors.)<br><br>Personally, I did a lot of soul-searching and came to the conclusion that the best thing is to disprove these people with my words and actions at every turn, as best I can. So, basically: don&#39;t insult the authors—in fact, don&#39;t say <i>anything</i> about the authors, since referring to the OC, the narrator, or the story in general usually gets the point across while maintaining the important distinction between author and work; give respectful concrit when possible; write goodfic if so moved; and basically don&#39;t be a jerk.

            <p>(Jeez, I remember some of my earlier missions where I did refer to the author as opposed to the Sue and stuff. I&#39;ve been better about that, so...)<br><br>One thing that&#39;s confused the shit out of me throughout this whole thing is his insistence that he has improved and moved on from his fic. One of my co-contributors in the Library had this to say, actually:<br><br>&quot;But, if you look at it another way, despite his claims that the criticism of his work does not affect him, it certainly affected him enough to both write that fic and make a long commentary at the bottom about how he&#39;s not bothered any more.<br><br>You can only publicly deny the obvious for so long.&quot;<br><br>And really, that does seem to sound about right. He&#39;s put up this stink about it for the better part of six months, and it hasn&#39;t let up once. One thing I&#39;ve asked that he has never, <i>ever</i> answered is &quot;why are you still putting up a stink about this fic if that&#39;s the case&quot;, and it makes me so confused that he tossed around all this talk about &quot;oh, I&#39;ve improved so much since then&quot; and then turns around and tries to protect what should be his old shames. And then there&#39;s everything else, like making himself into a martyr that he isn&#39;t and everything associated with what he brings up in that fic. In that context, I guess it&#39;s just that he&#39;s in denial about how hurt he is. I still can&#39;t understand why it&#39;s there years after the snarking and why he&#39;s still talking about it six months after he first told me about it, but there it is.<br><br>I don&#39;t know what kind of self-righteousness would have to exist for that to occur, but by now he has to realize it hasn&#39;t gotten him anywhere...</p>

            <p>Hmm, don&#39;t see any of his old stuff to see if he actually improved.  (Haven&#39;t gone hunting for the mission.)  I skimmed over it a bit since it had elements that bore me, but I think his fight scenes were a bit muddy.<br><br>Without Wozz&#39;s context, it&#39;s sorta funny.  Hopefully that guy got it out of his system, goes to write some original stuff, and gets his stuff critted red in front of him.<br><br>But hey, the organization has been parodied beyond recognition in this.  We can take better than we can dish.  Depending on his popularity, we might get some trolls, but it should die down if we&#39;re level-headed.  Maybe the wiki should get locked-down or a backup if that&#39;s possible.</p>

            <p>...a big part of it was just the way he went about it before it got to this point. Honestly, I would be a <i>lot</i> less angry about this whole thing than I am if it weren&#39;t for the fact that this is the capstone of some really bad behavior on his part, and if not for the fact that he is <i>still</i> lying about all the things he did. If you want the sparknotes version, you can have that here: <a href="http://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/a-response-to-jedi-qui-gon/"><a href="http://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/a-response-to-jedi-qui-gon/">http://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/a-response-to-jedi-qui-gon/</a></a><br><br>If he had just started with this, I would&#39;ve been annoyed, but I wouldn&#39;t be infuriated. But the fact that this is the capstone of what I mention there... Yeah.<br><br>The mission itself goes a bit deeper than you imply. His prose has improved, there are some actual descriptions now, and the plot isn&#39;t a parade of <i>complete</i> bat-shit insanity, but that&#39;s about all I can say. His characters are still completely uninteresting cardboard cut-outs, they still talk like they&#39;re in a Saturday Morning cartoon, his action scenes are still very poorly paced, and in this case there&#39;s still no attempt to reconcile the canons. So there was some improvement, but it&#39;s not by much.<br><br>And anyway, he&#39;s still trying to defend this fic by making it so that the PPC never went in and corrected it. That implies that he still believes there was some quality to be had there, no? So therefore, any talk of &quot;improvement&quot; from his end is, to my eyes, him being full of shit.</p>

            <p>...given that one of the things that Jedi Qui-Gon conveniently left out to fit his narrative of &quot;<i><b>oh, I&#39;ve been horribly wronged by this bully</b></i>&quot; is that I did, in fact, leave a constructive review for the story. Granted, I did it in character along side Florestan and Eusabius, but still.

            <p>I would just call it a form of revenge-based author tract that doesn&#39;t even have the decency to <i>attempt</i> humor.

            <p>I know you&#39;re not very familiar with how authors taking criticism works on the internet, so allow me to bring you up to speed: a lot of them often get up in arms about being given concrit, and then they accuse you of flaming them or they try to deny that their problems really are the crippling problems that they are. Worse, some of them insult you in author&#39;s notes, and some of the other readers jump on the bandwagon when that happens. So authors get pissed. It doesn&#39;t matter if they say &quot;leave a review&quot;: when they say that, what they&#39;re oftentimes actually saying is &quot;tell me how awesome this is&quot;.<br><br>Trust me, I&#39;ve seen badfic authors react badly to criticism more times than I&#39;ve cared to count. <br><br>And mind you, this is just <i>concrit</i> we&#39;re talking about here. We haven&#39;t even gotten into how telling them about missions works. Which, as I would like to stress, is similar to what Jedi Qui-Gon here. You know, without the stage of intentional deception, making himself out into a martyr that he isn&#39;t, and talking out of his ass for the better part of six months.<br><br>In an ideal world, badfic authors would take the criticism to heart. But I&#39;m sorry, Pippa&#39;s Ghost, I&#39;ve seen enough badfic authors reply negatively to even calmly-given concrit that I know that cases of authors taking the criticisms to heart are few and far between.</p>

            <p>I know at least three Sherlock fanwriters whose stuff I&#39;ve missioned have been made aware of aforementioned missions. Their reactions were not pretty.

            <p>Got to admit, I never thought of it as satire.  Like I said, when I first joined the board, I thought of this as an extreme form of literary criticism, like a MST but with added violence.  (Or, more precisely, it&#39;s a way of demonstrating that a story is so bad that there&#39;s no possible redemptive reading of it, by literally putting characters in it and having them fail to find anything good.)<br><br>** Trying to make the mental shift to thinking in terms of satire... **<br><br>OK, so, most satirists&#39; victims are aware of the satire.  Can you name even one famous satirist who operated in total secrecy?  Harold McMillan was aware that Peter Cook existed.

            <p>Out of everyone who reads a mission, we can assume there are (basically) four groups:<br><br>1. Loved it so much they decided to join.<br>2. Enjoyed it, but not enough to comment.<br>3. Disliked it, but not enough to comment.<br>4. Hated it so much they decided to lash out.<br><br>We know that non-PPCers read missions because some of them either join up or do something to let us know they hate us. I&#39;m assuming total readership represents a bell curve, though, because that&#39;s usually how this sort of thing works, so there must be plenty of people in group 2 who read and learn from missions without saying anything directly about it; they just silently go on to write better fic, having learned what sorts of things to avoid. (Meanwhile, there are probably people in group 3 who learn to improve in other ways and people in group 2 who enjoy without learning anything, but that&#39;s beside the point.)<br><br>So that&#39;s how missions effect change even though we don&#39;t inform individual authors about them.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if I buy that all satire is public. Certainly the famous satirists we&#39;ve all heard of were, but not everyone can be famous.<br><br>But, lemme try putting it another way: When it comes to who sees a mission and who sees concrit, the question should be who stands to benefit from it. Fic authors do not stand to benefit from seeing a mission to their fic—they stand to take it personally and be insulted and angry. People who are not the author, and especially other PPCers, <i>do</i> stand to benefit, because they&#39;ll be able to enjoy the huor and appreciate the instructive parts without taking it personally.<br><br>On the other hand, fic authors <i>do</i> stand to benefit from concrit given in a polite and level manner. So, if you really care about giving advice and helping individual writers improve, the best tool for that job is concrit, not a mission. (And as Herr points out, even that doesn&#39;t always work. In those cases a mission wouldn&#39;t have a snowball&#39;s chance in hell.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

And how are we going to do that without confronting them, either with a mission or with some decent, honest truths (or &quot;flames&quot; as we&#39;re supposed to call them nowadays)?<br><br>As for how people discover the PPC, I was vaguely aware of it back in the day, when TOS was still on the Pit.  (I remember being annoyed that Jay and Acacia thought Kes was a silly name for a bird of prey, indicating that they&#39;d never even heard of <i>A Kestrel for a Knave.</i>)  But when it was taken off in the Pit&#39;s big purge along with most of the MSTs, it was the MSTs that I missed most, as I was a massive MSTie.  (Sorry that was such a tongue twister!)<br><br>I had no idea the PPC was still going at all, until I stumbled across the entry in TV Tropes earlier this year.  If you were more public, I would&#39;ve probably found you a lot sooner.<br></p>

            <p>Thanks you for giving me things to surreptitiously read while working the stingray touch tank today!<br><br>&quot;The Reannual:&quot;<br>FANTASTIC characterization of the Reannual.  Love it, love it, love it.  Out of curiosity, is this an original interpretation, or did you find an old source featuring the Reannual?  I only ask because we&#39;re short on links about it on the wiki.<br><br>&quot;Ski Trip:&quot;<br>I like this idea, of springing two separate but related fics on the agents, and I liked the descriptions you used in showing the transition between the two fics--virgin design space, I believe.  These fics also had some hilarious errors, and you made great use of them through visual puns.<br><br>The personalities of the agents also shined through quite strongly in this mission; I liked seeing them get riled up about some of the trivialized horrors being misused as drama in the fics, as well as the biological idiocies going on.  This also came through in their delicious assassination of Luis.  I do think they used the word &quot;charge&quot; a little too frequently, though.  You can discuss mistakes without always framing is as part of the charge list, especially when the fic makes errors as bald as the ones this pair did.  It just gets repetitive to keep seeing the word &quot;charge&quot; over and over.<br><br>&quot;The Nursery:&quot;<br>Just a question and a small note, here.  First, where did the name &quot;Ammy&quot; come from?  I forget if this is someone in Mittens&#39;s past that I&#39;ve read about already, or is it someone he hasn&#39;t mentioned yet?  (I like &quot;Moss&quot; as the last name.  It&#39;s cute!)<br><br>And I just wanted to point out that Miss MacKinnon isn&#39;t <i>really</i> elderly; she just looks that way from description.  I reckon it&#39;s time I made her her own wiki page, considering she&#39;s shown up several times now.  (Which makes me INORDINATELY PROUD AND BOASTFUL that I recruited her--but anyway.)<br><br><br>List o&#39; mistakes (All in &quot;Ski Trip&quot;):<br>&quot;. . .  a couple of disposable girlfriends of <b>her</b> were introduced . . .&quot;<br><br>&quot;. . . went to the station to confront <b>Detective&#39;s</b> Benson and Stabler . . .&quot; (no apostrophe)<br><br>&quot;&#39;It was <b>Detective&#39;s</b> Benson and Stabler . . .&#39;&quot; (same)<br><br>(Also, fun fact: this was a guest appearance by the main characters from <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i>!  And I was weirdly happy to see them, too.  It&#39;s actually a legitimate inclusion, as they would investigate a case involving an attempted rape.  Although, SVU takes place in New York; I&#39;m not sure where <i>Supernatural</i> takes place . . .)</p>

            <p>To answer the last part first: For some reason it never occurred to me to check up on the names Benson and Stabler. I&#39;ll have to do a small re-write where I have the agents send them home to their own canon.<br>And while I&#39;m at it, I can look into my overuse of the word &#39;charge&#39;. I hadn&#39;t thought much about it, but I can see your point.<br><br>Also thank you for your kind words. It&#39;s been a very long while since my last mission, so it&#39;s nice to know that I didn&#39;t do too bad with this one.<br><br>I had no sources for the Reannual other than what it said on the wiki and of course how the annual grape wines work in Discworld. I looked around, but there just seemed to be nothing. If nobody objects to my interpretation, I&#39;ll add it to the wiki along with a link to the interlude so the page can get a bit more content.<br><br>Ammy is short for Amaterasu, the Japanese sun goddess and also the protagonist in Ōkami, Mittens&#39; absolute favourite game (and mine). I&#39;ve shown him play it once or twice, but mostly it&#39;s an injoke to amuse my non-PPC friends who read the mission. <sup>^</sup> (Also, really trivial trivia about me: I once named one of my foster kittens Ammy.)<br>I wanted the baby to have a new first name because otherwise, she would end up being named Elisabeth Moss and while she is a great actress, it just struck me as being confusing.<br><br>I think having a page for Miss MacKinnon would be a great idea. If Mittens is going to visit the Nursery, she will probably feature again. And I remember the mission where you recruited her, that&#39;s why I picked her for this. :D</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if re-reporting a fic that fell off the Unclaimed Badfic list is allowed, but I don&#39;t want to claim something <i>not</i> on the list and get in trouble when I ask for Permission. So, here&#39;s &quot;The Day I Became Mew&quot; once again for your blatant wish-fulfillment &quot;pleasure&quot;: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/894267/"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/894267/">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/894267/</a></a><br><br>In which Mew&#39;s tail is bulbous, the male lead&#39;s pet cat becomes a Cute Animal Friend (and later Cute Pokйmon Friend), another bit wakes up with her hair on fire, the narration frequently damages the fourth wall and confuses tenses, cat biology is mishandled, the formatting is peculiar, the prose is light brown, and logic takes a small vacation.<br><br>I call vanilla Crunch-coated Dibs on her. (And will say as much when I get around to creating a wiki account)</p>

            <p>I found this fic for &quot;The Raven&quot; by Edgar Allen Poe.  I&#39;ve got an idea in my head to turn it into a mission, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s <i>really</i> dumb enough to justify a mission, or if I&#39;m letting my desire to do an unusual mission blind me to the actual quality of the fic.

            <p>Absolute Zero is normally defined by every atom in your sample being in its ground state. That&#39;s pretty much impossible to achieve, so in every real measurement, you&#39;ll have a few atoms in higher energy states. The more high-energy-state atoms you have, the higher the temperature. By that definition, it&#39;s impossible to go below Absolute Zero.<br><br>But they&#39;re not using that definition. What they&#39;ve done is push <i>more than half</i> of the atoms into higher energy states - no, into the <i>highest possible</i> energy state - and claimed that&#39;s a negative temperature. They&#39;re using a definition whereby... well, this is the paragraph that explained it to me:<br><br><i>That a system at negative temperature is hotter than any system at positive temperature is paradoxical if absolute temperature is interpreted as an average kinetic energy of the system. The paradox is resolved by understanding temperature through its more rigorous definition as the tradeoff between energy and entropy, with the reciprocal of the temperature, thermodynamic beta, as the more fundamental quantity. Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system. Systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.</i><br><br>Right, I think I&#39;ve actually got it now:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>In our normal view of atoms, the energy levels start from zero - the ground state - and head upwards into infinity. There are infinitely many energy states. <i>But</i>, it is possible to induce a situation with <i>finite</i> energy states.<br><br>Normal temperature is a measure of disorder. The &#39;most ordered&#39; state - the state with the lowest entropy - is the one where everything is in the lowest energy state (ie, all identical). Adding more energy moves some of the atoms to higher energy states; a less ordered situation.<br><br>But this system has an <i>upper</i> limit as well. Once you get more than half of your atoms into that highest energy state, adding energy can only put <i>more</i> into that state - increasing the ordered nature of the system. You&#39;re into a fundamentally different kind of &#39;temperature&#39;, one where adding energy takes you <i>closer</i> to a perfectly ordered system, rather than away from it. Bam - negative temperature.<br><br>The key difference is that &#39;-0K&#39; - the perfectly ordered negative state - is <i>not</i> synonymous with &#39;0K&#39;. All your atoms are in the exact opposite state - the top limit, not the bottom.<br><br>But still, pretty cool - or hot!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t always mention my birthday, and I usually don&#39;t bother mentioning when I&#39;m going to be away (I always come back), but I figure doing both at the same time is reasonable.<br><br>So hey, I&#39;m 29 today. I&#39;m probably gonna go get myself a haircut. Whee! (Yeah, nobody cares about 29. Feel free to save your givvadams for next year. <sup>_~</sup> )<br><br>Also, I&#39;m not going to be around much this month. I&#39;ve got a long vacation coming up for the 21st-28th, and between now and then I&#39;ve got a lot of things to do—transitioning to a new phone and a new laptop being among my top priorities. There&#39;s also the usual: the job, where I&#39;ve recently gained new responsibilities; daily tasks like feeding myself (would anyone else gladly give up food if they could, just to save the time of shopping, cooking, face-stuffing, and dishes?); expectations of people to interact with them and maybe even do the occasional favor, like we&#39;re friends or something; and trying to get some writing done in between. I&#39;m swamped.<br><br>Finally, just to give this post one more reason to exist, I made an interesting discovery last night. Well, it&#39;s interesting to me. While I was saving mulberry&#39;s spin-off, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/658458/1/">&quot;Clan of the Cactus,&quot;</a> I decided to take a peek at the reviews. To my utter surprise, I found one that I myself had left on chapter 4, dated June 3, 2003. I was 17, with 18 just around the corner. This is the earliest evidence of my PPC involvement that I&#39;m aware of, and I describe myself as &quot;a follower of the PPC&quot; and &quot;PPC supporter,&quot; &quot;not an employee yet.&quot;<br><br>Later, in August 2003, the Oddlots PPC bulletin board would be updated with a post about a bad <i>Farscape</i> fic, and that would spur me to my first mission-writing attempt, with Artemis (the first one) as my co-writer. That&#39;s been my only reference point for when I joined for years. Now I know I must&#39;ve found the PPC prior to June 2003. I can&#39;t tell how much prior, but it&#39;s nice to be able to definitively place myself on a solid point in time, even if it&#39;s not the exact date of discovery.<br><br>And, it made me realize I should save the reviews on PPC spin-offs when possible, to preserve the valuable data of names, dates, and context there, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Do I have things right the third time? Let&#39;s see. It&#39;s been just under three weeks since last time, but I think I have addressed the major problems I had before.<br><br>So, here are my agents. Again.<br><br><br>Agent #1) <br><br>Name: Spencer Ellis<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 32<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Sky blue<br>- Hair: Light brown, short and combed<br>- Height: Average<br>Additional Features:<br>- He is rather fat, but not morbidly obese<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br>Personality: He is highly focused on academics, has greater need for dominance, leadership and attention than is usual, and he prefers initiating activity. He is very detail oriented, and can therefore catch things about someone&#39;s personality that others wouldn&#39;t based on small bits of evidence. He can learn very quickly, and he feels uncomfortable without a detailed plan laid out. He therefore is strongly agitated whenever someone doesn&#39;t follow the plan. Likewise, he becomes irritated whenever someone does something without telling him first. He holds the emotional needs of others in very low consequence, and is therefore not generally liked among the other, rather mentally unstable Agents he frequently comes into contact with. In addition, he has a dark side to him that could result in him becoming violent, especially when he is stressed out. That being said, his mental stability is questionable at times of great tribulations when he feels he has very little control over anything. However, he hates losing someone during a mission and will obssess over their overall safety. Lastly, he holds views of reformed Mary Sues that border on racism, constantly blaming Agent Bessie for the team&#39;s shortcomings and misfortunes and calling her a Mary Sue.<br><br>Backstory: Spencer Ellis and Melvin Moore were both lawyers in Maycomb County, Alabama, alongside their peer, Atticus Finch, in a To Kill a Mockingbird fanfic. Ellis, unlike Atticus, however, was notorious for his predilection toward confrontations and even getting personally involved in one particularly violent arrest (which he does not like to go into great detail of). One particular case in which he served as the prosecutor, the Case of Marietta Crocker, drew the attention of a pair of assassins from the PPC, one of whom was named Plank, who proceeded to kill the Mary Sue, Marietta Crocker, in the county jail.<br><br>Fascinated by their methods, Ellis and Moore decided to join the PPC. While Moore decided to apply for a job in the Department of Internal Affairs, Ellis tried out for a position in The Legal Department, but was turned down because he &quot;wasn&#39;t what they were looking for&quot;. <br><br>Dissatisfied with this, Ellis joined various Departments- the Department of Plagiarism and the Department of Technical Errors, to name a few- but was transfered for various reasons, such as the inability to play well with others and attempting to get directly involved in missions he was not given. Mostly, however, he was just badly suited for the jobs he was given. He eventually got a job in the Department of Finance, but deeply hated that he was not &quot;doing his Duty&quot;.<br><br>He was finally moved once again to the Department of Mary Sues, because it was suspected by the Flowers for which he once worked that he was struggling to control certain homicidal urges which the DMS thrived on.<br><br><br>Agent #2)<br><br>Name: A. W. &quot;Bessie&quot; Besserdchenney<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 21<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Unremarkable Brown<br>- Hair color: Brown, shoulder length<br>- Height: A little short for her age<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br>Personality: She has a playful wit that she uses to either pull elaborate pranks on people or make fun of them. However, this does not make her intelligent, and she is prone to foolhardy moves in combat. She tries to stick to a &quot;strict code of honor&quot;, meaning that she tries not to murder canon characters or Original Characters who are not Mary Sues or Gary Stus. She is unaware that she was a Mary Sue in a previous life, and takes offense whenever someone calls her one. However, it does bother her that people call her one enough to where she has slowly ceased trusting the Flowers, because she thinks that they may know something they are not telling her.<br><br>Abilities: A powerhouse duelist, she is not a tactician and will usually go for a frontal assault. That being said, however, she can eventually learn from her mistakes and successes. <br><br>Backstory: The character that would come to be known as Bessie originated in a nearly forgotten Shakespeare Suefic. She was captured by PPC agents Plank and Wells, and her story was destroyed because of its mechanics and horrible geography and flora and fauna.<br><br>The experiments that Plank performed on her worked, if only in part, and Plank insisted that she be inducted as an Agent, despite various protests from a vocal minority in the PPC that Bessie, as she was now called, was not fully de-Sued. <br><br>However, Bessie did become an Agent, and her first job was with the Disturbing Acts of Violence Department, Action Division. She participated in several difficult assignments, and earned some respect from her fellow agents.<br><br>However, she was removed from the Department due to her overly violent outbursts resulting from massive consumption of Flaming Balrog after missions. She was sent to the Medical Department, where she had a six week recovery period, and which sent her to the Character Protective Services upon orders from the Flowers, ostensibly because of something she may have said in her drunken stupor.<br><br>It was during this time that Bessie became infatuated by various Harry Potter and Twilight characters. <br><br>After a distinguished mission in which Bessie saved Sirius Black from a Mary Sue Death Eater, she was transfered, because of her skill at and joy with killing said Mary Sue, to the Department of Mary Sues as an assassin. However, it is also rumored that the Asphodel didn&#39;t want to deal with Bessie for some reason.<br><br><br>Agent #3)<br><br>Name: Vivian Elsa Wells<br><br>Species: Human <br><br>Age: 29<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Brown<br>- Hair: Dirty blonde, blown back so that it sticks up<br>- Height: Average<br><br>Department : Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division<br><br>Abilities: Aside from her extensive knowledge of animals, plants, land masses and time paradoxes, Wells possesses a strange ability to run at superhuman speeds, which resulted from a mission into the South Park continuum.<br><br>Personality: Vivian Wells is a woman with a manic and unruly personality. She really enjoys physical activities that involve her use of her insane bursts of speed, such as racing people. She also loves junk food, and adores the color pink, unicorns, and throwing parties. She goes into long talks about such activities as cooking, fashion misshaps, the attractiveness of other female Agents, etc. She also likes to go shopping whenever she can, but at the same time she is wise with her money, usually only buying things that she thinks will be useful in some way. She likes to tease people and pull elaborate pranks on them when she knows it won&#39;t hurt their feelings <i>too much</i>. She has mastered the puppy face and can sometimes whine and complain when she doesn&#39;t get her way. Concerning her extensive knowledge, she has trouble recalling what she knows due in large part to her perpetual adrenaline surge. Whenever something happens to someone she is close to, she gets very worried.<br><br>Backstory: Previously a member of the Official Fanfiction University of the Twilight Saga, Vivian Wells joined the PPC as a member of the Department of Floaters. However, she quickly gained a vast career, joining various Departments, such as Geographical Abberations, Misplaced Flora and Fauna, Bad Slash and Temporal Offenses. <br><br>Unfortunately, it was during her tenure in the Department of Temporal Offenses that she and a few other agents got caught in a temporal distortion, from which Wells foresaw something that deeply troubled her. This experience traumatized her, causing her to become very concerned whenever someone she is close to gets in danger, and causing her to develop a fear of strobe lights.<br><br>She was assisted in her recovery by Agent Plank, who had recently lost his own partner and had seen her records. After this time, she joined Agent Plank on the field, eventually capturing Bessie.<br><br>Wells then faced a troubling time in her life. Because of his exposure to a particularly powerful Mary Sue, Bessie, and other factors, Plank began to exhibit some Mary Sue traits. However, instead of the usual effects, it began to drive him insane with obsession and self destructive tendencies.<br><br><br>Agent #4)<br><br>Name: Alfred Plank<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 59<br><br>Appearance:<br>- Eye color: Grey<br>- Hair: White and messy<br>- Height: Slightly above average<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sue Experimentation and Research<br><br>Abilities: Aside from being a crack shot with a Phaser and an ambitious inventer, Plank is a veteran agent with a highly developed understanding of Mary Sues and Sue Wraiths.<br><br>Personality: He has a scientific curiosity in all things to do with Mary Sues, going beyond normal boundaries and even coming across as obsessive and pushy. He takes risks that most other scientists wouldn&#39;t take, such as purposefully ingesting large amounts of glitter on a regular basis to test possible antidotes, even though they mostly make the symptoms worse most of the time, partly because he is going crazy. He considers Mary Sues to be very nearly sentient, but lacking a few crucial personality traits. When he became Sued, his obsession with finding a &quot;proper&quot; cure only intensified. <br><br>Backstory: Little is known about his early life, except that he probably came from a Star Trek fanfic. What is known is that he joined at about the same time as Makes-Things. During his training, he began showing an aptitude for using chemical components as weapons. Because of this, he was made an assassin in the Department of Mary Sues. <br><br>He went through several partners, all of whom have apparently been killed in action or snapped on the job. It was then that he met Agent Vivian Wells, who he helped recover from a particularly disturbing stint stuck in a temporal distortion, and with whom he began a partnership thereafter.<br><br>The partnership was successful, until nearly five years later, when the PPC discovered a badfic that has since been wiped out. The target Mary Sue was captured instead of killed so that Plank could study Mary Sue psychology and learn new ways to alter their minds.<br><br>Because of his contact with powerful Mary Sues over the years, his tendency to ingest unsafe amounts of glitter, and his immediately testing his own product, Bleepium, to counteract the effects of the glitter, his already questionable mental stability began to seriously decline. And because of this, he was relieved of his Duty in the DMS. <br><br>However, his obsession won out, and he became an unofficial member of the Department of Mary Sue Experimentation and Research. Since then, he has been in a lot of trouble, particularly for when he forged documents that got him his assistants. (It is widely believed that this is what happened, but the evidence supporting this is circumstantial.)<br><br>To this day, he strives to find a true cure for Mary Sues.<br><br><br><br>Control Prompt- Mission Assignment<br><br><br>[BEEEP] <br><br>Lights flickered across the flashy little bulbs installed around the console. It was time yet again for a mission. Agent Ellis groaned, slumped out of his scratchy armchair, and began pressing the necessary buttons. <i> I may as well get all the details now so that I can tell Bessie and Wells both at once and save some time. </i><br><br>As he read the report, however, he swore quietly. &quot;Sanfield.&quot; <i> That dirtbag! </i><br><br>Ellis finished reading, all the while feeling as if he needed Bleeprin, just by reading the report, and readied himself for giving his orders. He cleared his throat and gave a loud &quot;Bessie! Wells! Front and center!&quot;<br><br>But there was no reply.<br><br>&quot;BESSIE!!! WELLS!!! FRONT AND CENTER, DADGUMMIT!!!&quot;<br><br>There was movement from Bessie &#39; s side of the RC, followed by some incoherent muttering, and Bessie emerged from her bedroom, bleary eyed and grouchy. &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We got a mission.&quot; Ellis explained. &quot;Where&#39;s Wells?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um, Wells?&quot; Bessie rubbed her eyes. &quot;She, uh, went shopping, I think. Or she went to visit Plank. I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br><br>Ellis swore under his breath. &quot;If she ain&#39;t here in ten seconds-&quot;<br><br>Suddenly, the door burst open and a push of air nearly knocked both agents over. Wells had arrived, and she had several packages tucked under her arms.<br><br>&quot;Hey, guys! What&#39;s up?&quot; She shook her head, knocking what looked like paint chippings out of her blown-back hair.<br><br>&quot;Where were ya?! We have a mission ready.&quot; <br><br>Wells placed the packages down on the console. &quot;I was visiting Plank.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Told you.&quot; Bessie smirked as she rubbed her eyes.<br><br>&quot;Shut up. Wells, I told ya not to go anywhere without tellin&#39; me first. We could get a mission.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Sure thing, big guy.&quot; Wells reached into the smallest package and handed each of her partners an earpiece, putting one in her own ear. &quot;Can you hear me, Plank?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s an affirmative, Miss Wells,&quot; replied the German-accented Agent Plank from the other end of the line. <br><br><i>Oh boy.</i> Ellis placed the earpiece into his ear and demanded, &quot;I thought the DIA removed ya from your lab.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, well, they did,&quot; Plank answered awkwardly. &quot;But it is going to take more than even the misguided opinions of the Flowers to keep me from my work!&quot;<br><br><i>Typical Plank. No idea how deluded he is. Oh well, he has his uses.</i> Ellis eyed the packages. &quot;What&#39;re those?&quot;<br><br>Wells smiled and ripped one open, producing a very large Claymore sword. &quot;Plank wanted to give us an arsenal on hand so that we can easily go into any franchise armed with the appropriate weapons.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Plank chimed in. &quot;Why go through all the trouble of visiting the Armory when you have one of your own?&quot;<br><br>Bessie scoffed. &quot;We&#39;re assassins. We don&#39;t need weapons to kill our targets.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It makes it a lot easier.&quot; Ellis pointed out, taking out an M41A Pulse Rifle with an attached U1 Grenade Launcher. &quot;Good thing we got these. &#39;Cuz guess where we&#39;re going.&quot;<br><br><br><br>Random Prompt- One Agent tries to use a Lightsaber without proper training<br><br>&quot;Where are we supposed to put all this stuff, anyway?&quot; Ellis ripped open yet another package from Plank, finding it full of various types of grenades.<br><br>As Bessie opened a large package nearby, she suggested, &quot;Maybe we can get permission to renovated.&quot;<br><br>Ellis spluttered. &quot;Pf-yeah, we&#39;re gonna have to. Ain&#39;t no way we&#39;re gonna fit all these weapons in here with all your trophies and Wells&#39; useless junk.&quot;<br><br>Nearby, sitting beside the console, Wells looked up from her own package with a scowl. &quot;My stuff isn&#39;t useless!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah? Like the last mission,&quot; Ellis recalled, &quot;you packed a beach hat-&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was a gardening hat,&quot; Wells corrected him, pulling open her package and stacking packs of bullets. &quot;Besides, it was for a Total Drama Island fanfic. It was not outrageously out of place.&quot;<br><br>Ellis rolled his eyes and got to unpacking yet another parcel.<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Bessie began inspecting something from Ellis&#39; package, turning it over in her hand. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s a lightsaber!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t turn that on!&quot; Ellis and Wells both shouted frantically.<br><br>But Bessie did so anyway, pointing the bright green blade away from her partners. &quot;I&#39;ll be able to do some real devastation with this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Put it away before ya break something,&quot; Ellis demanded.<br><br>&quot;You might hurt yourself, Bessie.&quot; Wells&#39; eyes had widened to a size that was normally not possible, save for someone who was about to experience a panic attack. &quot;Only people with years of training can use one of those.&quot;<br><br>But Bessie was too absorbed by her new found weapon. &quot;How hard could it be? I won&#39;t hurt myself.&quot; And with that, she began swinging it around precariously.<br><br>SWUNG-SSHHH!!!<br><br>&quot;GET THE DOCTORS!!!&quot; Ellis bellowed.<br><br><br>Here is a link to the badfic I want to start with. <a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7398957/1/The_Siren"><a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7398957/1/The_Siren">https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7398957/1/The_Siren</a></a><br><br>Crossing my fingers. </p>

            <p>Having reread your request, reread your other requests, and seen your response to Phobos, I would have to say my call on this is <b>denied</b>. Again - this isn&#39;t permanent, but I <i>highly</i> recommend you put this on hold for a while - longer than a few weeks - while you do some more reading and work on your writing, especially humor. hS pointed this out before, and it holds true; the most important thing about most missions is the humorous aspect. Most of what we write is satire, and that takes something of a deft touch, and it doesn&#39;t really come automatically to anyone. <br><br>Other than that, though, the issue is compounded by what appears to be a somewhat disingenuous move on your part. You were told - multiple times, IIRC - that Emergencies were discouraged and you should go for Agents without the big alternate-universe subplot. You resubmitted your agents twice, but now it looks like rather than decide to revamp the idea, you just, as Phobos has pointed out, threw a blanket over the parts that didn&#39;t jibe with a normal permission request. I hate to say it, but that says to me that you care more about getting your plot written than you do about being honest with the community about your intentions, and that worries me a lot. The whole reason the skepticism and issues with Emergencies came about was because people took big, game-changing ideas and ran with them without consulting the community who&#39;d be effected.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to discourage you from writing these agents, or from writing for the PPC. But I <i>do</i> want to express how strongly I feel about the fact that you presented this in a different way than the direction in which your actual intentions lie. The thing is - again, as has been pointed out - there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with Big Ideas! I really like the idea of doing something different! But... again, what you&#39;ve got going on here is up several difficulty levels, and between that, and your writing sample (inconsistent dialogue, some clunky writing, some lack of humor, some ...off character interactions: despite now knowing where they came from, they still come off as a bit awkward), and the background, I&#39;m going to have to say no this time around.<br><br></p>

            <p>Missed the mark once again, huh? That&#39;s fine. I understand.

            <p>The appropriate size of an emergency for someone who is just starting out is <i>don&#39;t try</i>. The people who have pulled off events like that in the past have all been people who were around for a good while and had written plenty of other PPC stuff first—and even then, when Tawaki did it (and <i>kept</i> doing it), that resulted in a fair number of people being rather unhappy with him. Even some of hS&#39;s big ideas flopped. As VM pointed out, this sort of thing is difficult to pull off well, even for experienced PPCers, which you are not yet.<br><br>And you don&#39;t <i>need</i> to pull it off. The thing that&#39;s been most bothering me about all this is your inability to let go of this notion that you need to write something big and epic for your characters, even if you leave the rest of HQ out of it. It&#39;s like this:<br><br>The PPC Network is looking for a small-budget TV series. We can afford kick-ass writers and a few actors, and we&#39;ve got connections, so maybe we can bring in a special guest star now and then; and we&#39;ve got a studio and some solid costumes and practical effects that have held up over previous runs. You are trying to pitch the plot of a big-screen summer blockbuster with action and drama and sub-plots and special effects and CGI set pieces and a bunch of extras. No matter how many times you say &quot;Well, okay, but what if instead of ten CGI set pieces, five explosions, and a thousand extras it&#39;s just seven CGI set pieces, two explosions, and a hundred extras? Would that be okay?&quot;, it&#39;s still not in the budget. Now, if your show is successful, then maybe we&#39;ll be able to afford Dark Brother&#39;s Spin-off: The Movie one day, but it is not this day. The appropriate thing to do is put the movie script in mothballs and focus on making a great TV show. If the show runs without a hitch for a season or two, then <i>maybe</i> you can try pitching the movie again; but if we keep smelling whiffs of big-budget explode-o-drama on your show script, it&#39;s not gonna get approved. We cannot afford it. Period.<br><br>... So, if you&#39;re still with me after that, what I want to say is this: I think you&#39;ve got potential. Your latest request is a lot better than the previous ones, and you&#39;re clearly capable of taking feedback and learning from it, which is fantastic. You also seem like a nice guy, which helps a lot. What&#39;s holding you back is stubbornly clinging to this invasion idea. What we <i>don&#39;t</i> want is to give you Permission and then have to watch your every move to make sure you don&#39;t do something we&#39;ll regret. Let it go, let Permission go for a good while (I dunno, the ol&#39; &quot;one month&quot; ruler maybe?), go some time without feeling the need to inquire about previous emergencies, invasions, etc.; let us see you focusing on other things. That&#39;s what we really want. Maybe write some short non-PPC fics to practice. But do anything, really, as long as it&#39;s miles from emergency-resurrected-Sue-invading-kersplosion, just so we know you <i>can</i> do other things.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Multi-Boarder Emergencies are something big that requires special conditions to begin. In fact, after the post-Tawaki period there was only one big one - the Blackout - and even then it was something born &quot;on&quot; the board instead of someone coming up with it. (Basically, all started from that year&#39;s April Fools board joke.)<br><br>Single-boarder Emergencies are... well, I&#39;d say that the only one I&#39;ve seen so far is my own, so I hope Dark Brother didn&#39;t misunderstand due to it and thinks that&#39;s normal happening. It isn&#39;t.<br><br>It&#39;s a first that I&#39;m &quot;trying out&quot; after being here for quite a bit (for years now), and that&#39;s supposed to wrap up the backstories of my Agents. Using Neshomeh&#39;s example, Blank Sprite is the &quot;Sergio Turbo&#39;s Spinoff: The Movie&quot; acting as a grand finale to &quot;Sergio Turbo&#39;s Spinoff&quot;.<br><br>Oh, and I started working on it not only after my Agents were already &quot;settled&quot; as characters, but I also spent more than a year working on the concept before starting to write it. And yet, I&#39;m not sure it will even work in the end.<br>Emergencies are a big thing. Don&#39;t underestimate them.</p>

            <p>Actually, it&#39;s <i>re</i>make - it&#39;s been suggested to you several times already:<br><br>Start with two agents. In fact, let me solidify that: start with Ellis and Wells.

PPC missions, the things we do here. Agents, badfic, spork.<br><br>Because part of the problem you&#39;re facing is that right now, no-one cares about your characters. How could we? We don&#39;t know them. They&#39;re just names and bios. So putting them in situations of dire peril is... &#39;well, okay, but which one&#39;s which again?&#39;.<br><br>Start with missions. Start with <i>a</i> mission. In fact, since you&#39;re clearly willing to write lots and lots of words in order to get Permission: <b>write a mission</b>.<br><br>Seriously. In accordance with <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=259252;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this proposal of mine</a> (which, huh, was on your last request), write a full-length PerMission. Show us Ellis and Wells before Bessie was transferred from the DCPS to join them. Show us what an actual PPC mission will look like with your two most normal agents. Show us that you can focus on sporking a badfic, not the big events you keep trying to plan.<br><br>And when you&#39;re done, get it beta&#39;d, and ask for Permission with your PerMission as your sole piece of content. I promise here and now that I will personally read it, concrit it, and decide what PGs are supposed to be here to decide: whether you are capable of writing PPC missions.<br><br>What do you say?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Is it in any way acceptable to create a character from a badfic for the sole purpose of assimilating them into the PPC? I have an idea for this goat from a Narnia badfic that I will probably wind up doing for my PerMission, but I want to be absolutely sure. I think I remember it being done before with Agent Fritz Sorgebrunnen and Silas during the Cupcakes mission, but I haven&#39;t read any of the variations of that badfic, except the one with better spelling and grammar than the original. I don&#39;t know if that character was in a different adaptation or made up, so is it allowed to make them up, if they are meant to join?</p>

            <p>When sporking, you should not make things up that are not present in the badfic. Exaggerating and interpreting things that <i>are</i> in the badfic for the sake of humor, yes; making stuff up and claiming it&#39;s from the fic, no. That would be misrepresenting your subject material, which is bad. Plus, if you start feeling that you have to invent things to make the mission more interesting, it may not be a very good choice of target in the first place. <i>Plus</i> plus, hS wants you to focus on writing your two main agents for this. Creating more characters would not be the brightest move for you at this time.

It&#39;s part of my upbringing.<br><br>It&#39;s going well. I&#39;ve started on Hotel Nights by Trojanhorse and Soulshadow. <br><br>I have made a decision with Bad Slash and Slash in general. I find it revolting, and I believe that Hotel Nights will be the final Bad Slash mission that I read. I just don&#39;t have the stomach for it. (And this is coming from a guy who, among other things, watches documentaries on Pol Pot and Jack the Ripper, considers a dream with Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Chucky the Doll, Leatherface, Norman Bates, Jigsaw, Ghostface, Pennywise the Dancing Clown, and Slender to be a happy dream, and even purposefully tunes into national news to get angry at politics, just because I&#39;m bored. I can take all these things, and not Bad Slash! Ha!)<br><br>However, I do find the exorcisms to be interesting. Since I have only read three whole missions, I haven&#39;t read any stories where the Sue Wraith gets especially violent yet. Pity.</p>

            <p>I want to be clear, I am not going to act as a permission giver for the remainder of this request, unless there is a split decision and we need a tie breaker.<br><br>I haven&#39;t really said much about your permission requests in the past, and there is a reason for that.  I have some misgivings about your material, but it has always been too vague for me to put into words.  I think it is becoming clearer, so let me ask some questions and try to explain my theory.  Please, don&#39;t hold back in your reply, even if it means giving spoilers.<br><br><br>I note that there is a bit about a potential DIA Agent named Melvin Moore.  I also recall that you talked, a long while ago, about a DIA Agent that seemed to have it in for your team.  Are you still planning that storyline?<br><br>Why is it so important that Wells has super speed?  This power has been a constant for the character, even through multiple re-writes of how she got it, so there must be some reason for the power to exist.<br><br>Plank is a villain, isn&#39;t he?  The slow descent into madness.  The &quot;apparent&quot; deaths and/or snapping of all of his previous partners.  Drinking copious amounts of glitter.  Forging documents to get assistants.  The signs are all there.<br><br><br>What I am getting at is the shape of the story.  You keep trying to be mysterious about it.  It is kind of like you are throwing a blanket over a sofa.  You can see the shape of the sofa (the plot points and important details) under the blanket (the few details you&#39;ve given us).  Here is where my concern comes in.<br><br>I don&#39;t think you have a sofa under that blanket.  I think you&#39;re trying really hard to make it look like a sofa, when it is something else entirely.  There are faint shapes under the blanket that worry me.  You&#39;ve got a character who you want me to think is one of your protagonists, but looks like a villain.  You have powers that seem too important to you for how little attention you want to draw to them.  You have characters who don&#39;t look to have any purpose except for a plot that people had issues with, and that you haven&#39;t brought up in your requests.  It seems to me that you are hiding all the red flags under that blanket and hoping we don&#39;t notice.<br><br>You clearly have long, complicated stories planned.  There is nothing inherently wrong with that; hS has written some of the longest, most complicated stories around, after all.  What I have a problem with is if you are intentionally hiding story elements that you think we will have a problem with, just to get permission.<br><br><br>So, now comes your part.  Prove to me that it&#39;s a sofa.  No more mysteries.  No more secrets.  Just show me the shape of your story.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Okay. I was hoping to keep it on ice until I got a feel for writing missions and mastered my understanding of the PPC material, and all that, but sure, I&#39;ll explain what I have in mind.<br><br>Yes, I am still planning to give Melvin Moore a story line, but he has evolved since I suggested him. He dislikes my agents, but is more interested in preserving the PPC and stuff, as he stands now. And that&#39;s the thing. As you have done, Moore is under the impression that Agent Plank is insane and evil and stuff. He believes that he has lost his grip on his senses and that Bessie has not been properly reformed, and that Plank essentially created a time bomb. And I have several minor characters who agree with him. For example, the agent I mentioned in one of my writing prompts, Sanfield, from Intelligence. They are the vocal minority that believe that Plank is not just insane, but that he is dangerous. <br><br>I never intended Plank to be the villain, though. The idea was that he joined the DMS and accepted some very dangerous missions in his time. He made it out, at times very much scathed, but his partners didn&#39;t. Yet another factor contributing to his opinion on Mary Sues. He used to hate them, but then his scientific curiosity began to take hold. He wanted to make sure that he could find a way to keep Mary Sues from ever coming back. However, the more he looked into it, the more he became convinced that Mary Sues could very easily become workable characters, and he began to view them as diseased, or mentally disabled, or something of the same level of pitiable. He began trying to find a cure for Mary Sues that could be used to surgically add personality traits that could develop into characterization. Of course, he had to test his products, and he began to do so on himself. That&#39;s why he consumes glitter in such large quantities. <br><br>As for the powers I keep giving Wells, I have a subplot in mind for that. In the Temporal Anomaly or disruption- I think I said it was a Temporal Distortion- Wells saw a vision of people she was and would get close to dying and suffering in the most unpleasant ways imaginable. Because of these new powers, she tries to be there for everyone at once. Needless to say, she won&#39;t always succeed, but with her new powers, she will try.<br><br>What I am hiding is a little conspiracy to have Plank and Bessie removed from the PPC. There is going to be a small detachment of Mary Sues in valved, shipped in courtesy of the Venomous Tentacula. That is what I have in mind for my storyline, separate from the missions. Or intertwined with them, I&#39;m still fine tuning it. <br><br>That is allowed, right?<br></p>

            <p>You&#39;re still presenting a big, complex mass of many agents, backstories, and inter-relationships all at once, to overwhelm the PGs.  Probably not a good idea.<br><br>(And, it also has the side effect of looking like all the really exciting, interesting events in their PPC careers have already happened in the backstories, so whatever happens in the main stories could be an anticlimax compared to that!)<br><br>I&#39;ve said it before, but IMHO it might be better if you started with just Wells and Plank.  Over the course of writing their missions and stories, you introduce the other characters gradually, and allow us to see Plank&#39;s steady decline into madness taking place before our own eyes.  Seeing things happen over several stories would also help us understand some of the more puzzling things about the backstory, such as:<br><br>Exactly how did Wells get superhuman speed on a South Park mission?  Did it come from the temporal distortion she fell into?  (i.e. When she runs, time flows differently for her, or something like that?)  Or was that a different mission?<br><br>How could Plank join at the same time as Makes-Things?  Makes-Things was the very first human ever to join,  and IIRC the next two were female LARPers who became assassins.  Even if Plank was the fourth human to join and this is a case of &quot;<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">Remember the New Guy</a>&quot;, as that TV Tropes page points out: &quot;More than one Mary Sue is introduced this way in fanfiction.&quot;  Not something that&#39;s going to be too popular here!<br><br>Talking of Plank, what is he officially supposed to be doing now?  He&#39;s been &quot;relieved of his Duty in the DMS&quot; and is unofficially working for Experimentation and Research, but what do the Flowers think he&#39;s doing?  And why isn&#39;t  anyone from DIA keeping an eye on him after all the trouble he&#39;s been in?<br><br>Having said that, I still love the characters of Ellis, Bessie, and Wells, despite their very confusing backstories.  I hope you do get permission to write them someday.<br></p>

            <p>(Sorry - though I&#39;ve been reading fairly frequently, and have loosely followed* the permissions requests, classes and newspapering haven&#39;t left me much time to comment in the last several months, so I&#39;d feel a little awkward jumping in with an Official Call.)<br><br>The first thing I&#39;d say is, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re tired of hearing this, but... slow down. I also am sure you don&#39;t want to do this, but try to stop thinking about your &#39;verse and your agents for a little while and just be a part of the community. Seriously. If this is the point where one of the other PGs decides you&#39;ve done it all and sundry and are granted... I&#39;d still wait a while before you do a mission. Write with your agents, interact, read lots of goodfic. Read a <i>lot</i> of goodfic. Hey, just to keep the mind happy, right?<br><br>Anyway. I hate to say it, but to me, Wells&#39; accent still comes off kinda awkward. Honestly, I&#39;d scrap the whole &quot;ya&quot; for you thing and spend some time... h&#39;m. Watching Firefly, I think, especially Jayne. Listen to the way characters like Wells - or like you want her to be - talk, and the way they phrase things, and spend some time writing like that. Oh! Granny Weatherwax, from <i>Discworld</i>, or Nanny Ogg - they&#39;d be good sources, too. Dialogue is important, and hard - and characters&#39; voices are important, and hard. I guess that&#39;s my biggest recommendation. Read a lot of the things you want to emulate.<br><br>With regards to your agent profiles... you don&#39;t seem to have addressed some of hS&#39; critiques? You added a piece about unstable violence to Ellis, and a minor piece of lawyer context, but that&#39;s it on him. With Bessie, you changed more things, which is good! But... she&#39;s still a &quot;powerhouse duelist&quot; who is prone to foolhardy moves.<br><br>Wells - I&#39;m confused about her. The relationship with Plank seems problematic - not in a &quot;you shouldn&#39;t write this&quot; way, in a &quot;these characters are unhealthy and it could be interesting&quot; way, but I think you definitely want to elaborate on that, rather than leave it ambiguous. Your last paragraph is a little confusing, for example. Is Plank actually insane? Does Wells know this? Does anyone acknowledge this, outside of Ellis&#39; inner monologue?<br><br>Okay, you go a little more into Wells and Plank in Plank&#39;s bio, but it&#39;s still very disturbing between her bio and the &#39;fic sample, and I see that hS has flagged that as well. I&#39;m also very, very, very sketchy about having him have joined at about the same time as Makes-Things. No, the PPC canon isn&#39;t sacred or anything, but... well... Makes-Things has been around basically <i>forever</i>. It would be kinda tough to write this character without doing quite a bit of background in the various PPC histories. Not that it couldn&#39;t be done, just that it would be up a couple levels of difficulty, basically.<br><br>All that said - have you run this through a beta? I don&#39;t see a credit here, and although I don&#39;t know what the deal is currently with Permission requests, it would probably be a good idea to work with someone on this, unless another PG has said otherwise.<br><br>*The other half of that is I honestly still don&#39;t know what the final call was on what does, and does not constitute a formal request.</p>

            <p>I have another question related to emergencies. <br><br>Say there is an invasion of HQ that is quickly quelled by a small handful of agents before news of the invasion even goes through the entire PPC. Is that possible to do?</p>

            <p>An Emergency (note the capital E) is an event has consequences for the entire PPC. HQ being invaded by a large organized force? Deadly virus running though the halls?
