            <p>Never Leave Fanfiction Lying Around, by Crazyroninchic. It has a Tv Tropes page, and there&#39;s a link there.<br><br>So, this is hilarious. It&#39;s set after the Lord of the Rings, and the characters come across and read a story called Tales of a Dream Come True, which is pretty much every LotR Mary Sue cliche mashed up into one story. Their reactions (especially to the Suefic versions of themselves) are uproarious. The only break with canon is that Legolas is still in Middle-Earth, but it&#39;s acceptable as the reason is so that he can be hilariously tortured by the Sue&#39;s romantic relationship with him (what else would the story be, if not a Legomance?).<br><br>Features Suefic!Legolas the lovesick pansy, Thranduil escaping out a window (he REALLY wasn&#39;t ready for the Suefic), and Sues outstaying the Suefic!canon characters at every possible point (much to the outrage of the real canon characters). Is a must-read.</p>

            <p>Crazyroninchic also has a sequel to it where Starr&#39;s kid tries to atone for her mother&#39;s sins... by assassinating her.<br><br>It&#39;s a very entertaining story series. I remember in my younger years printing it out into a binder and taking it with me so I&#39;d always have some Sue-bashing goodness to read about.<br><br>I think crazyroninchic also wrote &quot;I Blame Iendil Ancawen Entirely&quot;? Also a pretty good Sue parody, if ended a bit abruptly. Admittedly, it&#39;s not as parodic as Never Leave Fanfiction Lying Around, so...<br><br>I was really good friends with crazyroninchic back in the day, oh gosh. I even at one point wrote a tie-in fic approved by her where Starr, Celeste, and that darn faerie learnt the consequences of going to Middle-earth. It involved the Fellowship writing letters to Elrond begging him to send them corks for their ears because the Sue-song was so awful. Eledhwen made her first-ever appearance in that fic, actually! That fic served as the springing point for her backstory, where Starr and Co turn out to have been sent from a MS Factory and thus kidnap her...<br><br>Mine&#39;s not on FFN anymore.

            <p>While it is true that practice will help a lot, I find that it often helps to read books that have actually been published. Get a feel for the canon characters, observe as they develop, inspect their flaws. Keep your agent ideas in mind, and as you find out more about characterization, add little bits on to them.<br><br>Another thing to keep in mind is that some character quirks can be traced back to past events. Maybe one of them has horrible table manners. Do they not see a need for table manners? Or were they raised in a way that made them not care about it? A betrayal will cause someone to be less trustful.<br><br>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>I personally read a ton of badfic when I was younger, so when I joined the PPC, all I knew about characterisation was not to make my characters x, y, and z, but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean I knew how to make good characters. <br><br>But then I got into more fandoms and read goodfic in those fandoms, especially good OC fanfiction (they do exist!), and by contrast, my own characters and my own writing got better. Personally, I think the shift in my writing style came when I befriended Miss Cam and kept up with her in the Battlestar Galactica fandom, because then I modelled my own writing style off of hers, and grew from there.<br><br>My rule of thumb when it comes to making characters is to say that I am writing people. I&#39;m not writing an archetype. If they have aspects of archetypes, that&#39;s their thing and definitely not because I intended it to be so. Even if the characters are aliens or Elves or whatever, they were still created by humans, and are meant to reflect humanity in their portrayal in some way. By remembering that I am writing people, I remember that people have quirks and flaws and things that make them tick, and that these things make them different. <br><br>So don&#39;t worry too much. Put your characters on a shelf and just lurk around, analyse why certain characters work for you and why others don&#39;t, and try to use that knowledge to your own advantage.<br><br>(Then again, writing two OFUs has helped me because I have to breathe life into templates submitted by readers, so...)</p>

            <p>In my opinion, ConCrit hurts a lot more than bad crit. Bad crit is easy to ignore (basically the same way you ignore someone calling you an idiot). ConCrit points your flaws out, which hurts. However, therein lies progress as a writer, because when you know what you do wrong, you can remedy it.<br>(I owe this insight to two wonderful people: EllipsisFlood and SOCR from TvTropes. Thank you.)<br>Anyway, ignoring other people&#39;s opinions of your writing is only good when they have nothing to offer (ie, they don&#39;t ConCrit). Especially here; people here, as a rule, don&#39;t bash, so ignoring their opinions only limits you. That said, you don&#39;t have to take them as Torah from Mount Sinai...<br>Also, I reiterate my offer of help from your earlier thread.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s really no need to wallow in self-pity like this. <br><br>I&#39;m sure that each and every one of us on the Board can say that some of their past writing was on the not-so-good side. Heck, some of us were former Suethors, myself included. I once wrote a terrible youfic in the <i>Legend of Zelda</i> verse with the most convoluted plot and terribly overly flashy action sequences all for the sake of the Rule of Cool. After I posted my story online, I re-read my stuff from the beginning (I literally posted the first things that came to mind) and went: &quot;What the heck did I write?&quot; <br><br>I deleted the entire story out of shame shortly afterwards and was afraid of writing anything for months afterwards out of fear of repeating the same mistakes.<br><br>Instead of hating on your writing skills, ask yourself what can be done to improve them. Listen to feedback and read, read, read. Read anything and everything. That way, you&#39;ll see how words and punctuation are used. You&#39;ll see how characters interact in specific situations. You&#39;ll see how to manage characters with supernatural abilities. You&#39;ll see a thousand other things that will inspire you and guide your writing. I kid you not, you&#39;ll become a better writer simply by <i>reading</i>.<br><br>Just take it slow and make sure that this isn&#39;t causing you too much stress. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpd85y_iTxY">Have some soothing music!</a> Writing should be fun, not torture. <br><br><br>Ganbatte! <br></p>

            <p>A suitably hillaribad Suefic involving either dragons or the Phantom of the Opera. Both would be amazing, but I won&#39;t hold my breath. {= ) I&#39;m keeping my own eyes open, of course, but there&#39;s only so much mediocre fic I can stand to scan at a time, so I figured I&#39;d put the word out in the hope of getting Agents Derik and Gall a new mission sooner.<br><br>Dragon-having fandoms I&#39;m especially interested in include the following:<br><br>* <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i><br>* <i>How to Train Your Dragon</i><br>* <i>Temeraire</i>/<i>His Majesty&#39;s Dragon</i> series<br>* <i>Lord of the Rings</i><br>* <i>Discworld</i><br>* <i>Harry Potter</i><br>* <i>Beowulf</i> (the epic poem or the 2007 movie)<br>* <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>/<i>Angel</i> (there was at least one dragon in the finale of <i>Angel</i>, so I&#39;m counting it)<br><br>Others I might consider missioning in, if I can make it work:<br><br>* <i>Dragonheart</i><br>* Generic D&amp;D or <i>Dragonlance</i><br>* <i>Spyro the Dragon</i> (first game only; I haven&#39;t played the others)<br>* <i>Skyrim</i> (yep, I&#39;m playing <i>Skyrim</i> these days. Breton, mostly fighter + alchemy if anyone wants to know.)<br>* <i>Chronicles of Narnia</i><br>* MLP:FIM (because turning your human agents into ponies is always good for a laugh)<br><br>Dragons appearing in continua where they don&#39;t belong are good, too. My user page has a list of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User:Neshomeh#Fandoms">my top fandoms</a>.<br><br>So, if you happen to see anything that looks mission-worthy that involves a Sue, dragons, and/or the Phantom of the Opera, please let me know! Oh, and songfic, I&#39;d take a missionable songfic, too. Thanks!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Not sure if either one will be quite what you&#39;re after, but there&#39;s always a chance.<br><br>The first is <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5057374/1/True-Lovers">True Lovers</a>, which is apparently a <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> and <i>Shrek</i> crossover. I say apparently because it doesn&#39;t really seem to use much of either canon. But it features a man with a disfigured face (he gets better - I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a charge), and has the dragon from <i>Shrek</i>. No actual Sue in this one, but my quick skim of it leads me to believe that most of the recognisable characters are far OOC/possessed. <br><br>The second is <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10126805/1/Spyro-and-Cynder-in-The-Phantom-of-the-Opera">Spyro and Cynder in The Phantom of the Opera</a>, and is pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. It&#39;s script format, and seems to be a condensed retelling of the <i>Phantom</i> storyline using characters from <i>Spyro the Dragon</i>. Or at least, character names from <i>Spyro</i>, as that&#39;s about all you see of them. Not really sure if this one&#39;s missionable though. <br><br>These two are the only fics that I&#39;ve been able to find which even remotely involve both PotO <i>and</i> dragons.<br></p>

            <p>Other people found dragon stuff, so I focused on Erik.  I found these from just a quick scan  during dinner; you&#39;ll have to read them in more depth to see if they&#39;re quite bad enough to missionize, or just mediocre bad.<br><br>&quot;My Ghost&quot; is a T rated <i>Phantom</i> x <i>Potter</i> crossover:<br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3799174/1/My-Ghost"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3799174/1/My-Ghost">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3799174/1/My-Ghost</a></a><br>This is a bit of a songfic, with Ron having a beautiful singing voice that the Phantom wants to improve.  It becomes Ron/Phantom eventually--seventh year Ron; hopefully that&#39;s not too squicky for you.  (Unfortunately, this is movie!Phantom, which I know isn&#39;t your preference.)  Also, it&#39;s ridiculously long, and the grammar&#39;s decent, so I&#39;m not sure this will prove to be mission material.<br><br>&quot;Ange Gardien&quot; is a T rated <i>Phantom</i> x <i>Narnia</i> crossover which is NOT a trollfic, despite that title:<br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5935069/1/Ange-Gardien"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5935069/1/Ange-Gardien">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5935069/1/Ange-Gardien</a></a><br>This is an Erik/adult!Lucy romance, with some minor songfic moments here and there. The grammar is much worse than the above story, but it&#39;s still pretty long.<br><br>Hope these are of some use, if only as entertainment.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll check out the two you posted in a bit. Thanks!<br><br>For the amusement of the group:<br><br><a href="http://www.quotev.com/story/3560730/The-Phantomess-of-the-Opera-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince/1/">&quot;The Phantomess of the Opera and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;</a> - another HP x PotO crossover, Marauder era.<br><br>&quot;Erika de l&#39;Opera&quot; (that is seriously her surname, <i>what</i>) is the great-great-granddaughter of Erik. Her parents send her to Hogwarts because Voldemort is apparently a big fan of the Leroux novel and tracked her down for Reasons, and somehow she&#39;s supposed to be safer in England.<br><br>She has a deformity, but nobody much cares; it is effectively an excuse for her to accessorize with cute masks (ARGH). For some reason she thinks Ralph Lauren had a presence in Great Britain in the `70s and that Severus Snape would dress like that.<br><br>Snape is her LO. He is a perfect gentleman at all times. They bond over PotO and <i>Faust</i>, which all their friends love, possibly because it&#39;s mentioned in PotO and thus is the only opera they have actually heard of. Naturally, she has the voice of an angel, and Snape tells her this constantly.<br><br>Oh, and Erik talks to her in her head. No one thinks this is strange.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.quotev.com/story/4443070/Never-Let-Go/1/">&quot;Never Let Go&quot;</a> - PotO, set after the events of the book/play/movie.<br><br>This seems to be an alternative to <i>Love Never Dies</i>. (Which doesn&#39;t exist. What was I saying? Never mind.) Unfortunately, this story makes <i>no sense at all</i>.<br><br>So, Janessa Detris (or Morguis, or whatever her last name is this chapter) was abandoned at birth and grew up in the burnt-down Opera House. Somehow she survives on the infrequent charity of strangers, one of whom apparently has the wherewithal to give her a freaking violin and teach her how to play it, but not to actually take her in.<br><br>She grows up and decides to move to Spain. There she runs into Erik, who is now living in the Opera House in Barcelona because a friend of his built a lair for him down there just in case he ever visited (<i>what?</i>). Due to the fact that they have mirroring deformities and sound alike, they deduce that Erik is her father. Yay!<br><br>Then some random person threatens her and makes her become an assassin to save Erik from dying. She is terrible at it and ends up getting shot in the chest in an alley, and Erik saves her by taking the bullet out with a knife and sewing her up on the spot. This does not impede her future actions and in fact is never mentioned again.<br><br>Erik gets her a role in <i>Les Misйrables</i>. No one has any problem with Erik being there, or their deformities. Erik does not appear to be a deranged psycho in any way. One of the other actresses turns out to be Janessa&#39;s mom. How the hell Erik ended up in a relationship with this woman is not discussed ever, nor are they shown interacting after everyone realizes who everyone else is. This is irrelevant because it is not about Janessa, who has no issues with either of them over being abandoned. Everything is happy-shiny.<br><br>But wait! Some new villain named Descole is threatening to kill people if Janessa doesn&#39;t do what he wants! Dun dun dun!<br><br>This is all exactly as haphazard and ill-thought-out as it sounds. The story is currently updating. &gt;.<br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The first one looks like a rehash of the movie so far. Dumb, but a pretty boring sort of dumb.

The mechanics don&#39;t suck, and this girl who grew up on a magical island with dragons actually <i>struggles</i> with being dropped into the middle of Hogsmeade with no clue, no proper clothing, and unable to speak English.

She invents two uncanonical islands, one of which has friendly dragons and an uncanonical humanoid race that apparently speaks Greek, or something like it... the Elves are NOT speaking any Sindarin I ever heard of, despite the author knowing that they do speak Sindarin and that most people speak Westron... and all the uncanon stuff is pretty much superfluous to the plot so far. It could be a mission for someone. I&#39;m just not sure it&#39;s a mission for me.<br><br>Thanks, though! I appreciate anyone Circle-diving for me. <sup>_<sup><br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

            <p>Oh my. The islands could actually be canonical, just about - dragons originated in Angband, and <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Deep14.htm">Tol Fuin</a> - Dorthonion-that-was - still exists, and is definitely to the west.<br><br>Oh, no, never mind. Chapter 2 says Katharos is circular, and too large to be Himling or Tol Morwen (or the Meneltarma) - though the <i>other</i> island, Arthen, with the deformed trees, would be a good fit for Tol Fuin. Certainly the orcs of Angband didn&#39;t come from (current) Middle-earth - they came from Beleriand. So maybe Katharos is the western end of old Dorthonion, and Arthen the eastern?<br><br>The story places the islands 26 hours from Middle-earth by dragon... but I&#39;m dubious about the dragon&#39;s speed. They&#39;re flying below cloud-level - there are &#39;white little specks of clouds here and there&#39;, which sounds like cirrus clouds, at about 5000m. She also claims &#39;if you focused hard enough you could see small shadows swimming in the water&#39;. If we assume that&#39;s the shadow of her dragon, which we can guess at... oh, 10m long?<br><br>A young person with excellent vision can have a visual acuity of 2, which is defined as 1/&#39;gap size&#39; in arc minutes, where &#39;gap size&#39; is the smallest thing you can discern. So the gap size is 0.5 arc minutes, or 1/120 degrees. Said angle can be estimated using the formula tan(V) = S/D. Since V is 1/120 degrees, and S is 10m... if I&#39;m mathsing this right, she might be flying at about 1000m up. That would still let cirrus clouds look like &#39;sky&#39;, so let&#39;s go with that.<br><br>With that in mind, she takes ten hours to pass out of sight of her starting point. Taking my standard sample mountain (Rainier) as the basis for her country, that means she&#39;s gone about 330 kilometers in ten hours; in other words, her dragon moves at 20mph, about 2/3 of the average flight speed of a golden eagle.<br><br>Er... basically, her dragon sucks.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: And yes, I think it&#39;s Greek. The prologue translated &#39;unknown&#39; as &#39;agnosto&#39;, which has obvious etymological connections to &#39;agnostic&#39;. I could have used Google Translate, but that&#39;s boring. ;) And at least some of her Sindarin is from <a href="http://www.realelvish.net/phrasebooks.php">Real Elvish.net</a>. Not quite all of it, but a lot. ~hS</p>

            <p>Smaller shadows would mean she&#39;d have to be lower down, which means the island disappears over the horizon at a shorter distance. Specifically, the tip of Mount Rainier, at 4000m, will always be visible out to 220 km; if she&#39;s 1000m up, she can add 110 km to that. If she&#39;s flying at sea level, which would be pretty much required to see small fish, she&#39;d be moving at 13mph. I <i>guess</i> that&#39;s sustainable flight, since dragons can actually hover in place - but it&#39;s going to be very tiring for the dragon.<br><br>As to re.n... well, <i>it</i> thinks it&#39;s good (&quot;I made this little phrasebook for the sole purpose of people posting it on their websites, replacing Grelvish and Arwen-Undomiel.com.&quot;).

            <p>Ugh, that first one. It&#39;s almost like she heard the word &quot;Animorph&quot; somewhere, found out it means turning into animals, and stopped looking into it. There&#39;s <i>nothing</i> to make her different from your basic fantasy shape-shifter, and she can go from one animal form to another without turning human (or dwarf I guess?) in between. And she doesn&#39;t even use the ability intelligently. In theory her abilities make Bilbo&#39;s presence completely pointless, but she saves Thorin from falling off a mountain once, and that&#39;s it. Most of the &quot;story&quot; is purely a retelling of the movie. What is even the point of you, Evelyn? And what is up with your name?<br><br>The second has almost exactly the same problems, except swap in &quot;Dragonborn&quot; for &quot;Animorph.&quot; Wolf-speaking, line-stealing, fast-healing, know-it-all, tag-along nonsense. *headdesk headdesk headdesk*<br><br>I might take either one of those. Or both. It would be a job of work on my part to make them entertaining because they spend so much time doing absolutely nothing to explore how a new person with new abilities affects the dynamics of the group and the outcome of the various encounters, but the logical problems alone could be enough. We&#39;ll see!<br><br>... I&#39;m not even touching the third one. Nope. Do Not Want.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not in good form to mock the author of a fic. We mock the fic itself, or its premise. In this case, the idea of having caring Dementors contravenes exactly why Rowling created them and the purpose they serve in her stories. That the fic might have been written by a twelve year old is immaterial. Anyone inexperienced enough with fanfiction writing can completely misconstrue the canon.</p>

            <p>Board RPs (and things like the Continuity Council) are as canon as you want them to be for your own spinoff. For example, I consider the Continuity Council canon, but this is not the case with most of the RPs I participated in.</p>

            <p>Long time lurker/reader of the wiki. I&#39;ve read almost all of the pages of said badfics,  as well as the rules, so I think I understand the idea of this place. I&#39;d like to try and help with most anything that has to do with the Pit and similar places. I used to go there often both looking and writing, and I still mind to do the latter, but both my RL time and The Pit&#39;s quality has deteriorated. I have joined some Pit Communities dedicated to seeking out badfanfic and fixing/criting it for the authors and deleting rulebreaking ones, but I mainly lurk than actually participate. My brain is so full of ideas that I switch from one thing to the other quickly, whether it be RL or net stuff, and I often forget things. <br><br>Also, I consider this more of a hobby than a real job, so obviously if RL stuff is coming up I give that higher priority. I&#39;m going to assume it will be the same for this place as well, so please don&#39;t expect me around here doing too much work or PPC&#39;ing in general. I have tried to write some snarks, though they are highly NSFE due to content and I&#39;d rather not post them here where children can get at them. Same with some of my more recent &#39;better&#39; work. Ack...I&#39;m writing too much, I fear...<br><br>I mostly stay in anime fandoms (hence the clever name). Was a huge Narutard a while back, now just waiting for it to be over. I also do Soul Eater, SMT/Persona/Devil Survivor, Final Fantasy(1, 2,4, and 6 so far my faves.) Fate/Zero/SN, Death Note, DMC, MGS (recently, just got Legacy),Tales of etc., BlazeBlue usually anime/games that don&#39;t fit the regular shounen/shoujo cliche...though I have a few guilty pleasures like Fushigi Yuugi, Blue Seed and some Monster(stopped watching the anime like four eps in). I just don&#39;t have much chunks of time, and I&#39;d rather write my &#39;what-if&#39; fanfiction or twist up the plots/make up my own that sound plausible In-universe, than deal with more of the same only with different layers(?). I don&#39;t really like yaoi or yuri, though I can appreciate good characters that have relationships. I suppose I&#39;d rather try and turn Sues into Not-Sues by talking it out with the author...and I am currently trying to parody/self-aware version of this with a SI/Canon Naruto fic that is in the works. Trying it with SMT and it&#39;s not going so well...I can&#39;t seem to translate my thoughts to paper as it feels so dry and lame.<br><br>As for non-anime fandoms, I still adore Harry Potter, dislike Eragon/Inheritance Series, like LOTR (though the new cashcow movie BS made me angry--three parts eh?), Zelda, Megaman (from Classic to ZX to Legends), Dragon&#39;s Age, just got into The Witcher on PC, Legacy of Kain, Cthulhu related stuff, and DnD like stuff. I&#39;ve tried to join RL RP groups, but college is a huge PoA and time killer--more so with papers and finals coming. I just feel I never have enough time to properly put effort into creative things like fanfiction and art anymore. And when I do, it&#39;s either subpar, not what I wanted it to be, or just...I can&#39;t finish it or look at it. Like one of my old Naruto fanfictions: Started it in 2010, has 41 chapters, yet I haven&#39;t updated it since two years ago. It&#39;s barely Naruto anymore though; really Naruto in name, as I added more mythology and spiritual references. Now looking at it, I just hate it.<br><br>So that;s it really. I guess I&#39;m just kinda lost right now, lol. Been busy trying to figure out how to draw using a computer and Paint.NET, not going great, and code in GameMaker/RPG Maker 2003/XP. I just have lots of ideas, I guess...Also, you can find me on the Pit, AFFO (guess, it&#39;s NSFW sorry), and also DeviantArt by the same name. I&#39;ve tried to provide as much info as I can but if you need anything else, please feel free. I alos might not reply for a while, since I forget about this place, and many others on the net, since things are getting hectic. Sorry in advance.</p>

            <p>Well, as far as I (another longtime lurker) understand), you hang around here a lot, chat, get known, and then you ask for permission, and if it&#39;s granted, you make a pair of agents and then go around PPC-ing.<br><br>Oh, and if you do D&amp;D stuff, could you help me organize a homebrew parody class that I was thinking of?

            <p>Honestly, I&#39;m still a newb to the DnD fandom, excluding the works of R.A Salvatore--and I stopped reading him after the whole Draco-Litch BS plot. I might be able to help, I hope, but most of my knowledge would come from normal WRPGs like Skyrim...which isn&#39;t that similar. I do understand the mechanics and classes a bit though.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s OK if you don&#39;t have a lot of time. We all have lives, you know. Kudos for working to improve the Pit (however indirectly), by the way.<br><br>Do you see the four little links on the top of the homepage? Read those, especially the FAQs and Original Series. In the meantime, your newbie gifts are a dark blue cape and a replica of Cress&#39; sword.

            <p>I see...interesting. Still have to finish ToP, one of the few I haven&#39;t along with Abyss and any of them on PS1 or in JPN. <br><br>Thanks everybody. You seem like decent people, unlike some of the other forums I&#39;ve come across. Critics United and Literate Union on The Pit are a few good examples of the places I try to lurk. Along with WGW(NSFW, most of it is horrible smut snarks, fyi. Though it&#39;s not all that.) Hope I can help out here as well. I&#39;ll try checking some relevant fandoms and see what needs work; also might offer up some of my own pieces for crit as well. Some are NFSW,so I&#39;d rather not directly link them to people without their consent.</p>

            <p>The PPC often does missions to NSFW fics, and some of the missions end up NSFW too, so it&#39;s not an absolute ban.<br><br>However--we do have teenagers here, and some people log in from work, and some people simply don&#39;t like to read smut, meaning that the PPC board itself has to be work-safe. The rule of thumb is to warn for anything that&#39;s posted on the wiki or the board if it could be X-rated or offensive or not-safe-for-brain in some way, and don&#39;t discuss such topics in the middle of chat where anybody could wander in and get squicked.<br><br>The Departments of Bad Slash and Bad Het often handle NSFW fics, and DAVD handles torture and unnecessary or badly-written violence. After all, there&#39;s such a thing as a well-written story with those subjects in it, and we&#39;d very much like to see more of those.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;ve had this idea, and I was thinking of basing an agent off of it. <br><br>The idea is this: A homebrew D&amp;D class, called the Monks of Rinjswand, who follow the principles of speed and cowardice that Rincewind of the Discworld bases his whole life on.<br><br>In-universe, they&#39;re disciples of Rinjswand, God of Cowardice and Survival, the Coward of a Thousand Retreating Backs.<br><br>The Monks are a new brainchild, and I haven&#39;t been able to really organize the class. If someone could help me out, it would be much appreciated.<br><br>Current ideas for class features (note that some are for higher levels):<br><br>Class Skills: Bluff, Concentration, Escape Artist, Hide, Listen, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (the planes) Sense Motive, Spot, Survival  <br><br>No proficiency with any weapons or armor; in fact, this class cannot wear anything heavier than light armor, as to do so would impede the process of running away.<br><br>They either cannot enter combat unless it is absolutely necessary, or have to succeed a Will save to enter combat. <br><br>See Death- Due to training to always expect to see him, Monks of Rinjswand can see any personification of Death. At higher levels, they can see anything that is invisible by way of a SEP field or other method of unnoticeability.<br><br>Improved Running- Any Monk of Rinjswand may temporarily double their base land speed for some [undetermined] amount of time, after which they become tired. A [some high level] MoR does not have this drawback.<br><br>Universal Cowardice- A Monk of Rinjswand may speak 2 languages more than what is provided by the rules. They may speak in any reasonable language for the purposes of crying for mercy or help, or to surrender.<br><br>Knowledge of Cruel and Unusual Geography- A MoR gains a +[rather high] save against any difficulty provided by terrain of any kind.<br><br>Favored of the Lady- Because they attempt to follow the path of Rincewind of all people, the Lady tends to take note. MoRs tend to get into dangerous and heroic situations which they will usually survive and somehow solve, but usually with singed hair and eyebrows at the least.<br><br>Only Vaguely an Hourglass- Because of the constant attention of the Lady, not even Death him/itself knows their future. In other words, they&#39;re immune to fate.<br><br>Advanced Cowardice- MoRs develop a special intuition about when danger is immanent, and with a high enough roll, they can sense the danger and start running before it even strikes. MoRs also gain a +[a lot] bonus on Sense Motive checks.<br><br>Speed is a Sacrament:  MoRs gain access to the cleric domains Speed and Luck, and the following spells (not all at once. Some are higher level than others): Detect Magic, Detect Poison, Endure Elements, Obscuring Mist, Death Ward, True Seeing.<br><br>Science of Cowardice: MoRs gain half the XP they would get from an encounter when they run away from the encounter.<br><br>Art of Running- A high-level MoR doesn&#39;t get tired after running.<br><br>I know, it&#39;s kind of a mess right now, but with everyone&#39;s help, I&#39;m hoping to straighten it out into a respectable parody of D&amp;D.<br><br>Um... if that kind of thing is allowed here...</p>

            <p>Well, I knew there would be someone out there who would enjoy that. I don&#39;t know how many people would agree with you, though. I&#39;d imagine that for most, constantly reliving the day before their next birthday would be fun at first, due to unlimited time to do certain information-based tasks and lack of consequences for physical tasks, but would eventually drive them insane from the boredom and futility that the time loop would produce. That&#39;s doubled if they don&#39;t have access to the resources that Bill Murray had in Groundhog Day that let him gain several new skills while in temporal limbo, and just had to see all of their efforts vanish at the end of each day. That would be all kinds of unpleasant.</p>

            <p>Ah, here we are. After Harold Ramis(Groundhog Day&#39;s director) said that he thought that the initial eight-to-ten-year estimate was too short, and that Phil spent about three or four decades in the loop, a site calculated the loop&#39;s length based on references in the movie, how long it would take for Phil to know the intricate workings of the town in the demonstrated amount of detail, the time he would spend learning skills like mastery of ice sculpting, etcetera, and wound up at just under <i>34 years.</i><br><br>Yeah, I think it&#39;s going to be a bit difficult for Mr. Connors to adjust. After the loop ends, not only is he thrust into a world where he doesn&#39;t have omniscient knowledge of his surroundings and you don&#39;t reset to the start of the day when you die, but he&#39;s been in the loop for so long, his mental age is now twice as old as his physical age.

            <p>Would you mind being in black-and-white for the duration of your adventure? Because for a temporary jaunt, I think the Second Doctor could provide the best balance between fun and spontaneous experiences, and not being possessed or mutated or something of the sort because the writers know you&#39;re only temporary. I&#39;d say Nine or Ten would be just as fun, but that&#39;s only if you don&#39;t mind the chance of stumbling into the middle of aberrant cosmic phenomena or being turned into a cyborg. Some people would really enjoy that, though. It&#39;s not every day someone gets to play around with with uncontrollable power, even if there are equally potent consequences.</p>

            <p>In the admittedly few episodes I&#39;ve seen of him, while he does seem like a lot of fun, Four or one his companions kept getting turned into hosts for things, or cloned, or mind-controlled, which is why he wasn&#39;t the original pick. The ratio would&#39;ve probably gotten better if I watched more of his run, though, and the Fourth Doctor would be a lot of fun to interact with.<br>Have fighting off Meglos! I hope it&#39;s someone else that gets possessed and made to develop green skin and spines! Meglos needs more time in the spotlight. He was great. Maybe the Twelfth Doctor will encounter him.</p>

            <p>I have one lined up who knows the novels, and therefore the character I&#39;ve got (more than two hundred years older) as the Old Man. However, she never finished Riven, so I would like a second beta who can help make sure I&#39;ve got other stuff correct.<br><br>The gist, for those who weren&#39;t here when I asked for a beta last or don&#39;t remember, is that by 2033 the whole Earth is in tension between opposite (and militant) sociopolitical extremes, and the story is mostly from the perspective of a refugee fleeing to Releeshahn.</p>

            <p>My Permission request!<br>After being at the PPC for about a year, I feel it&#39;s a good time to ask for permission.<br>So, I wrote my Agents, and here are the descriptions!<br><br><br><b>Kitty Eden</b><br>A seventeen year old girl with anger management issues. She’s a bit smaller than average height, and has shoulder length brown hair, which she keeps tied back in a ponytail. She’s most knowledgeable about the Harry Potter fandom, but keeps a bit of trivia about Doctor Who, Artemis Fowl and Percy Jackson stored inside her head.<br>Her main lust-object is (strangely) Colin Creevey, putting her apart from the rest of the Agents at the PPC. Her anger management issues come up when she, her mother, her cat, her brother, someone who she passed in the hallway earlier that morning, is insulted.<br>Oh yeah. She’s slightly insane.<br><br>Kitty works in the Department of Mary Sues, Harry Potter division.<br><br><b>Kay Eden</b><br>Kay is Kitty’s brother, and has sandy blonde hair. He’s 14, and is a head below Kitty, and she teases him mercilessly for it. <br>He’s slightly calmer than Kitty, but gets very hyperactive when on Gummy Worms. Thankfully, the candy is always hidden when he comes by. He likes big guns, but can’t use them, since he works in the HARRY POTTER Division. This makes him a little homicidal when the topic comes up. <br>He likes Luna Lovegood, but she’s not his lust-object, mainly because he ‘doesn’t consider it good for him to fixate on dreams’. <br>He is often in vivid debates with Kitty about various mechanics of the HP world, and they both consider the study of magic in different universe fascinating.<br><br>Kay works with Kitty in the Department of Mary Sues, Harry Potter division.<br><br><p><br>I wrote a story called &#39;In the Twisting of Fate&#39;, which is slightly dark, but has some humourous moments. The link is... <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n7gdSpbnKplWgxkQypeHcuFmw45_Dh_65X-LphleVro/edit?usp=sharing/"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n7gdSpbnKplWgxkQypeHcuFmw45_Dh_65X-LphleVro/edit?usp=sharing/">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n7gdSpbnKplWgxkQypeHcuFmw45_Dh_65X-LphleVro/edit?usp=sharing/</a></a><br>Thank you to my wonderful aunt for editing.<br><br>And my sporking story...!<br>It&#39;s called &#39;rise of darkness&#39;.

The link is right here. <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7175647/1/rise_of_darkness/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7175647/1/rise_of_darkness/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7175647/1/rise_of_darkness/</a></a><br><br>I tried to find at least a T-rated one, but, honestly, it was really hard. We need to start finding more lower-rated badfic.<br>Extremely nervous here.<br>Thanks a lot! And, as a partial bribe, here&#39;s the complete Divergent Series for and Permission Givers dropping by.<br>*laughs nervously*<br>No, it&#39;s not an actual bribe. Really.<br><br>Lotsa love,<br>~Kitty</p></p>

            <p>I have been wanting to introduce my agents, but didn&#39;t want to post a new thread. So with out farther ado<br><br>Seyche-a former Hetalia bit character,(From a fictional badfic) who managed to be pardoned from execution. She was instead brought to the PPC academy to be rehabilitated. She managed to get treated, and is now working for The Department of Research of Mary Sues. She has short hair-which she dyes blond-and hazel eyes, which are usually covered with sunglasses. She cannot remember her time as a bit character, but feels remorse for it anyway. She has a short temper and is quick with her fists, but is not very strong in a physical sense, so she can&#39;t really hurt anybody. She has a paralyzing fear of ducks<br><br>Murder-a survivor of a zombie apocalypses (which one is unknown) and is more then a little stir crazy. He got   kicked out of The Department of Mary Sues for an unknown incident involving Rainbow Dash and a frying pan. He cannot speak, but communicates in odd gestures that only Seyche can understand. He is trigger happy and will attack anything that doesn&#39;t look human with whatever he has on hand. He has pink hair, tanned skin, and bright blue eyes. He always wears a pair of broken glasses.<br><br>If any part of these characters sounds to Sueish let me know. I have gotten a lot of school work done, so I should start working on a sample as soon as I figure out where to send it<br></p>

            <p>Usually bit characters are spared, unless they are uncanonical (like, they couldn&#39;t fit into the Canon as background extras) and directly involved in aiding and abetting the Sue. Those with a bit of a personality are recruited; others are let back into the Canon with their memories wiped. <br><br>Also, it&#39;s the Department of Mary Sue Experiments and Research.

            <p>Training at the PPC usually runs the gamut of &#39;tossing the agent at a warrior!Sue to see who survives&#39;, &#39;tagging along with more experienced agents&#39; (that&#39;s the internship programme in its more practical appearances), &#39;a quick seminar on weapons and then we&#39;re off to slay the Sue&#39;, and &#39;impromptu military bootcamp in the middle of the hallway&#39;. It really depends on the Agent being subjected to the training, as the PPC is played for laughs and it&#39;s funnier to toss complete incompetents into situations that get them way in over their heads. <br><br>So no, there&#39;s never really any standardised form of training; it&#39;s just what seems funniest.</p>

            <p>The question lies more in xir ability to handle a combat situation.<br><br>Is Seyche:<br>-Unable to withstand the pull of a longbow?<br>-Horrible at hand-eye coordination?<br>-Not strong enough to wield a broadsword?<br>-Lumbering and thus unable to wield a rapier (think swashbuckling)<br>-Scared of loud noises like gunfire?<br>-Just plain damn scared of weapons?<br>-Non-confrontational?<br>-Squeamish about blood and guts and Glitter?<br><br>Of course, xie doesn&#39;t have to be all of those things, but maybe some of those things will give you a good indicator of what to do with xir. <br><br>For example, my agents, Christianne and Eledhwen, are decent with projectile weapons. Their weapons of choice in most fandoms, though, are swords and knives. Christianne has a sword (though she first learnt with the katana, and may sometimes get her grip a bit funny because the katana is designed and balanced differently), whereas Eledhwen has double knives. The two of them might not have the muscle tone to handle archery, or the patience to get the aim right (archery&#39;s a precise sorta thing where even the slightest variation in the wind can change the trajectory of the arrow). So the funniest thing in a training scenario would be for them to try and shoot arrows, and end up with a montage similar to the archery training montage in <i>The Princess Diaries 2</i>. That&#39;s to say, there&#39;ll probably be some Agents with bits of hair missing from their heads, a couple crying kids who had their balloons popped, and many, many other Agents with their hands raised in the air as if begging my Agents not to shoot them.<br><br>And of course, the terrified blindfolded Sue with the wilver apple on her head.<br></p>

            <p>It would make sense that your agent would need to learn new skills if she was going into the DMSEAR, instead of going into an Action Department. Any field agent should learn to at least use some sort of weapon or other offensive tool, but a DMSEAR Agent would need to study up on known Suvian properties and develop methods to scientifically utilize whatever comes their way. Field agents can be reckless without negative consequences, since they&#39;re <i>supposed</i> to be killing and destroying in their missions, but specific samples of certain Sue types can be rare, and the PPC&#39;s scientists would need to use what they have as efficiently as possible.<br><br>I think the reason why there&#39;s disparity in agent training, in-universe, is that some agents are recruited already possessing abilities that would let them perform well in missions, like magic or weapon proficiency or unusual powers, while other new recruits would need to have further instruction by the Agent Trainers in the Department of Personnel so that the newbies could to develop their skills, or to tag along as interns with experienced agents to find the ropes, or some third option for their specific case. (We know Agent Trainers exist, since Agent Training has been mentioned on occasion, they were the focus of one short-lived spin-off, and a few agents, such as Ilraen, have been said to become Agent Trainers in the future, but they haven&#39;t gotten a lot of attention, probably because they wouldn&#39;t provide more than a handful of story opportunities).<br><br>If you want to write DMSEAR stories, I personally would love to read them. We don&#39;t see a lot about the Infrastructure Departments, and that&#39;s a shame, because there are a lot of stories that could be told from their side. I don&#39;t know what purpose Murder would fulfill there, though, since his violent nature wouldn&#39;t exactly be conducive to scientific endeavors. Well, unless he worked in security, because then he could beat down Sues that escape from stasis or creatures that try to get into the lab, and guard the experiments to keep them from doing anything untoward. The DMSEAR might just contract a few DIA Officers to do that, but it&#39;s always good to have someone in-house alongside the external help to know what&#39;s going on and prioritize accordingly. Murder can&#39;t talk, so it would be a little difficult, but it wouldn&#39;t be PPC if it was easy.<br><br>One thing, though: is Murder his last name, or his first name? We already have a lot of agents with &quot;action&quot; names, like Suicide, Death, Heal, and Echo, so even if he doesn&#39;t have two names now, it would make him more distinct if he had two by the end. I think it would look better as a last name, but that&#39;s personal opinion, since I think &quot;Murder Jones&quot; or &quot;Murder Simmons&quot; or something like that would be just too silly.  </p>

            <p>...I never quite understood why there is such an insistence on agents using bows. I always imagined rookie agents toting stirrup crossbows into medieval/fantasy &#39;verses. Sure they&#39;re technically not canonical in, say, the <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, but they fire pretty much the same thing, right?<br><br>Plus, crossbows have the advantage of being easy to maintain, easier to fire than a bow, and can actually pose a significant threat to armoured opponents.

            <p>If you remember waaaay back in <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission01.html">Rambling Band</a>, J&amp;A made specific efforts to be <i>absolutely</i> canonical. Acacia&#39;s bow in that mission is an orc bow, because she&#39;s in an Uruk disguise. Indeed, as <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission02.html">Chosen</a> makes clear, it&#39;s not enough to be canonical - they had to be something that could canonically attack the Mary-Sue (&quot;Not much choice, is there?&quot; said Acacia. &quot;These Mary Sues are very rarely attacked by the evil Men, have you noticed that?&quot;). That&#39;s made even clearer in <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission03.html">Lady of the Fellowship</a>, where they&#39;re invisible (and so could hardly &#39;contaminate&#39; anything by their appearance), but still make the effort to blend in as Nazgul.<br><br>In fact, the first (only?) time they go in as elves is <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission08.html">Why am I Here?</a>, where the Sue has an Orc as a boyfriend. And... yep, there it is: &#39;[Acacia] had spent the five minutes pilfering a rather more elvish bow, and filling her quiver with more appropriate arrows.&#39;<br><br><i>Why</i> agents are (or were) supposed to stay so rigorously canonical is a question I don&#39;t think has ever been answered - we all slipped gently away from it fairly early on. If I had to make up a reason, I&#39;d say that in those days, canon wasn&#39;t as damaged - there was far less badfic in total - so a pair of uncanonical agents could have a significant effect. Nowadays, everything&#39;s so messed up that we could send folk into Lorien disguised as mecha-tigers and nothing would result.<br><br>What this all comes back to, I guess, is that crossbows are one of the great overlooked weapons of fantasy in general. There aren&#39;t a whole lot of stories at the right tech level - you&#39;re either still at longbows, or you&#39;ve gotten as far as gunpowder. Discworld has crossbows, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1RidoL761j2oVr6RY3aIqOC-6kg7pFnBsVJuv3Sn5Omo">Dafydd bought Selene one</a>. But I can&#39;t think of anywhere else off the top of my head.<br><br>(Also: crossbows are &#39;easy to maintain&#39;? That honestly surprises me. A bow has no moving parts - unstring it, keep it dry, and I didn&#39;t know it needed much other care. Crossbows are mechanical - that means machine oil, which will need both adding and removing when it gets icky. So why are they easier to maintain? I&#39;m not arguing, just surprised)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Sorry-- that idea was really poorly phrased. I was trying to say that a crossbow&#39;s individual parts can be replaced when they break. That way a repairman can simply pop off the damaged part and stick a new one in its place as opposed to a bow, where either the string breaks or the body breaks and you have to trash the part. <br><br>You&#39;re entirely right about the mechanical complexity of a crossbow: with ease of use comes increased dependancy on specialized repair crews.<br><br><br>Your point on canon has been duly noted!

            <p>I mean, we should stay, you know, a creature in canon, but I see no need to become a creature that would kill a Sue. The disguises are supposed to help agents blend in, right? So as long as they look like part of the world, we&#39;re cool.<br><br>For me, I&#39;d say it would be harder for canon to hide an orc in Rivendell then an elf killing somebody. There is only so much an SEP field can do, people! The sworn enemy of your people showing up in the Last Homely House is not somebody else&#39;s problem, no matter how much <s>the field</s> their mind insists it is!

            <p>... because you&#39;re extrapolating the modern idea of the SEP field back to before it existed. There was no electronic explanation for Jay and Acacia being hidden - they were shielded by <i>the canon itself</i> from being noticed, unless they made a very loud noise or deliberately drew attention to themselves. And the canon (being the canon) can hide an orc just as easily as an elf.<br><br>That said, J&amp;A did their level best <i>not</i> to be noticed. Whenever they were in Rivendell in orc disguise, they snuck around, slept out in the woods, etc etc. Nowadays, encounters with canons and OCs are far more common - observe <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFF8he9DI24dk5CA_YUVGdAWQJFBvIRzMQzJ8aErGek/pub">Huinesoron&#39;s run-in with &#39;Luthien&#39; and her mini-friend</a>, where an orc disguise would have <i>really</i> caused problems.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have been wanting to introduce my agents, but didn&#39;t want to post a new thread. So with out farther ado<br><br>Seyche-a former Hetalia bit character,(From a fictional badfic) who managed to be pardoned from execution. She was instead brought to the PPC academy to be rehabilitated. She managed to get treated, and is now working for The Department of Research of Mary Sues. She has short hair-which she dyes blond-and hazel eyes, which are usually covered with sunglasses. She cannot remember her time as a bit character, but feels remorse for it anyway. She has a short temper and is quick with her fists, but is not very strong in a physical sense, so she can&#39;t really hurt anybody. She has a paralyzing fear of ducks<br><br>Murder-a survivor of a zombie apocalypses (which one is unknown) and is more then a little stir crazy. He got   kicked out of The Department of Mary Sues for an unknown incident involving Rainbow Dash and a frying pan. He cannot speak, but communicates in odd gestures that only Seyche can understand. He is trigger happy and will attack anything that doesn&#39;t look human with whatever he has on hand. He has pink hair, tanned skin, and bright blue eyes. He always wears a pair of broken glasses.<br><br>If any part of these characters sounds to Sueish let me know. I have gotten a lot of school work done, so I should start working on a sample as soon as I figure out where to send it<br>    </p>

            <p>As Sjosten pointed out, we are in the process of implementing a new Permission system. I&#39;d like it if you would create a couple new writing samples using the prompts as described <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IE81HONRJnp0IaK92GvzyL00CZYNZG_pvdo93gRMIhY/pub">here</a> (scroll down past all the orange stuff). The more we see the new system in action, the better. Plus, your character descriptions are on the sketchy side, so it would really help to see the agents in action.<br><br>I did read the story you posted, though, so I wanted to give my thoughts on that. The first thing I noticed, of course, is your paragraphing. You MUST use either first-line indents or double-spacing to aid your readers in seeing where one paragraph ends and the next begins. Otherwise, each section looks like one huge block of jagged text, and it&#39;s possible for two paragraphs to look like one if the ending line gets close enough to the edge of the screen. Hitting &quot;Enter&quot; twice instead of once for a new paragraph is very easy, so I recommend that.<br><br>There were a couple other mechanical things (&quot;the&quot; shouldn&#39;t be capitalized in your title, for one), but they were minor and few, and didn&#39;t distract me from reading, so that&#39;s good.<br><br>As for the content, if I&#39;m being honest, I was disappointed. Your setup got me interested in how the three kids were going to get together, and what the mysterious villain organization was all about, and what the heroes were going to do about it, but the endgame came about too quickly and resolved far too easily, with lots of convenient circumstances and dubious escapes for the heroes. Notably, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really that easy to jump through a glass window or dislocate your own wrist. Actually, I&#39;m not sure how dislocating your wrist would even help escape from bonds like that. Thumbs, maybe, but wrist? How does that work? And how can he do anything useful with his hands, let alone fire a gun even remotely well, shortly after painfully destabilizing his joints like that? That&#39;s not something you can recover from instantly.<br><br>The biggest problem, though, is that the villains are terrible at being villains. The Mistress is so cartoonishly out of her mind that I can&#39;t believe anyone would follow her; her motivation is unclear (&quot;revenge,&quot; but for what, and how does torturing kids satisfy her desire for it?); the Generic Goons kidnapping the heroes do so in the most loud and obvious way I can think of; they put the heroes in a truck full of convenient weapons and don&#39;t even bother to take James&#39; penknife off him first; the security is so terrible that they can walk through the compound&#39;s prison without being spotted by one of the guards on duty or any cameras; a fourteen-year-old kid raised on a farm by his grandparents can hack their computer systems; and they&#39;re called Brimstone and <i>Treacle</i>, the latter being a sweet, thick syrup residents of North America know as molasses. And yet these nimrods somehow managed to kidnap <i>hundreds</i> of kids without being caught by the police? It&#39;s all very, very silly.<br><br>I did like the kids themselves, though. You got across a pretty good idea of who they are as people, and like I said, in the beginning I was curious to find out what would happen to them. I could wish they were a little more original than the &quot;straight-A student,&quot; the &quot;slacker who plays video games,&quot; and the &quot;unlikely computer genius,&quot; but their backgrounds and interactions with their family members helped with that, and I think given more time in the story and some properly serious obstacles to overcome, they could grow very nicely.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Personally, I think the Agents look cool, possibly just a tad more violent than the PGs will look for, but otherwise good. As for the writing sample, I thought they had changed how those work now. Of course, I could be mistaken, but I believe in the thread <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=254639;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=75"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=254639;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=75">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=254639;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=75</a></a> (my apologies, I have no idea how to link correctly), they revamped everything.</p>

            <p>Um, Hi. I&#39;m a bit new to the PPC, although I&#39;ve hung around on the Wiki for a while. I read a lot, and I have a lot of fantoms, predominantly Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Dresden Files, Discworld, and My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic, but I&#39;ll read or watch anything kinda good. I have a lot of trouble saying what my absolute favorite would be.<br><br>I have three fanfics, one a parody of My Immortal by being its complete opposite (involving the Purity Sue werewolf Ivory Lightness Inno&#39;cence Dove Way), which Mom has nearly shamed me into disowning, a fanfic based on the video game series Epic Battle Fantasy, and a crossover between the movie Pacific Rim and MLP FiM.<br><br>I also like role-play.<br><br>Um, so, yeah, hi, and I hope to be accepted.</p>

            <p>The PPC version! Here you can tell us all about characters you like, vent anger about how their treated in canon, and talk about how they influenced you<br>Here are me choices:<br><br>Lucy(Fairy Tail)<br>I see a lot of myself in Lucy. We&#39;re both bookish blondes with a tendency to freak out. I was going through a dark period in my life, and this anime helped me get through it. I believe part of that was the fact that I could easily relate to Lucy. She also had the awesome ability to summon spirits from another dimension. She might not have always fought herself, But I wasn&#39;t always a violent person (Back then)<br><br>Lenalee (D.Grayman)<br>Lenalee is a character that&#39;s really abused in fandom. Possibly because she&#39;s one of the only girls in the main cast. It&#39;s a shame really because she&#39;s such a good character. When she was introduced she was a sweet motherly was always  protecting people. We later learn she was taken away from her brother-the only suriving member of her family- and had been horribly abused by the organization that she worked for, but stuck with said organization because she wanted to protect the people she loved. Lenalee was also a badass fighter, able to take down a level 3 akuma on her own, which was the strongest akuma the group had faced at that point. (Although she did lose her powers afterword)<br><br>Maka (Soul Eater)<br>Maka was a very nice surprise for me. Put yourselves in my shoes for a minute, I&#39;ll walk you through it.You are a young teen girl, who likes supernatural action shows, but hates how the girls never get as much action as the boys do. You hear about this awesome anime, and deiced to check it out. That anime opens with a demon killing a woman before going after another victim. Then he is interrupted by the arrival of two teenagers, who claim that his soul belongs to them. THEN THE BOY TURNS INTO A WEAPON, WHICH THE GIRL USES TO KICK THE MONSTERS ASS. Yes, that had to be in all capitals, it was that awesome. And Maka continued to be a badass, as well as a character I could relate to.<br><br>I just realized this is the longest post I&#39;ve made on the board.</p>

            <p>Well, my list is ever changing, but my current favourite character is by far the Doctor (not that one!) from <i>Star Trek: Voyager</i>. He&#39;s just so sarcastic. And he&#39;s got those quips.<br>&quot;I&#39;m a doctor, not an interior designer!&quot;</p>

            <p>Hermione appealed to me enough to be my username. We&#39;re both bookish straight A students (or rather, I would be if I didn&#39;t have massive senioritis right now) who value grades but will put them aside for their values. We both fear failure. We even kind of look alike.<br><br>Data (Star Trek TNG) is just one of my favorite fictional characters of all time. He&#39;s a lovely paradox - a cold, emotionless android who is incredibly kind and caring. He&#39;s superior to humans in many ways, knows he is, and yet wants to be human. He doesn&#39;t understand humanity but he ends up understanding all the important things about it. His journey is by turns hilarious (Sherlock Holmes cosplaying), heartbreaking (his daughter Lal), adorable (he has a striped cat named Spot), heartwarming (his views on his friendship with Geordi), and powerful (his fight to be recognized as a person). I love him so much. <br><br>Garak (Star Trek DS9) is completely amazing and it pains me that he isn&#39;t a regular. I know he really couldn&#39;t be, but still, I thoroughly enjoy every moment he&#39;s on screen. First of all, he&#39;s hilarious. His sort of lying charm is fun to watch, and his inability to be straightforward means he&#39;s unpredictable. You don&#39;t know who&#39;s side he&#39;s on, but his actor is a master of subtext and you get subtle hints about his true feelings and his back story. I adore his relationship with Bashir because the chemistry of naпve Starfleet human and morally ambiguous alien is so good. <br><br>Loki (Avengers), what do I say about him? He&#39;s been interpreted so many different ways and I don&#39;t think either &quot;misunderstood baby&quot; or &quot;violent psychopath&quot; are entirely correct. My interpretation is the same as Tom Hiddleston&#39;s. I don&#39;t want to try to say it as well as Tom, so if you want to know just look it up.<br><br>Dorothy (Wizard of Oz) had a very important impact on me as a little kid. Heck, I still admire her. I understand feeling like your life is dull and dreaming of going to fantastical places. I still do that. I want to go on my own quests and take control of my own destiny. Plus, I could go on for hours about the way those books are more feminist than books being written now. Short version: Oz is a matriarchy.<br><br>Okay, I&#39;ve already broken the three character limit, so I&#39;ll stop now.</p>

            <p>Homura Akemi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica)<br><br>There&#39;s two types of characters I like most: badasses and adorable girls. Homura has been both.<br>And about abuse, oooh boy. Homura got it <i>hard.</i> Pretty much the only things she lacks in that department are abusive parents (it&#39;s implied she&#39;s an orphan, which is another can of trouble) and sexual abuse, but she&#39;s got basically everything else on the bad happenings list.<br>Add the fact that she used to be a shy, cute girl with health issues, and you know why pretty much every Boarder who has seen the series wants to give her an hug.<br>But another reason why I like her is because she doesn&#39;t mope about it.<br>She geared up and fought back, becoming probably one of the badassest characters out there. Her series is an harsh one for Magical Girls, and is out to break her twenty-four hours a day. And it broke her. But she taped her pieces together and kept going.<br>(Not going to open the can of evil that the Rebellion movie is. Let&#39;s just say that I would pull Homura (and probably Madoak and the other characters too) out of it if I had the chance.)<br><br>Sakura Kinomoto (Card Captor Sakura)<br>Well, should I call her &quot;my old love&quot;? There&#39;s something about this character that I always liked (and proof is the fact that I used a badfic clone of her as a basis for Nikki). Her hardships aren&#39;t comparable to Homura&#39;s, but Sakura&#39;s &quot;Everything will be alright!&quot; attitude is the charm. She&#39;s one of those characters that, even when scared or facing an apparently impossible deed, <i>will not lose hope</i>. She also has a clumsy, &quot;funny&quot; side that rounds her well.<br><br>Conan Edogawa/Shinichi Kudo (Detective Conan)<br>The not-so-kid detective. Aside from his almost inhuman investigation abilities, the reason why I like his character is that he always keeps a clear mind when facing problems, and manages to keep high moral values even when facing murderers almost daily. He won&#39;t let a murderer commit suicide or die from a danger if he can do it, and in fact even feels guilty for the only time he didn&#39;t manage too.<br>Of course, he has his funny sides too.<br><br>There&#39;s many other characters I like, but, you know, rule fo three...</p>

            <p>First and foremost: Princess Twilight Sparkle. She reminds me of me--smart, freaks out about tests, isolated from society until recently, and learning about friendship. Besides that, magic happens to fascinate me. Watching Friendship is Magic always makes me feel better, and with a central character so strong and talented (and cute)...yeah. (Of course I love the other mane five, but Twilight is best pony.)<br><br>Second, most of the core cast of Fullmetal Alchemist. (Ed, Al, Roy, Hughes, Hawkeye, and Envy because shapeshifting.) The show was one of the first anime I really got into; I think I can still quote most of the first eight English episodes from memory, in the characters&#39; voices. (I don&#39;t try with the chimera episode, though; too sad D:) The casting is perfect, the characters themselves have the <i>best</i> banter with each other, and to top it off, they&#39;re all total badasses.<br><br>Third, Tsunemori Akane, from Psycho-Pass. She seems like your standard cutesy protagonist at odds with the cyberpunk setting, but she gradually toughens up and, later in the run, KNOCKS OUT THE MAIN BAD GUY (a bigger maniac than the Joker and Moriarty together) WITH A HELMET HE DESIGNED!  Akane is also able to keep her Hue clear (long story, go watch the show) no matter how creepy the cases are, which more or less means she can stay sane. I wish I had her mad skills: some of those cases were flat-out <b>horrifying</b>. *shudder*<br><br>Fourth, Rose Tyler. Anybody who can talk A FRIGGIN DALEK out of exterminating someone (even if it <i>would</i> have been a completely appropriate ironic death and said Dalek was genetically altered) gets major Badass Points in my book. More importantly, she and the Doctor play well off each other; it&#39;s like watching best friends bicker =D<br><br>I have more favorites, but I need to study for a Statistics test. -_-</p>

            <p>Barbara Chesterton (nйe Wright), who pioneered the Dalek-lens-blocking trick, smashed the mind-controlling entities that had ruled a city for some time, mowing down Daleks with a truck <i>that hadn&#39;t been used in a long time</i>, getting the Daleks into a panic with every bit of history she can dredge up, and <i>surviving a fourth encounter with tougher Daleks than she&#39;s ever faced before</i> according to Sarah Jane Smith.

            <p>Faramir. He showed that the right thing can be done, even if it is painful, and he just kept going even when it was pretty much hopeless. I know he was supposed to be the opposite of Boromir, there to show the potential of Men and some people say he is too good as written, but when I first read LotR, I was very black and white thinking. <br><br>I went to a school with an atmosphere of abusing the kids, just because they had the opportunity to do so. Like actual physical abuse, an example would be a bus driver grabbing a first grader by the arm, picking him up over the seat, slamming him to the floor of the aisle, and then literally dragging him up the aisle, banging his head on seats and backpacks as he went. And verbal stuff like the teacher who felt it was perfectly allowable to call everyone in her room fat, lazy cows and tell us that she had a gun in her desk and wouldn&#39;t be afraid to use it on us. Honestly, she wasn&#39;t the worst (there was one guy who actively enjoyed mentally torturing the students, and was very good at it), just the most direct.<br><br>Anyway, a black and white thinker combined with that environment? Faramir was like a hope for the future that not everyone was like that, and sometimes people who were good came out the other side and got to have a good life.</p>

            <p>Thane (Mass Effect)<br>Oh dear Lord, where do I begin with this guy? I can&#39;t tell you how much I love this character: everything from his design, to his characterization, to his romance arc in the second game of the series... Holy ...ing shit, I <i>love</i> this guy. The fact that he is the reason why I got into Mass Effect in the first place should tell you everything. Which makes it a shame that he was put to the side in ME3, and which makes it even worse that the fandom has neglected him completely since then: though I guess that&#39;s some comfort, considering that there was a lot of bad shipfic starring Thane...<br><br>Katniss Everdeen (Hunger Games)<br>I&#39;ve seen people talk about how she&#39;s a Canon Sue, but personally I don&#39;t really buy that argument. Yeah, she&#39;s unusually gifted with a bow and the plot does sometimes make sure she doesn&#39;t kill anyone, and yeah she&#39;s certainly not the nicest girl in the world, which would make for a Sue most of the time, right? Not in this case: Katniss is kind of a mean girl, but it&#39;s all a function of the fact that she&#39;s living in a state of constant fear of losing those close to her because of the environment she was brought up in. And considering my heritage, I gravitate towards that quite a bit, and it annoys me when I see Sues that try to push her to the sidelines of her own story...</p>

            <p>The most tragic fictional character of all time, in my opinion. He was bitten by Greyback at the age of <i>four,</i> spent most of his childhood thinking he had no future, thought he&#39;d lost all his friends in a single night and spent over a decade alone, was almost unable to find employment because of his condition, and when it finally seemed he found happiness- married to a woman who loved him regardless of that, had a son- he <i>died.</i> HOW IS THAT FAIR.</p>

            <p>Well, currently, I&#39;m going through a <i>Codex Alera</i> obsession-phase, so...<br><br>(Also, SPOILERS AHEAD. If you ever intend to read the series, stay away.)<br><br>Tavi. Tavar. Gaius Octavian. <b>Gaius Tavarus Magnus</b>. He is insane, and brilliant, and so wonderfully, absurdly clever. Watch him successfully hold a bridge, unexpectedly captain of a mostly-untrained Legion, while outnumbered 10 to 1 by nine-foot-tall wolfmen, and tell me he&#39;s not madly amazing. Or that duel with Navaris, one of the top three swordspeople in the world. He wins by talking to her about a pain they share. Or both variations on the theme of ice-ships. Or the fact that he broke into the most secure prison in the Realm. <i>Twice.</i> The second time after he suggested improvements. Or that he&#39;s <i>gadara</i> (trusted enemy, approximately) to a centuries-old Canim warmaster. Or, finally, that Realm-wide watercrafting he sent out to counter the vord Queen&#39;s. I could go <i>on</i>.<br><br>And his mother <i>threw a shark onto a pirate ship</i>. And then healed a life threatening injury in five minutes. <i>Without a healing tub.</i> And that&#39;s not even mentioning how she got High Lord Antillus&#39;s support. Snow for watercrafting! We know where Tavi got his creativity, certainly.<br><br>But honestly, over the past while, quite unexpectedly, Fidelias/Valiar Marcus has been growing on me. He&#39;s interesting, and though his name seems misleading at first, considering how he&#39;s the wild card of the cast (Invidia goes beyond wild card territory and straight into chronic backstabbing disorder), he&#39;s always, <i>always</i>, loyal to Alera as a whole. And he really did like being Valiar Marcus. It was good for him. Also, his resignation letter to Lady Aquitaine was sort of brilliant.<br><br>There are lots of other characters I could gush about, and not just <i>Codex</i> ones either (although a chance to go on about Varg is something I shall have to appropriate at some point), but it&#39;s late, I&#39;m tired, and I should really be asleep.

She also tries hard, and even though she&#39;s not as powerful as the rest of the cast, she still gets on and fights. She doesn&#39;t even make her celestial spirits do all the work.<br><br>I also kind of like Ron. He&#39;s a nice, loyal guy who&#39;s been through a lot. He&#39;s a great comfort to Harry, and the kind of friend that you can tell about you hilarious O.W.L. mistakes is completely priceless. I&#39;d like a friend like that. <br><br>Ron is also completely abused. He&#39;s not hawt and he&#39;s not extraordinary in any way, so he&#39;s made into a jerk. Suethors really need to know that &#39;somewhat immature&#39; does not mean &#39;completely evil&#39;. His relationship with Hermione in canon was cute, and it&#39;s nice to see that the girl is not paired up with the main character for once. I hate Suethors who think that H/Hr should be the canon ship simply because of that expectation. Harry and Hermione are friends, and that should be quite enough.</p>

            <p>on this fantasy webcomic I&#39;ve been trying to get off the ground. I would very much like some critique on some of my ideas for it.  As well as some help with some idea block I have on a few things (mostly on the deities/religion of the world and a few other things).<br><br>The reason I&#39;m asking for help on The Board is because some one in my class said I should ask for some outside opinions and The Board was the first thing that popped into my head. :)<br><br>to clarify, the main premise is a DnD type fantasy world but with modern day tech, entertainment, and science to some extent. I&#39;ve named the world Stro, first original sounding world name that popped into my head.</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve now started three new threads in a row. This is discouraged, because it knocks older threads that may still be active down and eventually OFF the front page. We&#39;d much rather that you add onto a thread you already started, or other existing threads on similar topics. If there aren&#39;t any, then create a new one, but please don&#39;t start multiple new threads in a row.<br><br>As for the characters, &quot;coolness&quot; is not really what you should be worrying about when it comes to PPC agents. What you ought to be worrying about is whether they&#39;re well conceived, three-dimensional, sympathetic, and entertaining. By that measure, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re missing the mark so far.<br><br>I&#39;m gonna tell you straight up that I would never grant Permission for a character designed to be sadistic and having a history of making terroristic threats. I doubt any of the other PGs would, either. That kind of character is not fun to read about in what&#39;s supposed to be a humorous adventure through a piece of so-bad-it&#39;s-funny fanfic.<br><br>The other character doesn&#39;t have much of a description beyond his powers—not even what he looks like. (And you didn&#39;t describe Agent #1, either.) I don&#39;t know enough about the continuum to know whether Agent #2 is <i>over</i>powered or not, but it concerns me that that&#39;s what you focus on rather than who he is as a human being (or whatever species he is). You&#39;ve given him that he&#39;s nice and gets along with his partner, which is fine, but his personality needs a lot more fleshing out before he&#39;ll be a solid character.<br><br>Also, please work on your capitalization and punctuation. Words at the beginning of new sentences need capitals, and most punctuation requires a space between the punctuation mark and the following word. You seem to particularly struggle with putting a space after each comma. Please study how punctuation is used in the books you read and how others write here on this Board.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...yeah, I&#39;m getting massively mixed signals on this.<br><br>Okay, so first we have to place this game within the series. Considering that this character&#39;s backstory involves the Kirijo Group, this places us squarely in Persona 3, which is worth noting since the summoning of personas differs in each installment of the series. They are technically all in the same universe considering that characters from Persona 2 are mentioned in Persona 3 (and then considering that characters from Persona 3 show up in Persona 4 Arena), but the Persona summoning works differently between each game, and that&#39;s kind of important to note when talking about Persona.<br><br>Now, Nagi is supposed to be an experiment to be a Wild Card. As Des pointed out, it is indeed an ability only accessible to the protagonist, and it&#39;s been outright stated even in the early parts of the game that his case is a very special one. Now, apparently Nagi didn&#39;t get the ability considering that 7.65 only gave him one Persona: if Nagi did have the Wild Card, he would be able to switch between Personas any time he wanted instead of just being stuck with one (and trust me: it is virtually <b><i>impossible</i></b> to advance through Persona 3 if you don&#39;t <i>constantly</i> make the protagonist switch Personas). So on the Wild Card, it&#39;s a rather tough call, edging towards the not-Stu side in my opinion.<br><br>What&#39;s less difficult to call, though, is that he was part of experiments with the Kirijo Group. In this account, I would say he is pretty speshul because, at least from what I have played, he should not have turned out the way he did. See, there <i>is</i> a precedent for that in canon: the protagonist is opposed by a group of three artifical Persona users who call themselves Strega. They were the product of a bunch of Kirijo Group experiments, though their end goal was to just awaken their Persona, rather than to give them the Wild Card ability. Problem is, the three members of Strega have tons of mental issues, depending on the members: most notably is that the only girl in the group, Chidori Yoshino, is shown to have a dependence on her Evoker that functions almost like a <i>drug addiction</i>. Further, the group as a whole seems to function on a rather hedonistic philosophy, considering how they use the Dark Hour for their own monetary benefit. In addition, since their Personas weren&#39;t awakened naturally, they need to take a suppressant to keep their Persona from outright <i>killing</i> them. So overall, I feel that being part of experiments of the Kirijo Group would have severely traumatized Nagi. Now, this would all be fine if this was reflected in the character, but from what 7.65 has said, Nagi&#39;s personality seems to be &quot;Yukari Takeba, except he takes charge a little more often&quot;, indicating that such a potentially traumatic past had very little effect on him. So I would call him speshul just based on this alone, and it&#39;s this among other things that sort of reads a bit on the Stu-ish side for me. And that&#39;s <i>before</i> we go into how Persona 3 wouldn&#39;t have a plot if it weren&#39;t for the Kirijo Group.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the fact that he goes to the Nanjo Group from the Kirijo Group. The Nanjo Group works pretty closely with the Kirijo Group, believe it or not, so I find it tough to believe that the Nanjo Group would just keep him around when it might present a conflict of interest given that they still do work together. Granted, they did used to be part of the same group before the Kirijo Group split from Mr. Nanjo, but they still work together on a lot of things. <br><br>So I would say that Nagi is kinda close to being qualified as a Gary Stu in terms of Persona 3. Granted, I haven&#39;t played Persona 3 all the way to the end, so take it with a grain of salt: but if I were a PG, I would be <i>extremely</i> hesitant to grant permission to 7.65 based solely on the fact that Nagi is too close to being a Gary Stu for comfort.<br><br>And that&#39;s before we talk about the problems involved with having a sadistic 13-year-old as an agent. I imagine the psychological issues therein would be through the roof, so...</p>

            <p>so,you thought Nagi is speshul.<br><br>well then,featuring the new and improved Nagisa Kazuhiro!<br><br>Nagi used to have to take the same drugs as strega until he joined the PPC. the flowers saw Nagi&#39;s dependence on a lethal drug to be a liability,so the Yuuzahn vong shapers in the employ of DoSAT gave him a biotech parasite that helps him control his persona.<br><br>Nagi was quite young when he was experimented on(around 7-8)<br>so when he escaped,he was pretty much like strega:hedonistic,violent,and tough to handle.<br>after being adopted by the nanjo group,he went through psychological therapy and was given drugs to help repress his memories. the Nagi you see today is the result of this<br><br>Nagi&#39;s wild card is severely neutered compared to the protagonists. he can only use 4 personas at a time,and those personas are pretty weak,the most skills one possess are 4.<br><br>does this make him more speshul? or does it flesh him out.<br>if the former,I&#39;ll rewrite him.</p>

            <p>...but to me, you&#39;ve basically admitted that you didn&#39;t think about <i>any</i> of this stuff before I brought it up, &#39;cause you basically just regurgitated everything I said and called it &quot;fleshing out the character&quot;. Which, fine, that&#39;s better than nothing, but I&#39;ll get to the new logic issues that this brings up.<br><br>See, here&#39;s the thing I need to mention that points to a larger problem here: to my mind, you&#39;ve confirmed that it&#39;s not an issue of &quot;I have fleshed out the characters and I just have difficulty writing that&quot;, as much as it is a case of &quot;oops, I didn&#39;t think that far ahead&quot;. See, that right there is the reason why Rule of Cool is such a problem in badfic. Badfic authors constantly think &quot;well, how cool would it be if this character was this or could do these things&quot; without thinking about them from a logical standpoint within the context of the story they&#39;re in. As such, things happen that make no damn sense.<br><br>My classic example? <i>Parallel Realities</i>, which was a terrible Mass Effect fanfic which involved some stupid AU where Commander Shepard was a not-human alien from another reality with its own set of aliens. Now, Shepard constantly tells us in that fic that his galaxy can&#39;t reveal themselves because &quot;dude, the Council would subjugate us &#39;cause we have all this stuff&quot;. Problem is, the author then decided &quot;hm, I should let the Rule of Cool apply to these alien races and make them as badass as possible&quot;. So later in the fic, you were seeing their ships do things like take out an entire batarian slaver fleet, and take out <i>four Reapers</i> with one shot. They mention that their numbers are too low, but their technology is way advanced to make up for this. The problem there is that it ruins any credibility Shepard had, because the fact that they can take out <i>four Reapers</i> with one weapon indicates that they would in fact have the technology to <i>not</i> be subjugated by the Council. Because of the Rule of Cool, the author of that fic invalidated his own main character&#39;s reasoning for not doing something pretty significant, and as a result a large part of the plot became rather stupid (not to mention that it made it obvious that the only reason they weren&#39;t intervening was because there would be less plot regurgitation that way).<br><br>That&#39;s the kind of thing that unchecked Rule of Cool can do to a fanfic. And from what I&#39;m seeing here, you&#39;re currently in that same mindset. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you need to slow down and really think about the characters and their backstories before doing stuff.<br><br>Okay. Back to the character.<br><br>Now we have <i>new</i> problems that&#39;re brought up. So he was given drugs to repress his memories? Um... pardon my vernacular, but you <i>do</i> realize how ...ed up that sounds, right? &quot;Oh, he&#39;s a problem, but that&#39;s okay: just throw some memory repression drugs at him and it&#39;ll be all fine!&quot; I&#39;m pretty sure it doesnt work like that: what if he&#39;s resistant to them? What if he goes off his meds for even one second? Wha then? And on top of that, memory repression drugs do <i>not</i> work like that in anything that isn&#39;t <i>To The Moon</i>. Granted, Medical probably could come up with something like that, but someone in Persona? Um, no. I doubt it, nor do I think that the suppression of memory would exactly be the right solution to his issues. I would say more, but I&#39;d have to bring in my friend who&#39;s currently getting a degree in criminal psychology and I really, <i>really</i> don&#39;t want to drag him into any more discussions about badfic psychology than I already have.<br><br>Second of all, you&#39;ve just made Nagi overpowered with the Wild Card. I&#39;m not sure you understand this, but the Wild Card is a protagonist-centered ability, and said protagonists are said to be special <i>by the canon</i>. So you see, even in the <i>canon</i> they know it&#39;s unusual. By the very <i>nature</i> of Wild Card as a special ability, you&#39;re making your character speshul in a way that few canon characters would be. It doesn&#39;t matter how much you neuter his ability, it&#39;s still special according to the canon. This wouldn&#39;t be as bad if this was the main character of a different group that had nothing to do with anything related to Persona 3 (as well as any of the other Persona installments), but the fact that it&#39;s dealing with Persona 3 just makes this worse for me.<br><br>And for the record, the only one who has Wild Card is the player character himself (and Aigis in &quot;The Answer&quot;, but for her it&#39;s an even more special case considering that she loses an ability she had in the main game to get Wild Card). All the other members of SEES get one Persona that evolves as the game goes. Their Persona evolves into another one, but they still only keep one Persona. You may notice that this is NOT the same as being able to summon multiple Personas. Therefore, I have no idea why you said &quot;protagonists&quot;, plural.<br><br>Third: So if Nagi had never been given meds, he&#39;d be exactly like your other character? I guess that&#39;s good to know that we&#39;re dealing with two of the same exact character here.<br><br>Fourthly, what good would a biotech parasite do to keep a Persona from killing him? Personas function through willpower: they&#39;re manifestations of the personality of the characters that unleash them, and it&#39;s revealed in &quot;The Answer&quot; that the Personas are tamed Shadows. The reason they went with drugs in the canon is because psychiatric drugs in the real world affect how the brain works. How would something that works on the body help control a matter of the mind?<br><br>And lastly, branching off from the above point: the reasoning of the above point is probably the deal breaker for me, and I&#39;m sure it would be a deal breaker for any PG here. To me, this tells me that you don&#39;t seem to understand how Personas work. Let me repeat that: this tells me that you don&#39;t seem to understand how the Personas--the things that make the entire plot possible, the things that get tons of exposition for, and the things <i><b>that make up the frickin&#39; name of the frickin&#39; continuum</b></i>--work in the canon. This right here is the most damning thing to me in terms of everything you&#39;ve written down. Your character is written in such a way that it disregards how Personas work in the canon, which means that it&#39;s a massive canon violation. And frankly, it doesn&#39;t matter if you do know how Personas work: it still indicates a lack of thought on your end. If your attempt to &quot;flesh out&quot; the character involves completely breaking the most important part of the canon, why should we trust that you&#39;d have the judgment necessary to be able to give an accurate assessment of the problems of various badfics in <i>any</i> continuum?<br><br>Now, I&#39;m not a PG, so someone else may see this differently, but if I were a PG, I&#39;d tell you to take it all back to the drawing board and start over. Frankly, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re ready to write for the PPC in any capacity.<br><br>But you know what? That&#39;s okay. Not all of us in the PPC write missions. Most of us are here to learn, as well as to make fun of bad writing. I do think that the character here exhibits some major Gary Stu tendencies, but I can tell that you&#39;re passionate about writing nevertheless. That&#39;s a good thing: now all that&#39;s left is to filter that passion so you can do it right. And that can be done by slowing down and not jumping into things.<br><br>The creative process is not something that happens instantaneously. It needs to come at the right pace, and in this case I think the right pace will come from you slowing down and thinking a little more about what you want to write.</p>

            <p>Hiding something in their past is a reasonable thing for agents to do. However, giving an agent an actual, World One, horribly devastating psychological disorder is not funny. I have doubts that you have researched this disorder beyond seeing it in media (where it is often portrayed as something to be laughed at-not with-AT). They GET IT WRONG--very, very wrong. People living with a dissociative disorder are not typically extremely functional people in day to day life, and DID is the most severe of the bunch.<br><br>An excerpt from <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/in-depth-understanding-dissociative-disorders/0001377">Psych Central</a><br><br>&quot;In fact, persons suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder often seek treatment for a variety of other problems including depression, mood swings, difficulty concentrating, memory lapses, alcohol or drug abuse, temper outbursts, and even hearing voices, or psychotic symptoms. People with dissociation often also seek treatment for a variety of medical problems including headaches, unexplained pains, and memory problems.&quot;</p>

            <p>why I have a problem with both of your agents. <br><br>From the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC#Spirit_of_the_PPC">Spirit of the PPC</a> section of the Guide to the PPC:<br><br>Let me highlight a paragraph of that. <br><br><b>Put as simply as possible, the PPC is about <i>having fun</i>.<br><br>This means that the primary focus of our stories and interactions is comedy, and that we don’t like rainy-day types very much. Anyone taking things Too Seriously or who doesn’t enjoy our particular brand of silliness probably won’t have fun here. This is all done for the laughs; we’re not going to change that. We love the PPC just the way it is – with no logic, no sanity, and above all, no realism. After all, we have miniature fiery demons pop into existence every time a random author misspells a name, and our Headquarters requires a six-dimensional map – this place couldn’t touch “realistic” with a ten <i>mile</i> pole</b><br><br>And from the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC#What_NOT_to_Write">What NOT to Write</a> section of that guideline:<br><br><b>We don’t want to see any SuperPowered Agents walking around. This place is not about who can be the “coolest” agent, who has the best weapons, or who can handle the most disgusting badfic. This is <i>not</i> a competition. We don’t want dark, aggressive stories – we want <i>humour</i>, and rest assured that the community at large will respond quickly if things start getting out of hand.</b><br><br>I&#39;m not calling you a bad writer (or person) for coming up with dark characters. Personally, I write horribly dark urban fantasy original fiction on occasion. My fanfic tends to be dark as well. The thing to remember is that the PPC is not the place for those kinds of characters and stories, so when you tell me, &#39;<i>This isn&#39;t for comedic purposes,it&#39;s serious and causes Nagi a lot of pain.</i>&#39; I have to think that you are missing a large part of the basic principles that make up the PPC.<br><br>Also, aside from concerns I have about a 13 year old agent, which are my own since there is ample precedent for agents that young, the weapons you listed Emile as preferring are big, heavy things that will kick like a mule. You didn&#39;t mention height, so going by the CDC growth chart for Caucasian males, Emile at average height for 13 would only be about 5&#39;2&quot; or 62 inches and weigh just over 100 pounds. Those rifles range from 43&quot; to 49&quot; long and from 8 lbs to almost 12 lbs in weight. My mom is 5&#39;6&quot; and owns a rifle of similar size. She had to have a custom short stock installed  to allow her to properly hold the rifle. Those rifles kick HARD even when held properly. While I don&#39;t believe it would be impossible for a 5&#39;2&quot; person to safely shoot those rifles, I doubt it would be much fun for them.</p>

            <p>And to expand, the Agent&#39;s Persona was pretty strong (but not as strong as the protagonists from the games/animes), but to summon it, he has to draw into his memories, which he tried to repress. Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>The first thing you need to change is that you need to calm down. Going into &quot;?!&quot; isn&#39;t going to help anyone, least of all yourselves.<br><br>And now, we need to establish something: if you&#39;re thinking of us as angry at it, then... well, I imagine that if your character&#39;s &quot;redesign&quot; involves trivializing a very serious mental illness, Miah probably was a little miffed. <br><br>So ultimately, the answer to all of your questions is: the best way to deal with the Sue Curse is to slow down and think about the characters you&#39;re creating for longer than two seconds. Don&#39;t just throw characteristics at your characters: think about how these characteristics could affect the characters first and how that might affect other characters. And most importantly, don&#39;t think of the &quot;what&quot;, but of the &quot;who&quot;; and yes, there&#39;s a pretty big difference between the two. As one of Wil Wheaton&#39;s guests on TableTop once said: &quot;who are these people, what do they want, and why should I give a shit?&quot; are the three most important rules of writing.<br><br>Thirdly, take your time. Improvement doesn&#39;t come immediately. Hell, I used to be a terrible author in my own right (and in fact, I&#39;m currently in the process of MSTing one of my old shames elsewhere on the internet), but I eventually got better. I&#39;m almost certain that you&#39;ll get better too.<br><br>All in all, it takes time to be able to write stuff pretty well. So don&#39;t be afraid of not producing anything immediately. You don&#39;t have to.<br><br>(And on a side note... You got the DID idea from Nord? That... actually explains a <i>lot</i> about the idea itself, and why it&#39;s so damn terrible and ill-fitting with things that are not his own fiction.)</p>

            <p>You&#39;re not cursed. What you need to do, as other people said, is to calm down and be patient. Everybody started as a newb - look at me, it took me a year and four tries to get Permission (had problems with, at that order, lack of plot, beigeness, and purpleness) - the trick is to learn from your mistakes. When you redesign Nagi, you should probably take a look at <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=249027;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a>; it&#39;s sound advice.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a bit more complicated than that anyway, since with some of it you really do need to see their tactics:<br><br>With the batarian slaver fleet, it was that there was one parallel galaxy ship against three batarian slavers. First, the batarian slavers open fire, which doesn&#39;t do a single thing against the barriers of the parallel galaxy&#39;s ship. (Literally, it&#39;s described in-story as &quot;shields are still at 100%&quot;.) Then, the parallel galaxy&#39;s ship pulls off a turn that would logically shear most ME galaxy ships in half. And then, the parallel galaxy has this super-advanced AI that can jump between pieces of hardware at will, and hey have enough of those on board that they&#39;re able to take over the computer systems of each ship to keep the batarians from using them. And when the parallel galaxy storms the ships, the batarians&#39; guns don&#39;t do a single thing to them. Logically, most of this would be powerful against the ME galaxy, so...<br><br>And as for &quot;taking out four Reapers with one shot&quot;, they basically just fired a glorified mining laser at one specific Reaper and happened to get four of them at the same time. Granted, the weapon does seem to be cumbersome to aim, but c&#39;mon, four reapers in one hit? That&#39;s still overpowered!</p>

            <p>There are many reasons, chiefest among which is that I have way too much on my plate and I&#39;m failing pretty hard at keeping my commitments as it is. *pulls Hat of Shame down over her eyes* So, I just don&#39;t have that kind of time or energy to spare. Also, I don&#39;t think we have any major fandoms in common, probably because I&#39;m 28 and you&#39;re not. (How old are you?)<br><br>If it&#39;s friends you lack, what I recommend is to table your agent ideas for the time being and just hang out with us and chat about general stuff so you can make some friends here. You should also use the time to work on your typing, read more spin-offs, and learn more about how the PPC works. That way, you&#39;ll be better prepared for creating good PPC characters in the future.<br><br>And, most of all, I hope you&#39;ll have fun! There&#39;s a lot more to us than agents and missions, and I think the people who appreciate that have the best time here. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First of all, as Outhra notes, the term appears <i>alongside</i> &quot;Lust-object&quot; in the PPC Agents infobox, which is usually what people are looking at when this question comes up. I put that space in the infobox myself, so I can tell you with certainty it&#39;s there to cover anyone (and anything) an agent might have strong protective feelings about <i>in addition</i> to the characters they lust after—if any. Not everyone HAS to lust. Why should they? However, everyone has favorite characters, or species, or languages, or places, etc. &quot;Favorites&quot; provides a space for that. It doesn&#39;t replace the space for the character(s) an agent actually does lust after.<br><br>Second, when were people complaining about saying &quot;Lust Object&quot;? I don&#39;t remember this. Admittedly, that doesn&#39;t mean much, but usually I notice if there&#39;s a widespread movement to change something about the PPC.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The reason Agent Dafydd has a registered Lust Object (Goldberry, since I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been mentioned) is that at that point, everyone <i>did</i> have to lust - or at least list an LO. The idea of &#39;favourites&#39; - under one name or another - came about when people decided they didn&#39;t want to do that. We&#39;re probably talking &#39;04 or &#39;05 here - I don&#39;t know precisely, it&#39;s been ten years.<br><br>And let me just note - I wasn&#39;t complaining about it, per se (since my wife seems to think I was).

Thanks for clearing that up. {= )<br><br>I think getting away from everyone having an LO is a good thing, really. Like Wolfychann is quoted as saying in the FAQ: For Other People: &quot;Am I the last person in the world who thinks that publicly expressing physical lust for a complete stranger is... kinda creepy?&quot; IMO, the quote applies more to how some fans behave toward Real World people, less to fictional characters having feelings for other fictional characters whom they actually get to meet in the course of their job, but still.

            <p>It is good for asexual agents to be able to list a favorite. Kelok is emphatically asexual, but also very, very protective of Sherlock Holmes--especially when Holmes is written into a lusty caricature of himself.</p>

            <p>The wiki&#39;s Agent templates show both, one right under the other, and it&#39;s not hard to see where there might be confusion.<br><br>eatpraylove, I that the distinction is in the way they are viewed by the agents. A Lust Object would be someone who an individual agent finds extremely attractive, and depending on the agent, that lust could go to the extent that any mission involving that character could potentially be compromised. That&#39;s why one needs to register one&#39;s Lust Objects with the Department of Personnel, so that they can assign missions with a registered Lust Object in a primary role to someone else, assign them to you with a fair deal of warning, or assign them to you because there was a filing error or they/the Ironic Overpower thought it would be funny.<br><br>Favorites are more like characters that the agent in question particularly enjoys within canonical material. An agent would react more strongly if a favorite character was altered by a badfic and driven to uncharacteristic acts, because they have a stronger investment in that character. Maybe, in a badfic, someone who is usually very humorous would start spewing the worst jokes or angsting in a corner, or the wise swordfighting mentor would make rudimentary battle mistakes. Even if they&#39;re not someone&#39;s favorite, it would be a charge either way, but if they are, the agent might start an angry rant or begin banging their head against nearby objects, or with the worst cases/with the most rage-prone agents, need to restrain themselves from going up and indignantly decking the replacement right in the face, which would reveal the PPC&#39;s presence too early.</p>

            <p>sexual vs romantic attraction. Lust Objects are clearly of a more sexual attraction sorta thing, whereas favourites have the potential to be simply the object of romantic/platonic attraction, which doesn&#39;t necessarily incorporate sexual attraction.<br><br>Therefore it&#39;s entirely likely that an asexual agent might have favourites, but not necessarily a lust object.</p>

            <p>I like the beginning of this mission immensely.  Agent Desdendelle&#39;s reaction to Anebrin&#39;s snapping feels realistic, and I can empathize with that.  The Librarian&#39;s introduction starts out strong, with the Time Lord&#39;s straightforwardness and lack of emotional reaction serving as a good counterpoint to Agent Des&#39;s attitude.<br><br>Once the mission gets going, though, it seems like the Librarian fades into the background.  Most of his dialogue during the mission is basically just re-statements of what&#39;s happening around him (&quot;You are telling me that this… author… did not research their subject before writing about it?&quot;) or leading questions that allow Des to tutor him in mission basics (&quot;... How do you know the… author misspelled anything?&quot;)  He doesn&#39;t express much of a personality during all this interplay, or even much in the way of Time Lordiness, apart from one comment about the flow of time being affected by the fic.  It&#39;s good to show a new agent reacting to their first badfic, but the Librarian hardly reacts at all--he just talks about it.  I hope he&#39;ll show more of his personality in future missions.<br><br>Also, a note about the minis: technically, <i>Forgotten Realms</i> already had mini-Slayers as its mini; however, based on when you were talking about this mission in the chat, you couldn&#39;t possibly have known that, because I hadn&#39;t put it on the wiki until after you started writing.  Since all surviving mentions of mini-Slayers apart from that Directory are gone, and no one is recorded as having adopted any, I&#39;ll happily support mini-Eyeballs as the official mini type.  (Now go make them a page, please.  I don&#39;t know much about FR!)</p>

            <p>First of all, thanks for the concrit.<br>The Librarian fading into the background is a product of two main things. One, this is his first mission, so he can&#39;t really snark yet - he doesn&#39;t get what&#39;s going on, basically, and the Notary isn&#39;t involved, so he doesn&#39;t have someone to shout at. Two, maybe on hindsight I should&#39;ve used a <i>Doctor Who</i> badfic as his first mission, as it would have elicited a stronger reaction from him; simply put, he doesn&#39;t care enough about FR now.<br>As to the Minis, I saw something about <i>Baldur&#39;s Gate</i> having mini-Slayers in the wiki (and to be honest, since I&#39;ve never progressed much in that game or its sequel, I have no idea what mini-Slayers even look like), but that was after I wrote the mission... and since you support the mini-Eyeballs, we&#39;ll use that. I&#39;ll write a page, alright.</p>

            <p>use mini-Eyeballs as the main FR continuum&#39;s mini, and the mini-Slayer as the mini for the BG games, since they seem to be a spin-off of sorts.  That way, the old OFU author still has some input in the matter.</p>

            <p>Bad SCPs are eventually deleted because they&#39;re downvoted too much. Anything Mary-Sueish gets deleted in short order and there are a few SCPs that are now &quot;decommissioned&quot;, with SCP writers having actually written pieces about destroying the SCP in question.<br><br>The SCP is also very meta; for example, they possess at least one method, probably more, for entering and interacting with fictional universes. They could, theoretically, find out about the PPC. But there&#39;s so much else that they concern themselves with that the PPC would not be a major discovery for them.<br><br>Because they&#39;re so evil (let&#39;s face it, they are; they&#39;re perfectly willing to torture and kill sentient innocents), they would make dangerous allies. And because they take care of their own &#39;Sues, there&#39;s no need to interact with the continuum. My best guess is that the PPC knows better than to reveal themselves, and the SCP foundation is too busy torturing and killing to prevent the end of the world to try entering the PPCverse.</p>

            <p>...but I do keep using PPC characters when asked to write sentences on my French exams, and I had one on April 1st this year. So, of course, for the sentence I had to write using the word &#39;citizenship&#39;, I had someone telling Edgar that in order to get citizenship he had to ask &#39;Monsieur Sod&#39; to write a letter to the government agents. In hindsight, I expect I could have written something about Acacia annoying Jay by getting Roman citizenship, but it didn&#39;t occur to me at the time, so I just stuck the Marquis de Sod in there.

            <p>For various reasons, most of the time I spend on the computer is on a system which outright blocks the Wiki. So it&#39;s very rare that I&#39;ll lay a finger on it these days - and almost never to do more than make a quick edit. Writing an entire page is beyond me.<br><br>But <i>someone</i> can certainly write it. The Cyclopaedia is linked from <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Other.htm">my Webplex</a>, and includes nearly all the information created about Plort (the sole exception being the road map, which I haven&#39;t gotten in there).

            <p>So I&#39;m finally breaking that &quot;two missions curse!&quot;  This is actually the second mission I wrote, way back in 2011, even though it takes place after my previous mission.  This mission takes place in <i>Epic Mickey</i> and I would rate it maybe just slightly above G, pretty tame.  (As far as I can tell, no one else in the PPC cares about EM, but whatever.  This is <i>my</i> spin-off.)<br><br>This mission incorporates a few things from back while I was writing it:<br><br>A) A general movement to avoid violent killing in missions, which had kind of taken over PPC narratives at the time.<br><br>B) A writing challenge--started by JulyFlame, I believe--to show characters having an argument and then resolving it.  The argument appears in this mission; the resolution is going to be shown in an interlude that follows this.  (At the rate I write, start watching for that in 2016.)<br><br>C) The Poison Joke RP started by Laburnum and kitsune106.  <s>That can be read here:</s>  Unfortunately, I just discovered that RP has fallen off the Board.  Um . . . did anyone save that?  &gt;_&gt; (The search only goes back to 2012 now.  I was just looking at 2008 posts while researching minis!  What happened?)<br><br>Anyway, the actual mission: <a href="http://doctorlit.dreamwidth.org/3603.html"><a href="http://doctorlit.dreamwidth.org/3603.html">http://doctorlit.dreamwidth.org/3603.html</a></a><br><br>I&#39;m a little more unsure of this mission.  It doesn&#39;t feel as strong to me as my others, but my betas seemed to enjoy it, so I&#39;m interested to hear how entertaining folks find it.<br><br>I have a full list of minis, which will wind up on the wiki sometime in the next few days.</p>

            <p>First off, let me take off my cap to you (pretend I&#39;m wearing a cap for the purpose of this figure of speech). It&#39;s hard to break out of the formula of &quot;snark at the Sue, rage, kill the Sue&quot; that so prevalent in the PPC. But this mission did it in a way that didn&#39;t seem forced or out of place. So kudos to you.<br><br>I also liked the emphasis on the cartoon nature of the disguises. The scene where Doc gets clunked by the bombs and gets the little flock of books flying around his head is a good example. Very <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i>. It&#39;s also nice to be reminded that the disguises are more than just hard light holograms (or whatever we said they were again).<br><br>Not too much I can say in regards to problems. I did think that Doc&#39;s Gollumesque reactions at the beginning and the end were a bit unrealistic considering what is happening, but that&#39;s just a matter of my own taste.<br><br>I look forward to seeing your next updates.</p>

            <p>I am trying to follow in July&#39;s footsteps and live up to the Floaters name by having a good variety of mission types, with more creativity solution-wise than just assassinations.  (My first one was pretty ordinary, I guess, but there wasn&#39;t much <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> badfic to choose from, so.)<br><br>One of my favorite parts of writing missions is getting to explore the setting of the canon world, and the disguises are frequently a part of that.

            <p>Various people have already mentioned the things I like most about it—the meta, the agents exploring their Toonish forms, the parallel between the choices offered in the game and Vania&#39;s decision at the end, the way Millie redeems herself by giving the Heart back. All very enjoyable. <sup>_^</sup>  I remember thinking Doc should have known better than to go investigate the bomb when it didn&#39;t go off, because cartoon bombs <i>always</i> wait to go off until the person who set them comes to see why they haven&#39;t, but it still made a good gag.<br><br>I was a little sad that they threw away the extra paintbrush, though. Probably a wise decision on the agents&#39; part, but taking Sue artifacts as souvenirs is a fine old PPC tradition! I can&#39;t help but feel they missed an opportunity for some fun in HQ, or at least some good bartering.<br><br>Also, the Poison Joke problem didn&#39;t get resolved. Is that something that&#39;ll happen in the next interlude?<br><br>I caught a couple technical errors:<br><br>* &quot;Once she saw Mickey, the two characters introduced each other&quot; - Did you mean &quot;introduced themselves&quot;? Otherwise, Millie is introducing Mickey and vice versa, which doesn&#39;t make much sense. I wouldn&#39;t put it past the badfic, but I&#39;d think such an odd thing would warrant full inclusion in the mission rather than glossing over it. {= )<br><br>* &quot;<u>[Um. No. We’re technically toons right now, thanks to the disguise generator.] She gave a meek grin. [We would have melted, too.]</u>&quot; - The underline continues between the two bits of speech, and that seems to be anomalous.<br><br>BTW, I think the argument challenge was probably one of hS&#39;s writing challenges. VM wrote a couple of Cafeteria stories for the same one, as I recall.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Can&#39;t blame the &quot;introduced each other&quot; on the badfic; that one was wholly mine!  And the text box speech . . . I couldn&#39;t think of a better way to portray that on paper (as it were), but it sure made for a nightmare of htmfail.<br><br>I kind of felt that I <i>had</i> to get rid of the paintbrush for Millie&#39;s sake.  Even early on in writing this, I had an inkling (no pun intended) that I would be using Millie at least in the interlude that follows.  Since she&#39;s pretty much stuck with the blot powers (can&#39;t chuck those through a portal!), she&#39;s going to have a bit of therapy and training to keep her Sue powers from taking over her characterization as she gets older, I think.  Having that brush floating around HQ somewhere could potentially be a bad temptation for her later OOOHHH I get it.  That could be interesting plot.  Maybe I will go back and keep the brush . . .  (The fact that there&#39;s really no explanation for how the brush works beyond &quot;there&#39;s a wizard, and magic happened&quot; was also part of my decision to ditch it; I just don&#39;t know how the thing works!)<br><br>And yes, an interlude is to follow.  There was enough stuff left to wrap up that I thought it could stand alone as an interlude.  (I&#39;m also hoping for a couple of guest appearances, but they&#39;re all from retired-ish members, so that could be interesting . . .)<br><br>Oh, and sorry for misattributing your challenge, hS.</p>

            <p>I quite enjoyed it, even without knowledge of Epic Mickey. (The only thing I know about it is that there&#39;s a brush mechanic that may or may not be similar to <i>Okami</i>&#39;s.)<br><br>I think my favorite part was the rapid-pace time-skips and the way you handled them.

            <p><i>Ōkami</i>&#39;s brush mechanic is <i>way</i> more sophisticated then EM&#39;s, which is basically &quot;point the Wiimote at the screen and shoot it.&quot;  The DS game did have a draw-with-the-stylus mechanic, though.<br><br>Those time skips were pretty much the biggest physical threat the badfic presented, so I had fun coming up with all the different ways bruises could be earned during that sequence.  Then, of course, I culminated it with a potential dip in the <s>Dip</s> Thinner.  (Gee.  I actually hadn&#39;t made that connection to <i>Roger Rabbit</i> before now.)</p>

            <p>I liked the part where Millie apologized to Yen Sid and gave his Heart back. Very classic Disney; if only more Sues redeemed themselves like that.

            <p>The plot is great and all, but there are some spots where I just got stuck hardcore.  (Vania&#39;s complaint about Lonesome Manor being hard is really my complaint; I was disappointed in how difficult that part was for me, because it was based on my favorite ride at Disneyland, and I didn&#39;t really get to enjoy it because of how frustrated I got.)  But then again, I&#39;m a very casual gamer, so maybe it&#39;s a fine game and I just stank at it.<br><br>That <i>is</i> a very Disney-esque ending, isn&#39;t it?  I didn&#39;t really notice at the time; I was just writing what had to be written!  And I&#39;m definitely going to write more of Millie and <s>Olsen</s> Ollie.  (Ohlsen is my maternal grandparents&#39; last name; I just can&#39;t associate that with a little kid.)  They&#39;re going to appear in my next two Doc+Vania interludes, and then I&#39;m thinking of doing some stories of them in the Nursery&#39;s school, which hasn&#39;t been seen (I think) since Oracle of Delphi wrote in it about ten years ago!</p>

            <p>So is Olsen&#39;s full name Ollie Olsen now? It does sound very Disney-esque, with the alliteration and the soft vowel sounds. That or 1960s Stan Lee, also because of the alliteration.<br><br>Anyway. Aside from the badfic rescues that are already adopted by agents, There are a couple of missions that rescued small children from their badfics, like Ava and Jennifer from <a href="http://ppc.timescale.nl/02NCIS.html">these two</a> <a href="http://ppc.timescale.nl/08ncis.html">Indemaat missions</a>(the second even doubles as an ex-Sue), and Will and Elizabeth from Cyba Zero&#39;s Mulan missions (mentioned as children here <a href="http://cyba-zero.livejournal.com">here</a> and recruited in the sequel <a href="http://cyba-zero.livejournal.com/2019.html">here</a>. There&#39;s also the young Khajiit named M&#39;sein created <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=3055">in the Halloween RP</a>, but I&#39;m not sure whether or not he counts as a character <i>written</i> by World-Jumper or simply <i>created</i> by him. You should probably ask first if you plan to include M&#39;sein.<br><br>I can try to track down a few more if you&#39;d like, but it might be easier to just ask some Boarders who have adopted badfic children to loan you a few additional classmates. Personally, I&#39;d like to see Herr Wozzeck&#39;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1OyjfWKA_-b8wONh7ggdtvqv_UbJjY_qG76vYwoDTkZE">four</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1kB_vws8UnfoP_Sy3P-rmTMHVtSL9iPAzuLKQKlNzfrI">rescues</a> again.

            <p>Mostly because I forgot about that RP. I have a tenancy to do that with Board RPs. They sound great, but when I try to participate, things get complicated, real life gets in the way, and I leave Printworthy standing in the middle of a room without ever telling his story of how he became uncanon. Sorry about that, by the way.<br><br>Anyway, M&#39;sein. I have no plans for him, so as far as I see it, he&#39;s open for use. Actually, because I like the idea of an expanded pool of free-use characters, I&#39;ll say that M&#39;sein is <b><u>Free To Use.</u></b> Anybody who wants to use him for any reason can do so. All I really know about him is that he is a Khajiit, and Khajiit like to sneak. However, he is not as stealthy as most of his kin. He is less of a jaguar, more of a lion. Of course, that could be because he&#39;s a kitten, and more wild now then he will be later. It is up to the future writers to decide.</p>

            <p>While I would love to wrap up the two ponies dialogue, I think I let it go stagnant far too long. Besides, the story he was going to tell will be part of an interlude I have coming up at some point. I would say soon, but I have a lot to do, and not a lot of time for writing. Besides, if I were to continue it, I would have to read up on what has happened in the rest of the RP to make sure it all fits together. No, I dropped the ball on this one. I&#39;ll try to do better next time.</p>

            <p>The school aspect of Nursery certainly hasn&#39;t been seen much - oracle and Ekwy are the instances I can think of, and the <i>Complete List</i> seems to back that up. But the Nursery aspect certainly has been - <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndNursery.htm">&#39;Nursery&#39;</a> is still, uh, only four years in the future, for one. I also suspect there are references in Laburnum&#39;s stories - both Marsha the triceratops, and Molly Rath the ferret, fit the profile for students.<br><br>For that matter, Marsha is 13 in the &#39;present&#39; of her stories, so if she shows up, she may well be in the school part. I don&#39;t know for sure, though.<br><br>You could also ask Tomash if there are any Board Archive references to Marsha, Molly, or Moses Taggson; they may well have come up in RPs.<br><br>In fact, over <s>in Ozerbord</s> on the Other Board, there are two possibly-relevant RPs: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=2165;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">Henry&#39;s Birthday</a> features at least a few children, and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=2959;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">the 2013 Trick-or-Treat</a> is partially set in the Nursery.

            <p>Doc and Vania had fun conversations this time around, and it was fun to watch them try to get used to their weirdly-altered states and all that. I also like that you didn&#39;t kill the Sue this time: Vania&#39;s reasoning is actually pretty correct, and I could see why she thought of recruiting her to the PPC. It&#39;s always nice to remind people that killing a Sue isn&#39;t the only option, you know?<br><br>I do think you&#39;re right that this doesn&#39;t feel as strong as, say, your Fahrenheit 451 mission. I think the main issue is actually something that&#39;s not entirely your fault: I think said issue is that the fic being sporked just doesn&#39;t have enough material to sustain a PPC mission like this. Its only real sin is that it seems to read like an especially bad synopsis of a prospective fic, and I think that might&#39;ve restricted the amount you could do with it. Most notably for me, I think that this could have led to the Ostown part of the mission being a <i>hair</i> too long, though take that with a grain of salt since you do manage to get quite a bit to do there regardless.  <br><br>Other than that one thing, though, it was a good mission, and it&#39;s been too damn long since the last one.<br><br>And on a side note... I can&#39;t be the only one that was thinking of this every time I read Millie&#39;s name: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdyCkZpMBlM"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdyCkZpMBlM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdyCkZpMBlM</a></a></p>

            <p>There was a bit more &quot;work&quot; to do in this mission, and I&#39;m sorry the narrative suffered for it.  Part of the reason for that extra Ostown scene was to get the agents away from the compressing time, which as you say, was the main problem with the fic, and maybe not enough of a funny thing to support a mission on.<br><br>But, I&#39;m still glad I wrote this.  It was a fun canon to explore, and I even got some recruits and minis out of it!<br><br>I actually <i>didn&#39;t</i> think of TMM after seeing Millie&#39;s name.  That&#39;s odd for me.

            <p>I&#39;ve heard about Epic Mickey and it looks really cool, but sadly I&#39;ve never gotten around to playing it, since I don&#39;t own a Wii.<br>But from your mission you give a really good impression of the game. I like the part about how in the game, you can chose between a quick &quot;evil&quot; solution or a more difficult &quot;good&quot; one (reminds me a bit of Mass Effect) and how it ends up tying into your agents&#39; decision. And much as I love to hate the truly horrible Stus and Sues, it&#39;s nice to see one every once in a while who is not truly, irredeemable bad. So it was a good choice of fic to go with that canon.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s what I liked about this fic; it gave me a chance to put my agents in the shoes of the player just a bit.  Same with the disappearing, reappearing Olsen.  The whole thing turned delightfully meta!</p>

            <p>This is the first of your missions that I&#39;ve read, so I can&#39;t compare it to the others, and I&#39;m only marginally familiar with Epic Mickey, but I noticed two issues in this section: <i>(Now that they were catching up to the story, they were avoiding portals as much as possible to put off the fast forward syndrome as long as possible.) Doc had been reading the Words as well (with difficulty, considering he wasn’t yet good at doing so with glasses) and had questions of his own.</i> You might consider rephrasing the parenthetical so that there aren&#39;t two &quot;as ___ as possible&quot;s in one sentence, and as for the second sentence, hadn&#39;t it been established earlier that he didn&#39;t have his glasses on?<br>Also, there&#39;s a missing comma after &quot;Millie&quot; in <i>You’re with Millie aren’t you?”</i><br><br>I liked the meta angle, though! We&#39;ve seen how the Word World reacts when the fic is deleted, but this is the first time I&#39;ve seen where the agents sent into a badfic get stuck between drafts. I wonder what this would&#39;ve done to the Intelligence agent sent to scout it out. Would they have only been in the first draft, and unaware of the second, or would they have been trapped between versions the way the Agents sent into it later were?<br>Notably, the version of the badfic that you linked seems to have gone through yet another draft change, since Millie is now an eleven-year-old named Mileena, and Olsen has been written back in.</p>

            <p>Oh, wow.  It changed quite a bit!  And yet . . . the main problem of plot-hopping is still there.  And the weird speshul treatment from Yen Sid.<br><br>Gosh.  &quot;Mileena.&quot;  &quot;Millie&quot; was already an old-sounding name for a young protagonist, and now it just sounds . . . well.  Not like a name any little kid would want to be called.  Ever.  At all.<br><br>At least the grammar and sentence structure seem much improved.  In fact, the author has fixed most of the misspellings that caused the minis I collected.  I wonder if I technically have to make them go poof now?  Ugh.  I need to cut down my mission-writing time so these things don&#39;t happen.<br><br>You know, I had forgotten about Millie getting the blot&#39;s ink powers in the end, like Mickey.  Her skin color was never mentioned, so I think I&#39;ll make her black.  We need more agents of color anyway, and it will match up with Mickey&#39;s black fur dripping with ink in the game.  And Olsen &quot;looked like Mileena&#39;s twin&quot; so we get another black character out of the bargain!  Sweet!</p>

            <p>Since they&#39;re from Millie&#39;s version of the story rather than Mileena&#39;s, they shouldn&#39;t be deleted by alterations made to the Mileena draft. That sounds plausible, right? And not like I just made it up to justify keeping the mini-Spatters around because I want to adopt one?<br><br>By the way, do you have the full list of minis? The charge list says that the original fic produced fifteen, but only five were ever named in the mission.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this. Sure, some characters are omnipotent, and others are aware of the fourth wall (did they ever decide whether or not Pinkie Pie knows?), but how did Gaspode find out in the first place? Was he just there? And once the PPC knew about that, why didn&#39;t they decide to neuralize him? I had an idea for an agent getting in trouble for revealing the existence of the PPC to some <sup>Lyrical</sup> Nanoha^ characters, but I&#39;ve been driving myself crazy trying to figure out why they wouldn&#39;t be able to neuralize them in that situation.

            <p>I find it fun (or well, not <i>fun</i> for the characters, but interesting to us) when the characters have a brief spell of being in-character after exorcism while the agents are wrapping up the details.

            <p>There are a number of different calibers of &quot;awareness&quot;, and most of them would actually be counter-productive to what the PPC tries to do. We protect the plot without forcing ourselves on it, in part because letting the canon characters know of the existence of the multiverse would alter the path of their story and in part because projecting oneself onto a world that was doing fine without you is what the Mary Sues do, and we don&#39;t want any part of that. That&#39;s why we neuralyze people, and why it&#39;s frowned upon for the PPC writers to introduce new characters with knowledge of the multiverse unless there&#39;s a good in-universe reason, i.e. the character in question is omniscient and would know about it anyway. It&#39;s not good for main characters to start expecting and recognizing PPC agents, or it runs the risk of Sueishness. It&#39;s one thing to team up temporarily with a canon character to drive off an intruding presence, and another entirely to start striking up friendships with people from other universes when said other people have their own narratives to attend to.<br><br>The &quot;deja vu&quot; idea is close to one of the passable types of awareness, where a few characters, such as BBC Sherlock, will gain limited knowledge after they have been fully replaced, restricted to the basics like knowing they&#39;ve been separated from their world and shoved in a plothole before, and that someone fixed the problem when they experienced it last time. They do not gain full knowledge of the PPC(though Sherlock occasionally manages to deuce the scope of what it is and what is going on while he&#39;s still in the plothole) in part because the canon snapback will return them to their previous states and in part because they&#39;re neuralyzed to forget any information from accumulating. However, none of the Fellowship apply for that state. It would take a particular mindset, the sort of mind that can prodigiously analyze patterns and simultaneously allow for the most wild of possibilities to be accepted as potential reality, to apply for that state. Hence, BBC Sherlock.<br><br>Some of the Lord of the Rings characters have other states of awareness, with Gimli having a sort of OOC avoidance since the badfic writers tend to ignore him, and Elrond having an active OOC resistance thanks to his ring&#39;s protective magic(by that logic, Gandalf and Galdriel would have it as well, since they have the other rings in Elrond&#39;s set, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s ever been addressed), but neither of those types give the user knowledge of the PPC. They just leave them aware that something strange is going on, and the characters begin to want no part in it despite being forced along in the wake of whatever is corrupting the canon.</p>

            <p>Before the canon snaps back and before they&#39;re neuralyzed, any character affected by the badfic would still remember it. They, especially the main focus of a badfic&#39;s intentions, would be especially aware of what they have just done and why their uncharacteristic behavior ended in those few moments(especially if they were around to watch the Sue-killing and thus can more easily connect the Sue&#39;s death to the fading of their OOC), and I can easily see one of the Fellowship expressing gratitude toward the PPC Agents who freed them from their slavish devotion to a malevolent interloper before they shift back to their canonical selves and the Agents have to make them forget all about their uncanon experiences.<br><br>I thought you were talking about just in general, having one of the Fellowship know about the PPC all the time.

            <p>the SEP field might hide agents from Deadpool simply by making them blend into all the other crazy stuff he&#39;s aware of. With that kind of awareness, the PPC is probably far from the most extreme thing he&#39;s ever experienced.<br><br>If he wanted to mess with other dimensions, he could. There are many other things he could get into, if he wanted to.

            <p>Most fourth wall breakers <i>can</i> see agents. However, this does not mean they know what&#39;s going on. Take, for example, Pinkie Pie. She has minor fourth wall breaking abilities (despite what the fandom will tell you) though she has definitely interacted with the wall before. A few aside glances, massing with the scenery, talking to the audience once or twice, you get the idea. She would be able to see through the SEP field, but not necessarily know who the agents are. To me, this is part of why the agents have to have disguises. They have to hide from those who can see them, beyond uncanon characters. Besides, even if she sees everything, learns what Mary Sues are, and has receved all of the knowledge of the multiverse because <s>Marvin</s> an agent screwed up royally, all the agents have to do is show Pinkie the shiny party favor with the flashy light at the top.<br><br>But, that&#39;s just me. Obviously, if people insist that fourth wall breakers cannot know about the PPC at all, or be able to see agents at all, then that&#39;s fine. That&#39;s just my idea.</p>

            <p>Anything else in the world is more relevant, anything else is more interesting. Like, when you&#39;re going shopping, do you notice a scuff mark on the grocery store floor? Probably not, because the store janitor&#39;s the one who needs to notice that, and you&#39;d be silly to concern yourself with it. And if you do notice it, you might go, &quot;Hmm, they need to clean here,&quot; and immediately forget it. It&#39;s like that, only stronger because the effect is Sufficiently Advanced Technology rather than your own brain judging something to be someone else&#39;s problem.<br><br>Hamlet... whoa. I hadn&#39;t thought of that. I wonder. The play&#39;s been performed in so many ways, from audio drama to live performance to movie adaptation. He does talk directly to the audience in some versions, but it can definitely be interpreted in ways that don&#39;t involve his being actually aware of the audience--like, he&#39;s just using it as a metaphor during his soliloquy; or else he&#39;s just self-centered enough to see himself as the center of the world&#39;s story. Plus, he&#39;s in the same &quot;faking crazy but perhaps really crazy&quot; category as Murdock, isn&#39;t he? But he&#39;s not nearly as nice a person to work with as Murdock is... <br><br>I guess it&#39;s up to the first person to write a mission there, and let&#39;s go with whatever makes the best story!<br><br>Is there Shakespeare fanfic? Yes. It ranges from bad high-school writing assignments to geeky fangirling from English majors, and the quality tends to be better than average, considering that anyone who writes Shakespeare fanfic has generally read Shakespeare.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s external technology, from the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy continuum, and operates by manipulating the subconscious thoughts of those looking at whatever is covered in the field, making any observed see whatever unusual object may be underneath it as Somebody Else&#39;s Problem. Even if they do see the agents, which may be less than likely because anyone from outside canon is shielded from the sight of every canon character by a passive effect that the continuum projects on its inhabitants, whoever sees them will just believe that the presence of two new faces in the crowd is nothing they should bother themselves about, and they&#39;ll quickly forget there was anything unusual at all.<br><br>So, more or less what you already thought. Whatever is under the field doesn&#39;t matter, even if some OC decides to look over and see what all of the shouting and bashing of heads against the nearby walls is all about. PPC Agents tend to make a scene when confronted with the atrocities of badfic. It&#39;s part of why the SEP Fields started being used in the first place.</p>

            <p>Elrond&#39;s resistance comes from his Ring. They don&#39;t have any advantages he doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s just that they haven&#39;t been attacked nearly as much as he has. Gandalf often gets turned into a stupid old man, and Galadriel gets overlooked entirely.<br><br>By the way, an alternate-universe Boromir has joined the PPC as part of Team Phoenix, which is an experimental interdepartmental squad that comes from recruiting Sean Bean characters after their deaths (i.e., after their canons are done with them).

            <p>Right-o.

            <p>Thank you very much :) I was pretty sure there was supposed to be an accent circumflex on &#39;bien sur&#39;, but it was late and spellcheck didn&#39;t highlight it...must be another word without the accent.

            <p>I really want to see a Dexter&#39;s Laboratory/Adventure Time crossover now. The main characters have such contrasting views of reality, and it would be great seeing them interact. Jake and Dee Dee might get along, though. Also, I&#39;d love to see how the magic-saturated land of Ooo would respond to mad science.</p>

            <p>I was wondering if it is okay to write fan fiction for an OFU that already exists. Because it&#39;s not quite like writing a different OFU. And the OFU I had in mind was OFUM, which hasn&#39;t been updated since 2005, and I&#39;ve heard Miss Cam is gone from the internet. And even if she wasn&#39;t, I&#39;d be too scared to ask her.<br><br>Anyway, perhaps explaining my motivations would be in order. What with the last part of The Hobbit coming out, I thought the characters would have something to say about that in the OFUM setting. It wouldn&#39;t be anything huge, just a one-shot or a two-shot or something. Or maybe I shouldn&#39;t write it. Maybe someone else should. But anyway, I think it should be done.<br><br>If anyone knows of a way to contact Miss Cam, maybe she could be imposed upon to write something? Probably not, but a girl can dream, right?<br><br>Anyway, please share your thoughts on this.</p>

            <p>And quite emphatically said that:<br>1) She doesn&#39;t want people to take over writing OFUM for her.<br>2) Borrowing OFUM characters for brief cameos in other stories are okay if used sparingly and credited to her. (for example, see my chapter on crossovers with The Hobbit at MBSFA. I&#39;d link, but I need to go to bed)<br>3) She wants to write a Hobbit special; she&#39;s just really busy with the Once Upon a Time fandom. (Like, really busy. I get notifications from AO3 about her fics all the time.)<br><br>It would just create a lot of weird paperwork and whatnot if someone else takes over a pre-existing OFU. Just take a look at the original BSFA. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve ever recovered from the Course Coordinator handoff.</p>

            <p>I understand why she wouldn&#39;t want other people to take over it, or even do smaller works that take place in it.

Despite being the biggest and most complicated ship in the entire fleet, the love and care of hundreds of engineers have kept the ship-- and the sentient AI named after it-- in tip-top shape over the years. The AI is without a doubt one of the biggest assets of the migrant fleet: its wisdom has guided the Equestrians along every step of their interstellar journey ever since they fled their doomed homeworld. The other main feature of the supercarrier is its Harmonic Ion Cannon-- a devastating anti-electronics weapon capable of taking out a target&#39;s subsystems without directly harming a living creature. When the ship is directly threatened, it can count on its wing of Dragonfire space fighters to deal with the situation. <br><br>Only two Alicorn-class starships were completed before the Great Evacuation: the <i>Celestia</i> and the <i>Luna</i>. Shortly after departure, the <i>Luna</i>&#39;s AI started behaving erratically, shutting down its communication channels, forcing her crew to board the escape pods and jettisoning them into space, and randomly arming and locking its weapons at the other warships in the fleet. A skirmish between the <i>Luna</i> and her sister ship ensued but before the <i>Celestia</i> could bring her Harmonic Ion Cannon to bear on the rogue ship, the <i>Luna</i> fled to warp. When the crew of the <i>Luna</i> was rescued, they reported that someone had sabotaged the AI by introducing a virus into the system. The culprit was never found. <br><br>If recent reports by the <i>Celestia</i>&#39;s elite Wonderbolt scouting squadron can be trusted, the <i>Luna</i> has been spotted several times within several light-years of the fleet.

            <p>The music sounds like something from that show, the main character of Cowboy Bebop was named Spike, and the general style of the video&#39;s narration was similar to that of the anime, so I think it&#39;s the best fit.</p>

            <p>...one could sail <i>East</i> to get to Valinor. Completely confused. On the other hand, the author hadn&#39;t yet read the books when she wrote it, so it makes sense...but it&#39;s still completely weird to me.<br><br>(My first attempts to write in the LotR fandom were...interesting. The Elves were almost all blond, for one thing. Admittedly, it was a parody of sorts ((the story, not the blond Elves o.O)), but...well, it was definitely, er, an interesting exercise.)<br><br>Minis are generally handed out either by OFUs or after the fics they come from have been missioned. Assuming the mini you&#39;re talking about is from one of these badfics, I&#39;m fairly sure the protocol is that you wait until it&#39;s been missioned. You could probably request it in advance, though :)<br><br>Also, hi! Not sure I welcomed you; I vaguely remember seeing your welcome thread, but it was a bit ago and I&#39;m kind of school-swamped (and not in the &#39;Fred and George put a swamp in a corridor&#39; way, either).

            <p>It&#39;s one of the few things that will get me to just not even try to read a story. The people who think you have to go through Fangorn to get to Minas Tirith from Amon Hen, or that there&#39;s this random mountain range north of Eregion (there <i>is</i>, if you go far enough, but the inane AN that said &quot;it&#39;s my fanfic, so I do what I want&quot; effectively convinced me that the author was unaware of this) are just annoying at best, and absolutely infuriating at worst. Maps of Middle-earth are not that hard to get ahold of, and they&#39;re generally a lot easier to read than the average modern road map.<br><br>And the movies made it clear that Valinor was West. I think... Actually, I don&#39;t know if it ever came up in the dialogue, but the credit song for RotK <i>was</i> called &quot;Into the <i>West</i>.&quot;<br><br>Okay, so can I request in advance custody of the mini-Balrog &quot;blibo&quot; on the advent of this story being PPC&#39;d? Do I just watch to see if the story is claimed and ask the claimer?<br><br>Hello! I don&#39;t think you did welcome me before, but now is cool too! Thanks. I know what you mean about the school, in fact I should probably stop this and go do school now. :P But first I will thank you for the lovely gifts. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll come in handy for when actual mountains are misplaced.<br><br>I think I heard somewhere that you live in Canada? How is it up there? Never been there, though I&#39;ve wanted to.</p>

            <p>Traveling here from the Cancelli d&#39;Argenti star system just to pull an April Fools Day prank (at least with the Naomi Atwater story) is truly a feat worthy of a were-penguin/Borg/Time Lord/PPC legend of sorts.

            <p>Do you want the long answer, or the short answer? Short answer: because it&#39;s a funny, well animated and cartoon, with great characters and a vibrant world with tremendous potential for exploration.<br><br>The long answer, however, may take a while. Instead of me going on a rant about the history of the fandom and the reasons why the show is amazing, I&#39;ll just leave a few links to things that may help you understand.<br><br><a href="http://hotdiggedydemon.com/post/16367923346/why-adult-men-like-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic">This</a> is a piece from HotDiggedyDemon, the creator of the infamous PONY.MOV series, explaining (in a way) why he, and others, love this show.<br><br><a href="http://icrontic.com/article/why-grown-ass-men-love-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-so-much">This</a> is another article that gets a little more to the point for why.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7I_IDX98g"> And this</a> is a fan made documentary exploring the previous incarnations of the show, the modern show, the fandom, and how it all ties together. It&#39;s an hour long, but it is well worth your time to watch it.<br><br>However, the best advice for anybody wondering why is to just watch the show. I&#39;m not going to be that guy who says that everybody who watches it must love it. The show is not for everybody, and it is far from perfect, but it is definitely one of the best cartoons airing today. I am also not going to say that you have to watch the entire series before you can pass judgement. I would say, give it five episodes, any order, two-parters only count as one.  After you&#39;ve seen five episodes, then you have a bit of a choice to make. Do you want to keep going, or is this show just not for you? Even if you decide it&#39;s not for you, hopefully you can see why so many people love this show.<br><br>If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, or any other of the (many) pony fans on the board. We are more then happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>

            <p>I sorta like that episode, though Anthony C and Bronycurious <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao9teQKuEo8">kinda ruined it for me. </a> Still, it has some awesome parts in it, and despite the plot holes, it can still be fun.<br><br>If you decide you want to further down the pony path, I have some episodes I could suggest for you. If you want. If you don&#39;t, just watch any of them in any order. However, you may want to watch Magical Mystery Cure before watching any episodes from Season Four. Something happens in that episode that make a main character undergo a rather dramatic change for the rest of the seres. Not that it affects the plot very often, mind you, but it&#39;s still important.</p>

            <p>The Wikipedia article you linked didn&#39;t have anything about Bukit Kepayan, either. So, if that was the phrase that was supposed to key me in, I&#39;m afraid I lack the context to understand it. I&#39;m not even sure if it&#39;s a verb or a noun.<br><br>Also, the Betty Crocker thing was a joke. I had no idea what a Crocker Range was, and the only three Crockers I know about are the famous batterwitch(and in Homestuck, the leader of a species of alien trolls and the instigator of at least two apocalypses), a fairy-obsessed cartoon schoolteacher, and a railroad executive from the 1800s. I thought talking about Betty Crocker would be the best reference. Though, in retrospect, a Dark Lord who rescued his orcs from working at incredibly low wages on an old-timey railroad is also a pretty entertaining idea.</p>

            <p>That would be the guy before me. Which isn&#39;t my ancestor.

I&#39;m not sure if they like my son to inherit the titles they are dead.<br><br>Orcs live in mountains and hills, according to Tolkien, except  in Mordor.

            <p>I am proud to present an animated version of my (Un)Intelligence series! ...or a part of it, at any rate. I&#39;m working on the other episodes.<br><br>Over the past year, I&#39;ve toiled over this project, hoping to make something that the PPC has never had before (I think): a story in animated format. It&#39;s been painstaking work and at times even my computer seemed opposed to the task-- if a catastrophic hard drive failure is any indicator of a machine&#39;s will. Nevertheless, two episodes are done and more are on the way.<br><br>The two episodes have been uploaded to YouTube for your viewing pleasure.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Episode 1</a><br><font color="fdfdfd"><font size="2">APRIL FOOLS!</font></font><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4">Episode 2</a><br><br>Please let me know what you think!<br></p>

            <p>No, seriously, that was great. I really enjoyed it, and while I think that it could have been longer, it was still utterly fantastic. I know I&#39;m not good at giving anything but praise, but bear with me. Please, do. And I really liked it.<br><br><br><br>.....Please be filled, preview box?<br><br>GAH! You disappointed me so much! I was looking at that links, getting all anticipated, and then, well... I&#39;m glad I paused the videos the moment they came on to give them time to load. And then noticed the titles. Gleh.<br><br>But, off topic a bit, but how are those audio projects that got talked about a few months ago coming? I know there were plans to do something with the Continuity Council material, and I&#39;m pretty sure Lily&#39;s Night Vale fusion was going to have something happen to it... I dunno.

            <p>It&#39;ll probably take a while to get it into good shape, but I&#39;m sure it will be worth it in the long run.

            <p>One of her endings is:<br><br>The next day, you turn on the news to hear that Kate and Sean’s friend Jason died in a drunk driving accident. Sean was at the wheel, and he was heavily injured in the crash as well. <br><br>Kate and Jason’s families press charges. Sean is convicted of his DUI and vehicular manslaughter, and faces several years in prison as well as the revocation of his athletic scholarship to the University of Miami. You knew you shouldn’t have let him get into that car drunk, yet at the same time you can’t help but feel like you’ve escaped a greater fate. That suspicious sense that you’re being watched has dropped from your shoulders entirely.<br><br>Weighed down with the grief of what has happened, you visit his cell and return his promise ring. He cries a little, but you’ve figured out by now that sometimes your first love isn’t always going to be your true love. Besides, you’ve got great plans for your future, and you don’t want him stopping you.<br><br>You go up north to play soccer and study English at Penn State. You meet a very pretty girl with long blonde hair named Laurel Greenleaf, and the two of you move to Canada, get married, and live happily ever after*.<br><br>THE END.<br><br>(*Well, as happily ever after as it gets with bills to pay and a cat that keeps on hogging the broken radiator. But it’s much better than the fates you might’ve had in other lives, no?)<br><br>And there&#39;s going to be another one of hers that I&#39;m going to use as the ending for just about every time you play as the Sue and make a decision that gives her character development.<br><br>Basically, I&#39;m going to try and retell the Suefic with the Urple Choices (showing so many other things that the Sue could&#39;ve done with her story that wouldn&#39;t have been as Canon-breaking), and the PPC Mission with the Sunflower Yellow Choices.

            <p>I do recall reading an interview that revealed Ophelia was a genius scientist and one of the playable characters in it because North, and I quote, &quot;wanted her to be rad&quot;. That does sound pretty rad. A Shakespearean lady scientist, or possibly even a lady-scientist, fighting off political intrigue or royal sabotage or assassins lacing poison in everyone&#39;s food. I never read Hamlet, so I have conflicting ideas on what it is about. Pop cultural osmosis is occasionally less than helpful.<br><br>Well, the majority of choose-your-own-adventure books I read in my childhood had at least one ending that came completely out of nowhere, like a baseball diamond being overtaken by carnivorous moss or the playable character being abducted by aliens(I wish I could remember the title of the moss one, so that I could look it up online and show you that I am in no way joking about that), and a single page in the middle of the book that you could only get to by not following any of the paths and just opening the book to that page. Internet choose-your-own-adventure stories usually have the equivalent to the latter buried somewhere in the table of contents, either with a random number if the chapters are numbered or with an unassuming title if they have titles. Any way, I think both would be fun. Plus, the choose-your-own-adventure style means only one path would follow the formula, or possibly two or three since the PPC has a looser idea of what deviation from normal looks like. We could easily end this with Eledhwen fighting the clone of her evil clone on Elrond&#39;s rooftop, or the DIA misinterpreting a radio message someone randomly decided to send and going in to rescue them prematurely, or the Marquis de Sod temporarily re-entering active duty for some off-the-wall reason.<br>You know what would be fun? Completely running with that, and having the opportunity to do something crazy on <i>every page</i>. You could stick to the plan and take charges, you could sneak off to go pick up some new hats that the Sue spawned through poor use of a metaphor, ooor you could steal the Sue&#39;s car and drive it into a swimming pool just to see how the words would react when the Sue has to drive it next.<br><br>The Sue &quot;Rossania the Yellow Istari&quot; has advanced further into Rivendell. What do you do?<br>* Follow her<br>* See if you can nick some of those peanut butter sandwiches from Lindir before the canon removes them<br>* Tackle the Sue&#39;s ex-bodyguard<br>* Seduce Lindir<br>* Recruit the Sue&#39;s ex-bodyguard<br>* Tackle Lindir<br><br>That is probably too many options. The mission would take forever to write if there were more than four per page.<br><br>What were some of the other mission format ideas?</p>

            <p>-lesser-known Canon character being temporarily recruited to work with an Agent in a continuum that isn&#39;t their own.<br>-mission as detective noir piece (I&#39;m considering doing that, for a Sherlock mission)<br><br>...I can&#39;t really remember anything else, but there were several that were thrown around.

            <p>I could tell by the use of &#39;Seduce Lindir.&#39; For those who have never read Brony Hero of Equestria, a reoccurring joke within the story is that you can (try to) seduce anypony you meet. They end with...Interesting results.<br><br>Actually, if it were me, I would not have the main characters be any established agents. If they were previously established, then as a reader, I feel the need to use what I know of the character to influence my actions, rather then what I would do/be funny. Rather, I would have the agent be one of a few things.<br><br>1. A recruited bit character. This way, jokes could be made on how the agent has no personality, and so can do anything the reader wants. A literal blank slate.<br><br>2. A Crash Dummy that came to life. This would allow for heavy lamp shading, as a living You crash dummy is supposed to act as the character in a second-person fic. Now a CYOA story makes more sense, as a living You dummy has to have a narrative involving second person surrounding it.<br><br>3. Both. After all, agents need a partner. In this case, it would make sense for the living You dummy to be the main character, while the bit character is your partner. Occasionally, a prompt can occur that says &quot;Be The Other Guy,&quot; and you can take the role of the partner for a little bit. You can even show this switch further by having the partner&#39;s sections in first person instead of second.&quot;<br><br>Oh, I have an idea for the agent&#39;s names! The sentient dummy is, obviously, You. The bit character is Mia. Probably pronounced me-a.<br><br>Funny as it can be, you need to have some non-insane options for a few pages. Sure, what happens can be insane, but you need a bit of buildup before you can start licking Lindir&#39;s face. Just saying.<br><br>Also, that &quot;You can only get hear by cheating&quot; page? I don&#39;t like it, but if it does exist, there had better be jokes about plotholes and some serious fourth-wall breaking.</p>

            <p>Yue. It&#39;s pronounced a bit more like the solfege note &quot;re&quot;, but with a but of a &quot;oo&quot; sound in between. <br><br>However, according to my sources in ATLA it&#39;s pronounced &quot;you-ay&quot;, and a lot of people in my childhood have pronounced it &quot;you&quot;.

            <p>Now that I have a few minutes to think, I can see how having too many branches and wild actions might either throw people off or derail proper story progression. So, maybe only have the crazier choices available at certain junctions or when they would be funniest or tell the most interesting story. Then, restrict the choice selections a little more than usual during crucial decisions so that it won&#39;t start getting more than the prescribed one or two off-the-wall endings. It&#39;s a choose-your-own-adventure, not a tabletop game. There will have to be limits on individual input, or nothing will make sense after a while.</p>

            <p>I would recommend that you make sure you check up on how, exactly, to write a CYOA. It&#39;s way, WAY harder then it looks. When done right, it&#39;s hilarious. When done wrong, it makes people beyond frustrated. I find <a href="http://onemansponyramblings.blogspot.com/2012/01/6-star-reviews-part-27-part-1-purloined.html">these series of reviews</a> for a CYOA fanfic extraordinarily helpful as a check for how people will receive the story. Now, the fanfic is based on My Little Pony, but the reviews are more based on CYOA as a genre, so it should still be helpful.<br><br>Also, speaking of reviews. You all may have noticed a lack of review on the PPC:TOS from me. Well, as I said, things have been a little hectic recently. I&#39;m hoping to get it out soon, but I am not going to give any form of time frame. At all. Let&#39;s just say, some time before I quit the PPC forever. <br><br></p>
