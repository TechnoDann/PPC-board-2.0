            <p>Uh, hello PPCers. I&#39;m AsbesToast, and I&#39;m new.<br>I&#39;ve read the Constitution and most (if not all,) of the FAQs on the wiki, and as of right now I&#39;m a decent way through the Original Series.<br>I&#39;m a part of the Redwall fandom, the El Goonish Shive fandom, the Elder Scrolls fandom, the Breaking Bad fandom, the Scrubs fandom, the Dexter fandom, and a whole mess of other fandoms to varying degrees.<br>I found the PPC through my brother, Angry Harmonica. Harmonica was reading around on the wiki, and he found a description of the PPC that described the group as writers who &quot;enjoy utilizing their talents for snark, sarcasm, and humor in their writing,&quot; which he felt describes me pretty well, too.<br>I think my favorite spin-off agent is Bryndan Kern, especially partnered with Logan.<br>For fun, I usually just waste time on the internet or play through the mountain of video games I&#39;ve accumulated on Steam over the years.</p>

            <p>Without a doubt, my favorite Redwall book would have to be Lord Brocktree. It was one of the first books I ever read, and I keep on re-reading it to this day. I guess it&#39;s like your first Ghibli film; the first time you experience the magic is almost always your favorite.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the really warm welcome, everyone! As you can see, I survived the tea leaves, and the tea itself was delicious. I had a cup of that along with the popcorn. As far as the urple wristwatch... I can&#39;t even really perceive it yet, but thank you! I&#39;m sure the honking messenger pigeon will come in handy, and the protective eye-wear already helped me overcome the tea leaves. Thanks again, everyone!</p>

            <p>Yes, another trailer discussion. We seem to be swimming in those recently!

And, hey, by the way, both those previous threads are still on the front page if you feel like chiming in. ^_^<br><br>So: the trailer for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOVFvcNfvE">Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens</a> is out. A year in advance, so they weren&#39;t kidding when they called it a tease... sorry, I mean teas<b>er</b>.<br><br>And... well, on the one hand, I&#39;m still mourning the death of the Expanded Universe. What, it&#39;s 30 years on and there&#39;s still X-Wings in common use? <i>TIE fighters</i>? By 30ABY we should be in the Galactic Alliance era, with the Incom T-65 X-wing basically obsolete, and the TIE/LN a hilariously outdated deathtrap. I mean, okay, they were still <i>around</i>, but they should be pretty rare.<br><br>And, yeah, big woo, back to Planet Dustbowl, because we&#39;re not tired of that place yet. And that astromech is hilariously useless - as is &#39;stick some parts on your lightsaber to chop your fingers off if your hand slips&#39;.<br><br>But.<br><br>But but but.<br><br>X-wings! TIE fighters! The <i>Falcoln</i>! Outdoor environments not made out of pixels (seriously, I think the last time we saw a real tree in <i>Star Wars</i> was Endor)! Aerial acrobatics! <i>X-wings in ground attack mode</i> (seriously, you have no idea how cool I thought that shot was)! And, y&#39;know - <i>Star Wars</i>!<br><br>They&#39;re not going to get me to buy the merchandise for the new continuity - which is a shame for them, since I own practically every book from the old EU. But they&#39;re also not going to be able to stop me seeing the film.<br><br>Here&#39;s hoping there&#39;s no replacement Jar Jar...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>While the best thing to use for blocking a lightsaber is another lightsaber, they aren&#39;t exactly common or easy to use. Cortosis blocks lightsabers or shuts them off on contact, and would have made much more sense to use than the weird lightsaber cross guard thing going on, especially since it would be less likely to slice your own head off in a saber lock. Whether cortosis even exists anymore since the EU was neutered is the question, though. Rule of Cool &gt; combat pragmatism/usability.</p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Lightsaber.png"><br><br>Wikipedia (The Source Of All Knowledge) is rather vague on the purpose of a cross-guard, which is what this clearly is. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilt#Guard">hilt</a> article suggests at two:<br><br>-Protecting the hand from a blade &#39;deliberately slid down the length of the blade to cut off or injure the hand&#39;.<br>-Preventing the hand from &#39; slipping up the blade when thrusting&#39;.<br><br>How does the new saber do at this? It would work for the first instance, and is one of the few things that would - but you&#39;ve already mentioned saber locks; I don&#39;t recall ever seeing lightsabers sliding along each other. It seems like the interaction between two blades causes a &#39;lock&#39; that can&#39;t be broken by sliding - which means that purpose of a crossguard is void. And anyway, if the enemy&#39;s blade slid down, it would hit the cross-emitter and cut it off, rather than jumping out to the blade.<br><br>As for the second purpose - well, it <i>would</i> stop your hand slipping onto the blade, but only by cutting it off before it got there. It looks like the crossguard emitters could be long enough that you only scorch your fingers, rather than severing them - but that still makes the crossblades a liability, not an asset. Just have the inert part!<br><br>Wikipedia also mentions that &#39;Only with the abandonment of the shield and then the armoured gauntlet did a full hand guard become necessary&#39;. Since Jedi and Sith use neither of these, a full hand-guard <i>would</i> be appropriate - but this isn&#39;t one.<br><br>Okay, but lightsaber blades aren&#39;t just defensive - they can be used to attack, as well. Could you use the crossblades as a sort of Sith knuckleduster? Erm... I guess. But, again, this is a <i>lightsaber</i> - the blade is lethal from all angles. Why bother with a punch to make a small hole when you could turn your hand and stick a meter of coherent light through your opponent?<br><br>So, really, I can&#39;t find a <i>practical</i> use for the thing, which means it&#39;s just down to whether you think it looks cool. Which, personally, I don&#39;t. I love the actual effect used on the blades, but the cross-guard? Strikes me as silly, not cool. Of course, others may disagree, which is entirely your choice. ;)<br><br>(It may be significant to note that no-one in the history of weapons has thought sticking knives onto the hilt of their sword was a good idea)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>On a Jedi, everything about the cross-guard being a defensive idea makes sense. The Jedi like defensive fighting, so a defensive cross guard makes sense for them. However, it would make much more sense for the cross guard to be made out of Beskar or Cortosis, since those can take a lightsaber hit.<br><br>However, this is a Sith. And Sith are known for their aggressive offense. This gives the Sith another way to hit you, and pommel-strikes aren&#39;t exactly uncommon in Star Wars. Making the pummel strike more than a stunning attack would perfectly fit with the offensive combat style of the Sith.<br><br>On the other hand, this lightsaber is clearly a broadsword in size, as it&#39;s HUGE. This makes another possibility: The small blades are meant for very close in work. The biggest weakness of large weapons is that once an opponent gets too close, they are in your guard and there is nothing you can really do about it. The blade simply can&#39;t build up the momentum for power attacks or other Sith combat techniques. The small blades on the hilt would give the Sith the ability to engage at that distance. Not a perfect fix, but it is enough to partially negate the main weakness of massive blades.</p>

            <p>The lightsaber is huge, true enough - but it&#39;s <i>one huge cutting edge</i>. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you swing the tip at half the speed of sound, or simply bump the emitter up against someone - when it comes to living things, a lightsaber simply goes through without stopping.<br><br>That&#39;s weird, I know; it&#39;s not something we have an equivalent to in the real world. But slapping the big blade up against someone right up close isn&#39;t going to slow it down, or make it difficult to control - from everything we&#39;ve seen in the films, it&#39;ll just go straight through. And I&#39;d much rather slice my close-quarters opponent in half than stick a tiny, probably-non-lethal hole in him.<br><br>To pick a single example: the cross-guard can put your enemy&#39;s eye out. In exactly the same amount of time and with exactly the same amount of effort, the main blade can bisect his head. This is like... like fixing a catapult to the top of your sniper rifle &#39;because catapults have shorter range&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>True, the lightsaber can cut t any speed, but the concept of power attacks and that style of melee isn&#39;t based around speed to aid in cutting. A power attack is meant to hit the opponent&#39;s blade, so they can shatter the defense. Think Episode 6, when Luke repeatedly beats Vader&#39;s defense down with two-handed strikes. <br><br>And this point of the long blade, that I was making earlier, is that the length makes it more difficult to maneuver, which in close combat could be a deadly issue. It that situation, rather than adding a catapult to a sniper, it&#39;s like adding a bayonet to a sniper so you can use it effectively at stabbing ranges.</p>

            <p>I agree that the long blade will aid in power strikes, which is very Sith, but I&#39;m still not convinced the little ones will help in close combat. How is the long blade difficult to maneuver? It <i>cuts through anything</i>. It&#39;s literally point-and-slice. Sure, you might damage a few things on the way, but by then your opponent is dead meat.<br><br>Furthermore, it&#39;s... it&#39;s still there anyway. If you&#39;re trying to hit someone with the cross-guard, you&#39;re swinging the main blade around while you do it. In fact, it&#39;s <i>exactly</i> like fitting a bayonet to a rifle - when you have unlimited bullets and no problems with recoil or anything. Since the bayonet is fixed in place, <i>anything you kill with it is equally killable with a bullet</i>. Same thing here.<br><br>I may be wrong. But I honestly can&#39;t come up with a scenario in which using the little crossblades would be in any way better than using the large one. A lightsaber blade is massless, it has no momentum - unless you&#39;re fighting two opponents, have let one lock your blade, and the other one&#39;s diving right in your face (in which case you have bigger problems, frankly), I can&#39;t see them as in any way useful.<br><br>And, like I said - no one has <i>ever</i> sharpened their cross-guard. I&#39;m thinking there&#39;s a reason for that.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: But please do prove me wrong. I&#39;d actually <i>like</i> this to be a well thought-through design, strange though that may seem. ^_~</p>

            <p>A specific scenario I can come up with off the top of my head is blocking with this blade, then twisting so that you can bring the hilt in for a pommel strike. It&#39;s a common enough move, and a favorite of Darth Malgus from SWTOR. With a move like that, it would be a simple enough matter, especially with the extra length from this blade, to strike with a point further up the hilt, like the crossguard. Considering that there are Sith weapons with blade cross-guards already (Darth Malgus&#39; blade comes to mind), it&#39;s entirely possible that the lightsaber cross-guard was an evolution of that.<br><br></p>

            <p>Of course, given that there&#39;s a full cross-bar, you run the risk of them knocking it back towards you. That sounds like the sort of move that would be done right up close, so you&#39;ve got a real chance of being impaled on your own blade. Seems like it would make more sense to just have one...<br><br>Either way, I&#39;m going to make a prediction: the crossguard will be used precisely once in the film, to catch a blow that he should by rights have caught on the main blade. Then it will be completely ignored even when it might be useful, and will never be at risk of harming anyone. Because they just made it to look cool.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think that these cross-guard blades could serve two important functions.<br><br>1) Imagine, for a moment, that you are a Jedi.  You are moving through this forest, aware that Sith are around.  You come around a tree and this guy is standing in front of you.  You draw your lightsaber and activate it.  He activates his completely ordinary, if a little long and thin, saber.  You can handle this, no problem.  And then he activates the cross-guard.  You&#39;ve never seen something like that before.  How does he use those blades?  Are they defensive or offensive?  How do you counter them?<br><br>He has the advantage because this new variable puts his opponent off balance.  There is something to be said for having dangerous looking decorations.<br><br>2) We have been thinking of the lightsaber solely as a melee weapon, and I think that is a mistake.  The lightsaber throw is a time-honored tradition, after all.  So, what happens if you throw a regular saber?  There is a good chance that your enemy gets the blade to their face and dies.  All well and good.  What happens if the hilt hits them?  They get a lump on their head and keep fighting.  So, these cross-guard blades potentially increase your chance to deal real damage with a saber toss.  They also make it less likely that a Jedi is going to pluck your whirling saber out of the air and toss it back.<br><br><br>Anyway, those are a couple of the ideas that I&#39;ve had.<br><br>-Phobos, who actually likes the design, if for no other reason than aesthetics.</p>

            <p>I was thinking of the cross guard as a saber throw tool - it would allow for hits at different angles. Alternatively, the smaller blades could be used for precision cutting of objects (though a fusion cutter would work just as well). Personally, I think the cross guard blades would best be used as a last resort or surprise weapon, nothing more.<br><br>Oh, and I came across an album of more pragmatic lightsaber techniques.

            <p>Looking at those, I see several that actually have been used places before, like the Viper&#39;s Tongue. However, a lot seem to require your opponent being foolish, or fail to consider the fact that your opponent is likely Force sensitive as well. Also, all of the ones that ask for precision force pulls and pushes fail to consider exactly how difficult such moves are. In the movies, Jedi can quickly do mass pushes, but it takes time and concentration to summon things like lightsabers back to their hands.<br><br>Honestly, when I see assumptions about using the Force on Jedi in combat, I get slightly annoyed. Jedi have Force barriers, mental defenses they erect with the Force to defend against Force attacks. It&#39;s the reason why all of Vader&#39;s fights aren&#39;t simply him choking the other Jedi to death.<br><br>That being said, I did like the Dewback Tail.</p>

            <p>The &quot;force barrier&quot; concept is vital, and would definitely protect from a number of these techniques. I do think the ability of a lightsaber to near-instantly expand and retract is underutilized, though - it might be boring to watch, but fights would be much more cerebral with anticipating when the blade might not be there.</p>

            <p>... that lightsabers tend to be used as if they were normal swords: they&#39;re swung as if they had weight, and remain on at all times. Really, you&#39;d think after a thousand generations, the Jedi would&#39;ve come up with some new techniques.<br><br>Of course, for large chunks of those, lightsaber-on-lightsaber combat was vanishingly rare. The only purpose of it was in non-combat duels, which serve either as training or to impress the yokels. So I guess they may have artificially kept it sword-like in order to make themselves look more impressive? It also makes it easy to tell who &#39;wins&#39;, whereas if you&#39;re flicking the thing on and off all the time, it&#39;s difficult to say unless you actually kill someone. Which wouldn&#39;t go down too well with the public.<br><br>Doesn&#39;t excuse the Sith, though - but come to think of it, haven&#39;t most of the innovative sabers been Sith inventions? The double-bladed variant, Dooku&#39;s curved hilt, the lightwhip... it&#39;s surprising really that the dual-phase saber was invented by a Jedi (though the Corellian Jedi were something of a force of their own anyway).<br><br>Oh, and on the subject of lightsaber variants: <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Crossguard_lightsaber">apparently</a> the idea of sticking a (single) crossguard-type blade on your hilt has already been tried. That looks much more useful than the full-cross variant...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;m gonna address each point you made about the trailer.<br><br>On X-Wings and TIE fighters:<br><br>The X-wing was an impressive workhorse. Even if it was rendered obsolete, it was still impressive in combat, and would take quite a long time to phase out of action. While thirty years seems a bit high, the fact that we know little about the current situation in the galaxy means it may still be the most useful craft. Or, alternatively, the X-Wings shown belonged to the system defense forces on whichever planet that was. <br><br>As for TIE fighters, the empire never cared if something was a deathtrap as long as it could do it&#39;s job. For the TIE, it was to be cheap to produce, easy to train for, and moderately effective in combat. It is entirely possible that the newer and rarer models, such as the Interceptor and the Phantom, were too expensive for the mass production required to phase out the standard TIE.<br><br>On Planet Dustbowl:<br><br>Ok, yeah. I&#39;ll admit we&#39;ve spent way too much time there, provided this is Tatooine we&#39;re looking at.<br><br>The Astromech is simply amusing. Though it&#39;s design doesn&#39;t seem very useful, it seems like it would be much better suited for the desert than a standard R2 unit. I would assume there are some features or legs built in, similar to the Droideka Design.<br><br>And the lightsaber. I&#39;m not gonna lie, I love that lightsaber. I haven&#39;t seen a blade so fitting for a Sith in a long time. The blade itself is long, granting reach and advantage for Power Attacks. It isn&#39;t built for defense, but Sith don&#39;t really consider defense that often, so no real loss there. The crossguard falls into the same situation. It isn&#39;t meant for blocking, or deflecting attacks. It&#39;s meant to give the Sith another angle to kill you with. Pommel strikes are already a common thing in lightsaber combat, so adding an additional blade or two to take advantage isn&#39;t an issue. <br><br>I&#39;ll be honest, this trailer sent my inner nerd into a frenzy of excitement, which was it&#39;s job. </p>

            <p>For comparison&#39;s sake, see <a href="http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080921030840/starwars/images/e/e1/X-wing_schematics.png">this diagram</a>... They&#39;ve clearly upgraded the S-foils and nosecone, and the cockpit geometry looks different as well. This looks a lot like either a new version entirely (like the Super Hornets mentioned earlier) or a heavy incremental upgrade - with new avionics, flight controls, and engines, even a thirty-year-old spaceframe could be quite the contender.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s do a comparison image, shall we?<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/X-wings-1.png"><br><br>You&#39;re right about the S-foils - the bottom one in particular is really narrow now, and it looks to me like they&#39;re designed to lie side-by-side, instead of on top of each other. That would give a slimmer profile, and reduce the chance of the wing getting shot off while in flight position.<br><br>The nosecone, too - the new version is much more streamlined. Not sure about the cockpit - it <i>looks</i> slimmer and/or longer, but that might be perspective.<br><br>And the biggest difference - where&#39;s the astromech? It should be clearly visible right behind the cockpit, but I can&#39;t see hide nor, uh, wire of it. Is there a new, low-profile droid back there? Has it been shifted backwards? Or have they removed it altogether?<br><br>But why stop there? Let&#39;s look at the inside of that cockpit.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/X-wingCockpit.png"><br><br>(Hi, Wedge!)<br><br>It looks like there are at least cosmetic tweaks to the cockpit design after all - those angled rear windows aren&#39;t in the old T-65. And they&#39;ve cleared out all those pipes from Wedge&#39;s day - possibly because the new shot was taken in atmosphere? I think they&#39;ve also widened the cockpit, but not made it taller - the struts in the new one are angled slightly more from the vertical. They look thicker, too.<br><br>It also looks like the pilot sits lower down with respect to the windows - Wedge&#39;s shoulders would be visible from outside, whereas the new guy&#39;s wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>All in all, there <i>have</i> been some redesigns - though whether they&#39;re a major shift in the way X-wings are built, or simply the New Republic trying to pretend it&#39;s doing <i>something</i> (sort of like car companies keep redesigning their cars to be identical but different), I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Anyone want to pull up a comparison of the <i>Falcoln</i> and see whether Han and Chewie have made any upgrades? Or, the really big one - those TIEs? ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What really frustrated me when I read this nightmare of a wish-fulfilling &quot;story&quot; is the waste of good ideas.<br><br>Although he still loves Ginny, Harry has to marry another woman, because (insert believable magical reason that cannot easily be overcome here); how will Harry, Ginny and the OC deal with this? But the Sue had to remove any potential conflict by pretending that Ginny cheated on Harry, and she is probably under the illusion that she doesn’t still need to come up with a good reason for this marriage when Harry is single again.<br><br>James survived Lily’s death and still doesn’t look like the jerk he appeared to be in Severus Snape’s memory because (insert plausible escape story here); how does he cope with the loss, and how will his survival influence Harry’s life? But the Sue just wanted Harry’s daddy back and removed at least half of his redeeming qualities by not telling us the back story.<br><br>Sirius had a pregnant wife, or a wife and a small child, when he volunteered to be the Secret Keeper; how did his daring actions affect his family? (Alternatively, Sirius found love when he was on the hunt for Wormtail, it depends on how old his son is supposed to be.) But the Sue just wanted to make Sirius happy after resurrecting him for no apprehensible reason. (Her main story could easily be told without involving Sirius, and without involving James.)<br><br>Since he couldn’t find any other place to live in, Remus moved in with his best friend’s son; the Dursleys are not amused when he tries to take in his uncanonical daughter. But the Sue became distracted before she could be introduced to the landlord. <br><br>The forbidden love between a Metamorphmagus and a Quileute tribe person creates a shape shifter of capabilities never seen before; can she integrate in either society? This <i>Twilight</i> crossover is farfetched, but it is still more plausible than making Teddy Tonks female, old enough to marry Harry, able to metamorph into a big guy twice her weight and capable of transforming into cats of any size. Being something like the American third cousin once removed of Remus Lupin’s canonical wife (there has to be another Metamorphmagus in her family) would still be sufficient to meet Harry and become involved into the main plot.<br><br>Instead of all the plausible potential conflicts we get<br>•    the Sue staring down Dudley for a perceived insult, when she should be glad that somebody already realized that she has to be Harry’s girlfriend and future wife;<br>•  some random gangsters who don’t look like Death Eaters trying to torture Harry’s whereabouts out of James and Sirius when Harry isn’t actually difficult to find;<br>•  and a potentially evil stepmother-to-be coming out of the blue to take the Sue to the hospital when she should be capable to go there on her own  <br><br>Gaah, I’m overanalyzing this mess, and that’s far less funny than your mission.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Well.  You found yourself an interesting little fic there, didn&#39;tcha?<br><br>Firstly, I love this sentence:<br><br><i>It looked vaguely like a street, if someone described a street to a blind man so he could draw said street with a broken pencil held in his non-dominant fist before proceeding to erase his work.</i><br><br>This is now officially my favorite description of generic, un-described fic space ever.<br><br>And I guess I semi-agree with others that this one got a little MST-like, but really, the fic speaks for itself, so that was probably the most efficient way to write this.  (&quot;Ha ha, I&#39;m the daughter of a werewolf and my name is &#39;wolves&#39; spelled backwards, and I turn into CAAAAAATS.&quot;)<br><br>And I <s>love</s> no, that&#39;s the wrong word for this situation.  I . . . am amused by the way you made the &quot;loin&quot; thing look like it was just a one-of joke, but then spring it on the agents later in the worst possibly way.  You handled it in a simple, discreet way that was simultaneously hilarious and horrifying.<br><br>So good work dealing with something unusually bizarre!</p>

            <p>When you browse older fanfics, you can find some horrifying stuff lost to memory. Of course, I didn&#39;t find any minis in my fic.<br><br>Anyway! For our upcoming collab, do you have a particular fic in mind? I checked out Cori Falls&#39; stories and my god I wanted to jump off a bridge. Also, do you have anything in particular you wanted to do for the interlude?</p>

            <p>Apologies for taking so long to reply, I&#39;ve been under the weather recently and research is becoming heavy near the end of term.<br><br>Anyway, yeah, I feel you on the old fics and stuff. Which reminds me - the Cori Falls fics I wish to tackle are the two about the Articuno for the first act, &quot;How James Got His Mojo Back&quot; as a worse example for the second act, and maybe partway through New Directions for the third act before the agents step in. We may end up doing a lot of scene-cutting and singling out the worst parts, of course - these fics are often ridiculously long, even without the urple prose. We can continue this discussion via e-mail, since I also plan to PM you the bio for my new trainee for evaluation as well.<br><br>And I&#39;ve already set up the first part of the interlude. We should be good to go from there!<br></p>

Or just, y&#39;know, keeping an eye on them in general.<br><br>It&#39;s important to remember that Selene is an <i>incredibly</i> biased observer here.

            <p>So. This:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/BoardDecember14.png"><br><br>The people on the PPC Board are brilliant, and our posts/person (not shown) has actually gone up slightly of late. But... there&#39;s not very many of us (about 50, last month). And my feeling is that it&#39;s because we&#39;re not that easy to find.<br><br>So I propose that we remedy that by posting some of our missions where people can easily find them. I already started that with <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/1/PPC-Driftwood">PPC: Driftwood</a>, and now I propose a new series - <i>Welcome to the PPC</i>.<br><br>The concept for WPPC consists of people volunteering their old missions to be posted on FF.net. The mission would be credited to you, and posted in either a disposable account, or under my SturmUndSquee name. For instance, if I was volunteering <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12D2DmSZCDJ73qVYlw84vK5USwi80GgjA5DmMBaQWT2M/pub">Of Wolves and Fellowship</a>, it would go up under the title <i>Welcome to the PPC: Agent Huinesoron</i>, with a blurb something like this:<br><br><i>From the archives of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum. Agents Huinesoron and Kaitlyn demonstrate that turning Pippin into a werewolf just isn&#39;t worth the trouble.</i><br><br>Inside, there would be a headnote disclaimer saying: <i>This mission was written by Huinesoron of the PPC, and is posted here with permission from the author.</i> You&#39;d also have a full disclaimer at the end, disclaiming all the canons, the mission again, and the badfic, as well as a note saying <i>If you&#39;d like to read more about the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, search for us on Google!</i> or somesuch.<br><br>And that&#39;s basically it. By posting the missions separately, they can be in the right canons, and by only posting one mission per team, we&#39;re sticking to the &#39;Welcome...&#39; theme, rather than just saying &#39;post your stuff on FF.net&#39;. If one of them gets taken down, it&#39;s no big deal - they&#39;re all hosted elsewhere anyway.<br><br>The only real restrictions on what you could volunteer would be the FF.net TOS (no script format, no NC-17, not previously posted on FF.net), and the common-sense aspect of &#39;don&#39;t put in something that relies on reading your other missions&#39;. It should be a mission that someone browsing FF.net can find, read, and enjoy - and then maybe decide to come to the Board and join in the fun.<br><br>So what do people think? It seems like it would draw in at least a few of our traditional demographic, &#39;people who read fanfic&#39;, which is always a good thing; and in the event that the newcomers don&#39;t fit in, they&#39;ll just, y&#39;know, leave. It does run the risk of attracting flames, and potentially even an irate Suethor visit to the Board - but we can handle that and laugh about it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Does it have to be FF.net?<br><br>By that I mean does the &#39;Welcome&#39; series have to be posted to the Pit, I understand its the largest fan fiction website out there and stuff, but do we necessarily want to put the PPC out there on it in a more visible way. I know there aren&#39;t exactly that many websites out there that allow fan fiction, but maybe we could trial run this on a slightly smaller website (the one that springs to mind as I write this is AO3), that may be slightly more lax in terms of rules (meaning that we don&#39;t have to worry about format or where it was posted before), and perhaps have a better and more fair admin team that will accommodate something like this a lot more easily than the admins at FF.net could. <br><br>It&#39;s just a thought that I had and wondered if there was anything in it that could help with the general idea.<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>But I understand what you&#39;re saying. The thing is... well, two things:<br><br>1/ The whole purpose of this is to make the PPC more visible. Historically - not recently, but <i>historically</i> - our membership was all from FF.net. I was. My wife was. Uh, Jay and Acacia were. It&#39;s where the PPC started out - and we get good people through there. Even in Days of Yore, though, what we never <i>did</i> get was a flurry of flamers coming from there to here. It just didn&#39;t happen.<br><br>2/ I think you&#39;ve got the FF.net/AO3 distinction backwards. Fanfic.net is pretty lax about its rules, and very lax about enforcing them. AO3 seems more organised - which, if they decide PPC stories are against their TOS, is a <i>bad</i> thing. And they potentially could: they have a section about &#39;plagiarism&#39;, which we don&#39;t seem to fit, but also a section on &#39;harassment&#39; which starts as follows:<br><br><i>Harassment is any behavior that produces a generally hostile environment for its target. This includes activities such as bullying and hazing by groups of people as well as personal attacks by individuals.</i><br><br>Which could easily be construed to include the PPC, particularly since it does <i>not</i> say it only covers personal attacks. Sustained criticism of your work could very well count as a &#39;hostile environment&#39;.<br><br>Unfortunately, AO3 don&#39;t specifically mention MSTs in their description; does anyone know whether they allow them? In fact, does anyone know if they allow PPC stories in general?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And semi-hypocritically, the current fandom scene that is largely on AO3 is against even the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot; being used. <br><br>AO3 is fairly active right now but I wouldn&#39;t say that translates to more strict but I suspect the PPC would be largely unwelcome there by some louder voices who wouldn&#39;t be afraid of reporting missions. </p>

            <p>I&#39;d be more inclined to the opposing view, since if you&#39;re feeling lazy, you would decapitalise (as many internet folks do everywhere), but it&#39;s hard to imagine what would make you randomly capitalise.

            <p>Or, at least, if I&#39;m not taking some regional thing into account, it&#39;s only because I don&#39;t know about it. As far as hyphens vs. dashes, people online have several different ways of substituting for dashes using hyphens, and &quot;space hyphen space&quot; is one of &#39;em. If you properly want &quot;space en-dash space&quot; rather than an em-dash, that&#39;s fine by me, but it&#39;s a little hard to tell just by looking. Since you pointed it out to me, I&#39;ve stuck with &quot;space en-dash space&quot; for your pages. Also, I added a note about it in the editing help page just a couple days ago while I was making updates regarding the new VisualEditor, so there. {; P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

It&#39;s their first actual crossover, it stands on its own better than their later missions, and while it&#39;s on the dramatic side, it&#39;s not Bleepfic.

Also, this gives me time to update the Songbook section of my site to CSS.

            <p>Doc has noted his preference for keeping us as out of the eye of anywhere else as possible before, such as here: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=259289"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=259289">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=259289</a></a> (I forgot how to link on yourwebapps :( )<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not worried what other people might think of us, I&#39;m worried that they might think of us at all.&quot;<br><br>Like I said, about halfway through I started worrying that it sounded like I was unfairly taking him to task, which is why I tried to stress that I&#39;m not personally going after him here. It&#39;s just that &quot;let&#39;s stay totally isolationist&quot; seems to be his recurring stance and he tends to jump to the absolute worst case as if it&#39;s a given, and I don&#39;t feel that is a healthy attitude to take to the PPC. We can&#39;t put the entire community into a bottle and never try to expand just because bad things <i>might</i> happen, and I&#39;ll admit that I think I misunderstood part of his original post, which is why I made that &quot;museum exhibit&quot; comment. &quot;Before I have the chance to archive it&quot; read to me as &quot;what matters is my archive&quot; which was completely unfair, and I apologise for that.</p>

            <p>And I only bring it up when it&#39;s relevant to the conversation.  If no one else in the PPC agrees with me, that&#39;s fine, and I&#39;ll go with the group decision.

They aren&#39;t just stories, they&#39;re my memories, my adventures, part of my life.  I don&#39;t want to lose them, because I might want to read them again decades from now, and remember.  The difference there is that, while the published books in my house have numerous copies throughout the world, fanfiction only exists online, and once it disappears, if some archive didn&#39;t pick it up (and thank Gan for them when they do!), they really are gone for good.  I&#39;m still kicking myself for not thinking about starting an archive until after Pigeon Army&#39;s spin-off was deleted, because that one doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s coming back.<br><br>I feel like I&#39;ve gone on an overly poetic tangent.  I&#39;m just trying to say that the PPC canon is something I very much care about, and I feel protective of it.  Again, I&#39;ll <i>speak</i> my mind, but I won&#39;t try to <i>shout</i> down the entire community, if it reaches a collective decision.</p>

            <p>To carry on with the bookshelves comparison, not everyone who would learn your books exist would want to burn them. If you were a librarian, would you bar the doors except to those you knew personally, because everyone else is guilty until proven innocent of wanting to destroy it all? The rest of the internet aren&#39;t necessarily barbarians at the gates, and while I agree that holding fire on this project until we&#39;ve made sure the remaining old stuff is safe from potential backlash is the way to go, I do think you&#39;re being a little (for lack of a better word, and I don&#39;t mean it as an insult) paranoid. <br><br>Keep in mind too that &quot;PPC canon&quot; is a) a veritable Gordian Knot at times, b) reasonably well documented (by which I don&#39;t mean &quot;oh, we&#39;ve done all the work already&quot; - I mean &quot;we&#39;ve done a good job so far of making sure the important stuff is preserved) and c) not something you are solely responsible for, given others are curating it as well and everyone doing it is doing a fine job. And remember, you&#39;re not exactly guarding the Holy Grail from the heathen hordes here. I guess where I&#39;m coming from is I don&#39;t think looking at people Not From Here as inherent threats/enemies is a good view to take, especially on something like the PPC - I respect that you&#39;re not shouting people down, and I&#39;m not trying to shout <i>you</i> down, I&#39;m just noting why I respectfully disagree and think you should consider being a little more open to the whole idea. I mean, really, worst case scenario a few flames get sent our way and we handle it like we&#39;ve handled trolls, flamers, etc. in the past.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m really sorry about Acacia&#39;s name; I honestly had no idea that was the real one.  I honestly thought that was just another internet name, because I always saw it paired with Otik, which very clearly is not Jay&#39;s real name.  So I&#39;m very, very sorry, and I say thankya for correcting me.  I&#39;ll make sure not to do that again.  <i>goes to change info in the archive</i><br><br>Um.  Is it really <i>draining</i> our membership?  I mean, we may not be matching our top membership record, we may even be at our <i>low</i> membership record, but fifty people is still quite a lot of minds.  I&#39;m not sure we could even fit the whole current set of active users in my condo and still have room to walk around each other!  And the number could always fluctuate up again in the future.<br><br>That would be fantastic!  The Pit was my next priority after getting all the Webs/Freewebs sites archived, but my free time is in high demand.  I don&#39;t have any special list; I&#39;ve just been using the Complete List of PPC Fiction on the Wiki and mousing down the names to look at the URLs.  (I&#39;ve also found one or two unlisted ones by playing with the search function on the Pit; perhaps you can get more creative with it than I could?)<br><br>Well, there&#39;s been at least one admin that once attempted to do their job.  I remember a couple of years ago, I checked through the links on our unclaimed badfic list, and discovered that a huge number of the really grody, yucky, why-did-this-need-to-be-written stories on the Pit had gotten axed.  I guess I got it in my mind that things were getting more competent around there, but I suppose one data point isn&#39;t enough to assume that . . .<br><br>Well, thanks for your response, and your offer to help!</p>

            <p>A year or so ago, I had randomly gotten it in my head to put all her links in order on the wiki, so it&#39;s going by fairly quickly now.  IndeMaat&#39;s LiveJournal and her site proper gave different orders, but I think I went with the official site&#39;s order, just &#39;cause.  The one tricky thing is that some versions have different combinations and different orders of author note, so in some cases, I have to compare each posting of each mission to get each version.  But the missions themselves have been constant, as far as I can tell.  I&#39;ve also encountered one mission so far that&#39;s no longer posted anywhere but once I know for sure how many are missing, I&#39;ll email her and ask if she has any backed up.<br><br>So, uh, thanks, past!doctorlit, for organizing those for me.</p>

            <p>Obviously everyone has missions which draw heavily on their predecessors - things like Lou&#39;s big reveal, or Dafydd&#39;s second teamup with Vemi - but equally, I think most teams have the &#39;monster of the week&#39; type of missions. Yes, they don&#39;t serve as a technical intro to the characters - but they still work fine as a standalone. <i>Of Wolves</i> fits that description, for instance.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...most of my finished and posted missions are either interludes, for the Blackout, or April Fool&#39;s Day things. I have one that I wrote a huge chunk on for NaNoWriMo, which I&#39;m happy to contribute once it&#39;s finished, but apart from that, everything is either not a mission, not a serious mission, or simply not posted. <br><br>So I guess now the main questions are as follows:<br><br>1. Are you looking for anything other than straight missions? Would interludes/Ten Years Later stories/AFD &#39;joke&#39; missions/an excerpt of a Blackout Interlude also be acceptable/useful?<br><br>2. Until when are you accepting contributions to this? Is it to be an ongoing thing, or just during a specific time frame?<br><br>3. Assuming an author has written different missions with different combinations of characters (take you, for example, with missions for Dafydd and also missions for Agent hS), would you want them submitting only one mission or multiple ones, with the caveat that no one agent team is featured more than once?<br><br>4. Not exactly a question per se, but I&#39;m assuming it would be good if this series ended up featuring many different departments? Something featuring the Flowers could also be good...<br><br>I think that&#39;s everything for now, so I&#39;ll end this here and get ready for class. I would like to add, though, that I think this is an absolutely <i>brilliant</i> idea.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>1/ Most of those probably wouldn&#39;t work, because they&#39;re not fanfic of something with an FF.net section. The AFD joke mission would, potentially; bits of a Blackout Interlude would depend. For instance, Cyba&#39;s <i>Knightmare</i> interlude would work fine; Lily&#39;s <i>Generic Surface</i> probably wouldn&#39;t, since the <i>Doctor Who</i> elements are fairly minor.<br><br>2/ I figured ongoing. And in case it wasn&#39;t clear, I&#39;m not claiming a monopoly - anyone is absolutely welcome to stick up their own disposable account and post under the WPPC banner.<br><br>3/ Multiple is absolutely fine; I just don&#39;t want people using WPPC to post their entire back-catalogue. Though, as with <i>Driftwood</i>, people posting their entire back-catalogue as their own story is absolutely fine by me.<br><br>4/ Different departments, different fandoms - all sorts of differents. And that&#39;s not an answer, but it wasn&#39;t a question anyway. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The luchador was in the Mexico City photograph. It&#39;s alright, the ending was meant to be a bit cryptic and make more sense on a subsequent read.<br>&quot;Pensй que eras otra persona&quot; should translate to &quot;I thought you were another person,&quot; provided four years of high school Spanish and Google Translate did their jobs correctly.<br>Thanks for the technical comments, I&#39;ll go check those out now, and thanks for being the first to give some feedback!</p>

            <p>Who is the Zlang-Zlang Squid, you may ask? Well, the Zlang-Zlang Squid is a bit characters who jumped into my head and refuses to get out again.

            <p>Thanks so much! We didn&#39;t expect such a generous welcome XD *pats moose affectionately* Zlang-Zlang Squid loves the fish tank but he&#39;s not too sure what to do with the stick of butter ;) Right now it&#39;s in the corner of his tank and he&#39;s eyeing it warily. I think he thinks I have plans to eat him, which just isn&#39;t true; Zlang-Zlang Squids cause whoever eats them to spontaneously combust. Not surprisingly, they have very few natural predators.<br><br>My fandoms...let&#39;s see.  I write for any fandom I like if a story suggests itself.  In the past I&#39;ve been a part of:<br><br>Harry Potter<br><br>Equilibrium<br><br>Aliens; where I first learned about Mary-Sues, largely through making one myself and having my father point this out to me. If there is any defense, it must be that I was only eleven years old at the time and still learning about writing ;)<br><br>LOTR<br><br>The A-Team<br><br>I might get back into a few of those; I want to clean up my HP series for a start. Right now, though, it&#39;s:<br><br>Death Note<br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog (this one has seriously lapsed though; I&#39;ll finish the final story and the two adaptations I&#39;ve been working on, then I plan to retire)<br><br>Sherlock<br><br>Arashi (Yes, real people fic. It&#39;s an interesting challenge as a writer and I&#39;m a huge fan, so it works for me)<br><br>I&#39;m a fan of a lot of other things besides these, but no other fandom has ever jumped out at me enough to make me want to write about it. I tend to write fanfiction novels rather than short stories, with only a few very rare exceptions, so I can&#39;t be as active as I would like =P<br><br>Favorite agents...let me see.  I love the original Jay and Acacia, but my favorite agent so far - being new means I haven&#39;t read many of the missions - is Luxury.  I also have a fondness for Allison and Tasmin, since it was their stories that brought me and the Zlang-Zlang Squid here.<br><br>So if the Zlang-Zlang Squid gets into the fishpond and eats all the fish, you know who to blame XD</p>

            <p>My dad&#39;s always the one to point out flaws like that in my writing, like Mary Sues and Magic Pockets XD He&#39;s always very gentle about it, but he&#39;s usually right as well. <br><br>Though having said that, my Sue was something of a bit-part Sue.  She wasn&#39;t in every chapter by a long shot, but when she did show up, there was no one faster, tougher or cooler.  Although there were quite a few characters who didn&#39;t like her that much...not sure if that alleviates the Sue-ness or not. I must read more PPC to find out! XD</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this for quite a while now, and I&#39;ve decided that it would be good to have the Board help out for a bit. I&#39;m making a list of the common types of bad OCs (Sues, etc.) that appear in badfic of animated movies, like that HTTYD fic Neshomeh tackled once or the Incredibles badfic from my very first mission. I&#39;ve got a &#39;descendant of an implausible pairing&#39;, a &#39;ridiculously OP hybrid&#39;, and a &#39;Sailor Earth&#39;-type character, but now I&#39;m a bit stuck.<br><br>So, anybody have any more ideas? About three or four will do - I don&#39;t want to overdo what I&#39;m planning with this list, after all. ;)</p>

            <p><br>These can apply to badfic of pretty much everything:<br><br>Dies, falls into the canon (usually a Stu, but I see it happen with Sues as well)<br><br>Suddenly, the team always had another member!<br><br>Suddenly, they&#39;re scouting out talent and this person is so awesome!<br><br>Suddenly, the canon characters are villains!

            <p>I was thinking of stuff specifically related to animated movies (like a dragon-human hybrid in the HTTYD universe, such as Kana from that one HTTYD mission). Here, lemme check through the list...<br><br>The ones I think I can use are &quot;excessively talented&quot;, &quot;darker and edgier&quot; (the badfic I wrote/sporked in my very first mission was horribly guilty of that, sorry to say), &quot;canon seducer&quot;, and &quot;straw feminist&quot;. Don&#39;t know if I can use the ones that deform the canons&#39; personalities, but they&#39;re definitely things an author wraith could do; killing them off is definitely not going to work with what I&#39;m doing. The children of the canons can be done right if written well, but if they&#39;re from improbable pairings like Syndrome/Violet in The Incredibles canon, then NAWP, sorry.<br><br>Yeah, I think that should hopefully be enough. This is gonna be fun! *chuckles evilly*</p>

            <p>I was always a bit sad about missing out on the Original Series - I joined just after Jay left, though she popped back in about twice (and also IMed me out of the blue about Jaycacia Thornbyrd... fortunately, both she and Acacia thought it was funny). But... y&#39;know, most of the Big Stuff wasn&#39;t that big when it was happening. Generic Surface went mostly unnoticed; Reorg was always popular when I got something posted, but had an eighteen-month-or-so gap in the middle. The Emergencies... well, only the Mary-Sue Invasion was a full Board RP. The Macrovirus Epidemic was mostly Tawaki writing a couple of stories (and killing Makes-Things and sending the Board into a frenzy), and the others were the same sort of thing - one person writes a story, other people react.<br><br>And those still happen! The Blackout was only last year, and spawned more reaction stories than any other event since the macroviruses. It wasn&#39;t planned, either - it just happened. The cool things happen because people write stories, and you&#39;re one of those people now. Scary, ain&#39;t it?<br><br>And... well, watch this space. Later today, a new chapter in the history of the Protectors may be opening up, and you - yes you - could help create it.<br><br>hS is a massive tease</p>

            <p>That&#39;s semi-claiming, because I&#39;m... not actually sure it&#39;s badfic. I&#39;m going to read it properly tomorrow, but at least technical-wise it looks quite good. It doesn&#39;t reach Rivendell yet, of course.<br><br>But the reason I&#39;m semi-claiming it rather than ignoring it? It features Pippin, so Kaitlyn can go back to her old job in Character Protective Services. And it features an OC named Acacia, which, particularly in light of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=264728;search_term=acacia">doctorlit&#39;s</a> response to an earlier Driftwood mission, I could do a <i>lot</i> with...<br><br>So we&#39;ll see.

            <p>This reminds me of the Pokemon app they ran a bit ago through Google Maps, where you could track down and capture Pokemon by scanning around the world. At least, I think that was them. Either way, this is a pretty cool find. Who knows, maybe some fanfiction writers will consult this and stick just a bit closer to canon?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never beta&#39;d (betad and betaed do not look right) before, except in English class, so I don&#39;t know about being the sole beta for the mission, but I could certainly look over it, if you like! I do have a pretty good eye for SPaG errors, semicolons aside, and I can usually find clunk, but I can&#39;t make any promises.<br><br>(Off-topic side note: I almost misspelled my username on this due to typing on a phone. Since I doubt you want a Mini-Boarder running amok, posting things, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t. Especially on a post about betaing things.)<br><br>And on the author being a Twilight fan... I was half right, at least. Hopefully this one won&#39;t try to publish it. ;)<br><br>(And now is when I realize you were looking for a beta for you, not trying to find a SPaG-deprived author one. I am not smart sometimes.)</p>

            <p>So hey, Voyd. I seem to remember you had a... somewhat rocky time of things. [Checks] Yeah.<br><br>Okay. I&#39;m not saying anything at all about your projected future behaviour; this is just a friendly reminder of what was said... virtually the last time you posted. The original post was by VixenMage, and while a lot of it isn&#39;t relevant, some parts are:<br><br><i>Participation is not just posting threads. You&#39;ve posted a lot of threads - actually, to the point where it&#39;s bordered on thread-spamming, pushing other topics off the edge before their time. But I have not seen you reply to anyone else&#39;s threads, and even on your own threads, I have seen you outright ignore any replies disagreeing with you. This is Not Okay. The PPC is not a sounding box to hear your own voice echoed, it&#39;s a forum for discussion from all sides. To that end, I would like to see you stop posting all your own threads, and start engaging other people. Allow your interest to be engaged by new things! This is an important part of being a part of a community.</i><br><br>(Source <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=246879">here</a>, but the rest of it&#39;s about Permission)<br><br>Again, I&#39;m not intending to say, imply, or suggest that you intend to continue in that line of behaviour; I&#39;m just making sure you&#39;re aware of what the problems <i>were</i>.<br><br>And aside from all that - welcome back a&#39;Board. Have fun!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>For quite a long time, there has been an infrequent but plaintive cry that all the good parts of PPC history are taken - that I&#39;ve gone through and systematically written everything worth writing, and left only the dregs for the rest of you. I&#39;ve always argued against this, pointing out that the &#39;good parts&#39; only exist <i>because</i> of my stories, and that anyone else is free to add their own &#39;good parts&#39;. But it&#39;s never really happened.<br><br>So here&#39;s your chance to change that.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uV53iJCdl9zi49knzxlkixn1BeRKUc0qc-1Dp2gm6S8/pub">So You Think You Know PPC History?</a><br><br>Spoilery discussion to follow; Legolas, give me some space!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Wait.jpg"><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Wait.jpg"><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Wait.jpg"><br><br><i>(&quot;... a diversion!&quot;)</i><br><br><i>So You Think...?</i> was written to answer a couple of not-so-burning questions:<br><br>-How did the PPC go from slow enough recruitment that the first three agents worked together for a significant amount of time before there were six agents total, to masses of agents during the Insanity Epidemic, in the space of maybe 5 years?<br><br>-What exactly did the Marquis de Sod mean when <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/DoSAT/story02.html">he told Agent Techno-Dann</a> that <i>Management decided long ago to replace all the human directors with flowers. We&#39;re much more dependable</i>?<br><br>The story as outlined in <i>So You Think...?</i> goes like this: there was another &#39;PPC&#39;, already in existence when the Flowers first set foot in the Word Worlds. Sometime around 1987-88, they contacted the SO and proposed a merger.<br><br>I said there was a vote, and I meant it. It&#39;s this: <b>Should <i>So You Think...?</i> become part of the PPC canon?</b><br><br>I&#39;m asking for two reasons. First, it&#39;s a fairly significant shake-up of the PPC history you (think you) know. Everything I&#39;ve previously written still stands - it&#39;s just that there&#39;s a whole other side of things you never saw.<br><br>Secondly... I will never write another word in this second PPC. How closely do they match the Flowers&#39; version? Why did the Flowers end up recreating their organisation? Where did they come from? Precisely how large are they? Why does no-one ever talk about them? Why are the First Twenty agents (Elisabeth, Anya, Osbert, Doctor Cornelius and Mortic Wentway are the five we know the names of) famous, when the other PPC was much larger at the same time? All these questions, and all the others, are <i>yours</i> to answer. I&#39;ll make use of things other people write, but I won&#39;t create anything on this side of the PPC. Ever.<br><br>So the collory to the voting question is: are you up for the challenge? There&#39;s a whole new history out there for you to explore. You could write a new History, throw out vignettes, or simply integrate it into your agents&#39; backstory. The worlds are your molluscs.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Some minor notes on things that may or may not be canonised:<br><br>-If we need terms for the two PPCs prior to their merger, I suggest PPC (Origin) and PPC (Earth). Unless someone decides that the larger PPC isn&#39;t from Earth, in which case, wherever they&#39;re from. You could also have PPC (Flowers) and PPC (Humans). Whether these are in-universe terms, or just Wiki names, is up to you lot.<br><br>-I deliberately left the woman in the story unnamed, but my personal head-canon is that she&#39;s Jay Thorntree. ^<em>^ That may well mess up her age, though - I&#39;m not sure if it was ever stated - unless she was caught in half of the Lancre Timeslip or something? Tell you what - if someone wants to canonise the idea that she was a PPC (Earth) agent before the merger, I&#39;ll write the story of how she skipped over most of the &#39;90s. Unless you want to write it!<br><br>-My current thought is that Agent Selene was a PPC (Earth) agent. I won&#39;t mention that, though, until someone makes it clear whether or not the former PPC(E) agents actually remember that fact.<br><br>-Did this all come across as a bit confrontational? Because it&#39;s not meant to. Truth be told, I&#39;m really excited to see what you can all come up with, given a wide-open setting like this. ^</em>^ ~hS</p>

            <p>Part of me likes the idea.  It explains that line from Makes-Things, which previously didn&#39;t fit with the currently canon history.  It also adds some back-up to the never-quite-spoken-aloud idea that There&#39;s Something About World One that makes it a particularly time-rupturey and delicate version of Earth, closely linked to the rest of the worlds.*<br><br>But on the other hand . . . I guess it just feels a little too forced?  Above you asked, <i>&quot;How did the PPC go from slow enough recruitment that the first three agents worked together for a significant amount of time before there were six agents total, to masses of agents during the Insanity Epidemic, in the space of maybe 5 years?&quot;</i>  Let&#39;s go by Occam&#39;s Razor, based on what we already know.  The first two weren&#39;t recruited; they fell through by accident, due to Makes-Things.  We know Osbert was the third; maybe Osbert was the first to fall through a natural plothole (EKYL PLESE GIVE OSBERT A BACKSTORY), and at least some of the other seventeen probably came the same way.  We already know the SO wanted to move away from &quot;blow up the planet&quot; to &quot;deal with just the bad parts.&quot;  Seeing how effective the World One recruits were, and perhaps starting to get an inkling of World One&#39;s status as a story nexus of some sort, perhaps the Flowers started their campaign of recruitment posters and the like then.  Such posters are mostly mentioned in older spin-offs, indicating that that recruitment strategy was used more heavily in the early days of the (real world actively written) PPC, but have tapered off more recently.  This could be an indicator that the upsurge of staff you mentioned between the early days and the Somebody&#39;s arrival was due to this stronger recruitment campaign.  (<a href="http://kunenk.livejournal.com/5844.html">Radio Kunek&#39;s history</a> seems to be a poetic telling of events similar to what I&#39;ve just described.  At least, that&#39;s my interpretation.)<br><br>As for the line from Makes-Things: Maybe with all the humanoid recruits the PPC started to get, they put another level of supervisor under the Flowers to deal directly with the other (mostly) human(oid) agents.  But perhaps that didn&#39;t work out well, or perhaps they simply preferred having the non-Flower supervisors in the field, or perhaps said supervisors were spending to much time in the field to do their jobs effectively?  Any of which could have led to the Flowers reinstated the original department heads as the direct overseers to the agents.  Doctor Fitzgerald&#39;s continued role as department head may simply be due to his better understanding of humanoid biology than any of the Flowers could manage, making it more efficient to keep him on as head of Medical.  (Plus, our version is a hologram, right?  I&#39;ve never been quite clear on that.)  If this happened not long before Jay and Acacia&#39;s posted mission reports (or even during the first four!), it might still have been on Makes-Things&#39;s mind when he introduced Agent Dann to the Marquis.<br><br>So, yeah.  I guess, in general, I prefer using what&#39;s already established as a base for writing around, rather than adding big changes like this into the PPC&#39;s backstory.  And I feel like we do have enough holes to fill, as is.  Putting aside Ekyl&#39;s personal investment in Osbert, there are at least two or three long histories that could be made out of everything I&#39;ve just discussed.  I vote against this change.<br><br>Also, completely off-topic, but this is a photo from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voh">New Caledonia</a>:<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Voh.jpg/270px-Voh.jpg" alt="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Voh.jpg/270px-Voh.jpg"> <br><br>*I&#39;m fighting it, because I know I <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> think it, but I&#39;m getting more and more convinced that the PPC&#39;s &quot;World One&quot; is Stephen King&#39;s &quot;Keystone Earth&quot; from the final <i>Dark Tower</i>.  They both have exits and entrances to other worlds, they both have a strong theme for the power of stories, and while Keystone Earth is the Earth closest to the Dark Tower, which is the center of all worlds, World One seems to be closest to PPC HQ (based on the disproportionate amount of recruitment from there), a location situated between other worlds.  There&#39;s also the whole &quot;coincidence is dead&quot; thing, which ties nicely into two separate PPCs.  I&#39;m sure someone will publish a <i>Dark Tower</i> mission that contradicts this someday, but for now . . .</p>

            <p>While the existence of two PPCs seems overly coincidental, the idea of two similar badfic-fighting organizations springing up independently isn&#39;t (we&#39;ve seen plenty of that), and the two joining forces makes perfect sense. I kinda like the idea that they hooked up the Flowers&#39; HQ to the office building—that would explain why some parts look more office-y and some parts are more alien. So, why not?<br><br>I guess I&#39;m not that shaken up, seeing as you&#39;re not actually changing anything, just adding to it. Plus, I&#39;m not personally interested in delving into the fictional past, and the earliest history of the PPC doesn&#39;t really affect what I&#39;m doing with my stories in the present, so I&#39;m not really fussed about it. (And Reorg was exciting because there was a plot with stakes in it. This, while potentially opening doors to anyone who thought they were closed before for some reason, doesn&#39;t have any inherent drama to it.)<br><br>I don&#39;t think the woman in the story could be Jay, though. Timelines aside, Jay was just an agent, and a bit of a flake at that. I can&#39;t see her in a serious bureaucratic/ambassadorial role. It just doesn&#39;t sound like her to me.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>In TOS, Makes-Things was basically just a crazy inventor with a lab. There wasn&#39;t a Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology until Techno-Dann came along and invented it, AFAIK. So, how does that resolve in-universe? I guess I assume the department existed even back in J &amp; A&#39;s time despite them not mentioning it as such, because I have trouble believing just one guy serviced all the technology for all the agents. If the timelines fit, I could see the merger taking Makes-Things from just a guy with a lab in the Flowers&#39; Organization to a guy with a whole department under him with the addition of personnel from the humans&#39; PPC... but alas, the timelines don&#39;t fit. {= /<br><br>~Neshomeh, dead-ending.</p>

            <p>I am actually working on an alternative to Origins, which won&#39;t be nearly as intricate or lengthy, but should still be fun.  It is based on that line from the Marquis about human directors and also on the fact that Flowers are untrustworthy sources of information.<br><br>So, yeah, I agree that there is more to be written about how the PPC started.  Our goals are, in fact, the same: to get people to see the possibilities that are out there.  I just don&#39;t think all of those possibilities need to be in the same timeline/universe.  :P<br><br>-Phobos, who should move that story up the list a little</p>

            <p>Hello, Agents and Friends!<br><br>Some of you may remember me from quite a few years ago--I was rather active in the mid-to-late 2000&#39;s, but sort of eased out of the community when school got a little crazy (Agents Sara and Zach were my brainbabies).<br><br>Anyhoo, I&#39;m de-lurking to ask you all if you&#39;d be willing to help me with a project for uni. I&#39;m working on a degree in linguistics, and for one of my classes I&#39;m writing a linguistic sketch of an online speech community, and as I still remember the PPC quite fondly, this unique (and wonderful) corner of the fanfiction world is my focus. I only have a handful of questions, and I don&#39;t require any personal information from you that could identify exactly who you are out there in The World. Feel free to answer in this thread, or, if you&#39;re uncomfortable doing so, you can email me your answers at <a href="mailto:sjohnson.smiles@gmail.com">sjohnson.smiles@gmail.com</a> .<br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, and should you choose to reply, thank you so much in advance!<br><br>QUESTIONS:<br><br>1. What is your age, gender, and nationality? (feel free to answer none or only part of this question)<br><br>2. What, in your personal opinion, constitutes badfic?<br><br>3. Do you think there is a &quot;formula&quot; or &quot;script&quot; to writing Missions?<br>      3a. If so, can you describe it?<br><br>4. What, in your personal opinion, constitutes a &quot;good&quot; Mission?<br>        4a. What are the essential tools for writing one?<br><br>5. Do you write Missions?<br>        5a. If so, have you ever had an interaction with the author of the fic you are sporking? If so, what was the nature of this interaction? Was there any change in the author&#39;s behaviour after your interaction?<br><br>6. What initially drew you to the PPC community?<br><br>7. What keeps you here?</p>

            <p><b>1. What is your age, gender, and nationality?</b> <br>61, male, German (not your average boarder).<br><br><b>2. What, in your personal opinion, constitutes badfic?</b><br>Disregarding canon to make the word world fit a plot or character which or who should better have been used in an original story, as opposed to deliberately twitching canon to explore the consequences in a what-if AU. No, wait. That constitutes bad fan fiction, combined with the general characteristics of badfic: implausible plot, contradictory characterization, obvious errors about facts that could easily be researched and bad SPaG showing that the author didn’t bother to put much afford into this fic.<br> <br><b>3. Do you think there is a &quot;formula&quot; or &quot;script&quot; to writing Missions?</b><br>Not really. There are standard ingredients and guidelines, and it’s unusual to have the climactic assassination or exorcism before the flashback where the agents get the mission, but varying the recipe is what keeps it interesting over years.<br><br><b>3a. If so, can you describe it?</b><br>I could try to list the ingredients and guidelines, but that’s what the wiki is for.<br><br><b>4. What, in your personal opinion, constitutes a &quot;good&quot; Mission?</b><br>Actual concrit, disguised as a funny story.<br><br><b>4a. What are the essential tools for writing one?</b><br>A critical mind and a good sense of humor, combined with at least basic writing skills.<br><br><b>5. Do you write Missions?</b><br>Not yet, and considering my lack of spare time I will probably not even ask for permission before I retire from my job. But I’m working on my future agents’ back story.<br><br><b>6. What initially drew you to the PPC community?</b><br>I found the PPC on a derivative of the Evil Overlord List concerning trans-dimensional organizations. I became curious and, although I had never been into fan fiction, I liked the humor and silliness of The Original Series. <br><br><b>7. What keeps you here?</b><br>The people, I guess. Actually it’s the wide variety of discussions to lurk on and to contribute to when I find the time to put my thoughts together. And doing this in a foreign language keeps my brain alert. <br><br>HG</p>

Do you think there is a &quot;formula&quot; or &quot;script&quot; to writing Missions?</b>Yes, more or less. It gets played with, usually for more serious or important Missions.<br><b>3a. If so, can you describe it?</b>Agents are interacting with each other, maybe continuing a subplot from previous Missions, when they are alerted to an incoming Mission. They read the report and make angry preparations to enter the fic. Once inside, they scan the characters for OOC-ness, take down charges, and suffer from the bad writing--figuratively and literally since a lot of badfic elements manifest physically. Then they capture and charge the Sue or Wraith and execute them in a creative fashion. Afterwards they return to their base and possibly get reprimanded if they broke any rules.<br><br><b>4. What, in your personal opinion, constitutes a &quot;good&quot; Mission?</b>One where the Sue&#39;s obnoxiousness is conveyed in all its cringe-inducing glory, the Agents are engaging, and any snarking is funny.<br><b>4a. What are the essential tools for writing one?</b>Tricky...Agents whose characters the writer really gets. What&#39;s the justice in mocking someone else&#39;s bad characterization if you can&#39;t write a competent OC yourself? Also an ear for good jokes. And, of course, basic writing skills like SPaG, pacing and so forth.<br><br><b>5. Do you write Missions?</b>No, I don&#39;t have Permission, but seeing the next question I have sporked a badfic independently, and I&#39;ve written a PPC-esque series with made-up Sues and Stus called Shattered Hourglass.<br><b>5a. If so, have you ever had an interaction with the author of the fic you are sporking? If so, what was the nature of this interaction? Was there any change in the author&#39;s behaviour after your interaction?</b>Yes. I was in a position of authority and felt what I did wasn&#39;t quite appropriate and apologized. She (gender presumed) and a friend each posted a comment calling me names a few months after that. Her activity on Wikia and DeviantArt petered out, with no apparent change in behavior.<br><br><b>6. What initially drew you to the PPC community?</b>I&#39;m a fan of MST3K, so hearing about MST&#39;ings led me to the PPC&#39;s Original Series.<br><br><b>7. What keeps you here?</b>The community? A lot of the time I&#39;m nervous to speak up or interact, but this place is really unique. It&#39;s critical, but also creative. Even if I didn&#39;t enjoy the catharsis, the meta-fandom is cool.</p>

            <p>Welcome back.<br><br>1) 20, Male, British<br>2) Mainly a badly written piece of fanfiction that either ignores the current state of canon (at the time it was written) and instead replaces or inserts the events and/or characters within canon with original characters or events (either outright or hiding in canon character/event&#39;s clothings), which often make the fic unbelievable in any number of ways. Or that attempts to fix some wrong the the author has perceived to exist within the canon, whether this be pairing, death of a character or whatever so fulfill what the author believes to be the &#39;correct&#39; state of canon, using whatever means they deem necessary, even if they do not make sense (in or out of canon). For me those are the two main things that constitute badfic, although they are not the sole ones.<br><br>3,3a) There is a loose one yes. Part 1, or more effectively the prologue is where the agents are introduced, with a loud BEEP the mission is introduced and the agents prepare for the mission. Part 2, for me is roughly the first couple of chapters of the badfic, the agents arrive and take in their initial surroundings as well as taking in anything that is introduced in the badfic and filtering through to make sure it fits canon, or else working out whether they can charge for it and if so under what. Part 3 constitutes the main picking up of charges, and working through the badfi...il the point where either the agents have enough or that there is a perfect moment for the agents to intercept whatever is causing the badfic and deal with it whilst they have enough charges. Part 4 is made up of the agents picking up the pieces and sorting out what bits of the badfic they need to/can that aren&#39;t already dealt with. Part 5, the epilogue is the agents returning to their RC and preparing for the next mission. <br><br>4) I don&#39;t know, I suppose a &quot;Good&quot; mission for me should be funny, and with that I mean tickle my particular tastes of humour, but then obviously this is for me and not in general, it should not be too long, or if it is there should be something that makes me want to keep reading (actually a shorter mission needs that as well) and overall there&#39;s got to be some connection to the Agents, I can&#39;t really explain it, but there&#39;s got to be something human in quality about the Agents (even if they aren&#39;t actually humans).<br><br>5) I have Permission, and am in the process of writing missions, but I have not yet finished one.<br>5a) Kind of, I&#39;ve got a base for a mission I&#39;m writing sporking my first attempt a fanfic, looking back at it now I can see how much I&#39;ve changed between when I was writing it and now. <br><br>6) I&#39;d started realizing that the stuff I was reading (and writing) wasn&#39;t that good and I wanted a place where I could improve my writing skills in a friendly environment, I saw the TvTropes page and thought the PPC looked quite nice, I started lurking on the board for a bit before I actually introduced myself and I liked what I saw even more, it was then just a question of plucking up enough courage to actually write an introduction post...<br><br>7) Besides really wanting to get a mission out? I mean, I really like this community, it&#39;s a fun place to be and overall they&#39;re good people to know, most of whom I&#39;d happily call friends. I&#39;m still improving when it comes to my writing and it&#39;s all thanks to people on this site, and in some ways I feel like I owe them and I want to show them that all that yelling at me about comma&#39;s has got through. And I know that if I keep trying I can improve my writing so much more, and it feels natural to me that this is the place where I do that. I love the overall sense of community, how it doesn&#39;t matter what you like you&#39;re welcome here and how on here everyone truly does the best they can to help others, it&#39;s rare to find somewhere like that, on the internet or in real life, and for someone like me, that&#39;s the sort of place that I want to be, the community I want to be part of, somewhere I feel like I belong.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br>Who may have got a bit emotional at the last bit...</p>

            <p>Even if it&#39;s just for a little while. I hope you&#39;ll stick around, though. {= )<br><br>The survey:<br><br>1. 29, female, American.<br><br>2. A badfic is a fan-written story that&#39;s poorly written mechanically (e.g. spelling, punctuation, and grammar) and/or poorly told as a story (e.g. unrealistic characters, flawed logic, haphazard pacing). Usually both. Badfics tend to ignore or change aspects of the source canon, either because the writer forgot about them or didn&#39;t know better, or to &quot;make the plot work&quot; or benefit an original character inserted into the world.<br><br>3. Yes, but not more so than any other narrative.<br><br>3a. More than that, I plugged the standard PPC mission into Syd Field&#39;s paradigm for fun a few years ago: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RMkTrDaAFMi8rnccdLe2glT51SzyQjz1IUzg8Ztpyxc/edit?usp=sharing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RMkTrDaAFMi8rnccdLe2glT51SzyQjz1IUzg8Ztpyxc/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RMkTrDaAFMi8rnccdLe2glT51SzyQjz1IUzg8Ztpyxc/edit?usp=sharing</a></a><br><br>4. My favorite missions are the truly parodic ones that take the text of the badfic and transform it into something hilarious. Rather than just pointing out each thing that&#39;s wrong, groaning about it, and moving on to the next thing, they take what&#39;s wrong and express it in an exaggerated, absurd way. For instance, in Tungsten Monk&#39;s latest mission, a character is described as a &quot;green shirt&quot; instead of a &quot;greenshirt&quot; (a rookie). Therefore, in the mission, the character appeared as a floating green shirt the whole time. Much funnier than the agents simply pointing out the typo.<br><br>My favorite missions also star characters who are more than just interchangeable talking heads. Half of what makes a mission funny is what the writer does with the badfic; the other half is the interactions the agents have with each other and with the fic. If the agents are two-dimensional cardboard cutouts that can only groan and point out the literal errors, they&#39;re not interesting or funny. If they each have their own quirks and foibles, and get annoyed by different things, and disagree with each other sometimes, and their snark is insightful and revealing, that&#39;s gold.<br><br>4a. You gotta have a sense of humor, and you gotta push the envelope. I mean, okay, start with the basics: solid writing skills, knowing the canon, knowing the PPC universe. But then you have to have an eye for material you can work with, and you have to have a flair for the absurd. You have to take the time to look past the literal text of the badfic, both understand what the author intended and get past it, and extract comedy from what it <i>could</i> mean. Then build a story around it with characters who really engage with their situation and have it affect them.<br><br>5. Yep!<br><br>5a. Once, I was in the middle of sporking a fic when I went and looked at the summary for the first time, to find that the author had actually repented ages ago and was all for the PPC sporking the thing. I got in touch with him, let him know I was doing it, and actually invited him to have a cameo. He accepted, and ended up assassinating his own Gary Stu. ^_^ That&#39;s pretty atypical, though.<br><br>I have occasionally reviewed fics I&#39;ve sporked, but I&#39;ve never had anything come of that, to my knowledge.<br><br>6. The humor and the fact that they were a bunch of Tolkien nerds, like me. I don&#39;t think I had ever met a bigger Tolkien nerd than myself until I found the Board. It was a little intimidating, but awesome, especially because everyone was so nice and welcoming.<br><br>7. I&#39;ve been a member for over a decade, and at this point I can hardly imagine my life without the PPC in it. It&#39;s a part of my identity now. Furthermore, I&#39;ve made some great friends here, and I still have stories to tell and other contributions to make, such as my work on the wiki.<br><br>I hope that helps. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Glad you&#39;re having fun in college!  Here we go:<br><br>1. Twenty-eight, male, U.S. white.<br><br>2. A badfic is a fanfic that undoes, perverts or goes against some aspect of the source material, caused by lack of careful planning and thought during the writing process.  (Not to be confused with an exploratory, alternate universe fanfic that intentionally changes something and examines the full consequences.)<br><br>3/3a. No.  The only thing that&#39;s universal enough to missions to call the &quot;formula&quot; is the bare bones mechanical structure of the agents reacting to the writing of the original badfic.  Even showing quotes from the original probably isn&#39;t strictly necessary, though it&#39;s probably easier to do it that way.  I suppose the ending of missions (remove the problem) is also  part of a &quot;formula,&quot; but even then, we see unforeseen problems and consequences interfere with the resolution as often as not.<br><br>4. To me, the best missions are those that don&#39;t merely remove the uncanon and restore the canon, but <i>celebrate</i> the canon.  This is sometimes as simple as writing in the same style as the original, or quoting it cleverly.  More complex examples could be giving a canon character a moment to shine and reinforce their canon theme or attitude.  In the best case, such a mission contrasts those canon themes with the mistakes made in the badfic, so that the reader of the mission sees the conceptual errors that contributed to making the original fanfic a badfic.<br>4a. The only tools needed for writing a good mission are a strong familiarity with the source canon, and a critical eye for narrowing down the badfic&#39;s themes: not just looking at superficial errors, but the major problems that cause the badfic to fail to properly coexist with the canon it takes place in.<br><br>5/5a. I do write missions, but I have never communicated with the authors of any of the fanfics I&#39;ve written missions for.  I have no desire to do so, mostly out of discomfort interacting with unfamiliar people.<br><br>6. I&#39;ve always been interested in crossovers, and looking for both subtle and overt connections between different fictional universes.  The in-universe PPC offered the opportunity to interact with essentially infinite canons from a single base point, which was exciting for me as a writer.  (As a reader, all the free content produced by the other community members is also fantastic!)<br><br>7. I am heavily invested in the PPC setting, and have many plans for my characters, whom I hope to continue writing for many decades.  Aside from my personal enjoyment in writing my PPC characters, I love seeing the reactions other people have to reading them, and getting other opinions and viewpoints about what I write.<br><br>On a more personal note, I have made many friends in this community; I have more close friends in the PPC than I do in real life.  I don&#39;t often meet people who think like I do, so the PPC is fantastic for my continued sanity.  I am also a better person now than I was when I first joined the PPC, due to the other members teaching me about people and the real world, a world I had little knowledge of at the start.<br><br>Hope that&#39;s useful!  If you&#39;re quoting anything of mine, feel free to restructure any sentences to make them read more professionally.<br><br>Good luck, both on this assignment and with school in general.  I hope we&#39;ll see you some more once you&#39;ve graduated!<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>Or, rather, hello there.<br>1. [REDACTED], male, Israeli.<br>2. Badfic is when someone takes other people&#39;s works and decides to ignore them, then write a story with them nonetheless. Alternatively: clueless people writing fanfic. Alternatively: disturbing people writing fanfic.<br>3. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">This</a> exists, but it&#39;s mostly a set of guidelines. Ultimately, a mission depends on the badfic it is sporking and on the agents; there is no set &#39;formula&#39; per se, though some patterns are recognisable ([BEEEEEEEEP!], reading charges and other PPC SOP, etc).<br>4. Varies. It&#39;s usually either funny or cathartic. The latter is reserved to truly horrifying fics, stories that make you want to spork them because you won&#39;t feel alright if you won&#39;t.<br>4a. I&#39;m not sure, but inspiration is important, as are good betas.<br>5. Yes. Sorta. When I don&#39;t have writer&#39;s block.<br>5a. No.<br>6. Reading the PPC&#39;s TvTropes page and thinking it is awesome.<br>7. The people. Writing&#39;s just a common interest; the people are amazing.</p>

            <p>Before I go into the survey, have a honking llama with an urple bow around its neck! If the urple becomes too painful, feel free to remove it.<br><br>Okay, you need some questions answered? Lessee...<br><br>1) 17, almost 18; female; American<br><br>2) Badfic can consist of several different things, but to me it&#39;s mostly a blatant disregard for canon, including but not limited to: Major OOCness, Sues who contribute nothing to the story, Sues who derail the story for no reason, horrendous grammar, and not doing research. Of course, it&#39;s usually found in a combination of all that.<br><br>3) The majority of them follow the same pattern, but I like it.<br>3a) 1. Agents get mission. 2. Agents enter fic. 3. Snark happens. 4. Agents kill the fic and go home.<br><br>4) Good missions? The funny ones! The ones that make the badfic less horrible.<br>4a) Tools? A sense of humor, a knowledge of the continuum, and lots and lots of Brain Bleach.<br><br>5) Yep! Got Permission back in February. :D<br>5a) No, I have not... unless interacting with yourself counts? I&#39;m working on my old badfic right now.<br><br>6) The idea was appealing. I&#39;d already gotten sick of all the badfic and was leery of browsing the Pit as a result. And then I found this place and thought the idea was really cool, sending agents into badfic to clean up my beloved canons. The idea alone had me sold.<br><br>7) Writing my own missions and reading others&#39; certainly plays a part, but I mostly stay here because of the people. I love this community and how close everyone is. Honestly, it would take a lot for me to leave.<br><br>Hope this helps!</p>
