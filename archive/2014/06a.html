            <p>The difficulty is matching the characteristics... some succubi are winged, for instance.<br><br>Fortunately - and particularly with badfic - most intruder species are copied from another canon, not made up from scratch. I guess your average fan-writer is more interested in writing (say) &#39;vampires from <i>Twilight</i> in Middle-earth&#39; than &#39;this genuinely innovative version of vampires which I just came up with, in Middle-earth&#39;.

            <p>There&#39;s tonnes of ways to narrow down the type of succubus. Where&#39;s your attention to detail?<br><br>-Language. Do they speak? If so, do they use modern English, Olde English, another language, or an alien tongue? Are they described as having an accent?<br><br>-If they /don&#39;t/ speak, do they use telepathy? Sentences, single words, or thoughts? Is it two-way?<br><br>-You say they can read minds - any clue on whether that&#39;s sentences or just impressions? Can they locate you by your thoughts? Can they /affect/ your thoughts?<br><br>-Size of wings. Massive bat-like things or tiny little leather-fairy jobs? Either way, are they able to fly, or are they just for display?<br><br>-General appearance. Are there any constants in their descriptions? Are they human-with-wings-and-tail, the above but in a different colour (blue, red, green), the above but with minor demonic attributes (fangs, pointy ears), or full-on demons?<br><br>-Magic? Illusion, mind control, magic ropes to ensnare you with.<br><br>-Do they have a hierarchy? How rigid is it?<br><br>-Are there incubi as well, or just succubi? If both, how do they relate to one another?<br><br>-Any information about where they come from? Are they a natural surface species? Escaping from a hellgate? Summoned deliberately? Summoned accidentally?<br><br>-Do they kill, or just drain energy? If they kill, how? By massive energy drain, vampiric bloodsucking, general mutilation?<br><br>Details, Storme Hawk! You have two sources for these creatures - unless they&#39;re incredibly background (in which case they&#39;ll probably just pop out of existence), you should be able to write a <i>thesis</i> on their biology.<br><br>(All right, I&#39;m being deliberately facetious with the tone of this; I&#39;m going for &#39;irritable professor&#39;, which isn&#39;t really Me. So don&#39;t take the framing comments too seriously. What I <i>am</i> serious about is that, with enough information, you can probably pin them to a precise world. Want me to take a look and write the thesis for you?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s go down this little list then. :p<br><br>- Err modern English<br>- Impressions, the exact term from the badfic is &#39;mind-skimming&#39;, although we only see it in use once.<br>- The badfic itself doesn&#39;t state anything more about their wings than the Succubi having them, the ones in the fic they&#39;re based on have massive bat-like wings so I&#39;d assume that it&#39;s a similar case. Either way they&#39;re seen flying. <br>- Humans-with-wings-and-tail<br>- Ritual based magics, mainly revolving around sex and blood. <br>- They have a hierarchy, it&#39;s not known exactly how rigid it is, however they do have a Matriarch who seems to rule them, from the small amount we see anyway.<br>- No incubi, the closest are Vampire&#39;s who they call their &#39;brothers&#39; (seemingly as a blanket term for their race).<br>- Natural surface species, Quote: &quot;It is said in the ancient texts that this battle took place when man was learning how to use fire and the ancient races were spread throughout the land, the five sentient races, Elf, Goblin, Centaur, Vampire and Succubi stood against the worst Dark Lord in history a Werewolf known only as the Night God who had gathered all the dark forces in the world under his rule and they fought for control of the earth.&quot; <br>- They don&#39;t seem to do either naturally,   <br><br>The problem is, is that they appear to be fairly central to the backstory and background, yet the badfic seems to have been abandoned and they&#39;ve only appeared in person in about a third of a chapter so far. <br><br>(don&#39;t worry, thanks and not at the moment.)<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>That&#39;s a <i>very</i> specific term. It only throws up a handful of hits on Google with &#39;&quot;mind-skimming&quot; succubus&#39; (and no more with &#39;succubi&#39;.<br><br>*One is the story I suspect you&#39;re looking at.<br>*One is a single mention in a Baldur&#39;s Gate fanfic, <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/476904/chapters/827410">here</a>. It doesn&#39;t seem connected to succubi, though they are mentioned on the page. Anyone who&#39;s played Baldur&#39;s Gate - or, indeed, anyone familiar with Forgotten Realms at all - able to comment on the similarities? Google images suggest a) never search for images of succubi, but b) they might be a match.<br>*The third hit is to <a href="http://alphachronicles.com/">Alpha Chronicles</a>, a &#39;universal Role Playing System&#39;. It links to this:<br><br><i>Mind Skimming<br> This option requires Mentalism and is a lesser version of telepathy.  The mind skimmer can read only the surface thoughts of the victim at a maximum range of 20 feet.  A contested ј Willpower vs. Mentalism check is required to read the victim’s mind.  The mind skimmer must continue to concentrate upon the victim in order to maintain the connection.  Any combat or movement faster than a walk will shatter the link.<br><br>Upgrades:<br>+10pts. Additional 5 feet of range.<br>+20pts.  Telepathy</i><br><br>Again the RP connection. Since pen and paper roleplaying really took off with D&amp;D - which is where FR is from, apparently - it&#39;s looking very likely that &#39;mind-skimming&#39; is a D&amp;D term. Which suggests one place to look to find a new home for your army of succubi.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>First up, some unrelated archival. Anyone remember the Board member Artemis? That&#39;s the original one, not the newbie from sometime this year. She created the DIA and the DBR, and then, uh, her website was lost with Geocities and all the original DIA stories are gone.<br><br>Or not! Well, all the ones from her <i>website</i> are... but I found a pair of stories elsewhere, which I&#39;ve archived for your convenience.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3cmaAUWnGpIJCSlJQazKYFpEVNxKqUsLYKOGUzI1m4/pub">DIA &amp; DBR</a><br><br>Featuring the earliest surviving appearance of the Tiger Lily, and also apparently Black has a dragon? Don&#39;t know what that&#39;s about.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Second up, some more archival! I found a couple of snippets of Agent Kaitlyn, from the DCPS, which I&#39;ve saved <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w86uPBbgRgLNSthZ8pg7qPrvgKRmOFoq2j5szJWGcDU/pub">here</a>.

            <p>First off, I should point out that I am definitely not the person who should be reviewing this piece. My antipathy towards the works of Tolkien is at least relatively known on the Board. I did my best to put that aside, but it still colored my perception of the story a little. Sorry.<br><br>I like that this is a story that doesn&#39;t involve the DMS or Floaters. I like to see the smaller departments in action. I also really like that this is written from a first-person perspective. It&#39;s a point of view that is rarely seen in PPC missions, and it&#39;s rather well done here. The moment where Agent Huinesoron is forced to confront his prejudices in particular is quite good.<br><br>This is a very little thing, but I&#39;m a little glad you didn&#39;t blow up the CAD. I&#39;m a bit tired of that running gag.<br><br>I noticed you used the stand-alone ellipsis as an indicator for silence a few times. This might just be me, but I&#39;m not a fan of that particular usage. It strikes me as almost being a cheat: rather than saying something like &quot;she stared at me in a brief gobsmacked silence before doing whatever action she did,&quot; you just write &quot; &#39;...&#39; she did the action.&quot;<br><br>A technical point: the sentence &quot;&quot;How do we know the Strider is a friend of Gandalf&#39;s I mean come on his horse is a black horse of Morgul?&quot;Merry questioned Frodo.&quot; is supposed to be italicized, as it is (what I assume to be) a quote from the badfic.<br><br>Finally, a bit of rambling on SIELU. I think that SIELU could actually be a bit more interesting if it wasn&#39;t so specific to Middle Earth. What if it was spread out from just Tolkienian Elven to a wide swath of fictional languages? You&#39;ve got Klingon, R&#39;yehian, Na&#39;vi, Tamriel Dragon, Hutteese, and what have you. You could even include real world languages if badfic characters keep spouting phrases in German or French or Japanese. Not everyone is going to be an expert in every language. That&#39;s where the new and improved SIELU would step in, sending agents to act as translators and proofreaders. I&#39;m basically saying that I want SIELU without the &#39;E&#39;.<br><br>I kinda wandered away from the main point of this post. Ahem. <br><br>Nice job, hS. The subject matter wasn&#39;t necessarily my cup of tea, but I still found myself enjoying it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been rambling away on this thread, and forgot to say how much I loved your mission.  Not only was the badfic really bad (not even bothering to show us the all-important scene of Pippin learning he was a werewolf for the first time!) but your writing of the mission was fun too.  Agent Kaitlyn&#39;s Hobbit fixation was cute, and it&#39;s always great to see a pompous Elf being taken down a peg or two,<br></p>

            <p>First off, congrats on turning up some lost stuff.  Do you mind if I ask where you found it, so I can try sniffing around myself?<br><br>On to the mission: Holy macaroon, even with that gigantic list of ten years&#39; Tolkienverse missions on the LotR page, and we&#39;re <i>still</i> finding new, unique badfics for new, unique missions in that fandom.  This one would have been unique even as a DMS-style mission, just because of all the werewolf nonsense, but you went above and beyond the uniqueness bar by making it a DCPS mission.  It turned out swimmingly; that moves the perspective of the mission from the surface contradictions against canon to Agent Kaitlyn&#39;s specific love and respect for the hobbit characters.  I like how that turned out; we don&#39;t tend to see that kind of possessive love for particular characters nowadays as often as we did in TOS&#39; days.  It would be nice to see missions swing back into this style, as it feels a lot more character-driven, on both the parts of the agents and the canons.<br><br>I also liked your treatment of the moment when Aragorn became character-replaced.  Each individual piece of that sequence was a tiny scene in itself, and they added up to a very complex and momentum-building sub-plot overall.  Aragorn&#39;s awareness of a problem breaking the badfic&#39;s hold over him for just that split-second is brilliant.  The tone of Aragorn&#39;s speech before and after the POV shift is jarring enough that the timing--which might seem overly convenient at first glance--ends up feeling natural and logical by the time the scene has played out.<br><br><s>Usual typo list</s> Actually, I&#39;m not even certain these are typos.  Here we go.<br><br>When Aragorn is released from the plothole, you spell it &quot;Dunedain.&quot;  In the full charge list, it&#39;s &quot;Dъnedain.&quot;  Is the accent mark interchangeable?<br><br><s>You used</s> Never mind I just looked it up.  &quot;Whingy&quot; is apparently a word.  (We Yankees tend to be &quot;whiny&quot; instead.)<br><br>The one legit typo is . . . a mini-Boarder!  It&#39;s Elvea Aure, not Aura. <s>I must sound like such a tool, correcting someone&#39;s spelling of the name of a person they knew whom I never met.  Boy, I like stike-through text tonight, don&#39;t I?</s><br><br>Finally, I must finally and embarrassingly ask . . . how is your name pronounced?  &gt;_&gt;  I&#39;ve been saying &quot;win-ES-ur-ON&quot; all this time, but seeing it interspersed with all this Elvish today, I realized: it&#39;s actually more like &quot;hoo-EE-nay-SORE-own&quot; isn&#39;t it?</p>

            <p>Mini-Boarder remerged with her original; &#39;Dunedain&#39; shipped off to Cassie. (For the record, the accents count, but I often skip them, since they&#39;re a pain in the asterisk to put in. In&#39;t old days, accents and capitalisation didn&#39;t make minis; times have changed). And whingy is a great word. ;)<br><br>Thank you for your review! I really liked writing Agent Kaitlyn; she turned out to be more and more fun as she went along. I think it stems from what you&#39;re talking about - rather than, like with all my other agents, focussing on nitpicking the details, her focus can be boiled down to one thing: hobbits are awesome! So everything else becomes peripheral to that. Really interesting to write. (And for my next mission: Agent Sambar, from Finance)<br><br>I found the lost stories through the Livejournals of their authors. I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s no more for Artemis or Kaitlyn, and a lot of other LJs from that time have been deleted. If you want to find a <i>lot</i> of stuff to archive, you can... oh, ppc-hq&#39;s been deleted. Greeeeeat. So you&#39;ll have to try and make connections between the various agent LJs by hand. <a href="http://agent_dafydd.livejournal.com/profile">Dafydd&#39;s friend list</a> should be a good place to start. But be aware that it&#39;s a... <i>very</i> big job.<br><br>... oh, stars. So (Allie and) Chelsea is the same person as (Kaitlyn and) Chelsea. And she has a journal. Kaitlyn&#39;s wiki page is not going to be the simple job I expected...<br><br>-- and my name. It&#39;s four syllables, and the H is pronounced. In Quenya, the second-to-last syllable is stressed. So either &#39;hween-ey-SOR-on&#39; or &#39;HWEEN-ey-SOR-on&#39; works. I&#39;ll also accept &#39;HWEEN-ey-sor-on&#39;, since it might be easier to pronounce. But the first version is most accurate.<br><br>(Which means, apart from your breaking the dipthong in the first syllable, your &#39;Elvish&#39; version was correct)<br><br>But generally, I avoid saying it. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Most of them don&#39;t have more than twenty entries, which is good from a time perspective (Agent Black&#39;s journal took me three days to copy) but bad from a lots-of-PPC-content perspective.  I now wish I had gone through it more slowly, since now I&#39;m going to have to go back through all the Word docs I made to get all the info on the wiki.<br><br>Eh, who am I kidding.  I love editing the wiki and reading PPC stuff.  I think I&#39;m going to make Irvine&#39;s page today.  Did you know he&#39;s a badfic copy of Irvine Kinneas from <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i>?  Did you know he was dating Teena?  And that he also had a female youkai form that was dating Kit?  And that s/he had baby fox things with Kit?  And did you know that an alternate universe version of Irvine named Diablos was stalking him around HQ for a long time, and no one even knows where Diablos came from?  (Or if they did, that scene is lost now.)  Woo!  Information!<br><br>The way I read, I basically &quot;talk&quot; all the words to myself in my head.  This means I&#39;m a self-enforcing stickler for pronunciation, which gets difficult when I&#39;m reading something like Elvish (or French, for that matter) that I have no direct practice using.  I took me a good, long time getting through <i>The Silmarillion</i> because I kept having to flip back to the language guide to get through individual sentences.  I&#39;m glad I got at least the rudimentary vowels right after all this time.<br><br>(This also makes reading H.P. Lovecraft hard, since &quot;Cthulhu&quot; is specifically stated to not be pronounceable by human tongue, which is the only one I have.  <s>That, and the constant racism and classism.</s>)</p>

            <p>With reference to Agent Rвmwк: if anyone can find me a badfic which either (in order of preference) a) uses Primitive Quendian/Primitive Eldarin/Primitive Elvish (ie, <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/primelv.htm">this language</a>), b) is set before the departure of the Eldar from Cuivienen, or c) is set during the Great March (ie, before the Vanyar and Noldor sail to Valinor), so that I can actually <i>use</i> Rвmwк, I will write you a 1000-word story of your choice as a reward.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>-&#39;The Last Vanya&#39; fits the timeframe, uses Quenya for the names (and occasionally what looks disturbingly like Sindarin), but doesn&#39;t look all the bad. I&#39;ve only skimmed it, though.<br><br>-&#39;A Borrowed Voice&#39; uses Quenya... pretty well. There&#39;s an incorrect idiom (&#39;Istan quetл&#39; is used as &#39;I can say&#39;, when it actually means &#39;I know how to speak [a language]&#39;), but it&#39;s pretty decent. It also deliberately uses an archiac word (&#39;az&#39; replacing &#39;ar&#39; for &#39;and&#39;), forms the tenses correctly... it&#39;s good. And it&#39;s Quenya, not Quendian, so.<br><br>-From the two Cuivienen fics, &#39;Ambassador&#39; actually looks really good (and uses PQ names correctly). &#39;Of Ingwe Ingweron&#39; seems well-written, doesn&#39;t use PQ (though it is set at Cuivienen), and, uh, makes the bizarre decision to make the Vanyar warriors. It confuses me. ;)<br><br>-&#39;Fiondil&#39;s Tapestry&#39; is essentially a linguistic discussion hidden behind a story. If I ever wanted to persuade Ramwe to think about other languages, I&#39;d send him to visit this fic. It&#39;s not too bad.<br><br>I guess that&#39;s the problem, really. Silm fic is already biased to the good because you have to read a pretty dense book just to get started - them&#39;s not got no films to ease you in. And Cuivienen (and PQ!) is <i>so</i> obscure that almost no-one writes about it - and those who do, do a decent job.<br><br>Which was nice to see! Especially &#39;A Borrowed Voice&#39;, it was fun to look at Quenya and go &#39;hey, I can almost read that&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There seems to be a recent trend for Elf Mary Sues to be called Erulissл.

            <p>The main reason an elf outside Aman might use a Quenya name would be if they&#39;re a Feanorian (and that&#39;s an accent I have no qualms about leaving out, since it&#39;s simply a pronunciation guide). House Feanor openly flouted Thingol&#39;s no-Quenya decrees. But there were no open Feanorians in the Third Age.<br><br>&#39;Erulissл&#39; apparently means &#39;grace&#39;, which given the Elvish taboo/respect around the Name, suggests an origin in one of Tolkien&#39;s religious translations. And yep, <a href="http://www.elfdict.com/translate.php?term=eruliss%C3%AB&amp;ajax=false">this</a> suggests it&#39;s from his &#39;Hail Mary&#39; (which you may know continues &#39;full of grace&#39;).<br><br>The normal translation for &#39;grace&#39; is &#39;Eruanna&#39; (&#39;God-gift&#39;, rather than the more poetic &#39;God-sweetness&#39;), so my guess is that some website recently added &#39;Erulissл&#39; to their list, and people named Grace have started using it.<br><br>And on a side note - that second link includes a half-elf, half-dwarf. Now, obviously the usual interspecies-couples-are-Fated restriction rules it out, but... if someone could concoct a decent justification and setting for that relationship, I&#39;d be very interested in seeing it done. Because there&#39;s no reason it <i>couldn&#39;t</i> happen, apart from the Fated one.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve found three stories that fit my b) requirement (still hoping for one that actually uses the language!), but I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re, well, bad. So can someones offer opinions?<br><br>1/ <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8683894/1/Of-old-Fires">Of old Fires</a><br><br>Set, according to the A/N, <i>before</i> the Awakening at Cuivienen. Finwл has a brother, named Nбrwe, who has a sword (which he shouldn&#39;t), and... dies, for some reason. I&#39;m not really sure what happens in this story.<br><br>2/ <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5607556/1/Legends-and-Crazy-Elves">Legends and Crazy Elves</a><br><br>Set at Cuivienen. The word <i>mellon</i> is derived from melons. Since this actually discusses language, I&#39;d love to throw Rвmwк at it - but since it butchers language and culture alike, I&#39;m unable to see past that to decide if it&#39;s actually funny (since it /is/ supposed to be humour). Someone with less investment in the Silm than me - what do you think?<br><br>3/ <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9618065/1/More-Today-Than-Yesterday">More Today Than Yesterday</a><br><br>Starts at Cuivienen, and then falls into Modern Earth. It completely lacks in plot, and has... well, this:<br><br><i>&quot;Elwe seems to have met some elf friend of his from Cuivienen. They&#39;re crying and hugging and kissing and talking in their other language - &quot;<br><br>&quot;Excuse me, kissing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It sure looks dangerous, but we did have that talk before. My point is, Elwe might not come home without the kid.&quot;</i><br><br>So yeah. My main issue here is that they&#39;re explicitly speaking English after Chapter 1, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything for Rвmwк to do. It also lacks anything I could bully into being a Geographical Aberration. Aaaaaand, yeah, the main charge is &#39;author appears to be a Christian fundamentalist&#39;, which a) isn&#39;t a charge (since we don&#39;t comment on the authors!), and b) we don&#39;t touch religious fic anyway.<br><br>I&#39;m kind of hoping #2 is deemed bad, honestly. It has a &#39;woodland village&#39; for Huinesoron to burn down, and rampant abuse of language. I&#39;m just worried it might be funny... ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I’m psychically unable to waste my time by reading more than a few random sentences of the third fic, so there’s no comment here. (That’s probably bad news for my future agents; they will never get to work if I can’t read badfic.)<br><br>I didn’t laugh when a read the second fic, but this doesn’t tell you much, because I generally don’t like teenage prankster stories.<br><br>Where did you get the impression that the first fic is set before the Awakening at Cuivienen? From what I see in the fic and know from the <i>Silmarillion</i>, this probably happened when the elves left Cuivienen or on their way westward. To me the A/N seem to be an attempt to explain the author’s belief that <i>Finwe and the other “first elves”</i> (some of whom got canonical siblings) weren’t actually the first elves, but may not remember their parents. In the second fic, Finwл, Ingwл, and Elwл got parents for the same reason: the authors didn’t understand how some of the first elves could be considered to be siblings if they weren’t children of the same parents.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The story clearly takes place during the March - but the author thinks differently. The summary reads &#39;In the beginning there was... well, let us first assume there was a beginning at all&#39;; the A/N says &#39;I doubt Finwe and the other &quot;first elves&quot; simple appeared on the face of earth. Perhaps they simply cannot remember the beginning. Or don&#39;t want to.&#39; It&#39;s clearly implying that this story takes place before the (recorded) beginning of the story. Cuivienen is the place where &#39;the... &quot;first elves&quot; simpl[y] appeared on the face of earth&#39;; by its own description, this story <i>can&#39;t</i> take place anywhere other than before the Awakening.<br><br>(The question of whether the three emissaries to Aman were of the first generation of Quendi is an unresolved one; I&#39;ve postulated <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Theory10.htm">here</a> that they were, drawing on the lack of mention of parents, and discussed how they can be called &#39;brothers&#39;, but honestly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Arda">there were years</a> between the Awakening and the emissaries being taken to Aman; 52 Valian Years, which could be either 520 or <i>7500</i> Years of the Sun (depending on the number you use; I&#39;d prefer the former). The Eldar marry early, come of age at 50 YotS, and have their children early, too; given that the Firstborn awoke as full adults with their wives beside them, there could easily have been five full-grown generations between the Awakening and the Great March)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Interesting, but I can poke one little hole in that one: Frodo did see Galadriel&#39;s ring for himself. From &quot;The Mirror of Galadriel&quot;:<br><br><i>[Eдrendil&#39;s] rays glanced upon a ring about her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Elven-star had come down to rest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood.</i><br><br>From the above passage, we know that at least Nenya has a stone, just like Gandalf said. They talk a bit more about rings, and she implies that Elrond knows about hers (if not all the Three). She also seems to identify Frodo&#39;s ring as the One Ring. Not necessarily conclusive, but I&#39;d think she knows what she&#39;s talking about.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>We know <i>Nenya</i> has a stone - but we also know it&#39;s made of silver, and connected to water. Why should we extrapolate one thing and not the others?<br><br>And, again: Galadriel has never laid eyes on the One. Of course she <i>thinks</i> it&#39;s the One Ring - she&#39;s a mind reader, the entire Fellowship is absolutely positive it is. Except, oh yeah, the person who&#39;d know otherwise is dead. ;)<br><br>And again, she probably knows of the <i>existence</i> of Narya... but she was in Lorien when the Three were made, so there&#39;s no reason she should have ever seen it. It was worn by Gil-Galad, so Elrond <i>could</i> have seen it... but the Three weren&#39;t worn during the War of the Last Alliance, because the One was active in the world. So it&#39;s quite likely Elrond didn&#39;t know his king had even <i>one</i> Ring of Power until he gave it to him. There&#39;s no reason to think he&#39;d ever seen Narya; Gandalf doesn&#39;t seem to have worn it very often.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It could take place on a pre-Cuivienen, metaphysical journey from Dreaming to Awakening.  And whatshisname, the brother, never made that journey, never Awakened, and so now only remains in Finwл&#39;s dreams.  Or something.  (That&#39;s why everything has a confused, abstract  feel to it, like a half-remembered dream.)<br><br>Well, that was my impression anyway.

            <p>The pre-Cuivienen fic is bad.  Any fic where the reader doesn&#39;t even have the faintest idea what&#39;s going on is usually bad, unless the author is very, very good - and this one isn&#39;t.  (e.g. If the Elves don&#39;t remember their pre-Cuivienen lives, how come Fineл remembers enough to compare Nбrwe with Fлanor?)<br><br>The <i>mellon </i>fic is fairly funny.  Not great, but mediocre fic rather than actual badfic.  (Although it hits my personal berserk button of giving Elwл a literal grey cloak, when I prefer to think of it just being a poetic reference to his grey hair.  I hate people who take everything in stories literally!)<br><br>The third one is really bad, just because of the way it totally destroys all canon.  Even if Elwл and co. do eventually return to Cuivienen, they&#39;ve changed so much, there&#39;s no way they&#39;ll be able to resume their roles in the story,  And even though there&#39;s not much for Rвmwк to do, that could be the joke, as he gets more and more frustrated at being left on the sidelines, playing second fiddle to Despatch.<br><br>(OTOH the Christianity didn&#39;t bother me too much, since it&#39;s only a brief reference.  And it&#39;s not too far out of character for these Elves to learn to worship God/Eru compared to, for example, worshipping Satan/Melkor.  And IMHO the &quot;kissing&quot; line seemed more like clumsy humour about over-protective parents, rather than an attempt to preach.)  <br><br>Hope that helps.<br></p>

            <p>The problem with the first one as a mission is that... well, I don&#39;t have any idea what was going on. <sup>-^</sup> How can I write a mission when I can&#39;t understand the story?<br><br>The problem with the <i>third</i> one is that nothing, uh, happens. Also, it would require Despatch, not DOGA, so having it as a hS mission would be difficult. (Another problem with it is that Elwe is apparently 37 in it - yet acts like a human teenager. These are <i>Quendi</i> we&#39;re talking about; slow physical aging does not equal slow mental aging)<br><br>The second one... hah, got it. Since it&#39;s a borderline case, I&#39;ll send in Kyaris from Intel, with DOGA/SIELU specialists. There we are, I have a Mission 5.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>if somebody manages it, I have a suggestion for a story.<br><br>A flower mission from before humans came along. Probably would be better if we could find some older badfic, perhaps one published in a fanzine. Back then, the Flowers were more concerned with plothole stabilization, rather then canon purity, which would require some humor beyond the usual &quot;Oh god, it&#39;s so bad, I bash my head into the wall.&quot; Besides, since hS has written the most about the past, he seems the most qualified to write this kind of story. Bonus points for a lack of technology/terminology that we are used to today.<br><br>Anyway, just a thought.</p>

However, it is more important that you present a complete and well-rounded idea than that you slavishly adhere to word counts - a well-written 950 or 350-word piece is far more useful than a rambling and purposeless 600 words.&#39;. </p>

            <p>I am forming a huge idea conglomeration which will probably settle down once I start writing actual stories.

His optimism is a problem, and his partner is slow to trust.<br><br>I don&#39;t want the wiki to have Smoke Z Dimensia as my name in the PPC.

            <p>For one thing, having both prompts prepared when you ask for Permission is kind of important, since it shows, among other things, your ability to understand and follow directions. For another, I like to know what I&#39;m giving people the okay to go ahead and do. These requirements are not being met. The one prompt you did write isn&#39;t about the main team you&#39;re going to be using. Additionally, you left a struck-through and rewritten line of dialogue in there, which tells me it&#39;s not even finished—or if it is, that&#39;s a pretty glaring editing oversight. You shouldn&#39;t need a beta to catch that. All of this is just screaming &quot;not prepared&quot; to me. Lots of ideas is good, but if you want to avoid being one of those people who gets Permission and never does anything with it, you&#39;ll have to actually settle on some.<br><br>Also, I&#39;d like to point out that targeting people who like you is probably not a great idea. Why don&#39;t you try giving them concrit instead? If they like your work, they might actually listen to your advice.<br><br>In a nutshell: <b>Permission Denied</b>. Please try again when you have a complete, cohesive request for us.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I re-uploaded the prompt file even though I cannot see any strikethrough either today or yesterday.  In fairness to you, I suppose that it is professional to send a standard rejection notice when a manuscript has been chewed on by the post office.<br><br>As far as targeting people who like me, it&#39;s more of a case of simply not checking or not letting it stop me.

            <p>Sorry to see you&#39;ve been rejected.<br><br>If you don&#39;t mind me making a comment....<br><br>It looks like you&#39;re making one of the mistakes Dark Brother 16 did.  You&#39;re trying to pitch a huge, complicated, epic, crossover story arc that just happens to feature a whole bunch of PPC agents.  So the PGs are a bit overwhelmed with all the information you expect them to take in at once.  And you&#39;re so busy planning the big sweep of the arc, it can look like you&#39;re neglecting all the little details.<br><br>Maybe it would help if you take a step back.  Simplify things, at least at first.  Start with just a couple of agents in your request, no more, showing you can write those agents well.  And just add a quick mention that you&#39;ve plans to introduce other agents or teams in the long term and that the PGs can ask you for more information if they need it.<br><br>(Remember, once you&#39;ve been given Permission, you don&#39;t need extra Permission to introduce extra characters.) <br><br>That&#39;s what I did, and it worked for me.  I got the permission, and no-one even bothered to contact me and ask what my long term plans are.  (Admittedly they&#39;re not as big or ambitious as yours, but the PGs didn&#39;t know that...)<br></p>

            <p>Just a post to say. <br>Remember this day 70 years ago, when soldiers from the Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy in the biggest amphibious assault in history, unsure who would live and who would die as bullets strafed the beaches. Remember the paratroopers who gave their lives to take Pegasus Bridge. Remember this day, when the US Rangers scaled the cliffs and took Point Du Hoc, to ease the firepower that would be directed at both Omaha and Utah beaches. Remember all those who died on Juno, Sword, Gold, Utah and Omaha<br>Remember on this day, those who gave their lives to end the War. <br><br>Remember this day.</p>

            <p>Pointe Du Hoc is a headland that overlooks the English Channel and is the highest point between Utah and Omaha beaches, the germans fortified it and put in place large guns which, if left alone would of inflicted heavy casualties on both Utah and Omaha beaches. Thankfully due to bombing raids the majority of the large guns had been removed from their original positions, but to prevent it from being used by the Germans, and to make sure the guns were destroyed three companies of the 2nd Ranger Battalion attacked the Pointe. Landing at the bottom of the cliffs and scaling them using rope ladders the Rangers engaged the Germans holding the point and found and destroyed the six guns that remained at the Pointe They then held the point against German counter-attacks for two days before reinforcements from Omaha beach arrived. (Wikipedia Link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointe_du_Hoc"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointe_du_Hoc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointe_du_Hoc</a></a>)<br><br>Pegasus bridge, is a bridge that crosses the Caen Canal, between Caen and Ouistreham, in Normandy, France. On the night of the 5th June 1944 181 men of the British 6th Airborne Division took off in 6 Horsa Gliders to capture Pegasus Bridge (or as it was known then, Benouville Bridge) and Horsa Bridge (then known as Ranville Bridge), to prevent German Armour from crossing the bridges and hitting the eastern flank of the landings on Sword Beach. Five of the Gliders landed near Pegasus Bridge just after midnight, completely surprising the Germans defending the bridge and they took it in 10 minutes, only losing two men (one of whom drowned when his glider landed in a nearby pond, the other was shot down crossing the bridge, becoming the first allied soldier to die on D-Day) before holding on to the bridge until reinforcements arrived, first paratroopers who arrived a few hours after the landings and then the landing force itself. The sixth glider landed 7 miles off but they snuck through enemy lines and joined up with British forces later.

            <p>Um, hello...My name is glassed, but you can call me G or T. Well, I kind of get the general view of the whole thing (since I don&#39;t have much time to read all of it. *sobs*), so I hope I won&#39;t end up doing something stupid in here...or something. Uh, my fandoms are KHR, FMA, Detective Conan, Hetalia, and (somewhat) Letter Bee. Though the main fandom nowadays is KHR for some reasons I don&#39;t know--probably because of the many plotholes in the series and stuffs. Also be warned, I&#39;m kind of a socially-awkward and take-things-too-seriously kind of girl and kind of busy with school--so espect weird and slow replies from me.<br><br>Trivial detail(s): not a horror-movie fan and a full-blooded(?) Indonesian that speaks both Bahasa and American-English a bit odd-sounding ones.<br><br>Well, I hope we all can get along. <sup>^</sup></p>

            <p>I put a question mark after it because I&#39;m not so sure if &quot;full-blood&quot; is even a word.

            <p>A lot.

Ahhh, classical music.

            <p>It looks like the cruising speed on R101 (as a random sample airship) is about 60mph. To cover the 5000 miles from London to Spaceport America would only take four days flat-out; stopping off in New York (to moor to the Empire State, naturally) wouldn&#39;t add much distance. You&#39;re right, I clearly need to retake that picture.<br><br>I deliberately left all the names off, because it seems more fun that way. ;) Possibilities are Dann, Araeph, AW, Hellga or BiD (they both pop in occasionally), ehm... Elcalion and VixenMage, maybe? I forget when VM joined. Basically it&#39;s four so that it&#39;s <i>not</i> just hS-Kaitlyn-Nesh. (Kaitlyn says she&#39;s Gimli, by the way)<br><br>The films (and the TV series! I hear they&#39;re discussing reviving it for Series 6, but given the disaster that was 5, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good plan) would definitely have been put on silent after the first couple of runs. So they&#39;re just background colour.

            <p>So as you all know I&#39;m a rabid superhero fan. Some of you could also gather from my username that I&#39;m a Hetalia Fan. I&#39;ve been chewing on an idea for a while now that combines both things. It&#39;s called the United Nations Task Force, when supernatural events start rising, and terriost groups reaching higher, the World Council creates a plan. To select one Representative from each country, to help protect innocent lives. I&#39;ll hopefully start working on it after I finsh Order Of Order. In Order to do this However I&#39;m going to need some OC&#39;s or idea&#39;s for a charcters powers and backstory. I thought it might be fun to ask the PPC. There are two rules: The charcter has to have a human name, unless you want them to only go by their Codename (Which is simply their country name)  Two, No Mary Sues. Nyo charcters are allowed, and even encouraged. Any kind of   powers are welcome, but not nessasary. I can also accept ideas for pontential stories.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently working on an original fic (or rather a series of short stories) that has at it heart two teams of seven superheroes. (It&#39;s where Apollo comes from). I&#39;m quite willing to let you have any of them, if you want them. I have a guy who utilises Force Fields, a girl who can become invisible and intangible, another girl who can transform into any inanimate object, a telekinetic, an echokietic, a pyrokinetic, a telepath, Apollo (see his profile) a girl who can control and manipulate clouds and fog, a standard super strong dude, a shadowkinetic, a girl who can fly (and has bird physiology), a guy who can create light from any part of his body and a hydrokinetic. Pick any of those you want and I can give you their full profile.<br><br></p>

            <p>As I&#39;ve probably mentioned ad nauseam on this Board, I have been working on a crossover between Pokйmon and Bakugan Battle Brawlers, called <i>The Vexos Chronicles</i>. It is currently nine chapters long, with a tenth on the way...<br><br>and that&#39;s where things have ground to a halt. Even though my beta <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=259220;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">recently popped up to say that he isn&#39;t dead,</a> I haven&#39;t heard a peep from him since, and I&#39;ve tried to get ahold of him. So is there anyone able to help me until poor Outhra climbs out of whatever plothole he fell into?<br><br>Here&#39;s the rundown: Chapter 10 takes place in Kanto, so no knowledge of Bakugan is needed (though it would be highly appreciated), but knowledge of Pokemon is required (preferably animeverse, though knowledge of gamesverse is also useful), as well as knowledge of what makes for good storytelling. If anyone is interested, please <a href="mailto:sonofheaven176@gmail.com">email me</a>.<br><br>Thanks in advance for helping me out while my beta deals with whatever is going on at his end.</p>

            <p>What were your first experiences with fanfiction?  What was the first one you read?  What was the first one you wrote?<br><br>My first experiences with writing fanfiction came before I knew that there was such a thing.  I started banging out a horrible Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fic on a manual typewriter.  Then I started something on our first computer in a dos word processor: it blended early Pegasus series with X-men, flavored like history about the Underground Railroad and <s>The Diary of Anne Frank</s> Number the Stars.<br><br>Then my Mary-Sue came after that and I never developed the world into something I was happy with.  There were ripoffs, but they were subtle enough.<br><br>Years later, my first experience reading fanfiction was that I was paid to drive someone to a tiny convention and asked to guard the boxes of fanfiction.  Naturally, as a teenager, I pulled something from the sexy box to entertain myself with.<br><br>I joined Fanfiction.net in spring of 2004, which means I learned that online fanfiction was actually a thing shortly beforehand.</p>

            <p>I was looking online for information about the last book in the series and found something that was most certainly NOT canon, but I read it and wanted to read more. And then I wondered if there was anything for Harry Potter, and it was like I&#39;d found a buried treasure chest. It was so amazing- and then I saw one summary that looked pretty good, though I didn&#39;t know what the word at the end, &#39;yaoi&#39;, meant.<br><br>That kind of scared me off for a few months. <br><br>Then I thought, if all these people can write Harry Potter fanfiction, I wanted to do it, too. I&#39;m still hoping to one day complete the fifteen-part series I have planned out, but first I think I&#39;ll go back and rewrite the first two and a half stories I already did. The OC isn&#39;t super-Sued, but it could definitely use work. Her Marauder nickname is <i>Ebony</i>. That probably tells you enough... <sup>_<sup>&#39;</sup></sup></p>

            <p>I first started reading fanfiction either on K/Sarchive or the House squidge archive. It may have been K/S, introduced to me from the wikipedia page (my first ever ship, followed by Huddy from House MD)<br>I think my first fanfictions were K/S. I was being bullied at the time so I ended up reading a lot more M-rated stuff than I probably should have at the age of ten. It was my refuge, and I still struggle with an unhealthy addiction with the stuff.<br>My first fanfiction was a Warrior Cats/House MD fusion (yes, yes, quite seriously) and it was AWFUL. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. Thankfully I never posted it. The other fics I wrote and actually posted were actually awful. <br>The fanfiction.net/ao3 handle LightDarkPheonix comes from my obsession with phoenixes, the misspelling dates all the way back to my second account on FF.net (I abandoned my first one because of aforementioned House MD badfics).<br>To my frustration I can never show what I write to my parents because they a)think all fanfiction is 200k of NSFU stuff b)they seem to be opposed to gay pairings, despite not being homophobic, and all of my fics are gay pairings.<br></p>

            <p>I only learned about fanfiction in maybe 2008. I believe the Sprout was already born. it could have been a year or so before that though, I am absolutely horrible with hammering events into a timeline. (I got the idea to check when I made the ffnet account, but CANNOT get logged in. Serious aggravation.)<br><br>I belonged to a writing group aimed at authors trying to get published. When someone mentioned fanfiction. I of course had to check it out.<br><br>I honestly have no idea why I ever tried it a second time. Maybe morbid curiosity. Maybe I have a masochistic streak?<br><br>Being the first time I read a fanfic, I had no idea what all those terms that are common in summaries meant. This a couple of clean-up-TOS-breaking-fics purges ago on ffnet, so  I blithely go to the LOTR section and limit it to Faramir fics.<br><br>Let&#39;s just leave it as that I learned what slash meant, and I&#39;ve always really, really wished those fics hadn&#39;t gotten purged so that I could hit them with the Department of Bad Slash. <br><br>I&#39;ve still never really gotten into reading LOTR fanfic. I tried NCIS eventually and Stargate and the rest is history. <br><br><br><br>Now, not really fanfic, but when I was younger I had a seriously overactive imagination that would scare me at night, so I would make up stories. Mostly about Star Trek TOS, ironically enough. (No, I&#39;m not THAT old. It was on re-runs, but this <i>was</i> before Next Generation.) I never wrote any of those down. When I got up into about 5th grade I took characters that I liked from TV shows, kept basically the names and personalities and stuck them all into my own original world. Even as a little kid is made me uncomfortable to be messing about in someone else&#39;s sandbox like that. I&#39;ve only started writing fanfic this year, because of that.<br><br>Later, I changed their names and everything else until they had no resemblance, but the origins all go back to a ridiculously bad one season cop show that I obsessed over in 5th grade. Benjamin Bratt was on that show though, so you know, hey I still think he&#39;s good looking. Maybe it wasn&#39;t so ridiculous, even though I didn&#39;t really think in those terms then.<br></p>

            <p>My Fanfiction experience... The memories.<br><br>I wrote my first fanfic before I read any. My first one was a Skyrim fic. It&#39;s called Skyrim Allegiance, and I am currently redeveloping it, along with just about all my fics. I will need them later for Imaginations Collide, but they are currently not so good. I wrote them a few years back, took a break, then read them again. But, I&#39;m pretty confident that I never wrote a Mary Sue or Gary Stu. I got close a few times, but never actually did it.<br><br>The first fanfic I wrote was also a Skyrim story. I forget the title, but it&#39;s dead now. It was a story about an OC rebuilding the Dark Brotherhood by accepting numerous OC&#39;s from readers. I submitted one, too. A psychotic who would brutally murder anyone he was attracted to. I believe his name was Nikita Contortus.<br><br>And that is my fanfiction experience. </p>

            <p>My first experience of fanfiction was around 1999 or 2000, when I discovered the alt.drwho.creative newsgroup, back in its heyday.  I loved reading the &quot;IA&quot; (Internet Adventure) round robin fics, where writers would take it in turns to write one chapter each.  The group also had Jerri Massi&#39;s &quot;Always the Third Doctor&quot; fics, and the surreal alternate universe of &quot;This Time Round&quot;.  Great stuff.<br><br>But I only lurked, and never joined in.  Like I said before, for me creative writing was just something we were forced to do at school, and not anything I could ever imagine myself doing if I didn&#39;t have to!<br></p>

            <p>Star Fox is where I started, although I can&#39;t give you a precise date or time.<br>I&#39;ve been working on the same fic for what, years, now and am apparently fated to never get anywhere with it.

            <p>My first encounter with fanfiction was sometime in the 80s, thanks to an acquaintance who collected PWP fanzines.  (And badly written PWP at that -- I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t think porn is supposed to bore the reader.)  It took me longer to start reading internet fanfiction, because I had to figure out that there were non-porn fics first.<br><br>Writing ... while I&#39;ve got several ideas, I haven&#39;t posted anything.  A lot of my &quot;write fiction&quot; impulse gets channeled into writing gaming scenarios instead.</p>

            <p>It all began with <i>The Light Fantastic</i>. Waaay back in the last milennium, a schoolfriend suggested I should read it. I did, and now I own every single Discworld novel. ;)<br><br>After some time, I was browsing Discworld sites on the internet (I remember <a href="http://www.lspace.org/">The L-Space Web</a> in particular), and happened across a small Discworld fanfic site. Well, I know <i>now</i> it was small... at the time, it was the only one I knew existed.<br><br>At around the same time, I was producing unshared self-insert fics of my own, in Pern and Star Wars (and possibly a couple of others... not sure). I still have them somewhere - they&#39;re pretty bad.<br><br>Late in 2002, I developed an actual online presence, in the form of my very first email address - and yes, that was when I became Huinesoron. I created a Hotmail account in order to talk to a friend about <i>The Two Towers</i> over the Christmas holidays. As you can see, I was already a big <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan - I&#39;d read it since I was a child - but hadn&#39;t yet started on the histories.<br><br>Then, and it must have been around the same time, another friend (that&#39;s three, if you&#39;re counting!) noticed me on the Discworld fanfic site and directed me to Fanfiction.net. My mind practically exploded, and it didn&#39;t take long for me to abandon Discworld fanfic to its fate (though I still retain a certain fondness for it - hence my writing <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9130619/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Discworld">OFUDisc</a>) and dive headlong into the LotR section.<br><br>My first published story came about in March 2003, because I was bored at a Scout meeting. We were making pancakes - which means, two people were making pancakes at any one time while the rest of us stood around - and I decides to write something; I put Legolas in it because I knew he was the most popular character.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1259630/1/Pancakes">Pancakes!</a> hit fifty chapters. It has over a thousand reviews. I&#39;d say that &#39;popular&#39; thing worked. :D<br><br>The next step came about because I couldn&#39;t spell. Well, I could spell <i>most</i> things - but I was positive that Legolas&#39; father was named &#39;Thanduril&#39; (as opposed to &#39;Thranduil&#39;; my entire family did the same thing with a certain headmaster named &#39;Dumblemore&#39;). So Thanduril went into a story - I forget which - and someone pointed out that he was a mini-Balrog. They directed me to OFUM, which I devoured.<br><br>It was through OFUM that I found the PPC stories, which I also devoured - and I was nowhere near to getting full. Vaguely inspired by Jay and Acacia, I started writing a spinoff to &#39;Pancakes!&#39;, about <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1504807/1/ISPCE-Protecting-Elves-Everywhere">an organisation named Ispace</a>.<br><br>This very Board noticed me, in the person of Vemi, and on September 8th, 2003, Hellga (I&#39;d forgotten that fact, but the review is definitely her) invited me to come join the Board. On a dark autumn&#39;s evening, I looked it up - and found that Vemi assumed I was female. ;) So my first post was protesting that I was actually male, and not ripping the PPC off, honest.<br><br>And... I stuck around. I made friends - within three months I was chatting regularly over MSN with Kaitlyn, who I eventually married. I founded a new department (DOGA) early in 2004, started writing Histories very soon after... and just kept on sticking around. Now I&#39;m far and away the most prolific PPC writer (though not with the most missions).<br><br>My <i>other</i> fanfic hasn&#39;t been quite as numerous. By April &#39;04 I&#39;d completely stopped writing, and when I resumed, I made a <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/~cloakedeagle">new account</a> to escape my fangirls (oh yes, I had fangirls). That was September &#39;04.<br><br>The last significant change came in 2005. <i>The Reorganisation</i> had stalled out some months earlier, and I was on a hiatus of sorts. Somewhere in that break, <i>something</i> must have happened to change my writing style. Everything before that point, I cringe a little to re-read; everything after it, I&#39;m okay with. I think it was at that point - after the hiatus, when I picked up Reorg again (by myself; no cowriter) - that I started writing Narto and Lou&#39;s missions. They&#39;re all in the new style, I believe.<br><br>So that&#39;s me. Didn&#39;t expect <i>quite</i> that many words, huh?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My first experience with fanfiction came, oddly enough, while I was in my second year of law school, so in a few months, it will be three years since I&#39;ve read my first fanfic!<br><br>IIRC, I first <i>heard</i> of fanfic while I was much younger.

I remembered that snippet of information and started looking for Animorphs fanfic. I eventually ran across an unfinished goodfic by Blue Dragon: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/313894/1/The-Kelbrid-War-How-to-shatter-trust">The Kelbrid War: How to shatter trust</a>. TVTropes eventually led me to the PPC.<br><br>Of course, I&#39;ve only recently started <i>writing</i> fanfiction; I have a crossover in the works. It is a Bakugan/Pokemon crossover titled <i>The Vexos Chronicles</i>. I have quite a few stories planned for the series (yes, it will be a series, God willing), and hopefully, my entry into fanfiction will be with a bang.</p>

            <p>I wrote my first two in fifth grade. One was a Pokemon fanfic in which a girl got sucked into the anime (rewritten many times since and still messy) and the second one was a Neopets fic intended to be a grand tropical/alien adventure. I think.<br><br>My first experience reading fanfiction was probably on the website &quot;The Cave of Dragonflies.&quot; It has a whole section devoted to the author&#39;s fanfiction, which is pretty good if sometimes morbid. I particularly remember her two longer fanfics, &quot;The Quest for the Legends&quot; and &quot;Morphic&quot;, as inspiring to me. I still have a large Word file on my computer containing profiles for twelve different human/Pokemon hybrid OCs I&#39;ve not really written a story for. (I&#39;d make one a prospective agent if I weren&#39;t slightly convinced I wrote a band of Sues and Stus.)<br><br>Also, I think I joined deviantART around the same time (2011/2012). The first fanfic on the site I liked enough to favorite a chapter of was &quot;Follow Me&quot; by SakuraMota (read it, it&#39;s good). She inspired me, avid Soul-as-player/Silver shipper I was, to write a fic of my own starring them. (It&#39;s currently two and a half chapters long, outlined for far longer, and awaiting a rewrite as a college AU. Don&#39;t ask.)</p>

            <p>That was... a long time ago...<br><br>Technically I&#39;ve been writing fanfiction since I was about eight in the form of poems, but I didn&#39;t think of it like that. Still, it&#39;s rather pleasant to be able to look back at what is technically my first fanfic and bathe in the roaring success that turned out to be. Much better than all the Redwall drivel I followed it up with. When I was twelve I happened to mention it to my mom and she explained the concept of fan fiction to me. A couple of years later I was looking for a guide on molespeech and ran across an online Redwall-based community, which I joined without hesitation. Most of the stuff on that site was badfic, and I&#39;ve actually considered linking the whole fanfic page board-wards, except some of my first work was on it and I&#39;m too embarrassed to let anyone see. (Even though it deserves sporkage.)<br><br>About the time I started writing LotR and Star Wars fanfic I quit the internet for a while, and when I came back I&#39;d improved significantly. Among other things I had started writing original fiction and figured out that no, actually, Mary Sues weren&#39;t such a great type of character.<br><br>I don&#39;t actually remember what happened next very clearly, but it involved a lot of anonymous stalking of ff.net and AO3 as well as *grimace* written guides on determining what exactly is in a fanfic by the summary and title. (Fortunately I never managed to share these with anyone.)<br><br>Anyway, I guess that sort of brings me up to the present, where my primary form of recreation is writing songs making fun of bad fanfic. And writing introspective pieces I never finish.<br><br>The first fanfiction I read that I remember was some Redwall piece that had a tolerably good story and pretty neat characters but was almost as unintelligible as My Immortal. I wish I could find it again, because in hindsight it was pretty amusing. (At the time I was still naпve enough to believe everyone could spell words like father, so it all came as something of a shock.)<br><br>The first fanfic I wrote (while knowing it was fanfic) was a weird take on a Rose!Lives that I am forever ashamed of. I retained some of the ideas, though, and twisted it into another story that is pretty much unrecognizable as the same story and almost doesn&#39;t even qualify as a Rose!Lives anymore. So technically I&#39;m still writing it. But not really.<br><br>Slightly amusing unrelated: I told some dude that I wrote fanfiction in one conversation. In a different conversation, I mentioned that I didn&#39;t appreciate reading sex scenes. It was almost impossible for him to reconcile these two ideas in his head, because somewhere he got the idea that it&#39;s not technically fanfiction if it doesn&#39;t include sex.<br><br>Yet another dude, immediately upon discovering that I wrote fanfiction, demanded to know whether or not I shipped. His definition of shipping turned out to be Aragorn/Legolas.<br><br>I think people who do not read or write fanfiction don&#39;t actually know what it is.</p>

            <p>I first really came across fanfiction in about September 2012, Up til then the only thing I really did online was RP, then one of my friends from the site I RPed on mentioned fanfiction, I think he was talking about some Pokemon fanfic or something, and I decided to check it out although I quickly became more interested in Harry Potter fanfiction. It also coincided with another person I knew advertising their writings on fictionpress via the same forums and so I became interested in fanfiction.<br><br>My first attempt at writing fanfiction can currently be found on the Claimed Badfic list, which gives you an idea of how bad it was. The spelling and grammar for the first half of it or so is appalling and the latter half is only a bit better. It also included entering 2 new races into the Harry Potter continuum (Succubi and Elves if you&#39;re wondering) re-hashed quite a bit of magical history, although I did try and work it into the gaps left by canon. Oh and I created the &quot;most adorable mini-Aragog&quot;, Hugglepuff. <br><br>I can&#39;t remember the first bit of fanfiction I read, but one of the fanfics I did read early on, and can remember was The Return of the Marauders by TheLastZion. I re-read it occasionally, it&#39;s got bad grammar at points and some of the characters do have some Sue-ish traits amongst other things, but as an early fanfic writer it did inspire me, and make me aspire to become a better writer.<br><br>On the topic of early fanfics, whilst I was looking at joining the PPC I browsed the Unclaimed List a couple of times. And on looking down the Unclaimed badifc list, I noted a HP fanfic named &quot;Harry Potter and the Guardian of Hogwarts&quot;, which to most people doesn&#39;t mean much. To me however, whose first fanfic was called &quot;Harry Potter and the Guardians of Hogwarts&quot; it freaked me out for a bit, before I realized it was a completely different fic.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br>Who&#39;s trip down memory lane has sufficiently distracted him from revision.</p>

            <p>I think I first learned fanfiction was a thing in middle school, thanks to the <i>Creatures</i> computer games. That would be about 1998, give or take. That was also about the time I was learning the Internet was a thing, and spent my some of my free time hanging out in MSN chat rooms and stuff. (Hey guys, who else remembers a/s/l queries being commonplace and not automatically creepy and stalkerish?)<br><br>Somehow, I made my way to a <i>Creatures</i> fan forum and found that people had written stories based on the games. It kind of blew my mind. I don&#39;t remember any specific thoughts, but I used up a lot of paper printing off a particularly good series of long-ish fics—and I still have them! I was already something of a writer (so my parents and teachers told me!), so fanfic seemed like an awesome way for me to get involved in the community. I started writing my own fic pretty damn quick, but I never finished it. Middle school was not a great time for me writing-wise, at least not until the 8th grade, when I actually had a competent English teacher.<br><br>1999-2000, my freshmen year in high school, was when I got into <i>Farscape</i>, though, and that changed everything. I got involved with a little Pilot fansite called FaDoP (Friends and Defenders of Pilot), and they were the most amazing group of people I&#39;d ever met online. Fanfic was definitely in, and I wrote up a decent-length fic—about 20 pages, single-spaced with indented paragraphs, definitely the longest thing I&#39;d ever written at the time. And that one I actually <i>finished</i>, with an alternative ending and a sequel, even.<br><br>And that&#39;s how I learned about Mary Sues. <sup>_<sup><br><br>The</sup></sup> FaDoPer who pointed out that my OC might be a Sue did so in pretty much the nicest way possible. I think they were going by the then-standard &quot;idealized version of the author/person the author wishes they could be&quot; definition, to which I agreed that, yep, that sounded about right! I was a bit defensive about it, as I recall, so my agreement was sort of a passive-aggressive attempt to own whatever so-called &quot;flaws&quot; people were finding with my work <s>which was obviously perfect</s>, thereby transmuting them into deliberate style choices <i>that I totally did on purpose for a reason so don&#39;t judge me</i>... but still, at least I didn&#39;t throw a tantrum or anything.<br><br>Anyway, I think I found out about fanfiction.net from my fellow writing-inclined FaDoPers, and that <i>Farscape</i> fic is the first thing I posted there. Apparently this was in early 2002, which I&#39;m pretty sure is a good bit after I actually wrote it, but that&#39;s beside the point.<br><br>By then I was heavily involved in role-playing, mostly on Neopets, and I wrote a handful of fics inspired by or directly based on what I was getting up to in RPs. In particular, I started writing a massive <i>Harry Potter</i> epic... that I never finished. I think I discovered OFUM not very long after discovering ff.net, and through OFUM I found the PPC, so I&#39;d heard of &quot;canon,&quot; and I wanted my story to harmonize the events of the RP with the books as much as possible, so when new books came out and changed everything, it was difficult to recover my momentum.<br><br>Plus, by 2004 I was pretty entrenched on the Board, and PPC stuff took over a good bit of my free time. I remember starting and never finishing a fair few fics between 2003 and 2006-ish, but since I&#39;m pretty sure they were all garbage, that doesn&#39;t bother me. I did write another <i>Farscape</i> fic in 2005, after the miniseries came out, and I&#39;ve poked at the Epic Potter RP Fic, but basically my interest in writing my own fanfic petered out in favor of writing PPC stuff. It&#39;s a lot more fun writing for an audience who knows you, likes you, and is generally willing to give meaningful feedback. And here we are!<br><br>~Neshomeh, who wrote a lot in this post, jeez.</p>

            <p>The faq that I poked had an explanation about how the Ring would drag the wearer into partially into the spirit realm.
