            <p>&quot;Your challenge is to write crossover fanfiction combining <i>Kill Bill</i> and <i>Dilbert</i>. The story should use floods as a plot device!&quot;<br><br><i>So, I probably don&#39;t know</i> Dilbert <i>well enough to do this quite properly; this is based more on wikipedia research than anything.  In fact, I&#39;ll go on record that I dislike Scott Adams for his misogynistic comments, and probably would have skipped this prompt, except that it wound up paired with a movie that&#39;s all about empowered women.  And, hey, it&#39;s a crackfic anyway, so . . .</i> Dilbert <i>belongs to Scott Adams and</i> Kill Bill <i>belongs to Quentin Tarantino.</i><br><br>Wally was on his way to his third restroom break of the hour.  Up ahead, Alice had just turned the knob to the ladies&#39; room when a massive wave of water threw open the door and splashed down both halves of the hallway.<br><br>As the flood passed by, Wally held his cup of coffee over his head.  he then lowered it and took a sip as he regarded Alice, laying prone on the floor before him.<br><br>Her face was contorted in fury.  &quot;WHAT.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Plumbing problems,&quot; Wally said dismissively.  &quot;Oh well.  Not the first time I&#39;ve used the parking lot.&quot;<br><br>Alice looked up at him.  &quot;Do you have no shame?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t see why I should.  I don&#39;t get for experiencing shame.&quot;  He walked over to the men&#39;s room and held the coffee cup over his head again.  With his other hand, he turned the knob and opened the door just a crack, big enough to peek through.  &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, then opened the door the rest of way, walking into the dry restroom.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding,&quot; Alice said, sitting up.  &quot;Don&#39;t tell me all the women&#39;s restrooms, and only the women&#39;s restrooms, are flooded.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Only the women&#39;s restrooms are flooded,&quot; said a very wet Tina the technical writer, walking past one end of the hallway.<br><br>Alice climbed to her feet and began marching down the hallway.  &quot;This is the last straw,&quot; she whispered hoarsely.  &quot;The last one.  The only one left.  And when I arrive at my destination, I am gonna kill Bill.&quot;<br><br>A sudden chord of dramatic music was interrupted by Wally, who had caught up to her.  &quot;Who&#39;s Bill?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Our boss.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Which one?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The one with the pointy hair.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Since when is his name Bill?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Since always!&quot;  Then Alice paused.  &quot;You got here awfully quickly.  Did you even wash your hands?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure.  Just like I do in the parking lot.&quot;<br><br>* * *
<br><br>Alice kicked open the door leading to her boss&#39;s suite, but immediately ducked as a wooden shaft flew out of the doorway.  She glared at carol, the secretary.  &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Target practice,&quot; Carol replied, loading another bolt into the crossbow.<br><br>Alice glanced at the door.  Instead of a ring target, a giant cardboard cutout of their boss was stapled to the door.  &quot;Why would you hang that on the door?&quot;<br><br>Carol shrugged.  &quot;I hoped I might get lucky.  Maybe next time.&quot;<br><br>Alice growled and charged at the other door, that led to the pointy-haired boss&#39;s office.  IgnoringCarol&#39;s angry protest, she crashed through, finding their boss behind his desk and Dilbert seated in front of it.<br><br>The boss looked confused.  &quot;I&#39;m already doing a meeting.  You have to wait your turn!&quot;<br><br>Alice ignored him.  &quot;Bill!  Why are all the women&#39;s restrooms flooding?&quot;<br><br>Dilbert raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Who&#39;s Bill?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He is!&quot;  Alice pointed at their boss.<br><br>&quot;Since when?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Since always!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It does sound familiar, yes,&quot; admitted the pointy-haired boss, &quot;although no one ever calls me by name anymore.  I don&#39;t know why.&quot;<br><br>Alice repeated her question as she stormed to the desk.  &quot;Why are all my bathrooms flooded, Bill?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, half of the bathrooms needed to be flooded.  Since only seventy-nine percent of our employees are female, the logical choice was obvious.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?  If there are more women than men, you should have flooded the men&#39;s rooms!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hm?&quot;  The boss looked puzzled.  &quot;Oh, sorry.  Seventy-nine is the percentage of the average male employee&#39;s paycheck that most of our female employees are paid.  Our workforce is only thirty-nine percent female.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why did any bathrooms need to be flooded to begin with?&quot;<br><br>Dogbert suddenly appeared from one of the white square tiles in the ceiling.  &quot;He isn&#39;t able to disclose that information at this time.  A memo will be released when the hour is right.  And then the whole world will know . . .&quot;  He retreated, slowly and ominously, and replaced the ceiling tile.<br><br>Alice huffed and leaned over the desk, grabbing her boss by his collar.  You still could have alternated which bathroom was flooded on different floors, you idiot!&quot;<br><br>He stared at her blankly.  &quot;But what if I were on a floor with a flooded men&#39;s room?&quot;<br><br>Alice began shaking, with a growl growing louder and louder in her throat.  Finally, she yelled, &quot;Five-Point-Fist of Death Exploding Heart Technique!&quot;  She dealt a series of punches into the pointy-haired boss&#39;s torso, knocking him and his chair backwards.<br><br>&quot;Oooow.  My . . . uh . . .&quot; he gestured around the center of his chest with his finger.<br><br>&quot;Heart,&quot; said Alice.<br><br>&quot;No.  Pan . . . Pangkrie?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The pancreas is lower down,&quot; said Dilbert.<br><br>&quot;Hm.  I could have sworn . . . Oh, well.  Close enough.&quot;  And he collapsed.</p>

Hello, everyone! I&#39;ve been taking some summer transfer classes for the last few months, and that, compounded with a few other RL issues I don&#39;t want to get into, meant that my week or so of near-Internetless life following the end of the spring semester turned into two months, because my life has essentially been eaten to the bone for the longest time. I didn&#39;t even announce that I&#39;d be gone, because by the time I realized I wouldn&#39;t be able to come here very often, I&#39;d already been swamped! I expect all sorts of confused messages in my e-mail inbox when I get to checking that later.<br><br>Well, that&#39;s all over now, and since it&#39;s my birthday today, my present to myself will be getting involved with this clan of wonderful people again. How&#39;s everyone been? Have there been some new developments since I&#39;ve been out? Any chance I could get a list of whatever missions have been written over the summer? I&#39;ve been starved for enjoyable reading material, and the PPC rarely disappoints.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been gone a while too, but I&#39;m back now too! May not be as frequent as I used to be, but at least I am here! I am sure the others will fill you in better then I could.<br><br>I do have one question for you though. I was gone from the Board when the season 4 finale aired. What did you think about it? I thought Tirek was cool, though a little to Gary Stu-ie for my tastes. And that new castle of Twilight&#39;s...Ew. That is horrid. I mean, the Crystal Empire at least has some class, this new crystal tree house of friendship is just gaudy. I have more to say on the finale, and season four in general, but I have to head out. I do look forward to your thoughts on it, and if you want, I would be happy to talk about how awesome this season was.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been meaning to catch up on it now that it&#39;s over and I can just marathon the whole thing on Youtube, but during the season&#39;s run, I saw, I think, three episodes, and only one of them was any good. It was probably a coincidence, and through sheer bad luck I watched two out what was probably only four or so bad episodes this season back-to-back, but it just turned me off of watching the season on the whole until the time could come for me to get a better picture of the whole thing. I mean, you shouldn&#39;t have an episode with <i>Daring Do</i> in it and get a viewer reaction comparable to &quot;I think I had a better experience watching Ticket Master than I am having right now.&quot;<br><br>As for the finale, I&#39;ve only gotten a brief collection of some of what goes on through Internet osmosis. Centaur shows up, blows up Twilight&#39;s house, eats magic, and then almost causes the apocalypse. Judging by how the original Tirek was defeated and the fact that TV commercials advertising &quot;Rainbow Ponies&quot; started cropping up shortly after the season finale aired, I&#39;m guessing he was killed by the power of multicolor merchandising, but I&#39;ve been deliberately avoiding information on that aspect in case it&#39;ll retroactively ruin other parts of the season if I find out early. I don&#39;t usually mind spoilers, but since this season seems very focused on a few specific mysteries, finding them out early might detract from the narrative.<br><br>Aw, no Fandom Pinkie birthday party? I had the chariot races ready and everything! I mean, I suppose I do have the welcome-back pastry table, but those pastries have gone a little bit stale since I&#39;ve not been here to refresh the stock.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s say an agent pair does a Pokйmon-verse mission. The Sue has a full team of six Pokйmon, but they have relatively minor faults. Maybe her shiny Togepi/starter/Eevee/whatever is highly unlikely but possible to get in a standard playthrough, or her Raichu has one move it can&#39;t learn in that region but is otherwise normal. Whatever the case, the Pokйmon are not breaking canon by existing.<br><br>After the agents kill her, are they allowed to adopt some of her team, like how you would rescue an inoffensive OC/bit character, or do they have to neuralyze and release all six Pokйmon?</p>

            <p>I think it really depends.  If they&#39;re not canon-breaking, I don&#39;t think they fall under CAF rules.  It depends on how much harm it would do to release them back into the wild, I suppose.  Would it be acceptable to treat pokemon as minis?  <br><br>Basically I follow the theory that minis are all semi-sentient enough to survive on their own when left in the RC for days at a time... if their owners stockpile enough bacon.</p>

            <p>This reminds me of when I originally joined, and planned to have a team in the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Disturbing_Acts_of_Violence_Department">Disturbing Acts of Violence Department</a>, Action Division (DAVD(a)).<br><br>The DAVD missions revealed that canons killed off don&#39;t actually die, even when beheaded- and proved it by waking up such a beheaded character. DAVD&#39;s medical division then simply glued the head back onto the character and they went on thier merry way.<br><br>In short, it&#39;s not really a problem- just make sure DAVD is involved, or at least DAVD(m).</p>

            <p>until the canon’s author says that they are dead. Although I cannot link you to an example, I’m sure I have seen missions in which killed canons were taken to Medical for resurrection.

            <p>I&#39;m under the impression that some Sorters only read fanfictions to look for the bad ones, but the Spies have a rotation where one day they go into fics and the rest of the time they work as Sorters.  Is this a six-day rotation since there are six teams?<br><br>Since I would have two Elizabeths if I do both of her stories, I was thinking of having one that just sorts because she is afraid of dying.

            <p>Right-o, let&#39;s see...<br><br>- You got it: six teams, six-day rotations. A colour team goes through four consecutive days of sorting duty, one day of action duty, then one day where they assign fics to Action department teams for sporking. <br><br>- Sorting and assignment duties within a colour team are broken off into three shifts to make sure the Spies aren&#39;t on duty for 24 hours. Action duty, on the other hand, is an &quot;on call&quot; situation.<br><br>- Sorters sit in front of a computer and read what&#39;s put in front of them. They don&#39;t control what they get: they just make a judgement call. Fics that need boots on the ground for a better verdict get sent to the colour team on action duty.</p>

            <p>Mini-sues: Actually, they&#39;re typically depicted as being miniature versions of the Sue in question, and are usually killed by either the agents themselves or the other minis spawned by the fic.  Since they&#39;re not actually even characters, I don&#39;t think an offhand reference to one of the agents shooting it is particularly bad.  Or just ignore it in the mission itself.  It might get pointed out in the comments or something, but if you&#39;re honest with people, they probably won&#39;t care.<br><br>Intelligence: You can see some sample reports <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Gaspard_De_Grasse#Intelligence_Reports">here</a>.  Honestly, you can probably say the intelligence report is as detailed as you want it to be.  In-universe, the PPC isn&#39;t all that organized; if an Intelligence agent screws something up, the field agents can go yell at them, but it&#39;s unlikely anything else would happen unless it&#39;s a recurring issue.  In the past, agents have been accidentally assigned missions they&#39;re completely unqualified for and basically told, &quot;well, go do it anyways.&quot;<br><br>Plotholes: The PPC isn&#39;t so empty that you could wander it for too long without running into anyone.  Plus, given its highly mutable architecture, new arrivals may have a tendency to find themselves ending up at the Marquis de Sod&#39;s office.  As for what happens after they&#39;re found, it seems to vary from character to character.  Some people go through official training; others just get dumped at an RC and told to go to it.  </p>

You can probably even edit things so that the misspelled name doesn&#39;t actually appear in the mission.<br><br>Um... maybe?  If you want to use the semi-fic blip, why not have them be the one who fell down the plothole instead?  It feels a little overcomplicated, unless you want an agent that only reluctantly joined.

            <p>Standard procedure is most likely to find out what the heck the refugee is doing there, if they got there by accident, and to either take them to Personnel for recruitment or deal with them depending on how things go. I do imagine picking up people who got stranded in the corridors by plothole is something DIA patrols would be expected to do, but if you&#39;re not drawing attention to yourself a lot of agents might just assume you&#39;re some other Assassin/Untangler/Whatever they just haven&#39;t seen around - HQ is supposed to be <i>big</i> after all.</p>

Rainbow Dash gets tortured, and dies for six minutes in chapter 10 after she&#39;s on an ambulance gurney.  The paramedics don&#39;t seem to be doing CPR or anything, then Fluttershy yells at her and she comes back to life.  (What should be done about the serial killer if the agent removes the evidence?  Will he just die with the fic?)<br><br>That part has admitted lack-of-research on the effects of crack, I don&#39;t know how much she&#39;s off yet.  Afterwards, I&#39;m bothered by what is allowed to happen during the hospital scenes.<br><br>I&#39;m thinking it would be alright to kill the fic early in the torture scene, sending Dash to Medical and yelling at the self-insert for just the chapter 8-10 stuff.<br><br>Later on, I think there is a screw-up between insulin and epinephrine.

            <p>Basically I want to establish that the Intelligence report has a good tip about a hiding spot, and also that it points out certain chapters as the bad spot.  Is this acceptable, or does it overstep authority?  Or is it a case of a nice thing they can include, but it&#39;s on an agent&#39;s head if taking their advice leads to a screwup?</p>

            <p>Still an option.  As a writer, it is your job to draw the audience&#39;s attention where you want it.  If you don&#39;t point out the misspelling, most people won&#39;t even notice it.  The ones that do notice, shouldn&#39;t care too much, if you are being entertaining.<br><br>Mistakes happen.  If the agents jump the gun and charge for something they shouldn&#39;t, there&#39;s nothing saying they can&#39;t cross it off again.  The only thing you really need to consider is what does it add to the story for there to be a mistake and a correction?  If it is only there to add words, then it probably shouldn&#39;t be there.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>While I&#39;m not abandoning my two previous agents, I&#39;m just going to relegate them to minor badfics. These agents are my new primaries.<br><br>All three are from the battlefield continuum, more specifically the result of fanart coming to life through an accident involving a reality room and a malfunctioning portal generator. their department is the DMS, freelance division<br><br>They are:<br><br>1: Grigori: Derived from the Russian soldier class of battlefield 4, &quot;Greg&quot;(as he&#39;s known to his &quot;brothers&quot;) is the middle &quot;brother&quot; of the 3 fanart-spawned agents. he is cool, collected, and is generally considered the &quot;ego&quot; between the hyperactive Anderson and the nerdy Zhao. Somewhat of a loner, he doesn&#39;t show a lot of emotion, except when extremely squicked out. He has the lowest squick tolerance of all the &quot;fanart soldiers&quot;. His weapons are an SKS marksman rifle, a MP-443 pistol,an M320 with DART rounds, and a knife. has the appearance of a 25 year old Russian male of average weight.<br><br>2:Zhao:Derived from the Chinese engineer, Zhao is the youngest of the &quot;fanart soldiers&quot;. He is very intelligent, and can use many different gadgets to trick and defeat mary sues. has medium squick tolerance. He prefers to think problems through to find a solution, constantly putting him at odds with Anderson. Weapons are a QBS-09 shotgun, QSZ-92 pistol, an RPG, and a knife. Has the appearance of a 20 year old Chinese male of under-average weight.<br><br>3:Anderson:Derived from the American assault class, Anderson is the oldest of the &quot;fanart soldiers&quot;. He is aggressive and headstrong, which causes no end of arguments with Zhao and Headaches for Greg. weapons are a LSAT machinegun, M9 pistol, XM25 with DART rounds,and a knife.<br><br>All of them appear as generics under their uniforms due to the nature of their creation. they also have culture implants, as they would be effectively brain-dead without them.<br><br>So, What do you think. Are they Sues? Or are they believable? Let me know.      </p>

            <p>A fair number of the stories I&#39;m looking at for missions and reading at the Library have these weird and heavy-handed political messages to them that easily overshadow the plot: <i>the rare Animagus</i> (environmentalist), <i>Tavros and Fairie: A Love Story</i> (random Tea Party speeches in the author&#39;s notes), and <i>The USA Versus The Batarian Hegemony</i> (should be self-explanatory).<br><br>I&#39;m looking for a way to poke at this sort of soapboxing without just flaming the ideologies in question, so I was thinking it causes something to happen in the Word World, but I don&#39;t know what.<br><br>Maybe it generates a ubiquitous force that physically tries to push objects to the right or left, depending?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently working on updating my agents&#39; bios and I want to claim the badfic for their inaugural mission, so I have two ideas in mind that could make things more interesting for them.<br><br>Firstly, while out walking today I came up with a plot point that could make him more interesting (without having to be openly lascivious). Since Falchion is an author insert, I had the idea that the character who would become Falchion was an author wraith himself, or some variant thereof, but one that doesn&#39;t possess canons. Instead, he would create personas for himself, wandering through various stories that he wrote in the past and interacting with canons like a normal OC, and each time he moved on to a new project he simply reincarnated into a new persona, letting the old one branch off into its own character. This leads up to him incarnating as a Skarmory at some point, and then once he notices that some things don&#39;t add up, he realizes who he really is and discovers the PPC as a result.<br><br>Still needs a bit of refinement, but it should be helpful. Though I don&#39;t know if author-wraiths can create personas for themselves instead of possessing canons.<br><br>The second idea I had is that in one of Rosetta and Falchion&#39;s missions, a Sue-wraith possesses a canon and turns him or her into a ferocious monster. Upon being exorcised, instead of whining the wraith actually gains a physical form retaining all the monster&#39;s abilities, and then attempts to kill the agents AND the canon it was possessing, forcing the three to work together. Looking up Sue-wraiths on the wiki, the only type I know of that comes even close to attacking the agents would be the Ficubus and even then it can still be killed by conventional weaponry. The wraith I suggested is intended to be a sort of &quot;final boss&quot; of the mission, since wraiths in general tend to be easy to kill and I needed a change of pace somewhere.<br><br>Anyway, those are my two ideas. Feedback is appreciated as usual :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not quite convinced about Falchion being an author-wraith. As the PPC canon goes, wraiths are not creatures with a fixed form. They infect canon characters, but not to the point that they are completely unidentifiable as who they were. If wraiths created entirely new characters, then they would be Sues and Stus (or, if they&#39;re good, they&#39;d just be new characters).<br><br>The monster/&quot;final boss&quot; concept is what bothers me the most. In a straight-up fight between Sues and agents, the agents would lose nine times out of ten (especially if they are fighting the wraith &quot;on its own terms,&quot; as you said in your response to zdimensia). Even the most experienced of warriors would have difficulty facing off against a creature that can shape the Word World to its will. At the very least the agents are not going away without some nasty (and possibly permanent) wounds. There is a reason most Mary Sues are dealt with using non-standard methods such as ambushes, traps, or slow-acting poisons.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say it can&#39;t be done. There&#39;s evidence that states quite the opposite, in fact. But it&#39;s not something that should be taken lightly, and definitely not right away. If you are dead set on having a big fight, it should be something that occurs once you&#39;ve gotten a few missions under your belt. A story that ends with a boss battle should have at least SOME consequences for your agents.<br><br>You also need a reason beyond &quot;I want a big fight to cap off a mission.&quot; The wraith shouldn&#39;t be able to turn itself or a canon into a monster just because.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve already responded to the author-wraith concerns in my reply to zdimensia - I&#39;ve ditched that concept, and instead Falchion retains memories of experiencing the particular fic I&#39;m sporking from the Gary Stu&#39;s POV. He would later research the author and realize that he is the current persona of that author.<br><br>The canon turning into a monster actually happens in the fic I&#39;m sporking (again, see my reply to zdimensia), because the antagonistic character replacement wants to use her as a weapon and mutates her accordingly. It... doesn&#39;t end well for him, I&#39;ll give you that much. And while I do plan for the possessed canon to transform before Falchion can exorcise her, he&#39;ll remember a couple of small details that will allow him to bring her back down to size without too much trouble. He&#39;s rather observant like that. Though he may end up having to rope one of the stronger OC Stand Ins to help him out... new recruits, anyone?</p>

            <p>Agents cannot deal with Sues and Stus head on &quot;without too much trouble,&quot; especially fresh recruits. If they could, then what would make them different from the Sues themselves? Like I said in my last post: big boss battles should be rare and impactful, and they definitely should not be in your first mission. You should get a handle on your characters and how they fit in the PPC before jumping into that particular scenario.<br><br>I&#39;m not totally sold on this meta-concept you&#39;ve got with Falchion (I don&#39;t know that the character needs it), but I suppose it could work. I&#39;d want to see it in a story to really get a grasp on it.<br><br>Also, a note: why wouldn&#39;t your agents deal with the antagonist character replacement before the monster mutation bit? Surely they would look at the Words, see it coming, and take steps to avoid having a potentially lethal battle in the first place. Especially since you say that Falchion is &quot;rather observant.&quot;</p>

            <p>I think the main point against the agents&#39; immediate action would probably be indecision - the agents have no idea whether the canon got possessed by an author wraith or was replaced entirely until near the tail end of the monster form&#39;s glorious rampage. They initially plan for getting the author wraith out of the canon but can&#39;t decide how to do so, so Falchion decides to look at the Words for clues. Ultimately, though, he realizes that she&#39;s a character replacement after all when she brutally murders the antagonist replacement near the end of the fic, and Falchion decides &#39;screw it&#39; and swoops in to dispose of her.<br><br>Ultimately, though, I guess you&#39;re right - the more I think about it, the less sense a drawn out &quot;boss battle&quot; would make, especially for Falchion&#39;s first mission. The way I see it, Falchion would instead likely convince one of the better-written OCs to help him, and rather than a drawn-out boss battle, the other OC holds the Sue at bay while Falchion reads the charges. If the transformation is still allowable, since the replacement has bulletproof armor, Falchion would invoke the &quot;Clipped-Wing Angel&quot; trope by tossing a bomb into the replacement&#39;s mouth, letting it blow up and kill her from the inside.</p>

            <p>Considering that all the big wraiths so far have been incredibly dangerous mind-manipulating creatures, that seems like a bad idea. But even then, they are still possessors. They take over the bodies of canon characters. Otherwise they&#39;d just be regular Sues.</p>

            <p>Fair point on the possessors stuff, though - I just thought it worth noting that the PPC&#39;s encountered a few that seemed to actually have some kind of form outside their victims instead of being shapeless mist things.</p>

            <p>The badfic I plan to tackle for the agents&#39; first mission happens to be of my own creation, unfortunately: &quot;Rise of the Galeforces&quot;, a really crazy mega-crossover that primarily takes place in The Incredibles continuum, crossing it over with Portal and later, Jurassic Park. It&#39;s in four episodes and available on both Google Drive and DeviantART, but I&#39;m going after the Google Drive version for convenience.<br><br>Episode 1: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J58DHm5dFEndaQq-_krzdJJs7iq7AkT7d0zuWAo35Qo"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J58DHm5dFEndaQq-_krzdJJs7iq7AkT7d0zuWAo35Qo">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J58DHm5dFEndaQq-_krzdJJs7iq7AkT7d0zuWAo35Qo</a></a><br>Episode 2: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CfQS2gmVZCgrbMaAsR4k3WWZpGbkToOYoj_Fs37ySsY"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CfQS2gmVZCgrbMaAsR4k3WWZpGbkToOYoj_Fs37ySsY">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CfQS2gmVZCgrbMaAsR4k3WWZpGbkToOYoj_Fs37ySsY</a></a><br>Episode 3: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDmdwFggmwpcnZY1DvZZClv7EjkrIY4Y9hCZDINDahg"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDmdwFggmwpcnZY1DvZZClv7EjkrIY4Y9hCZDINDahg">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDmdwFggmwpcnZY1DvZZClv7EjkrIY4Y9hCZDINDahg</a></a><br>Episode 4: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEWIdcvDq3wQo0r5M5ekYy4Z5TrVg1B0DqGLJMte03E"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEWIdcvDq3wQo0r5M5ekYy4Z5TrVg1B0DqGLJMte03E">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEWIdcvDq3wQo0r5M5ekYy4Z5TrVg1B0DqGLJMte03E</a></a><br><br>As an alternative to the author wraith suggestion, I may play out Falchion&#39;s coming to grips with being a persona as follows: He comes to the PPC with a particular set of memories and interests that he doesn&#39;t remember having. Then, as the mission plays out, he starts remembering them from the perspective of the Gary Stu self-insert who first appears in Chapter 5. He later goes off to research the fic and the author and realizes that he is the persona of said author, allowing him to remember all the mistakes he made on a personal level when he wrote the fic, and take down the Sue-wraith who begins possessing Violet near the end of Episode 3. (Rose gets rid of the Gary Stu, since Falchion can&#39;t bring himself to kill another persona of his.)<br><br>I like to think that Falchion has to take on the killer author wraith himself, because I plan for the agents to step in just after the horrifically gruesome death of the villainous character replacement near the end of the last chapter before the epilogue. Rose will have witnessed said death and would be so shell-shocked by it that Falchion would have to take matters into his own talons. He forgets to set up a containment circle, though (and doesn&#39;t get the time to remember), and ends up having to fight the wraith on its own terms. It&#39;ll still take on the physical form of the monster it turned Vi into, but yeah, Falchion screwing up could also add more drama as he takes that thing down.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m curious to wonder if I, along with the co-author with which I wrote the fic, misspelled anything related to that canon - last time I checked the documents I noticed that the spelling errors experienced a population explosion towards the end. We probably rushed the fic during the later episodes for personal reasons and I pretty much stopped trying to proofread the rest of it in later editing stages.</p>

            <p>Didn&#39;t read much, I have to work really hard to decipher script format.

The best I&#39;ve seen is that an agent set up a slipknot to pull Legolas&#39; arms behind his back, the set-up was while the Sue was distracted with kissing him.

            <p>I apologize if that sentence came out wrong. But yeah, that could work. He&#39;d probably realize that there&#39;s something special about the fic, do some research about the author, and begin coming to terms with his being a self-insert/persona by the end of the mission.<br><br>I could try to do that - maybe Vi transforms before Falchion can exorcise her and he has to get her to transform back before finishing the job. I may still have the author wraith try to attack him before he destroys it, though.<br><br>Scriptfic, eh? Sounds like it&#39;ll be very interesting to pull off.

            <p>Okay, the original idea for Cheesy&#39;s partner was something from a magic-based continuum, but then, I was suddenly struck by an idea.<br><br>An interesting, amazing idea.<br><br>An idea that completely bucks everything out the window.<br><br>I&#39;m going to do a self-insert.<br><br>Name: Aaron Edwards Mousse<br>Gender: Male<br>Species: World 1 Human<br>Age: Mid-twenties<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Preferred weapon: Aaron doesn&#39;t bring much skill to the table, but he&#39;ll grow very, very fond of a simple knife.<br>Appearance: Caucasian, with dark brown hair, glasses over green eyes, and a completely unchecked case of vitiligo. Uniform takes two forms: jeans and a black T-shirt with DoF flashpatch on back and a green baseball cap, or a black buisiness suit with green tie, complete with flashpatch cufflinks. Which one he wears is seemingly random.<br>Abilities: Due to almost a year of surfing the site 4chan without using brain bleach products, Aaron is more resistant to Sues in that he requires about one-sixth as much bleeprin as your average agent.<br>Personality: Aaron is a lot more easygoing than Cheesy, being the optimist to Cheesy&#39;s pessimist and the jokester to Cheesy&#39;s grump. He&#39;s also kind and caring about others- something that isn&#39;t immediately clear when he calls you a &quot;faggot&quot; almost offhandedly the first time you meet him. Hint: That&#39;s a test to see how thick-skinned you are.<br>However, when the (almost nonexistent) kid gloves come off, and Aaron gets angry, it&#39;s an entirely different kind of rage to Cheesy&#39;s fiery fury. He becomes cold and calculating, a hunter with the source of the anger having a large target painted on his back. And he won&#39;t stop until either that target is dead... or someone calms him down.<br>He at first won&#39;t care for the &#39;duty&#39;, but events will transpire in the first mission that change his mind. Quickly.<br>History: Aaron, after a job interview, sat down, turned on his tablet, went onto 4chan, and started reading a fic someone posted. Halfway through the fic, he fell through a plothole, tablet, suit, and all, straight into a meeting of the Flowers that Be- er, to be more exact, straight into the meeting room&#39;s table. That&#39;s pretty much it.</p>

            <p>And by explanation, I mean &quot;WHY.&quot;<br><br>First off, what the buck I was rambling on about when I started the post- Well, at that point, I was dead set on Aaron, and the &#39;bucks everything out the window&#39; bit was because I was trying to hide my prior involvement in 4chan up until that point.<br><br>That is, until I realized that absolutely nobody has sporked a badfic from 4chan. And I could tell, because nobody mentioned greentext, the strange hybrid of script and prose that makes up 99.99% of 4chan fics.<br><br>And that gave me the idea of a former 4chan anon turning around and sporking greentext badfic the same way that many other agents turn out to have previously written badfic.<br><br>As for actual 4chan &quot;greentext,&quot; when they are posted there is always at least one anon there in the thread always have two or three Anons there to give him concrit, such concrit almost never goes past writing style or SPaG. &quot;You&quot; (the usual main character) are always a Gary Stu (and yes, here Gary Stus are the majority, not the minority) that Drops Into Equestria, usually without explanation, almost always with an inexplicable immunity to magic, and as for how the canon around you turns out...<br><br>I&#39;m just going to bring up the &quot;Flutterrape&quot; threads from 4chan&#39;s /mlp/ board to answer that. No, it&#39;s the exact opposite of what you&#39;re thinking. &quot;You&quot; (man, I can see the usually-underused You crash dummy getting overworked fast here) are the main Gary Stu (or, rarely, , and the whole premise is that everypony wants to have sex with you to the point of raping you. And since Fluttershy is the, oh, I don&#39;t know, <i>shy</i> one in canon, she&#39;s the one that ends up being the most used target!<br><br>Excuse me while I proceed to blatantly ignore everything I say about brain bleach two paragraphs down and smash my head into a wall.<br><br>Going back to discussing the character, the part with &quot;f*****&quot; will probably be cut out or replaced with generic insults, mainly because I had forgotten that actual cursing was a Bad Idea here in the board.<br><br>The part about requiring less bleeprin is because I genuinely feel that 4chan experience could negate the need for brain bleach, at least partially.<br><br>As for appearance, that&#39;s me. However, the suit and the green items are a reference to &quot;green-man Anon&quot;, a common stylization of Anonymous (or as he&#39;s referred in most 4chan greentext, &quot;you&quot;) as a character, the idea being that the green skin, blank face, and bald head of the Green-Man Anon would work as a green screen, allowing pretty much anyone to be projected there.</p>

            <p>Your intentions are good with Aaron as a character, but in all honesty, I really have to wonder what Cheesy would have to do with this. Especially because if paired with Aaron he will probably end up dealing primarily with MLP, a continuum he isn&#39;t familiar with. If you&#39;re going to spork MLP badfic, maybe it would be more appropriate for Aaron to be paired up with someone from the MLP continuum itself. Though that will only result in creating more agents prematurely and I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;ll sit well with the staff.<br><br>I still stand by my assessment about Cheesy being paired with someone from a magic universe. THAT SAID, Aaron&#39;s concept does sound interesting and is in general a good start, so maybe I could propose a compromise. Aaron and Cheesy may work together for a few missions, but then they recruit someone from one of the MLP badfics and Aaron ends up being partnered with that character instead, since Cheesy gets into conflict with said character and has to be reassigned.<br><br>Hopefully such a story shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to pull off. I just like the idea of agents squabbling with potential recruits.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re getting that, expecially since you replied to a post where I said I would scrap the focus on greentext and return them to the Department of Floaters that I&#39;d assigned to Cheesy originally.<br>Besides, personally, I find that Cheesy is a more fleshed-out character. If they part ways I&#39;d more likely follow Cheesy instead of Aaron. Hmm...<br><br>...Maybe since I&#39;m already changing parts of Aaron, I could retrofit him into a unicorn?

            <p>Big no to the Diamond Dog, for three reasons:<br>   1, mainly because it&#39;s still an author-insert.

            <p>Fanfiction.net, despite being The Pit Of Voles, is actually the best place to get fanfictions to have a good visibility.<br><br>However, to avoid troubles, for missions a blog or something like that is preferred. I use Wordpress, but that&#39;s mainly because I already had an account on it. I don&#39;t exactly like a good chunk of the limitations it imposes to free users, but it&#39;s more than enough for missions anyways.<br><br>A good rule of thumb is: don&#39;t post the mission on the same site that hosts the fic being sporked.

            <p>The one in Headquarters stays there, and a new Sue appears in the &#39;fic.<br><br>I&#39;m basing this off of a system a friend of mine developed for a ttRPG that had heavy time travel elements. There existed areas not fully cotemporal with any other timeline (much like Headquarters) that would not be affected if history was altered, which we called causally protected zones. A person (or any object, really) could enter the CP-zone from their timeline, have that timeline changed so that they never got that far, and then exit the zone to exist alongside the other version, a process we called causal orphaning since it created objects with no apparent origin point. From the altered timeline&#39;s perspective, CP-zones became essentially a source from which things that might have been, but did not, would occasionally manifest.</p>

            <p>In the mission <a href="http://julyflame.livejournal.com/18401.html">&quot;Swim&quot;</a> by JulyFlame, July and Library end up sporking a fic that July wrote. It shows July interacting with an author-insert and reveals that despite the PPC regarding the July and the author-insert as the same person, Agent!July and Insert!July forked when the fic was written, Insert!July not experiencing anything that Agent!July did after that point- kinda like a Horcrux from Harry Potter. This would support AdmiralSakai&#39;s theory.<br><br>However, in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KmcAgo2JEbSFBr6ZFRHUSp3Ey4gXyi384U90HLipCnE/edit?hl=en_US">&quot;Snapback&quot;</a> by WarriorJoe (which happens to be the story that brought me to the PPC), the character Fritz tells us that because they killed Replacement!Pinkie Pie (known outside of the PPC as Pinkamena), all of the spinoff endings and alternate versions of the fic won&#39;t be able to affect the MLP:FIM universe anymore.<br><br>I&#39;m not entirely sure, but that may also include sequel fics- which would mean that the second fic can&#39;t even be sporked.<br><br>Which, by the way, is unfair. People will sometimes read a badfic, and make their fic an AU where the premise is that any out-of-character moments and character replacements from the badfic are &quot;canon&quot; in their story.<br><br>I should know. I did it about a year ago, here&#39;s the fi-<br>*reads own fic*<br>...No. No, that isn&#39;t the ending I remember, she doesn&#39;t even kill Pinkamena...<br><br>...Well, shit. Looks like I dug up a fic that I remember finishing one way and actually finished a different way that makes my protagonist a replacement Sue.

            <p>I think the difference between those two examples is that a sequel and the original &#39;fic, while related (which could explain shared Sue memories), are both fanfics of a canon work, while the Cupcakes subfics were themselves fanfics of a fanfic.<br><br>Think of it like a family tree, or like the tree data structure. One &quot;root&quot; (canon work) can spawn many &quot;branches&quot; (fanfics) which are connected to it and to some degree draw their reality from it.<br>A prequel and a sequel are &quot;neighbors&quot;, but they are connected to each other <b>through the canon source</b>, so you can cut off one branch without affecting the other.<br>The spinoffs of Cupcakes, however, are all themselves branches of another branch, Cupcakes itself. Destroy <i>that</i> branch, and there&#39;s nothing connecting the spinoffs to the MLP canon, so they either disappear entirely or simply can no longer change things in MLP.<br><br>Thus, a recruited Sue also loses the branch connecting her both to her badfic and the canon it is itself connected to, but since she has someplace else to go and form a new attachment to, she doesn&#39;t disappear.<br><br>One thing I like about this tree model is that it fits well with the established PPC idea of quality being a sort of energy that fics need in order to stabilize and become real. Badfic is too poor in quality to exist on its own, so it needs to leech reality from canon through its branch connection, and if that connection is destroyed it ceases to be real. But a goodfic set in the premise of a badfic has enough <i>native</i> quality to continue existing even if it is cut off.</p>

            <p>I was going to continue my rebuttal that such fanfics would also warrant concrit and such, but then I realized that the PPC is doing this to <i>protect a canon,</i> and it wouldn&#39;t make sense at all for them to protect a canon after they just destroyed it to protect another canon.<br><br>However, that doesn&#39;t explain AUs, or Alternate Universes. For instance, say I was browsing in the Pony Pit (my just-made-up name for <u>F</u>IM<u>Fiction.net</u>, because the url itself presents it as an MLP version of the Pit, aka <u>f</u>an<u>fiction.net</u>) and came across a fic that seems interesting.<br><br>I read it, and it shows Twilight getting old and dying. Except if you pay close attention, there&#39;s no wings and the fic refers to her as a unicorn. Normally that&#39;d be a charge because she&#39;d be an alicorn at that point, but if you read the description, it was written before &quot;Magical Mystery Cure&quot;- the episode where Twilight becomes an alicorn- aired. No biggie, it&#39;s fine. The thing is, a few chapters later, it mentions, say, Fluttershy being a vampire, something that does make sense in canon- but only if you count the episode &quot;Bats!&quot;, where Fluttershy does, indeed, become a vampire. The problem is, &quot;Bats!&quot; aired AFTER &quot;Magical Mystery Cure&quot;. The question remains, should it be a charge- as it would&#39;ve been before &quot;Bats!&quot; aired- or not?<br><br>Or let&#39;s say we have a fic where the author <i>knows</i> and <i>intends</i> to conflict with canon, since his story&#39;s premise includes it- i.e., &quot;What would happen if Nightmare Moon actually won?&quot;- and puts an Alternate Universe tag on it. But it turns out that it&#39;s a badfic, with a ton of grammatical errors and even a Mary Sue. Would the PPC still be able to spork the fic, since it is clearly severing itself from canon already?</p>

            <p>To answer your first question:<br>Generally, I would consider happenings &quot;outdated&quot; by later canon developments to not be chargeable- how were they supposed to have known, they did the best they could regardless, etc., and it seems like the majority of people here follow that same standard. But a situation like you describe could indicate that something timesquiggly or otherwise chargeable is afoot: I remember one Halo fanfic had Sgt. Johnson, Miranda Keyes, 343 Guilty Spark, and Cortana all still alive, when they all died in Halo 3. I wasn&#39;t going to charge for it since the &#39;fic came out in 07 and I wasn&#39;t going to hold an author to changing nearly all of their &#39;fic to accommodate a game they may not even own yet, but then he mentioned East Africa being glassed... which happened in Halo 3. In your particular case, if the battification of Fluttershy is very similar to what actually happened in the show and the &#39;fic came out after, I&#39;d consider Twilight&#39;s winglessness a charge, albeit a minor one.<br><br><br>To answer your second question, bad AUs are definitely sporkable. Changing things from canon is not itself a charge, but it can be if the changes result in stupid or contrived things happening, like Nightmare Moon&#39;s victory turning Spike gay. You can also charge a &#39;fic for needlessly following canon events (i.e. lazy plot-making where they just use the canon story) when the changed premise removes the reasons those events canonically occurred (for instance, still having the Galactic Empire take over when the whole premise of your fic is that Chancellor Palpetine was never born).</p>

Both sides incurred massive casualties: upper limits for Verdun and La Somme both hover around the million-man mark each.<br><br>The first day of La Somme stands out in particular as the single bloodiest day in the history of the British Army: 60000 casualties, one third of which dead.</p>

            <p>I was surfing the Wiki when I came accross the Minis page, and decided to look up the Minis for the various canons I know.<br><br>I didn&#39;t see Team Fortress 2 anywhere on the list.<br><br>What would a TF2 mini be? I suggest either Mini-Sentries (possibly could be confused with the Combat Minisentries that Engineers with the Gunslinger use), &quot;Pocket Medics&quot; (miniature Medics, could be confused with the in-game cosmetic item &quot;Pocket Medic&quot;), or Mini-Robots (like from the game mode Mann VS Machine).</p>

            <p>&quot;The creation of new mini types is reserved for either a) the creator of the OFU in that continuum, or b) if there is no OFU, the first person to write about them in a mission to that continuum. The reason for this is that, while it&#39;s fun to dream up mini types, it isn&#39;t fair to the people actually writing in a new continuum if the perks of doing so are gone when they get there.&quot;<br><br>Speculation is of course fine (albeit a bit pointless, other than as a mental exercise) but there&#39;s no way to suggest a type of minis. You either write the OFU or the first mission for that canon to feature a mini, or you don&#39;t.</p>

            <p>If you actually looked at the list they have, you&#39;ll find several canons with this disclaimer underneath the entry, and I quote using the Transformers entry as an example:<br>&quot;This mini type is not yet official and can be changed by the first writer of a Transformers OFU or the first to write a Transformers mission that produces a mini.&quot;<br>That was what I was going for, not a set-in-stone variety.</p>

            <p>Unofficial minis like that were created before the rules were agreed upon. Since TF2 doesn&#39;t have a mini, one way or the other, it is subject to the rules and can only be made through a mission or OFU. It can&#39;t be created on the Board, not even as an unofficial one.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a fantastic Marvel fanfic called Polarity that has the B-list villain the Shocker as its protagonist.

But it is also about the SGA cast in a terribly difficult situation and they are all wonderfully in-character.<br><br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/948771">The Names Upon the Harp</a><br><br>This is a LotR fic. Try not to read the summary, it is a spoiler. If you can&#39;t help but read it, the fic is still powerful. Seriously, I cried. It is sort of in-between the movie verse and the book verse, and if I say anymore, I&#39;ll spoil it.<br><br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1047295">Body Parts</a> <br><br>This fic is by Roveare11, who is now my Haven beta. She has a lot of fics written and I love all of them. I am including this particular one, because I have been reading fanfic since 2003 and <i>this</i> is what finally prompted me to start writing fanfic. You don&#39;t need to know Haven canon to read this fic. Everything you need to know is pretty obvious from the fic, I think. One of her best qualities in Haven fanfic is that she always gets the dialogue so perfectly in-character.<br><br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/423013">The Very Inappropriate Misuse of Stark Technologies</a><br><br>This fic kicks off a whole series of hilarious fics that are logs of emails, texts, twitters--that sort of thing.

I don&#39;t know why, but that was probably the funniest thing ever, and immediately shot the thing into my favourite flashes, otherwise composed of Cascade and [s] Attempt Rare and Highly Dangerous Showdown Combo.

            <p>You&#39;ve been throwing out a lot of character concepts, especially for someone who hasn&#39;t gotten permission yet (I think? I might have missed that. If you have, I apologize profusely). A lot of them also seem to be meant for free-to-use. While there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, the PPC does not need characters for the sake of just having characters.<br><br>My recommendation to you is to slow down and focus on one agent pairing. Just to start off with. Once you&#39;ve found your groove, then you can move on to making more agents.<br><br>As for the characters you&#39;ve presented themselves, there isn&#39;t really a lot to go on in terms of an actual judgement. Both Nathan and Dwight seem to be aggressively middle-of-the-road (Nathan doesn&#39;t show &quot;high passion,&quot; Dwight isn&#39;t &quot;obsessive&quot; about his exercise). It makes them seem rather bland. Shangmu has even less personality beyond her culture, her being a vegetarian, and her not liking to hurt people.</p>

There&#39;s people on the postal staff and Alice, (so happy to discover those,) some other support staff, a great number of Medical and FicPsych personel, (also useful,) and a few DBS Agents.  (Hello Luxury, the training mission is going to be interesting.)<br><br>I&#39;m working without permission.  It&#39;s just that everything I have been working on is a mess that can mostly be fixed by letting it ferment.  (And some other things I&#39;m waiting on.)  Need to cycle to the new stuff and have it buried in compost when the old stuff is ready to be pulled out.<br><br>For Nathan and Dwight, I kinda wanted them to be severely normal.  (Okay, having two men fit any of the stereotypes is either hilarious or the opposite.  Having them hit none of them is either uncomfortable or funny.)  I think it would be a weird clash with what they do since most agents seem to be insane or into that scary beyond-damage stage.<br><br>Shangmu is rough, but knowledge about the show fills her out a bit.  Basically her core is the same as Aang&#39;s when he&#39;s arguing with his past lives about morality.  There&#39;s also a spiritual side much like Zahn from Farscape.  I said vegetarian and not liking to hurt people because there is a vague difference between that and total pacifist.  I don&#39;t have my monks straight, but she&#39;s more based off the &quot;self-defense&quot; kind than the &quot;warn the bugs you&#39;re coming&quot; kind.</p>

            <p>Just because most agents aren&#39;t free-to-use it doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re under permanent lock-down. If you ask if you can borrow anyone&#39;s agents for a random encounter or amusing interlude, there are always people willing to lend out theirs.<br><br>And, once you have a few missions under your belt and people have a feeling for your style, it should be possible for you to find partners for team-up missions. (Maybe you can even find people who would want to do co-writes for your intern idea.)<br><br>Collaborations help make the PPC feel like an actual organization and not just a collection of isolated RCs, so it&#39;s always better to try to get someone to work with you rather than invent new characters if you need a larger cast. (And I&#39;m saying this as much to myself as to you. My agents don&#39;t get out a lot either.)</p>

            <p>1) PC is right, you should really settle down.<br>2) For the interactions part, if you feel the characters you write aren&#39;t enough, you can do co-writes with people, and/or have your agents cameo in others&#39; missions or vice-versa.</p>

            <p>Shangmu is a blip-fic character from a Last Airbender fic and was born before &quot;Boy in the Iceberg.&quot;  The backstory about her village is that some of the Air Nomads were away from the temples when the Fire Nation attacked.  The remaining nomads were able to instill their culture on a hidden village, but no more benders were born.<br><br>Shangmu&#39;s sensibilities reflect the culture, and she is trained in a mundane fighting style based on Airbending.

            <p>Nathan could blend in as an office drone or customer service rep.  He&#39;s charismatic in an unobtrusive way and slightly intellectual.

            <p>I&#39;ve heard of quite a few Pokemon trainer agents, but no agents that are straight-up Pokemon. Yes, this implies the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon sub-continuum, where Pokemon are shown sapient and even talkative.<br><br>The agent I have in mind is a yet-unnamed Porygon-Z, though the name &quot;Cheesy&quot; (Cheesy.exe?) sounds tempting. Porygon-Z and thier preevolved forms are sentient computer programs able to materialize in meatspace AND cyberspace, but Porygon-Z are noteable for being <b>hacked</b> versions of Porygon2, thier evolved forms. Unlike the preevolved forms Porygon and Porygon2, Porygon-Z have emotions and are buggy, prone to glitches.<br><br>Unlike most Agents, the Porygon-Z wouldn&#39;t take bleeprin or other forms of brain bleach, but instead would edit its own memories like a file, deleting things brain bleach would erase. It would be able to actually go into a partner&#39;s CAD, or petrhaps even have a CAD hacked into its software by DoSAT, causing &#39;headaches&#39; and fainting instead of overheating and explosions, of course.<br><br>As for the glitches, it wouldn&#39;t be able to process Mary Sues, Sue Wraiths, and sue-related things the same way a non-software-based Agent would, instead seeing (and referring to) them as glitches, viruses, or even MissingNo.s. For instance, where anyone else would see, say, Urple, the Porygon-Z would see, say, regular magenta, or a black and white checkerboard pattern, or a pixelly glitchy mess, or anything else a computer would throw up for a missing or corrupted texture in a 3D video game. <br><br>It would also refer to other things the way a computer would- for instance, &#39;fainting&#39; as &#39;crashing&#39; or &#39;freezing&#39; or a &#39;blue screen of death&#39;.<br><br>I haven&#39;t really thought much about what/who its partner would <br>be, other than someone unfamiliar with technology.</p>

            <p>I admit you have me at a loss with the Mystery Dungeon stuff, but generally the pokemon are portrayed as being basically animals. As you said, they are depicted as sentient and talkative in Mystery Dungeon, so I might be incorrect, but even the minis (save Harry Potter&#39;s) don&#39;t often talk. I&#39;m sure DoSAT has a slew of translators and so forth, but they aren&#39;t, as far as I have seen, used/tested on animals. Like I said, this could probably be handwaved thanks to DoSAT, so it shouldn&#39;t be much of a problem, but it is something to consider, since it would be ANOTHER piece of foreign tech being implemented into Cheesy, and thus something that could fail at exactly the right/wrong time.</p>

            <p>Wow, first person to realize that Cheesy was a beta name and not the final name when I wrote the OP. I&#39;d originally typed it on a whim and added &quot;(Cheesy.exe?)&quot; as a potential &quot;full name&quot; for the character. However, it&#39;s already grown on me. A lot. And I can see how it would fit, my name on here being Anony<i>mouse</i> and computer <i>mice</i> and whatnot...<br><br>As for the Internet, that might actually be a good intro story for him. He goes to the Decrepit Lab, finds a computer that through a plothole has an Internet connection, and surfs around until he ends up in the PPC. DoSAT made sure to block him from the Internet so he couldn&#39;t run off or something with knowledge of the PPC, got him to join the PPC, installed the CCAD and Universal Translator, and sent him to be trained. And he never got access to the Internet again because it got buried under all the other Cheesy tech problems that pop up, like the 2701 glitches in his system.</p>

            <p>Your summation gave us a lot about what Cheesy can do in regards to its powers and interactions, but next to nothing about what it&#39;s actually like as a character. You tell me nothing about its likes, dislikes, hobbies, habits, or quirks of personality. You have given me no reason to care about Cheesy. That has me concerned.<br><br>As I have said before (like <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:PoorCynic/Workshop_One:_Characters">here</a>, for instance), characterization must take precedence over powers. Allowing powers to take the lead in making a character will leave you with someone who is essentially a walking gimmick at best. My concern is you approached Cheesy with a mindset of &quot;oh, wouldn&#39;t it be cool if this character could do this and this.&quot; You should make characters that are interesting. Compelling. People/creatures that you would want to read about even if they had no powers what so ever.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that the concept should be scrapped. It needs a lot of work, though.</p>

            <p><s>Wynaut</s>Why not give you that now? I was actually focusing more on the idea of a character being like this and not an actual character, but I&#39;ll go ahead and make a character around it.<br><br>Cheesy is a tech nut. Anything even remotely related to technology he views as SHINY, and if he has his way, he&#39;ll crowd his RC with so much tech that it&#39;d be impossible to get from anywhere to anywhere in it... that is unless you&#39;re Cheesy. He, like most Porygon-Z, can switch between meatspace and the cyberspace in some device with ease. Half the time he&#39;s in his partner&#39;s remote activator or CAD, or even in the console, where he can send himself from room to room via ICEP (and therefore find out that HQ&#39;s ICEP network is just as confusing as its halls). Unlike most agents, he&#39;ll be able to feel the consoles&#39; pain when they get destroyed, because he almost always sleeps in the things.<br><br>He often makes up his own terminology for things he doesn&#39;t understand, rather than call them the same things other people do, and often these terms are taken from either his home continuum or cyberspace- the HQ is the &quot;Server&quot;, Gods are &quot;Legendaries&quot;, Sues are &quot;Viruses&quot;, things like that- and he finds it extremely annoying when someone corrects him, firing back that he KNOWS what they&#39;re really called and he couldn&#39;t give a Rattatta&#39;s ass, he&#39;s gonna use the term he made.<br><br>His body and mind are a glitch filled mess. It&#39;s been that way ever since he evolved into a Porygon-Z, and DoSAT messing with his code to install the CCAD and Universal Translator only made it worse. This translates to his body being in almost constant, if blunt, pain, which contributes to a foul mood if he&#39;s not distracted, and gives him the equavalent of hallucinations if his environment parsing system skips a beat. Up until his Porygon-Z evolution (which was fairly recent), he hadn&#39;t needed to deal with emotions, as he had none. This means he finds it extremely easy to fly off the handle with rage, or break down in virtual tears (or worse, a full-blown temper tantrum), or get far too excited than is healthy, over the tiniest things. He hates every second of it, and relies on almost constant distraction to keep himself from noticing that his meatspace body is completely scrambled, or the other 2700 error messages that translate in his head into pain.<br><br>This constant distraction takes many forms, from flying around the RC, to strolling around HQ&#39;s ICEP network, to giving in to his computer-precise OCD and sorting his tech collection for the 200 millionth time, to chatting with thier console (Consoles are sentient right?) and attempting to convince the stubborn overgrown alarm clock to play various tunes instead of [BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!], to- of course- missions.<br><br>Despite his race being capable of eating, he for some reason finds the whole process of digestion repulsive, choosing to use the potions supplied to Pokemon Trainer Agents and an internal file-browsing system to heal up and forget memories instead of using the Oran Berries typical of his sub-continuum and the bleeprin used by practically everyone in the PPC.</p>

            <p>Y&#39;know, when I read PoorCynic&#39;s statement that you should think about Cheesy&#39;s character as well as his capabilities, the FIRST thing that came to mind as far as sentient computers are concerned was the sentient computer AIs from Portal. GlaDOS in particular is witty and sarcastic, if increasingly sinister and malicious, so I was intially contemplating that kind of wit for him, maybe with a little touch of Iron Man&#39;s JARVIS.<br><br>From what you&#39;ve described for Cheesy.exe, however, I take it that he&#39;s surprisingly emotional and... *high-strung* for a sentient computer program. So a more accurate comparison would be to Wheatley, who is similarly neurotic and tends to blubber and go through various tics. One of the more interesting things you could work into Cheesy&#39;s story arc is that because he resides in technology and feels pain whenever whatever he&#39;s in is damaged, it translates to a constant paranoia and a reluctance to assimilate into hardware that isn&#39;t sufficiently protected. Said paranoia makes him very observant and even slight &quot;errors&quot; can be a jump scare to him, so combining this with the knowledge he may gather he could serve as a metaphorical miner&#39;s canary in the presence of a Sue/Stu/whatever he calls them.<br><br>I can almost hear him talking in Wheatley&#39;s voice, in fact, with that &quot;idiosyncratic staccato Bristolian burr&quot; that Edge magazine used to refer to the voice of the latter. Though he may alter his programming to mimic any voice at will, and of course disguises set his voice to that of the alternate form by default.<br><br>That said, reading PoorCynic&#39;s commentary on your own character concept, I&#39;d say that him being the &quot;Grumpy Bear&quot; as TV Tropes puts it works fine as well, and it would make a convenient excuse for him to be a GlaDOS-style snarker like I stated initially. Maybe you could also combine that with the jumpiness I mentioned above and tie that into his being more irritable than most. I too would scrap the constant pain, as it sounds a lot like a wangst generator to me and it sounds like he could do without it. The best alternative I can come up with is that he has a few odd and occasionally annoying coding tics every once in a while (de-rezzing like Vanellope from Wreck-It Ralph, snarky error messages, rebooting at random intervals, having a subroutine unexpectedly crash, etc.).<br><br>All in all, I think you&#39;ve got a good handle on Cheesy as a whole, and it&#39;s good to know that you&#39;ve padded out his personality (or as much as a sentient AI would allow) for good measure. I need to do the same thing for Falchion as soon as I get some free time...</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll admit, I wasn&#39;t thinking of Portal at all. I was just thinking about my interpretation of canon for Porygon-Z, and how that might tie in to a character. But I can see how referencing GlaDOS and personality cores would make a WHOLE lot of sense in this case...<br><br>I&#39;m not really that fond of the &quot;paranoid&quot; bit. I played it as he lives with his metaphorical feet in both worlds, half in meatspace, half in cyberspace. Sure, he&#39;s not likely to shut down (a &#39;not running&#39; state where he&#39;s reduced to an inanimate file on a computer that can be edited and then run to wake him back up) in anything other than a well-protected DoSAT computer, as the storage medium he&#39;s on being destroyed while he&#39;s in that state would kill him, but he&#39;s more than willing to take the risk of being thrown violently and painfully back into meatspace when his partner sends a sledgehammer into the console&#39;s screen- because cyberspace just feels <i>right</i> to him. In meatspace he&#39;s a sort of fish out of water.<br><br>As I said in my reply to PC&#39;s comment, I&#39;m definitely scrapping Cheesy being in pain. Besides, the occasional glitches like &quot;hallucinations&quot; and de-rezzing would make for a more comedy/irony-friendly approach (i.e. Cheesy getting comfortable and instead of the console [BEEEEEEEEP!]ing like you&#39;d expect, his Universal Translator subroutine glitches and <i>he</i> starts [BEEEEEEEEEEP!]ing. Or something like that.</p>

            <p>I have some concerns about his glitching. Having a nigh-constantly grumpy agent is fine; goodness knows we&#39;ve got quite a few of those. Having a character be in persistent pain (even if its just a translated approximation of pain) seems a tad grim. It almost sounds like he has cybernetic cancer. You can communicate that he has glitches without going down that route: stuttering, blinking in and out, or similar.<br><br>The way you&#39;ve set up DoSAT&#39;s involvement also makes me a bit ill at ease. Combined with the &quot;constant if blunt pain,&quot; you make it sound like they installed a CCAD and Universal Translator against his will, or at the very least that they didn&#39;t know what they were doing. DoSAT are neither monsters nor incompetent (despite the running gag about the CADs). They have access to the knowledge of literally every universe you could name. I have to imagine that they&#39;ve worked with AI before, both canonical and not.<br><br>Despite that, the rest of the profile seems all right. I&#39;d be curious to see how you pull off this agent in an actual story -- mission or otherwise.</p>

            <p>Well, I guess that makes sense... but the reason I went down the pain route is simple.<br><br>Pain is our body parts sending a message that something just went wrong, right?<br><br>Well, aren&#39;t error messages like that too?<br><br>But yeah, you&#39;re right. In hindsight, it <i>does</i> seem kinda like cyber-cancer... I&#39;ll cut out the pain aspect, but I&#39;ll still have him be unfamiliar with his warped-due-to-evolution body to the point of even hating it at points, and I&#39;ll still throw in a few scenes where, say, his modeling subroutine (the thing that creates his meatspace body) goes even <i>more</i> out of whack and he ends up in an immobile wad or flashing a rainbow of colors, or where he suddenly sees something that isn&#39;t there at all or suddenly goes blind because his environmental parsing subroutine is glitching. You know, the kind of random stuff that the Rules of Funny and Irony can exploit.<br><br>As for the CCAD and Universal Translator, no, it&#39;s not anywhere near against his will. I&#39;m actually thinking of Cheesy in the DoSAT, freshly recruited but not yet assigned to a department, seeing the various gadgets, and asking if the technicians could add them to his body as subroutines. However, I was going on the thread of &quot;if you add something to a program after the debug controls are gone, it&#39;s that much harder to catch a glitch&quot;. As a Porygon-Z, he&#39;s already glitchy, trying to eliminate glitches all in one go would involve Cheesy on the &quot;surgery table&quot; of an opened text file for months, possibly even a couple years, as DoSAT attempts to eliminate not only the glitches it introduced with the CCAD and Universal Translator (oh, and the file manager subroutine, don&#39;t forget that), but also the glitches Team Plasma (or whoever created the Dubious Disk in the Mystery Dungeon games, because &gt;no humans) introduced when he evolved into Porygon-Z. It&#39;s unfeasible and I doubt Cheesy would want to take that route anyways, so instead they have a &quot;You find a bug, come to us, we&#39;ll fix it&quot; setup. (I&#39;ll probably end up with DoSAT being what Cheesy goes to instead of Medical or FicPsych.)<br><br>As for seeing Cheesy in a mission... yeeeaaaahhh... I don&#39;t exactly have permission yet. (Besides, Cheesy is still partner-less.)</p>

            <p>The question is though, considering how often a CAD crashes, would it really be responsible of DoSAT to put one in the Agent&#39;s mind? It&#39;s similar to why they won&#39;t put a CAD in the omni-tool from Mass Effect, citing the danger of putting such a dangerous device around an Agent&#39;s arm as the main reason.</p>

            <p>Well, the thing is, your omni-tool CAD (or a Pip-Boy CAD for that matter) would be subject to normal overheating and explosions, the typical hardware&#39;s reaction to the CAD crashing. If the omni-tool or Pip-Boy CAD crashed and exploded, the agent wouldn&#39;t have the time (or even the ability) to let go of the CAD. It&#39;d blow his/her/its arm off. <br><br>The thing is, Cheesy.exe&#39;s CAD would still freeze up and crash with the same bugs, but they have different effects.<br><br>When a normal CAD would freeze up and overheat, Cheesy.exe using his combined CAD subroutine (yes, I&#39;ll go all out and make it a combined CAD) would get massive &quot;headaches&quot;, freeze up himself (i.e. a paralysis effect), or even take damage. Note that by &quot;damage&quot; I don&#39;t mean actual damage, but instead, Pokemon-style HP that leads to fainting, not death- in other words, willpower.<br><br>And if the CAD would normally explode or melt, Cheesy.exe would faint.<br><br>In the Pokemon videogames (I&#39;m ignoring the anime and/or manga here, kinda like how one would ignore the LotR movies in favor of the books), fainting is not loss of consciousness. Otherwise, if you told a fainted Pokemon to use an HM move outside of battle, it wouldn&#39;t be able to. Instead, HP measures willpower, and fainting is losing the will to fight. This would translate to Cheesy.exe not being able to kill a Sue, or not being able to pick himself up and continue the mission, or even right down to not being able to fight against Suefluence, depending on how I would want to take it.<br><br>Combined with the fact that once he&#39;s &#39;rebooted&#39; (fully healed) and back to normal, he can use his CAD subroutine again as if nothing had ever happened, and the fact that running the risk of fainting wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near new for a Pokemon, and it looks like a great idea to DoSAT.</p>

            <p>I guess this means I can safely spell it as &quot;Pokemon&quot; without having to worry about getting swarmed by minis, right? XD<br><br>Anyway, &quot;Cheesy.exe&quot; sounds like a really fun character, and we definitely need more Pokemon agents (Falchion, my Skarmory agent, was adapted from one of my old Internet personas for precisely this reason). In particular, I really like how it handles certain courses of action (e.g. bleeprin) differently from other agents, as well as the way it perceives the world around it as well as Sues/Stus like a computer program. It would be interesting if, at least on early missions, it had a really hard time trying to figure out the age-old question of &quot;what&#39;s wrong with this picture&quot; - as someone with a bachelor&#39;s degree in computer science, I can sadly attest from experience that computer bugs take for-freaking-EVER to hunt down and correct.<br><br>The idea of a CAD being programmed into Cheesy.exe&#39;s software would also make for some pretty fun times as well - it would save DoSAT a few extra headaches, no doubt. I also have a humorous picture of it detecting a super-OOC canon and just spazzing out and sparking before going limp a la Death-Note-style heart failure, after which the other agent would have to revive it with either a Max Potion or some jumper cables hooked up to a car battery. It would make for some interesting black comedy, if nothing else.<br><br>The Mystery Dungeon sub-continuum would be pretty interesting to derive characters from, but Pokemon-speak would still be a notable barrier to work around. The programming of a Universal Translator may also have to be installed as well, so that Cheesy.exe can communicate in English or the language of choice. One must also consider the prospect of disguising it as well, which may allow it to speak the language of the form it&#39;s in.<br><br>As for a partner, I&#39;d recommend someone from a magic- and fantasy-based world, like Harry Potter or D&amp;D, maybe even Avatar (the cartoon) because we need more agents from that continuum too. The science and magic dichotomy would make for some very interesting interactions, and I can totally see Cheesy.exe trying to figure out this magic thing and failing as much as its partner tries to figure out the coding and glitches that it keeps talking about.<br><br>Overall, your agent concept is a solid one, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll make for some fantastic and hilarious writing. Please make Cheesy.exe a thing, pretty please! :)</p>

            <p>One misspelling, no matter how many times it&#39;s repeated, always creates the same mini. Otherwise we&#39;d have dozens of minis with the same name for common misspellings, and that would just be a mess for the adoption agencies.<br><br>This all reminded me of something. There was a thread a while back, I think a few months before I vanished, that proposed that minis would increase in mental power if they were invoked enough times or in a significant enough capacity. In that context, it was about &quot;canonical&quot; minis (misspellings that pass by the editors somehow and wind up in a finished work, i.e. the mini-Gohma &quot;Knox&quot; or the mini-Luggage &quot;Sibyl&quot;), but by that same principle, since the mini-Missingno &quot;Pokemon&quot; has been spawned hundreds of thousands of times, across the Internet and elsewhere, it must have accrued a massive amount of intelligence by this point. Even though I doubt it&#39;s been used in a canonical capacity, it&#39;s had a monumental amount of exposure to the readers of the world at this point.<br>To give that its logical extension, somewhere in the Pokйmon multiverse, constantly being ripped from fic to post to list to blog, there is a single glitched mini, now made not only sapient but super-intelligent by its constant invokation. I&#39;d imagine that said intellect combined with the fact that it&#39;s constantly being ripped across Word Worlds rapidly and incessantly has by this point given it at least some level of meta-cognizance, which would be extra-fun. If BBC-Sherlock can figure out he&#39;s a fictional character within minutes of being trapped in a plot hole, think of how much easier it would be for a being not only detached from reality by virtue of its species, but because of the many worlds of varying quality it&#39;s constantly being pulled into.<br><br>Okay, that probably isn&#39;t nearly as interesting an idea as I&#39;m currently thinking it is, but I&#39;d bet someone could make a plot device out of that at some point. </p>

            <p>Said job being to wrangle up all the Mini-Missingno. this thread alone has created.<br><br>Because according to the PPC wiki, the Pocket Monsters (using translation of Japanese name to avoid minis) continuum is &quot;particularly susceptible to Minis&quot; due to all the names with the accented E, like- no, I&#39;m not gonna give examples, we already have too many mini-Missingno. floating about.<br><br>I say that we place one spelling aside- say, no accent, or apostrophe-E, or E-apostrophe- as an acceptable, won&#39;t-generate-minis solution to this problem, as practically nobody in good old America (except for those who type in Spanish or something) has a keyboard capable of placing down an accented anything (unless you use an Android or Apple device with onscreen keyboard, but nobody&#39;s gonna type a fanfic on a phone or tablet.)<br><br>I propose the no-accent whatsoever version, as a good look around the Net shows that it&#39;s what most people that don&#39;t have accents use.

            <p>Okay, that&#39;s it, &quot;Cheesy&quot; is a nickname.<br><br>Well, without the accented E anywhere on an American keyboard, I&#39;m forced to spell it as &quot;Pokemon&quot;. Besides, half the Internet uses &quot;Pokemon&quot; for that exact same reason. But I can see where you&#39;re coming from.<br><br>On the subject of finding computer bugs, you&#39;re right, it does take FOREVER to find a bug in a computer program you&#39;re debugging. I have firsthand experience- a 0 instead of an O and you&#39;ll be sitting there forever trying to figure out where in the name of Arceus the problem is. However, why are you trying to find the bug in the first place? Because the computer threw up an error or something freaky happened. While Cheesy might not be able to pinpoint exactly what&#39;s wrong with the picture at first, he&#39;ll know almost instinctively that <i>something</i> is wrong.<br><br>On the subject of the CCAD subroutine (yes, it&#39;ll be a CCAD), that was the plan in and of itself, although I was thinking more Cheezy trying to read to his partner the results, going faster and faster as the subroutine freaks out, maybe even twitching a little, and the partner having to physically slap him to snap him out of it- or, if he happened to aim the subroutine at a wraith, having a BSOD-style stop error (read, fainting). So yeah, the partner would carry a bottle of Max Revives or something.<br><br>As for the Mystery Dungeon sub-continuum, I was actually thinking his being from there for language compatibility reasons. Then again, Pokemon from said sub-continuum are substantially more, ah, sapient than thier main-continuum counterparts, so I&#39;ll still go with PMD. As for actually breaching the language barrier, we&#39;re already going with Cheesy having a CCAD, might as well have a Universal Translator installed as well.<br><br>And finally, partner. I&#39;m not as familiar with the canons you brought up (except Harry Potter, but I&#39;m not much of a Potter nut), so I wouldn&#39;t be able to do them justice. However, the prospect of Cheesy and the partner confusing each other with science and magic is admittedly a fun one... perhaps a unicorn from MLP?</p>

            <p>I&#39;d nominate a partner from the Myst universe. That universe uses a pseudomagical system where books written in a formalized, descriptive language similar to a high-level programming language can be used to travel to the places they describe. Such a partner would have a good understanding of Cheesy as a being defined by executing instructions, even with little comprehension of modern technology.</p>

            <p>Well, my reasoning for the parsing errors bit is the way Cheesy.exe would be parsing the environment. While a wetware-based organism would see urple or wilver, Cheesy would get lines of data that basically fall through his RGB color format and show up as no color at all, or a &quot;missing texture&quot; (typical of default textures- what shows up when there&#39;s a missing texture- are magenta and a black and white checkerboard pattern), or, say, while his partner sees a (random example) &quot;fat skinny man&quot; as flickering between the two descriptions, Cheesy would see a glitchy mess as his environment parsing subroutine freaks out. This would also be relevant for generic surface, which shows up not as gray, but as magenta or a black and white checkerboard (You know, because even to wetware agents like humans, it&#39;s a missing-texture error)<br><br>As for Sues equaling viruses and/or glitches, that&#39;d be when he looks at a wraith outside a host (obviously a standard Mary Sue would still look like whatever it looks like to humans, barring conflicting description or Sue colors or whatnot), or tries to understand what the Sues and Sue Wraiths are doing to the canon.<br><br>Also related to parsing would be confusion. Unlike humans, computers don&#39;t give up when they get confused. Ever. Unless you program them just right, they keep trying to fit Variables A, B, and C into an equation when there&#39;s a readily available D that solves everything, or when there is no Variable C. They get stuck in infinite loops, and whatnot. He&#39;ll probably not be able to last very long in a mission without a partner to explain to him that &quot;Yes, the door looks 20 feet away when you look straight at it, yes, the door looks 2 feet away in peripheral vision, and yes, that&#39;s possible when you deal with Sues, now get a move on!&quot;</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know much about computers, but I did encounter a bunch of scifi in the 90&#39;s where they could program AI&#39;s to recognize loops and throw them out.<br><br>Did you ever read the story about the AI that was asked to design a faster-than-light ship?  It was a three-rules computer, and a different one completely fried because it determined that FTL travel would kill the humans inside the ship.  The second computer was somewhat child-like, and they coaxed it one formula at a time and kept reminding it that they would accept failure.  The second AI grew a sense of humor when it realized that the people would only die temporarily.  The test ship was stocked with nothing but baked beans and milk in unlabeled cans, though the cans were all different shapes.</p>

            <p>Well, it&#39;s supposed to be a joke. You&#39;re not referring to the person or place you attempted to name, you&#39;re referring to something else- the Mini. So unless it&#39;s the Mini-Missingno. that fly out of the English name for the &quot;Pocket Monsters&quot; franchise (That&#39;s a post on another part on this thread)...<br><br>Anyway, back to Cheesy and Corolla. First off, it wouldn&#39;t be just physical therapy or just mental therapy, it would be more ahh... both of those combined with surgery, since she&#39;s dinking about with Cheesy&#39;s innards (i.e. the code)? Yeah, sounds about right.<br><br>Second, I already mentioned him deleting the worst of his memories with a filesystem subroutine (from now on it will be referred to as &quot;bleeprin.sub&quot;)... perhaps I could add that bit in after a few missions?<br><br>Like, he reluctantly tries Bleeprin, only to discover that it doesn&#39;t work because his &quot;brain&quot; is structured so differently from a normal brain- and instead it actually corrupts a few lines of code. The code happens to be his modeling subroutine (the one that defines his meatspace body) and he ends up in wrapped in an excruciatingly-painful ball. He&#39;s sent to DoSAT, where Dr. Corolla fixes him up and after he tells her what happened, she writes bleeprin.sub and installs it... causing a few more glitches a few missions afterwards.<br><br>Other than that, I&#39;m agreeing with pretty much everything you said. (Other than &quot;mentor&quot; meaning &quot;doctor&quot;. In my book that still means &quot;teacher&quot;...)<br><br>...<br><br>I just realized that &quot;Dr. Corolla&quot; sounds like a strange mix between a Dr. Pepper knockoff and a brand of beer...</p>

            <p>Mordar is not a reference to LOTR. It is the name that my LARPING team use to describe the opposite team. I was a Mage and I could inflict death, freeze, and healing on the other players. I spent the whole game talking in a Medivel noble, and only on guy found it annoying.                                          I&#39;m going to give you to stories to work with today, Sorry  about the formatting, but my phone can&#39;t paragraph.  Do you know the campfire song &quot;there a whole in my bucket Dear Eliza, Dear Eliza?&quot; we sang that song at campfire and made up our own lyrics. Things got crazy. I believe it started with tape and ended with the safe word. No father comment.</p>

            <p>I won&#39;t post them all at once since its so late here. I will, however, post the first one right now. It was our campsite tour and, as a joke, we named it the Fellowship. For more fun we chose to nickname our selves after Fellowship members (I was Legolas. FYI ). When originally called ourselves the Batfamily (I was Cass Cain) but we dropped that name after we realized we kinda stink at Frissbee.

The Sandvich is primarily for extinguishing my Medic and the GRU are for quick transport. Become the team&#39;s damage sponge and the Medic&#39;s ьber target. Afterwards: Kill. Everything. </p>

            <p>I operate a little more slowly than most Spys.  I don&#39;t mess with the Engineers much, because I use spy in a defensive manner, and my team is usually on top of that.  It doesn&#39;t work for some people, admittedly, but it works for me.<br><br>Step 1) Find some hiding spots - I usually operate in an area that has several places to lay low.  In a CP or Payload map, that is usually somewhere near the first control point, en route to the rest of the map.<br><br>Step 2) Cloak and Dagger - If you can stay invisible forever, you can play the long game.  Wait for your moment to strike.<br><br>Step 3) Pick your target - How can you best break the other team&#39;s momentum?  Is there a particular Heavy giving you trouble?  Take him out.  Take him out again.  Keep taking him out.  (This is how I got the &quot;Dirty Backstabber&quot; nickname.  I took their best player out of the game for the second half of the map.)  I avoid Medics, personally.  They tend to be more suspicious than anyone else.  Let the Snipers take care of them later.<br><br>Step 4) Hit and run - Kill your target, then immediately cloak and run.  Don&#39;t go for the double kill.  Don&#39;t get fancy.  Just strike and reset.  After a while, they will send in the Pyros.  Just lay low and move only as much as you need to stay out of their way.<br><br>Step 4) Teleporters from Spawn - If they are bypassing you with teleporters, use them to gain the advantage.  Few Engi&#39;s, in my experience, are immediately suspicious of teammates who teleport in.  Have your sapper and knife ready to cause chaos on the other end.<br><br><br>Rule number 1, in my book, is &quot;Draw their attention.&quot;  That sounds backwards, for a Spy, but it isn&#39;t.  If your opponents have to divert resources to hunt down a single, troublesome Spy, then you are doing your job.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I use the Ambassador for my pistol.  It helps if I need to take out a troublesome Medic or Engi.  A few good head shots and they go down pretty quick.<br><br>For the knife, I just use my &quot;Dirty Backstabber&quot; which is just a stock knife with a name.  You might also go with Your Eternal Reward, if you don&#39;t mind the lack of choice for your disguise.<br><br>As for the watch, I stick with the Cloak and Dagger.  Like I said, I like to play the long game, and that lets me set up and wait for my chance.  The Dead Ringer is, I feel, overused.  Sure it can keep you from dying, but you know what else can do that?  Not getting caught.  You&#39;re better off with the normal watch or the C&amp;D (especially since your opponent will assume you are using the DR anyway).<br><br>This is, of course, just personal preference.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Ehh, I&#39;m too new to the game have any good strategies, but I do have one that I consider good...<br><br>When doing a Payload map as Blu, I &quot;pull&quot; the cart by positioning myself right in front of the cart and letting the cart push me, that way I&#39;m not caught blind by Red forces in front of the cart. If anybody tries to attack from behind, I hope to the gods above that there&#39;s someone behind the cart and pushing, and that if there is, he&#39;s looking backwards. First time I did it I got in the MVP list three times in four matches, but I haven&#39;t yet been able to replicate that...</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll give you Payload strats... and some general tips too.<br><br><br>- The bomb cart moves fastest with three players on the point. Additional players do not make it move faster.<br><br>- The cart acts like a level 1 dispenser.<br><br>- Scouts count for two people when capping.<br><br>- Have a Pyro watch the cart and spray fire everywhere. Spies often prey on the cart pushers since they usually face the front, where the rest of RED are.<br><br>- Always assume there is a Spy watching the cart. That Heavy over there <i>not</i> on the cart, right next to that convenient escape route? Spy. Kill him with fire.<br><br>- Unless you see they disappear in front of you, assume all enemy Spies have the <a href="http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dead_Ringer">Dead Ringer</a> on them. They&#39;re not dead. Be super paranoid.<br><br>- Tell your Engineer if his teleporter placement is off. If the enemy team is camping the exit, warn your team instead of sending them to pointless deaths.<br><br>- Camp the enemy teleporter exit. A dead player is better than a delayed player.<br><br>- As BLU team Engineer, POOT DISPENSER as close to the action as possible so your team can restock/heal up in seconds. Keep the pressure on RED.<br><br>- Upgrade, repair, and watch over your fellow Engineers&#39; buildings! Two wrenches (and metal supplies) are better than one.<br><br>- RED takes 15 seconds to respawn on a Payload map. BLU takes 5. If RED takes a big hit, BLU <i>will</i> push that cart very far.<br><br>- Learn how to rocket/sticky jump. <br><br>- See that little red/blue dot on the wall at head height over there? There&#39;s a Sniper watching that corner. Hang on to your head and use the cart as cover.<br><br>- Most Pyros know how to airblast rockets back at you. Pull out your shotgun instead, it confuses the heck out of them.<br><br>- Do not try to mкlйe a Pyro to death.<br><br>- A Pyro does not suffer from burn damage.<br><br>- The Pyro is neither a man or a woman. It is the embodiment of pure malice in an asbestos suit.<br><br>- A Spy drops his disguise when he uses any weapon except the sapper. Use this information to determine who is a real teammate and who has never fired a shot and is currently sneaking up behind you with his primary in his hands.<br><br>- Keep an eye on the chat. Someone without a mic might be trying to relay information to the team.<br></p>

            <p>&gt;I knew the first three items. (Thank you, TF2 wiki and Team Service Announcement vids) As for the scout bit, I also know that the Pain Train makes Soldiers and Demomen also count as two people- and that both Scouts and Pain Train Soldiers/Demomen also count double while pushing the cart. (hence the Train bit? I dunno.)<br>&gt;That Pyro bit might be the secret to the pull-the-cart strategy I mentioned- a pyro in back, some other class in front, and then a third class somewhere. Hmm.<br>&gt;The camping teleporter exit bit actually goes against the Team Service Announcement, which said to destroy enemy teleporters instead of camp. I&#39;m now unsure which to do.<br>&gt;I agree with the last Pyro bit and add that Spies are just as bad. Seriously, I have my fair share of surprise kills already, I kinda don&#39;t need a class made for the job.<br>&gt;If your team has more than two of Snipers and Spies combined, or has more than five of Engineers, Snipers, and Spies combined, there&#39;s a big problem.</p>

            <p>First of all, let&#39;s just make this very clear: spawncamping is not fun. Not being able to play the game is really, really frustrating. That being said, stalling the enemy team is very useful. <br><br><br>Suppose we&#39;re on <a href="http://tf2newbs.com/newbs_upload/badwaternames.png%22">Badwater</a>. Click on the link to see the labeled map. I&#39;m BLU and my team has captured the third point. At this point Badwater becomes this huge mess of RED sentries, Snipers, and Spies: without a coordinated ьber push into Pit, there is no way to break their defences. I build my tele entrance near second BLU spawn and the exit in Attic, near the window. I usually set up my nest behind Sniper Room  to repel RED flanking maneuvers coming from Spiral Stairs. <br><br>Now, I can&#39;t easily check if my tele exit is clear: doing so will mean having to walk back to Attic Steps for twenty seconds, and that is waaaayyyyy too long to leave my sentry unattended. I have no choice but to trust my teammates to keep the area clear. <br><br>Let&#39;s add some complications. A RED Heavy-Medic ьber pair push up Ramp and completely wipe my team. While they&#39;re respawning, they make it to Attic and hear my teleporter. The Hoovy revs up his minigun and waits. <br><br>The most information I have at this point is that my team was killed at Ramp by an ьber pair. I have no idea where the Heavy is. Nobody interrupts me at my nest so I assume either the Heavy ducked back into Pit to resupply at a dispenser or he pushed into Attic. If none of my teammates say anything, I have no idea where he went.<br><br>My teammates start respawning and queue for the tele (except for Scouts, for whom the tele is a waste of time). They get picked off one by one as they pop out the other end. They wait to respawn again, wasting valuable seconds that could&#39;ve counted towards a push.<br><br>Here&#39;s the crux of the matter: if I know someone is camping my tele,  I will remotely destroy the exit and rebuild somewhere else, thereby allowing my team to continue spawning at a forward position. If nobody tells me anything, I assume the tele is clear and continue watching Spiral Stairs. Most people don&#39;t play with a mic or say stuff in the chat, so I&#39;m flying blind. <br><br>Eventually someone will wise up and walk over to Attic and challenge the Heavy-Medic pair. But until then, my teleporter is not helping the team and no pressure is being put on RED. All of that wasted time contributes to our defeat.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>I hear you loud and clear on the spawncamping issue.<br>Up until then, I hadn&#39;t really seen much in the way of this issue- then again, my first instinct is to jump on text teamchat and yell that I just got telecamped, but still.<br><br>This does, however, make a lot more long-term sense than the Team Service Announcement&#39;s version, and I quote:<br><br>&quot;Bonus Tip: Don&#39;t camp teleporter exits. Leaving the exit active so you can score a few cheap kills will only end with someone eventually killing you, and the teleporter still running. Even if you lay sticky bombs around it and wait for someone to come out, someone could show up and kill you while you&#39;re waiting. Just destroy it and go do helpful things.&quot;<br><br>Also, here&#39;s the video in question:<br><br> width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;//<a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AydkhtMl4nQ?feature=player_detailpage">www.youtube.com/embed/AydkhtMl4nQ?feature=player_detailpage</a>&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;<br><br>...Dammit, embed doesn&#39;t work.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=AydkhtMl4nQ">Here&#39;s the video.</a></p>

            <p>If the enemy team is still going strong, you need to break their momentum first. Destroying the teleporter is then a good choice. If the enemy team is pushed to the last control point, you must stop them from securing a foothold. Once again, telecamping is not advisable. If they&#39;ve been beaten back or they&#39;re playing really sloppy, you can afford a little bit of camping before destroying the tele and falling back to a more defensible position.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t imagine what use they&#39;d be. If you were blinded at the first sign of danger, not only is that a dead giveaway that <i>something</i> is wrong, so the very mechanism that prevents the user from being alarmed would alarm the user, you can&#39;t see what&#39;s coming, so that further panics the wearer.<br><br>It&#39;d be like Twilight in the episode It&#39;s About Time. She finds out that something is gonna happen and when it&#39;s gonna happen, but not what it is. She ends up flipping her lid.<br><br>And to make matters worse, the kind of danger that would most likely happen could probably endanger the wearer.<br><br>Also they don&#39;t seem to be able to fit over my prescription glasses without being lopsided...<br><br>It&#39;s still an interesting novelty piece, and also an interesting fusion of magic danger-sensing items and those special prescription glasses whose lenses darken like sunglasses&#39; in sunlight, so thank you nonetheless. It&#39;ll probably go on my shelf next to my can of infinite cookies from my original welcome thread.</p>

            <p>Agent Kimberly had a good &quot;vacation&quot; by working in Despatch and working in My Little Pony and other continua that she wasn&#39;t familiar with, but her knowledge of Supernatural and various other realistic worlds would be wasted, and Hue couldn&#39;t work there even if he survives his breakdown.<br><br>Rats, Bats, and Vats is a story where genetically-manipulated rodents and bats were grown and then cybernetically-enhanced to fight in a war.  DoSAT went on a little looting trip to retrieve some dead rats and bats to study the uplift technology and the &quot;slow shields&quot; that were also implanted in them.<br><br>I could go two ways with this... either one of the rats was not quite dead, or someone who didn&#39;t know about the universe decided to implant one of the looted chips into a new brain.  (The personality and memories reside in the chip, so effectively a canon bit could be resurrected into a new body.)<br><br>Either way, the uplifted creature would be downright lewd and have a knowledge of Shakespeare, resulting in some very interesting dialogue that would sound strange but not lewd to modern audiences.<br><br>It would turn the tables where Kim would be the one balking where her partner would be fine with watching.<br><br>The disadvantage to leaving him as a surviving rat is that his metabolism is ridiculous.  He&#39;d ride in her bag most of the time to conserve energy, and Kim would have to keep a full box of energy bars to eliminate the threat of him deciding to eat her.  On missions with a Sue, the method of disposal would always include him eating her best parts.<br><br>If he remains a rat, his slow-shield absolutely must be altered by DoSAT to include an off-switch.<br><br>I&#39;d prefer that he do a few missions as a rat, then somehow get killed so that his new body is something that is appropriate for his job, rather than some random animal that might or might not be appropriate.  (Though I am willing to go domesticated dog as long as it&#39;s not a chihuahua.) </p>

            <p>The first thing that jumps out at me is the issue of scale- an Agent small enough to ride on someone else&#39;s shoulder would actually be something I&#39;d like to see happen. It would, however, make actually affecting his environment very difficult, so he&#39;d end up being either completely dependent on his partner or possessed of, I dunno, telekinetics or something. Disguises would help with this, but to do so they&#39;d also have to eliminate the main trait that sets him apart from the other Agents.<br><br>If we&#39;re not leaving him a rat, I do have to question what would happen to the personality of the &quot;host&quot; the chip gets implanted into. There&#39;s some MAJOR ethical concerns to that, even if the host body is not sentient.</p>

            <p>Assuming that the smaller Agent doesn&#39;t just get disguised into something bigger every single time, if DoSAT could make a comparably-sized CAD and some sort of miniature recording device, a small Agent could be <i>very</i> effective at going where their partner couldn&#39;t to get charges, take readings, and sneak up on or distract a Sue.

            <p>Look at it from a buisiness standpoint. You&#39;re a Flower with two courses of action. You could neuralyze this character and let him go with no knowledge of the PPC, or you could hire him.<br><br>If this character is going to be difficult and won&#39;t do the Duty unless he gets things other agents don&#39;t, <b>I&#39;m not going to hire him.</b> I&#39;m gonna neuralyze this guy and throw him back in the sewers or whatever he came from.<br><br>And as for characterization, like I said, I don&#39;t care one way or the other whether he has a gimmick or not. Characters don&#39;t need a gimmick to survive, but won&#39;t die if they have them. Heck, just look at Cheesy. The only reason you&#39;d want a gimmick is so you can build a character with the gimmick as something to help define the character. Okay, so your character is an A.I., how is he gonna deal with that? Okay, so your character is in a rat&#39;s body, how is he gonna deal with that?<br><br>The thing that DOES make a difference, and DOES make a character stand on its own, is characterization. A personality. If there&#39;s a gimmick, the personality has to support the gimmick. If there&#39;s no gimmick, no problem, you don&#39;t need a gimmick to be a personality.<br><br>If Cheesy didn&#39;t have a personality he&#39;d just be another Porygon-Z, you can get boxes full of them in any Pokemon game after the fourth generation.<br><br>And if your character doesn&#39;t have a personality he&#39;s gonna be just another rat in the sewer.<br><br>However, at least you have a start with &quot;likes rum and chocolate, hates being told what to do.&quot; Just make sure that the personality you create is hire-able.<br><br></p>

            <p>You have some detail going on here with <i>what</i> your agents <i>are</i>, but there&#39;s not very much of what they&#39;re <i>like</i>.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying this is a necessarily a bad thing- certainly, having a species and some kind of background attached to them is a good thing- it&#39;s very useful to know when a character is human or not human, as the case may be!- but it doesn&#39;t give them anything to make them stand out as interesting <i>characters</i>, rather than things.<br><br>Yes, a character can be more memorable when these things add to them on top of them being memorable via being interesting characters due to their actions and personality, but it doesn&#39;t help them stand out.<br><br>Lemme try to explain this in different terms.<br><br>Let&#39;s think of characters in terms of food.<br><br>Your average poorly written character is junk food of various levels of quality. When you add things on top of that- loads of powers, extra special things, super unique things that don&#39;t really do anything but be there for the sake of being there- it&#39;s added junk. Sugar, sugar substitute, those dyes that make food all those great colors only found naturally in poisonous or venomous animals or plantlife- all that. It&#39;s fluff and adds no nutritional content. <br><br>When a character is written in a way that doesn&#39;t rely on those sort of things, it adds nutritional value. For example, let&#39;s take one of my favorite characters: Sam Vimes from Discworld. <br><br>Vimes starts off as a very sorry sad sack of alcoholism and profound cynicism. There is nothing about him that makes him apparently special in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>What makes him an interesting character is what he&#39;s like and how he <i>reacts</i> to everything. That&#39;s where the meat and potatoes is. Vimes doesn&#39;t become more interesting by being forcibly further and further up in terms of importance through the progression of what&#39;s going on in the Disc- it&#39;s his reactions and how they build on top of each other to give us a very vivid image of this man and what he&#39;s like. His reaction to things. <br><br>All you&#39;ve given here is the uplifted character is lewd and has knowledge of Shakespeare and is fine with presumably gross things, which tells us very little in the grand scheme of things. As a character point, it&#39;s not all that compelling.<br><br>A few years back when I was first getting into the PPC, I read every single spin off, mission, side story and otherwise available PPC thing available online at the time. Kept up with loads of spin-offs since then and plenty of agent ideas.<br><br>I could not to save my life tell you how many of the ones that I found dead boring were the ones with all the junk food details added on because I don&#39;t remember them. There are a few that were memorable, but not as characters with compelling personalities or arcs. Instead, it was for the sheer amount of <i>fluff</i> that had been added on that resulted in something that was completely ridiculous and out of place.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that the uplift is a bad idea, but I do think you should consider more than just the <i>what</i> of the character; think about how they act, react, their personality, how they <i>are</i>. <br><br>When it comes to characters and writing, it should come down to qualities, not quantities. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s a case of I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re like until I start working with them.  And he&#39;ll probably have a few quirks different if he wakes up in a new body.<br><br>If he stays a rat, he won&#39;t care for the Duty, he&#39;ll be in it for the rum.  (I will be able to get him real rum in HQ?  He&#39;ll have no need for bleep products.)  He probably won&#39;t care about Kim much at first, either.<br><br>The first mission will probably have Kim threatening to take his rum away.

            <p>I find that it is easier for me to create a character if I start out with a basic outline and some personality traits, and let them &quot;grow&quot; as they react to the events around them. Their personalities fill out as they have a chance to interact with more of the world around them. If I start out rigidly prescribing everything about their personality, it can feel artificial and it may not serve the needs of the story very well.<br><br>But that&#39;s more a matter of style. The important thing isn&#39;t exactly how a writer gives a character their personality; it&#39;s that they do eventually end up with one.<br><br>Oh, here&#39;s a very silly but effective trick I use: I pretend I&#39;m talking to my character, asking them about themselves, about recent events, or about their past. If you&#39;re at all into role-playing, you might find that useful, if you can get past the &quot;oh jeez, I&#39;m sitting here talking to myself&quot; angle.</p>

            <p>Hi, I&#39;m Tira.  I originally joined about two years ago; then I fell off the face of the earth, thanks to college.

It should be noted that Natalie in particular is a work in progress; I&#39;ve just gotten my hands on an English translation of the Fate/Zero novels, and hopefully those will help me make her a more authentic part of the &#39;verse than year-old memories of the anime and the somewhat Engrish-y wiki.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PWKFmBGwWAeGeE6cPnQQl5jLoVqXtHzlGxT9_z3ZIY/edit?usp=sharing">Aaron Hunter</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SQaBPXp0mbuvk1rsnPA7MKdfIFECxe4KMyhHD51Rn-g/edit?usp=sharing">Natalie Morgan</a></p>

            <p>That&#39;s one of the two characters I named her after, the other being Black Widow.  Originally, I was going to say that she picked the name out in honor of those characters, but I couldn&#39;t come up with a decent enough badfic name for her.  She was actually called Natasha in some drafts, but I don&#39;t understand Russian last names.<br><br>Within the context of her original fic, Natalie was intended to have been created by a Suethor who completely missed the point of Fate/Zero in favor of &quot;omg Gil is so hawt!!&quot; and perceived Kiritsugu as &quot;super meen!&quot;  So she created an antagonist who was similar to him, persecuting the Sue by trying to kill her for things that were totally not the Sue&#39;s fault at all! (Like killing a bunch of people by mistake.  But the Sue angsted about it, so it was okay.)  You could tell Natalie was totally not justified because she used icky guns instead of having cool &#39;magickal&#39; powers.  Naturally, the assassins didn&#39;t exactly agree with this assessment...<br><br>In-universe, I can see Natalie teasingly flirting with Aaron to make him uncomfortable, in the same way that Natalya does with Kiritsugu, and claiming that, as an attractive &quot;onee-san&quot; figure who isn&#39;t actually related to him, it&#39;s either that or be so blindingly immature as to appear incompetent (a la Taiga), and he doesn&#39;t have good enough aim for the latter option.</p>

            <p>What universes you intend to use these two for?<br><br>I guess I got to buckle down and watch AOT.  (Stupid Netflix, forcing me to read subtitles or go to less legit sites for the dubs.)  What I do see about Aaron is interesting.  He seems like a good foil for Natalie.  What will his dual memories do to him, if anything?<br><br>I&#39;m liking Natalie&#39;s attitude that she acts cool about what&#39;s happening and redirects her emotions like a weapon.  She reminds me of one of my own with the snarking and the smoking.  <br><br>Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re different enough.  But I would like to show you something that was said about my less-flappable character...  <br><br>&quot;Agent Feinstein feels like a rather unique character for the PPC. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve had a brusque secretarial personality in an agent before, and that alone makes her entertaining to watch/read. At first, I was worried that she was too aloof from things happening around her, since a large source of a mission&#39;s entertainment value comes from what the agents experience. But you showed that she is stuck facing missions of a type particularly distasteful to her, and that she isn&#39;t necessarily the best at thinking on her feet when she is met with an unexpected encounter.&quot;<br><br>For yours, she already takes things out on the target.  Does she ever put in extra range time or train on a punching bag to get rid of leftover problems?  Will she ever snap and go too far?  Will anything ever phase her?<br><br>I got caught up in the description of &quot;not being able to control her powers unless it was inconvenient&quot; until I figured out that you were describing the Sue.  I&#39;m going to blame my poor reading habits for that one.</p>

            <p>Probably a lot of fantasy literature, video games, and some high-action seinen anime.<br><br>Aaron&#39;s dual memories mostly mean that he can reference the canon plot of Fallout 3 while still having awkward reactions to AoT!Mikasa and Armin, because they&#39;re basically his childhood friends.<br><br>Natalie does get flustered, just not in combat situations.  If/when she snaps, I think she&#39;d get very businesslike (as opposed to Aaron, who tends to start shaking and fly into homicidal rages).  That&#39;s the point she pulls out the &quot;shoot them in the lungs and charge them while they drown in their own blood&quot; trick, which Upstairs is very, very much not in favor of.  She does put in a lot of time at the range, but more for fun than anything; she&#39;s kind of a gun nut.<br><br>Personally, I can&#39;t watch the dubbed version; we watched the sub in in my Anime Club, and once I&#39;ve seen one version, switching VA&#39;s is just too disconcerting.</p>

            <p>That incredibly unhelpful response aside, I really do laugh at what are supposed to be the jokes.  I think most of the writers here do a very good job of creating interesting characters, and I enjoy their interactions.  Typically it&#39;s the bits that happen &#39;around&#39; the badfic that I find the funniest - to use an example from the Original Series, I still laugh my head off at the Cheese Elves.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not the humor that draws me in, either. My favorite part of the PPC is seeing a pair of wily agents outsmart a god-moding Mary-sue or slashwraith, or surviving crazy SPAG issues, or surviving each other&#39;s near-flamethrower-craziness. I&#39;ve always enjoyed reading well-written battle or conflict, especially ones where the fight is closely matched and the combatants think outside the box to win the fight. It needn&#39;t be physical fighting; it can be court intrigue or hunting down a criminal or, on a lighter note, planning a really good prank.<br><br>The PPC really lends itself to that kind of thing because on the one hand, you have a nearly brainless and effectively non-sentient but extremely powerful reality-bender, and on the other side you have a couple of characters who are either ordinary people or ordinary for their continuum, but who are capable of thinking and planning and figuring things out, and in the end sneaking around and sticking a dagger where it needs to go. When PPC agents have talents or powers, they use them creatively. They make mistakes and get annoyed with each other and recover from setbacks. It&#39;s a really nice setup for conflict.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m considering making The Request sometime in the future (although that&#39;s still a ways off, I&#39;ve yet to finish a Project and would like to provide a sample of my writing first).

<br>    <li>Smithers appears in, roughly, his original Half-Life 1 incarnation- thin and almost completely bald, with thick, black-plastic-framed glasses.

<br>    <li>Smithers wields a personally tweaked SPAS-12 shotgun from his home continuum, and is quite terrible with it. He is consistently unable to hit anything save at point-blank range, so he usually prefers to use a disguise that allows him to get quite close to the Sue or other hazard. Like all Black Mesa scientists, he has earned a Generic PhD. that provides him limited knowledge in a wide array of fields- in practice, that means he can correct incompetent Suethors on anything I can easily look up, but lacks the specialized knowledge of a proper World 1 scientist.</li>
<br>    <li>In his personal life, Smithers is fastidious and methodical, if a bit crotchety- woe to the mini that distrubs his neat stacks of canon materials and scientific journals. On missions, however, he tends to play fast and loose with the Rules, and the Flowers know exactly how to make him pay for it. This is the primary reason why he was &quot;saddled&quot; with Agent Wtak as a partner, although the efficacy of that decision remains to be seen. Therefore, the majority of missions he will be given will classify as &quot;punishment&quot; for past and current incidents of unacceptable looting, canon contamination, and &quot;forgotten&quot; charge lists.

            <p>As far as I know, even minor canon characters are needed to play their role in canon and cannot be recruited.<br><br>You may try to pretend that this is an ancient game nobody wants to play anymore, so that Smithers‘ absence would never be noticed (I don’t know whether this is true for Half Life I), but I don’t really believe that you might get away with this.<br><br>Smithers might have to deal with occasionally being called back into the game to do his duty. This may be quite inconvenient while being on a mission, but fortunately he doesn’t have to stay in the game long. Anyway it only works if you can reasonably expect that worldwide not more than one person per day would try to play Half Life I. <br><br>You need to get more opinions from Boarders who know the game before you dare to do this.

            <p>I hadn&#39;t really considered Smithers needing to be present whenever Half-Life 1 is played. The way I saw it working involved the Half-Life continuum, Headquarters, and World 1 not being simultaneous with each other: the Black Mesa disaster happens at a specific point in time in the Half-Life continuum, and when someone from World 1 plays Half-Life 1, they are in essence looking back in time to that period and playing through it, even though the two worlds don&#39;t run so that one second here equals one second there.<br><br>Thus, from his perspective and Half-Life&#39;s, Smithers left for the PPC some time between Half-Life: Blueshift and Half-Life 2 and never permanently returned to his home (which is why he does not exist in Half-Life 2). Since people playing Half-Life 1 are experiencing a slice of time in the Half-Life continuum from before he ever left, regardless of when in World 1 they decide to play the game, the old Smithers would still be there. In fact, if he did come back to Half-Life at the time of the Black Mesa disaster, a player might encounter two Smitherses: one who was working at the facility like he should have been, and one who will have escaped Black Mesa, left the continuum entirely in the very near future, spent 10 of his years in a place where time flows at a different rate, then traveled back in time to before he ever left.</p>

            <p>I suppose &quot;adopting&quot; a canon character who only appeared once or twice isn&#39;t too much different from recruiting a bit character. You&#39;ll have to ask an older member, though; I&#39;m fairly new as well.<br><br>The idea of Wtak killing things with writing makes me think he could be able to manipulate the Words. I&#39;m probably wrong, but it&#39;d be cool to see how that power/skill gets used against Sues regardless.<br><br>I don&#39;t quite understand how Smithers can be &quot;fastidious and methodical&quot; but careless about the Rules at the same time. Wouldn&#39;t a methodical personality apply on missions as well? (But on the bright side, that desire for order might make dealing with Wtak easier. Might; I know very little about Halo.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure how powerful in use of the Words I&#39;d want to make Wtak, given that he is already the much more combat-capable of the two. I&#39;m also not sure how one would go about using the Words to kill something without making the stress on Canon worse, but I know that if the fic creates any particularly hostile malapropisms on their own they will play a role in that fic&#39;s demise.<br><br><br>Regarding Smithers, the contradiction is intentional, and I doubt Wtak would miss the chance to call him out on his hypocrisy if told to clean up the RC. I&#39;m thinking that deep down, Smithers is set in his ways enough that he has trouble respecting rules other than his own. That seems a dangerous trait for an Agent to have, but to some degree that&#39;s what Wtak is there for.</p>

            <p>Hmmm, I don&#39;t think there are any canon characters working in the PPC.  There are such things as recruit-able character replacements and duplicates that aren&#39;t Sues.  Either way, I&#39;d make him completely human, though perhaps the trouble with walls has to do with old age.<br><br>Be careful with how much he breaks the rules.  Perhaps he could want to, but his partner keeps yelling that he doesn&#39;t want anymore punishment fics.  (Look up Suebuprofen.)  Ah, I see that his partner is very by-the-book.<br><br>Clean-cut, does that mean Wtak doesn&#39;t have the full-length mohawk?  Doesn&#39;t seem to go with vain unless it isn&#39;t mating plumage.<br><br>The magic seems interesting.  I wonder how many missions he&#39;d actually get to use that.  <br><br><br></p>

            <p>1) I mean, it&#39;s not as though I&#39;d write a badfic bit differently from a canon bit at all, but that does bring up the question of &quot;if his canon status doesn&#39;t affect anything, why is it <i>there?</i>&quot;... the main thing I&#39;m getting out of this, though, is that I&#39;m interested in and want to explore more thoroughly the idea of Agent Smithers being a duplicate of the canon version. It somewhat folds into an idea I&#39;ve been tossing around about what the Department of Redundancy Department actually <i>does</i>...<br><br>2) He definitely doesn&#39;t get away with it very often, although since both Wtak and Smithers are very competent Agents it might be in my best interest to have them trying to confront each other as much as they try to deal with the badfic. Also, I sort of wanted to throw Smithers some unusual or funny punishments, most of which involve getting him extremely dirty, being forced to use wildly unsuitable weapons, etc.<br><br>3) I meant it more figuratively than literally, i.e. I&#39;d refer to him as a &quot;suit-and-tie sort of Agent&quot; even though he doesn&#39;t actually wear anything of the sort. He&#39;s actually quite protective of his plumage, although it has been toned down from its original wilver by Medical.<br><br>4) Well, the story I&#39;ve been looking at for Mission 1 has a Cortana replacement who was going to be killed via shell scripting, and the one after that is a TES: Skyrim fic...</p>

She becomes friends with the Marauders despite their canonical hate of Slytherins, she disses Hufflepuffs (okay, so does everyone), she commandeers a class of Slughorn&#39;s for some reason, and her best friend thinks she needs a husband at sixteen.

However, it reeks of grammatical errors (mainly capitalization) and is really badly structured.

            <p>I&#39;m continuing on the path of scrolling the Pit for badfic, and have now unearthed a dark!Harry--which, okay, I can see that being done well, but not when twelve-year-old Harry admits to the diary horcrux--right after seeing the memory of Tom Riddle accusing Hagrid, the first person Harry remembers being nice to him, of opening the Chamber--that he finds the panic with the basilisk funny. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10347022/1/Shared-Diary-of-Orphans"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10347022/1/Shared-Diary-of-Orphans">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10347022/1/Shared-Diary-of-Orphans</a></a><br><br>Good luck, if you want to read it. It also features the diary somehow knowing all about events that happened after Riddle graduated, despite there being no sensible way for Ginny to have told him, Riddle saying he wouldn&#39;t kill Muggleborns, Harry at twelve saying that he thinks he&#39;s dark and not being upset by this...and, in the prologue, &#39;little horcrux&#39; being used as a pet name. <br><br>In addition to that rather creepy bit, there&#39;s the fact that one conversation with Riddle in which Dumbledore was never mentioned led Harry to conclude that Dumbledore had staged the entire first book. Also, Dumbledore said Harry was exaggerating the way the Dursleys treated him, which didn&#39;t happen anywhere in canon. There&#39;s some funny irony in that Harry can&#39;t wait to get away from Ron, who is an &#39;annoying, bigoted moron,&#39;...so he can go talk to Tom Riddle. Who of course is nothing near bigoted, right?<br><br>And Hermione is neglected by her parents and is studying the Dark Arts.

Or, I&#39;m sorry, &#39;Hermionie,&#39; who has, true to form, changed a lot over the summer. Anything describing Hermione&#39;s hair as &#39;sexy ringlets&#39; is bad, right? Especially if Hermione&#39;s doing the describing, in the first person. Also either OOC or replaced Draco, as he&#39;s happy that his father got the Dementor&#39;s Kiss. Also, it&#39;s rated M on the Pit, as a warning.<br><br>Other than that, in the way of problems, there&#39;s a lot of gratuitous capitalization and OOC canons, tense changes--really really bad tense changes--lack of proper punctuation (I think the author has something against question marks and commas), Ron-bashing, creation of uncanonical locations (ie the Head Boy/Girl Common Room with only one bathroom), bad spelling, making Hermione a total Sue, changing the Hogwarts uniform, lack of consistency regarding the Hogwarts uniform...this is from four out of eleven chapters. I doubt it gets better. </p>

            <p>Apparently she was born with it--the necromancy, that is. Which is why Voldemort wants her on his side. So, of course, all the death eaters alienate her and treat her horribly, because that makes total sense. </p>

            <p>Yeah, everything I mentioned? It turns out in the latest chapter that the Marauders have only known her for a WEEK. I wasn&#39;t sure how much time had passed, but I was hoping that it was closer to a month...<br><br>...on a lighter note, though, apparently if she has Voldemort&#39;s kid, the war will be over in &#39;a matter of minuets.&#39; <br><br>Also, she apparently routinely seriously injures people who insult, threaten, or hit her but has never stood up against her father. <br><br>It just keeps getting worse.

            <p>But it does strike me as a bit backwards way of doing things. Why would you want to make an agent page before you have Permission? It&#39;s just as easy to make one after getting it and then you won&#39;t have to move anything.<br><br>Not to mention, that it happens regularly that new boarders ask for permission and are denied but told that &#39;Agent X needs to have her backstory fleshed out and you need to dial the psi-powers of Agent Y way back, then you can try again&#39;. Then, in addition to rewriting their Permission request, they also have to update the agents&#39; pages.</p>

            <p>Re: &quot;modern Godzilla&quot; - You&#39;re thinking of the 1998 movie, no doubt. Almost everybody agrees that the monster from that movie is an entirely separate character from the Big G himself. The 2014 version, which was a lot more faithful to the spirit of the original, turns up in San Fransisco, though it&#39;s to fight a different monster rather than to destroy the city itself.<br><br>So yeah, visiting Maryland would make no sense unless he either: a) swam all the way around South America, which would&#39;ve taken a few weeks at least, or b) passed through the Panama Canal or even over dry land, which would be both uncomfortable for him (he&#39;s supposedly a sea-dwelling animal, after all) and also would&#39;ve resulted in him being seen by a lot more people, not to mention a lot sooner.</p>

It&#39;s a crossover of... well, practically everything! Orli!Legolas is in there, but most of the main cast are <i>Labyrinth</i>, <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>, and <i>Les Miserables</i>.

            <p>I rediscovered GND about six months ago. I&#39;m a big fan of both her art style -- she moves so easily between cartoony and serious -- and the story lines she creates. The light-heartedness of it (most of the time anyway) appeals to me a bit more than the original &#39;Roommates&#39; does.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been combing through what little exists on the Despatch, and there&#39;s been problems.<br><br>I&#39;m interpreting it as they do make mistakes and end up taking an OC that looks like a real person.  (I can&#39;t find the story, but it seems that occasionally goodfics get sent to agents, or the fics get sent to wrong departments.)<br><br>For Teddy Bear, I can&#39;t find the original fic, but it looks like the only reason they had a Despatch team is that the real Tokyo invaded a Sailor Moon / LOTR crossover.  There isn&#39;t any ending, but it&#39;s possible that the Sue-spirit was inhabiting a real person who needed to be sent home alongside the canons.<br><br>Before I start looking for anything else that would be a Despatch mission, perhaps some clarifications?  There was also someone who was bothered by the entire concept of messing with unkillable self-inserts.</p>

            <p>Anyone else have an opinion?<br><br>I have a lot of projects that are tied up by not knowing if Despatch should still exist as a department or as a DIC specialty, and if the procedures are still relevant.  <br><br>Also, does PP...angle all crossovers?  I&#39;m talking about stories that lack OCs.  Or the OCs are there to support the stories and there are no canons who could play their role.

            <p>Don&#39;t remove Despatch as a department. Their purpose is entirely distinct from the DIC:<br><br>-Implausible Crossovers deal with crossovers between canons. Everyone they meet is a canon character with a home to go to, and will need neuralysing.<br><br>-The DMS deals, in part, with &#39;crossovers&#39; between a canon and a Mary Sue, such as the girl-who-falls-into-Middle-earth. It doesn&#39;t matter to them where the girl in question comes from - she ends up dead.<br><br>-Despatch walk the line between the two. They deal with OCs who aren&#39;t Suvian, but also can&#39;t stay in the canon and integrate. Their &#39;home&#39; is World One - but because they&#39;re fictionalised versions of their authors or other people, they have no life to go back too. They can&#39;t be killed, because they aren&#39;t Mary Sues. They can&#39;t be sent home or integrated, because they have no home to go to. They have to be dealt with by Despatch.<br><br>My guess would be that the most common fate for Despatch&#39;d OCs is to have Legal integrate them into World One. They think they&#39;re normal people, after all - so send them off to <i>be</i> normal people. Despatch may well have a role to play in that integration. And, of course, some are recruited.<br><br>As to your latter question... here&#39;s a fistful of facts for you:<br><br>-The Department of Implausible Crossovers does not require an OC to be present.<br>-The Department of Implausible Crossovers deals with <i>implausible</i> crossovers. If it is a plausible crossover, it&#39;s not implausible.<br>-The PPC deals with badfic. I have no idea why you&#39;re asking about &#39;plausible crossovers where the characters remain in-character&#39; - that&#39;s not a badfic.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I may have set zdimensia on a wrong track with my beta reading in PoorCynics workshop and subsequent comments. Let me see if I get this right now:<br><br>When the Sues are slain, the Wraiths are exorcised, and the misplaced canon characters are sent back to their home continua, the badfic’s purpose does no longer exist and it is &quot;destroyed&quot; (it vanishes from the alternate multiverse where the PPC exists, we don’t actually burn books), and the word worlds which had been affected by the badfic resume their canonical shapes. OC’s who were assumed to live in these word worlds can just be left there and integrate. <br><br>But if the badfic’s purpose was snatching canon characters into the badfic’s version of &quot;real life&quot;, and the badfic crumbles away because the canon characters were returned to their home continua, characters who are assumed to live in the badfic’s version of “real life” have no place where they can stay. If we do not want to recruit them, but also do not want to let them die when their home world vanishes, we have to despatch them to World One, the PPC’s version of &quot;real life&quot;. Also, sending trans-dimensional hoppers back to their assumed home – the badfic’s version of &quot;real life&quot; – wouldn’t actually remove them; to &quot;destroy&quot; the badfic, the trans-dimensional hoppers must be despatched to World One.<br><br>I still don’t understand Legal’s role in this. Does Legal fake all the documents which are necessary to legalize a person’s existence in real life (intentional pun)?<br><br>Considering that Real Person Fic is creepy and we shouldn’t rewrite the real author’s life in our World One, this may intentionally be left mysterious, and this is the reason why you made Legal such a mysterious department? Should we assume that the agents shove self inserts and attached charge lists through a portal to Legal, but never go there themselves and don’t actually know any agents in Legal?<br><br>What happens if self inserts representing the same real life author exist in multiple stories? I assume that the author’s representation is abducted from World One into the next story and Despatch has to get them back (and Legal may need to fake a cover- up story, like travel tickets and holiday postcards, to explain their temporary absence in World One).<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I think the purpose of Legal was if they needed to be charged with kidnapping in their home fic.  I could drop getting Legal involved, (say it was something that happened in the past,) and just have a non-action part of Despatch, especially if the snatcher&#39;s world crumbles so they can&#39;t go back.<br><br>I&#39;d actually like to create someplace that&#39;s not World One for them to live.  In definition, it would be a penal colony, in practicality, it would be nicer than some real communities.  Having &quot;repeat offenders&quot; seems like picking on the same author intentionally, but a world specifically set up to contain them would probably not need an elaborate cover story.  It may also solve the problem of hoppers that turn into elves or whatever.  (I&#39;m assuming that if PPC could turn someone into something that they&#39;re not, we wouldn&#39;t have anyone who was irritated at being what they are.)<br><br>I don&#39;t know where non-canonical communities get sent, and I can&#39;t remember which spinoff had to specifically move them, but that spare world could also contain those.</p>

            <p>Although there is only one true Despatch mission and I still think that the wiki page on Despatch is badly worded and the wiki page on Legal lacks information on its connection to Despatch, it appears now that these departments purposes have been discussed and planned out before we joined, and in the PPC’s weird ways it all makes sense.

            <p>I&#39;m more thinking about tweaks.  I&#39;m under the impression that the PPC has evolved a bit since then, with the change of accusing the story or the Sue with the charges instead of the author.  I&#39;d like the wiki page to at least be cleaned up so I&#39;m not working with outdated and unclear stuff.  Is anyone still around that remembers what the discussions were?  I would like some wording on how non-Sue self-inserts are not to be harmed.  I think there is something like that on the self-insert page.    <br><br>I suppose I could work back to no one knows what happens to them after they are taken in.  (The only one that it really interferes with is something weird that may or may not fly anyway.)  There really isn&#39;t much difference between OCs and SIs from a practical standpoint, is there.  (I&#39;m getting a little hung up on recruiting OCs that look like SIs, but it could just be a case of it never goes through.)</p>

            <p>In the case of snatchings, I would say that their &quot;real&quot; world exists enough for them to get sent back to it.  With hoppers, it may vary.  And for sending hoppers to World One, how many people can it tolerate being added from nowhere, or are there enough agents from there that never go back to balance?<br><br>It has been a while since I&#39;ve watched &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; but the world that the kid is from is a flanderization of the real world, while the action movie is the same for action movie worlds.  The kid&#39;s world isn&#39;t &quot;real&quot; but he goes back to it and lives.<br><br>I can&#39;t exactly write this part of story without talking to the author.  But for Going Out West, I imagine that once the canon is returned to normal, Camren could choose to have her memories altered and become Kid Cooper&#39;s wife in a way that doesn&#39;t damage canonical events.<br><br>For Yiffing is Magic, the only real charge is that he caused a background pony to... I don&#39;t have the euphemisms to describe it.  He would have died if the agents hadn&#39;t intervened.  (Again I&#39;m questioning if that one is missionable, even if the FIMfic community hates it.  Not going to rewrite until I get someone who can look at it.)  I&#39;m thinking his &quot;talking to&quot; would involve asking him if he knows about the sites where original fiction of that type is actually welcomed.<br><br>I intend to do Razzy Plush someday.  In that, the SI-snatcher has a family.<br><br>For my purposes, the DIC handles them if they are from a world where the media exists as a story.  It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a real universe that actually inspired the show.  It doesn&#39;t matter if they haven&#39;t actually seen the show.<br><br>My questions about the DIC... I suppose in that case, there would be something else about the fic to make it bad, and it would be another department that might call a DIC agent to help with the fiddly bits.  I was wondering if the canon gets damaged just by crossing universes.  (There is an official Mork and Mindy/ Happy Days crossover, so I guess not.)  <br><br>I suppose having Robin Williams exist in Mork and Mindy might argue against real world people destabilizing things just because they intrude on fiction.  Intel does have a story where the intruder from beyond the fourth wall might be allowed to stay.<br></p>

            <p>For Intel, like Agent Archetheutis <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/architeuthis/mission03.html">exploring &quot;Time Will Tell&quot;</a>, it is part of the job. The point here is that judging a story based on stereotypical interpretations of its summary is a mistake, and thus a badfic’s author’s warning that we just shouldn’t read the story if we don’t like the stereotype doesn’t really help. Not every girl fallen into (insert canon here) is a Mary Sue, although <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/450376/1/Time-Will-Tell">&quot;Time Will Tell&quot;</a> went a bit down when Architheuthis had left somewhere after chapter seven of what were forty three chapters in the end.<br><br>Such a mistake was made when Miah and Caddy-shack started to write the <a href="http://miah-arthur.livejournal.com/20408.html">mission in <i>Stargate Atlantis</i></a>  you mentioned in a previous post, before they had read the whole story. (I don’t know the chronology, but I assume that they couldn’t read the full story, because it was still a work in progress.) When they realized that MPreg is not always badly written, but the mission helped to develop their characters’ relationship, they decided to acknowledge the mistake and go with it, making agents Cadmar and Cali realize that Intel had not explored this thoroughly. <br><br>A similar mistake <a href="http://www.keldale.f9.co.uk/tabularasa/mission3.htm">was justified in-mission</a>, saying that the only Intel agent who could have explored a potential <i>Redwall</i> Revenge!Sue was incapacitated, so that <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1965410/1/">&quot;Vengeance Quest&quot;</a>was directly given to agents Foxglove and Laburnum (DMS). When the story progressed and Laburnum realized that there would never be a reason to kill the protagonist, she told the author about the PPC and got her permission to turn the Sue hunt into a rescue and recruiting mission which doesn’t damage the story, because the goodfic’s characters are not aware that <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Stormsong">Stormsong</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Skyfire%20">Skyfire</a> escaped certain death and are now PPC agents. <br><br>But these are really rare cases.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Actually we were fully aware it was goodfic when we started writing it. We were poking fun at ourselves for assuming based on the summary that it was a badfic. In this case the Intelligence Agents that did a shoddy job were us (primarily me, since I found the story). We clicked on it fully expecting to find the next badfic target, and reacted sort of like the characters. Hey, wait! This is actually good! <br><br>Then decided to write the mission just to highlight that even a fic that is a post-canon AU Mpreg can be a most excellent fic.

I suspect that, because  <i>Sailor Moon</i> mostly or at least partly takes place in Tokyo, the place where the Sue lives is called &quot;Tokyo&quot;, but while <i>Sailor Moon&#39;s</i> Tokyo resembles the real Tokyo, all we see of “Tokyo” is one small house, a park with a swamp in it, one street, one car, and some people in the park.  Thus, &quot;Tokyo&quot; probably looks more like a small town than a big city, and when the badfic&#39;s reality falls apart, the canonical Tokyo (from  <i>Sailor Moon</i>, not from Real Life)  reoccupies its position.<br><br>As far as the mission report exists, it just shows a Sue in an implausible crossover. She somehow snatched Boromir from <i>LotR</i> into <i>Sailor Moon</i>, but Despatch only covers trans-dimensional snatching into the real world. She may or may not be a trans-dimensional hopper from the real world, but she is also a Sue and the plan is to have her killed by assassins who shall be called in later. Thus, she doesn&#39;t need to be despatched to World One, and taking Boromir back to <i>LotR</i> is covered by Shelley and Nia from DIC. <br><br>I don&#39;t see any reason to involve Despatch here, other than: Meg Thornton and her co-writer had decided to have their agents in Despatch, and then just went with it.   <br><br>HG</p>

This Sucks is an obvious parody but it will be awesome to do.  The Pygmalion Syndrome is a goodfic assigned by accident and the mission will support that by asking if we charge for witchcraft.

If they&#39;re a true insert, I&#39;d go kid-gloves and a discussion about their writing.  If they&#39;re an OC, put them back in their homes or adjust them so that they fit into their new universe.  Obviously the only time I could know for sure if they are SI or OC is by asking the authors, but I have two badfics that I own that show both sides.<br><br>There is one story I read where an agent gets her own self-insert story and tries to kill her.  It&#39;s a Harry Potter fic about swimming or a boathouse.<br><br>There is a Jay and Acacia story where the snatchers get eaten by Old Man Willow.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been starting work on a new mission and have come across some translations that don&#39;t look quite right. I&#39;ve put the majority of them through Google Translate and they mainly come out OK, but as everyone knows Google Translate is hardly an accurate source for translations. They&#39;re all in French and I was hoping that someone here would have a better grasp of the language than I do. <br>The quotes are:<br>Que continue ici?<br>Nous ne connaissons pas monsieur. Les йcrans sont allйs blanc et nous ne pouvons pas trouver une source а elle<br>Pas encore monsieur. Celui qui a fait ceci est au delа de notre monsieur de technologie <br><br>the translations in the badfic are given as:<br>What is going on here?<br>We don&#39;t know sir. The screens went blank and we can&#39;t find a source to it.<br>Not yet sir. Whoever did this is beyond our technology sir.<br><br>The errors I&#39;ve noted:<br>In the second one, the french uses &#39;white&#39; instead of &#39;blank&#39; (is this because there isn&#39;t a word for &#39;blank&#39; in french or not?)<br>the last part of the third one reads &#39;Whoever did this is beyond our Mister Technology.&#39;<br><br>If anyone could help me it&#39;d be appreciated. <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>Name: Fawkes of Silver<br>Species: Skarmory (a.k.a. Airmd, Armor Bird Pokйmon, or simply Armorbird)<br>Home Continuum: Pokйmon<br>Age: Roughly corresponds to 21 in human years.<br>Lust Object/s: Too many to count, but most notably Pit from Kid Icarus and Sora from Kingdom Hearts.<br><br>Appearance: Fawkes, like most Skarmory, is a silver-gray steel crane (not the construction implement, but the bird). He has a long neck with metallic blue plating, long legs with blue three-toed feet, and a triangular crest on his head like a cassowary. The razor-sharp, hollow feathers on his wings have scarlet undersides, and his eyes are yellow with blue irises. One distinct feature is that Fawkes&#39; armor is far more lustrous than most Skarmory, bearing greater similarity to polished silver than iron or steel.<br>Fawkes has to disguise himself as a human on most of his missions. In his human form, he is 5&#39;8&quot;, 128 lbs, and of Asian (Indonesian) ethnicity. His skin is light tan with a yellow undertone, his eyes are dark brown and often require glasses to fix his vision (a necessary compromise for his sharper avian sight), and depending on the context his side-parted curtained hair is either the same metallic blue as his neck armor or otherwise black, though always with sharp specular gloss like polished metal. He&#39;s quite slim and lanky for his size, though if superpowers are acceptable, he will often have rather muscular arms with metallic bladed feathers (colored like Skarmory&#39;s wings) attached in the same manner as the flight feathers of a bird.<br><br>Powers: Fawkes&#39; known moves are Spikes (he wasn&#39;t bred with Stealth Rock, alas), Whirlwind, Roost, and Brave Bird.<br>Like other Skarmory, Fawkes is covered in hard, metallic armor, allowing him to take a lot of damage in close combat. It&#39;s really hard to take him down when he steps forward or swoops in to defend an ally. His ability is Sturdy, which makes it impossible to take him out in a single blow, no matter how strong, though a powerful-enough first strike can weaken him to the point that he can still be two-hit-KO&#39;d. Thankfully, his Roost move allows him to recover damage by regenerating his armor, though he has to land to draw the required metal ions from the soil through the undersides of his taloned feet. He is also vulnerable to energy-based attacks and is especially afraid of extreme heat, since metal armor, being more thermally conductive than skin, will not only melt in the presence of fire, but also trap and cook his insides in the process.<br>The bird can also heal through eating, which is a standard power for most video-game characters, and is as omnivorous as any human and most types of Pokйmon with a tremendous appetite. His held item is Leftovers, which manifests as the fact that whenever he feels hungry or needs to heal, he ALWAYS manages to pull snacks out of his mission kit. Don&#39;t ask how he does it. Even Fawkes himself doesn&#39;t know the answer.<br>Offensively, his razor-sharp feathers, beak, and claws can slice through all but the toughest hide. He also hides sharp feathers beneath his wing sheathes (corresponding to the secondary feathers on a realistic bird wing), which he can fling like darts at opponents - per the Inverse Law of Sharpness and Accuracy, he almost always misses his target, but getting them to step on the Spikes scattered about is a whole different story.<br>Fawkes is also an excellent flyer, and can reach speeds of up to 180 mph outside of battle (though he has to fly a lot more slowly in a combat situation, since high-speed flight impairs his coordination). His agility in the air allows him to avoid most scene hazards, bypass ground-based obstacles, and dodge enemy fire, as well as attack opponents from above. Fawkes can also use his powerful wings to whip up Whirlwinds that can blow away all but the heaviest enemies, useful for crowd control especially if paired with Spikes. His strongest move, Brave Bird, causes his armor to glow blue with stored energy as he dives from the heavens like a bird of prey and slams into the opponent like a guided missile, slicing up foes with every sharp edge on his body.<br><br>History: Fawkes first appeared in the Pokйmon universe in the late 2000&#39;s, being hatched as a Skarmy (a fan-created pre-evolved form for Skarmory itself), and spending his time learning to fly and battle like other members of his kind usually do. He was never involved in any major events, undertakings, or epic storylines, though he did encounter a number of trainers during his time without being captured. He arrived in the PPC in mid-2014, when a retrospective review of his life led him to realize that Skarmory doesn&#39;t actually evolve to or from any other Pokйmon as of yet in the official canon, upon which he realized that he was a fan-created self-insert. The resultant &quot;puff of logic&quot; led to the creation of a Plot Hole right in his flight path. The bird flew straight into it, ended up in the HQ, and was promptly taken down by a very displeased Sphinx. She reluctantly took him to the infirmiary for recovery and later took him under her wing - a decision which Rose has regretted since then.<br><br>Personality: The first thing one needs to know about Fawkes is that his nature is Impish. This armored bird is enthusiastic and fun-loving, but is noted for by his lack of initiative and penchant for mischief, since he has always lived alone and has never really learned responsibility for others. Most of the time during missions, he opts to hang back and make comments he thinks are witty, funny, or otherwise light-hearted. This earns him the ire of Rose who tends to regard him as a rare annoyance and she would probably be all too happy to beat him senseless if he weren&#39;t protected by razor-edged metal armor. However, he still considers her a friend and a mentor to some extent, and the reason she hasn&#39;t kicked him out of their RC is that he has been known to prove himself should the need arise. One thing Fawkes has going for him is his determination to see a job done, and even on occasions where he has literally Pignite-backed upon his partner the whole time, he can be counted upon to know what to do at a critical moment. And if he feels that a matter has touched him personally - if his partner is threatened/hurt, or if his or someone else&#39;s behavior has led to misfortune for either partner - he will go out of his way to do the right thing, be it backpedal after a poor decision or take responsibility should Rose give up hope. While reluctant to pull his own weight or look out for others, his boundless optimism and ability to shake off angst more easily than most can be valuable traits to have in the right situation.<br>Interestingly, being a self-insert character, Fawkes channels all the traits of his creator, including the weirder ones. In particular, he is rather lascivious for an avian creature, and though such is to a lesser extent than some other agents, having an steel-encrusted crane ogling below your waistline is not exactly a pleasant experience for most people. After all, sexual arousal from human feet and tickling would be a lot more bizzare (and disturbing to some) in the case of an armored bird as opposed to a human. Despite being highly unlikely to mount anything that moves (especially considering the obvious risk of slicing hypothetical lust objects to ribbons), if Fawkes is in a story with an appealing character, and in a form that doesn&#39;t maim things with just a touch, he WILL exploit the opportunity for all it&#39;s worth. He has a slightly broader spread of paraphilias than most characters, and isn&#39;t one to complain about such things in general, save for the obvious exceptions of inflation, scat, vore, and guro. Those are just wrong, man.<br><br>Department: Department of Implausible Crossovers<br><br>----------<br><br>And here&#39;s my obligatory persona! Hopefully a non-human self-insert isn&#39;t too far out there.<br><br>Fawkes was originally created as a persona for my first account on deviantART, and was originally a shiny Skarmory. Since I never got to use him for anything significant (he&#39;s only got like two to three old pics to his name on my dA gallery), I decided to dust him off, repaint him, and use him at the PPC.<br><br>Again, feedback is welcome~! :)</p>

            <p>Right. Fawkes. First off, let&#39;s look at that name.<br><br>&#39;Fawkes&#39; is, obviously, the phoenix from <i>Harry Potter</i>. It&#39;s also the name of a former PPC Boarder, and is a canonical nickname for her agent, Chelsea &#39;Fawkes&#39; Miller. Since I&#39;ve adopted the character, I&#39;m rather protective of her identity; that said, agents with identical names aren&#39;t exactly forbidden.<br><br>On the other hand, how did he come down with the name &#39;Fawkes&#39;? That&#39;s a fandom name, and your backstory for him says he was never captured - ie, you can&#39;t even postulate a HP-fanatic trainer giving him the name (if HP even exists in Pokemon, which I&#39;ve never seen any hint of). He was intercepted by Rasheeda, who also presumably has no fandom links... and anyone else in HQ would probably name him anything other than a canon character&#39;s name, since they&#39;re, uh, PPCers.<br><br>So... where did his name come from? My impression has always been that Pokemon don&#39;t have personal names unless they&#39;re captured and nicknamed. Even then, characters like Pikachu and Meowth stick with their species names, quite happily. I can certainly see him taking or being given a name in HQ - but I can&#39;t really see it being a <i>Harry Potter</i> reference. If he was mostly associating with Rasheeda at that time, which you seem to suggest, he might even have an Arabic or Egyptian name.<br><br>And... where does &#39;of Silver&#39; come from? That seems to be just a random addition. The &#39;of&#39; formation suggests &#39;Silver&#39; is a person or a place... did he live at Mount Silver in Johto? But Skarmory don&#39;t seem to be native to Mt. Silver...<br><br>Anyway, enough on the name. Moving on to appearance. Again, the description is fairly clear; I have no problem with the idea that his feathers are shinier than other Skarmorys&#39; - Pokemon can vary in appearance just like anything else.<br><br>His human form, though... like I said with Rasheeda, a disguise is meant to <i>disguise</i>. He can look Indonesian - if he&#39;s in a canon where Indonesian-appearing humans are around. He can have metallic hair - if he&#39;s in a canon where metallic hair exists. I&#39;m having a very hard time imagining a situation where he could have sword-wings and still consider it a disguise.<br><br>Remember, disguises have nothing to do with the person involved - in theory, they can turn anyone into anything. Human agents will often just disguise their clothes, or otherwise make minimal changes - but there&#39;s no reason for Fawkes to limit himself so. It&#39;s not like he has a native human form!<br><br>Linked to this, but something you haven&#39;t explicitly mention: speech. As far as I&#39;m aware, almost all Pokemon have single-word vocabularies. They can vary their intonation and &#39;sentences&#39;, but they&#39;re limited to, well, their own name.<br><br>And I think that would be <i>really cool</i> to read. Think about it! Your character is a bird made out of swords, who is prone to making witty comments - only he makes them in the form of &#39;Skar? Skarmor, <i>mor</i>y.&#39; And Rasheeda tried to translate the sense, while being utterly unable to understand the words.<br><br>Obviously, when in disguise, he can speak English - which could be a continuation of the storyline. Picture Rasheeda getting more and more irritated by what she can tell are snide remarks in Skarmory-speak until, the instant they step through the portal, she whirls around and pins him against the wall, forearm to his now-human neck. &quot;You are going to tell me exactly what you were saying back there,&quot; she growls, &quot;and you are going to do it <i>right now</i>.&quot;<br><br>Moving on to what you actually wrote about... powers. The moveset looks fine, though I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;ve gone for Whirlwind rather than something more Skarmory-y like Steel Wing. I like the description of Roost drawing up metal ions - is that a canon explanation, or your own? It does invite the question of what he&#39;d do in a low-metal environment. It also makes me wonder if he can &#39;upgrade&#39; his armour by, say, sitting on top of a titanium deposit... maybe that explains his shiny wings? If he lived somewhere with a high silver level, he could have absorbed it and ended up recoloured. I can see him getting a bit vain about that, and going hunting for silver every time an emergency Roost puts his feathers off-colour...<br><br>The rest of the &#39;powers&#39; description looks pretty good, too. Essentially, a realistic(ish) description of a Skarmory in battle. I like the Leftovers - that&#39;s a very PPCvian touch.<br><br>That said, remember disguises: unless he&#39;s actually in Pokemon universe, he probably won&#39;t <i>be</i> a Skarmory. Which is a shame, but that&#39;s how it works. So except for the Leftovers, the rest of this is fairly limited in scope.<br><br>History: looks good to me. I like the &#39;explanation&#39; for the plothole he fell through, and the fact that he really is pretty much a background character. Also, I&#39;m picturing a Skarmy now and it. is. adorable.<br><br>Slight glitch - you say &#39;took him to the infirmary&#39;. That&#39;s the Medical Department; it has a name. You also say &#39;took him under her wing&#39; (ha ha, reverse pun), and later &#39;the reason she hasn&#39;t kicked him out of their RC&#39;... are you implying that he hasn&#39;t actually been recruited and assigned as an agent? Because I don&#39;t think the Marquis de Sod or the Lichen would be too pleased by that...<br><br>Personality: I really like the tying of his personality to his Nature. Good call. It seems to mostly work, too, and I agree with Rasheeda - if it weren&#39;t for that confounded armour, I&#39;d probably hit him, too. But overall, I think he could make an interesting character in a high-conflict partnership with Rasheeda.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the &#39;lascivious&#39; aspect. Um. Let&#39;s make a little list:<br><br>-You describe him ogling what you imply to be almost everyone, including two Lust Objects who I&#39;m pretty sure are underage. That&#39;s kind of skeevy.<br>-You suggest that... okay, you suggest <i>something</i> about what he&#39;ll do in a human disguise, and honestly, I&#39;m having a hard time not reading it as &#39;he is prone to raping canon characters&#39;. Since I... really hope that&#39;s not what you&#39;re going for, care to clarify?<br>-You list four &#39;obvious&#39; exceptions to your final sentence, with the remark &#39;Those are just wrong, man&#39;. I don&#39;t know or want to know what the terms in question mean, but describing something as &#39;just wrong&#39; when what you mean is &#39;I don&#39;t like it&#39; is usually a bad idea, and prone to offending people who disagree with you. I&#39;m about halfway sure the &#39;just wrong&#39; remark was in Fawkes&#39; voice, which is a different matter (since characters aren&#39;t aware that they&#39;re being publically watched, they express their opinions differently to real people), but not all the way certain, so just... be careful.<br><br>Okay, I didn&#39;t say as much about &#39;Fawkes&#39; (still vaguely hoping you&#39;ll change the name, here) as I did about Rasheeda - but I think he&#39;s a really interesting concept. And I think the combination of hair-trigger psionic weapon with carefree living sword-tank could be a fascinating high-conflict partnership to read about.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Dangit, I was gonna reply this morning but I was way too busy... *grumbles about how time-consuming research is*<br><br>Re: Nomenclature - Fawkes&#39; original name was, again, based on my first deviantART account, which was in turn partly named after Fawkes from HP who was in turn named for the real-world figure of Guy Fawkes (the way the phoenix burns up may be a reference to the Gunpowder Plot). You do raise a good point about the fact that there was no way he would&#39;ve been able to acquire that name while keeping his current backstory consistent. That and I&#39;ve had a long, sad history of accidentally plagiarizing from other people on the Internet, so I might as well do what &#39;Fawkes&#39; would do and just give him a new name. I actually have one in mind that could work - &#39;Falchion.&#39; It&#39;s a type of single-edged sword of European origin, and it also sounds like &#39;falcon&#39; which corresponds to his being an avian predator. It even sounds similar to the original name, so I won&#39;t have as hard a time adjusting to the new one as I have when renaming other characters I&#39;ve created. And I&#39;m probably going to get rid of the &#39;Of Silver&#39; as well, as Skarmory are only found on Johto Route 45.<br><br>Re: Appearance - Everything I said with regard to Rasheeda/Rose&#39;s (I&#39;ll just call her Rose, as Rosetta is the Anglicized version) appearance and disguises applies to Falchion as well. I - well, *HE* will stay a Skarmory, with all of the implications it entails (e.g. see below).<br><br>Re: Speech - I actually thought of Falchion as being able to speak English the way Meowth does, but now that I think of it I can&#39;t imagine why a solitary armored bird would ever think of acquiring that talent unless it&#39;s a contrived action on the author&#39;s part. Pokйmon speak would make for a lot more interesting story elements, but communication will still be important if, for example, the two receive a mission and Falchion knows more than Rose does, or if Falchion has to communicate with another agent without Rose interpreting it for him.<br>Following up on this Mamoswine in the room, I actually came up with an idea that could work: Falchion cannot speak English when Rose meets him for the first time, but once she finds out how powerful he is, she convinces him to become her new partner and gets Makes-Things or some other PPC tech expert to make him a translation collar, like the one worn by Dug from Up (or the Monkey Thought Translator from the Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs movie). That way, he could &#39;speak&#39; in English through the translator but, if he wants to make a REALLY questionable comment, he simply pulls on the collar so the translator isn&#39;t contacting him (which I assume is how it works, with the collar being elastic), and says the remark before snapping the translator back on.<br>To this end, I actually think the exchange where Rose gets fed up with Falchion would probably involve Falchion putting the translator in his bag while disguised (because he wouldn&#39;t need it) and accidentally losing the bag at some point during the mission. Considering that they&#39;d probably be trying to get out of a tight spot, it won&#39;t be surprising that neither of them will realize that oversight until they come back to the RC. Falchion panics and tries to Buizel his way out of trouble (in Pokйmon speak, of course), and THEN once Rose fails to understand him too many times, she pounces on him, they tumble back through the portal, and she pins down the now-human Falchion and demands an explanation. And THEN he reveals he lost the bag... D:<br><br>Re: Abilities - The moveset is actually based on one of Smogon&#39;s suggested sets for competitive battling, which emphasizes Skarmory&#39;s ability to gradually stall teams while tanking damage and using Roost for recovery. Steel Wing, while good for Same-Type Attack Bonuses and Defense increases and whatnot, is not as reliable as, say, Brave Bird because Steel is generally a poor offensive type, the increasing prominence of GODDAMN FAIRIES notwithstanding of course. The explanation for his Roost move is my own personal headcanon for how Skarmory pull it off, since I feel that it&#39;s their armor that takes the most damage in combat and they&#39;d have to patch it up somehow. To his credit, he also has an alternative healing technique thanks to Leftovers, in which he simply lands and nabs a quick snack while Rose complains at him in the background to PUT THAT FOOD AWAY AND GET YOUR SHINY METAL ASS BACK IN THE AIR OR SO HELP ME. The suggestion you made about the hunting for silver to cure off-color feathers also makes a lot of sense with respect to the Roost details, and I can actually imagine him keeping a &#39;hoard&#39; of trinkets he collects during missions in his nest back at their RC and squatting over it like a brooding chicken when not on duty (It also helps that I&#39;m actually quite squeamish about getting dirty myself XD).<br><br>Re: History - Concerning Skarmy, here&#39;s the full Pokйdex entry I did for the little guy. Lookin&#39; sharp, aren&#39;t you pal?<br><a href="http://pokemondayandnight.tumblr.com/post/88534574203/skarmy-sky-armor-army-steel-flying-sharp"><a href="http://pokemondayandnight.tumblr.com/post/88534574203/skarmy-sky-armor-army-steel-flying-sharp">http://pokemondayandnight.tumblr.com/post/88534574203/skarmy-sky-armor-army-steel-flying-sharp</a></a><br>And a bonus Mega Skarmory for the funsies:<br><a href="http://pokemondayandnight.tumblr.com/post/88716203183/mega-skarmory-sky-armor-armory-steel-dragon"><a href="http://pokemondayandnight.tumblr.com/post/88716203183/mega-skarmory-sky-armor-armory-steel-dragon">http://pokemondayandnight.tumblr.com/post/88716203183/mega-skarmory-sky-armor-armory-steel-dragon</a></a><br>Nice to see the History lacks any serious faults, though I&#39;ll correct the &#39;Infirmiary&#39;/&#39;Medical Department&#39; blooper and find a different way to state that Rose hasn&#39;t gotten fed up with him yet.<br><br>Re: Personality - The Nature is one of the suggested ones from Smogon, which increases Defense while decreasing Special Attack (which Skarmory is already terrible at, anyway). Really handy for one of the premiere physical wallers in the metagame.<br>As for the lusty bit... yeah, I think that was the weakest part of his bio as well. It was supposed to tie in to my own fetishes (being my persona and all) and I obssess after Pit and Sora for fanservice catering to those specific interests. I mean, have you seen how big Pit&#39;s feet are relative to his body? Or Sora&#39;s, for that matter? Bet they&#39;re incredibly soft and insanely ticklish too ;)! Anyway, yeah, I think this specific part is the only one that warrants a total rewrite to make him sound more like a flirt rather than an outright sex predator (which would probably be quite a chore, all things considered). I&#39;d probably say that he likes making... suggestive comments to any canons he finds appealing before neuralyzing them. Not to mention putting the two characters I just mentioned under Lust Objects makes him sound like a freaking PEDOPHILE, oh my Arceus. I&#39;ll probably replace them with Falkner from HeartGold/SoulSilver, as well as the adult versions of Link from the Legend of Zelda and possibly Zuko from Avatar: The Last Airbender too. And maybe Ashton Kutcher if real-world crushes are allowable XD.<br><br>Whew, talk about tl;dr, I love Falchion&#39;s character to bits and I think he&#39;ll be fun to write! I certainly hope I&#39;ll be able to write him WELL, and the conflict with Rasheeda/Rosetta would definitely help. Anyway, nearly half-past midnight so I might as well call it, and probably fix up the bios later this weekend. Cheers! :)<br><br>Best regards,<br>SS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll cut the &quot;lascivious&quot; part entirely, then. I just realized that his being my PPC self-insert would not work well with my own personality, as I happen to be rather courteous myself in a public setting (read: I don&#39;t make lewd remarks to anyone). I was taught not to by my family, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised that Rose would teach him not to.<br><br>His fetish-related interests will remain, but they&#39;ll be relatively minor and won&#39;t directly impact missions or anything; I plan for them to be just minor quirks that will make dialogue a bit more interesting. Maybe for example, he&#39;d bring up the subject and wonder what Rose would think, and she&#39;d reply: &quot;I respect that you have that particular interest. Please respect that I do not.&quot;</p>

            <p>The translator could be attached to a collar so that he&#39;d still have his beak and talons free. And I&#39;m pretty sure Makes-Things or one of the other DoSAT folks could make something sufficiently advanced that Falchion can mentally switch it off when making remarks of a certain nature.<br><br>He&#39;d probably take it off while disguised. A number of Pokйmon can also repeat human speech in the games (Chatot being a prominent example), and all Pokйmon can understand it in the anime.

            <p>Name: Rosetta Bin Giza<br>Species: Sphinx (Mystic)<br>Home Continuum: An AU version of Earth created by the author for a story in progress.<br>Age: 35 (biologically), ~2400 (chronologically)<br>Lust Object/s: N/A<br>Appearance: Rose is an Androsphinx, a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion (Panthera leo). Her ethnicity is African in origin (being related to the Theban Sphinx, one of the most famous Mystics from this race), but she is albino - a notable aesthetic trait, but biologically possible in this continuity, and therefore not unique enough to be considered speshul (albino Sphinxes are similar to Spirit Bears, 1 in every 10 being white, for the population Rose is descended from). Nonetheless, her straight white hair, pale skin, and reddish pink catlike eyes do attract odd looks. Her ears are furry and feline-like, not humanoid, with tufts like a lynx or bobcat, and her teeth have fangs like a lion&#39;s. The jewelry adorning her body is typical of Sphinx mystics, with bangles, headress/crown, and an Egyptian necklace decorated with gold and rose-cut diamonds, but it isn&#39;t magical. Everyone knows that won&#39;t end well. Her Sphinx form has a lioness body with pure white fur, being albino and all, but she also has the wings of an eagle, feathers running down her back and, for flight control, a feathery tail like a dromaeosaurid dinosaur, with an ankh-shaped tail fan at the tip.<br>Like other Sphinxes, Rose can turn into a humanoid form, which is similar to the Kemonomimi of Japanese pop culture. Only in her case she insists that she isn&#39;t a &quot;cat-girl&quot; but a &quot;lioness-woman&quot;. Or simply a &quot;Sphinx&quot; if you don&#39;t want to be pedantic. She retains her white hair and pink eyes, but her whole body is human with the exception of her cat ears, sharp claws, and the feathered dinosaur tail of her Sphinx form. She used to have an Egyptian priestess outfit, not unlike stock depictions of Cleopatra except white and rose-colored rather than blue and gold, but now she wears a black outfit like other agents of the PPC, not unlike Black Widow from the first Avengers movie, save for the cleavage being completely covered for moral reasons. She&#39;s not particularly proud of her work uniform.<br>Powers: As expected from a Sphinx, Rose is a ferocious battler if pressed to act. She has razor-sharp, fully retractable claws, bony spurs on her wings, and a powerful bite. The name of her kind, Sphinx, is adapted from Greek, sphingo, meaning &quot;to strangle&quot;, which is how she usually kills prey and opponents, crushing the victim&#39;s windpipe with her jaws and suffocating them to death. She is not a brawler, however, and relies primarily on ranged, energy-based attacks to fight. As a Mystic, her Sphinx form can theoretically use a number of psychic powers, but she has only felt the need to use telekinesis and psionic projections, which can form a number of simple implements like blades, fists, and blunt-force projectiles, though no-where near as complex and strong as more dedicated psychics for reasons noted below. She can also &quot;throw&quot; crescent-shaped cutting beams of energy from her claws, as well as batter opponents mentally as well as physically by generating mystical gusts with her wings.<br>When Rose is in her humanoid form, she is much weaker physically and her mental powers therefore increase to compensate. Her passive mental abilities are levitation, enhanced senses, and the same crude mental constructs as her Sphinx form albeit on a human scale and with a timespan of up to a minute, which she has to make do with on most missions to avoid becoming too overpowered. When humanoid!Rose goes on full offensive mode, her telekinetic abilities include tornadoes of flying debris, complex implements of psychic energy (not unlike Green Lantern, but pink rather than green), and frightening visions and mental manipulation in weaker opponents. Her powers drain her energy very quickly, though, so she cannot use them for extended periods and has to rest after sweeping each battlefield, with break times ranging from several hours to at least a week. She also loses control of her powers, with more anticlimactic results than one would expect (the tornado debris abruptly stopping and dropping everything, for example) if even minor injuries or impacts are directed at her head, specifically her forehead (which is why she always wears her jeweled headgear during missions). A full-on mental onslaught is only reserved as a last resort, e.g. if a particularly destructive Sue goes on a mindless rampage.<br>In the Pokйmon continuity, Rose would be a shiny female Meowstic with the ability Infiltrator and Choice Specs (Psychic-type Sphinx Pokйmon have yet to show up in canon). Per the above information, her known moves are Calm Mind, Psychic, Shadow Ball (she&#39;d like Ominous Wind, but Meowstic can&#39;t learn it and Shadow ball is stronger), and Sucker Punch.<br>History: Rose comes from an alternate world where the monsters of most mythologies were created by magic, which is in turn part of a mega-crossover currently developed by the author. She is one of the more prominent members of the main group of mentors who assist the heroes in her story, and was slated to monitor and guide a parody of the Gary Stu archetype into developing a better-written story arc involving the legions of Christian Hell. She never liked Mary Sues/Gary Stus, as one of her earliest encounters involved having to exorcise one from a canonical character that had been mutated into a man-eating monster. This is why, upon learning that she was given immortality 2400 years prior to the current storyline, as well as the full knowledge of the lost Secret Wing of the Library of Alexandria and a magical link to one of the 21 Sacred Beasts in the lore of her story, she was secretly terrified of being referred to as an impurity herself. Knowing of her backstory but unable to accept it until she was better developed, she fled through a Plot Hole and immediately signed up for the PPC, in the hopes that she could learn more about her own character as well as Mary Sues in general before rejoining with her allies back at home. Heroes of Yonder may be the story about the growth of the protagonist Rose is tasked with protecting, but the PPC is where she develops in her own right.<br>Personality: At first glance, Rose appears stoic and completely unsympathetic, which is typical for a Mystic who has to empty her mind of all things trivial to make use of her power. Her long history of having to keep a cool head in times of crisis has led her to consider most matters as being below her effort, one of the few exceptions being the guidance of protagonists and the destruction of &quot;canonical impurities&quot; (a.k.a. Mary Sues/Gary Stus). Characters who are borderline Sues or Stus are given the benefit of the doubt if they show their worth, but anyone beyond that line is likely to be swiftly and systematically terminated. It can be said that Rose&#39;s demeanor is very business-like, preferring to get a job done as quickly and efficiently as possible. Some of her personality aspects are quite similar to Raven from the Teen Titans TV show, being anti-social, reclusive, studious, and dryly sarcastic, but she lacks any demonic influence in her history or personality, seeing it as a sign of impurity. While not as much of a &quot;neat freak&quot; as several other characters in her home continuum, she prefers being organized and coherent, being a Mystic and all, and has a relatively low tolerance for unneccessary disarray. She means well despite her &quot;wet-blanket-ness&quot; (as her partner once put it), though she expects at least some form of karmatic retribution for people who annoy her (blatant Sue/Stu material aside).<br>It&#39;s hard to push Rose to her limits, but the fact that she has the habit of bottling up her subjective emotions until they explode is made clear upon overexposure to senseless violence, debauchery, and selfish, ignorant, and heavens forbid, destructive behavior conducted by people around her. It&#39;s part of the reason why she dislikes missions because she knows that especially graphic content will turn her into a ticking time bomb in short order. The aftermath of the inevitable explosion means either the target is cowed into submission by an onslaught of infuriated screaming (often while being tossed about like a ragdoll by her telekinesis), or what&#39;s left of him or her will have to be mopped off the floor. Partners and peers typically have to endure the former; the absolute worst Mary Sues and other &quot;impurities&quot; end up on the wrong end of the latter.<br>Minor quirks related to her include being partial to milk and raw meat, her dislike of water, her fascination with ancient and/or mystical inscriptions, and the DISTURBING UNBLINKING THOUSAND-YARD-STARE OF IMMINENT DEMISE she makes when she&#39;s angry with someone.<br>Department: Department of Implausible Crossovers<br><br>----------<br><br>Tl;dr, I&#39;m working on a mega-crossover called &quot;Heroes of Yonder&quot; that I plan to research *thoroughly* and write well. Rose is an OC from that particular story, and I&#39;m dropping her off at the PPC so I can get a hold of her personality. Again, feedback is welcome~ :)</p>

            <p>Two warnings before I start. First, I&#39;m working through this in order, not drawing syntheses or anything, so it may be a bit patchwork. Second, as a Permission Giver, I tend <i>not</i> to make Permission decisions on agents I&#39;ve discussed at length - so please don&#39;t read this as &#39;this is how you can make sure you get Permission&#39;. Different PGs have different views on things. In other words: this is just me, not my hat.<br><br>So: Rasheeda bint Giza. She reminds me somewhat of the Sphinx from <a href="http://www.viruscomix.com/subnormality.html">Subnormality</a>, which is not a bad thing. ;) Your description is fairly clear, and not objectionable, but:<br><br><i>therefore not unique enough to be considered speshul</i><br><br>This represents what I think is a fundamental misunderstanding of how to create a good character. Having unusual or even unique traits does not make a character &#39;speshul&#39;; it&#39;s what you do with them that does that. Practically every fantasy protagonist ever written has something unique about them, whether they&#39;re the secret heir to a throne (hi, Garion!), can hear all dragons (nice to see you, Lessa!), or are just ridiculously lucky enough to run across a magic Ring (hey, there, Bilbo!). The fact that Rasheeda is albino means, <i>de facto</i>, it is biologically or magically possible in her continuum; you can&#39;t really argue against that, since she empirically proves it. But even if she was the first one in a thousand years, that wouldn&#39;t make her &#39;speshul&#39;.<br><br>Now, if she was an albino, and therefore was wiser than all other Sphinxes, and everyone came to her for advice (because she was albino) but the evil Carthaginians tried to kill her (because she was albino) so she used her albino-powers to albinate them into Albania...<br><br>Traits are like characters: when they slot <i>into</i> the story, and are affected by its logic, they are fine. It&#39;s when they twist the story around themselves that they become Suvian.<br><br>Hey, I quite like that. Never looked at it in quite that way before... ahem. Moving on.<br><br>Her humanoid form: I hope you don&#39;t use this too much! I assume she has it because of her own story, but honestly, it&#39;s far more interesting to have non-human agents who stay non-human.<br><br>Some aspects of your bios seem to indicate you don&#39;t know about PPC <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Disguise_Generator">disguises</a>, so a brief rundown: when on a mission, agents are disguised by magi-technological means as something that will fit into the canon. A Sphinx can be disguised as a human - or as an Ent - or as a Hooloovoo if you desperately want. They don&#39;t need to have/use &#39;humanoid forms&#39; from their own abilities - PPC tech has that covered.<br><br>And Rasheeda&#39;s humanoid form wouldn&#39;t work as a pseudo-disguise anyway. If (say) Legolas sees an albino girl with cat ears and a tail, he is <i>not</i> going to think she fits in. So even her humanoid form would need to be disguised (further).<br><br>Side note: SeaTurtle has claimed that disguises alter agents on a molecular level, negating any innate powers they might have. I&#39;m dubious about that - we&#39;ve definitely had agents retain their abilities while on missions. I&#39;d personally say that any abilities that stem from your <i>mind</i> should be unaffected - we don&#39;t give them personality transplants. But things that stem from your body are going to be inaccessible when you&#39;re, uh, in a different body.<br><br>Moving on... you make a bizarre statement that Rasheeda has her &#39;cleavage being completely covered for moral reasons&#39;. Er... she&#39;s a two-thousand-year-old Egyptian. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Musicians_and_dancers_on_fresco_at_Tomb_of_Nebamun.jpg">I don&#39;t think they had that taboo</a>. You&#39;d be right that it&#39;s fairly ubiquitous in modern Arabic culture - but I&#39;m not at all certain it existed two and a half thousand years ago.<br><br>Powers: she&#39;s terrifying. Really, she is. But you seem to change tack mid-paragraph: you start out by claiming she &#39;usually&#39; kills things by crushing their windpipes (yikes!), but then claim she relies &#39;primarily&#39; on ranged attacks. Er... which is it? Are her psionic projections weak enough that they can&#39;t actually kill anyone, necessitating her &#39;closing for the kill&#39;?<br><br>Regardless, SeaTurtle is right on <i>this</i> score - all her physical attributes will be negated by disguises, as will things like &#39;generating mystical gusts with her wings&#39; - because she won&#39;t have wings.<br><br>While mental powers are all very well, the standard rule in the PPC is that Sues - wait, why are you even talking about Sues? She&#39;s in Implausible Crossovers, right? So her job is to untangle crossed-over universes. Her powers have zero impact on that job. Huh.<br><br>Um, anyway. Sues have to be killed with weapons suited to the canon. In Middle-earth, you use bows or swords. In Star Wars, you use blasters or lightsabers. Where would you use incredible psychic powers? Quite a few places, probably - but mostly, not.<br><br><i>the same crude mental constructs as her Sphinx form albeit on a human scale and with a timespan of up to a minute, which she has to make do with on most missions to avoid becoming too overpowered. </i><br><br>I have no idea what you mean by this. There&#39;s something about her powers that would injure her in some way if she overused them? Or are you just saying, &#39;if she uses them too much, she&#39;ll be an overpowered character&#39;? Because that&#39;s... well, pretty much the worst way of dealing with it. If you think she&#39;s overpowered, either tone her down, impose actual rules on her (many ex-Sues are forbidden from using their powers on missions), or create genuine limits. Don&#39;t just... say she &#39;has to make do&#39;.<br><br>(Also, the humanoid form thing goes back to disguises again - if she&#39;s in <i>disguise</i>, her powers shouldn&#39;t increase to compensate - they should stay the same as in her &#39;natural&#39; body.)<br><br>You describe a full Pokemon &#39;form&#39; for her, but basically, that&#39;s a disguise. You can adopt a different disguise every mission - she certainly doesn&#39;t need a dedicated form. And if she was in a story where Meowstic wouldn&#39;t be found, she&#39;ll have to adopt a different one. (Plus, imagine the hilarity when she has to go in as a Growlithe - &#39;Ugh. I smell of <i>dog</i>.&#39; &quot;You <i>are</i> a-&quot; &#39;<i>Don&#39;t. Remind. Me.</i>&#39;)<br><br>History: So, she was afraid of becoming a Mary-Sue, so joined the PPC? I can see that. I guess that might be what you meant by &#39;to avoid becoming too overpowered&#39;, and the idea of a character who is ludicrously powerful, but consciously fights it... I can see that. Reminds me a bit of Harry Dresden&#39;s experiences with the Mantle of Winter - <i>it</i> wants him to turn into a hulking powerhouse of magical rage and lust, so <i>he</i> spends all his time fighting it back. (And isn&#39;t that basically what he went through with Lasciel, too...?) You could equally equate it with Boromir&#39;s desire for the Ring - he has this intense internal struggle, which we never see until it breaks through.<br><br>Personality: Yep, definitely a relative of Subnormality&#39;s Sphinx. I&#39;m not sure why you say &#39;at first glance&#39;, since it seems like &#39;stoic&#39;, at least, is absolutely her baseline personality. It&#39;s just that her Sphinxian Overpoweredness keeps trying to break through.<br><br>I&#39;m guessing the reason she&#39;s in the DIC, rather than the DMS where she would actually get to take on Sues and Stus, is that she used to get too angry in assassination missions? This would continue the character arc I&#39;m seeing in her: fear of becoming overpowered leads into fear of using her powers at all, which leads to a) absenting herself from sitations where she&#39;d feel the urge to, and b) bottling everything up until it explodes.<br><br>I do agree that throwing PPC agents around the room like ragdolls is a bad thing to have in there (not to mention that many agents are <i>very dangerous people</i> - what makes you think she&#39;d survive doing that?). If I may make a suggestion: have that be a thing that happened <i>once</i>. More specifically, I imagine her timeline going like this:<br><br>-Joins the PPC as an Assassin, hunting down Sues.<br>-Regularly gets furious, throwing objects around with TK.<br>-Has a particularly bad breakdown and throws her <i>partner</i> around, badly injuring her and sending her to Medical.<br>-Spends some time in FicPsych for anger issues. This may be a good time to talk to Jenni Robinson, who also has vast, usually-hidden powers.<br>-Requests a transfer to a calmer department, the DIC.<br>-Spends her time trying to avoid all use of her powers.<br>-This Is Where The Story Begins.<br><br>Because there&#39;s nothing wrong with being ludicrously powerful - but having to keep that in check is where the story becomes interesting. You can have a powerful secondary character - Gandalf - but a &#39;powerful&#39; protagonist needs to be limited in some way. They can be in training (Luke Skywalker), or they can be holding back - way back - like I&#39;m suggesting/think <i>you&#39;re</i> suggesting for Rasheeda.<br><br>Enough words from me; I think I&#39;ve written more about Rasheeda than you did! I&#39;ll take a look at Fawkes later (and will start with his name...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m actually okay with textwalls as long as they&#39;re constructive. They make for fun late-night reading if nothing else.<br><br>Re: Permission - I do have plans for my first mission, but given that the rules are against jumping in straight away, I might as well take my time and integrate myself into the community before working on anything substantial. Besides, I have a conference trip this August and I&#39;m so busy preparing that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to write anything until sometime this Autumn term.<br><br>Re: Speshul - Rasheeda/Rosetta/Rose was originally meant to be a secondary character the way Gandalf is to Bilbo, though I suppose I may have made it sound like she was the lead character when I posted her bio. She certainly has that in her given that she&#39;s more experienced than her current partner. Props for clearing up the &#39;speshul&#39; definition, though, I&#39;ll edit it out when I update the bio. I was worried that her being albino (which, again, is biologically possible and relatively common among her population) may have been a blatant Mary Sue tip-off, and I&#39;m glad it isn&#39;t in the context I&#39;ve given for her.<br><br>Re: Humanoid form - One agent who stood out to me in my &#39;research&#39; was Marsha, a Triceratops from the Land Before Time continuity. The fact that you guys have an agent who&#39;s also a dinosaur certainly brings forth a lot of novelty and her trying to adjust to a human disguise made for an interesting subplot in her first mission (not knowing how to use knees, anyone?). Rose had the ability to change between human and monster forms in her home continuum as a matter of convenience, since she operated solo and she had to get opposable thumbs from somewhere. But given the possibility of human disguises like what Marsha got in her first mission, I think it would make sense for Rose to remain as a Sphinx permanently until she retires (and enters the storyline of her home continuum proper).<br><br>Re: Powers - The psionic abilities are her main means of fighting, but they are meant to weaken enemies rather than kill outright, which is why I described her physical attributes as well. But you and SeaTurtle both make good points on her abilities. I think it would be interesting if, instead of needing to curb her psychic powers, she had to be trained to not to use them *at all*, save for the long-distance cutting fields and wind attacks and even then those are for the weakening purpose I mentioned. Because of this and her fear of being &#39;really freaking hax&#39;, if she&#39;s offered a disguise that makes use of any mental abilities within the canon, she&#39;d rather pick one that doesn&#39;t. She would therefore have to make do with the limited close-range skills she has, plus her intelligence and strategic talent. Which ties us to...<br><br>Re: History and Personality - Your suggestion about Rose suffering a destructive breakdown and hurting her partner, and therefore transferring to a different department - I&#39;m actually thinking of changing it to General Purposes, though that doesn&#39;t mean she and her partner won&#39;t tackle a badly done crossover or two from time to time, and the very first mission I plan for them happens to be one - actually makes so much sense that I&#39;m surprised I didn&#39;t think of it myself. I was probably going by the line of thinking I had for the continuum she comes from, in which characters unashamedly have abilities by the boatload (which, given a setting which involves Everything Trying To Kill You[TM], is nothing short of mandatory). The way I did it was by having her special powers be very taxing to her energy reserves, inspired by the notion that the brain is the most energy-expensive organ in the body. Your suggested idea has so much more potential, however, and I have to thank you for suggesting it because I&#39;m blatantly stealing it lol. Incidentally, your proposed timeline actually gives me an idea for a backstory for her, and may also help to set one up for another character from the same WIP continuum whom I may introduce down the line who will probably stay in Internal Affairs, considering that he&#39;s even more powerful than she is and has a much larger role in the story I&#39;m working on.<br><br>It&#39;s five past midnight where I&#39;m at, so I&#39;ll respond to your feedback on Agent Fawkes, or rather Agent Falchion, after I get some sleep!</p>

            <p>I assumed that mental abilities were also included in the package. If a &#39;verse specifies that species X has/doesn&#39;t have psychic abilities, then a psionic agent disguised as species X will gain or lose those abilities for the duration of the disguise.<br><br>For example, a human from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_(comics)"><i>Wake</i></a> universe is completely psi-proof: not even the most gifted psychics can read their thoughts or influence their minds. On the flip side, those humans have no psychic abilities to speak of. In <i>Doctor Who</i>, it is said at one point that humans have a latent psychic talent. Most humans in the <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> are actually transhuman: they have had parts of their brains or bodies augmented with electronics for work or military purposes. Cyberized humans can tap into the wireless Net to download information or to contact people via brain-Skype.<br><br>In these cases, the body imposes limitations on the mind. If powers stem from the mind, what point does the body end and the mind begin? <br><br><br><br>...oop! And if you don&#39;t mind, can you point me in the direction of the missions with agents retaining powers while in disguise?

She&#39;s placed in an LotR-Elven disguise at very short notice (ie, not a specially set-up version), but still manages to turn into her dragon form and eat the Sue. She does it again <a href="http://the-ppc.livejournal.com/49265.html">here</a>. She was the main example I was thinking of, but I&#39;ll also give you <a href="http://the-ppc.livejournal.com/49098.html">Meneltari</a>, who&#39;s technically disguised when she uses her Sue powers - though since she seems to be an elf normally, it may be a &#39;clothes&#39; disguise.<br><br>As to the general question of body/mind differences, consider the counter-examples: agents in Entish disguises are still able to think in straight lines. Agents in Eldarin disguises are capable of looking at the stars without going into rapture, and of thinking about sex with people they have no intention of marrying. Agents in Orcish disguises are able to go out in sunlight. Etc etc etc. Disguises aren&#39;t an Animorphs/Young Wizards scenario, where the mind of your disguise gets involved and tries to turn you fully into the creature in question; they&#39;re just a very strong, very deep physical overlay. They can <i>grant</i> mental powers - J&amp;A disguise as Istari - but I don&#39;t recall any incidences of them <i>removing</i> powers. Got any examples?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>First point: more of a post formatting thing. This bio was a bit of a wall-&#39;o-text and therefore hard to read, so don&#39;t forget to use that enter key to break it up into more manageable paragraphs. <br><br>Right, onto Rosetta herself. Considering most of the PPC&#39;s known agents are human, her species, shapeshifing abilities, and psionic powers place her among the most high-powered agents in HQ. There&#39;s nothing wrong with agents with Powers; PoorCynic had a <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=249131;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">workshop</a> on this at one point. My main concern is that, as a DIC agent, she&#39;s likely going to be operating in continua which force her to disguise herself as something other than her normal body-- sphinx or otherwise. That also means that she won&#39;t be able to use any of her powers by virtue of the Disguise Generator transforming the agent on a molecular level. <br><br>In a situation like this, it&#39;s a bit perplexing to see an agent gifted with such extraordinary physique and psionics not being able to use them at all. In that case, wouldn&#39;t a regular human do the same job just fine? Perhaps she would better be off serving in a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Internal_Affairs">security</a> <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_External_Security">department</a> where her martial talents would better serve the cause.<br><br>I&#39;m also iffy on the &quot;tosses coworkers like rag dolls&quot; part of the bio. Agents that repress anger and demonstrate it explosively usually catch the attention of FicPsych or the DIA-- whichever is needed.<br><br><br>That&#39;s all I got off the top of my head-- feel free to ask questions!</p>

            <p>It looks like you&#39;re angling for an Arabic-sounding name. There are two problems with the current one: Rosseta is a European one and &#39;bin&#39; means &#39;the son of&#39;, so if your Sphinx is female you want &#39;bint&#39; (the daughter of), instead.</p>

            <p>Hmmm, for a first name, how about Rasheeda? It means &quot;wise, mature&quot;, which suits her role. Hence, Rasheeda bint Giza.<br><br>I meant to reference the Rosetta Stone when I originally named her. Perhaps Rosetta could be a nickname for convenience instead.</p>

            <p>Didn&#39;t think such a coincidence would come up, but it&#39;s nice to see that I can still make that connection and give it a more authentic touch. Not to mention &quot;rightly guided&quot; fits her (mostly) level-headed nature. So Rasheeda &quot;Rosetta&quot; bint Giza it is.</p>

            <p>So, last night, I finally went through and counted up all the minis in the Percy Jackson badfic I mentioned a while ago. The grand total was 91 (though I might have missed one or two...), with minis from not only PJO/HoO, but also from Harry Potter, My Little Pony, X-Men, and the real world. Oh, and there were (surprisingly only) two mini-Sues and three mini-Stus.<br><br>Flavia Maya Lilith Knight is a demigod daughter of Artemis and &#39;Kornos&#39;, somehow. She&#39;s a goth and, from what the story has said, is going to become a goddess. &quot;&quot;Yes you will be teh godess of darkness an also bad Assery&quot; Said Artmeis.&quot; If that&#39;s not evidence enough... *bangs head on desk* Oh, and she&#39;s the only demigod who uses a bow, even though the fic has mentioned Apollo kids several times. And Flavia has a love pentagon between her, Nico, Percy, Luke, and an OC named Alblaster. She also has to do Heracles&#39; labors in a very, very poorly redone manner.<br><br>Artemis speaks like My Immortal Voldemort. Percy is goth and a tattoo artist who dumped Annabeth because she was a blonde prep, Jason is a wuss who thinks My Little Pony is an actual thing and not a fictional cartoon, Piper is a wimp who only cares about her looks, and Leo has the hots for the <i>Argo II</i>- sorry, &#39;Night death Arrow&#39;, and Grover killed himself and Sally Jackson molested his corpse. Chiron is seventeen years old for whatever reason, and Mr. D looks at child porn in the Big House.<br><br>Like I said, I&#39;m fairly certain the story is a troll since it reads so much like My Immortal, but that doesn&#39;t make it any less bad. So, can it join the Bleepfic list?</p>

Wishing to take to the stars, the Doctor encounters a curious human colony. Supposedly uninhabitable, somehow the colonist survived. The Doctor realizes that the dragons have saved them.<br><br>The Doctor visits Pern and it starts off really enjoyable.  There are minor details off like barefoot candidates and one of the dragons gets named Myth.  Then it suddenly goes WTF.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve just run into <a href="http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2013/10/15/did-the-ring-speak-to-gollum-on-mount-doom/">this</a>, an article about the nature of the Ring, focussing on the final confrontation of Frodo and Gollum:<br><br><i>‘Down, down!’ [Frodo] gasped, clutching his hand to his breast, so that beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the Ring. ‘Down you creeping thing, and out of my path! Your time is at an end. You cannot betray me or slay me now.’<br><br>Then suddenly, as before under the eaves of the Emyn Muil, Sam saw these two rivals with other vision. A crouching shape, scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of fire. Out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice.<br><br>‘Begone, and trouble me no more! If you touch me ever again, you shall be cast yourself into the Fire of Doom.’<br>The crouching shape backed away, terror in its blinking eyes, and yet at the same time insatiable desire.<br><br>Then the vision passed and Sam saw Frodo standing, hand on breast, his breath coming in great gasps, and Gollum at his feet, resting on his knees with his wide-splayed hands upon the ground.</i><br><br>Do you know, in all my readings of the book, I&#39;d never registered that that&#39;s <i>the Ring</i> talking. As the article points out, it&#39;s not the first time - &#39;Verily I come, I come to you&#39;, anyone?<br><br>I was also intrigued by <a href="http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2012/01/18/shhh-its-a-secret-ring/">this one</a>, which proposes that the rhyme of the Rings of Power - &#39;Three Rings for the Elven-kings&#39; etc - wasn&#39;t written until the Last Alliance was formed, and further, that the poet (whoever that was) apparently thought the Three were given to Gil-Galad (correct), Oropher of Eryn Galen, and Amdir of Lorien. (Note that the couplet in the Black Speech - &#39;One Ring to rule them all&#39; - was penned by Sauron, and spoken by him when he first donned the One, but there&#39;s no reason to think the rest of the rhyme was his, too)<br><br>Fandom is fun, in&#39;t it? Particularly when you have a body of work as information-rich as the Legendarium, where you pretty much <i>can</i> accurately deduce &#39;the truth&#39; about, well, anything.<br><br>(<a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/index.htm">Oh yeah, I have a website about that</a>. And my old offer still stands - if you have a character, place, or event, and want me to write a Deep Places about them, I&#39;ll always take a stab at it)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>She&#39;s Vetinari&#39;s daughter, gets adopted by Unseen University, falls in love with Drumknott, her mother dies in childbirth(as par the course) and there&#39;s some nonsense about speaking fluent Morporkian by the time she&#39;s a year old, and speaking it better then the wizards despite the fact that the wizards have lived in Ankh-Morpork for most of their lives. It&#39;s called Daughter of the &quot;Unseesn&quot; University and there&#39;s two Minis (what are Discworld minis, anyway?) before the story starts.<br><br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1873110/chapters/4034331"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1873110/chapters/4034331">http://archiveofourown.org/works/1873110/chapters/4034331</a></a> <br></p>

            <p><a href="http://ofudisc.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/the-mini-luggage-adoption-centre.html">As seen here</a>. They all look different, though they all fall loosely under the category of &#39;luggage&#39; (ie, they&#39;re all containers of some description, on hundreds of little legs).<br><br>From memory, Unclean University - the previous UU mini - was a stone pot (as seen <a href="http://ofudisc.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/ofudisc-chapter-5.html">here</a>), so Unseesn University will be something similar (though presumably less dirty). Mustrum Ridicully is clearly a relative of <i>Mustard</i> Ridicully, and so will be a matching suitcase - though in red, not yellow. (I really should make a picture of all the mini-Luggages... maybe tonight)<br><br>Of course, according to PPC rules, these two minis won&#39;t count as &#39;found&#39; until and unless someone goes into the story on a mission and rescues them. The Administrator will prepare a space for them.<br><br>(All mini-Luggage adoptions should go through the Adoption Centre; it&#39;s not like we&#39;re restricting them, though! Please adopt! We&#39;re drowning in homicidal handbags here!)<br><br>hS</p>
