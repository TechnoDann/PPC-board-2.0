            <p>No tricks here. I&#39;ve whipped up a PPC Loftcraft-style AU one-shot for your reading pleasure.

            <p>I loved the tone and the pacing.  It conjured images in my mind of an old New England campus under a dull leaden sky.  There is only one way that I think it could have been improved: it could have been longer.<br><br>A longer story could have meant more mystery and suspense.  You brought both of those to the table in satisfactory amounts, but I&#39;m a bit of a glutton and would have enjoyed a larger feast.<br><br>All-in-all, very well done.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>An issue that a lot of creepy stories have is pacing, and you definitely nailed that. Well done!<br>I also love the way you incorporated PPC-related terminology in a manner that was Lovecraftian, such as C&#39;l&#39;br&#39;n and Ehnobei and the other badfics. Very cool.</p>

            <p>(Sorry for the late reply... research <sup><sup>;)<br><br>I</sup></sup> don&#39;t cosplay anymore, alas, as college never gives me time for holidays (I know I spend my free time writing and drawing and stuff, but still!).

I noticed you were into Pokemon when I looked at your profile, and I happen to have an entire anthology of badfics from a particular author that I&#39;ve been meaning to tackle for quite some time!

            <p>No surprise there, seeing that we&#39;re apparently in neighboring states. And that&#39;s not counting the fact that I intend to take a teaching job in New York next year, with record snowfalls and all that winter nonsense... Arceus help me... *shudders*<br><br>The fics I plan for us to tackle take place in the anime continuum, which I happen to know pretty well (I binged quite heavily on the original series as a child). For the mission I have in mind, I plan for another split-up, with Rashida and Sarah taking care of a mission of their own; I think Rina and Randa would be pretty helpful as far as Falchion is concerned, though. And anyway, I - er, <i>he</i> could use a little help training an old acquaintance of his. I won&#39;t spoil anything publicly just yet, other than the fact that he appeared in that Incredibles mission you mentioned (Awesome, btw!).<br><br>I&#39;ve got a few other missions to take care of before then, but I&#39;ll let you know when I&#39;m ready for the one in question. I&#39;d still like to know your email address, just in case! :)</p>

            <p>Links are made like so:<br>text| (only without the |s) (On that note, if anyone knows how to get the Board to ignore html...much obliged if you&#39;d tell me, because I only know how to do that on the wiki.) Make sure that the url you&#39;re putting in has the http:// before it (ie, <a href="http://nanowrimo.org"><a href="http://nanowrimo.org">http://nanowrimo.org</a></a>; if it doesn&#39;t, you&#39;ll end up with a link that looks about like <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/www.nanowrimo.org">this</a>, which is pretty annoying. Putting the http:// gives you the <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">proper link</a>, which is what you want.<br><br>On another note, I&#39;ve just discovered that the method I described above is only necessary if you want to show linked text instead of the url itself; if you don&#39;t mind having just the url, adding the http:// in front of it seems to link it automatically, like so: <a href="http://www.tumblr.com"><a href="http://www.tumblr.com">http://www.tumblr.com</a></a><br><br>And that concludes today&#39;s lesson!

            <p>The exorcism was mostly unorthodox because I didn&#39;t feel like clubbing preteen girls with DVD cases was a good idea <sup>_~.</sup> Glad you liked it!<br><br>Glitter... hrm. Would bit parts actually have glitter in their blood? I suppose at least one counsellor is mentioned in the fic, but Kaitlyn stole her role. That means that <i>in theory</i>, they should just be the canon characters. But on the other hand, they&#39;re sitting by and letting their boss do something frankly insane, so maybe they&#39;re OOC even while off-screen...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I liked the way you handled that mission.  The mirror idea was excellent.  It was a creative and different way of handling an exorcism for characters who weren&#39;t quite . . . traditionally?  Out of character.  It was also nice to read a mission where the main problem was just faulty characterization on a fairly mundane level, rather than some big, magical, universe-ending thing.<br><br>Also, I like the scenes with Selene&#39;s hunger getting stronger.  You wrote her in a way that made me sorry and sympathetic for her, even though what she was wanting to do was, at face value, awful.  But I also appreciate that you had Agent Kaitlyn call her on it, then offer to help enact a solution.<br><br>I&#39;ve been looking real hard for a <i>Dark Tower</i> badfic to offer up.  But . . . Stephen King fans are just too high-caliber; I can never find any bad ones.  I found a cute <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9432690/1/The-Fourth-Door">little goodfic</a>, though, so have that!</p>

            <p>First off, something that I believe is slightly unorthodox, whilst walking a couple of days back I came up with an idea for a setting for a story, and I&#39;ve developed it slightly into an (unbeta&#39;d) story/thing, that after a small bit of thought I decided to post on the board and let other people, look at it (and if the want) write stories/whatever with it if they feel that way inclined. Warnings: Mentions death (in fact, death is a large part of it) and does provide an &#39;alternate&#39; look on things like the afterlife, and does mention Gods, Angels, Demons (by name). So if you think it might offend/upset you, please don&#39;t read.<br>story/thing link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiVC4OzfL4dyli42fGSDNhZymjR8AYp3GzF7yPDpaig/edit?usp=sharing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiVC4OzfL4dyli42fGSDNhZymjR8AYp3GzF7yPDpaig/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiVC4OzfL4dyli42fGSDNhZymjR8AYp3GzF7yPDpaig/edit?usp=sharing</a></a><br>Music I was listening at time I came up with idea (so you don&#39;t think i&#39;m that kind of creepy person who thinks of death all the time): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsVlfuWCRpw"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsVlfuWCRpw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsVlfuWCRpw</a></a><br>Secondly <br>WARNING: NSFW, I REPEAT N!

Set in the Mass Effect universe, this contains a Sue (and maybe more), A &#39;cute&#39; animal friend, lots of possession, OOCness and general character warping, large amounts of bad romance (most if not all of it femslash) and the literal act of sticking man bits on a female(s) *shudders again* also bad SPaG, but that&#39;s somehow relatively minor compared to everything else.<br><br>Badfic part over.<br><br>Consider the first part a present for Halloween and the second part a &#39;present&#39; for Halloween.<br><br>Storme Hawk.<br>The guy who really needs to find some brain bleach.</p>

            <p>I like your Soul Collector story, you&#39;ve got some really nice ideas for the setting in there. I particularly the image of a bunch of Collectors all trying to pick the lock to get at a guy that&#39;s sealed himself up. <br><br>Good choice of music to go with it too - I saw the document title as the youtube page was loading and instantly knew what song I&#39;d pick. <br><br>There&#39;s a few grammar issues, mostly sentences that seem to go on for far too long - the last sentence of the first paragraph is over half the length of the paragraph, and could easily be broken up into 2 or 3 sentences. He&#39;s supposed to be talking to the reader, and doubt I could talk for that long without having to stop for breath. There are a few others sentences like that too. <br><br>While not technically incorrect, there are a couple of points where it feels like you&#39;re missing emphasis. For example, &#39;You see I’m <i>a</i> Soul Collector, not <i>the</i> Soul Collector&#39; - I don&#39;t know much about this guy&#39;s character, so maybe he wouldn&#39;t put any inflection on those words, but if it had been me saying it I would have stressed them. <br><br>Also, near the beginning he says &#39;you see I made a deal with the devil, yes there’s a devil and yes I made a deal with one&#39;, then toward the end he refers to &#39;this guy we call Lucifer, whether he’s the devil himself or not we don’t care&#39;. That seems contradictory - first he&#39;s telling us that the devil is definitely real, and that he made a deal with him, and then he&#39;s telling us that he&#39;s unsure if Lucifer is the devil or not. Surely he&#39;d know whether or not the guy he made the deal with was Lucifer or someone else? <br><br>It&#39;s a cool idea, and I&#39;d certainly read more of it. If you do decide to write any more, and want a beta, let me know. <br></p>

            <p>Well, everyone knows how I started out as a creative writer (Stu-then-manufactured-bit agents, inconsistent with the established universe, random capitalization,etc. etc. etc.), and I haven&#39;t been able to make my writing coherent with the PPC shared multiverse until now, but enough about that.<br><br>This particular post is about how I could be an asset to the PPC, namely in the sense that....I don&#39;t know how to put this without putting it too bluntly, so let&#39;s go with this:<br><br>I am the kind of person that laughed at the sight of &quot;For your eyes only&quot;&#39;s infamous baby-talk rape sentence.<br><br>I am the kind of person that read through the mission of &quot;C*l*br**N&quot; with a straight face (I would probably read the fic itself if the link weren&#39;t broken. And yes, most likely with a straight face too.)<br><br>I am the kind of person that stopped reading &quot;Subjugation&quot; not because it was disgusting, bizarre, or hideously, hideously depraved. I stopped reading it because it was boring.<br><br>This isn&#39;t merely squick tolerance, this is possibly squick...I don&#39;t know, squick immunity? (not likely to be true immunity, because everyone has their limits, but close)<br><br>I&#39;m not necessarily the type to boast, but I bet I could look at a fic involving the rape and subsequent dismemberment of a baby written in urple prose with a straight face, maybe even get a laugh out of it if it was badly done enough (or had been done in a manner that made it clear that the author fetishes about that).<br><br>After writing parts of my persona fic, I&#39;ve noticed my writing has improved greatly, but I still have problems with my style, which doesn&#39;t fit the PPC universe as much as I would like. That, and I&#39;m just a rookie in the first place, even after all the time I&#39;ve had to improve.<br><br><br>So, anyone willing to help me? Because from the moment I discovered you guys, I&#39;ve always wanted to write PPC stories because I thought you were the coolest community on the net. Everything about the PPC just screamed &quot;Coolest concept Ever!!!!&quot; to me, and I dreamed of writing for you from the minute I posted my first message.<br><br>Sincerely: 7.65x54R</p>

            <p>I mean, okay, good for you I guess that you can read horrifying things without being horrified, but... basically, you&#39;re saying you can write missions into stories people don&#39;t want to read. Only... people don&#39;t want to read those stories. So how would it help for you to write a mission into them?

            <p>If it&#39;s your own, then this obviously loops back to &#39;so what?&#39;. If other people&#39;s... well, it feels like you&#39;re in a bit of a feedback loop here.

I <i>didn&#39;t</i> just up and decide &#39;hey, let&#39;s do a Legendary Badfic!&#39;; I spent fifteen stories crafting a character people loved (srsly, they did), then threw the worst we had at him. It was <i>not</i> something I could have done at the start of his run. People would have just... not read it, because it&#39;s C<em>l</em>br</strong>n.<br><br>That mission was more about Dafydd than it was about the badfic.

            <p>FYI, the reason we haven&#39;t sporked it yet isn&#39;t because the horror is too much for us two poor lily-livered wilting violets (although, let&#39;s be clear, it is horrifying). There are actually two reasons:<br><br>1. I had to build up my characters first. See hS&#39;s comments above. I mean, at this point people like Nume and Ilraen, I could do it now if I wanted to, BUT:<br>2. Arguably the more important reason is that making something as long, yucky, and mechanically decent as &quot;Subjugation&quot; into an entertaining mission is <i>hard</i>. In my book, if a mission isn&#39;t going to be entertaining to other people, there&#39;s no point in writing it, so I&#39;ve been taking this time to figure out how the heck to do it. I have a pretty decent notion, I think, but the devil&#39;s in the details.<br><br>We&#39;ll get to it when we&#39;re good and ready—not because it &quot;needs to be done,&quot; by the way, but simply because our characters have a personal history with that monster, and we like the idea of making them go back and face it. If not for that, we could happily declare it unmissionable and let it go without losing any sleep over it.<br><br>Never forget that badfic is just words on a screen. What the PPC does is objectively silly and unimportant. We do it because it&#39;s fun, not because we&#39;re on some kind of crusade. In fact, crusader-types tend not to get Permission, because (a) their writing tends not to be funny, and (b) they freak us out.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>And I wasn&#39;t trying to &#39;win&#39;; actually, &#39;winning&#39; would constitute you becoming the greatest PPC writer since Jay and Acacia, and stunning us all with an epic series of adventures. You deciding <i>not</i> to write is... the opposite of winning.<br><br>Okay, how to make your writing style fit: think of a TV show, like <i>The X-Files</i>, or <i>Doctor Who</i>, or <i>Star Trek</i>, or <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>, or what have you. There are three types of episode:<br><br>-Monster of the Week. The team deals with a specific event or problem, and then forget all about it.<br>-Mythology/arc plot. The team deal with something related to the overall plot.<br>-Series finale. Big massive drama, lots of explosions, character death, trauma, and whatnot.<br><br>You seem to be thinking about mostly writing series finales. But even a TV show doesn&#39;t make every episode a riot of Stuff(TM); if they did, you&#39;d quickly get overwhelmed. Same in the PPC: most missions are, and should be, Monsters (Badfics) of the Week. Fairly normal, moderately easy reading. If every mission starts with &#39;I want to tear out my eyes, this is EVEN WORSE than the last one!&#39;, then... overload.<br><br>So start with Monsters of the Week. Send your agents into missions that <i>don&#39;t</i> make them try to commit suicide or break the rules or torture anyone or nearly get killed or - basically all the things that Laburnum was so fond of. ;) If you do that, and do it well, then when you come to a Series Finale, you&#39;ll make <i>us</i> cry out, too - in sympathy for the agents we&#39;ve come to know.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>A <i>few</i> PPCers have written missions involving heavily NSFW material, but that doesn&#39;t mean the entire community can handle it.  In the initial post, you brought up all of three missions, one of which <i>could not be completed</i> by the authors because of how disgusting it was.  There are literally hundreds of PPC missions now, nearly all of which are roughly PG-13ish; and only a handful of the missions of higher rating handle the really offensively squicky material you&#39;re talking about.  To put it bluntly, missions like that <b>are not what the PPC is about</b>.<br><br>Now, the community doesn&#39;t have any rules against that sort of mission, and it&#39;s fine to write and publish them; that&#39;s not what&#39;s being discussed here.  The problem is that this community may contain:<br>a) underage people, who should not be exposed to the kind of visuals you brought up in your initial post, and<br>b) people who, for whatever personal reason, may be emotionally hurt and made uncomfortable by that kind of material.  This is called &quot;triggering.&quot;<br><br>So, how do we protect our fellow internet users from accidentally seeing such material when they don&#39;t want to?  The difficulty lies in the fact that you and I don&#39;t know off-hand who can safely read potentially sensitive and inappropriate material just by looking at their screenames.  So we put warnings on such material when we post it to a public viewing area, such as this Board (or any similar message board; this is general internet courtesy, not a PPC-specific rule), so that each person can decide for themselves whether they are comfortable in clicking or not.  For example, I added &quot;potential trigger warning&quot; in parentheses to the top of this post, as I am discussing triggering situations.  I&#39;m actually being careful not to get too explicit with anything here, but I added the warning <b>just in case</b>, because I don&#39;t know who will be reading this, and I am afraid of hurting anyone, or exposing underage PPCers to info they might not yet be mature enough to understand.  You&#39;ll also note that the missions you referred to, and the wiki pages about their targets, are labeled &quot;NSFW&quot; themselves, for the same reasons.  <br><br>So, to summarize:  Yes, some (many!) PPCers are disgusted by sexual violence, and really only a small fraction of us have dealt with it directly in missions.  (Even for those of us who have, this hardly constitutes a &quot;regular basis.&quot;)  Bringing up this kind of topic can still be hurtful for some people, even when it&#39;s only used as examples in discussion.  And as for &quot;how would people react?&quot;  Well, some people would react by <i>not reading</i> it, and that&#39;s okay, because they wouldn&#39;t have been comfortable reading it, and they deserve the respect of being given the tools to avoid things that could potentially hurt them.</p>

            <p>You say want to write missions here, and then you turn around and say &quot;Oh, PPC missions aren&#39;t funny to me except when the agents are grossed out over a bleepfic?&quot; I can see a few problems with that mindset, guy.<br><br>First of all, I spy a paradox. How can you admire the concept of a PPC mission but also have a problem with what makes it a PPC mission?<br><br>Second, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC"> the Guide to the PPC</a> repeatedly emphasizes that we as a community are about having fun and supporting all manner of goodfic by killing off all manner of badfic. <i>All</i> manner of it, not just the grossest stuff out there. You want to spork the worst of the worst, great, more power to you; just remember that <strike>you&#39;re standing on a planet that&#39;s evolving and revolving at 900 miles an hour</strike> not everyone here wants to read your latest NSFW/NSFB mission.<br><br>Third, and most importantly, SQUICK IS NEVER EVER FUNNY. <b>Especially</b> not when it&#39;s handled like your second example. I get the whole &quot;find something to laugh at to distract yourself from the horror&quot; thing, but...come on, dude, the character still had to go through that horrible event.

            <p>Let me tell you a story. Do you mind? I hope not, because it&#39;s one of the good ones - it&#39;s true.<br><br>A few years back - this would have been around 2008 - the PPC hadn&#39;t much heard of TVTropes. We <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=956;title=PPC%20Message%20Board;pagemark=75">apparently</a> had a page, but without much on it. Then, for reasons I&#39;m still not clear on, Tawaki and Laburnum decided to expand it.<br><br>And I mean <i>massively</i> expand it. Suddenly, it became this huge list of tropes and examples - but all those examples were from Tawaki&#39;s and Laburnum&#39;s stories. Thing is, Tawaki wrote massive overarching plots, and Laburnum wrote NC-17-rated missions with lots of violence (sexual or otherwise), and neither of them are in any way representative of how the vast majority of PPC missions go down.<br><br>But that was what was up there, and straightaway a trend started that&#39;s continued to this day: people arriving on the Board from TVT (that&#39;s good!) with the ineradicable impression that we&#39;re either all about squick (that&#39;s bad), or all about big dramatic paradigm-shifting events (that&#39;s bad too).<br><br>In 2010 and 2011, efforts were made to change things by going through and deleting trope examples that weren&#39;t representative of the PPC as a whole, but they fell through - as I understand it, because TVTropes didn&#39;t approve of the PPC &#39;censoring&#39; its own pages. Other examples have (I assume?) been added, but the baseline is still the Tawaki-Laburnum Giant Drama With Sexual Violence stuff.<br><br>So no: Laburnum is way, <i>way</i> unrepresentative of the PPC. Read something else as well. Can I recommend <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/1/PPC-Driftwood">Driftwood</a>? [/obligatory plug]<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There was a lot of drama in TVT during the editing spree, and in fact we had a big row on their forums about it, but ironically Fast Eddie was perfectly okay with it despite my adaptation of the situation to Plort, it was his mods - I think Fighteer and Madrugada - who gave us trouble. Two of us got banned, me and Caddy, and there were some issues with our things being reverted but for the most part it settled down and we got our way. The big edit spree drama kinda died down and the work finished quietly, though admittedly I now avoid TV Tropes so maybe stuff&#39;s got worse.</p>

            <p>I actually stumbled upon Laburnum&#39;s missions a few years before I joined the PPC and I remember going &#39;WTF?&#39; to quite a bit of it.

            <p>They&#39;re plenty of ways. You could MST something (squick tolerance is helpful there) , you could write a history of the PPC that goes into great detail about the events (we really need that), you could Beta for people. Oh, and I recommend you go into the GAFF boards and MST stuff there due to your high squick tolerance.</p>

            <p>The (Shin) Megami Tensei section of the pit of voles is nowhere near as large as the one for it&#39;s sub-series, Persona.<br><br>Yes, you heard that right. Herr Wozzeck and Nord were the only ones on the board to possess an even basic knowledge of persona, let alone it&#39;s more obscure mother series.<br><br>As mentioned, I seem to be the only one who knows anything about SMT here, mainly because I own several of the games (and yes, for anyone who has played Etrian Odyssey, SMT is made by the same company, so it&#39;s just as hard.)<br><br>Enough about that. The next part is mostly for my new agent idea (Which only I can grade)<br><br>Agent Errol originated from a written lets-play turned possible trollfic that one day mysteriously vanished from the internet, along with it&#39;s author (Who is now thought to have been using an alias). He is basically once-troll-possessed version of Flynn from Shin Megami Tensei IV. He ended up in HQ after a plothole originated at the end of his home fic (which was never completed), and was freed of the troll&#39;s possession. Unlike other agents, Errol is not allowed to use a weapon (His demons fulfill that role) due to the aforementioned fact that he can summon demons and he was once possessed by a troll (The Flowers do not want him to revert back into a sue).<br><br>Personality-wise, Errol is very passive-aggressive (he is normally very calm, but get him angry and the gloves come off). He is still developing as a character due to the fact that his canon self was a blank slate and the troll provided most of the (Bad) characterization in his home fic. he considers himself to not adhere to the twin-binary morality system of his home continua, but when pushed, will say he is Dark-Neutral (no matter what, he has dark definitely as his primary alignment)<br><br>Errol usually has 3 primary demons stored in his gauntlet (the gauntlet has a built in universal translator, but the demons also wear them in the event of separation from their summoner).<br><br>Closet is a Mot and Errol&#39;s primary demon. This reaper conducts himself like a gentleman, speaking formally most of the time. He gets his name from the fact that he (Like pretty much every Mot), hides in his coffin most of the time. Closet&#39;s skills include an extremely powerful fire blast, instant death runes (no worries, these can fail, and do most of the time) that come in single and multi-target variations, and magic barriers that can deflect either physical or energy attacks (I plan on using the latter on Rose Potter, eventually)<br><br>Dumat is a Seth, and is the second-most powerful demon that Errol has. The massive draconic vile is usually used to close the distance between Closet&#39;s ranged magic and Ripely&#39;s physical attacks, as he can fight at any distance effectively. he is aloof and somewhat cold, only caring about the mission at hand. Dumat&#39;s skills include gun blasts in both single-shot and volley forms (these manifest from his mouth, even he doesn&#39;t know why this works), a darkness-charged teleporting slash with his claws and talons that are not very powerful but have a low chance of instantly killing an enemy, a stronger non-elemental claw attack, a single-target instant death rune, and the ability to teleport his allies (but not himself) to safety.<br><br>Ripely is a Vetala, and the weakest of Errol&#39;s demon compliment. named because his appearance reminds people of a chestburster victim, Ripely is constantly cracking jokes about whatever bizarre situation being a member of the PPC manages to get one into. Ripely&#39;s skills include various slashes with his claws and chest-mounted teeth, which include poisonous, dark insta-kill, rusted metal, and single and multi-target variations, the ability to breathe either a weakening fog or a blast of acid that weakens an opponents defenses, and a blast of fire.<br><br>I might not ask for permission right now, but I personally think I have actually decent agents this time (the reason I&#39;m not asking for permission now is I&#39;m tied up in some other writings).</p>

            <p>You say <i>only I can grade</i> your agent idea: not so! You may be the only person who can determine how close to their canon they are, but anyone can judge how good they are as a <i>character</i>. Remember, people who read your missions aren&#39;t going to look up the canon first, so they&#39;ll be going purely on the character as written.<br><br>And... well. Let&#39;s take a look:<br><br>Errol. The idea of him not being allowed to use a weapon is interesting, but I don&#39;t think it works. We have lots of ex-Suvian agents, so even if you offered a justification for &#39;use sword, become Stu&#39; (which don&#39;t make much sense), you&#39;d have to explain why no-one <i>else</i> has the same problem. And even if that happens - agents are supposed to use weapons that fit into the canon they&#39;re working in. Using pet demons is fine if you&#39;re in, say, <i>His Dark Materials</i>, but it wouldn&#39;t work at all in, say, <i>Star Trek</i>.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say it couldn&#39;t work with some tweaks. I see two options:<br><br>1/ The demons take on the form of relevant weapons, staying as close to their norm as they can. So in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, Closet could be a magic staff, Dumat a bow, and Ripely a sword. Since there&#39;s at least one <i>talking</i> sword in Middle-earth, he could even talk back (and if you weave a little <i>galvorn</i> into the makeup of the other two, so could they). But they&#39;d still basically be weapons, and unable to act on their own. In something like <i>Star Trek</i>, you could look at intelligent weapons, or even androids.<br><br>2/ The demons are placed in normal disguises, and lose (the majority of) their powers. So in LotR, they might all be elves - much to their chagrin, I&#39;m sure. I can see them trying their level best to get Errol to give them the most powerful disguises possible, and him constantly refusing and setting them as, like, rabbits or something - or, equally, trying his best and bending the rules to make them all balrogs.<br><br>Either of those notions (which are just off the top of my head) would work. Carting around actual demons into random verses? That&#39;s not so good.<br><br>Now, personality. You&#39;ve pretty much given them one sentence each on this, which... isn&#39;t very much to go on. It&#39;s like describing the protagonist of <i>The Hobbit</i> as &#39;short, moderately wealthy, and gets multiple magical artefacts over the course of the story&#39;. Yes, okay, that&#39;s <i>accurate</i> - but we don&#39;t read about Bilbo because of his height and ring. We read about him for his character, and his character growth and conflicts.<br><br>So, Closet speaks formally - are we thinking condescending? Mellow? Above it all? Furious formal put-downs? <i>Insults</i>? How does he cope with the fact that there&#39;s a wise-cracking Vetala along for the ride? Or is <i>he</i> wise-cracking as well? How does he feel about being basically a prisoner and pet? How does he feel about having a lot more freedom than he&#39;s used to? How does he feel about, technically, having a <i>job</i>?<br><br>And so on. I don&#39;t need answers to all those questions, by the way - but <i>you</i> need to know who these people are, and how they&#39;ll interact with each other. If your missions end up looking like this:<br><br><i>&quot;Verily, I see the Sue,&quot; said Closet, using his instant death rune, which failed.<br><br>&quot;See? You? That&#39;s a laugh!&quot; said Ripely, slashing at a bit part with his rusted metal teeth.<br><br>&quot;Focus,&quot; said Dumat coldly, teleporting Errol away from an attacking Stu.<br><br>&quot;Now I&#39;m angry!&quot; bellowed Errol, and started hitting people himself.</i><br><br>... then you&#39;re doing it wrong. Readers want interaction, not lists of traits.<br><br>And coming back to Errol: you say &#39;passive-aggressive&#39;, but you seem to mean &#39;passive, or aggressive&#39;. Passive-aggressive is a term for... well, Wikipedia says &#39;indirect expression of hostility&#39;. Sarcasm, sulking, procrastination and the like. It&#39;s not &#39;normally calm until you get him cross&#39;.<br><br>And then... oh, dear, another Blank Slate character. For some reason, people really like coming up with these. So, how long are you planning on showing him &#39;developing&#39; for? Two missions? Four? Is it going to be shown through him being surprised by his own reactions? Maybe through him not <i>having</i> any reactions, and having to consciously decide &#39;right, when Ripely insults me, from now on I&#39;ll respond with sarcasm&#39;, which then becomes part of his personality? Or... are you just going to say that so you don&#39;t have to try and describe his personality? Because that&#39;s what usually happens. I&#39;d really like to see something like one of the above descriptions - but I&#39;m not at all sure that&#39;s where you&#39;re going.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>1/ That&#39;s clearly a &#39;yes&#39; to my previous question.<br><br>2/ Your characters back in April consisted of a terroristic sadist and someone you didn&#39;t tell us anything about, personality-wise. (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=256812;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this thread</a>) When you were asked to flesh the latter out, you just <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=256906;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">copied what someone else suggested</a>. The former, yes, is a bad character - but the latter is just... not putting the time in.<br><br>There are good ideas in your characters. But... how to put this? You seem to be building sets of powers and abilities and then sticking a personality on top. That&#39;s a good way to make a computer game - but it&#39;s a terrible way to make a character.<br><br>Do it the other way round. Create a personality - for an agent, for any other character you&#39;re coming up with - as if it were for a normal, everyday human being. Then add the abilities and see what changes. Once you have, say, a character with abandonment issues and a tendency to sulk when things don&#39;t go its way, it will be a well-rounded character whether you make it an elf who spends decades alone in the forest, a ghost which haunts its old house because it can&#39;t let go, or a spaceship which won&#39;t let its crew leave. (Or, for that matter, Dream of the Endless, who slots quite neatly into that description...)<br><br>This is particularly important in the PPC, where powers-and-abilities tend to be stripped away by disguises. If your character is solely about their skillset, then how are we supposed to recognise them when they&#39;re disguised as a teenaged orangutan?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to give some advice. 7.65- can I call you that?- before you take criticism of any kind as a personal attack, reread it several times and wonder if the comment was meant to help or was just outright meant to hurt. Believe it or not, the majority of people in the world aren&#39;t mean on purpose, though it sure as hell can seem like it at times.<br><br>As for your agents, really take the time to get to know them. Why do they work for the PPC? What are their fears and weaknesses, their hopes and dreams? I had it easy because my agents started out as avatars of myself and a friend, but I know they&#39;re going to change the longer I write them. <br><br>Start with personalities, maybe. Who would you rather read about: an eager, not-yet-disillusioned-with-her-job agent who prefers to use a crowbar as a weapon because it&#39;s functional outside of combat, or a personality-less agent who can smite Sues without having to even lift a finger? <br><br><s>Just ignore the blatant self-advertisement kthx</s><br><br>What I&#39;m getting at is what others have been saying on the thread. Ask yourself why you want to write a specific agent. What would make them interesting besides their powers?<br><br>You&#39;re by no means a poor writer; just a little overeager. Chillax. Take a while to develop your agents and maybe next time don&#39;t go swearing at people. I promise it won&#39;t do you any favors and it really won&#39;t endear you to anybody. Nobody is out to make you feel bad. Everyone is their own worst critic.<br><br>So let&#39;s shake hands and put this behind us, yeah?</p>

            <p>Five times, actually.<br>My point is this, though: ConCrit hurts more than flames. Flames are just &quot;U sax balz&quot;, &quot;ur an idiot&quot;, etc - people being immature. ConCrit, however, points out what you&#39;re doing wrong. Nobody likes that, but the first step to fixing your mistakes is knowing what they are.</p>

            <p>Tonight, 10/25, the finale of <i>Cardfight!! Vanguard</i> was available for Crunchyroll.com&#39;s free users (It was available for Premium users since last week.) And I have to tell you, the feels! All the feels!<br><br>All those appearances from those great Cardfighters from all four seasons...<br>Kai&#39;s change from lone-wolf to someone who&#39;s a bit more open...<br>And that epic closer that brought back the <i>original </i>Vanguard<i> theme!!!</i><br><br>*squees like a little girl for 11.259 seconds*<br><br>*ahem*<br><br>But with the series over, I wonder if there is a fanfic explosion in the works. Assuming that the fandom is big enough, I myself am predicting ship wars aplenty on the horizon. Of course, there&#39;s the obvious Aichi/Misaki vs. Aichi/Kourin ship war, but given the multiple friendships in the show, this continuum is easily amenable to slash ships as well(e.g., Kai/Aichi, Kai/Ren, Kai/Miwa).<br><br>So, if anyone here also watches <i>Vanguard</i>, what do you think? Has anyone read any <i>Vanguard</i> goodfic? Anyone looking forward to/dreading an imminent fanfic explosion? Any predictions?<br><br>Stand up, Vanguard!</p>

The problem is that my schedule is almost completely booked by research for most of the week, and I&#39;m only available for limited time periods (I&#39;ll send &#39;em by PM to my partners later). I wonder if we can work something out based on this constraint?<br><br>Lastly, I&#39;ve found a new type of mini! doctorlit really liked the choice of mini-Boulders for the Indiana Jones continuum, which was a spur-of-the-moment thing on my part. The last page of this mission lists all of the minis I found while writing it. I&#39;ll see if I can put a new mini page on the Wiki, but until then, if anyone wants to adopt a pet rock to deck some Suvian faces in, please let me know! :)</p>

Ehm... trollfics can be fun to spork, but don&#39;t do too many of them - it&#39;s more fun, I think, to see the stories which are pointed in vaguely the right direction (and missing terribly) than to just read an essentially random series of events while the agents say &#39;This makes no sense!

            <p>You&#39;ve admirably handled that trollfic. Are you planning on having all three of your characters working together on a mission sometime in the future?<br><br>A few nitpicks, though:<br><i>so if you think I’ll let you Weavile your way out of this mess</i><br>Did you consider having Falchion say &quot;Sneasel your way out&quot; instead? IMO, that would make the pun easier to grasp.<br><br><i>doing unspeakable things in full view him</i><br>I believe you want to say &quot;in full view <b>of</b> him&quot;?<br><br><i>flapping his arms in a crude butterfly-stroke like a sea eagle with its wings.</i><br>This clause could use a bit more clarification. Personally, I think that the sentence should have ended at &quot;butterfly-stroke,&quot; since the image was clear enough at that point; IMO, the rest muddied up the picture.<br>Alternatively, consider adding a verb: &quot;like a sea eagle <b>does</b> with its wings&quot;. As presently written, I had trouble piecing the sentence together.<br><br><i>“i am goin to END YO!!!” The Troll roared in fury before charging at Sarah.</i><br>Did the Troll roar that line, or did he say that line, then roar? As written, it must be interpreted in the latter fashion. Otherwise, the word &quot;the&quot; needs to have a lowercase T.</p>

            <p>Nice work! You don&#39;t have to worry about finding time to collaborate with me just yet, by the way; I haven&#39;t quite finished my prompts yet (yes, I prewrote my permission prompts, don&#39;t judge me), and am super busy with college stuff to boot.<br><br>Anyway, concrit time! Your narration and dialogue are a little long-winded in places, but that might be because I had no idea how to change some parts and so left them alone. Take this from the first paragraph of Act Two, for example:<br><br><i>&quot;She had just finished her appointment with the Kudzu some ten minutes ago, during which she’d also had a run-in with Violet. The canon’s leg had been regenerated completely, and any memories of her disastrous vacation to Isla Sorna were long gone by now. Rashida hadn’t stuck around for long, but Violet had at least asked her how Sarah was doing. She was told that her friend was fine, but that she’d be staying with her until further notice, though correspondence with the canon was not out of the question. While Violet was led off to be returned to her family, the Sphinx agent decided to make use of her time by picking up her prescription sedative from Medical, where she struck up a talk with Dr. Appleday about the previous mission.&quot;</i><br><br>Yeah. Those are some very involved sentences right there. I found a website some time ago that has <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/writing-guide#Being-laconic">advice on being laconic</a>, among other writing tips you probably knew already. <br><br>Another thing I noticed is your penchant for referring to Falchion as &quot;the (disguised) Skarmory Agent&quot; and Rashida as &quot;the Sphinx Agent&quot;. Leaving off the &quot;Agent&quot; is fine if you need to distinguish them from other characters or something; in paragraphs where they&#39;re the only two present, it comes across as weird and overly formal.<br><br>Speaking of Falchion, does he really need to refer to Rashida as &quot;Mean Old Rosie&quot; so often? It comes across as juvenile even for him. Just &quot;Rosie&quot; or &quot;Rose&quot; (and &quot;Rashida&quot; in really serious parts) would do just as well.<br><br>Thank you again for letting me beta-read your mission. I enjoyed working on it! *hugs*</p>

            <p>So, we finally have a <i>Men in Black</i> mission!  And I am immemsely amused that neuralyzers got to play a starring role in it, considering they&#39;re the one aspect of MiB that the PPC has featured for so long.<br><br>This mission is cool just because of how <i>different</i> it is.  A <i>Finance</i> mission, holey moley!  I love Sambar.  He&#39;s just soooo focused on his job, he can&#39;t see anything else; he reminds me of me!  And he was perfect to throw at Agent Huinesoron right after he started trying to be less rude, because anyone would feel like being rude to Sambar.<br><br>The mission was a great choice as an acquisition mission, because of all the pointless crossover stuff thrown in.  The main focus of the badfic was so surreal and random, I also like that you did something more creative than assassinate replacement!Arwen, because for once, I don&#39;t think it would have felt like it fit the crime as well.<br><br>You did a great job of keeping Agent K in character throughout, as well.  His completely nonplussed confidence fits perfectly with his portrayal in the movie.  (Man, can you imagine how clunky the narration would get if the old DAVD agents with the letters at the end of their names had an MiB mission?<br><br><i>&quot;Quick, K!&quot; whispered K.  &quot;Go get K, we need to follow K now!<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just going home,&quot; said Delta V.</i>)</p>

But, at last, it&#39;s <i>finished</i>. The three sections cover three different aspects of time-and-space:<br><br>*<b>Space And</b> is Multiverse Theory; it discusses the nature of a single multiverse, then goes on to describe the history of theories regarding the multiple multiverses out there.<br><br>*<b>Relative Dimensions</b> is a discussion of how PPC HQ fits into the Prime Multiverse. It also includes a lengthy aside on disguises, canon cloaking, and SEP fields.<br><br>*<b>In Time</b> is entirely new, and is basically a description of the formation of alternate timelines of the PPC. These exist in the Prime Multiverse - they have the same origin as the PPC, and the same World One - but are different timelines.<br><br>*<b>Multiversal Atlas</b> is the last section, and lists all the multiverses and alternate timelines I could remember being discussed. &#39;Attested&#39; means they&#39;ve actually interacted with the Prime PPC; &#39;rumoured&#39; is other things people have written which haven&#39;t (yet) had that interaction. A bit cheeky, I know, but I wanted to make the list both in-universe and complete.<br><br>An <b>important note</b>: this is an in-universe document. It&#39;s not necessarily right. In fact, in one place, it&#39;s dead wrong: it makes no mention of <i>our</i> world. In fact, to be truly complete, you need an extra layer in between: our world creates various &#39;Real Worlds&#39; containing fictionalised versions of us - such as the people behind the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/TCDABoard.htm">TCDA Board</a>, or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1iLwWjPFptYLoexCBWq5h9bcPbajvlWPnTrL5A2_c-7A">those people Narto met</a>, which each create their own &#39;World One&#39;, which forms the heart of a multiverse. It&#39;s complicated by the fact that our world stands both as the creator of a bunch of &#39;real world&#39;s, and as the direct creator of the PPC&#39;s World One - but anyway, they don&#39;t know any of that, so they won&#39;t discuss it. ;)<br><br>One final note: the Division of Applied-and-theoretical Multiversal Physics has never been mentioned before; I&#39;ll be introducing it properly in a story I have vaguely planned. It&#39;s basically HQ&#39;s physical sciences department (since DoSAT is more engineering); whether it&#39;s a division of DoSAT or DMSE&amp;R is an open question. ;)<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Yes, it&#39;s a horribly-dense pseudo-scientific dissertation. That&#39;s sort of the point. <sup>-^</sup> ~hS</p>

            <p>This theory is based on something suggested by Neshomeh on the wiki&#39;s Multiverse Theory talk page. I&#39;ve expanded it slightly, given it a diagram and a name, and plan to include it on the revised version of that page. But for your entertainment, I figured I&#39;d also put it up here.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>(Note: for the wiki article, a 3-D model of time is used: &#39;depth-time&#39; is your past-future line, while &#39;height&#39; and &#39;width-time&#39; are defined differently depending on the theory)<br><br>The <b>Nested Elongated Superstring Hypothesis</b> visualises each canon universe as plane in two temporal dimensions. Its ‘depth-time’ axis corresponds to its past and future, while its ‘width-time’, as in Temporal Axis Theory, is probability. Alternate universes of a canon are placed along the width-time axis, while the various canon universes are viewed as being ‘stacked’ in height-time.<br><br>The key difference from Temporal Axis Theory is that the PPC and its alternates are seen as identical planes, but rotated to intersect the ‘canon’ planes. The height-time axis of the canon ‘stack’ corresponds to the depth-time axis of a PPC-type universe; in other words, accessing a different canon is simply a matter of travelling through time. This is a simple task in PPC HQ, though it does explain the generally difficult nature of timekeeping in the PPC.<br><br>HQ’s width-time axis - the probability regularly manipulated by portals - corresponds directly to that of the canon universes: probability manipulation allows direct access to fanfics. Alternate PPCs - ‘alternate multiverses’ - are separated along their own height-time axes, which PPC technology is not able to transit through.<br><br>The PPC height-time axis corresponds to the canonical depth-time axis. A semi-cyclic temporal model is utilised by NESH, in which canon worlds reach their end and repeat, but with differences. These differences explain the ‘mirror’ nature of the canons of the Mirror Multiverse, as well as the near-impossibility of travelling to alternate multiverses: to reach them would require agents to pass through the end of one universe and the beginning of another. The formation of Bridges is seen as an act of shortening the length of the temporal loop, as was observed in the ‘Suedom’ incident.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/NESH.png"><br><br>Discuss?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been looking forward to seeing this piece in its full for quite some time. Some of the things I&#39;ve been planning to write with the DIAU definitely play into the concept of the multiverse and alternate timelines. Plus, it&#39;s a kind of world-building that&#39;s not typically seen -- or at least, that I&#39;ve not typically seen. The timeline tree was greatly appreciated.<br><br>I have some questions about the document and what it talks about in regards to the PPC (since this is supposed to be an in-universe thing). What sort of publicity would a document like this have? I ask because it talks very frankly about things like the Sundering, which I would think might be the sort of thing to cause a hubbub in the PPC if it were widely known about. My assumption would be that, if it isn&#39;t kept classified for reasons like previously mentioned, it has the same sort of circulation that any sort of overly technical dissertation would have: very little apart from a small circle of experts.<br><br>Related to the previous, what sort of publicity would alternate timelines and multiverses have in the PPC at large? Are they widely known phenomena or just figures of speculation?<br><br>Finally, can I make mention of this document and its contents in a future mission (with proper attribution, of course)?<br><br>Good stuff! Take a bow, you&#39;ve earned it.<br><br>PC<br><br>P.S. Might I suggest <i>Doc Who</i> for the Noirverse version of <i>Doctor Who</i>?</p>

            <p>Which may both be true. The first is that this document may well be from the future. Actually, in one sense it definitely is - it discusses the Catastrophe Theory timeline, which won&#39;t spin off until 2015 according to Phobos. So at the very least, it&#39;s from next year. The other reason to think this is that it discusses things that, as you say, shouldn&#39;t be known - particulary, as of <i>Triple Prime</i>, Gaspard is actively working to keep the Flowers from finding out the details of the Sundering. This document would then have to post-date some event which rendered that information irrelevant - possibly Oopart&#39;s actions next year, possibly something else.<br><br>The other answer is that this is, as you say, a technical document. Most agents aren&#39;t going to read it; it may even be only an internal document in the DAMP. Doesn&#39;t mean any given agent <i>can&#39;t</i> find it, of course.<br><br>The out-of-universe answer is, of course, that I wanted to write a theory which would account for what <i>we</i> know - and we know more than the PPC does. If you like, you can imagine that this is the &#39;slightly enhanced&#39; version of the document, with another copy - one which doesn&#39;t specifically mention various unknown timelines - being the actual, IU version.<br><br>Knowledge of alternate timelines: hrm. I think at least the Mirror Multiverse is fairly well-known - we had &#39;good Daleks&#39; from there helping out during the 2008 crises, so it&#39;d be hard to miss. And since Lux is quite a sociable creature, I&#39;d imagine her origin is also commonly known. So at least the basics of Multiverse Theory are out there.<br><br>Alternate timelines, less so. The only people to have travelled between them are Lou&#39;s family, and they don&#39;t talk much. ;) So I&#39;m  not sure the general body of agents would have any knowledge of it - though they could of course theorise anyway. They actually <i>do</i> have one bit of evidence - a video from the Arthurverse made it into the Multiverse Monitor - but it got subsumed by conspiracy theories, so is presumably ignored. ;)<br><br>Phew - that was a lot of words. Sorry! You can definitely mention the document in your stories - I&#39;m going to integrate it into the Wiki at some point, too. <i>Doc Who</i> is now listed. And, just for giggles, I&#39;ve added something I just realised: we-the-Board have actually <i>written</i> the &#39;Author&#39; worlds for <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/TCDABoard.htm">one</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gdv7Jmp1z3utpLVP7pff4ptX1Itya6nZhsRfsqVXEZ0/pub">two</a>, and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Boarder_Shipfic_Fest">three</a> of the other Multiverses.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure rumored is the right word for it.  Since the story is based on the actual <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Catastrophe_Theory">Theory</a>, I think &quot;hypothosized by unbalanced individuals&quot; might be more appropriate.  Who knows, maybe this crazy story about how it was subverted by means of time travel is just their way of explaining why it didn&#39;t happen when they said it would.  That it hasn&#39;t happened might even constitute proof of its existance, for some of these individuals.<br><br>Also, it occurs to me that I should get some things up on the Wiki about CT.<br><br>-Phobos, who might decide to take on Cycle Theory next?</p>

            <p>So does that suggest/imply/outright state that something relevant to Catastrophe Theory occurred in 2010? Let&#39;s see... from &#39;The End is Night&#39; I see that Oopart joined &#39;nearly ten years&#39; ago, and people were still talking about the assassination of the Board at that time. The earliest event that&#39;s been linked to that assassination was the poisoning a week earlier... and you <i>do</i> list the setting as &#39;Ten Years Hence&#39;. Was the assassination actually in 2010 (thus &#39;for a given value of ten&#39;)? Was the graph a couple of years off? Or was... something else?<br><br>I also note that the Sue invasion happened at least &#39;several years&#39; ago, which is when Amy was lost. Oh, but I see from &#39;Bound and Gagged&#39; that the PFO clumps the assassination and the occupation together in time, suggesting they happened close together... so is the &#39;Catastrophe&#39; of the title both of those, in 2010? 2012? Some other year?<br><br>Yes, of course I&#39;m planning a chart.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>However, I can clear a few things up.<br><br>The moratorium on Emergencies slowed the progression of the theorized Catastrophe.  It should have happened around 2010, as you note.  As it stands, the moratorium granted a brief reprieve, but things got rolling again after a just a few years.<br><br>The Assassination happened in, more or less, the Present.  Call it 2015 HST (though I personally don&#39;t put much stock in HST) and The End Is Nigh happens &#39;round about 2024-ish.  You are right that the poisoning happens about a week before the Assassination.  However, the Invasion happens a few months later.  There were other events in those intervening months that I won&#39;t get in to, here.  The PFO lumps them together into &quot;Things that happened around the same time that left me in charge&quot;.<br><br>Also, Amy was lost &#39;several years&#39; ago but not during the Invasion.  She was lost during the Occupation.  Probably 2019 HST, if you want me to be more specific.<br><br>As to what happened in 2010...well...I got permission.  Coincidence?

            <p>My theory is that HST is basically a statistical process: whenever the Flowers (presumably there&#39;s someone in charge of this, but I can&#39;t think who it&#39;d be - Finance, only I don&#39;t think the Morning Glory is interested/knows) note that the majority of contacts with World One - new badfics, new agents, new canon releases - are coming from a given month-and-year, they switch the HST date. Since agents are in and out on missions, don&#39;t have particularly synchronised timelines, and don&#39;t have a day-night cycle to go by, well, if Huinesoron&#39;s October &#39;14 lasts 24 days, and Kaitlyn&#39;s lasts 35, who&#39;s going to notice?<br><br>The only time it becomes properly synchronised down at the daily level is during Events and Emergencies. Since everyone can agree on when, say, the Mary-Sue Invasion of &#39;08 occurred in their own personal timelines, the Flowers can slap a date on it and say <i>Look, we have a proper, functioning dating system! What&#39;s that? What&#39;s <b>today&#39;s</b> date? Er... isn&#39;t that your console beeping?</i><br><br>Speaking of Emergencies... the way you&#39;re writing this seems to suggest that the moratorium is an actual, in-universe Thing. Since I&#39;m not sure what it would <i>be</i> (other than a stern warning to Not Do Anything Dramatic, Please), I&#39;m unclear as to how that would work.<br><br>Of course, all of this is irrelevant - what I really needed was the year 2015, which I now have.

            <p>Basically, Speakers&#39; Corner is the northwestern area of Hyde Park, near the Marble Arch. It&#39;s a place where everybody can take a stepladder, a chair, or whatever and start talking about whatever, and crowd heckles them (the good ones respond to the hecklers). Like everything else, the speakers are covered under Sturgeon&#39;s Law, which means 90% of them are rubbish, but even the rubbish ones can be amusing.<br>Two cases in point: there was this Muslim (probably Pakistani) guy with their weird head-covering and an honest-to-God Abayah who talked about the usual religious stuff; heckling him was a fat, bespectacled and thoroughly unpleasant Briton. As I&#39;ve said before - YouTube comments, but live and funnier.<br>The other case was a sort of Evangelist with a huge Bible in one hand; he spent his time shouting through a toothless Egyptian cabbie.<br>What left me impressed, however, were two guys I met in random. One was born in 1939 and remembers the German Blitz; talk about history (he also believes Jesus converted to Hinduism for some reason, but that&#39;s another thing). I met the second guy when I commented to nobody in particular that Abayah guy and his hecklers didn&#39;t know how to debate, and this guy agreed with me. Turns out he&#39;s from Kuwait, and the sweet part that when I told him I am from Israel, he didn&#39;t start spitting curses at me and in fact remained civil and polite. Makes me think there&#39;s hope for this place yet.</p>

            <p>There were two major types of Shabti. One type is where the figurine is part of a spell, in which case there&#39;s usually a cartouche with at least part of the incantation on it.

            <p>Boo.<br>I&#39;m back, sorta. I&#39;ll be popping in and out every few weeks or something.<br><br>Anyways, what are your opinions on &quot;Abridged Series&quot;?<br><br>For those that have no clue what I&#39;m talking about, an Abridged Series is a series of Youtube vids that use clips from the actual canon show, strung together with new (fan) voice actors going along a script written by what I will refer to as the Writer. (This is your author.)<br><br>The whole point of an Abridged Series is that every character in it is a replacement, EVERY SINGLE ONE, yet they usually follow a rough outline of the canon universe&#39;s plot.<br><br>An interesting example is &quot;My Little Pony: The (Abridged) Mentally Advanced Series&quot; by FiMFlamFilosophy. Here&#39;s a link to the MLP Fan Labor Wiki page for <a href="http://mlpfanart.wikia.com/wiki/The_Mentally_Advanced_Series">the series itself</a> and <a href="http://mlpfanart.wikia.com/wiki/The_Mentally_Advanced_Series/Characters"> its characters</a>, because as I said, every character is a replacement.<br><br>As for why it&#39;s interesting? You might have seen it in one of the two pages I linked, you might not have, but FiMFlamFilosophy (with the aid of artist Petirep as badfic don&#39;t have clips to redub) has created a spinoff of his own Abridged Series called &quot;Rainbow Dash Presents,&quot; essentially using the replacements from &quot;The Mentally Advanced Series&quot; to make an Abridged Series style sporking of badfic, including a self-spork of his own fic, &quot;A Beautiful Day in Equestria,&quot;- and he insists in the last part of the video that the video&#39;s ending is the &#39;canon&#39; ending to the fic. Here&#39;s a link to the <a href="http://mlpfanart.wikia.com/wiki/Rainbow_Dash_Presents">MLP Fan Labor Wiki page.</a><br><br>So are these Abridged Series bad or good?</p>

            <p>As the intro to every <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6EC7B047181AD013">DragonBall Z Abridged</a> episode helpfully explains, it and all the abridged series are fan-based parodies. The personalities of the characters are deliberately exaggerated to highlight their idiosyncrasies, flaws, plotholes in their canon, etc. Because that&#39;s what parodies do. For humor. (Close kin to what PPC missions do to badfics, in fact.) Calling them out for creating character replacements seems to be massively missing the point, IMO.<br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re all done as well as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TeamFourStar">Team Four Star&#39;s</a> stuff—the PPC has a Department of Bad Parody for a reason—but I&#39;d advise against tossing out the entire concept based on how you feel about just one or two of &#39;em.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Kinda. *thows cakefetti*<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m a big fan of Avatar: The Abridged Series. I think it&#39;s <i>mostly</i> because the characters are so wildly OOC that I find them funny, because it&#39;s not meant to be a serious representation of canon. To be fair, not all of them are good. Ones that rely on jokes involving male genitalia are usually the bad ones.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m really liking your missions.  They&#39;re extremely character-driven, without going into crazy, complex back-stories: it&#39;s just two gals talking to each other, doing their job and suffering together.<br><br>Another thing you&#39;re really good at is keeping track of details, instead of forgetting them down a plothole like the author did to that poor wolf.  I was actually hoping you feed the Sue to wolves at the beginning, because of that whole, &quot;my mom got eaten by wolves but I&#39;m totally okay with this one&quot; thing.  I&#39;m especially glad you let the actual CAF wolf be the one to do it, poor thing!  It must have been so hungry!  Uh, but I was saying, you did a great job not forgetting the melted tree gunk and the pain in Rina&#39;s fist from hitting another tree, but making them continue to affect the characters and their equipment over an appropriate time.  (Super empathy with the punching thing, &#39;cause I&#39;ve done my share of smacking hard, inanimate things when I get frustrated.)<br><br>Also, on behalf of some of my coworkers, thank you for that moment of rage at leaving a horse saddled overnight.  People don&#39;t realize how INCREDIBLY painful and sore it is for horses to be left saddled for extended periods.  Between the wolf and the horse, Alis was treating every animal she came across like a tool.  Ugh.<br><br>The scene with Rina&#39;s family at the end is interesting.  Different for sure, since we only see interaction with an agent&#39;s family once in a blue moon.  I admit, I found Mr. Dives&#39; reaction to be unrealistically mellow about the situation.  I know it&#39;s not his <i>initial</i> reaction, since he&#39;s been in HQ a while before we see him in Medical, but it still seems like he would be more defensive of his daughter.  (If Mr. Dives is based on a real personality, then I apologize for, uh.  Being completely wrong about the unrealistic thing.)  I do like the reactions of Mrs. Dives and Alex, though, and I love that the whole family seems to have some level of active fandom.  I&#39;m totally calling Alex becoming an agent eventually!<br><br>The one major error I noticed is that Randa is the one who initially suggests Rina can use Suebuprofen in lieu of Bleeprin, but for the rest of the story, they act like Rina is the one who said it, and Randa is the one to later say Rina can&#39;t use Suebuprofen due to her allergy.<br><br>And a little typo:<br>&quot;&#39;. . . the horse is named Nudge . . . and the wolf <b>if</b> Max?&#39;&quot;</p>

            <p>Glad to hear you liked the mission! You can congratulate Randa on coming up with the idea of feeding the Sue to her pet wolf. And I do agree, the poor thing must have been nearly dead. I almost adopted him, but the RC&#39;s already getting crowded enough what with the barking owl and mini-Aragog.<br><br>There&#39;s something just so... therapeutic about punching things. It&#39;s when they hit back that you start having problems. &gt;D As a matter of fact, when I read that she left the poor horse saddled overnight, I nearly punched my screen. YOU JUST DON&#39;T DO THAT. EVER. <br><br>*ahem*<br><br>Believe it or not, unless you wake my dad up when he&#39;s trying to get some sleep, he&#39;s actually that mellow. Between his relaxed attitude and my mom&#39;s uptight, Percy Weasley-ish approach, they balance each other out pretty nicely.<br><br>And Alex has already introduced himself on the Board as Kranlor, but he&#39;s not much of a writer. I think he secretly lurks on the Board and reads missions when I&#39;m not looking, because he mentions stuff like character replacements in casual conversation.<br><br>And thanks for pointing that stuff out- I&#39;ll take a look at it right away!</p>

            <p>You reveal that Rina has a bleach allergy - in a story which <i>has bleach in it</i> - and you didn&#39;t make use of that fact? Tsk, tsk. ;)<br><br>But no, that was fun.

            <p><b>Multiversal Intervention Agency, Take One</b><br><br>The Multiversal Intervention Agency had only two rules: first, no skiving off. And second, no building death rays.<br><br>The third rule was &#39;don&#39;t be lasagna&#39;, which had actually happened once, whereupon the rule had been tacked on. With actual tacks.<br><br>The Thyme Lord would have liked to think it ruled the MIA* with an iron fist, but as it lacked both fists and iron, it had to make do with tasty leaves instead. That is, the agents assumed they were tasty. No one had ever dared to find out.<br><br>(Once, an agent had attempted to determine whether the Thyme Lord was really made of thyme, or was simply a hologram. Of course, the agent attempted to find out by going up close to the Thyme Lord...and sniffing. Being Jewish, the agent first made the blessing of &#39;boreh minei b&#39;samim&#39;--&#39;Creator of fragrant grasses&#39;.)<br><br>(The Thyme Lord was in no way amused.)<br><br>The Sage, who ran the Department of Untangling, did its best never to be afraid of being put into a lasagna. Despite this, some fear did seep through, to the point where agents were forbidden to eat--or even chew--within two rooms-lengths. As MIA HQ had a tendency to transport its those who transversed it in both time and space, most agents elected to simply leave, eat, and then attempt to come back earlier.<br><br>(&#39;Attempt&#39; was the key term. It was hardly unknown for agents to get lost in time and emerge weeks, months, minutes, or years later. Agent Acacia had once switched places with some kid with the surname Illian; five Technicians had worked feverishly to fix this, and managed with some helpful prodding from Acacia&#39;s friend, the Thorn--well, Agent Thorntree, really, but only Acacia called her that.)<br><br>The Parsley Duke, who headed up the specialized Tea Cafeteria, greatly enjoyed eavesdropping. It (or, occasionally, he) most certainly did not relish the thought of one day being mistaken for tea leaves; fortunately, most agents tended to avoid trying to put giant stalks of parsley in their cups of boiling water, and simply talked instead.<br><br>&quot;Lady Rosemary wants to see me,&quot; one agent said mournfully. She sipped at her tea, and made a face. &quot;I did fine on my last mission, you know. No one regenerated. No Reapers turned up. I didn&#39;t even create any temporal paradoxes. Why&#39;s she want to see me?&quot;<br><br>The second agent (on xir fifth cup, the Parsley Duke noted approvingly) shrugged. &quot;Was it a Doctor/Master fic again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Ugh</i>,&quot; the first agent agreed. &quot;I don&#39;t remember what good slash <i>looks</i> like anymore, y&#39;know?&quot;<br><br>The second agent patted her hand sympathetically, and passed the tea leaves.<br><br>(At that point, the entirety of the Continuity Council of Gallifrey-in-Exile blew into the Tea Cafeteria, and the Parsley Duke was understandably distracted. That group drank a <i>lot</i> of tea, and in very odd combinations, to boot.)<br><br>&quot;Cranberry-Cinnamon for the Notary,&quot; Morgan began. &quot;Vanilla-Maple-Grass for Fish, the Reader&#39;ll have something orange with a dash of whiskey, Dis and the Agent can order for themselves, thanks, and I want the strongest black tea you&#39;ve got in stock. Oh, and that stuff that smells like dust for the Librarian.&quot; With that done, everyone but the Disentangler and the Agent left to find tables, arguing all the way.<br><br>&quot;Lemon Zinger for him, Blueberry Whateveritis for me,&quot; the Disentangler said, and dragged the Agent away from the counter.<br><br>This left the Parsley Duke to organize beverages, while keeping a wary eye on the Council of Time Lords...<br><br>--<br>*The <i>MIA</i>? hS, did you do that on purpose, or was it a happy accident?<br><br>------<br>And there I&#39;m ending this, because it&#39;s getting long and I have no clue where it&#39;s really going after this. Well, apart from a Continuity Council conversation, but I think this is enough for one post, don&#39;t you?<br><br>(So, how&#39;s the AU that no one asked me to write? Talk about &#39;look what you&#39;ve done&#39;--I don&#39;t even remember why I clicked on this post to begin with, apart from possibly finding out what the missed opportunity was. I haven&#39;t even read the mission yet.)<br><br>(I&#39;m curious, though...)<br><br>Well. Hope someone enjoyed. The bit about the Thyme Lord-sniffing agent is courtesy of a friend, who suggested it.<br><br>May we all have very good cups of tea. Yum!<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Morgan took a swig of her black tea - it actually seemed to have edged into vantablack territory - and grimaced. &quot;Yep, still vile.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then why are you drinking it?&quot; the Reader asked.<br><br>&quot;It keeps me alert and grumpy,&quot; Morgan said. &quot;Now then, people - thoughts?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still do not trust this place,&quot; the Notary said, and sipped her own concoction. &quot;Ahhh. Though I must note yet again that they make truly excellent tea.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Don&#39;t trust?&#39;&quot; The Disentangler scoffed. &quot;Wasn&#39;t it <i>your</i> TARDIS that brought us here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Correction,&quot; the Notary replied in the tone of one who had said the same thing many times before (though she pretty much always talked like that), &quot;it was my TARDIS that brought us here <i>the first time</i>. Which, a) did not require you to pick up your own and &#39;suggest&#39; a return trip, and b) would not have happened at all were a certain Ruby Shipwright doing his job.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh? Me? What?&quot; The Fisherman turned a glare on his Vanilla-Maple-Grass tea. &quot;That&#39;s what happens when I let myself get distracted by you,&quot; he accused it. &quot;What&#39;ve I done?&quot;<br><br>&quot;According to our precise colleague here, not your job,&quot; the Librarian supplied. &quot;Though I remain unconvinced that fixing her TARDIS falls under your position.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, that old wreck?&quot; The Fisherman shook his head firmly. &quot;Nah, I&#39;m responsible for <i>HQ&#39;s</i> TARDISes, not blockade runners stolen from the Time War.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I did <i>not</i> steal it,&quot; the Notary growled. &quot;I simply-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Borrowed it without the intent to return?&quot; the Agent chimed in.<br><br>&quot;Quiet, renegade.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have to admit I have some concerns about this place as well,&quot; the Librarian cut in, draining the last of his tea. &quot;Professionally speaking, I mean.&quot;<br><br>Morgan frowned. &quot;Does it really fall under the Jade Warden&#39;s responsibility?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t see who <i>else</i> would take it,&quot; the Reader pointed out. &quot;It&#39;s not a TARDIS problem-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I dunno,&quot; the Fisherman muttered, &quot;some of these temporal effects, their whole HQ might well be a TARDIS.&quot;<br><br>&quot;- it&#39;s certainly not a theoretical issue,&quot; the Reader went on, not missing a beat. &quot;It&#39;s not something I should be monitoring, it doesn&#39;t come from TV or other media canon, and I&#39;m <i>pretty</i> sure it doesn&#39;t need the attentions of Rassilon&#39;s Advocate there. So what does that leave?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It could be a security issue,&quot; Morgan suggested in a low voice, one hand stroking the grip of her gun.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s <i>not</i>,&quot; the Reader countered. &quot;It&#39;s a fake PPC filled with Time Lords.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s still <i>no</i> evidence of that,&quot; the Disentangler pointed out. &quot;You three have been going on about &#39;oh, they&#39;re all Time Lords here, isn&#39;t it amazing-slash-terrifying&#39;, but have we seen anyone regenerating? Have we performed open-heart surgery to check? Can we <i>feel</i> them?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not being able to sense them fits entirely within the theory that we have entered an alternate multiverse-&quot; the Notary began, only to be cut off by the Disentangler.<br><br>&quot;Sorry, was someone talking? I must have been ignoring them.&quot; She took one last gulp from her cup and set it down firmly. &quot;Anyway, there&#39;s one thing we can <i>all</i> agree on, with the possible exception of Grumpy In Orange: whoever they are, they make <i>fantastic</i> tea.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hear, hear,&quot; the Agent said, getting to his feet. &quot;Want another one?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Would blow up a star for one. Same again, please.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>In my defence, you never <i>said</i> it wasn&#39;t our Continuity Council on a multiversal excursion. Also they&#39;re really fun to write. <sup>-<sup><br><br><hr></sup></sup>
<br><br>More generally: oh, all of my yes. :D This was great fun to read, and fell neatly the right side of ridiculous. The idea of all the Flowers being herbs is, uh, weird but hilarious.<br><br>And no, I&#39;m afraid &#39;MIA&#39; was entirely accidental. I&#39;d love to claim credit, but I can&#39;t. :(<br><br>(Also: I love the idea of &#39;the Thorn&#39;. Though, which Illian kid were you thinking of...?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><b>Neshomeh&#39;s Tea Cafeteria</b><br><br>&quot;Seriously, do <i>any</i> of you know where this came from?&quot; Agent Edgar crossed his arms, trying to spot a <s>guilty</s> knowledgeable face. &quot;Anyone?&quot;<br><br>Agent Desdendelle shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s a Tea Cafeteria. Does anyone really care where it came from?&quot;<br><br>&quot;But it wasn&#39;t here before,&quot; Agent Agen_<strong><em>t put in.

It would be you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Neshomeh!&quot; Des&#39; greeting was more animated. &quot;How&#39;d you get in?&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh shrugged. &quot;I read the sign.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What sign?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh--&quot; The Archivist disappeared behind the door, and was presumably the source of the rummaging noises that followed. Soon after, she reappeared. &quot;Here. It fell down, so I brought it in, but it was still up when I got here.&quot;<br><br>She held up a sign (more of a placard, really, made of heavy wood and with traces of sticky tack* on the back), and the other agents gathered round to read it.<br><br><i>This is Neshomeh&#39;s Tea Cafeteria</i>, went the words. <i>Prepare to drink, all ye who enter here!</i><br><br>There was a tiny <small><i>Arrr!</i></small> in the bottom right-hand corner, just in case anyone had missed the linguistic resemblance to a treasure map.<br><br>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Desdendelle. &quot;So this is yours, then.&quot; He seemed a little disappointed.<br><br>Neshomeh nodded, grinning. &quot;Yes!

            <p>(&quot;Continua&quot; is a plural noun, &quot;continuum&quot; is the singular. Just FYI)<br><br>Well done, Iximaz! That sequence with Rina&#39;s family at the end was very emotional. I&#39;m not sure how I should feel about her mom&#39;s epic freakout; it&#39;s totally justified, of course, but the fact that it&#39;s just her mom freaking out while her dad and brother are calmer about this...yeah, that has some weird implications. (At least if you&#39;re like me and overthink these things.) Also, unless I&#39;m missing some detail, she would more than likely have been in the room for Randa&#39;s infodump.<br><br>Another little detail I noticed was Rina and Randa&#39;s evaporating CAD. I liked that! Usually they BSOD, overheat and melt, or explode; somehow, the idea of a machine evaporating is funnier. (Good luck to whichever DoSAT guy/girl/starfish has to clean the tree goo off the RA, though...) Their banter/snark was good, too; relevant and witty without dissolving (too often) into CAPSLOCK OF RAGE.<br><br>This was an enjoyable read, even for someone who doesn&#39;t know Ranger&#39;s Apprentice (yet). *gives box of chocolate Klondike bars* Keep up the good work!</p>

            <p>*blushie face* <br><br>You can probably tell, but I drew on past experiences to write the bit at the end. My mom is, believe it or not, extremely grounded in reality and needs solid proof of anything before she believes it. She&#39;s also extremely strict with me when it comes to rules. Admittedly, I was upset with her when I first wrote the scene, but ended up scrapping the original and redoing it. <br><br>(And, when I asked her what she&#39;d do if she found out I was working for an organization where psychic plants were in charge and my job was to go out and hunt universe-warping people, she looked at me and said she&#39;d ground me forever. Completely poker-faced. I still can&#39;t tell if she was messing with me or not.)<br><br>I&#39;d never seen a CAD evaporate either- I&#39;m glad you found the idea as funny as I did! I can&#39;t tell you just how insanely OOC it is for Halt to laugh- it takes a lot for him to give you a genuine smile, and I can count on one hand the number of times that happened over twelve books.<br><br>I&#39;ve got the next mission finished, due to the fact that the offending fic was only two chapters in length, but there won&#39;t be any mention of the poor sap who gets to deal with the gunk until mission five, which is already started. I&#39;ll probably post it sometime next week.</p>

            <p>Getting to the top of the list is really impressive. The amount of praise the wiki got was also pretty impressive too.<br><br>P.S.: reading the blog post while listening to &quot;Dream of Butterfly&quot; was just awesome<br><br>But this begs the question:if we get too much publicity, how will the internet communities that write badfic react?</p>

            <p>Glad to see some publicity! I always find it hard to explain exactly what the PPC is whenever someone asks, so perhaps just saying &quot;Look up the Wiki for it&quot; might be a good idea.</p>

            <p>I guess that sort of reaction explains the huge number of people who show up here saying &#39;I found the wiki, and months later I found the Board...&#39;.

            <p>For those of you who have been following my Bakugan/Pokйmon crossover <i>The Vexos Chronicles</i>, I&#39;ve recently posted <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9697398/1/The-Vexos-Chronicles-Part-I-Lost-Luster">Chapter 14</a> of my fic yesterday.<br><br>For the benefit of any newbies that might be interested in my fic, here is the link to Chapter 1: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9697398/1/The-Vexos-Chronicles-Part-I-Lost-Luster"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9697398/1/The-Vexos-Chronicles-Part-I-Lost-Luster">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9697398/1/The-Vexos-Chronicles-Part-I-Lost-Luster</a></a><br><br>At this point, I will be going on a short hiatus from posting chapters since, after some consultation with my betas, I have concluded that a rewrite of at least the early chapters would be in order. As before, any concrit would be definitely appreciated, especially if you&#39;re a Boarder that&#39;s a fan of only one of the crossed-over fandoms.</p>
