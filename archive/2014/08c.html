            <p>In the runup to the annual Games of Batveg, it has become clear that many of the Citizens and Knights of the Union of Plort have not received their customary honours. Their names are not listed in Baron Huinesoron’s Cyclopaedia; their coats of arms go unblazoned; their histories are unknown to even those closest to them. Clearly, this cannot go on.<br><br>Or, in other words:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/UnionPlortFlag.png"><br><br>Welcome back to Konti-Nyuum.<br><br>The Protectorate of Plort, Konti-Nyuum, is not a PPC AU. Nor is it quite a PPC Writers AU, though <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gdv7Jmp1z3utpLVP7pff4ptX1Itya6nZhsRfsqVXEZ0/pub">I have one of those too</a>. Rather, it’s a PPC <i>Community</i> AU - an answer to a question that was never asked:<br><br><b>What if the PPC Community was a medieval nation?</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Konti-NyuumRoadsLarge.png"><br><br>So here we are. The island of Konti-Nyuum lies to the north of the great continent of Weab. On this cliff-walled rock the noble knights Jay and Acacia made their home, building the Protectorate of Plort, and those who came after them have carried the Protectorate through its trials and troubles to the current Union of Plort. The Knights of Plort sally ever forth against the hosts of the Marizu, seeking to defend the far-off nations of the Scholars’ Empire from their scourge. For the full history of Plort, I direct you to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFoRXDPMJ2HKR_HfxDl4ihYPNN1qvnjAj3fFVPWSb3c/pub">Baron Huinesoron’s Cyclopaedia</a>.<br><br>So what’s in it for you? Well, each and every member of the PPC Community is also a resident of Plort. Volume 6 of the Cyclopaedia lists the histories and descriptions of those of us who’ve given them - and if you’re not in there, why not join in and give one? It’s quite simple to do:<br><br>-There are only three ‘ranks’ in Plort. All Permission Givers are Barons. Anyone with Permission is a Knight. Everyone else is a Citizen. These ranks don’t impart social standing - they’re relevant only to the crusades against the Marizu. Barons are war-leaders, and knights are permitted to ride against the Marizu; Citizens shouldn’t do so (but that’s ‘shouldn’t, not ‘never do’).<br><br>-Everyone can have their own pair of heraldic devices, according to Plort’s two systems as described <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CRwK0B70gWO0lJ_TgeiyTEF_l6A6_yyQ2BgH9ATKL6w/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. If you can describe your device/s, either formally as described there or just vaguely, I’ll (try to) make it for you.<br><br>-Make sure to choose which of the four nations of the Union you live in, and indeed where in it; there’s nothing wrong with adding small towns and villages wherever you please, or you can live in the cities. Up to you!<br><br>-Most of the nations on Weab are hopefully self-explanatory parodies of various websites. Bear in mind that canons are in the Scholars’ Empire, while their fandoms are on Weab (and mostly under the dominion of the Marizu).<br><br>-PPC Agents are cast as a knight’s weapons, armour, horse, whatever, not as people. Departments are ships, such as the <i>Aberration</i> (DOGA). OFUs are armies out of the great military camp of Ofum.<br><br>-... and read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XFoRXDPMJ2HKR_HfxDl4ihYPNN1qvnjAj3fFVPWSb3c/pub">Cyclopaedia</a>! The various parts of Plort, the foreign nations, the scene-setting stuff, and local and foreign characters are all in there. You’re free to make use of them.<br><br>And of course, this thread isn’t limited to bios and heraldry. Anything goes! Three of Plort’s nations lack national anthems, two lack flags, half the geographical features are unnamed (and if anyone wants to map the Marizu lands, I’ll be suitably impressed)… there’s only one narrative of an actual ‘mission’ (the slaying of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CB_gM7NpwNguAB9G6g_yvKE22Z8gQjMSIvo_eXp6I3k/pub">Amariel</a> by then-Knight Huinesoron and Knight Raven)... there will be a Baronial Council going on, which is open for in-character comments by all and sundry; any other RP-subthread-activity is good, too! There are inns in the cities (though the only one named is in Iric), and… basically, use your imaginations. ;) You’re good at that.<br><br><s>hS</s> Baron Huinesoron of Plort, Protector of Ozerbord, Custodian of Fanvik-Whirl, Marshal of the Order of Udisc, Scourge of the Marizu, Friend of Medellurth, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve added a flag for Borrd, based pretty heavily on the flag of the old Protectorate, to Volume 1. I&#39;ve also taken the opportunity to upgrade Kaitlyn&#39;s and my heraldry, because the art made me cringe.<br><br>The only other thing I&#39;ll be doing - and might have already done, by the time you read this - is sneaking in &#39;heraldry-of-use&#39; for the barons who don&#39;t have it yet. They&#39;ll be simple, a single charge on a plain field, and exist in-universe as Baron Huinesoron&#39;s efforts to fill out his map without having to actually <i>ask</i> anyone what their devices are (since that would involve going closer to Iric, which, no).<br><br>Oh, and trying to build Konti-Nyuum in Minecraft.

            <p>... Volume 4 of the Cyclopaedia has been updated with a complete map of Weab, though obviously with lots of empty spaces for future countries. The Are-Pea Alliance is now in existence, as is the Wechi-Ah, Blawg, and the So Shall Medea movement (at war with Blawg, naturally). And, of course, the Marizu League is represented...<br><br>As far as I can tell, all journeys describes in people&#39;s stories still work.

            <p>My plan for if I enlarge the map to encompass the North-East Continent, is to add a bunch of islands to the far north which represent real-world places and entities. Nusantara is up there, and possibly even the mythical Arell itself. The reason I <i>haven&#39;t</i> put them in is that Arell is mythical, Nusantara is implied to be in another world (and tropical besides), and Ydyff is both &#39;in the far north&#39; and close enough for Thanasius to sail to &#39;every few months&#39;, in a medieval setting.

            <p>I&#39;ve added the rest of the known Marizu League, and thrown in arrows for the Mistwall (and Ydyff), and the debated North-West Continent. Before I can expand any further, I need to pin the scale down - and the best way to do that will be through my own story of the death of Amariel. Four days in Fixionarly pins an upper limit on things, since the best they can have done is walk in a straight line. Four days lost there plus one on the mission itself leaves nine daysof their available fortnight on the journey there plus a hypothetical journey back. That must come out as 2 x wastelands + skirting the forest, for a total of, roughly, 110 x 2 + 90 = 310 px in nine days.<br><br>Tackling the first approach first: human walking speed is around 3mph. Assuming a 10-hour day, four days of walking would be 120 miles. The line we followed through Fixionarly is around 77 pixels, which would make the scale 1.5 miles/pixel. Konti-Nyuum would be around 110 miles long, or roughly the size of Wales.<br><br>So that&#39;s our largest possible scale. What about that ride? Well, A horse&#39;s walking speed is apparently 4mph, and we know we&#39;re looking at 310 px in 9 days. Can you ride for 12 hours a day? If so, we&#39;re looking at 432 miles to 310 px, or roughly 1.4 m/px. Alternately, if we stick to 10-hour days (to allow for difficulties, maybe), we&#39;re down at 360 miles, and 1.15 m/px. Konti-Nyuum comes out at 85 miles long; broadly the same size as Cyprus, the West Bank, or Long Island. Still longer than the main island of Hawaii, though.<br><br>By that scale, Weab is some 1700 miles wide - some two thirds the size of Australia. I guess that explains why it&#39;s all in the same climate! It also, helpfully, means the scale is roughly the same across the entire map; no need to worry about the projection. Much more expansion, though, and it <i>will</i> need grid-lines.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>[[Note: I am redoing this so I can give more detail on An&#39;onere and completely redo his coat of arms.]]<br><br>An&#39;onere Morysse began his journey in the land of Vidya Gaym, where he was a resident of Sonikh de&#39;Hedgehog. When he found the dark road of Creipipastar Wichen, he followed it, leading him to the land of Pokhemmon. Here, he obtained a large blank spellbook, <i>Cheesy</i>, and began to fill it with spells borne of the ancient arts of Pro&#39;gramman (which he taught himself) and Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl (which was taught to him by a master). He continued to follow the road, but was attacked by the Marizu leader Pinkamena.<br><br>Luckily, a group of nomads known as the Bronee saved him, and led him through the land of Yu&#39;Tub to the land of Tivit. During this journey, he became one of them, familiar with thier ways, and obtained a gray stallion from them, which he named <i>Mental Haze</i>. He also became obsessed in his travels with the Marizu, trying to make sense of thier dark magic, trying to figure out why one would commit acts so foul, and how they could be stopped.<br><br>It was in Tivit that he first found a glimmer of an answer, while looking in thier great libraries for information on the Marizu leader that had first attacked him on the dark road. There, he found a note telling of the defeat of Pinkamena, by the great nation of Plort. Barely skimming through thier selection of books on Plort (and a good thing, it turns out, for they were filled with lies), An&#39;onere the Mage left his band of Bronees and bought passage to the island of Konti-Nyuum on board a trading ship.<br><br>When he landed in Wechi, he spoke to nobody, simply browsing thier great libraries for information on the Marizu- and soon, the Knights of Plort. Eventually, he made himself known, but behind a mask. He called himself Po&#39;kere Trikense, and brandished a bow, <i>Shocker</i>, and a quiver of arrows, its name lost to history- both having been recently bought.<br><br>He soon decided that he was not ready to fight, and discarded his bow and arrows, noting to himself that either way, he was unskilled in thier use. He rejoined his Bronee friends, and became skilled in the art of Arpying when they led him to a nation known as Chatt-zei, filled with many upstart towns, some merely temporary collections of huts, others great and regal cities, all of them built in mere moments with ancient magic. After a stay in one such great city, he left, bringing with him many of his Bronee friends, and built a new town with the magic of the land of Chatt-zei, with himself as leader. There, he and his friends practiced the ancient martial art of Arpying.<br><br>However, he found that one of his closest friends had succumbed to the ancient arts of the Marizu, and using dark rituals, had begun to create his own. He fought valiantly, but to no avail, and finally, he left his city as it succumbed to the pla&#39;tool magic of the Marizu.<br><br>After this, he journeyed back to Konti-Nyuum, reintroducing himself under his true identity, and preparing himself to begin the trial of Permission.<br><br>His true coat of arms is <i>Argent, between a crescent sable and pentacle sable, a bend sable with the roman numeral XIII bendwise vert.</i><br>His motto, <i>&quot;Astra cum luna tredecim,&quot;</i> &quot;Thirteen stars rise with the moon.&quot;</p>

            <p>This is amazing.<br><br>Also, just a nitpick that has no impact and has a 9/10 chance of not being seen, crescents in heraldry are usually points up. (Then again, this is supposed to be symbolic of a moon, so I prefer this anyways.)</p>

Wichen road represents the Creepypasta Wiki, which used to contain a lot of grimdark MLP fanfics as well as creepypasta. Recently, they seem to have tossed out most of these fics, making it considerably harder to find certain fics like &quot;Trixie&#39;s Funhouse&quot; (think Sweet Apple Massacre with a Trixie replacement instead of a Big Mac replacement, and a replacement of Sweetie Belle that doesn&#39;t actually replace her until a few paragraphs in,) although they still have Cupcakes.<br><br>I imagine a trade route connecting various Marizu Alliance nations with wiki nations like Tivit, whose Marizu portions had been considerably destroyed, possibly by Plort forces. It should still have a link to Pokhemmon.<br><br>As for Chatt-zei, it represents the chatroom hosting site Chatzy, and probably would be in the Are-Pea Alliance because of the high number of RP chatrooms.</p>

            <p>With parts of it still slightly darker, it actually looks more like a Siamese cat, which is apparently what the artist was sketching, and therefore also more like my cat, who is a Tonkinese. His actual color is sort of impossible to describe, though, and wouldn&#39;t look very good on a shield anyway.

            <p>Or: Oh, Sorry, I Didn&#39;t Know It Was You When I Shot You.<br><br>The thing to remember about heraldry is that it was originally a battlefield safety mechanism. Much like, say, football players wearing their team colours, your shield identified you - either personally, or as part of a group. In Scotland, the same thing was accomplished using the various tartans - you stab the guys who aren&#39;t wearing the same one as you.<br><br>So if you&#39;re hoping to be identified in half a second by some guy swinging a sword at you, you <i>don&#39;t</i> want an insanely complex device. Originally, I believe the <i>only</i> charges were the ordinaries - the basic geometric shapes like the chevron or the cross, covering the whole shield. &#39;Hey, red cross on a white shield - better not stab him, that&#39;s George!&#39; Nice and simple.<br><br>But more and more knights started using shields, and as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrope_v._Grosvenor">an infamous 14th century case</a> shows, the simple arrangements began to be repeated. Uh-oh! What if you were fighting alongside George, but against Henry - and both used the shield <i>Argent, a cross gules</i>? You wouldn&#39;t know who to stab! And so - or in some similar manner - began the use of <i>charges</i> - animals, symbols, and other devices to further differentiate the shields.<br><br>And then heraldry moved away from the battlefield and into the realms of hereditary pride, and it got a bit ridiculous. Nesh has already pointed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stowe_Armorial.jpg">the 719-fold quartering</a> of the Stowe Armorial. That would be <i>worse</i> than useless on the field! But it neatly lays out all the families represented, and so serves its purpose.<br><br>So how complex should a device be? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazon">Wikipedian examples</a> show that they tend to be fairly simple. A single charge is common, or occasionally identical charges either side of an ordinary. The fact that they are then often quartered makes them <i>look</i> more complex - but only in the same way that a dozen Mary-Sues make a story <i>look</i> better written than just one, by sheer quantity. Each individual device remains quite simple.<br><br>It&#39;s different, of course, for Elvish heraldry. Elvish visual acuity was <a href="http://greenbooks.theonering.net/guest/files/081503_02.html">ludicrously sharp</a>, and if you can detect the motion of Mars against the starfield in under ten minutes, you&#39;re not going to have much trouble making out a complex pattern. Add to that the fact that the Enemy didn&#39;t really use heraldry - Morgoth&#39;s shield would simply be blazoned <i>Sable</i> in English - and you&#39;re fairly safe designing your devices to <i>look</i> nice, far more so than in English heraldry.<br><br>So what about in Plort? Well - they use Elvish devices, which implies they can make them out. It may be that the Marizu don&#39;t use heraldry at all (or have an irrepressible urge to make everything urple), and thus it doesn&#39;t <i>really</i> matter that much. Add in the fact that most war parties are only one or two knights, and that the devices are assuredly used for decoration, and you find the situation we&#39;ve got - heraldry designed more to be eye-pleasing (and punny), rather than strictly distinguishable.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There are some pretty eye-bending examples of heraldry on Wikipedia.

I forgot one of the details I wanted when it came to writing up the description. <br><br>I had meant to have a large(ish) shamrock in the very centre, slightly spilling out over the bend gules, which would have probably resulted in the sword and quill being slightly smaller/further away. <br><br>I&#39;m guessing that the text for that would be something along the lines of &#39;Sable, between a quill bendwise Or and a sword bendwise argent, a bend gules with shamrock vert&#39;.

Well, for one, there&#39;s a tradition of that in Plort.

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/BorrdLarge.png"><br><br>In the Protectorate of Borrd, I&#39;ve finally decided to name those rivers. Phobos established something of a theme, with Grammar + Punctuation = Good Writing; I&#39;ve tried to continue that. From the mountains to the sea, we have:<br><br>Karaktar (Character) + Chekin (&#39;checking&#39; - ie, research) =&gt; Plaht (plot); Plaht + Lhawjeck (Logic; this one wasn&#39;t mine) =&gt; Staurilyn (story line); Staurilyn + Gudryting =&gt; Gotfik (goodfic)<br><br>It&#39;s not a perfect map of &#39;how to write goodfic&#39; - but it&#39;s pretty decent for what it is, I think.<br><br>The map also shows the Pass of the Five, the main (or only) pass from Borrd to Ozerbord.

            <p>Since you said none of the features in Iric have been named yet I thought I&#39;d have a stab while this thread is still on the front page. Also randomly throwing together a few entries for stuff outside Plort just to flesh the world out a little.<br><br>Bravneit Mountains - Mountain range, Republic of Iric. These mountains have been referred to as the &quot;Spine of Iric&quot;, enclosing the riverlands where the Republic&#39;s capital can be found. The range stretches southwest from Iric&#39;s northeasternmost peninsula to the edge of the Kar-eer Forest, as well as branching southeast between these two points - where the mountains branch at the beginning of the Kar-eer Forest marks the border between the baronies of Dann and Makari. Many of the rivers that flow through Iric find their source somewhere in this range.<br><br>Meibot - River, Republic of Iric. One of the nation&#39;s longest rivers, the Meibot flows all the way to Tumblar and the sea, forming part of the border between Iric and Borrd. A bridge has been built to cross the river, where the Godreve and Pankae Roads meet.<br><br>Sozeri - River, Republic of Iric. Arguably the longest river in Iric, the Sozeri flows south through the entire Kar-eer Forest and into the sea, joined by its tributary the Bhot at Castle Tegnoh.<br><br>Nechsiv - River, Republic of Iric. A raging river that forms part of La Wunj&#39;s natural defences, along with the Bravneit Mountains; the castle Corro stands on the opposite side of the river from Iric&#39;s capital. <br><br>Sovet - Nation, Weab. Not far west of Are-Pea, Sovet is a militaristic nation whose people enjoy feats of martial skill and weaving song or story in equal measure. Ritualised (or not so ritualised, for criminals or prisoners of war) gladiatorial contests are a favourite pastime in Sovet, with winners or combatants often determined by the drawing of lots, and it is said the typical man or woman of Sovet is equally talented with sword, harp and pen.<br><br>Pedox - City, Vidya Gaym. It is a city whose people love the art of strategy, and many famous colleges of war have their campuses here. Pedox-trained strategists are highly sought after in many of the courts of Weab.<br><br>Wichs - Mountain range, Tivit. These mountains divide the kingdom in half, forking east and west at the northernmost tip of the nation and extending southwards well into the forests of Yu&#39;Tub. The range hosts an assortment of mines and fortresses along its length, essential to Tivit&#39;s economy and national defence.<br><br>Stet-Rorhip - City (destroyed), Tivit. One of a pair of cities along Tivit&#39;s eastern coast known as havens of depravity, this port city was a centre of trade and a destination for travellers until the first battle between Tivit and Somath-Aful, after which the victorious imperial fleet sailed to Stet-Rorhip and put the entire city to the torch, looting anything that was not destroyed. Logistics and an administrative edict prevented a full invasion of Tivit, but King Edward has never ordered the city&#39;s reconstruction, leaving the great ruins to overlook the kingdom&#39;s eastern bay.<br><br>Feishfulet - City (destroyed), Tivit. A city on Tivit&#39;s eastern coast known as a den of vice and immorality, greater even than Stet-Rorhip. Edward the Swift&#39;s growing paranoia and Tivit&#39;s many defeats at the hands of Somath-Aful eventually provoked a rebellion against the king, and Feishfulet was sacked by a loyalist army during the fighting. The city was ordered torn down, its materials used to construct a new settlement further up the coast; while some have applauded Edward&#39;s actions in quashing a source of lawlessness in the kingdom, others have named him a butcher of his own people.<br><br>Rychert, Emperor - Noble, Emperor of Somath-Aful. Emperor Rychert is known for his lenient tax policies, strange sense of humour and prowess in battle, for which he was once feared across the lands of Weab; many remember when his wrath meant the death of entire nations, and dread the sight of his banners approaching on the horizon. His lands are now orderly and peaceful for the most part, and he has become somewhat aloof as a ruler, leaving many of the day to day tasks of governance to a corps of administrators chosen from his ablest citizens. These men and women are granted the right to enforce the laws of the land and issue edicts in the name of Rychert himself; none in the empire would dare defy such a command, but the emperor watches these administrators carefully for any signs of corruption or incompetence, swiftly removing those who abuse their powers or fail to perform their duties. Though the empire appears at times to run itself, Rychert&#39;s subjects know that in the end, nothing escapes his notice.</p>

            <p>Just from where I described its span, Medyantur is right there. Flayme I wasn&#39;t so sure about though, which is why I didn&#39;t name that one - much like I wasn&#39;t sure whether to bother naming the tributaries of the Nechsiv or the second river that goes past the southern part of La Wunj. I might throw something together later, I just wanted to get some of the map laid down before this thread got off the page - hope it&#39;s been helpful. Might have a stab at a short story later too.<br><br>(And yeah, I wasn&#39;t sure if the southern mountains would count as another range or not. Went off the fact the Larninkurvs keep the same name throughout their span.)</p>

            <p>Medyantur is between two rivers, one of which is the continuation of the drawn line of the Meibot - but the river from Flayme joins a little further down. Either interpretation fits the &#39;one of the longest&#39; descriptions, so it&#39;s an open question. And that&#39;s fine - we don&#39;t need <i>all</i> of the geography, after all!<br><br>As for the Larninkurvs, they do run the width of the island - but in a single line. Except for the side-chains east of Borrd and south of Ngort, every branch away from the main line has its own name. The Larninkurvs run from Arkive to the promontory north of Borrd in a single line.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;d assumed the river near Flayme wasn&#39;t the main body of the Meibot, since it originates in what is now Borrd, but who knows. This could be something in-universe cartographers argue about. :P I&#39;ll come up with some other names for stuff later.<br><br>(Also, for national anthems, I get the vibe that Iric&#39;s would be something based off &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; but I&#39;m not the best at adapting lyrics. Part of that is admittedly running with how you&#39;ve said it&#39;s probably analogous to Ireland, as well as its genesis from a revolt against Borrd and the revival of a dead kingdom.)</p>

            <p>Ydyff, Kingdom of – Nation, island. Under constant martial law due to the threat of otherworldly beings called Te-roreest. The Ydyffan army and population are one and the same, as every man and woman constantly fight the Te-roreest threat. Ydyff lies in the cold north, where the sky and land are close, and its warrior-poets are renowned there. The land itself, while small and cold, is surprisingly fertile, and inhabitants gather three times each year to celebrate their ancestral holidays: of the Huts, of the Sacrifice, and of the Harvest.<br>Curiously, its language is written from the other side, causing some confusion.<br>Arms: azure, between two olive branches argent, a Menorah argent.<br>Agog, Monastery of – one of Tivit&#39;s oldest surviving monasteries. Founded by the mystical Lokomn – who has, in a similar fashion to Plort, ceded his authority to a triumvirate – it is home to one of Tivit&#39;s most respected schools of Arpying. A surprisingly-large community sprang around its walls, thanks in part to the fact that its current rulers – the Flanking One, the Troy-knight and the Stratofar – have, aside from the support of one of Edward the Swift&#39;s more agreeable mages, a considerable degree of autonomy, and they conduct their business as they please. <br>Arms: ner black, rena yellow; canta nastar alta tera, interwoven gold, red and green lines tapering to a point; indil in fore, a white, four-petalled flower.</p>

            <p>I really like Agog&#39;s shield. Really-really like it. IRL, AGoG stands for &#39;A Game of Gods&#39;; it is one of the longest-running crossover RPs over there at TvTropes.

            <p>Most of these I recognise, so where applicable I&#39;ll fill &#39;em in, and put some additional commentary in parenthetical notes!<br><br>Fafka - Fanfiction Canon Assistry (this is one of those PPC ripoffs from a while back; Plopos is the other one)<br><br>Plopos - Plot Protection Society (see the commentary on Fafka)<br><br>En-Sain-Jawno - Insanejournal<br><br>Feishfulet - Fetish Fuel (this was a super creepy section of TV Tropes where tropers read sexual content into <i>everything</i>, even children&#39;s programming. It was removed when Google pulled TVT&#39;s ad money, but got put on an offsite wiki I can link if people are curious enough. The sacking of Feishfulet was taking into account some other stuff going on around the same time, and seemed like the closest approximation.)<br><br>Stet-Rorhip - Troper Tales (the name is actually an anagram of &quot;This Troper&quot;, after the phrase and the video series that points out a lot of the stupid/creepy/overall bad stuff that used to be in this section, found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CrazyGoggs"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CrazyGoggs">https://www.youtube.com/user/CrazyGoggs</a></a>. A series of events a few years back led to Troper Tales being taken off the site because it was seriously damaging TVT&#39;s reputation; part of this involved threads on Something Awful dedicated to mocking TVT and pointing out its shortcomings as a site and community. The first of these ended in a bunch of members going over to TVT and trying to get them to get rid of that section, if I recall, which is the inspiration for the imperial fleet sailing to Stet-Rorhip and burning it down. This got the thread closed by SA staff, which is why Somath-Aful&#39;s fleet was stopped by an imperial edict from back home. The &quot;five great battles&quot; between Tivit and Somath-Aful are basically the five threads and TVT staff&#39;s reaction to them; Edward the Swift&#39;s descent into paranoia and hatred of everything to do with Somath Aful is basically how Fast Eddie actually responded; he would straight up ban members and vandalise their pages if he suspected them of being members of SA. The rebellion that destroyed Feishfulet is also a semi-real event that happened around this time; without SA doing a thing aside from observing, a sizable chunk of TVT members straight up revolted. Like Fetish Fuel, it got put on an offsite wiki, which I can link if people want.)<br><br>Pedox - Paradox Interactive (a game studio that puts out grand strategy titles. Their most famous are the Europa Univeralis and Crusader Kings series - fun fact, I&#39;m on the dev team for a Crusader Kings II mod that recently got featured on PC Gamer!)<br><br>Wichs - Wicks (&quot;wicks&quot; on TV Tropes are the number of times a page is linked on other pages. Our page, for example, has 455 wicks - 261 in the current namespace, 194 for Main/Protectors of the Plot Continuum, meaning the PPC is linked on 455 articles. I&#39;ve seen wicks referred to as the lifeblood of the wiki, which is why the Wichs mountains are essential for Tivit&#39;s economy and national defence.)<br><br>Wugwah - Why, God, Why? (this is the successor site of GAFF, after Lolita&#39;s House of Bad Fanfiction. When the drama with Lolita went down the root admin for WGW, Nihilist, led an exodus over to a new site with the help of several other members, such as one called InkWeaver; this is what the civil war in Plort&#39;s version of the events is alluding to, and the &quot;Battle of Hobaf&quot; is just that old site. WGW is linked on our wiki, but it&#39;s pretty dead nowadays.)<br><br>Plerk - plurk.com (this is kind of a Twitter clone that works as described in the story it got mentioned in)<br><br>Sovet - This one I&#39;d prefer to stay a mystery. It references another community I&#39;m part of that I felt like giving a shoutout, but it&#39;s about as comfortable as I&#39;m going to get with crossing it over with here. Not really a space filler, unless you want to put in &quot;Will remain a mystery&quot; or something, just why I didn&#39;t explain it even though I&#39;m the one who put this here.<br><br>Fantopra - The Phantom of the Opera<br><br>De Litarios - Deliterius (a sporking community on LJ founded by a former PPC Boarder, as said on the wiki. This was big around the time GAFF was.)</p>

            <p><i>(Author’s note: Eagle-eyed readers will noticed that some details have changed since my first entry into this particular universe. Well, okay, one major change. I’m not sure what I was thinking when I named my knight persona PC. That it was mysterious or something? I don’t know. I’ve tried to make the retcons as seamless as possible. Many apologies to Huinesoron for doing so.)</i><br><br>THE RETURN<br>There had been rumors floating around that he had sailed into Mei’n Payj one cold and misty morning. The ship was bound from Yu’Tub, people would murmur to their fellows in the taverns and shops, and was festooned with unfamiliar banners celebrating a “Tyrant of Tablets.” The man in black robes was the only person standing on the deck, but it still sailed under some unseen power. And when he stepped off the boat and vanished into the alleyways of the city? It vanished into thin air.<br><br>Others swore to Kanun that they had seen him wandering the backroads of Borrd (or Iric, or Wechi – the location seemed to change with every new telling). They told of how he would walk with travellers for a while, sharing the ancient secrets of Beytah and telling tales of battles against the Marizu with them before turning away down some new twist in the path. Attempts to follow him always failed for one reason or another.<br><br>Their description was always the same. He was tall, with heavy boots that somehow managed not to leave prints in the dirt. Any details of his face or body were hidden by his black hooded robes. An empty scabbard hung from the belt cinched around his waist.<br><br>Nobody really thought too much of the stories until one day, when the man in black robes appeared in Manyuel, in the very heart of Wechi. An archivist found him standing before a collection of old weapons from knights long past.<br><br>“Can I help you, good sir?” the archivist asked.<br><br>The man did not reply at first. It was only when the archivist asked again did he slightly turn his head. “The sword and shield of Sir PC, the Poor Cynick,” he said. “The ones he discarded upon his departure. I trust you have them?”<br><br>“Of course! Was there a specific reason you wanted to see them?”<br><br>The man pushed back his hood, revealing a familar face.<br><br>“To reclaim them,” the Poor Cynick said.</p>

            <p><b>The Heraldry of Sir PC, the Poor Cynick</b><br><br>Per bend, vert and argent, between a double-headed axe or and a bitten apple proper, on a bend sable three closed books argent.<br><br><b>The Weapons of Sir PC, the Poor Cynick</b><br><br><i>Lauralin/the Blade of Dukes, and the shield Rikkard’s Son</i><br>The Poor Cynick’s first weapons, and the ones in his armory that have seen the most battles. Unfortunately, they broke when he cast them down before the barons on his departure. When he returned and reclaimed them, he reforged Lauralin into the Blade of Dukes. Its grey steel blade was replaced with one that was much stronger, but a dull red in color. Rikkard’s Son was not repaired, however. He now bears it on his back wherever he goes – whether as penance or a reminder, he has not said.<br><br><i>Xericka, the Dark Dagger and Gremlyn, the Lightning Dagger</i><br>In the wake of his first battle, where he slew the Sisters of Nothingness, the Poor Cynick recovered a dagger from the field. Its blade was almost completely black apart from silver filigree etchings. He paired it with another dagger he crafted himself out of thunderbolt iron. He called the pair Xericka and Gremlyn, and bore them into battle whenever there was a need to fight off Marizu lust-spirits.<br><br><i>Racalendaris</i><br>Racalendaris is a great maul, a two-handed hammer that the Poor Cynick has on occasion taken into battle. It is not a subtle weapon, but seems to be one that brings the knight no small amount of glee whenever he uses it.<br><br><i>The Scrying Stone of Kharnelius</i><br>A most mysterious artifact, the Poor Cynick can allegedly use this stone to peer into other worlds. It has even been rumored that he can use the stone to step into those worlds, but that has never been proven.<br><br><i>The Man of Pitt’s Bow</i><br>The Man of Pitt’s Bow is a weapon the Poor Cynick brought with him when he returned from his self-imposed exile. He has not told anyone how he got it or who the Man of Pitt is, although evidence suggests that he was a well-experienced soldiers. It is not yet known if he has ever used it in anger.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, in the Grand Republic of Deeay, a young woman called eatpraylove drew pictures of strange and wondrous animals for anyone who cared to look (which wasn&#39;t too many). After a while, she found she could draw larger crowds by showing them stories she wrote. The stories were imperfect and often a warped type of &quot;songfic&quot;, but people smiled and nodded as they read. Some of them shared their own pictures or excerpts of tales, of which her favorites went into her magic scrapbook. The scrapbook, given to all artisans in Deeay, allowed readers to view all of a certain story as long as at least one chapter remained in the book. Same for pictures; if one was in the scrapbook, you could view all the rest by that artisan. ((Favoriting something on dA does kind of work like that.))<br><br>Eatpraylove enjoyed sharing and receiving stories and pictures, but she enjoyed traveling Weab as well. Among other destinations, she set up a small temporary home in the famous Fanvik-Neht. Like Deeay, the people there were kind to her stories, and she found many enjoyable works free from the Marizu influence.<br><br>Or so she thought. As she matured, eatpraylove realized that some of the tales in her scrapbook were much poorer than she&#39;d thought at first. The character choices didn&#39;t make sense, the plots were unoriginal, and in at least two cases, the author wrote her character specifically to be a celebrity&#39;s love interest; all hallmarks of the Marizu. She&#39;d heard of them in her frequent visits to Tivit, and was alarmed to discover their taint in her beloved scrapbook. (Fortunately, her favorite tales from Fanvik-Neht and its equestrian twin, Fimvik-Neht, stood the test of maturity.) <br><br>By pure chance, possibly when researching memory potions, she found mention of the Protectorate of Plort (as it was then called). The tome contained many references to various knights and their exploits, which intrigued her as often as the passages&#39; lack of context confused her.<br><br>Even better, the book spoke of Plort&#39;s early history; the tales of Jay, Acacia, and other legendary knights fighting off all variety of Marizu in Lotor were inspiring. And so she made her second great journey, to Borrd and Wechi. After traveling across the country to hear tales of various knights and barons in battle, she settled near the border of Wechi and Borrd. Even today, she continues to share her stories and artwork in Deeay, as well as visit Fanvik-Neht to hear new tales (or identify Marizu for the knights of Borrd).<br><br>Eatpraylove is a fairly simple woman, and her shield reflects this; an olive-green field with a blue party per chevron. The green part bears a light gray cat, stretching. While originally she hoped to join the wizard&#39;s guild or the castle spies, she has set her eyes on knighthood. Of the various toys and pets she had in Deeay, only her horse, Ami, actually accompanied her to Plort. The first time she unpacked, she found in one silver bag a long dagger from her childhood. It was rusty and dull from disuse, and eatpraylove herself did not remember exactly how her make-believe adventures had happened. But it was a weapon still, and she had it reforged and re-baptized &quot;Chris&quot;.</p>

            <p>Some years ago, a lone merchant discreetly landed on the island of Konti-Nyuum  with nothing more than an empty purse, a well-worn travelling cloak, a horse, and a small brass spyglass. While fleeing to the lands of Tivit, the farmer heard of the valiant deeds of a group of knights originating from an island to the east and their fight against the Marizu. <br><br>Prior to his visit to Tivit, the merchant owned a tiny speck of land in the nation of Vidya Gaym, a sprawling nation that contained bustling cities such as Lozz, Emmytoo, and Lamb-daa. Unfortunately, Vidya Gaym was often the prey of Marizu raids-- probably because the land was fertile and the mineral deposits bountiful. One day, Turtle woke to the sounds of a Marizu war band-- the nearby town of Lozz was being raided. Not knowing how to fight, the merchant quickly fled the area on foot after collecting his most precious belongings and stuffing them in a bag.<br><br>Cut off from his land, the merchant resolved to start anew elsewhere. He followed the highway northeast to the nation of Bronee, where he did business for a while and bought a skinny skittish stallion named Gaspard. Now much more mobile, he pressed north, through the lands of Are-Pea and Yu&#39;Tub before arriving in Tivit. From there, he learned of the Union of Plort and spent the last of his gold on a boat that would take him to Konti-Nyuum. Once there, he hoped to support the knights by selling food and equipment to them. <br><br>Everything went better than expected for the merchant: he set up shop in the town of Borrd and made enough profits to make a living. He picked up some new skills over time-- smithing, Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl, and Arpying for example. After proving his worth in the Trial of Permission, Merchant Turtle was granted a knighthood by Baron Phobos. <br><br>Always looking for ways to assist the Knights of Plort, the newly minted Sir Turtle of the Sea used his modest wealth to finance the repairs for one of Plort&#39;s most neglected sailing vessels. In less than a month Captain Soo-Lah Rose&#39;s ship, the <i>Deoh Eye</i>, was made seaworthy again. Sir Turtle  participated in three of the <i>Deoh Eye</i>&#39;s reconnaissance expeditions before buying a ranch outside Borrd to raise horses for all knights riding on the <i>Deoh Eye</i>. From his ranch Sir Turtle now applied his smithing skills to bring new equipment to the knights of Plort. His projects-- with various code-names-- will soon to be put on the market: &quot;Taldaris&quot;, a cuirass made of the finest and lightest metals, &quot;Fire Flash&quot;, steel-toed leather boots with incredible durability, &quot;Naya&quot;, a crossbow of unparalleled power firing TB-type quarrels, and &quot;Guardsman&quot;, a collection of rugged multipurpose knifes. <br><br><br><br>Sir Turtle of the Sea&#39;s heraldry:<br><br><b>Sable, a chicken trussed Argent.</b><br><br>Motto: &quot;Fugite et non respicite&quot; (<i>&quot;Flee and don&#39;t look back.&quot;</i>)<br><br></p>

            <p>[Neshomeh alerted me to this thread, and I had to post. Though I don&#39;t do much PPCing these days, I still lurk and follow PPC news, so I figure this little tale would be in the right spirit of things. <br><br>Regarding the heraldic device--I think I got it right, but I&#39;m not sure. Basically a white/silver field with a black wolf and a black ram facing each other.]<br><br>Arms of the Tungsten Monk: Argent, a wolf sable and ram sable combatant.<br><br>Many years ago, the Tungsten Monk came to Konti-Nyuum as a wandering novice. Trained since a child in the Way of Uf, the school of thought which seeks for dark creatures hidden in the corners of the world, she found Konti-Nyuum much to her liking. Yet her skills were crude and unpolished, and she wandered from barony to barony seeking guidance and experience. The people of the Union of Plort were kind to her when she had little to offer, and she learned much from them.<br><br>After many adventures she settled in the Barony of Neshomeh. But when all was well and she thought to have many happy years defending Plort, her life was uprooted again.<br><br>As a devotee of the Way of Uf, the Tungsten Monk could not give up the seeking after monsters. Fighting the Marizu was a worthy cause, but she feared her divided loyalties would keep her from being a true warrior of Plort. So, seeking another way, she used what she had learned from her travels on Konti-Nyuum and founded a small settlement on one of the many uninhabited islands of Airi-junal, halfway between Konti-Nyuum and Autor. This island, Airi-junal Uf Buk, did not have many resources, but the settlement did well enough. The Tungsten Monk was pleased.<br><br>Yet now, her loyalties were divided more than before. No knight can serve two masters, and Airi-junal Uf Buk required her presence more than Plort did. In the end she exiled herself to the wilds of the Airi-junal Islands, leaving her great boar-spear Suicide and shield Diocletian to the care of Baroness Neshomeh.<br><br>Her settlements in Airi-junal have flourished, which makes the Tungsten Monk happy. Yet she cannot forget Plort and what its people did for her. Were she to truly move to Autor she would smile upon them, but that is not her place now and she is still only a knight. And so she lives in Airi-junal yet sometimes, with the connivance of the noble Baroness her patron, makes secret haste across the ocean to Konti-Nyuum and takes up her arms for one battle more.</p>

            <p>The Way of Uf is my favored genre--urban fantasy, usually abbreviated to UF in text conversations. And yes, Airi-junal is the dreaded Original UF Book, a project which simultaneously delights its writer but also opens said writer to new potential legal issues when engaging in fandom fun. :( It&#39;s why I&#39;m not active in the PPC much; when you&#39;re building a career writing fiction, you have to pull back from fandom. </p>

            <p>I know I&#39;m still a newcomer who&#39;s only been on the actual Board for a month, but this looks like too much fun not to jump in.<br><br>Skaer&#39;morys, or Skaer for short, is a Beastmaster, a type of mage who summons and controls wild beasts. Once a commoner who spent his time in the wilderness rather than in towns or cities, he has travelled to many places throughout his life and, being still quite young, Skaer has plans to visit many more. However, his previous attempts to settle down were hampered by his egotism and lack of initiative, and he was thus humbled and shunned by several peoples he met in the past. He found himself in Konti-Nyuum only a month prior to the current time, and given the welcoming community, he has decided to stay.<br><br>Skaer has brought two of his creatures with him to Konti-Nyuum: Falchion, a strange bird from an Eastern land with feathers of silver and wings of crimson, and Rasheeda, a white lioness from a desert kingdom he once visited. Neither of them have been tested on the battlefield, especially because he has yet to gain Knight status, but he is more than willing to unleash the wrath of the sand and sky against the Marizu invasion.<br><br>For Skaer&#39;s heraldry colors, I&#39;m thinking argent with a sable double-headed eagle displayed, armed with langued gules, holding a white sword with blade up in one talon and a blue feather quill with shaft down in the other.</p>

            <p>(Why did I pick that name?  That is a stupid name.  Sounds like the dullest Time Lord that ever was.)<br><br><i>Per fess, azure and vert, between two enclosing brackets, argent, a crown, Or, above a goat, proper.</i><br><br>To be clear, that&#39;s a blue-over-green background, with white [brackets] on either end.  A (preferably) black-and-brown goat on the green field, and a gold crown over the blue.  (Specifically, a crown shaped like this, if possible:<br><br><img src="http://www.khwiki.com/images/thumb/f/f5/Icon_Crown.png/82px-Icon_Crown.png" alt="http://www.khwiki.com/images/thumb/f/f5/Icon_Crown.png/82px-Icon_Crown.png"> <br><br>Also, I would like one of the oval, lady-shields to be <s>contrary and difficult</s> forward-thinking and stereotype-breaking.<br><br>And now, a short story (I just kind of throw these down at the drop of a hat, anymore, don&#39;t I?):<br><br><i>The Book Repairman walked stealthily and warily down the corridors of the castle, the smell of goats following ever after as he passed another scrawling of &quot;CANT&quot; upon the walls.  He had spent many weeks in this castle, near a port in El-Jheycom, seeking the fragmented stories of Kippur, called the Bird.<br><br>Long ago, the Bird had been a knight of Plort, wielding many weapons against the Marizu: Verra, a mighty launcher of enchanted flame; Lorac, the magic wand; and a mysterious weapon marked &quot;C.&quot;  But best known of Kippur&#39;s weapons was a strange siege engine, the Alexander.  The Alexander carried strange cloaking magics, which Kippur used to infiltrate many lands, both in Weab and in the Scholar&#39;s Empire.  Mostly, these were missions of observation, and exploration, but the Bird had not been afraid to wage war on many of the more slovenly states, whether dominated by Marizu or not: most famously, the Inherited Cities.<br><br>Many of Kippur&#39;s campaigns against the Marizu had departed from this castle; indeed, the Repairman had entered through the storage region for the weapons from thos long-ago sieges.  They had been largely abandoned, with the remains of the flame-launcher Verra long ago left destroyed, and beyond use.  Still, records lived on in small pieces, and the search led the archaeologist into the still-thriving section of the Bird&#39;s castle.  Here, where the Bird&#39;s heraldry of cat, Or, and budgie, vert, still lined the walls, bright and tended, the Book Repairman continued with much caution, for signs of fresh preparation lay everywhere.  Kippur was readying his possessions for travel into the lands of the Scholar&#39;s Empire permanently, with a newer and more robust version of the Alexander, ready to form a nation of his own.<br><br>The Repairman had no desire to intrude, only pausing to find more mentions of the Bird&#39;s days as a knight.  Even here, where the time of Plort seemed long forgotten, some small signs of Kippur&#39;s knighthood yet lingered.  And these signs led to yet another wing of the castle, unknown previously, where small memoirs of the knight and his weapons yet lingered.  Those these were not the tales of campaigns the Book Repairman had set out to find, he rejoiced! for the statue of the Bird in Wechi could soon be added to, and made larger, that all the denizens of Plort would know more of the tales of Kippur the Knight!</i><br><br>So, uh, yeah.  This has been my &quot;journey&quot; through Kippur&#39;s LJs, still ongoing.  I know this is a little weird, buuuuuut I was working on Kippur&#39;s stuff just before I started designing my herald, so it was quite on my mind.  I intended this to be more about my character at the start, but it evolved more into being about Kippur.  But that&#39;s fine, I think; he&#39;s not here to write it himself, after all.<br><br>Some references that may not be obvious:<br>*Kippur had three LJs, hence the three wings to his El-Jheycom castle.  (His personal one, his writing one, and the IC-Alec one.  Actually he had IC journals for a ton of other characters, too, but let&#39;s not go nuts, here.)<br>*The flamethrower (did I make that sound fantasy enough?) Verra is destroyed because Agent Verra is, actually, dead.  It happened outside the PPC, in an RP with another community, but it seems to have applied to our Verra, too.  So sad face there.<br>*The herald contains two of Kippur&#39;s pets, a cat and a budgie.  (The bird was a present to his mother for Yom Kippur, hence &quot;Kippurbird.&quot;  What?  No, I wasn&#39;t reading the personal entries!  Intentionally. &gt;<em>&gt;  It was about animals!  I couldn&#39;t help it!)  He also had a fish he was quite fond of, but I felt the sentence was getting way too long.<br>*&quot;CANT&quot; stands for &quot;Cure All Neuro-Typicals.&quot;  Kippur used to sell merchandise with this saying to counter the well-meaning-but-ultimately-insulting CAN: Cure Autism Now.  Sadly, the store he sold that stuff through seems to be down now.  :(<br>*And, of course, as the wiki has said for years, Alec and Lorac (but no longer Verra) are set appear in their own series of novels, which Kippur will hopefully publish.  Which I can&#39;t wait for, because I feel like I&#39;ve already read half of it from the writing samples he wrote over the years.  Incidentally, Kippur already has a non-fiction book available for pre-order (coming out mid-December), which I plug here, that we may send monies to our esteemed colleague: &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tropes-Fantasy-Fiction-Gabrielle-Lissauer/dp/0786478586/ref=sr">http://www.amazon.com/Tropes-Fantasy-Fiction-Gabrielle-Lissauer/dp/0786478586/ref=sr</a></em>1<em>1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408682053&amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tropes-Fantasy-Fiction-Gabrielle-Lissauer/dp/0786478586/ref=sr">http://www.amazon.com/Tropes-Fantasy-Fiction-Gabrielle-Lissauer/dp/0786478586/ref=sr</a></em>1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1408682053&amp;sr=1-1</a><br><br>Also and finally, sharing a video I saw today about fandom shipping.

            <p>I just thought to toss my two cents in, because I can. <br><br>In regards to Verra. Sadly, as I revised my series she had to be taken out of continuity. So, alas she doesn&#39;t exist any more. But she does still exist because reality and Alec&#39;s back story is convoluted and confusing. IE. There&#39;s the <i>canon</i> Alec which is the one that appears in the Alternate&#39;s stories, which no longer contain Verra. There&#39;s the <i>Gary Stu</i> Alec who goes along with the idea that Verra never existed, but knows she did, because the PPC did happen to him. And because of the nature of the multiverse she still does exist, because you can&#39;t completely wipe someone out, because there&#39;s always that reality where they didn&#39;t get wiped out. <br><br>Trousers of time! Hurrah! <br><br>As for that RP thing where she died, I generally pretend like it never happened and Alec does too. It makes life easier that way. So, Verra is still around... even if she&#39;s not. (Confusing, yes?)<br><br>If anyone is ever trying to make sense of Alec&#39;s back story the best way to go about it is &quot;Everything is true. Even if it contradicts itself.&quot;<br><br>The novels themselves have taken quite a turn around and need some definite continuity editing, but I&#39;m working on that.  <br><br>Any other questions? </p>

            <p>Kippur definitely started out in the PPC as &#39;she&#39;, and I have a vague memory of her switching to &#39;him&#39; later on... but a conversation with someone who&#39;s spoken to Kippur fairly recently suggests &#39;she&#39; is the operative term again. Also, <a href="http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-7858-3">the publisher of her book says &#39;she&#39;,</a> and &#39;Gabrielle&#39; is a female name in most places. So I&#39;m switching (back) to &#39;she&#39;.<br><br>Also: Verra&#39;s dead? Rotten. :(<br><br>Oh, yeah... heraldry!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Shielddoctorlit.png"><br><br>I wasn&#39;t sure precisely what you were doing with the brackets, so I just took a stab at it. The goat is rampant because I found a useful picture to modify. ;)<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ShieldKippur.png"><br><br>Why does Kips get ermine? Well, why shouldn&#39;t she? Also, it looks just a little like a fish...<br><br>Also: the description of Kippur&#39;s castle was highly amusing. Thanks for that. Though I assume it&#39;s in El-Jhey, rather than the defunct and landlocked El-Jheycom...?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, admittedly, I can&#39;t know for sure without talking to them.  I was just going by what Kippur had said in their LJ.<br><br>Not only is Verra dead, but the childrens!  The little Trovens are dead too!  D:  They got killed by another canon from their eventual-continuum, which is especially weird, because newer drafts seem to have changed that character into being &quot;bit of a jerk&quot; rather than &quot;evil, vindictive psychopath.&quot;<br><br>I love the heraldry!  The brackets are to represent the wiki.  I was picturing the oval going the other way, which would have let them be a more &quot;regular&quot; shape, but this is fine.  All that matters is that <i>I</i> know what they are.  :)  Kippur&#39;s looks great, too.  Look at that little budgie face!<br><br>Sorry I got the El-Jhey vs. El-Jheycom mixed up, though.</p>

            <p>[[OOC: Why do I have so many agents...]]<br>When Karrin the Blue first began her excursions to the Marizu lands, she carried with her four weapons: <i>Lana</i>, a crossbow of great power which could strike from afar; <i>Narav</i> a furred cloak to ward against harm; <i>Tera</i>, a pair of gauntlets and boots, in appearance alike to an insectile carapace, each piece engraved with spells of battle-magic, fleet-footedness, and protection; and <i>Ari </i>, a shining blade which held in its heart the fires of its creation, which could be seen in the red glow of its fuller. With these in hand, Karrin set out to battle. <br><br>One day, while out routing a Marizu incursion lead by Alyxx Heart alongside the Fast Seneschal, Karrin found two artifacts on the battlefield that could be salvaged and purified of their Marizu origins. And so she took <i>Alicia</i>, the shadowed axe, and <i>Lumina</i>, the brilliant tome, and conquered their powers and remade them into <i>Fiorano</i>, the obsidian halberd, and <i>Theia</i>, the magical book. <br> <br>When the battle had concluded, she set about creating a trio of artifacts, which would never see combat but aid in preparation. First, she traveled to the lands of the Bronee, and spent twelve days gathering herbs and weaving the magics of the land. On the dawn of the thirteenth day, she held the product of her labors, a rose-colored pouch containing as many healer&#39;s potions and herbs as she knew, and the pouch was named <i>Kindheart.</i> She then ventured to the ports of the armies, where she spent twenty-four days studying the ways of the scryers and diviners. On the dawn of the twenty-fifth day, she held the products of her labors; a pair of white spectacles, which could examine the inner workings of an artifact, which was named <i>Caroline</i>, and a spyglass that could see into any familiar land, no matter how far it might be, which was named <i>Anne.</i> With these tools in hand, she returned home.<br><br>One day, while looking through her spyglass, the Fire-Mage glimpsed a collection of Marizu encampments, and though each one was small their numbers suggested a quick spread. Karrin set off on a ship, and while she sailed she forged a new weapon - a curved blade,  with a dark sea-green blade and the hilt fashioned after the clever tentacles of the octopi, with a shining green gem in the center. The blade, she judged, would serve well against the magi of the Marizu, for it had been made to channel magic as well as any wand, and she named it <i>Cepha</i>.<br><br>Though the blade was well-made, upon her landing Karrin found no use for it, for the encampments had been abandoned and all marks of the Marizu wiped away. In the dusty remains she found a forgotten weapon, a red Marizu&#39;s knife, made as a copy of a Konti-Nyuum relic. She took it with her, and in the fires of her hearth she remade it into the dagger-wand <i>Amara</i>. <br><br>For a time, she rested in the vale with her two companions. She discovered an old tome recounting the rarely-heard tale of the land Dhirotailehs, and from the knowledge within she wove a long rope, which split into three weighted ends, and spun magic into each strand to keep it strong, and it was named <i>Riaa&#39;lzhor</i>.<br><br>Upon one fall day, a scant time before the festival of Nahn-Oh Wry-Moh, Karrin the Blue received a vision, foretelling the Marizu warleader Nova, who spread ruin in her wake across. She and Thanasius Ampelius left as soon as they were able, arriving on the Marizu lands as swiftly as they could. They followed the trail of destroyed land, aided by a wandering knight, until they caught up with her. In a great duel, Karrin the Blue battled Nova, until at last she struck the fiend&#39;s heart with such force that <i>Ari</i> shattered. <br><br>Karrin and Thanalius returned home, exhausted by their efforts. Nevertheless, in her forge, Karrin worked day and night to repair her first sword. Finally, she held aloft a new sword, thinner than the old, but with a ember-red blade as sharp as a flame. Her magic sapped, she rested, honing her skills with each weapon and each magical school she could find. And so she remained, until recently, when she began to walk through the cities of Borrd again...</p>

            <p>When Thanasius Ampelius first arrived at Borrd, he rented a room in an inn so nondescript no-one even remembered its name; its inhabitants and owner were insignificant in the large scheme of things. Well, save for one that arrived at its door one humid night. His appearance matched that of Thanasius exactly, save for one detail: he sported a horrid goatee while Thanasius was clean-shaven. Wearily, the monk approached him. The man seemed amiable, and they sat down and ate their dinner together. Thanasius learned that the man was named Death Dendle, that he hailed from the nation of Dunastuvaryorz, and, most curiously, his profession: Death Dendle was a Kagemusha, a shadow warrior trained to impersonate the master who had his contract.<br>Even though Thanasius was poor, deep in his bones he felt that he had to get the Kagemusha&#39;s contract. So played a game of cards, which Thanasius barely won, and Death Dendle declared his loyalty to him.<br>Time passed; he moved to Iric, was exiled to Ydyff, and returned, settling in Baron Huinesoron&#39;s lands. One day he chanced upon an axe lodged in a tree. It was beautifully made; white, long of handle and of blade and gleaming in the sunlight. Curious, he dislodged it and inspected it. Runes were written on the blade, and after a few hours of deciphering, he understood what they said: <i>Anebrin, blade of evil&#39;s bane by evil shattered</i>. He looked around. There was noone in sight; finding the axe&#39;s owner seemed like an impossible task. Rising to his feet, he swung Anebrin experimentally. The axe&#39;s blade seemed to cut the air itself, electricity crackled across the blade, and Thanasius felt a great feeling of “Right”, tampered by the slightest speck of fear. Taking one last look around, he made a loop in his belt and took Anebrin for himself.<br>Yet more time passed. He encountered the Fast Seneschal and Karrin the Blue and settled in their monastery; he and Karrin fought the great Marizu Nova and lived to tell the tale. Three months later, he received reports of a Marizu leader named Auniira that was raiding the Scholars&#39; Empire land of Feir-oon. Taking his Ydyffan ship, he set sail to Feir-oon. There he battled Auniira and bested her, but not without a price; as he struck the killing blow, a shard of her malice lodged itself within Anebrin&#39;s blade, and the axe shattered shortly after Thanasius returned to the monastery.<br>Devoid of a weapon, for a while he laid low, seeking a replacement, until one day he found a peculiar tome in the monastery&#39;s library.<br>Sneezing from the dust – for that section of the library was not disturbed for many a year – Thanasius gingerly removed the tome from its resting place and put it on his reading desk. It was large, old and bound in brown leather; on its binding the words “The Librarian” were beautifully written in golden ink. He opened it, and wiping the tears from his eyes (he was sneezing again), began to read. After a while, it became clear that it was a tome of spells, and the monk decided to replace his axe with it.</p>

            <p>(Wherein I add some more to this tale of July&#39;s wanderings via a cultural lesson.)<br><br>One of the many places July wandered, once she built a vessel worthy of traveling to sea was the land of Dedubya- a place that had taken up much of El-Jhey&#39;s domain after a combined mass rebellion and emigration. <br><br>Dedubya was a strange place, where the culture shared much with Are-Pea, but had changed it to suit themselves. The collection of masks- called Aikawns- were of great import, with a large focus on collecting as many Aikawns as one could through either creating them or purchasing them from others. Aikawn thievery, however, in Dedubya, makes up much of its black market. In Dedubya, performances were contingent on the quality and variety of masks<br><br>Those willing to fund the rulers of Dedubya- called Dreemeers and led by the sorceress Danees- were allowed to collect more Aikawns, but only through a constant support of the Dreemeers were they allowed to keep them. <br><br>It was in Dedubya that she also discovered the small island of Plerk- a name that gave her surprise, given its similarity to the land she had left some time ago. <br><br>Plerk was colonized by Dedubbers, many of whom made a regular travel between Plerk and Dedubya.<br><br>And so, in her curiosity, she traveled to Plerk. <br><br>The island itself was small, but busy and bustling- she found that there, compared to Dedubya, Plerkians widened their circles to more discussion. The emphasis on presentation was still important, with each new thing catching eyes and appearances being prized, but here Aikawns were not  a major cultural event.<br><br>One thing that Plerkians did emphasize, however, was spreading news- by repeating exactly what had been said by the original person while adding their own opinions or input. &#39;Re&#39;plerking was important, and status determined often by how much someone responded to someone&#39;s news or replerked their original words.<br><br>As strange as it was, it was not En-Sain-Jawno, which was rumored to be even stranger, and cultlike at times, and the wanderer found it enjoyable enough to stay for some time and create a circle of friends from locals.</p>

            <p>...of Lady Iximaz, wanderer of Weab, protector of Plort, and champion of Jaikaiar.<br><br>For many years, Lady Iximaz was but a simple citizen of Fanvik-Neht, unconcerned with the rumors of the growing threat of the Marizu. She was content to pass her days listening to tales of exotic lands, and though she often wondered what it would be like to travel, she had no need to leave.<br><br>One day, however, it came to pass that a raid of Marizu forced her to flee Fanvik-Neht, leaving behind her home. Forced into the wild and unforgiving lands of Weab, Iximaz learned to fight for her survival. She traveled the continent, occasionally finding refuge among the people of Bronee or the Potters&#39; Moore.<br><br>After many months, Iximaz found herself in the land of Tivit. Here, she first heard the tales of the land of Plort and the brave knights who fought the Marizu. Inspired by these stories, she traveled to the island, where she was welcomed like a long-lost friend. She made a new home in the shining city of Borrd and made an effort to learn their laws and customs.<br><br>As she became familiar with the city, she found herself going to the knights and asking to hear more tales of their triumphs, and her desire to join their ranks grew ever stronger. At last, she steeled her courage and went to the Barons of Plort  and asked to train as another warrior.<br><br>Baron Huinesoron pondered her request. &quot;Though it is still too early to be certain,&quot; he said, &quot;from what I can tell, you show promise. I shall grant you permission to train as a knight.&quot; And this, he bestowed upon her the title of Lady.<br><br>From then on, Lady Iximaz rode forth, her banner* held high, spreading the teachings of Jaikaiar and driving away the menaces of the Marizu.<br><br><i>Quod scribio, libero.</i><br><br><br>*Vert, per chevron Or, below scroll Argent</p>

IIRC, by the end of my second semester, we had already gone over all five declensions and at least the present tense of all &quot;four&quot; conjugations (i.e., the <i>-are</i> verbs, the <i>-ēre</i> verbs, the <i>-ĕre</i> verbs (of which <i>scribere</i> is one), the &quot;third -io&quot; verbs (i.e. verbs like <i>jacio</i>, <i>jacere</i>, <i>jeci</i>, <i>jactus</i>) and the <i>-ire</i> verbs).</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll probably put up more things in future posts, I just wanted to jot some stuff down quickly.<br><br>The arms of Sir Ekyl are simple - sanguine, bull head cabossed sable, chief crown proper. Notable weapons include the longsword Zod&#39;s Fang, a trophy from his first battle against the Marizu, the war lance Einarr, and the war hammer Kyran; when he rides into battle or tournament, he does so astride the destrier Valec or the courser Marcus. <br><br>Cyclopedia entries from the tale of Sir Ekyl that have yet to make it in (I hope I&#39;m still allowed to make up things like the road; I feel like I maybe got a bit carried away so feel free to chop this stuff up however much is needed):<br><br>Godreve - Town, Protectorate of Borrd. Located near the centre of Cassie&#39;s baronial lands, equidistant from Iric, Wechi and the rest of Borrd. This town, a portion of the surrounding countryside and the castle by the same name were awarded to Sir Ekyl when the new baron chose to grant him a fief, in recognition of their friendship. The town is decently sized, defended by a well-trained militia and Ekyl&#39;s retinue of men-at-arms, and the castle it grew around is an imposing hilltop structure known for stout defences and a vast library said to contain tomes on all subjects. Sir Ekyl prefers to do most of his governing within his keep and spends much time reading or writing in the library when he isn&#39;t away travelling, but he can still be found in town for festivities or occasions such as oversight of civic projects, like the road which now connects Godreve with the port town of Tumblar, or defending his fief from outlaws, rebels or the occasional troll raiders. As these lands are often restless, Ekyl&#39;s men can at times be found patrolling the barony outside of his actual territory.<br><br>Nihilo, King - Noble, King of Wugwha. Formerly a knight of Gaf, when a queen rose from the ashes of its fall to unite much of the Diaspora under her rule he swore his sword and served loyally for some time. However, when this queen was revealed to be the troll Lolita, an ally of the Marizu, he declared rebellion, rallying many former lords of old Gaf to his banner. With this army, as well as aid from paladins of Somath-Aful and the powerful mage known as the Weaver of Inks, he was able to win the civil war, felling Lolita in single combat at the Battle of Hobaf and forming a new kingdom. He has ruled well in the years since, but of late it is said he has withdrawn into himself, leaving more and more of the tasks of governance to his trusted advisers. Sir Ekyl rode in the van of his battles for the throne, and fought alongside him for years afterwards, but serves him no longer.<br><br>Edward &quot;the Swift&quot;, King - Noble, King of Tivit. Once a capable ruler, with age he has fallen into tyranny and sloth, ruling entirely based upon arbitrary whims. When delegates from Plort came informing him of misinformation his realm was spreading about their lands and asking him to make a change, he branded them liars and invaders, sending soldiers to prevent any modifications from being made. He fears and hates Somath-Aful, seeing their influence behind every shadow since Tivit&#39;s fleets were defeated by the empire in five great battles; any criticism of his reign is treated as an attempt to betray the kingdom to Somath-Aful, resulting in banishment or execution.<br><br>Eyepi - An ancient school of magic whose spells, rightly applied, can defeat most wards of banishment.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve tried to create it in paint, but that&#39;s failed three times now.

            <p>Collated from the discussions of the barons, and with the hope that all will be accepted forthwith.<br><br>-That Barony Makari be placed under the guardianship of Baron Dann.<br><br>-That Council funds be directed to the improvement of the trade network of the Union, including but not limited to:<br>--The improvement of the Pankae Road.<br>--The thorough mapping of the Western Arc to make travel between Borrd and Tumblar safer.<br>--The establishment of a road from Borrd to Godreve, across the Larninkurv Mountains.<br>--The subsequent improvement of the road from Godreve to Tumblar.<br>--The establishment of a true trade route along the Iron Highway, legitimising this vital road.<br><br>-That the mining region south of the Reverence Mountains be divided in two, with the Calbek and Trevaya mines going to Barony Huinesoron and Ozerbord, and Risersh and the Wurtplai mine going to Barony Neshomeh and Wechi. Thus the absurdity of this region being administered by Borrd and Barony Phobos, separated from it by the Umor Woods, can be alleviated.<br><br>-That taxation of trade from Borrd on the Iron Highway and Copperway be frozen until the next meeting of this Council, to encourage increased trade in the area.<br><br>-That the northern boundary between Baronies Huinesoron and Phobos, and between Ozerbord and Borrd, remain as they stand.<br><br>-That the disputed &#39;northern tax haven&#39; be administered solely under Ozerbord tax and related laws, until such time as:<br>--The crisis currently afflicting the region is alleviated.<br>--Barony Huinesoron has developed Critta&#39; into a true port town, and mapped any trade routes therefrom.<br>[[Essentially, I&#39;m asking for lower taxes, but compulsory civil service to fight the disaster and build the port; after I&#39;ve done that, the region can go back to higher taxes with hopefully increased trade]]<br><br>-That the city of Odolotos be taxed under Ozerbord tax laws for the same period, and its people be tasked with aiding the folk of the &#39;tax haven&#39; in their endeavours.<br>--Since Odolotos will benefit from increased trade through Critta&#39; and through the tax-frozen Copperway, this act will represent an increase in profit for Barony Phobos.<br><br>-That, with the return of Baron Araeph to Borrd, the boundaries of her barony remain as presently constituted until the next council.<br>[[Because I figure an absent baron will be more useful for El-Jheycom than being a part of Wechi]]<br><br>It is to be hoped that these proposals can be swiftly accepted, and the Council can be freed to return to our neglected fight against the Marizu.<br><br>~Baron Huinesoron, etc etc etc</p>

            <p>... Critta&#39; has been partially merged with a neighbouring fishing village to create the port of Critta-Kalthin.

He’s prone to pomp and circumstance, which… might be me. ;) He tries to claim power in various areas, whereas I, quite frankly, would rather have none. So, with that said…]]<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/OzerbordFlag.png"><br><br><i>Oh lonely land<br>Oh quiet streets<br>Oh mighty Wattufs<br>Oh Ozerbord, we sing to thee!</i><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ImpaledArms.png"><br><br>Huinesoron, Baron and Knight of Plort, Protector of Ozerbord, Custodian of Fanvik-Whirl, Marshal of the Order of Udisc, Scourge of the Marizu, Friend of Medellurth, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c greets the Council and all visitors, and wishes to make these statements:<br><br><b>On Makari:</b> The continued absence of Baron Makari, whose barony includes the largest city and trade-port of the Republic of Iric, is cause for serious concern. We propose that, as has been done in the past, her barony be dissolved. Its territory should be passed to Barony Dann.<br><br>Since this act will render Barony Dann the largest by far of all the baronies of Plort, it is our further proposal that the regions of Barony Dann between the Auriantym Mountains and the Kar’eer Forest should pass to Barony Cassie; the border should run directly south from the western limits of the Kar’eer. The possibility of some division of this territory between Baronies Cassie and Neshomeh may be discussed.<br><br><b>On Araeph:</b> Baron Araeph’s repeated and lengthy absences render her status as baron over the cities of Borrd and Vaekew untenable. We propose that Barony Araeph should be reduced in the following fashion:<br><br>-The regions lying to the north of the western spur of the Larninkurv Mountains, the city of Borrd, and all lands between Borrd and the mountains, should pass to Barony Cassie.<br><br>-The land between the Larninkurv Mountains and the Lhawgin Heights, including the city of Vaekew and all lands south of the river, should pass to Barony Neshomeh. Baron Neshomeh should then be charged with the duty of restoring this region as swiftly as may be to its ancient status as the independent Duchy of El-Jheycom; the notion that warlike Chaett can be recreated as the Republic of Iric, while peaceful El-Jheycom is forever dissolved, is nonsensical in the extreme.<br><br>-The farmlands along the border between Baronies Araeph and Phobos, together with the costal woods in their entirety, should pass to Barony Phobos.<br><br>[[OOC note: you may notice a certain amount of El-Jheycom activism in the Baron’s statements. Remember, though, that no-one outside the EJ underground even knows that Kaitlyn was made Duchess - and the EJ underground have kept themselves fairly low key. Unless you’re in the underground yourself, do your best not to act on or mention knowledge you don’t have!]]<br><br><b>On Iric:</b> The closed borders of the Republic of Iric give us cause for grave concern. Their control over the unregulated Chaett and Iric trade routes, the unmonitored levels of immigration passing through La Wunj, and the <i>de facto</i> control Iric demonstrates over the Tumblar trade route, render the Republic a clear potential threat to the security of Konti-Nyuum.<br><br>We therefore propose that Castle Pankae be rebuilt and fortified by knights of Borrd, Wechi, and Ozerbord, and held as a garrison against possible threats from Iric. A full survey should be carried out of both the people and lands of Iric, and the records updated accordingly. Furthermore, the various trade routes should be placed under the authority of the Baronial Council, and taxed accordingly, said taxes to be used to improve the state of the western trade routes, and to fund the construction of a new port town at the Critta’ Gap.<br><br><b>On the ‘Tax Havens’:</b> The difficulty with the ‘tax havens’, those regions of Barony Huinesoron located beyond the borders of Ozerbord, is quite simply: residents and guilds within these regions pick and choose which laws they follow, electing to pay the lower taxes of Ozerbord without assuming any of the increased duties the Refuge requires of its citizens and knights. The solution to this problem is simple: to place these regions entirely within a single authority, with no alternate set of laws to retreat to.<br><br>Accordingly, we propose that the lands between the rivers Wep and Gu-Gel and the Hustit range be ceded to Barony Phobos; that the land between the Hustit and Wattuf ranges be ceded to the Refuge of Ozerbord; and that the southern region be divided from the midpoint of the Mountains of Reverence to the coast, with the western half being ceded to Ozerbord, and the eastern to Barony Neshomeh and the Commonwealth of Wechi.<br><br>[[OOC note: basically, Baron hS wants the Calbeck and Trevaya mines, and is trying to buy off Phobos with Critta’, and Neshomeh with the Wurtplai mine and the town of Risersh.]]<br><br><b>Other Matters:</b> We wish to express concern over the low frequency of assaults on the Marizu in recent times. As it is the duty of all Konti-Nyuum to fight against the dark arts of pla’tool, we propose that each baron should immediately raise an army appropriate to the population of their barony, and sail forth against the Marizu to wreak ruin upon them.<br><br>[[OOC note: This is just thematic fluff, really. But I couldn’t stop him. Sweet merciful, uh, Kanun and Spelin, this guy is obnoxious. I suspect he’ll get a bit less pompous when someone dares to contradict him…]]<br><br>~Huinesoron, Baron and Knight of Plort, Protector of Ozerbord, Custodian of Fanvik-Whirl, Marshal of the Order of Udisc, Scourge of the Marizu, Friend of Medellurth, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>

            <p>[[Disclaimer: Baron Dann is not me. He&#39;s distressingly like me, in that he tends to show up late to a good debate.]]<br><br><b>On Makari:</b> The continuing absence of Baron Makari has been a subject of many lamentations in the fair land of Iric. We believe that the dissolution of her barony at this point would be premature - many of our greatest knights have been abroad for longer, and yet returned safely to us. We would be willing to accept a guardianship of the barony, or the grant of such guardianship to Baron Vixenmage, until Baron Makari&#39;s eventual return.<br><br>We do not believe that the partition of the western highlands would be an acceptable compromise. These lands have been part of Iric and Chaett before it for generations, reaching back to the very Founding. Further, Baron Huinesoron has also proposed that tremendous regions of Borrd should be given to Baron Cassie&#39;s care, including the city of Borrd itself. We are reluctant to cede additional territory to a baron who already stands to gain such significant holdings.<br><br><b>On Iric:</b> We find it deeply disturbing that Baron Huinesoron is advocating for nothing less than the occupation of Iric and the seizure of our primary trade route. If Council money is to be spent on the matter, we suggest that it be spent on the creation of detailed charts of the waters between Tumblar and Borrd (to be carried out by the skilled sailors and knight-captains of La Wunj, of course). That and improvements on the Pankae Road would cost less than rebuilding and garrisoning the ruin of Pankae, and the increased trade volumes between Iric and Borrd would provide a revenue source, rather than the great expense of maintaining a garrison.<br><br>And truly, the divide is not that great. While our person makes the journey only infrequently, our brave Knights, the Book Repairman, Karrin the Blue, and many others make the voyage regularly. Trade flows freely, and our armies stand in the fields against Marizu shoulder-to-shoulder.<br><br><b>On Araeph:</b> The territorial discussions in western Konti-Nyuum are founded in ancient disputes, we have no desire to intrude there. On the eastern edges of Araeph&#39;s holdings, we would welcome a single holder of the Larninkurv Mountains - preferably one with the will and geographical skill to create a land route from Tumblar to Borrd. </p>

            <p>[[Character isn&#39;t 100% me, etc. etc. Also I&#39;m referencing the maps in the Cyclopaedia, so let me know if I&#39;m going off something out of date.]]<br><br>Good Barons, I know I am only a knight, but if you would hear me I do have some thoughts and questions to present at this discussion.<br><br><b>On Makari and Iric:</b> Forgive my ignorance, I know I speak only as someone who frequently visits Iric, but has Makari not been gone for a considerable amount of time, now? Her lands go practically ungoverned while we see no evidence she will - or can - return to them; I would support the idea that Baron Dann be granted guardianship, at the least. <br><br>Further, I agree with Baron Huinesoron that the closed borders of Iric and its domination of eastern trade provide a grave security concern even aside from the vast sums it costs the Union as a whole. However, to talk of a full occupation is absurd, and I fear it would result in war - even if Barons Dann and Vixenmage were to agree, the people there would never stand for it. Has the good Baron forgotten the bloody rebellion that led to Iric&#39;s establishment? Throwing the Union into war with itself is not the answer to our concerns.<br><br>Indeed, while I remind Baron Dann that Tumblar is Baron Cassie&#39;s territory and ask him to respect it as such, I find myself agreeing with much of what he has to say. Cooperation should be our watchword here; provided he allows captains from Borrd to aid in charting out the eastern waters, I have many experienced builders in my fief who constructed the road now connecting Godreve and Tumblar - I would be happy to send these tradesmen to help restore the Pankae Road and connect it with the work already done, if their safety can be guaranteed. Improving the Pankae Road and expanding the route from Godreve to meet it would do much to stabilise the border as well as allowing trade to continue flowing in both directions, something which can only be helped by the additional suggestion of building a land route connecting the Larninkurvs and Tumblar; I would gladly send builders for this project as well, perhaps starting on Araeph&#39;s side of the range. With the blessing of the Council I could even order them to push as far westward as the city of Borrd itself, connecting our capital with Cassie&#39;s barony and opening a trade route directly from Borrd to the Republic of Iric that doesn&#39;t require sailing through disputed waters. This would obviously be time-consuming, but it can be done.<br><br>Baron Dann is also correct that Baron Cassie stands to gain significant amounts of territory, but Dann himself would end up in control of nearly all of Iric should the idea as it stands be put into action. Ceding some territory as Baron Huinesoron suggested would be a show of good faith, especially with my people willing to put in so much work to connect our two nations.<br><br><b>On Araeph, the city of Borrd and the tax havens:</b> I find little to object to in Baron Huinesoron&#39;s proposal, but must admit I&#39;m not entirely comfortable with the idea of granting rule over the capital of the Union entirely to one baron or another; it feels to my mind an endorsement of that baron as king (or queen, as it were) of the Union as a whole, going against the very reason we <i>have</i> this system of barons instead of a supreme monarch. Perhaps it and the land immediately surrounding could be left to the ruling council, subject to the Union&#39;s laws but in fief to no one baron alone? I note also that Baron Phobos stands to gain much between this proposal and that for Baron Huinesoron&#39;s territories in Borrd; if he is to take so much of Baron Araeph&#39;s lands, perhaps the &quot;tax havens&quot; should instead be incorporated fully into Ozerboard? Their lawlessness cannot be tolerated, but the simplest answer would be to make it clear to them they are subject to the laws of the Refuge - and the penalties for defiance.<br><br>On the other hand, I must agree with Baron Phobos on at least one matter: this talk of re-establishing El-Jheycom as an independent nation right in the middle of Borrd is folly at best, madness at worst. Give the former territories to Wechi if we must, but to give a long-dead realm such as that full sovereignty is nonsense.</p>

            <p>The suggestion of Sir Ekyl that the road from Godreve be integrated into the trade network by the establishment of a highway to Borrd itself is welcomed by Baron Huinesoron.

            <p>However, while I would not presume to speak against Baron Cassie, remembering who I owe thanks for having a fief to begin with, I do feel it should be noted that she has oft been absent from her lands of late. Yes, this has never been as bad as the disappearance of Makari or the newly-returned Araeph, but many times when I have visited Ngort I&#39;ve found its corridors empty. I would follow any directive the baron gives, of course, but feel perhaps it is not something the Council should wait overlong for. This project would be a great boon to the Union&#39;s infrastructure, and every moment it is delayed is expensive for the people of this realm, be they from Borrd, Godreve, Tumblar or anywhere else.<br><br>[[Also mostly fluff, though bits in there are reflecting how Cassie doesn&#39;t seem around much of late, especially in a PG capacity, as well as just reflecting how Sir Ekyl wants to become a baron himself one day.]]</p>

            <p><b>On the Wip-Friwep basin:</b> Barony Huinesoron understands full well the grave circumstances that afflict this region. I myself have recently laboured long in the effort to preserve the former holdings of my long-departed friend Rohana, only to see her very home swallowed by the swollen earth. I, and my people, would welcome any aid Wechi can offer.<br><br>[[And Neshomeh, thank you for doing what I forgot to do - linking events in Plort to real-world events. Of course, that gives me ideas... &gt;:D]]<br><br>Let it not be thought, though, that this affliction is a new problem. Our northern borderlands have been plagued by such disasters since time immemorial. Who can forget the tremendous shaking of the earth which brought ruin to ancient Odolotos, second city of old Plort? The house of our earliest antiquities, the Theatre Leithian, the fabled Inn of the Unhinged Mind, the very Constitution of Plort itself - all were lost or threatened, and only the aid offered by Ozerbord and my own person saved anything from the crisis. At that time, Barony Huinesoron did not press its claim on Odolotos - which reticence was a clear mistake, for we doubt that Baron Phobos is even aware of its existence, let alone its historic import. The restoration of Odolotos which has occurred since the shaking has been solely as a result of Ozerbord&#39;s generosity.<br><br>[[Because the rescued Oddlots site is only linked from the Other Board these days, and no-one visits it...]]<br><br>Spurred by the suffering of my people between Wep and Friwep, I came to the Council seeking licence to aid them more directly - only to have them denounced as &#39;lawless&#39;, &#39;raiders&#39;, and &#39;smugglers&#39; by one who ought to be aiding me, and who seeks to claim these fertile lands for himself. The actions the noble Baron would take against the suffering people are unthinkable. And though it is not even to be thought of that the honourable baron could be behind the crisis, nevertheless it seems that such unnatural disasters are the work of powerful magic or gods - and I can attest that they have not been directed against the people from <i>my</i> barony.<br><br>~Baron Huinesoron</p>

            <p>Since we have a national anthem for the Union of Plort (“See Now, Konti-Nyuum&quot;), it seemed appropriate to write one for Ozerbord as well. It’s quite an unusual anthem, in that it’s actually <i>two</i> songs… sort of.<br><br>The population of Ozerbord varies dramatically. For most of the year, it is very low, but during the Games of Batveg, and other games and festivities across the year, it swells to ten or a hundred times its normal size.<br><br>During the low-population times of the year, Ozerbord’s anthem <i>Oh Ozerbord</i> - originally penned, no doubt, by Baron BeautyID - goes like this:<br><br><i>Oh lonely land<br>Oh quiet streets<br>Oh mighty Wattufs<br>Oh Ozerbord, we sing to thee</i><br><br>It is slow, with the final syllable of every line except the last being drawn out extensively. This is because those final syllables take the place of the second halves of the lines, which are sung only during festivals. They are sung much faster - think of the split in the opening lines of <i>Jerusalem</i>. The above is similar to ‘And did those feet…. in ancient times...’; the second halves are more in the style of ‘... walk upon England’s mountains green?’.<br><br><i>Oh lonely land - ring with a thousand voices clear!<br>Oh quiet streets - be filled with faces new and friends so dear!<br>Oh mighty Wattufs - we scale your heights and gaze on distant sea!<br>Oh Ozerbord - with a thousand tongues we sing to thee!</i><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I love the idea of using the Hypothetical Boarders, especially Lackidasical (if that&#39;s how you spell it? Not sure), &#39;cause she seems quite fun.<br>I laughed and laughed over the hullabaloo snippets. Actually, since I&#39;m using Rose in this story-thing, I could have a lot of fun over this... *inserts Evil Laugh© here*<br>Thank you so much, you&#39;re awesome as always. I might try to fit them in during Boom Town. Sort of.<br>Thanks again!<br><br>~Kitty</p>

            <p>It is... wow, <i>such</i> a misspelling, I never realised that, of &#39;lackadaisical&#39;, which according to the OED comes from &#39;one who is given to crying <i>Lackaday!</i>&#39;. So basically Legolas.<br><br>That&#39;s the second word I thought I knew which I&#39;ve had to look up today and find I was wildly wrong.

            <p>The thing is, I type my posts out on a Kobo Touch, meaning, you won&#39;t see many novel-length posts by me anytime soon. It also means I can&#39;t go back and forth to check spellings... I <i>knew</i> there was sonething wrong, but couldn&#39;t quite place it. »-« <br>I immediately associated the name &#39;Lacksidacksical&#39; with &#39;lacksidaisy&#39; because it was a nonsense word I once heard that meant &#39;scatterbrained&#39;.

            <p>Hello peoples of the PPC.<br><br>I have come back from the shadowy graves of the dead to announce to you this. The PPC has done something useful! It has given me material for a book. <br><br>A book you say? What sort of book? <br><br>Why a book about fantasy fiction tropes! Called... <i>the Tropes of Fantasy Fiction</i>.  (<a href="http://amzn.com/0786478586"><a href="http://amzn.com/0786478586">http://amzn.com/0786478586</a></a>  <br>Because of my time here at the PPC I started realizing the nature of cliches and tropes. This combined with the work I&#39;ve done with the Inheritance series and other bad written books, I&#39;ve managed to pull together a book that tries to answer the question/idea of &quot;Why aren&#39;t fantasy books all the same, if they all use the same ideas over and over again?&quot; and &quot;Why aren&#39;t all of them cliched if they do use the same things over and over again.&quot; <br><br>You&#39;ll have to read the book to find the answer, because it&#39;d take me a book to answer it. XD<br><br>Also, to the delight of you all, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d love to know that I <i>do</i> use the PPC as an example at one point in the book as I discuss the concept of Meta-Fiction. <br><br>So, go forth and drive up my Amazon pre-order numbers! :D  </p>

            <p>If any Boarders are interested in getting to know me in person, I&#39;ll be at MatsuriCon tomorrow, though it&#39;ll only be a Saturday pass because of college. I plan to take sketch commissions while I&#39;m there, just to raise a buck or two. I&#39;m currently scraping together a hasty 2-minute cosplay as Haruka from Free!<br><br>Now, on a totally unrelated note...<br><br>This is marginally related to the PPC only in concept, but it&#39;s based on the same idea of a Mary Sue hunting agency so I&#39;m leaving it here anyway. I&#39;ve had a weird story idea based on a combination of <a href="http://skarmorysilver.tumblr.com/post/95374597091/woodmeat-chevy-raised-jack-daniels-fed">a post on Tumblr</a> and some of my own fiction in progress works. One of my major undertakings is a mega-crossover (apologies in advance to those who aren&#39;t fond of those) and one of the subplots involves canons hunting Mary Sues like Agents do here at the PPC. The Tumblr post I linked to above, which in part speculates on pizza delivery hitmen, gave me the idea of a Mary Sue extermination facility masquerading as a cross-dimensional food catering and delivery service. You can place an order as normal, but if you want a Sue disposed of, you can provide a &quot;special request&quot; and send the information they need along with the order. &quot;Make sure Selenapaeia Shimmeryn Rupeehide does NOT reach Hyrule Castle. Oh, and hold the mayo on my BLT.&quot;<br><br>I plan to have Violet Parr from The Incredibles (as usual) as the protagonist of this particular story (working under the agency as a first job), with Danny Fenton from the Danny Phantom TV series as a deuteragonist who joins the agency after Vi makes a successful delivery to his continuum. This of course means I&#39;ll have to balance the &quot;job&quot; with keeping all the involved canons in character, which will be a pretty hard task but I might be able to pull it off. Thoughts on all this are much appreciated, of course.<br><br>P.S. The catering service will tentatively be called &quot;Mystery Meatball Catering and Delivery&quot;, or just &quot;Mystery Meatball&quot;, after their signature dish. I think you can guess what it&#39;s made of. ;P</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve decided that my first &quot;serious&quot; riffing will be of the worst of the worst of the absolute worst- <i>My Immortal</i>.

Also note that there is <i>some</i> salty language on my part, and later chapters contain bits of rage against the author. although I try to keep myself cleaner than the actual &#39;fic.)</p>

            <p>So, I woke up at 5.30am to watch Deep Breath with my brother. It was. Amazing. I was afraid that I&#39;d be missing Matt Smith too much to focus, but as soon as the conversation about the purpose of bedrooms started, I was completely sold. Hilarious. Also, a Scottish man in his dressing gown, on the roof in the middle of the night, yelling out an apology to a combusting dinosaur. That embraces the spirit of Doctor Who so brilliantly. <br>Only Steven Moffat could make a sequel to an episode that was 6 seasons ago. I was grinning and hoping the Doctor would mention Rose. (He didn&#39;t. :-P)<br>Finally, Missy. There&#39;s speculation all over that she&#39;s the Master, the Rani, River Song, a future Doctor and a ham salad samwich. But I think she&#39;s Bernice from the 7th Doctor novels. Why?<br>&quot;Welcome to Heaven!&quot;<br><br>Right! Speculation time!<br><br>~Kitty<br></p>

            <p>...I&#39;d like to ask three questions, so I can get some community feedback. I mean, I&#39;ve been here for about a month now, but I&#39;ve been binging on the PPC the entire time and I&#39;ve read the permission rules, so I believe I know what I&#39;m doing. I REALLY don&#39;t want to look like I&#39;m rushing things, unlike a certain individual who was sent away recently.<br><br>1.) Will I need to write both the control prompt AND the random prompt for the permission request? And since I already have the control prompt beta-reviewed and fixed up, is it acceptable to post it for public review?<br><br>2.) Is it acceptable to claim an RC number prior to obtaining permission? If so, may I kindly take RC 227 (in reference to my Pokedex number)?<br><br>3.) I wonder if I can get official permission by the end of this month, seeing as I feel prepared. However, if I can&#39;t get permission at this time (given that again, I&#39;ve only been on the Board for a month or so and most Boarders take a bit longer to know the community), would this coming autumn term (i.e. sometime mid-September) be acceptable instead?<br><br>Thank you for your response. Lookin&#39; forward to doin&#39; business with ya! :)</p>

<li>Yes, we want to see one of each. Just one in the suggested length range wouldn&#39;t be much to go on.<br><br>As for posting for public review, I&#39;d advise against it. People often chime in on Permission threads, so you&#39;ll get feedback then. Posting a story twice could be a little attention-grabby.<br><br>2. You can have one in mind, but no, you can&#39;t actually claim one until you have Permission.<br><br>3. I can only speak for myself here, but I feel like I&#39;ve seen you around enough to have an idea of who you are, so I wouldn&#39;t turn you down for asking too soon. However, you should do whatever makes you feel more comfortable and confident. The stronger you feel about your request when you ask, the better. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>Obviously the pie charts (helpfully linked by Miah below) show a lot of the data - and, frankly, it&#39;s not very <i>useful</i> data, though interesting. But the essay questions are less easy to read.<br><br>Enter me! I&#39;ve taken the &#39;what can be improved&#39; questions and turned them into handy tallies.<br><br><b>How do you think the PPC can improve as a community?</b><br><br>No suggestions ---  13<br>Community activities and interaction  ---  7<br>Goodfic threads   ---  3<br>React quicker to problems  ---  3<br>Be more lenient ---  2<br>Improve writing skills  ---  2<br>More people  ---  1<br>Mods  ---  1<br>New Board  ---  1<br>More swearing  ---  1<br>More obscure fandoms  ---  1<br><br>It&#39;s quite gratifying to see that half of the responders either think the community is fine, or can&#39;t actually think of anything to say... good! The comment about community interaction is already being responded to, but bears emphasising. As for that strange dichotomy between people who think we&#39;re too hard on offenders, and people who think we&#39;re not harsh enough... and that strange response which says &#39;We didn&#39;t react quickly enough! And also we reacted too quickly!&#39;... well, I&#39;m just presenting the data.<br><br><b>How do you think the PPC as a universe can improve?</b><br><br>Interaction between spinoffs  ---  10<br>No suggestions  ---  6<br>More world-building  ---  3<br>More stories  ---  3<br>Take it less seriously/have more fun  ---  3<br>More/more obscure fandoms  ---  2<br>Less gadgets  ---  1<br>More Sues-as-villains  ---  1<br>Fanart  ---  1<br>More prep time for new writers  ---  1<br>Take it more seriously  ---  1<br><br>Psst - guys - I think people want to see more intertextuality. And more stories. It&#39;s just a guess, though.<br><br>Obviously these summaries lose a lot of the details - but that&#39;s why the original results are still there!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It looks like lots of people want to see more interactions/cameos/crossovers between spinoffs.

            <p>So far, the only person I&#39;ve done a collab mission with was Randa, and since we see each other every day at achool, it&#39;s not too difficult to get our thoughts in order and toss ideas back and forth. World-Jumper and I haven&#39;t been able to work on The Lost Land in a while since he&#39;s been so busy... <br><br>But basically, I&#39;d like to do more missions with other people!

            <p>Maybe some points for including points for very old spinoffs (like 2005 or some other positively ancient number) as an encouragement toward that stuff getting more reads?</p>

            <p>Also, I agree with whomever mentioned liking it if things would be a little more grounded now and then - everything being off the wall madness gets boring and eventually sorta undermines the lived-in feel some of the better spinoffs give HQ. But that could just be my naturally serious demeanour.</p>

            <p>some of the choices don’t really fit. Like:<br><br>Do you write original stories? Actually I did, forty-five years ago.

I don’t know. It depends (see answer to previous question). &quot;Nearly never&quot; doesn’t count PPC missions/interludes and beta reading.<br><br>When did you start reading fanfiction? I may have read fanfiction before I even knew what fanfiction is, long before 2000.

            <p>(Sorry for the long delay, I&#39;m ridiculously busy at times these days.)<br><br>Regarding the choices, those are all excellent ones to bring up, and were actually ones I had addressed with the 2012 version of the survey. <br><br>Unfortunately since between when I made that one and now, they changed the format entirely so I couldn&#39;t copy the survey wholesale and modify and make improvements that way (like I had done with previous years). Since it would take more time than I have available to remake it entirely, I decided against including those for the time being. Assuming I&#39;m still alive in 2015 and Google doesn&#39;t update how the forms are made again, those will be making a return then.<br><br>And as for the graphs for both questions, the questions make those graphs blow up, so that they don&#39;t actually display. Probably due to too many options for what I&#39;m guessing would&#39;ve been a pie graph.</p>

            <p>This was originally posted on my blog, but I wanted to share.<br>Have you ever done this in public? Like, just for fun?<br>So, my brother and I go down to the park quite frequently. It’s a nice little place; a big football oval with a playground, cricket nets, a clubhouse, and a big parking lot that kinda ruins the imagery. Usually there’s a lot of people around there, which makes it the perfect place to heckle people. Fandom style.<br><br>This includes stories from Harry Potter, Skulduggery Pleasant, Fairy Tail, Doctor Who, and Calvin and Hobbes: the Series. Enjoy.<br> <br><b>Harry Potter Style</b><br><br>The girl on the swing stopped abruptly, staring at the girl and the younger boy who had just stalked past, carrying sticks.<br><br>“You said the Horcrux was around here somewhere, Ron!” the girl with the stick scowled.<br><br>The boy pouted. He had a ginger wig on. “Bloody hell, Hermione, I know. There’s no need to heckle me. Wait.” He shook his stick in the air. “Findinamus thingajigamus!”<br><br>‘Hermione’ used a laser pointer to project a red dot onto the wall. “There it is, Ron! Come on, let’s go find Harry!’<br><br>“Apparate!” ‘Ron’ cheered. They both made crack noises simultaneously, and ran out of sight. A short few seconds later, the girl ran back in, and pointed her stick at the other girl who had by now stopped swinging, and was now just staring.<br><br>“Obliviate!” she snapped, and stalked off. “Bloody muggles…”<br><br> <br><br><b>Skulduggery Pleasant Style</b><br><br>“Hi.” A girl with long dark hair and a business suit strolled up to the two sisters that were playing in the sandbox. “Did you happen to see anything large, black, and hairy dashing past here, making howling noises?”<br><br>The sisters exchanged glances. “…no,” the older one said.<br><br>The girl in the suit sighed dramatically. “Well, if you see one, just let me know.” She turned, and made to leave.<br><br>“Wait,” the younger girl stopped her. “Why are you carrying a stick?”<br><br>The girl in the suit glanced down. She was indeed carrying a long stick. “It was my birthday present.”<br><br>“Your birthday present?!“<br><br>“Yeah. My…uh, friend, he gave me a stick for my birthday. And I just laughed because I thought it was a joke. But he didn’t laugh, and now I have a stick. It doesn’t even do much, and it wasn’t even my birthday.”<br><br>“Ohhh….kay.”<br><br>“Just yell for us if you see anything hairy and big, ‘kay?” the girl smiled, and walked off around the corner.<br><br>“Wait,” the older girl called. “What’s your name?”<br><br>“Valkyrie Cain,” came the response.<br><br><b>Fairy Tail Style</b><br><br>“Run, Natsu, run!” yelled the girl, dashing across the field, and interrupting the football game, in progress. “Phantom Lord is coming.”<br><br>“Got it, Luce,” nodded the boy with spiky salmon-pink hair. He turned to the imaginary foe behind him. “KARYU NO HOKO!”<br><br>Nothing happened, but he appeared satisfied, and followed his friend past the footballers, who were frozen in surprise. The girl flicked her blonde wig over her shoulder and marched up to the kiosk. “Excuse me, I’m Lucy Heartfilla, and I’m here on behalf of the International Guilds of Fiore, Fairy Tail division. This is my partner, Natsu Dragneel, and we need to tell you all to evacuate immediately.”<br><br>Everyone stared at ‘Lucy’, who couldn’t have been more than 13 years old.<br><br>“Get outta here, kid,” the man at the kiosk said eventually.<br><br>“You’ll be sorry for this!” yelled the boy, shaking his fist.<br><br><b>Doctor Who Style</b><br><br>Rustling came from the bushes to the left of the cricket net.<br><br>“Just need to sonic it,” said a decidedly British accent, with a touch of Scottish.<br><br>More shuffling.<br><br>“Oi! Watch it, Spaceman!” came an American voice.<br><br>“Donna, move to the side. I can’t reach the node.”<br><br>The six year old who had been listening to this reached curiously over to peek behind the branches.<br><br>“ACK!” yelled a boy with a brown trench coat and a pin-striped suit. “The Sontarans have got us!”<br><br>“You’re overreacting, Martain Boy,” snorted a girl with a ginger wig on. “That’s no alien, unless the Sontarans have found out a way to get toddlers to work for them.”<br><br>The boy in the coat scratched his head. “Well, I wouldn’t put it past them.”<br><br>“See, watch this.” The girl bent down to talk to the toddler. “You aren’t a deadly infestation from the planet Sontar, are you?”<br><br>The toddler shook his head.<br><br>“See?”<br><br><b>Calvin and Hobbes: the Series Style</b><br><br>“Sherman, have you got the Time Machine working yet?” the girl spoke into the phone. She listened for a moment. “No, this is Kitty, not Socrates pranking you again. I’m pretty sure Calvin’s trapped Socrates in the basement so he can’t mess this up. And Hobbes is right here.” She patted a stuffed tiger that was sitting next to her. “He wants to talk to you.”<br><br>She held the phone up to the tigers mouth for a minute, before switching back. “Anything Andy needs to tell me?”<br><br>She then noticed the whole of the park staring at her. “What’re you all looking at?”<br><br><b>Doctor Who Style, Take Two </b><br><br>“Professor!” shrieked the girl from the last five-or-so stories, dashing behind a tree.<br><br>“Hold on, Ace!” a tiny person reached out his umbrella and hooked her around the middle, dragging her to ‘safety’. “I think we could use some explosives.”<br><br>The girl grinned and patted her rucksack. “The explosives I’m not supposed to officially have?”<br><br>“Well, I won’t look.”<br><br>---<br><br>Share your own stories, people!<br><br>~Kitty</p>

            <p>When Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas used to storm the playground and hunt orcs across the soccer field, when Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker dueled late into the night to the sound of &quot;Duel of the Fates.&quot; Yeah, my mom and brother don&#39;t role-play with me anymore. 😔<br><br>One of my Real Life friends who&#39;s read Homestuck is up for a little joking role-play sometimes though. We went to a study group together that had annual performances and the last one, I went wearing black and purple, carrying a pair of knitting needles, and of course it helped that I naturally look quite a lot like Rose Lalonde anyway. Of course, he hadn&#39;t been expecting it, so he just doubled over laughing for about five minutes. Everyone else was just sort of staring at us in confusion, and finally someone asked me why I was holding knitting needles. He said, &quot;They aren&#39;t just knitting needles. They&#39;re the Thorns of Oglogoth.&quot; And then I started laughing too and everyone was confused.<br><br>My brother and I also used to spar in our front yard (our back yard was too small). It&#39;s the most effective thing to keep the trespassers out, having two people standing there heaving big pieces of sharp-looking metal at each other. Sometimes I still use the front to practice archery. I&#39;m very lucky to live in a place where stuff like that&#39;s legal. 😄</p>

            <p>So, I understand that a Mini is a creature that comes into existence when a word associated with a particular fandom is misspelled - Aragig, Baromor, ETC - but there are multiple fandoms that could generate many different types of minis. For example, Pokemon has over 600 of the little and big  goobers running around - so are they just miniaturized versions of their canon creatures, or what? <br><br>Another mini-related mystery in this multitude of manic...question synonym that begins with M... is the origins of the creatures to begin with. Whence forth doth the minis come from? Are they energy before they are brought into being, are they from another dimension...what?<br><br>Third: There are many minis that aren&#39;t of biological origins - mini Telescreens, mini robots (LOTS of those), etc. How do they eat? Drink? Make merry? <br><br>I have checked the wiki a multitude of times on this subject, and while it has been of great help, I didn&#39;t find the answers to THOSE questions.<br><br>So...what are the theories? <br><br></p>

            <p>I like the idea of minis being created as something for the Word World to refer to when the canon name is not correct- in my headcanon, this means that minis will actually perform the action or description that the misspelling is involved in (if such action exceeds the mini&#39;s regular capabilities, i.e. a character kisses Rtas Vadummy or Tail&#39;zora pilots a shuttle, it will either demonstrate new powers or do the best it can, then revert to normal immediately afterward).<br><br>In terms of where they exist before they&#39;re &quot;invoked&quot;, probably the same non-place as characters who have yet to be introduced. I usually refer to creating something new in a story as &quot;pulling from the possibility foam&quot;.<br><br>As for what they eat, they can likely survive on anything that would feed their original creature (or nothing if said creature does not need to eat), but all can also consume a variety of literary materials including punctuation, physical media containing their canon (or other written materials?), and glitter- this last is likely most interesting, as they are uniquely immune to its corrupting properties and will actively eat Sues if given the opportunity.</p>

            <p>Okay, so in a Badfic, when a name comes up it refers to something. When the name is misspelled, it doesn&#39;t refer to the same thing, so the badfic generates something to recieve the action- a Mini.<br><br>Also, Poké-minis are Missingno..</p>

            <p>First: Pokemon minis are mini-Missingno, which is a glitch Pokemon from the Generation I games. The page should specify whether a continuum has more than one mini type and what those types are.<br><br>Second: I would assume they&#39;re a form of energy, too, but you can&#39;t safely convert mass into energy (or vice versa) unless you&#39;re in Star Trek. Then again, Word Worlds are definitely weird enough to ignore the laws of thermodynamics and physics (temporarily). (The other dimension idea sounds <i>cool</i>)<br><br>Third: Technically, as inorganic beings, they don&#39;t need to eat. I think they respond to human food, though; I specifically remember that Thomas Greenwall adopted Witmol the mini-Telescreen by using a chocolate bar as a bribe. *shrug*</p>

            <p>Pokemon has <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini/Pok%C3%A9mon">mini-Missingno.s and mini-Deoxyi</a> (I think that&#39;s how you spell that?). Yu-Gi-Oh! minis, for example, take shape of the ace monster of the misspelled character - for example, Yugy Mutou is a mini-Dark Magician, Jooy Wheeler is a mini-Red-Eyes B. Dragon, Yuma Tsukamo is a mini-No. 39: Utopia, etc.<br>The big rule is: whoever writes the OFU for the particular verse gets to decide about the mini. If there&#39;s no OFU around, whoever finds the first mini gets to decide what it&#39;s like - for example, I was the first person to find <i>Teletubbies</i> minis, so I decided they&#39;re mini-Noo-Noos.<br>As to where they come from... they come from the same place punctuation showers come from. What they live on depends on the breed. I&#39;m pretty sure mini-Reapers eat temporal paradoxes, and it&#39;s known that mini-Balrogs like bacon and eggs. Mm, bacon...</p>

            <p>Over the weekend, my house has suffered from sudden and complete loss of internet access. Fair enough, but the details are a bit... weird.<br><br>First off, the telephone still works (and yes, it is a landline). Secondly, according to the router, we&#39;re still getting ADSL signal(?), with attenuation data and what I think are up and down speeds (which are ludicrously slow, but that&#39;s another issue entirely). We&#39;re just... not getting internet through it. In terms of the lights on the router, ADSL is green, but Internet is red.<br><br>I&#39;m as sure as I can be that it&#39;s not an internal wiring issue - I&#39;ve tested the router plugged directly into the test socket right where the cable comes into the house, with alternate wires for everything, and poked the connections besides. I&#39;m also pretty sure it&#39;s not the router itself, having tested an alternate - but we&#39;re a tiny bit uncertain as to whether the alternate was ever set up correctly. (I have a third alternate I&#39;ll test when I get home)<br><br>So... does anyone know what might be causing this? Could the settings on the router have gotten messed up in such a way that would lead to this outcome? Since it&#39;s the router lights that show the problem, I&#39;m guessing it can&#39;t be the computer.<br><br><a href="http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1890657">This site</a> suggests that one of the two cables from outside could be damaged, and says there should be a voltage across them - since I don&#39;t have a voltmeter, anyone know how I could check that?<br><br>(Needless to say, my provider has been no help at all - they&#39;ve had me restart the router, done a useless line test, then scheduled an engineer for the 11th September. Because two weeks without internet = my idea of fun!)<br><br>hS doesn&#39;t know where else to turn</p>

            <p>Gaah, router problems. Had enough of those to hate &#39;em. Two things I can think about are:<br>a) The router overheats. If it&#39;s hot to the touch and/or in a cramped space, it might be the cause of your problem - more probable if the router is a few years old.<br>b) As you&#39;ve said, the router&#39;s settings are Glauronged. I&#39;d do two things to check that: first, ping both the router, a random website, and that website&#39;s IP via cmd. If the router pings but the others don&#39;t, the problem is probably in the router. If nothing pings the problem is in the router - it probably means it&#39;s either screwed up setting-wise or it&#39;s a physical problem. If the IP and the router ping but the site itself doesn&#39;t you probably have a DNS problem; resetting your computer&#39;s network adapter sometimes helps, but otherwise the problem is on the ISP&#39;s side and you should talk to them. <br>Second, you can check the router&#39;s settings directly. To do that, you need to use ipconfig to find your default gateway (which is your router&#39;s IP, basically). Once you have that, input that into any browser and you&#39;ll probably get a settings page; you also usually get a connection indicator of sorts.<br><br>Without more info about your router - namely, its model and some config info - I can&#39;t really help, and that&#39;s not exactly info you want to post on the Net.</p>

            <p>At least, I&#39;m <i>pretty</i> sure it can&#39;t be the computer - neither the PC, nor the laptop, nor my phone can connect through any of the routers. The only way I can see it <i>not</i> being an external problem is if the PC is somehow corrupting each router when I try to connect - but that seems a bit overpowered even for Vista, particularly since at least one of the routers is password-locked.<br><br>So it&#39;s an outside problem. So I get to wait two weeks for them to send someone round to tell me that, and then wait however much longer for them to actually do something about it. Yippee.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yes, it&#39;s the ISP. When their techie comes, tell him what I&#39;ve told you here. Also, if any of your neighbours have the same ISP, ask them if they&#39;re having Internet problems - that might give you an inkling of the problem&#39;s size.</p>

            <p>At least not with the hardware I&#39;m familiar with.<br><br>From my experience, the modem is a separate box that connects to the cable the ISP pipes into your home. It&#39;s either connected directly to a computer, or connected to a router. The router&#39;s job is to split that signal, giving you around 4 more wired internet connections and Wi-fi.<br><br>My own house has two &quot;modems&quot;, one splits off signals for the house and signals for a second modem.<br><br>Yours may be a lot different, but that&#39;s how it&#39;s done in Tennessee.</p>

<br><b>Pinkamena</b> - Marizu leader. Sworn enemy of the knight Jumper.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>This implies that Pinkamena!Pinkie Pie is not only alive, but leading other Sues, in the Protectorate of Plort-verse.<br>This leads me to the idea that Pinkamena cannot attack canon on her own anymore, as her own impact on canon is nil- so instead, she leads other Sues into attacking MLP, instructing them to bring her along for the ride.<br><br>Another idea is that she <i>wants</i> the &quot;quick death&quot; prescribed to her in the sporking but keeps being brought back into badfics by other Sues, and after said sporking has a healthy fear of them.<br><br>However, personally, I prefer the zombie idea (for when Cupcakes is actually referred to or even reenacted in a fanfic that had no need for Cupcakes to even be brought up in order to function) or the imitator idea (for when Cupcakes is not referred to as happening in the badfic, we just have a replacement!Pinkie Pie that happens to kill ponies and may or may not be referred to as Pinkamena)</p>

            <p>In &quot;Cupcakes,&quot; Pinkamena!Pinkie Pie (henceforth referred to as Cupcakes!Pinkie Pie to distinguish from imitators) predates the episode &quot;Party of One,&quot; and therefore is <i>not</i> specified to have straight hair because Pinkie Pie with straight hair wasn&#39;t a thing at all. Also, she is depicted as wearing a dress made of sewn-together pony rawhide and pegasus wings, and a necklace of unicorn horns, and nowhere in the fic is she referred to as &quot;Pinkamena.&quot;<br><br><img src="http://i1012.photobucket.com/albums/af247/Dawnrider-kitty/Cupcakes2.png" alt="Cupcakes!Pinkie Pie in all of her grimdark glory."><br><br>Typically, however, Pinkamena!Pinkie Pie is depicted as naked, has the straight hair from &quot;Party of One,&quot; and nine times out of ten is referred to as &quot;Pinkamena&quot; at least once, giving a LOT of credence to the copycat idea.</p>

            <p>It came up on an old buried thread, but basically Cupcakes is a &quot;node&quot; that connects all of its spinoffs to MLP proper. Take it out, and all the others collapse as well, or at least become cut off and can&#39;t affect MLP:FiM any more.</p>

            <p>Hi there guys. I&#39;m James Shields. I may call me James. <br><br>I feel I have lurked around PPC enough. I got to know you guys through Tv Tropes. Since then I have read every relevant introductory material, including The Original Series of course, a good deal of spin off series and plenty of the wiki pages. So I figured it was time I joined The Board. <br><br>I am from Brazil, my first language is Portuguese, though I pride myself enough on my English that plan on taking translation as my career choice. <br><br>I have plenty of major fandoms so lets break this down a little bit <br><br>Animanga: Nanoha, Sakura, Sailor Moon and most slice-of-life stuff <br><br>Cartoons: MLP:Fim and Arthur <br><br>Literature: Harry Potter, Anne of Green Gables, A Little Princess, 1984, Brave New World and Les Miserables <br><br>Tv shows: How I met your mother and Brothers and Sisters <br><br>Videogames: Mass Effect  <br><br>Visual Novels: Kana: Little Sister, Katawa Shoujo and Clannad <br><br>Also among the spin off, I love Firemagic and Sergioturbo&#39;s stuff, Unpleasent Memories and All Done With This Niceness and Negotiation Stuff are my favorite missions.   <br><br>So... that&#39;s about it. Hope that wasn&#39;t too much of an Info Dump. If I have left anything to be ask, ask away! </p>

            <p>This question makes me think. The wiki&#39;s article on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Oldbie">oldbies</a> says oldbies are people who&#39;ve stayed around for two or three years. I fit that description, but I feel more like a midbie because there are &quot;older&quot; people here (PPC-wise). Is the article outdated, or am I really an oldbie and I just don&#39;t notice that?</p>

            <p>Good to know regarding the goodfic part. I&#39;d really like to see an agent from you from the Harry Potter continuum, we need more of those to deal with magical Sues!<br><br>And to answer your question...<br><br>&quot;The Fwooper is a magical African bird with brightly-coloured feathers, which can include orange, pink, lime green and yellow. Listening to the Fwooper&#39;s song will drive the listener insane, so each bird must be sold with a Silencing Charm placed on it. [...] Uric the Oddball once tried to convince the Wizards&#39; Council that the Fwooper song was actually beneficial to a Wizard&#39;s health, and listened to it continuously for three months. His presentation did not go well, when he turned up wearing nothing but a toupee that, on closer examination, was revealed to be a dead badger.&quot; [<a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fwooper">source</a>]<br><br>Crimsun is one of the colors on the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sue_Colour_Spectrum">Sue Spectrum</a>, which refers to impossible, notoriously eye-burning colors produced when a Suethor misspells or mishandles colors in a badfic. Crimsun is &quot;a disturbing mixture of hot pink, lime green, and orange&quot;, and since Fwoopers come in all three colors, I figured it fit quite nicely.</p>

            <p>Yes, as Firemmagic noted all of my missions and interludes are named after Culture spacecraft, though the prelude isn&#39;t and one of them (&quot;End in Tears&quot;) is actually a Rock - mobile space habitat. An OU is basically a Culture fighter craft, and out of all Culture ship types they&#39;re the most... morally disagreeable as they&#39;re built to love war.<br>As to my favourite Nanoha goodfic... I think <a href="http://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/game-theory-nanoha-fanfic.1298/">Game Theory</a> and its sequel <a href="http://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/power-games-nanoha-fanfic.1294/">Power Games</a> are a safe bet.</p>

            <p>((Welcome one and all to the Rudi&#39;s RP! Make yourselves at home.<br><br>Just a reminder before we get started: this is meant to be a fun RP, not something dramatic. Please don&#39;t start serious things like a Suvian invasion or a murder or a second Blackout during the RP. This is meant to be a slice-of-life type thing focusing on agent interactions. Don&#39;t forget to read the Wiki&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Rudi%27s">description</a> of the pub so that we&#39;re all on the same page. Furthermore, please be considerate of other people&#39;s schedules and time zones while waiting for an answer to your post.<br><br>Here&#39;s the prompt: <i>Your agents have just been through a long day and need a pick-me-up. They drag their weary bodies to Rudi&#39;s for some drinks and a chat with some colleagues-- if they feel up to it.</i><br><br>Standard rules apply: no controlling other people&#39;s agents (actions, speech, thoughts, or interactions with objects), no starting fights, no provoking a HQ-wide emergency, and no shoes in the pool. Please write all posts in third-person past tense for a uniform style. Canonicity in the PPCverse is optional according to the writer. <b>Permission is not required to participate</b>.<br><br><br>All righty then. Have fun!))<br><br>- - - - <br><br>Rudi&#39;s pub was one of PPC HQ&#39;s oldest and most well-known drinking establishments. It was usually crowded with agents from all departments-- Action and Infrastructure alike-- drinking, eating, chatting, relaxing, and laughing away the day&#39;s troubles. Today was no different: the pub was almost completely full.<br><br>A pair of Spies sat at the bar, each nursing a drink. The one on the left adjusted his navy blue bowtie and took a sip from his cup of drinking chocolate as the blond Spy on the right toyed with a golden pocket watch with both hands. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s called the &#39;Dead Ringer&#39;,&quot; explained Gaspard. &quot;It allows you to fake your death by turning you invisible for a handful of seconds and dropping a fake corpse of yourself if you get hit.&quot;<br><br>Harris opened the pocket watch by pressing on a button next to the watch&#39;s crown. Instead of a watch face, there was a circle of blue lights. &quot;Hit how hard?&quot; he asked. &quot;A punch? A poke?&quot;<br><br>The half-Chinese agent did a vague hand motion. &quot;Anything that can cause a bruise or worse. You&#39;re still gonna get hurt, except about... ninety percent less. That means that if you take a bullet to the gut, you&#39;re only going to suffer one-tenth of the injury you would have received if this thing wasn&#39;t on.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ninety percent less?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s how the game calculates damage. I actually haven&#39;t met anyone here who used the DR, so I can&#39;t give you any examples of people who used it in HQ.&quot;<br><br>Harris closed the watch cover with his thumb and slipped the Dead Ringer into his waistcoat&#39;s pocket. He picked up his cup of coffee and said: &quot;No matter. It&#39;s not like I get caught anyways, haha! Anyways, thank you very much for the birthday present. It&#39;s nice of you to remember it. Besides you, Penny, and Sonia... well, it&#39;s been quiet.&quot;<br><br>Gaspard nodded and returned to his drink. Harris wasn&#39;t a bad person <i>per se</i>, but had an unfortunate tendency to <i>make</i> bad things happen around him. Fortunately, Bulldog had partnered him with badfic recruit Sonia of Ylisse so that &quot;Disaster Magnet&quot; Frost had at least one pair of eyes on him at all times. So far, Sonia had done a good job of keeping Harris out of trouble. Gaspard hoped that it would stay that way-- for everyone&#39;s sake.<br><br>The junior agent swivelled around in his bar seat so that he faced the room. He looked at the groups of agents huddled around tables, standing by the wall, or milling around the arcade machines and dartboards. <i>How was their day?</i> Gaspard wondered to himself. <i>What stories would they tell if they were asked?</i></p>

            <p>((Thought about joining the fun again. Also thought about testing an idea I had long ago.))<br><br>Captain Navare – he kept his rank as a reminder of his origin, even if nothing but a title – stepped through a portal into his RC. His partner, the <i>Culture</i>-verse Drone Amlis (whose Full Name was a bit too long for Navare to remember despite having been partnered with it for three months or so), floated in after him and used his Effector to close the portal.<br><br>“Another mission accomplished,” the Drone said in its deep voice, its Aura Fields red with pleasure.<br>“Quite,” Navare replied, letting go of his rifle-shaped Device; the AI transformed into its standby mode and settled as a small pistol into Navare&#39;s side-holster.<br><br>The <i>Game Theory</i>-verse Mage sighed, feeling very tired all of a sudden. “Amlis,” he said, “let&#39;s do something else this time. I don&#39;t think I can stand a post-mission simulation right now.”<br><br>The Drone bobbed in the air – its version of a shrug. “If so you wish,” it said, gunmetal – which signified puzzlement – seeping into its Aura Field slowly. “Why, though?”<br><br>“I feel tired, all of a sudden,” Navare replied. “My scars ache, too.” It was true; he felt a throbbing pain in his right hand, which, while he was still a bit character in a badfic, was shot off. His expression became morose as the memories of the story resurfaced. None of them were pleasant, and he was thankful that most of the time he didn&#39;t have to remember them.<br><br>Amlis monitored Navare&#39;s vitals and decided a change of pace was in order. “Alright,” it said, its Aura Fields turning yellow (approachability), “tell you what: let&#39;s take a table at Rudi&#39;s. The company will do you good.”<br><br>Navare shrugged, but followed the Drone as it remotely opened the RC&#39;s door and floated to the generically grey corridors outside.<br><hr>
<br>The duo arrived at Rudi&#39;s just as a certain axe-wielding agent left the pub. Amlis led his partner to a table that was already set for one person, watched as the human sat down and put his head in his arms, then settled down itself on the table; its ellipsoidal body took no more than half of its surface area. It made a show of rotating its casing hither and to, as though looking for someone or something...</p>

            <p>((So, here are the two most likely Agents I’ll be submitting someday in the distant future. It’s possible that if/when I get to Permissions this will become an Interlude, I’m not totally sure. Eric’s an old RP character whose game died, and Helen is actually the surviving Sue from this mission: <a href="http://uncommon-comma.livejournal.com/992.html"><a href="http://uncommon-comma.livejournal.com/992.html">http://uncommon-comma.livejournal.com/992.html</a></a>))<br><br>Eric caught his partner’s arm, hauling her back around as she tried to go back down the hall. She resisted, but despite being shorter, the teenage boy was able to keep her from retreating. The scarred blonde glared at him.<br>&quot;I changed my mind!&quot;<br>&quot;Helen, they’re not going to tackle you to the floor or sic Minis on you or anything. Some of them are Ex-Sues too, remember? Maybe you’ll see some of the people in your old support group.&quot;<br>&quot;That’s not it—let go of me, you’re acting like a child.&quot; Helen twisted her arm around, trying to force her partner to let go, but he clung to her like a limpet.<br>&quot;Helen, all you’ve done is hide in the RC unless we’re on missions. If you want to be part of the PPC, you kind of need to be part of the PPC, you know?&quot;<br>Helen sighed and stopped fighting. &quot;Fine. You’re right. Let’s get this over with.&quot;<br>Eric gave her a &#39;gentle&#39; punch to the arm. “Come on, worst case scenario you get a free meal.”<br>&quot;Free?&quot; Helen quirked an eyebrow at him.<br>&quot;I said it was my treat, didn’t I?&quot;<br>&quot;I believe you called it a bribe.&quot; Helen walked past him and pushed the door open, entering Rudi’s.<br>&quot;Same difference.&quot;</p>

            <p>From their perch at the bar, Harris and Tomoko watched as a pair of agents wandered into the bar. The black-haired Japanese woman nodded towards them and whispered to Harris: &quot;See the girl? Ex-Sue, I&#39;m sure of it: look at her face and bearing. She&#39;s got some scars, though. Wonder how that happened.&quot; <br><br>&quot;You really wanna know? Watch how the pros do it. But first, lemme finish my drink...&quot; Harris leaned back, trying to rest both elbows on the counter like some sort of smooth customer. He failed miserably, instead toppling backwards off his barstool and smashed the back of his head on the bar counter on his way down. Before Tomoko could react, Harris sprung back up, furiously rubbing the back of his head, and staggered towards the newcomers. <br><br>The Japanese agent slid off her seat and caught up to Harris in a few long strides. &quot;What the hell are you doing, Frost? Are you okay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gonna ask her,&quot; mumbled Harris as he continued to push forward. &quot;You wanted to know.&quot;<br><br><i>Glod help me. He&#39;s trying to act like nothing happened,</i> thought Tomoko. She  hovered behind the blond agent while watching the newcomers get closer. &quot;You just fell off a chair and wrecked your head,&quot; she hissed in his ear, &quot;so sit your sorry butt down and let me check you for concussion or--&quot;<br><br>Too late. Harris had entered conversation range. &quot;Excuse me, m&#39;lady,&quot; he drawled. &quot;We,&quot; he groggily gestured behind him at Tomoko, &quot;wanted to know about your scars.&quot; He stood there on shaky legs and flashed what he thought was a charming smile at the blonde woman.<br><br>Tomoko cringed. This was not a great start to a conversation.<br><br><br>- - - - - <br><br>((Thantosiet, was Helen ever actually recruited by the PPC? The end of the plugged story suggests that she was left in the &#39;fic to assimilate.))<br><br>((Apologies to eatpraylove for hoisting Tomoko and Harris out of the conversation, but it&#39;s nearly been a month of inactivity. If you want to pursue the interaction, let&#39;s say that this thread takes place after Harris and Tomoko interacted with Ami and Chris.))</p>

            <p>“Ow, that sounded like it hurt,” he said, looking over towards the noise. “Guess he’s okay, though—oh hey, he’s coming over.”<br><br>Helen stiffened at the man’s address. She didn’t recognize the man—or the Japanese woman who seemed to be trying to stop him—nor could she identify their department at a glance. Assuming they were in an action department, anyway. She didn’t know the regulations on wearing uniforms outside of work (or anywhere, really) but she and Eric wore theirs, the Department of Floaters badges very visible.<br><br>“It’s a long story,” she said at last.<br><br>“Not really,” Eric put in. “You and this other fat phoenix chick were both the most beautiful woman in the world, so your fics merged and when you guys met—”<br><br>Helen clamped a hand over his mouth halfway into the sentence. “Fine then, it’s not a long story. It’s just not one I like to talk about. Thank you for bringing up that painful memory.”<br><br>“Hey, he didn’t know,” Eric said, pulling her hand away.<br><br>“. . . And how many pleasant stories are there behind facial scarring, exactly?”<br><br>((She was left behind, but as there&#39;s been no progress on said fic, I think that means they get stuck in some kind of limbo. My current explanation is that she decided to try to follow the Agents, since otherwise she was trapped, and found a Plot Hole to HQ.

            <p>Or rather, looked around in Tomoko&#39;s general direction and said &quot;Ha&quot; with his eyes slightly unfocused. He then awkwardly pivoted on the balls of his feet, trying to walk back towards the bar, but instead stumbled sideways and collapsed into a chair in a seated position. &quot;Don&#39;t feel so good allova sudden,&quot; he slurred.<br><br>Tomoko swore under her breath and approached Harris. &quot;All right, that does it. Off to Medical for you. Sit tight and I&#39;ll open a portal.&quot; The black-haired agent retrieved her Remore Activator from her pockets and keyed in a code. The RA fizzled and beeped twice. &quot;No. Nonononoono...&quot; the Japanese agent smacked the RA with the flat of her hand several times, then quickly stuffed it back into her pockets and looked at Eric and Helen. &quot;All right... so apparently you can&#39;t open portals from inside HQ to another place in HQ. That&#39;s... kinda stupid, really. D&#39;you mind giving me a hand with Harris here? I&#39;ll, uh... hm. How about I buy you guys some drinks if you do? Deal?&quot; Without waiting for an answer she pointed to Eric. &quot;You there, with the face. Go up to the bar and ask for a bag of ice. If Harris is concussed, we need to keep the swelling down.&quot;  <br></p>

            <p>Helen looked at the concussed Agent in bemusement. Apparently that fall had been a bit more serious than it had looked at first. She turned her attention back to his partner (or possibly just a friend, she didn&#39;t know).<br><br>&quot;Deal--though I think Eric is underage so it&#39;ll have to be a non-alcoholic drink for him,&quot; she added. Eric was already on his way back, holding the ice.<br><br>&quot;Where did you get hit? back of the head?&quot; He asked, circling Harris anxiously.</p>

            <p>Harris weakly tried to shoo away Eric with a few swipes of the hand. &quot;Go &#39;way. I&#39;m okay.&quot; He slumped further back against his chair, looking dizzy. <br><br>&quot;No, you&#39;re not. Stop fussing and do what I say,&quot; snapped Tomoko. &quot;Ice-boy-- Eric, I think your partner said? Hold the bag behind his head. Blondie, place yourself beside Harris and grab his shoulder. I&#39;m gonna do the same thing on his other side. We&#39;re gonna walk him to Medical.&quot;<br><br>As the agents moved around Harris in preparation for the maneuver, Tomoko said: &quot;Oh, right.

            <p>Helen moved around to Harris&#39;s shoulder, opposite Tomoko. She grabbed the man with a little less gentleness than might normally have been required.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re not okay, hold still for a minute,&quot; Eric replied, moving around behind him. He was weirdly delicate with the bag of ice, as if he was afraid of touching anywhere water was condensing on its outside.<br><br>&quot;Here, give that to me and you take his arm,&quot; Helen said to the teenager, reaching around for the bag. She pressed it against the back of Harris&#39;s head.<br><br>&quot;Thanks. I&#39;ve got kind of a problem with water,&quot; Eric added to the Japanese woman.</p>

How did you find your way here? So, are you-- okay, watch the doors here... come one... nice. Everyone is clear? Let&#39;s roll. So Eric, are you like the team Auquaman or something?

            <p>&quot;I have a bad feeling you mean that literally. Wait, your grandma is her partner? Awesome--but how does that work? And that actually does sound kinda cool.

            <p>&quot;Her family-- Gaspard&#39;s parents and him-- moved in shortly after they learnt where she worked. The big thing is that they want to go back to World One after several years&#39; worth of service, so they&#39;ve all had their aging slowed down so they can reintegrate back where they left off in &#39;real life&#39;. Anyhoo, that&#39;s besides the point. Bulldog decided that I was &#39;too unruly&#39; and so tethered me to Gran. She&#39;d keep an eye on me, I could only go on missions with her, the works.

While the Sorting Room people do a great job to separate the obviously bad ones from the pile, there are a lot of borderline cases we have to evaluate in the field. About forty percent of the time, the material is passable.

            <p>For once, Helen was the eager one, beating out the obviously curious Eric.<br><br>&quot;Probably the way Mara and Isaiah handled you,&quot; Eric guessed. &quot;Just let you try to figure yourself out with some tips.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because that worked out so well.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So you&#39;ve got your whole family here?&quot; Eric asked. &quot;That&#39;s pretty cool. I figured we wouldn&#39;t have multigenerational Agent families until most of the kids in the Nursery had grown up. Huh. You&#39;d think with us talking so much about something unrelated we&#39;d get to Medical faster--oh no, I jinxed it,&quot; Eric realized belatedly. &quot;Sorry!&quot;<br><br>Helen reached over and gave him a &quot;gentle&quot; slap upside the head.</p>

            <p>&quot;You people stop talkinabout medical now or we&#39;re never gonna getthere. I&#39;m seeing dark spots now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a stress reaction.

            <p>Tomoko smirked and glanced over her shoulder at Gaspard. &quot;This guy? Please. I&#39;m pretty sure that if I wasn&#39;t around to drag him to places he&#39;d die of boredom or something. He never goes out! I&#39;ve got a life beyond work and he doesn&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s because you don&#39;t see me. Nobody-- family aside of course-- really does,&quot; said Gaspard. &quot;Most days I just feel like the Invisible Man. Do you ever wonder where I disappear off to on lunch breaks? Between shifts? Sick days?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. Why should I think about that? You always go back to your room and... brood? I think?&quot; <br><br>The corners of Gaspard&#39;s mouth twitched-- it could have been a bitter smile-- and he shook his head, looking at Tomoko straight in the eyes. &quot;Not quite, ma&#39;am. Have another guess-- though I feel that it might take some time for you to stumble upon the answer yourself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are you insinuating that I know nothing about my roommate?&quot; said Tomoko angrily.<br><br>&quot;Oh, no. I&#39;m flat-out spelling it out for you,&quot; shot back Gaspard.<br><br>Harris moaned again-- he had been walked into a set of solid polished oak doors each bearing a heavy brass plaque reading &quot;MEDICAL&quot;. The blond man sighed in relief and kicked the door. &quot;Oh, good. I think my headache was going to kill me. Now, let me in.&quot;</p>

            <p>...as he walked around Harris and his helpers and opened the door. The group walked through the Medical Department&#39;s doorway and into the lobby. From the far end of the room, the front desk receptionist briefly lifted his eyes from his paperwork to look at the five agents. By the time Harris and co. finally arrived at the desk, the receptionist had summoned a Nurse to the lobby. The Medical staffer-- a short lady with curly long brown hair-- strode briskly towards the blond agent, clipboard in hand. <br><br>&quot;Right, what is he in for?&quot; she asked, pencil and clipboard at the ready. <br><br>&quot;Concussion. Fell from a bar stool and hit his head on the counter down at Rudi&#39;s,&quot; said Tomoko. &quot;He said he was feeling dizzy and nauseous a while back. Shall I leave him in your capable care, then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Please do,&quot; said the Nurse, relieving Harris from Eric and Tomoko&#39;s hold and steering him into a side wing. &quot;Thanks for bringing him in!&quot; she called over he shoulder.<br><br>The remaining four agents stood in silence in the lobby. Tomoko finally broke the calm by saying: &quot;So... I owe you guys drinks, right? C&#39;mon. Let&#39;s get back to Rudi&#39;s.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;That&#39;s not a problem. Oh, and Helen? If you&#39;re still considering options, you can always ask whoever is at the counter for a recommendation. Personally, I like to go for a nice light beer after the end of a shift. You should try it!&quot; said Tomoko. She glanced at Gaspard walking a few paces behind. &quot;Oh, and if you&#39;re looking for non-alcoholic stuff, ask this dude.&quot; The Spy leaned close to the blonde Floater and whispered: &quot;He&#39;s actually <i>allergic</i> to the stuff. Poor fellow.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I heard that,&quot; sighed Gaspard. &quot;Besides, alcohol is overrated. Tea is where it&#39;s at. Agent Helen, might I suggest ordering a teapot of oolong?

            <p>((The following is probable-canon for Agents Chris and Ami, meaning that once I get Permission and slay my first Sue, I may turn this post and its follow-up (if any) into an actual interlude. Also, you all have my permission to involve Chris and/or Ami in your post. =D Also, late post is late and I apologize))<br><br>In a booth near the entrance to Rudi&#39;s Pub, Agent Chris of the Department of Floaters ran a hand through his black hair absently. <i>I should thank Rina for telling me about this place,</i> he thought. <i>I feel a little relaxed already.</i> &quot;Do they have anything you can eat, Ami?&quot; he asked the dark green unicorn next to him. &quot;I know there&#39;s a lot of human-style food in your show, but...&quot;<br><br>Ami shrugged. &quot;The menu says it&#39;s &#39;generally canon-compatible&#39;. I think we&#39;ll be OK. Oh, look! They have fresh daisy sandwiches and hayburgers!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hayburgers? Seriously?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do I mock <i>your</i> canon&#39;s puns?&quot; she retorted.<br><br>Chris had no answer to that, and so opened his menu again. The variety of food was astounding; normal, (extra) spicy, &quot;gluten-free&quot;, vegan, vegetarian, low-sodium, even &quot;Fan-created and/or Glittery.&quot; (He didn&#39;t want to think about that one too hard.) A familiar name in the &quot;extra spicy&quot; column caught his eye: &quot;New from the Johto region--Cinnabar Volcano Burger. Sesame seed bun, grilled Tauros meat (yes, really), lettuce, tomato, onions, and a secret spice blend. Cheese and extra ketchup/mustard available by request.&quot;<br><br>The boy-at-heart smiled fondly. One of his few clear Johto memories was of his mother making that burger for him whenever he&#39;d had a bad day or just because she could. True, the spice-infused meat burned like wasabi going down, but she used to say that if he could handle that, he could handle anything people threw at him. <br><br>Their waitress, a woman named &quot;Lysa&quot; with shiny brown hair and green eyes, approached with a drink tray. &quot;OK, here&#39;s your lemonade...&quot; She handed Chris a glass full of the sweet, bubbly drink. &quot;...and your black tea with sugar.&quot; Ami&#39;s horn lit up, and the cup, saucer, and milk pitcher levitated off the tray, to land on the table with three soft &quot;clink&quot;s. &quot;Are you two ready to order?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll have two daisy sandwiches, please,&quot; Ami smiled. <br><br>&quot;Yeah, could I get a Cinnabar Volcano Burger without the onions?&quot; asked Chris.<br><br>Lysa looked momentarily confused, but wrote it down. &quot;That one sounds pretty spicy. Do you want a glass of water with that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Since you ask, yes, please.&quot; When she left, he slumped over the table slightly, resting his head on his left hand. &quot;I cannot <i>believe</i> we got a freaking godplayer Sue for our first mission,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Seriously, who the hell did she think she was? You don&#39;t just usurp a legendary Pokémon&#39;s role and identity like that! And if you do, you don&#39;t get basic information wrong while you&#39;re at it!&quot;<br><br>Ami rolled her eyes. &quot;I know, Chris. You only complained about that like fifteen times during the mission.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Because she didn&#39;t follow the mother-clucking rules! Even in a canon as weird as mine, no trainer in his or her right mind would <i>ever</i> claim to have even a common Pokémon&#39;s powers!&quot; He took a big gulp of lemonade before continuing. &quot;The sad thing is that it wouldn&#39;t have been a half-bad AU if the little cow had at least bothered to stick to her <i>own</i> rules. But no, she and her friends just <i>had</i> to be a bunch of sooper speshul snoflaiks.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They weren&#39;t <u>all</u> like that,&quot; Ami pointed out. &quot;If they had been, we wouldn&#39;t have left the parents and her totally-not-boyfriend to live out normal human lives.&quot;<br><br>Chris took another drink of lemonade. &quot;OK, I&#39;ll give you that one,&quot; he conceded. &quot;Still, you can&#39;t deny that having two newbie agents kill a godplaying Sue is unfair even by this place&#39;s standards. Even though we did it, it wasn&#39;t fair.&quot; </p>

You and her, alone.&quot; <br><br>Harris chuckled and shook his head. &quot;No. She&#39;s just being nice.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Are you sure? I&#39;m no expert on women but that sounds awfully a lot like a date.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Absolut-- hey! I found it!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where? Pick it up!&quot;<br><br>Gaspard righted himself and watched Harris discreetly duck under a table occupied by a MLP-verse unicorn and a human. He could hear part of the conversation between the two: &quot;<i>Still, you can&#39;t deny that having two newbie agents kill a godplaying Sue is unfair even by this place&#39;s standards. Even though we did it, it wasn&#39;t fair.</i>&quot;<br><br>Harris chose that moment to pop up by the table&#39;s edge and lean on it, staring at the seated agents. &quot;Hah! You think that&#39;s unfair?&quot; he said. &quot;This guy,&quot; he pointed at Gaspard, &quot;went into the Rainbow Factory on an intelligence run. He went half-mad from that! You don&#39;t know what &#39;unfair&#39; is until your department forbids you from intervening in a &#39;fic even if you know it&#39;s bad!&quot;<br><br>Gaspard felt the blood drain from his face. &quot;T-that&#39;s quite e-enough H-Harris. D-d-don&#39;t make a s-scene, now,&quot; he stammered.</p>

            <p>((Also, LOL, &quot;shaken and stirred over here&quot;))<br>Ami nodded, and then stuck her head under the booth table, ignoring the humans&#39; confused stares. <i>Wow, there&#39;s a lot of dirt on this floor,</i> she thought. She created a ball of clear blue light on the end of her horn and turned her head in various directions. Her neck was starting to get stiff when she saw something sparkle blue just underneath Chris&#39; side of the booth seat.<br><br>&quot;I found your orange stone!&quot; she called to the Spies. She magically rolled it out to land next to the skinny one&#39;s feet, then lifted her head. &quot;Hope it&#39;s not ruined forever by being on the floor or anything.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t tempt the Ironic Overpower,&quot; Chris chided. &quot;Remember what happened with the Sue&#39;s best friend?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Which one, the totally-not-her-boyfriend or the one with her hair on fire?&quot; Ami retorted. &quot;Cause both of those would have happened whether I&#39;d said anything or not.&quot;<br><br>At that point, Lysa the waitress arrived with their food (and Chris&#39; glass of water). &quot;Enjoy your sandwiches and burger,&quot; she smiled, placing them in front of Chris and Ami.<br><br>&quot;We will,&quot; Ami replied. She floated one daisy sandwich up to her mouth and took a bite. The flower crunched pleasantly under her teeth. &quot;Mmmmm! Delicious! How&#39;s your volcano burger, Chris? ...Chris?&quot;<br><br>The human agent&#39;s face was the exact color of his hat, and he was crying. He smiled, though, so Ami figured he liked spicy things. &quot;Tastes...just like...I remember...&quot; he gasped. He chugged about half of his water.</p>

            <p>...and handed it back to Harris, who securely stowed it away in his trouser&#39;s pockets. &quot;Thank you, milady,&quot; said Harris, bowing to Ami. &quot;Now, uh...&quot; the blond agent caught sight of Chris&#39; reddening face. &quot;Is he having an allergic reaction to something...?&quot;<br><br>As Harris looked at the human agent chugging down a glass of water, Gaspard&#39;s earpiece <i>ding!</i>ed in his ear. The junior agent turned away and took the call, putting a finger over his other ear to drown out the pub&#39;s din. After a few seconds and a few whispered answers, he turned back to Harris and patted him on the shoulder.<br><br>&quot;Frost. I have to go and attend to a pressing matter. Kogi is going to swing by and keep you companeeeeEEE!&quot; Gaspard shrieked the last part of his sentence as a tall black-haired Japanese woman suddenly dropped down from a portal that had just opened overhead and landed right in front of him. <br><br>&quot;Gaspard! I told you I&#39;d <i>drop</i> in. Get it? You can go now, I&#39;ve got this.&quot; She looked up at the ceiling and pressed a button on the RA she held, closing up the portal. She looked at Gaspard, still half-twisted away from her while balancing on one foot, and facepalmed. &quot;Seriously? Go! They&#39;re waiting!&quot;<br><br>The half-Chinese agent snapped out of his pose, touched two fingers to his temple in a salute, and disappeared into the crowd, headed for the exit. The woman smiled and walked up to Harris. &quot;Hey there, birthday boy! So what&#39;s the score now? Nineteen? Niiice! Anyways, whatcha doin&#39; now?&quot;<br><br>She didn&#39;t wait for Harris to respond. Instead, she moved forward and looked at the two seated agents. She shook her bangs out of her brown eyes with a flick of her head. &quot;Hey there, guys! Sorry about the dynamic entry, but my sorta-partner had to go and do some stuff. Tomoko Kogi, DoI. I trust that Harris here isn&#39;t bothering you guys?&quot;<br></p>

            <p>Ami took another bite of her sandwich. &quot;You know, I thought about joining Intelligence for a while, back when I first showed up here. It seemed like something I&#39;d be good at. Detail-oriented, sort of behind the scenes...I like that kind of work.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But she&#39;s in Floaters because I needed a partner,&quot; Chris continued through a mouthful of burger.

            <p>She stuck her hands in her pockets and pouted. &quot;I used to be a Floater, but I got assigned to DoI after about a month of service. It&#39;s because, like, Floaters are a overflow department. Everyone eventually rotates out of it. Since DoI is always short-staffed-- gee, who <i>doesn&#39;t</i> want to sit in a room and read stuff or go out there and &#39;look but don&#39;t touch&#39;-- I got transferred to fill in the holes in the roster.

You&#39;ve met plenty of great people in Intelligence. Like me, for example,&quot; he said without the faintest trace of humility as he ran a hand though his short blond hair. &quot;So you said you wanted to go into Intel, is that right?&quot; said Harris to Ami. &quot;What made you go into an Action Department?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I was an expert on the fabled city of Atlantis living in the city of Augasta, World One. A Sue and her buddies looking for the sunken metropolis accosted me and asked for directions for their grand &#39;adventure&#39;. I did so, and later two agents told me that I looked capable enough to participate in the Canon Protection Initiative.&quot;<br><br>Tomoko gigglesnorted. &quot;Oh, Harris. You don&#39;t come from World One and you know it. More like World One-and-a-half: Atlantis doesn&#39;t exist in the real world.&quot; She turned to the two seated Floaters as Harris grumbled under his breath. &quot;But yeah. I&#39;m from the real World One-- born and bred in Osaka. I saw an ad in the newspaper and joined shortly after. My parents still have no idea I joined!&quot;<br><br>While Tomoko was speaking, Harris looked perplexed. When his colleague finished speaking, Harris said to Ami: &quot;That&#39;s really funny, about you not being accepted into DoI. Agent Snapshot made it here-- partnered with Narain of all people-- and she came out of <i>Cupcakes</i> just fine.&quot;<br><br>Tomoko nodded. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right! I was told it was a huge deal for a few weeks, with everyone questioning if she was up to it and stuff. She turned out fine and all the neigh sayers-- haha, get it? Anyways, all of the nay-sayers pretty much ignored her and found something else to complain about. Come to think of it, there are a lot of <i>MLP</i> natives in this place. There&#39;s Fire Flash who&#39;s in Internal Affairs-- she&#39;s a normal one, no wings or horns or stuff--  a unicorn who&#39;s in Medical but I can&#39;t remember her name, some other dude in DIC... yeah, you get the picture.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Actually, I think you just got some sort of speciesist bureaucrat when you applied for Intel,&quot; added Harris. &quot;Loads of folks just drop though plotholes and stay here-- and they weren&#39;t recruited. Also, I really can&#39;t see Mister Bulldog turning away anyone unless they were visibly unfit for duty. If you really want to join, send a request to... Personnel? Intel&#39;s Admin corps? The Floating Hyacinth?&quot;<br><br>Tomoko shrugged. &quot;Iunno. Going to the Hyacinth seems like overkill. If you try DoI Admin you can get caught up with that idiot again. I&#39;d say go though Personnel. I know hat some Floater teams are sent out &#39;on loan&#39; to the DoI to fill in some gaps. Maybe you could try to sneak in one of those?&quot;</p>

            <p>A Death Eater, a devil, an anthropomorphic fox and a Radioactive Moss Creature walked into a bar. It sounded like the beginning of a joke, the RMC thought, but if so, the punchline eluded it.<br>Saxo stopped right inside the door and looked around. His face showed clear disapproval of everything, the clientèle, the decor, the music. Currently the song playing was &#39;Come and get your love&#39;; an indication the Rudi&#39;s had also also fallen under the sway of the Awesome Mix soundtrack from Guardians of the Galaxy. Still, he didn&#39;t make any comment and after a moment of glancing around he followed the rest of them up to the bar.<br><br>&quot;Evening,&quot; said Rudi, who was polishing a glass with a tea towel in the time-honoured ritual of bartenders everywhere. &quot;New recruits? Haven&#39;t seen you around before.&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, no, we&#39;ve been here ...&quot; Mittens began, then trailed off and frowned. &quot;I have no idea really.&quot;<br>Rudi shrugged. &quot;Time can be odd here in HQ. But what can I get you gents,&quot; he eyed the RMC with interest, &quot;and plant-based life form?&quot;<br>&quot;A beer,&quot; said Mittens. &quot;Nothing particular,&quot; he added hastily. &quot;Just whatever you think is good.&quot;<br>&quot;Water,&quot; the RMC said.<br>&quot;Do you have firewhiskey?&quot; asked Saxo.<br>&quot;Sure do,&quot; answered Rudi and looked at the last person, the fox, who was too busy looking at everything around him to notice anything.<br>Mittens gave him a gentle push. &quot;James, what do you want to drink?&quot;<br>&quot;Oh! A glass of your finest wine, if I may.&quot;<br>Rudi nodded and started lining up glasses on the bar.<br>&quot;Can we sit here?&quot; asked Saxo, with a suspiciously innocent look on his face.<br>Mittens eyed him for a moment, then he looked at the bar stools and then at James, who was actually short enough to stand under them and - even though he was a good climber - would still have a hard time getting onto one of them. &quot;No,&quot; Mittens replied in a voice that brooked no argument.<br>Saxo looked annoyed for a moment, but then his eye was caught by the label on the whiskey bottle and he actually started to smile, before he remembered himself and took on a look of cool indifference.<br><br>A few moments later, everyone were making their way over to an empty table, carrying their chosen beverages, except for the RMC, whose glass was being carried by Mittens.<br>They all sat down. Saxo sniffed his glass of firewhiskey, which brought tears to his eyes of either appreciating or nostalgia. Or maybe it was just the whiskey fumes. Mittens lifter his beer glass and was about to take a sip, when James grabbed his wrist.<br>&quot;Wait,&quot; said the fox. &quot;We should make a toast.&quot;<br>Saxo cocked an eyebrow and smiled sardonically, but didn&#39;t actually start drinking.<br>&quot;A good idea,&quot; said the RMC. &quot;But for who or what?&quot;<br>James didn&#39;t need to think about the answer. &quot;For absent friends.&quot;<br>&quot;Absent friends,&quot; repeated both Mittens and the RMC and they all sipped their glasses.<br>&quot;Those absent friends,&quot; said Saxo, &quot;you do realize that they are not actually your friends, but the friends of the real ...&quot;<br>&quot;Stop it,&quot; interrupted the RMC. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to start a fight and have me embarrassed by having one or both of you thrown out.&quot;<br>&quot;Have no fear, Sir,&quot; said James and sipped his wine. &quot;While I am not a coward and would gladly fight anyone, anywhere, anytime ...&quot; He checked himself and continued. &quot;I shall not rise to his taunts. I know that he is no better than me; his situation no more enviable. We are both constructs with no place in what we thought was our home. We are much the same.&quot;<br>When James stopped talking and went back to calmly sipping his wine, both Mittens and the RMC looked at Saxo. He looked absolutely livid and was gripping his glass so hard that his knuckles were white and it looked like it might break. But it didn&#39;t and, apparently, neither did he. Finally his lifted the glass. &quot;To absent friends,&quot; he muttered and downed the whiskey in one gulp.</p>

His mouth had a weird shape to it, like he was trying to smile, but didn&#39;t have the energy to make it go up all the way.<br><br>&quot;Doc, let&#39;s put the book down for a while.  No fandom stuff tonight.  Let&#39;s just have dinner and talk a bit, okay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not . . . it&#39;s nonfiction,&quot; he protested, stammering.  He still didn&#39;t look up, even as Vania gently took the book from his grip and closed it.  (She made sure to pluck the bookmark out of his glasses and place it inside, first.  The idea was to traumatize him <i>less</i>.)<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; Vania said firmly.  &quot;Tonight is not a reading or writing night.  Tonight is a talking night!&quot;  She put the book under her armpit.  &quot;I&#39;m going to go get us some food, Doc.  You just wait here and--and don&#39;t think.  About fics.  Just try to talk to someone.&quot;<br><br>She started to turn away, but turned back when Doc mumbled something.  &quot;What&#39;s that, Doc?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just . . . no chumpits.&quot;<br><br>Vania shuddered.  &quot;No, Doc.  No chumpits.  I promise.&quot;  She finally left for the counter, leaving Doc alone, slightly bent forward and staring blankly at the table again.</p>

            <p>Jennifer Robinson found herself at the end of the bar nearest to the door, slowly nursing a warm butterbeer. This was about the most alcoholic thing she usually drank, since she was a bit of a featherweight and tended to become overly friendly when intoxicated, and her boyfriend wasn&#39;t currently available to run interference for her. Stupid missions. Stupid field agents. Stupid PPC....<br><br>That wasn&#39;t the only thing on her mind. Unaccountably, she had just gained about two years&#39; worth of memories of being stranded on a desert island. This sort of thing happened to her, and she wasn&#39;t exactly complaining, but it was a lot to assimilate. Frankly, she would be happy to be distracted by someone else&#39;s problems for the next, oh—she checked the nearest clock—hour or so before she had to go pick up Henry.<br><br>(( So yeah, I have no idea if Jenni would know anything about Vania, but this was a perfect way to sidle into this thing. ^_^ ))</p>

            <p>She arrived at the bar and nearly hopped up onto the stool next to the brown-haired woman, so relieved she was at her minor victory of crossing a room without being recognized.<br><br>&quot;Greetings!&quot; she called to the nearest attendant.  Rudi himself was farther down the bar, and Vania was thankful.  She actually didn&#39;t feel too afraid of Rudi recognizing her; with all the faces he saw in a single month, it was doubtful he would recognize one who went missing six years ago.  Still, no reason to take chances.<br><br>She ordered a pair of hot dogs and a bowl of french fries, &quot;with lots and lots of ketchup on both, please.  And for drinks . . .&quot;  Vania trailed off, her gaze listing to the right as she thought about what to get Doc.  This led to her noticing the Butterbeer on the counter.  &quot;Oh!  I&#39;ll bet Doc hasn&#39;t tried one yet.  I&#39;ll get two Butterbeers, then.&quot;<br><br>As the waiter moved away to fulfill the order, Vania realized that her imitation of her bar-neighbor&#39;s drink might have caused that patron to notice her.  She quickly glanced at the brown-haired woman&#39;s face.  Not familiar, no memories there; nonetheless, Vania quickly looked away and pretended to watch a blitzball game displayed on one of the TV screens on the back wall.</p>

            <p>People came and went all the time, so she didn&#39;t think much of it. The mention of butterbeer did get her attention again, but what held it was the way the younger woman looked her way and then pretended she hadn&#39;t. Either she was checking Jenni out, or she was nervous about something. Jenni was nothing if not inquisitive, so she turned slightly in her seat, leaned an elbow on the bar, and put on her best disarming smile.<br><br>&quot;Hey, couldn&#39;t help but overhear. Foraying into butterbeer for the first time? This is the real thing, first ingredient: magic; not one of those World One imitations.&quot; She figured innocuous small talk was the best approach for either possibility.<br><br>Now that she took a closer look, something about the other woman did ring a bell. Something about the black ponytail, the suit, and the name Doc... where had Jenni run into her before?</p>

Frowning, Jenni turned back to her drink and took a long sip. She should just leave well enough alone, really.

Unfortunately, the fact was that was her job because she simply couldn&#39;t help herself.<br><br>She turned around, further this time, and took a look at the room.

One or two faces drew her eye, though—particularly a man at a nearby table, who looked like his strings had been cut.

She made a mental note not to let that one get away without talking to him.<br><br>Furthermore, he tickled her memory banks.

With the, what was it, a PDA or something?&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. A lot of that party was a blur, but Doc&#39;s extreme nerves had stood out to her, as well as the way Ilraen had received the tech thingy so positively, saving the givers from a torrent of sarcasm.<br><br>(( And there you have it. {= ) Just a reminder, the party actually took place February 2013, even though I posted the thread this year. ))</p>

            <p>&quot;Yikes.&quot; Jenni looked over at Doc again. She thought she was starting to understand what had him so downcast. If someone had so crassly slandered an author she respected, like Rowling or McCaffrey, and then she&#39;d had to confront the thing head-on?

She said, trying to make her voice sound bright, but really only managing loud.  &quot;That would be great of you, Jenni.&quot;  She turned to the right and started to slide the tray off the table, catching sight of Doc again.  Vania forgot her own fears for a moment, remembering again the state he was in.  Her speech turned sincere again.  &quot;I don&#39;t think he&#39;s been to FicPsych before, so I don&#39;t know what he would think of you guys.

I figured I&#39;d start worrying if things didn&#39;t get back to normal today, but now they have. {= ) ))<br><br>There it was again: that odd reticence, something slightly stiff about Vania&#39;s tone and movements.

In addition to being friendly, she found that making a physical connection right away often helped to form a mental connection in both a literal and non-literal sense.

Once Jenni looked away, towards Vania, Doc let his chin drop again.<br><br>Vania felt bad about her teasing, now.  This was hardly the time to make Doc feel bad, and it wasn&#39;t that big of a deal, anyway.  They hadn&#39;t even known Supernumerary, except by reputation.

He had nearly finished the hot dog already, but he was eating mechanically, still not really paying attention to anything else in his environment.  Vania wasn&#39;t really sure how the &quot;Psychology&quot; part of &quot;Department of Fictional Psychology&quot; worked, but Jenni seemed to be aiming for conversation, so she figured to follow her lead down that track.  &quot;So, uh, Jenni, done Psych work for any interesting canons lately?&quot;<br><br>((I realize this was a lot from my agents&#39; side.

            <p><i>Vania is not a nutritionist.</i><br><br>Jenni gave her an amused look.

            <p>Jenni had to take a breath for patience before responding. Vania&#39;s apparent need to talk was starting to make the nurse rethink the decision to keep her here.

            <p>After a long day of putting up with his partner for 5 minutes, Eamon Brightbeard needed a drink.  He changed out of his normal silver armor and into something more comfortable: sturdy leathers with some decorative steel panels riveted on.  That done, he headed down to Rudi&#39;s for something strong.<br><br>He walked into the pub and straight up to the bar.  Once he had gotten settled on a stool he flagged down the bartender.  &quot;Evening, Rudi.  If you please, I&#39;ll take the strongest thing you&#39;ve got, as long as it comes in a flagon.&quot;<br><br>Drink in hand, he sat back and let the sounds of the pub wash over him.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>With Randa and Mcgonagoll snoring loudly (who knew mini-Aragogs could snore?), it was a simple matter for her to sneak out. She only paused to put on her jacket and shoes.<br><br>She wandered the featureless gray corridors in her pajamas, no particular destination in mind. So when she came across a place called Rudi&#39;s, she figured she might as well check it out.<br><br>It turned out to be a pub or bar of some kind, with patrons taking up almost every seat. Rina glanced around the tables, taking note of several interesting agents like the foxlike creature talking to a mossy plant of some sort. <i>Is this place always so full?</i> Rina wondered, still looking for a seat.<br><br>She decided on the bar, where several humans and humanoids sat, conversing with one another. Rina settled herself next to a dwarf who was sporting a magnificent beard. <br><br>The bartender came over, wiping a mug with a cloth. &quot;Can I get you anything?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Anything without alcohol or Bleep, please,&quot; Rina said. &quot;Actually, do you have hot chocolate?&quot;<br><br>The bartender nodded, not even fazed by what Rina thought would be an odd request. Barely a minute later, she was nursing a mug of hot chocolate straight from the Polar Express.<br><br>&quot;Oh, did you hear?&quot; The bartender asked, leaning forward somewhat. &quot;Apparently some recruit&#39;s mother got into HQ and had a shouting match with the Sunflower Official.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Can you imagine?&quot;<br><br>Rina choked into her mug, feeling her cheeks flush.</p>

            <p>Rina nodded.

            <p>Agent Desdendelle knew he wasn&#39;t the most persuasive person around. He also knew that his new partner, the Time Lord called Librarian, was a misanthrope that preferred the company of books to other people.<br>So instead of suggesting a drink at Rudi&#39;s, he tapped the Librarian&#39;s shoulder. “I&#39;m going to get something a bit stronger than my usual cuppa tea.

            <p>&quot;That was a bit of a nasty scrape, wasn&#39;t it?&#39; said Emiran as he limped down the Generic Grey corridor with a cane. &quot;Who knew that a Purity Sue could turn out to be such a good fighter? That ESAS team made the right choice to call on Special Response to give them a hand.&quot;<br><br>Naya harrumphed as she hobbled beside her partner. &quot;&#39;Says you. Half of your leg got sliced off, didn&#39;t it? You should be thankful I remembered to charge Terabyte&#39;s batteries after I woke up. Without its intervention a lot more than just your <i>leg</i> would&#39;ve come off.&quot; The quarian groaned and stopped, clutching her stomach. &quot;Keelah. I&#39;m going to feel that kick for the next few days...&quot;<br><br>Her Time Lord partner stopped and smiled. &quot;Ah, technicalities. I&#39;ve got plenty of regenerations left in me. Besides, Medical did a good job of gluing my trotter back on, didn&#39;t it? That Medi-gun of theirs really works wonders!&quot; The former soldier stared into the middle distance. &quot;We should get one of those for our place. Like, in miniature. I&#39;m sure if I have the blueprints I can make it better and smaller...&quot; <br><br>&quot;No. We already have enough junk lying about.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, come one. Pleeeeeeease...?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. Let&#39;s just get to Rudi&#39;s.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fine.&quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>The Special Response team split up after they entered Rudi&#39;s pub. Naya made her way to the bar as fast as her bruised chest would allow and went about the complicated business of trying to order dextro-amino acid based liquor with an &quot;emergency induction port&quot;. Emiran, on the other hand, stopped and sniffed. Something smelled... <i>Gallifreyan</i>. The Time Lord started moving around the room, flaring his nostrils and looking around frantically. He hadn&#39;t seen much of his people after his entry in HQ: maybe he could sit down with a fellow Time Lord and get to the bottom of this Continuity Council nonsense. <br><br>Emiran&#39;s nose eventually brought him to Agent Des&#39; table. The Gallifreyan man leaned in close to the Floater, locked eyes, and inhaled sharply. Oh yes. This was the source of the smell, but this man wasn&#39;t Time Lord. It must be his partner, then. Emiran quickly straightened himself without breaking eye contact and cleared his throat. &quot;My name is Emiranlanoamar, but you may call me &#39;Guardsman&#39;. I presume your partner is a Time Lord? If so, what is their name and are they on the Continuity Council?&quot; <br><br></p>

            <p>When the Guardsman started sniffing him, Des cocked an eyebrow and his hand strayed a few inches away from his glass – and toward his axe, though it was nowhere near it at this point. He knew that while some agents were harmlessly bonkers, some of them were homicidal, and Len and his shouts of “Mr Rogers! Mr Rogers!” were quite famous in HQ by now.<br>However, when the sniffing person introduced himself as a Time Lord, Des relaxed. He poured himself another shot. “I&#39;m Desdendelle – Des for practically everyone else – and yes, my partner is a Time Lord,” he said. “Goes by “the Librarian”, and if memory serves, he&#39;s Jade Warden or whatever. Don&#39;t call him that, though: he&#39;ll probably hit you with one of those books of his.”<br>The human scratched his goatee and downed his shot. “Here, take a sit,” he said, tapping the table. “Alcohol&#39;s no fun when drunk alone. Kinda like tea.”</p>

            <p>&quot;Don&#39;t mind if I do, Agent Des,&quot; beamed the Time Lord as he allowed himself to crash into the seat opposite Des. The Guardsman&#39;s cane clattered to the floor but was quickly snatched back up by its owner and propped against the table. &quot;Oops! Forgive me. I&#39;m always sorta clumsy after surgery. Medical had to weld my foot back on after a run-in with a Sue. Surprisingly painless! Those Medi-guns are the niftiest gadgets ever with their pain-blocking pulse. Or something. I can&#39;t remember. It was either that or the adrenalin high. I don&#39;t know. Now, where was I...?&quot;<br><br>He paused for a second and then remembered why he had approached Des in the first place. &quot;Oh, right. The Librarian, you say? And he&#39;s the Jade Warden. Mm. If I remember correctly, that&#39;s the one supposed to watch over the Whoniverse&#39;s timeline. Does he even <i>do</i> anything besides watch the show?&quot; <br><br>The dark-skinned man rubbed his chin for a few moments and added: &quot;Oh, right. I&#39;m asking this because I seem to be the only Time Lord around here <i>not</i> in the Continuity Council. Even that twit Antrilovorasilendar-- er, the Notary, that is-- has a title. Not that I want in-- just the opposite, really. Last I heard, the HQ Daleks tried to one-up the Council by doing... I don&#39;t even know, but it ended in a temporal fold that nearly blew up HQ. If we&#39;re gonna keep the peace in this place, we need to know what the Council is up to-- and what the Daleks might do. Stupid things. I don&#39;t know why we don&#39;t just liquidate them and avoid all this trouble.&quot;<br><br>The Time Lord fell silent, then looked back at Des. &quot;Too heavy? Sorry. Naya,&quot; he nodded towards his partner seated at the bar, &quot;tells me that I have a tendency to talk people to death. Do you think so? Well, <i>I</i> don&#39;t think so but if you notice anything just tell me and I&#39;ll stop talking. Furthermore--&quot; The Gallifreyan man caught himself mid-sentence. &quot;I&#39;m doing it again, aren&#39;t I? All righty. Being quiet now. You were saying something about drinks?&quot;<br></p>

            <p>By the time the Guardsman finished talking, Des was grinning like the Cheshire Cat. He poured the Time Lord a shot – from where he procured the glass is anyone&#39;s guess – and slid the glass across the table. “Give this a try,” he said. “This Cointreau is really good. In fact, it&#39;s suspiciously similar to the bottle I had back home; it even has the same patina of dust on it. I have no idea how Rudi got this.”<br>The human rubbed his goatee. “We do get <i>Dr Who</i> missions from time to time, so you can&#39;t say he&#39;s not doing anything,” he said. “Can&#39;t say much more, though. I&#39;ve not been in their meetings and I don&#39;t want to. They managed <i>not</i> to destroy HQ and that&#39;s enough for me. And, frankly, if there&#39;re Daleks involved, I don&#39;t want to be. An axe isn&#39;t much use against a pepperpot that can EX-TER-MI-NATE you from afar.” He pause and poured himself another shot. “No, you&#39;re not talking too much. In fact, you&#39;re a welcome relief from the Librarian; he talks so little when we&#39;re off duty – always busy with that tablet of his or with those huge, dusty tomes – I sometimes wonder if he&#39;s mute.” He downed the shot and coughed again. “Ah, good stuff. So do make yourself at home and natter all you want. Worse-case scenario, I&#39;ll tell you to shut up.”<br>Des looked at his glass for a few seconds. Then he raised his gaze again. “Also, generally speaking liquidating people doesn&#39;t solve problems. It just adds more. Plus, it makes Upstairs upset.”</p>

            <p>...and saluted Des with a little gesture with the vessel. &quot;Heh. We <i>are</i> talking about my people&#39;s mortal enemy. How can I not be a tiny bit speciesist when confronted with that? ...though I can make an exception for Dalek Caan. He was a good one. Cheers!&quot; He took a tiny sip of the drink. Smacking his lips together, he took another, bigger sip of Cointreau. &quot;Oh, now that&#39;s pretty excellent stuff. I wonder...&quot; The Time Lord reached into his Inverness coat&#39;s pocket and pulled out his laser screwdriver. He pointed the sleek and silver pencil-like device at the glass for a second-- <i>bzzz!</i>-- and held it up to his ear to check the psychic interface. &quot;...goes well with cocktails too. Ha! I&#39;ll have to remember that. Humans, eh?&quot;<br><br>He tucked the laser screwdriver back into his pocket. &quot;I have to admit that I&#39;m still new to food culture.

I can&#39;t go back to the pills after eating real food.&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman leaned back in his seat, looking a bit pensive. &quot;So, enough about me. What about you? I know your name, partner, um... department,&quot; he eyed the Floater&#39;s flash patch, &quot;and what you like to drink-- that&#39;s a pretty good start-- but what about everything else? Fandoms, likes and dislikes, place of origin... care to share?&quot;</p>

            <p>Des rubbed his neck. “Pills...? That sounds horrid,” he said before grinning. “I&#39;ve actually eaten many a falafel ball back at home. It&#39;s really good in a pita with t&#39;khina and some veggies.”<br>He poured himself another shot, downed it, and chuckled. “As to your questions... let&#39;s answer them in order, shall we?”<br> He flicked his finger at his glass, causing it to tinkle and spin around before catching it again. “It should be added, first and foremost, that my preferred beverage is actually tea, the bitterer the better. Fandoms... I guess they change with the times, I&#39;m always reading and watching new things. I&#39;m currently in a Star Wars phase, watching that Clone Wars series. As to what you can call my, um, major ones, those would be” – he started counting on his fingers – “Star Wars, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, Lord of the Rings, the Culture, Yu-Gi-Oh!... I guess you can add obscure animé and manga to the list; I mean, stuff like Upotte!!, Ikkitousen, To Love-ru, etc.”<br>Des poured himself another shot, then slid the bottle across the table to the Guardsman. “Have some yourself, too.” A pause. “Likes...? Philosophy, tea, logic, good music, tea, peaches and other fruit that you can chew their pits for hours on end, the hill of Tara, Ireland, and tea. Did I mention I like tea?” Another pause, accompanied by an ear-to-ear grin. “Dislikes? Bad [=SPaG=], illogic, stupid people, murderous Sues... I also have a... bad reaction... to torture, even more than normal, thanks to an especially disgusting Fate Testarossa replacement.” A cringe. “Bad. Bad.”<br>Shuddering like the room was suddenly very cold, Des sneezed. “Anyway, origin... that&#39;s a bit complicated. You&#39;d call it earth, I guess, but not World One. Plenty of differences stemming from the fact that there are no weapons that aren&#39;t mélee weapons or bows. It&#39;d take years to explain all of them. Also, the tea is predatory. Makes it bitter like it should be.”</p>

            <p>&quot;Predatory tea plants, you say...? In a world with only bows and other assorted pointy objects. Did your people never figure out gunpowder or something?&quot; The Guardsman sipped at his drink again and put it down neatly in front of him.<br><br>&quot;Say... I&#39;ve been wondering about this thing lately and I wonder if anyone else thinks like me. Well, not <i>exactly</i> like me because that would be impossible since I am Time Lord and have a different thinking process and... er... getting sidetracked. Where was I going with this...? Oh! Right.&quot; The former soldier toyed with his shot glass, watching the liquor swirl about inside it. &quot;Do you ever get homesick? Hang on, better question: can <i>you</i> go back to your home continuum and visit? &#39;Cause, well, I&#39;m Gallifreyan so my planet is in limbo. Until canon gives us a fix on Gallifrey&#39;s position, I can&#39;t just open a portal to the Homeworld and go back.&quot; <br><br>The Guardsman smiled. &quot;When I was back at the Academy, all I thought about was getting offworld on board an exploration TARDIS. Then the Time War happened and my wish came true, in some way: got off the planet, killed some Daleks, got killed in some interesting ways in alternate timelines, went back to Gallifrey, survived the Fall of Arcadia, fell through a plothole into the Time Vortex, hit another plothole, and landed here. But then after some months in HQ, I just got this feeling of wanting to go back. I want to see the sunrise on my district again, I want to find out what happened to my family, I want to help with the rebuilding and all of that...&quot;<br><br>He raised the glass of Cointreau to his lips again and downed the contents. After recovering from his coughing fit, he shakily poured himself another shot and pushed the bottle back towards Des. &quot;So, yeah. Do you ever think of home?

            <p>“Oh, don&#39;t be like that,” Des said. “We&#39;re not <i>that</i> backwards. We have planes, computers and stuff; we&#39;ve reached the moon; we sent craft to Mars... the works. We just don&#39;t have stuff to shoot at each other with.”<br>He paused and seemed to be thinking about the Guardsman&#39;s question; he rubbed his goatee, tapped his nose and scratched his head. “I do visit home from time to time, so to speak,” he said at last. “That&#39;s where I get the tea for my Bleeptea from, after all. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen my family for more than a few hours. It&#39;s not like we get regular free days here.”<br>Pouring himself another shot, Des lifted the glass before his eyes and looked at the Guardsman through it.</p>

            <p>“Librarian is sane,” Des said, “for a certain definition of sane, anyway. No, I was talking about my former partner.”<br>He looked glumly at his glass and fished around in his trenchcoat&#39;s voluminous pockets. After a moment or so he found what he was looking for and put it on the table. It was a black piece of cloth, about sixty centimetres in diameter. In its middle was a Floaters flash-patch. “It&#39;s a sad story, truth to be told,” he said. “Guy was an Elf from a pretty much unknown continuum – <i>The Battle for Wesnoth</i> is a barely known open source video game with next to zilch fics set in it – and was pretty serious. He was a decent partner, if a bit annoying with his holier than thou attitude sometimes. Now, you see, there aren&#39;t lots of Agents that know <i>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</i>, and Intel found a... well... not legendary badfic, but let&#39;s say a bleepfic. An MGLN x <i>Halo</i> bleepfic. So Upstairs take their lists and see that there are two pairs of MGLN people available and one <i>Halo</i> pair available. We were one of the Nanoha pairs.”<br>Des sighed, poured himself another shot and looked at the Guardsman for a while before downing it and continuing. “The fic was so bad it basically replaced the whole <i>Nanoha</i>-verse. We all reacted bad, and Ari ended in Medical after fighting a super-ultra-mega-OP Sue. I ended up in FicPsych, but whatever those shrinks did, it worked and I&#39;m functioning... aside from the nightmares, anyway. Anebrin – that&#39;s my former partner – looked OK. Problem was, he wasn&#39;t. We got a <i>Forgotten Realms</i> mission when I returned. It looked easy, the Sue was bland and not terribly smart, but just before we got to the sticky part he went haywire, killed the two OCs I planned on leaving behind to be assimilated into the canon and beheaded the Sue like nothing. The Marquis wasn&#39;t pleased, to say the least, and when Anebrin started raving like a lunatic Security threw him out.”<br>Another sigh. “Not a fun tale.”</p>

            <p>He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. &quot;I, uh... Sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to stir up those memories.&quot;<br><br>The Gallifreyan man drummed his fingers on the table for a few seconds, then his face lit up and he snapped his fingers. He craned his neck around and signed to a passing waiter. <br><br>&quot;Good day, gents! What can I get you?&quot; asked the brown-haired waiter as he approached the table, notepad at the ready. &quot;Soup of the day is broccoli cream and the daily special is the Cinnabar Volcano burger.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hello! I&#39;d like to order... ah... some water, three sets of chicken wing appetizers, a garden salad, the cheeseburger, the club sandwich, soup of the day-- er, make that two-- and the cheesecake.&quot; The Guardsman looked back at Des. &quot;You know, you need a break. Nightmares, not wanting to sleep, losing a partner, overpowered Sues, and being paired with the Librarian. I&#39;m buying-- and no arguing with me!&quot;<br><br>As the waiter scribbled the order on his notepad, the Guardsman added: &quot;What do <i>you</i> want to order? Sorry about the large order: I just found out that I have a large appetite after getting off the nutri-pill diet.&quot;</p>

            <p>Des blinked. “That&#39;s a lot of food,” he said, matter-of-factedly. “As to myself...?”<br>He <i>hmm</i>ed for a few moments. “I&#39;d like some Spätzle with beef in cream, mushrooms and Jack Daniels whiskey. With lots of Parmesan on it. Also, whatever you have here that resembles Milky Wulong tea the most.”<br>Once he had given his order, he pretty much ignored the waiter&#39;s existence. He started fishing in his pockets again. “What you said about payment had me wondering, Guardsman,” he said, and brought a handful of... well, some were coins, to the table. “What have I here? Waterdhavian gold pieces, a Star Wars credit chip, three Septim, a Torchlight gold piece or two, Israeli Shekels – how the hell do I have those? – and an Israeli credit card. Quite the collection, isn&#39;t it?”</p>

            <p>&quot;I&#39;ve never been into coin collections myself,&quot; said the Guardsman as he picked up a 10-shekel coin and ran his thumb over the raised palm tree. &quot;Bit boring, really. So are stamps. Who collects inanimate things anyways? Robot parts are where it&#39;s at! Bolt them together, solder a bit there, program the computer and <i>voilà</i>! Hours of entertainment. I&#39;m really proud of this piece, though. Salvaged it from a <i>Mass Effect</i> badfic where Naya, Terabyte, and I were sent to investigate a DBS team&#39;s distress signal.&quot;<br><br>He pulled a grey, fist-shaped metal object from his pocket. Several thick cables protruded from the its top. &quot;High-density power cell,&quot; explained the Time Lord. &quot;It&#39;s some high-tech Suvian artefact that I repurposed for use. Y&#39;see, Naya and I are only two parts of a three-person team: our third squaddie is actually a sentient virtual intelligence. It has a robot body to walk around in but its power cells were damaged a while back. Since it can&#39;t stay in a body with no power, it usually hitches a ride in my partner&#39;s suit computers. Since compatible parts are a nightmare to find for a geth body-- even by patching up the original batteries we could only squeeze eight-ish minutes of operational time with minimal power use-- this was a lucky break for us. Once I finish testing this baby out, Terabyte might be able to stay in its platform for about twenty hours before recharging. Neat, eh?&quot; </p>

            <p>“Well, I didn&#39;t collect those per se,” Des said. “I sort of got them while on missions – you know, from dead OCs and sumsuch. Except the credit card; that&#39;s mine.”<br>He chuckled. “Never been into this two-hands thing myself. That&#39;s my brother.

            <p>&quot;Well, you might as well ask it directly. Excuse me a moment, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman put the power cell back in his pocket and the shekel on the table, took his cane, and limped over to the bar where his partner Naya sat, perched on a bar stool and sipping her drink from a sealed container through a straw connected to her helmet. He stopped next to her, patted her shoulder, pointed at Des one or two times, and made begging gestures with his hands. Naya shrugged, grabbed onto the Guardsman&#39;s shoulder, and used him as a crutch as the pair walked back to Des&#39; table, drink in hand. The Guardsman guided the quarian to a chair beside him and propped his cane against the table as he sat down again. &quot;Naya, this is Agent Desdendelle from Floaters. Agent, this is my partner, Naya&#39;Keegan of the starship Iktomi. He wanted to know more about Terabyte.&quot;<br><br>Naya disconnected the straw from her helmet, put her drink on the table, and nodded towards Des. &quot;Pleased to meet you. Emiran tells me that you were interested in meeting Terabyte? Well, here it is. Say hello, TB.&quot;<br><br>The quarian raised her left arm. She used a gloved three-fingered hand to type a string of commands on the orange holographic interface that encased her raised forearm. When her Omni-tool beeped twice, she laid her glowing arm on the table and watched as a holo-screen emerged from the tool, the image resolving to the mugshot of a geth soldier platform. Onscreen, the geth&#39;s glowing camera-eyes focused on Des under the khaki-coloured metal hood that formed its head.<br><br><font size="2"><font>&quot;Entering active mode. Agent Desdendelle wishes to inquire about my nature and home continuum, yes/no? Please specify,&quot; </font></font> asked Terabyte.<br><br>Naya nodded towards the holo-screen. Behind her nearly opaque teal-tinted visor, her glowing eyes narrowed a bit. It was always difficult to tell what her facial expression was, but she was definitely smiling. &quot;Go on. Ask it anything! TB doesn&#39;t get to speak to others often, so I&#39;m sure it appreciates the chance.&quot;<br><br><br>- - - <br><br>((For visual reference: <a href="http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120415184004/masseffect/images/0/0c/Quarian_MP.png">generic quarian female</a> and standard <a href="http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121010042757/masseffect/images/6/65/ME3_Geth_Trooper_MP.png">geth trooper</a> platform.))</p>

            <p>Des nodded at Naya and waited for her to boot Terabyte up. “Yes, I would very much like to know more about you,” he told the hologram. “After all, you don&#39;t exactly meet a sentient AI every day. Even here in the PPC.”<br>He grabbed the various monies still lying on the table and stuffed them into his coat&#39;s pocket. “Specifically, I was wondering what&#39;s your personality like.

            <p><font size="2"><font>&quot;It is difficult for me to describe my personality. I can describe my mobile platform&#39;s capabilities, weaponry, average reaction times, tactics, and attack runtimes that I use every day at work. Unfortunately, they do not reflect who I am as an individual. They are simply observations that any sentient being can make about my performance. Reminder: I am a part of a species of synthetic life originally created to serve the quarian race though manual labour. Such machines are not designed to be introspective.&quot;</font></font> Terabyte&#39;s holographic representation tilted its head to the side, as if in thought. <br><br><font size="2"><font>&quot;That being said, my base programming contains code that creates positive feedback loops upon completing certain tasks. From an organic life-form&#39;s perspective, I &#39;like&#39; these things. Example: there is a meadow in the Courtyard where wild horse populations and Agent Alice run. I have volunteered some of my time to build a shelter for these animals for protection against the Courtyard&#39;s rainy and winter seasons.&quot;</font></font><br><br>Naya leaned towards Des. &quot;TB&#39;s batteries are too weak to let it run around like that. I built a big solar power generator so that the mobile platform can run off umbilical power while it works. You should&#39;ve seen its face when it got tangled in its own cables once...&quot;<br><br>Terabyte ignored the anecdote and continued. <font size="2"><font>&quot;Example: when in an emergency situation, I aim to take down a threat alive. There is no need for unnecessary loss of life. Even Suvian creatures are useful alive: the DMSER is always pleased to receive live subjects. Example: food preparation. Emiranlanoamar enjoys my cooking.&quot;</font></font><br><br>The Guardsman smacked his lips. &quot;TB made chili last night. Best bit of home cooking I&#39;ve had in a while.&quot;<br><br><font size="2"><font>&quot;Example: I often tune into Naya&#39;s auditory sensors when she listens to the music channel on the radio. I can easily use the HQ Wi-Fi to download and view the rest of the piece but there is a certain... <i>charm</i> in not knowing what will come next in the music. I can appreciate the effort put into the composition. To me, the most interesting genre has to be opera. Conveying a story though song onstage is hardly a new concept in the history of art, but terrans have been very prolific in this particular art form.&quot;</font></font><br><br>Before Terabyte could rattle off another example, Naya cut in. &quot;There you have it. Our geth partner, the pacifist animal-loving cook-in-training opera fan.&quot;<br><br></p>

Its composer, Richard Vanger, was one helluva racist, but the music is awesome. Especially the Ride of the Valkyries. It&#39;s also quite famous.”<br>He turned to the other two as he poured himself another shot of Cointreau. “Say, you guys, what are your tastes in music?”</p>

            <p>Des sniffed the food and smiled. “Librarian?” he asked. “He&#39;s... not a people&#39;s person. He&#39;s a books-and-computers person, always working on that confounding riddle. Something about Osiris or something similar.”<br>He lifted the cup the waiter put before him to his face and took a deep breath, then put it down again. “Ahhh, that smells excellent...” he muttered. “Bete&#39;avon, anashim.”<br>With that, he took his spoon and began eating the Spätzle with gusto, sipping from his tea from time to time.</p>

To keep it simple, I&#39;ll use the most basic of situations: your agents have just been through a long day and need a pick-me-up. They drag their weary bodies to Rudi&#39;s for some drinks and a chat with some colleagues-- if they feel up to it.<br><br>Standard rules apply: no controlling other people&#39;s agents (actions, speech, thoughts, or interactions with objects), no starting fights, no provoking a HQ-wide emergency, and no shoes in the pool.

            <p>This is OP. As for the question here. Let us go through it one by one shall we? What makes me come here you ask? Well its all started after I read Agony in Pink. For the original series? The answer is no, I haven&#39;t read it yet but I will in the future. As for the last question, I&#39;m from the unused part of the web, the web where nobody care to search for, a dead link, some sort of mystery, An entity. AN ENIGMA!!<br>That all from me.

            <p>I love <i>The Princess Bride</i> movie. The book just pretty much sucks. It goes to great lengths to suck the fun out of the Dread Pirates Roberts parts of the book. Where the frame story in the movie is about a sick kid and his grandpa reading to him, the frame in the book starts out mentioning that scenario, but then goes off into this cynical, whining spiel about how miserable the author is with his life, how his wife hates him, how his kid is fat and how that is horrible, and on and on and on. <br><br>I really liked the movie <i>Going Postal</i>. I saw it before I read the book. After I read the book, I did like the book in a lot of ways. The plot is better and makes more sense in the book, but the descriptions are pretty spare. I couldn&#39;t picture the golems at all from the descriptions in the book, and a few other characters were a lot easier to visualize as their movie versions.<br><br>Visualizing things is the main advantage of movies over books, and always will be, I think. No amount of illustrations will give you what 30 seconds of a movie can.<br><br>It has been a long while since reading this one, but I remember being really disappointed with the <i>Ella Enchanted</i> book. I had, of course, seen the movie first. The plots are very different if I remember rightly. The book was a lot more serious. I really like the kind of fairy tale punk that the movie <i>Ella Enchanted</i> represented. Maybe if I had read the book first and gotten attached to it, it would have been different. </p>

            <p>There are other sorts of adaptation. One of the more ridiculous chains of adaptation decay is the one followed by <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>, which goes:<br><br>-<i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>, book, by L.F.B<br>--<i>The Wizard of Oz,</i> film, starring Judy Garland<br>---<i>Wicked,</i> book, by Gregory Maguide<br>----<i>Wicked,</i> musical, starring Idina Menzel<br><br>Each is based on the preceeding, and to some extent on everything before it, but it&#39;s mostly a straight chain. And which is better?<br><br>Well, frankly, it depends on what I&#39;m looking for. Wicked-the-Musical is great fun, but Wicked-the-novel has a deep political element that didn&#39;t make it into the musical, and is explored further in the sequels. Oz-the-movie is a classic, of course, and far <i>nicer</i> than either version of <i>Wicked</i> - in the sense that you come out of <i>Wicked</i> depressed, not cheered, particularly in the case of the book. And Oz-the-novel? Well, it <i>is</i> the start of a massive series, which will take far longer to read than even the four <i>Wicked</i> books - and I like to read.<br><br>So it&#39;s a case of swings and roundabouts. Same with <i>Jurassic Park</i>, previously mentioned - I love both the film and the book, the film because, y&#39;know, dinosaurs, and the book because it delves far more into the science of those dinosaurs. The book&#39;s also a thriller, with the element that the characters - and the reader - don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening most of the time. The film is far more of an action film, even though the dinosaurs are hardly ever in it. So what mood am I in? That&#39;s going to influence your answer.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think a lot of the time, for me, it depends on which I experienced first. For instance, I saw the Princess Bride years before I read the book. Of course, they were both written by the same man, so they&#39;re pretty close, and both are very good, but I preferred the film&#39;s version of Buttercup, and the ending.<br><br>On that note, what about movies that are really different from the book, but both are still enjoyable as long as you treat them like separate pieces of work?</p>

            <p>--I completely forgot about probably the best drastically different book-to-movie adaptation I&#39;ve ever seen: How To Train Your Dragon. I read the book years before, and it had its own charm, though it relied a lot on gross humor and goofiness. The movie made a lot of changes (the biggest probably being that they turned the dragons and Vikings into enemies) but they all worked, creating a very different, and in my opinion better, world, story and characters.</p>

            <p>And there are others where the book and movie have different good points for different reasons. For example, though I am not an avid Hunger Games fan, there were points where the message was communicated more strongly by the movie (because you <i>finally</i> get to see glimpses of other perspectives besides Katniss&#39;, and because a lot of the description in the book of, say, district 12, was rather vague.) But the movie also tends to gloss over a few points that had more ideological impact than action.<br><br><br>I can&#39;t think of any examples of movie&#39;s I&#39;ve seen that were good movies from a mediocre book, but I know I&#39;ve seen a few.<br></p>

            <p>I would make the argument that the film adaptations of both <i>Jaws</i> and the original <i>Jurassic Park</i> are stronger than their original literary sources. It&#39;s admittedly been a while since I&#39;ve read either of the books, but I remember them as being rather lackluster in comparison. Both films tweaked characters, settings, and plot points enough to create a better experience. <br><br>I&#39;ve heard similar things about the film versions of <i>The Godfather</i> and <i>Goldfinger</i>, but as I haven&#39;t read those books I can&#39;t speak to that with any degree of certainty.</p>

            <p>I now I&#39;m biased, but I rarely like any adaptation of a book.  No Hollywood budget can ever stand up to my imagination.  Things might be different if I watched the movie first and hen read the book, but I try to avoid that whenever possible, so it rarely occurs.<br><br>The early Harry Potter movies were faithful enough that I liked them a lot, but the later ones cut out too many little details that made the books so fun.</p>

            <p>The Harry Potter movies are very close to the books, and are a decent translation from books to movies. As such, they&#39;re fun to watch.<br><br>On the other hand, there are movies that claim to be like the book, but cut out too much, or change the source material too much. While they might be fine movies on their own, they weren&#39;t what we expected, so we start off with a predisposition to dislike them.<br><br>Then there are movies like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where they pretty much tell you right off the bat that it isn&#39;t going to be exactly like the comics, so we don&#39;t go in expecting them to adhere as strongly to the source material.<br><br>In short, it depends on how much leeway we&#39;re willing to give a movie in relation to how close it is to the source.</p>

            <p>As my first official contribution to the PPC community, I submit to you plenty of goodfic, sorted by fandom. So without further ado, lets dig into the good stuff! <br><br>Magical Lyrical Girl Nanoha <br> <br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6550856/1/Blood_That_Flows">Blood That Flows</a>   - a really good AU crossover with Slayers, wherein Momoko Takamichi is actually Lina Inverse. The series follows the first two Nanoha seasons somewhat closely and starts combining more Slayers storyline elements onto a long stretch towards the StrikerS equivalent <br><br> <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7485060/1/Game_Theory"> Game Theory</a> <br> - Precea realizes that abusing her sole asset in accomplishing her goals , Fate , is not a good way to go about doing it and chooses a slightly more positive approach instead. With Fate having a solid grounds for loyalty, everything changes.<br>The fic also does a pretty awesome job with worldbuilding, <br>fixing and adjusting canon inconsistencies regarding Devices, Familiars and magic in general<br><br>Also has a sequel in <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9156554/1/Power_Games"> Power Games</a> <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6069359/1/Vivio-s-Father-s-Day">Vivio&#39;s Father&#39;s Day</a> - Pretty short but sweet one-shot.

Pretty similar to the canon White Devil Incident, heartwarming conclusion included. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7343788/1/Lyrical-Family-Moments%20">Lyrical Family Moments</a> - A collection of oneshots on life on the Takamachi family. Sometimes humourous, sometimes dramatic and sometimes plain weird, but still always pretty sweets nevertheless. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6579258/1/Vivio-s-First-Christmas%20">Vivio&#39;s First Christmas</a> Pretty heartwarming oneshot. Nanoha, Fate and Vivio and co spend Christmas with Nanoha&#39;s family on Earth. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7044042/1/Warmth-under-the-Snow%20%20">Warmth under the Snow</a> Caro&#39;s warm memories of that wonderful first meeting with Fate <br><br>That should wrap it up for Nanoha. next up, Sakura and Harry Potter fics any time soon!<br> <br><br> <br><br><br><br><br> <br><br> <br><br></p>

And how one of the arguments was how well-researched some of their…. vicious methods were? Well, this abomination presents a solid counterrargument.

All of this because the author finds the character annoying, like most western fans, but dammit this clearly taking that petty hatred too Glaurunging far! <br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/geek/papirini/kousagi/badfic/oneshot/chibi7.txt">Chibiusa’s seventh</a> <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/~papirini/kousagi/badfic/oneshot/chibi7part2.txt">birthday</a> - Mature rated - NSFW - NSFB<br><br>Sailor Moon  <br><br>Every single Canon in this story is possessed if not replaced.

The author in both title and summary that is supposed to still reach the<br>happy of the movie and it still not finished, but I doubt it. <br><br>The Replacement Sue uses vitriolic insults that befit neither the age of the Canon nor the tone of the work. Seriously , this a Disney movie based on<br>a dramatic but innocent classic German children’s book, whose author Erich Kastner must be really spinning in his grave and generating enough energy for the entire PPC HQ.<br></p>

            <p>None of these have been mentioned in the thread yet, so I figured I&#39;d post them. Hopefully there aren&#39;t any duplicates with similar past lists.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6625714/1/Asclepius-Revisited">Alscepius Revisited</a><br><br>Star Trek: TOS. A series of drabbles exploring Doctor McCoy&#39;s character. Each installment is just long enough to do its job, which is fleshing out my favorite member of the original series crew.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8342866/1/Power-Rangers-Oneiro"> Power Rangers: Oneiro</a><br><br>Power Rangers. A wholly original Ranger team that&#39;s actually going to be adapted into a non-fanfiction series by the author at some point. It&#39;s also a horror series, and the scares are varied and delicious. Very atmospheric, though SPaG is somewhat flawed.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6239295/1/Not-Just-Action-Figures">Not Just Action Figures</a><br><br>Power Rangers again. Every Ranger and villain from Power Rangers has suddenly been transformed into an action figure and dumped in the bedroom of a little boy. This fic is a great example of how to do a mega-crossover--it&#39;s got a clever mystery, plenty of time to explore all the characters and their bizarre situation, and even takes the silliness inherent in the series and makes it awesome. The only downside is it&#39;s not finished.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/82683/1/The-Geekado">The Geekado</a><br><br>BtVS, Season 5, as told by way of the Mikado. The two work together uncannily well, and it&#39;s very funny. I would not be surprised if this has already been posted here.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7891198/1/Cherchez-le-Docteur">Cherchez le Docteur</a><br><br>Doctor Who; Donna, while looking for the Doctor between Runaway Bride and Partners in Crime, runs into the Ninth Doctor, fresh out of regeneration, and has an adventure with him. Fun adventure with touches of heartwarming.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6050795/1/Power-Rangers-Cyber-V">Power Rangers Cyber V</a><br><br>Another original series set in the far future; a multidimensional conqueror has begun annihilating realities, and a team of Rangers are the only ones in their way. There are a few canon characters present, and they are used very well, but the OC&#39;s are great, well-developed and balanced against each other. The pacing is strong, the monsters and obstacles creative, and even the villains get development. It is, however, in script format.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7283819/1/Two-Rivers-Meet-on-a-Fairground">Two Rivers Meet on a Fairground</a><br><br>Firefly/Sherlock/Doctor Who crossover. Sherlock meets with an &quot;informant&quot; and leaves Watson to mess with a shooting game, and he makes a few new friends. Watson&#39;s POV is well-done, everyone&#39;s in-character and it creates a uniquely odd little encounter.</p>

            <p>Those two look like good stuff. That mega crossover too! Can&#39;t judge the other ones as I know basically nothing about their respective series. Obviously since I am new here and the last list seems to be buried further than the first few pages, I wouldn&#39;t know what has been featured or not.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4200568/1/The-Harmony-Bond">The Harmony Bond</a> - <br>Way back in 1988, Hermione is mysteriously attracted to Privet Drive, where the Grangers end up saving Harry from the Dursley. However, something equally strange happens when Harry and Hermione touch for the first time… <br><br>As a result of these events, things are changed greatly before we even get to Hogwarts and after a certain point, the plot differs significantly from Canon. <br><br> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3743518/1/Tragedy">Tragedy</a> - <br>A sudden tragedy strikes Hermione’s family. Thought her life is now irrevocably changed, she has her friends to support her, with her relationship with Harry growing ever stronger among these, eventually evolving into something else…   <br><br>A realistic portrayal of loss, grief and also of life after Hogwarts for our heroes. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past">Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future’s Past</a> <br>Harry has managed to beat Voldemort, but has lost everything and everyone that he holds dear. So he hatches a plan to go back to the past to change things for the better. <br><br>What I think makes this work is that firstly, Harry realizes that he is basically manipulating his friends from the start and must deal with the moral implications of that. Secondly, he tries to avoid making drastic changes, preferring subtler ones that still improve his chances of succeeding and allow him to not lose the edge the edge his foreknowledge gives him, which still cause unexpected turns of events.  <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=79611">Marissa and the Wizards </a> <br>Marissa is a young girl who lives in the streets of São Paulo, Brazil. Lately strange things have been happening around her and soon revealed to be a Witch. <br><br>An interesting look into a Wizarding culture outside Europe. There are subtle differences, such as how the Diagon Alley equivalent works, the transportation method to school, how Houses and the school itself are structured and inclusion of local folklore. <br><br> <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/&lt;&lt;a%20rel="><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4256837/1/Albus-Potter-And-the-Year-of-The-Badger">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4256837/1/Albus-Potter-And-the-Year-of-The-Badger</a></a>&gt;Albus Potter and the Year of the Badger  <br>Albus Potter and his cousin Rose Weasley make a most unusual friend on the way to Hogwarts. At the Sorting Ceremony, things go even more unexpectedly for the three of them. <br><br><a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/href&lt;a%20rel="><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/</a></a>&quot;&gt;Hogwarts Houses Divided “&gt;Hogwarts Houses Divided<br>Follows Teddy Lupin and his friends on their first year at Hogwarts, as well as the rest of the first generation born since the end of the war. <br>Makes good use of an interesting cast of OCs and keeps <br><br>Canon Characters that do appear well character. Also include a nice intrigue plot. <br><br>Last time around, I didn’t have any Badfic to submit ( or at least I thought I didn’t) , but this time have got plenty, so I figured I should be productive and post them here along with the Goodfics.  <br><br><a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/&lt;a%20rel="><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5233819/1/Betrayal/">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5233819/1/Betrayal/</a></a>&quot; &gt; Betrayal - K+  <br>A sudden flash of memory and an overheard conversation starts Harry on journey to rediscover something he lost in sixth year. What he finds could change, not only his life, but those of every one close to him as well.  <br><br>Bashes Ron to hell, attempts to fix Harry and Hermione’s strained friendship in HBP badly and creates a horrible brand of love potion in order to sastify the last point.  <br><br><a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/&lt;a%20rel="><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5664828/1/Harry-Potter-and-Future-s-Past/">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5664828/1/Harry-Potter-and-Future-s-Past/</a></a>&quot; &gt; Harry Potter and Future’s Past -  T<br>Starts out the day after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry and Hermione meet the Goddess of Love, and she offers to let them go back in time. Strictly Harry and Hermione. Minor - well maybe major Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore Bashing. Soul Bond - Time Travel <br><br>Creates uncanonical deities, treats every single major Harry-Hermione friendship moment as a failed destined romantic one ( Yes, even those in PS and CoS!) and as understated in above summary, bashes Ron, Ginny and Dumbledore to hell! Seriously, this one of those stories were Ron only is a friend of Harry because the meeting at King Cross was staged. Also, Ginny tries to love potion Harry with increasingly vile concoctions at turn. <br><br><a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/&lt;a%20rel="><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6067357/1/A-place-called-home">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6067357/1/A-place-called-home</a></a> &quot; &gt; A place called home - T<br><br>All anyone ever wants out of life is love, a family and home. Sometimes these are right under your nose. Harry/Hermione romance fic. Rated T. Non canon compliant with HBP or DH... probably not OOTP either.<br><br>Keeps several characters that be dead in canon alive. Its plots also hinges on making Hermione’s parents OOC from what little characterization they have, turning her mother in an extremely emotionally abusive parent, making her father betray his family and ultimately making them both outright abandon her. Also gives Hermione several Uncanonical Relatives. <br><br><a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/&lt;a%20rel="><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5732117/6/Not-What-it-Appears">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5732117/6/Not-What-it-Appears</a></a>&quot; &gt; Not What it Appears - T <br>Children that grow up without a stable loving family can sometimes turn toward bad ways. A set of twins wan to stop that for two young children. <br><br>First of all, it makes Hermione’s parents extremely neglectful towards her. Then it makes Dumbledore and McGonagall into a crack pairing and thus gives them a truckload of joint Uncanonical Relatives and even a few to Voldemort ,again, some of which are shared with one of the former pair’s! It also hinges on a highly uncanonical spell, which is a worse rhyme-laden mess than Fred and George’s turn-Scabbers-yellow hoax, but for some Glaurunging it still works! And as a result of said spell, once we do get to Hogwarts, the plot of SS is mostly rehashed 14 years later than Canon. <br><br><br><a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/&lt;a%20rel="><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5813363/1/Adopted">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5813363/1/Adopted</a></a>&quot; Adopted M (was formerly rated lower before the author decided to add a needlessly graphic sex scene in one of the later chapters)<br>Harry and Hermione make an impromptu visit to an orphanage one day and decide to adopt a child. Georgiana is a five-year-old orphan who just wants to be loved. What happens when these two paths cross? Rating now upped!   <br><br>Features a child Sue who creates a highly illogical adoption plot. Said child Sue reality warpings include: allowing a 18 and a 17  not in a stable relationship to adopt a child(it also makes Harry older than Hermione somehow) , changing how the Britain foster care system works, creating fictional records for Harry and Hermione in the Muggle world,  rehashing a terribly clichéd adoption plot and making said pair to always have been attracted to one another. The child Sue is also of course uncharacteristically mature for 5-6 year old.  <br><br><a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/&lt;a%20rel="><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5598955/1/Positive">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5598955/1/Positive</a></a>&quot; &gt;  Positive /a&gt; <br>Harry and Hermione have a one-nite stand rite before the Third Task in Fourth Year, but soon that leads to consequences and responsibilities. <br><br>By the same author as Adopted. First of all, it simply erases all the Weasleys from existence without rhyme or reason. Then it makes Harry get Hermione at the tender age of 15 (again the author makes Harry older than Hermione because they can’t seem to correct a false assumption they once had). While at it, Dumbledore is driven extremely OOC, going so far as to try to force Hermione to abort for the greater good. It also gives Hogwarts dormitories for couples some reason. Then things really get weird, as Harry is inexplicably able to read his unborn daughter’s mind (no really) , which is further compounded by said child Sue having unrealistic development, as in, she learns to walk, talk, read, write and such unnaturally earlier than she should. I could almost swear that the author tried to partially adapt Breaking Dawn into a HP fic.      <br></p>

            <p>Yeah, Game Theory is pretty cool. I&#39;m way behind on Power Games though...<br><br>I highly recommend reading Infinity by Moczo (over here: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5144486/1/Infinity"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5144486/1/Infinity">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5144486/1/Infinity</a></a>) because it&#39;s hilarious and in-character and has great fight scenes, pacing, and twists.<br><br>I&#39;m gonna have to disagree with you on that Christmas fic, though.

            <p>I like most people here, enjoy the Chuggaconroy channel very much. I will enjoy playing as Shulk. However am I the only one who finds the trailer lacking something? My two favorite trailers are the ones for Palutena, Lucina, and Robin. I like how we got a clear sense of their personalities and game play. With Shulk&#39;s trailer Never got that sense.</p>

            <p>...I&#39;m not familiar with Xenoblade Chronicles, so I&#39;m not that excited about Shulk joining the fray.<br><br>However, I AM excited about Pac-Man joining the fray. As the trailer for him points out, he&#39;s from same year as Mr. Game and Watch, one of my favorite characters in a Smash context. He also pulls moves not just from his own games, but from other Namco arcade games like Galaga (which incidentally often shared a cabinet with Mrs. Pac Man). We see him not only deploy Galaga ships, but also use the Galaga tractor beam, most likely as his grab.<br><br>He may end up a close second to Mr. Game &amp; Watch when I get the game.<br><br>...<br><br>However, he didn&#39;t appear in any of the leaks. Is this Nintendo saying &quot;[EXPLETIVE REDACTED] you and your leaks, this is our game, it&#39;s not finished, we control what characters will be in there, and you WILL still be watching the trailers to see who wre add after that leak!&quot;?</p>

            <p>Those tea leaves have nothing to do with Satan. True, they&#39;re sometimes called Stygian Tea, but the river Styx passes through Hades, which is not Hell (contrary to what Disney would have you believe), and that&#39;s because the tea produced from them is rather... bitter. They are no more Satanic than the Venus Flytrap.</p>

            <p>A tip: If you advertise customization, add aesthetic customization as well as what-it-does customization, and don&#39;t make it only for one type of, say, armor. One of the few things I don&#39;t like about Minecraft is that only its leather armor can be colored in-game. (It&#39;s MORE than balanced by resource packs on that front, but still.)<br><br>Second, what platform are you shooting for? Android/iOS? PC? (Linux? Mac?) Flash? Console or handheld?</p>

            <p>(Word of warning: I&#39;m not a regular poster on here, so I might come off as overly blunt.)<br><br>First off, if Halo and SST are your inspirations, then I would advise you to drop the term &quot;hard sci-fi&quot; as soon as possible. Halo is anything but hard, with practically all of the Covenant technology violating the First Law of Thermodynamics, and the chances of Spartan armor actually being usable (rather then a dead weight after the power runs out in five minutes) are slim at best. SST is considerably harder, especially if you&#39;re using films for the reference point, but it is still not at the level of true hard sci-fi like Alastair Reynolds&#39; works.<br><br>As to the rest, you need to give a LOT more detail. Right now it reads a bit like a blurb at the back of a book: sure it all sounds very nice, but it could mean practically anything and everything. Please tell me what kind of customisation you actually have in mind, as well as more details about the story, and then I can give proper feedback.<br><br>Finally, a word of advice from someone who played a few games, tried to design one a couple of years ago and read close to a thousand game reviews: whenever you face the choice between making the player more powerful/advanced or making the enemies more advanced, it&#39;s best to improve the enemies first. Otherwise, all the customisation/wide range of skills, etc. goes to waste, as the player will not need them and stick to the easiest weapon ability 90% of the time. <br><br>Once you&#39;ve made the enemies uniquely challenging and powerful (i.e., not by simply increasing their damage/health, as far too many games tend to do), then you can be sure that all abilities will be useful, or have the potential to be useful depending on the playstyle.<br><br>I hope this was useful.</p>

            <p>not exactly realistic, but starhunter has ballistic weaponry and fabric armor, for example.<br><br>the customization is based around having everything be able to be modified. you can customize down to the type of bullet or trauma plate if need be(and on higher difficulties, you will need to)  <br><br>the story is about humans and aliens going to sleep one night after receiving several visions beforehand, and waking up in a world known as the hyper unconsciousness. the AI constructs that control that world (known as the old gods) brought the people there because they thought that the societies of the humans and the two other aliens were flawed and needed to change in order to survive. but then the main governing body of the old god controlled northern half of the hyper unconsciousness is attacked by some kingdoms to the south. to say any more would spoil the rest of the story, though.<br><br>you weren&#39;t overly blunt, IMO.  </p>

            <p>Gameplay first: so, there&#39;s ballistic weaponry (I&#39;m guessing pistols, shotguns, assault rifles and sniper rifles +/- a couple of more out-there weapons) that can be modified. Are gameplay-altering weapon mods (I&#39;m ignoring aesthetic side for now, since that&#39;s relatively easy if you have a good graphical designer) the military-shooter stuff (underslung grenade launchers, laser/optical sights, extended/lightened magazines, etc.) or are there also things that modify stats, confer status effects, etc.?<br><br>About bullets, do you just mean the ability to change the ammunition type (which is nice, but not uncommon: see Bioshock 1 and 2, Mass Effect 1 and 3, Russian turn-based shooters, etc.) or some kind of bullet editor? I suppose it&#39;s the former, as it is a perfectly adequate mechanic, but it&#39;s best to be specific. <br><br>When it comes to armor, how pieces of it can you customise? Is it just one-two armor plates? Is it Dragon Age-like with helmet, boots, gloves and cuirass? Or completely detailed like recent Bound by Flame, where you craft leggings and shoulder plates in addition to everything above? Obviously, the latter options are more rewarding for the player, but are also progressively more complex (see Bound by Flame&#39;s numerous bugs and lack of polish), so it&#39;s important to make that choice early on.<br><br>Now, the storyline description could also do with a bit of work. Firstly, when you say &quot;humans and two other aliens&quot;, how many characters do you mean in total? Is it one human protagonist and two aliens from two different races or something else entirely? It would also be nice to know what year is it when they&#39;re transported, and where they were/what they were doing before they went to sleep.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m personally of opinion that spoilers only apply to the eventual customers/consumers/however you want to call them; if I agree to have input in a certain work, my perception of it will already be different from someone coming to it fresh, and so spoilers cease to have meaning, especially when they might well get changed at this point in time. So, fire away!</p>

            <p>I wrote my reply when my computer was ready to update, so I didn&#39;t have a lot of time to work with<br><br>anyways, the ballistic stuff aren&#39;t the only weapon type around. in addition to ballistic, you have laser, plasma, and pure energy. as for attachments, you have sights, grips, pretty much most of the standard shooter stuff. weapon customization works off a slot mechanic. each mod has advantages and disadvantages, and they can only go in the predetermined slots.<br><br>as for ammo, it&#39;s actually somewhat like an editor, but the only two parts you can change are the projectile/actuator and the powder load/generator. the ammo type itself determines damage and status effects<br><br>armor has 7 pieces which can be swapped out in addition to being modifiable. it&#39;s kind of similar to bound by flame. each armor segment has slots like weapons for attachments. whats unique is that armor attachments have slots for components(it is not necessary to change or upgrade components on lower difficulty levels).<br><br>the story takes place in 2027. most of the protagonists are   human, with a few aliens. the game will have you recruit a small army of character (numbering in at around 32-35).<br>the spoilers I mentioned revolved around the patron deity of the southern half of the hyper unconsciousness trying to invade the upper half with an army of space barbarians, starting with a preemptive strike by a group of earth-native humans who believe the ideas offered by the hyper unconsciousness will corrupt society. this is discovered by the player at the midway point of the game. prior to that, said patron deity&#39;s preemptive strike consisted of the kingdoms to the south, who were tricked into attacking the imperium. the player must fight the kingdoms first, while learning about the world&#39;s rich mythology.<br><br>I hope that answered all your questions. <br>   </p>

            <p>there have been entire forum arguments about whether an outside concept pitch works or not. and I&#39;m willing to postpone it indefinitely if necessary.<br><br>Plus my cousin said: &quot;They typically promote new games internally and hire writers to write the background content and &quot;story&quot;, hand that to a couple concept artists. They do a review of market, a pitch to their producers ( the money ) marketing ( sales team ) and see if they think it can sell. If they don&#39;t think so, generally the game is dead. He said get good at something. Programming, writing, art, rendering, coding, debugging code, and know how to do at least two of the jobs in the field all the way. But be damned good at those jobs and make yourself ESSENTIAL to the company, because contracts for EVERYONE start at accepting and starting development and END when the game is done or gets cancelled. They go for 1-2 years and by the last three months you better have another job lined up. Its also 60+80 hours a week for a lot of people for most of the time. They burn out fast.&quot;<br><br>and:&quot;I&#39;d say keep working on it. If you want it bad and put in the work you never know what might happen. I always wanted to write and do art for d&amp;d games, and even submitted art to a couple companies while I was in college and got rejected. Now I have been published for art and writing  many many times.&quot;<br><br>plus, I could get an indie to develop a prototype and then forge a connection with a company to have it developed (I&#39;m not making this game for the money, more for recognition). <br></p>

            <p>Essentially, the market determines everything for the AAA sector, and the turn-over in AAA studios is also very high. However, you&#39;re unlikely to find any indie worth their salt for a prototype; about 95% of them would consider on par with selling out and so they won&#39;t touch it for that purpose.<br><br>Really, consider developing it in a 2D isometric format. That is both a relatively rare genre and one that offers good balance between development time/difficulty and visual fidelity/realism (check out Supergiant Games&#39; Bastion and Transistor to see what can be done within the format).</p>

            <p>This is because the developmental costs skyrocket with the transition to 3D, as there&#39;s suddenly huge range of models, textures and what not that will need to be worked on and processed, with the complexity increasing every year. That&#39;s not saying you CAN&#39;T feasibly get it made in 3D, only that it would look like a 2004 game at best, while an isometric game can still look highly attractive.</p>

            <p>...depending on whether you want to develop a computer game, or are just interested in seeing this idea as an actual game of some kind, would be to re-imagine it as a tabletop RPG. It&#39;d be much easier to develop as a solo project, as won&#39;t need anywhere near the kind of specialist skills you&#39;d need to do a computer game by yourself.<br><br>You&#39;d still have to come up with all the setting details, concepts, rules and game mechanics, but all you&#39;ll have to do is write them all up and then you&#39;d be ready for playtesting (OK, so it might be a <i>bit</i> more complicated than that, but still simpler than a computer game, I think). You may need to streamline some of the customisation options you were talking about - what works as a nice detailed system with near infinite variety on computer will probably just bog down a pen and paper game system.<br><br>Might be worth thinking about though. </p>

            <p>Thank you! Looks like I&#39;m all set to go kill Titans now. Or Titan Sues someday. Both they and the PPC take some time to master so that works out.<br><br>Yes indeed; I admit my knowledge of Marvel in terms of the comics is based almost wholly on what Linkara&#39;s told me, but after Guardians of the Galaxy I really hope their future ideas do well.</p>

            <p>Oh yes, though after a while some of the reviews can blur together a bit. I&#39;m a huge fan of his storylines, which tend to be epic and creepy and full of the right kind of fanservice. They&#39;re also a perfect response to the ad hominem attack &quot;let&#39;s see you do better than these stories you&#39;re criticizing.&quot; Though I&#39;m not sure how often he&#39;s actually gotten that, given how bad most of his targets are.</p>

            <p>For Super Sentai, Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger&#39;s a good gateway (ah, alliteration). Hikari Sentai Maskman&#39;s also fairly well-written, if you can get past the Star Trek: TOS-level effects and 70&#39;s-80&#39;s fashions.<br><br>For Kamen Rider, Kamen Rider W (a.k.a. Double) is my favorite so far, since it&#39;s a detective series as well.</p>

            <p>Kaizoku Sentai is a fairly new series, isn&#39;t? Yeah, I think I can into that. As for Hikaru Sentai, I don&#39;t think the fashion will. Dobother me that much. Also do you mean the effects are bad or dated? <br><br>As for Kamen Rider W, it does seem cool. To be fair, I have only read or watched a few mystery series. I think the most mystery-related fiction I have interacted recently were Persona 4 and Danganronpa.
