            <p>It&#39;s weird, we have so many college-age sci-fi nerds wandering around here and there don&#39;t seem to be many who are particularly literate in basically the granddaddy of all RTSs. I haven&#39;t explored the fanfic community around the games much if at all, but given what EA did to the franchise <i>canonically</i> (yes, I went there....) there have to be some stinkers out there, probably Stufics and people who get Nod or the Russians horribly wrong.<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

I was mainly thinking about the Attack On Titan (which I LOVE) where the Titans are driven by their need to feed on human flesh. Or Walkers from the walking dead- which I know nothing about.

            <p>Typically, agents (or at least assassins) are supposed to disguise themselves as something that would canonically harm whatever the fic&#39;s Mary Sue claims to be. I can&#39;t see a Titan disguise working very well, but a Walker disguise would be <i>perfect</i>. *g*<br><br>As for AoT, the agents should absolutely strive to avoid attracting the attention of any rampaging Titans. The canon&#39;s cloaking effect should help there, but Titans seem to have excellent senses, so it may not take as much effort to break the effect.<br><br>(Sudden thought: wouldn&#39;t it be fun to see an agent actually get swallowed, only narrowly escaping by desperately portaling out, taking half the Titan&#39;s stomach contents with them?

            <p>I&#39;m not sure about this and I don&#39;t have any specific examples, but I <i>think</i> there are some canonical entities that can see Agents even when they are &quot;cloaked&quot;, usually ones that can detect canonically invisible things or simply ones that are very powerful. I don&#39;t think any of those can perceive them through disguises, although there are canons that are simply aware of the PPC outright: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Canons_Who_Know_of_the_PPC"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Canons_Who_Know_of_the_PPC">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Canons_Who_Know_of_the_PPC</a></a></p>

            <p>On the one hand, yes, we have a very fluid definition of &#39;PPC canon&#39;, and anything anyone writes is (usually) accepted, and retconned where necessary.<br><br>But on the other hand: the idea that the canons can&#39;t see you but the non-canons can goes right back to <i>Rambling Band</i>. It&#39;s a staple of writing PPC missions properly. Hide near a Character Replacement, yes. Write a Stu as so oblivious to everything around him that you can look over his shoulder, sure. Disguise yourself as something a Sue will just ignore, absolutely - that&#39;s what disguise generators are for (as well as, in theory, keeping the canon from harm by not having uncanonical kinds of murder). But just have them unable to see you? No. That&#39;s now how it works.<br><br>I&#39;m not promising I&#39;ve never personally had agents hanging around where they ought to have been noticed. But I will say two things. First, I&#39;ve never claimed they <i>can&#39;t</i> be noticed. And second, if I find or someone points out to me an instance where I&#39;ve done it, I&#39;ll change it. That&#39;s now how it works, and I refuse to let it appear in my work, even by omission.<br><br>The Canon protects agents from being noticed, in that it stops things under its control from noticing them unless they draw attention to themselves. That&#39;s the original explanation for what&#39;s now identified as an SEP field; I&#39;ve been here all along, and I still have no idea why people felt the need to change it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Does it help to know that it&#39;s introduced in the Original Series? In mission 26, <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission26.html">&quot;No Way Back&quot;</a>:<br><br> There was a slight lurch, and they were about an hour ahead and several miles away, left banding in the stushes <span>[sic]</span> of a house. Rhus grabbed her taller partner and dragged her down so that Candie, sitting on the stoop working up the courage to ring the bell, wouldn&#39;t see her.<br><br>&quot;Careful!&quot; she hissed, and they both rested, watching Candie. &quot;I think she&#39;s going into the bank.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nope. This is &#39;Maddie&#39;s House&#39;,&quot; Jay murmured. &quot;There are two bits inside, so we&#39;ll have to hide. Or be really, really careful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;d go for hide,&quot; Rhus replied. &quot;Either that or—got an SEP?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A Somebody Else&#39;s Problem field. I&#39;d guess not, then... they&#39;re useful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Makes-Things refuses to give me anything more complicated than a Character Analysis Device v. 3.1. And after the Hogwarts Happy Snape incident, not even that. I use the old litmus paper.&quot; 
<br>What I take from this is:<br><br>1. The canon doesn&#39;t help agents hide from Suvians.<br>2. An SEP field would, if the agents had one.<br>3. The canon&#39;s cloaking effect and the SEP field&#39;s effect are complementary, but different.<br><br>Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t know or wasn&#39;t thinking of that when I wrote <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/gizmo.html#patch">this</a>:<br><br> The second function of the flash patch is to generate a weak Somebody Else&#39;s Problem field around the wearer. This enables agents to walk through a word world unseen by the canons, yet leaves them susceptible to being spotted by Sues should they draw attention to themselves. The reason for this is simple: the agents are there to help the canon, therefore they are not the canon&#39;s problem—the canon ignores them. However, they are there to kill the Sue—they are the Sue&#39;s problem, so the SEP field is less effective. 
<br>As far as I can recall, everyone thought the SEP field explanation was a good idea at the time. So, that&#39;s where it went wrong. Mea culpa.<br><br>The good news is, I too can edit things. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I was thinking about creating an upgrade to the SEP field that enhances a Sue&#39;s self-centered thoughts.  Basically it would allow agents to stand in the corner of their bedroom and MAYBE not be noticed if they hold still.  But if the SEP field can already do that, then I could just go on without mentioning anything.</p>

            <p>Ahem. I think it&#39;s clear that the SEP field Rhus is talking about is the full version - we might imagine that her next step if Jay had one would be to paint them both pink. After all, part of the operation of a full SEP is to render something unnoticable <i>if there&#39;s something unusual about it</i>. You can&#39;t just throw it up around a mountain - you have to make the mountain inherently strange as well. And PPC disguises are designed to make you <i>not</i> inherently strange.<br><br>As to why agents don&#39;t use these as standard? Well, other than because it&#39;s boring, we know agents are prone to breaking things - and that&#39;s hardened PPC technology. Maybe it&#39;s as simple as, SEP tech can&#39;t be hardened and keep it operating correctly. Or, a full SEP field requires a decently-sized bit of kit - and no-one wants to lug that around.<br><br>Your description matches (roughly) with what I&#39;ve been saying, and with what I believe is the situation in most spinoffs - agents aren&#39;t the canons&#39; problem, so the SEP is effective; since they emphatically <i>are</i> the &#39;Sue&#39;s problem, it does nothing there. It <i>can</i> be interpreted as imparting minimal shielding - the kind that lets you stand in the corner of a room and the OC will miss you - but doesn&#39;t require it.<br><br>I also have an unwritten discussion of two possible timelines of use; I&#39;ll craft it if anyone&#39;s interested.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Perhaps even overweening noobs.<br><br>Anyway... do you happen to know offhand where H2G2 says the bit about the shielded thing needing to be inherently unusual for the field to work?

Without going through everything, I can at least say with certainty that I&#39;ve referred to each at different times. In this post it sounds like you&#39;re preferring an interpretation that has the SEP effect overlapping with the canon-cloaking effect rather than complementing it, but I thought you were advocating for the two being separate before—so as to not make the canon-cloaking obsolete.

            <p>The bit I&#39;m thinking of is the introduction to the concept of SEP - it&#39;s the long-winded story about a bet to make a mountain invisible, which ends with something along the lines of &#39;If they&#39;d lived a few thousand years later, they could have painted the mountain pink, erected a simple SEP field over it, and the inspectors would have walked all over it without noticing&#39;. Additionally, the bistromath-powered spaceship is pink, too. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s outright <i>stated</i>, but it&#39;s at least implied.<br><br>You&#39;re right about the disguises - during the TOS era. But nowadays most LotR-agents go in as elves, choosing blending in over suitability for assassination. (Or am I wrong? My excuse for <i>my</i> agents is that they&#39;re DOGA, not DMS... heh)<br><br>I don&#39;t know how you have used the SEP - do you actually mention it frequently, or leave it as implied? And, well, my <i>preference</i> would be for the SEP to be entirely absent... but I can&#39;t have that! (Though I still think it makes sewing flash patches on ridiculously complicated). What I was trying to describe was how I thought it usually worked in stories, which in my mind is basically synonymous with - indeed, often driving out - the canon-cloaking effect. Which is a shame.<br><br>But am I wrong? I&#39;m happy to be wrong...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll flip through H2G2 and see if I can distill those parts into something short and pithy. Thanks!<br><br>I don&#39;t know about everybody else, but I think there&#39;s a time and a place for blending in with the location vs. blending in as a canonical killer. I think it always struck me as a little more of a strain to buy nobody noticing Orcs in Rivendell than to buy an Elf killing something generally treated as non-human and evil, even if it claims to be an Elf. On the other hand, you don&#39;t want to go around killing things in the form of a race specifically noted for not doing so. But most canons don&#39;t have a lot of hard and fast rules for who can and can&#39;t kill what, so that&#39;s not always an issue; but blending in with the location is almost always a viable concern. (I do think it often comes down to a matter of taste, though. Orcs are icky, Elves are pretty, etc.)<br><br>Thinking about canon vs. SEP, I recall wondering what makes the agents so special that the <i>canon itself</i> would go out of its way to help them, and I think that might&#39;ve been the impetus for coming up with an alternative explanation in the form of the SEP field. I love TOS and I&#39;m all for being as loyal to it as possible, and yet, when I think about it, it strikes me as a little high and mighty of us to take it for granted that Canon recognizes us and gives us special treatment. Perhaps, just maybe, it&#39;s okay to let that one go?<br><br>But either way, there&#39;s no reason for the SEP field to become so powerful the agents are effectively invisible until they stab someone. {; P<br><br>~Neshomeh, flip-flopping.</p>

Almost all of those agents are described as wearing black. Morgan&#39;s Klingon partner, and Anya&#39;s partner Suzay (a Twi&#39;lek), could potentially be in disguise - we never see them anywhere else - but there&#39;s no reason to assume they are.<br><br>By 2002, disguising yourself as something that could plausibly kill a Sue was commonplace in the DMS. The situation in the DIC is less clear - the one mission J&amp;A take where they don&#39;t have to kill anything (Mission 20), there&#39;s no mention of disguises - and while Sean and Lux appear to be out of disguise in Mission 7 (Sean has blue hair), they&#39;re, well, Sean and Lux.<br><br>Then by 2004, when Dafydd started getting missions... well, he&#39;s technically not in the DMS, but he does a lot of killing, and... huh. I&#39;m having trouble finding mention of disguises, actually; he goes in as an elf in the first mission, but that&#39;s to a city that&#39;s &#39;terribly racist against elves&#39;, and there&#39;s discussion that at least implies he&#39;s thinking about the kill.<br><br>Even Narto, in &#39;05, has an explanation beyond &#39;blending in&#39; for wearing an elven disguise - he&#39;s going to the Undying Lands, where there pretty much <i>isn&#39;t</i> anything but elves. Second mission, orcs. It&#39;s only in the third mission that he seems to go directly for &#39;blending in&#39;, though it&#39;s still debatable on two grounds - would orcs really be able to kill someone in Lorien, and would elves really <i>not</i> be suitable, given that we&#39;re talking about humans in the heavily guarded Golden Wood?<br><br>O-kay. I was going to go on to craft a theory about disguises, canon-cloaking, and SEP fields on the basis of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uyY7ugbeCepIb_VirsCPh-OeWV8kNukM1YxxWilDLwg/edit#bookmark=id.1crpb5cgc02j">Abstract Canonical Entanglement theory</a>, but... I&#39;m no longer sure how disguises are currently used. Do people... no, do agents who are specifically there to make a kill <i>actually</i> go for &#39;blending in&#39; rather than &#39;suitable killer&#39;? I was certain they did - but since it&#39;s not even the case in <b>my own spinoffs</b>, I&#39;m not so positive any more.<br><br>(On canon-cloaking: ACE allows it to be explained as the canon cloaking pretty much anything that comes in <i>through</i> it but is not <i>of</i> it. PPC portals funnel through the canon to access badfics, whereas Sues come in via World One. That would make it a physical law which doesn&#39;t specifically benefit the PPC, but would equally apply to Ispace, Jurisfiction, and random travellers.<br><br>(Alternately, if you accept that &#39;canon&#39; has some kind of personality and intelligence... why <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> it recognise PPC agents? Their portals are fairly distinctive, after all)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>However, in some of my missions disguise are more of a vague &quot;make the character design fit&quot; as they&#39;re in continua where... well, modern humans are commonplace.<br><br>There was a &quot;suitable attacker&quot; situation just once, actually, and that was taken care of with a DORKS when the Agents were already in the fic.<br><br>In the end, I think it&#39;s more of a situational decision - is blending in during the &quot;investigation&quot; part more important than being a plausible attacker during the &quot;termination&quot; part in that particular mission?

            <p>I think it makes a bit more sense to look like you would belong during the gathering of charges.  Even if the Sue sees you, it would be harder for her to realize you don&#39;t belong if you&#39;re part of the scenery.  Making use of the &quot;Beneath Notice&quot; trope.<br><br>&quot;The common &#39;ninja uniform&#39; of black pajamas and a face mask comes from exploiting this quality in the audience of Japanese theater. Throughout the play, stage hands dressed in this manner would be visible during the play, but ignored as just part of the scenery. Because of this, they were the perfect place to stick a ninja into the script—to the audience, they would be appearing out of nowhere.&quot;<br><br>I still haven&#39;t started keeping a log of what I&#39;ve read, but I&#39;ve seen a few newer LOTR missions where the agents&#39; presence suddenly made the characters more aware that the Sue isn&#39;t supposed to be there, or they&#39;re simply too shocked/neuralyzed to protect her as she&#39;s dragged off.</p>

            <p>The presentation is a bit patchworky - I was writing notes and ended up with a full theory - but I think the &#39;inductive reasoning&#39; style works well for this.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Agents reach badfic via plothole<br><br>Since HQ is situated in canon, the plothole is registered by the canon as being part of itself.<br><br>Canon characters do not notice plotholes in their own works.<br><br>Therefore, canon characters do not notice agents arriving through plotholes linked to their own works.<br><br>Originally, this canon-cloaking was &#39;perfect&#39;; the agents wore disguises to hide themselves from OCs only, and often didn&#39;t wear them at all.<br><br>In 1998 fanfiction.net launched, and in 2001, &#39;Fellowship&#39; came out.<br><br>This combination of events led to a massive increase in the volume of fanfic.<br><br>According to ACE, badfic alters the canon it&#39;s based on.<br><br>The badfic surge destabilised the canon worlds.<br><br>As an emergency measure, agents were required to reduce plothole formation during their missions. They were ordered to a) use disguises which would plausibly kill each Mary Sue (or other sporking mechanism), and b) reduce their use of portals within the fic.<br><br>Unfortunately, the kill-centric disguises led to more strain on the canon, since agents were now asking canon characters to routinely ignore their direst enemies prancing around in front of them.<br><br>At the same time, the general destabilisation was rendering the canon less capable of distinguishing canon and uncanonical plotholes.<br><br>To battle the twofold crisis facing the PPC - PPC-created plotholes damaging the canon, and PPC agents becoming noticable to canon characters - Makes-Things modified H2G2 SEP field technology.<br><br>The original SEP required a thing to be distinctly unusual in order to render it unnoticed.<br><br>Makes-Things deduced that it would be possible to reverse this effect: rather than making canons think of unusual agents as somebody else&#39;s problem, he could make canons think of agents who <i>fitted in</i> as <b>nobody&#39;s</b> problem.<br><br>What is technically known as Nobody&#39;s Problem technology (but universally as SEP anyway) was rolled out around 2004.<br><br>Under NP protection, agents were required to wear disguises that let them blend in. If the canons thought they were normal, they would become Nobody&#39;s Problem.<br><br>The NP field also renders agent-related plotholes - portals, and random murders - Nobody&#39;s Problem as far as the canon itself is concerned.<br><br>This latter fact allowed canon-cloaking to work again, covering for the fact that agents are rather unusual regardless of their disguise - they sneak around spying on people. But canon-cloaking will hide that.<br><br>As far as OCs go: when the agents fit in with the OC&#39;s story, they are Nobody&#39;s Problem; they can hang around in the background without being noticed. But as soon as they start doing things that would be mentioned in the story if it were part of it, they become unusual. Since OCs are not part of the canon, there is no canon-cloaking effect.<br><br>Essentially, then, NP fields have zero effect on OCs (since agents who fit in silently are functionally identical to bit parts who do the same thing). With canon characters, they mask the plotholes agents create, thereby allowing canon-cloaking to augment the NP effect and make agents functionally invisible.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The essential core of that is: disguises should be as unobtrusive as possible to aid the SEP (technically NP) field. The NP works - but is fundamentally useless - against OCs. Against canon characters, it re-enables canon-cloaking, which then augments it to become effective invisibility.<br><br>I <i>think</i> this theory works. So where have I gone wrong and what have I missed?<br><br>hS</p>

It may actually be two questions, one about canons, one about OCs, with the options as: hide you from them unless you make yourself noticable, hide you from them completely, simply make them less likely to notice you hanging around, no effect at all.<br><br>CC 1: Basic, no problem.<br>CC 2: And here you&#39;ve merged the idea of SEP 2 with my SEP 3. I think you&#39;d be better separating them, for clarity&#39;s sake. Also, this question assumes you know precisely how an SEP field is thought to operate - which is part of what we&#39;re trying to find out!<br><br>D 1: Basic, no problem.<br>D 2: I think this needs an option 2.5 - trying to balance &#39;likely to kill&#39; with &#39;something at least probable&#39;. Oh, you may also want an extra last option - &#39;whatever seems coolest&#39;. Ents. ;) I say no more.<br>D 3: Seems fairly comprehensive. <br><br>CA: No problems, good question.<br><br>Thank you for doing this!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>-I approve of CC3 (though it still doesn&#39;t establish what people think <i>either</i> of them do...)<br><br>-Disguises 2 looks good, though it does specify &#39;kill the Sue&#39;, which... well, we&#39;ve had arguments before about the PPC being More Than Just Killing Stuff. In the same manner as referring to &#39;PPC community members&#39; rather than &#39;Boarders&#39;, you might want to tweak that. &#39;Kill any OCs present&#39; might work, or simply &#39;kill the badfic&#39;.

So that&#39;s good?<br><br>h--<br><br>OH BUT WAIT.<br><br>I see you have hidden questions. Back to look.<br><br>-SEP 3: Seems pretty comprehensive.<br>-SEP 4&amp;5 are just repeats with different subjects, so no complaints there. In this case Sue is the only relevant word in SEP5, and furthermore doesn&#39;t require your agents to actually take on Mary-Sues, so no objection there.<br>-SEP 6: option 3 is &#39;the Force&#39;! Yeah, this seems comprehensive.<br>-With this in mind, I assume CC4 is the box for listing the differences if you think there are any. That could probably do with clarifying.<br><br>h--<br><br>dear sweet lady Nessa, there&#39;s <i>more</i>?<br><br>-Departmental exceptions: you might want to at least list Intelligence, since they spend a lot of time in badfics.

            <p>I have never thought of canon-cloaking as “the canon protects the agents because the PPC is so awesome”. It is just the canon’s standard behavior I would expect. Attempting to preserve what the canon’s author wrote, intruders to the word world are ignored whenever possible, and are easily forgotten when they fade into the background after an interaction that wasn’t damaging. <br><br>Like you said in a previous post, it is a physical law applying to all kinds of trans-dimensional travelers, not just the PPC. But it would also apply to “touristy” OCs who just enjoy the sightseeing and mind their own business, not trying to interact with canon characters or going from Rivendell to Mirkwood within an hour. Of course, most OC’s purpose is to interact, so canon is forced to notice them. But going meta, minding their own business – Sue hunting, exorcising and disentangling – and occasional sightseeing, never interfering with canon, is what agents do in a PPC x badfic x (insert continuum here) crossover. Thus canon-cloaking doesn’t depend on coming in through special portals or on the PPC being part of every canon.<br><br>Concerning the SEP field, my head canon has been that it doesn’t actually exist in the PPC. It’s a metaphor used by some agents when they mean to say “we go unnoticed as long as we don’t foolishly act in a way that makes somebody aware that we might be a problem”. Agents use it to describe canon-cloaking as well as the average Sues’, Stus’ and Wraiths’ inability or unwillingness to notice anything that doesn’t fit the story lines they have in mind for themselves. (Going meta again, this inability may be the badfic’s attempt to preserve what its author wrote, and it may be hard to overcome, even if suethors try to make their Stus more observant.) <br><br>Apparently some agents are aware that “something” is built into their flash patches, and some agents believe that this is an SEP field generator. But where is the evidence? May it be something else (not necessarily a contact neuralyzer)? Where do they keep their universal translators? Aren’t these things built into the flash patches? Considering Kelok’s adventure mentioned by Miah below, it is difficult to ignore a bleeding man in your house, especially when you are a medical doctor, so there is still no evidence that there was a SEP field generator built into the damaged flash patch. <br><br>But if we need to have SEP field technology in the PPC, then I like your outline of how the NP field came into being.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Oh I like that. Both this and the idea that it is all equally true. Kelok believes there is a SEP field, and that&#39;s why he&#39;s seen, but it is just as valid to assume he is seen because an injured person would be someone Watson would notice immediately.<br><br>This theory also works for the time Cali mentions it, because it is entirely true that people dragging bodies through the halls of a hospital would draw immediate attention no matter how much they otherwise look like they belong.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s perfectly acceptable to simply write missions on the basis of &#39;canons can&#39;t see agents, OCs can, that&#39;s just how it is&#39;. The end result of all this theorising is basically fixed - but I personally find it fun to theorise. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uyY7ugbeCepIb_VirsCPh-OeWV8kNukM1YxxWilDLwg/edit#bookmark=id.1crpb5cgc02j">Multiverse Theory</a> is a similarly pointless exercise in pseudo-scientific analysis of a string of jokes. I just enjoy it. ^-~<br><br>(And, for the record, my own head-canon is that the physical laws of the PPC multiverse will rise up to meet any reasonable theory which is put forth about them. All theories are true, for a given value of true - so canon-cloaking is a simple trait of canon-visitor interactions, <i>and</i> it works because of channelled portals, <i>and</i> it&#39;s because agents are Just That Awesome, <i>and</i> the canon is intelligent and does it deliberately, <i>and</i> it doesn&#39;t exist at all. All at&#39;t same time!)<br><br>You&#39;re right that, basically, agents don&#39;t know most of the answers - and all sources are of necessity &#39;in-universe&#39;. The compiler of Nesh&#39;s list of gizmos thinks there&#39;s an electronic SEP generator under the flashpatch - but unless she happens to be an SEP engineer, she&#39;s no more reliable a source than anyone else. The only person who <i>knows</i> is probably Makes-Things, and maybe Hornbeam - but do you really think M-T is going to sit down over a beer and discuss his job? I can&#39;t see it, m&#39;sel.<br><br>Ultimately, the best way to handle all this is to list the observed <i>effects</i>, and try to keep them consistent - then describe the theories that have been built up around them. (&#39;Multiverse Theory&#39; is a genuine in-universe scientific theory - with zero statements made about how well it describes the true nature of things. If ACE is complete gibberish, my latest canon-cloaking explanation is simply impossible!)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>At the least, it seems like canons can still notice and interact with agents if attention is drawn to them, they&#39;re pointed out, whatever. They initially ignore them but it&#39;s not like the agents are completely invisible to them; I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen a few missions, recent and otherwise, where a Sue has pointed out agents, or the agents have been seen by the canons when they&#39;ve done something to attention.</p>

            <p>I think the first few steps are a little shaky: despite the in-universe fact that the PPC is situated within canon worlds, I still find the claim that that makes it part of canon very dubious from both an in-universe and an out-of-universe standpoint. OOU, I cringe at the thought of claiming we&#39;re so canon-loving and awesome that we can write ourselves into canon, and the canon thinks we&#39;re actually part of it. I know nobody&#39;s actually saying that, but it&#39;s really easy to get there from &quot;the canon recognizes PPC plotholes as being part of itself.&quot; What, just because we claim we&#39;ve got a tunnel under a mountain? Well, what about authors who claim they&#39;ve got a whole country in there? Aren&#39;t their characters and associated plotholes then part of canon, too? ... It&#39;s a touch hypocritical.<br><br>IU, first of all, doesn&#39;t ACE keep us metaphysically separate despite the apparent physical connection? Also, what about worlds where the PPC doesn&#39;t have a bit of HQ stashed? Or are we assuming that there&#39;s at least one square meter of hallway in every conceivable universe throughout all of time? That also sounds rather dubious to me.<br><br>However, by the end of the logic train, I think we have a nice explanation for how things work that doesn&#39;t require us to make any special claims about our relationship to the multiverse. The canon-cloaking effect becomes more a technological illusion than a perk of being an awesome canon-loving PPCer, which I can live with.<br><br>Tangentially, feel like making a survey for the Board at large about how they use disguises, SEP fields, canon-cloaking, etc., and how they&#39;ve seen those things used elsewhere? More data to base your theories on would be good, yes? I&#39;d do it, but I&#39;m working on something else at the moment, and I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s very secret and mysterious, so I can&#39;t explain it right now. Hopefully I&#39;ll have something to show for myself in the next week or so, though. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Some interesting excerpts from the logs of RC 999:<br><br>Mission 3 - Explicit mention of canon-cloaking:<br><br> Woman and Andalite turned to see the Weyrleader himself cresting the stairs. Ilraen hid himself behind the dragon, sensing that the presence of a blue alien was not going to be helpful at this time. What was left of the canon helpfully cloaked him in obscurity once more. 
<br><br>Mission 4 - A mention of the SEP field where I probably should have used canon-cloaking:<br><br> &quot;This does nae seem tae be the right place,&quot; he said, a note of panic in his voice. He had just realized that he was standing mere feet behind Arthas Menethil, the Lich King. He motioned for Nume to be quiet and slowly edged toward the door.<br><br>Nume followed more casually, poking crossly at the RA. Not being familiar with the Warcraft Universe, he didn&#39;t appreciate the gravity of the situation, and he trusted the SEP field to keep them from notice. 
<br><br>And, not strictly related, but here&#39;s me making use of something else that I&#39;m pretty sure got made up for the tech glossary:<br><br> &quot;Also,&quot; Nume added, &quot;there&#39;s a bit of technology in the uniform that specifically keeps canonical beings from re-assimilating with their continuum of origin, should they go there on a mission. It wouldn&#39;t do to have agents wandering off to take part in canonical events because they suddenly think they&#39;re random bit-characters again. Just think of the continuum contamination if they got killed, in uniform, with their PPC gear on.&quot; 
<br><br>Mission 5 - On blending in vs. canonical killing:<br><br> On the other side [of the portal], the three experienced a moment of confusion as they suddenly changed from their previous forms to elves. Nume, seeming at home in a Noldorin guise, had been waiting for them with his DORKS, which was currently a jar of jam.<br><br>&quot;No need to stress the canon more than necessary by having orcs in Rivendell, with the shape it&#39;s in,&quot; he said in smug explanation. 
<br><br>Sticking out despite attempting to blend in (and getting away with it):<br><br> Despite the presence of four random Elves lurking in the hallway, one of whom was smoking a Sobranie, neither of the thoroughly brainwashed canons appeared to even notice them. They wandered past, and since their dialogue and actions weren&#39;t defined, the two of them were practically sleepwalking with jaws slack and eyes blank. 
<br><br>Not being noticed when they really should have been but for extenuating circumstances:<br><br> &quot;You know, this is weird. We shouldn&#39;t be able to do this kind of stuff! We&#39;re twenty-five feet away and the Stu didn&#39;t even blink!&quot;<br><br>Indeed, Archir appeared not to have noticed any of it. Galadriel was still cuddling him and rubbing circles on his back, which was admittedly something that would&#39;ve distracted anybody, but the thrashing homicidal maniac normally would&#39;ve attracted some attention.<br><br>Suicide glanced up at the Words and shook his head. &quot;He&#39;s busy,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;Haven&#39;t you noticed? Every time we&#39;ve made a disruption, he&#39;s been busy nestling up against some incredibly powerful canon. He&#39;s . . . feeding, or something.&quot; 
<br><br>Mission 6.1 -  Being noticed appropriately and rolling with it:<br><br> After being dismissed, Alex and his two supposed partners stepped into the elevator. Orken jumped in after them, followed by Thomas the agent and Ilraen. The Sue gave him a suspicious look.<br><br>Orken straightened his tie and effected a thoroughly awful British accent. &quot;We&#39;re security. Don&#39;t want anything to happen to you before this very important mission you&#39;re going on.&quot;<br><br>The Sue nodded. &quot;Very good! I&#39;m glad to see that nothing will get in our way of defeating Voldemort.&quot; 
<br><br>And an explicit mention of the SEP field at work:<br><br> The three agents clambered aboard the Hogwarts Express, eliciting a few puzzled looks from random students who weren&#39;t used to seeing adults on the train at all, let alone in Muggle suits. However, the looks slid off them as soon as they landed thanks to the combination of the Sue&#39;s presence changing things to accommodate the idea and their own SEP fields. 
<br><br>Mission 7 - Hiding in plain sight with help from the SEP field when there&#39;s no canon to rely on:<br><br> With Nume in the lead, the agents crossed one by one into the Word World of the story. They found themselves in a Generic Room, featureless except for one window and a bed. They could see through the window that &quot;the sky was blue out.&quot; In the bed, there were two people, one of whom was stirring under the covers. There was nowhere to hide and no canon background to blend in with, so the PPCers clustered in a corner and kept still, relying on their Somebody Else&#39;s Problem fields to keep them from being noticed. 
<br><br>And one from RC 1110, Mission 3 - The SEP field noted likely to be ineffective:<br><br> He crept forward and slipped down into the dell, careful to disturb the ground as little as possible. With the hobbits and Vanyagorn on high alert, his SEP field wouldn&#39;t stand up to so much as a hard look in his direction. 
<br><br>Apart from these snippets, there&#39;s generally a lot of sneaking around, keeping their distance, finding cover, and/or blending in with the background, the success of which isn&#39;t explicitly attributed to either the canon or the SEP field.<br><br>I leave it to someone else to analyze this and determine what, if anything, it means.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It seems like your explicit mentions of the SEP field barely distinguish it from the canon-cloaking, except in Mission 7 (where, I note, one of the two characters in question is a canon - and did you consider hiding them under the bed? [Ducks]).<br><br>My other question/ponderance is: how widely-known are the SEP fields? I mean among agents, not writers. Because the situation - entirely apart from how they actually work - seems to be one of the following:<br><br>-The agents mostly don&#39;t know about them, which is why Jay and Acy don&#39;t mention them. They were invented/adapted by Makes-Things waaay back in the day (they&#39;re mentioned in Origins 9), and have been used ever since.<br><br>-The agents are generally aware of them, which strongly suggests they didn&#39;t exist in J&amp;A&#39;s time, and were brought in to compensate for the further weakening of canon. That would necessitate a minor edit to Origins, but that&#39;s okay.<br><br>Frustratingly not helping either way is Peter&#39;s breakdown in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=10PA29pvjToL1PCiW3W-NR37R5bB93wZSVFrSpErUtzw">Swansong</a>. He claims that:<br><br>&#39;Everyone except us has all kinds of wiring under those things. They say it’s an SEP generator, but I don’t believe it. It’s a contact neuralyser, designed to wipe people’s brains the instant they realize what’s going on.&#39;<br><br>(Which, duh, is obviously crazy, though I seem to recall people thinking that I was using the person <i>having a psychotic episode</i> to retcon it...)<br><br>... but doesn&#39;t clarify whether &#39;they say&#39; refers to the Flowers or the agents.<br><br>So is there a clear consensus or conspiracy of silence in the missions? Or should I just edit <i>Origins</i> and leave the question open?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Maybe the agents being largely aware of them is just something that has happened over time? They existed in the time of TOS, but no one much knew about them. PPC tech in general was more restricted and mysterious at that time, I think.<br><br>Over time the agents who knew about it told others who told others and it slowly snowballed into a pretty general knowledge.<br><br>I always thought of my first agents knowing about it from the beginning, but they don&#39;t actually mention it directly until their 7th mission. The same one they are janitors in. (Agent Miah means with a tranquilizer when she says this, btw)<br><br><i>&quot;I’d shoot you, but then I’d have to write the charge list,” Miah replied, patting her holstered tranquilizer dart gun.<br><br>Cali smirked at her. &quot;Suuuure you would. People in HQ might not notice someone dragging a body wrapped in a sheet around the halls, but I bet it would break the SEP field here. Uh, how far ahead did you read on this?”</i><br><br>It&#39;s mentioned in the first mission for Kelok and Unger, but not explained, just mentioned as if it is assumed to be common knowledge.<br><br>But, my real point here is that none of my agents were in the PPC before 2008 (no missions before 2010), and three of them joined in 2010. There is a lot of time for knowledge to spread between TOS and my stuff, and even more between TOS and now.</p>

            <p>The Sue is reading a notebook. The reason the agents go unnoticed is that she&#39;s so absorbed in it that she doesn&#39;t look up. They then move as silently as possible to the far side of the room - presumably into some form of unmentioned cover. &#39;Silas hissed, as soon as he dared to breathe again&#39;; he didn&#39;t dare breathe because doing so might have made the Sue look up - and them being in her bedroom might have been difficult to explain!<br><br>Yes, it somewhat strains credibility that they could pop into existence two feet from someone and she&#39;d not notice - <i>that&#39;s</i> where Rule of Funny comes in, because having them sneak away in terror, and Mary being so absorbed and/or oblivious that she still doesn&#39;t notice them - is funnier than them simply appearing on the far side of the room. But there are few-to-no situations where appealing to the Rule of Funny would justify making agents <i>invisible</i> to a Sue. How would it?

            <p>The first, is - well, yes, the canon should ignore the agents. They don&#39;t exist in the Words, and so therefore, unless they draw attention to themselves, it shouldn&#39;t matter what species they are.<br><br>For the parts where they do need to interact with the canon, as well as simply to make sure they avoid attracting attention by their very existence, there are Disguise Generators. Jay and Acacia basically became orcs (or Uruk Hai, I forget) for one mission.</p>

            <p>What happens if your agents go into a world that is populated by things that want to kill you? Do they ignore you like the rest of the canon? Or does something else happen? I was mainly thinking about the Attack On Titan (which I LOVE) where the Titans are driven by their need to feed on human flesh. Or Walkers from the walking dead- which I know nothing about. I feel like keeping theese threats In mind would add to the suspense of the mission. <br>                                                                       </p>

            <p>(And the pop culture they clearly caused)<br><br>There are some things in modern pop culture that seem to stick out as basically inexplicable. Things which happened, or didn&#39;t happen, for no discernable reason. Well, this is the thread that explains it all:<br><br>Time travellers.<br><br>Meddling time travellers.<br><br>Yes, when things seem to make no sense, the only possible explanation is violation of causality. A few examples from me:<br><br>-The cancellation of <i>Firefly</i>. Why was there never a second season? Simple: time travellers. In the timeline where there <i>was</i> a Season 2, it was excruciatingly bad - so time travellers came back and stopped it being made.<br><br>-And of course, the next logical step: the later seasons of <i>Heroes</i> and <i>Lost</i>. Shows which were absolutely brilliant until their sudden cancellation, so time travellers came back to ensure they continued - only to discover that it would have been better for them to stay dead.<br><br>-The revival of <i>Doctor Who</i>. Hey, I never said they were all <i>bad</i> things. Despite its popularity now, back in &#39;05 there was no reason to think &#39;that show with Colin Baker in a stupid coat&#39; would ever be a success again - except time travellers.<br><br>-Tolkien&#39;s inability to publish anything after LotR. This is actually a <i>failure</i> of time travellers. Originally, Tolkien finished a bunch of minor works - <i>The Lost Road</i>, <i>The Notion Club Papers</i>, maybe even <i>The Lay of Leithian</i>, <i>Tal-Elmar</i>, and <i>The New Shadow</i>. But some meddling time traveller couldn&#39;t stand the fact that all this publication prevented him from working on the full <i>Silmarillion</i>, so went back and changed his priorities - only to give us the &#39;worst of both worlds&#39;, where J.R.R. didn&#39;t get <i>anything</i> to publication quality.<br><br>-Our current fascination with comic book movies. This one actually deserves a trailer monologue:<br><br><i><b>In the darkness of the future, an increasingly bitter and jaded world needs a hero. But not just any hero - they need a <u>superhero</u>. There&#39;s only one problem: such characters are the creations of comic books, and the great publishing houses which wrought them folded long ago.<br><br>Now, the world&#39;s last comic book geek must undertake a perilous mission. Diving into the deep past, into the very first days of the twenty-first century, she must rescue the comics industry. To save the future, she must preserve the popularity of superheroes - no matter what the cost.</b></i><br><br>It&#39;s the only explanation that makes sense! And I have no doubt that you can find more examples... ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Does that take into account all the ways Firefly has continued anyway?

            <p>The original <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Farscape</i> both went through similar ordeals of cancellation due to low Nielsen ratings, massive fan outcry, and partial revival. TOS got syndicated (I think is the word), and the popularity of the reruns led to movies and the launch of the gigantic franchise we know today. FS got a two-part miniseries and continuation in a line of comics. There are reports of a <i>Farscape</i> movie in the early stages of development, too, but I&#39;ll get excited about that when there are actual trailers. Anyway, clearly more time travelers are responsible!<br><br>In the case of TOS, I think the time travelers came back to make sure <i>Star Trek</i> lived. In the alternate timeline where it faded into obscurity, the ground it broke didn&#39;t stay broke, and the world became a lot less awesome.<br><br>As for <i>Farscape</i>, it&#39;s possible that we were saved from a really terrible fifth season—things did get pretty weird in the fourth, even by <i>Farscape</i> standards. However, I think it&#39;s more likely that it was sabotage. Instead of FS season five, we got more <i>Stargate: SG-1</i> with Ben Browder and Claudia Black poached from their other <s>better</s> roles. Clearly our time traveler was a <i>Stargate</i> fanboy with dastardly designs. Frell you, unknown <i>Stargate</i> fanboy! To Hezmana with you and all your offspring!<br><br>~Neshomeh, who might still be a touch bitter, just a touch.</p>

            <p>I have been bouncing around the idea of my currently work in progress agent having a small hand mirror that changes his face, hair, and hair color. Obviously it won&#39;t replace the disguise generator and will probably only be used for comedic purposes. The mirror itself is quasi-canonical to the Adventure Quest continua. There is a mirror that does that but there is seemingly only one, it is much bigger, and the changes would only ever be temporary unlike the full sized one.</p>

            <p>The DORKS would probably be far more affective than most things if one knows how to use it correctly. Of course if I go with my agent being woefully incompetent with technology would result in the situations where it becomes necessary would increase.</p>

            <p><b>Beware the Ides of March: PPC’s Shakespeare Troupe Celebrates March 15 with Gallifreyan Julius Caesar</b><br><br><em>Nita Incog, Editor-In-Chief and Stand-In Critic for Stan Grayson, Who Came Down With a Bad Case of Lungworm and Couldn’t Go to the Performance We Got Tickets For</em><br><br>4.5/5 stars<br> dir. John Naki<br> March 15 – May 30, Saturdays at 7PM<br><br>A Troupe By Any Other Name, the PPC’s own Shakespearean acting company—or in their own words, a “loose confederation of directors who wrangle various Agents into doing Shakespeare”—celebrated the Ides of March by opening a production of <em>Julius Caesar</em> set on Gallifrey. The tragedy follows the story of Marcus Brutus and how he is led to his own downfall when he joins the conspiracy to kill Julius Caesar, the dictator of Rome.<br><br>This Gallifreyan <em>Caesar </em>opens on the eve of the Time War, with a Caesar who greatly resembles Rassilon, the real-life leader of the Time Lords around the time of the Time War. However, the play diverts from the actual events of the Time War when Brutus and the conspirators, most notable amongst them Caius Cassius, assassinate Rassilon-Caesar in the Panopticon of the Gallifreyan Capitol. The events that unfold afterwards spark a different kind of Time War, after Mark Antony incites the citizens of Gallifrey to seek revenge against Brutus and Cassius for their fallen leader. After this, the play turns its focus from conspiracy to atonement, set against the chaos of this new Time Lord civil war.<br><br>The performances of Brutus and Cassius in the first half of the play seem cold and distant at times, if not slightly wooden, but this changes dramatically during the infamous ‘tent scene’ in Act IV scene iii, when the two of them have an argument. Here, Cassius’s acting in particular begins to shine and take on a very passionate (if not slightly personal) air. I personally felt transported along the same emotions that Cassius experiences in this moment, enjoying the catharsis that the scene affords them and Brutus. It could even be said that for these two actors, art imitates life.<br><br>The Gallifreyan setting will pleasantly surprise those who may fear that it will overwhelm the plot of the play, as it only serves in this production to highlight the political destruction wreaked on both Gallifrey and Rome by the actions of these characters. The only real distraction are the funny collars, which do briefly detract from some of the more emotionally powerful moments of the play. Audiences will also be delighted to see familiar Time Lord faces in the cast, as practically all of the Time Lord Agents in HQ are in this cast. Particularly amusing amongst them is the Fisherman’s (DF) brief poetic cameo just before the curtain call, with a couple other minor characters by his side.<br><br>The curtain call and costume reveal will also surprise and, in some cases, delight the audience. Particularly striking is the casting choice for Brutus, who is not a Time Lord and yet perfectly suited to the character’s honourable nature. Another interesting casting choice is for the minor character Titinius, whose actor did not even show up for curtain call. Who is Titinius? Who plays Titinius? Perhaps future performances will reveal them to us, but as of now they remain as mysterious and plothole-esque as their character.<br><br><em>Julius Caesar</em> will run until May 30<sup>th</sup>, and I highly recommend you wrangle some free time from your missions to catch it, even if it’s only to see the Time Lord Agents stabbing each other on the stage.<br><br>--<br><br><strong>Comments</strong><br><br><strong>Cale Serfe, DF – 15 March 2014</strong><br> While Brutus and Cassius are, of course, played very well, I couldn’t help but be, well, disappointed at the lack of kissing. I mean, would it have killed them to hold hands for a few minutes, at the very least? All they did was hug each other and cry! The tent scene should’ve merited a scorching kiss, at the very least. I’m sure everyone else is as disappointed as I am, and perhaps there’ll be a change to come in the next performance...<br><br><strong>Elysa Webber, DO – 15 March 2014</strong><br> You know, when Cassius first came onstage and started to speak—especially in that first scene with Brutus—I felt sure that the casting had been a complete failure. I mean, the ‘I pray you, do’ line alone—not to mention what follows—well, it came out completely wooden, and the rest of the scene wasn&#39;t much better. I got no sense that Cassius wanted to be around Brutus at all, let alone be his friend! Brutus himself was only slightly better: he called Cassius friend with more anger and resentment than anything else, and spent most of the scene looking frustrated or blank. Cassius, too, found some resentment and frustration, somewhere around the first ‘flourish and shout’, and even managed to dredge up some fury around ‘I was born as free as Caesar’. That, coupled with the occasional menacing looks at Rassilon Caesar, was the best thing I could see in Cassius’ acting for quite some time. And though Cassius’ hatred of Caesar is a strong and necessary part of the play, it can be argued that his love for Brutus must be stronger still; and I didn’t see much sign of the latter in the first scene!<br> But Cassius—played by the Time Lord called the Reader—proved herself later on. You’ve probably heard people ranting about how great the tent scene was; well, I’m about to join them, because that was the moment I truly felt the casting had been entirely accurate. Such emotion! Such anger, such desperation—and such reconciliation! I truly felt that I was watching something real—and, considering that Kozar (Brutus) and the Reader (Cassius) are rumored to have been having a tough time of things since the Reader replaced Kozar’s partner, I think it&#39;s entirely possible that it was real, and that we saw both a real fight and a real truce/reconciliation happening on stage today.<br> With luck, Kozar and the Reader will be more willing to get into character earlier on in the play, now that they&#39;ve shared so moving a hug. And even if they don’t—the tent scene alone makes watching the play worthwhile. (But don&#39;t even get me started on Calpurnia! And the completely uncanonical attempted stabbing of Mark Antony—well, let&#39;s just say Time Lord politics are pretty amusing!)<br> All in all—a wonderful production. See it as soon as you can!<br><br><strong>Maura Scott, DoSAT – 15 March 2014<br></strong>Really dug the Fisherman and Evie both playing characters called Cinna. That was pretty funny.<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS – 16 March 2014</strong><br> STOP SPOILING ALL THE PARTS. IT’LL RUIN THE PLAY FOR EVERYONE.<br><br><strong>Officer Rooney, DOI – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Hey, Chriss! You were really good as the Soothsayer!<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Thanks!<br><br><strong>Edgar Sullivan, DIC – 16 March 2014<br></strong>I liked the play pretty well, overall, though the sudden reveal of Luxury and Jacques Bonnefoy as the actors playing Portia and Calpurnia respectively was... rather disturbing. Mostly because they were snogging at the time. Bonnefoy was definitely hilarious as Calpurnia, though.<br><br><strong>Nerys Carpenter, DO – 16 March 2014</strong><br> That was hilarious! I really liked the Portia/Calpurnia scene at the end, though. It basically starts with Cal coming onstage going all “I told him, ‘Julie, don’t go’!” and then she bumps into Portia, who giggles and smiles and holds out a hand, and Cal considers it for all of two seconds before shrugging, tearing off her giant mourning collar, and snogging Portia. And then about half a minute in someone realized they weren’t about to stop anytime soon and just removed the disguises. Seriously, even though it turned out to be just Bonnefoy and Lux being their usual selves, I think I might ship Portia/Calpurnia now.<br><br><strong>Luxury, DBS – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Thank you! xoxo I liked the CalPortia scene too!! ;)<br><br><strong>Jacques Bonnefoy, ESAS – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Wanna meet up and continue it? ;))))<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Get a room, you two.<br><br><strong>Jacques Bonnefoy, ESAS – 16 March 2014<br></strong>Thanks, we will!!! ;)))<br><br><strong>Luxury, DBS – 16 March 2014<br></strong>Sounds like a plan!!!!! ;))))<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS – 16 March 2014<br></strong>-facepalms-<br><br><strong>The Agent, DIC – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Don’t we all agree that Morgan was perfect as Rassilon-Caesar?<br><br><strong>Geoffrey Carver, DOI – 16 March 2014<br></strong>Agreed! She was wonderful as Pinterest and Stratosphere, too. You were also really good as Trombone!<br><br><strong>The Disentangler, DIC – 16 March 2014<br></strong>I think you meant Pindarus, Strato, and Trebonius. Thanks anyway.<br><br><strong>The Disentangler, DIC – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Get off my account, Agent.<br><br><strong>Fearn, DTO – 16 March 2014<br></strong>YOU TIME LORDS ARE SO DYSFUNCTIONAL THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO STAB EACH OTHER. RASSILON-CAESAR REGENERATING INTO PINDARUS AND STRATO AMUSED ME GREATLY. CLEARLY THIS PRODUCTION IS PROOF OF THE SUPERIORITY OF THE DALEKS.<br><br><strong>Kate Lynn, DoDAEG – 16 March 2014<br></strong>That was a wonderful adaptation of <em>Julius Caesar</em>. It was my favourite play in high school and to see it done by my fellow Agents was a real treat. Though, I do notice that the Time Lord actors really can’t seem to find a separation between their onstage and offstage drama, since Casca (the Disentangler) tried to stab Mark Antony (the Notary) halfway through Act III and had to be dragged off by Trebonius (the Agent).<br><br><strong>John Naki, DoDAEG – 16 March 2014<br></strong>I told them at every single rehearsal that they needed to stop bickering all the time, but noooooo...<br><br><strong>Officer Rooney, DOI – 17 March 2014<br></strong>Hey, Naki, could you tell us who played Titinius? I’ve got a bet with Jeeves that they’re actually a Gary Stu, given the way they got Cassius to die for them.<br><br><strong>T’Lyra, DAVD – 17 March 2014<br></strong>Only Cassius was affected by his Aura, not anyone else. Titinius cannot be a Stu.<br><br><strong>Brenda Loringham, DMS – 17 March 2014<br></strong>You’re right about Titinius, Rooney, everything he does in the play just screams of Stu! He randomly appears out of nowhere in act IV, says basically nothing until his death scene in act V, and yet apparently he’s Cassius’s best friend who loves him—a title that I could’ve sworn was Brutus’s—and somehow important enough for Cassius to commit suicide over him. If he came up on my console, I would charge and kill him so hard.<br><br><strong>T’Lyra, DAVD – 17 March 2014</strong><br> This lack of lines is precisely why he cannot be a Stu. A Stu would take over the entire play. Titinius is simply a plothole in the background.<br><br><strong>T’Zar, DOGA – 17 March 2014</strong><br> Indeed. While he does possess various Stu-like characteristics, he is simply not sufficiently prevalent to be a true Gary Stu.<br><br><strong>Dawn McKenna, DMS – 17 March 2014</strong><br> Like Agent Kate Lynn, <em>Julius Caesar</em> was one of my favourite plays as a kid. I was especially delighted by the choice of the Fisherman as Cinna the Poet—he took to it with such enthusiasm, and even led an army of poets onstage just before the curtain call! Cinna the Conspirator (Evie)’s participation in that particular scene was pretty hilarious.<br> I could go on and on about all of this—Jacques as Calpurnia, the Notary’s butchering of Mark Antony (just kidding, that definitely had its moments), Brutus and Cassius (believe me, I had no idea my ex-partner could act so well!)—but I want to express my ... well, confusion, really, about a certain character: Titinius. He had almost no lines, came out of nowhere, and became Cassius’ best friend! It made very little sense, honestly. And not only that—the actor who played him never turned up for the casting reveal! What exactly is going on with that?<br> Who is Titinius? Where did he come from? And who played him?<br><br><strong>Gurnirel, SIELU – 18 March 2014</strong><br> I enjoyed the performance; however, I cannot help but wonder how different our own history might have been shaped had there only been put into action a plot to stab Morgoth while we yet resided in Valinor. Fëanáro could perhaps have been a worthy Cassius.<br><br><strong>Naergondir, SIELU – 18 March 2014<br></strong>And yet, sister, I believe that Morgoth—then Melkor—would have been more suited, indeed, for the role of Cassius. For did he not turn Fëanáro’s mind to jealousy concerning the Silmarilli, and thus ensure the downfall of the Two Trees and of the Ñoldor? Melkor&#39;s tongue could sway one such as a Fëanáro: hot of temper, sharp of mind, and never-straying once plighted to his course.<br><br><strong>Gurnirel, SIELU – 18 March 2014<br></strong>It may well be, brother, but who then would be Caesar? Perhaps Finwë?<br><br><strong>Naergondir, SIELU – 18 March 2014<br></strong>Perhaps. Although I would indeed name Nolofinwë in his father&#39;s stead; for Fëanáro loved him not. And still more, dear sister: <em>Julius Caesar</em> deals not with the turning of a son against a father, and thus Finwë Caesar I would not cast. <em>Hamlet</em>, perhaps, could see such casting...<br><br><strong>Eledhwen Elerossiel, DMS – 18 March 2014<br></strong>If the two of you wish to see a production of <em>Julius Caesar</em> set in Arda, please discuss this with the members of A Troupe By Any Other Name in RC 1564 and/or Cubicle 221B Bakery Avenue. <br><br>--<br><br>Notes: Thank you to DawnFire for helping me with this! Apologies to basically everyone who’s created a Time Lord Agent for wrangling them into the production without permission, but if you’re not okay with it, we can just consider it a reporting error (they had another disguise under their disguise. or something).<br><br>Also posted <a href="http://lilywinterwood.tumblr.com/post/90578142992/ppc-multiverse-monitor-beware-the-ides-of-march">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Though whether casting Morgan as Caessilon serves as a warning to her should she abuse her power as Tigereye Castellan, or a subtle encouragement to her should she attempt to gain supreme power... sure, she was forced to regenerate - but then she got to kill the two people who killed <i>her</i>!<br><br>(It is very tempting to start TekTek&#39;ing up cast images at this point... curse you)<br><br>hS</p>

Set on, and leave no ceremony out.<br>    And stop moaning about it.          (Flourish.) <br>  SOOTHSAYER. Caesar!<br>  CAESAR. Ha! Who calls?<br>  CASCA. Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!<br>  THE COMMONERS. Make your mind up!<br>  CAESAR. Who is it in the press that calls on me?<br>    I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,<br>    Cry &quot;Caesar.&quot; Speak, Caesar is turn&#39;d to hear.<br>  SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.<br>  CAESAR. What man is that?<br>  SOOTHSAYER. I’m a woman, good grief.<br>    Nor is my voice ‘shrill’, thank you.<br>  BRUTUS. A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.<br>  CAESAR. Set him before me let me see his face.<br>  SOOTHSAYER. Her face.<br>  CASSIUS. Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.<br>  CAESAR. What say&#39;st thou to me now? Speak once again.<br>  SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.<br>  CAESAR. He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.<br>  SOOTHSAYER. Really? You still can’t tell I’m female?<br>                      (Sennet. Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius.)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I have a handful of other pictures... actually, since they don&#39;t need collars, I can post these two now:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/StratoPindarus.png"><br><br>Caesar&#39;s revenge. ;)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>If someone can give me visual guidance for Kozar and Bonnefoy, I think I can round out the cast images one way or another. Also, did Eledhwen play anyone? I can&#39;t imagine she didn&#39;t, with her partner involved...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Actually, I don&#39;t think we had Eledhwen playing anyone. I&#39;m just going to sneakily cast her as one of the conspirators. Probably either Decius Brutus or Metellus Cimber, and probably doubled with either Flavius or Marullus. <br><br>Also laughing at the dress rehearsal. Usually people keep the language (I recently watched a genderswapped High School AU of this play and I laughed every time male!Portia called himself Brutus&#39;s wife) of the original, but this is hilarious.<br><br>(after I draw Brutus and Cassius as Klingons, I may need to make this even more of a thing. also, Bonnefoy looks like Jack Harkness and Kozar&#39;s a Klingon.)</p>

            <p>Given the way you&#39;ve described the play, it&#39;s fairly obvious that the agents were in full disguise, including their faces. But that would be boring! So I decided to turn it into what&#39;s more of a fusion crossover - as if the actors were actually in the positions of the characters they play. So they&#39;re just themselves in funny costumes, and refer to themselves with the correct pronouns, and so forth.<br><br>That&#39;s also why I defined it as being the (or a) dress rehearsal. Partly so I wasn&#39;t claiming the actual play was this incredibly disrupted, and partly so that you could claim they decided to go for full disguises later.<br><br>I&#39;ll go with Metellus Cimber &amp; Flavius for Eledhwen, as per your and Dawn&#39;s suggestions. Did Christianne double up as anyone? Oh, lawks, I see she flirted with Lux in II:IV...<br><br>hS<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I liked it, and that should count for something at least, right?<br><br>Christianne doubled as Artemidorus, which gives her role in Act III a lot of editing to make sense.

            <p>Kozar looks like a TOS-era Klingon, ie, without forehead ridges. Which...would actually work well for this production, since we were thinking anyone who didn&#39;t look like a Time Lord would be disguised to look like one.<br><br>Jacques, however, very much does look like Jack Harkness, being as he&#39;s a former character replacement. While he tends to wear black military dress, he&#39;s...kind of in a dress and a wig for this role, I think. Or at least, that&#39;s how I drew him. Although it&#39;s also been stated that there was a disguise generator involved...maybe that was used for the hair?<br><br>...actually, for Kozar: here, have an advance viewing of the tektek I made for when I get his wiki page up. It&#39;s quite possibly his hair should be darker, but that&#39;s what I ended up with. Just kind of...take that, and think Klingon. <s>and put him in a toga or Gallifreyan robes</s>.<br><br><a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=2rc5v6o"><img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/2rc5v6o.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a><br><br>As for Eledhwen, I can confirm (after searching through the chat log) that we did not have her playing anyone. And I think she should be Metellus Cimber and doubled with Flavius, but I&#39;m going by &#39;cool name&#39; for the first one and &#39;speeches, yay!&#39; for the second, so...whatever you prefer.<br><br>Also: <i>Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look; such Klingons are dangerous.</i><br><br>~DF<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/CascaTrebonius.png"><br><br>I&#39;d pick a scene for Casca to go after Antony, but I have near-zero knowledge of the play, and can&#39;t find one easily. ;) So instead...<br><br>Act III, Scene II (an excerpt)<br><br>SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.<br>  ANTONY. You gentle Romans-<br>  ALL. Peace, ho! Let us hear her. <br>  ANTONY. Friends, Time Lords, Gallifreyans, lend me your ears!<br>    I come to bury Caesar, not to praise her.<br>    I mean, honestly, why would I ever do so?<br>  PINDARUS. Seriously? What&#39;s with the burying?<br>    I only regenerated; I&#39;m standing right here.<br>  SECOND CITIZEN. Weren&#39;t we going for &#39;peace&#39;?<br>  PINDARUS. Yes,<br>    But then people started throwing insults around.<br>  ANTONY. It&#39;s as I said: no praising here.<br>    The evil that men do lives after them,<br>    And continues ever to annoy their fellows;<br>    The good is oft interred with their bones;<br>    So let it be with Caesar. Particularly<br>    The part about internment.<br>  PINDARUS. Oh, come on!<br>  ANTONY. The noble Brutus<br>    Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;<br>    If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br>    And grievously hath Caesar answer&#39;d it.<br>    Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-<br>    For Brutus is an honorable man;<br>    So are they all, all honorable men-<br>  BRUTUS. How is it, then,<br>    That &#39;honour&#39; on her lips can sound so foul?<br>  CASSIUS. Remember of whom thou speakest?<br>    &#39;Honour&#39; takes a lesser place in her thoughts<br>    Than &#39;neatly filed&#39; or &#39;triplicate&#39;.<br>  ANTONY. Come I to speak in Caesar&#39;s funeral.<br>    She was my... acquaintance, faithful and just to me;<br>    Or at least in moderation was she so;<br>    But Brutus says she was ambitious,<br>    And Brutus is an honorable man.<br>    The lack of logic burns my very soul!<br>  CASSIUS. Now that, I can believe.<br>  ANTONY. He hath brought many captives to the Citadel,<br>    Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. <br>    Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br>    When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;<br>    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br>    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,<br>    And Brutus is an honorable man.<br>    And do I really need to keep going?<br>    The holes in his thesis are wide enough<br>    To drive a malfunctioning TARDIS through.<br>  BRUTUS. Then if thou art done-<br>  ANTONY. Oh, I think not.<br>    You all did see that on the Lupercal<br>    I thrice presented her a queenly crown,<br>    Which she did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?<br>    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,<br>    And sure he is an honorable man.<br>  CASSIUS. Now hang on just a moment, that&#39;s not fair.<br>    We all know to be king of Gallifrey<br>    Was never Caesar&#39;s plan. She would hold out<br>    For a far greater prize that one small world,<br>    E&#39;en though that world be, true, the best of all.<br>    Who would be Empress should disdain to rule<br>    As queen.<br>  ANTONY. &#39;Noble&#39; Cassius, enough!<br>    I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br>    But here I am to speak what I do know.<br>    You all did love her once, not without cause;<br>    What cause withholds you then to mourn for her?<br>  PINDARUS. The fact that I am seriously not dead,<br>  ANTONY. O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>    And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;<br>    My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br>    And I must pause till it come back to me.<br>  PINDARUS. Wait, you&#39;re putting me in a coffin?<br>    Can I go back and take that crown?<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The lesson being: if <i>Julius Caesar</i> took place on Gallifrey, it would be twice as long.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><b>Beware the Ides of March: PPC’s Shakespeare Troupe Celebrates March 15 with Gallifreyan Julius Caesar</b><br><br><em>Nita Incog, Editor-In-Chief and Stand-In Critic for Stan Grayson, Who Came Down With a Bad Case of Lungworm and Couldn’t Go to the Performance We Got Tickets For</em><br><br>4.5/5 stars<br> dir. John Naki<br> March 15 – May 30, Saturdays at 7PM<br><br>A Troupe By Any Other Name, the PPC’s own Shakespearean acting company—or in their own words, a “loose confederation of directors who wrangle various Agents into doing Shakespeare”—celebrated the Ides of March by opening a production of <em>Julius Caesar</em> set on Gallifrey. The tragedy follows the story of Marcus Brutus and how he is led to his own downfall when he joins the conspiracy to kill Julius Caesar, the dictator of Rome.<br><br>This Gallifreyan <em>Caesar </em>opens on the eve of the Time War, with a Caesar who greatly resembles Rassilon, the real-life leader of the Time Lords around the time of the Time War. However, the play diverts from the actual events of the Time War when Brutus and the conspirators, most notable amongst them Caius Cassius, assassinate Rassilon-Caesar in the Panopticon of the Gallifreyan Capitol. The events that unfold afterwards spark a different kind of Time War, after Mark Antony incites the citizens of Gallifrey to seek revenge against Brutus and Cassius for their fallen leader. After this, the play turns its focus from conspiracy to atonement, set against the chaos of this new Time Lord civil war.<br><br>The performances of Brutus and Cassius in the first half of the play seem cold and distant at times, if not slightly wooden, but this changes dramatically during the infamous ‘tent scene’ in Act IV scene iii, when the two of them have an argument. Here, Cassius’s acting in particular begins to shine and take on a very passionate (if not slightly personal) air. I personally felt transported along the same emotions that Cassius experiences in this moment, enjoying the catharsis that the scene affords them and Brutus. It could even be said that for these two actors, art imitates life.<br><br>The Gallifreyan setting will pleasantly surprise those who may fear that it will overwhelm the plot of the play, as it only serves in this production to highlight the political destruction wreaked on both Gallifrey and Rome by the actions of these characters. The only real distraction are the funny collars, which do briefly detract from some of the more emotionally powerful moments of the play. Audiences will also be delighted to see familiar Time Lord faces in the cast, as practically all of the Time Lord Agents in HQ are in this cast. Particularly amusing amongst them is the Fisherman’s (DF) brief poetic cameo just before the curtain call, with a couple other minor characters by his side.<br><br>The curtain call and costume reveal will also surprise and, in some cases, delight the audience. Particularly striking is the casting choice for Brutus, who is not a Time Lord and yet perfectly suited to the character’s honourable nature. Another interesting casting choice is for the minor character Titinius, whose actor did not even show up for curtain call. Who is Titinius? Who plays Titinius? Perhaps future performances will reveal them to us, but as of now they remain as mysterious and plothole-esque as their character.<br><br><em>Julius Caesar</em> will run until May 30<sup>th</sup>, and I highly recommend you wrangle some free time from your missions to catch it, even if it’s only to see the Time Lord Agents stabbing each other on the stage.<br><br>--<br><br><strong>Comments</strong><br><br><strong>Cale Serfe, DF – 15 March 2014</strong><br> While Brutus and Cassius are, of course, played very well, I couldn’t help but be, well, disappointed at the lack of kissing. I mean, would it have killed them to hold hands for a few minutes, at the very least? All they did was hug each other and cry! The tent scene should’ve merited a scorching kiss, at the very least. I’m sure everyone else is as disappointed as I am, and perhaps there’ll be a change to come in the next performance...<br><br><strong>Elysa Webber, DO – 15 March 2014</strong><br> You know, when Cassius first came onstage and started to speak—especially in that first scene with Brutus—I felt sure that the casting had been a complete failure. I mean, the ‘I pray you, do’ line alone—not to mention what follows—well, it came out completely wooden, and the rest of the scene wasn&#39;t much better. I got no sense that Cassius wanted to be around Brutus at all, let alone be his friend! Brutus himself was only slightly better: he called Cassius friend with more anger and resentment than anything else, and spent most of the scene looking frustrated or blank. Cassius, too, found some resentment and frustration, somewhere around the first ‘flourish and shout’, and even managed to dredge up some fury around ‘I was born as free as Caesar’. That, coupled with the occasional menacing looks at Rassilon Caesar, was the best thing I could see in Cassius’ acting for quite some time. And though Cassius’ hatred of Caesar is a strong and necessary part of the play, it can be argued that his love for Brutus must be stronger still; and I didn’t see much sign of the latter in the first scene!<br> But Cassius—played by the Time Lord called the Reader—proved herself later on. You’ve probably heard people ranting about how great the tent scene was; well, I’m about to join them, because that was the moment I truly felt the casting had been entirely accurate. Such emotion! Such anger, such desperation—and such reconciliation! I truly felt that I was watching something real—and, considering that Kozar (Brutus) and the Reader (Cassius) are rumored to have been having a tough time of things since the Reader replaced Kozar’s partner, I think it&#39;s entirely possible that it was real, and that we saw both a real fight and a real truce/reconciliation happening on stage today.<br> With luck, Kozar and the Reader will be more willing to get into character earlier on in the play, now that they&#39;ve shared so moving a hug. And even if they don’t—the tent scene alone makes watching the play worthwhile. (But don&#39;t even get me started on Calpurnia! And the completely uncanonical attempted stabbing of Mark Antony—well, let&#39;s just say Time Lord politics are pretty amusing!)<br> All in all—a wonderful production. See it as soon as you can!<br><br><strong>Maura Scott, DoSAT – 15 March 2014<br> </strong>Really dug the Fisherman and Evie both playing characters called Cinna. That was pretty funny.<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS – 16 March 2014</strong><br> STOP SPOILING ALL THE PARTS.

Mostly because they were snogging at the time. Bonnefoy was definitely hilarious as Calpurnia, though.<br><br><strong>Nerys Carpenter, DO – 16 March 2014</strong><br> That was hilarious! I really liked the Portia/Calpurnia scene at the end, though. It basically starts with Cal coming onstage going all “I told him, ‘Julie, don’t go’!” and then she bumps into Portia, who giggles and smiles and holds out a hand, and Cal considers it for all of two seconds before shrugging, tearing off her giant mourning collar, and snogging Portia. And then about half a minute in someone realized they weren’t about to stop anytime soon and just removed the disguises. Seriously, even though it turned out to be just Bonnefoy and Lux being their usual selves, I think I might ship Portia/Calpurnia now.<br><br><strong>Luxury, DBS – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Thank you! xoxo I liked the CalPortia scene too!! ;)<br><br><strong>Jacques Bonnefoy, ESAS – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Wanna meet up and continue it? ;))))<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Get a room, you two.<br><br><strong>Jacques Bonnefoy, ESAS – 16 March 2014<br> </strong>Thanks, we will!!! ;)))<br><br><strong>Luxury, DBS – 16 March 2014<br> </strong>Sounds like a plan!!!!! ;))))<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS – 16 March 2014<br> </strong>-facepalms-<br><br><strong>The Agent, DIC – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Don’t we all agree that Morgan was perfect as Rassilon-Caesar?<br><br><strong>Geoffrey Carver, DOI – 16 March 2014<br> </strong>Agreed! She was wonderful as Pinterest and Stratosphere, too. You were also really good as Trombone!<br><br><strong>The Disentangler, DIC – 16 March 2014<br> </strong>I think you meant Pindarus, Strato, and Trebonius. Thanks anyway.<br><br><strong>The Disentangler, DIC – 16 March 2014</strong><br> Get off my account, Agent.<br><br><strong>Fearn, DTO – 16 March 2014<br> </strong>YOU TIME LORDS ARE SO DYSFUNCTIONAL THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO STAB EACH OTHER. RASSILON-CAESAR REGENERATING INTO PINDARUS AND STRATO AMUSED ME GREATLY. CLEARLY THIS PRODUCTION IS PROOF OF THE SUPERIORITY OF THE DALEKS.<br><br><strong>Kate Lynn, DoDAEG – 16 March 2014<br> </strong>That was a wonderful adaptation of <em>Julius Caesar</em>. It was my favourite play in high school and to see it done by my fellow Agents was a real treat. Though, I do notice that the Time Lord actors really can’t seem to find a separation between their onstage and offstage drama, since Casca (the Disentangler) tried to stab Mark Antony (the Notary) halfway through Act III and had to be dragged off by Trebonius (the Agent).<br><br><strong>John Naki, DoDAEG – 16 March 2014<br> </strong>I told them at every single rehearsal that they needed to stop bickering all the time, but noooooo...<br><br><strong>Officer Rooney, DOI – 17 March 2014<br> </strong>Hey, Naki, could you tell us who played Titinius? I’ve got a bet with Jeeves that they’re actually a Gary Stu, given the way they got Cassius to die for them.<br><br><strong>T’Lyra, DAVD – 17 March 2014<br> </strong>Only Cassius was affected by his Aura, not anyone else. Titinius cannot be a Stu.<br><br><strong>Brenda Loringham, DMS – 17 March 2014<br> </strong>You’re right about Titinius, Rooney, everything he does in the play just screams of Stu! He randomly appears out of nowhere in act IV, says basically nothing until his death scene in act V, and yet apparently he’s Cassius’s best friend who loves him—a title that I could’ve sworn was Brutus’s—and somehow important enough for Cassius to commit suicide over him. If he came up on my console, I would charge and kill him so hard.<br><br><strong>T’Lyra, DAVD – 17 March 2014</strong><br> This lack of lines is precisely why he cannot be a Stu. A Stu would take over the entire play. Titinius is simply a plothole in the background.<br><br><strong>T’Zar, DOGA – 17 March 2014</strong><br> Indeed. While he does possess various Stu-like characteristics, he is simply not sufficiently prevalent to be a true Gary Stu.<br><br><strong>Dawn McKenna, DMS – 17 March 2014</strong><br> Like Agent Kate Lynn, <em>Julius Caesar</em> was one of my favourite plays as a kid. I was especially delighted by the choice of the Fisherman as Cinna the Poet—he took to it with such enthusiasm, and even led an army of poets onstage just before the curtain call! Cinna the Conspirator (Evie)’s participation in that particular scene was pretty hilarious.<br> I could go on and on about all of this—Jacques as Calpurnia, the Notary’s butchering of Mark Antony (just kidding, that definitely had its moments), Brutus and Cassius (believe me, I had no idea my ex-partner could act so well!)—but I want to express my ... well, confusion, really, about a certain character: Titinius. He had almost no lines, came out of nowhere, and became Cassius’ best friend! It made very little sense, honestly. And not only that—the actor who played him never turned up for the casting reveal! What exactly is going on with that?<br> Who is Titinius? Where did he come from? And who played him?<br><br><strong>Gurnirel, SIELU – 18 March 2014</strong><br> I enjoyed the performance; however, I cannot help but wonder how different our own history might have been shaped had there only been put into action a plot to stab Morgoth while we yet resided in Valinor. Fëanáro could perhaps have been a worthy Cassius.<br><br><strong>Naergondir, SIELU – 18 March 2014<br> </strong>And yet, sister, I believe that Morgoth—then Melkor—would have been more suited, indeed, for the role of Cassius. For did he not turn Fëanáro’s mind to jealousy concerning the Silmarilli, and thus ensure the downfall of the Two Trees and of the Ñoldor? Melkor&#39;s tongue could sway one such as a Fëanáro: hot of temper, sharp of mind, and never-straying once plighted to his course.<br><br><strong>Gurnirel, SIELU – 18 March 2014<br> </strong>It may well be, brother, but who then would be Caesar? Perhaps Finwë?<br><br><strong>Naergondir, SIELU – 18 March 2014<br> </strong>Perhaps. Although I would indeed name Nolofinwë in his father&#39;s stead; for Fëanáro loved him not. And still more, dear sister: <em>Julius Caesar</em> deals not with the turning of a son against a father, and thus Finwë Caesar I would not cast. <em>Hamlet</em>, perhaps, could see such casting...<br><br><strong>Eledhwen Elerossiel, DMS – 18 March 2014<br> </strong>If the two of you wish to see a production of <em>Julius Caesar</em> set in Arda, please discuss this with the members of A Troupe By Any Other Name in RC 1564 and/or Cubicle 221B Bakery Avenue. <br><br>--<br><br>Notes: Thank you to DawnFire for helping me with this! Apologies to basically everyone who’s created a Time Lord Agent for wrangling them into the production without permission, but if you’re not okay with it, we can just consider it a reporting error (they had another disguise under their disguise. or something).<br><br>Also posted <a href="http://lilywinterwood.tumblr.com/post/90578142992/ppc-multiverse-monitor-beware-the-ides-of-march">here</a>.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t even specifically remember what led me to finding this (the mini project, obviously, but I can&#39;t recall how I even learned of this <i>other</i> OFU with mini-dragons to begin with, but whatever).  Anyway, I discovered the existence of the very specific OFU for specifically only the seventh <i>Fire Emblem</i> game, aka the first member of the series released outside of Asia.  Unfortunately, the original story got admin-hammered off the Pit, but fortunately, the author, Vyctori had posted drafts of some chapters in a discussion board, which is still around.  Since there were so many guest appearances between OFURNK and Echo Kazul&#39;s PPC stories, I decided to compile all the surviving fragments into a single page.<br><br><a href="http://ppcofuarchive.dreamwidth.org/318.html"><a href="http://ppcofuarchive.dreamwidth.org/318.html">http://ppcofuarchive.dreamwidth.org/318.html</a></a><br><br>As you can see, I&#39;ve made a Dreamwidth account dedicated specifically to this old stuff I find.  Some of you on the Wiki and Chat may have noticed I&#39;ve been trying to dig through old stuff lately and save copies of some of the PPC stuff on less-than-stable-looking sites (and later decided to do OFUs as well, as my mini project taught me that they&#39;re sometimes critical for mini info).<br><br>My current plan is to compile a giant backup file of the entire PPC/OFU canon and share it around the community.  As stuff disappears from their original homes on the web, I&#39;ll upload them here, so we still have links available.  <s>But it&#39;s totally not a ripoff of Nesh&#39;s Lost Tales, I swear I&#39;m not muscling in on your territory or anything!</s><br><br>The other thing I have to share today is a spin-off, of sorts, from OFURNK: the OMDURNK, or &quot;Official Mini-Dragon University of Rekka no Ken,&quot; created when a student misspelled her own school&#39;s name and created a whole &#39;nother one.  This one has only one chapter surviving, but I guess that&#39;s better than nothing?<br><br><a href="http://ppcofuarchive.dreamwidth.org/722.html"><a href="http://ppcofuarchive.dreamwidth.org/722.html">http://ppcofuarchive.dreamwidth.org/722.html</a></a><br><br>I know <i>Fire Emblem</i> isn&#39;t a big fandom roundabouts, but I would appreciate some feedback just on the legibility and organization of the site itself so I know if the presentation needs any work.<br><br><s>Man, seriously, why did it have to be <i>another</i> mini-dragon?

            <p>Have you noticed all the link-fixing Rotlink is doing on the wiki lately? I can&#39;t keep up with all of that, and these things are time-sensitive! When it comes to backups, redundancy is a <i>good</i> thing. {= D Though, if you wanted to maybe focus more on non-missiony things <s>which I might have a hard time fitting into The Lost Tales</s>, I&#39;ve got some files I can copy you...?<br><br>I haven&#39;t read the OFU things yet, because I&#39;m coincidentally neck-deep in some Lost Tales work, the exact nature of which I&#39;m keeping secret for now because I&#39;m hoping to blow a few minds. As for the site itself, it&#39;s hard to comment, since it&#39;s a journal. It&#39;s legible enough, though a bit drab. Maybe some color in the links would help? I&#39;m pretty sure you can customize stuff like that with Dreamwidth. I worry that you might find yourself somewhat restricted with how you can organize things and provide navigation, but tags should prove useful. (Note to self, improve TLT&#39;s navigation.) One thing, though: Use cuts. It can get really hard to navigate a journal-thing if every long post appears at its full length in the queue. Plus, if anyone decides to follow the journal, they won&#39;t want to have huge posts taking up their entire reading page.<br><br>BTW, PPC Historians Club? You, me, hS, Calista if she&#39;s around, anyone else who feels like helping? We can have leather chairs and fancy jackets and sit around sipping tea while looking at old stuff and periodically going &quot;Fascinating!&quot; *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>And yes, yes, yes, please, if there&#39;s anything you don&#39;t want to host on your site, feel free to send it on over!  OFURNK (man, I love pronouncing that) is actually the first non-PPC thing I&#39;ve saved, so there&#39;s lots of room for more.  I can&#39;t wait to see what you&#39;re working on, either!<br><br>Hooray for Rotlink!  (What an ironic name, being that they&#39;re saving stories from death.)  I&#39;m especially glad they found Keily&#39;s stuff; I felt bad about not saving that.  I wish I had more free time (said the guy who can pay all his bills) so I could keep with Rot.  Good work, if you&#39;re reading this, Rot!<br><br>As for the site, well.  I&#39;m never going to be able to have a true and proper site the way you do.  I just don&#39;t have the technical skills to actually, legitimately code entire pages that way, so I&#39;m stuck using things like Dreamwidth or the wiki.  I could play with the color a bit, though I spent some time already picking out this theme.  I just want it to be readable.  (I&#39;m beginning to hate the bluish-white words on blue background of my main site, and will probably change that soon, too.)  And I&#39;ll fix the problem of navigation soon enough--oh, hey, noisy dust storm outside--by making one of those &quot;dated fifty years in the future&quot; posts with a master list of everything I&#39;ve got there.  That way, no one will really need to navigate around, and I don&#39;t have to learn how to make journal cuts.

            <p>I&#39;m thinking it acts like a pesticide, something that can repel or kill weak Suvians.

            <p>Basically, how rabid do we get with following the canon when charging?  <br><br>I know that a certain amount of OOC doesn&#39;t even register because only the original creator can &quot;get it right&quot; even if they go through wild shifts in the canon work.

            <p>If the characters behave like actual people, with deep and rational characterization in a well-described and well-thought-out scenario, I don&#39;t think it matters if they&#39;re somewhat OOC- generally, I see that charge used when a character is specifically warped to make them do something stupid, nonsensical, gratuitously evil/good (depending), or shallow, not necessarily just that they behave slightly differently from their canonical appearance. Serious OOCness is I think always chargeable not necessarily because it exists on its own, but because it is nearly impossible to make a character such without poor or inadequately-explained writing.<br><br>Similarly, if the rest of the fic is bad, I don;t think it matters how OOC the characters are. Heck, judging by &quot;From Another World&quot; and its clones, directly re-enacting canon with nothing new to add should be a charge in and of itself!</p>

            <p>At the least, if &quot;completely recreating canon then just slapping your Sue in there&quot; isn&#39;t an official charge (and I think you could argue plagiarism to fit it in) it&#39;s certainly something agents have stuck to a badfic anyway.

            <p>I was told in the beginning that you have to more charges than just OOC to justify a mission. Although, if they are OOC enough, there is probably something else wrong with the story. <br><br>On the slash issue, most characters are assumed straight, because they are seen with people of the opposite sex, or because they are not see with people of the same sex, but very few out and out state that they are emphatically not interested in the same sex, so I see a lot of interpretive room. <br><br>For ones who have actually explicitly stated their sexual orientation, then a fic not addressing that would be chargeable, I believe. <br><br>Creator statements of things completely lacking in evidence in the canon, I&#39;m a little softer on. Yes, that is what they intended, but if they felt so strongly about it, why did they not find 10 words or 10 seconds to state it? Especially in a series of books, they&#39;ve got hundreds of thousands, if not millions of words of opportunity to get their intentions into canon.<br><br>As a writer you&#39;ve got two problems with sending your work out. No matter what you meant, people only see what you actually wrote, and secondly, they bring their own set of experiences to their interpretation of what you actually wrote, so, yeah, I really count author statements as a lot less than what the canon said. <br><br>I will take it as an influence, but if that is the only source negating something in a fic, I would not charge for it.<br><br>Just a note of advice, if the primary charge is utter and complete stupidity of plot and characterization with other wise good spelling and grammar, it is really hard to write a mission on it. Not sure why, you&#39;d think pure stupid (and OOC) would make for good sporking, but I&#39;ve tried it twice and it&#39;s not easy.</p>

            <p>&quot;directly re-enacting canon with nothing new to add should be a charge in and of itself&quot;  By the Web you have no idea how many of those are on my personal badfic list.  One was SPaG-aside decent since I hadn&#39;t played the game, and then became horrible once I watched a playthrough, and then became worse when I looked up a song.<br><br>I&#39;ve discovered that I can&#39;t read more than one fan-insert of The Last Airbender at a time and keep them straight.  Maybe I should write a non-PPC recursive fanfiction crossover where they all meet, or turn it over to the PPC because I can&#39;t manage it with the proper dignity.<br><br>As far as the &quot;they aren&#39;t gay&quot; statement... just run away screaming in this instance, it&#39;s confusing.  Basically it&#39;s a stamp one of my sorters uses when she can&#39;t see anything else that violates canon.  Dubious lube aside, most of the slash doesn&#39;t need killing.<br><br>That does raise a question about sticking with a sunken ship.  <br><br>I&#39;m still willing to wrestle with decent-grammar fics, even if I fail.</p>

            <p>Okay, I know that I&#39;m severely new here, but one of my main goals is to go about and improve the fandom that follows the escapades of Sonic the Hedgehog because that is the fandom that got me seriously writing. My cousin, who works on DA and Fanfiction writes Scourge the Hedgehog tales and has volunteered to be my first victim if I ever become experienced enough to try out the following idea:<br><br>Frankly, I want to create The Official Mobius School of Fanbrat Improvement. It is indeed a strangely long title, but I thought it fit. I noticed that the PPC seems to think that we of the Sonic fandom are completely and utterly broken and I really want to fix that impression.<br><br>What I am doing here is requesting feedback on exactly how broken everyone thinks it is and what I could possibly address. Also, I was wondering exactly how old I have to be in PPC terms to write it.<br><br>(If the introduction of this new topic deletes someone&#39;s important topic, I humbly apologize. I am just so fired up with ideas at the moment.)</p>

            <p>Therefore, nobody needs permission from us to write one, and we&#39;re in no position to tell you what age you have to be, either. Back in Ye Olden Dayes, one had to ask for Miss Cam&#39;s blessing, but even that is no longer the case—simply credit her for the original idea and do your best to live up to the legacy, and you&#39;ll be fine. {= )<br><br>I do recommend coming up with a complete outline before you start, though. LOTS of OFUs never get finished, whether because the authors run out of ideas or they simply get distracted by other things, and it&#39;s really, really sad. If you&#39;re committed enough to plan ahead, you may stand a better chance of not joining the legion of the incomplete.<br><br>I don&#39;t know enough about the current fandom to give any specific advice, but a couple of my friends were really into <i>Sonic</i> back in the day, and I role-played with them despite knowing practically nothing besides what they told me, so I do have some ancient, <i>ancient</i> fan characters, complete with god-awful art from back when I was twelve or something. I could certainly sign one or two of them up whenever you&#39;re ready to accept students.<br><br>Good luck! {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Interesting idea. Personally, I have little experience with the Sonic fandom and its alleged brokenness. I suggest that you read lots of existing Official Fanfiction Universities for inspiration beforehand, particularly OFUM, IAHF (International Academy of Hetalia Fanfiction), and HFA (Hogwarts Fanfiction Academy). (Those are the three complete ones I can think of off the top of my head.)<br><br>Since you don&#39;t have <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> yet, I would say that&#39;s a prerequisite. (Heh-heh.) OFUs in general address canon languages, names (and why you should spell them correctly), personalities, shipping, and general rules.  There&#39;s also usually a GrammarBootCamp, which is just what it sounds like. &gt;:)</p>

            <p>Actually, I just read the Redwall OFU, the Hogwarts OFU, Jay and Acacia&#39;s adventures in the Fanfiction University of Middle-Earth, and the Pokemon University. Believe me, I&#39;ve prepared for this with those and I&#39;ve already begun developing my ideas. Helping authors who don&#39;t understand what exactly they&#39;re doing was my original inspiration for coming here.<br><br>Permission. Yes. As I&#39;m not sure who is a Permission Giver here, I haven&#39;t asked them about it yet. If you would be so kind as to point me in the direction of the right person, I will certainly write up a resume. As I am a quick reader, and have been dedicating the past few weeks on reading anything about you guys I can get my hands on, it still may not be a good enough resume.<br><br>I&#39;ve written down lessons, misspellings I&#39;ve glimpsed, plot points, and weird ships. I&#39;ve also looked for the minis in this universe, which are Mini-Chaoses. I wouldn&#39;t go about changing that, but I have ideas on their attacks, what they eat in addition to the required Mini diet of bacon and raw eggs, and where their loyalties lie. I have a fairly good understanding of grammar and I know quite a bit about the personalities, likes, and dislikes of the canon characters. <br><br>If this still isn&#39;t enough, I am definitely going to find more OFU stories to read and mull over. Thank you for your feedback and advice. </p>

            <p>(For those of you unfamiliar with Sonichu the &quot;webcomic&quot; or its creator and legions of adoring trolls, just Google it. I&#39;m not linking any of that here.

Being a devout member of the Halo fandom, I am occasionally accosted by people whose only knowledge of the game is that one Stufic and can&#39;t tell their Sangheili from their San&#39;shyuum, so while my initial reaction to Sonic is to ignore it and imagine some ungodly morass, I will freely admit that I am in no position to make that judgement.<br><br>I&#39;d say go for it- I like to think that I&#39;ve done a markedly good thing all on my lonesome by directing some of the hatred for J.C.&#39;s AVATAR to better targets, and I don&#39;t see why you can&#39;t help bring the Sonic community the recognition it deserves.<br><br><br>I realize this is more motivational speech than analysis, but I really do think it needed to be said...<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been here on the Posting Board for two or three weeks, I believe. However, I&#39;ve been following the adventures of the PPC for two years because I enjoy everyone&#39;s snark and writing styles.<br><br>As for help, I just need an overview of exactly how broken the fandom seems to an outsider or a PPC agent, in addition to what I could focus on improving. The video games are what I need the most help on because I know their respective story lines, but not the various moves and weaknesses of the video game characters. I&#39;m an Archie Comics girl all the way, but I know Sonic X, SATAM, and a little Sonic Underground. The video games I can mostly ask my companions about. <br><br>So, yeah, what I truly need is ideas upon what I should focus on teaching the fans and input on exactly how shattered the fandom is. I have ideas for lessons and I&#39;ve researched OFUs for the past few weeks, so other than that, I should be good.</p>

            <p>I remember Cupcakes and Pattycakes. I have Pattycakes on the Claimed Badfic list, as a matter of fact. Truly disturbing, in an admittedly entertaining way.<br><br>That&#39;s a good question. Maybe they target the MLP franchise because that&#39;s where nobody will expect to see it, because of its refreshing cutsie, innocent-ish nature. It&#39;s like hiding a bomb. Malicious intent meant for the enjoyment of the planter, and those others out there sick enough to enjoy them, such as myself.<br><br>I suppose they are worth commending, in my own opinion. I did some research into the Cupcakes Pinkie Pie, and discovered parallels to the notorious BTK Killer, Dennis Radar, and Ted Bundy. That in and of itself means that the author did some research, some very serious research. I like fan fiction, and regular fiction, for that matter, that has a basis in reality, like Cupcakes did. Now, I&#39;ll admit, the torture was nothing more than improbable blood porn, but my point still stands.</p>

            <p>Good Space Gods, that is pointless. It has nothing to add to the historical debate, or for that matter to the My Little Pony universe. The plot <i>barely</i> qualifies as such in the sense that things happen which are related to one another. It&#39;s not even really <i>about</i> My Little Pony in any serious sense: it could fit just as well (and by well I mean very, very badly) in any other universe. It has only one reason for existing- to offend as many people as possible... and it shows.<br><br>This is why I hate MLP shockfics. Not because they&#39;re offensive or poorly-written or often more than a little sick, although they are all three of those things, but because they are a <b>complete and utter <u>waste of space</u>.</b><br><br>(You may quote me on that.)</p>

            <p>Huh, with the last survivor dead, it&#39;s too soon to glorify Hitler in the same manner as Vlad Dracul, but to have fics portraying the might-have-beens while emotions are still high?

            <p>I think it&#39;s got to do with the way guys kind of bash each other for not being tough enough. Like, if a guy dances ballet or bakes cookies, other guys (well, not all other guys, but the nasty sort) will pick on him for it because he&#39;s not manly enough or something.<br><br>Well, isn&#39;t this a lot of the same thing? Guys who like ponies are &quot;betraying&quot; the &quot;man club&quot;, so other guys feel like punishing them by writing about the cute ponies getting tortured or raped or whatever. Or maybe they feel threatened by the fact that some guys like cute ponies, and feel like they have to write something like that just to &quot;set things right&quot; and prove they&#39;re Real Men in all the wrong ways.</p>

            <p>I know people always talk about females being oppressed by gender stereotypes, and that&#39;s true; women get this pressure to be gentle and nurturing and get married and get pregnant and not try to bash through the glass ceiling.<br><br>But guys get some of the same stuff. They&#39;re supposed to be independent and strong and stoic and stuff, and they&#39;re not supposed to like pink or frills or cute things.<br><br>Along comes a well-made children&#39;s show, and a few guys decide they like it. For them, it&#39;s an opportunity. Instead of having to toe the line and stick with the masculine stereotype, they can come out and say they like the cuteness and the warmth in this kid&#39;s show about ponies and friendship. And more and more of them start to get together and say, &quot;Yeah. I can like what I like. I don&#39;t have to obey the man rules. In fact, I&#39;m even more badass when I don&#39;t obey them.&quot;<br><br>So not only is it a good show on its own merits, but it also lets these guys express themselves in a way that&#39;s becoming more socially acceptable as more guys get into it.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Darkotas, and I was referred to the PPC by my very good friend Iximaz. I&#39;m not used to introducing myself to a community like this (at least, not in this manner - I tend to be somewhat shy at times), but nothing ever gets done if you don&#39;t try in the first place, right? Anyway, I&#39;ve read the PPC Constitution and the FAQ (it&#39;s hard to think of a good intro post!), and I&#39;m 90% through with the Original Series. The continuities I am most familiar with include Star Wars, Warcraft, and most classic literature, but I&#39;m open to any suggestions for a good series. Chances are I&#39;ll know something about it, at least; if I don&#39;t, I&#39;ll learn about it!<br><br>Thanks for having me, and I look forward to becoming a part of this vast and interesting community!</p>

            <p>I have to start this post with an apology, for I am a huge flake. Perhaps the biggest flake. See, the things I&#39;m about to link, they&#39;ve been sitting on my hard drive for years. Since I first put out the call for The Lost Tales, actually. I just... never went through the giant mess of files I got very thoroughly until a couple weeks ago, when it occurred to me that if I was going to try to save everything, I&#39;d better start by knowing exactly what I already had.<br><br>So, yeah. I&#39;m an idiot, and I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m really hoping the coolness of having this stuff back will outweigh the inanity of me not knowing I had it for so long. &gt;.<br>On to the actual content!<br><br><b>First, some missing pages of the PPC Handbook:</b><br><br>- Artemis&#39; <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/handbook/departments.html">PPC Departments and Agents</a> list. This is fascinating (at least to me) in part because of the mail-to links in the original document, which can help us identify which characters belonged to who, especially when cross-referenced with the old <a href="http://archive.today/HV5G2">PPC Directory</a> (which is not part of the Handbook). I HAVE removed the full e-mail addresses, because I don&#39;t want the page to be fodder for spambots, but if you mouse over agent names in gray, you&#39;ll be able to see the e-mail prefix, which is all we really need for comparison.<br><br>I also must note that the appearance of the page is purely a guess, since whoever saved it only saved the text, not the full code. I have no idea what it originally looked like, but since it was hosted on the br<em>department site, same as the Flower Officials page, I&#39;ve given it the same background and colors. It&#39;s... a little hard to read, I know, but I don&#39;t know what else to do.<br><br>- &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/buffyverse/buffyverse">http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/buffyverse/buffyverse</a></em>chargelist.htm&quot;&gt;The Jossverse official PPC charge list</a> and <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/SueTest_LOTR.html">Winterfox&#39;s LotR Sue Litmus Test</a>. These were actually archived by hS as part of the Oddlots site, but there are links to them in the Handbook that were formerly broken, and now they&#39;re not. Yay! (BTW, please let me know if you find broken links, especially if you know how I can fix them!)<br><br>- The original <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/handbook/oldmenu.html">Glossary of Edible and Semi-Edible Substances</a> by Claudia Beth King. This doesn&#39;t replace the link to the new menu, since that was updated when the Handbook was still actively maintained; I&#39;ve just added it as a bit of a bonus for the inquiring minds out there.<br><br>- The original <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/handbook/origins.html">&quot;Origins&quot;</a> and accompanying <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/handbook/origins_ut.html">Unfinished Tales</a> by Huinesoron. ... Eyup. Not much to say here, because I&#39;m not 100% sure hS wouldn&#39;t prefer that these stayed lost. They were part of the Handbook, though, so here they are! Erm, please don&#39;t kill me? ^_^;<br><br><b>Next, some content from the BRD site!</b><br><br>- <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/halleytalia/">The main page</a>, including an intro with the Daffodil. We have some dialogue from a minor Flower! Yay! ... Sheesh, he&#39;s a squirrely little chap, isn&#39;t he?<br><br>- <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/halleytalia/story01.html">&quot;Arathorn Did Not Have a Daughter&quot;</a> by Artemis and Bodldops. This actually wasn&#39;t lost, since it survived on ff.net, but with the intro we now know that the [BEEP!] at the end of this DMS mission is most likely the agents&#39; summons to go get their transfer orders. Neat! (And now you can read it lightly edited, with all those dialogue punctuation and capitalization issues fixed!)<br><br>- <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/halleytalia/story02.html">&quot;The Misadventures of Talia&quot;</a> by Artemis. This WAS lost, and it&#39;s pretty cool because it also involves an original appearance of Agents Black and Irvine of the DIA. Not to mention the story itself being pretty original and fun to read. Go do it!<br><br>Sadly, I am not in possession of any actual missions to bad role-plays. It&#39;s possible there never were any, but I can&#39;t confirm anything. One way or another, that&#39;s all I got.<br><br>---<br><br>There are a lot more good things to come at The Lost Tales. For instance, I&#39;ve also discovered one of Kippur&#39;s lost Marrissa Picard missions, and I have a few missing pages from the DMFF site, too--apparently they wrote handy glossaries of the flora and fauna of Middle-earth and a little lexicon of terms derived from &quot;Sue.&quot;<br><br>However, more sites keep going down, and it&#39;s a lot of work to restore them in their best possible shape. <b>If you&#39;re interested in helping</b>, especially if you&#39;re familiar with HTML, please let me know! CSS is also helpful, since I want to convert the whole site eventually. Again, though, that&#39;s a lot of work, and I&#39;m currently playing catch-up to the last round of deletions--Anamia&#39;s Corner, the Department of Cool and Unusual Punishment, Keily&#39;s &quot;Duty of a Fangirl,&quot; Pieguy&#39;s House of Sporking...<br><br>Which, I can&#39;t help but notice, were all Webs sites. Ahem: <b>If your PPC stuff is hosted by Webs, please back it up!</b> For they are jerks and will wantonly delete it for arbitrary reasons, and there&#39;s nothing I can do about it except hope the Wayback Machine or archive.today took thorough snapshots first. {= (<br><br>... That&#39;s all for now. Enjoy the new-old stuff, and please forgive me for its unduly long absence from our lives.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Good find with that list!  I was super-excited when I found that Directory, but it&#39;s super-hard to read, and a lot is ambiguous.  It&#39;s good to have a potential double-check now.<br><br>I&#39;m glad to see I didn&#39;t actually imagine Origins and the Unfinished Tales, after all!  I think I read them around when I first joined, but could never find them again.  I was beginning to think they were a hallucination!<br><br>I was super-happy reading through &quot;The Misadventures of Talia&quot; and seeing some of the details I had picked out of her journal being confirmed in an actual published text.  And OMG, it&#39;s when she first met Dúros!  It&#39;s great to have such a major event in two agents&#39; lives recorded again!  (That Sue is rather intriguing, too.  I guess the &quot;class&quot; she took in Mordor *snerk* was taught by a ringwraith.)  It is disappointing to learn no BRD missions were ever written, as I&#39;ve always been curious as to how they would go.  But I guess I shouldn&#39;t miss something that never existed, so . . .<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to see some of the other stuff you&#39;ve got waiting!  Speaking of which, I responded to your email, but never heard back from you.  Did something get &quot;lost in the mail&quot;?  </p>

            <p>There you go; you&#39;ve achieved your goal. My brain is officially blown.<br><br>Now, time to go through and see what we&#39;ve got...<br><br>-Arti&#39;s list. The Big Two trivia from this, for me, are: a) Bast&#39;s Agent Mary Sue is in both the DRD and RDR, so I can steal her if Rosalind or Aella need a friend. b) Agent Suzine is in DAVD. Is this the same person as <i>Nurse</i> Suzine?<br><br>-No comments on the charge list/Litmus Test, since they were sort of never lost (even though I&#39;m proooobably the only person who could have found it)<br><br>-The substances list: it always baffles me that bleeprin is canonically made by mini-Aragogs in HFA. It occurs to me that the Ispace Wars might have interrupted the supply somewhat...<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Bleep.png"><br><br>I also wonder where we get our Pink and Purple Stuff since the Great Goddess left... and also whether this means her temple was technically a front for a drug-distribution ring. :D<br><br>-Origins and UT: no, you can keep them up. &#39;Origins&#39; is actually still hosted as a summary version on the Webplex, and... well, the conceit behind the UT and this version of Origins is that Dafydd wrote them. Slight divergences from the later facts are to be expected. ;)<br><br>-The BRD: you fiend. ^-^ Well done. As far as I recall, there never were any actual Bad Roleplay missions.<br><br>Of course, the existence of <i>these</i> missions means two of our latest Featured Agents are no longer up to date... and one of my goals is to ensure that they all remain so. I guess that means I&#39;m going to be going through these with a fine-toothed comb. Oh no, I have to read PPC missions, how will I ever cope.<br><br>There&#39;s a story I remember from... somewhere, which has an agent getting thrown into what she thinks is a badfic, but is actually a goodfic (possibly by Thalia Weaver), and she&#39;s only barely stopped from killing it. In my head, that was &#39;The Misadventures of Talia&#39;, but since it isn&#39;t... any idea what I&#39;m thinking of? Or if we still have it?<br><br>Anyway... awesome, and well done!<br><br>~~~~~<br><br>Webs: sometimes, yes, they delete things arbitrarily. According to their tech support (who always fire off the same boilerplate email in reply to your first attempt to contact them), their shutdowns of me were at the request of some outside authority - I forget what, and they were never very clear.<br><br>They also shut down websites which haven&#39;t been logged into for a certain amount of time and which haven&#39;t been viewed in a shorter amount... but it&#39;s all a bit random. Fortunately, archive.today seems to be fairly comprehensive, which is why the Multiverse Monitor is entirely preserved (except for one Page 3 image, but I might actually have that somewhere...), and <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/MM/index.htm">almost restored</a>. Starwind&#39;s high-rated PPC fanfics are probably lost forever, though.<br><br>(Which reminds me that I need to think about making a thread on that subject... Are NC-17 PPC Stories Okay And Should They Be Posted?)<br><br>Once again: thank you and well done!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The bottom part of this post in Godforsaken&#39;s LJ mentions a Boarder named Suzine:<br><br>(Upper part contains NSFW language)<br><a href="http://agentclaudia.livejournal.com/20535.html"><a href="http://agentclaudia.livejournal.com/20535.html">http://agentclaudia.livejournal.com/20535.html</a></a><br><br>That Boarder may be the author of Agent Suzine.  Then again, the two characters could still be the same Suzine, as the Wiki doesn&#39;t name an author, and Nurse Suzine&#39;s earliest appearance in the JAAKSONS spin-off is fairly small, and could just be a cameo of Boarder Suzine&#39;s character?  So maybe she used to be in DAVD Medical, and later transferred to FicPsych?<br><br>Really no way of knowing, now.  :s<br><br>And as to the Thalia vs. Talia thing . . . um.

(We are talking about Weaver, right?)  And it says the name is &quot;Talia (sometimes Thalia).&quot;  So it seems the Boarder Thalia sometimes went by the same name as one of Artemis&#39; PPC agents.  (And I think Thalia is also the author of the Agent Thalia on the Glossary page?  The Glossary lists the author as &quot;NeedleofDeath,&quot; but Needle&#39;s author page on the Pit has separate author notes from &quot;Thalia&quot; and &quot;Shada&quot; soooooo I don&#39;t know I think I&#39;m overthinking this anyway.)<br><br>-doctorlit, who is getting uncomfortable looking at peoples&#39; RL LJs looking for PPC info.</p>

            <p>I remember Suzine (vaguely) and I&#39;m well aware of Thalia&#39;s real name. ;) Also, I can <b>confirm</b> that Thalia of Thalia-and-Shada is Thalia Weaver. Their profile links to <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/177201">Thalia&#39;s</a>. Shada links to <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/103129">Shada</a>, which links to a livejournal for <a href="http://joraina.livejournal.com/profile">Joraina</a>, which mentions the name antinomies. She doesn&#39;t seem to have friended any of the PPC Boarders I know of, and I don&#39;t recognise any of her names, so if she was on the Board at all, she left way early. The <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/BoardArchive.htm">Board Archive</a> is admittedly spotty for 2003, but she&#39;s not in it under any of those.<br><br>Coming back to Suzine - actually, and Thalia, since Artemis&#39; list mentions an Agent Thalia (Weaver) in both DAVD and the DCPS, in addition to Shada&#39;s partner in the DMS - the problem for we poor archivists is that in the early days, people inserted <i>Boarders</i>, not agents, into their stories. That&#39;s why Agent Huinesoron of DOGA exists - I was a cameo in Suedom. So you <i>will</i> find a lot of repeating names, particularly where the DCPS is concerned - and, apparently, DAVD.<br><br>The question then becomes: do we, as archivists and historians, treat them as all being the same people? The DCPS is canonically established, in the person of Chelsea Miller, to take agents who already have another job, so I think those should be &#39;the same person&#39;. But Suzine being both Head Nurse and DAVD? Mm. I think your idea of a transfer might be best - or, again, Medical and FicPsych have historically taken a lot of two-job agents, such as Constance Sims. So maybe Suzine moonlighted from DAVD Medical to FicPsych, and later made the shift permanent?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I would&#39;ve been sad if I had dropped hints and played up the drama for nothing. ^_^;<br><br>- I have no idea if Agent Suzine is the same person as Nurse Suzine, but I wondered the same thing. I don&#39;t see how she could become Head Nurse while also working in an another department, but then again, this is HQ. Stranger things have happened.<br><br>- What&#39;s weird to me about Bleeprin is that it seems to have been thought up on the Board or elsewhere first, then added to HFA, since its first mention in HFA calls it &quot;the preferred medication of PPC agents&quot; and doesn&#39;t really describe it. Sorta like the audience is expected to know what it is already.<br><br>- The idea that everything we know about the PPC&#39;s early history is based on the wild speculation of one bored Elf amuses me greatly. *g*<br><br>- I just noticed something weird about the BRD. I was gonna add the Daffodil to the Glossary, but found that he already had an entry, linking to the version of &quot;Arathorn Did Not Have a Daughter&quot; on ff.net. The Daffodil is, in fact, mentioned there — Talia says, &quot;What, are you trying to kill the computer? While I have thought about it from time to time, the Daffodil won&#39;t appreciate having to call in Makes-things for the umpteenth time this week&quot; — but in the version I have, it&#39;s the SO named in that sentence. I wonder why they changed it, and what else might be different. O.o<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Though it does seem to be Ailavyn&#39;s... no, my vague memories include the agent getting off a ship at one point, and possibly that either the story or the agent were Thalia Weaver&#39;s. Since it <i>wasn&#39;t</i> Rhus Radicans, I&#39;m betting on the story. That connection may be why I associate it with Agent <i>Talia</i>.

            <p>I can&#39;t say I remember the exact point that <i>started</i> me shipping them--I&#39;m on season 3 and don&#39;t seem to do much rewatching of this show--but there&#39;s this one part where Moira and Walter (from <i>Arrow</i> are about to meet for dinner, and it just made me remember just how much I ship them.

            <p>Homestuck:<br>No spoilers:<br>I started shipping Dave and Jade during one of their pesterlogs, when Jade was trying to make a reference to Dave&#39;s webcomic and she got it wrong. She realized she got it wrong, but Dave said, &quot;no its alright. reference secured&quot; and I started shipping them like Chinese goods to the U.S.<br><br>Homestuck:<br><font color="red">SPOILERS AHEAD</font><br>There were actually two moments for this couple. During the <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003831">[S] John: Reunite with your loving wife and daughter</a> flash, while Karkat is watching John, Terezi bolts up, shoves him aside, and starts pointing at his screen and presumably giggling. The look of annoyance on his face is glorious, but more on that presently.<br><br>The second one is after Terezi watches a doomed Dave die. She&#39;s almost crying and Karkat comes up and looks at her from <i>way</i> in her bubble. Then he goes to poke her.<br><br>These are cute enough by themselves, but not necessarily indicative of romance. That&#39;s just how Terezi behaves around everyone, and Karkat is later seen to be poking Sollux in a similar manner. What got me shipping them is the fact that they behave almost exactly like my brother and sister-in-law... whose favorite colors are red and teal, respectively... which is weird...<br><br>But think of how awesome it is that I get to ship my brother and sister-in-law as fictional characters, and aliens, no less!<br><br>Doctor Who:<br><font color="red">SPOILERS AHEAD</font><br>Amy and Rory. I have to admit, for the entirety of Series Five and the beginning of Series Six, I though Amy was just plain annoying, and might possibly have had an unspoken rule to sleep her way around the universe. Or maybe just the TARDIS. Then, <i>The Curse of the Black Spot</i> happened. The interactions between Amy and Rory were so amazing during that episode! I think, though, that the part that especially got to me was when Amy was trying to convince the Siren that she was legally responsible for Rory and the short bit where Rory was teaching Amy to do CPR. Now I just think they&#39;re really cute together and I love them together.<br><br>That&#39;s actually pretty much my shipping life. I just don&#39;t ship that much.</p>

            <p>Spoilers will be marked <strike>((like so))</strike>. Read at your own discretion.<br><br>I don&#39;t tend to ship characters too often. I started shipping Makoharu harder after I watched Episode 6 of Free! <strike>((you know, the one where Haruka gets <i>that close</i> to giving Makoto mouth-to-mouth?))</strike>. It just made sense; the show was already teasing that pairing anyway.<br><br>I also started shipping Lyra/Silver when I got SoulSilver back in freshman year. Two reasons for that: first, Silver looks prettier in that game than he did in GSC, so it was easy for me to fangirl over him; second, I actually beat Lance in SoulSilver and thus got to witness more of his character development <strike>((especially at the double battle with him against Lance and Clair in Dragon&#39;s Den))</strike><br><br>To answer your actual question, though, I remember really wanting to ship Sherlock/Irene for a while the first time I watched &quot;A Scandal in Belgravia&quot; (or was that Sherlock/Molly? I can&#39;t remember, the episode kinda sorta teased both.) I guess it was the way they interacted; neither side willing to give ground (at first), both parties on each others&#39; intellectual level...yeah.</p>

            <p>Well, I was recently watching Doctor Who, and in specific the Season 2 episode The Idiot&#39;s Lantern. And the ONE MOMENT when he realises what they did to Rose (took her face and dumped her in the street) and his Tranquil Rage...as well as their reunion at the end... well, I&#39;m now a 10Rose shipper. In a simular vein, Rose being so mad/terrified for him in Fear Her really got to me.<br><br>And the Amy/Rory ship only really kicked in for me in The Angels Take Manhattan when Amy decided to jump off the roof with Rory even though there was a tiny chne she might survive. Plus she ignored the Doctor just so she coul be with her husband.<br>The one line that really got me was this-<br>&quot;We&#39;re changing the future.

            <p>For me, I actually started shipping 9/Rose when 9 absorbed the heart of the TARDIS to save Rose&#39;s life and ended up regenerating. And that just sort of... carried over for the tenth Doctor. ^_^ I won&#39;t lie, though- I&#39;m still upset at how the writers handled Rose and 10.2... I&#39;m sorry, but they aren&#39;t the same person. <br><br>&quot;Here, Rose! Sorry for getting you stuck in an alternate dimension! Have a consolation prize: your very own Doctor look-alike!&quot; <br><br>*ahem* Sorry, got a bit OT there.<br><br>I shipped Rory and Amy REALLY hard- until Amy tried to cheat on Rory with the Doctor the night before the wedding. I didn&#39;t have much of a high opinion of her until that moment on the roof. The whole season I kept wishing the writers didn&#39;t hate Rory so much. He guarded Amy&#39;s prison for thousands of years and he was smart enough to realize how the TARDIS&#39; &#39;bigger on the inside&#39; technology worked before the Doctor explained it, and was all around just a decent guy. I&#39;m glad Amy came through for him.<br><br>Let&#39;s see... In Harry Potter, I started shipping Ron and Hermione after their fight at the Yule Ball. But most of the time, I reserve shippings until either people pair up or the series ends. I like canon pairings. So sue me. <br><br>...my phone&#39;s autocorrect just tried to capitalize &#39;sue&#39;. I&#39;m scared now.</p>

            <p>Okay, UKvian PPCers - we have a Gathering planned, and it&#39;s time to finalise the details. I&#39;m going to list what I think is a decent setup, and if think anything needs changing - say so! Nothing&#39;s set in stone yet.<br><br>THE DATE: 16th August. We&#39;ve previously discussed this, and it seemed like the date most of us could get there.<br><br>THE PLACE: London. Specifically, how about the <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">British Museum</a>? It&#39;s free to enter, full of the traditional Shiny Objects, fairly central (as I described <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=260321;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>), and within walking distance of Covent Garden if we decide to go window shopping afterwards.<br><br>THE MEETING POINT: Probably the best thing to do would be to pick a column - how about the leftmost column on the main entrance staircase? <a href="http://s66.photobucket.com/user/TangledWebs/media/BMColumn.jpg.html">This one</a>. That&#39;s easy to find, not in the way, and not likely to go away.<br><br>THE TIME: 11 am? 12 noon? It looks like noon is fairly standard, so let&#39;s go with that, unless people have a problem with it.<br><br>THE LENGTH: I&#39;m going to say 3-4 hours. The museum closes at 5:30, so there&#39;s no problem there. The other thing that was brought up is football fixtures; well, it looks like they&#39;re all starting at 3. We can hide in the museum while people flock into London to watch the game/s, and if we finish around half three (give or take half an hour), we should be able to all get <i>away</i> from central London before the games finish and people flock back out.<br><br>So... what does anyone think? What&#39;ve I said that&#39;s stupid? What needs adjusting? What is the capital of Assyria?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I really couldn&#39;t get into your writing sample at all. It feels like it&#39;s going through the motions without any interest or emotion, a marionette show rather than a story. It&#39;s relatively sound from a technical perspective, but there&#39;s far more to writing than crossing all your &#39;T&#39;s and dotting all your &#39;I&#39;s.<br><br>I have no sense of who your characters are, what makes them tick, or what they like or dislike. I don&#39;t even have any sense that the organization in the recruitment story is the PPC - beyond the explanation that Agent Lowe gives, it feels nothing like the PPC. An interrogation room? A human in a suit? The line about Fisher being &quot;made to be a cafeteria worker&quot;? This is not what the PPC feels like.<br><br>Secondly, your behavior has been uninspiring. You rushed into your first permission request - which, in all fairness, happens a lot - but even your reply there showed no indication that you recognized what had gone wrong. I quote: &quot;I suppose that it is professional to send a standard rejection notice when a manuscript has been chewed up by the post office&quot; - a third-person-passive response that accepts no responsibility.<br><br>This permission request seems to have the exact same problem - rather than take the time to put together an organized request, you just dumped a link to a gdocs folder. This shows an active lack of respect for the PGs and process, and I would like to take this excellent opportunity to remind you that the PGs are both doing this in their spare time and are some of the more respected members of the community. Demonstrating that you don&#39;t respect people that the community tends to respect really doesn&#39;t do much to argue in your favor. (For that matter, your inability to get along with Neshomeh, who is one of the nicer PGs, is a significant point against you.)<br><br>And then there&#39;s <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2014/disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=260211">this thread</a>. You made a mistake, certainly - just about everyone has. However, you then doubled down and tried to defend what you had said, rather than admit that you had made a mistake. <br><br>On those two considerations, I&#39;m going to have to deny permission. <br><br>Finally, there is this thread and its fallout. Your exchanges with Neshomeh, VM, and Ekyl were irrational, bordering on incoherent, and completely out of line with what is expected of you on this forum. Furthermore, you have demonstrated no willingness to accept any responsibility for what happened. Your first &quot;apology&quot; message is nothing more than a list of excuses - it contains neither acknowledgement that you were out of line nor a single mention of the people you attacked. (For comparison&#39;s sake, you mentioned yourself in it no less than sixteen times.) Your behavior in the last two days would, on its own, be grounds for denial of permission.</p>

            <p>For the recruitment story, I&#39;m working in the dark on what happens when a self-insert who is sent to legal turns out to not be a real person.  I&#39;m also having trouble finding the origin stories for most of the former Sues, and what the process is to take them in beyond the &quot;Sue support group.&quot;  I have seen the &quot;join or die&quot; approach, but more for bits who would disappear with their fic.<br><br>If there is information on this, or simply a better approach to the problem, I&#39;d love to hear it.<br><br>As for Larry&#39;s problem, I would think that some recruits are judged as unsuitable for field work and offered support jobs instead.  It&#39;s not so much &quot;go work in the cafeteria&quot; as &quot;choose a non-action department or ask to be sent home.&quot;  I do see fics where the Flowers don&#39;t always put people where they want to go.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12dCWf7UErXDX9kAdBVIW-pVARa19kQeb70_Q-T10BuA/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12dCWf7UErXDX9kAdBVIW-pVARa19kQeb70_Q-T10BuA/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/12dCWf7UErXDX9kAdBVIW-pVARa19kQeb70_Q-T10BuA/edit</a></a><br><br>I&#39;ve got a tenuous idea that Larry took advantage of what training he could get as a cafeteria worker.  It would make sense that they could have both physical training and combat training available even to support personnel, considering how often in the past they had to fight for their lives.  Perhaps he even finds some Agents who actually like to talk about what they do.  These things would change his suitability.<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to address what&#39;s wrong with my characters.<br><br>And yeah, I did rush into my first permission request because following the no writing rule was causing me problems.  I rushed into this one as well because I&#39;d like some support on what I am writing.  I hope I can get that support on my out of continuity stuff so that it is not table-slappingly bad.<br></p>

            <p>Could you look at Samantha&#39;s origin story and help me figure out a better way to present it?  Actually sporking the story would involve me finding lost files or rewriting parts of a fanfic that I hate and want to start over on.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The interrogation room was similar to its counterpart seen on many cop shows.  It was a box with a single door, the entirety paneled in generic surface.  On one wall, where a large two-way mirror should be, were instead a series of tiny windows that did not try to disguise the darkened room beyond.  A large table with a bar affixed to its surface stood between two pairs of chairs that were bolted to the floor.<br><br>A female humanoid with dark hair and pale skin was chained the table&#39;s bar.  She perched on the edge of the chair so that the manacles didn&#39;t dig into her wrists.  She shot to her feet and bared her fangs as the door opened, but the chains prevented her from going anywhere.  She seemed embarrassed as she sat again and tried to arrange herself for the least discomfort.<br><br>A bipedal bull in a black uniform entered, followed by a bearded man in a business jacket.<br><br>“Hello, I&#39;m Agent Phillip Lowe,” the man said.  “I&#39;m sorry about the wait.  There was a slight paperwork issue, but we&#39;ve got it sorted out now.”<br><br>“I have the right to legal counsel.  I am an American citizen,” the prisoner argued.<br><br>“Unfortunately we are not part of any country, and your rights are limited.  The good news is that I&#39;m in charge of reviewing your situation.  If you are open and honest with me, we should be able to find the best outcome for you.”  He gave her a broad smile.  <br><br>He didn&#39;t mention that they had already determined that she wasn&#39;t really a person, according to a record-search of World One.  This time it was merely a formality, thanks to her author&#39;s self-insert avatar.  Lowe&#39;s job was to judge if she was a redeemable character or should be disposed of as a Mary-Sue.<br><br>She glowered.  “The woman who brought me here said that she would take me with her, but she neglected to mention that it would be to a jail.”<br><br>“We&#39;ll get to that eventually.  This temporary holding area is for your safety as well as ours.  Don&#39;t worry, leaving that world willingly is a point in your favor,” he said, flipping through the folder and scribbling a note.<br><br>Lowe pulled out his CAD.  The agents had been using an analog CAD for that mission, so their recorded reading was a non-standard “needled out and broke.”  Even if they had been using a model that he was familiar with, he preferred to trust his own readings.  Hiding his trepidation, he pointed his CAD at the prisoner.  [Samantha, female vampire, original character, 20% non-canonical.]  Lowe frowned and scribbled his finding in the relevant margin.  <br><br>He flipped back to the first page of the file to remind himself of the important details.  The summary read: standard “sucked into known media” plot, class five reality disruption that stabilized quickly, naturalization occurred, but in a non-canonical AU.  <br><br>“Well, we have the agents&#39; report, but we are interested in your point of view.  Keep in mind that this discussion is a small part of our process.”  Lowe flipped to the second page, smiled, and said,  “Let&#39;s begin at the beginning.  Tell me about how you arrived in that world.”<br><br>It was a moment before Samantha spoke.  “I remember not knowing how came to arrive in Janos&#39; home.  I am unsure if it was because I felt sorry for him and made a bad wish, or if that is how I justified it afterward.”  She paused.  “When I arrived there, I only had a moment to think.  I recognized where I was, but did not have time to consider the repercussions before I acted.”<br><br>Lowe made a mental note to ask about the repercussions later.  “And then what happened?”<br><br>“Thanks to me, Janos survived what was supposed to be his death, and the Sarafan took me to their stronghold.  I lost consciousness when they were torturing me, and when I woke up, Kain had rescued me.  I hoped that by helping him, I would be allowed to return home.”<br><br>“Why did Kain help you, and why did you focus on him?”  <br><br>“Kain said that something drew him to me.  I believe that he could sense whatever was allowing me to defy the temporal laws of his world.  He would have used my strange influence whether I was willing or not.  I was fortunate that he did not hurt me when he learned that I had knowledge and refused to share it immediately.”<br><br>“You said that helping Kain might take you home?”  Lowe prompted.<br><br>“It is his game, well, also Raziel&#39;s.  Kain is where the story began, but he was also standing at the end.  The fate of Nosgoth rests on him.”<br><br>Lowe scribbled a note about “helping the hero” in the file and said.  “You mentioned something about breaking the rules of that world.”<br><br>“There are two forces in that world.  Destiny dictates the important events in their lives, and there is almost nothing they can do to escape it.  History will prevent a time-traveler from altering significant events.”  Samantha clenched her fists.  “I should not have been able to save Janos Audron.  There were too many events that were tied to his death.”<br><br>Lowe gave her a moment as he turned to another section of the file.  “It says that you kept influencing the main characters even after that.”<br><br>“The damage had been done, and the consequences would have been far worse if I had said nothing.  I could only convince them to follow the path that they would have taken without my interference.  I am glad that Raziel did not learn the truth of his Destiny from me, but there are events that would have been difficult.  I eventually would have been responsible for my own sire&#39;s murder.”<br><br>He noticed how much angst-fuel Samantha had, and wondered how much therapy it would require to make her well-adjusted.  “It says that you asked to be made into a vampire.”<br><br>“I would not have chosen the dark gift if I were not dying.  All souls are consumed by a horrible creature and I was desperate to avoid that fate.”<br><br>Lowe decided that he couldn&#39;t stand much more.  He decided not to ask about a tragic childhood because her present was depressing enough.  The file indicated that she had even suffered an existential crisis about being a vampire.  “Let&#39;s talk about what you did when the agents read your charges.”<br><br>“I fear I that got distracted when they mentioned &#39;trans-dimensional.&#39;  I imagine that I interrupted them when I demanded to know if they were responsible for my predicament,” Samantha admitted.  “I should have been more wary.  They wanted to remove me from Nosgoth, and I happily followed them when they assured me that the original time-line would reassert itself once I was away.  Was this the case?”<br><br>“Don&#39;t worry, restoring canonical time-lines is the primary mission of the PPC,” Lowe assured her.  “Reading the charge list is more of a formality, but I have a copy right here if you are curious.”  <br><br>At her nod, Lowe flipped to the appropriate page and began reading.  “Being a Self-Insert and causing a Class 5 reality dysfunction, having such a high Sue reading that it broke the CAD, creating an alternate universe, causing main characters to care about and fight over you, causing main characters to have rule-breaking powers, asking to become a vampire, having an important vampire change you, having angst about having to drink blood, having angst in general, posing as an oracle, using time-travel to create a deus-ex-machina, having main characters confide in you above other canon characters, causing a character&#39;s girlfriend to cease existing, and telling a main character about said girlfriend to instigate romantic feelings but pretending not to be interested.”<br><br>Samantha&#39;s nails dragged on the table, producing an unpleasant screech.  “I certainly was not interested in Kain!  He is a monster, and preventing his doomed romance had very little to do with my intentions.”  She composed herself.  “There were times that I regretted interfering, and I sometimes did question my choice to become a vampire.  Of the rest that I understand from that list, there are things for which I could not be held accountable.”<br><br>For the first time, Lowe stopped smiling.  “We determined that the charges stand, and the only thing left is decide what to do with you.  We can&#39;t remove your vampirism, so we can&#39;t send you to any place other than Nosgoth.  But if the rules of that world don&#39;t apply to you even after we remove your memories, we will simply have to dispose of you.”<br><br>Samantha snarled as she stood, but she only bruised her wrists on her restraints again.  She breathed heavily as she stared at Lowe in anger.  “I do not wish to die.  However, it is preferable to die here than to be sent back to Nosgoth, even if I become ignorant of what will happen when the inevitable comes.”<br><br>“There is one more possibility.  We at at PPC are always recruiting new agents; people who go into other worlds and remove intruders.  The hours are long, the pay is nonexistent, and in my opinion you would go flamethrower-crazy in less than a year.  But I could ignore my better judgment and forward your file to the Marquis de Sod.  There&#39;s no guarantee that you&#39;ll be accepted, but it may be worth a shot.”<br><br>Samantha was silent for a moment, then made a sound between a cough and a laugh.  “Yet another choiceless choice.  By all means, send my file.  It would not do to refuse this opportunity.”<br><br><br><br><br>Charge List: <br>Being a Self-Insert and causing a Class 5 reality dysfunction <br>Having such a high Sue reading that it broke the CAD<br>Creating an alternate universe<br>Causing main characters to care about and fight over you<br>Causing main characters to have rule-breaking powers<br>Asking to become a vampire<br>Having an important vampire change you<br>Having angst about having to drink blood<br>Having angst in general<br>Posing as an oracle<br>Using time-travel to create a deus-ex-machina<br>Having main characters confide in you above other canon characters<br>Causing a character&#39;s girlfriend to cease existing<br>Telling a main character about said girlfriend to instigate romantic feelings, but pretending not to be interested<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I cannot decide if Philip Lowe is actually there to examine her, or if he is a sociopathic testing instrument that has no actual say in whether or not the file gets forwarded to the appropriate department.<br><br>The readout if they had been using a normal CAD would be [Nope nope nope *POP*] as the magic smoke leaks out.</p>

            <p>1) This isn&#39;t going to be a detailed response, mostly because I&#39;m based in the UK, and it&#39;s just gone midnight.<br><br>2) Generally speaking, betaing is done off the Board - either in GoogleDocs, a Word file or something. Putting stuff up on the Board is publishing it, and you&#39;re going to want a beta to take a look at it before that stage. I tried to access Samantha&#39;s recruitment story from the Google drive link you gave at the top of this thread, but it was only allowing me some strange preview view. If you can change the access settings so that I can comment directly on the text, then that&#39;d probably be the easiest way of doing it. <br><br>3) Yup, I can go through the story and make suggestions. Just bear in mind that I&#39;m not a Permission Giver myself, so my opinion of what they&#39;re after may not match up exactly with what they want. </p>

            <p>I did not ask for a beta reader before because I was trying to hide that I was writing without permission.  And most of it is in the stage of not so much needing a beta as needing some bored person to present an opinion on a rough sketch.<br><br>I forgot what some of my concerns were.<br><br>There is one thing that I wrote where I began to doubt if the story was even missionable.  I&#39;m still debating whether I should fix the glaring problem besides that, or have other eyes tell me to find a different story.  I think that the mission is more NSFW than the original story, which was a YKINMK, and I might have pushed the NSFB aspect.  There is also something I read today that might be a critical research failure on my part or just an odd quirk of that author.<br><br>The rest is a mess.  <br><br>One that is still in the peat-moss stage needs a complete rewrite because the dominant agent should be letting the weaker one run the show.  <br><br>Another one is dependent on rewriting Samantha&#39;s origin story.<br><br>The rest are too skeletal to look at.</p>

            <p>The interrogation room was similar to its counterpart seen on many cop shows. It was a box with a<br><br>single door, the entirety paneled in generic surface. On one wall, where a large two­way mirror<br><br>should be, were instead a series of tiny windows that did not try to disguise the darkened room<br><br>beyond. A large table with a bar affixed to its surface stood between two pairs of chairs that were<br><br>bolted to the floor.<br><br>A female humanoid with dark hair and pale skin was chained the table&#39;s bar. She perched on the<br><br>edge of the chair so that the manacles didn&#39;t dig into her wrists. She shot to her feet and bared her<br><br>fangs as the door opened, but the chains prevented her from going anywhere. She seemed<br><br>embarrassed as she sat again and tried to arrange herself for the least discomfort.<br><br>A bipedal bull in a black uniform entered, followed by a bearded man in a business jacket.<br><br>“Hello, I&#39;m Agent Phillip Lowe,” the man said. “I&#39;m sorry about the wait. There was a slight<br><br>paperwork issue, but we&#39;ve got it sorted out now.”<br><br>“I have the right to legal counsel. I am an American citizen,” the prisoner argued.<br><br>“Unfortunately we are not part of any country, and your rights are limited. The good news is that<br><br>I&#39;m in charge of reviewing your situation. If you are open and honest with me, we should be able<br><br>to find the best outcome for you.” He gave her a broad smile.<br><br>He didn&#39;t mention that they had already determined that she wasn&#39;t really a person, according to a<br><br>record­search of World One. This time it was merely a formality, thanks to her author&#39;s self­insert<br><br>avatar. Lowe&#39;s job was to judge if she was a redeemable character or should be disposed of as a<br><br>Mary­Sue.<br><br>She glowered. “The woman who brought me here said that she would take me with her, but she<br><br>neglected to mention that it would be to a jail.”<br><br>“We&#39;ll get to that eventually. This temporary holding area is for your safety as well as ours. Don&#39;t<br><br>worry, leaving that world willingly is a point in your favor,” he said, flipping through the folder<br><br>and scribbling a note.<br><br>Lowe pulled out his CAD. The agents had been using an analog CAD for that mission, so their<br><br>recorded reading was a non­standard “needled out and broke.” Even if they had been using a<br><br>model that he was familiar with, he preferred to trust his own readings. Hiding his trepidation, he<br><br>pointed his CAD at the prisoner. [Samantha, female vampire, original character, 20% non-<br>canonical.] Lowe frowned and scribbled his finding in the relevant margin.<br><br>He flipped back to the first page of the file to remind himself of the important details. The<br><br>summary read: standard “sucked into known media” plot, class five reality disruption that<br><br>stabilized quickly, naturalization occurred, but in a non­canonical AU.<br><br>“Well, we have the agents&#39; report, but we are interested in your point of view. Keep in mind that<br><br>this discussion is a small part of our process.” Lowe flipped to the second page, smiled, and said,<br><br>“Let&#39;s begin at the beginning. Tell me about how you arrived in that world.”<br><br>It was a moment before Samantha spoke. “I remember not knowing how came to arrive in Janos&#39;<br><br>home. I am unsure if it was because I felt sorry for him and made a bad wish, or if that is how I<br><br>justified it afterward.” She paused. “When I arrived there, I only had a moment to think. I<br><br>recognized where I was, but did not have time to consider the repercussions before I acted.”<br><br>Lowe made a mental note to ask about the repercussions later. “And then what happened?”<br><br>“Thanks to me, Janos survived what was supposed to be his death, and the Sarafan took me to their<br><br>stronghold. I lost consciousness when they were torturing me, and when I woke up, Kain had<br><br>rescued me. I hoped that by helping him, I would be allowed to return home.”<br><br>“Why did Kain help you, and why did you focus on him?”<br><br>“Kain said that something drew him to me. I believe that he could sense whatever was allowing<br><br>me to defy the temporal laws of his world. He would have used my strange influence whether I<br><br>was willing or not. I was fortunate that he did not hurt me when he learned that I had knowledge<br><br>and refused to share it immediately.”<br><br>“You said that helping Kain might take you home?” Lowe prompted.<br><br>“It is his game, well, also Raziel&#39;s. Kain is where the story began, but he was also standing at the<br><br>end. The fate of Nosgoth rests on him.”<br><br>Lowe scribbled a note about “helping the hero” in the file and said. “You mentioned something<br><br>about breaking the rules of that world.”<br><br>“There are two forces in that world. Destiny dictates the important events in their lives, and there<br><br>is almost nothing they can do to escape it. History will prevent a time­traveler from altering<br><br>significant events.” Samantha clenched her fists. “I should not have been able to save Janos<br><br>Audron. There were too many events that were tied to his death.”<br><br>Lowe gave her a moment as he turned to another section of the file. “It says that you kept<br><br>influencing the main characters even after that.”<br><br>“The damage had been done, and the consequences would have been far worse if I had said<br><br>nothing. I could only convince them to follow the path that they would have taken without my<br><br>interference. I am glad that Raziel did not learn the truth of his Destiny from me, but there are<br><br>events that would have been difficult. I eventually would have been responsible for my own sire&#39;s<br><br>murder.”<br><br>He noticed how much angst­fuel Samantha had, and wondered how much therapy it would require<br><br>to make her well­adjusted. “It says that you asked to be made into a vampire.”<br><br>“I would not have chosen the dark gift if I were not dying. All souls are consumed by a horrible<br><br>creature and I was desperate to avoid that fate.”<br><br>Lowe decided that he couldn&#39;t stand much more. He decided not to ask about a tragic childhood<br><br>because her present was depressing enough. The file indicated that she had even suffered an<br><br>existential crisis about being a vampire. “Let&#39;s talk about what you did when the agents read your<br><br>charges.”<br><br>“I fear I that got distracted when they mentioned &#39;trans­dimensional.&#39; I imagine that I interrupted<br><br>them when I demanded to know if they were responsible for my predicament,” Samantha<br><br>admitted. “I should have been more wary. They wanted to remove me from Nosgoth, and I<br><br>happily followed them when they assured me that the original time­line would reassert itself once I<br><br>was away. Was this the case?”<br><br>“Don&#39;t worry, restoring canonical time­lines is the primary mission of the PPC,” Lowe assured<br><br>her. “Reading the charge list is more of a formality, but I have a copy right here if you are<br><br>curious.”<br><br>At her nod, Lowe flipped to the appropriate page and began reading. “Being a Self­Insert and<br><br>causing a Class 5 reality dysfunction, having such a high Sue reading that it broke the CAD,<br><br>creating an alternate universe, causing main characters to care about and fight over you, causing<br><br>main characters to have rule­breaking powers, asking to become a vampire, having an important<br><br>vampire change you, having angst about having to drink blood, having angst in general, posing as<br><br>an oracle, using time­travel to create a deus­ex­machina, having main characters confide in you<br><br>above other canon characters, causing a character&#39;s girlfriend to cease existing, and telling a main<br><br>character about said girlfriend to instigate romantic feelings but pretending not to be interested.”<br><br>Samantha&#39;s nails dragged on the table, producing an unpleasant screech. “I certainly was not<br><br>interested in Kain! He is a monster, and preventing his doomed romance had very little to do with<br><br>my intentions.” She composed herself. “There were times that I regretted interfering, and I<br><br>sometimes did question my choice to become a vampire. Of the rest that I understand from that<br><br>list, there are things for which I could not be held accountable.”<br><br>For the first time, Lowe stopped smiling. “We determined that the charges stand, and the only<br><br>thing left is decide what to do with you. We can&#39;t remove your vampirism, so we can&#39;t send you to<br><br>any place other than Nosgoth. But if the rules of that world don&#39;t apply to you even after we<br><br>remove your memories, we will simply have to dispose of you.”<br><br>Samantha snarled as she stood, but she only bruised her wrists on her restraints again. She<br><br>breathed heavily as she stared at Lowe in anger. “I do not wish to die. However, it is preferable to<br><br>die here than to be sent back to Nosgoth, even if I become ignorant of what will happen when the<br><br>inevitable comes.”<br><br>“There is one more possibility. We at at PPC are always recruiting new agents; people who go<br><br>into other worlds and remove intruders. The hours are long, the pay is nonexistent, and in my<br><br>opinion you would go flamethrower­crazy in less than a year. But I could ignore my better<br><br>judgment and forward your file to the Marquis de Sod. There&#39;s no guarantee that you&#39;ll be<br><br>accepted, but it may be worth a shot.”<br><br>Samantha was silent for a moment, then made a sound between a cough and a laugh. “Yet another<br><br>choiceless choice. By all means, send my file. It would not do to refuse this opportunity.”<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I cannot decide if Philip Lowe is actually there to examine her, or if he is a sociopathic testing<br><br>instrument that has no actual say in whether or not the file gets forwarded to the appropriate<br><br>department.<br><br>The readout if they had been using a normal CAD would be [Nope nope nope *POP*] as the<br><br>magic smoke leaks out.<br><br></p>

            <p>This is from a deliberately bad meta­story where the canon characters know that a crazy fangirl<br><br>runs the world with inconsistently godlike powers. What they don&#39;t realize is that she&#39;s affected<br><br>their minds so that they are happier and more maliable.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The Chess Museum was a humble building that felt more like a public library than a gallery. Rows<br><br>of shelves held glass display boxes of chesspieces and boards instead of books, though there also<br><br>was a small collection of books about chess near the entrance.<br><br>Some chess sets were normal except for the artistic quality of their pieces. Others had oddly-<br>shaped boards or were designed for more than two players. There were even chesslike game sets<br><br>like Shogi and Chaturanga in the rear shelves.<br><br>Multiple tables were scattered in the main area. Kain and Vorador often met at this place. It was<br><br>completely neutral and open to all, but quiet because few knew that existed.<br><br>Kain and Vorador had chosen the most generic example of a normal chess set to play with, and<br><br>were playing with the standard rules.<br><br>“What possessed you to raise my sire&#39;s murderer as your child?” Vorador asked.<br><br>“That detail had been lost to legend,” Kain admitted. “I had merely found the tomb of their most<br><br>revered warriors, and defiled them.”<br><br>“I hope you are satisfied,” Vorador grumbled.<br><br>“It was magnificent,” Kain grinned. Then he sobered. “I shall miss them.”<br><br>Vorador frowned, but did not press for details. For most, it was impolite to inquire about dead<br><br>fledglings. In Kain&#39;s case, Vorador was afraid of the answers. He hadn&#39;t minded when he learned<br><br>the fates of the traitors he had mistakenly sired, but was still sore that Umah had been lumped in<br><br>with them.<br><br>“And now we have to suffer Malek&#39;s presence,” Vorador scowled, changing the subject.<br><br>“I never understood the value of simply humiliating an enemy,” Kain admitted.<br><br>Vorador was about to make his move, but he let his talon fall to the arm of his chair instead. “I<br><br>wish that he had found me sooner so that I could have killed him outright. Rage had blinded me,<br><br>and I was afraid of the damage I had already done.”<br><br>“Why did you help me, then?” Kain asked.<br><br>“I had a small shred of hope that you were our savior, but for the most part, I no longer cared.”<br><br>Vorador finally reached across the board and placed his knight with a firm tap.<br><br>Kain stood. “How dare you keep me ignorant of my role?”<br><br>“Those prophesies destroyed far greater vampires than you, Kain,” Vorador answered, also<br><br>standing. “Either you would save us or you wouldn&#39;t, and I was not going to burden you with<br><br>incomplete scraps that could be misinterpreted so easily.”<br><br>Both froze in dread at the palpable sensation of being watched. Every shadow seemed to stare<br><br>accusingly for the simple crime of speaking too loudly. Vorador and Kain both took their seats<br><br>again and tried to concentrate on the game until those inscrutable presences once again gave them<br><br>the barest of notice.<br><br>“The only thing that is protecting Malek now is that we have been told not to kill him,” Kain said,<br><br>pointedly ignoring their argument and the forces that had stopped them.<br><br>“As if you have ever paid attention when told not to do something,” Vorador complained.<br><br>“Though I do believe that she phrased it as a request.”<br><br>Kain frowned. He had faced impossible odds, a mad god, and defied fate itself. It wasn&#39;t that he<br><br>was afraid of a capricious girl who could control all of existence and bend his very thoughts to her<br><br>whim. He was simply aware that some scenarios were preferable to others.<br><br>“Tread carefully, Vorador. She has given you very little attention, but that may change,” Kain<br><br>warned. “Ignoring Malek is a small indignity, one that he may suffer for without our interference.”<br><br>“Malek did say that he suffered a fate worse than death after I had left him defeated,” Vorador<br><br>conceded. “I can only hope that allowing him to live now will bring him nothing but misery.”<br><br>When their game was finished, Kain and Vorador simply left the set sitting on the table, knowing<br><br>that the mysterious caretakers would return it to its place.</p>

            <p>Stats:<br>Name: Lawrence Fisher (Larry)    <br>Age, Sex, Species: 32 years, male, human<br>Home Continuum:  21st century Earth, unknown origin    <br>RC, Department, Partner: RC 387, Floaters, Samantha<br><br>Appearance: Chubby-muscular. 5’10, Sandy-blond hair a couple inches long, medium skin tone, medium brown eyes.<br><br>Character Reference: Joey from Full House.<br><br>He’s eager.  Not intellectual, but also not stupid.  He tends to reference TV tropes when talking about something.  (Note: make him say an entire sentence that is hard to understand unless the person knows tropes, and then make him repeat it in more layman’s language.)<br><br>Larry is a fan of anime, good animation, Sci-Fi, kid-friendly movies, and fun movies with a lot of special effects.  He tends to be excited about missions if they don’t look too horrible at first glance.  He likes meeting canon characters and helping them get back into canon before neuralysing them.  <br><br>(Animation: Batman, Spiderman, Avatar, Gargoyles, Green Lantern, etc.  Anime: both versions of Full Metal Alchemist, Pumpkin Scissors, Aquarion. Movies: most of the Pixar and Dreamworks, Transformers, First Knight, Men in Black, both versions of The Time Machine.)<br><br>(Find an excuse for him to watch Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Haibane Renmei.  Also watch Sword Art Online, Hellsing, and Attack on Titan to see if I can learn the universes well enough to add them to his interests.)<br><br>He came from a “real” world through a plothole, but no one knows which world it was.  (He’s a muggle from an American Harry Potter ripoff.  Or he’s a muggle from Skin Deep.)<br><br>He has an academic interest in medieval weapons and how well fantasy weapons would work.  (Watch Cloud’s buster sword in real life videos.)<br><br>He was shown how to use a handgun during his PPC training.  This makes him handy with a tranquilizer pistol, but he needs to hit his partner at least once.  (Samantha’s flesh necrotizes around the impact site quickly, and she doesn’t go unconscious.  She recovers with application of the whatsit.)<br><br>Larry is afraid of spiders for no good reason.<br><br>What department would get him used to the PPC, but still make him long for the excitement of actually going into the Word Worlds?  Was he a dissatisfied Intelligence Agent, or was he made to be a Cafeteria worker for several months before training to kill Sues?</p>

            <p>Stats:<br>Name: Samantha Frankson    <br>Age, Sex, Species: Female, 23 years as a human, plus about 450 as a Nosgoth second-generation vampire<br>Home Continuum:  Her childhood memories are from a “real” 21st century Earth, but she’s lived in Nosgoth for most of her life    <br>RC, Department, Partner: RC 387, Floaters, (focuses on the Legacy of Kain continuum between her partner’s interests,) partnered with Lawrence Fisher.<br><br>Appearance: Petite, about 5-foot 4-inches. Black hair to mid-shoulderblades, pale skin tone, yellow eyes, pointed ears, dark lips, and fangs.  When disguised as her human self, she has curly blonde hair and bright blue eyes.<br><br>View “Vampire strengths and Weaknesses that apply to Samantha” to see the justification for my head-canon vampire template.<br><br>Samantha was a twenty-something inhabitant of the “real world” and a fangirl of the Legacy of Kain video game series. She then was sucked into Nosgoth and was a Mary-Sue for the full five minutes it took to realize what was going on and save a main character from dying. Then some flavor of reality kicked in and she had a horrible and miserable week of being a less-than average human in Nosgoth. Then she became sick, had to beg the canon characters not to let her die, and the only way to save her was to turn her into a vampire.  She then spends the next 500 years being an ally and adviser to the canon characters.<br><br>Her memories and official PPC file show that she was confronted for breaking the universe. She apologized that she didn’t mean it and said that she wanted to be human again and taken home, but also showed concern for the reality she was in since she knew about the damage. (The C-CAD popped before giving a good reading.)  The main reason that she wasn’t killed as a Sue was because Despatch took her mission and Legal offered her a choice.<br><br>Samantha has some difficulty relating to people, especially young humans.  She has an internal thought process that artificially prompts her to treat everyone as a person even if she sees them as walking prey.  (She consciously thinks about how she smiles, whether or not she wants to show her fangs.)  She is used to being subordinate, so will follow instructions from someone she respects as more-knowledgeable.  Samantha has imperfect self-control.  She can get angry without showing it, but will occasionally lash out, even if she apologizes for being so blunt immediately after.<br><br>Character reference, Florence Ambrose from Freefall.  A little bit of McGonagal’s prickly on the outside with even less softness on the inside.<br><br>She is competent in defending herself unarmed against pikes and swords.  She can somewhat handle a sword.  She can kill someone with her bare claws, and needs training in non-lethal unarmed fighting.  She is fairly helpless when disguised as a human or anything similar, but will insist on more training after her first mission gets her shot.<br><br>She has no self-agency.  Things happen to her instead of her making things happen.  When she graduated High School, she still didn’t know what she wanted to be when she grew up.  Fate had her witness a crime so her attention to detail could be noticed by an investigator who told her he’d hire her if she went through the right training.  She said yes.  Since then, she’s been presented with choices that had a clearer “right” answer, and has the gall to be angry when the other option is death.  It is strange when she expresses a desire to do missions outside of the Legacy of Kain fandom.<br><br>She has the ability to memorize well.  It is not eidetic, but rather a study and recall habit.  This means that she has to notice something and consciously decide to remember it, and she might forget something if it has been a while since she last thought of it.  She cannot decide to forget something on command.  <br><br>She could have been smart, but she is under-educated and never bothered to learn some of the more useful knowledge.  There is also a difference between memorizing something and comprehending it.  One of the talents she developed was to draw recognizably from memory.<br><br>Sometimes she gets OCD-like tendencies, but it never gets bad enough to become a properly diagnosable issue.  Usually it doesn’t disturb her when something is out of place, she just notices it and manages to stop thinking about it.  Sometimes she will be unable to sleep if she has left something unfinished or starts worrying about the mini-squids escaping.<br><br>Because she was trapped in a video game, she has a slight anxiety when something reminds her of that.  Not really a weakness because the anxiety is easily manageable.  She is also afraid of the Elder God, but that is a sensible extension of being afraid of dying.</p>

            <p>Actually, the second prompt is Samantha&#39;s recruitment.  I forgot about that this morning since I couldn&#39;t see it.

            <p>Prompt 62: The agents receive a parcel.<br><br>In RC 387, Samantha and Larry were having an argument about the ending of “Bill &amp; Ted’s Bogus Journey.”<br><br>“It only looks like it broke the rules because Rufus did not completely explain the finer points of how time travel functions,” Samantha said.  “Imagine that you are providing a time machine to two idiots who cannot pass a history exam without help.  It is completely plausible that he only gave them the instructions they needed to accomplish the task.”<br><br>While Larry was thinking, a knock sounded at the RC door.  Thanks to a faulty latch, it decided to swing open on its own.  Samantha leaped to her feet to confront their visitor.<br><br>“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to, it just came open,” the young boy said.<br><br>“It does tend to,” Samantha said as she relaxed slightly.  “Who are you, and why have you come?”<br><br>“Simon, from the Postal Department.  I have a package for Agent Lawrence Fisher.”<br><br>“That’s me.”<br><br>Since Samantha was the one standing, she took the package from Simon and closed the door.  She handed the package to Larry, who shrugged as he opened the box.  Inside was a box set of Puella Magi Madoka Magica.  A note typed on the packing slip read “Please add this canon to your knowledge.”<br><br>“But it’s a magical girl anime,” he complained as he read the back of the box.  “How about you take it?”<br><br>“Japanese cartoons tend to be weird,” she answered.  “It was addressed to you.”<br><br>“Watch it with me.”  Larry put the disc into the dvd slot on the console.<br><br>Samantha quickly lost interest due to the surrealism, but Larry was hooked by the third episode.  Then she became mildly interested by overhearing the end of episode six.  By episode eight, both were practically drooling with the desire to see the next plot twist.  <br><br>Ten minutes into episode ten, the video stuttered, and the console started playing the mission tone.  Larry punched the “accept” button and shouted, “That is the worst timing ever!”  He read a line of the brief and said, “It’s one of yours.”<br><br>Samantha grimaced as she convinced herself that they could finish watching the anime when they got back.  She quickly read over the mission and asked, “Are you willing to try again at pretending to be a vampire?”<br></p>

            <p>And incredibly rude to throw at Neshomeh, who, after all, is doing this out of her own spare time, voluntarily. Especially since she has a very valid point there; the PGs have lives, and finite amounts of time in which to live them. Expecting us to go through every single file out of twenty or so, rather than simply labeling them in the header, is very disrespectful.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s probably something that should&#39;ve been brought up in private. And it absolutely does not excuse your being rude to her. However, let me debunk something for you. The first permission giver with the time and inclination is the one to reply, and if they are even <i>slightly</i> unsure of their decision, they/we seek a second opinion, either on the Board or off. Nobody &quot;falls in behind&quot; an opinion they don&#39;t agree with, and I do somewhat resent that implication. In case it&#39;s unclear, we tend to be pretty open about our opinions hereabouts.<br><br>All that said - Nesh, would you prefer to pass this one along?

            <p>Since the Disguise questions didn’t distinct between headcanon and what has been described in mission reports, and my non-existent agents cannot actually do anything, I may need to list my rather random answers here, so that the numbers for “actually mentioned” may be decreased appropriately:<br><br>D1: Do your agents use disguises? <br>Yes, but only when they don&#39;t already blend in or spend the entire mission hiding under a bed (in a closet, behind the walls, etc).<br><br>D2: What are your agents aiming for when they wear disguises? <br>They try to blend in with their surroundings with something that will be at least probable throughout the entire mission (unless I get an idea that’s more funny).<br><br>D3: How thoroughly are your agents changed when they wear a disguise? <br>It depends on the particular agent. (As far as I can see now, my agents will be a <i>World of Warcraft</i> night elf druid and a human from World One, and their missions will mostly be in the potterverse, where the night elf needs a change of species, but the human doesn’t.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve gone for the minority (of one) opinion that there&#39;s no such thing as SEP fields and sticking wires on the back of a bit of fabric is a bloomin&#39; stupid idea. However, I&#39;m not adverse to <i>other</i> people claiming there&#39;s SEP fields in the PPC (it would be quite difficult to claim they haven&#39;t), and will merrily theorise about how they work. Just don&#39;t expect me to mention them in my stories. ^-^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Man, I am definitely getting this novel.  There&#39;s so much I like about these two chapters!<br><br>The world-building is just straight-up fantastic.  It does get a little prosy here, but it&#39;s a reasonable way to introduce the reader to the characteristics of the world.  (And it sure hooked me in, too!)  I love that the action so far is mostlyly dominated by female characters.  We&#39;ve got Waslo and Master, and one dead dad, and even those two living men are more peripheral compared to Governess&#39; influence over Livia&#39;s life.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to see Livia and Lex unite and tear down this wretched society!<br><br>Also, did anyone else see this in the sidebar?<br><a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1862915/jk-rowling-new-harry-potter-story/"><a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1862915/jk-rowling-new-harry-potter-story/">http://www.mtv.com/news/1862915/jk-rowling-new-harry-potter-story/</a></a></p>

            <p>The society in the book appears to be a bizarre combination of future dystopia and Victorian England (governesses, debutante ball, Proper Young Ladies, all that rot).<br><br>It&#39;s not terrible, I&#39;ll give them that. The narrator (Livia; maybe the second one is harmless) never shuts up, so there&#39;s one key problem. You&#39;re also quite accurate about the plot formula, and I didn&#39;t even finish the first chapter. <br><br>Bright spots include the idea of a floating dystopian city. (I&#39;m sure there are others, but I didn&#39;t finish.)</p>

            <p>While I can read this type of narrative, I prefer not to. I will admit that it snuck up on me when I was reading Warm Bodies since it starts off as a first person train of thought about being a zombie, and then I never noticed that the tense never switched to past tense.<br><br>I prefer my first person in past tense myself, though a friend of mine said that, after me complaining about PTFP, that if the narrator is retelling the tale, then you know they survive. Well I proved her wrong with my last NaNoWriMo and killed off the main character who was Narrating. So there.<br><br>I know Drew can&#39;t stand reading PTFP narration, which is a shame cause she was interested in reading the Divergent series.<br><br><br>That&#39;s my 5 cents (since pennies don&#39;t exist in Canada any more)</p>

            <p>It&#39;s the easiest way for an inexperienced writer to add a sense of immediacy to the story.  And, more importantly, the easiest way for an inexperienced reader to actually pick up on that sense of immediacy while more subtle methods might pass over their heads.<br><br>Since this is a story by a pair of celebrities (inexperienced writers) and the target audience is their young fans (presumably including many inexperienced readers) it&#39;s the right choice for the story.<br></p>

            <p>... as past (and more so than future - though I&#39;m sure that&#39;s been done. How about pluperfect? Conditional? <i>If there were a hobbit, he might live in a hole in the ground...</i>). And first person is just as valid as third. And omniscient and limited are just as valid as each other, too. All the combinations have their uses and applications, their difficulties and their specialities.<br><br>For instance, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1qbQw01fcZCAguT8JJFHmAMbB1i76dXmdtp0lWMXNfUw">Agent Narto</a> writes his mission reports in first person, past tense, limited (as does <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFF8he9DI24dk5CA_YUVGdAWQJFBvIRzMQzJ8aErGek/pub">Agent Huinesoron</a>); it&#39;s a narrative conceit, allowing these documents to be &#39;in-universe mission reports&#39;. The limited viewpoint flows from that - hS <i>doesn&#39;t know</i> what his partner is thinking, and moreover, his own worldview colours his transcription of theirs.<br><br>Most of my writings tend towards third-person past omniscient, since I do a lot of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M0thuLbqD_bcUDZ3uCjay6YuXgf4Q1zfStxRQCb8zwA/pub">histories</a>, but I also enjoy third-past-limited <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TjFsuVhzR_iPwxw_sxLz9LjuDF6ylRbA6FrXMI-EVrw/pub">like this</a>. And my first NaNo - and my second - was, I think, in first-person-present. It&#39;s great for immanency - past tense first person pretty much rules out the possibility of the speaker dying, but the present - well, compare and contrast:<br><br><i>I knew it wasn&#39;t going to work, I just knew it. There was no chance. But on the other hand... what choice did I have? It was this or surrender. Do or die. All or nothing.<br><br>I took a deep breath.<br><br>I leapt.</i><br><br>~~~~<br><br><i>I know it&#39;s not going to work, I just know it. There&#39;s no chance at all. But on the other hand... what choice do I have? It&#39;s this, or surrender. Do, or die. All, or nothing.<br><br>I take a deep breath.<br><br>I leap--!</i><br><br>The former is &#39;I had to jump off a building, so I did&#39;. The latter is &#39;oh gods above I have no choice but to jump off this building I&#39;m gonna diiiiiie!&#39;. For that sort of story, I prefer the present tense.<br><br>(Third-person present, I&#39;m not so sure about... no, I think it can still work. It feels a bit like a film, though. &#39;The knight rides into the valley below the castle, all his senses on high alert. He knows there will be trouble - he just doesn&#39;t know where from&#39;.)<br><br>Asking yourself &#39;is there some particular reason this is in past tense?&#39; is actually really good practice. It&#39;s like asking &#39;is there some particular reason the ruler has to be male?&#39; or &#39;is there some particular reason the elf prince has to marry the pretty girl?&#39; (ans: no, he&#39;d rather be hunting spiders). Ask that question about <i>everything</i>. Sometimes - often - the answer will be &#39;yes - he needs an illegitimate <s>son</s> <i>child</i> for the story to work&#39; (that&#39;s the ruler, not the elf). But sometimes it will be no... and that&#39;s when you ask the other question, &#39;would it work <i>better</i> if I did it the other way?&#39; I have one story I&#39;m completely rewriting from past-third-limited to present(?)-first-limited, because it&#39;s far more interesting if we&#39;re inside the protagonist&#39;s head.<br><br>But that goes both ways, of course. If the story won&#39;t be significantly improved by switching from past to present - then don&#39;t switch it, that&#39;s ridiculous. Write what you&#39;re comfortable with; the more you can leave on autopilot, the more you can think about the parts that matter.<br><br>But, just like <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9998481/1/Tenth-Walkers">Tenth Walkers</a>, don&#39;t claim a whole class of writing is bad. Frequently badly executed, maybe. Overused, probably. Very effective when done right? I guarantee it.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: &#39;But Mary-Sues--&#39; No, they&#39;re not a class of writing, they&#39;re a badly-designed character. &#39;Tenth Walker&#39; and &#39;Girl-falls-into-Middle-earth&#39; are the classes, and <i>they</i> can be done well. &#39;Bad character done well&#39; is an oxymoron. ~hS)</p>

            <p>Er... clearly your English educations in England far surpass the ones available to us in America. I had one of the best English and Grammar educations my mom could find and you kinda lost me at the beginning...<br><br>I have seen it done well, first-person present tense. Personally I prefer past tense when we&#39;re talking a particularly long piece. I&#39;m definitely prejudiced, though, as I have rather terrible memories of barely being able to struggle through <i>The Hunger Games</i> (I&#39;m not trying to stomp on anyone else&#39;s opinion, but I just don&#39;t think those were written that well.)<br><br>I do see what you mean with the suspense value, but that particular teacher was prejudiced against anything traditional, which included past tense, third person, and anything that didn&#39;t involve sex. I had to work very hard to defend Tolkien&#39;s poetry to her because it rhymed. This woman would probably condone a thirty-chapter novel written in second-person-conditional, just because it hadn&#39;t been done before (very often).<br><br>There are merits to almost any tense-person combination, I know. I&#39;ve definitely written more than one story in first person. Maybe I&#39;m narrow-minded, but I definitely prefer third-person past omniscient. It&#39;s just easiest to read and write for me, probably because that&#39;s how all the books I read growing up are written.<br><br>I - I have looked. I have never found a good Tenth Walker. Good Girl in Middle-earths? Sure. Good stories about OCs in the War of the Ring? Definitely. Tenth Walkers? Please do point me in the direction of any good ones you have found.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen lots of people say &quot;I&#39;ll read a Mary Sue if it&#39;s done well.&quot; I&#39;m not entirely sure what their criteria are for &quot;done well.&quot;<br><br>And mission reports are something I would probably definitely write in first person. In fact, I remember a book I once read and unfortunately no longer own. It was written in first person present tense from three different characters&#39; points of view in the frame tale of a mission report for some organization. So yeah, you&#39;re right. I&#39;m just complaining about people who think first-person present tense is the only way or the best way.</p>

            <p>As to &#39;I&#39;ll read a Mary Sue if it&#39;s done well&#39;, the difference isn&#39;t their criteria for &#39;done well&#39; - it&#39;s their criteria for &#39;Mary Sue&#39;. In the PPC, it&#39;s a well-defined term that specifically means &#39;a badly-written character&#39; - &#39;badly-written well-written&#39; is as oxymoronic as Aethelred Unraed. But a lot of people use the term to mean &#39;female OC&#39;, or &#39;female OC from Earth in a non-Earth continuum&#39;. They would define <i>any</i> girl-who-drops-into-Middle-earth as a Mary-Sue.<br><br>Which is their right, I suppose, but it&#39;s sloppy and leads to endless confusion. Since the term springs from an OC who was (deliberately) canon-warping in the extreme, extending it to characters who are careful <i>not</i> to ruin the canon seems like tarring them all with the same brush. I understand racial stereotyping is considered bad form these days...?<br><br>(&#39;But you&#39;re saying all Mary Sues--&#39; No, I&#39;m defining the term &#39;Mary Sue&#39; to mean something <i>which is badly written</i>. If a character has a bunch of characteristics which make it look like a Mary-Sue, but is well written, then <i>it isn&#39;t a Mary Sue</i>)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I actually like Mary Sue stories, but that&#39;s from a community where every trans-dimensional story is automatically a Sue or anti-Sue.  The Sues are the ones who live, the anti-Sues are the ones who die.  Sometimes they have extra powers, but mostly the one trait that brands them is that the vampires don&#39;t kill them.<br><br>I could even have fun reading a gravity-Sue story if it&#39;s done well.</p>

            <p>I would, however, like to point out that this poem is describing a state of being, not telling a story. Still, point taken.<br><br>And you&#39;re right. Most fanfic <i>is</i> rubbish. (I suspect that&#39;s partly because most fanfic is written by very lazy people, 9-13 year-olds, and/or pervy perv pervs of the stupid variety... or trolls.) Perhaps I&#39;ll take a look at your story at some point.<br><br>And I&#39;ve definitely tried to prove some things can be done well. I have a partly-finished Girl-in-Middle-earth that is not a Mary Sue on my computer. Every once in a while it strays dangerously close, though, or just gets stupid, so I have to completely rework parts.

            <p>That sounds like a challenge. Challenge accepted.<br><br><u>On Celebrian</u><br><br>If you had known then what you know now, you would not have let her go. You would have told her the mountains were too dangerous – insisted her guard was too small – promised her anything to keep her from making that trip. And she would have smiled at you, the way she smiled back then, and told you you were being foolish – that no orcs had been reported in the mountains for centuries.<br><br>But you would not have let her go. You would have appealed to her, pleaded with her, perhaps even threatened her. And at last she would have agreed, and unpacked her belongings, and stayed.<br><br>And things would have changed for you. No proof would ever have come of your suspicions – how could it, for she would not have gone, and there would have been no-one for the orcs to attack? – and so her claims of foolishness would have been repeated, their playful tone draining away until they stood as stark condemnation of you.<br><br>She would have left your bed, your house, and built her own, a lodge like Erendis of Westernesse once held, with only womenfolk permitted to enter. Your daughter would have followed her – and your sons become estranged from her, tortured by her bitterness. They would have turned to you, but you would have brought no comfort, for your heart would have been divided – hating her for her anger, hating yourself for causing it.<br><br>And so your family would have been broken, the women hiding away from the world, the men – your tall, proud sons – ranging away from your home for weeks, months, years at a time. You would have dared not ask what they sought, for you would have feared you already knew the answer: that they were delving into the deep places of the world, seeking the orcs that would prove your words had been true, and bring her back to you.<br><br>And then would have come the year, the decade, when they did not return, and no trace of them could be found beneath the sun. And you, proud and broken, would have gone to her door to tell her of their unknown fate. And you would have heard her speak, that voice that once sang to the stars at your side:<br><br>“I have no sons. I have no husband.”<br><br>And so, shattered beyond repair, you would have taken to your bed. And in your heart of hearts you would have made one wish, told one story, repeated one thought, made one promise:<br><br><i>If you had known then what you know now, you would have let her go.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>Dark, I know, but it was the first idea that came to mind. I see it as Galadriel consoling Elrond after Celebrian (who had been captured and wounded by orcs) sailed West to Valinor. Because Galadriel is a) a mind-reader, b) gifted with foresight, and c) not exactly all sweetness and light...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It wasn&#39;t intended as a challenge, but I&#39;m kind of glad you took it that way. I bow in submission to your superior mastery of the English language. That was definitely a story and it was definitely in second person conditional. (Although... what about this implied frame story where Galadriel is talking to Elrond? What&#39;s <i>that</i> in?

            <p>Or, rather, the really difficult one: girl-falls-into-Middle-earth-and-becomes-Tenth-Walker. I had an idea and felt like sketching it out.<br><br>It&#39;s Christmas 2001. Lucy (because why not Lucy? Actually, I&#39;d probably come up with a name that sounds like a valid Sindarin name, because it would lead to humour as she tries to explain that no, it&#39;s English...) has seen <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> three times already (and it&#39;s only been out a week!). Now her best friend has bought her the book it&#39;s based on. She&#39;s a slow reader, but that&#39;s okay - for this book, she&#39;ll make the effort. Even if it doesn&#39;t have (let&#39;s buck the Legoluster trend a little and say) Elijah Wood in it.<br><br>Then, due to unexpected and unexplained magic, Lucy is dragged into Middle-earth. In fact, she&#39;s dragged to Rivendell - though it doesn&#39;t look a lot like the film. Nor does the very tall and really kind of scary guy looming over her look much like Agent Elrond (she thought that was funny when her friend told her about it, but now - eek!).<br><br>She is, of course, totally unable to answer - or understand - and of Elrond&#39;s questions, but seeing as how she appeared in mid-air in the Hall of Fire, he&#39;s not inclined to do anything hasty about her (though, of course, she doesn&#39;t know this, and he <i>does</i> have scary eyebrows). And besides, there are other things on his mind... like the recent arrival of Mithrandir (have to stick to the Elvish to avoid translation issues, a la <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1690622/1/Don-t-Panic">Don&#39;t Panic!</a>, though fortunately <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Deep16.htm">I&#39;ve since solved the Gimli problem</a>), and his report that a certain Ring is on its way to Imladris...<br><br>So Lucy is given into the guardianship-and-care of... let&#39;s say Glorfindel and an OFC, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9998481/1/Tenth-Walkers">Lingalad</a>. Lingalad because a female prisoner-guest-mystery will probably respond better to a woman, and Glorfindel because as a Valinorean originally, he&#39;s had to learn at least three, probably more, languages (starting in Quenya, he would have learnt Sindarin in Beleriand, Adunaic in the Second Age, and Westron in the Third; he may also have learnt various Mannish tongues in any of those three); this makes him the best person in Imladris to try and figure out Lucy&#39;s words.<br><br>And so the time of Frodo&#39;s convalescence is taken up by Lucy learning very basic... Sindarin or Westron, probably the latter, since she&#39;s self-evidently human. And just as she&#39;s reached the point where she can at least make her needs and questions understood, and tell them very basically about herself (she&#39;s had to say she comes from &#39;above the sky&#39;, because she has <i>no</i> idea how to say &#39;another world&#39;), she discovers that the Fellowship (several members of whom have been concerned or at least curious about her, and she&#39;s gotten to thinking that Frodo - beg pardon, Maura - is actually pretty cute, even if he doesn&#39;t have Elijah&#39;s eyes) are about to leave.<br><br>And she&#39;s seen the film.<br><br>And she knows what&#39;s going to happen.<br><br>And she still has the book with her.<br><br>With rather a lot of help from Glorfindel - who&#39;s better at English than Lucy is at Westron - she manages to explain to Elrond what she&#39;s got - she can prove it by reading out some things there&#39;s no way she could know, like the precise words spoken in private conversations. And she tells him that Gandalf is going to die, and so is Boromir. And, she explains, she hasn&#39;t had a chance to read the rest yet...<br><br>This decision goes to Elrond&#39;s state of mind. I&#39;m inclined to say that, with the Ring Quest being the most important thing in the world right then, he&#39;ll send Lucy with the Fellowship rather than keeping her behind as a resource. He&#39;d love to know what&#39;s in the rest of the book - enemy movements, threats to allies? - but ultimately, if Imladris falls and the Ring is destroyed, he will consider that a victory. So he sends her along - and urges her to read fast.<br><br>The Fellowship avoid Moria, of course, given that Lucy knows already that Gandalf will die and Gollum will start to follow them (which in her mind is unambiguously bad - remember, she knows <i>nothing</i> about anything after the Breaking of the Fellowship!). I don&#39;t know what route they&#39;ll take - perhaps Boromir swings the idea of the Gap of Rohan, or Legolas convinces them to try the High Pass. And Lucy proves moderately helpful. Let&#39;s send them through Rohan, where she can warn them in advance that things are not as nice right now as Boromir would like to think - and she&#39;s bright enough to turn to the timeline for the major battles.<br><br>And then she reaches the point where Gandalf comes back as the White, and realises how badly she&#39;s messed things up.<br><br>~<br><br>Complicated? Yes (though the language lesson section can probably be glossed over - we know the Ring was in Imladris two months, that&#39;s enough time to assume the learning). It has to be - we&#39;re taking an implausible concept and trying to make it work. <i>Does</i> this version work? Well, that would depend on the writing - but I think it could.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t follow celebrities closely (too little advanced mathematics to hold my interest, I&#39;m afraid...), but I don&#39;t recall entities by the names of &quot;Kylie&quot; or &quot;Kendall&quot; doing anything particularly groanworthy, so I&#39;m coming into this with a completely open mind. The premise seems dull and the prose uninspiring, but the Space Gods know my first attempt at a novel was worse. If they want to do something productive with their lives, more power to them.</p>

            <p>Well, it caught my interest, anyway. Not bad writing, actually, and I&#39;m a pretty big fan of dystopian perfect societies. Sure, the &quot;I hate being so privileged and awesome&quot; thing is done to death, but I&#39;d imagine someone from that background would have a pretty dang accurate insight into how it feels living in the shadow of Very Important Relatives, because of whom you have more wealth than you could possibly need, and a status you did nothing to obtain and probably don&#39;t really want.<br><br>I&#39;m interested, anyway.</p>

            <p>What are the finer points of charging?  <br><br>I&#39;m going with plagiarism for annoying agents with read-throughs of scenes that the canon-savvy would know.  I&#39;m assuming descriptions written from visual media are just annoyances.<br><br>What about gloss-overs of the same?

            <p>1) This is actually a fine line. On one hand, you have the &quot;Voldemort looked like Voldemort from the movie&quot; style of writing where referencing source material is used as an unsuccessful crutch for beige prose, on the other you have ridiculous redundant description. As for the name, Herr Wozzek used &quot;plot regurgitation&quot; to describe it, although I for one am fond of saying &quot;If I wanted to hear about  I would just read/watch/play &quot;, which could be condensed into some comedically large acronym?<br><br>2) See above.<br><br>3) Yes and yes.<br><br>4) Heck yes.

I&#39;m going for charging one as both interfering with canon, and not interfering with canon when the precognition would have been useful.  The other is just copy-pasting the script without adding more than a line or two.  Another says &quot;the script happened,&quot; and then the insert twists the parts that aren&#39;t part of it.</p>

But then again, I&#39;m neither from Germany nor from Brazil, so I&#39;ve got no stake in this.<br><br>(Is Canada in the running somewhere? Does Canada even have a team?)<br><br>On the plus side, this is the summer I learned what FIFA is...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>This was a fun read, as the badfic features some of my biggest peeves about Potter romances.  (I won&#39;t turn this into a rant, but I&#39;m mainly referring to the whole &quot;magic bond&quot; thing, and also making a huge deal about the money Harry&#39;s parents left in Gringotts.  He&#39;s still a teenager, after all, and his &quot;wife&quot; already owns a house.  What does he need all that money for?)<br><br>Anyway.  I have to admit, I actually like Harry/Tonks, but only after Harry is older, so they&#39;re both adults.  Fourteen vs. nineteen is a bit too dramatic a gulf for me.  (There&#39;s a nineteen again.  I swear they&#39;re everywhere.)<br><br>Sorry.  I know I&#39;m discussing the fic more than your mission, but I think everyone else has beaten me to the interesting comments.  I am embarrassed to admit, I didn&#39;t get the joke about Luna seeing the agents until I read Nesh&#39;s comment below.  Now that I get it, I must recognize it as sheer brilliant genius!  I also like the research you put into it; I never would have recognized that Nundu thing as a canon monster, since it wasn&#39;t in the main series.<br><br>I agree that the easy swaying of Vilma/Mindy is the main weakness here.  Other than some odd phraseology, the original author actually had her pretty in character for an average house elf (at least in the lines you shared in the mission).  She would need a lot more convincing to abandon her masters, I think (although that logic bomb of Tonks not inheriting much is a good way to start).<br><br>I do like that you recruited not only the house elf, but Dogwig as well.  Despite being a flagrant blasphemy against existence, it doesn&#39;t really do anything too obnoxious.  It behaves just like a regular Potterverse owl--at super speed, but that could just be geo/time distortions--and didn&#39;t show particular loyalty to the replacements.  Good to see some restraint and pity where it belongs!  <s>but seriously has the author never heard an owl</s><br><br>One thing I was wondering about is when the agents interrupt a question from Mindy.  She never brings up whatever it was again.  I was expecting something terrible to happen later, and then see Mindy say, &quot;I was trying to ask about this . . .&quot;  but the line never payed off.  Was this something that got cut, or am I just paying too much attention to that exchange?<br><br>There&#39;s also a part where Rina has dialogue split into two separate paragraphs.  (Starting with &quot;<i>&#39;Putting my curiosity to know that aside,&#39;</i>&quot;)  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any real reason for those two paragraphs to be split up as they are; nothing happens in between, so why should Rina pause there?</p>

            <p>Yeah, looking at your and Nesh&#39;s comments and the mission, I agree Mindy&#39;s willingness to go with the agents a bit too convenient. I&#39;m working on that right now, just want to make sure I get it right. :)<br><br>And as for the Nundu... I&#39;m a huge HP nut, as you probably figured out. As soon as I read &#39;Arctic Nundu&#39;, I kind of exploded. And it just made sense in my head that Luna would have the feeling that the agents were there. </p>

            <p>Things I like:<br><br>The agents taking the mirrors too soon and having to put them back, and recruiting Mindy too soon.

Just... <i>ew</i>. Not to mention how ~*special*~ everything was. I&#39;m pleased that the ridiculous amounts of OOC and uncanon were addressed, and I fully sympathize with the agents&#39; nausea. (BTW, they might consider carrying some candied ginger around with them. Ginger is good for nausea.)<br><br>Things I am not sure about:<br><br>How come Mcgonagoll is a he? I think the minis tend to take on the gender of their namemistakes. Related: I always thought mini-Aragogs were approximately human-torso-sized. Big enough to haul fangirls away. I can&#39;t back that up, though. Has anyone read HFA recently?<br><br>What, <i>nobody</i> reacts to the Dursleys being randomly killed off by terrorists? I mean, sure, no one likes them much, but I still think the fact that no one reacts at all is deserving of comment.<br><br>Mindy seems to give up on her perceived masters a little too easily for the average house-elf. It&#39;s not something they can just choose to do even if they want to, and I&#39;m not sure merely explaining that she&#39;s in a bad story makes it not count. Also, who&#39;s she going to take care of in HQ? House-elves want masters, unless they&#39;re Dobby.<br><br>Typos:<br><br>* <i>ad nauseum</i> - Should be &quot;<i>ad <u>nauseam</u></i>&quot;.<br><br>* After biding Lupin farewell - Should be &quot;after <u>bidding</u> Lupin farewell&quot;.<br><br>* &quot;We is ABPDW, precious&quot; - Shouldn&#39;t that be &quot;We is <u>ABPWD</u>&quot;?

            <p>I&#39;ll go fix those right away. Maybe not the thing about Mindy being too easily released, since that one I&#39;ll need to think about... Anyway, I will say I got the idea to quote canon from Nume quoting LotR in &quot;Ring Child&quot;. Kudos to you. :D</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure when else that&#39;s been done recently, though I&#39;d be surprised if I was the first to think of it.<br><br>The scene where they first talk to Mindy reminds me a lot of how Jenni recruited Derik in &quot;Harry Potter and the Dragonriders of Pern,&quot; too, just because of the flow of it. The words are all yours, so I&#39;m fine with it. Nothing new under the sun, creativity is just learning how to hide your sources, etc. ^_~<br><br>I think the solution to Mindy is probably to have her show resistance, but still tag along with them anyway while she doesn&#39;t have duties in the story. The way she gets dragged back could show that she&#39;s still beholden to Lord and Lady Potter as well as still part of the fic, if you put in a few words to that effect and show her being conflicted about it. Then, once Lord and Lady are assassinated, she should be free, since they don&#39;t have any descendents (thank glod). However, she might feel obligated to protect them, so that&#39;s a potential snag.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who thinks &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;Lady&quot; are probably their first names by the end of the story.</p>
