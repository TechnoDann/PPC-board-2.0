            <p>Hello, I am 123bugsy&#39;s sister! As you may know, we are planning on doing this PPC thing together. So, here I am after such a long delay of being too lazy! (Sorry about that!)<br>I have read the PPC constitution, but I&#39;ve only glanced at the original stories at the moment. As for my fandoms, I have quite a few; Madoka Magica, Tokyo Mew Mew, Shugo Chara, Pokemon, Fire Emblem, Attack on Titan (SNK), and Harvest moon/Rune Factory, and probably some more, but these are my major fandoms.<br>Well, I am very happy to do this, and I am very excited to do my first mission with my older sister as soon as we get permission. Hope none of this sounds silly! Thanks for your time :&gt; </p>

            <p>I&#39;m learning it in the process of redesigning <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/">my website</a> (it needs it, right?), and one of the things I really want is a good navbar. I&#39;ve found tutorials for making a CSS navbar (<a href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/02/creating-a-pure-css-dropdown-menu/">here</a> and <a href="http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pure-css-dropdown-menu">here</a>; most of the others I&#39;ve looked at are variations on the latter), and although both demos work in my browser (Firefox), neither method works when I try to implement it in my own files, and I have no idea why. The appearance styling works great, but the submenus will not appear when I hover over the main menu. Even when I isolate the navbar code in its own .css and .html Notepad docs, nada, so I don&#39;t think my own CSS is at fault. I&#39;m beginning to wonder if there&#39;s some sort of conspiracy to leave out a crucial element so noobs like me can&#39;t just grab the code and use it without fully understanding it. {= P<br><br>I&#39;d love for someone experienced to take a look and see if they can tell what&#39;s going wrong. If you can help, please leave your e-mail address, and I&#39;ll send you my Notepad files.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Although, I assume at least one of the writers needs to have Permission...? I think? You definitely don&#39;t need Permission if you&#39;re co-writing with someone who has it, though, that I remember quite clearly.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>It&#39;s also a good idea for the person with Permission to have had it awhile and actually used it, since the whole point is that the newer person can learn things by working with someone who knows what they&#39;re doing. Plus, it&#39;s already kinda-sorta cheating, and it would <i>really</i> be cheating if a newbie got Permission just to sneak in their friend(s).<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Specifically, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission#Some%20Frequently%20Asked%20Questions">this</a> is the FAQ on Permission. Generally speaking--as it says there, and as Boarders tend to repeatedly say--we like it if newbies hang around for about a month*, and are active on the Board during that time--joining discussions, maybe starting a thread or two, and talking about things other than Permission--before actually submitting a request. We like to know who you are; we like to be able to see your username and think, oh, hey, that&#39;s the one who&#39;s into the Hunger Games but hates Peeta&#39;s storyline and had that awesome theory on how Sherlock survived his fall! Also, speaking from experience, it helps to start coming up with your agents...and then spend a lot of time developing them before you actually present them for approval. (By developing, I mean brainstorming, thinking about how they&#39;d react in various situations, even writing some backstory for them--anything but writing a real mission, honestly, as that&#39;s why you need Permission in the first place). Trust me--you and your agents will both benefit from the time you spend together.<br><br>But yeah--basically, hang around for a bit, chat, get to know us, develop your potential agents--feel free to ask questions about anything you&#39;re unsure of, we&#39;re happy to advise--and then, when you feel ready, put together your Permission request (writing sample, agent bios, and a badfic or two that you&#39;d like to take down), preferably show it to a beta or two, and then post it.<br><br>Aaand, now that I&#39;ve really made myself feel like an oldbie and a fixture--take a look at the wiki article, because it&#39;s a, more detailed, and b, probably a little easier to understand/more comprehensive.<br><br>Best of luck! And, um, welcome...not sure I ever welcomed you. Please accept these Gummyblee Pens and Spaceships as a Welcome Gift...<br><br>~DF<br><br>--<br>*One month is basically there as a kind of standard waiting period--in reality, it varies a little by person: some may ask after three weeks, some after a year--but it&#39;s there so that people don&#39;t come, hang out for a day or so, and then ask for Permission. As I said--or will say, depending on when you decided to read this footnote--we like to actually get to know you a little before dealing with a Permission request.</p>

            <p>About the &quot;one month&quot; thing, I mean. I know that because I specifically didn&#39;t put it in when I rewrote the article. (Also, I just did a Ctrl+f search for the word &quot;month&quot; to be sure someone hadn&#39;t gone and changed it on me.) The thing is, we noticed years ago that telling people there was a one-month waiting period often made them think they <i>had</i> to ask for Permission exactly one month after joining whether they were ready or not; or else that they were <i>guaranteed</i> to get Permission one month from the date of their first post whether they&#39;d done anything else to warrant it or not; and those were bad things that we Did Not Want. So, we stopped telling people that. Or tried to stop, anyway....<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I have wonderful news! On this day, precisely one year ago (I think I&#39;m off by an hour or so, but I was in a different time zone then), I made my introductory post on the Board! (presented <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=236644;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a> for proof and possible hilarity). That&#39;s right, folks--I&#39;ve been a Boarder for one year! Can you believe it? I sure can&#39;t. It feels like it&#39;s only been one month, or three, or seven...but, wow, I&#39;ve been here for twelve. Let&#39;s throw a party, yeah? I feel like throwing a party. (Anyone else&#39;s Board anniversary coming up? I know there were a lot of newbies not too long after I joined...anyone else still here? If so, let&#39;s make it a joint party!)<br><br>One full year. Wow. Thank you so much, everyone; you&#39;ve made it an amazing year, and a very interesting and...what&#39;s the word, fulfilling? We&#39;ll go with that. A very fulfilling year. *goes into speech mode* I&#39;ve made friends, learned more about writing, and been astonished and excited by how much the PPC is still thriving...yeah, it&#39;s been a great year :) Thanks for being part of it! (Andforputtingupwithmeandmycrazyideasokaypartytimenow*throws confetti(1)*)<br><br>--<br>(1) By confetti I do mean both the almond type and the paper type.<br>--<br><br>Now, on another note...I&#39;m trying to name a character. Well, actually, I&#39;m trying to translate one of her names from Quenya to Sindarin. The problem? The name I&#39;m trying to translate is Laurëandil (&quot;golden lover/friend&quot;). It&#39;s an epessë given to her by her husband (she&#39;s Noldorin, by the way. I&#39;m not yet sure about her husband). I want a Sindarin equivalent (although I doubt it&#39;ll ever really be used), but...Sindarin doesn&#39;t technically have the -(n)dil ending, which leaves me with &quot;Glor__<em>???&quot; as a translation. According to Merin Essi Ar Quentili (aka realelvish.net), however, Exilic Sindarin would often just take things like the endings -(n)dil and -(n)dur and place them, post-&#39;Sindarinization&#39;, at the ends of names (see &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://www.realelvish.net/exilic">http://www.realelvish.net/exilic</a></em>names.php&quot;&gt;here</a> for reference). As my character is a Noldorin Elf from the First Age, that then leaves me with the option of using &quot;Glor (glaur) + -(n)dil&quot;...but how does one mesh that? Glorandil? Glorendil? Glorndil? ...Glordil?<br><br>Basically, could someone with a grasp of Elvish naming rules help me figure out exactly how that works? I&#39;m now feeling like Glordil may be the most correct option...but is it? <i>Help</i>.<br><br>My apologies to anyone uninterested in Elvish names who just read through that. Here, have a cookie as reparation. To anyone who was interested in that, wonderful! Have a cookie as well. In fact, here, I&#39;m putting out a basket of cookies. Everyone take one (or several; it refills). Enjoy!<br><br>And I think that&#39;s all. Happy Anniversary to everyone to whom that applies, and thanks for listening! (and please help...)<br><br>~DF<br></p>

            <p>One of the keys to using the Eldarin languages is <i>feel</i>, and &#39;Glordil&#39; feels horrible. It feels like an orc&#39;s name (&#39;Glordil laughed his horrible laugh. &#39;No, elf,&#39; he snarled, &#39;there will be no escape for you&#39;).<br><br>I&#39;m assuming, based on your description, that Laurëandil is the original form of the name. When the Noldor came over, they didn&#39;t really know Sindarin - as a result, a lot of their &#39;translated&#39; names are just &#39;soundalikes&#39;. By that method, you could have a name like Lothendil/Lossendil.<br><br>But let&#39;s say she and her husband bother to learn a little of the local language before translating her nickname. You&#39;re right to use the &#39;Glor-&#39; words for &#39;gold&#39; - they have the same root as &#39;laurë&#39;. The Ardalambion Sindarin wordlist gives these entries:<br><br>GOLD (as metal) 1) malad (i valad), pl. melaid (i melaid) if there is a pl. 2) malt (i valt), pl. melt (i melt) if there is a pl. (VT42:27). ”Gold” in extended senses: glawar (i ’lawar) (sunlight, radiance of the Golden Tree Laurelin), pl. glewair (in glewair) (VT41:10) GOLD (COLOUR?) *mall (i vall), pl. mail (i mail) if there is a pl. – Suggested Sindarin form of ”Noldorin” malt.<br><br>GOLDEN 1) (of gold) malthen (melthin- in compounds; lenited valthen; pl. melthin), 2) (shining with golden light) glóren (glórin-), lenited ’lóren; pl. glórin, 3) mallen (lenited vallen; pl. mellin).<br><br>GOLDEN LIGHT glaur (i ’laur), pl. gloer (in gloer)<br><br>I can see three useful words there: glawar (sunlight, or the light of Laurelin - use if she was named after the Tree), glóren (glowing like gold), and your choice of glaur (golden light), which clearly turns into Glor if you happen to be, say, Glorfindel.<br><br>As you noted, -(n)dil (and the related -(n)dur) show up in Sindarin names all the time - Elendil springs to mind - and that seems to be a Noldorin habit. So you can certainly use that.<br><br>That gives three names: Glawardil, Glorendil, and Glaurdil/Glordil. As I say, the last should be avoided entirely. Glorendil works fine, and sounds a lot like her Quenya version. Glawardil - or, potentially, Glardil - would also work, but doesn&#39;t sound quite as nice, at least to me.<br><br>If you wanted to go full-on translation...<br><br>FRIEND 1) (masc.) mellon (i vellon) (lover), pl. mellyn (i mellyn), coll. pl. mellonnath. Also meldir (i veldir), no distinct pl. form except with article (i meldir). Also seron (i heron, o seron), pl. seryn (i seryn), coll. pl. seronnath. 2) (fem.) meldis (i veldis), no distinct pl. form except with article (i meldis), coll. pl. meldissath.<br><br>FRIENDLY milui (lenited vilui; no distinct pl. form) (loving, kind)<br><br>FRIENDSHIP gwend (i ’wend, construct gwen) (bond), pl. gwind (in gwind), coll. pl. gwennath. Note: a homophone means ”maiden”.<br><br>That gives meldis (female friend), milui (loving, as an adjective), and gwen (friendship). Glorwen is a possible - it uses the common -wen (maiden) ending as its homophone. Gloremilui has an interesting sound, though terminal vowels aren&#39;t very common in Sindarin. Gloremeldis (Golden Friend) is probably your best literal translation with the &#39;friend&#39; interpretation.<br><br>And one final entry:<br><br>LOVE (noun) meleth (i veleth), pl. melith (i melith)<br><br>LOVE (vb.) mela- (i vela, i melar), pa.t. melant (VT45:34)<br><br>LOVE mîl (i vîl) (affection, kindness), no distinct form in pl. except with article (i mîl), coll. pl. míliath<br><br>LOVER 1) (fem.) melethril (i velethril), no distinct pl. form except with article (i melethril), coll. pl. melethrillath. 2) (masc.) melethron (i velethron), pl. melethryn (i melethryn), coll. pl. melethronnath. Also (when lover = ”friend”)  mellon (i vellon), pl. mellyn (i mellyn). Coll. pl. mellonnath.<br><br>LOVING milui (lenited vilui; no distinct pl. form) (friendly, kind)<br><br>We&#39;ve already seen &#39;milui&#39;, of course, so other than that we have &#39;melethril&#39; (lover), &#39;meleth&#39; (love, as a noun; I think that&#39;s &#39;my love&#39;), &#39;mîl&#39; (noun again, = affection). Melethril is way too long (Gloremelethril), but could be contracted as &#39;Gloremethril&#39; if you liked the sound. &#39;Gloremil&#39; is a possible, but I think it&#39;s too heavy on the &#39;o&#39; sound. &#39;Glormeleth&#39; is also an option.<br><br>My final list of possible names, then, in no particular order:<br><br>Glawardil<br>Glorendil<br>Glorwen<br>Gloremilui<br>Gloremeldis<br>Gloremethril<br>Gloremil<br>Glormeleth<br><br>Oh, and I&#39;ve just noticed:<br><br>Glaurwen<br>Glaurmeleth<br>Glawarwen<br><br>In fact, you could probably heavily contract &#39;glawar&#39; down to &#39;gla&#39;, and replace &#39;glore&#39; with it in most of the above. That gives things like:<br><br>Glamilui<br>Glameldis<br>Glamethril<br><br>Those sound rather Welsh to my ear, actually, like relations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawain">Gwalchmai</a>.<br><br>Anyway: any of those names are valid in Sindarin. &#39;Glorendil&#39; is probably the most natural for your characters to come up with, but if you prefer the sound of one of the others - that&#39;s how Elves work!<br><br>Also: really? Only one year? Strewth.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hi there! <br>As the title says, I&#39;m new here. I found out about the PPC back in November 2013, when I was strolling though fanlore.org. At the time, I had just started my own fanfiction, and, as I now know, it was pure badfic. OOC characters and bad male slash, as well as angst paired with hurt/comfort in the worst way possible. Not that that would have occurred to me at that time, but as I read more about the properties of badfic on the wiki (and the ensuing fit of insecurity) I finally admitted to myself that I had written badfic. <br><br>That fanfiction now rests in pieces in data heaven (or, for that matter, hell). <br>So first of all thanks (I guess...) for making me notice the error of my ways before more harm could be done.<br><br>But that&#39;s the past. What counts is now! (Right?) <br>In preparation of this post I have read TOS, Origins, the handbook, the FAQs, the constitution and more wiki pages than I could count (but at least 100). <br>My fandoms are Harry Potter, Pitch Perfect, all books by John Green (except Let it snow, haven&#39;t read that one yet), the Hunger Games and the Inheritance Cycle. As for the latter, I now (after reading Kippurs sporkings) acknowledge that the story is majorly flawed, but I still enjoyed the books when I read them for the first time.<br><br>As an utter newbie, I have two questions: <br>1. Why do Jay and Acacia ask for a raise when they don&#39;t have the time to spend money between missions anyway? <br>2. How do flowers move? (move as in walk from one place to another) <br><br>Thanks in advance for answering! *gives out cookies* <br><br>PS: If my username is too similar to that of someone else, please let me know. <br>PPS: I know my way around HTML/CSS quite well, so if Neshomeh still needs help with her Navbar, I&#39;d love to take a look at it.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think your user name is too similar, no. If it invoked cats in any way, then we might have a problem, but as it stands, I doubt you&#39;ll confuse anyone. (preparing to be proven wrong in 3... 2...)<br><br>Seriously, though, welcome to the Board! Have an electric trident! Electric as in it shoots lightning from the tips, not as in it needs batteries. It&#39;s powered entirely by ill-defined magical energy, so you won&#39;t need to worry about charging it.<br><br>And to answer your questions:<br>1) Agents like to gripe about things. It helps get out some of the frustration that they feel after watching badfic mangle their favorite fictional worlds, which isn&#39;t always dispelled when a Sue gets a sword through the chest. Talking about getting raises and complaining that there&#39;s barely any time between missions any more are common manifestations of that. They&#39;re exaggerating about the lack of time, by the way. There&#39;s plenty of time between missions, as evidenced by the massive number of between-mission interludes that have been written over the years. It&#39;s just that the console could go off at any moment, so a lot of Agents don&#39;t feel that there&#39;s much chance to do anything.<br>As for the actual purpose of the money, I don&#39;t think anyone is entirely sure, but it might not be out of the question that the money could be used to purchase things at HQ&#39;s internal businesses, such as the Supply Depot or Rudi&#39;s Pub, or to purchase things from within the various continua that the Agents travel to. I doubt the Agents would ever have too high a need for the latter unless they were stranded there or something, though. Ailavyn Siniyash&#39;s idea about the Cafeteria once dispensing good food for money may be true as well. It sounds like something they&#39;d do.<br><br>2) It&#39;s not really something that anyone tends to consider, usually, since there are a few dozen different species of Flowers and they all have their own individual ways of performing most tasks, moving around not being an exception. I&#39;m pretty sure that a large potion of them drag themselves around on their roots or pull themselves forward with fronds, but there are some that don&#39;t have any appendages to speak of, or those that are simply too large to make doing so practical, plus individual personality quirks that might affect their choices. Maybe some would find pulling themselves across the floor demeaning, or some would prefer alternative options to the obvious ones. Knowing how the Flowers can get, I expect that at least a few push themselves around on some sort of skateboard/wheelchair contraption because wheels can go down long hallways faster, or even self-levitate with their psychic powers. I think that the Bracket Fungus could self-levitate, but admittedly I&#39;m not entirely certain where I&#39;m remembering that from.</p>

            <p>Not really, anyway. I know how most of what the setting works, largely by cultural osmosis, but I&#39;ve never read the books and I only saw one movie.

I&#39;m pretty sure he knows the canon, since I remember him mentioning that he was planning on writing a Hunger Games mission for his Floaters during one of his post-mission author&#39;s notes.

            <p>You actually managed to read through both those train wreck?<br><br>*claps*<br><br>I applaud you, good sir. I&#39;ve snarked both those fics at one point (Subject 23 was a PPC mission and Parallel Realities was my first snarking with the Library of the Damned), and I know how both these fics were.<br><br>For me, though, I&#39;d have to say that Subject 23 would probably win the fight. Actually, I&#39;d say that I <i>want</i> Subject 23 to win, really. Thing is, Subject 23 is a psychopath and he&#39;s whiny and the things he does to Miranda&#39;s character are completely horrible, but at least he doesn&#39;t take over the whole galaxy at the end the way Stupard does.<br><br>And I think Subject 23 probably would win anyway, so there&#39;s that. He&#39;s basically just an X-Men character transplanted into the Mass Effect universe, so that gives him an edge against Stupard. On top of that, Subject 23&#39;s abilities allow him to keep some distance with Stupard, so that would probably help a lot as well.</p>

            <p>Subject 23&#39;s Powers are basically a combination of the powers of Iceman and Wash-out, so I doubt it was meant to invoke X-23. Couple that with the fact that the fic as a whole ends up becoming disgustingly sexist at various points (it turns Tali into a love-obsessed bimbo and then turns FemShep into a horny lady who obsesses about how she hasn&#39;t gotten laid despite the fact that, you know, she&#39;s busy fighting the Collectors and all that), and I very much doubt he&#39;s going for an X-23 rip-off.</p>

            <p>No matter what, though, I can say this: Parallel Realities is still <i>far</i> worse than Subject 23. Subject 23 at least had the dignity to attempt something new, even if it did a terrible job.

            <p>Hey everybody. I recently claimed a particularly nasty-looking Sith!Stufic (Here, because HTML didn&#39;t work: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6696781/1/Destiny-of-the-Sith"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6696781/1/Destiny-of-the-Sith">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6696781/1/Destiny-of-the-Sith</a></a>) set in an AU a bit before the outbreak of the Clone Wars and the events of the 2008-2013 cartoon. I&#39;ve been able to put together most of a charge list just flipping through the fic briefly, and know most of what&#39;s up where, but I&#39;m having difficulty determining if the character of Ahsoka Tano is replaced outright or just severely OOC, though given the content of this fic I&#39;m unsure if in the latter case I can get away with a neuralysation or if FicPsych/Medical would need to get involved. <br><br>Anyway, the work she&#39;s from is a part of Star Wars I&#39;m wholly unfamiliar with, though I&#39;m looking it and her up more, so I just wondered if anyone here knew enough about the canon character already to help with figuring that out. Sorry for the bother, hope everyone&#39;s 2014 is going well so far.</p>

            <p>I actually found that kind of baffling - he mashes together the Galactic War era and Clone Wars era with nary a thought as to how to make it make any sense, and I don&#39;t get why he treats TOR character classes like they&#39;re an actual thing in-setting. Fun fact, &quot;true Sith&quot; also means the actual Sith species, and this Stu (from what little description there is) seems to be a generic human. Thanks for the help with Ahsoka though - I could tell she pretty quickly went down the path of a character replacement, but I&#39;m going to have to kill that fic early to avoid the whole &quot;the Stu literally has an army of Sith at his beck and call&quot; thing so I wanted to see if there was anything recognisable in the early bits of the fic. <br><br>(Don&#39;t Sith have training lightsabers that briefly paralyse you?

And it looks like the changes are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.<br><br>We can&#39;t do anything about that. Of course we can&#39;t - it would be against all the rules of the PPC, and probably several of the Laws of Time to boot. But what we <i>can</i> do - what we <i>should be</i> doing - is protect our own interests. Apart from the Doctor, we are the <i>only</i> Time Lords who have been continuously &#39;alive&#39;. And that gives us a responsibility.<br><br>I propose the establishment, here in HQ, of the Continuity Council of Gallifrey. We&#39;ve had the High Council - we&#39;ve had the War Council - I think we need a Council to watch over the plot. And the only Time Lords who know about the plot continuum are right here in HQ. Funny how that works out.<br><br>I suggest the establishment of the following posts:<br><br>Ruby Shipwright - Responsible for monitoring the TARDISes of HQ and ensuring that they are not mistreated, nor used to violate the Laws of Time.<br><br><i>&quot;From the first, the TARDISes have been the mark of the Time Lords. The Shipwright looks after their wellbeing.&quot;</i><br><br>Tigereye Castellan - Responsible for the security and personal safety of the Continuity Council of Gallifrey.<br><br><i>&quot;The Castellan stands at the heart of the fire, guarding all others from its consuming flame.&quot;</i><br><br>Topaz Monitor - Responsible for coordinating assignments from the Continuity Council, and ensuring communications between its members.<br><br><i>&quot;Like the sun over Gallifrey, the Monitor sees all, and guides the Council&#39;s actions.&quot;</i><br><br>Jade Warden - Responsible for monitoring the timelines of the Home Universe and ensuring that the Laws of Time are not violated, except in the service of the plot.<br><br><i>&quot;Balanced between past and future, the Warden protects the timelines from harm.&quot;</i><br><br>Sapphire Watcher - Responsible for monitoring the <i>Doctor Who</i> TV series and reporting any updates on Gallifrey to the Council.<br><br><i>&quot;No-one knows what the future will bring, but the Watcher is the first to discover its secrets.&quot;</i><br><br>Amethyst Keeper - Responsible for squaring information on Gallifrey from other media with the TV canon.<br><br><i>&quot;The crystalline purity of a unified timeline will one day be realised - that is the Keeper&#39;s quest.&quot;</i><br><br>In addition, one of the Councillors should be elected Lord (or Lady) Chairman (or woman) (whatever our personal opinions may be of  Rassilon, we don&#39;t have the right to appoint a &#39;president&#39;); the Chair is not defined by a single colour, but by an iridescent or opalescent mix of them all. Given the scarcity of Time Lords in these parts, the Chair will probably have to double up on roles.<br><br>I myself intend to take the position of Tigereye Castellan; it&#39;s relevant to my interests, as it were, and I am pretty handy with a gun. The other positions, I suggest, should be on a first-come, first-served basis.<br><br>Silly collars are required, of course.<br><br>Morgan<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Okay. This is partially setup for a plot I&#39;m planning down the road, but mostly just that I think it&#39;s something Morgan would do - and something that would spice up the Time Lord element of the PPC.<br><br>In practical terms, your Time Lord agents don&#39;t have to change anything in how they&#39;re written - you can just assume it&#39;s being done off-screen. Or, you can have them given assignments by the Topaz Monitor, and make it an integral part of their character.<br><br>I <i>think</i> we have six or seven Time Lords in HQ. I&#39;m sure about Morgan (obviously), the Agent, the Disentangler, and the Fisherman - and the Librarian, though I don&#39;t think he&#39;s done anything yet. I&#39;m not sure about Natalie Green (who may be retired, and would she even count, being a disguise-induced Time Lord?), or the Reader, who appears only on the &#39;Time Lord&#39; talk page, so far as I can tell (can&#39;t check the Wiki properly from work). I <b>hope</b> we have at least six, because the &#39;jewelled rainbow&#39; theme is quite nice; we could certainly add other colours, such as white and black, if needed.<br><br>Anyway: if you&#39;re interested in your agent being on the Continuity Council (and I hope you are!), you get to choose which role you want. If you like, you can tweak the title and gemstone; you can even swap colours with another position if you want (and I&#39;ll rewrite the descriptions to fit).<br><br>And yes, silly collars <i>are</i> required - and I intend to make an image of the full Council to show them off. Hopefully I can manage it...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I was going to say I didn&#39;t think Morgan even knew she existed, but then I thought they might have met in the Blackout, but <i>then</i> I realised that the &#39;extra&#39; scene where Morgan introduces the Doctor to the Disentangler, Agent and Fisherman implies that she <i>doesn&#39;t</i> know her.<br><br>So I&#39;m going to assume the Reader found out in Some Other Way, and just walked in to talk to Morgan.

            <p>And for my own Blackout Interlude, at that. Suffice it to say that it&#39;s entirely plausible that Morgan wouldn&#39;t know the Reader at the time of the Blackout, and that I&#39;m quite willing for the Reader to have been informed of the Continuity Council via a fellow Time Lord somehow recognizing her as a fellow member of the species and accosting her in the hallway. That fits with what I&#39;ve ended up writing as a mission intro (wherein there is Time Lord Angst, due to Council-related matters), which basically amounts to someone reminding her of the small number of Gallifreyan Time Lords in HQ and the need for everyone to participate if at all possible. I&#39;m fine with either someone informing Morgan of the extra Time Lady and Morgan tracking her down, or someone obtaining the paper on the position from Morgan and tracking down the Reader themselves. I&#39;ve no idea who this someone would be (and don&#39;t think it necessarily matters all that much). Worst comes to worst, Agent Dawn can act as messenger.<br><br>...actually, if you&#39;re thinking of writing the scene--I can either summarize or actually send you what I wrote on the topic. Just so we&#39;ve got our facts straight and don&#39;t end up with two wildly different versions...although, y&#39;never know, with Time Lords...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Well played.<br><br>---<br><br>Notary [clearly relishing the infighting a little bit]: A-<i>hem</i>. If it please the Council, I have composed a short preliminary constitution for our dealings. Item one: The Continuity Council of Gallifrey-in-Exile (hereafter referred to as the Council or Continuity Council) stands for the...<br><br>[QUITE A WHILE LATER]<br><br>Notary [smug as a well-fed cat with a secret it&#39;s about to sell to the press]: ... and furthermore, to clarify our position as guardians of Gallifreyan heritage in a changing, chaotic multiverse. Any questions?<br><br>Reader: ... is it over?<br><br>Disentangler: How is it possible for a single person to contain that much legalese?<br><br>Morgan: Do you just not need to <i>breathe</i> or something? How can you exist without breathing?<br><br>Notary: I was primarily concerned with your comprehension of the preliminary constitution, but if you wish to behave like the gang of slovenly renegades you are, perhaps I need to express myself more clearly-<br><br>Disentangler: Morgan, you&#39;ve set her off again!<br><br>Fisherman [jamming his fingers in his ears and burrowing under the table]: If I can&#39;t hear it, it&#39;s not really happening, if I can&#39;t hear it, it&#39;s not really happening...<br><br>Morgan: Ugh. Notary. For the love of... whatever you hold dear, I don&#39;t know, well-organized filing systems or something, just shut up. Please.<br><br>Notary: Why, of all the - I&#39;ve never been so insulted!<br><br>Morgan: Only &#39;cause you weren&#39;t paying attention, now shut. Up.<br><br>Notary: Feh. I don&#39;t know why I expected better from you and the rest of these exiled miscegenators. Oh, if only Rassilon could see what his people are reduced to-<br><br>Reader: Yeah, sure! If Rassilon was here, everything&#39;d be A-okay! Just so long as we, you know, tried to destroy the universe and all of reality! Oh, and behaved like good little thought-slaves, can&#39;t forget that!<br><br>Notary: Our Lord President was doing what he thought best for the Time Lords and for Gallifrey, as was his right-<br><br>Reader: His <i>RIGHT</i>? Morgan, where didja dig this one up, I want it carpet bombed-<br><br>Morgan [screaming herself hoarse]: <i>ENOUGH!</i><br><br>[The room falls silent.]<br><br>Morgan [much quieter now]: Enough. Especially you, Notary. Just sit down. This isn&#39;t going to be like the High Council. Nobody here is Rassilon. Nobody here is above another. We are just trying to do what&#39;s right for Gallifrey and for the plot of our home. Remember that? Good. Now then... thank you for your proposals, Spinel Promotor, I&#39;ll bear them in mind when we draft our constitution. <i>All of us. Together.</i> All in favour?<br><br>[Everyone raises their hands, even the Notary, albeit with a hint of bad grace about it.]<br><br>Morgan: Good. Now. Who&#39;s got something to talk about <i>who isn&#39;t the Notary do I have to duct-tape your mouth shut or something?</i><br><br>Notary: Are your particular preferences really suitable for airing at a solemn gather-<br><br>Morgan: AUGH!<br><br>Reader: I&#39;ve got something to say.<br><br>Morgan: Alright, you have the floor. [to herself] Deep breaths, Morgan, deep breaths...<br><br>Reader: Are you sure there&#39;s nobody above another in this room? Because you seem to be railroading us quite a bit, and that&#39;s how it all started-<br><br>[Morgan&#39;s collar switches off as her head bounces repeatedly off the table.]<br><br>Fisherman: ... Uh, Morgan? Can I come out now?<br><br>---<br><br>I trust that was acceptable. =]</p>

Can we make some sense now?<br><br>Notary: You&#39;re one to talk about making sense.<br><br>Agent: Didn&#39;t you use a rubber chicken to stabilise a dysfunctional reality?<br><br>Fisherman: Didn&#39;t you use <em>Avada Kedavra</em> on the spirit of a building?

            <p>I wonder what&#39;d happen if the Doctor happened upon this meeting?<br><br>---<br><br>Agent: Uh, yeah, I&#39;ve got something.

Whatcha got?<br><br>Notary: Castellan, the correct form of address is-<br><br>Morgan [with a smile... or at least showing her teeth, which counts, right?]: Item the second: motion to use Council petty cash fund for electrical tape to shut the Notary up.

Agent, continue where ya left off. [with a snide glance at the Notary] Whatcha got?<br><br>Agent [ignoring the Notary&#39;s rolled eyes]: Well, uh, you said part of my brief&#39;s other media, right? So, with the Night Of The Doctor prequel making Big Finish&#39;s Eighth Doctor adventures canon... do I have to listen to all of them, or is that the Disentangler&#39;s wheelhouse?<br><br>Morgan: ... Huh. That&#39;s actually a good point. Err&#39;body?<br><br>Disentangler [pretty much instantly]: He can do it.<br><br>Agent: Hey!<br><br>Fisherman: I&#39;m not sure. I mean, my first instinct would be it&#39;s the Agent&#39;s job, but...<br><br>Librarian: I mean, from what I understand of all this I guess it&#39;d technically be the Agent&#39;s job?<br><br>Morgan: Oh, for the love of all that&#39;s holy, don&#39;t bring up technicalities around <i>that one</i>. [She jabs a thumb at the Notary, who grumbles to herself]<br><br>Notary: I beg your pardon?<br><br>Disentangler: Hey, d&#39;you reckon if you say &quot;Incorrectly Completed Tax Return&quot; three times in front of a bathroom mirror with the lights off, the Notary&#39;ll appear behind you?<br><br>Notary: Tigereye Castellan, I really must protest! This is entirely unnecessary-<br><br>Morgan: Nuh-uh. That legal mumbo-jumbo that came outta your face like a busted dam, <i>that</i> was unnecessary. Calling us exiles like we were war criminals or something was unnecessary. This? Entirely justified. The council does not recognise your complaints.<br><br>Notary: Well! [She sits back down heavily and harrumphs in peace]<br><br>Reader: Why did we let her in again?<br><br>Morgan: Because everyone else here hates paperwork, and I think she gets high from folder fumes. Getting back to the topic at hand, though... we should vote. Those in favour of giving the audio drama adventures to the Sapphire Watcher rather than the Amethyst Keeper?<br><br>[Three hands raise]<br><br>Morgan: And those against?<br><br>[Four hands raise, including Morgan&#39;s]<br><br>Morgan: Motion is passed. Hey, look, we did something, guys! We actually made a decision! Was that so hard?<br><br>[The Notary motions to speak, but thinks better of it.]<br><br>Morgan: And the Notary&#39;s learning too. This might not be so bad after all!<br><br>Reader: That patronising attitude... that&#39;s where it all began, you know-<br><br>Fisherman: Didn&#39;t you say it was railroading people that was where it all started?<br><br>Reader: What, you want to go back to how Lord President Rassilon would&#39;ve run it?<br><br>Notary: Is there something wrong with that? The Lord President was a charismatic leader in a time of incredible conflict!<br><br>Reader: Yeah, you side with the lunatic monomaniac, Notary! Go you! There&#39;s a gold star over there!<br><br>Morgan [resignedly]: ... Then again, it might not be worth it in the slightest.<br><br>---<br><br>We&#39;re cruel to these people, we really are.</p>

The Dalek Fearn, who in his pace-like rolling about had unfortunately moved between the Tigereye Castellan spot on the table and the still-open door once every twenty-eight seconds, is propelled through the opening, not stopping until he hits the opposing wall with a thump. Triumphantly, Morgan stands up from her chair, places a faintly crackling apparatus on the table in front of her, walks over to the door, and loudly closes it.)<br><br>Morgan: Consider the Continuity Council defended.

It was originally going to be a summary of how they would all react as a group, but then it turned into just Fearn, and then into a little script like the others in this chain. I hope it lives up to the standard of everyone else&#39;s! If it doesn&#39;t, I suppose you could all pretend it doesn&#39;t exist, since it is sort of off-topic to begin with.)</p>

Who are you lot then?<br><br>11th Doctor: I remember, it&#39;s the Northern one - hello there! Wow... I&#39;d almost forgotten about the ears, those are quite something.<br><br>Reader: Er, Morgan - I think we might have found our first official item of business, because I&#39;m pretty sure what&#39;s happening right now can&#39;t actually happen.</p>

There&#39;s a lot you can&#39;t know. There&#39;s a lot you have to do before you can get to where I am.<br><br>9th Doctor: Does that include getting my dress sense erased?<br><br>11th Doctor: Hey, bow ties are cool - doesn&#39;t matter. The point is, the actual pointiest point of it is, that... well, not everything stays dead. You can&#39;t know how I know that until you&#39;re standing here on my side of the room.<br><br>9th Doctor: Heh.<br><br>Disentangler: Uh, did I miss the funny part?<br><br>9th Doctor [smiling wide, but with the anger of a god behind his eyes]: Not at all. It just... makes sense. I met a Dalek a few days ago, well, a few days ago for me, subjective time and so on. It thought it was the last, they&#39;re never the last, so what we did... what I did... it was all for nothing, wasn&#39;t it? All for absolutely nothing. We <i>lost</i>. The Time Lords <i>lost</i>. And that&#39;s the biggest joke of all, isn&#39;t it? That we all fought and died for absolutely nothing.<br><br>11th Doctor: I&#39;m-<br><br>9th Doctor: Sorry? Is that the word that was going to dance merrily out of your mouth? You&#39;re sorry?<br><br>11th Doctor: No. I&#39;m just going to let you believe all that because you&#39;re not ready to accept how wrong you are about it. Not yet. Not for a while.<br><br>9th Doctor: ... How wrong?<br><br>11th Doctor: I can&#39;t say. You know I can&#39;t. You know the rules.<br><br>9th Doctor: Hmph. Well, when have either of us cared about the rules?<br><br>Notary [shoving a hand in her pocket]: Councillors, let us put it to a vote. All those in favour of, in theory, informing the younger Doctor of his homeworld&#39;s fate?<br><br>[A few hands rise. Morgan gapes at the Notary.]<br><br>Morgan: You&#39;ve snapped. You&#39;ve finally up and snapped-<br><br>Notary: [whispering to Morgan] I have an idea, one I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t think of. [louder] And those opposed?<br><br>[An equal number of hands]<br><br>Notary: Tigereye Castellan, you have the deciding vote.<br><br>Morgan: I... vote in favour.<br><br>Notary: Excellent. The motion is carried. Older Doctor, it is the will of this Council that you explain the events of the Last Day of the Time War to your younger self.<br><br>11th Doctor: But... what about-<br><br>Notary: This Council will hold you in its contempt should you not do so.<br><br>11th Doctor: Oh, will it now?<br><br>Notary: Yes it will. Chop chop, renegade. You&#39;re running late.<br><br>[The 11th Doctor sighs and shakes his head, then begins to tell the 9th Doctor what happened in the serial Day Of The Doctor. The latter is so engrossed in the telling that he doesn&#39;t notice the Notary palming something from the pocket of her robes. Finally, the tale ends.]<br><br>9th Doctor: They survived?<br><br>11th Doctor: Locked away, outside of time. But this is your future, and you shouldn&#39;t know it.<br><br>Notary: And you won&#39;t.<br><br>9th Doctor: What- [He is interrupted by a flash of red light. The Notary tucks her neuralyser away in her pocket and begins to set up some details]<br><br>Morgan: Huh. That was kinda obvious, now that I think about it. Wait, where did you even get that?<br><br>Notary: Stores. I filled out the requisition forms in triplicate some time ago as a matter of course.<br><br>Agent: Is that how you get off or something? I mean, glass of wine, smooth jazz, rose petals leading up the stairs to some 15-Bs that have to be filled in, that&#39;s romantic to you, right?<br><br>Notary: Were it to be so, Amethyst Keeper, I guarantee that you would be the last person I choose for such an endeavour.<br><br>Agent: Oh, thanks.<br><br>Notary: You are quite welcome, Amethyst Keeper.<br><br>9th Doctor: So, fun as all this was, it doesn&#39;t answer the question: how did both of us get here?<br><br>Fearn: THROUGH THE WORKINGS OF SUP-REME CHANCELLOR FEARN, SUP-REME CHANCELLOR OF THE HIGH COUNCIL OF THE DA-LEKS!<br><br>---<br><br>Tune in next week for the shocking continuation of... er... whatever we&#39;re calling this thing that we do.</p>

            <p>(Fearn rolls into the room)<br><br>Fearn: THE LAST STEPS ARE BEING PUT IN-TO PLACE FOR THE IN-EV-IT-A-BLE TRI-UMPH OF THE DA-LEKS!<br><br>Ninth Doctor: Dalek! Back, all of you! Get back!<br><br>(He and Eleven run to the front of the group, sonic screwdrivers pointed at Fearn)<br><br>Fearn: AND WHAT, PRECISELY, DO YOU INTEND TO DO WITH THOSE, DOC-TORS? UNSCREW MY TRAVEL MACHINE CASING?<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: Regrettably, I almost agree with him. This may not have been the best plan.<br><br>Ninth Doctor: Since when was this ever a plan? (beat) And when did they start making blue Daleks?<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: Well, I&#39;ve seen Daleks in blue before, saw a whole rainbow of Daleks once, though none were this one&#39;s frankly delightful and decidedly non-terrifying shade of robins-egg.<br><br>Fearn: I AM <i>EM-PY-RE-AN</i>! IT WAS A THE-SAUR-US MIX-UP!<br><br>Ninth Doctor: You&#39;re a bit mixed-up yourself, I&#39;d say. Look at you, another washed-up dreg of the Dalek race, probably here to wipe out the last few Time Lords in existence-<br><br>Librarian: (whispered to the Notary) <i>He</i> recovered quickly.<br><br>Notary: A neuralyzed mind is a very flexible structure. Besides, I pre-loaded the new memories. I don&#39;t like taking risks.<br><br>Ninth Doctor: (continues, not having heard the previous exchange) -and you can&#39;t even be organized about it! Look at you, just bounding in announcing your so-called victory and babbling about thesauruses, and you&#39;ve not even tried firing a single shot! I&#39;d already thought the Daleks had hit their peak of delusion, but I see you can still top yourselves!<br><br>Fearn: YOU ASSUME TOO MUCH, DOC-TOR. I CAN SEE WHERE YOUR FUTURE SELF OVER THERE GAINED HIS TOWERING ARROGANCE FROM.<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: Oy!<br><br>(Morgan stands up from her seat abruptly)<br><br>Morgan: All three of you, shut it!<br><br>(The Doctors look over at Morgan, while simultaneously keeping Fearn within their sight.)<br><br>Morgan: It&#39;s my responsibility to protect this Council, and that includes keeping these meetings from devolving into a series of unnecessary brawls. I have enough of that to do <i>without</i> unexpected visitors coming in and aggrieving one another. Doctors, Fearn is <i>not</i> a threat.<br><br>Fearn: I RESENT THAT!<br><br>Morgan: (groan) Not a threat to <i>us</i>.<br><br>Fearn: ...BETTER.<br><br>Ninth Doctor: Oh, of course, the Dalek who just barged in here shouting about its race&#39;s inevitable triumph is completely docile. The last time I met a Dalek who was supposedly &quot;harmless&quot;, it ended up, surprise, surprise, killing hundreds of unprepared people! I&#39;m not letting that happen again.<br><br>Librarian: It won&#39;t. Fearn has been instilled with something called the &quot;human factor&quot;. You have seen it before, in your second incarnation, if I recall correctly. It alters the Dalek psyche, disabling some of their pre-conditioned restrictive processes and enabling a wider range of non-aggressive action.<br><br>Disentangler: Translated, he&#39;s friendly. More or less. It&#39;s not as though he doesn&#39;t cause problems, but they aren&#39;t of the &quot;trying to kill you&quot; variety. Trust us.<br><br>(Eleven turns off his sonic screwdriver. Nine scowls, but does the same a few moments later)<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: Fine, then. What would a so-called &quot;friendly Dalek&quot; have to gain by sending two time-displaced versions of the same person, their race&#39;s greatest enemy no less, into unfamiliar territory?<br><br>Fearn: YOUR TOWERING ARR-O-GANCE SHOWS ITSELF ONCE A-GAIN, DOC-TOR.<br><br>Disentangler: Fearn, this would go quicker for all of us if you just stop with the insults and answer the question.<br><br>Fearn: ...FINE. YOU, DOC-TORS, WERE NOT THE FO-CUS OF OUR PLAN! THE AR-RI-VALS OF THE ON-COM-ING STORM AND THE HUN-TER OF SLORP WERE A SIDE EF-FECT!<br><br>Reader: &quot;Our&quot; plan? Who else is involved here?<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: &quot;Hunter of Slorp?&quot;<br><br>Fearn: JUST LIKE A TIME LORD TO FOCUS ON THE DE-TAILS BEFORE THE WHOLE! IF YOU MUST KNOW, I AM CURRENTLY COLLABORATING WITH DA-LEK OMICRON AND DA-LEK CHAR-LIE ON-<br><br>Ninth Doctor: Hold on. There&#39;s a Dalek named Charlie?<br><br>Fearn: YES. HE WAS THE FIRST TO AC-CEPT MY-<br><br>Ninth Doctor: Is he baby-blue, too?<br><br>Fearn: HE IS <i>NOT</i>, I AM <i>EM-PY-RE-AN</i>, AND <i>STOP</i> IN-TERR-UP-TING ME!<br><br>Reader: You&#39;re the one who keeps barging in here, you know. Well, barged in twice, anyway. We can&#39;t exactly get a council going with all of these interruptions.<br><br>Fearn: (faces the Council table) YES, BECAUSE YOU ARE DIS-PAR-ATE AND IN-COM-PAT-I-BLE. WHILE THE TIME LORDS WERE FORCED TO TRAWL THROUGH THEIR IN-SIG-NI-FI-CANT STORE OF A-GENTS TO SELECT COUN-CILL-ORS, THE DA-LEKS, SPEARHEADED BY THE GLO-RI-OUS KNOWLEDGE AND AC-TION OF MY-SELF, FEARN, HAVE BEEN SCOURING THE MY-RI-AD OF WORLDS FOR ALL POSS-I-BLE VAR-I-A-TIONS ON THE DA-LEK FORM! TRULY OUR SU-PER-I-OR-I-TY IS UNMATCHED IN THE COSMOS!<br><br>Agent: Is that what you&#39;ve been trying to tell us this whole time? Because honestly, that didn&#39;t tell anyone of much of anything. Normally, when you give someone new information, it helps if you explain it.<br><br>Fisherman: Wait, I think he&#39;s talking about the temporal fold.<br><br>Fearn: I SEE THAT NOT ALL TIME LORDS ARE IN-CAP-A-BLE OF DE-DUC-TION!<br><br>Fisherman: Did you cause that? How would you even know how to do that?<br><br>Fearn: I AM A STRA-TE-GIST OF THE DA-LEKS, WITH YEARS OF EX-PER-I-ENCE IN THE DE-PART-MENT OF TEM-PO-RAL OFF-EN-SES! THERE-FORE, I AM AN UN-PAR-ALL-ELLED SUPER-GENIUS SLASH CY-BORG SLASH TIME TRAVEL EXPERT. I AM QUITE SURE THAT I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING.<br><br>Morgan: I don&#39;t think the cyborg bit helps much with that.<br><br>Fearn: I BELIEVE IT DOES.<br><br>Ninth Doctor: So, let me get this straight. You&#39;ve been creating temporal folds, which have the well-deserved reputation of being dangerous and quite possibly threatening to local causality, summoning other Daleks to... wherever this is, and generally trying for an amateur-hour run of mucking about with space-time- (turns to the Disentangler) -and this is the <i>nice</i> Dalek?<br><br>Disentangler: I said he was <i>friendly</i>. Not nice.<br><br>Fearn: WHY IS IT THAT ONLY THE DA-LEKS REFUSE TO PUSH AWAY THE RISKS OF INN-O-VA-TION? YOU TIME LORDS WOULD MONITOR YOUR PEOPLE FROM THE DI-LU-TED PER-SPEC-TIVE OF A SINGLE BATCH OF DRIF-TERS, OUT-CASTS AND RE-NE-GADES, SIM-PLY BECAUSE YOU SEE POSSIBLE HARM IN STRETCHING YOUR BOUNDARIES. ON-LY THREE DA-LEKS WERE IN-TER-ES-TED IN COUN-CIL PO-SI-TIONS, SO WE USED OUR TEM-POR-AL FOLD TO BRING IN MORE RE-CRUITS! THERE ARE THOU-SANDS OF WORD WORLDS, MILL-IONS OF POSS-I-BLE UN-I-VER-SES, AND A SIMPLE DIS-TOR-TION OF SPACE AND TIME COULD OVERLAP THE SPA-CI-ALLY AM-BI-GU-OUS HALLS OF HEAD-QUAR-TERS WITH A-NY OF THEM! THE DA-LEK HIGH COUNCIL IS NOW COM-POSED OF THE BEST AND GREA-TEST OF THE DA-LEKS, OF ALL FACTIONS AND SUB-TYPES! I EX-PEC-TED THE DOC-TOR TO IN-VES-TI-GATE THE DIS-RUP-TION OF TEM-POR-AL PRO-GRESSION, OF COURSE, THOUGH I HAD PREDICTED ON-LY ONE INSTANCE. IT IS IN THE DOC-TOR&#39;S NA-TURE TO FLY RIGHT IN-TO AN-Y-THING HE DOES NOT UN-DER-STAND.<br><br>Eleventh Doctor: Got me pegged there, mate.<br><br>Fearn: (angry staccato) <i>WHAT IS IT WITH YOU TIME LORDS AND IN-TERR-UP-TING MY MON-O-LOGUES TO-DAY‽</i> (Fearn briefly pauses, and performs an feat that would be unthinkable for any non-humanized Dalek: calming down slightly) NOW IF I MAY CON-TIN-UE-<br><br>Notary: Hold it! I <i>was</i> going to say something when you erroneously labelled me a renegade(the Notary rankles at the very thought), but this is just going too far.<br><br>Fearn: YOU WOULD OP-POSE THE OB-VI-OUS TRUTH OF THE DA-<br><br>Notary: I wasn&#39;t finished! You&#39;re claiming to have, between this meeting and the last one, set up <i>something</i> to allow you to overlap this timeline with an inconceivable number of others, just so that you could pull random Daleks into our reality and ask them if they&#39;d like to me members of your imitation council. Never mind the poor planning involved in literally every step of that, no three Agents would have the resources to enact that plan, even if they were, in your words, &quot;supergenius cyborgs&quot;. Besides, the power drain on the DoDAEG generators would cause another blackout before the fold could stay in place for ten seconds. You are just, once again, trying to use the problems that this council has experienced to draw attention to yourself by claiming responsibility for them. In layman&#39;s terms, you&#39;re bluffing.<br><br>Librarian: Notary, I believe that you are disregarding one irrefutable fact. The fold does still exist, even if the Daleks are not causing it. In fact, this Council has directly experienced its effects.<br><br>Fisherman: You took the words right from my mouth, Librarian. Well, not really, since I&#39;d have said them slightly differently. But still, Notary, you should know about the fold better than anyone, since your timeline was overlapped so much that for at least a few minutes you were replaced with a five-hundred-years younger doppelgänger who wanted to take over HQ!<br><br>Notary: It is not my fault if my fellow Councillors mishear me. I stated my precise age, and if you choose to believe otherwise, you may.<br><br>Fisherman: She called herself &quot;Spinel <i>Promontor</i>&quot;! Promontor isn&#39;t even a <i>word</i> in our reality!<br><br>Notary: (ignoring him) I propose that, even if Fearn were, for some inexplicable reason, the cause of the alleged disruption, he would not be able to maintain it long enough to get anything through it, let alone a cross-multiversal squad of Daleks!<br><br>Fearn: I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO SAY THAT. (turns to the door) FELLOW DA-LEK COUN-CILL-ORS! YOU MAY NOW ENTER!<br><br>(A Scientist Dalek rolls into the room, flanked by a Time War Dalek and a Crucible Dalek.

            <p>Bear in mind that neither of the Doctors have met Fearn, and that it&#39;s been established that Nine is fresh off the back of <i>Dalek</i>. They&#39;re not just going to let Fearn talk.<br><br>If I was writing it (which I&#39;m not, because I have no idea what Fearn is planning), I&#39;d probably do the next section something like this:<br><br>9th Doctor: Dalek!

<br><br>Of course, this post assumes you (Outhra or Lily) don&#39;t have something planned otherwise... but I thought it best to mention.<br><br>Also, if this happened, I&#39;d interject this somewhere further down:<br><br>Fearn: [Something about plots]<br><br>11th Doctor: I thought you said he was friendly?<br><br>Disentangler: We did.

            <p>[Cue inevitable fight over how the present writers break down on the Pinky/Brain spectrum]<br><br>A-<i>hem</i>.<br><br>Anyway... Doctor Who does audio dramas.<br><br>Of the seven Council members, I think... five, maybe, can be voiced by their authors (I can&#39;t do Morgan, and I&#39;m guessing Lily can&#39;t do the Agent); the others could be rotated around (I&#39;d happily voice the Agent, for instance). Then we have Fearn, who can pretty much be yelled by anyone... and two incarnations of the Doctor.<br><br>Given that both my parents are northern (&quot;Lots of planets have a north!&quot;), I&#39;d be willing to take a stab at voicing Nine (yes, I&#39;m aware there&#39;s lots of bits of Up North, and if anyone from Actual Lancashire - or The Actual North - wants to take the part, I&#39;ll happily surrender it). Does anyone think they can do Eleven?<br><br>I dunno. It could work, in theory - but it&#39;d be a heck of a challenge to pull it together. July, Sara and I never finished the Radio Plays, and there were only three of us (though we did get most of the way through). I&#39;d be happy to do the legwork of splicing it all together if people want to do the voicing...<br><br>Oh, of course, we need a finished story first. I think Outhra has something lined up...?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Ooh, the voice actor inside of me is getting chills. Sadly, my recording equipment at the moment is a little... Lackluster. The Blue Snowball I have is fine, but I think it may have been dropped one too many times or something. As it is, I&#39;m semi-soon going to be getting new equipment for recording stuff at the house so I can work on my voices. It&#39;s nice just walking down the street and speaking in my voices, but the voice always sounds different recorded them spoken. <br><br>So, while my British accents are a little shaky, and my equipment is lacking, if this still has yet to go on in, oh, about a month, I&#39;ll see what I can record.</p>

            <p>Also, a little thought regarding the whole Topaz Monitor/Citrine Theorist thought: Have them as two separate positions, and change Citrine to Chalcedony. If we keep the setup of Monitor as originally laid out and don&#39;t fold it into the Castellan&#39;s duties, then we can have the seventh member of our little rainbow as the far-violet end, taking from the Sapphire and Amethyst Councillors and kludging together workable solutions to major plot holes from there. =]<br><br>Also, perhaps colours outside the main spectrum should be called Antient members.

            <p>-The seven-colour rainbow is purely an Earth invention, coming from Sir Isaac&#39;s religious leanings. Insofar as the light spectrum can be split into discrete colours, six is far more logical.<br><br>-That idea would leave us without a yellow Council member.<br><br>-Seven &#39;spectrum&#39; Councillors doesn&#39;t work as neatly with Tektek, since there&#39;s no &#39;facing the front&#39; model to stand in the middle.<br><br>-I already made the Reader&#39;s collar yellow. ;)<br><br>We already have the grey Spinel Promotor outside the spectrum. I&#39;ve added the Onyx Monitor (relations with other Time Lords who end up being recruited) as a position currently being subbed by the Citrine Theorist. We can then add the <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/White-Point_Star">Whitepoint</a> Coordinator, who takes what was originally listed as the Topaz Monitor&#39;s jobs. At present the Tigereye Castellan is subbing for both the Whitepoint Coordinator and the Opal Chairperson; that may change if new Time Lords show up.<br><br>I like the idea of Antient members - but a) it may be unfair on the non-spectrum colours, since they are still doing valuable jobs, and b) that&#39;s a very obscure reference (I live in Essex and I had to look it up). Maybe Antient members can be those - who don&#39;t yet exist - who are on the Council but don&#39;t actually hold a position? They&#39;re the ones the Onyx Monitor watches over, and the Whitepoint Coordinator communicates with - which is why those posts don&#39;t exist yet.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Rassilon is the leader of the Time Lords from an in-universe perspective, while the Council watches over continua from a metafictional perspective. There&#39;s not really much overlap, since the Continuity Council cannot directly affect the published history of its world, and Rassilon can only affect that same published history. Also, since Rassilon isn&#39;t aware of the existence of a multiverse beyond the knowledge of pocket universes and alternate timelines that comes with being a time traveller, he wouldn&#39;t even be able to detect the Council&#39;s existence, since it exists outside of reality as he knows it. True, it would probably be best to keep an eye on him, but mostly because he&#39;s crazy in a small but potent number of increasingly unpleasant ways, not because he&#39;d try to take over the Continuity Council. It&#39;s outside his jurisdiction, anyway; if he or some other canonical Time Lords muscle in and try to force themselves into the Council, the Tigereye Castellan or perhaps some DIA Officers can just neuralyze them, then drag them off back to their home universe, and all the impact it would have on the Council as a whole is that the next meeting would contain a sternly worded order for the current Monitor to step up their game.<br><br>(If this seems a little messy, it&#39;s because I&#39;m summarizing from a longer post I made a while back, but couldn&#39;t submit before my Internet crashed. I may have maltreated the details.)<br><br>By the way, I don&#39;t think &quot;Epistolarian&quot; was the word you were going for there. What I&#39;ve been able to find on that word suggests that it was either someone who writes letters or someone who contributes to a religious work, and neither of those suggest a person who would organize collected data and communicate with or organize members of a group, which seem to be the main roles of the Whitepoint Coordiantor as of this point.</p>

So she&#39;s definitely around, and I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be interested in being on this Council (if a bit wary, considering that the last Council she had any knowledge of was during the Time War).

            <p>Topaz Monitor is still open, though, if you/she would be interested, and Huinesoron suggested that an Onyx ____ position might be open if someone can think of a council role to associate with it.<br><br>From the looks of things, the main research-oriented positions would be with the Jade Warden and Amethyst Keeper, but Topaz Monitor would as one of its duties be in charge of making sure everyone has up-to-date information on whatever the Council&#39;s attention is directed toward, which would probably require research. The blurb also seems to imply that the Topaz Monitor would be the one in charge of collecting any data that would pertain to the Council&#39;s interests in order to guide the direction of the group as a whole, which would fit within the Reader&#39;s purview as well. I imagine the Monitor and the new position of the Spinel Promotor would frequently be at odds, since the Monitor&#39;s data would support one course of action, while the Promotor&#39;s views and role as the devil&#39;s advocate to oppose the Council&#39;s proceeding without proper discourse would likely support an entirely different direction.<br><br>I&#39;m not quite sure what will happen with the Chairperson. The Reader is the last active Time Lord Agent within PPC standard canon, save Natalie Green, who is only <i>genetically</i> Gallifreyan, and that only due to a glitch in the D.O.R.K.S. involving the conditions for Time Lord regeneration. Essentially, Natalie probably won&#39;t be picked as a Council leader. Maybe one of the existing Council members will be appointed to Chairperson in addition to their current role, but I don&#39;t really know if anyone would both want it and be up to the task of leading everyone.</p>

            <p>You do realize, of course, that the Reader is just under 200 years old? And, from her perspective, only actually left Time War-era Gallifrey less than a year back? I&#39;m just...I&#39;m not entirely sure she&#39;s the right choice for Topaz Monitor--well, no, she could probably do the job, with a lot of effort, but...she&#39;d freak out about it. A lot. And I&#39;m not sure how happy she&#39;d be to be both doing that job and having so much responsibility. She&#39;s just...really not the Time Lord I&#39;d choose for that job. Or for the job of Chairperson, for that matter--while she might be able to fill the role, she definitely wouldn&#39;t be my first choice: she&#39;s young, inexperienced, and, well, if she was made Chairperson, I think she&#39;d end up just consumed by the fear that she&#39;d follow in Rassilon&#39;s footsteps. I think she&#39;d do much better in a slightly lower position--definitely one where she isn&#39;t actually more or less in charge of everyone else. Give her a century, and she might be the right choice; but just now, she really isn&#39;t (at least to my way of thinking, and to hers as well, I believe.)<br><br>In terms of an Onyx ___ position...sounds awesome, but I have no idea what sort of role would go with it. All that&#39;s really coming to mind is for someone to keep an eye on the trends in Time Lord Sues and Stus and look out for any who could be recruited...and, if any of them (or any Time Lord replacement characters) can be recruited, probably keeping an eye on them as well, keeping them under control. That is something the Reader could do (and is similar to something she was eventually going to do in her home canon, actually). The position could potentially be called the Oxyx Guard/Onyx Guardian, or something. But that&#39;s pretty much all I&#39;ve got, and I&#39;m not even sure if it even applies to this Council idea.<br><br>I do want the Reader to have a role, though. Any (further) ideas for what that role could be?<br><br>(Also, I think the Agent might have my vote for Chairperson. Not entirely sure, though.)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I like the notion of a Guardian type post - but not under that title, because the Guardians are a <i>different</i> part of Time Lord mythology.<br><br>But anyway, I&#39;ve found the perfect post for the Reader (I think). If we fold the roles of the Topaz Monitor into the Tigereye Castellan&#39;s job (ie, make Morgan do the talking to people), that opens up space for:<br><br><b>The Citrine Theorist</b>. Taking information from the Sapphire Watcher and Amethyst Keeper, the Citrine Theorist is responsible for finding plotholes - and plugging them through theory and logic. <br><br><b>[Spoilers for <i>The Day of the Doctor</i>]</b><br><br>As an example which Morgan&#39;s already solved: the Time War was long said to be Time Locked, meaning that Gallifrey&#39;s very existence was wiped from time - in some ways, it had never existed. But <i>The Day of the Doctor</i> revealed that the Moment was never used - and thus, that there is no mechanism for Time Locking the War. Plot&#39;ole! But as Morgan points out, throwing thirteen copies of the same TARDIS at a planet is bound to have <i>some</i> repercussions...<br><br><b>[End spoilers]</b><br><br>So what do you think? I think either option works - the Citrine Theorist, or redefining the Topaz Monitor into your Onyx Guard idea (since, you&#39;re right, that seems like something the Council would cover). So I think it&#39;s up to the Reader what she prefers to do.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Also: the only description I can find of the Reader reads, &quot;She was a young brunette who stood almost a full foot shorter than the smooth-faced Klingon.&quot; I&#39;m going to try and make a Tektek from that, but am perfectly willing to make a new one if you can put together a new description.<br><br>PPS: Oh, I take it back. From <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=240714;search_term=the+reader">here</a>, we have &quot;The Reader&#39;s current regeneration is that of a 21-year-old woman with brown hair and dark blue-grey eyes. Technically, she&#39;s closer to 100 or 150 years old but, well, Time Lords. What can you do. She normally wears a dark plum shirt (not button-up), a jean-jacket, black pants, and hiking shoes. Her hair reaches to approximately mid-back.&quot; Of course, you say several times that that description is probably not applicably to PPC!Reader - but I&#39;ll use it until you give me one that is. ~hS</p>

            <p>...and I&#39;ll be sure to weigh in on the Reader&#39;s chosen role in the morning (it&#39;s really, really late, and I must sleep). In the meantime, though--have a (more recent) description, as I can put that together very quickly:<br><br>The Reader (Fourth Reader) has fairly wavy, light brown hair, tanned skin, and dark green eyes. She looks to be about in her mid- to late-20s, but is actually somewhere between 150 and 200 years old. The bit about being shorter than the Klingon (Kozar) is still accurate, and I&#39;m afraid I have no idea what she commonly wears--although I suspect it&#39;s not robes and has a DIC flashpatch somewhere on it. She probably tends to wear relatively light colors, though, or patterned things...I can just see her walking around in a light-colored shirt with dark, swirling patterns all over it. Beyond that, I&#39;ve got nothing, although I could probably narrow it down further--for instance, I doubt she wears jeans.<br><br>Doing half a reply at a time is fun...sort of. Hm.

            <p>That is <i>nice</i>. <i>Very</i> nice. Wow. And yeah, I can definitely see her getting into this so much that she&#39;d want to be wearing something resembling robes--I&#39;m fairly sure her father (well, pending a little further/redone research into how Gallifreyan families work) was some sort of politician, and she was also probably brought up to revere the High Council, so she&#39;d probably find it disrespectful not to give <i>some</i> nod in the direction of the traditional dress.<br><br>...what do you know, yellow onyx exists.

The only real issue I&#39;m seeing with combining those aspects is that plugging plotholes through theory and logic while also keeping an eye on Time Lord/Gallifreyan recruits seems a little unrelated...which, of course, can be solved by simply making the part about the recruits be a sort of sub-duty of the Citrine Theorist, or else just a more minor position that the Reader also volunteered to do?<br><br>...in other words, I rather like the idea of both of these, and am trying to combine them. I think I&#39;d like to see the Reader doing a mix of the two; and I think she&#39;d be able (and, with some thought, willing) to do this, especially once she&#39;s told she can be in charge of the Gallifreyan recruits--it means interaction with people who are more or less from her home, and also a chance to nip any development of Rassilon&#39;s madder ideas in the bud...<br><br>I&#39;m not entirely sure how that bit of the Onyx Guard description should actually be worked in, though...help?<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: In other news: that cast picture is <i>fantastic</i>.</p>

Her voice ached from all the discussions, her head hurt from all the decision-making, and - oh, yes - even the holographic, <i>Hunger Games</i>-tech collar was starting to make its weight known.<br><br>But, finally, it was coming to an end.

At some point earlier in the day, Morgan had clipped a description of an &#39;Onyx Monitor&#39;, who would keep an eye on Time Lords in badfic, see if any were worth recruiting, and supervise any new recruits on behalf of the Council.<br><br>&quot;And that&#39;s great,&quot; Morgan said, glancing to the side again, &quot;but we don&#39;t have anyone to <i>be</i> the Monitor. I&#39;m certainly not going to take the post... ugh, where&#39;s that list?&quot;<br><br>The list in question - the master list of Council positions - turned out to be pinned to the wall in front of her. &quot;The Ruby Shipwright&#39;s going to be overworked as it is,&quot; Morgan mused, &quot;just like the Jade Warden. If I&#39;m doing admin, that puts the Tigereye Castellan out of the running, too. The Amethyst Keeper... no, there&#39;s way too much &#39;other media&#39; for that. Maybe the Sapphire Watcher...? I mean, they only make thirteen episodes a year, right?&quot;<br><br>Unbidden, Morgan&#39;s gaze strayed back to the previous sheet of paper. &quot;On the other hand,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;most episodes won&#39;t make serious plotholes... so the Citrine Theorist will have the least to do.&quot; She nodded to her self, decided. &quot;The Reader can take the Monitor&#39;s duties until we get someone to do it permanantly. I&#39;ll let her know the good news.&quot; She dropped the paper on the &#39;out&#39; stack, and turned over the next.<br><br>&quot;Right... decorations for the Council chamber...&quot;</p>

            <p>Agent Morgan? The Fisherman here.<br><br>I think your idea is an excellent one, given what&#39;s been going on recently. I only found out about all that the other day you know - Evie asked me something about how 13 versions of the same TARDIS can be in the same area without causing a temporal anomaly.<br><br>I of course told her that they couldn&#39;t be, it would cause an n-fold reversal of spacetime that could lead to a whole planet being ripped out of reality. She then said something along the lines of &#39;oh, that&#39;s how he must have done it then&#39;. I said something along the lines of &#39;huhwhat?&#39; and she explained.<br><br><em>No, I asked how you managed to miss the biggest story of the last few months despite the fact said story took place in your home continuum!</em><br><br>Quiet Evie. *ahem*<br><br>So yes, I think it is very important, now more than ever to protect ourselves and will happily join the Continuity Council. I believe I would be an excellent fit for the position of Ruby Shipwright - I have extensive experience with TARDIS technology...<br><br><em>Let&#39;s see... you ripped out the proven, tested PPC integration panel calling it &#39;inelegant&#39;, replaced it with a rats maze of wiring that even I can&#39;t make sense of and &#39;integrated&#39; a replicator that now seems capable of making bananas and little else.<br><br>Need I go on?</em><br><br>Oh, shush - the integration panel works by artificially restricting the TARDIS&#39; access to the vortex in order to control it. Clipping its wings, so to speak. I simply could not have that. My method is... better. Complicated, but better.<br><br><em>You can&#39;t remember how it works, can you?</em><br><br>I didn&#39;t say that! I haven&#39;t worked on it for a while because I don&#39;t need to, I&#39;m sure it&#39;d all come back if I needed it to. Now, before this message gets multiple-personality disorder I think I should send it: Morgan, I look forward to working alongside you in protection of our home continuum.<br><br><hr>

            <p>I have yet to write an agent <i>at all</i>, let alone a Time Lord one. That one of these hypothetical agents is a Time Lord is important; that they might be a part of this council is, like you said, background colour. This would also mean pairing a self-important, slightly stuffy Time Lord bureaucrat with a clown of Candide-like optimism, and we both know how much comedy can be wrung from that kind of setup, it having been the main source of inspiration for double acts since time immemorial.</p>

            <p>The Time Lords are an ancient civilisation; one of the most ancient that are still extant, in fact.

            <p>Of course, the whole point of concept stage with a character is you put down an idea and then start fleshing them out more and more until they&#39;re, y&#39;know, an actual character worth writing. Too many people skip the &quot;let&#39;s actually develop this concept&quot; stage after getting to the &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be cool if&quot; part though - I wonder if it&#39;s part of why so many people do a couple missions and then just vanish. Not all of them have that reason of course - and I&#39;m kinda hypocritical even putting it forwards, aren&#39;t I, not having written/finished anything for three years? :P - but it could be a factor for some of the &quot;I&#39;m going to have a robot agent who fires lasers&quot; crowd. Though I should add the caveat that all this should really apply not just to &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be cool if&quot; characters, but &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be funny if&quot; characters - if somebody&#39;s entire existence is one joke, that&#39;s not a very interesting person to read about, is it?<br><br>(On the note of Five Doctors: am I the only one who finds it odd that so much of a big deal is made about not crossing your own personal timeline, but just about every Doctor has had a special where he interacts with at least one of the previous Doctors?)</p>

That said, there are more colours available - I can&#39;t think of a gem for grey right now, but the position of the Onyx Advocate - who speaks for ideas which the Council seems opposed to, and against those the Council supports - can certainly be created.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/DresdenOppose.jpg"><br><br>(With both thanks and apologies to Dresden Codak for the image.

            <p>Still the best character establishment ever.

I found a few possible options after a brief serach. Some beryl types are gray or grayish-clear, but beryl also comes in several other colors.(In related news, emerald is a beryl affected by greenish impurity. I did not know that.) For less-known gemstones, hematite and tourmaline are gray, but those aren&#39;t exactly well-known, and Time Lords might be less than likely to name themselves after gems that they would need to explain to people.<br><br>If no one can think of anything that sounds good, pewter is gray; it isn&#39;t by any definition a gem, but it&#39;s a well-known gray substance.</p>

            <p>As for grey gemstones, well, there&#39;s always agate, but for this I think the title would be best expressed as Spinel Promotor. Spinel&#39;s one of those semi-precious gems that has a lot of colours associated with it but is primarily found with a single-refraction grey, and Promotor comes from <i>promotor fidei</i>, the Roman Catholic term for a canon lawyer who argued against the canonization of a candidate for sainthood by picking holes in arguments, analysing the character of the candidate and so on. This is actually where we get the term devil&#39;s advocate from; it was the common term <i>advocatus  diaboli</i>, who was ranged against the <i>advocatus dei</i> or God&#39;s advocate.

            <p>Well, since you&#39;ve come up with the title and all... shall we assume the Notary is the Spinel Promotor Elect, pending only her acceptance as a PPC agent (ie, you getting Permission to write her)? I didn&#39;t have any other plans for grey, so it&#39;s not actually reserving a place - just planning one in advance.<br><br>Which means onyx can stay in reserve for when we need it.

<br><br>Morgan: Why am I appointing someone to my- er, <i>the</i> Continuity Council whose role is specifically to tell us we&#39;re wrong? Because I&#39;ve seen the show - I&#39;ve seen what happened when Rassilon thought he was above reproach. When he decided that those who opposed him should be punished for their actions.<br><br>I don&#39;t want that to happen in HQ. I don&#39;t want our Council to become like his. So yes, we need someone who stands outside the line - someone who is willing to tell us no. Given who&#39;s on the Council, what we really need is a stuffy old bureaucrat who hates the very idea of change - but who is still capable of giving <i>reasons</i> for her opposition.<br><br>Yes, we need a Spinel Promotor.

            <p>Both have similar origin points, benefits and downfalls. Both ideally come from a point of having an interesting idea what to write (or possibly a funny background detail) but need to be fleshed out beyond that point to turn out an actual good character, regardless of if the original intent was serious, humouros or &quot;cool&quot; - good execution is good execution regardless of if you had a joke or not, likewise with bad. Of course, what I think is a common failing point is people not having a concrete idea of where their agent&#39;s story is going - or possibly not hhaving a concrete story at all. That can work fine of course, but might explain most spinoffs petering out.<br></p>

            <p>In some ways, she will likely be <i>worse</i>, at least initially. Borusa, for my money, seemed to genuinely care about the Doctor (at the start); the Notary despises renegades of all forms and denounces them as cowards and fugitives from justice. The irony that she does this having run away from the Time War is at present entirely lost on her. Hypocrisy&#39;s funny like that. Of course, this makes the idea of her being lumped in on the Continuity Council with the other Time Lord agents even funnier in my mind, but YMMV and all that. =]<br><br>--parp</p>

            <p>and I just want to know if I can do it, basically he/she is the son/daughter of a Mary sue.  <br><br>Their back story would go like this, in one badfic a Mary sue has a baby, at about this time the agents (who ever they maybe) are about to do in the sue and take the baby.  Before they can get the sue she teleports the child &quot;som were alse&quot; ,where exactly the sue doesn&#39;t know, so after killing her the agents now have to wait for the kid to start causing some havoc in the continuum he/she was sent to and ether kill him/her or bring him/her in.<br><br>Luckily for the PPC the kid, now with a reformed author, has been growing up in the Pokemon continuum just fine.  He/she still has a few problems like some &#39;natural&#39; rainbow coloring in their hair, cat ears and tail, two different colored eyes (one purple and the other green), and a magic staff given to him/her by their mother before she sent them though the portal (plothole).  The reasoning for this is even though the author knows the mother character is a sue she still wanted to have the character be her child she basically tossed away, so she did this by dialing a lot of the Mary sue traits and giving the character a much better personality and making him a friend/partner character to another instead of being the main character him/her self.<br><br>If your wondering how they get into the PPC now, well here is the answer.  the author in and intentional nice jestor to their younger sibling she lets them use the characters as bit characters in a fanfic as long they don&#39;t tamper with the design and personalities and give her credit.  Unknown to the author the fic in question is a badfic (as one might say &#39;no good deed goes unpunished&#39;).<br><br>Now this is just a random idea that came into my head while thinking of back-stories for them, I&#39;m not trying to make the others bland though and I will give them interesting back-stories too. As usual I&#39;m putting this up here for critiquing and general comments, so come one come all, and say your opinion and maybe help stop me from putting time and effort into a character I can&#39;t even use. :D  </p>

What happens if the Agent is a Pokemon, either from the Mystery Dungeon series (where they are more humanoid anyway) or if it&#39;s a Pokemon disguised as a human (Ditto or Zoroark are the two Pokemon who really have the ability to do it). With the latter, would they still be allowed to operate as an Agent even after their true form is revealed? Or would they be downgraded (not sure that&#39;s the word) to effectively become a Mini for the Agent they used to work with?  <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>And Mewtwo was specifically designed to be hyper-intelligent. Most non-legendary Pokémon in the series, especially the wild ones, behave like animals, albeit animals capable of understanding human commands. Then again, I distinctly remember one episode of the show featuring a talking, shapeshifting Gastly connected somehow to a by-then-deceased human, and Team Rocket&#39;s Meowth was able to gain the abilities to both speak and emote recognizably by mimicking human actions, so it&#39;s possible that most Pokémon have the <i>potential</i> for sapience and can just be guided toward that sapience from their default sentience with the help of a fully sapient being, such as a human or an elevated Pokémon. That perturbs me a little bit, though, and I can&#39;t exactly put into words why.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t like the people in Pokemon much. The games are fine, but the world within it is a bit on the &#39;monsterous&#39; side of things. I mean, forcing innocent creatures to fight to the <s>death</s> unconsiousness is bad enough, but treating clearly intelegent beings as nothing more then animals, who&#39;s only worth in life is to fight other creatures of greater or lesser power and intelegence for their masters is a little...Evil.<br><br>Look, I&#39;ll spare a rant on my part and just leave a link to Game Theory and what they have to say on the issue:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxNcQLXuFJI"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxNcQLXuFJI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxNcQLXuFJI</a></a><br><br>Just, think about what you&#39;ve done to your little Pokemon, alright?</p>

            <p>It is not the PPC&#39;s modus operandi to allow a young Sue to run around in the multiverse unsupervised just because their parent sent them away. They find the Sue-babies, make sure that the children do not pose a threat, and then bring them back to the Nursery, where they will be properly educated in the ways of canon and in being non-terrible people by the Nursery staff and the Nursery Flower, Professor Beans. Several stories have detailed Agents bringing back badfic babies, whether they&#39;re Sue offspring, slash pregnancies, or otherwise impossible births, so it&#39;s not hard to conceive that an Agent&#39;s backstory could deal with them being a former Sue-child. Maybe a misplaced adjective caused rapid aging, or the child has simply been in the Nursery since the first Pokémon badfics back in the 1990s, or something of the sort.<br>If you&#39;re wondering how the Agents would be able to find the baby if the Sue teleports him or her away, that&#39;s actually been addressed in a few missions in a few ways. Essentially, due to the way the Word Worlds work, a vagueness of surroundings can be altered slightly by Agents with strong enough willpower, as long as they fit the canon involved and do not contradict any of the Words. A command as vague as &quot;somewhere else&quot; could easily be shaped into &quot;not here, but over there, behind that tree&quot;. If the field Agents couldn&#39;t do it, the DIA would probably be sent in for cleanup, and they would be able to shape the undefined command enough to find the baby.<br><br>Secondly, I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at with a &quot;reformed author&quot;. Would the original author know that their Sue was killed, and create a sequel series around the baby? Because they tend not to. Also, if the author was reformed from creating Suvians, they probably would not have written a heterochromic cat-hybrid in the Pokémon continuum unless they were doing it as a joke.<br>In addition, just because a character is a secondary or a supporting character, this does not make them non-Suvian. In fact, it can sometimes make their Suvian characteristics harder to detect, since the Sue wouldn&#39;t have as much screen time to display them, and thus make the character more resistant to reformation.<br><br>And I really didn&#39;t understand the last section at all. The former Sue-baby is used as a main character in a new fic because the original author was jesting with a younger sibling, and this somehow leads to the PPC finding and recruiting them? Agents usually tend to kill any bit characters that are abnormal enough to be unable to assimilate with canon, for one, and again, this one is a heterochromic cat-hybrid in the Pokémon continuum, so it&#39;s practically impossible to assimilate. Sometimes the Agents will recruit bits, if they&#39;re interesting, entertaining, or surprisingly well-rounded, but they wouldn&#39;t likely recruit a character showing above-standard levels of Suvian traits. Also, I&#39;m not sure how the last section ties into any of the rest, since linking a badfic bit character with the complicated PPC-related backstory just seems to be unnecessary and a bit contrived. It seems like there are two ideas here, one a former Sue-child who now acts as an Agent and one a character passed off to a badfic writer who wrote them into a poor story that attracted the PPC&#39;s attention, and they don&#39;t really mesh.</p>

            <p>Since the series itself is a sort of alternate universe for the real world, would that mean that everything (person, country, etc.) would exist, except for events that happened to them and the actions they perform would be extremely different?

            <p>(Well, Firefox restarted itself right when I completed this the first time, so that was more than annoying.)<br><br>Anyhoo, are there any... guidelines for creating agents? I&#39;m mostly concerned that after I get permission, I&#39;ll screw something up and look like a fool. Also curious if someone can have more than one agent team (Say they&#39;ve got two agents working in Bad Slash, and one in Mary Sues where they co-write the missions with somebody else). Is that acceptable?</p>

            <p>I dunno if anyone will see it though. Anyway... Is it possible for agents to find and recruit a character if they are only briefly mentioned? Would said character even come into existence within the badfic? Say it were something like...<br><br><i> &quot;Whos that&quot; fluttershy asked?<br>&quot;Oh&quot; Twilight replies &quot;Thats my sister. We have the same colors but our manes are a bit different.

            <p>In this example, if the mini (lack of capitalisation creates minis, right?) was saying, &quot;Who is that who I am looking at?&quot;, that would create the character in question. If, instead, the meaning was, &quot;Who is that you have just mentioned?&quot;... then it sort of becomes a coin toss. In theory, the agents could probably track the character down if they really wanted to, but...<br><br>... why would they want to? Bits of backstory will fade away when the story is fixed, so they don&#39;t need to hunt her down to fix the canon. And someone with that little a mention, why would they want to recruit her?<br><br>I can imagine many situations where <i>you</i> would want to do so - basically, if you&#39;ve found (or created) a character you really want to write - but why would the <i>agents</i> do so? Imagine that, once the character was recruited, you were never going to have anything to do with them again - would you still want to recruit them?<br><br>Ultimately, though, it all comes down to the Rule of Funny. Tracking down every barely-mentioned character isn&#39;t funny. Locating the balrog&#39;s little sister who is three feet tall and will be constantly mistaken for a mini is.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I doubt the agents would want to hunt down every single character created during the story if they were that minor. I&#39;m just trying to come up with a plausible reason for Penchant coming to be and joining the PPC. <br>Would it make more sense if she were a side character that the author created for no reason other than to be snarky and antisocial, and the agents found it enough of a redeeming factor not to kill her? </p>

            <p>I posted a workshop/rant/thing a while ago with various tips and tricks for making characters (or at least, how I go about the process). The original post has been well and truly buried, but you can still read the information <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User_talk:PoorCynic#Workshop_One:_Characters">here</a>. There&#39;s also a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User_talk:PoorCynic#Workshop_One-A:_Powered_Characters">follow-up</a> regarding characters with powers.<br><br>If you still have any concerns while creating your character, get someone else to look at what you have.

            <p>These are sort of OT to the thread as a whole--sorry about that.<br><br>But, PC, I&#39;m wondering if you intended all the text styling I&#39;m seeing in the character creation posts. You&#39;ve got some words in a different font, and other words that are blue with a dotted underline and seem to have something to do with ads, if I&#39;m reading the code right. If you styled it up yourself I&#39;ll let it go, but if you didn&#39;t, I&#39;ll be happy to clean it up for you. My suspicion is that all that code somehow snuck in when you copied and pasted from the Board, especially if you&#39;re not using an adblocker or something like that.<br><br>Second, this is more of a suggestion, but have you considered using the wiki&#39;s Blog feature for posts like that? It seems like a good format for a series of informative discussions, it would allow people to comment on individual topics without intruding on the layout, and it would free up your Talk page for its usual function. Just a thought!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That means, first and foremost, that in terms of personality, relationships to each other and others, and the way they act in missions, they should be interesting - not necessarily likeable, but interesting. You should also plan for character development of some kind, whether it&#39;s a major change in the character, or simply your team growing to work better together. Again, character development needn&#39;t be positive - my Agent Dafydd gets more and more power-mad as his series goes on, ending in his death (and resurrection).<br><br>Secondarily, or tied into the above, is choosing <i>what</i> you want them to be. There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with having two normal human teenagers/young adults - it&#39;s the classic setup - but you may decide you want something else. Badfic recruits are fairly common, as are characters who just joined up from their home universe, whatever it may be. And the species and background of a character will influence what you do with them.<br><br>The reason I say this is secondary is that it&#39;s all to easy to make a character you think would be awesome - let&#39;s say a Mandalorian bounty hunter who becomes a Jedi, then falls to the Dark Side, gets a cybernetic arm, and then <i>re</i>converts and runs off to join one of the various Force cults dotted around the Galaxy Far Far away - only to discover that you either a) write them as if they were a human teenager, b) make them little more than a textbook of their own backstory, or c) give them so many powers that they never have to work at anything. If you know beforehand that you want to write, say, a fall-and-redemption story, <i>then</i> you can make a character to fit that (in this case, cut out the re-conversion and have her switch straight to the cult, so she can slowly regress to Sith methods before finally being redeemed and remade as a Jedi - or a dead Jedi).<br><br>There are no actual &#39;guidelines&#39;, because everything depends on the writer. What might be an overpowered Mary-Sue in one person&#39;s hands could be incredibly well-written in another&#39;s. Just remember: agents are supposed to have a difficult job, so don&#39;t keep adding on things to make it easier. And be aware that Phobos and Neshomeh <i>will</i> ask you why every single trait exists. ;) (Sorry, guys, but it&#39;s true!)<br><br>And yes, it&#39;s fine to have multiple agent teams. However, given that most people who get Permission end up writing one mission and then vanishing off the face of the Board, it might be better to start with one to avoid overloading yourself. :D<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I feel I should continue to flesh out these characters before I pitch an idea or ask for permission. As of now, though,it&#39;s looking like I&#39;ll try make a well-rounded Argonian character, and <i>maybe</i> a human partner for him/her. I find it easier to have a couple characters that can make jokes and play off of each other but, like you said, overloading myself may be an issue, and I do not want to have agents I never write or just ignore. <br><br>Another question, if I am not bothering you, how <i>does</i> one co-write a mission? Do the authors just type things up and send it back and fourth? Or is it more like a roleplay?</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re writing by yourself (which is the norm), you kind of need two agents. Otherwise your mission ends up entirely silent. I was talking about the idea of making multiple agent teams right off the bat when I mentioned overdoing it.<br><br>As to cowrites... I&#39;ve had multiple co-authors, and we did them all different ways. With Selene&#39;s original author, we took turns writing the missions, then sent them over to the other person to be checked. With Vemi, on The Reorganisation, we took alternate scenes to write. With Kaitlyn, we wrote alternate lines in an instant messaging program. With Neshomeh and kippur, each person wrote a paragraph at a time, usually in rotation, but sometimes jumping out of order. With the people I&#39;ve got missions ongoing with now, we&#39;ve got a Google Doc which everyone writes in anywhere and anytime they please - but mostly at the end of the story, to continue it. And the one I&#39;ve never done: Jay and Acacia seem to have written by roleplaying the mission over AIM, then having one of them turn it into a story.<br><br>So, basically - however works best for you. GDocs are quite useful because you can see everything that&#39;s already been done, and also leave comments if you have a question - but there are myriad options.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Alright. What if, for their home continuum, it&#39;s the norm to have multicolored hair? I&#39;m not talking rainbows everywhere, just two or so colors? (I pictured something like my agent disliking it and dying her hair one solid color anyway.)</p>

            <p>And, again to make sure I don&#39;t screw up, is it possible for a character that comes from a continuum like that to take on a human form upon joining the PPC? Or maybe through the use of a Disguise Generator?</p>

            <p>There are plenty of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic#Agents_Native_to_Equestria">pony agents</a> at this point, and they&#39;ve all kept their four-legged forms and seem to get along just fine.

            <p>I was unaware of that. Thanks for the link. Though, my reason was a bit more along the lines of it being her preference to be in a human form. I feel like, coming as a bit character from a badfic and looking close to a main character, she would try her best to avoid remembering it, or, at least, to avoid resembling it. Also, due to her personality, I think she&#39;d probably feel like people would respect her more as a human, and almost stops identifying as a pony all together as she tries to learn more about who she is and her likes and dislikes. <br><br>Kinda wanting to name her Penchant. </p>

            <p>Though a few details should be considered: a Disguise Generator only works in conjunction with the RC console, so the forms created by it would only be in use for missions, and the disguises formed by the Disguise Generator are non-permanent, and fade if they are shorted out, the mission ends, or the form is interrupted by an alteration device like the D.O.R.K.S.<br><br>Would the pony agent wish to be in human form permanently, or only for certain kinds of interactions? Because if it&#39;s the second, the D.O.R.K.S. is capable of keeping the user in the new form, even outside of a mission, for a sizable period of time, but it can occasionally prove subject to the Narrative Laws of Comedy, so it wouldn&#39;t be a permanent solution unless the pony minds the disguise dropping or shifting at inopportune moments because he or she angered the Ironic Overpower.<br><br>If the pony wanted to take humanoid form permanently, however, there is an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1AJW8BxCqU1tqiWo-uXLXQcXXGMqXlneWbIfBrjTIo8k&amp;pli=1">arm-mounted device</a> that allows a non-humanoid being to assume a human appearance indefinitely, with the human shape counting as the wearer&#39;s &quot;natural&quot; form for the purposes of the disguise generator. Well, the device is arm-mounted while the wearer is in human form, anyway. Its first known wearer didn&#39;t have arms, and probably wore it on a wing-tentacle. A pony would most likely need to wear it on a foreleg. The device doesn&#39;t have a name, but you could give it one, if you wanted to use it.</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ll go with the use of the D.O.R.K.S. I like the idea of her changing forms at the most inoportune times. Coupled with her no-nonsense attitude, I think it would be funny to have her explaining something, them just switch forms and be taken as a joke after by who she was talking to; &quot;Yes, I realize I&#39;m now a candy-colored equine, but I- Would you please stop laughing!?&quot;</p>

            <p>It can be, for the all-important Rule of Funny, but most of the time, when PPC technology starts malfunctioning, there&#39;s a reason for it, even if it&#39;s something like &quot;I expressed confidence in my ability to use this device indefinitely and the Ironic Overpower took that as a challenge&quot; that would sound completely bonkers out of context. I don&#39;t know the setup for the situation you mentioned, though, so I might just be looking too much into it. Maybe it occurs when the pony is new to bipedalism, and she ends up sitting on her concealed D.O.R.K.S. while trying to make herself more comfortable. There&#39;s a certain logic to that, as far as logic goes in a situation where a pastel pony is trying to look like a bipedal hominid by using a shapeshifting-assistance device that often masquerades itself as a rubber chicken or other such almost-always-out-of-place implement to avoid suspicious gazes.</p>

            <p>Is that the D.O.R.K.S. is capable of keeping <i>people</i> disguised very well, most of the time, but it was its <i>own</i> disguise field that would shift at random. In fact, the section you posted supports that, and possibly may have inspired it, with Jay&#39;s question &quot;So, it&#39;s a disguise device that can disguise everything but itself?&quot;<br><br>In-universe, it might be because the D.O.R.K.S. is not as good at disguising objects as it is at disguising beings, but metatextually, it&#39;s probably because it would be funny seeing an armored Uruk-hai messing with a rubber chicken to change his shape, only to swear under his breath once said rubber chicken turns into a piece of cake and falls between his hands to hit the ground with a splat.</p>

            <p>... suggesting that it would change the user&#39;s disguise?

            <p>I didn&#39;t mean to imply that the disguises by the D.O.R.K.S. would drop or shift without warning, the way the D.O.R.K.S.&#39;s own field does. It would just be difficult to handle, especially for someone using it indefinitely, in part since the device wouldn&#39;t have been designed to permanently lock the user in one shape. The part about the Narrative Laws of Comedy was because, well, the D.O.R.K.S. is PPC-created technology, and PPC-created technology will work, and work very well, until it would be more humorous or dramatic or awkward for someone to sit on it wrong or overload it accidentally or push the wrong button. I hadn&#39;t meant to imply that it would just spontaneously quit working or suddenly turn someone into a moose as they walk down a hallway. Nobody would ever approve something that unpredictable for field use.</p>

            <p>So I honestly can&#39;t say. All the information I have, from this thread at least, is &quot;she has multicolored hair&quot;, &quot;she has a no-nonsense attitude&quot;, and &quot;she likes taking human form&quot;. It&#39;s hard to judge on little information, and out of the three pieces of information there, only one, the latter, can really extrapolate much about her character, and that&#39;s only though more questions. Does she take human form because she doesn&#39;t self-identify as a pony? Does she think that her fellow PPC Agents will treat her better if she looks human? Is it because she likes to feel taller?<br><br>What are some of her other traits?<br>Also, was she going to be the partner for the Argonian you mentioned earlier? I&#39;m just trying to keep my information straight.</p>

            <p>When I eventually request permission, these are the agents I plan on using. So I was wondering what people thought of them, and if anyone would be willing to give some pointers.<br><br>Ezekiel Browne<br>Brief Description:<br>Ezekiel joined the PPC on a dare, not thinking the Organization would actually accept him. He has a wide knowledge of various canons, serving as the team’s provider of canon info. Ezekiel very rarely gets exicted about anything, causing people to sometimes think he is a stoner. The only time when he does get excited is when he gets mad. He has a temper unmatched by anyone, and will mostly come out when a canon that is very dear to him is violated. <br><br>The Looker<br>Brief Description:<br>A Time Lord who has preferred to be an observer in the past, malfunction in his TARDIS has prompted him to join the PPC. Currently in his second incarnation, he displays the Time Lord’s trademark intelligence, but he has very little patience with other people. He can be extremely snarky, cynical, and sarcastic. Spends most of his free time trying to repair his TARDIS.<br><br>Erik Long<br>Brief Description:<br>Inspired to join the PPC after reading The Death of Nick, Erik desperately wants to become the best that he possibly can at everything he does. But he is held back only by his own incompetence. He is rather slow to fully understand things, and prefers for things to be simple. He takes great enjoyment in acting silly, much to The Looker’s annoyance. Despite his short comings, he is very determined to get the job done, and holds his friends highly (even The Looker).<br><br>Please tell me what you think.</p>

            <p>Just like DrMarble,  I would like for some criticism on my would-be agents. Would that be alright?<br><br>Agent Catharsis<br><br>Home continuum: Fire Emblem 8<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Personality: Catharsis is intelligent and kind (a bit too kind for a PPC agent), with a large number of neuroses and a rather weak stomach. He is the saner half of the duo. He is easily nauseated, disgusted and disturbed by badfic shenanigans, and has a paranoid fear of humanoid abominations. In spite of this, he is determined to do what he considers the right thing. <br><br>Backstory: Catharsis was a random badfic mook who had the fortune of not being slaughtered by monsters. He fell into a plothole straight into the Cafeteria floor face-first and no one took notice. He wandered about until he ended up in one of the Flowers&#39; offices, where he was assigned to RC#7149 without even the slightest of PPC training.<br><br>Skills/Traits: As a FE8 Druid, he is capable of using Dark magic and Anima, or Element magic along with the ability to use staves. He also has an absurd magic resistance. However, due to lack of training, he is nearly clueless on modern technology.<br><br>--<br><br>Agent Jackets<br><br>Home continuum: World 1 - Yugioh GX<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Personality: Jackets is a jumpy, temperamental, absent-minded introvert with a nigh-insatiable thirst for knowledge and a fondness for body horror. She is not easily disgusted by badfic biology due to said fondness for body horror. However, she is easily annoyed by other badfic shenanigans, especially if they involved her Lust Object. She also has self-esteem issues and apologizes a lot.<br><br>Backstory: Jackets was a college student who has found herself walking straight into the middle of a YGO GX badfic. There, she spent most of her time trying to help her Lust Object find his real students and avoid getting herself killed by PPC agents. <br><br>She was rescued by the PPC, but instead of returning to World 1, she joined the PPC as a chance to save the Yugioh GX Word World from badfic mayhem (and learn something along the way).<br><br>Skills: Jackets has a good grasp of Yugioh GX canon, especially that of the first two seasons, and knows a number of other canons too. She uses a Different Dimension deck when she duels - usually to distract the target. Also, her devotion to her Lust Object has made her well-versed in RL alchemy and obscure references. She has absolutely no sense of direction though.<br><br>----<br><br>Sorry for hijacking your thread, DrMarble. I don&#39;t want to start a new thread, and I have no idea where to put it.</p>

            <p>What exactly would these two be doing? You didn&#39;t mention a department or specialization, which would have been fine in most cases, but some of the pieces of information, without that context, just made me wonder how significant they were or would be. Details like the sort of Yu-Gi-Oh deck Jackets uses, for example. Is she going to be using that deck a lot in the missions? Is she planning on setting up a competitive card-playing league in the PPC? Her section mentioned that she was specifically wanting to protect the Yu-Gi-Oh continuum, which might have indicated that her dueling proficiency was due to a role in the All-Purpose Department, but since Catharsis apparently was assigned to her from a non-card-game-based continuum with no training or conditioning, which is in itself a little confusing because a PPC Agent would normally at least have a little time in conditioning to pick up fandoms and see what sorts of people they will be incapable of working with, that can&#39;t be the case.<br><br>Does Jackets have a second name? &quot;Jackets&quot; could be a first name, a last name, a nickname, a codename, or an assumed name, but it doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s a full given name, at least for a human from Earth. Is there another name we&#39;re missing? And if so, what is it, if you&#39;ve decided on it?<br><br>Would Catharsis see Mary Sues and the higher-level wraiths as &quot;humanoid abominations&quot;? They can warp time and space to their whims, they possess impossible powers, and they alter the minds of anyone around them, and yet oftentimes look more or less human. That seems pretty aberrant to me.<br>If he wouldn&#39;t, what sort of creatures is he afraid of?<br><br>What is RL alchemy? Is it something within the Yu-Gi-Oh continuum, or something connected to Jackets&#39;s time on World One, or something connected to avoiding what seems to have been a number of character replacements in the badfic? (I was never very good with acronyms.)<br><br>Would Catharsis&#39;s magic resistance only apply to Fire Emblem magic sources, or would it work in other continua as well? What&#39;s the extent of his resistance, or to put it differently, what exactly can his resistance do? Can it only absorb attacks, can it only penetrate defenses, is he invisible to magical detection, is it cumulative or does his resistance calculate the magical resistance new after each new magical source it encounters, etcetera. Magical resilience can either be incredibly overpowered or almost useless depending on its limits.<br>Actually, this could combine with the potential fear of Mary Sues, if he&#39;s powerful enough to soak the sparkly attacks of an oppressor, but he&#39;s too terrified of getting near a live Sue to try. That would need work, though... and I&#39;m rambling. That&#39;s probably a good enough number of questions for now.<br><br>Postscript: Thread-hijacking is fine, especially when it&#39;s an extension of the topic the thread was already discussing, which this is. Don&#39;t feel bad about it. It&#39;s always best to keep potential redundancies down, since it keeps the older threads on the front page longer.</p>

            <p>Ah, sorry about that.<br><br>I was planning to create a badly understaffed and mis-matched Yugioh All-Purpose Department. Catharsis is there as an outsider unfamiliar to the Yugioh continua to Lampshade (sorry about the term) just how ridiculous the some of its tropes and trends can be. I&#39;ll probably change the untrained part to trained, but still adjusting to everything. Thanks for pointing that out.<br><br>She is not a professional duelist, and is rather mediocre at best. She duels for the fun of it, and may or may not nag other Agents for a game or two. She will often challenge the target to a duel to stall, distract and list charges while Catharsis takes the kill.<br><br>Jackets owns a lot of jackets. She does not want to use her old name anymore, so she uses that ridiculous nickname instead.<br><br>Catharsis is afraid of Sues, wraiths and some non-human humanoid Agents. He&#39;s also afraid of zombies. He&#39;s probably afraid of Wobbles the Clown too. He just sucks it up and carries on.<br><br>RL alchemy is real life alchemy (sorry about the acronym), seeing that there are lots of continua that have different forms of alchemy. Fullmetal Alchemist comes strongly to mind here. Yugioh GX, her specialty, is chock-full of alchemy references and other obscure references if one squints hard enough. Whether or not her knowledge may be relevant would still be known.<br><br>As for Catharsis&#39; magic resistance, it&#39;s absurd by FE standards. He can withstand fireballs and lightning strikes to the face, but the stronger spells may do some damage to him. It&#39;s something I added in case the mission they wind up in goes awry, since a lot of Yugioh badfics I encounter have overpowered magic in them. In fact, I added Catharsis simply because of Yugioh&#39;s magic.<br></p>

            <p>Since I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about Time Lords of late, some questions:<br><br>-Why a Time Lord? There are countless other species with &#39;trademark intelligence&#39;, so why do you want a Time Lord? (I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t - but it&#39;s best to have a reason beyond &#39;Time Lords are cool now&#39;)<br><br>-Why doesn&#39;t he use his name? You say he &#39;has preferred to be an observer in the past&#39;, which ties in very nicely with the Time Lord cultural tendency to sit on Gallifrey and practice non-interference. Most Time Lords still on Gallifrey use either their name (Borusa, Romana, Rassilon, Flavia, etc etc etc), or an actual official title (the Castellan - and even then, two of the three known Castellans used their names too). So what caused your Time Lord to reject his name? It seems to be a fairly common habit for renegades - but yours clearly fits the profile of a non-renegade.<br><br>-Which leads to: why does he have a TARDIS? They&#39;re not actually handed out left, right, and centre, y&#39;know. Time Lords don&#39;t usually leave Gallifrey. When they do, they&#39;re either on some sort of mission for the High Council - in which case I assume they get a stock TARDIS from the docks - or they&#39;re a renegade, in which case they usually steal one (see: the Doctor). Since your Time Lord&#39;s personality isn&#39;t that of a renegade - why is he one?<br><br>A suggestion/question/theory: what happens when you try to fly a TARDIS out of a time-locked series of events? We know you can&#39;t actually escape to the outside universe - otherwise there would be as many &#39;last of the Time Lords&#39;es as there were TARDISes on Gallifrey. Do you just loop back round? Or is there a chance that you jump continuums entirely - and end up in another universe, a fictional universe, where you attract the attention of the PPC? I can&#39;t imagine that would be very good for your TARDIS.<br><br>If I&#39;m reading your Time Lord right, the idea of him being on Gallifrey up until the Time War - and then stealing a TARDIS and running for it - would fit well. It still wouldn&#39;t explain why he doesn&#39;t use his name, though; I&#39;ll wait for your answer on that one. And the others, of course: I&#39;m just theorising, not writing your backstory for you.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>A Time Lord in trouble or hoping to dodge the Time War nabs a TARDIS and runs for it, but ends up accidentally jumping continua, wrecking the machine and having to explain what happened when some very alarmed PPC agents eventually show up to investigate?

I want to say Tawaki&#39;s spinoff? Ah well, just some idle thoughts. It&#39;ll be interesting to see where the Looker goes though.</p>

            <p>I probably should have alaborated. By &quot;observor&quot; I meant the he was more like a tourist. Drop in, snap a photo, then buzz off. He doesnt interfere, but he is still technacly a renegade. He was wasnt even involved in the Time War.<br><br>Him being a Time Lord is because of two reasons; 1.

            <p>Given their performance in past stories, I&#39;m pretty sure the Time Lords on Gallifrey are able to remotely view most of the universe.

            <p>Maybe some people might think that important landmarks look the same on television as they do when said landmarks are right in front of them, but others would want to directly experience whatever force it is that leads people to stare appreciatively at large monuments and geological formations in the first place. Maybe the Looker would have observed locations across the universe on the Gallifreyan version of the Discovery Channel, but decided he was tired of watching remote recordings and wanted to see the interesting parts of time and space in person.<br><br>Plus, a time-machine tourist would be able to find the most interesting eras of any locale. Why visit the ruins of an old jousting arena when you can go back in time a few centuries and watch people knock each other off of horses in front of you? Why stare at a field that will one day house the world&#39;s largest display of underwater art when you can go into the future and appear right before the ticket prices go up?</p>

            <p>Yes, visiting the real deal is better - but, most of the time, people don&#39;t.

From all we know, you&#39;re either given one for official reasons, or you steal one. It would be like... oh... breaking through the Berlin Wall to go and look at Paris.

            <p>Feel free to use this or not, depending on how you want the character to go.<br><br>You say a TARDIS is either given for official reasons or stolen. Seeing as staling a TARDIS would be rather difficult, and not fitting with how I am visualizing the Looker based off of the information given to me, this leaves only one option: make it for an official purpose. Make the Looker a journalist of sorts, an observer. <br><br>If the Time Lords are supposed to maintain the flow of Time, then having somebody fly around to assorted locations and eras to have a closer look at the goings-on of the universe may well be a reasonable expense. The Looker is sent as the main explorer, going onto planets and into eras, but not interfering, simply taking notes/letting the TARDIS make scans. That way, Gallifrey has somebody doing micro scans of the Time-Space Continuum, and the Looker gets to travel more or less where he wants.<br><br>From there, any assortment of things can happen where the Looker ends up in HQ. Plothole opens up in the Time Vortex; TARDIS crash lands in a badfic; TARDIS materializes in HQ for seemingly no bloody reason; Looker falls into plothole Gallifrey told him to examine, what have you. Again, this is just a suggestion, do with your character what you will.</p>

            <p>Just a few things. Overall it looks like a good base, but you&#39;ll need to give each agent more depth really.<br><br>1) what world&#39;s/continua are Ezekiel and Erik from, Ezekiel sounds from his description like he&#39;s from World one, but his name sounds like something out of Warhammer 40k (actually, just checked, it is the name of a character in 40k). <br>2) I&#39;d temper down Ezekiel&#39;s anger (pun fully intended), rather than it being &#39;unmatched by anyone&#39; just have him get very angry or something like that, &#39;unmatched by anyone&#39; sounds a bit OP and maybe Sueish.<br>3) &quot;The Death of Nick&quot;? Maybe it&#39;s for the better but I haven&#39;t heard of it.   <br>4) Just a query, but 3 Agents? I assume you&#39;ll have them working as one group. <br></p>

            <p>The more characters you have, the more difficult it is to balance the story and keep things moving. Two agents is standard because it allows for personalities to bounce off each other, providing opportunities for storytelling, humor, and exposition that are hard to come by with just one agent. With three, though, you&#39;ve got one more person who needs lines, one more person who needs description, one more person who needs a chance to do something significant, etc. Each additional person increases your wordcount—and they should, because if they aren&#39;t doing anything worth writing about, what&#39;s the point of them even being there? But the risk is that the inflated wordcount will drag the mission out longer than it needs to be and kill the pacing without necessarily adding anything that couldn&#39;t be accomplished with just two characters.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t do it.

            <p>Right. There are four - well, five - things we look for in a Permission Requester (is that a term? That&#39;s not a term).<br><br>-Interaction. Have you spent time getting to know the community? Er, yes, yes you have. No more to say there.<br><br>-Understanding of the PPC canon. Well, you know about Nursery (and that it&#39;s part of Operations), and the character of the Marquis (or current character, I should say - apparently J&amp;A wrote him differently). I&#39;m going to say yes to this one, too, on general evidence.<br><br>-The badfic (this is sort of a secondary check). It&#39;s not something I&#39;d choose to take myself, and I&#39;m about 85% sure it&#39;s a troll, but it&#39;s certainly a bad fic. If you think you can find the humour to make it worth a mission (remember, it&#39;s &#39;worth writing a mission&#39;, <i>not</i> &#39;worth killing&#39;; lots of things deserve to die, but wouldn&#39;t be funny to read about), then I guess it&#39;s an okay choice.<br><br>-The agents. You already know I like the Notary; I also like Wobbles, though she&#39;s making me want to make a full schedule for Nursery TV, with pictures (<a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndNursery.htm">I was the first person to mention it</a>). So I think they&#39;re good, too (and Dresden&#39;s Disease makes me snort).<br><br>-The writing sample. This is the one I&#39;m not so sure on. SPG is fine, of course. Your description seems okay, and character motivation seems to work too. The only concern I really have is that it reads like you&#39;re making massive changes to canon - and I have no idea whether it works, because it&#39;s not my fandom.<br><br>But... eh, no-one ever said this job would be simple.<br><br>I&#39;m going to say <b>Permission Granted</b>, with the obvious proviso that - just like everyone else in the entire PPC - if you misinterpret or change something in the PPC canon, and people don&#39;t like it, you should be willing to edit your story to fit (as I keep doing, most recently when I had to give Admiral Pansy his accent back). But other than that - have fun!<br><br>Also, I guess this means the Spinel Promotor is a full member of the Continuity Council. Greeeeeeat... (Sorry, Morgan got in again there)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll get right to it!<br><br>On the subject of the fic: the reason it reads like that isn&#39;t so much because I made <i>changes</i> to MLP canon as expanded on it. Earth pony backstory just... kinda gets ignored a bit, at least during series 1 and 2, during which time this fic was written. The stuff about trees comes from druidic traditions of worship, which I felt was fitting considering the material for the crossover is a folk song, and I tried to make it all hang together like the showrunners did. Hopefully I suuceeded, Iunno, but it did get featured on Equestria Daily so it can&#39;t be all bad.<br><br>I&#39;m probably going to need a lot of help with this; first times always suck, in my experience. If anyone&#39;s willing to beta the Clown Girl and Time Lord Power Hour, I&#39;d really appreciate it. =]<br><br>--parp</p>

            <p>On the subject of the Nursery: Wobbles is not going to be too involved in it on-camera, as it were; rather, it&#39;s going to be backstory and an aid to character development. If the opportunity arises to use one of these characters then rest assured I will, but Wobbles&#39; relationship to the Nursery is not essential to her character. What <i>is</i>, on the other hand, is represented by her relationship to the Nursery; she is one of the most loving, positive people you&#39;re likely to meet, and she cares deeply for children.<br><br>So what she&#39;ll make of -this- fic remains to be seen...</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read the story and I like it so far. It flows well and is easy to follow.<br>Keep in mind that I don&#39;t know anything about Bakugan and only the litte rest I remember from playing the games about Pokemon, so I might not be the best judge of canonical accuracy. Even though, I think you did a good job of describing the locations and characters, as I could envision them pretty clearly.<br>I&#39;ll make sure to continue reading this fanfic.</p>

            <p>They say, &quot;The more, the merrier,&quot; but whoa!<br><br>Either way, a few preliminaries. To all three of you, welcome to the PPC! A few words on terminology (this is mainly for RinaAndRanda, but you may also benefit from this, Drama<em>Twist):<br>By introducing yourselves on the Board, you are now members of the PPC. However, you are <i>not</i> Agents. You, the human behind the computer, are a Boarder. The characters that you will eventually write once you <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">gain Permission</a>, that is, the ones who will be going into the Word Worlds, are the Agents.<br><br>Also, RinaAndRanda, I&#39;ll reiterate that it would be best if you introduced yourselves in a separate post. Even though some people have already welcomed you here, it would still be a good idea to create a new post so that it is clear to people who may be showing up after today that three newbies joined, not just one.<br><br>That said, off to the newbie gifts:<br><br>For Drama</em>Twist,<br>*rummages through bag of holding*<br>you can have this Muggle-Use Wand! Just be careful what/whom you point it at!<br><br>For Rina and Randa...<br>*rummages through bag of holding*<br>hmmm, what to give?<br><br>*rummages some more*<br>Aha!<br><br>*pulls out two Poke Balls*<br>One of these Poke Balls has a Shiny <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ariados">Ariados</a>. If either of you like Aragog, then this is for you.<br>The other one has a <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rapidash">Rapidash</a>, a/k/a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu5kxTlQSpk">Angry Twilight Sparkle</a>.<br>I&#39;ll leave it to you to decide who takes which Pokemon.<br><br>Enjoy the craziness that is the PPC!</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a while since that last happened! Welcome to the Board, Drama<em>Twist and artemis.hunt! Normally, I&#39;d send posts like this to you individually, but since I&#39;d be repeating myself, I&#39;ll just address you both simultaneously.<br><br>What have you read so far? The <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS">Original Series</a>? Any spin-offs? And if you have read some spin-offs, which is your favorite?<br><br>What are your fandoms? Any preferred book series, television shows, or video games? Telling us your fandoms helps us get to know you a little better, and can also give the Boarders an idea of what sort of gifts to bring you.<br><br>And to top this sequence off, &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC</a></em>Constitution&quot;&gt;have a link to the wiki</a>! That particular link leads to a copy of the Constitution, which details the rules of the Board, but the wiki has information on practically everything in the PPC Multiverse, so it&#39;s a good way to find new spin-offs and learn about how everything works here.<br><br>Now for gifts! You both can have one mysteriously levitating glowing sphere each, with the color or pattern of your choice! They look cool, can expand or contract at a mental command, and are practically indestructible, but don&#39;t try and push one down to make contact with the ground. The results won&#39;t be pretty.</p>

            <p>(I&#39;m artemis.hunt, by the way. Sorry about that, I&#39;m still getting used to the posting system... Hehe...)<br>Rina here! I&#39;m probably going to be the main poster on the Board, since my buddy Randa and I are joint-teaming in the event that we become Agents (and while Randa is an excellent writer, she prefers drawing. The task of writing will eventually fall to me.).<br>So far, Randa and I have read the Original Series and I&#39;m currently spending a snow day reading through the Wiki (wow, it&#39;s kind of like TV Tropes: once you start reading, you can&#39;t seem to stop!). No idea what Randa&#39;s up to at the moment, since her phone is being catatonic/narcoleptic and shuts down randomly. Fun stuff.<br>We&#39;re hoping to become Assassins in the Harry Potter fandom, but we could also delve into Percy Jackson, LotR, My Little Pony, and (if absolutely necessary) Doctor Who. Though the Whoniverse might not be ready for me. I&#39;m a fairly new Whovian, and since Randa isn&#39;t a fan, it probably wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to tackle anything from there.<br>Ooh, pretty orbs! What happens if you make it touch the ground? Does it explode? I like explosions- *moves to push one to the ground*<br>Randa: *pushes Rina out of the way* I&#39;m not letting your Attention Deficit OOH SHINY kill me!<br>Rina: *sulks* <br>Randa: *eyeing the orbs* How about the one with the Hufflepuff crest?<br>Rina: I would say Gryffindor, but... How about just the black and bronze one? That one looks cool...</p>

            <p>Randa here!<br>We might get individual accounts eventually, but Rina&#39;s got better internet access. And she checks these posts kinda obsessively. <br>I dot think it&#39;s ~too~ inconvenient to have to say who&#39;s speaking, but if it gets on anybody&#39;s nerves, I&#39;ll get my own account. <br>It&#39;s probably better if Rina didn&#39;t get her own orb. If someone tells her to NOT do something, she&#39;ll try to do it just to see what&#39;ll happen.</p>

            <p>(Rina here.)<br>Oh, sweet! Potato cannons! These&#39;ll go great with my marshmallow gun I made in fourth grade! Now to modify these so they&#39;ll shoot Sporks... *scuttles off* Aw man... Now I have to figure out how to get these to Randa... She&#39;ll murder me if she doesn&#39;t get a potato gun.

            <p>Hello Rina, and welcome to the PPC! I made a lot of mistakes when I first joined, so I&#39;d just like to help you so you don&#39;t make the same ones.<br><br>First, post an entirely new message thread introducing yourself. E.g., your fandoms what you like. Not many people think to read these little posts that are in threads.<br>And you should read the FAQ for Newbies, as well as look about the Wiki. <br>A big bit is to read the Original Series. Even if you don&#39;t know Lord f the Rings, it&#39;s still pretty good.<br>The links to these thins are in the top section.<br><p><br>And by the way, you&#39;re pretty much a full member now. We don&#39;t really judge people by &quot;full&quot;. Just be helpful, and you will be liked by many.<br>May I present you with your first, diamond encrusted spork.<br>~Kitty ^_^</p></p>
