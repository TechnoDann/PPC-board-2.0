            <p>Yes, we&#39;re closing rapidly on it: the London 2014 Gathering is only a week away. So this is your final reminder and information post.<br><br>WHEN: Saturday 16th August 2014, 12 noon (though at least a few people will probably be there early). We&#39;ll be spending 3-4 hours wandering around, so that we can all get back on the trains in time to avoid the post-football, post-work rush.<br><br>WHERE: The <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">British Museum</a>. The meeting place is <a href="http://s66.photobucket.com/user/TangledWebs/media/BMColumn.jpg.html">the first column on the left of the main steps</a>. You can walk to the Museum from <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=260321;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">pretty much any Underground line</a>.<br><br>WHO: Anyone and everyone! We have about half a dozen people who&#39;ve said they&#39;re going, but any member of the PPC community is welcome. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;ve been here eleven years (as Kaitlyn has) or eleven days - you&#39;re invited. (And yes, you can bring parents along if that&#39;s an issue for you - we&#39;ve had a few very helpful parental tagalongs in the past)<br><br>WHAT you should bring: The British Museum is free entry, but if you want anything from the shops, they (obviously) cost money. Since we&#39;re meeting around lunchtime, you&#39;re probably best to bring a packed lunch or eat on the way - the Museum has <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/visiting/eating.aspx">a couple of cafes</a>, with one being a sandwich shop, but they&#39;re liable to be busy. Finding a spot to eat is as simple as choosing a corner of the floor. You should bring a camera if you have one, since there&#39;s usually lots of photo opportunities. We may also end up wandering down to the markets in Covent Garden, so again, if you want to buy anything, bring cash. Ehm... the weather report, for what it&#39;s worth, suggests it won&#39;t be raining, so that&#39;s nice.<br><br>WHY: Because it&#39;s fun! Past Gatherings have led to mass impressions of Gandalf, Mary-Sue spotting, wielding actual swords, locating missing Flowers, turning geese into Intel agents... and hours and hours of talk among people who have at least one very strange interest in common.<br><br>And... I think that&#39;s it! See you all there!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>No? No. All right.<br><br>As Phobos says, it&#39;s really up to the person in question. I tend to go by either my real name or hS, because no-one knows how to say &#39;Huinesoron&#39;, and four syllables is overkill regardless. From memory, a lot of the older Gatherings were heavy on the real names - probably because at the time, most of the PPC was on Livejournal, so we &#39;knew&#39; each other beyond the Board. In more recent times, we&#39;ve gravitated towards usernames, possibly because that&#39;s no longer the case. But at the beginning of the day, it&#39;s up to you.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Some combination of all of the above.  Honestly, most of it will be usernames, but some Boarders know each other better than others.  Older Than Thou might call Oaken Thorinshield &quot;Janet&quot; because they know each other pretty well.  In other instances, it could be a case of &quot;Hi.  I&#39;m Oaken Thorinshield, but you can call me Janet.&quot;  It all comes down to personal preference.  For instance, my name is Derrick and I don&#39;t really care if the internet-at-large knows that.  Others are more cautious.<br><br>hS, please feel free to correct me if I am mistaken on that.  Also, did Oaken have a real name before this?  If so, she probably isn&#39;t happy with me telling people to call her Janet.<br><br>-Sir, Mr, Dr, Rev Derrick Phobos, the Betraying Betrayer Who Betrays</p>

            <p>Sorry I didn&#39;t respond before - my computer fried and I&#39;m only online now thanks to my mum letting me borrow hers until replacement is affordable.

            <p>I think I might have seen someone point a CAD at themself to make sure it wasn&#39;t broken... I think DIC stories I&#39;ve read just rely on Intel figuring out what&#39;s being crossed and finding agents who don&#39;t need to take CAD readings.<br><br>I did mention in the &quot;My Little Ponies turn human on Earth&quot; story that an agent wants to rely on observation because &quot;I don&#39;t think the CAD can handle this&quot; and the other agent judged the characters as acting plausibly.

            <p>... there is no precedent to using a CAD to identify someone&#39;s canon-of-origin. There may be evidence to indicate that it can&#39;t be done, per the Wiki article &#39;CAD&#39;.

            <p>What would happen if an unrecognized canon dropped through a plothole and was accepted as an agent?  I think I&#39;ve seen that somehow it&#39;s important for Boromir to have his canonical death and remain dead in the story, not just make everyone think he&#39;s dead.

            <p>Personally, I think the only distinction between World One and any other version of Earth is just that WO is &quot;closer,&quot; in the sense that a disproportionate amount of agents come from there.  I don&#39;t think it would feel particularly different from the majority of other (non urban fantasy) versions of Earth to most characters.<br><br>Honestly, if you&#39;re getting confused about &quot;World One,&quot; you&#39;re overthinking it.  The very concept of &quot;World One&quot; is just a placeholder name so we, and &quot;RealWorld&quot; agents, can talk about the so-called &quot;Real World&quot; without confusing/insulting a Narnian agent, who would see Narnia as the &quot;Real World.&quot;<br><br>If you&#39;re wanting to do Despatch-style missions (I think that was you, yes?  Apologies if I&#39;m wrong.), then you don&#39;t necessarily need to depict World One.  You can just send the author avatar through a portal, or whatever.  You also don&#39;t necessarily need to say the self insert is even from World One, depending on what the fic allows.  The fic in my second mission is (in reality) a Mary Sue story written in the real world about the <i>Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> continuum.  However, for the mission, which I&#39;ll link to below, I instead chose to treat the story as a Despatch-style situation, where the author was a (modern-day) inhabitant of the AoSH continuum, who created a story with herself as self-insert, which let her go back in time to visit Holmes.  I was able to this because the insert never refers to Holmes and the other characters as fictional.  She is surprised to see them, but only how-did-I-get-here surprised, not this-has-mind-destroying-existential-repercussions surprised.  She also claims to be from the future, not from another world where Holmes is fictional.  Obviously, something like this depends on the fic you&#39;re missioning.  Here&#39;s that mission:<br><br><a href="http://doctorlit.dreamwidth.org/3091.html"><a href="http://doctorlit.dreamwidth.org/3091.html">http://doctorlit.dreamwidth.org/3091.html</a></a><br><br>Um.  Sorry.  This post got kind of long.  I hope I&#39;ve at least answered something.  Is there anything I can make more clear?</p>

            <p>I know there is a Megamind fanfiction about 9/11... And I think the MIB cartoon addressed it...<br><br>Basically I&#39;m thinking that there are fictional worlds where nothing significant happened on September 11 of 2001.  (Obviously this is only remarkable in continua that were both published and set afterwards, and there are probably only a few examples that actually address it directly.)<br><br>My point is that some worlds are defined by what did happen and what didn&#39;t.  Biggest problem with SuperWhoLock is that Watson didn&#39;t mention hearing about whatever Supernatural happened that the world should have noticed.<br><br>If you have to interview someone to see what world that they&#39;re from, you could probably ask about significant events to get an answer.</p>

            <p>(Since I&#39;m the person who invented the designation &#39;World One&#39;, I suppose I&#39;m the best qualified to comment...)<br><br>The &#39;World-number&#39; designations were instituted by the Weeds, while they were <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14DK_aHTbwkUOx9jhYT0ZF3UZm-5BjrJBS24_slVUGKI/pub">off exploring the Cascade</a>. Their mapping led to the creation or definition of doors into HQ and the extended Cascade (scroll down to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uyY7ugbeCepIb_VirsCPh-OeWV8kNukM1YxxWilDLwg/pub">&#39;Relative Dimensions&#39;</a> for the complexity of what, exactly, HQ is), and those doors are numbered.<br><br>The numbering system for the doors is world-country (or other sub-unit)-number. So, door <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/1-Cym-3">1-Cym-3</a> is World One - Cymru (Wales - they use the local name) - Door number three, indicating there are at least two other Welsh doors. Other known designations include <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/CrashPart7.htm#chapter12">1-Sch-2</a> (Switzerland, World One - this door opens into HQ near the Department of Finance), and 2093-Ann-2, where World 2093 is the world of Minecraft, and &#39;Ann&#39; is the savefile name (Annuminas, in this case). The story behind that door will no doubt be posted in the fullness of time.<br><br>So why is World One... World One? Quite simply, because it&#39;s the first universe (&#39;World&#39; is a misnomer; the entirety of, say, <i>Star Wars</i> has a single &#39;World&#39; number) the Weeds had occasion to catalogue - in other words, it&#39;s the universe they started in; the universe of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AEV3AzOwIUBthn15a28tXCvvR4qgdpKIzS5yysSfqho/pub">Origin</a> and the &#39;Real World&#39;.<br><br>And it is special. As far as the Flowers are aware, it&#39;s the only universe in what we term the Prime Multiverse which <i>isn&#39;t</i> a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zJUQIvYbQkFOmb4wM3-F7J7s0oywjOu0W7dj42ixApg/pub">Word World</a>. To the best of their knowledge, all non-Word-World planets they&#39;ve opened portals to lead to the same universe - World One. It&#39;s the only universe they know of based on atoms, not words.<br><br>This perspective informs <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uyY7ugbeCepIb_VirsCPh-OeWV8kNukM1YxxWilDLwg/pub">Multiverse Theory</a> (first section). The Prime Multiverse consists of World One - the Real World - surrounded by a bunch of Word Worlds which appear to be created by it. That includes all the alternate versions of Earth - such as Godzilla&#39;s world - and any other fictional worlds, such as Middle-earth. So Godzilla!World would have its own World number, and its own doors (potentially).<br><br>The only non-World One &#39;Atomic Worlds&#39; the PPC knows of are the alternate multiverses described in Multiverse Theory. So the EPC, for instance, has its own &#39;World One&#39;, a non-Word-World which created its own multiverse of Word Worlds (such as the critically acclaimed sci-fi show <i>Master Who</i>). But it&#39;s next to impossible to access those - certainly your standard portal won&#39;t get you anywhere near them.<br><br>Of course, this nice neat Real World &gt; Word Worlds picture breaks down slightly when the details of portals are taken into account... specifically, written portals (which make up every single portal the PPC creates, though a few legacy natural plotholes are still found in the fabric of HQ - they lead to Reality Rooms) are capable of breaking into World One, which the theory says shouldn&#39;t happen; they should only lead to Word Worlds. It&#39;s almost as though the &#39;Real World&#39; is just a fictionalised version of some world where a bunch of people, let&#39;s call them the &#39;PPC Board&#39;, sit around writing stories about the PPC... &lt;<em>&gt;</em>&gt;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My own character, Jumper, is a multiverse traveler who goes from fictional world to fictional world. Here&#39;s the kicker though: that are, indeed, atomic worlds. The difference here is, where Jumper is from, authors/directors/poets/creative individuals, are inspired by real, actual worlds. Authors can create whatever they like, and take as many artistic liberties as they wish, but the Inspiration Worlds do exist. This means that some books are very close to their inspiration world (such as Tolkien&#39;s works, where his works are neigh onto encyclopedias) or drastically different (such as Eragon, which is much more consistent in the Inspiration World). He does come to the PPC, through a type of plot hole, and begins to learn of World Worlds, and how they are different from his Inspiration Worlds.<br><br>Sadly, as I have been extraordinarily lazy recently, he is not part of PPC canon yet. He will be, mark my words, but not yet. This will complicate the PPC multiverse models a little, but make things interesting when I get to writing him and his adventures outside of the PPC. However, first, I have a crossover mission to get onto.</p>

            <p>All right, just one diagram...<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Atom_Word.png"><br><br>This is an out-of-universe compromise theory between current Multiverse Theory, your Inspiration Worlds, and the Sakai/doctorlit &#39;all worlds is reals&#39; idea. Essentially, it goes like this:<br><br>There is the Real World (black). We live in it. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only universe that actually exists, with the others all being fictional constructs. Yuo can believe whatever you like, but at the end of the day, this universe is the <i>only</i> one that can be scientifically verified to exist. It&#39;s also entirely unknown (and unknow<i>able</i>) to the PPC. They can&#39;t interact with it, because any interaction would necessarily involve the &#39;Real World&#39; being written - which would make it actually World One. <br><br>World One (blue) is a fictionalised version of our world. Specifically, it&#39;s the one we as PPC authors have created - one identical to ours in every way except for the fact that plotholes occasionally take people to HQ, agents stop by for visits, fangirls can sometimes break into canon worlds, and there&#39;s a PPC city in New Caledonia. This is the universe the Flowers come from, along with most agents. As far as the Flowers are aware, it&#39;s the only Atomic world.<br><br>Separate from World One, and untouched by the plotholes of the Cascade - in fact, entirely inaccessible to the PPC - are the Inspiration Worlds (light blue). These are also Atomic worlds (though the term is inaccurate - see below), and have their own independent existence. Through some means unexplained by PPC science - because they don&#39;t know it exists - they can form links with World One, allowing authors to create stories.<br><br>Those stories are canons (red). They appear when they&#39;re written, and it&#39;s possible to create multiple canons out of a single Inspiration World: Tolkien&#39;s <i>Book of Lost Tales</i> is a distinct, cohesive canon which is utterly irreconcilable with LotR, yet clearly comes from the same Inspiration World.<br><br>Then there is fanfic. Fanfic is created in much the same way as canons, except that instead of some mystic (pun intended) link, the World One authors are inspired by reading/watching/hearing about the canon. There&#39;s a purely artificial distinction between &#39;fanfic&#39; (green) and &#39;secondary canon&#39; (orange) - the latter is pretty much fanfic which is acknowledged as official. The Movies fall neatly into this spot.<br><br>Obviously, secondary canons can also have fanfic written about them, and even secondary canons of their own, such as the games which spin off and alter the Movieverse. But then, so can fanfics! OFUs are all fanfic of both OFUM and their host canon. It&#39;s absolutely possible for a fanfic to have two or more inspiration (lowercase I) canons.<br><br>Tangled up in all of this is feedback. Everything feeds back into the world that inspired it, and the world that created it. World One&#39;s J.R.R. Tolkien became more hobbitlike after he started writing about hobbits. New Zealand has practically turned into Movieverse Middle-earth in places. The Myst idea of stories slightly altering their inspirations indicates there&#39;s feedback from canons to Inspiration Worlds - and there&#39;s no reason that can&#39;t include the idea that agents from canons, while technically recruited through red or green worlds, are &#39;echos&#39; of a light blue character who is drawn through into the PPC and &#39;merged&#39; - for want of a better word - into a single &#39;real&#39; person. That would allow people from fictional worlds to be &#39;real&#39; without contradicting established canon.<br><br>Not shown on the diagram is the heirarchy of Word-detection. It runs like this:<br><br>-Agents can see the Words in fanfic (green, potentially orange though I don&#39;t think that&#39;s been attested).<br>-Agents generally <i>can&#39;t</i> see the Words in canons (red), though Flowers can sense them.<br>--Red, orange, and green, therefore, are all classed as Word Worlds by the Flowers - because they can sense the Words there.<br>-Not even Flowers can feel the Words in World One (blue), even though it is a written world. The same would apply to Inspiration Worlds (light blue) if they ever accessed them.<br>--Blue and light blue are therefore classed as Atomic Worlds by the Flowers. They&#39;re wrong, but it&#39;s their mistake. It probably has something to do with that being their &#39;native&#39; level of reality.<br>-There are no Words in the Real World (black) - as far as we know! To the best of <i>our</i> knowledge, this is the only true Atomic World. The Flowers, of course, know nothing of its existence.<br><br>Though actually... the non-interaction of World One and the Real World may not be quite that absolute. <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/SwansEgg.htm">Swan&#39;s Egg</a> features interaction which <i>didn&#39;t</i> involve fictionalising the Real World - because the only interaction between the fictional PPC agents and us took place right here on the Board, in the form of written posts. Of course, the posts for the PPC were written by me - but they&#39;re a written world anyway, so they were always going to be.<br><br>RPs wouldn&#39;t count, because they involve creating fictionalised personas. Agent LJs might be interaction, if authors reply to them as themselves, rather than in-character. Agent Lou talks directly to me-as-the-narrator, without me making a fictionalised appearance. So there <i>are</i> ways to do it. But anything that involves writing the Real World makes it, instantly, into World One.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>In the Myst series, which has Word Worlds of its own (after a fashion), a major point was that capital-&#39;W&#39; Writers did <i>not</i> create the places described in their Books, but simply established links to worlds that had previously existed. I think that World 1 is similar, in that all of the canon worlds are as real as 1 but don&#39;t really have any reference relating them to it until their stories are written*. World 1 isn&#39;t &quot;special&quot; except as a place where many such links originate.**<br><br>This seems to fit with the origins of the PPC in that the Flowers directly entered World 1 from <i>outside</i> of it without anything about them first being written here.<br><br><br>The long and short of is that explaining World 1&#39;s basic nature would be as &quot;simple&quot; as explaining any alternate universe: &quot;It&#39;s just like your Earth was in 2014, only there are no Forerunner ruins&quot;; &quot;It&#39;s just like your Earth, only wizards don&#39;t exist&quot;; &quot;It&#39;s another world called Earth, where there are only Men and everyone uses something called &quot;electrical technology&quot; instead of magic.&quot; Explaining the existential aspects requires a good understanding of the weird stuff up above, but once that&#39;s done there really isn&#39;t much to it other than &quot;World 1 is what&#39;s on the other end of one of your connections and they were the ones who initiated it.&quot;<br><br>*I don&#39;t think they&#39;re fully-formed but inaccessible, but that&#39;s where things get weird. I&#39;m imagining them in a sort of possibility flux where they aren&#39;t fully-realized so much as just potential- if you have a background in computer science you can think of them as constantly-shifting garbage data that has yet to be referenced, with the canon work acting as a pointer or filesystem that makes them comprehensible and stable; if you have a background in physics you can think of them as in a state of superposition, or as a quantum foam; if you have no background in either of these areas I don&#39;t really know how to explain it and it&#39;s probably too esoteric to matter anyway so why did I just type this monster paragraph?<br><br>** This does imply that when an author changes things in a story, the old story is still around and the &quot;changed&quot; one is just a slightly different universe that has always been that way, that the pointer &quot;Star Trek&quot; now direct to instead. That in turn opens up the possibility of &quot;cloning&quot; vast numbers of essentially the same character or object by collecting instances of them from other versions of their story that are only slightly altered... in the Myst series Linking was elastic in that very slight changes could be written and propagated through the Link to actually alter the world they were in, whereas large ones would just change the Link to point to a different world.</p>

            <p>The problem with explaining the Real World, at least to me, is that anything we have to compare it to is a man-made creation. Trying to explain what World One is like to someone in Godzilla!New York would boil down to &quot;it&#39;s like your world, but no giant monsters destroying cities.&quot; Personally, I think the best way to handle that would be to show said Agent the source material for their world, explaining that in our world, they don&#39;t actually exist. Of course, being told that you don&#39;t exist might cause some mental issues in the form of an existential crisis, but the concept of alternate universes is confusing at best anyway. </p>

            <p>Basically I tried to have Kim from Ghostbusters!New York try to explain to a stranger, who might be from any reality that has the Ghostbusters movie, what World One is.<br><br>It does bring up a question with Larry.  He&#39;s not from World One, but no one knows where he&#39;s from.  If he was from Potter!Nebraska, would a CAD be able to tell?  (I&#39;m thinking of having him come from the SkinDeep universe, which afaik doesn&#39;t have any fanfiction, so it wouldn&#39;t be loaded in the CAD, and there would be people who hadn&#39;t heard of it.)<br><br>I&#39;m writing a story where Hillary and a replacement!Moebius from SIAT accidentally end up in headquarters.

            <p>Involving a mini-Aragog who did not originate in a fanfic.<br><br>So I was in a fast food place today, an Arby&#39;s to be specific, with my brother and sister-in-law. Now at this place they ask you what your name is so that they can call it when your order is ready, so my brother dares me to tell the employee that my name is Voldemort.<br><br>I don&#39;t generally make it a habit of backing down from dares that aren&#39;t dangerous, so I did it. Now the employee got the joke, thought it was funny, and went along with it. Unfortunately (or not), he didn&#39;t know how to spell &quot;Voldemort.&quot; So a few minutes later there was a roast beef sandwich and medium drink for &quot;Voltimer.&quot;<br><br>I want to keep him.<br><br>I checked Meir Brin&#39;s list and he wasn&#39;t there. I also did a Google search, but it seems to mean a number of things so I didn&#39;t get much help there - aside from a number of other people who don&#39;t know how to spell &quot;Voldemort.&quot; I haven&#39;t ever noticed him mentioned. If anyone has already adopted him, please let me know. Otherwise, he&#39;s mine.<br><br>I thought that was an amusing story that I ought to share. Because it is funny. So... yeah.</p>

            <p>One of my favorite... well it&#39;s not really a mega-crossover but the backdrop is.  The Nexus is an author&#39;s playground where any character from anything she&#39;s interested can show up.  <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1458261/1/Raising-Meridian"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1458261/1/Raising-Meridian">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1458261/1/Raising-Meridian</a></a><br><br>I was going to have Kratos and the Prince of Persia show up in my playground, but I lost interest before that point.<br><br>Also, Razzy Plush could&#39;ve been more of a crossover, but it didn&#39;t end up that way.  I think Dante is the only cameo, while the other girl to write a companion fic mentioned stealing Cloud&#39;s motorcycle.</p>

            <p>In that case, I quite like the idea of CAFs, when frightened or otherwise under duress, being able to generate or rapidly locate plot holes as a natural defense mechanism. They&#39;re creatures of bad writing, so it should figure into their &quot;biology&quot; somehow.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m thinking that she&#39;s a talking horse, she could be made useful if she&#39;s de-glittered a bit but keeps her plothole-hopping abilities.  There was even another cartoon from around the same time period that did have a dimension-hopping horse.  Chroma already steals her color scheme from a She-Ra character, so it makes sense for a Sue to steal a third trait to make her animal specialer.  </p>

            <p>A quick little story I banged together for an unofficial pirate-themed challenge for one of my deviantART friends.  It involves pirates, and the PPC cafeteria, and . . . it&#39;s a little weird.  Oh, and since some non-PPCers will be reading it, I intentionally made it more descriptive than normal, just so it would make more sense to unfamiliar readers.  Hopefully, that doesn&#39;t affect the flow too badly.<br><br><a href="http://doctorlit.deviantart.com/art/PotC-Pirates-of-the-Cafeteria-473994749"><a href="http://doctorlit.deviantart.com/art/PotC-Pirates-of-the-Cafeteria-473994749">http://doctorlit.deviantart.com/art/PotC-Pirates-of-the-Cafeteria-473994749</a></a><br><br>You&#39;ll note there are a couple of slots for cameos built in.

            <p>The flow is just right as it is, it would probably seem to be rushed if you hadn’t taken the time to make more sense to unfamiliar readers. But I wonder whether the first two paragraphs, tweaked a bit, might work better in present tense, because the PPC cafeteria is not history yet, and the &quot;One day&quot; at the beginning of the third paragraph so obviously denotes a shift from describing a general situation to telling a specific event.<br><br>Also, two sentences confused me:<br><br>&quot;He landed on the floor and dragged the tuna into a deep shadow <b>under on</b> the tables.&quot;<br>Shouldn’t this be “under one of the tables”?<br><br>&quot;One pair of cafeteria doors, which had already been open a moment ago, were suddenly thrown open ...&quot;<br>I guess the doors were not closed, but also not wide open, and somebody may have peered in, and then they were suddenly thrown wide open and the security agents stormed in. The wording is a bit weird.<br>(Also, grammar check says that &quot;a pair of doors&quot; is singular and thus it should read &quot;<b>was</b> suddenly thrown open&quot;.<br><br>It’s nice to know that may agents, when they eventually arrive at HQ, may be able to get other food than what is served in the cafeteria.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Thanks for working on this.  I&#39;m not sure about changing the tense of the first two paragraphs; I usually keep stories all one tense.  But I&#39;ll think about it more during work today.<br><br>The sentence about the cafeteria doors is meant to be a joke.  It&#39;s a Narrative Laws thing; a dramatic entrance is required, so the Legal Department caused the already-open doors to re-close for the sake of excitement.  I&#39;ve changed it a bit to make it hopefully look more like an intentional joke instead of a contradiction.  (In the GDoc; I won&#39;t change the official page until I don&#39;t have any more changes coming.)</p>

            <p>Your pirate captain is amazing, the ship&#39;s name was amazing, I loved the description of the crew, and the agents&#39; reactions were perfect! The little bits like the animal furs that were too perfect to be real we&#39;re what really sold this for me, though.

            <p>There are a number of options for edible food, actually: 1) New Caledonia restaurants, 2) disguise yourself as a human and 3) I believe I once read about a PPC General Store, which sold at least chocolate (presuming the hobbits haven&#39;t stolen it all by now).</p>

            <p>I assume that cafeteria food is provided free as a perk of working at the PPC or being a relative of an agent.<br><br>During a story involving a time lord and a TARDIS that couldn&#39;t navigate HQ, I saw that there were vegetarian dishes available.

            <p>I don&#39;t recall any other new cartoon for TMNT floating around. I thought the only current one was the Nick one. Maybe I am just getting my wires crossed.<br><br>Anyway to answer your question, I actually should look into the cartoon while the movie I have mixed feelings on. I actually like the design of the Shredder&#39;s armour but I get the niggling feeling of it being a bit too similar to Transformers. The design of the turtles themselves don&#39;t really seem to affect me but I also haven&#39;t really seen much of that to really decide either way.</p>

            <p>I see the author as the representative in our world of the canon they &quot;created.&quot;  Their mind is closer to the real deal than anyone else here can get, so their statements are most likely to be true.<br><br>Obviously, there will always be exceptions.  As hS said, all authors make mistakes.  The entire <i>Left Behind</i> series can&#39;t possibly be an accurate adaptation of the world it represents, because the ostensibly earth-like world is full of ostensibly human characters that don&#39;t behave like earth!humans.  (I wonder if it&#39;s really a world full of orcs?)<br><br>It&#39;s a little trickier with games, since they don&#39;t have a single &quot;author,&quot; even if you only focus on the story-boarding aspect.  I haven&#39;t played any <i>Zelda</i> games, but reading through this article, it seems a character called Ruto gives Sheik a male pronoun in the game.  That could have been a decision by multiple developers to mislead the player and leave the spoiler as a greater surprise.  Ruto could have been doing the exact same thing in-universe, to help keep Zelda hidden.<br><br>On the other hand, I would be more willing to trust the pronouns supplied in-game, back when the story was being concepted, than an announcement now, sixteen years later.  This announcement could just be an attempt to curb the weird fanart and other weirdness surrounding Zelda&#39;s apparent gender bending.<br><br>So there&#39;s really no easy way to say.  I&#39;ll leave it to the <i>actual</i> Link fans.<br><br>--doctorlit can&#39;t leave the village, as he doesn&#39;t even have a sword or a shield</p>

            <p>Basically I agree with what was said. The author does ultimately have final say with what is and what isn&#39;t canon. Funny thing is Eiji Aounuma did kind of say a few years ago that Sheik was female, just in a roundabout way.<br><br>Also there is the fact that the in-universe explanation is that since Ganondorf was actively looking for Zelda that she had to go into hiding. Obviously the easiest way to escape detection from someone like that would require some extreme changes, exemplified when the minute Zelda drops the Sheik disguise is when Ganondorf captures her. It&#39;s just apparently that disguise was just as good out of universe. Not to mention this isn&#39;t the first time Nintendo would have mislead players about a characters gender before.</p>

            <p>Especially about what this person thinks Jesus has to do with Miyamoto or any of this. Is he trying to appeal to authority?<br><br>I also soundly agree with 99 and AdmiralSakai. Perhaps <i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> tells itself to me in such a way that I am led to believe that the White Witch was the benign protagonist working for the good of the Narnian people. If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;m an idiot.<br><br>99, that signature is a bit... different.</p>

            <p>I mean, what is canon but things the author has said, written, or typed? That doesn&#39;t stop when the work is published. It&#39;s a lot more dubious when we try to guess a dead or otherwise uncommunicative author&#39;s original intent, but clear statements are clear.</p>

            <p>... things that are stated by <i>characters</i> aren&#39;t necessarily canon. To pick a random example, the statement by Elrond that the Ring can&#39;t be destroyed except in Orodruin is certainly a canonical statement, and I&#39;m sure he has excellent reasoning and evidence to back it up - but none of that means that he&#39;s necessarily true. That goes doubly so if the character in question is noted for bending the truth.<br><br>(And the really nice thing is that the Middle-earth books are all <i>written by</i> unreliable narrators - Bilbo and Frodo - so they can be wrong anywhere you like)<br><br>And of course it&#39;s always nice to have an author who refuses to make firm statements. Tolkien <i>did</i> make a statement on the fate of the Entwives - that they were burnt with their gardens by Sauron - but he couched it as &#39;I fear&#39;, which means <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Theory17.htm">all options are still open</a>. :D<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think of it as the author defining reality. If Tolkien says, in the book or elsewhere, the sky in Middle Earth is green, then the sky in Middle Earth is green, then it is green. If he writes &quot;Erond says &#39;the sky in Middle Earth is green&#39;&quot;, all that means is that Elrond verbalized that statement. Since Elrond is not the author, his doing so does not make the statement true.</p>

            <p>... worlds (or at least some worlds) have their own internal logic. If the author says something which contradicts that - well, writers aren&#39;t perfect, either.<br><br>As an example: Terry Pratchett has gone on record to say that the Patrician in <i>The Colour of Magic</i> is Lord Vetinari, as written by a less experienced author. Which is fine - unless you want to treat the Discworld as an actual location. If you do <i>that</i>, then the man who decadently eats... candied jellyfish? something like that... can&#39;t be Havelock, whatever PTerry says.<br><br>Perhaps I can put it this way: if an author makes a statement that&#39;s inconsistent with the world as we see it, they need to justify that statement. That can be an actual explanation, or simply the claim or implication that there <i>is</i> an explanation. But if they simply state the bald fact, in a way that implies they haven&#39;t actually considered the other possibilities, <b>when the version they&#39;re claiming is incompatible with the written canon</b>... then it&#39;s open to dispute.<br><br>If J.K. wants to randomly declare that Ron was killed in <i>The Order of the Phoenix</i>, she can. But unless she gives us reason to believe that there&#39;s an explanation for him appearing in the two books after that - I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m bound to consider that canonical. (And no, I don&#39;t believe she&#39;s done this, though it would be hilarious)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I believe that when it comes to canon, the author&#39;s word is law. Canon&gt;Fanon. Simple. Except for when the author isn&#39;t making a modicum of sense, then the inverse is true.

            <p>First of all, I am sort of a new author, and if anyone could check my stories out and give me some help, I&#39;d appreciate it. I&#39;m also looking for a few funny Jily stories, and I found a random few, along with a random few Hinny ones. Some topics are kind of mature so... the story for Jily is Obsessive Lily Disorder, and the sequel. Then, the Hinny ones are written by charmingly-holly,one which is titled: Quick, Grab the Cheese Wheels and Run! Oh, and I found a badfic on the PJO site. It&#39;s called Moon Daughter, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a troll (Pretty sure it isn&#39;t), but it&#39;s kinda very bad.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s more like what fandom was I NOT apart of at some point? (Very few, unless they&#39;re in any way, shape, or form scary.

            <p>, For a variety of reasons - I have muy difficult classes this semester (being a senior SUCKS), I&#39;ve recently started planning a web series loosely based off of Supernatural (in the seriously loosest way possible - it&#39;s about a Wiccan who camps on a natural pathway between worlds), and it&#39;s looking like I might be reviving a department of the PPC to get cliff notes and spark notes versions of original books out there.<br><br>... I think I might need some help.</p>

            <p>Have a Carafe of Continuous Caffeine! I promise it doesn&#39;t break any major laws of physics... much...<br><br><br>In regards to your proposal I&#39;m glad to see that I&#39;m not alone in finding the LotR series rather... ponderous. I think that a quick &quot;cliff&#39;s notes for canon&quot; setup would be useful not just for authors, but for people like me who interact with the canon without really being &quot;fans&quot;. If you decide to go through with it I&#39;d be happy to help expand it to other fandoms with a large insider-outsider rift.</p>

            <p>This&#39;ll be great for late nights spent frantically trying to balance my workload of college and high school classes! Besides, who cares about physics? Gravity is overrated.<br><br>I was thinking more like Spark notes, perhaps? Now that you mention it, a cliff notes version for *bleep*y writers would be fantastic, and a non-cliff notes versions + discussions on theories, meanings, and other fascinating trivia would be great.<br><br>I&#39;m getting ahead of myself, though.

            <p>I definitely understand your take on the badfic. I do that too unless it&#39;s spectacularly atrocious. (Though lately I&#39;ve been thanked by the author of a fic that doesn&#39;t contain a word above three letters that&#39;s spelled correctly for eight consecutive scathingly sarcastic reviews. I think she&#39;s a troll.)<br><br>LotR <i>is</i> hard to get through unless you&#39;re an incredibly dedicated reader, which most people are not. (I only know one person in Real Life besides myself who&#39;s finished it.) I&#39;m not going to go into the passivity of it (I find it quite exciting myself) but I do appreciate the fact that you&#39;ve read some of it.<br><br>That is definitely an interesting idea. I think that might be a division of the Department of Author Correspondence. It&#39;s currently retired, but that&#39;s because everyone who worked there retired. If someone else were to be enlisted, that could be a definite thing. The downside of it is that I believe that if someone has watched the movies (the Extended Editions, anyway - I haven&#39;t actually seen the Non-Extended Editions) then one knows enough to not completely shred the canon as many do. Perhaps for books that have not been made into movies, or have been made into particularly poor movies, such as the Inheritance Cycle or the Prydian Chronicles. Of course more discussion on the topic would be called for.<br><br>And last, but most decidedly not least, since you&#39;ve read through all my aimless ranting, have a magical stepstool and a graphite drawing of your favorite fictional locale in a green wooden frame!</p>

            <p>Even the movies aren&#39;t true canon. Yes, they&#39;re pretty damn close, but they get a ton wrong.<br><br>Even if it&#39;s just a cliff notes version (with descriptions of the major players), that&#39;s got to be a lot easier for the (not so smart) fangirls out there who don&#39;t know anything about the religious system of Arda because it&#39;s not in the movies and therefore feel as if they can make up whatever they want. *gasps and starts panting*<br><br>Of course, when I say LotR, I mean The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, AND Lord of the Rings. I guess (for me) it&#39;s a general term for the universe?<br><br>I&#39;ll see what I can find about the Department of Author Correspondence. Any idea about how I&#39;d start that up again?<br><br>Oh, the non-extended version is even worse than the movies in the term of stuff gone wrong.

            <p>Poor Glorfindel and Tom Bombadil - they can&#39;t get themselves into a single movie adaption. Beregond, too... I guess I&#39;d like to make a stand for SICTNIM.

            <p>Not exactly a movie, but good point. I actually have that game for GBA. You didn&#39;t miss much, just Rivendell being the glitch capital of Middle-earth, Invisible!Gimli, and it freezing for no reason in Moria. There are rumors that they actually developed the game beyond that darn doorway, but I don&#39;t believe them.<br><br>But yeah, Tom Bombadil was in it. As I recall, he stood around and didn&#39;t do anything while the player has to go find his house by themselves and fight giant spiders to get a feather. Then he gives you vague instructions for calming Old Man Willow... I feel like he was a bit out of character. Don&#39;t even get me started on Goldberry.<br><br>To be fair, Glorfindel appeared too, in Rivendell, but the game kept confusing him with Lindir, which struck me as mildly offensive. But you&#39;re right, they did get in an appearance.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the wonderful advice. I&#39;m thinking maybe book and movie should be treated as separate canons, as they&#39;re basically different. Similar, but different. Certainly would make classifying a (tiny) bit better...<br><br>Which people are licensed to give Permission?</p>

            <p>... active Permission Givers are me (Hello!), Neshomeh, Phobos, Cassie, Techno-Dann, and VixenMage. Araeph is our occasionally-active PG, and Makari... well, I don&#39;t actually know about Makari; she was only really on the IRC.<br><br>The mucky details of Permission are linked in the Board header (&#39;On Permission to Write PPC Stories&#39;), but basically come down to: hang around a while, come up with some interesting and well-characterised agents, and show us you can write them well (enough).<br><br>As for your LotR comments... well, for one, I can&#39;t really see where you&#39;re coming from with &#39;boring&#39; and &#39;passive&#39;. As for the idea of coming up with a summary version of the Legendarium...<br><br>Well... Arda is big. I mean, really big. And there&#39;s no way of knowing what someone&#39;s going to try and reference. They could, say, try and write a Gandalf romance (yeah, it&#39;s been done), and claim that he can&#39;t have children because he&#39;s a demigod. Which is perfectly reasonable - except for the example of Melian. So what you really need is an encyclopaedia - and those exist.<br><br>See, the problem isn&#39;t that people can&#39;t find the information on the Legendarium; it&#39;s that they don&#39;t go looking in the first place. To pull across your example of religion, a Google search for &#39;middle earth gods&#39; (no quotes) links directly to Wikipedia&#39;s entry for Vala. &#39;middle earth religion&#39; gives the lotr.wikia entry on the subject, and two lines down, a FAQ about it. The information is absolutely there.<br><br>And it&#39;s not really something you&#39;d need Permission for, either, if you could come up with a useful way to do it. Permission is for <i>stories</i>, and while <i>I</i> would read a story about a scholar musing on the history of Middle-earth (oh wait, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2088283/1/The-Advancement-Of-Learning">I wrote that</a>), I don&#39;t think many would - nor would it be easy to write for any length of time. So while it could be a publication issued by Author Correspondence, it&#39;s unlikely to be the subject of DAC <i>stories</i>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s amazing to meet you Huinesoron, I remember seeing you mentioned in the original series! *happy fangirling*<br><br>About LotR - I think it&#39;s fascinating, but I grew up on newer fiction, which is less about being a good book and more about keeping the ever-shrinking attention span of the younger generation. (Which may be the problem with badfic writers. Or mebbe it&#39;s that they don&#39;t read at all... :| )<br><br>I was possibly hoping that, if we had something we could link to, badfic writers would possibly try. Most of them base their stories off the easiest medium possible - the movies. (Of course, there are those that have read the books and STILL decide to do whatever they want. ARGH.) I think I still have too much faith in humanity/fellow fangirls.<br><br>Also, link clicked, story queued, ready to read. <sup>^</sup></p>

            <p>This thread is not a joke.<br><br>This thread is seriously, honestly, genuinely not a joke. To the best of my knowledge, everything I&#39;m about to tell you is 100% true.<br><br>You&#39;re still not going to believe me, and frankly I don&#39;t blame you. But this thread is not a joke.<br><br>In the early 1970s, United Artists commissioned a script for <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. This fell between the Zimmerman script mentioned in Tolkien&#39;s <i>Letters</i>, and the eventual Bakshi movie we <a href="http://www.flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/bakshi/bakshi.htm">all love to mock</a>. The script was written by John Boorman, who later reworked some aspects of it into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excalibur_(film)">Excalibur</a>, and it...<br><br>... well, let me put it like this. You know how we complain that <i>Jackson</i> didn&#39;t read the books?<br><br>I&#39;ve compiled a comprehensive breakdown of the script from two sources who seem to have actually seen it, which you can find <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ANvND27JF4g-zzMMgZHte9Wole8nKtLmuEQQGtqaILQ/pub">here</a>. It&#39;s long, but... yeah, you should read it. It... shall we say, &#39;rewards&#39; reading.<br><br>And some extracts, just to whet your appetite/make you run screaming:<br><br><hr>
<br><br><i>The naked Frodo lies covered with leaves on a large, round, solid crystal table in the Great Hall in Rivendell. A bearded Elrond (&quot;King of the Elves&quot;), Gandalf, the Ranger, Boromir, the four Hobbits, Gimli, and a bunch of elves are present. Frodo suffers from the &quot;wraith essence&quot; in the wound. Elrond says if they don&#39;t get it out, Frodo will serve Sauron. Elrond also predicts that from the &quot;fowl&quot; essence of the Riders, a new form shall rise again.<br><br>The elves start chanting in an attempt to heal Frodo. Then enters Elrond&#39;s daughter, the 13-year-old Arwen, &quot;our little lady Arwen&quot; to try to heal Frodo. Elrond tells Gimli to stand with his axe ready to cut-off Frodo&#39;s infected arm if Arwen should swoon or cry out. The surgery is delicate in that it is, as Gandalf says, “a struggle, a test of strength, between the power of Sauron and the power of the Elves.”<br><br>Arwen plunges a thin, red-hot knife into Frodo&#39;s wound. Tension mounts. It seems Gimli is going to have to cut-off Frodo&#39;s arm. Then Boromir pipes up: &quot;Enough! How long shall we fuss over a ring and a sick Hobbit? ...Lord Elrond, did you summon me to sing hymns over a Halfling?&quot;<br><br>Gandalf tells Boromir to shut up, because Arwen is literally risking her life in this operation. Boromir wants to take the Ring, and Gandalf challenges him to do so. Boromir tries to grasp the Ring, but an unseen force holds him back.<br><br>Then Arwen succeeds, pulling a dark splinter from Frodo&#39;s wound. Pippin cries out, &quot;Frodo will live!&quot;<br><br>And right then and there they start having their council, Frodo presumably still naked.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br><i>Gandalf says they now have to go through Moria, which pleases Gimli. They all ascend stone steps to a blank wall of rock. Gandalf runs his staff across the surface, revealing the emblems of Moria. The &quot;hieroglyphics&quot; on the doors of Moria are written in the forgotten ancient dwarf-tongue, which Gandalf can read, but not speak; he translates them as &quot;Sing friend, and enter.&quot;<br><br>Frodo figures out the riddle (to sing the dwarfish word for friend). Neither Gandalf nor Gimili can speak the ancient dwarven tongue. Gandalf tries speaking some guttural words, but they don&#39;t work. Boromir starts making fun of Gandalf, which makes the Hobbits laugh. So Gandalf invites Boromir to try, who then hurls himself against the rock door, falling back rubbing his shoulder. The Hobbits then laugh at Boromir.<br><br>Then Gandalf knows what he can do...<br><br>&quot;Only Gimili has the memory to open the door...You greedy Dwarves...Greedy Dwarves! Just dig, dig, dig, for precious metals...Dig! You greedy Dwarf!&quot;<br><br>So Gimli, entranced, beings cutting into the ground with his axe. It&#39;s not fast enough for Gandalf, so he smacks him with his staff, making him dig faster. Then Gandalf throws his cloak over Gimli, and gives Gimli a sound thrashing. This causes Gimli to relive dwarven ancestral memories. Gimli emerges from his hole, and he sings the dwarven word, opening the door.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br><i>Galadriel takes Frodo into her tent. Inside are carpets and cushions, as well as a small silver basin filled with water. What can I do now but quote the script:<br><br>FRODO: I look and I see nothing.<br>GALADRIEL: You look and you see nothing, for you are not yet ready.<br>FRODO: When, when shall I be ready? And how?<br>GALADRIEL: With knowledge. And I am that knowledge.<br>FRODO: I - I don&#39;t know what questions I should ask.<br>GALDRIEL: Your eyes ask questions… already.<br><br>Accepting the invitation, his eyes wander over her body, drinking in its loveliness. GALADRIEL&#39;s austere and aloof features soften. GALADRIEL&#39;s hand touches the chain from which the Ring dangles. And FRODO&#39;s hand takes hers. FRODO looks again into the reflection in the basin and sees their two faces come together and kiss.<br><br>As it turns out, the basin isn’t the Mirror at all; it is, instead, Galadriel’s Elven Ring. <br><br>Then we cut away to the rest of the Fellowship, stuck outside the tent in a huge hammock-like thing. Humorously, Merry takes a bite of lembas (which, if you remember, tastes like whatever you are thinking about at the time), rolls it around in his mouth, savors the taste ecstatically, and says, &quot;Galadriel.&quot;</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br><i>Then a monstrous snake “perhaps a hundred yards long” slithers onto the battlefield. Everyone is dismayed, while the orcs chortle with joy. Suddenly the snake disintegrates, and The snake was actually warriors holding up their painted shields. The good guys cheer.  Йomer charges the snake, but before reaching it, out of the snake’s head &quot;breaks a great white banner with a tree embossed on it.&quot; Then the rest of the snake breaks apart, revealing its components to be Aragorn’s collective army of Rangers, Elves, Dwarves, and the Dead -- their shields having been painted to resemble the patterns of a snake.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br><i>Aragorn then sees Eowyn&#39;s body. He &quot;spreads out her arms, and covers her with his body. He presses his palms on her palms, his legs on her. After a moment, she moans, and her body writhes, trapped under Aragorn&#39;s great weight. When he feels her stir, he rises, lifting her with him, enfolding her in his arms, pressing her mouth and body to his.&quot;<br><br>Aragorn is enraptured by Eowyn&#39;s beauty. She starts to swoon again, but Aragorn &quot;kisses her with passion and intensity.&quot; They look into each others eyes with love.<br><br>Meanwhile, Gandalf is performing a nifty tie-dye trick with the banner of Elendil. Having ripped the white banner from its mast, he carefully folds it, and then dips it into Denethor&#39;s blood. He unfurls it. &quot;On the white flag is a beautiful mandala in blood, radiating from the centre of the white tree. It is as though the bare tree had burst into blossom.&quot;<br><br>He holds it over Aragorn and Йowyn, and proclaims “The hands of the healer are the hands of the King! The King has returned to Gondor!” A group of onlookers chant “Aragorn King! Йowyn Queen!” Gandalf completes his song: &quot;Renewed shall be blade that was broken: The crownless again shall be King.&quot;</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br>And I haven&#39;t even included the Kabuki Theatre of Elrond, the Great Wall of Mordor, the drugged mushrooms, the Rope Bridge of Khazad-Dum, or that classic final line:<br><br><i>Look! Only seven colours. Indeed the world is failing...</i><br><br>I, uh... I realise it&#39;s good form to provide a direction for further discussion, but honestly? I think you can handle it yourselves.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>First and foremost, I can&#39;t track down a copy of the complete script; the summary is by someone who owns a copy, but they haven&#39;t released the full text.<br><br>Secondly, the full script is 176 pages long. ;)<br><br>And third... are you ready for this?<br><br>This was an officially-created script in collaboration with the Tolkien Estate (and possibly Tolkien himself).

It&#39;s by Hama of TheOneRing.com, and runs like this:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing letters in an Elvish character. Below, though the threads were in places blurred or broken, the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars. Beneath these again were two trees, each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in the middle of the door a single star with many rays.<br><br>“There are the emblems of Durin!“ cried Gimli.<br><br>“And there is the Tree of the High Elves!“ said Legolas.<br><br>“And the Star of the House of Fлanor,“ said Gandalf. “They are wrought of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and moonlight, and sleeps until it is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle-earth. It is long since I heard them, and I thought deeply before I could recall them to my mind.”<br><br>“What does the writing say?“ asked Frodo, who was trying to decipher the inscription on the arch. “I thought I knew the elf-letters but I cannot read these.<br><br>“The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the Elder Days,“ answered Gandalf. “But they do not say anything of importance to us. They say only: The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter. And underneath small and faint is written: I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs.”<br><br>“What does it mean by speak, friend, and enter?“ asked Merry.<br><br>“That is plain enough,“ said Gimli. “If you are a friend, speak the password, and the doors will open, and you can enter.”<br><br>“Yes,“ said Gandalf, “These doors are probably governed by words. Some dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or for particular persons; and some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and words are known. These doors have no key. In the days of Durin they were not secret. They usually stood open and doorwards sat here. But if they were shut, any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. At least so it is recorded, is it not, Gimli?“ “It is,“ said the dwarf. “But what the word was is not remembered. Narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth.”<br><br>“But do not you know the word, Gandalf? “asked Boromir in surprise.<br><br>“No!“ said the wizard. “I was hoping Gimli did.”<br><br>They all turned to the Dwarf.<br><br>“Don’t look at me!” said Gimli. “This all happened well before my time!”<br><br>Legolas harrumphed!<br><br>“And what is that supposed to mean?” asked Gimli.<br><br>“Rather, I think, your wits have been addled by too much Dwarven Ale! It isn’t that you don’t know the password, it’s more likely you can’t remember!” said the Elf.<br><br>Gimli scowled. “And I suppose a drop of wine never ever passed your lips, either,” he said.<br><br>“Typical of a dwarf, always accusing others of your own foibles. That was how the wars between our two peoples got started in the first place.”<br><br>“It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the wars began,” said Gimli.<br><br>”I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,” said Legolas.<br><br>”I have heard both,” said Gandalf; “and I will not give judgement now. But I beg you two, Legolas and Gimli, at least to be friends, and to help me. I need you both. The doors are shut and the sooner we have the password the better. You must try to remember, Gimli!”<br><br>Boromir strode forward. “Stuff all that! I say we give the dwarf a good kicking. Then he’ll remember all right!”<br><br>Legolas nodded his head enthusiastically, but it was only when Aragorn started rolling up his sleeves that the balance was tipped. Gandalf sighed and shook his head sadly, before pulling out a large black jack from within his robe. Gimli backed away. Merry and Pippin went over to one of the Holly trees and pulled off a couple of thick branches from it. Gimli backed further away. Sam went to his pack to get Mr Frodo his knuckle-dusters, before pulling out a large piece of 2 by 4 for himself. Gimli was now trying to back his way through the cliff, but not getting very far. Boromir, grinning all the while, put on his metal studded leather gauntlets, while Legolas took a large rice flail from his quiver, and whirled it about his head. Gimli tried to climb the cliff to get away, but it was too late. Finally, Aragorn looked at the various items hanging from his belt, and finally plumped for his trusty day stick emblazoned with the emblem of the white tree. He looked at the others and they all nodded in return.<br>“Right then!” said Boromir, advancing. “Come here my beauty!”<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Which... is technically enough of a divergence from BLotR to qualify? Maybe? ~hS</p>

            <p>I like how you handled the &#39;canon&#39; nature of the Boorman script, and the reaction of the agents when they realised that they couldn&#39;t technically do anything about it. <br><br>Rile X finding out that he&#39;d volunteered for the mission was very amusing, especially considering what Kyaris says later on (and him very wisely keeping quiet). <br><br>I like the exorcism scene, especially that it didn&#39;t work right the first time. Out of interest, the memory capsules that Mortic tried using at first, is this the first time they&#39;ve appeared? I don&#39;t recall reading about them before. Quoting a canon character&#39;s description at them to try and get them back in character seems like a very good way of doing things. <br><br>There were some particularly good lines in there, my favourite line from the whole thing is definitely &#39;“Well done, you can understand simple statements,” Kyaris said. “Here’s another one: <i>don’t touch anything</i>.&#39; (It&#39;s that last bit that makes it such a good line, for me). <br><br>Just one minor comment about SPaG - those pesky dash followed by a speech marks are causing trouble again. While they should be closing speech marks, they&#39;re opening marks instead. <br><br>With regards to the mission pins, why does Mortic look for one for both of them? I thought they were just used for indicating that an agent had been temporarily seconded to work with another Department, so I can see Rile receives the WhatThe pin, but not why Mortic would be looking for the DAVD one for himself. </p>

            <p>The memory capsules are new for this - they were originally going to be simple USB memory sticks, but in an upcoming mission, Agent hS doesn&#39;t recognise a DVD because HQ (or at least his part) uses more advanced, fictional technology where it can.

            <p>I thought the memory capsules were new. One of my favourite aspects of the PPC setting is all the crazy tech we have (particularly the stuff the developed in-house, instead of just pinched from a canon) so I was a little surprised to see a reference to what seemed to be standard equipment that I&#39;d never heard of.<br><br>With regards to the mission pins, and who counts as being seconded to who, my personal thought is that whoever receives the mission on the console is the &#39;primary agent&#39;, with the other being seconded. So in this case, it was a DAVD mission, because it went to Mortic&#39;s console, with WhatThe support. But that&#39;s just me - there&#39;s no reason why it can&#39;t be that everyone participating gets a pin. <br><br>I really like the idea of the mission pins, and hope to have an excuse to use them myself sometime. <br><br>By the way, did you get my recent(ish) e-mails about Ispace Wars chapter 7 and the updated version of my Ispace mission?</p>

            <p>The &#39;high-speed exorcism&#39; approach used by Mortic is pretty much unique to him. It&#39;s something that wouldn&#39;t be necessary to most departments - only WhatThe and maybe DAVD have to cope with ultra-fast derailments like that - and further, it requires special skill to use. If you recall (or even if you don&#39;t!) Mortic is from the Order; pinpoint accuracy simultaneous delivery of nine capsules is certainly an Order skill or incantation at work. A Jedi could probably pull it off, or some kinds of magic user, or maybe a machine intelligence - but I don&#39;t think even, say, a Noldo of Aman could do that.<br><br>I did get your emails, though I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve read them... a week&#39;s holiday followed by having to get through a 24-episode DVD box set in a week has kind of devoured my computer time.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, I wasn&#39;t thinking that it was a standard procedure, or that you were trying to make it one. I just think it&#39;s cool to see variety in going about a typical task (well, typical if you&#39;re a PPC agent that is. I imagine that exorcisms are fairly non-standard these days). <br><br>I couldn&#39;t remember much about Mortic (I&#39;ve just visited his wiki page for a refresher), but I assumed that he was more than just a regular human from the way he hit them all at once like that. I meant to comment on that, but it looks like I forgot. The way it was described, with his hand sweeping out and a series of small projectiles striking with unerring accuracy, put me in mind of the kunai skills of typical anime ninjas (the badass main character types, as opposed to the swarms of faceless minions that get mown down). However, after looking at his page again, I can be fairly confident that he is not a ninja :)</p>

            <p>Perhaps a copy could make its way around HQ, and each glaring part could be reacted to by a different agent pair.

            <p>If memory serves me, in TOS, there was a fic where Arwen was around 9. Jay or Acacia mentioned that at that age she would have been an baby. This makes the whole scene with 13 year old Arwen seem even more ridiculous, since she couldn&#39;t have been more than a toddler.</p>

            <p>The mechanics of elven aging are a bit unclear, particularly since they&#39;re based on a single source. In essence, though, <s>our</s> their bodies age slower, but their minds age faster. So they talk and run by the age of one or so - but by the age of (say) five, they still look to human eyes like a two-year old. Even though they&#39;re probably as bright as a ten-year-old.<br><br>In Aman, the age of adulthood was 50 (!!! and that might even be 50 <i>Valian</i> years, or <b>500</b> years of the sun), but that doesn&#39;t necessarily imply that&#39;s when their bodies reached adult stature. Humans reach full growth long before &#39;adulthood&#39; - particularly in Tolkien&#39;s time, when &#39;adult&#39; meant 21.<br><br>So I read this as Arwen looking around 13, since it seems to be stage direction, not dialogue. That would make her about, oh, mid-twenties, maybe? And intelligent enough to have several university degrees. ;) &#39;course, she&#39;s only half-elven, so it may be even more messed up...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Can agents scan through the whole story, or just the words near what&#39;s happening?  Say they notice an inconsistency late in the story with something they saw near the beginning.  How easily could they compare the two passages?</p>

            <p>While I haven&#39;t specified this anywhere in the one mission I&#39;ve actually posted (or the half-dozen that are in various stages of being written), my agents are only capable of reading the Words for the chapter that they are in. <br><br>I thought that made a nice balance between being able to skim ahead (or back) to check stuff, while still allowing them to be surprised by stuff even if they do find the time to read ahead. After all, there may be times where they&#39;re stuck with nothing to do, and while they can just portal through the boring bits, it would make sense for agents to do as much intelligence gathering as they can. I wanted to have it so that my agents could always be surprised by something, regardless of how much time they had on their hands.  </p>

            <p>is that they can see what the Words say all the way through, though it&#39;s still possible to make mistakes. For example, in my most recent mission, Rina accidentally overlooked the fact that several noncanon two-way mirrors were used again in the story and stole them, only to later realize she had to put them back.</p>

            <p>The way I&#39;ve written it in my missions, they can skim trough the whole fic. I use it to save time in the story. The agents can check the Words and find that there are no major canon breaks for the next two chapters, but there is a mini three paragraphs down that they need to collect. Then they can portal accordingly.<br>But it shouldn&#39;t get to the point where the agents aren&#39;t surprised by anything they see, because they have already read in the Words.<br><br>Like Phobos said, they shouldn&#39;t be watching the words all the time. Although I did exactly that in my last mission, but that was because they needed to keep an eye out for some potentially lethal punctuation.</p>

            <p>The agents shouldn&#39;t have the time to sit back and read the whole story while on a mission.  It is important to keep in mind that, while the story is just words to us, to the agents the story is physical and real.  They should be engaged in what is going on around them.  They shouldn&#39;t need to look at the words, except as a means to explain why they are experiencing something odd or to make sure of where they are portaling.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Well, we&#39;ve had all sorts of other AUs, so why not? *g* Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking:<br><br>It&#39;s your typical American high school (because that&#39;s what I&#39;m familiar with). All the department heads are teachers or staff. All the agents are students. If they&#39;re not teenage-modern-Earth-humans, imagine what they&#39;d be like if they <i>were</i> teenage-modern-Earth-humans. Nothing crazy or supernatural is going on; it&#39;s just a normal high school. Imagine what your characters would be like if they weren&#39;t PPC agents, badfic characters, aliens, time-travelers, etc. How would their personalities be the same? How would they be different? If necessary, how would you translate their backstory to make it fit the real world? Would they still have a relationship with their partner, or would they have no real reason to know each other at all if they weren&#39;t forced together? Who&#39;s an honor student, a delinquent, a weirdo, a jock, a band geek, a bully, a popular kid, etc.?<br><br>As for the Flowers, the SO is obviously the principal. Tungsten Monk suggested he&#39;d have a bright yellow afro when I ran the idea by her. *g* I think the Marquis translates easily into a harried enrollment officer, a bit of a chump with his outdated sense of style. The Head of Operations (I forget who it is now) would probably be a vice-principal. I figure the Kudzu is the school counselor (I see her as a black lady from the South, heavy in a comfy-looking way) while Dr. Freedenberg teaches psychology; meanwhile, Dr. Fitzgerald is the school nurse. Hornbeam probably teaches shop. As for the rest... discuss! What do they look like? Who teaches the maths, sciences, social studies, history, English classes, languages, band, orchestra, choir, art, gym, sports, etc.? Feel free to <a href="http://tektek.org/dream_avatar/dream_avatar.php">TekTek it up</a>!<br><br>I think this would be an awesome role-play, especially a long-term one, but unfortunately, I can&#39;t commit to running something like that. Instead, consider this a character-building exercise and see what ideas you come up with for your agents and favorite Flowers—and if you want to make an RP of it or write stories, too, sweet! {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, who&#39;ll be back later with stuff for her characters.</p>

He still brings the kind of brightly colored backpack that was popular in middle school and he&#39;s not on any teams, because for some reason he can&#39;t be trusted with the equipment. Volleyballs pop, hockey-sticks get tangled, he keeps tripping over the soccer ball, he&#39;s more likely to duck than to catch a basketball pass... you name the sport, he&#39;s bad at it, not through clumsiness or lack of any noticeable athleticism, but because you can count on him to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

            <p>Eledhwen: Ellie Mills is one of those quiet, tidy girls who keeps to herself and ignores most people, though there&#39;s a persistent rumour that she believes in faeries for some reason. She&#39;s good at English, decent at Math and Science, and is generally inobtrusive. However, those who know her better know that she&#39;s 1) a neat freak 2) extremely passionate about her studies, and 3) has zero tolerance for relationship drama. She&#39;s in the school choir and occasionally submits letters to the editor for the school tabloid. <br><br>Christianne: Christianne Shieh is the louder, more acerbic friend of Ellie who shares English class with her. She talks more than she listens in class, which gets her into trouble (and gets Ellie a bit exasperated at her). She is less talented at math than her friend, but better at science, and so the two often study together (which has led others to think there&#39;s more than just friendship going on between the two). Christianne&#39;s in the school orchestra and does occasional forays into the drama department (usually when they do Shakespeare). <br><br>I&#39;m not sure how cohesive those sounded like; my head hurts and I&#39;ve been trapped on a bus all day.

            <p>Starwind Rohana is short, energetic, and prone to going bezerk if you push her buttons even a little. When asked about her name, she just says &quot;I&#39;m Scottish&quot;; no-one has pushed her further. Despite apparently being classic bullying material, no-one has tried since her second week at the school - probably because she was excluded for a week (or... whatever the American equivalent is) for nearly breaking someone&#39;s arm when they tried. She&#39;s been excluded on several other occasions, too, most notably for the day when she turned up to school dressed in woad and not much else.<br><br>Esme Telnar, on the other hand, is tall, skinny, eerily beautiful, graceful, sociable, likeable, talented... and, for reasons known only to herself, spends all her time hanging around with the aforementioned bezerk Scot. Half the guys in the school want to date her - but can&#39;t get past her scary friend to ask.<br><br>Together, they run the school paper, the <i>Mutinous Monitor</i>. Well, <i>they</i> call it the school paper... the Librarian calls it &#39;that criminal waste of paper&#39;, and has tried several times to stop them printing it. If only his student assistants would stop giving in when Esme asks them to let her use the printer...<br><br>The <i>Monitor</i> is, of course, a tabloid (or whatever the American translation is); it features rumours, gossip, candid photography of teachers and popular students (Starwind is on record as saying &#39;They want to be in the public eye? Then let &#39;em!&#39;), horoscopes, pictures of the latest &#39;hot&#39; singers and movie stars, and letters from students - including, as I&#39;ve mentioned before, perpetual conspiracy theories from Kayleigh and Sambar.<br><br>Every issue also seems to include a &#39;new feature&#39;, none of which make it into a second issue. &#39;The top ten coolest explosions you can make in the lab&#39; actually led to Prof. Echinacea hunting down and burning every single copy of the issue - which may not have been the best idea, since the girls sprinkled the paper with chemicals that made the fire burn bright purple. &#39;The top ten places to get a little privacy at PPC High&#39;, on the other hand, was <i>very</i> well received by the staff, though the backlash from the students meant it still didn&#39;t have a second installment.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Nah, just kidding. This is awesome.<br><br><br>Gaspard: Legend has it that there is this half-Chinese freshman guy that &quot;haunts&quot; the school. Outside of classroom hours most people only catch fleeting glimpses of him before he melts into the crowd. He&#39;s been seen hanging out just about everywhere: in the library, outside on the football field, in the Cafeteria lineup, around various clubs or organization meet-ups and so on. Those that manage to talk to him find him almost completely unremarkable: his grades are average, he suffers from mild acne, he doesn&#39;t participate in any sports or activities, he has a virtually nonexistent social life, and his after-school life consists solely of eating, doing homework, and sleeping. However-- and this is a <i>big</i> however-- Gaspard knows everything about the goings-on at PPC High. Everything. He knows who belongs to which club, who bullied who, who is going to get in trouble for bullying, and who is dating who. No secret is safe from him... but that doesn&#39;t matter. Nobody goes out of their way to find him anyways. Nobody except...<br><br><br>Angus: an overweight senior who recently broke up with his girlfriend. Unlike Gaspard, Angus is very  visible. In fact, he&#39;s known as the all-around Genuinely Nice Guy of his year. He&#39;s earned the reputation through countless small acts of kindness: need a pencil? Angus has got you covered. Missing a dime to pay for that granola bar? He&#39;ll give you one and won&#39;t constantly harass you to repay him. Can&#39;t figure out a math problem? He&#39;ll walk you though it. Nobody has seen Angus get upset about anything; the senior seems unfazed by even the most stressful situations. This doesn&#39;t hold true when it comes to comments about his weight, though. Fortunately, this has never been an issue for Angus. I mean, who would go around and mess with such a helpful guy? That&#39;s like kicking a puppy.<br><br></p>

            <p>Laura is a greasy, zit-speckled problem student. The junior is a frequent visitor to detention thanks to her propensity to talk herself into trouble, both with teachers and other students. Despite a car accident in her sophomore year that damaged both her left arm and vision, she is still an avid video gamer.* She’s even part of an after-school gamer club, which is looking to try and get into some competitive tournament play. Laura’s been teased a few times about her weight, which usually leads to more trouble.<br><br>Danny prides himself on the quality of his schoolwork. The senior has a passion for English literature and writing classes, not to mention debate club, the Model UN, and tabletop role-playing games. When he has time to spare (which honestly isn’t much given his other pursuits), he volunteers to tutor freshmen after school. He has spoken repeatedly of pursuing an education degree once he graduates into college. Danny walks with a slight limp caused by a broken leg sustained during a fall. He and Laura don’t really know each other too well in this universe due to running in different social circles.<br><br>Jim Pittman is a senior who recently transferred in from out of town. Underneath his laid back attitude lies a talented athlete. He managed to impress the coach well enough to get a position on the football team despite his newness. Jim also has an abiding interest in legal issues and wants to pursue a career in law enforcement. Despite all that, he’s also something of a sci-fi nerd; he tends to keep his knowledge of <i>Star Wars</i> expanded canon and <i>Star Trek</i> races under his hat when shooting the breeze with the other guys on the team.<br><br>Remember when I said Laura was a problem student? Penny “Gremlin” Teng has her beat, what with having an actual criminal record and all. It&#39;s nothing too serious – shoplifting and vandalism – but it&#39;s enough to get the sophomore a reputation with most of the student body. Penny maintains her grades just barely enough to keep from getting expelled. She also has a real knack for electronics and computers, which is where her nickname came from. She is good friends with Laura thanks to both their shared time in detention and their shared membership in the gamer club.<br><br>Karcie Nil is quiet, serious, and studious. She typically dresses all in black – not the fancy ornate black of a goth, mind you; just practical flat black – and dyes her hair blue. The sophomore tends to prefer the company of books and coursework to other people. She excels in the fields of biology, literature, and sociology. One of Karcie’s only major interaction with other students is her on-again, off-again membership in the debate club, where she and Danny have a passing familiarity. Her teachers have partnered her up with Penny for coursework a few times in the hope that some of Karcie’s positive traits might rub off on the delinquent.<br><br>* I elected to tone done the extent of Laura’s injuries because a missing eye and arm in a real world school would be very bad news.</p>

            <p>Rina would be the band geek, Pokemon geek, book nerd, and shy kid who prefers to read her books and X-Men comics by herself unless she&#39;s with her friends, when she kind of becomes the &#39;big sister&#39; of the group despite the fact that she&#39;s one of the youngest in her social circle. And she&#39;s also kind of loud and enthusiastic.<br><br>Randa is just all-around friendly and one of those kids who doesn&#39;t get on the teacher&#39;s bad side despite the fact that she&#39;s got an impressive vocabulary, if you get what I&#39;m saying. ;)<br><br>And I get the feeling that the Floating Hyacinth would be the Band Director, and the Queen Anne&#39;s Lace is HomeEc.

            <p>Barid (Barry Dawes, Sophomore) is a lanky kid in the class clown tradition.  He usually wears obnoxious Hawaiian shirts.  One never knows what his next bout of shenanigans will look like.  Food fight in the Cafeteria?  Handstands in the halls?  No, today it looks like he&#39;s drawing on himself with a Sharpie.  He&#39;s got a solid C- average, and that is good enough for him.<br><br>Brightbeard (Ed Brightbart, Junior) is stocky and serious.  He went to Military school for a while.  Shortly after transferring to this new school he broke up a schoolyard fight involving Barry.  Now he can&#39;t get rid of him.  Ed spends a lot of time working on projects in the shop. He is also a member of the after school Interfaith Alliance.<br><br>Decima (Natalie Thompson [use that name at your own peril], Junior) is anti-social and stand-offish.  She insists on being called Decima.  She wears a lot of black, and has more earrings than some consider appropriate (we&#39;ll not even talk about her <i>other</i> piercings). Combat boots and super-short hair are her norm.  She has a fascination with the occult and considers herself to be a Wiccan.  Despite her dark, tough exterior she has a thing for cheerleaders.</p>

            <p>Starting with the easiest to translate, Gall is a bully. She probably used to live somewhere she had to be tough to get by—maybe someplace rural, where the only other kids for miles were rowdy boys—and hasn&#39;t quite figured out that her fists and cruel remarks are neither a necessary nor acceptable way to solve problems and gain respect. It doesn&#39;t help that she struggles with reading and writing, although she understands perfectly well when things are explained to her out loud and she can explain them back. She might join a girls&#39; wrestling or hockey team to channel some of her aggression, though she&#39;d complain about not being on the boys&#39; team—she&#39;s just as good as any boy, after all, and they get all the attention.<br><br>Nume wouldn&#39;t have perfect recall in the real world, since that&#39;s not really a thing, but he would still have exceptional memorization skills and book smarts at the expense of any discernible social aptitude. He could easily get straight As and rock the academic competition scene, but finds himself incredibly bored by simply absorbing and regurgitating facts and doesn&#39;t care much about pleasing anyone, so he cuts corners and spends as much time as possible on things that stimulate his imagination. His only steady form of social interaction is a tabletop RP group, which both admires and loathes his ability to quote the rulebooks at them. He doesn&#39;t set out to be a rules lawyer, but he can&#39;t always resist the impulse to point it out when someone is doing something wrong. Because he looks exactly like the huge nerd he is—skinny, gangling, thick glasses to correct his farsightedness, zits, and a voice in the process of changing—he&#39;s often picked on by people like Gall, who don&#39;t care that nerdy is in now.<br><br>Ilraen would start out as a freshman, bright and friendly, but naive due to being homeschooled up until now. His efforts to please people and make friends would probably result in his good nature being taken advantage of for some time, before either the teachers or more morally upstanding students put a stop to it. He&#39;s interested in team sports, but doesn&#39;t quite have the physical condition to be any good at them. He also likes science, technology, and sci-fi, and might potentially attract Nume&#39;s interest upon making a working model of the <i>Enterprise</i> or <i>Serenity</i> or something. With Ilraen being too clueless to be offended by Nume&#39;s callousness at first, they&#39;d start hanging out and gradually realize that their skills and interests complement each other. Woe to Nume when Ilraen eventually realizes that girls are pretty and starts spending more time with them. Ilraen also grows up into a steady, responsible guy, making it a point to look out for kids like him who might be taken advantage of or victimized in any way. Ultimately, he&#39;s a lot more interested in people than things.<br><br>He can&#39;t hold a candle to Jenni, though, whose sole mission in life is to get to know absolutely everyone and fix their problems. You could almost call her a social butterfly, except that she&#39;s not doing it for show. She&#39;s smart, but struggles with grades due to spending all her time on her friends instead of books and papers—except for her bio, A&amp;P, psych, and sociology classes. She hasn&#39;t quite decided whether she wants to be a doctor or a psychologist yet, but you have to go to med school either way, and she&#39;s all for that. Then again, she might just toss it all out the window and join the Peace Corps or something. Travel, adventures, <i>and</i> helping people—awesome! She&#39;s an idealist, and hasn&#39;t quite realized that the real world won&#39;t change overnight once she&#39;s on the scene, and she can&#39;t always help <i>everyone</i> she meets. Her electives include choir and art.<br><br>Derik is a musician through and through. He&#39;s in choir and also plays multiple instruments. His voice is changing, but he&#39;s managing it better than most, and refusing to give up on the upper register. He&#39;s adventurous and friendly, keeps himself in shape, and would play sports if he could do that and be in the marching band at the same time—sadly, rehearsal times often conflict during football season. Tragically, in his junior year, he winds up in a motorcycle accident that leaves him with serious burns on the right of his face and upper body. He&#39;s out of school and generally withdrawn for some time, and when he comes back, he doesn&#39;t resume his music classes, since performing in front of people is more than he&#39;s ready to take on when going to class is bad enough. (Unlike dragonriders, high schoolers tend to stare and whisper at serious deformities; not great for one&#39;s self-confidence.) He still sings and plays privately, maybe making YouTube recordings for fun, and he&#39;ll gradually let people back into his life—maybe former choirmate Jenni, who would be one of the first to let him know she doesn&#39;t care about stupid things like appearances and wants to make sure he doesn&#39;t turn into some sort of bitter, basement-dwelling psychopath.<br><br>My, what a lot of text. I think that&#39;ll do for now!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>IMO, half the fun of this silly idea is seeing who might be friends (or reluctant acquaintances, or enemies, or girlfriends/boyfriends) with who in this universe.<br><br>Nume would definitely not want much to do with someone like Unger, but if you&#39;re an antisocial geek who just wants to game, you don&#39;t always get to pick your group. It&#39;s up to the GM who they allow in the game; and while I can see Nume maybe running a canned adventure now and then if pressed, I don&#39;t see him coming up with a homebrew—or if he did, it would suck, because he&#39;d get bogged down in the details and try to railroad the whole thing. The funny thing is, while he&#39;s interested in wild, imaginative stuff, he&#39;s not actually the most creative person himself.<br><br>He&#39;d probably play mostly spellcasters or the equivalent (it helps that he can always remember everything his character can do, unlike me), but I can also see him going for tanks on occasion. The point of RP is to be something you&#39;re not, after all.<br><br>And yeah, Iximaz, I had a friend like that, too. The GM always had to keep the Monster Manual behind a screen so he wouldn&#39;t be able to tell what the monster was based on what page the book was open to. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

            <p>Obviously, Prof. Mallorn teaches Geography. He&#39;s short (obviously) and has a tendency to dye his hair - mostly gold and green, depending on the season. ;) He also has to be white - and I mean really pale white. Y&#39;know, like almost... silver?<br><br>Dafydd Illian is Britain&#39;s revenge for all those obnoxious American students at Hogwarts. He&#39;s Welsh, a descendant of the Princes of Gwynedd (though that covers a lot of people; he&#39;s not a Hidden Heir to the Throne or anything), and incredibly disdainful about... well, everything American. He&#39;s also in the school choir. Unfortunately (for him), his lovely Welsh accent, delicate features, and hair that&#39;s only <i>just</i> within the length requirements - or, if they don&#39;t have those, is just plain long - combine with his attitude to make him a prime target for bullies. The girls all think he&#39;s cute, though.<br><br>The bullying isn&#39;t based on anything from actual Dafydd - it&#39;s just the logical conclusion from &#39;arrogant, standoffish, pretty boy&#39;. He has a plot arc where he learns to actually interact with other people, such as...<br><br>Selene is half-Chinese (and has the Chinese version of Windflower, which I believe was Fung Ying, as her middle name). She&#39;s... oh, let&#39;s go for hilarious irony and make her a Jehovah&#39;s Witness (ie, forbidden from taking blood - Sel&#39;s normally a vampire, so yeah). But a shy one who&#39;s mostly in it because her parents are. She tried the missionary approach when she was just starting school, and the bullies still think it&#39;s hilarious to make jokes about it. She sits at the front of most classes, because she&#39;s genuinely interested in everything - and also because there&#39;s more empty spaces there, so she doesn&#39;t have to talk to anyone.<br><br>Some time in the second season, Dafydd and Selene end up with a Chemistry project together. The... rather enthusiastic result gets them nicknamed &#39;the Pyros&#39;, and gives the pair of them a brief breather from the bullying (Dafydd manages to threaten to set the bullies on fire without ever quite <i>threatening</i> to do so). It also draws the attention of...<br><br>Constance Sims. Average American teenager. Wears really thick glasses. Her dad&#39;s a moderately-successful author, and... well, basically she&#39;s Constance! She&#39;s not <i>popular</i>, but she does have friends, and isn&#39;t usually bullied. She thinks Dafydd&#39;s accent is adorable, and of course they have a relationship-building subplot going on.<br><br>Most of my main agents basically slot straight in. Kayleigh can keep on being Kayleigh (and scaring the life out of everyone), Narto can keep on being socially awkward and picked-on... Lou&#39;s not there, because Lou is always Lou, and getting her to not talk back to me would be an exercise in futility.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But my current, slap-dash take on my characters would be:<br><br>Doc would probably be a lot like I was in grade school, very few friends, the ones he does have are nerdy.  I&#39;m not sure if he would be into tabletop RPs, or just be a books-only guy like his PPC self.  Definitely studious to the point of roboticness, not really knowing how to disengage from being busy to do anything else.<br><br>Vania would be the type to try being friendly with everyone, with mixed results.  Others would start noticing strange patterns in her behavior, and she would start noticing lapses in her own memory.  Eventually, she would start getting treatment for multiple personality disorder.<br><br>I guess Sйverine and Yoof would be lunch<s>ladies</s>persons, unpopular with the kids for Sйv&#39;s attitude and Yoof&#39;s large amount of body hair, too much to be contained by mere hairnets.<br><br>Molly and Ollie (name changes not yet finalized) will be Freshmen.  Molly will be into drawing, for sure; I&#39;m thinking an interest in astronomy for Ollie, which might develop into physics later on.  This is a lot more circumspect, since I haven&#39;t had a chance to really write them yet.<br><br>Fr&#39;sst will be a mean stray cat living somewhere on campus, secretly fed by a lot of students.  (And maybe some of the staff?)</p>

            <p>Cali is/was a teenager (not sure where he is on the timeline right now), but teenage-modern-Earth-human high school, I believe he would be the kid who reads way too many comic books, and dyes his hair blue. It seems like he would be a prime target for bullying, because he&#39;s not all that big, and not all that strong, but he smiles so darn much and is so nice to everyone that it would be like kicking a puppy to pick on him. Even the cool kids would interfere if someone gave him a hard time.<br><br>Unger is that kid who has been strong ADHD meds since he was four and it&#39;s stunted his growth, so he&#39;s tiny. And he&#39;s still unbearably hyperactive, and got shuffled off into the resource classes years ago (remember he couldn&#39;t read when he joined the PPC). He is incredibly friendly of the never-met-a-stranger sort, but tends to get on people&#39;s nerves with his impulsivity. He&#39;s not actually unintelligent, he just can&#39;t focus long enough to function in a classroom.<br><br>Miah is one of those kids that talks big, acts out, is irreverent to teachers, but skates along doing just enough homework and behaving just well enough that she doesn&#39;t get suspended (too often), though she is frequently in detention. She&#39;s just unpredictable enough to keep everyone unsure of what she&#39;ll do next and just vindictive and sneaky enough to keep everyone ever so slightly afraid of getting on her bad side. She avoids commitments, but will do nice things for people that she feels deserve it, especially if she can arrange for no one to know it was her.<br><br>Kelok is very smart, but painfully shy. He is generally subdued, wears dark clothing and doesn&#39;t try to make friends at school. He was adopted from an orphanage in one of the formerly Soviet countries as a preschooler. He is neighbors with Unger. They have been friends since Kelok got to this country, even though they have wildly mismatched personalities. He knows how to fight, and has been suspended several times over the years for decisively ending fights that bullies started with him. He&#39;s mostly left alone now as not worth it since he won&#39;t react to anything less than physical violence (and they&#39;ve mostly learned they want to avoid that with him).<br><br>I think the Daisy should be something like the Career Development teacher. </p>

            <p>She&#39;s really more of that kid that thinks they are too cool for school, so I don&#39;t think direct competition initiated by Miah. However, if they did directly interact then they would have great potential to either meet in an explosion against one another, or end up in a collaboration that makes everyone else <i>wish</i> they had exploded. I don&#39;t see a lot of in-between. I&#39;d prefer they ended up as collaborators, but not sure if Gall would see that as advantageous to her or not.</p>

            <p>The Queen Anne&#39;s Lace would probably teach biology and anatomy, the Poison Ivy would teach some sort of language, the Strawflower would be in charge of history, and the Reannual would teach physics when he wasn&#39;t trying to impress upon his students the importance of advanced quantum mechanics. Regarding gym and sports, I&#39;m a bit divided. I could see Big Thorn in that role (as from my experience, gym can have a lot of disturbing acts of violence associated with it), but he might be better suited elsewhere. My other suggestion would be either Captain Dandy, Waterlily Commander, or Admiral Pansy. I could see the three of them as soldiers who became teachers once their tours of duty were up.<br><br>Also, would they have their PPC names (Mr. Hornbeam, Principal Sunflower) or more real-world appropriate (if still punny) names? Examples might be Principal Helios, Ms. Queensly (Queen Anne&#39;s Lace), or similar.<br><br>Where my agents might fit into this will follow later.</p>

            <p>You have the QAL for bio, and the Reannual for physics... I guess the Thistle is probably biology as well, probably doubled with chemistry.

            <p>I was thinking, if this were to be an ongoing thing, we&#39;d just keep their PPC names and overlook the weirdness of it for the sake of convenience.

            <p>So, Ringwraiths. Sauron&#39;s uber-warriors, right? Lethally-effective undead cavalry who can murder their way through absolutely anything? Right? ... right?<br><br>I&#39;m not so sure (obviously, or this wouldn&#39;t be a thread). Think about the missions Sauron sends the Nazgul on. In rough order, from the first time they appear in the history of Middle-earth:<br><br>-Taking Minas Ithil (in the first century of its existence).<br><br>-Establishing a kingdom (Angmar) to weaken Arnor. This is achieved by causing divisions between the three sub-kingdoms, subverting one, conquering another, and destroying the third.<br><br>-Taking over the old Elven stronghold on Amon Lanc to be Dol Guldur. (Hey, did you know Dol Guldur was Thranduil&#39;s old home? Cool, huh?)<br><br>-Looking for the One Ring in the Shire.<br>--And chasing the Ringbearer.<br><br>-Scouting across the Anduin.<br><br>-Communicating with Saruman and/or claiming his prisoners.<br><br>-Running interference in the leadup to the Battle of the Pelennor.<br><br>-(The Witch-King) Breaking the gates of Minas Tirith.<br><br>-Running interference over the Battle of Dagorlad.<br><br>-Trying to stop Frodo destroying the Ring.<br><br>The traits that really spring out of that list, to me, are <b>stealth and manipulation</b>. The Nazgul were often sent into situations where their presence or identity had to be hidden - the Witch-King went unidentified until the end of his reign, and (obviously!) the Black Riders weren&#39;t revealing themselves as agents of the Dark Lord. Even more, they spend their time manipulating people: again, the Witch-King sowed dissent between the Arnorian successor kingdoms, and the Winged Nazgul did most of their work by invoking fear, not by actually attacking.<br><br>Yes, there are several &#39;take a city&#39; missions in there - but it&#39;s instructive to look back to Sauron&#39;s own city-conquering days. In the First Age, he &#39;conquered&#39; Minas Tirith on Tol Sirion with a shadow of fear, which drove the elves out and let him take the city without even having to fight. Could Minas Ithil have fallen the same way? Dol Guldur certainly could have, since it seems to have been mostly abandoned before the Nazgul arrived.<br><br>There are other traits displayed by the Nazgul - speed, sorcery - but they seem to be attributes of convenience. The Ringwraiths were sent after Frodo at Orodruin because they were the fastest servants Sauron had available. As to sorcery - that power is only attested in the Witch-King himself. Again, the sorcerous power is essentially independent from his Ringwraith nature.<br><br>The Nazgul were stealth commandos and semi-political maneuverers, not warriors. Yes, they could fight - but in both situations where they did so, Weathertop and the Witch-King on the Pelennor, they <i>lost</i>.<br><br>And I&#39;m reminded of Gollum&#39;s very first use of the One Ring: sneaking around, eavesdropping on his relatives and neighbours...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s worth remembering that the Great Eagles are servants of Manwe the Windlord - and so is Gandalf. He studied with Nienna, and has a fire-affinity which marks him as kin to Aule or (gasp) Melkor - but in <i>Unfinished Tales</i>, it&#39;s made clear that Olorin is a Maia of Manwe.<br><br>So he probably knows the Eagles personally - Gwaihir and his brother Landroval were vassals of Thorondur way back in the First Age. Olorin could have - would have - been there when they flew to Taniquetil to visit or report, or receive direction. (There&#39;s a plot Nuzgul for you!)<br><br>But he would also have known their limitations - the ones apparently imposed by Manwe, Iluvatar&#39;s viceregent in Arda. Think about what the Eagles actually <i>do</i>: in pretty much every case, they are confined to a search-and-rescue role. They rescue Maedhros - Beren and Luthien - the body of Fingolfin - Thorin&#39;s company - Gandalf (repeatedly) - Frodo and Sam. The two battles they appear in both include Gandalf - and they are <i>not</i> the factor that turns the tide, in either case.<br><br>Gandalf was sent to Middle-earth to be &#39;the enemy of Sauron&#39; - but not to oppose him in power. He says enough about how visible he is to suggest that he might not have gone to Mordor even had he lived, and he certainly makes no effort to catch Frodo and Sam up after he comes back. He also hides out when Bilbo and company are taking down Smaug, only coming back to fight relatively-inconsequential orcs. And when he <i>does</i> face one of Melkor&#39;s servants in battle - the Balrog - he pays for it with his life.<br><br>I think Gandalf, just like the Nazgul, was limited in his appointed role: comforter, counsellor, forger of alliances and sustainer of failing hopes. When he chose to push the boundaries of that task, he brought the very real risk of ruin on his head. In that sense, his imprisonment in <i>Desolation of Smaug</i> fits perfectly with the pattern.<br><br>And the Eagles? I think they, too, were restricted in what they were permitted to do. The One Ring was a problem for Middle-earth to deal with - and more, it was a problem for <i>Men</i> to face, as they took over dominion of the world. Aragorn&#39;s armies and Frodo&#39;s journey are both aspects of the ascension of mortals to the highest authority. In that quest, servants of the Uttermost West were, and should be, limited to supporting roles. If Manwe destroys the Ring, through his servants the Eagles - then why should the elves pass dominion to the Men who just stood by?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It fits a lot with the politics in the rest of the story - there&#39;s definitely strong political issues in the relations between Gondor and Rohan, not to mention Saruman attempting to grab his own piece of the pie by manuvering the White Council and turning his neighbors against each other. And it fits, thematically, with the way that both Orthanc and Minas Tirith were weakened from the inside long before anyone had a clue what exactly was going on.<br><br>To my mind, it also reinforces the whole theme of all the different peoples of Arda coming together and trusting each other in the end, instead of succumbing to old rivalries. (The primary example of that being, of course, the Council of Elrond, and appointing representatives of Men and Elves and Dwarves to go with Frodo on the quest.) It&#39;s a bit of a reversal of their old methods of breaking apart kingdoms.<br><br>I can&#39;t help but think, though, that the Nazgul&#39;s methods in the Shire show a lack of preparation. They just go up in their suspicious black garb asking suspicious questions of the locals - I suppose they thought it would be an easy mission, but still, that is not smooth investigative procedure at all. But it makes some sense - they&#39;re ex-rulers, not field agents, incognito was not their style while alive.</p>

            <p>... the fact that Tolkien at one point stated that the Battle of the Hornburg - y&#39;know, Helm&#39;s Deep, &#39;the battle that ate the film&#39; - could actually be <i>cut</i> if it conflicted with the rest of the story.<br><br>Hmm... a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> with little-to-no on-screen fighting: that could be interesting! Doable, too, if you stick entirely with Hobbit viewpoints: the Hornburg is off-screen, thrown out in favour of the Ents breaking down an empty Isengard. The Pelennor is mostly off-screen too, just seen through the eyes of Pippin running around Minas Tirith. The Morannon (which I previously called Dagorlad - whoops!) would be in, by way of Pippin... but overall, a lot less fighting, a lot more sneaking (Frodo) and watching politics (M&amp;P).<br><br>Or, even more interesting - an LotR entirely from the perspective of <i>Gandalf</i>. That speaks to &#39;who knows what when&#39; - it would be a story replete with incomplete information. Will Frodo and Sam succeed? Heck, we don&#39;t even know they&#39;re still <i>alive</i>!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... did <i>any</i> of the big battles have a direct impact on the outcome of the Quest? The Pelennor and Dagorlad, in particular, were - in the words of a certain Wood-elf who knew a lot about moving unseen - &#39;a diversion&#39;. I mean, sure, Aragorn probably didn&#39;t <i>plan</i> on Sauron nearly wiping Minas Tirith of the face of Middle-earth when he looked into the Palantir - but he also didn&#39;t plan on drawing him out to defeat him in open battle. His sole purpose was to distract the Eye from Mordor so that Frodo and Sam - if they were still alive, if the Ring wasn&#39;t already on its way back to its Lord - had a chance.<br><br>Hmm. Which explains (yet again) why that Osgiliath sequence was so incongruous - it&#39;s a battle, in the half of the story which is trying to <i>avoid</i> them.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Three of them, including the Witch-King, were lords of Numenorean descent (and there&#39;s <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Theory8.htm">a whole bunch of theorising</a> about whether the Witch-King was a named character - or even a King of Numenor!); the second-in-command was named Khamul, and known as the Shadow of the East. Which, again, implies <i>stealth</i> and hidden manipulation.<br><br>Of the Rings, the Three are semi-tangential - they were handed out by Celebrimbor directly, not by Sauron. They also didn&#39;t go to the three kings of the Elves - Gil-Galad, Oropher of Mirkwood, and Amdir of Lorien - but to the High King of the Eldar (Gil-Galad again) and <i>Galadriel</i>, who at that point wasn&#39;t ruler of anything. Basically &#39;Brim had a thing for Noldor...<br><br>The Seven, though, were given to seven dwarf-lords, and we know that one of them went to the king in Durin&#39;s line. There were seven races of the dwarves, so it&#39;s entirely possible that Sauron gave a Ring to the seven <i>kings</i> of the dwarves. With that precedent, it&#39;s hard to imagine he would have given the Nine to some random blokes off the streets of Umbar.<br><br>You&#39;ve drawn out the political side of things, and you&#39;re absolutely right: between them, the Nazgul run no less than <i>four</i> independent realms <b>that we know of</b> - Angmar, Dol Guldur, Minas Morgul, and (at certain times) Mordor itself. We can be reasonably sure they ran some of Sauron&#39;s eastern realms, too (fun exercise: see if you can spot the hidden workings of Sauron in the history of the earlier Third Age). For nearly six thousand years, the Nine were Sauron&#39;s lieutenants and political underlings.

            <p>Amon Lanc was the original Sindarin settlement in Greenwood, under Oropher - Thranduil&#39;s father. It makes a certain sense - it&#39;s close to Lorien, then <i>also</i> a Sindarin realm under Amdir; in fact, Oropher and Amdir were both refugees from Doriath; they probably wanted to stay reasonably close to each other. Perhaps their sons - Amroth and Thranduil - were friends.<br><br>They crossed the Misty Mountains to get away from the Noldor who were setting up in Lindon and Eregion, people like Gil-Galad, Celebrimbor, and (irony!) Galadriel. Of course they still had some connections back that way - Galadriel&#39;s husband Celeborn was another noble of Doriath - but ultimately, the Sindar had always blamed the Noldor for their troubles (and not without reason!). So they headed east, and set up realms among their distant Silvan kinsfolk.<br><br>But times changed. Galadriel left Eregion and moved to Lorien; she was welcomed by Amdir, but one gets the impression Oropher wasn&#39;t too keen on her. The dwarves of Khazad-Dum made themselves into a major power in the region, partly by the influx of refugees from Nogrod and Belegost - and it was dwarves of Nogrod who had killed Thingol of Doriath. Worse, these dwarves were allied with the Noldor of Eregion - you know, the ones whose leader, Galadriel, had &#39;just decided&#39; to move over the mountains into Lorien. Another Noldorin power grab was clearly in progress, and there were rumours of suspicious magic artefacts, and an unidentified Maia.<br><br>And then there was the darkness rising in the south and east - rumours of werewolves and vampires, and of men worshipping a figure disturbingly reminiscent of the Morgoth... it&#39;s little wonder the elves of Amon Lanc migrated north, until at last Oropher removed his throne to the northerly Emyn Duir. They&#39;d be safe there, right?<br><br>... right?<br><br>(And the fact that didn&#39;t fit in: Thranduil&#39;s halls were founded <i>much</i> later, a thousand years into the <i>Third</i> Age, when Sauron again appeared - unidentified - on the scene. With Southern Mirkwood a mess of spiders, and Amon Lanc taken from them by the sinister Necromancer, the elves took the mountains as a shield, and fled to the far north-east. Safe at last! ... and then a thousand years later, those bloodthirsty dwarves came by and set up a Kingdom under the Lonely Mountain. There&#39;s no rest for the weary...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>After all this time I finished at last what I intended to do with my <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User:Hieronymus_Graubart">user page</a> since I joined the PPC Wiki. But since I’m not a native speaker, and I don’t want to embarrass myself for an indefinite span of time, I would appreciate if somebody looked over it and pointed out all errors which escaped my alpha reading and any bad ideas that may have crept in. (I expect your comments on my talk page, although this isn’t really much less public than the board.)<br><br>Question: The user page offers a Blog, which, to explain itself, says “Blogs are used by wiki communities for fan fiction or original work ...” Would it be a bad idea (like taking up too much space on the wiki server) to put writing exercises on this Blog and ask for concrit? I’m aware that there are <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=261708;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">better choices</a>, but I’m already loosing track of my accounts and passwords and don’t want to create more.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Back at the Metroid wiki I used my blog mostly for idle technical speculation (since one of my main jobs there was to be the science consultant) and... I guess you could call it editorial content on the meaning and implications of the games. Few people bothered to read it.<br><br>Looking over your page, superficially it looks good but you seem to use the word &quot;German&quot; a lot. One would assume after you mentioned you were a native German citizen living in Germany, most of what you interacted with would be German in one way or another... also you don&#39;t have to sign edits to your userpage.</p>

            <p>Those were actually pretty awesome. :) My favourite crossover idea is Avengers / Nolanverse Batman, where Scarecrow and Loki team up and then Batman have to work with the Avengers to stop them. I imagine he and Iron Man has a lot to discuss about whether or not a secret identity is needed or not.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m reading Homestuck fic.<br><br>This is a fantastic humanstuck (which I generally disapprove of) AU, featuring GamzeeKarkat. I literally cried, it was so beautiful. The writing was amazing too.<br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1030564"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1030564">http://archiveofourown.org/works/1030564</a></a><br>You meet him and he&#39;s a kid, half your age, but he takes care of you anyway. Your life is clean and clear and slow when he&#39;s around you, and you remember the parts with him in it and blur the places in between until you see him again.<br>So this is the story; the bits you remember, the important parts of your life. The parts that had him in them.<br><br><br>I kind of have a huge fondness for Karkat-Signless meetups, because they&#39;re both amazing and <i>someone</i> needs to give KK a hug, so here are two especially good ones:<br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/281939"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/281939">http://archiveofourown.org/works/281939</a></a><br>The Signless meets his descendant in a dreambubble.<br>Alternatively, <i>Signless: Fondly regard crustacean.</i><br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/505174"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/505174">http://archiveofourown.org/works/505174</a></a><br>Dream bubbles allow for a lot of things, especially conversations that need to take place. Karkat has a bone to pick and The Sufferer&#39;s got it coming. Round and round the universe goes, descendant to descendant and ancestor to ancestor, always inheriting the momentum of the past.<br><br>I just utterly <i>adored</i> the <i>idea</i> behind this one--I&#39;m not a particularly shippy person (except, it turns out, when it comes to moirallegiance), so the concept of the Signless and the Disciple&#39;s relationship that went &quot;beyond the quadrants&quot; being that of siblinghood was just... gah. *adores*<br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/305964"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/305964">http://archiveofourown.org/works/305964</a></a><br>The Signless and The Disciple shared something that was beyond the troll quadrants. Perhaps, to someone from another world, that something would not be so unrecognisable.<br><br>This one has nothing to do with any Vantases at all (*gasp* I know, completely insane!)--it&#39;s a fascinating fic about the beta kids, who, having recreated the universe exactly as it had been, just don&#39;t seem to fit in. It&#39;s all told through the eyes of their various romntic partners, who, despite being nameless storytelling devices, each have their own distinct personality. I <b>love</b> outsider point of view as a device--it&#39;s one of my favourite things to find in any story, fanfic or not--and it&#39;s used particularly well here.<br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/172018"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/172018">http://archiveofourown.org/works/172018</a></a><br>How do you adjust to a normal life after living through the end of the world? At the expense of whoever is foolish enough to date you apparently. You meet the strangest boy, the most Amazing Girl. You meet Rose Lalonde in college and John Egbert in Bolivia and all of them are a little off, a little broken, a little <i>wrong</i> in exactly the same way.<br><br>Finally, this is an <i>amazing</i> crossover-AU-thing with, of all things, a D&amp;D style universe. The basic background premise is that the SBURB players who were still alive as of Act 6 (both sets of kids, Karkat, Terezi, Kanaya, Gamzee, Sollux, and Aradia--the cherubs didn&#39;t exist when it was started) created said D&amp;D style universe and became its gods. Fastforward several thousand years later and find that, out of boredom, they&#39;ve been incarnating themselves into the world--but now, a new evil threatens, and with Karkat as the only one who even vaguely remembers who they are, they set out to save the world. Hilarity ensues and I&#39;m really not explaining it well, because <i>wow</i> it&#39;s such an interesting and wonderfully executed piece. The story is partially driven by user-suggestions, and the author manages to do an utterly amazing job of weaving them into a cohesive narrative. Their writing is fantastic, too, even moreso when you learn that the way they write it is with the least editing they can possibly do to stop going insane over fixing things. It&#39;s also <i>long</i>: so far, there&#39;s 97 chapters and over 400000 words, and it&#39;s nowhere near done.<br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/420086/chapters/700061"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/420086/chapters/700061">http://archiveofourown.org/works/420086/chapters/700061</a></a><br>The halls of the Gods are empty, echoing with unheard prayers.<br>The forces of corruption and decay are growing in power. Soon they shall sweep across the world like an unholy plague.<br>From the deep caverns beneath the majestic Dragonshard Mountains, across the mighty Greenweald Forest, to the fair city of Porthaven on the storm-wracked coast, there are fourteen people with the mark of a divine ruler on their skin. They do not know it, but they and only they can save the world from apocalypse and ruin.<br>So naturally, they&#39;re going to spend as long as possible arsing about slaying monsters and looting ancient temples. &#39;Cos, you know, <i>adventurers</i>.<br><br>I would add more, but I&#39;d be surprised if anyone even read this far, and anyways, I want to get back to reading The Land of Dragons and Dungeons. I&#39;m on chapter 62.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>Name: John &quot;Anonymous&quot; Doe (Real name: Unknown. Nickname can be further shortened to &quot;Anon&quot;)(If you have ideas for better names, I&#39;m all ears.)<br>Gender: Male<br>Home Continuum: MLP:FIM<br>&gt;Species: Pony<br>&gt;&gt;Subspecies: Unicorn<br>Age: Mid-twenties<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Talent: He has mastered a memory-wipe spell that can be focused into the obliteration of specific memories. Applications range from a Bleeprin replacement when used on self, to a replacement for the Neuralyzer. See history.<br>Appearance: Green with a black-question-mark cutie mark and emerald eyes. His mane and tail are both made up of short black hair, cropped short. <br>Personality: Anon is a lot more easygoing than Cheesy, being the optimist to Cheesy&#39;s pessimist and the jokester to Cheesy&#39;s grump. He&#39;s also kind and caring about his friends- although he can be a total ass until you win his trust.<br>However, when Anon gets angry, it&#39;s an entirely different kind of rage to Cheesy&#39;s fiery fury. He becomes cold and calculating, a hunter with the source of the anger having a large target painted on his back. And he won&#39;t stop until the target is dead...<br><br>Okay, maaaaybe that was an overstatement, but that&#39;s what he&#39;d like to happen.<br><br>History: All that is known for certain is that an unnamed agent saw a bright red light flash from behind a closed broom closet while walking down the hall. Inside was Anon and a rapidly-closing plothole. Unfortunately, it was later gathered that the bright light was a misfire of Anon&#39;s memory spell, and the result is best explained by referring the audience to the case of Gilderoy Lockhart.<br><br>The PPC didn&#39;t bother attempting to restore Anon&#39;s old memories, and instead trained him to be an agent.<br><br>(This was inspired by an old idea for an ask blog I had, and modified to be more of an author-insert.)</p>

            <p>Still, the attitude of claiming lots of stuff... doesn&#39;t work. Generally speaking, you want to claim whatever you&#39;re working on and maybe one, two future fics. Like, in my case, two WiP fics, one future.</p>

            <p>Cheesy is probably going to be paired with Anonymouse&#39;s self-insert. As for Falchion, I already elaborated on his partner a while ago:<br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=261366;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=261366;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=261366;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25</a></a><br><br>Her new name is Rasheeda bint Giza, with Rosetta/Rose as an occasional nickname; I&#39;ll have her updated bio posted once I get my drawings of her finished. Since I&#39;m off to a conference next week, though, she won&#39;t be ready until the week after that...<br><br>Yes, Falchion is indeed my &quot;self-insert.&quot; I actually brought up this matter in an earlier post, since I myself wrote the first badfic the two are slated to tackle and I would like for Falchion to realize this. I ultimately decided upon the alternate memories so that he could notice something familiar, go off and research the fic and the author, and put the pieces together.<br><br>And yeah, I know there was health-restoring wine in the original Kid Icarus game, but that wrist-cutting has to be the most OOC thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.

            <p>Well, like I said, I&#39;m not expecting permission the first time around. ah well here goes:<br><br>AGENTS:THE FANART SOLDIERS:three new agents that were born from hooking a portal generator that was set to fan-art to a reality room. They are from the battlefield continuum, and their department is the DMS.<br><br>Grigori:Known as “Greg” to his “brothers”, he is the middle-oldest of the fan-art soldiers. His appearance is that of a 25-year-old generic Russian male with white hair and an average build.

So he ordered the DoSAT technicians to use the reality room and fan-art to create new agents.<br><br>The fan-art selected was from the battlefield continuum.  <br><br>“We&#39;re ready.”said a technician. The portal generator was activated, and the fan-art appeared through the portal, becoming three-dimensional in the process. But then, the generator exploded, sucking the background of the art back into the collapsing portal. All that was left were three stunned technicians and three bodies from the fan art.<br><br>Spitting out soot, the technicians examined the bodies. One was a Russian assault trooper, the second was a Chinese combat engineer, and the third was an American heavy support. Due to the nature of the fan-art, the bodies were unconscious, mindless, and groaning. “Medical probably has those culture implants ready.”said the head technician. <br><br>In the medical department room, there were three pods. Each of the pods was holding one of the three bodies from the reality room explosion. They were being injected with concentrated canon energy to transform them from their generic state. The cultural implants were having the necessary information downloaded. Said information included their personalities and skills, in addition to basic knowledge of the PPC. <br><br>When all was done, the pods opened, or more accurately, shorted out, evaporating the liquid inside and causing the bodies to fall out. “Ugh, I feel like I got hit with a truck! Wait, I’ve never seen a truck?!”said the first, the Russian soldier. “It seems we have been brought to life. Wait, who are you two?”said the Chinese engineer. “My god, what happened? Wait, this is the first thing that&#39;s happened to me.” said the last, the American support. “Well, that worked, I guess?”said a technician. “Uh, who are you, and where are we?”inquired the soldiers. “Long story.” said the head technician. “Go see the Marquis-de-sod. He&#39;ll tell you what happens from here on out.”he said. <br><br>“Man, this is weird.”said the support trooper. “We&#39;re being sent to a flower?”said the engineer. “Just go along with it, we have no-where else to go.”said the assault soldier. After what felt like half an hour of aimless wandering, they found the office of the Marquis-de-sod.  “Well, here we are.”said the three in unison.<br><br>“Welcome.”said the Marquis-de-sod. The sight of a massive flower that spoke through telepathy was definitely the single weirdest thing the soldiers had seen in their 35-minute lives. “Want me to explain some things, like why you are here?”said the flower.  “Yes. Yes please.” replied the soldiers. “I am a member of the department heads of the protectors of the plot continuum. We defend canon universes from bad fanfiction.”said the flower. “If I may”said the Russian “I believe you may have played a part in our creation.” “Indeed I did. We are running out of agents in the department of mary sues. Some continua, such as the sonic universe or twilight are being severely damaged by badfic. I created you three for the purpose of missioning badfic in those continua.”said the flower. “Is that not right, Grigori?” “I like that name.” said the Russian. “If I may, can my name be Zhao?” said the Chinese. “And I&#39;ll be Anderson.” said the American. “Yes, yes.”said the flower. “You already have basic knowledge on how to fight, so training will be short.”said the Marquis-de-sod. “Your response center is #58556762. Dismissed!” “Yes sir!”stated the soldiers.<br><br>“Well, we got ourselves a job.” said Grigori. “I really hope that the response center is at least well furnished.”said Zhao. “Something tells me it&#39;s not.” said Anderson.<br><br>“You were right.” Zhao said.

The clerk led Zhao and Anderson to the rear of the armory. “This is all western!”Zhao screamed. “I don&#39;t know how to use a UMP or an MP7!” “And there&#39;s no 5.56 caseless!” said Anderson. “I ran out of LSAT ammo just like Zhao!”. “Calm down.”said the clerk. “Anderson, there&#39;s an M240 that&#39;s been gathering dust at the back.

            <p>Sergio Turbo is, as you can guess, one of my Agents and not a free-to-use character. I am usually fine with him being borrowed or mentioned, but it&#39;s under some conditions:<br>1) If you are just mentioning something he canonically did (really, there&#39;s plenty of &quot;notable&quot; stuff involving him) I usually don&#39;t mind. However, having him take part in the story phisically or claiming that he did something that has never been mentioned before needs my permission and me having beta access to the story. The permission isn&#39;t hard to obtain, but it&#39;s under two conditions: you must have already obtained the Permission for PPC missions and I must approve what you have in mind for him.<br>2) If you are using a character, check him or her carefully. In the piece, you claimed that Sergio had bought all the ammunition in a certain caliber - the problem is, he had no reason to do so because he has no weapon that uses it. Also, the Armoury tends to be quite stocked up on ammo, especially if the weapon is present in a popular videogame, so it isn&#39;t very likely for him to buy out the entire stock.<br>Besides, he tends to use weapons from the NATO area, the complete <i>opposite</i> of the character who supposedly wasn&#39;t able to buy ammo due to him!</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll go through this in order, picking out both good and bad points.<br><br>First of all, if you&#39;re not expecting to get Permission... why are you asking? You don&#39;t have to ask, no-one&#39;s trying to rush you into it. This is like taking a driving test without expecting to pass - you waste your own time, and the examiner&#39;s (though at least with this there&#39;s no money involved). If you want concrit, just ask for concrit - we have lots of people willing to give that. What you&#39;ve done instead is demand that one of the very few Permission Givers look at something you don&#39;t actually think needs a PG&#39;s attention. I have no idea why you did this.<br><br>But that&#39;s all by the by. Let&#39;s look at your post.<br><br>The premise: I had an instinctive &#39;dear merciful Valar no&#39; response to this, but on rereading, okay. Portalling characters from fanart into a RR to make them realistic - it&#39;s unorthodox, but I guess it would work. Sure.<br><br>The characters: the profiles are boring, but I think all profiles are boring. I really, honestly, truly don&#39;t care which weapons they use, and why people always think that&#39;s important baffles me. I also don&#39;t know why a 25-year-old would have white hair, or what a 20-year-old is doing being a trained soldier. But aside from that... you&#39;ve got the loner, &#39;stubbon hyperactivity&#39; (???), and the analytical &#39;nerd&#39;. You make a comment that suggests you&#39;re going for Id/Ego/Superego, which could be interesting, though I don&#39;t know the psychological background well enough to pin each one down.<br><br>Sample 1: It... uh. No. In no particular order:<br><br>-Speech followed by a dialogue tag ends in a comma, not a full stop. &quot;Like this,&quot; said Huinesoron.<br>-End quote marks should be followed by a space.<br>-Portals don&#39;t work like that. They can&#39;t suck things through, just allow them access. Send someone in to drag the soldiers out, sure. But drag the &#39;universe&#39; the portal links to into HQ? Absolutely not.<br>-Narrator commentary in a third-person story is usually seen as bad form. &#39;Why... you ask?&#39; is not something you&#39;ll see in a novel unless it&#39;s done continuously for effect (eg, <i>The Hobbit</i>, a bunch of other children&#39;s books).<br>-&#39;The head technician&#39; appears to be an unnamed Makes-Things; I don&#39;t know why you didn&#39;t just use his name.<br>-The Marquis de Sod doesn&#39;t get to order DoSAT to do things; he can ask, but not order.<br>-For that matter, why is the Marquis involved at all? They only want Assassins, so it seems like the SO would be the one to ask.<br>-I don&#39;t know why you claim people from fanart would be &#39;mindless&#39;, or even need culture implants; it seems like, if they have any existence at all, they should come with &#39;default backgrounds&#39;.<br>-I&#39;m pretty sure culture implants don&#39;t work like that anyway, though you&#39;d have to ask Neshomeh.<br>-I have no idea what&#39;s up with the &#39;concentrated canon energy&#39;; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a thing.<br>-If they&#39;ve been implanted with enough information to give them accents, that pretty much requires them to have false memories.<br>-The &#39;wait, this is the first thing that&#39;s happened to me&#39; line is funny, I admit.<br>-The character aspects you claim for the characters... doesn&#39;t come through at all. I think you tried to do this - the Chinese one&#39;s first words are analysis of the situation - but it really didn&#39;t happen. They&#39;re totally interchangeable.<br>-How did they know the Marquis was a Flower?<br>-You claim they were given basic knowledge of the PPC, then have the Marquis explain it to them... make your mind up.<br>-<i>Flowers talk in italics</i>. If you don&#39;t know how to use italics, use /slashes/ or even *asterisks*. Not speech marks. Never speech marks.<br>-You have multiple people speaking in the same paragraph on multiple occasions.<br>-You need more capital letters on titles. &#39;Protectors of the Plot Continuum&#39;. &#39;Twilight&#39;. Etc.<br>-The Marquis&#39; plan is... stupid. First of all, the DMS is not &#39;running out of agents&#39;; that makes no sense. Secondly... how exactly is recruiting a whole three people going to fix that?<br>-Where do those names come from? The Marquis gives Grigori his name, and the others randomly pick their own? That&#39;s a whole story in itself, but you just... ignored it.<br>-That&#39;s a very long RC number.<br><br>And for completeness: the second sample.<br><br>-Did Sergio Turbo say you could use his agent?<br>-This is... a massive paragraph of unfamiliar acronyms. It suffers from all the problems of the previous sample, particularly not breaking for new speakers.<br>-And, again, it doesn&#39;t show us the characterisation at all. Zhao - the analytical &#39;nerd&#39; - enters the scene yelling angrily. Anderson, the stubborn one, agrees to compromise. You&#39;re telling me one thing and showing me another. Zhao is a ball of fury compared to easygoing Grigori - which isn&#39;t who I was told to expect!<br><br>And overall comments:<br><br>-We strongly suggest in the discussion of Permission that you should get a beta reader. If you <i>had</i> a beta reader for these stories, sack them and get a different one who knows what punctuation should look like.<br>-Your agents devolve into talking heads. The only things they move are their mouths and their physical locations. In the final paragraph, Grigori says &#39;Calm down,&#39; and then directs a comment to Zhao. He doesn&#39;t make any gestures, or turn, or alter his facial expression at all - from what you&#39;ve told me, he just stands there staring at the wall making comments in monotone. And that goes for every character, all the way through.<br>-There&#39;s nothing really interesting in either of your stories. You have three characters who were created with no memories - and don&#39;t give us any of their reactions to this fact. You have an argument over <i>guns</i>, which doesn&#39;t devolve into exciting (threats of) violence or... anything. It&#39;s just people, saying words, and then someone else says some.<br>-You don&#39;t have to know how to use HTML to copy and paste a link into a post. It&#39;s really simple.<br>-Sentences start with capital letters. You&#39;ve been dropping them since your very first post; can you <i>please</i> get a handle on this?<br><br>So: Permission Denied. Your idea for their origin is interesting and I think unique, but your writing skills, both technical and in terms of characterisation and making things interesting to read, have not shown themselves to be up to making it readable.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Umm...... another stupid plan to get permission(they always are stupid, and always will be).<br><br>on a side note, how many attempts does it take for most people to get permission? because Iv&#39;e heard one boarder took 4 tries and a year to get permission.</p>

            <p>But, yeah, Iximaz and SeaTurtle are right. While you&#39;re not doing too good right now, I didn&#39;t do too good, either (thence the four, five tries; the year part is just because I write slowly), and I did get Permission. The best piece of advice I can give you is a) read up, b) get a beta or ten, and c) be patient. There&#39;s no replacing either of those, really.</p>

            <p>Everyone makes mistakes, right? Yours just happened to be overeagerness in your desire to get Permission. You just need to read through and make sure your SPaG is together, and if you really need to, get a beta. It only took me one try to get Permission, but I rewrote my request so many times on paper that my bedroom&#39;s trash can was overflowing by the time I was satisfied with what I had.<br><br>Just take your time and make sure everything is grammatically correct before requesting and you&#39;ll get it, I promise!</p>

            <p>Being a trained soldier at 20-something isn&#39;t too unrealistic, providing this guy comes from the right place and/or verse. As to white hair... well... I knew a guy who was 22 and had white hairs. Most of his hair was brown-ish, though.</p>

            <p>If you think you&#39;re ready then go for it. Just ask yourself, have you participated in discussions on the board? Have you read through TOS and other spin-offs? Do you agreed to the constitution? If those answers are yes then go for it. <br><br>A note on the writing samples, a small while back Hs and some others came up with a random prompt table (or two) to use to help create writing samples, I haven&#39;t got the link to hand, but if you search around for it then that could be quite a good way of producing a writing sample without it ending up &#39;boring&#39;. <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>Perhaps a checklist or a template, or a page that has the request stuff separate from everything else.  I just checked and it only shows needing the agent bios, the intended badfic, and an unspecified writing sample.  Before, there was a lot of clicking around to find all the information.<br><br>Then again, I&#39;m bad at this sort of stuff.  My mother always did my tax returns, I&#39;ve been married for five years and still haven&#39;t officialised all the name-changing stuff so my husband can&#39;t file electronically, and next year I&#39;m going to have to carry a printout showing that it&#39;s legal for me to drive on an expired license because they won&#39;t let me get one in this state.</p>
