            <p><strong>Science Fiction Double Feature: A Troupe By Any Other Name Celebrates Halloween With Rocky Horror Picture Show Screening<br></strong><em>Nim de Cagny, Multiverse Monitor, Stand-In-Critic for Stan Grayson Because His Old-Man Sensibilities Were Offended By This Show</em><br><br>5/5 stars<br>dir. Kate Lynn<br>October 31 at 9PM, 18+ only<br><br><span>A Troupe By Any Other Name temporarily departed from the Bard and took some time off their rehearsals for </span><em>As You Like It</em><span> by screening </span><em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em><span> with shadow actors on Halloween night.</span><br><br><span>A cult classic from World One, </span><em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em><span> is a 1975 comedy horror musical film chronicling the adventures of a couple, Brad Majors and Janet Weiss (played in the shadow cast by DIC Agents the Agent and the Disentangler, respectively), who stray into a castle owned by extraterrestrial scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter (played, to no one’s surprise, by ESAS Agent Jacques Bonnefoy). Hijinks following a very thin line of plot ensue, mostly of the scantily-clad and crossdressing variety. The main event in the show is the creation of Rocky, a muscular blond pretty-boy (played, with some application of the disguise generator, by DOGA Agent T’Zar). Other characters include the semi-incestuous servant siblings Riff-Raff and Magenta (played by SIELU Agents Naergondir and Gurnirel, who were the only actors to be completely disguised in this show), bad-boy biker Eddie (played by DIC Agent Edgar Sullivan) and his uncle Dr Scott, tap-dancing Eddie fangirl Columbia (played by DO Agent Nerys Carpenter), and a neckless criminologist (played by none other than DF Agent the Notary).</span><br><br><span></span>Aside from some of the surprising shadow cast members, the show was a continuous ride of glorious illogic. The shadow actors only followed what the actors in the film were doing, lip-synching their lines and mimicking their actions. Despite having two sets of action to keep track of, the off-screen performance was widely acknowledged by the audience to be just as (if not even more) entertaining than the on-screen performance. The crowd went wild during the number “Touch-a Touch-a Touch-a Touch Me”, when the Disentangler danced extremely suggestively at T’Zar (and sometimes <em>on</em> T’Zar). Another wonderful moment was the burlesque floor show, where Carpenter, T’Zar, the Agent, and the Disentangler danced in corsets, fishnets, and feathered boas.<br><br>One of the hallmarks of Rocky Horror screenings and performances in World One is, of course, the audience participation. And with the PPC being what it is, well, of course the audience participation was phenomenal. People blew noisemakers and wore party hats; they did the Time Warp during the “Time Warp” number (and continued doing it at random intervals afterwards); they shouted things at the stage and screen in classic MST style. Some of the more dedicated agents dressed as the characters as well, and swarmed the stage with the actors for the encore of “Superheroes” after the credits.<br><br>All in all this was an enjoyable show, and if the Troupe does intend on making it an annual event, I highly recommend this show for those who are curious, those who can’t pass up an opportunity to MST something, and those who enjoy World One comedy horror musicals.<br><br>—<br><br><strong>Comments</strong> <br><br><strong>Marcel Chevalier, DBS — 1 November 2014<br></strong>...wasn’t there supposed to be a Klingon in this? I feel cheated. People shouldn’t say they’ll have a Klingon and then not have a Klingon. That’s just bad advertising.<br><br><strong>Elysa Webber, DO — 1 November 2014<br></strong>I think the Klingon was just a rumor, sweetheart. I mean, seriously did you <em>see</em> a Klingon in this mess?<br><br><strong>Benoit Fortier, DF — 1 November 2014<br></strong>Mess? It wasn’t a mess! It was...okay, it was a mess, because of all the food, but it was awesome!<br>Anyway, it’s not like you <em>paid</em> to not see a Klingon...<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS — 1 November 2014<br></strong>Wow, sudden flashbacks to college showings of Rocky Horror! Though I think the audience participation at the PPC will always trump that of any college showing. It’s the audience that makes the film an experience instead of a film. 10/10 would Time Warp again.<br><br><strong>Dawn McKenna, DMS — 1 November 2014<br></strong>I didn’t actually know about the audience participation until tonight, when it started and people were yelling things. And throwing things. I’m still a bit curious about <em>why</em>, but it was definitely fun! Nothing at all like my first viewing. Definitely all for Time Warping again, too...<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS — 2 November 2014<br></strong>Let me tell you, Rocky Horror is always better when seen with a group. When I lost my Rocky Horror virginity (that means going to see a public showing of it, get your mind out of the gutter by at least two inches, I beg you) they put a ‘V’ on my hand in lipstick and gave me a suggestively-frosted cupcake. I hope the Troupe continues doing this, it’s a glorious thing that must be shared with everyone of age at HQ.<br>Seriously, though, Dawn, did you live somewhere without a cool theatre club or something that did RHPS once in a while? That town is in desperate need of enlightenment.<br><br><strong>Eledhwen Elerossiel, DMS — 2 November 2014<br></strong>Chrissy, I hardly consider this to be ‘enlightenment’.<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS — 2 November 2014<br></strong>You also weren’t sure what to do with the noisemaker during the Time Warp scene. Nyeh.<br><br><strong>Dawn McKenna, DMS — 2 November 2014<br></strong>...I lived in the PPC? I’ve been here since I was fourteen, where exactly do you think I’d have managed to find a showing? I just watched it in my RC.<br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS — 2 November 2014<br></strong>-loud sigh-<br><br><strong>Eledhwen Elerossiel, DMS — 2 November 2014<br></strong>She means sorry, Dawn.<br><br><strong>Dawn McKenna, DMS  — 2 November 2014<br></strong>She can take it up with the Troupe, if it bothers her that much. But thanks for the apology.<br><br><strong>Luxury, DBS — 2 November 2014<br></strong>What? So mad I missed the auditions for this one! &gt;:(((((<br><br><strong>Jacques Bonnefoy, ESAS — 2 November 2014<br></strong>So were we, believe me. You would have been great. Maybe next year?<br><br><strong>Luxury, DBS — 3 November 2014<br></strong>You betcha! ;)))) I’ll be Frank next year. ;*<br><br><strong>Jacques Bonnefoy, ESAS — 3 November 2014<br></strong>Oh? You’re going to take that role from me?<br>Well, I guess I could always be Rocky… ;)<br><br><strong>Luxury, DBS — 3 November 2014<br></strong>Wanna be Rocky to my Frank right now? ;))))<br><br><strong>Jacques Bonnefoy, ESAS — 3 November 2014<br></strong>In just seven days (and six whole nights), I’m gonna make you <strong>[The rest of this comment has been censored due to inappropriate language.

I think.<br><br><strong>Fearn, DTO — 4 November 2014<br></strong>WERE I NOT A DALEK I WOULD FIND IT DISTRESSING THAT THE ONLY DALEK CAST MEMBER HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED! AGENT OMICRON PROVED A FINE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DALEK RACE IN THE ROLE OF DOCTOR SCOTT! THE SONG OF “EDDIE’S TEDDY” WAS PERFORMED MASTERFULLY! THE PERFORMANCE WAS ALSO A FINE REPRESENTATION OF THE LONG-EXISTING TENSIONS BETWEEN DALEKS AND TIME LORDS! <br><br><strong>The Reader, DIC — 4 November 2014<br></strong>It actually felt a lot like I was watching a Gallifreyan soap opera, what with all the Time Lords. I mean, we had Dis and the Agent as the young couple, an actual Dalek playing Dr. Scott, and the Notary as narrator/criminologist. It was perfect. I don’t think I can picture this being narrated by anyone but a neckless bureaucrat now. Well done, all.<br><br><strong>The Notary, DF — 4 November 2014<br></strong>How many times do I have tell you cretins that it’s a <em>collar</em>, for Rassilon’s sake?<br><br><strong>The Reader, DIC — 4 November 2014<br></strong>Oh, here we go. Rassilon this, Rassilon that—it’s always about our former Lord President with you, isn’t it? Let me tell you, if you ever get him to pay PPC HQ a visit, I’ll never fill out another form for you ever again. And that’s only the beginning... <br><br><strong>Fearn, DTO — 4 November 2014<br></strong>THE TIME LORDS ARE TRULY WEAK! YOU CLAIM TO RULE THE UNIVERSE AND YET YOU CAN BE DEFEATED BY A LACK OF PAPERWORK! <br><br><strong>Kozar, DIC — 5 November 2014<br></strong>I was impressed by Agent T’Zar’s acting. Vulcans are not known for a love of physicality. I highly commend her performance.<br><br><strong>Jean DuVallon, DIC — 5 November 2014<br></strong>Y’know, speaking of that scene, I could definitely go for some of that dancing from Dis. I’d be really happy to play Rocky in <em>that</em> scene. (Wonder what rehearsals were like… ;)) <br><br><strong>The Agent, DIC — 5 November 2014<br></strong><em>No</em>. <br><br><strong>Edgar Sullivan, DIC — 5 November 2014<br></strong>Honestly, I’m ashamed to have you in my department. Go think about good and appropriate ways to talk for a bit, would you? <br><br><strong>The Disentangler, DIC — 5 November 2014<br></strong>Two things, Jean: 1) I’m old enough to be your great-great-great-great-great grandmother, and 2) the rehearsals were actually really boring. So there. ;) <br><br><strong>Brenda Loringham, DMS — 6 November 2014<br></strong>Boring? How? <br><br><strong>The Disentangler, DIC — 6 November 2014<br></strong>Didn’t you guys notice how much we <em>didn’t </em>touch, despite the lyrics? All those Vulcan sensibilities and whatnot. If Jacques is going to do what he’s threatening to do up there in the earlier comments and play Rocky next year, you might get even more scandalous choreography. <em>I’m</em> not going to be Janet next year, if that’s the case.<br><br><strong>Edgar Sullivan, DIC — 6 November 2014<br></strong>...so, what you’re saying is that it should have been retitled “Touch-a Touch-a Touch-a Don’t Touch Me” for this performance? We must have missed out on so many great call-backs. <br><br><strong>The Disentangler, DIC — 6 November 2014<br></strong>Yeah, why didn’t you guys use that? It’s perfect. Almost as perfect as all the neck jokes and everyone yelling “Sue” at Janet. <br><br><strong>The Agent, DIC — 6 November 2014<br></strong>I nearly broke character when someone shouted “but Daleks can’t do the Can-Can” during the floor show. You guys were hilarious. <br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS — 6 November 2014<br></strong>My favourite callbacks were “that explains Edward Cullen” during “Sweet Transvestite” and “is your collar compensating for your lack of a neck” when the Notary/Criminologist held up a sign saying that it was a collar during the Time Warp scene! <br><br><strong>Nerys Carpenter, DO — 6 November 2014<br></strong>My favorite was “borrow Jack’s wriststrap” for every time Brad asked to use Frank’s telephone. <br><br><strong>The Notary, DF — 6 November 2014<br></strong>Mine was “beam me up, there’s no intelligent life down here” when Brad called Dr Scott “Scotty”, because I completely agree with it.<br><br><strong>The Reader, DIC — 6 November 2014<br></strong>You <em>would</em>. And I liked “this better be good, we killed you last week”. It was very appropriate, since so many Assassins were in attendance.<br><br><strong>Jacques Bonnefoy, ESAS — 6 November 2014<br></strong>My favourite callback, in case anyone cared to know, was “hey Riffy, show us Laurel” when Riff-Raff opened the coffin during “Time Warp”. Though all of the classic callbacks were also great.  <br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS — 7 November 2014<br></strong>Oh and before I forget, all the “elbow sex” comments too! I mean, they’re an RHPS classic, but they’re especially funny given the context of this performance. <br><br><strong>Eledhwen Elerossiel, DMS — 7 November 2014<br></strong>I think the Calaquendi agents were actually shocked when they first heard those comments. <br><br><strong>Christianne Shieh, DMS — 7 November 2014<br></strong>It’s nice to see them let loose and not be so David Beckham and Posh Spice all the time. Though I’m disappointed that they didn’t use their real hair in the performance.<br><br><strong>Eledhwen Elerossiel, DMS — 7 November 2014<br></strong>I assure you that Naergondir would rather face Melkor’s armies alone than shave his head to play Riff-Raff. It is fact. <br><br><strong>Gerda Kent, DOI — 8 November 2014<br></strong>What’s riff-raff? and Why are you talking about David and heads shaving and elbow sex? I could’nt go because Marsha at the nursury said I’m too young and I was tired from trick or treating anyway.<br><br><strong>Dawn McKenna, DMS — 8 November 2014<br></strong>...please tell me that’s a joke. And if it’s not, please tell me you’re the only kid doing this. <br><br><strong>Luxury, DBS — 8 November 2014<br></strong>I’ll tell you all about it when you’re older, Bradley ;)))<br><br><strong>Gerda Kent, DOI — 8 November 2014<br></strong>okay!!!<br><br><strong>Gerda Kent, DOI — 9 November 2014<br></strong>No, you won’t. - Bradley’s mother<br><br><strong>Luxury, DBS — 9 November 2014<br></strong>I’m going to tell him.<br><br><strong>Gerda Kent, DOI — 9 November 2014<br></strong>Don’t you dare! - Bradley’s mother<br><br>—<br><br>This was a joint writeup between me and DawnFire, thank you so much for helping and contributing! Also a quick apology to Wobbles for nabbing the Notary for a couple comments without permission; the opportunity presented itself and we are very sorry and will now return her in a hopefully recognisable form (plus another ostentatious collar).<br><br>Also posted <a href="http://lilywinterwood.tumblr.com/post/102363970596/ppc-multiverse-monitor-science-fiction-double">here</a>.<br></p>

            <p>My jesting in the previous reply aside, and I don&#39;t mean this in a rude or confrontational way at all, but when involving characters of mine in things like this in future I would prefer to at least be asked about it before people go charging full steam ahead? For instance, making up Brad&#39;s mother out of whole cloth - I&#39;ve been trying to find space in my writing to do stuff with that family, and while I&#39;ve admittedly finished diddly-squat in nearly four years a) I&#39;m making an earnest attempt to fix that, and b) it still would&#39;ve been nice to check.<br><br>Sorry if this is coming off a little blunter than I intended, this early in the morning my filter isn&#39;t at its best, but I thought I should bring it up.</p>

            <p>Because I thought they were just some random folks whose kid just happened to write to the MM at the tender age of six, and that there wasn&#39;t some greater story planned for it. <br><br>Wow, I&#39;m sorry about that. Will keep this in mind next time.<br><br>Also, i t was hard enough to coordinate me and Dawn for this given our homework workloads, so we didn&#39;t really consider adding a third writer to these series of reviews. But if you want to get involved with reviewing As You Like It, then by all means come talk with us on gmail. (It&#39;s also possible that there could be two critics for the MM because all this troupe does for the most part is Shakespeare, and as KittyEden pointed out there could be two theater groups and the other handles more contemporary stuff. In that case two critics specializing in two different types of theatre -- classical versus contemporary -- could be needed.)</p>

            <p>But yeah, I&#39;ve actually had Brad Kent and his dad show up in a thing I&#39;ve written and I&#39;d been considering doing things with those characters on and off, which I probably should&#39;ve made more clear when we did the Monitor episode but for some reason I assumed y&#39;all just sorta knew because nobody asked. In this specific case it&#39;s not a <i>huge</i> deal but I wanted it out there for future reference.<br><br>I do sorta like the idea of splitting up the reviews,  but I&#39;d also imagined Stan as sort of the main critic - only thing being of course he likes what he likes and is pretty vocal about what he doesn&#39;t, and there didn&#39;t seem to be a huge amount going on for him to review other than theatre. But lots of places split up critic teams like that. I&#39;ll hit you up on gmail.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll take note of that, sorry about the confusion.<br><br>And yeah, I imagine that he&#39;d do most of the critiquing around here, but maybe he tends to review more contemporary theatre pieces like the Glorious Revolution or other things that (taking Kitty&#39;s suggestion) Acting Out has done? I can definitely see a sort of theatre group semi-rivalry (with occasional borrowing and lending of tech and actors and the constant scramble for rehearsal spaces) with A Troupe By Any Other Name. <br><br>I mean, it seems weird since Stan is the resident old codger who&#39;d probably really love Shakespeare, but maybe he doesn&#39;t like the fact that the Troupe insists on setting Shakespeare in weird locations like Gallifrey and the Vulcan satellite planet (or tidally-locked planet, whatever) T&#39;Khut. <br><br>(Actually that might be an interesting setting for a tragedy like Othello, a Vulcan scientific base on T&#39;Khut with a very inhospitable exterior which doesn&#39;t allow for escape.

            <p>It&#39;s hard to be all that inflexible when you work somewhere that draws people in from all of creation after all. But I&#39;ll talk more of that in email, since I sent it to you like you asked.<br><br>(I do like the idea of multiple theatre groups and rivalries and such though. Makes the PPC feel a little more alive - and I admit I&#39;d felt a bit hard up for things for Stan to review.)</p>

            <p>Maybe if I ever get around to getting Permission, Agent!Kitty could start a group amongst the younger end. I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be insanely thrilled to do it. And I do mean, &#39;insanely&#39;.<br>The first thing she&#39;d do is attempt to get everyone remaking <i>Pitch Perfect</i> and then start getting annoyed when she realized that absolutely no one in the PPC can sing a cappella.<br>And then she&#39;d do Wicked. <br><br>Speaking of which, you should totally do Wicked next!

            <p>Which means that the rival group would probably do more contemporary theatre, and probably musicals too.<br><br>However, I would probably die of laughter if the Troupe and Acting Out collaborated for Romeo et Juliette or West Side Story -- and split themselves up into Montague and Capulet camps almost immediately. (I&#39;m more partial to the idea of them doing Romeo et Juliette because it is a lovely adaptation of the original play with some really gorgeous songs and also a COLOUR SCHEME and Mercutio being a cutie patootie who mostly hangs with the Montague boys and oh the Hungarian version is a dystopian AU version and it is gorgeous).</p>

            <p>As soon as I get Permission, I may well start up Acting Out. <br>The Romeo and Juliet would be brilliant, especially if the two people playing Romeo and Juliet were, like, dating or married out of play.<br>There would be a very complex underplot there.</p>

            <p>...that makes me wish that the PPC HQ existed in World One so we could all get together and do this sort of thing every week. Sometimes when I read these, I pretend I was actually there. I love acting! Wish I was a part of A Troupe By Any Other Name.<br>Sudden idea! Someone could write a rival theatre group called &#39;Acting Out&#39;.<br>...what? A bit of healthy rivalry never killed anyone. Well, okay, occasionally it did, but <i>that isn&#39;t ever mentioned in my school anymore.</i><br>Another wild idea. If I ever get the time to come to a Gathering (and you could even do it without me. But I&#39;d never forgive you) we could write the script for a PPC-themed musical/play in advance, and film it on location.<br><br>I&#39;m insane, aren&#39;t I?

            <p>I don&#39;t know the musical, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing jokes in that part, but I absolutely love the comments field!  I don&#39;t recognize/remember all the PPC characters, but the interactions are still great.  I like the Dalek&#39;s all-caps typing, and the fact that he (it?) gets ignored by the Time Lords as a group.  Also, I almost feel legitimately bad that Luxury missed out.  She&#39;s free-to-use; she&#39;s supposed to get a free pass to everything!<br><br>I also like the implication that Marsha is working in the Nursery now, although I thought Laburnum was planning for her to become a DBS agent?

            <p>Hey all,<br><br>While I was waiting for things to work out for my collab partners, I decided to work on a new mission. This is technically the fifth mission in chronological order, but it&#39;s the third one I&#39;ve worked on solo.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lnnlm9DEmFa2FLFbeFCJVUu-v_eGGqvdTho1KHC6j44/edit?usp=sharing">Scarlet Disgrace</a><br><br>I&#39;m pleased to report that my Floaters have recruited a new agent who is open for adoption - a vampiric Replacement of Robin! Notable characteristics of this adoptable are as follows:<br>- Derived from Robin from the Teen Titans animated series, but was turned into a vampire.<br>- Three years older than the canonical Robin, likely taller and more well-built.<br>- Pale skin and long black hair; left eye is missing, right eye is red.<br>- Has vampire fangs and drinks blood; can use limited shadow manipulation.<br>- Originally stated to die when exposed to sunlight, but this can be modified (he was sent to Medical upon being recruited to treat this effect).<br>- Can be dressed in any outfit his new owner wishes, but prefers to dress in black and similar to a DC superhero.<br>- Owns a black cat and former CAF named Sparda, with prominent fangs, like <a href="http://skarmorysilver.tumblr.com/post/100367599361/neverlookidly-fantasynolife-have-i-ever">this</a>.<br><br>If anyone who has an interest and knowledge in the DC Comics continuum is interested in adopting this character, feel free to send an adoption request to my e-mail (<a href="mailto:skarmorysilver@gmail.com">skarmorysilver@gmail.com</a>)!<br><br>And in the meantime, I&#39;ve started up a new RC as well! I wanted to test out the idea I posted on the Board a while ago (before Des derailed the thread, which he had every right to do; my sympathies go out to him once again). The idea here is that an agent accidentally sends a Sue-Wraith into the PPC HQ and ends up being partnered with her as a punishment; the Sue, meanwhile, is bound by canon and forced into work as an agent herself.

            <p>NOTE: Everything I am about to say is not meant with any vitriol or mean-spiritedness. I am merely responding as honestly as possible. Sometimes I can be a bit blunt in my expression. If I offend in any way, I apologize. It is not intentional on my part.<br><br>Like hS, I think this is going to have to be split between the mission and the stuff with your new agents. I’m going to start with the new agents stuff first because it’s a bit shorter, plus because I honestly need a bit of breather to clear my head after reading your fic.<br><br>Let’s start off with the story itself. First off, I feel that the scene with Harry and E.V.L.!Cho could have been a lot more dramatic if the audience wasn’t immediately tipped off to this being not the real Cho. Had she kept the facade up for a bit longer before going into the evil gloating, it might have held a bit more shock. Also, the contents of the paragraph that begins “<i>As she opened the door to the hospital wing</i>” are pretty much repeated beat for beat in her following dialogue with Harry; trading her soul, convincing Mad-Eye, and so forth.<br><br>Why does Rayner use the Patronus charm instead of a Binding spell? I guess that might have to do with the “aggression ahead of tactics” thing that the original Rainbow Dash had, but I still have to ask.<br><br>How does Rayner survive fighting an unkillable Mary Sue demon hand-to-hand for three solid minutes? Three minutes is a long time in physical combat, especially when your opponent is essentially Satan. No PPC agent survives that.<br><br>Minor SPaG note: it’s “Ukrainian Ironbelly,” not “Ukranian Ironbelly.”<br><br>Overall, it’s not great. Too much of this doesn’t make sense. In addition to all the questions I had above: If E.V.L. is so dangerous, why was Rayner alone? She sounds like the kind of Sue that should have been tackled by multiple groups and not a single person. Also, why do the Flowers capture the wraith instead of destroying or incapacitating it (I’ll touch on that again later)?<br><br>As for Rayner and E.V.L. themselves… they’re not good characters. Not at all.<br><br>Both of them are tremendously overpowered. First, we have a supersonic speedster who can become a blood-fueled berzerker apparently capable of “<i>destroying everything and everyone between him and his perceived prey</i>.” While that might be interpreted as a weakness, it’s not something that’s going to make me fear for Rayner’s safety. It makes me fear for those around him. Somebody that potentially dangerous to everyone around him… why would he even be recruited?<br><br>Rayner is also boring to me because he is, as you say, a male version of Rainbow Dash. It feels uninspired, like you just swapped out a few tertiary details but kept all the major personality bits from the original canonical character. The only major things that feel different are his gender, his being human, his desire for vengeance, and the berzerker powers. I don’t mind if a character is a badfic rescuee, but I want to see original characterization and not an canonical wearing a new suit.<br><br>E.V.L… that seems pretty self-explanatory. She’s literally an unkillable Mary Sue demon. Even discounting that the PPC would not recruit an obvious Mary Sue spirit (‘cause, you know, the job and all), unkillable is not interesting. If a character is not imperiled by their task in some way, then there’s no point to the story. Performing the duty is like brushing one’s teeth; not even menial enough to be potentially humorous in a vaguely bureaucratic way.<br><br>Also, I’m going to have to agree with what hS said below. The PPC potentially has access to every piece of canonical magic and technology ever made. The PPC has destroyed Sues with the power of gods before this point. There are lots of continuums that have rules for permanently destroying demons. The PPC would find a way to kill (or eternally imprison) her. If all else fails, there are the Reality Rooms.<br><br>These characters also, to my mind, don’t fit the PPC universe. Rayner seems to be, when you boil him down, a grim berzerker. Grim characters only really work in the PPC as it stands when their attitude is played for laughs. They become snarky straight men – see Derik for an example, or even Supernumerary and Xericka to some extent. <br><br>E.V.L. is completely out of place, and not just because she’s a Sue. I was very dismayed to see “sadism” and “serial killer” being used to describe her. PPC agents are not torturers. PPC agents do not kill for fun or for sport. Psychopathic agents are not fun to read.<br><br>One final minor point: why is E.V.L. from the Bible? The PPC doesn’t do Bible missions of any stripe. There are too many worms in that particular can.<br><br>I&#39;d very much like to know your answers to the following questions: why did you create these characters? What sort of missions do you see them tackling as agents? How do they fit into the PPC as a whole?<br><br>Thank you for your time.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>I am not offended, don&#39;t worry, but I am *very* concerned for my agents now that these issues have been brought up, and if the execution didn&#39;t fly with you, then I offer my apologies for it. The general idea I was thinking of here was that the Sue would be accidentally life-bound to Rayner - the very reason she cannot be killed off is because Rayner would have to be killed as well, and I don&#39;t know if the DMS can afford to lose an agent. The long list of abilities I did for both of my agents may have been a habit stemming from my own fiction doing similar things - the power levels of just about everyone are that overboard because they need to be. I doubt this is the case in the PPC, so I&#39;ll probably brainstorm remedies for this for each of my agents.<br><br>Looking back, Rayner being OP was due to giving him all of the characteristics of Rainbow Dash by default, something most MLP humanizations don&#39;t do (even Equestria Girls avoided this until the climax). If it&#39;s better that he doesn&#39;t have any superhuman abilities to begin with, which I&#39;m sure it is for this context, then I can live with it. That being said, the frenzy mode is one of the things that made him unique in the first place, and I&#39;ll probably keep it for the sake of drama, but if it endangers other people then I may have to at least change it. What if instead, the frenzy mode primarily endangers himself, Leeroy Jenkins style? He could end up charging into situations he can&#39;t win, underestimate what the targeted Sue is capable of, and get himself hurt. A lot. Like Eren&#39;s Titan form, it would be interesting to explore the frenzy mode and its consequences as a plot device, with his partner constantly trying to keep his instincts from ruining the mission. Maybe there could even be a mission with an unforseen setback in that the very setting triggers the frenzy mode, and Rayner&#39;s partner will have to keep him restrained and finish the mission herself at the same time.<br>While Rayner is a badfic rescuee, techincally speaking, it&#39;s also true that he could use some characteristics to distinguish him from the canon he is based off of. To pull ideas out of the air, he&#39;s been through a lot of nasty stuff, so one thing I could think of is that he was severely broken by his past and PPC experiences. To this end, an Eren Yager-like &quot;I must kill ALL OF THE SUES&quot; mentality would be a good start - a Suvian character did kill his last partner, after all.<br><br>Regarding E.V.L., I initially thought that being unkillable was the reason she was recruited in the first place. But again, it wouldn&#39;t make for an interesting story, because she&#39;s supposed to be at risk too most of the time. As noted, the life-binding idea is one that I&#39;d like to explore in the missions proper, especially since it would help me experiment with a hero/villain team-up like I intended. However, if she can&#39;t be killed, it wouldn&#39;t make a good story, while if she is killed straight away, I can&#39;t explore her character. Hmmmm... How about I make it a two-way connection? The life binding could mean that if either Rayner or E.V.L. dies, the other dies as well. So not only would this give the Flowers a reason not to just dispose of her (because it would mean having to also get rid of one of their own agents), but Rayner would also have a reason to protect her himself.<br>E.V.L.&#39;s inclusion in the PPC was a means of exploring how an openly antagonistic character would react and adjust to being forced to fight on the side of good, or in this case how a bona fide Mary Sue (not an ex-Suvian like Anjilly&#39;s Joyce Reesin, but an actual Sue) would feel about killing stuff on par with the very material that created her in the first place. The fact that she&#39;s bound by canon will probably prevent her from using much of her powers at all, which would also force her to make do without being OP (and this goes doubly for disguises, which would prevent her from using her powers at all), so I could have her lament that she can&#39;t use her Suvian abilities only to be shot down by Rayner telling her that it was for her own good.<br>So overall, E.V.L. would probably be the of &quot;Broken Bird&quot; stereotype, since while the snarky straight man approach was proposed for Rayner, I think it fits better with her instead, as I see Rayner as being the more eager and passionate of the two when it comes to assassination. I also apologize for not realizing that sadistic Sue torturing is not something the PPC would approve of, so I&#39;m getting rid of her sadism entirely.<br><br>Rayner&#39;s Patronus charm is consistent with his aggressive tactics, and is also based on Sandra and Freckles&#39;s exorcism selection and the Bella Black Driftwood mission, since this does take place in the Harry Potter continuum. I will probably also have to retcon the prologue so it would make more sense in light of all of the above information - Rayner would probably have a harder time fighting E.V.L. straight on, and given the above information, he&#39;d probably get Worf&#39;d in ten seconds flat.

            <p>The revised frenzy mode, as you describe it, sounds less like a berserker state and more like just how early-series Rainbow Dash actually is (I have no idea who Eren is, so I can&#39;t comment on the comparison there). I&#39;m not really sure what to suggest in this case. It might just take some experimentation to see what works for Rayner&#39;s character.<br><br>I&#39;m still confused why E.V.L. needs to be a Mary Sue in the first place, especially since most of her Sue powers would be bound away. Why not just make her a regular canon-based demon? She can still end up being bound to Rayner through the whole blood magic thing. She can still antagonistic towards the PPC and its goals, albeit in a &quot;this is all pointless, my dark masters will destroy everything eventually&quot; kind of way. I might even argue that it provides a better story explanation as to why the Flowers would recruit her.<br><br>Consider the following. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re a Troper based on your referencing of &quot;Broken Bird.&quot; I think that&#39;s the wrong trope to approach in this regard (especially since that E.V.L. doesn&#39;t really fit the definition as given; what traumatic event in her past besides &quot;being captured&quot; would make her cynical? Her strength hardly seems facade-like to me). Look at this more like a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">Boxed Crook</a> scenario. The Flowers could just have E.V.L. banished to a pocket dimension prison or something. She won&#39;t die, but neither will she threaten the order of canon. However, she is allowed to go relatively free (albeit in a reduced state) in exchange for her services fighting Sues. Hardly much of a choice there, but killing these &quot;Sues&quot; is better than spending all of eternity outside of space and time.<br><br>Just some idea I wanted to spitball. It&#39;s ultimately up to you.</p>

            <p>(I go out to have dinner with some friends, and my thread gets derailed by a discussion about the origins of Lilith in Babylonian mythology? Geez, you guys... XD)<br><br>Anyway, the idea behind E.V.L. being explicitly Suvian was to provide a unique viewpoint as far as PPC characters go. Most Sues who get recruited by the PPC are willing to balance their abilities and character for the sake of storytelling. E.V.L., on the other hand, had to have her power restrained by force, and similar to what you suggested, she would believe that ridding the world of badfic would ultimately be a Sisyphean ordeal. Essentially, she hates doing the Duty, but has no choice on the matter and nothing else to do.<br>Yeah, I do use Tropes a lot, and it&#39;s how I found the PPC in the first place. The Boxed Crook trope does sound more appropriate now that I&#39;ve looked it up, and the pocket dimension prison works pretty well for her too. I could have her mention that since the Flowers can&#39;t afford to sacrifice Rayner, they offer to either imprison her or have her actively help her captor kill badfic. The latter, of course, being the lesser of two evils.<br><br>Ultimately, the way I usually develop my characters is through an active process, letting them gain strengths and weaknesses as they go. I could probably compromise the dilemma of either E.V.L. being a Sue or an ordinary OC by having her start with a Suvian mentality, believing that these characters aren&#39;t as bad as they seem, but gradually changes her opinion once she finds out how awful most of them really are. Likewise, Rayner adjusting to his condition will likely be a subplot throughout my DMS missions, with E.V.L. attempting to help even if she doesn&#39;t know what the Hell she&#39;s supposed to do about it.<br><br>I guess it was my mistake to post the initial bios without having them beta-reviewed, sorry to say.

            <p>I see that you&#39;ve made a lot of the changes that you said you would. However, you seem to have missed a question that PC raised--a question that I would like to see answered as well. What do you mean when you refer to E.V.L.&#39;s home canon as the Bible.

            <p>The (extended canon) bit was actually there from her conception, as the canonical Lilith is technically a canon from the extended Biblical mythos (she first appeared in the Babylonian Talmud and was since adopted by Jewish mythology), and E.V.L. was technically intended as a Character Replacement of that particular figure.<br><br>If that doesn&#39;t work out, I could always go with Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy as her home continuum, as it&#39;s the most appropriate one I could think of.

            <p>If that&#39;s the case, then perhaps you can list her home continuum as &quot;Babylonian mythology,&quot; especially given that the current canon designation is a bit confusing and that the Lilith-demon is not mentioned in the Bible, AFAIK. (BTW, nowhere in the bio do you mention that E.V.L. is based off of the mythological Lilith. You might want to add that detail.)</p>

            <p>Ah, Lilith. Whether she&#39;s mentioned in the Torah is... basically the whole question. Her existence in the Talmud comes about because of the structure of Genesis 1+2. It goes like this:<br><br>-God creates the world.<br>-God creates humanity, male and female.<br>-Adam wanders around alone.<br>-God creates Eve from Adam.<br><br>The observation that this seems to imply two creations of women - one simultaneously with Adam, one significantly after - is what led to the Lilith story. She&#39;s &#39;Adam&#39;s first wife&#39;, created alongside him - and since she was later replaced, she must have done something <i>really bad</i>. Quite how that translated into &#39;dominatrix who consorts with demons&#39;, I&#39;m not really sure.<br><br>(Of course, it&#39;s <i>just</i> possible the narrative at that point isn&#39;t strictly linear... no? No, of course not, that would be ridiculous. Demons it is, then)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Babylonian Talmud is the version of the Talmud - essentially the written version of the Jewish oral tradition - that has its origin in Babylon (as opposed to the Jerusalem Talmud). It&#39;s basically <i>The Tanakh: Extended Edition</i>. (This is the &#39;really really basic explanation&#39;, you should probably find someone, uh, Jewish to give a better version).<br><br>Babylonian <i>mythology</i>, on the other hand, is the place where Gilgamesh, Ishtar, Marduk and the like hang out; it&#39;s related to Jewish mythology only by virtue of coming from the same general geographical region.<br><br>Basically this would be like saying &#39;Oh, <i>Harry Potter</i>? You could say he comes from <i>Discworld</i>, then&#39;, since they&#39;re both British series with a school for wizards in. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>/clears throat/ Okay, let&#39;s do this.<br><br>Essentially, your basic explanation is pretty accurate. The Babylonian Talmud was the one written by the Jews who were exiled to Babylon; the Jerusalem Talmud was not actually written in Jerusalem, but it was written by the Jews who stayed in Israel (it&#39;s just that they mostly weren&#39;t in Jerusalem by that point, but rather in varying places across the country).<br><br>The Talmud itself is actually an expansion of the Mishnah, which was the written-down version of the oral tradition/oral Torah; Rabbi Judah HaNasi codified the Mishnah due to the rising fear that all the rabbis would be killed, and the tradition would be lost. However, the oral Torah was actually not supposed to be written down...so he wrote it in as few words as possible. This caused much confusion for later generations.<br><br>The Talmuds were later written in order to a, figure out exactly what the Mishnah&#39;s talking about, and b, to discuss such things as whether the law must be updated for the current time. Both were written over quite a number of centuries and generations, which are actually divided into at least five or six categories (with the modern-day scholars being part of the last one). They feature different people, slightly different styles of Aramaic, and one will occasionally cover a topic from the Mishnah that the other doesn&#39;t (most notably the topic of laws that only apply in Israel). The Talmud also provides insight into the people involved in the conversations it records (the coolest description I&#39;ve ever heard of it was something like &#39;the Talmud makes it sound like all the rabbis of various time periods and places are sitting together and conversing.&#39;<br><br>This, of course, is occasionally coupled with stories, which are generally meant to teach you something but also sometimes say funny or interesting things about the rabbis in the stories). I don&#39;t entirely know how it is in other schools, but in my high school Talmud classes we ended up with a lot of laughter and many inside jokes. (I don&#39;t mean to imply that we didn&#39;t learn a <i>lot</i>, because we did; we just had a whole lot of fun doing it).<br><br>The Talmud (both of them) follows the structure of the Mishnah, and is divided into sections (&quot;orders&quot;), which are then divided into smaller sections (&quot;tractates&quot;). Each tractate can easily span 1-3 volumes, although they admittedly come published with commentary; I believe there are 62 tractates in total, although my numbers could be off. Either way, it&#39;s very, very long. (Tanakh, Extended Edition indeed!) The Talmud as a whole is, along with the Mishnah and, of course, the Tanakh, one of the most important books in Judaism, even today. Why? Because whatever law you can possibly be unsure of, it&#39;s been discussed and recorded in there. And even if it hasn&#39;t, there&#39;ll be something similar that can help you out.<br><br>Due to the Talmud&#39;s length, there have been a whole lot of people who made halakhah/law books--sort of &#39;Talmud: Condensed Edition&#39;, if you will. The lengthier of these are usually just going through the Talmud--yes, all of it--and recording <i>only the decisions</i>. Did I say &#39;just&#39;? Ha. No. It&#39;s a huge job, and probably took years.<br><br>But why, you ask, would anyone have to record the <i>decisions</i>? Surely they&#39;d only have to filter out the stories?<br><br>Well, no. I mean, yes, a lot of the stories don&#39;t contain rulings on law. However, you remember when I mentioned conversations earlier? Yup. That&#39;s what the majority of the Talmud is: two rabbis have an argument. One says that tree branches cannot be collected on a holiday under any circumstances; the other says that if they were already on the ground, it&#39;s fine. This debate is recorded. A century later, another rabbi says to his study partner that branches can only be collected from the ground if it&#39;s certain that they fell there that morning; his study partner tells him that that&#39;s ridiculous, because the proof that the original second rabbi brought in (a hundred years ago) clearly states that the branches fell and were collected--that is, immediately collected. Fifty years later, one student quotes this debate to <i>his</i> study partner, who promptly bangs his fist on the table and brings in proof that says the original proof only applies on weekdays, thereby negating it. Their teacher then comes over, and says, &quot;What, do you really think that&#39;s right? Impossible! I have <i>further</i> proof that means that the first proof still works, and also negates the one you just brought in. The law is with the original second rabbi, done.&quot; And then they probably argue over it for a while, but the Talmud only really records the boiled-down message of what each one says, and so the extra arguing isn&#39;t recorded. The Talmud then states that the teacher is right, the law is with the original second rabbi, and the case is closed.**<br><br>(Proof here is sentences from the Tanakh that indicate law or that can be used in conjunction with other sentences to indicate law. For example, in a discussion on whether or not girls should be taught Torah, the quote &quot;and you shall teach your sons&quot; is often brought up, with the addendum &#39;--your <i>sons</i>, and not your daughters&#39;. That particular debate, however, has continued through many centuries and many opinions, and has reached the point where a number of rulings say that it&#39;s perfectly fine for girls to study Torah, Talmud, and all the rest of it. This is what enables me to be sitting here and writing about my high school Talmud class; while the school is a, mixed gender, and b, has students from most of the religious denominations of Judaism, they would definitely have received backlash from part of the community if we were still living, say, in Talmudic times. Or several hundred years ago. Have you ever seen <i>Yentl</i>? There were certainly exceptions, but for the most part girls were limited to lessons from the Torah.)<br><br>Mind you, these conversations were not recorded at the time they happened. Instead, they were passed down through memorization.<br><br>That&#39;s right. For years, people memorized the Talmud--yes, all of it--and taught it by reciting it. Presumably, the new debates were added in as they arose. (Obviously, no one person memorized the whole thing, but people would know an entire book. Or two. It makes studying it today in written form sound so simple.) I don&#39;t currently remember when (or why) it was written down, though I assume the &#39;why&#39; is yet again because they were afraid it would be lost. As the Talmud is the Jewish people&#39;s most major book of law, losing it would be a great tragedy.<br><br>Mind you, not everything that Jews do today--or even in the past--is written in the Talmud. A whole lot of things arose through tradition, which was then accepted into the general religious culture; one rabbi actually states in the Talmud that traditions can become the halakhah (or law) simply by virtue of being so widely accepted. (This is as far as I remember; there is a possibility that he or another person then negated that. I&#39;m pretty sure someone said that traditions can occasionally or often become law, though, so if I&#39;m wrong...well, my bad. Sorry).<br><br>Anyway. While I could quite easily continue with this explanation of the Talmud, this does cover the major details, and is probably more than anyone was looking for. I&#39;m quite happy to make a sequel, though (which would include notes on the structure of the pages, and on who commentated, and what some of the stories are, and all of that).<br><br>(If anyone&#39;s curious: I studied Mishnah for...a year, I think, and Talmud for four. Well, technically it was six, but the classes got more serious in high school. I&#39;ve taken shorter courses since then, and have covered the history of the Talmud and the Mishnah and so on in Jewish History classes for more years than I&#39;d really care to try to count just now, including last year in a university course. So. That would be my credentials.)<br><br>By the way, hS, where on earth did you get your knowledge? It&#39;s extremely accurate, in both details and terminology.<br><br>~DawnFire, Jewish Studies major, signing off<br><br>PS: Word count says this is over 1,000 words. If you read it all, I commend you and hope it was interesting.<br><br>PPS: Forgot to mention--the Mishnah is written in Hebrew, while the Talmud essentially takes a sentence from the Mishnah and then records the debates and so on in Aramaic. The commentators come in very handy while studying it these days, as does a teacher. And the occasional dictionary or translation.<br><br>(Or, y&#39;know, an Aramaic class. I want to take one at some point. Apparently, one of the universities in my city offers one. But it&#39;s certainly possible to study Talmud without it! Why, I&#39;m living proof!)<br><br>/backs away from the computer and goes to make tea/<br><br>---<br>**I should mention that this case/exchange is completely made up; there is, however, at least one dealing with what you can do with branches that have fallen on a holiday, including what you can do if they&#39;ve fallen of their volition into your outdoor oven. I think it&#39;s in Masechet Beitzah (aka, Tractate Egg).<br><br>(It takes its name from the first word in the tractate, which is, of course, &#39;egg&#39;. Specifically, &#39;an egg that was laid on a holiday, the house of Shammai says it may be eaten, the house of Hillel says it may not be eaten.&#39; That was a fun tractate. Apparently, one of the physics teachers actually came into the other class to show them how an egg&#39;s structure meant that it <i>actually could be used to prop up a bed</i>--or in this case, a desk--<i>without breaking</i>. And yes, that&#39;s one of the purposes of eggs being discussed in the tractate. Pretty sure we were all incredulous when we first read that.)</p>

            <p>... came from the same place as most of my other knowledge: Wikipedia, plus random wanderings. I actually read a portion of the Talmud at one point, for want of anything else to do; I found the conversational-anecdotal style really interesting as a structure. Come to think of it, it&#39;s probably what&#39;s being referenced by the annotations to the <i>Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch</i> in <i>Good Omens</i>, with the whole conversation-carried-out-over-centuries thing.<br><br>One question I have is... not really a question: it sounds from what you&#39;re saying like the Talmud isn&#39;t really an authoritative document. It&#39;s more like a series of cases for and against certain readings, which implies that a) it can be disagreed with (on evidentiary grounds, naturally), and b) it could theoretically be added to? How far off the mark are those two notions?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hey, okay, I&#39;ve been reading this throughout a long work shift and I need to go sleep bed soon, so I&#39;ll say some stuff but not as much stuff as usual and then go bed sleep.  Sorry for short wording.<br><br>&quot;Scarlet Disgrace&quot;<br><br>Things I like:<br>-Sarah&#39;s forced references to <i>Incredibles</i>.  Shows pride in home.<br>--Also, fact that she has studied other superheroic continua.  Feels appropriate.<br><br>-Rashida not as demanding/controlling as early missions; shows character development, better leaderships.<br><br>-Falchion also character develops with the not speaking as Pteranothing.  Better self control/think before speaking.<br><br>-VERY LIKE intro with Beast Boy.  Like the unique angle and mostly untouched writing angle to explore.  Ties in well with Beast Boy&#39;s team-up with agents later.<br><br>-Having Beast Boy and Robin join up with agents.  You actually handled it very well here.  I think I&#39;m supposed to caution you here not to do it too frequently, but really I know other PPCers have had similar set ups in missions, and again, you did it well, and it&#39;s not that big a deal to me anyway.  (Old timey agents did way more character interaction than we do nowadays.)<br><br>Things I dislike:<br>-I know Cyborg was ignored by the fic, but you <i>also</i> ignore him until the finale.  He suddenly appears at the end of the mission, and this could confuse readers unfamiliar with the characters.<br><br>Things I meh:<br>Don&#39;t know if fic presented quite enough of vampire!Robin to warrant recruitment, but I guess it&#39;s better than just another uninteresting kill, and I pretty much did the same thing with Mollie and Ollie so yeah whatever works.<br><br>&quot;When Good Banishments Go Bad&quot;<br><br>I liked the setup here: that it looks like a fairly plain assassination, and then he gets to the SO&#39;s office and sees her there, I went, &quot;Wait, why did the Weeds bring her back <i>here</i>?&quot;  And then the SO drops the bomb that Rayner portalled her there, and I was uite shocked and surprised so kudos there.<br><br>*Ahem*  Okay, cutting the sleepy gag for a moment.  It&#39;s fine that you&#39;re into foot-tickling, and it&#39;s fine to represent that in your PPC writing.  I didn&#39;t bring it up on Sarah&#39;s profile back when you posted it, because I clearly saw the reason behind it in the fic from which she was recruited.  I see on this pair of bios that Rayner has ticklish feet and E.V.L. is mentioned to have &quot;huge&quot; feet.  I just want to make sure this isn&#39;t a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Pepper-jack_cheese">&quot;pepper-jack cheese&quot;</a> situation: Are these traits a part of these characters&#39; person, something that helps to define them and identify them?  Or are they something you, as the author, want to see there?  Again, I want to stress that I&#39;m not judging you in any way for your tastes; I&#39;m totally fine with you.  I&#39;m just asking this as a reflection exercise on designing the characters.  (If I&#39;ve offended anyway, please let me know, so I can do better in the future.)<br><br>Okay still sleepy almost 11 o&#39;clock, need to go review hS now bye.</p>

            <p>Regarding &quot;Scarlet Disgrace&quot;:<br><br>Thanks for all of the good points you have made about the characterization! And as for BB&#39;s intro and the team-up, I&#39;ve been meaning to do that ever since I found out that he barely showed up at all in the fic, which was interpreted by myself as him standing on the sidelines and facepalming at the whole thing. Robin&#39;s joining in was a last-minute addition when I decided on his character being replaced but I&#39;m glad that worked out too. BTW, Falchion was disguised as a Quetzalcoatlus; I find it interesting that this fact wasn&#39;t explicitly noted, but then again I hinted at the possibility of this species hypothetically existing within the continuum, so I guess it works out.<br><br>Cyborg actually is mentioned a few times during the beginning and throughout the badfic narration, though you&#39;re right in that he doesn&#39;t get that many lines until the end. I may go back and fix that up at a later time, but I don&#39;t know how much I can get away with - he wasn&#39;t that much more involved than Beast Boy was in the actual fic.<br><br>Regarding &quot;When Good Banishments Go Bad&quot;:<br><br>Again, thanks for the positive feedback on this one - something like this has been coming for a LONG time, and I hope it&#39;ll give me something to do should production get delayed for my Floaters team.<br><br>Concerning the fetishes, I was actually surprised that this was brought up as a point of discussion, and honestly, before reading a little closer, I actually had horrible flashbacks to a few years ago when I got a number of people mad at me for being a huge prick - these people labeled the very fact that I have a tickle fetish in the first place as a metaphorical red flag. This is why I have become extremely cautious about introducing it to any social group on the Internet, obvious niche interest groups aside. Granted, my first mission might have actually disabused that notion to some degree, since I co-authored the fic itself and thus showcased most of my interests while writing it, but it&#39;s a relief to see that I won&#39;t be judged for specific kinks nonetheless.<br>To answer your specific question, Rayner and E.V.L. both have fetishes incorporated into their respective history - the actual use I had planned for Rayner was an ask blog that included tickling among other content (though Cupcakes-inspired slash may have been involved, hint hint), and E.V.L. has incorporated my idea of female fanservice into some of her later revisions to her design (Her big feet are because she&#39;s a freakin&#39; amazon - not many of the women I&#39;ve met have come even close to 6 feet tall!). So I can say with confidence that fetishes have been a part of their character throughout their creative history, and exploring their sexuality in general is definitely something I&#39;ll consider for future missions with them (mostly in the NSFW missions, of course, gotta keep things organized around here).<br>Heck, I&#39;d probably even have E.V.L. take advantage of Rayner&#39;s ticklishness and his broken leg in the pre-mission of their first assignment together - after all, it&#39;s only fair that she&#39;d start off by being as intentionally annoying as theoretically possible.

            <p>I&#39;m not sure which bits of this I&#39;m going to reply to, so I&#39;ll just do it a bit at a time, starting in this post with Rayner and E.V.L.<br><br>The story/prologue is good; it really gets Rayner&#39;s character across, and E.V.L.&#39;s, er... psychoticness? Whatever. And the idea of a &#39;good&#39; (using the term loosely) and evil character being bound and forced to work together is always interesting - have you by any chance played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Divinity">Beyond Divinity</a>? Similar set-up.<br><br>But, er... why <i>can&#39;t</i> they just kill her? The PPC has access all the destructive technology in the universe. Why not just, say, wait for the next time DOGA decide to air out a Sun Crusher, drop her into the star in question, and then send it supernova? I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s not coming back from that, and since the Weeds can hold her down, she&#39;s clearly not overpowered enough to escape it.<br><br>One possibility occurs to me - bind her life to Rayner&#39;s. A magic spell which means anyone who tastes her blood is bound to her, and that in order for her to die, <i>he</i> would have to be killed as well, isn&#39;t exactly far-fetched - heck, it&#39;s just a straightforward adaptation of Horcrux technology. It wouldn&#39;t even need an edit to the prologue, since you haven&#39;t reached that point yet.<br><br>(It&#39;s probably a good thing he didn&#39;t get to send her to Dante&#39;s hell - I get the impression she would have taken it over)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The concept of blood magic as a means of immortality actually makes a lot of sense for E.V.L., and would be perfectly in line with her being a demonic entity. I may have her bring up the fact that since Rayner consumed bits of her when they first met, she&#39;s now bound to him and can only die when he does. So thanks for suggesting that idea!<br><br>I&#39;m unfortunately unable to play any video games at all nowadays due to way too many real life reasons, but I can understand the point you were making. I was thinking of this as a character development experiment, though, with both of them learning self control and respect for each other. While killing Sues, of course ;)<br><br>As an aside, not trying to pander for attention here, but I&#39;ve noticed that I haven&#39;t gotten a single request for a fanfic for these two to tackle yet - I don&#39;t know if I can get the time to look for promising candidates myself with studying and the like. ^^;</p>

            <p>Yes, the Wednesday Pluggage continues, but once again I&#39;m taking a week&#39;s break from <i>Driftwood</i> (I was busy at the end of last week, so I haven&#39;t had time to write it). Instead, here&#39;s not one, but <i>three</i> stories from the annals of the Continuity Council of Gallifrey-in-Exile.<br><br>(For previous Continuity Council exploits, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uy4SLX7yyCfirx6yCfOFrKdl9uK_wpFsqbnIevZEOFQ/pub">their introduction</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GzRQYiu9gJhIml3Hje_ubJM_AHMk3a1AdC5VP5dSp9w/pub">Continuity: Gallifrey Bickers</a>)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>1/ <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-BoSXcS-RHw6CpuYbD3AjKmMFDpRxWtqiPkwCTtQtU/pub">Continuity: Purge</a><br><br>Set last November, right after the showing of <i>The Day of the Doctor</i>. All of these should be considered to have spoilers for the end of that Anniversary Special, by the way. This introduces a new character for one of my favourite underused PPC locations; whether he has any relation to a certain fictional astronomer-dwarf of the same name is left as an exercise to the reader.<br><br>2/ <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bFaqnyKq4BQJ8z4_Zy9eVg5lbEptyC9RCnb9TrxTELk/pub">Continuity: Gallifrey Imminent</a><br><br>Taking place at some point after <i>The Day of the Doctor</i>. Specifically, it&#39;s set during <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10306717/1/The-Ispace-Wars">The Ispace Wars</a>, which probably makes it March/April of this year, but wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.<br><br>3/ <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JBKMke1txQ4sx7XVMpPjATWdHPsiuXmOyGBTINoKXKU/pub">Continuity: Tea</a><br><br>Set sometime in the last month or so. The first part of this was written by DawnFire, who was foolish enough to mention the Continuity Council; that meant I just <i>had</i> to pick it up. This one has actually been seen in its entirety on the Board. It doesn&#39;t have any real plot - it&#39;s just a vignette.<br><br>Apologies are probably due to all writers of Time Lords, particularly for &#39;Gallifrey Imminent&#39;. If I&#39;ve thrown anyone wildly OOC, do let me know and I&#39;ll fix it. Otherwise - reviews are always welcome!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I had meant that line as a joke, just because everyone&#39;s answer would be influenced by what canons they know.  I haven&#39;t read <i>Discworld</i> or <i>Young Wizards</i> (right?) (or <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, actually), so they just don&#39;t mean much to me.  Wasn&#39;t necessarily criticizing your picks, but since you asked:<br><br>I also haven&#39;t watched <i>Back to the Future</i> all the way through—long movie is long, and doctorlit gets antsy from sitting still too long.  But I would still pick Doc Brown, if only because Morgan seems to be a fan, and irony is tasty.  Plus, his continuum and <i>Doctor Who</i> seem to take similarly chaotic, sci-fi views towards time travel (from what little I&#39;ve seen of both shows), so he would have a fair idea of what&#39;s going on.<br><br>I would definitely have to pick <a href="http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Teferi">Teferi</a> from <i>MAgic: the Gathering</i>.  This is a man who not only survived major temporal trauma (being trapped in a slow time bubble mid explosion, and basically performing a single dive through flames to escape a burning room over a span of decades), but also fought against other planeswalkers (super-wizards) to stop their little conflicts from enveloping entire worlds.  He&#39;s also a powerful time mage himself, putting his own country out of &quot;phase&quot; with the rest of the planet to let it escape a global war.  Finally, he sealed off a series of time rifts that were threatening to destabilize (the same) world.  I think he&#39;s quite equipped to battle Time Lords!<br><br>For number three, a bit of cheating: the Ellimist and Crayak, both from <i>Animorphs</i>.  They&#39;re both beings with the power to basically create and change entire timelines at will, with a mind to making the universe the way they want it to be.  Neither would appreciate such a massive level of outside interference.  While they&#39;re normally enemies, I can imagine a team-up pretty easily; the Ellimist would go to far lengths to put his continuum back the way it should, and Crayak would want to continue his universe-size chess game unmolested.  (And, as a villain, he would be majorly targeted by the Continuity Council to begin with.)<br><br>Lastly, well—I really like your use of Jareth, actually?  He&#39;s not a charcter you would regularly associate with the concept of time, but when you think about how he can manipulate the Labyrinth, and people&#39;s minds, it&#39;s actually pretty clear he does wield some control over it.  Some might argue that his powers wouldn&#39;t work outside the Labyrinth, but you have to consider: Sarah&#39;s parents seem to be out to dinner an awfully long time, don&#39;t you think?  (I forget what they were doing, but whatever it was: dinner, movie, show, they shouldn&#39;t have been gone that long.)<br><br>So, yeah.  Again, it&#39;s just a familiarity thing, and I wound up ripping off half your list anyway.</p>

            <p>... that four-dimensional thing that shows up... ehhhh, it&#39;s been too long since I read this. Was it the one that gave Tobias back his morphing ability?

As to Jareth - time in the Labyrinth clearly passes at double speed, and he <i>does</i> have a line about reordering it. Then there&#39;s the fact that Sarah has about a minute to spare when she reaches the throne room - but spends way more than that in the Escher room. (I&#39;m not sure we ever knew what they did, actually - my memory cuts in with &#39;Your father and I go out very rarely-&#39;&#39;You go out every single weekend!&#39; and then some really terrible assumptions on the part of the wicked stepmother)<br><br>Also. Y&#39;know. He&#39;s magic. He can teleport. He can spontaneously change costume. He can hypnotise you with a peach (and I think there&#39;s a timeslip in that sequence, too).

            <p>I have the main series all lined up, so that measures up to: Just shy of two feet and six inches.

            <p>I have an <i>Animorphs</i> question that&#39;s been bugging me for a while: what color is Andalite blood? I&#39;ve looked around the internet, and apparently in book #29 there&#39;s a description of Ax&#39;s blood being blue-black. It seems legit—one person even gave a page number, 140—but I&#39;d still like to confirm it. In lieu of seeing it with my own eyes, could you lovely book-having folks double-check for me and give the full line?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I mean, iron gives red, copper we know gives blue-green... so that means you can derive blood-colour from the colour of the transition metal ions in solution/complexes. So... hmm...<br><br>... I am not the person to be figuring this out. I mean, yes, I know the <i>chemistry</i> - but being somewhat colour-blind means figuring out whether Chromium(III) solution is dark blue or dark purple is an impossibility.<br><br><a href="http://www.chemhume.co.uk/A2CHEM/Unit%202b/11%20Transition%20elements/oxidation_numbers.jpg">This lovely chart</a> shows colours for the top row - chromium or copper (II) could be blue on there.

            <p>But I can at least contribute a teensy bit of biology to this conversation.<br><br>Horseshoe crabs <s>which are not stingrays</s> have that copper (as hemocyanin) in their blood for carrying oxygen.  However, their blood is actually closer in color to the &quot;+2&quot; box under Copper in that table you linked, and then, only in large quantities.  Individual drops looks more like cloudy water:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8KlAmtIu1E#t=2m44s">This point in this video has examples of both colorings.</a><br><br>(I realize responding to a post where someone states they&#39;re color-blind by posting a video and saying LOOK THE COLORS is kind of horrible, so I apologize for that.)<br><br>(And yes, I am super-displeased by how that blood is collected.  I recognize the incredible medical value of their blood, and I would never deprive anyone in need of care of the products of that research, but <i>damn</i> there has got to be a more comfortable way for the horseshoes for sit through that.)<br><br>So something in horseshoe crab blood besides the copper in the hemocyanin affects/determines the coloring.  Again, I couldn&#39;t say what, because my chemistry (and medical) knowledge is quite poor.  So Andalite blood could also use a copper-based molecular structure for oxygen transport (Do they use oxygen?  They survive in Earth&#39;s atmosphere, but oxygen is a minority there, so it&#39;s not definitely what Ax was inhaling all those years.), but have other factors that darken the color of their blood.  Or, not use copper at all and have other elements in their bloodstream entirely.<br><br>—doctorlit waits for the inevitable debunking of everything he just said as being completely out-of-line with modern chemical knowledge.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d look at that blood and think &#39;blue-black&#39;. Hmm...<br><br>The question of whether Andalites are oxygen-fixers is an interesting one, but I think it&#39;s a non-starter; the only other option in Earth&#39;s atmosphere is nitrogen, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reactive enough to fill the oxygen role. I guess you could do something weird with the fact that fixed nitrogen is a fertiliser, and the fact that they eat grass... not sure the world is ready for algae-powered Andalites, though.<br><br>So, oxygen fixing. I&#39;ve just stumbled across the fact that cobalt can act similarly to iron in some organic molecules, and cobalt <i>is</i> known for its blueish colours. Cobalt(II) can be either blue or pink, and cobalt(II) iodide is actually described as blue-black - though I suspect that comes from the iodine.<br><br>Basically, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Bristol.blue.glass.arp.750pix.jpg">this colour comes from cobalt</a>, and feels very &#39;blue-black&#39; to me. Whether there&#39;s a viable haemoglobin replacement (coboglobin?) is an open question, but I&#39;d guess this is what they were thinking of with Ax.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As mentioned in the subject, there will be some off-topic rambling here and there. My apologies in advance.<br><br><u>Purge</u><br>This was probably my favorite of the three stories. A nice little exploration of an aspect of the PPC that isn&#39;t really talked about all that much. The Musee is a great concept that I&#39;d definitely like to see more done with in the future.<br><br>I liked the character of Dr. Cornelius. It was nice to see the juxtaposition of his curmudgeonly and reasonable aspects. He&#39;s also got a great name. That&#39;s a name that definitely fits <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Cornelius">an agent</a>. Lorelei felt a bit more flat to me, although that&#39;s probably just because of how short the story is.<br><br>I wanted to touch on your brief mention of the &quot;standard PPC uniform.&quot; Has the &quot;standard&quot; uniform ever been fully described? Its original mention in &quot;Vacation at OFUM&quot; just describes the uniform as being black. From what I&#39;ve read (and admittedly written), most &quot;uniforms&quot; in the PPC hardly fit the word. Get something with some black on it, a flash patch, and everything would seem to be golden.<br><br><u>Gallifrey Imminent</u><br>I liked the overall tone of this piece. Plus, this is the kind of concept that always interests me: the decline of the well-intentioned and the heroic into the dark side. I also liked the collection of heroes that you gathered to try and stop the council.<br><br>It did seem that the PPC fell pretty quickly. I know this is supposed to be a short story and Time Lords are pretty dang powerful, but the PPC (as you mentioned) pretty much has access to any weapon throughout the entirety of canon. They might not win - heck, they probably wouldn&#39;t win - but I&#39;d have to think they&#39;d at least bloody Gallifrey&#39;s nose a little.<br><br>Slight qualm: In &quot;Gallifrey Bickers,&quot; Morgan is one of those who were opposing the Notary&#39;s proposed takeover of the PPC (or that&#39;s how it seemed to me, anyway - maybe I missed something). I know this isn&#39;t the same situation, but what made her change her mind in this instance?<br><br><u>Tea</u><br>This was fairly pleasant, if a bit confusing at first. It took me a bit longer than I&#39;d like to admit to realize that the Continuity Council had jumped into another multiverse (and so easily, too!). It doesn&#39;t really tell me anything about the characters that I didn&#39;t already know or couldn&#39;t already figure out. Whereas the other two felt like stories that needed to happen in some way, this one just seemed a bit innocuous. It was still amusing, I just felt it was a bit weak compared to the other two.<br><br>All in all, more good and funny stuff. Keep &#39;em coming.<br><br>PoorCynic<br><br>PS: I will review &quot;Driftwood&quot; at some point, it just keeps slipping my mind. That post might be a multi-parter, though. Fair warning.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure we have an Sgent &#39;call me Lou&#39; and an Sgent &#39;don&#39;t you dare call me Lou&#39;ise; I think the Doctor is enough to separate the two agents.<br><br>Lorelei did end up with very little to do, sadly. Since she&#39;s free-to-use, I&#39;ll note that she&#39;s already had <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHfubKjf6k9l9MZAfFpacN9pjtnxkhI96C1AqUNBIL4/pub">an appearance in &#39;Ephemerals&#39;</a>, so she does have a <i>bit</i> of personality.<br><br>Morgan&#39;s &#39;standard PPC uniform&#39; is... well, black. ;) That&#39;s about all there is to it. The point is that she&#39;s <i>not</i> wearing robes - I think she described it on the Board once as &#39;What? I put on something orange, what more do you want?&#39;.<br><br>The fall of the PPC - two things. No, wait, three. First, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d specified how long the war took. Morgan says &#39;finally&#39;, so it could be years - or decades, even. That said, I think the &#39;fighting in the corridors&#39; section would be over quite quickly - and that leads me on to the second point:<br><br>This is a political speech. Morgan has no requirement to actually tell the truth. If you think about it, all she <i>needs</i> to have under her control at this point is DoSAT and the DoDAEG (and the Committee Room, I guess). The rest of HQ could be a warren of guerilla fighters which the Time Lords dare not enter into. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Iraq_War">Pretty sure we&#39;ve &#39;won&#39; a couple of wars that way recently.</a><br><br>And thirdly: yes, the PPC has access to all the multiverse&#39;s technology - but Morgan is a PPC agent. How much do you think she brought with her when she &#39;took a leave of absence&#39; and got herself elected? If she didn&#39;t take a portal generator, at minimum, then she missed out on a great opportunity.<br><br>But yes - there&#39;s clearly a story in there, and if someone decides they want to write it, I&#39;m not going to stop &#39;em.<br><br>Morgan&#39;s change of heart - this was deliberately left vague, because it <i>is</i> quite difficult to picture, but it&#39;s basically a combination of &#39;power corrupts&#39; - whatever the others may think, Morgan sees herself as the <i>de facto</i> President of the Continuity Council, and she also has a gun - and the Ispace Wars triggering all her protective instincts at once. Couple that with Upstairs refusing to admit there&#39;s a problem (they get round to it eventually, don&#39;t worry), and the stage is set.<br><br>Yeah, &#39;Tea&#39; is a bit weak, and I&#39;m not sure how well it holds up separated from the context of the thread. I might go back to it at some point - throw in a preamble, maybe even (gasp!) give it some purpose in life. I just thought, since it exists, it was better to have it filed and ready, rather than lost in the Board archives.<br><br>And: thanks for the reviews! It&#39;s always great when someone takes the time to ramble. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I got tangled up in my memories of the original RP, where he does <i>sort of</i> agree with the Notary - or, more precisely, when the Reader disagrees that the Council is more intelligent than the rest of HQ, the Librarian quibbles with <i>her</i>.<br><br>But that is a fairly key difference. At this point I&#39;m thinking the Librarian would probably &#39;defect&#39; to Morgan&#39;s side at some point - where &#39;defect&#39; just means &#39;stop fighting and set up shop in a library back home somewhere&#39;.

            <p>One thing I&#39;d been going to bring up I noticed upon searching archives I had mentioned to you a couple times before - no need to be redundant! As for the Originals question, it was really just to check if it&#39;d make sense to reference Osbert knowing him in things I plan to write with him (Monty, that is, not Cornelius). Though if it&#39;s okay, I might treat that &quot;nobody really interacted with agents in other departments until recently&quot; thing a little flexibly from time to time?</p>

            <p>Basically... basically Philae&#39;s in very genteel trouble. The primary battery had 60 hours life in it, which will run out early tomorrow morning GMT - probably around midnight tonight if you&#39;re in America. The secondary batteries need 5 watts* to boot up the lander, and only have ~3 on them, because of the sunlight situation - the landing spot only gives ~1.5 hours of light to the solar panel, rather than the 7 they were after (per 12-hour day)<br><br>*Apparently. That doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense as a unit, but that&#39;s what I&#39;m reading.<br><br>They think Philae is sitting with two legs on the ground, and the third - the one in the picture on the last post - slightly raised. They have managed to get most of the science done, and have actually deployed the drill - no results yet that I know of.<br><br>The next communication slot is 9-11 tonight GMT (so about, eh, mid-afternoon in America?); they think they&#39;ll get through, but it may be the last contact that works. So they&#39;re considering whether to try the various things that could shift Philae to get more light on its solar panels.<br><br>So yeah. It&#39;s not what everyone was hoping for - but at the end of the day, hey! We landed on a comet. That&#39;s pretty good going.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So World of Warcraft has finally come out with its latest expansion! Although I&#39;ve been on for three and a half hours, so far I&#39;ve only just gotten my Garrison set up thanks to massive lag, bugs, problems with reloading and having to play Pixelhunt the Quest Giver, made only more difficult by people mounting giant mammoths and standing on top of said Quest Givers. Jerks.<br><br>Still, I&#39;m excited! Who&#39;s excited?! Thoughts on what will happen? <br><br>Considering what happened at the end of Cataclyam, what with Thrall&#39;s... wife? Aggra being revealed as pregnant, I think Orc Jesus&#39; kid will have some part to play. Probably gonna get held hostage by the Iron Horde. Other than that though, I don&#39;t know what to expect since I&#39;ve been staying away from spoilers.<br><br>So, to all other PPC WoW players, feel free to share your own thoughts about the expansion here! :D</p>

            <p>Glad you found some more playable rewordings, though! And yes, we do need to set up a game sometime. We could make another post about it and ask people for their availabilities/time zones, and then decide on a time where the optimal amount of people can join in. It&#39;s how I&#39;ve organised these games in the Shakespeare fandom.</p>

            <p><a href="http://slashcg.com/slash/">Slash: Romance Without Boundaries</a>. It works pretty much like Cards Against Humanity, except that the goal is to get the &quot;Matchmaker&quot; to select your card for the funniest &#39;ship. I got to play a little this weekend, and it&#39;s pretty fun. *g*<br><br>I fully support a PPC version of Cards Against Humanity, too.

            <p>It sounds pretty fun/ny, particularly the &#39;harder&#39; variant where you have to make a story to go with your ship. The inclusion of a rule that you can discard anyone you&#39;ve never actually heard of is nice, too.<br><br>But... argh. I can accept Aragorn&#39;s description as &#39;1/32 Elvish on his father&#39;s side&#39; as a joke (much like the entirely accurate description of Treebeard as &#39;doesn&#39;t remember what girl trees look like&#39;).

            <p>Given the ban on doing missions for religious/Bible-based fanfic, what is the official stance on missions for canons that heavily refer to religious (esp. Biblical) mythology?  I&#39;m specifically thinking of the <i>Dresden Files</i> series, but <i>Supernatural</i> comes to mind as another example.  I&#39;m even more specifically thinking of <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7745091/1/When-Harry-Met-Eve">this Suefic</a>, featuring a Sue who is supposedly the Biblical Eve.  <br><br>Now, given that the Sue is the gorgeous, uber-powerful Queen of Sexy, she has very little in common with the actual Biblical figure, and personally I think there is a lot wrong with the Sue no matter what she is.  However, I don&#39;t want to offend anyone.  How do you guys feel about this?</p>

            <p>Both Supernatural and Good Omens have missions so obviously canons which borrow heavily from religion and myths are not off-limits.<br><br>However, having an Eve who is nothing like the biblical figure, would only be a charge if religious/mythological characters in DF are generally kept recognisable if and when they appear.

            <p>...and then I somehow manage to tap into the Continuity Council&#39;s communications. I&#39;m not complaining-- if the Council is up to something that might rile up the Daleks again, I want to see it coming-- but this is more than a little weird. Note to self: check the console for any vulnerabilities. This might be two-way. I sure as heck don&#39;t want people snooping around in my personal correspondance. <br><br>Anyhoo-- Cekarionalavanezya-- I&#39;d stay away from the Council. Before you say anything (and Morgan too if you somehow see this) yeah, I get what the Council is doing. We need to do everything we can so that the Whoniverse&#39;s canon is clean and ready for the Homeworld&#39;s return. On the other hand, we share HQ with some <s>Kaled filth</s> Daleks. These maniacs can&#39;t be reasoned with and will always try to one-up us Time Lords if we do anything. Case in point: HQ nearly blew up a while back when the Daleks decided they wanted their own private club too and pulled even more of their kind out of a temporal fold or something. <br><br>I know that it&#39;s not the Council&#39;s fault for this, but their very existence is a destabilizing element for the Daleks-- not that I care for the metal monsters. It boils down to this: either we kick the Daleks out of HQ (something I&#39;d be perfectly happy to do) and let the Council do its thing or we disband the Council and defuse the Dalek-Time Lord tensions here and now. The way I see it, joining the Council is encouraging it, which in turns makes the Daleks antsy, which in turn is bad news for the PPC at large.<br><br><br>I didn&#39;t live though an entire [CENSORED] Time War just to have the ancestral enemy ruin everything at the last minute. <br><br><br>-E</p>

            <p>Your reaction to a rising threat from Dalek elements in the PPC is to propose that we do <i>nothing</i>? Thinking like yours is the precise reason Lord President Rassilon was unable to prosecute the War with full effectiveness! All the Romanan faction&#39;s protestations about &#39;keeping things low key&#39; and &#39;attempting to negotiate a ceasefire&#39; achieved was to give the Daleks time to arm themselves and recruit allies among those just as bitter about Time Lord supremacy as themselves.<br><br>In HQ or on the Homeworld, Time Lords <i>need</i> guidance.

            <p>Part of my job as Tigereye Castellan is to look out for threats to the Continuity Council, and PPC Time Lords in general.

            <p>Dear Tigereye Castellan of the Continuity Council of Gallifrey in Exile,<br><br>I am Naya&#39;Keegan of the Department of Internal Affairs, Special Response division and also Emiranlanoamar&#39;s (aka the Guardsman) partner. I have just seen this thread on my newsfeed and I&#39;d like to address your concerns with the racist/speciesist remarks my partner has said. <br><br>First of all, I  apologize if any of his comments have offended you. He is known in the division for his general attitude about agents that are canonically lawful/neutral/chaotic evil but rest assured that the rest of the DIA is vehemently against such prejudices and that he has already been warned about his attitude. From my personal experience, he has never let his prejudices interfere with his Duty and it is very unlikely that they ever will. <br><br>Secondly, he has made quite a bit of progress since coming to HQ and he is still learning how not to see everything in terms of threat/not threat. He takes HQ&#39;s security very seriously but I think that being paranoid is a basic part of him-- but that is no excuse for speciesism, of course. <br><br>Lastly, I don&#39;t think he even knew that Fearn and Omicron have the Human Factor in them. He did hear of it but thought it was just a rumour. I will talk to him later today and try to drive this point home.<br><br><br><br>If you&#39;d like to discuss this in person, feel free to drop by our quarters anytime. Just ask for me at the DIA&#39;s reception desk and I&#39;ll go and meet you there to clear you through.<br><br>Thank you for your time,<br><br>Naya&#39;Keegan vas Iktomi</p>

I&#39;m pretty sure the Notary&#39;s putting together a piece of paper that says it&#39;s too undignified for the Continuity Council &amp;c to be abbreviated, and she&#39;s looking smug enough that I--okay, we, we&#39;re pretty sure she may have found a way--okay, it&#39;s not me, it&#39;s Fish, but he seems pretty sure that she&#39;s probably found a way to get the motion passed before we realize what it is. Only I guess that&#39;s failing now. Hm.<br><br>Still. Deciding on an acronym sounds like a good idea. What about CounCon? Since ConCoun sounds silly?<br><br>(Mind you, that&#39;s fairly reminiscent of Cancun. Maybe not. ContCouncil?)<br><br>...seconding the important note, too. Leave TARDISes where you found them, and do not recruit Time Lords unless absolutely necessary. I&#39;ve got enough to deal with; we all do (well, most of us...)<br><br>-R</p>

            <p>I am currently working on a rewrite of the first few chapters of my Bakugan/Pokémon crossover fic <i>The Vexos Chronicles</i>. However, one of my betas, PoorCynic, has recently told me that he would not be able to continue as a beta due to Real Life and other issues. As eatpraylove (my other beta) and I ofttimes need the input of a third person at certain impasses, I am now looking for a new person to join our team and help with both this rewrite and beyond. If you are good at resolving issues of narrative pacing (i.e., whether a story is lagging or going too fast) and are willing to learn a new canon, please reply or <a href="mailto:sonofheaven176@gmail.com">e-mail me</a>.<br><br>Given that the Bakugan fandom does not seem to be that big, I will not be requiring that you be a fan of it (though being a Bakugan fan would definitely be a big plus). However, I <i>do</i> ask that you be willing to learn. As eatpraylove can attest, you will not need to come in with extensive canon knowledge, and I&#39;ll try to point you to any relevant background information that you might need.<br><br>However, knowledge of Pokémon (up to at least Generation IV (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum)) is required: animeverse preferred, but gamesverse will work as well.<br><br>And as aforesaid, I’ll need someone who can help with pacing problems.<br><br>Interested? Please reply or email me.<br><br>And if you happen to know someone outside of the Board who may be able to help, please feel free to send him or her my way.<br><br>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m thinking of continuing her responses to Sue ordeals every time I unwisely overexpose myself to the Circle too long. <br><br>Originally it was going to fall under the premise that Legolas was getting too many love letters from all the Legolusting Sues out there, and thus had roped one of the servants into writing responses to his fanmail, and said servant started getting annoyed at the Sues after the tenth one or so and started acting snarky to them.

            <p>I quite enjoyed that!  It&#39;s a very different sort of sporking, and I like how it turned out.<br><br>All the links within the narrative are especially nice for those of us, like me, who can&#39;t hold all the Tolkien knowledge together in our brains.  I also very much appreciated the link to Lamarckian &quot;genetics&quot; in the first response.  Guess that author didn&#39;t hit high school bio yet. :|<br><br>I think what I like best about this approach is that it really is explicitly educational.  If the original authors encounter this, they will actually be pointed towards the references they need to improve.  It makes this story a bit more high class and constructive than the average spork.</p>

Where&#39;d you get that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;  Doc glanced towards the glow of their mini-Hound of the Baskervilles, which was gnawing on a long, greenish fish.  &quot;Oh.  No, I didn&#39;t notice he had that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah.  &#39;Cause he&#39;s getting fish blood all over the carpet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sorry, Vania.  I really don&#39;t know where he got that!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eh, that&#39;s all right.  It&#39;s been a while since a capillary towel had a cameo, anyway.  We&#39;ll get one when we get back.&quot;<br><br>* * *
<br>Doc and Vania tracked two characters down a hallway in Hogwarts, followed by a mini-Aragog that had been created.<br><br>&quot;A <i>Leanne</i> luster!&quot; whispered Vania.  &quot;Got to give points for writing something original.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s not call it &#39;lust&#39; for underage schoolgirls,&quot; Doc muttered, writing down charges.<br><br>&quot;Still, though, most people don&#39;t even know her name!  She&#39;s just &#39;that-girl-who-was-walking-next-to-Katie-when-she-got-cursed.&#39;  Whoa!  Ouch.&quot;<br><br>Leanne had just been smacked in the face with a fish.<br><br>&quot;I wasn&#39;t watching the Words.  What caused that, Doc?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t catch it.  let me read it over again.&quot;<br><br>While he was doing so, Vania continued watching the students and frowned.  Leanne was rubbing her nose, and the Sue had grasped her by the shoulders and was checking her face for injuries.  &quot;Weird.  Sues don&#39;t usually notice when their typos make stuff like that happen.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not seeing whe—AUGH!&quot;  Doc jumped and flinched as a cold, wet somethingflopped against the side of his neck.<br><br>Vania bent down and picked up the flopping fish.  &quot;It&#39;s a salmon . . .&quot; she shrugged.<br><br>The Sue called out in her off-timber voice.  &quot;What are you doing there?  Spying on us?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great.  Stupid fish.&quot;  Doc turned back to the first page of charges.  &quot;Carline Amanda Roberts, you are charged with—Ah, gosh darn it!&quot; he yelled as a wet fish slapped the papers out of his hand and stuck them together.  The mini-Aragog seized it and sunk its mandibles into the fish&#39;s side.<br><br>Vania smirked.  &quot;&#39;Gosh darn it?&#39;  Really?&quot;<br><br>The hallway began to fill with the sound of splatters as fish began to pelt the bricks from . . . no clear source.<br><br>&quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; Doc asked the Sue.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t look at me!  My story did NOT include FISH RAIN.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Come on!&quot; Leanne shouted over the splats.  &quot;The Room of Requirement!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you shouldn&#39;t know about that until sixth year!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bugger off!  I&#39;m finally the main character in a fanfiction, and I&#39;m milking it for all it&#39;s worth!&quot;<br><br>* * *
<br>As the four human characters had mutually needed a room with no fish as they approached the door to the Room of Requirement, that is exactly where they found themselves.  (The mini-Aragog hadn&#39;t finished draining its fish dry yet, or it might have caused a problem.)<br><br>Yes, they found themselves in a tiny room with no fish.  For about two seconds, before the salmon onslaught began again.<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re coming from everywhere and nowhere!&quot; Carline whined, as the spider scaled the wall behind her.  Leanne was deflecting as many as she could with her wand; the agents&#39; wands were, as predicted, useless.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re a Sue!  Do with the plotholes or something!&quot; Vania demanded.<br><br>&quot;Huh?  Oh, right!&quot;  Carline waved her arms and fingers in a swooshy motion.  Some of the salmon began to disappear before they hit anyone.  &quot;Nice!&quot; cried Carline.<br><br>But then, the salmon began bouncing between the shimmers in the air, ultimately making the small space even more filled with fish than before.<br><br>&quot;Making it worse!&quot; Doc warned.<br><br>&quot;Ugh!  Whatever.&quot;  Carline threw up her hands, and the plotholes vanished.  Some of the fish were tossed up into the air and landed in a web the mini-Aragog had spun.<br><br>&quot;Yesssss, Precioussssss,&quot; the spider hissed as it closed its appendages around the flopping animal.  &quot;Tasssssty fishesssss!&quot;<br><br>The PPC agents looked at each other.  Doc turned to Carline.  &quot;For the first time in history, the PPC is requesting for you to make more typos.&quot;<br><br>Carline quirked her head.  &quot;Typos?&quot;  She glanced at her erstwhile girlfriend.  &quot;Like, Leann?&quot;<br><br>A new mini-Aragog appeared, and immediately started to crawl up to its comrade&#39;s web.<br><br>&quot;Whoa,&quot; said Carline.  &quot;I didn&#39;t know I could do that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;More!  Hurry!&quot; Leanne called.  &quot;We&#39;re up to our ankles in fish!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And up to our noses and fish smell,&quot; Doc added.<br><br>&quot;Uh.  Dumbledoor?  Minstery of Magic . . . Avada Cadaver!&quot;<br><br>All the miniature Acromantulas set to work strining the room with webbing.  But it could only last for so long; soon, the spiders&#39; webs began to bulge with weight, their bellies began to fill, the humans found the salmon reaching above their wastes.  Leanne was trying to reach the door, trying to blast through the thickness of the fish pile with her wand in order to walk.<br><br>&quot;We have to portal back to HQ!&quot; Vania said.<br><br>&quot;It won&#39;t work,&quot; said Doc, shaking his head.  &quot;This is probably where the mini-Hound&#39;s fish came from.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh,&quot; Vania said quietly.  She had finally managed to get the RA from her pocket above the line of sea life.  &quot;It&#39;s totally fried by all the dampness, anyway.&quot;<br><br>Suddenly, a blue doorway opened into the room.  Fish began to spill out through the new entrance.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re saved!&quot; Vania cried.  She tried to jump for joy, but failed under the weight of the fish surrounding her legs.  &quot;SpecOps is here!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are not needing Special Operations,&quot; Séverine said, stepping over the fish to show an army of agents bearing the same orange honeycombed fungus flashpatch.  &quot;the Cafeteria is here, and I understand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9qA8c-E_oA">we will all be having seafood this week</a>.&quot;</p>

            <p>Her special emphasis on minor characters caught my eye- I admittedly went &#39;who?&#39; when I saw Leanne&#39;s name because I&#39;ve never seen her in a badfic (or mockup of a badfic) and it didn&#39;t occur to me you actually included such a minor character because they <i>never get used in badfic.</i> I thought the Sue picked the name for a random OC.<br><br>Oh fanfiction, what have you done to my brain?</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t remember her either.  Initially, I was thinking, who doesn&#39;t get to show up much in fics?  How about Ernie Macmillan?  And I went to the Potter Wiki to check my spelling (which had been wrong), but when I got there, in the recent changes list was a page named &quot;Isabella Laughland.&quot;  (Which is a great last name!)  And I went, Oh!  Someone even more obscure!  Except she was an actor, not a character; the actor who played Leanne.  And then I was like, Wait.  Who&#39;s Leanne?  And that&#39;s how I found an even more less well-known character than Ernie.<br><br>Yeah, this probably isn&#39;t nearly as interesting as I thought it was.</p>

            <p>Hey all.<br><br>I&#39;ve got an original world I&#39;ve gone back to trying to develop. A lot of is pretty sketchy and incomplete, though, and while I have the beginnings of some working notes for it, it also needs a lot of work--plot, characters, fleshing out the world, all of it.<br><br>I&#39;ve talked to several of my very close friends about it at length, but I&#39;d like a pair--or multiple pairs--of unspoiled and more objective eyes and thoughts, to tell me where I need to work on more, if I&#39;m being incredibly stupid, what is too heavy-handed or too obscure, etc. I don&#39;t have actual writing to be beta&#39;d yet and won&#39;t for a long time, but doubtless I could use thoughtful eyes on the worldbuilding so I can do it thoroughly and carefully. I&#39;m also looking for someone who can tell me if it&#39;s too derivative; I will note that a lot of this I had thought up long before I read certain other sources of inspiration, and some things will have similarities no matter what I do, but I do very much want that check just as much as general sanity-checks and suggestions on where I need to develop more.<br><br>The world is approximately medium medieval (more or less medieval, anyway) fantasy--medium in that it is not exactly low-key to no magic, but it isn&#39;t setting volcanoes on fire or grand quests or anything--hopefully with a lot of humor (and romance, I&#39;m a sucker) mixed with intrigue, assassinations, and war. I&#39;m definitely looking at varying influences on different areas and would appreciate having some input on how not to end up accidentally stereotyping that. Oh, and bards. Bards are important in this universe.<br><br>Let me know if you&#39;re interested, and a contact email would be nice to have, too, as I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m looking for yet.</p>

            <p>On the phone, still, but super neat to see him! Given that Dawn and I are working on the mission that spurs him and Gurnirel to join SIELU, it&#39;s pretty entertaining. <br><br>Other than that, very nicely done. There was a bit that was confusingly worded: <br><br><i>&quot;Um... that if she had any character at all she&#39;d be a flaming Suvian?&quot;</i><br><br>I think you meant &quot;she wouldn&#39;t be a flaming Suvian&quot;, since Suvians lack character, which Kaitlyn and Selene pointed out later. <br><br>Also there&#39;s the paragraph after &quot;Fire rained down on Dale&quot; which needs capitalisation, and I think you&#39;re also missing a couple dashes between the two paragraphs in general. <br><br>But that&#39;s all that I found weird. I especially liked the constructive criticism at the end; clearly this fic had a lot more potential.  <br><br></p>

            <p>I needed a SIELU agent who wasn&#39;t Ramwe-the-Inscrutible, and remembered Dawn had mentioned having a couple of Caliquendi in there... it took me longer than I expected to track down the names, though (particularly since, er, they were in like the second thread down the Board at the time...)<br><br>The &#39;flaming Suvian&#39; thing - they actually said it right. She has literally <i>no</i> character - no lusting, no hating, no nothing. She&#39;s nothing more than a collection of traits. Without a personality to enable actual canon-warping behaviour, she doesn&#39;t really qualify as a Suvian in my view. Seriously - everyone <i>ignored</i> her most of the time. It&#39;s really weird.<br><br>The thing with that &#39;the scene changed&#39; double paragraph is intentional; it&#39;s an abrupt scene changed marked by a broken paragraph. That said, since two people have now flagged it up, I guess I&#39;ll add some sort of divider between them.<br><br>Thanks for the review!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Just one random paragraph break spotted: <br><br><i>Fire rained down on Dale. The building in front of Kaitlyn crashed down, and she yelped, throwing herself back. A spark caught in her beard, spreading rapidly, and she beat at it frantically before<br><br>the scene changed, and they were suddenly in the darkness of Bag End, watching Evelynn wake with a start. The fire was gone, but Kaitlyn still ran her fingers through her beard mournfully. &quot;It&#39;s never going to be the same again,&quot; she said.</i><br><br>Anyway, I enjoyed this just as much as the others, if not more. This new mission format was interesting, and I was cracking up by the end when poor Kaitlyn was speaking in voices like overly-urple similes. <br><br>And the Andalite/Animorph mixup reminded me do much of my mom. She could never keep the two straight despite constant &#39;Animorph are animal morphers&#39; reminders from me.
