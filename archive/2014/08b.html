            <p>Congratulations! You made it to the teens. You are entering a very important stage of your life, and that needs to be celebrated! Indeed, this needs to be celebrated in the largest, most special way possible. You know what that means! Yes! It&#39;s time for another FANON PINKIE PIE PARTY!<br><br>What is a Fanon Pinkie Pie Party you may ask? What makes it any different from a regular Pinkie Pie Party? Well, I&#39;ll tell you!<br><br>As you probably know, the My Little Pony brand is made primarily for little girls. Unfortunately, this means Hasbro forces canon to restrain Pinkie&#39;s parties to those for a five year old little girl. While this is all well and good for said five year olds, those much older then that can only find so much enjoyment from them that is not based on nostalgia. <br><br>Enter the Fanon Package, where we use a dash of Fanon and a drop of OOC to break the shackles enforced by corporate onto our favorite Party Pony. Now she can be the Super Duper Party Pony she was meant to be, and throw you the BEST PARTY EVER! Music, lights, snacks, party games, and quite simply the most delicious cake you will ever taste!<br><br>BUT WAIT, there&#39;s more! Pinkie Pie uses a mixture of her fourth-wall breaking abilities and a Remote Activator we managed to acquire to bring in ANY CANONS YOU WANT! Just choose you location, provide a list of your favorite fandoms, and we provide the rest! Dance with the Doctor, shoot pinatas with Katniss Everdeen, even get to glomp without consequence!<br><br>By the end of the party, specially programed robots with Neuralyzers will sort out all of the canon mess left behind, so don&#39;t worry your little head over any damage to the continua. They will even neuralyze you, making the party seem like it never happened and that all you were doing was reading about this fantastic party! The robots even have time travel abilities, due to being based off of the T-1000, so you won&#39;t even notice the time difference! This is quite simply the best party you will never remember!<br><br>(The next time you have a special event to celebrate, just remember: There Ain&#39;t No Party Like a Pinkie Pie Party!)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know, the guy looks kinda angry. Was it not satisfactory? Did Pinkie mix up the cake batter and confetti again? Or, was it so amazing, you are screaming in joy? We at Pinkie Pie Parties... are confused. However, like the Party Pony herself, we will stay positive! So, we are glad your party was so amazing, it left you speechless!<br><br>((Heh, the Fanon Pinkie Pie Party is kinda my thing. I give it out to people on their birthdays. Takes forever to type it out though! Even when I started copy-pasting chunks, I still spent around two hours tweaking it. Still, it makes people happy. I think...))<br><br>((Say, do any of you think I should write some stories about Pinkie Pie Parties inc. ? You know, the Behind the Scenes and stuff? I have a few ideas for a couple of short stories, but I don&#39;t know if there is any interest.))</p>

            <p>The first night none of us could get to sleep... So, we saw the stars at midnight, which were, to say the least, AMAZING. We also hiked the SCARIEST. HIKE. EVER. over a ravine, which was very rewarding at the end. A lot of us climbed the small waterfalls. Also, most of us went down a rapid in the water with our life jackets on- it was like a roller coaster that stuffed some water up your nose haha. Also, somehow, I got used to hundred-degree weather and still swam in the (freezing) water of the Colorado River. On the first night, we found a rattlesnake near the toilet, and a few nights later we saw scorpions, a gopher snake, and I patted a fish! <br>Very rewarding experience. (Go with Grand Canyon Expeditions if you want to go! :D Delicious food.)</p>

            <p>I know those two comics are widely considered not only good, but of consistently high quality and I also believe that they are well-known fanfics. So I thought they should be nominated as legendary goodfics. Are there any who want to second the nomination?<br>(And I apologize if I&#39;m going at this the wrong way, but the wiki simply says that nominations should be made on the Board by two, preferably three Boarders.)<br><br>Links here:<br><a href="http://pika-la-cynique.deviantart.com/gallery/772068/Girls-Next-Door"><a href="http://pika-la-cynique.deviantart.com/gallery/772068/Girls-Next-Door">http://pika-la-cynique.deviantart.com/gallery/772068/Girls-Next-Door</a></a><br><br><a href="http://asherhyder.deviantart.com/art/Roommates-Collection-1-457034995"><a href="http://asherhyder.deviantart.com/art/Roommates-Collection-1-457034995">http://asherhyder.deviantart.com/art/Roommates-Collection-1-457034995</a></a> (Download link is a pdf file with the first five years of the comic.)</p>

            <p>On the one hand, I really love both these comics; GND is hilarious and <a href="http://pika-la-cynique.deviantart.com/art/GND234-Stroke-of-Midnight-424292903">really pretty</a>, and does an excellent job of making the characters believably themselves. The art in Rm doesn&#39;t grab me as much (though the text is easier to read - that&#39;s my one complaint against GND!Jareth), and isn&#39;t as big on the humour, but the storylines and dramatic moments <a href="http://asherhyder.deviantart.com/art/Roommates-291-Skeptic-342151905">blow me away</a> (though that one doesn&#39;t really have its impact without the background, and is a massive spoiler - don&#39;t click unless you&#39;ve read it!).<br><br>But... legendary? I hadn&#39;t heard of them until I stumbled across GND by accident (which, by the way, is probably why I prefer it - I read it first). That may be because I&#39;m not in the relevant fandoms, but to my mind, a Legendary Bad/Goodfic should be known by everyone in the fandom. The entire LotR fandom knew (at one point) what &#39;legolas by laura&#39; and &#39;C<em>l</em>br__n&#39; were; do these meet the same standard?<br><br>Or maybe I&#39;m just being old-fashioned and over-thingy. I&#39;d agree that they&#39;re <i>good enough</i> certainly; I&#39;m just asking about &#39;well-known&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... we need some sort of agreed upon definition of what constitutes legendary.<br><br>The wiki page isn&#39;t being very helpful on the subject. All the fics on it were added back in 2008, most of them by the same editor. There&#39;s nothing about which criteria were used, except that they have to be nominated on the Board. (Digging through the Board archives for the nomination threads might give some more information.)<br><br>On the wikipage for Goodfic, it merely states that &#39;Certain goodfics that are very popular among the PPC are elevated to the status of Legendary Goodfic.&#39; and doesn&#39;t even mention the actual fandoms involved.<br><br>Likewise, on the Legendary Badfic page it also says &#39;The Legendary Badfic is a collective name for the worst badfic encountered by the PPC, specifically those &#39;fics which most of the community have heard of and (in many cases) been traumatized by.&#39; Again, it mentions the PPC, not the fandoms.<br><br>I think it&#39;s safe to say that the definition of &#39;Legendary&#39; used to be looser and more based on what was well known in the PPC community, rather than in the fandoms in question. As such, both pages may need a clean-up, if we come up with a new, stricter definition.<br><br>Also, should we compare goodfics with badfics, when deciding what &#39;well known&#39; means?<br>It strikes me as a bit unfair to the goodfics. Even people who never read fanfics might read &#39;legolas by Laura&#39; or &#39;My Immortal&#39; (which are both very short) simply to gawk at the horribleness in them and then spread the word, thus making them infamous in all the fandom. Goodfics, on the other hand, are mostly known among people who want to read fanfics and can have a much harder time catching the eye of the whole fandom. Especially considering that most people don&#39;t recommend fics that they haven&#39;t read themselves and something like OFUM or &#39;Don&#39;t Panic&#39; are long and take a while to get through.</p>

            <p>Definitely for <i>Girls Next Door</i>, at any rate. (Hands up if you knew that Pika is also the artist responsible for drawing many of OFUM&#39;s Black Leather Alliance back in the day!)<br><br>I haven&#39;t been enjoying <i>Roommates</i> as much in recent arcs, unfortunately. I kinda feel like it&#39;s gotten so wrapped up in its own mythology and drama that the characters&#39; distinct personalities and the sense of fun have been lost. I miss the wacky hijinks, which GND still brings in full force.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s possible to have one without the other, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>In my opinion, it should be possible to have just the one, if it comes to that. That GND is technically a fanfic of Roommates does not make it any less of a fanfic. I&#39;d rather see just GND on the legendary list, than not have any of them.</p>

            <p>It is good to finally see Jenna brought to justice finally. I may be slightly biased about anything that puts Jenna in her place though. Although that does remind me that under PPC standards the fic is still out there waiting to be killed. <br><br>Since it is semi-related to this would it be at all possible that I claim My Inner Life for a possible ( yet long into the future) mission? I must admit that it would be quite interesting if I was the one to finally end Jenna Silverblade for the PPC considering it was me lurking around the Tv Tropes page for the fic that lead me here.</p>

            <p>There don&#39;t seem to be many DIA agents named, much less available for use.  Considering the diffuse mayhem I&#39;m trying to write, it would be helpful to have a handful.  Here&#39;s some of my loose ideas, but I&#39;d love more.<br><br>I&#39;m vaguely cooking one who was born in The Last Airbender.  A young earthbender who wanted to join the Dai Li isn&#39;t quite up to standards.  He falls through a plothole to PPC, learns about the show, and hopes that the PPC is less corrupt.  He takes time off in the Legend of Korra universe to learn the techniques of the metalbending police.<br><br>I have an idea that one is either a tauren from WoW or a generic minotaur.<br><br>I looked at the Judoon and Sontarans from Doctor Who, but frankly anyone from either of those races would need a handler.  Though it would be funny to have an aggressive potato alien named Stove overreacting to a minor offense.<br><br>I&#39;m also looking for a good species to be a &quot;for your own good&quot; muscular Nurse.  Basically she looks like she would be sadistic, and can quite easily deliver a shot while holding someone down, but is quite gentle when someone has the sense to cooperate.</p>

            <p>If you focused on reading stories to learn PPC basics like what World One is and how CADs work, and fleshing out your main characters by means <i>other</i> than writing PPC stuff (which, I remind you, you should not be doing), you might be able to get Permission. Then people might be willing to loan you their characters if you asked, and you could invent new NPCs without having to ask about every single one.<br><br>Like Dann said <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=262266;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">below</a>, I am getting increasingly uncomfortable with you talking about all the things you&#39;re writing without Permission. We can&#39;t stop you from doing it, and as long as it never sees the light of day before you get Permission we don&#39;t actually care much; that said, would you please keep it to yourself? If you really can&#39;t operate without feedback, it would be more appropriate to discuss your ideas with a few friends or willing acquaintances privately, not in front of your entire prospective audience.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Ah, first time I saw Dann&#39;s post.  As for getting to know them without writing missions and interludes, the only one who exists outside is Samantha unless I actually write the badfic that Hue comes from, and I&#39;m not sure I can pull off six-year old writing style.  And Samantha is a different person when her environment changes, everyone would be as well.<br><br>And really, I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m supposed to do since my primary team really isn&#39;t permission material and my secondary team isn&#39;t acceptable.  Criticize me for asking before ready, then criticize for needing to work this way.  Make up your mind.<br><br>As far as I can tell, there is maybe one or two fleshed-out DIA agents.  There might be enough nurses.<br><br>As far as my questions, the answers aren&#39;t readily available.  I&#39;ve read a lot of spinoffs, and I&#39;m guessing the amount is about 80 over the summer since I kept running into repeats.<br><br>On a somewhat related note, it took me two months of heavily browsing the wiki to learn about semi-blip fic.  Can there be a complete list of where agents come from either on the recruit page or its own page?<br><br>CADs squeal, they blow up, they give error messages, they shut down if they detect legendary badfic, sometimes they work properly... I don&#39;t remember what happened the one time it was pointed at an agent.  I did find one recruitment story about a human, and both the major doctors in Medical and Pyschfic omnisciently knew what continuum he was from.  Another random portal-refugee was instantly recognizable as a pony.<br><br>People have explained how World One works, but not how agents perceive it.  Without methodically going through every fic I can find, even the outright dull ones, I have to guess that the only time I&#39;ve seen home-continua mentioned is when someone is outright shocked by someone&#39;s appearance.<br><br></p>

            <p><i>Samantha is a different person when her environment changes, everyone would be as well.</i><br><br>But some things will be the same. Playing with what changes based on environment and what doesn&#39;t can help you narrow down the essential qualities of the character. My character Jenni, for instance, has been in about a zillion RPs. She&#39;s been an anthropomorphic fox, a wizard, a harper, a wandering healer, a psychic, and a shrink—but she always wants to help people. That&#39;s what&#39;s most important about her and most defines her as a character. The rest is about as important to who she is as what clothes you choose to wear each day is important to who you are.<br><br><i>my primary team really isn&#39;t permission material and my secondary team isn&#39;t acceptable</i><br><br>Preventing unacceptable characters from being written is, uh, sort of why we have the Permission process. If the ones you&#39;ve got won&#39;t work and you can&#39;t fix them, the thing to do is chuck &#39;em and start over, not go ahead and write them anyway.<br><br><i>Criticize me for asking before ready, then criticize for needing to work this way.</i><br><br>I&#39;m actually criticizing you for <i>publicly</i> working this way, since I don&#39;t actually have the power to reach through the computer and stop you from doing it privately. You&#39;re visibly flaunting the rules, and it really needs to stop. Plus, like I said, if you absolutely can&#39;t function without feedback, there are ways to get it other than crowdsourceing everything to the Board (which is not generally approved of anyway).<br><br>As far as the questions you&#39;ve mentioned here... have you considered that perhaps you&#39;re getting too wrapped up in the minor details? I have this problem, so I can relate. Sometimes that one little thing you&#39;re worrying over so much doesn&#39;t actually matter, and your story will benefit from letting it go. For instance, who cares which particular version of Earth someone came from or how they figure it out? If what&#39;s important for the story is that they <i>do</i> figure it out and that the character goes home, just say they did. The PPC has technology and other resources from all over the multiverse. It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to just assume this happens give enough time.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I also have a character like Jenni, in that I&#39;ve used him &quot;in about a zillion RPs.&quot; It&#39;s neat to know that other people have characters like that too. And yeah, it does help to figure out what the bare-bones, most central parts of the character are. For example, my character is a rogue who achieves good goals through very bad methods.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll attempt to be an unbiased third party here, and analyze what seems to be going on.<br><br>Zdimensia, you are saying that you want to have practice writing your characters, but are having difficulties doing so in a non-PPC environment because you feel they would be very different characters.*<br><br>Neshomeh, you are suggesting that Zdimensia not ask for feedback on the Board, and also that he try to write his characters outside of the PPC because he does not yet have permission.*<br><br>I believe the confusion is that Zdimensia hears Neshomeh&#39;s request to write non-PPC stories about these characters as a request to write about these characters before they were in the PPC. So far as I can tell, what Neshomeh is saying is that you, Zdimensia, would benefit from taking the characters and putting them both in a different setting, but keeping the core of their characters the same as they will be if/when you write them for the PPC. Hopefully I&#39;ve been at least somewhat helpful.<br><br>*This is my perception of what is going on, so I may be wrong. Feel free to call me on it if I am.</p>

Without the PPC, he pretty much loses his seed, the way that one of his most defining traits presents itself.<br><br>It&#39;s like if John Crichton didn&#39;t fall through the wormhole when he tested his spaceship.

We might get a story where a rich guy pumps a lot of R&amp;D into crimefighting tech for the police, but Bruce Wayne wouldn&#39;t have the same emotional impact.<br><br>Would John Watson be anything if he hadn&#39;t met Sherlock?  Arther Dent is a purposefully dull character who&#39;s just trying to stay sane when his world blows up.<br><br>This is why a lot of High School AU&#39;s are so unremarkable.

            <p>Okay, I don&#39;t know about John Crichton, but Nesh got that covered. But as for the rest...<br><br>Bruce Wayne funding the police. Are you kidding? It could be a superinteresting and suspenseful story about a guy basically owning a bunch of crooked cops and paying them to do the right thing. It could look into how having that kind of power would affect him. How would Bruce Wayne be, if he had decided not to get his own hands dirty, but to let other fight the fight? The possibilities are endless! I&#39;d read the stuffing out off the AU!<br><br>John Watson. If we go by the Sherlock verse, they very specifically make the point that Watson is addicted to danger, even without Sherlock to drag him into it. And even in the original he was a war vet, a doctor and something of a ladies man. Do you really think that a story about Watson if he never meets Sherlock would just be him sitting on his hands doing nothing interesting?<br><br>And Arthur Dent, don&#39;t even get me started on Arthur Dent. Arthur Dent start his story by laying down in front of a bulldozer that is about to demolish his house. Is that your definition of dull? He is the everyman, the sane guy in a crazy world, the one we identify with, but he is not dull. No-one wants to identify with someone dull.<br><br>And no, most highschool AU&#39;s are unremarkable, for the same reason that most fanfics are: They are written by people who have yet to develop the skill and practice to write interesting stories. But look at something like OFUM or HFA. All the canon characters are taken out of their usual settings and made teachers and yet each and everyone of them are completely in character.<br><br>As the great bearded sage, Chuck Wendig says, plot is made of people. You start with interesting characters and let their wants and needs and actions build an interesting story. You don&#39;t start with a uninteresting character and put him in an interesting setting or throw interesting events at him, hoping it will make for a good story. It&#39;s simply a waste of good settings and events. Save them for when you have a character that you don&#39;t yourself describe as dull.</p>

            <p><b>My character Jenni, for instance, has been in about a zillion RPs. She&#39;s been an anthropomorphic fox, a wizard, a harper, a wandering healer, a psychic, and a shrink—but she always wants to help people. That&#39;s what&#39;s most important about her and most defines her as a character. The rest is about as important to who she is as what clothes you choose to wear each day is important to who you are.</b><br><br>Who is Jenni when she&#39;s on a deserted island... Let&#39;s say Lord of the Flies a couple of years before the boys get there?  How does she help people then?<br><br>Outside of the PPC, Larry&#39;s being pathetic at growing up is hard to express.  <br><br>Basically I had a story about a guy who works in a shipping warehouse, rides a skateboard to and from the bus-stop, and lives in a sparsely-furnished studio apartment.  He trades sandwiches for discs of pirated content and feels somewhat guilty, but that&#39;s the only way he can afford to fulfill his love of cartoons and anime.  Having him go to a brony&#39;s home to watch MLP and deciding he doesn&#39;t like it wasn&#39;t interesting even with a dropped hint that they&#39;re disguised humans in the Skin Deep universe.</p>

            <p>This is pretty much how I work.  Before I create the file, I let them play the situation.  During the course of typing it out, I&#39;m more in-tune with what they would do and directing them toward the outcome.  Sometimes I have to throw away a 200-word conversation and say, &quot;try again, but this time talk about this.&quot;  It&#39;s like running a simulation and changing variables sometimes.<br><br>Like, there are things about Kim that I can&#39;t figure out how to describe well.  I&#39;m not sure if she hates her job or just likes to complain.  The best I can do is say that the parts I took from Roz really come through at times.<br><br>For Hue, it&#39;s really tough to write him in some situations.  I wanted them to watch at least half of a torture scene, but he leaped in so early that the charge might not stick.</p>

            <p>I was thinking of having Kim do at lot of LOTF fanfiction since the required reading should generate so much badfic.

            <p>My major projects are stalled at the moment, and since I want to show at least <i>some</i> sample of my non-PPC writing before I make the Request some months from now, I've considered writing some sort of sequel or companion to <a href="http://admiralsakai.deviantart.com/art/Mixed-Signals-A-District-9-Fanfic-408939047">Mixed Signals</a>\*. I'm not sure if I want to fully go through with that, and if I do I'm unsure whether to do another "webpage" visual thingy or a straight-up narrative- if the latter, I'm assuming that it would involve the scientist from MS (Dr. Cook is his name) having to physically travel to D10 (either for research or to try to rescue the "Signals_89" user from the site) and getting caught up in the expected chaos once there. I'm giving it the working title "Fieldwork".</p>

<p><br><br><p>Thoughts? Concrit? Suggestions?</p>
<br><br><p>*On that note, I&#39;m looking for places that will better hold Mixed Signals than my DA scraps page, which gets exceedingly little traffic. It&#39;s a partially graphical work, so I can&#39;t just put it on FF.net.</p></p>

            <p>Posting in the newest newbie&#39;s welcome thread made me wonder, and I checked the wiki. It seems that we don&#39;t have a page about newbie gifts, just one about bumper stickers (which seem to have fallen out of fashion, TBH). <br>Would is be OK to create a page for newbie gifts, or perchance modify the bumper sticker one extensively and rename it?</p>

The main Sue is a replacement according to my read-throughs  of it, and I was thinking of showing how the Sue shoves Cheerilee into a plothole and takes her identity.

            <p>I&#39;m not sure about the RC number, since letters aren&#39;t used except for mathematical signifiers like <i>i</i> and <i>e</i>.

I hope you find another way to do it, when you get Permission.<br><br>BTW, I think zdimensia might&#39;ve been referring to one of my missions below: <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/01ft.html">&quot;Family Ties&quot;</a> actually features Severus Snape and Snape&#39;s niece (confusingly referred to as his daughter in the fic&#39;s summary), not Dumbledore&#39;s daughter, but it does feature a scene where canon!Snape walks into a potions supply closet and doppelgänger!Snape walks out.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

They all had to equate to numbers, so RC #Molybdenum was filed under 95.94, the atomic mass of Mo.<br><br>In this case, of course, DD13 <i>does</i> translate to a number - it&#39;s either 13-13-13 (which I think is the intent), or 56595 if read as a single hex number. So it shouldn&#39;t be a problem. (In in-universe terms, I&#39;ve always imagined that RCs have a real, decimal number, which agents freely reinterpret for the sign on their doors. So #Molybdenum would be simply RC 95, and DD13 would be 56595, which the agents realised just happened to be readable as a hex number D-D-13. But that&#39;s just my interpretation)<br><br>And, uh, don&#39;t make it 13DD. That&#39;s clearly a Mary-Sue&#39;s bra size.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Any sequence of letters (and some other symbols besides) can be converted into numbers though ASCII or Unicode encoding. It gets weird when you realize that the ASCII encoding of digits themselves are <i>not</i> the same as the numbers. &#39;0&#39; is 48, &#39;1&#39; is 49, etc.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not tied to any particular continuum other than C&amp;H, which has very little impact on the PPC otherwise, and should be playable by a wide range of species, etc.<br><br>On the subject of it being too &quot;out there&quot;, if you look at how Calvinball is played in the comics, while the rules are fluid they are all still recognizable as reasonable game rules in any specific given configuration, they don&#39;t just include random objects and ideas.

            <p>Kagamine Len or Silver, I can&#39;t remember which. Len because the first video of his I ever saw (and my first Vocaloid song ever) was &quot;Monochrome Dream-Eater&quot;, which features him in a nice suit and with awesome powers. Also, he happened to look like my real-life crush at the time. I&#39;ve since grown to like/love a whole lot more Vocaloids, but Len and Rin (twin sister) have a special place in my heart.<br><br>I started liking Silver around the time HGSS came out. Of course I remembered him from playing Silver and Crystal as a kid (like, obsessively), but his sprites looked dumb even then. (Also, like everyone else, I named him &quot;???&quot; every single time.) But in HGSS, he looks much nicer, almost like your standard Bishonen (literally &quot;beautiful boy&quot;). I feel like he got a little more personality in the remake, too, but that might just be the character development I never saw as a kid because Karen was evil.</p>

            <p>In my case, it only sounds strange when I describe it.  I once combined an AU with a... don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called.  Basically when you take the dialogue and fill in thoughts and motivations.  <br><br>I&#39;d be hard-pressed to choose what actually turned out the strangest because I liked to take stupid-sounding ideas and actually try to make them work.

            <p>Which was a Redwall fanfiction featuring time travel, which was basically a big complicated way to get Rose alive again. It didn&#39;t make much sense, though it was written well enough. The few excerpts I had of the sequel to it, though... now that was weird. The time travel stopped making much sense even to me, paradox clones happened, &quot;paradox bubbles&quot; occurred, and I never did manage to get the bad guys out of the way, because every time I inserted another time loop to get them out of a fix, by my own time travel logic we ended up with more clones of them. Eventually I gave up, and it was probably for the best. But it was <i>fun</i>.</p>

            <p>You keep saying that you&#39;re writing missions without permission, and keep asking questions about what happens when X happens that are easily findable on the wiki.<br><br>I&#39;m a lot like you. I&#39;m impatient, and I keep having to tell myself to wait for permission before writing missions. I missed my chance to write three of the missions I most wanted to write.<br><br>I actually, at first, wanted to make my own organization to protect canon from badfic, which I mostly blamed on creatures called &quot;glitches&quot;. I didn&#39;t even know it was badfic, really, I just wanted to write alternate endings of these grimdark, way-out-of-character fics that explained why the characters were acting that way (they were replaced or controlled), as well as put an end to it. The problem was, I was stuck trying to figure out the setting, the technology, et cetera. Then I found the PPC when reading the TV Tropes article on Cupcakes, which lead me to its being sporked. I&#39;d have a world, technology, a more laid-out reason to fight- er, spork- the fics I wanted to target - but I&#39;d miss out on Cupcakes and Rainbow Factory, two of the fics I&#39;d most wanted to spork. Fair enough, I thought, I&#39;d get Cheerilee&#39;s Garden, and there&#39;s still others after that...<br><br>Then I found out that I was expected to get permission first, and I&#39;d have to do this and that to get it. While I was doing that, I ended up disappearing for a year- and Cheerilee&#39;s Garden is claimed now, by someone else. I missed my chance on sporking yet another fic I hated.<br><br>So you can hopefully see why your writing missions without permission ticks me off so much. If I did it, I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about what&#39;s claimed and what&#39;s not, I&#39;d go ahead and spork those three, and I&#39;d do it now, instead of waiting for even longer. But I don&#39;t, because this isn&#39;t my world I&#39;m messing with.<br><br>It&#39;s the world of Jay and Acacia, not of Cheesy and Haze.<br><br>What we write are fanfics. Without permission, it&#39;s that much easier for our own missions to <i>be</i> the badfics we&#39;re trying to fight.<br><br>And if that happens, we&#39;re hypocrites.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a matter of being able to find it.  Like today I learned that there&#39;s actually a storage room where agents throw furniture that they don&#39;t want anymore, but I wouldn&#39;t be able to find the fic again.  Same for the one where an agent gives Sherlock a bleeperin.  And I took five minutes trying to find that one where the agent complains about the exorcism before giving up.  Nesh was probably able to find it quickly because she remembered which agents it actually happened to.<br><br>Nesh actually fixed it by saying not to worry about the contradictions.  I was checking because I didn&#39;t want another &quot;self-inserts aren&#39;t sent to Legal&quot; incident.<br><br>Sitting and not writing missions causes actual pain and a clogged mind.  Plus it looks like permission will be almost impossible because I can&#39;t use my secondary team and the primary team aren&#39;t really that suitable for prompts.<br><br>Yeah, if someone claims the fics I&#39;m working on, it would have to go in the out-of-continuity section, and there&#39;s already one fiction that&#39;s been PPC&#39;d twice.</p>

            <p>Of course I didn&#39;t <span style="color:#01DF01">&gt;imply</span> that. I just wasn&#39;t sure what race she was being racist against, and I thought that &quot;oddly colored&quot; would fit regardless of what race she targeted and what race she was (because in my eyes, it merely meant a race that wasn&#39;t her own)<br><br>And of course hate is never acceptable. I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re hating- be it race, gender, gender preference, or Arceus forbid, religion. That also goes torwards hate that&#39;s &quot;bounced back&quot;- for example, the &quot;SJW&quot; anti-white, anti-male, anti-gay, and anti-cis [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] from Tumblr. (Please, Celestia, tell me they haven&#39;t tried anti-Christian yet. I may be Wiccan, and I may not like how pushy they can be, but they don&#39;t deserve it any more than non-Christians do.) I was just referring to the fact that hate runs rampant on those two sites.<br><br>...<br><br>Also, I [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] love the simple &quot;[EXPLETIVE REDACTED]&quot; from the SCP Foundation canon(s?). It&#39;s easy to use, and you don&#39;t have to mentally go through tons of different replacements for swear words to find one that fits in the situation- just [DATA EXPUNGED].</p>

            <p>No, not forever. In fact, I sometimes debate with myself on reviving Shocker, the DAVD agent I originally was going to use. But if you do your permission request with this &quot;secondary&quot; team, people will expect at least the first few missions you write to be about them.</p>

            <p>Sitting and not writing missions isn&#39;t a problem, and won&#39;t cause &quot;actual pain&quot; and a &quot;clogged mind&quot;. What you SHOULD be working on is a primary team that IS suitable for prompts and is useable. If your team isn&#39;t suitable, scrap it or fix it, don&#39;t just leave it to the side. After that, you work on your prompts, then submit for permission. Once you have that, you can write missions. See?

My point was the fact that I missed my opporitunity to spork a fic that I really wanted to personally spork, due to having to get permission first, and you&#39;re sitting there, writing missions without permission that we can&#39;t even see.

What you&#39;re primarily succeeding at with these threads is making people wonder if you should be given permission when you do ask- not due to writing skills, but if you understand the PPC as a universe and also as a community.<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m not ignoring the points.  I&#39;m ignoring people who are lying about how easy the information is to find.  A lot of what I do know was randomly found, like where the other horses in the courtyard came from.  (Some LOTR fic, dare you to find which one.)  <br><br>And the lack of license is a technicality.  My first permission giver denied it because their computer displayed an error in one of my files when mine didn&#39;t, but the biggest thing is they thought I wouldn&#39;t do anything with the permission if I had it.<br><br>I was asking questions because people keep jumping down my throat about something they don&#39;t expect, like sending self-inserts to Legal.</p>

            <p>Dimensia, you really need to think about what you&#39;re doing here. As other people told you before, the PPC is a community first and foremost; there are people here that haven&#39;t written a mission in quite a bit of time, or haven&#39;t done so at all, yet still hang around because there are people they like here, or they share various interests with. Aggravating three of the old, respected members of the community is a sure-fire way to get other people annoyed as well, especially since they have valid points.<br>Also, since you&#39;re looking for obscure pieces of information, your best chance is to look for it yourself; while it isn&#39;t easy, it&#39;s certainly possible and undoubtedly has other benefits (FYI, searching computer databases for particular data is a useful skill).<br>July... may I respectfully suggest toning down a bit? While you raise valid points, they could be communicated in a less... aggressive way.</p>

            <p>I have a particular response going in my mind; trying really hard to wait until morning.  I apologize in advance for just having a weak bladder about it.<br><br>I&#39;ve also got stories that brew in times like this.  If I ever write them down, I&#39;d submit them as badfic and laugh harder if people refused to touch it.  <br><br>One of them is a fixfic to &quot;Testing Testing 1, 2, 3&quot; where Rainbow Dash learns that there is only &quot;one true way&quot; to study during Wonderbolt Reserves training and her own method &quot;doesn&#39;t fly&quot; so to speak.  (In response to people who think that working on more than one thing at a time is wrong.)  Other times I think about using watercolors and cooking as parables.  (Yes, when I cook, sometimes I divide my time between preparing several different dishes.)  <br><br>Most of the others involve epileptics that are accused of &quot;flailing around for attention,&quot; paraplegics that are ostracized for drooling instead of for being in a wheelchair, and Alzheimer&#39;s patients being yelled at for calling the granddaughter by the daughter&#39;s names.  <br><br>I think I&#39;m going to try to add &quot;Aiwei being a jerk on his job for jollies&quot; fics to that list.  Hmm, I could also do a story about a gluten-intolerant person after eating in a restaurant that emulates Damian Cardone.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Neither I nor Sarge are children, and I used &#39;non sequitur&#39; exactly as it is used - which is Latin for &#39;does not follow&#39; - because your response, you&#39;ve guessed it, does not follow from the rest of the thread. In fact, while you haven&#39;t insulted me before, you&#39;ve certainly done so now because you keep assuming bad faith. <br>I usually try to attribute misunderstandings to communication problems, but in this case it&#39;s either that you cannot understand or aren&#39;t willing.

            <p>No, &quot;non-sequitur&quot; is not &quot;youthful slang-speech&quot; for insult. (And I, for one, am not exactly pleased with the condescension to the perceived youth of the people you&#39;re talking to. You have no idea how old Des, or Sergio, or any of us are, and in this space, the oldest of us, some of whom have multiple offspring, are not more or less important or valued than the youngest of us.) <br><br>It means to us exactly what it has always meant, which is, from the Latin, a statement that does not follow the thread of conversation. You do this pretty often, and have done it here. Let me explain:<br><br>Desdendelle and Sergio Turbo responded to a thread that they perceptively saw as getting heated by telling you that you were beginning to aggravate some folks, and pointing out what July and others have already said - that a lot of the questions you ask in original threads could be answered by doing some research. (Yes, I&#39;m aware it&#39;s not as easy as just typing in search terms and reading - we sort of have a big multiverse, and it will indeed take <i>time</i> to sort through and find things. We all do this; it&#39;s part of being a writer, here as much as anywhere else.)<br><br>You responded to them by saying that you had a particular response, but were going to wait until morning, because of a weak bladder about it(?), and then went off on a tangent about something completely unrelated - other stories you were considering. The post alluded to a potential response without actually giving one, and then went off on a non-sequitur.<br><br>Now, about the thread itself.<br><br><i>And the lack of license is a technicality. My first permission giver denied it because their computer displayed an error in one of my files when mine didn&#39;t, but the biggest thing is they thought I wouldn&#39;t do anything with the permission if I had it.</i><br><br>Specifically, the part where you say: <i>And the lack of license is a technicality.</i><br><br>No. No, it is not. A simple computer error would certainly not be enough to deny permission. There were other points, and other critiques, and other reasons, both on your first <i>and your second</i> request, and it makes me very uncomfortable that you are just sort of brushing those aside.</p>

            <p>If not &quot;youthful slang speech&quot; then &quot;language I&#39;m not educated in.&quot;  I have an anecdote about my boss calling me &quot;the shit&quot; and we&#39;re both lucky that I just moped and pouted for a minute until he realized his mistake instead of what could have happened.  (I was 19 and naive, I don&#39;t know anything about him, so I assume he was superior in meaningful aspects.  I wasn&#39;t racist back then except for some texture aversion involving their hands.)<br><br>I was delaying my response to make sure I really meant it... cold words as opposed to heated rebuttal, if that&#39;s something to compare to iron.  Weak bladder as an allusion to letting it go before it&#39;s ready.<br><br>If &quot;non-sequitur&quot; is not slang for anything other than completely off topic, then the people who fling it at me are using it wrong.<br><br>As for lack of permission, I&#39;m not brushing them aside, but also not embracing their complete wrongness of judgement.

            <p>There&#39;re more than a few issues in your reply to VM alone that really make me quirk an eyebrow.<br><br>First and foremost this item: &quot;I wasn&#39;t racist back then except&quot; This right here? Makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable. If you&#39;re racist? <b>The PPC as a community is not for you, and you should leave.</b> There is no place for anyone who has that kind of hatred behind them here.<br><br>As for &quot;complete wrongness of judgement&quot;, if you believe this, again, you&#39;re more than welcome to leave. Because if you think that Neshomeh, Dann, and everyone else besides who&#39;ve given you advice or suggestions for how to behave on here on the board and what you should be doing with regards to PPC activities and getting permission are wrong in what they&#39;re saying? You don&#39;t belong here. <br><br>Not because you don&#39;t agree- heavens, no one constantly agrees with each other- but because you seem so, so firmly sure that they&#39;re in the wrong and that you therefore can and should act and behave and do as you like here. Permission is an important part of the PPC, as is following the rules here.<br><br>No one is above the rules- except, apparently, you, to the point that you&#39;re willingly ready to lie about circumstances to mark yourself as in the right and as being bullied and attacked by others. No one here is going to accept that.<br></p>

            <p>The point of permission is to judge the applicant&#39;s writing, not their character.  If you can link to any post in one of your permission requests in which a PG, or anyone else, attacked your character, do so.<br><br>Continually calling yourself horrible and blaming that on your lack of permission is only avoiding the actual problem.  Please, do not continue on this note anymore.  Go back to your permission threads, and read the criticisms.  REALLY read them, without coming up with excuses for points you disagree with.  Work on ways to fix your writing, and try again.<br><br>Blowing off constructive criticism is a behavior PPCers have observed in fanfic authors since long before you or I joined this community.

            <p>It is our choices that show what we truly are.  Dann was not commenting on you, as a person, but on your behavior in this community.  Someone can be a perfect angel in their day-to-day life, but if they go online and act like a jerk, the other online people will think they are a jerk.  (Insert self-deprecating humor about caring for animals but being rude to zoo customers here.)  The way you act is the only part of you that any of us can see, and yes: when you ignore advice and try to skirt around problems instead of discussing them, people <i>will</i> have a problem with that, because that is rude.  You seem to think that being called on such behavior is a defamation on your person, but without realizing that the way you&#39;ve acted towards some of the people who have been trying to help you hurts their feelings, as well.<br><br>Also, saying your request was disorganized, or any other criticism of your work, is also not an attack on your character as a person; they are pointing out mistakes in the writing you created, or the format you presented it in.  Permission really does need to be earned, and it is your responsibility to put in the work necessary to present your work to the PGs in a way that they can make a proper decision.<br><br>As to your last paragraph, the prompt doesn&#39;t actually have to be canon to your spin-off.  Many of the prompts are things that wouldn&#39;t normally happen, at least not for every author&#39;s agents.  The only point is to show the PGs that you can write well.  Haven&#39;t seen them in a while.  Let&#39;s see . . .<br><br>Here&#39;s the only control prompt I haven&#39;t already shown in my spin-off:<br><br><i>&quot;So, Doc,&quot; Vania said, lowering the book away from Doc&#39;s face with a finger.  &quot;How did you wind up in the PPC, anyway?&quot;<br><br>Doc watched the finger, eyes widened, but answered absently, &quot;There was a paper sign posted at the library.  Sounded like just a seminar or something, but there were other words there too, after a few seconds.&quot;  He carefully lowered the book out of the hook of her finger and held it away from Vania.  &quot;Actually, it was kind of like reading the Words on a mission, now that I&#39;ve seen those.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh.&quot;  Vania nestled her elbow into Doc&#39;s mattress, apparently standing on her own below.  &quot;Wonder how they did that.&quot;<br><br>Doc shrugged.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  Anyway, those extra words gave instructions to get into some hidden closet in the employee only area.  There was a portal there.  I went through, and there was a Dandelion there, who escorted me to the Marquis.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wow.  Worst ending to a library trip ever.  Wait, Libr--&quot; Vania&#39;s eyes flicked to the bookshelf, where Doc had unloaded a wheelbarrow&#39;s worth of novels onto the shelves.  &quot;Did you . . . ?&quot;<br><br>Doc scowled.  &quot;No.  I did not ROB a LIBRARY, Vania.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fine!  Just asking!  But, uh, where did you get the wheelbarrow?&quot;</i><br><br>And I have no clue where Doc got the wheelbarrow, and don&#39;t have the time to think on it now, as I work a twelve-hour shift in the morning and need sleep.  But my point is, this is clearly not canon: my agents are OOC (they do not yet get along this well; Vania is also rather dull here), and I&#39;ve never seen anything so <i>brazen</i> as a portal just sitting around where random library staff could see it.  (It&#39;s also quite shoddy, with bare-bones action, little background, and no plot, as I threw it together in just under fifteen minutes.  Actual permission requests should have more work put into them than that.)  But that&#39;s okay, as it&#39;s only a writing exercise, meant to demonstrate that I can write (I hope, lol), not to commit me to any new plotlines in my spin-off.<br><br>(Dann, I apologize if I&#39;ve misrepresented you in any way.  Feel free to correct me.)</p>

            <p>I could stop thinking of myself as a horrible person, but that just leads to angst about why people in town give me the stink-eye from across parking lots.  I suppose I should stop having ambivalent thoughts about people of color because everyone stares at me like shoe-muck now, not just them.<br><br>As I recall, the first request was denied because they felt I would be the type of person who wasn&#39;t actually going to write, I was using my secondary team, (who I&#39;ve ended up working with more than my primary team,) and an error in the file that never showed up on my machine.  <br><br>The second one was bad because I felt I had to use my primary team when I really didn&#39;t want to write their origins or first meeting, which do have a dark tone when their later interactions would be funnier.  Then when Nesh started accidentally jerking me around, it was very unfortunate that my brain snapped or I probably would have let it quietly fester.  It never was about the writing.  And the next person to look at it specifically said that my attitude was uninspiring.</p>

            <p>Firstly, and most importantly: The racist comments.  They stop now.  I mean <i>immediately</i>.  They have no place in this community, and will not be tolerated.  Not on this Board, not on the Wiki, not in the Chatroom.  I wish I could tell you to drop it from real life, as well, but sadly, that&#39;s out of my jurisdiction.

Period.<br><br>And back to the initial point: there is a search bar at the top of the main page of the Board.  Now you know how.

            <p>All those cases are (presumably) instances where a PPC author used characters from another, unfinished story of theirs as PPC agents.  So it&#39;s not really a question of the PPC &quot;getting a hold&quot; of them; it&#39;s just that the author put them there.  (Again, this is usually explained by the unfinished story being full of plotholes and the character(s) dropping through into HQ.)<br><br>Now, as to your assertion that the wiki doesn&#39;t have that information: typing &quot;training&quot; into the wiki&#39;s search bar would yield you the page with the same title.<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Training"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Training">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Training</a></a><br><br>That page has examples of training in a section at the bottom.  Most are individual training missions, but one link leads to one of my favorite PPC spin-offs (despite its many typos): Meta&#39;s training class under Monty Biggins.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SLtzLKNCqGReelTkWFeaTu7ZU1Vog9BuWA2Bcm_qDd4/edit?hl=en_US"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SLtzLKNCqGReelTkWFeaTu7ZU1Vog9BuWA2Bcm_qDd4/edit?hl=en_US">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SLtzLKNCqGReelTkWFeaTu7ZU1Vog9BuWA2Bcm_qDd4/edit?hl=en_US</a></a><br><br>Which depicts newbie agents living in HQ without being part of an active agent team&#39;s RC.

            <p>Sometimes this is because people have tackled a question in different ways over the years, leading to apparent contradictions. Appropriate response: Pick the one you like best, or make up something new! Knowing and respecting what came before you is a very good idea, but your spin-off is not 100% obligated to acknowledge anything except the Original Series as canon.<br><br>Or, in some cases, because the question doesn&#39;t <i>need</i> an answer. Appropriate response: HQ is weird like that. Move on!<br><br>Often, though, it&#39;s simply because no one&#39;s written about that particular scenario yet. It&#39;s a big multiverse out there, y&#39;know? Appropriate response: Be creative! Come up with your own answer, and make it fun!<br><br>&#39;Course, you can&#39;t know which is the case without doing a lot of reading. I dunno how many spinoffs are out there, let alone individual missions, and we keep managing to turn up more hidden away in old message boards and obscure personal sites. Not even us oldbies know <i>everything</i> there is to know. So really, if you want all the details about all the things, the only way to get there is to read, and keep reading, and never think you&#39;ll ever be done reading. &#39;Cause the minute you do, someone like me, or doctorlit, or hS will dig up a story none of us has ever heard of, like <a href="http://z1.invisionfree.com/No_Cookie_for_You/index.php?s=4a6dca35833cf68b1e4b7d485862f01b&amp;showtopic=277&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=220020">this</a> and <a href="http://z1.invisionfree.com/No_Cookie_for_You/index.php?showtopic=413&amp;st=0">this</a>.

            <p>Minor gripes aside on how Rasheeda bint Giza should have an Ancient Egyptian name instead of an Arabic name (I.E. &quot;(something) sat Giza&quot;, as &quot;Sat&quot; is &quot;Daughter&quot; or &quot;Daughter of&quot; in Ancient Egyptian), these have turned out pretty well.<br><br>Just as an aside, when I read that Rasheeda&#39;s trigger in a fic is &quot;excessive, unwarranted violence, along with any deplorable and/or explicit variants thereof&quot;, two <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HG8FEwZ9CB8oTkJ8ZbRSXvapc2ECAvq62lL4ENi-rbE/edit?hl=en_US">pony</a> <a href="http://www.equestriaforums.com/index.php?topic=4527.0">fics</a> came to mind, probably a mark of how long I&#39;ve been looking at the OOC-and-grimdark-as-flapjacks genre of badfic as applied to MLP. Warning: both of them are rated NSFW and NSFB for combined rape and gore. Yes, I said both. The second one links to an MST because I can&#39;t find the original page I found it on.<br><br>I wonder if one of them could end up the one that you and I collaborate on.

            <p>Rasheeda sat Giza, while more accurate, just sounds weirder to me, so I&#39;ll stand by Rasheeda bint Giza for now. I gave her a modern name because she&#39;d probably have changed her nomenclature to suit the altered customs over the years, such as how Egyptian names adapted a more Middle Eastern dialect recently.<br><br>Funny you should mention Sweet Apple Massacre - I actually had that exact fic in mind when writing her backstory. I do have someone in mind for Rasheeda&#39;s former partner, and if I can claim that fic in the future, maybe I could write a sporking of it as a &quot;flashback episode&quot; in which her former partner explains the events that led to her transferring to Floaters.<br><br>For our collab, though, I was actually thinking of something with chapters, rather than a one-off which I feel could be handled reasonably well by just one team. Missions involving two teams tend to be pretty lengthy based on what I&#39;ve been reading...</p>

            <p>...In Rasheeda&#39;s bio, you mention her originally in DIA and going into a fic with a partner.

            <p>I&#39;d probably have her trying to rescue an unfortunate agent or two from the badfic in question along with her partner, only for everyone else to get maimed when she loses control.

            <p>Yes, against all odds, <i>all seven</i> of us managed to get to London and find the British Museum by the appointed time. We spent three and a half absolutely bonkers hours wandering around, interpreting hieroglyphs, ogling the pottery, attempting to find the One Ring, and going off on random tangents about everything from <i>Codex Alera</i> to <i>A Very Potter Musical</i> to the intricacies of centaur-human fighting (I know, I know, something actually <i>related</i> to the <i>exhibits</i>? Madness!)<br><br>A full report will be written later - hopefully less &#39;later&#39; than the <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/BathGath.htm">Bath &#39;07 report</a> which was two years late - but for now, here&#39;s our &#39;2014 PPCffindor Quidditch Team Photo&#39;:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/2014QuidditchTeam.jpg"><br><br>From left to right, we are:<br><br>Huinesoron (Beater), the Irish Samurai (Beater), Cassie (back; Chaser), Fractal Dawn (front, Seeker), Storme Hawk (back; Keeper), Kaitlyn (middle; Chaser), Lycaenion (front; Chaser)<br><br>Obviously we lost miserably - I mean, can you imagine me on a broom? It&#39;s a scary thought.<br><br>Anyway, it was great fun. To anyone trying to plan a Gathering - they work! They&#39;re great! Get half-a-dozen-plus-one PPCers together in one place and hijinks <i>will</i> ensue.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Cassie - yes, I did, and you&#39;re welcome. ^_~)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve taken to tracking the Board statistics as a way of getting some of the same data. So I can tell you that we had 67 posting members last month, with the top three in terms of post-count being zdimensia (204), Anonymouse (79), and me (68). I can also tell you that our #1 recorded-posts-of-all-time is Neshomeh - but that I&#39;m steadily creeping up on her. You come in at #7 (with the intervening four being Sedri, Lily, Cassie, &amp; Laburnum). In fact, a couple more months and you&#39;ll probably pass Laburnum - she&#39;s only a hundred or so above you, and that&#39;s as of July 31st.<br><br>I can also show you our visitor stats, with the unique IPs per day in black, and posts per day in blue:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PostsIPs.png"><br><br>We have this strange pattern going on where we lose activity between March and June every year, then pick it up again afterwards - the posts-per-day extended graph shows it going back for years.<br><br>But the actual census?

I&#39;ll refrain from commenting on anybody <i>else&#39;s</i> political leaders, but our three options right now are:<br><br>-David Cameron, leader of the Conservative Party, very fond of shutting down and selling off anything nice he sees.<br>-Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, theoretically the centre-left party, but currently in a coalition with the Conservatives and parroting their every word. Thanks, Nick! Never voting for <i>you</i> again.<br>-Ed... hang on, I have to check. Right. Ed Milliband, leader of the Labour Party, which used to be pretty darn radical socialists, but in the runup to the next election, seems to have gone for &#39;people voted for the Conservatives last time, so let&#39;s imitate all their policies!&#39;. I&#39;m&#39;m not pleased (but will have to vote for them anyway on a &#39;least of the near-identical evils&#39; policy).<br><br>Oh, but there&#39;s also:<br><br>-Nigel Farage, leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, who want to kick out everyone who&#39;s not white, cut off ties with Europe, and as far as I can tell, build a wall around England and euthanise all the poor people. UKIP scare the life out of me, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election">the fact that they&#39;re doing so well</a> even more so.<br><br>I just want a government that thinks taking care of the entire population is the most important thing on its list, and isn&#39;t afraid to extend that to the <i>global</i> population, too. Is that too much to ask? <i>Apparently</i>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... between UKIP and the BNP, apart of course from vote share... but I don&#39;t have the faintest idea what they are.<br><br>My main problem... well, okay, right now my main problem is the consuming fear that we might end up with UKIP forming a major part of our next parliament, a la Jewish Home.

            <p>Currently the United States has a very strong conservative party- the Republican party- and a &#39;I&#39;m not with those other guys&#39; party- the Democrat party. <br><br>So the result is really a extremely strong and focused party on the conservative side, and then a party that&#39;s made up of everyone else who doesn&#39;t actually want to call themselves a thirty party even though it results in an extreme dilution of the party they&#39;re part of, and everything slides further to the right in general.<br><br>Our &#39;liberal&#39; party, the Democrat party, is actually very moderate and far more conservative in comparison to cultural progress than it had been, say, twenty years or so ago- and the same- but much more so- with our current Republican party.<br><br>(Plenty of politicians who considered themselves firmly in the Republican party have either shifted over to the Democrat party in the meantime or have been accused of being &#39;Republicans In Name Only, as a result of this. There&#39;s not much of a difference between a moderate &#39;Republican&#39; and a moderate &#39;Democrat&#39; in actuality; our two parties are fairly similar when actual moderates are involved.)<br><br>You can actually make a stunning comparison of similarities in terms of actions and policies between Presidents Nixon and Obama- despite the fact that Nixon was very much a Republican and Obama is a Democrat.

            <p><a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/">I have no idea how reliable &#39;The Political Compass&#39; is</a>, but it&#39;s interesting. It purportedly shows that <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/uselection2012">the last US presidential candidates were nearly identical</a>, and, alarmingly, that <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/ukparties2010">all the UK main parties are drifting to the same place</a> (at the bottom of the page).<br><br>But guess what else it&#39;s got?<br><br><a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/test">It&#39;s got a test.</a><br><br>The result isn&#39;t a single left/right; I <i>think</i> their left-right scale is how much control the government should have over economics (which I think includes things like welfare/social security), while top-bottom is how much control they should have over social/moral issues. According to the results page, they peg Stalin as high government control on both, Thatcher as high on social and low on economic control, and, uh... most current US/UK politicians in the same place as Thatcher. ;)<br><br>So I&#39;m curious; where do you (plural) fall when you take the test? I&#39;m way down in the green (yellow? Colourblind), at -6.50/-6.56... which apparently makes me more Dalai Lama than the Dalai Lama. I think I understand why I&#39;m annoyed at the political system now...<br><br>(If enough people feel like doing it, we can make a labelled graph; they have a page for that. Also, if there&#39;s something bad about the website, do let me know; I&#39;ve only skimmed it)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>For me it claimed -7.38, -6.41, fairly solidly 3/4ish down the diagonal of the left/libertarian quadrant. I find this somewhat inaccurate, as I think I&#39;m somewhat more given to faith in a well-run state if such a creature could ever exist. Would be nice if it did, but, well.<br><br>I think part of the reason it gave me as libertarian a score as it did--and I do use lower-case l libertarian, because the Libertarians in the US are kinda creeptastic--is because while I would like to see a solid, supportive state, I was also raised never to stop questioning because it&#39;s in questioning that progress can be made. So... yeah, answer is a bit deceptive, but not bad, I guess.</p>

And when homeowners could no longer pay them what they demanded, they went to government and got trillions of dollars of bailouts. Every effort of the Obama Administration has been to prop this system up and keep it going at taxpayer expense. It&#39;s time for this game to end.

The large-scale geography is laid out, of course (though the Republic of Iric is still lacking in <i>any</i> feature-names...

So that&#39;s something people could work on, too... I ran out of ideas last time.<br><br>I&#39;m also considering convening the Baronial Council (if I can get enough of my fellow Barons to attend). On the agenda would be the derelict state of the baronies of Araeph and Makari (and the possibility of distributing portions to other baronies), the lack of communication with Iric (see above), the state of the Huinesoronian tax havens (and how we should just extend Ozerbord&#39;s borders to encompass them)... and as always, Duchess Kaitlyn&#39;s efforts to obtain independence for El-Jheycom, despite the fact that it&#39;s never going to happen.

            <p>All of my research into sue-wraith banishment says that any religion&#39;s banishment methods, adapted for use in PPC missions (IE replacement of the Bible with a source of canon), are acceptable banishment methods, yet I have only seen the Christian &quot;Bell, Book, and Candle&quot; method employed. Often, I don&#39;t even see the candle bit, only seeing a random bell and a source of canon employed.<br><br>The problem here is, I&#39;m Wiccan. In Christianity, &quot;magick&quot; like banishment is simply having God solve the problem- hence hitting the possessed person with the Bible, symbolic of God&#39;s will.<br><br>In Wicca, magick- again, like banishment- is more hands-on, the gods entrust us to use our magickal energy to solve the problem. I see hitting a possessed canon with a source of canon and think, well, you&#39;re basically hitting a wraith with canon to get it out of canon.<br><br>Not really effective with my point of view.<br><br>Wiccan banishment often employs one of two approaches. The first is simply gathering up a lot of magick and willing the spirit out, but that&#39;s not really feasible here.<br><br>The second, however, is a lot better. An amulet or gem or doll or whatever is made and placed on the possessed person, er, character. Magick is then used to bind the spirit, er, wraith to the token instead of the canon, kinda like what a Crash Dummy does with first-person Sues, which- in my opinion- are Wraiths that exert a lot more control and control the reader (or, in this case, an agent) instead of a canon. The token is then terminated. (The ritual I got this from used bathwater that&#39;s dumped out instead of a token that&#39;s terminated, but it works either way.)<br><br>Of course, if you do something magick that&#39;s supposed to replace the Bell, Book, and Candle, it needs to be surrounded by a ritual. Events of a ritual:<br><br>&gt;Casting a circle of sacred space. This acts as a kind of &quot;church&quot;. Like the implementation of the Bell, Book, and Candle approach, this can be done practically anywhere.<br><br>&gt;Call the Quarters. These spirits represent the elements, the four cardinal directions, and attributes of humanity.<br><br>&gt;Call the God and Goddess (essentially, all of the gods and goddesses condensed into two holy entities) to watch over the ritual. Obviously, I&#39;ll fill in here with the author instead of the actual God and Goddess, the same way that Bell, Book, and Candle banishments will say that the author, and not God, compels the wraith to leave.<br><br>&gt;Do the deed. This will be binding the wraith to the token.<br><br>&gt;Cakes and Ale are blessed and passed around. This is a generalization, as the &quot;ale&quot; can be any drink and the &quot;cakes&quot; can be any baked good. Obviously, I&#39;ll stick to canon, like Sandviches or Bread and rum or whiskey from the Demoman&#39;s loadout for TF2, or milk and cupcakes for MLP. I&#39;ll also go ahead and throw out the &quot;baked good&quot; requirement for Cakes if necessary- like, if I would need to go into a canon without baked goods, I&#39;d use any kind of food. (I&#39;ll also have Cheesy lampshade that, yes, if it weren&#39;t for the fact that it&#39;s part of the ritual, it&#39;d be a complete waste of time.)<br><br>&gt;The God and Goddess are &quot;released&quot; (really, nothing is keeping them there except for politeness), then the Quarters.<br><br>&gt;Finally, the Circle is &#39;opened&#39;, and the agents can get to the dirty work of neuralyzing the canon and executing the bound wraith.<br><br>Yes, it&#39;s a lot more drawn-out than the simple and climactic Bell, Book, and Candle, and already, I see a problem with my characters- Cheesy flat-out refuses to eat and drink due to regarding digestion as disgusting, which puts a knot in the middle of Cakes and Ale.<br><br>Your thoughts?</p>

            <p>Prompted by the discussion of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=262534;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Anebrin</a>, I got to pondering whether agents from canon worlds would (or could) use canonical banishment methods. Which, of course, took me back to Middle-earth. In Arda, there are basically two methods of driving out evil.<br><br>1/ Song. Finrod duels with Sauron in song, Luthien uses it to bring down Minas Tirith (the original), I believe Sam or Frodo attempt this against Shelob (and fail, but still). The Elven languages actually work pretty well on their own - <i>Aiya Earendil elenion ancalima!</i> - as well.<br><br>2/ Eldarin artefacts. The Silmarilli are obviously the number one suspect - they burn unclean flesh, purified Beren&#39;s chewed-off hand, glorified Earendil, and - in the form of the Star-glass - drove off Shelob for a time. But there&#39;s also the Three Rings - Nenya in particular is depicted as holding evil out of Lorien - certain swords - Anduril, Ringil-which-wounded-Morgoth - and even such trivials as the jewel Arwen gave to Frodo (in the book), which helped him recover to some extent from his Morgul-wound.<br><br>Essentially, these two invoke a) the Music of the Ainur, and b) the Light of Valinor, either directly or through the works of the Light-Elves. To cast out spirits of <i>uncanon</i>, we&#39;d need to tweak things. The song we use would have to be a canon song; instead of Elven artefacts, we&#39;d use things made by the creator. Which leads to this scene:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Aragorn stretched out his hand. &quot;Oh Leggie, my darling love!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Arrie, my sweetling precious love!&quot; called Legolas, running towards him between the trees. Aragorn held out his arms to embrace his beloved, and-<br><br>&quot;<i>A Elbereth Gilthoniel!</i>&quot; sang a sudden voice, high and clear, and a figure in black stepped into the passage between them. &quot;<i>Silivren penna miriel!</i>&quot; The figure raised her hand, and the battered notebook she held seemed to snap into sharper focus than the world all around. Legolas stopped as if running into a brick wall, and the slash-wraiths erupted from the canons, screaming in their reedy voices - only to be snapped up in jars as the agent&#39;s partner darted past.<br><br>&quot;Nice work,&quot; Freckles called, lowering the notebook.<br><br>&quot;Likewise,&quot; said Sandra. She tossed a jarred wraith from hand to hand before slipping it into her pack and squinting at her partner. &quot;By the way, is that...?&quot;<br><br>Freckles glanced down at the notebook. &quot;One of the <i>Book of Lost Tales</i> manuscripts,&quot; she confirmed, and winked. &quot;Don&#39;t worry - the Estate doesn&#39;t know I&#39;ve got it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sandra muttered, &quot;that&#39;s not what I was worried about...&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Which is all well and good. But then it occurred to me that a bunch of the humour of the PPC comes from <i>incongruity</i>. The Flowers are funny because they&#39;re giant sentient flowers - but also because this bunch of psycho assassins is being run by a world-weary bureaucracy. So what if we decontextualise this banishment method...?<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Toby stretched out his hand. &quot;Oh Jarrie, my darling love!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Toby, my sweetling precious love!&quot; called Jareth, running towards him down the passageway. Toby held out his arms to embrace his beloved, and-<br><br>&quot;<i>Dance, magic, dance!</i>&quot; sang a sudden voice, high and clear, and a figure in black stepped into the passage between them. &quot;<i>Put that magic jump on me/Slap that baby, make him free!</i>&quot; The figure raised her hand, and the bundle of cloth she held seemed to snap into sharper focus than the world all around. Jareth stopped as if running into a brick wall, and the slash-wraiths erupted from the canons, screaming in their reedy voices - only to be snapped up in jars as the agent&#39;s partner darted past.<br><br>&quot;Nice work,&quot; Freckles called, lowering the fabric.<br><br>&quot;Likewise,&quot; said Sandra. She tossed a jarred wraith from hand to hand before slipping it into her pack and squinting at her partner. &quot;By the way, is that...?&quot;<br><br>Freckles glanced down at the bundle. &quot;The <i>original</i> too-tight leggings,&quot; she confirmed, and winked. &quot;Don&#39;t worry - Bowie doesn&#39;t know I&#39;ve got them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sandra muttered, &quot;that&#39;s not what I was worried about...&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Which to my mind is actually funnier - partly because the artefact in question is sillier, but also because, well, songs <i>aren&#39;t</i> a tool of banishment in <i>Labyrinth</i>  (which instead uses That Speech, and I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d adapt that method). But if Christian banishments work in Middle-earth, then Ardan banishments will work in the Underground...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Suddenly I have the image of an elf in pony disguise belting out &quot;Giggle at the Ghosties&quot; to drive a wraith out of a pony.<br><br>Anyways, MLP canon-based banishment would, by my understanding, require the agents to somehow acquire and use the Elements of Harmony- which pretty much screams either &quot;sue&quot; or &quot;impossible&quot;.<br><br>However, a Pokemon canon-based banishment would definitely be possible. Wraiths seem to have all the trappings of a ghost, so the weaknesses of a ghost- or in this case, a ghost-type- so naturally it&#39;d be weak to ghost-type and dark-type moves. <br><br>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t see any applications that wouldn&#39;t also hurt the host canon that Cheesy could learn, so that rules out a Pokemon canon-based banishment.<br><br>So yeah, I guess I&#39;ll have to stick with Cheesy using primarily the B.B.&amp; C. method, and Haze using the Wiccan ritual.</p>

            <p>(Just make sure the agent knows all the words. Imagine trying to banish an Attack on Titan Sue with Guren no Yumiya.)<br><br>Also, I remember that in a few really bad missions, the act of quoting canon itself was enough to restore a bit of stability to the Word World. I was thinking that if an agent wanted to be dramatic, he/she/it/xe could quote canonical poetry.(This would probably work best in the Redwall fandom. Seriously, long, plot-relevant poetry is <i>everywhere</i> in Mossflower.)</p>

            <p>The trick is to make the connection between world-centred banishments and <i>canon</i>-centred ones. As you said of the Wiccan technique, the God &amp; Goddess would be replaced by the creator of the canon, and the food would vary depending on location (and, I might venture to add, in canons where there are canonical equivalents to the Quarters, they might be substituted too; the four Greek wind gods could show up in Percy Jackson, for instance). In the Ardan version, you use a canon song and an author artefact, rather than any song and an Elvish artefact.<br><br>So, Pokemon. As you say, using ghost or dark-type moves takes down ghosts. There&#39;s also the Silph Scope, which lets you see/identify obscured ghosts.<br><br>Stepping back, can we use an actual Silph Scope? I&#39;m gonna go with no, because if canon characters could see slash wraiths by looking through one, we&#39;d be in a world of trouble. So how about just taking the general effect of &#39;look through a thing to identify wraiths&#39;, and literally look through the canon? That could be peering through the hole in the centre of a DVD, or between the pages of a book. Kind of interesting.<br><br>So, with the wraith visible, you need to hit it. You can&#39;t use dark- or ghost- moves -- but you can use the things themselves. Chucking a previously-jarred wraith at the possessed character&#39;s head should do the trick. ;) Or, potentially, turning the lights off, though I think that would be too general to drive a wraith out. It could weaken it, though - and something like a cloud of smoke could drive it out.<br><br>But the key is, you have to be able to <i>see</i> it to do those things. Unless you&#39;re looking through the hole in the DVD, you can muck about with the lights all you want; it won&#39;t do a blessed thing.<br><br>As for MLP, I know far less, but again, substitute &#39;canonical&#39; for &#39;canon&#39;. Rather than the Elements of Harmony themselves, pick objects related to the canon or fandom that embody the same principles. Honesty could be a critical review, or an interview with the creator/s. Laughter could be a particularly funny episode - or line, if you don&#39;t want to muck about with physical objects. Loyalty might be embodied in the person of the agent, if they&#39;re a really dedicated fan. Generosity could be a DVD that was given as a present, kindness maybe fanart or something... and to blur the canonical/canon boundary a bit, you could <i>use</i> magic to apply the previous five to the possessed character and drive the wraith out.<br><br>Again, all of that can be cross-applied to other canons. All you need is a dedicated fan/agent to yell a funny line, holding the interview and fanart printed on a page in one hand, their gifted DVD/book in the other, and using some form of magic - or even scifi-type &#39;magic&#39; - to drive out the wraith.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I doubt Cheesy would ever actually look through the pages of a book. He&#39;d more likely scan or obtain a digital version and burn it onto a DVD or other optical disk. And I&#39;m thinking that Cheesy would need to target the Wraith, not the canon- which I picture as hanging over the canon and treating it like a marionette. It strikes me as an even faster idea than the Bell, Book, and Candle- which makes it even funnier when he smacks a Wraith out of thin air in the middle of casting circle.<br><br>The thing about the Elements of Harmony is that only a handful of ponies couild use them at any given time, and they&#39;d all have to be present- and even then, they&#39;d need to actually believe in their elements,and until they get Rainbow Power, have the actual elements. A single pony agent doing that, even with analogues to the Elements, is no small feat, and like I said the first time, borders on Sueish.</p>

            <p>Hmmm, it seems that exorcisms work because the agent believes that they do.  If a pony agent strongly believes that tokens representing the elements can draw on their importance, it should be powerful enough to drive out non-canons.<br><br>I don&#39;t think that agents always adapt the entire ritual to the canon they&#39;re in, though they might adjust the flavor if they have time.  It seems they call on the author, not the local deities.  Though it seems like musicians get a cd playing one of their own songs.<br><br>I need to do more research, but I&#39;m leaning towards one of my agents honestly believing that just yelling and hitting a possessed canon can drive a wraith out, but using canon sources makes it work faster with less bruising.</p>

            <p>True, very true. Still not liking the idea, though. Maybe I&#39;ll try it in a mission...<br><br>The bit about an agent honestly believing that Bell, Book, and Candle can be reduced to noise and melee weapons is an interesting idea, although there are cases where the belief that such can happen could waver- I.E. where a possessed canon gets hit in-fic by a particularly loud monster and is still possessed.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I&#39;m probably only going to do it once on-screen simply because the agents have no clue where the possessed canon comes from.  (Intel mistook it for an OC.) <br><br>Though you brought up something interesting.  What if exorcism also works by how strong the audiences belief should be?  Basically if the beta can poke a hole in it, gotta switch methods.</p>

            <p>Think of it this way. You&#39;ve exorcized canons tons of times with a method, and it works. Then, suddenly, a possessed canon does it to him/herself and it doesn&#39;t work. No matter how many times you do it, the wraith has basically proven itself immune to that exorcism method, and could possibly shake the agent&#39;s faith in the method.<br><br>But really, everything is like that. If you can&#39;t hold up your audience&#39;s Willing Suspension of Disbelief™, you&#39;re doing something wrong.<br><br>Also, if Intel- or anyone, really- could possibly mistake a canon for an OC, that would make it, by neccessity, a Replacement, not a  possessed canon. (Possession means it&#39;s extremely OOC, but you can at least recognise that it&#39;s still the character.)</p>

            <p>I could see that happening.  Might be interesting to find a wraith who is actually performing the BBC method in a fic and have the agents have to justify that it&#39;s not expelling itself because the intent isn&#39;t targeting itself, and he&#39;s not using a source of canon.<br><br>The instance I&#39;m talking about is very strange.  Real world and two canons crossover, the one character seems to be possessing two different canons at different times.  Turns out that what is thought to be his &quot;true form&quot; is actually a third canon from an unmentioned game, and whoever sorted it would have needed to really pay attention to spot that.<br><br>He&#39;s out-of-context and not iconic.  The possessing force has demonstrated the ability to change the eye-color of its host.  Here are the clues about who he is in the fic...<br><br>He was dressed like a beatnik, black turtleneck and pants. He was absurdly pale with dark hair, but his strangest feature was his vibrant purple eyes. No one had eyes that color, and they seemed to have a subtle glow that couldn&#39;t have been caused by contacts. Somehow, he seemed familiar.<br><br>At that moment, a figure appeared on the beach. It was the Gamester in the beatnik form that he had first appeared to me in. I realized that the deathly pale skin made this form resemble the Queen, but the resemblance was a coincidence. I was sure that this was an established character from another game, and that his eyes should be red. The Gamester&#39;s mannerisms fit in with this form almost perfectly.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m certainly not planning on using it; I was just throwing out first-thought ideas. Take it, modify it, whatever you like it.<br><br>The Elephants of Harmony - this seems to be the same sort of objection as &#39;only a priest can conduct an exorcism!&#39; or &#39;you need to be high enough level to knock out the ghost-type even with a type advantage!&#39;. You&#39;re not trying to use the <i>actual</i> Elegance of Balmory - you&#39;re trying to invoke the real-world equivalents. Which are rather less of a handful. And there&#39;s no reason it would have to be a <i>pony</i> agent - non-Earth agents have been using the pseudo-Christian technique for decades!<br><br>But despite that: I agree. ;) It was cobbled together to show that it could be done, but it&#39;s a bit weak. The problem is there&#39;s nowhere to simply slot the canon in, unlike replacing the book, the Silmaril, the G&amp;G, or the Silph Scope. So it&#39;s difficult.<br><br>Oh, and: just when you think you&#39;re having original ideas... <a href="http://pika-la-cynique.deviantart.com/art/GND230-Filk-Hero-403154075">Girls Next Door</a> has done something very similar to this for <i>Labyrinth</i>-verse.

            <p>My thoughts in response fall into, mm, three categories:<br><br>1/ The &#39;bell, book, and candle&#39; description seems inaccurate - most exorcisms I&#39;ve seen (or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g0ydi4ik2JM3jLLkyAui9deCbNNOsWHen4_CgyRDS4c/pub">written</a>!) don&#39;t include bells or candles - just hitting the uncanon with the canon to, as I think you&#39;ve said elsewhere, overwrite the uncanon/reinforce the canonical aspects. But still, I guess the &#39;Book&#39; aspect is vaguely Christian-inspired. This is just a nitpick. ;)<br><br>2/ Training. Specifically, the &#39;Christian&#39; exorcisms have been so universal that agents are clearly being trained in them - that&#39;s the only explanation for <i>everyone</i> using them. Still, the belief-related aspects of the PPC - such as &#39;it&#39;s a bit of a maze, unless you hadn&#39;t noticed&#39; - mean that, essentially, any method you think will work... should work. I think you&#39;ve had that conversation with Nesh, so I won&#39;t take it further; just note that most agents <i>will</i> use the traditional method, because they&#39;re trained in it.<br><br>2.5/ Which invites the specific question: why are your agents breaking the trend? Cheesy is electronic, so I assume he doesn&#39;t have a religion, and therefore wouldn&#39;t be inspired to come up with this. I don&#39;t know about his partner, but the question is one you should answer to your own satisfaction. Simply a trainer who bucks the trend would work, of course - or even just reading about it.<br><br>3/ Time. The reason the &#39;throw the book at them&#39; method works so well is that it&#39;s really, really quick. Take, for instance, Jay&#39;s experience in <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission19.html">Torment</a> - she had an incantation in there (which we all forget these days, go figure), and it still took too long. How long does it take to cast a circle and do a bunch of calling? How long will the binding take? Those parts have to be done against a possessed canon who&#39;s trying to get away from you. And the cakes &amp; ale, releasing, and opening have to be done with an <i>in-character</i> canon sitting in the middle of it. How many of them are going to sit still for that?<br><br>To me, this suggests that any agents using this approach will very quickly come up with ways to streamline it. If a physical circle is required, they&#39;d prepare it in advance and lure the canon in where possible. Is there any way to push some of the work off onto artefacts, rather than saying it all &#39;longhand&#39; at the time? If you can (say) call the Quarters by throwing down four painstakingly-inscribed stones - totally random example - then you could get that done really quickly. Et ketera et ketera.<br><br>hS (apologies for abrupt ending; have to go)</p>

            <p>1: It&#39;s named the Bell, Book, and Candle method because the old &quot;hit them with canon&quot; is a simplification of that Christian banishment ritual. Mainly because I&#39;ve seen numerous references to actual bells and candles.<br><br>2 &amp; 2.5: Cheesy isn&#39;t bucking the trend when solo. He&#39;ll usually carry around a canon bludgeoning device (i.e. a Sandman from TF2) modified to hide a flash drive with a copy of canon inside. However, Haze bucks the trend because he, through his logic, simply can&#39;t figure out how hitting a wraith with canon wouldn&#39;t end up driving the wraith further into canon, and even damaging canon directly.<br><br>3: Absolutely none. Which is why a running gag will (eventually) be that while Haze is attempting to set the ritual up, Cheesy will go ahead and hit the wraith out of the ballpark without him.<br><br>Of course, a whole lot of the talking of the ritual can be streamlined, for example, from &quot;Great guardians of the Watchtower of the East, spirits of Air, we call thee to attend our ritual tonight. Blessed be,&quot; to simply, &quot;AIR!&quot; Probably the first driving the second to happen.</p>

            <p>Regarding hS&#39;s first point:<br><br>Seeing as DVDs have been used as much as books, I always just thought of hitting the uncanon with canon was a blunt instrument because it had to be a kind of spiritual slaying rather than physical one to start with, so you literally bash it out with the distilled essence of canon--and what is more so than the actual method by which canon has been delivered to you? Be it book, movie, video game, or whatever.<br><br>I&#39;m not Christian either, so from my own perspective, it always made sense as a kind of displacement of water by objects. Think about canon as a liquid, with a set size--which sometimes gets added to, sometimes not--and these uncanon things are being dumped in and precious canon is spilling over the sides. So you forcibly shove them aside with true Canon, they are displaced in turn, and the proper amount of Canon remains. It&#39;s just physics, really.</p>

            <p>I recently read the first Hunger Games book, and as a Minecraft player (I&#39;m &quot;Lunamann&quot; in Minecraft, perhaps the PPC could make a faction in some server?) I was struck by not only some glaring parallels to Minecraft in the book (District 12 is a coal <i>mining</i> district, it&#39;s protected by a fence from wild animals- just like the fences erected by many Minecraft players to keep villages safe from mobs, et cetera), but the glaring <i>differences</i> many Minecraft implementations of Hunger Games had to the book.<br><br>First off, the Corn (Minecraftian short name for the Cornucopia) rarely actually looks like a cornucopia, and in FPShg, the Hunger Games from MCBrawl, there <i>isn&#39;t</i> a Corn.<br><br>Second, in the Book, when players enter the game, in the book they are in spots around the Corn surrounded by mines, and if they step off thier square, in Minecraft terms, they explode. Upon the minute being up the mines are turned off. While most implementations in block form include the spots around the Corn (and indeed, this is probably a good reason why the Corn typically is accessible from all sides instead of the one side a book-style Corn would have), you&#39;re either stuck and unable to leave your spot until it begins, or you can move but the game pulls you back like a leash- this is most noticeable in Mineplex, where it&#39;s the latter, and players often abuse it, resulting in players teleporting to where they actually are when the game starts and forgets to pull players back where they&#39;re supposed to be.<br><br>Third, chests. In Minecraft, almost all Hunger Games games are &quot;find chests outside the Corn to get supplies&quot;. This NEVER happens in the book, the closest being Rue&#39;s homemade slingshot. Also, supply drops in the book (where essentially, a &quot;chest&quot; of something parachutes to where you are) only are implemented in FPShg, where you get one after so many kills.<br><br>I could go on and on about this, but you get the picture. Hunger Games as it&#39;s implemented is a lot of fun, but I also want to see a more canon-correct version. I often see a lot of things some servers do canonically right while others don&#39;t- like the Deep Freeze in Mineplex&#39;s Survival Games, which is a parallel to the game coordinators creating natural disasters like forest fires and droughts to push the contestants closer to each other instead of simply warping them to the Corn like other servers do (not that that doesn&#39;t happen anyways), or the supply drops in FPShg, which unlike Mineplex&#39;s renamed Feasts, actually act like the supply drops in the book. However, they always do something wrong, and 9999 times out of 10,000, usually it&#39;s the random hidden chests of items that appear absolutely nowhere in the book.<br><br>Your thoughts on this?</p>

I&#39;m game for a canon-correct version too, but it will probably take a LOT of plugins to pull off correctly, and most servers are capable of pulling off only a few of the necessary details. Getting rid of hidden chests would be interesting but I think it would be pretty tedious too, since you&#39;d have to craft all the weapons and items you use from scratch.<br><br>A PPC Minecraft faction would be hilariously awesome.

            <p>That&#39;s what a faction server is all about. You claim land and nobody else can build on it and break its blocks but your faction. (Typically this also extends to opening crates, opening doors, and redstone input beyond pressure plates.)<br><br>You can only claim as much land as you have enough faction power to keep. You gain around 10 faction power per player in the faction, and each time a player dies they lose 1 faction power.<br><br>You then engage in &quot;raids&quot;. Raids involve the repeated killing of an enemy faction&#39;s players until they&#39;ve lost enough &#39;faction power&#39; to allow you to claim thier land. </p>

            <p>But over time they&#39;ve developed into their own game. If you look at most servers, they no longer call it &quot;Hunger Games&quot; instead it&#39;s more commonly known as &quot;Survival Games&quot; or some variation thereof. The problem is is that whilst we can do many amazing things with Minecraft, there are limitations to it and creating an accurate Hunger Games map is just one of those things that falls outside the limitations, and the &quot;Survival Games&quot; are the best we can do to try and copy it. <br><br>1) It still acts as a Cornucopia though does it not? (bearing in mind I&#39;ve only watched the first film, and that was almost 2 years ago). I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve played on MCBrawl, but both Hive and Mineplex (the two I regularly visit) do both have a Corn in every single one of their maps<br><br>2) That&#39;s not really viable. The most basic way to make mines of that kind would be to have pressure plates on a block with TNT underneath said block, but then there&#39;s no way of making it so the TNT doesn&#39;t blow up without completely removing the pressure plates, and if the TNT is too close to another bit of TNT from another person&#39;s starting block. BOOM. One big chain reaction that would kill every player on the board from the start. Any other way of wiring up TNT and pressure plates to make sure it went off if a person stepped on said pressure plate, but could also be made to stop the TNT from activating after a certain time limit would be either too impractical for a decent amount of players or too slow such that by the time the TNT explodes the person is far enough away such that they won&#39;t be hurt too bad by the TNT. Also if you didn&#39;t have explosion damage turned off you could potentially take out some of the delicate Redstone wiring that I know some people put under their maps, or you could give players blocks which they could use later to either reach a previously inaccessible place,or block themselves in etc.<br><br>3) Most chests are just scattered around because otherwise it would be a very quick game, the game itself would need to be set on Peaceful mode to stop people becoming starving to fast and dying due to hunger, yet be on Normal or above difficulty so that the health regen. is not too quick so Chests need to be around for food at least. Also chests drop in on Mineplex once a Minecraft day (or rather night) at one of several locations around the map, that (normally) hasn&#39;t been taken over by the Deep Freeze. The Compass will point towards the place the &quot;Supply Drop&quot; will land during the night (whilst during the day it points to the closest player) and the supply drops normally have very good armour/weapons in them. I believe Hive has something implemented, but can&#39;t remember for certain, however I do know that at Minecraft midnight every chest is refreshed so it has new items in it, but that&#39;s not quite along the same lines<br><br>Like I said earlier, there are just too many limitations in Minecraft to truly make a cannon-complaint Hunger Games in it.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br>(Storm_hawk in Minecraft)</p>

            <p>1: Well, yes. They do. Even though it doesn&#39;t look like a Corn, it <i>does</i> function exactly like one. That&#39;s not my problem, however.<br><br>As for MCBrawl&#39;s FPShg, you start with a kit- like, so much armor, and so much food, and guns and ammo- because the whole theme of MCBrawl is guns in Minecraft. You then &quot;parachute&quot; down onto the map, and afterwards is a brief safe period in which you take no damage, solving problems with landing in trees and whatnot.<br><br>Which, by the way, I think safe periods are idiotic as regards to canon. The whole point of the Cornucopia in the book was that half of the kids die right then because THERE IS NO SAFE PERIOD.<br><br>2: Well, as <i>mines</i>, you&#39;re right. It&#39;d end up blowing up pretty much everyone, and it&#39;d be impossible to disable. However, you could set it up to make an explosion-like effect and kill the player if they stepped outside before time, via the same kind of mods that allow non-piston-related keeping them in thier spots and Mineplex&#39;s ground-level fireworks when you kill people.<br><br>3: You have a point. However, my main problem with Mineplex&#39;s &quot;Supply Drops&quot; is that the concept Mineplex is using is a chest spawning at a common location everyone knows and/or is informed of- which in the book, is called a <i>Feast</i>. Supply drops in the books are meant for specific players and parachute down to them instead of requiring them to find them, which FPShg does pretty well. (It also has HUGE feasts of tons of chests, but I digress.)<br><br>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s virtually impossible to get rid of the hidden chests all over the map. But some things can follow canon, right?<br><br>Right?</p>

            <p>As others have said, the possibilities are quite interesting, and none of my Agents have any reason to stick to the, um, &quot;Christian&quot; way of banishing Sues (Agent!Des is atheistic, Anebrin probably believed in some sort of nature believe - he&#39;s an elf - and the Librarian is a Time Lord).

            <p>Wicca has no &quot;malevolent&quot; dieties. In fact, the whole concept is thought of as an idiotic mistake.

The main issue is making whatever you choose pragmatic enough to neither risk the lives of the agents nor require a great deal of time consuming clean-up. You could use the mood slime from <i>Ghostbusers II</i> as an exorcism method, for example, but they you have to deal with canonicals that are covered with goo.<br><br>Like Nesh said before, exorcism is one of those PPC things that &quot;works because you want it to.&quot; Neither of my Bad Slash exorcists have any backstory-supported reason to believe in the Christian trappings surrounding the bell, book, and candle ritual (and I am definitely one of the worst offenders when it comes to not including the bell and candle parts in the actual exorcism.) Their reasonings seem to be &quot;this will work because this is how I was trained&quot; for Xericka and &quot;this is how they did it in all those dumb B-movies I watched when I was a kid, so why shouldn&#39;t it work&quot; for Gremlin.</p>

            <p>That also brings up a point. Most actual Wiccan rituals end up with an altar in the center and candles, statues, or even- I&#39;ve seen it before- swords at the edges of the circle, in the cardinal directions, to stand for the Quarters. This of course would take a lot of clean-up.<br><br>However, the altar and candles aren&#39;t strictly necessary. And as a bonus, when casting the circle, you don&#39;t even have to mark it. Recently, my family did a ritual with none of that- the only thing we did was toss colored smoke bombs to the edges of the huge circle for the Quarters, and we had a picnic table nearby to put the Cakes and Ale (cookies and sparkling grape juice) on while we did magick.<br><br>The Agents can do as little or as much altar/circle setup as they want, but I&#39;ll probably do it only as much as we did then- somewhere to put the Cakes and Ale, and something canonical at the edges to represent the Quarters.<br><br>As an example, in TF2, they&#39;d use a Buff Banner bugle for Air, a flamethrower or sword (swords are tied to Fire) for Fire, a medigun for Water (because healing and blood are tied to Water), and a Homewrecker (sledgehammer, because hammers are often tied to Earth) for Earth.</p>

            <p>Hence their ability to keep everything minimal. And no, Cheesy&#39;s not going to just eat without complaining about how unnecessary and disgusting the whole matter is. He&#39;s going to get an alternative method that works just as well for him, and he&#39;s probably going to be the one that will suggest the alternate methods instead of the Cakes and Ale to begin with.

            <p>It&#39;s spelled that way to differentiate between Wiccan magick and illusionary, entertainment-level magic. (Of course, the line blurs when we get into magick in a &#39;magic&#39; setting like MLP or Harry Potter...)</p>

            <p>According to the article, there&#39;s actually a controversy in the Muslim community over the true meaning of Jihad, from internal struggle against evil, to evangelical-ish work, to warfare.<br><br>And yes, I know that Wikipedia&#39;s a shitty source, but <a href="http://essays.ssrc.org/10yearsafter911/ten-years-after-911-controversy-over-the-meaning-of-jihad-remains-as-it-always-will/">here&#39;s</a> at least one source testifying to that:<br><br>&quot;As with “cat” and “power,” so is it with the vocabulary of religions. The word “jihad” when used by Sufi mystics refers to the great internal battle against the ego and the struggle to overcome one’s pride in order to step closer to God. In the hands of political Islamists, on the other hand, the same signifier may refer to a political struggle to win control of the state apparatus. In the hands of others, it may refer to holy war. Note that all of them are using the same signifier—jihad—to communicate things that are rather different.&quot;<br><br>I guess how violent Islam is depends on what group of Muslims you&#39;re referring to or something.</p>

            <p>Or, more generally: don&#39;t confuse people with beliefs.

            <p>There was a story involving a botched exorcism and it being explained that perhaps the exorcism failed because she didn&#39;t believe it would work.

            <p>I&#39;d definitely be interested in seeing alternative banishment methods put into practice. It falls more or less into the category of &quot;it works because you want it to,&quot; so there&#39;s really no reason why not. The challenge, as you&#39;ve discussed, is to simplify it enough to be practical.<br><br>For the cakes and ale, what is the function they serve in the ritual? Kinda seems like it&#39;s just to make everyone feel better after what could be a harrowing experience, and may not be necessary, but correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br><br>You might be interested in reading Phobos&#39; mission <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/phobos/phobos1.html">&quot;I Know What You Did Last Night,&quot;</a> in which a Sue-wraith breaks out of a binding circle and attacks the agents because one of them, a Potterverse witch, thinks the &quot;bell, book, and candle&quot; ritual is silly. (She discusses it with a FicPsych nurse in the next mission, <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/06.2cl.html">&quot;Cosmic Love.&quot;</a>)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not really sure what the actual purpose of Cakes and Ale in a ritual, but I <i>do</i> know that the ingestion of food helps you to &quot;ground&quot; yourself.<br>...<br><br>Anyways, after the use of magick, you&#39;re left a bit drained and, depending on what you actually did, you might need help re-bolting your spirit into your real world (say, if you used magick and meditation to world-walk. Not going into detail on that, as it doesn&#39;t apply here.)<br><br>The purpose of the Cakes and Ale here is to allow the agents to rest and regain their energy so they can forge on with any other parts of the mission, like terminating the token. As for the canon- which I&#39;m going to have join in on this- it&#39;s going to have a calming effect, kinda like chocolate would after a Dementor attack in the Potterverse, and is going to help bolt their own spirits back into the canon and into their own bodies. (This is, of course, explained by Haze when Cheesy complains.)<br><br>Now that that&#39;s out of the way, Agent Decima&#39;s (not Phobos, Decima) encounter with lack of belief in Bell, Book, and Candle could have been something Haze heard about, prodding him into finding this alternative method of banishment when he questions how beating something with canon will expel them out of a canon, and what purpose the Candle even has.<br><br>Cheesy, however, will still have a bit of faith in the &quot;source code&quot; (read: canon) as a weapon. Hence, his attaching flash drives with digital copies of canons to various weapons for that extra damage multiplier against Sues. His reasoning is that he&#39;s &quot;overwriting&quot; the Sue with canon events.</p>

            <p>So presumably, one could substitute whatever they personally find to be grounding/centering/restorative?<br><br>A thought: the more complicated the ritual is, the more chances there are for it to go wrong in a high-stress, unfriendly situation like a badfic. That could make for some interesting storytelling, especially if they have to do it often.<br><br>And yeah, Decima is the agent who had trouble.

            <p>The thing about Cakes and Ale is that it&#39;s a catchall. It does both jobs- grounding and centering <i>as well as</i> restoring.

And I know that kind of complication all too well, despite my own rituals being well planned-out and in a calm environment.

So mote it be.&quot; One ritual, I released Air with &quot;Stay if you <b>must</b>, go if you <b>will</b>.&quot; We joked that this was, essentially, &quot;kicking out&quot; Air, but I can see that taken up to eleven in a mission thanks to the Law of Comedy. Air isn&#39;t just tied to communication, it <i>enables</i> communication, so such a stunt will probably end up with the Agents not being able to communicate for some reason or another, say, Cheesy&#39;s Universal Translator malfunctioning.</p>

            <p>Vantablack doesn&#39;t allow light to escape, so the energy eventually becomes heat.  So the solar applications are probably very efficient.<br><br>For cameras and telescopes, it cuts down on reflections inside the lens assembly by trapping the unwanted light.  I assume that with long exposures, you get strange effects if you don&#39;t limit it as much as possible.</p>

            <p>We can&#39;t charge for &quot;Dark Black&quot; as a Suvian color anymore.

            <p>The light that would beabsorbed by the first coating of Vantablack would be reflected by the second coating of resin. No transparent material is completely nonreflective, there&#39;s always glare or reflections. Besides, any damage to the second coating of resin, like scratches, would simply have the same effect as damage to the Vantablack coating itself.</p>

            <p>The description of vantablack sounds like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration">structural colouration</a>, AKA photonics. That means the structure of the substance is what causes the colour, not electron-based interactions like most things. Butterfly wings are coloured the same way. But that means that if you alter the structure - say, by replacing the air around it with a hard resin - you could very well remove the photonic effect.<br><br>Interestingly, you can do the same thing with <i>sound</i> waves as well as light waves; there&#39;s a sculpture somewhere, I think in Germany, which consists of an array of vertical metal poles. Because of how they&#39;re placed, they completely damp all sound that tries to pass through them.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Although we&#39;re getting increasingly far away from my actual feild, I think that so long as the resin was transparent it wouldn&#39;t do too much to affect the transition between the nanotubes and the outside world- vantablack looks Dark Black from all angles, so it&#39;s unlikely refraction would make a difference.<br><br>I also wonder, on those scales, whether the resin molecues would even fit in between the nanotubes to any appreciable degree. I could be off on several orders of magnitude with that estimate, though.</p>

            <p>Carbon nanotubes are a pretty strong material, and potential applications include military camouflage, so it&#39;s probably pretty strong.<br><br>However, you have to remember that it&#39;s a coating.

            <p>There are plenty of times that we could still charge for Dark Black. <br><br>As you&#39;ve said, it uses a specially arranged matrix of carbon nanotubes to achieve the effect - now a canon like <i>Star Wars</i> probably has access to that kind of technology.

            <p>Nerdanel tapped on the door. &quot;Feanor,&quot; she said, &quot;you haven&#39;t been out in three days. You missed Caranthir&#39;s begetting-day.&quot; <i>Again</i>, she added silently.<br><br>There was a clatter from inside the locked workshop, and then her husband&#39;s voice came drifting through the metal. &quot;No, I can&#39;t have,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s still a dozen minglings away. You said so yourself.&quot;<br><br>Nerdanel passed a hand over her eyes. &quot;Feanor,&quot; she said patiently, &quot;I told you that <i>last</i> time you locked yourself away.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh.&quot; Nerdanel could practically feel her husband&#39;s mind racing as he tried to account for the missing time. &quot;Well,&quot; he said at last, &quot;at least I got my <i>palantiri</i> finished. They were an important step in the Project.&quot;<br><br>Nerdanel held back a groan. Always, now, Feanor&#39;s mind was on &#39;the Project&#39; - though he refused to tell her what it was. All she knew was that it had something to do with crystals - and light.<br><br>There was another clatter, and then to Nerdanel&#39;s amazement, the door actually opened - at least a little, before sticking on some unseen obstacle. Feanor peered out.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just about done here, anyhow,&quot; he said. &quot;Caranthir is upstairs, I presume.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s gone hunting with Celegorm and Angrod,&quot; Nerdanel told him. &quot;I understand Orome has been showing Celegorm some new riding skills.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh.&quot; Feanor looked puzzled, then shrugged. &quot;I suppose it will give me time to prepare his gift, then.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is <i>that</i> what you&#39;ve been doing?&quot; Nerdanel was skeptical in the extreme. And there was something strange about the smudges on her husband&#39;s face...<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Feanor said - whatever his faults, he was always honest - &quot;but this test has been a failure otherwise. I don&#39;t think diamonds are at all suited for the Project; it takes so little effort to change them utterly.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m certain it does,&quot; Nerdanel agreed. &quot;I don&#39;t think the boys will be gone <i>that</i> long, Feanor...&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I&#39;m sure,&quot; Feanor said. He reached back into his workshop and fumbled on a bench. &quot;Tell me, Nerdanel,&quot; he said, &quot;what do you think of... <i>this</i>?&quot;<br><br>He held up the item triumphantly, and Nerdanel scrutinised it. &quot;... it&#39;s a bowl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, yes-&quot;<br><br>&quot;In fact, it&#39;s one of <i>my</i> bowls. The one my mother made me for our wedding.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot; For a moment - just a moment - Feanor looked nonplussed. &quot;Well, never mind that, I&#39;ll make you another one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t <i>want</i> another-&quot; But Feanor wasn&#39;t listening.<br><br>&quot;As you can see, it&#39;s just an ordinary bowl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>My</i> ordinary-&quot;<br><br>&quot;But if I turn it around...&quot; He suited action to word, and spun the bowl to show Nerdanel the interior.<br><br>Nerdanel frowned. &quot;You&#39;ve filled it with something,&quot; she said. &quot;What is that, coal? Onyx? No, it&#39;s not reflective enough to be onyx. Some form of black clay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It isn&#39;t filled.&quot;<br><br>Nerdanel rolled her eyes. &quot;Feanor,&quot; she said, &quot;I can see for myself-&quot;<br><br>&quot;It isn&#39;t filled,&quot; her husband said again, quietly. &quot;Check for yourself.&quot;<br><br>Dubiously, Nerdanel reached out to touch the filling - and her hand passed straight through, into the bowl, until her fingers touched the base. She pulled her hand back as if stung, and stared at the smudges on her fingertips - blacker-than-black marks that seemed to suck in all light.<br><br>&quot;Like I said,&quot; Feanor mused, &quot;diamonds are absolutely unsuitable.&quot;<br><br>Nerdanel raised her gaze to Feanor&#39;s face, smudged with the same disturbing, light-eating material. &quot;Feanor,&quot; she breathed, &quot;how... what...?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I call it Dark Black,&quot; Feanor said with a satisfied smile. &quot;Now, about Caranthir&#39;s present...&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>I&#39;ve always imagined the naturally occurring plotholes, as opposed to the ones intentionally generated by the PPC for navigation, look like shimmery (possibly even sparkly if they&#39;re bad enough), highly concentrated heat hazes. So they&#39;ll visually distort whatever is behind them, and although you can see that there is something there, you can&#39;t tell what it actually is.<br><br>I suppose something in vantablack would also have a similar effect.

            <p>I&#39;ve always thought plotholes are just that - holes in the fabric of reality, so to speak. And a hole does not have substance in and of itself - it&#39;s an absence of something.

            <p>I&#39;m guessing a lot of the drama was on specifically LonCon-connected fora, which I didn&#39;t have access to.<br><br>But from what I&#39;ve seen on John Scalzi&#39;s blog, apparently there were some people arguing that the Hugos are biased against politically conservative authors.  With several awards going to female authors, and one of the &quot;slate&quot; of conservative authors coming in behind &quot;No Award&quot; in his category, there&#39;s apparently a lot of kvetching on the web today.<br><br>Then there were the claims that nominating &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; would skew the voting because people would get LonCon memberships just to vote for &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;.

            <p>OK, so I already know the answer to that question, but the character limit kept cutting off my more sensible questions. <br><br>Anyway, my point is that there will be at least one more PPCer in the States in a few weeks time, because my company is sending me out to Texas. Basically I was thinking about tacking on some holiday to the work trip and trying for a Gathering (yes, I know I&#39;ve just been on one, but it was fun so I want to do it again). <br><br>The details of my trip haven&#39;t been confirmed yet, but I&#39;m likely to be out there either the first or second week of September, and from the discussion I had today I think the second week is more likely. And while my company is sending me to Texas, I don&#39;t have to spend all of my time there. While I can&#39;t really justify a random transatlantic flight, I could probably manage an internal flight if it meant meeting more people.<br><br>I know I haven&#39;t exactly given enough information to organise anything - specifically the lack of dates isn&#39;t helpful. But the way these trips normally work, if I waited till I was sure before mentioning it on the Board, I might not have had the time to organise anything. <br><br>So, yeah, anyone interested in meeting up? </p>

            <p>We&#39;re a pretty major transportation hub, being somewhat central, so you can probably arrange to get a flight that takes you through O&#39;Hare or Midway, and there might be a better chance of collecting other people together here on the fly. Our local transportation system is pretty good, so you can get into the city easily from either airport.

            <p>In that there are a couple of people of there, with a couple more that might be able to drop by - I think this is the most people that can get to any one of the many locations I&#39;ve been offered. Obviously, if I get sent out to America again I&#39;ll try to visit somewhere else. <br><br>At the moment, my work trip is looking like it&#39;s going to be Monday 8th to Thursday 12th of September. I&#39;m assuming that people are going to have school/work/etc. on the Friday, but my company have given me permission to stay out there for the full weekend. So my current plan (assuming these dates don&#39;t change) is to finish my work, fly from Texas to Chicago either Thursday evening or during the day Friday, and be generally available for meeting up with whoever is around Saturday and Sunday. How does that sound?  </p>

            <p>The &quot;traditional&quot; Chicago Gathering plan is to meet up by the old water tower in Water Tower Place, then proceed by light rail and foot to Museum Campus, which has the options of Shedd Aquarium, the Field Museum of Natural History, and the Adler Planetarium. Or, we could catch a bus to the Museum of Science and Industry, further south. The planetarium wouldn&#39;t be my first choice, but we love the other three.<br><br>I&#39;m a fan of the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, but it&#39;s kinda small and aimed more at a younger audience. It&#39;s close to the Lincoln Park Zoo, though, which is FREE, so if you&#39;re looking to keep spending to a minimum, that&#39;s always a good choice, weather permitting. Other free features worth checking out include the Lincoln Park Conservatory (tropical plants, orchids, ferns and such) at the north end, and a little interactive farm and a wetland nature walk at the south end.<br><br>There&#39;s also the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Chicago History Museum, which we&#39;ve somehow managed to miss so far. I&#39;ve heard good things about the Art Institute, but might be a bit similar to the London Gathering?<br><br>I can also see what free stuff is going on that weekend. There&#39;s always a chance for some kind of festival or concert.<br><br>And then you can always come hang out with us in the Lincoln Square/Ravenswood neighborhood. We have some fun little shops and good food up here, and we could play some board games at our place if everyone&#39;s comfortable with that.<br><br>It&#39;s your vacation, though, so the two of us are pretty cool with whatever you want to do. We live here, so we can do the rest whenever we feel like it. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I do like a good science museum. Aquariums and zoos are pretty cool too, especially if they have lots of big cats to look at (the zoos that is - I&#39;d be quite surprised if an aquarium had a big cat section). <br><br>And I&#39;d definitely be up for some board games, particularly as I&#39;ll be missing out on my normal weekly gaming session due to being on this trip (that&#39;s the one downside to these work trips, but I think the travel opportunities more than make up for it). I&#39;ll see if I can find room in my bags to bring along a couple of games myself.  </p>

            <p>So, for now let&#39;s assume Museum of Science and Industry on Saturday the 13th, with dinner and games afterwards. I have a church choir performance on Sunday morning (which everyone would be welcome to attend, not that I expect anyone wants to!), but after that we can do stuff, too, if we&#39;re not dead-tired and/or totally sick of each other. ^_~<br><br>The question is, can Iximaz and Darkotas make it, and when can they arrive? MSI hours are 9:30 am to 4 pm, so to get the most out of it I&#39;d say we should meet about 9:00, but that&#39;s really early unless they can leave Friday and spend the night somewhere. Yet, starting much later cuts out quality museum time.<br><br>Also, depending on where people are coming from and how, it might make more sense to just meet in front of the museum.<br><br>How about I make a new post about this on September 1, and we&#39;ll see how things stand?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So a few years ago, we had a semi-Gathering at Dragon*Con, and it was cool. Dragon*Con is coming up again, as is Anime Weekend Atlanta (which is likely more doable for people, and is one of if not the largest anime convention in the South), and I&#39;m wondering if anybody is interested in getting together for one of them, or any other con coming up for that matter.</p>

            <p>I have some friends going to Dragon*Con, but it&#39;s a little far for me to attend, not to mention really expensive. I&#39;ll be attending Fan Expo up here in the Great White North.

            <p>The &quot;what to include&quot; list doesn&#39;t seem to mention permission prompts, so I&#39;ll use those as the writing sample.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The agents first meet – Kimberly and Hue<br><br>Kimberly studied a crossword puzzle as she wandered through the hallways of HQ. She had never been to RC 414 before, but it wouldn&#39;t have made it easier to find if she had. She became slightly excited to read a room number in the 400&#39;s, but she had been here long enough to know that she wasn&#39;t even close.<br><br>After she grew bored with the puzzle, she popped her chewing gum a few times and decided to head to the cafeteria. The way her luck was going, there was a chance that she would end up at the cafeteria, but wandering aimlessly hadn&#39;t worked. She almost missed the door to RC 414 as she wandered past, but she noticed it just in time.<br><br>A small creature opened the door. It stood about two feet tall, and resembled a ball of fur on legs. A pair of beady eyes and a pink nose were the only features distinguishable in the mass of black fur. It wore blue mittens, socks, and a belt. “Hello?” he chirped in a squeaky voice.<br><br>“What are you supposed to be?” Kimberly had seen stranger things living in the RCs, but it was useful to know the species of your roommate&#39;s pet.<br><br>“Do you speak English?” he asked.<br><br>“What do you think, wise guy? Never met someone from Brooklyn before?” Kimberly bent down so that she could intimidate the fuzzball.<br><br>He made a placating gesture with his hands, then reached behind his back and pulled out a headset communicator. He pointedly showed it to Kimberly before settling it on his head.<br><br>She straightened up and crossed her arms. “Very funny. I&#39;ve been assigned to this Response Center.”<br><br>He gestured inside. “English is hard, do you have a comm?”<br><br>Kimberly rifled in her bag to humor the pipsqueak. Whoever her partner was, they sure knew how to go out of their way for a joke. Her communicator was a bulky walky-talky, but it came with a headset.<br><br>“I&#39;m Hue,” he said before launching into a string of gibberish that sounded like a 33 record played at 78 rpm. The comm&#39;s built-in translator made him sound like a teenaged boy. “So you are my new partner? I&#39;m happy to meet you. I would like for you to learn how to understand Happytalk and I will try my hardest to understand you.”<br><br>“Are you serious? You look like a stuffed animal! Why would someone assign something like you to Despatch?” Kimberly had just lost her patience.<br><br>“Don&#39;t judge me by my looks.”<br><br><hr>
<br><br>One agent loans the other their favorite CD for drowning out badfic. The CD is destroyed. (Could also be an MP3 player.)<br><br>Kim and Hue watched impassively as Twilight Sparkle and world-hopping brony had a conversation that got more romantic by the second.  Eventually, the unicorn led him up to the bedroom.  <br><br>Hue asked a question.<br><br>Kim smirked.  “I think this is a clopfic.  They’re not going to put a discretion cut when the purpose is to watch them going at it.”<br><br>Hue hid behind the chargebook, but he could still hear things that weren’t anyone’s business to know about.  He whimpered softly.<br><br>Kim sighed in exasperation.  “My walkman is in the bag.”<br><br>Hue gratefully shoved the headphones onto his head, and the strains of “Uptown Girl” mostly drowned out the noises.  Then the tape started squealing, and he panicked as he tried to shut it off.<br><br>Kim took his harness in her teeth and dragged him down the stairs as his panicked squawk caused the two ponies to look up from their fondling.  <br><br>At Hue’s explanation, Kim said, “Pull the batteries and put it in my bag.  I’m not gonna be able to look at it until I have fingers again.”<br><br>After they got back from the mission, Kim examined her walkman.  The tape had been pulled into the workings.  She managed to get it loose, but it was badly crinkled.  Kim sighed and wondered if she would be able to find cleaning fluid for the player’s roller.<br><br>Hue entered the RC and set something on the desk next to Kim.  She looked to see that it was a rectangular device roughly the same size as the cassette in her hand.  It had an LCD screen and a circular button on the front and it was covered in scratches.  He apologetically explained that he didn’t know what songs she had on her walkman.<br><br>“This wasn’t exactly your fault, but thanks,” Kim said.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>So based on Tira&#39;s crit, I went back to polish the writing sample.  The original sample is from June before I wrote them into the first mission.  Today is unpolished and unfinished, but I didn&#39;t have to fight to get words on the page.<br><br>Kim went from a puppet in a situation that I had to force to be annoyed to someone who actually had a reason to think that Hue was not competent.<br><br>For the second prompt, she went from someone who just had a walkman because she needed one for the situation to... well it got kinda meta but she actually started talking to me, reminding me that she was a bit once and she might have some holdovers that don&#39;t make sense.  (Sorta like her oral fixation simply because there was a lot of smoking and gum-chewing in movies back then.)<br><br>This wouldn&#39;t have happened if I hadn&#39;t started writing them in situations that made sense to me, which is the argument I&#39;ve been making.</p>

Whoever her partner was, they sure knew how to go out of their way for a joke. Her communicator was a bulky walky-talky, but it came with a headset.  She put it on and sat in the room’s only chair.<br><br>“I&#39;m Hue,” he said before launching into a string of gibberish that sounded like a 33 record played at 78 rpm. The comm&#39;s built-in translator made him sound like a teenaged boy. “So you are my new partner? I&#39;m happy to meet you.

Why would someone assign something like you to Despatch?” Kimberly had just lost her patience.<br><br>“I’m good with a tranquilizer gun,” Hue supplied.<br><br>Kim snorted.  “Great, a violent stuffed animal.”<br><br>Hue shook his head.  “Not violent, just stunning them so they stop doing not-nice things.”<br><br>Kim took her cigarettes from her bag and stuck one in her mouth.  She looked at him pointedly for a moment, but he just watched her.  Kim then lit her cigarette and took a drag.  She had noticed that he had said ‘violent’ in English.  “You’re like one of those Care Bears that my niece liked.”<br><br>Hue had frowned at the smell of the smoke, but then he smiled as he said, “Care Bears are heroes.  Did she like anything else?  Or, what do you like?”<br><br>***<br><br>One agent loans the other their favorite CD for drowning out badfic. The CD is destroyed. (Could also be an MP3 player.)<br><br>Kim and Hue watched impassively as Twilight Sparkle and world-hopping brony had a conversation that got more romantic by the second.  Eventually, the unicorn led him up to the bedroom.  <br><br>The agents hid on the stairs, just barely peeking over the top tread.  Hue gasped as he saw a full view of what Twilight and the insert were doing.  He hid behind the chargebook, but he could still hear things that weren’t anyone’s business to know about.  He whimpered softly.<br><br>Kim sighed in exasperation.  “My walkman’s in the bag.”<br><br>Hue gratefully shoved the headphones onto his head, and the strains of “Uptown Girl” mostly drowned out the noises.

I’m not gonna be able to look at it until I have fingers again.”<br><br>After they got back from the mission, Hue excused himself for one of his strange errands.  Kim shrugged and sat down to transpose the charge list and write the mission report.  Once that was done, she tended to her walkman.  She worked the tape out of the mechanism, gently pressing the play-head down as needed, but it was badly crinkled.  Kim wondered if she would be able to find cleaning fluid for the player’s roller.<br><br>Kim looked at the mixtape, the only one she had on her when she fell out of her badfic.  She didn’t ever feel a real need to carry Billy Joel, Michael Jackson, and Bon Jovi with her everywhere, it was just a random detail of what she was carrying.  There really wasn’t any point to having it now, she just had the walkman in her bag because she thought it should be there.<br><br>Not that it wouldn’t have been useful for her partner if she had been keeping it in working order.  She wondered how hard it would be to get a new cassette.<br><br>Hue entered the RC and set something on the desk next to Kim.  She looked to see that it was a device that was covered in scratches and roughly the same size as the cassette in her hand.  He apologetically explained that he didn’t know what songs she had on her walkman, but he hoped that this music player would work better.<br><br>“Where did you get this?” Kim asked.<br><br>Hue only tapped the side of his nose to indicate it was a secret.<br><br>“Thanks, but you didn’t actually break my walkman, and it jamming wasn’t your fault,” Kim said as she tried to hand it back to him.<br><br>Hue shook his head and emphasized that he wanted her to have it.<br><br>“You’re going to help me pick songs for this thing,&quot; Kim insisted.  &quot;It&#39;ll be for the both of us.&quot; </p>

            <p>First up: I am not a Permission Giver.  I do not have Permission myself.  You should not consider this to be some kind of official statement on the quality of your work.  However, I have noticed some aspects of your writing that could be improved upon.  This is just some friendly critique, and I hope you take it in the intended spirit.<br><br>The first thing I noticed is that your samples feel really, really short.  The first one is technically within the requested length, but just barely.  Moreover, it feels like it&#39;s about half a scene.  It says in the text that Kimberly had just lost her patience, but we don&#39;t really see any fallout from that.  Is she completely placated by his response?  That seems really unlikely for what we see of her character.  The second one isn&#39;t technically within the requested length, which is okay, but it also feels kind of thrown together, if that makes sense.  It could really stand to be fleshed out.<br><br>The other thing is probably the reason that the samples seem short.  Your writing is somewhat stiff and emotionless.  We get a few peaks into Kimberly&#39;s head, but not enough to really get a good sense of her personality.  I don&#39;t think we ever explicitly get to see what Hue&#39;s thinking, which is okay - you can stick with one PoV agent if you want - but makes it hard to get a sense of him besides &#39;cute, fluffy thing,&#39; which is a physical description, not a personality one.  A good example is the end of the first sample.  How does he say his line?  Is he irritated that she’s not taking him seriously?  Disappointed that she doesn’t want to be friends with him?  Trying to be the mature one while Kimberly is on the verge of a temper tantrum?  Any of those is a valid response.  Any of those would be an interesting direction for building both characters.  But we don’t get any of those, and it’s impossible for the reader to judge your intentions.   Similarly, in the second one we get no sense as to how Kimberly feels about her Walkman being potentially ruined.  Is she sad? Cross? Does that tape have any special meaning to her?  And it doesn’t fit with the slightly irritable personality she displays elsewhere.<br><br>Overall, it just comes off a little like you see Permission as a pointless formality, and you’re just trying to rush through it.  Which is specifically mentioned on the Permission page as something you don’t want to do.<br></p>

            <p>I find your accusation offensive.  I find passive comments less-rude, but in light of recent education, I&#39;m the one who was rude.  I am sorry for that.  <br><br>This is the first time that someone actually looked at it for quality of writing.  I&#39;m not sure how to phrase that properly, but it is the truth.  Other comments were just about the length or presentation.  I have resentment about that.<br><br>I compliment Tira on what she did, even if I don&#39;t know how to express it properly.</p>

He’s a one-foot diameter ball of fluff with arms and legs.  He is dyed completely black.  He has beady eyes and a round pink nose.<br><br>He is a sprite from the Rainbow Brite universe.  He was the servant of a Mary-Sue that wanted “to make Dagobah as colorful and beautiful as Earth.”  His fur “is a completely new color that no one has ever seen before,” so he’s required to keep it dyed black.  No one who has seen him can accurately describe whether he is bleen, bismuth, or just plain urple.  His main diet is candy, but he’ll occasionally eat fresh fruit or starchy foods.  Doesn&#39;t take bleep products yet.  He’ll eventually drink bleepka, but never straight; it is always mixed with kool-aid or fruit juice.<br><br>Hue’s fanfiction of origin caused one of the agents to go flamethrower crazy and no-one knows what happened to the agent after he killed the Sue.  Sprites are naturally helpful, and Hue managed to help the other agent through the portal back to headquarters.  After that, he ran in fear from the agents that were trying to contain him.  His obnoxious fur color caused headaches and momentary insanity and he was finally captured in a dark room.<br><br>Hue’s normal language is “Happytalk” which is a rapid succession of babbling squeaks.  Pure Happytalk mostly references negative adjectives as lack of the positive opposite, but Hue has invented some new syllables to describe the horrors he has seen.  He can speak English, but it is difficult for him to pronounce.  He does speak normally when he is disguised as a human, but he’s just as likely to go as a rat or a squirrel that can pronounce Happytalk.  When using him, dialog can either be translated or his partner can do one-sided conversations like in the Luke-centric Star Wars movies.<br><br>His special power is that he can look at obnoxious Sue colors and feel no discomfort.<br><br>Character references: Twink from Rainbow Brite, Care Bears from the 80’s cartoon, Sheldon Mopes from Death to Smoochy.<br><br>Hue is child-friendly in regards to violence.  He recognizes that bad people should be stopped from doing bad things.  He will happily shoot self-inserts with a tranquilizer pistol, but won’t do it if the insert is likely to get hurt.  He believes that the mechanics of coupling should be left to the imagination, but doesn&#39;t realize that he can ask not to do missions involving it. <br></p>

Dark hair usually done in a french braid, dark eyes, average European skin tone, wears red plastic frames.<br><br>She was a bit character in a Ghostbusters fanfiction.  She has a thick Brooklyn accent.  She has seen enough to become jaded, but shows that something bothers her by snarking about it.  She does have a tender side that comes off as grudging respect.  She is from the 80’s but is about as tech-savvy as a modern secretary.  She can write about one-hundred words-per-minute in Gregg Shorthand.  She usually is either smoking a cigarette or chewing gum.<br><br>She is somewhat more Jewish than a typical lapsed Jew.  She’ll refuse to eat pork, shellfish, or cheeseburgers, but will not inquire too deeply about Kosher preparation.  She’ll try to follow holidays if she’s aware of the date, but doesn’t strictly follow sabbath practices.

            <p>Ever since I joined the board, I joked about how haste is bad, and my not so secret fear to have not written what I intended to say. And it’s true. Whenever I didn’t take enough time, I find that I made a mistake (fortunately mostly minor ones, which only offend my own perfectionism). So I still want to believe that zdimensia isn’t malicious, and that she genuinely tried to do right, but nearly always messed it up. I’m not qualified to diagnose this communications problem and to find a treatment, but I’m sure it’s there.<br><br>Our purpose is to improve writing, our own and other’s. But this shouldn’t get into the way of our other purpose: having fun here. Dealing with zdimensia hasn’t been fun for a long time now, and I don’t expect this to change soon.<br><br> I’m wondering whether things might have been different if some Big Sib had taken her hand early on, to guide her and to slow her down [EXPLETIVE not translated]. I sincerely considered to do this when I beta read her workshop contribution, but before I could get my thoughts together, she had already run away and posted again, and again, and again. And I’m Hieronymus the Eremite for reasons, I’m not suited for this kind of job anyway, and I don’t see anybody else who might like to do this tedious work in the near future. We’re all fed up and need time to recover. It’s an act of self-protection, not a punishment. One year seems to be appropriate.    <br><br>It’s still sad that we cannot help. Sorry, zdimensia, I hope you find a way to cope with this.<br><br>HG (not cowardly lying low until the storm is over)</p>

            <p>Back in zdimensia&#39;s previous Permission requests, I offered to beta for her next attempt. During that betaing process, she asked me to also take a look at a mission that she&#39;d started working on - something that I was happy to do as I didn&#39;t see any harm in it, and she accepted that she wouldn&#39;t be able to publish it until she had Permission. <br><br>So while I haven&#39;t had much in the way of in depth discussions with her, I have interacted with her a lot. During betaing I found her polite and easy to understand, with none of the animosity etc. that has marred recent threads. For whatever reason, as Miah noted, zdimensia&#39;s behaviour/ability to communicate is noticeably different between the open Board and private chats. <br><br>Sadly my comments/advice were all about the actual writing, and not about interacting with the community - something that I meant to address, but it looks like I&#39;ve ran out of time for that to do any good here. If I&#39;d known that she was going to make a Permission Request again so soon I would have advised strongly against it. <br><br>After re-reading all of the relevant posts again, my opinion is that she has violated the Constitution, although the impression I get is more one of confusion rather than deliberate malice. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t be prepared to support to a perma-ban at this time, but I would support a probation &#39;one more strike and you&#39;re out&#39;, or a temporary ban to give her time to learn how to fit in with the community here. As for the length of temporary ban, I dunno, a year seems like a very long time for a &#39;temporary&#39; measure - I&#39;m leaning more towards the 6 months end of the scale myself. </p>

            <p>The reason I suggested a year is that, further down the thread, zdimensia has already said that she didn&#39;t plan on posting much until December anyway. A &#39;ban&#39; which constitutes only two months-worth of time in which she would actually have been posting feels like a slap on the wrist, a &#39;ha ha you scamp&#39;, than what it&#39;s meant to be: a firm statement that we are serious about people following the Constitution, and willing to impose severe sanctions on those who refuse to.<br><br>But, as I&#39;ve said throughout - that&#39;s how it feels to <i>me</i>; I make no claims about how the community at large sees it. Nor do I insist on any particular course of action - I don&#39;t have that right, and nor does anyone else. Whatever the community-at-large decides is fine with me.

            <p>I didn&#39;t think it was possible for a thread to turn into a worse cluster than the last one. I&#39;ve been proven wrong.<br><br>Zdimensia has violated the constitution and appears to be willfully and proudly ignoring the permission process. As Phobos has noted (far more eloquently than I could), she has scarcely given apologies - her usual responses when confronted have demonstrated a level of sarcasm and vitriol that would have been on the constitution if we had thought that it was something that would come up.<br><br>In my mind, the conclusion is inescapable - Zdimensia has shown herself to be unwilling or unable to be a member of this community and should be treated as such.

            <p>Namely: perma-ban, enforced with The Nameless Admin&#39;s dreaded and seldom-used banhammer? Or, as some folks seem to be espousing, a voluntary some-month hiatus?<br><br>I submit that we take the voluntary hiatus off the table. My reasoning is pretty simple: unless we see some evidence that zdimensia <i>understands the issues with her behavior</i>, I find it very, very likely we&#39;ll just be having this conversation again, or a very, very similar one, in a few months. Why temp-ban to December 21st without at least some security that we&#39;re not going to see another permission request with the same issues on December 23rd?<br><br>Based on many previous experiences with many previous (and former/ex) PPCers (in the IRC, at least), I find it highly unlikely that a temp ban, without any evidence of an understanding on zdimensia&#39;s part on <i>specifically what she did wrong</i>, is going to do any more than defer the issue for a few months.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s an approximately even split between &#39;temporary&#39; and &#39;permanent&#39;. I counted nine temporary, ten permanent, and one which was too unclear for me to say.<br><br>The only temporary timeline which has been proposed, other than zdimensia&#39;s &#39;4 months&#39;, is &#39;6 months to a year&#39;.<br><br>While I personally support a full ban, I think the clear divide in community opinion is enough to make the correct response a temporary ban. I propose that this should be <b>one full year</b>, running to September 2015; at that point, if zdimensia is still interested, she would be permitted to resume posting on the Board, with the understanding that she would be required to follow the Constitution - ie, that that would <i>be</i> her second chance. If, prior to 1st September 2015, she posted on the Board, she would be permanently banned.<br><br>And... this is always a contentious issue, but we&#39;re not just talking about the Board. I believe the PPC Community should be a <i>community</i>; therefore, a ban issued here, temporary or permanent, should apply to the IRC as well. The Constitution applies equally to both areas, and the Board doesn&#39;t have its own additional rules like the IRC does. Since she is apparently active in the Chat, anyone who only visits the IRC should probably be invited to offer their opinions, too.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think that zdimensia just Doesn&#39;t Get (tm) the PPC, either as a universe or as a community. They&#39;re also rather hard to communicate with, and seem to miss the point of what people are saying to them a lot.<br><br>Now, what I&#39;ve pointed out above is, in my opinion, cause to deny Permission. However, zdimensia was also rather racist and didn&#39;t actually change their behavior after their apology, which seemed a bit insincere. I don&#39;t believe that the PPC is a place for racism or other -isms, and I think that zdimensia&#39;s behavior is inconsistent with the culture of the PPC. Also, zdimensia has, as others have explained downthread, attacked many other people in the community in a way that&#39;s against the spirit of the Constitution.<br><br>Because of all this, I think a temporary ban (few months to a year) is in order so zdimensia can try to better understand what we&#39;re about before participating in the PPC.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve tried to keep out of this so far, other people have been able to handle this matter far better than I could. But, with this more open invitation to speak I feel like I should. <br><br>As almost everyone else as said, this is too soon for a Permission Request considering the events down-Board. <br><br>That&#39;s not my main problem however, what is is the way that zdimensia is treating, not just the other people on the Board but the whole situation and even, dare I say it, the PPC itself. There seems to be a distinct lack of respect being shown to some of the more respectable and elder members of the PPC (no offence to anyone meant), as well as a habit for dodging and diving, making excuses and finding ways to try and squirm out from taking the full blame responsibly and doing something about it. It also seems to me that zdimensia does not care about the community or the rules of the PPC, not just the Constitution, and sees it only as a stepping stone and a place to write her own missions, whether they are on badfic or just pieces of fiction she does not like. <br><br>I fear that my words may seem to harsh, but I find myself having trouble directly transposing my thoughts on this matter. <br>If, and it seems it will, come to a ban then I would, and if I had any control in the matter I would restrict it to say six months to a year, if after that time zdimensia can come back and become a fully functioning member of the community who respects all others and the PPC itself then let her try for Permission in the future, if she does not return at all, then we may assume she has found somewhere else to set up base, or maybe simply given up on the idea, and if she comes back, but cannot function within the community then a full ban could come into effect. Although I do not know how easy things like this are to do on the Board.<br><br>Storme Hawk.</p>

Given how little I know of this individual, I honestly don&#39;t have that much to say on this matter, and I didn&#39;t want to say this out loud, but the way everyone has been responding to their actions legitimately terrified me for a moment - of course, I&#39;m not really calling out anyone, but still, it could very well have been myself who could&#39;ve been attracting so much ire.<br><br>To explain in greater detail, I actually exhibited the exact same problems as zdimensia here up until a few years ago. Sometime during 2011, I joined a group on deviantART that was about a collaborative crossover story involving multiple artists and writers, and specifically I somehow managed to shoehorn my way into the group of main admins. I insisted on having my way, writing other peoples&#39; characters into my own stories, and inserting my own characters into theirs. When they called me out on this, I responded with sarcasm and spiteful comments, and when I specifically asked one of the major admins to write something for me despite their being busy, said admin put his foot down and, after failing to convince me to stop what I was doing, he eventually banned me from the group in its entirety.<br>Throughout most of 2012, I ended up in a standoff with the people concerned. I tried everything from apologizing to actually working towards a creative effort, but not only did I inherently fail to accept responsibility for my actions (&quot;Oh noooo, why did they have to ban me? I didn&#39;t deserve it because like, I&#39;m so creative and special!&quot;), but I also slavishly worshipped their ideas too much to think of my own. So these people went the extra mile to criticize and eventually publicly libel the art and writing I had produced at the time. The whole ugly business was settled at the end of the year, and we&#39;ve gone our separate ways, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that it still happened. If there was any one good thing that came of it, the fact that these people got upset led me to realize that my behavior was hurting their feelings, and it&#39;s why I&#39;m much nicer and more considerate these days.<br><br>Mind you, these very same attitude problems I had back then  were the exact reason that the one and only badfic I&#39;ve ever written (which I plan to spork once I get permission, of course) turned out the way it did. That and wanting to bone a certain Violet Parr and turn her into a dinosaur.<br><br>Ugh, I did not want to have to revisit all the ugly memories of the above incident, but the point I&#39;m trying to make is that no matter how much zdimensia here is apologizing, <i>IT&#39;S NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT SHE DID ALL THIS UNLESS SHE OWNS UP TO HER MISTAKES.</i> I know from experience that people can&#39;t and probably won&#39;t trust your apologies unless you make good on them. Especially on the Internet where we can&#39;t tell whether they&#39;re genuine. If she can prove, however, that she can communicate in a civil manner, admit that she was wrong in saying the things she did previously, and do her research before rushing in with her metaphorical guns blazing, I&#39;d be willing to call a ceasefire as well. I just don&#39;t see that proof just yet.<br><br>So, to zdimensia: If you really are sincere, and judging from what I&#39;m reading I won&#39;t discount that you&#39;re genuinely trying to back off, I have a feeling you&#39;ve still got a lot of ground to cover. I&#39;ve spent most of my time since joining actually reading up on the PPC and all related literature, so as to get an idea of what I&#39;m up against once I request permission to start writing missions. Needless to say, I will kindly advise you to do the same, not in the least because it&#39;ll certainly help you avoid flak like this. And honestly, six months to a year should give you plenty of time to do exactly that.<br><br>And in the meantime, I know you want this put behind you, and honestly I feel the same way, but like I implied above, actions speak louder than words. So while I&#39;ll be willing to forgive you if you make good on what you&#39;ve said, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone in that I can&#39;t trust you to create content for the PP...il you can prove that you&#39;ve got what it takes to handle the job.<br><br>Tl;dr: Seriously, kid. <i>MAN UP.</i></p>

            <p>I deliberately didn&#39;t state a course of action, in order not to prejudice other Boarders, but for my money, zdimensia has outstayed her welcome and should leave, permanently. Some side-comments:<br><br>-The voluntary departure until December should not be accepted, mostly because of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=262836;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">&#39;I want to propose a post-nanowrimo beta-party...&#39;</a>. That statement confirms what others have feared - that if she left and came back, she would go directly into the &#39;pay attention to me, I am the centre of the world&#39; attitude we&#39;ve been seeing all along.<br><br>-However, any ban should be &#39;voluntary&#39;, in that it doesn&#39;t necessarily require a technical ban from the Nameless Admin. If she <i>breaks</i> the &#39;voluntary&#39; ban, then IP-blocking and post-deleting should be brought into play. But I&#39;d prefer to rely on community action where possible.<br><br>-Counting me, the voting now seems to be around 18 votes to ban. That&#39;s a stronger consensus than I&#39;ve seen here in a long time.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Is that, either way, no matter what happens in this thread you&#39;re likely to not really post until around the 21st of December. Thus &#39;proposing&#39; that you go way for those four months is pointless as you&#39;re going to be away for those four months anyway and this time of &#39;exile&#39; isn&#39;t you offering an olive branch it&#39;s just something you were planning on doing anyway. <br>However, if say you offered to leave for four months after that, that would be seen as more of an olive branch, you&#39;d been seen as taking time away from the PPC on your own accord, not just because you have to, and I believe it would be better accepted. <br>Of course, this is just hypothetical and I&#39;m not 100% sure if what I&#39;m saying matches up with what Iximaz meant. <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>I agree with what&#39;s been said by the others. ZDimensia doesn&#39;t seem to listen to the other Boarders without a great deal of fuss. Moreover it looks rather like they&#39;ve set themselves as the victim here, who&#39;s being bullied by a nasty community. They&#39;ve also made a few statements that just ping me as being ableist - for instance, the whole epileptics thing. And just in general, I find it very hard to parse what they&#39;re saying. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve talked to Zdimensia quite a lot on the IRC. Sometimes, especially with a small crowd, she makes perfect sense, and doesn&#39;t say chat-killing or kick-worthy things. It&#39;s kind of nice to have another older person to talk to, and both our husbands are into homebrewing, so there is another common factor. I&#39;m just saying this, because I am not trying to be mean when I say the rest. I have had some good experiences with her (which maybe no one else can say).<br><br>I don&#39;t like saying this, because I never had the guts to say it to her, bluntly, in chat (and I should have), but I really feel like she does not get the basic levels of the PPC. Aside from the reasons everyone else has mentioned (which are good reasons. Asking for Permission right after the sort of debacle that is the last thread is Not Cool.) I don&#39;t think she <i>gets</i> what is bad fic and what is not. <br><br>Several times she has linked fics that I <i>think</i> she was saying she wanted to spork (that confusing way of saying things comes up in IRC at times, too) that were good fics. Excellent writing, good plot, according to her (because I don&#39;t know the continuum) good characterization. The only thing against it was that it was AU (a good one, but AU), or  it was a shipfic, or there was the transdimensional jump (which was handled way too well to spork. That was the only charge). I don&#39;t think there was any understanding achieved between the two of us when I said that not all AUs are automatically badfic, and not all shipfics are automatically AU.<br><br>So aside from everything else, if a person can&#39;t understand the difference between badfic and goodfic and that not all of an entire class of fics are automatically bad then I really wouldn&#39;t want them to have Permission. I think that goes deeper than any other <i>writing</i>* issue that&#39;s been brought up. <br><br>*I&#39;ve got nothing of substance to add on the other issues, they&#39;ve been covered very well, and I agree with what has been said. I agree that at this point that at least a voluntary separation for a time would be best. </p>

            <p>Replies to everyone are mixed up in here by subject, apologies if I miss one.<br><br>First off, yes, it seems to be people reading things incorrectly.  I also feel that with all that screaming about &quot;you&#39;re ignoring the point&quot; you were also ignoring my points.  Some of them points that I&#39;ve been making for awhile.  More about that in a fresh reply below.<br><br><br>As far as putting in another permission request.  This is me trying to soothe tempers by actually trying to work with you.  I refuse to lose ideas or let rewrites fester in the meantime.  Either give me permission or ignore that detail.  All I ask is no one jump down my throat when I ask for betas and I&#39;ll shut up about it until December or longer.  (I&#39;m working with a beta now and it&#39;s really helping.)  Also more about that in the fresh reply.<br><br><br>About not replying to the direct request, it was because I already answered it two hours and eight hour previous.  I had shown I got it, no need to ask more questions.  <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=262566"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=262566">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=262566</a></a>  <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=262445;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=262445;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=262445;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board</a></a><br><br><br>I wasn&#39;t making non-sequiters, so therefore I had to assume that non-sequiter had another meaning.  And I wasn&#39;t trying to insult Des or anyone else.  I apologize for things that did look like insults.<br><br>***<br><br>Should I not apologize for having that attitude in the first place?  I promise to work on it, and shutting up about it now.<br><br><br>I delayed my apology to think about it, hence people making multiple demands.  I&#39;m sorry for that too.<br><br>*** <br><br>I did research about Jews and lapsed Jews, I simply cannot find all of the pages anymore.  There were many different interpretations of what people do and do not hold onto and Kim is an amalgam of that.  (Still celebrating holidays but in shortened form, some things about keeping Kosher in the home but eating bacon in restaurants, even some rabbinical laws.)  I suppose I could drop most of that from her character.<br><br><br>Doctorlit got it right.  &quot;Socially necessary hatred of Nazis&quot; is having the passion to remember what they did and work towards it not happening again, (as opposed to just not caring or letting the memory fade,) up to hating the laws that prevent taking certain measures.  Kim&#39;s hatred is to the point where she wants to go beyond simple illegality and into disproportionate retribution.  The safest way to express this is that she can convince a Flower that sending her into &quot;Der Jude That Got Away&quot; would result in completely the wrong sort of paperwork.  (In contrast to the Paddlebrains mission with eunich!Snape and Remus and she got neuralyzed afterward.)  I can remove that from her profile to give her the assumed measure of hatred.</p>

            <p>I may be somewhat new to this community, but everything you&#39;ve done so far defies all logic. You break some rules, the community calls you on it, you apologize... And then proceed to do the very thing they called you out for? That&#39;s not how you cool tensions, that&#39;s how you ignite them further. I don&#39;t have a problem with you as a person, but the way you are presenting yourself within the community serves only to cause conflict. If you can&#39;t handle the guidelines set by the PPC, then don&#39;t be a part of it.</p>

            <p>Dimensia, if someone says you insulted them, you don&#39;t say &quot;but... [insert arguments here], therefore I did not insult you.&quot; You apologise. That&#39;s basic politeness. When <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=262480;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">I told you you insulted me <i>and why</i></a>, you replied with <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=262489;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">arguments and sarcasm</a>. That&#39;s not how you behave in decent society. In fact, IRL, such things mean shouting and thumping the table because that&#39;s demeaning and disgusting.<br>Also - you obviously have a very different idea of what should follow what, logically, than the rest of the world (and coming from me, that means something - I&#39;m the guy with the Stoic-Cartesian-sceptic philosophy). You also ignored <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=262508;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Ozzielot&#39;s explanation</a>. This means that you&#39;re either malicious or that you simply can&#39;t get what&#39;s going on.<br>As to the Nazi comment... hating the Nazis is not some &#39;social necessity&#39;. It&#39;s something much, much more than that - FYI, I lost family members to those scum and my grandparents nearly died in the Holocaust. I don&#39;t hate the Nazis because it&#39;s &#39;socially necessary&#39;, I hate them because they were ...ing genocidal dickheads that tried - and succeeded to a certain degree - to kill every single member of my nation. Again, this comment either shows ignorance - massive ignorance - or malice that is outright evil and quite possibly illegal.<br><br>Your apology... I don&#39;t think it&#39;s sincere. <br><br>Get outta here. My personal opinion is that you shouldn&#39;t be here. Go away. Shoo. Kishta.</p>

            <p>As other people have said before, zdimensia&#39;s apology was not only extracted with the maximum amount of difficulty but lacks any sort of indication that she is willing to change. That idea was only enforced for me when I saw this most recent request for permission. To ask now? After everything that just occurred? With no time taken for heads to cool or for self-introspection? Seriously?<br><br>That right there is indicative of the kind of kind of disrespect and self-centeredness she has demonstrated that concerns me to no end. She has repeatedly and directly insulted several PPC members (and indirectly insulted pretty much all of us) and implied that the legitimate complaints levied against her are just some sort of hazing ritual. Her posts try to paint her as a victim, bullied and mistreated by we unkind denizens of the Board.<br><br>I wish I had spoken up about this earlier. I SHOULD have spoken up about this earlier. I&#39;m vaguely ashamed that it took me this long. But I&#39;m speaking now, and I say that zdimensia has no place in this community. I support a ban.</p>

            <p>An apology is nothing without a serious commitment to change behind it. To use an expression from <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i>, words are wind. I&#39;ve seen the words &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; but I&#39;ve seen no evidence that zdimensia is actually committed to backing up those words with an effort to improve her attitudes and behavior.<br><br>Like everyone so far, I&#39;m amazed that she&#39;s asking for Permission again at this time. To me, on top of everything that happened down-Board, it seems to show a worrying lack of situational awareness at the very least. At worst, it shows a complete disregard for anything but getting what she wants, which, in my mind, would violate the spirit of the Constitution.<br><br>I am not willing to share the fictional PPC universe with zdimensia at this time. I&#39;m also extremely tired of being personally and &quot;professionally&quot; (? is &quot;PG&quot; a profession?) disrespected and ignored. While I don&#39;t like resorting to banning, I feel strongly that any sort of probation won&#39;t work, since she&#39;s shown herself perfectly willing to ignore the rules and do what she wants anyway and hasn&#39;t expressed any intent to change. So, to prevent any further disruptions to normal Board activities, I think it&#39;s time for zdimensia to leave. Preferably of her own free will and temporarily, as a sign of contrition and until she can get to a more stable place in her life, but with actual banning if necessary.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t say if she behaved in the wrong way since the apology because... well, this request was one of the first things she posted after the apology.<br><br>The fact that she went straight for Permission again, for which the community&#39;s trust is a requirement, after we made clear that she has to rebuild that trust first is kinda jarring to me.

I haven&#39;t actually stated this up until now, out of politeness, but more and more, it feels like zdimensia only sees this community as the means to her desired end of writing missions.  The speed at which she moved from being reprimanded to attempting permission again demonstrates this.  It also continues the trend of demanding information that helps her compose stories, and brushing off everything else, including our feelings and the overall well-being of the community.<br><br>So . . . I do feel that granting permission now would be inappropriate.  I would want to see changed behavior from zdimensia over a <i>long</i> period of time before permission should even be considered.</p>

            <p>ZD, please don&#39;t take this the wrong way when I say I think you shouldn&#39;t have asked for Permission. I&#39;m not saying that you never should, but considering what happened recently, now is really not the best time. <br><br>Take some time off to organize your thoughts, make a better apology, and then, when things have calmed down, try again. Maybe there was a big misunderstanding where someone read something incorrectly and the whole thing spiraled out of control.<br><br>But you really hurt a lot of people recently, and asking Permission makes you seem (even more so) extremely rude and inconsiderate. It&#39;s be like if I came to your house, insulted you and the food you worked hard to make, declared your house a crime against interior decoration, and then asked to live there. <br><br>Please, take some time off and think about how you&#39;ve affected everyone before asking Permission.</p>

            <p>Huinesoron is right, the way it&#39;s phrased makes it feel like zDimensia is trying to (badly) hide a pro-Nazi statement in there by saying that hating Nazis is some sort of social necessity.<br><br>Another oddity I see is that she is basically described as &quot;more Jewish than most Jews,&quot; yet is described as less adherent to Jewish religious practices, implying that &quot;more Jewish&quot; is measuring something other than religion. (Then again, it could be another <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=262361;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">&quot;huge confusion.&quot;</a><br><br>That brings me to my next point- she&#39;s confusing. Whether it&#39;s the non sequiturs, the contradictory statements, or just odd things like &quot;a huge confusion&quot; in the post I linked to, I can&#39;t make heads or tails of many of her posts. We may be reading too deep into what she&#39;s saying- it may be just an innocent miswording (on the &quot;socially necessary&quot; bit, she may have just meant &#39;usual&#39;) or contradiction (the Jew less/more bit) we&#39;re tripping up on. (Heck, I myself am guilty of the &quot;oddly colored&quot; trip-up.)<br><br>I haven&#39;t seen more from her (besides that one post) since her apology that involves breaking PPC Constitution or unwritten standards, but that might just be because it wasn&#39;t that long of a time period.<br><br>Personally, I&#39;m willing to give her some more time to prove herself. Then again, I&#39;m a relatively new face around here, so I&#39;m probably not a good judge of this.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a big fan of the SCP Foundation, and they seem to be pretty good at weeding out SCPs and tales they find aren&#39;t up to scruff. On top of that, posting in the SCP Foundation wiki requires something very similar to a Permission request, so they&#39;re pretty well-guarded against badfic inside the site.<br><br>But the big problem is SCP fics and crossovers in places like the Pit of Voles, the Circle of Lemmings, and the Pony Pit. There, it&#39;s not under the umbrella of official SCP fics and becomes fanfiction- but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s sporkable by the Protectors of the Plot Continuum.<br><br>Why?<br><br><a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/canon-hub">This.</a><br><br>The SCP Foundation&#39;s &quot;canon&quot; isn&#39;t a canon at all- it&#39;s essentially a group of headcanons that freely contradict each other.<br><br>How would an SCP Foundation fic or crossover be handled, then? I mention crossovers because you still have to protect, say, the MLP-verse if SCP is crossed over with it, so we can&#39;t just leave the entire thing alone.</p>

            <p>...at the request of a non-PPC friend who wanted to know how many people had Permission. I was sure there would be a list, but there isn&#39;t- or at least, not one I could find. Is there one? And if not, would it be possible to put one together?</p>

            <p>And making one would be almost impossible, I&#39;m afraid. Consider this:<br><br>- Every mission has been written by someone with Permission, but the Wiki doesn&#39;t have informations about all spinoffs (some ended up becoming lost, and a lot of spinoffs end up lasting just two-three missions).<br>- Not everyone with Permission is still on the Board.<br>- Not everyone with Permission has already posted his/her missions. In fact, it&#39;s even possible that someone got permission but lost touch with us before actually writing anything.<br><br>Making even just a partial list would be a nightmare, and we would still have few indications to say how much of a partial list it is.<br><br></p>

            <p>The granting of Permission, in one form or another, goes back to the days of Jay and Acacia. The archives simply aren&#39;t comprehensive enough. And since we neither expire Permission, or demand that people inform us when they&#39;re leaving for good...<br><br>What I <i>can</i> give you is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nzmYkocbdqIUA27LupfDUk9v9wMMeUkiqUMEXNYjoP8/edit?usp=sharing">Permission request statistics</a>, from April 2010 to May 2014. 82 people were given Permission in that time. You can do a &#39;simple&#39; extrapolation back to the founding of the Board in 2003, and get a total of ~220 people with Permission. Or, tomorrow, I can do a more complex comparison of posts/year to Permission/year.<br><br>Or, you can approximate that every person who writes for the PPC has three agents (ie, most have a single pair, but a few with heaps of them skew the maths), and do a quick estimate from the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:PPC_Agents">PPC Agents category</a>: it contains 677 pages, and its largest sub-cat contains 330. That suggests there are about a thousand named agents in the PPC, which approximates ~350 writers. And since at some point I did a random sampling (can&#39;t find it now) which showed that only half of people with Permission actually use it... around 700.<br><br>Which is sort of why we can&#39;t have a list. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... Okay, my knee-jerk response was &quot;Oh LORD no, that&#39;s way too many people over way too many years, lol!&quot;<br><br>On the other hand, I have been pondering the creation of a Glossary of PPC Members to go with the Glossary of PPC Characters for a while now. It may not be possible to find the names of all the old members, but we do have some good resources at our disposal: the old <a href="http://archive.today/HV5G2">PPC Directory</a> is one, and July&#39;s old censuses are another, and the <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/BoardArchive.htm">Board Archives</a> are a third, not to mention the wiki itself and the tireless sleuthing of people like me, doctorlit, and hS.<br><br>So, it would be a huge list, and it might never be perfect, but it&#39;s probably doable. For what should go on it, I&#39;d suggest something like:<br><br>Board name - male/female/else - birthday - also known as - approximate time joined/active - Permission Y/N - names of main agents known for (if any) - website link(s)<br><br>What do you (plural) think?<br><br>~Neshomeh, Lover of Lists</p>

            <p>There are 1551 names in the Board archives. Now, granted, some of those are probably typos - though I&#39;ve tried to catch most of those - some of them are certainly single-use names (such as Badfic Game names), and one is &#39;Anonymous&#39;... but that still means around one and a half thousand names.

            <p>What can I say, I like lists. I finally figured out the best way to get myself to do anything is make a checklist for it, and then the irritation of unchecked boxes will overcome any reticence I might have about the work involved or all the other things I could be doing with my time. This is why I like the wiki so much—everything comes in neatly organized units of pages and categories, so it&#39;s really easy to set a project and work through it one item at a time.<br><br>Also, the volume of names doesn&#39;t bother me. I dunno how many agents are in the Glossary of PPC Characters, but it&#39;s LOTS. It can be done, because it <i>has</i> been done.<br><br>However, I&#39;m not THAT crazy. A list that doesn&#39;t tell us anything useful would be stupid, so I&#39;d focus on names that people might actually want to look up—people who&#39;ve done stuff and made a mark one way or another. Basically, I&#39;d start with authors in the Glossary of Characters and add on from there.<br><br>That is assuming I actually start this at all, and other things have priority at the moment and probably will for the foreseeable future.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First off, I&#39;m sorry that I did not know how to make a proper apology.  Someone actually brought this to my attention.  I also needed to be walked through the process step-by-step, and I&#39;m sorry that I had to have help.  I&#39;m sorry for needing it brought to my attention when I do need to make an apology.  I&#39;m not sure how to fix this, but I will try.  I&#39;m sorry for not realizing that sometimes an apology is needed for things that are not deliberate, and that I shouldn&#39;t argue lack of insult when someone says they feel offended.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry for failing so much at being coherent and for accidentally looking like a troll.  I&#39;m not sure how to fix this because I already do re-read the post before hitting send.  I&#39;m sorry for having such odd logic.  I&#39;m also sorry about the way some of my posts sound.  In my mind, being indirect is the polite way.  Someone had to sit down and explain that it was the opposite.  I&#39;ll try to find a way to practice the proper way.  I&#39;m sorry for reacting negatively when I perceive someone jumping down my throat about a problem I don&#39;t see.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry for not being able to make it clear when I actually do listen.  I finally get it that when I can&#39;t find information by researching, it means that no one knows.  I don&#39;t always need someone else to tell me the answer.  I&#39;m sorry for misinterpreting people&#39;s annoyance about the amount of questions as aggression about why I was asking them.  When I don&#39;t listen, I am just acting on frustration when I feel that no one is listening to me.  I&#39;m sorry for treating others the way I perceive them treating me, and for lashing out when I get frustrated.  I&#39;ve also learned that not pointing out the cause of frustrations is not good.  I&#39;m sorry for being wrong about that.  I know now that I should point out when someone is not listening or understanding me.  I try to feel respect for other people even as I perceive a lack of respect in return, and I&#39;m really sorry that I can&#39;t manage to do that one hundred percent of the time.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry I got frustrated with the permission requests.  I&#39;ve said many times that the process was confusing, but never directly asked for the information to be made clearer.  I&#39;m also sorry about getting over-eager about writing.  I am also sorry for the backwards process I needed to take, where I couldn&#39;t write a good request without first writing them into stories.  The side-by-side comparison shows that it is the case.  <br><br>I&#39;m sorry for writing without permission.  I assure you that my intent was that they would not be shown to outsiders until I got permission.  I cannot promise to stop writing them, but they will stay hidden on the hard-drive, and I can stop talking about the stories.  I felt that I had to admit it because being circuitous about it when asking questions didn&#39;t really get an answer.  I&#39;m sorry for being so blatant after people knew.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry about putting in a fresh permission request.  One point that I feel no one is listening to me about is that it is frustrating to not write stories when I think about them, and that if I did hold them inside it would clog my entire creative capability.  Since everyone is so angry about me writing anyway, I felt that I should give an opportunity to take away that source of friction.  I hope that shutting up about writing will be enough.<br><br>I really wish that some things had been brought to my attention sooner, and that the things that were frustrating me were addressed.  I want to work hard to put these problems in the past.</p>

            <p>I was already in the mode of not speaking about it anymore, but you&#39;re right.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry that I let something irrational get a hold of me, something that I wasn&#39;t understand, and then I let the both the them-hatred resulting self-hatred get bad enough to manifest as something truly ugly.  After having a calm conversation about it, I realize that this problem has an unexpected shape.  It will take longer than a day to self-reflect and address most of specifics, and I&#39;m sorry that I cannot list every facet of my crime right away.  There is a lot of thoughts and attitudes that I need to get rid of, and I&#39;ll find help if I can&#39;t do it on my own.<br><br>There is one thing that I&#39;ve learned is wrong and I need to stop right now.  It&#39;s called cultural appropriation.  I&#39;m sorry I felt that it was okay for a character to have traits without the context.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry for using unfortunate shorthand about Nazi attitudes.  My understanding of the issues is oversimplified, and I need to work on that as well.</p>

            <p>This is a very passive-aggressive &#39;apology.&#39;  Stop apologizing for things that aren&#39;t really a problem (&quot; I&#39;m sorry for treating others the way I perceive them treating me&quot;) and try apologizing for the things that people are actually upset about (&quot;I&#39;m sorry for being rude and offensive&quot;).  Also, please stop trying to blame other people for this situation (&quot;I really wish that some things had been brought to my attention sooner, and that the things that were frustrating me were addressed&quot;).  Everyone has made their grievances with you quite clear.<br><br><i>One point that I feel no one is listening to me about is that it is frustrating to not write stories when I think about them, and that if I did hold them inside it would clog my entire creative capability.</i><br>In my opinion, this statement is inaccurate.  I&#39;m not speaking for anyone else here, but I have heard you say this before.  I just haven&#39;t concerned myself with it.  The PPC does not exist solely to facilitate you.  If not being able to write PPC missions is clogging your creativity somehow, then that&#39;s your problem, not ours.  We don&#39;t have to bend over backwards and violate our own rules in order to satisfy one person.</p>

            <p>At this point it&#39;s far too late. You did not need another thread to apologize in. <br><br>You&#39;re still also coming to the wrong conclusions- everything you&#39;ve asked has answers that are findable. It doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t know.<br><br>Please stop and take your lumps. </p>
