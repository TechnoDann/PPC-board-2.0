            <p>A few weeks ago, I offered my aid to a boarder who was pleading for help with his/her writing. I did the best I could to give them aid, and moved on. This last week, I came across this list of storytelling hints, apparently originally tweeted by a Pixar story artist. They seem to be wonderful advice, so I am now sharing them with my fellow boarders.<br><br>You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.<br><br>You gotta keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an audience, not what’s fun to do as a writer. They can be very different.<br><br>Once upon a time there was<strong><em>. Every day,</em></strong>. One day<strong><em>. Because of that,</em></strong>. Because of that,<strong><em>. Until finally</em></strong>.<br><br>Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.<br><br>What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?<br><br>Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.<br><br>Finish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.<br><br>When you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next.<br><br>Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.<br><br>Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.<br><br>Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th – get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.<br><br>Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience.<br><br>Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it.<br><br>If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.<br><br>What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed? Stack the odds against.<br><br>No work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, let go and move on – it’ll come back around to be useful later.<br><br>You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best &amp; fussing. Story is testing, not refining.<br><br>Coincidences that get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.<br><br>Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d’you rearrange them into what you DO like?<br><br>You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can’t just write ‘cool’. What would make YOU act that way?<br><br>I hope you find these rules as interesting as I do, and possibly helpful as well.<br><br>As a postscript, my younger brother recently started pestering me about getting Permission. However, although I know what I want to do with my agents, I haven&#39;t gotten around to writing anything featuring them yet, which I should probably do in the near future, shouldn&#39;t I?</p>

            <p>Re. Permission, if you&#39;re thinking of putting together a request, make sure to use the new prompts system detailed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IE81HONRJnp0IaK92GvzyL00CZYNZG_pvdo93gRMIhY/pub">here</a> (scroll down past the orange stuff). It&#39;s not fully implemented yet, but the more we see it in action, the more we can refine it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You&#39;re talking about the six Rose Potter stories, which are classed as Legendary Badfic -- My Inner Life, which is LB and ridiculously long -- and multiple works by someone else. At minimum, that&#39;s nine stories, of which seven are LBs.<br><br>How long do you think it&#39;ll take you to write those? According to the Claimed Badfic list, &#39;be aware that very old claims (generally 18+ months) may be bumped back to the Unclaimed Badfic page&#39;. I... find it difficult to believe anyone could kill <i>My Inner Life</i> in a year and a half, let alone it plus the entirety of <i>Rose Potter</i> (which I believe has already been tried and failed, though I may be wrong), plus whatever else.<br><br>Glancing over the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic?action=history">history of the Claimed list</a> kind of supports this. As I write, the first 50 edits include a total of <i>six</i> removing information - and one of those is Neshomeh doing some cleanup. So only 5 badfics have been actually killed for 25 claimed in the same period. <i>Eighty percent</i> of fics claimed are not being killed.<br><br>But despite all that - no, there is no problem with you doing that. However, <i>also</i> despite all that, I would advise against trying to start off with Legendary Badfics. Take a look at <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Agents.htm">Dafydd&#39;s &#39;Tales from DOGA&#39;</a> here; I eventually took on two LBs, yes, but after <i>eleven</i> other missions - and C<em>l</em>br__n was the last fic Dafydd ever took on. They&#39;re a big deal in-universe, and they&#39;re also a royal pain to write about.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That sounds an awful lot like Neshomeh&#39;s attempted mission to the hermaphrodite-Snape fic &quot;Subjugation&quot;. She, Tungsten Monk,    and two other people stored a copy of the fic before it was purged from the Internet, and sent their agents into it. The mission was never finished, and the other two people never got around to writing anything else for the PPC. It was in-universe established at some point that Supernumerary came back alone, with everyone else MIA, though Tungsten Monk&#39;s agents were later determined to have been hiding in World of Warcraft until the All-Purpose Department stumbled on them by chance years later.</p>

            <p>In 2006, someone (I don&#39;t remember who) reported &quot;Subjugation&quot; to the Board. Everyone was duly horrified. It was decided that it must be sporked, but it was too much for one person, so Gundamkiwi, Tungsten Monk, Rez, and nscangal stepped up, each volunteering to spork six of its twenty-four chapters. Kiwi took the lead and wrote the prologue, where the eight agents were recruited. I got involved when nscangal bowed out, or disappeared, or something; anyway, I took her place. Tungsten Monk took the first six chapters, but she only got through chapter two, which ends on the lovely note of Dumbledore declaring &quot;I have not yet begun to debauch!&quot; as he&#39;s about to forcibly consummate his marriage to Snape. Sadly, it never got any further writing-wise.<br><br>Eventually, due to people having lives, I was pretty much the only one still active on the Board. Much of the current backstory regarding &quot;Subjugation&quot; was created when I moved to Chicago in 2009 and started talking more with Tungsten, who also lived in the area then. It was already my headcanon that Nume was the only survivor of the mission, and Tungsten got on board with that. We decided we liked the idea of taking another crack at it, and that was when I discovered the fic had vanished from the Internet and had to dredge up a copy from the Wayback Machine. We brought Suicide and Diocletian back in &quot;The Dark Side,&quot; which was a co-mission between the APD and the DIC, and they made their first reappearance as agents in &quot;Ring Child.&quot;<br><br>Rez actually made a surprise comeback in 2011, posting two new missions with her agents, and she got on board with the backstory, too. Sadly, she faded out again.<br><br>And here we are now.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As far as LJ goes, I mean. The Wayback Machine archives a fair bunch of pages, as does <a href="http://archive.today/%5C*.livejournal.com">Archive Today</a>. If you look in the 2004 <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/BoardArchive.htm">Board Archives</a>, you&#39;ll find the Wayback link to the very first list of Boarder ships, which was quite a find.<br><br>However, as far as I can tell, neither Wayback&#39;s ~300,000 entries or AT&#39;s far more modest ~60,000 include either agents-shae-jo, or dcps_lotr. AT has a few still-extant Agent LJs (Talia and Quen, for instance), but I can&#39;t spot anything &#39;lost&#39;.<br><br>Still, it&#39;s worth checking.

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have that kind of hard drive space at the moment, and also that would be a whole lot of work for just one person. I&#39;m betting I could count on your help, though, and I know Calista saved a bunch of stuff and transferred it <i>to</i> LJ, so maybe she&#39;d enlist.

            <p>Well, I did just find a post by Sara that&#39;s to do with the ban on Emergencies and general unrest with agent power creep that was happening at the time. It&#39;s linked from the Emergency page on the wiki. That 2008-2009 period may be pretty rich.<br><br>One thing I&#39;d love to have more info about is the 2003 Mary Sue Invasion. I think Techno-Dann&#39;s backstory and the A/V Department stories touch on it, but that&#39;s almost pure speculation on my part.<br><br>The Thalia Weaver thing, you mentioned before... Oh, what about Red Wolf the Weird? I&#39;ve heard of them (obviously), but what actually happened? What was so weird about them?<br><br>There was that whole sockpuppetry drama involving Union Jack and... I forget the other one. It was relatively recent, though. Tungsten Monk wrote her Dissertation on a Troll around then, if I recall correctly. Though I&#39;m not sure that journal is still around. I found her &quot;Know Your Sue!&quot; series deleted recently. {= (<br><br>That&#39;s probably enough to go on for now (and I can&#39;t think of anything else). Good luck!<br><br>Meanwhile, I&#39;ll start going through Miss Cam&#39;s PPC list. I&#39;ll try to shoot for saving at least one spin-off a week. That should allow good progress without bogging me down. And I am getting a new laptop soon if all goes according to plan, so I could devote this one purely to storage.<br><br>... I have no idea how to translate this quest into Plortian terms. Some kind of archaeological crusade? Maybe I should invest in a leather coat, a fedora, and a bull whip. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Just be warned, it&#39;s Conversion Bureau, pony supremacist.<br><br>The basic premise is that Equestria shows up on earth one day, surrounded by a barrier that will destroy all of human civilization eventually, and magic is poisonous to humans, who must transform into ponies to survive. This could be explored well to create a beautifully deep story about change and the sadistic choice between dying and changing, and what would happen to human culture.<br><br>Usually, it boils down to genocide by assimilation, with the serum that works the transformation fundamentally changing your nature, and the ponies distributing it being the good guys, and humans either being evil brutes or tripping all over themselves to become ponies.<br><br>Authors who do it this way seem to fail to understand exactly how creepy this is, and wish for the situation described in the story to happen in real life.<br><br>The original story wasn&#39;t so bad, just poorly written, and originally supposed to be garden-variety wish fulfillment, in the same vein as most HiE suefics. The author considers the story an old shame.</p>

            <p>I mean, I get why people write those stories, but they just... suck at it. If you want an example of the concept being done <i>right</i>, on the other hand, you could do a lot worse than <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal">Friendship Is Optimal</a>. The story has a really disquieting tone that reminded me of that one bit from Fallout 3 with the little corner of suburban small-town America. If you&#39;ve played that game, you know where I mean. Creeping-dread horror: it&#39;s what&#39;s for dinner!<br><br>Also, that&#39;d be an amazing whole-Board event; dredging up every available, interested agent and sending them to clean up the Conversion Bureau. It&#39;d be like herding cats, but the end result might just be brilliant.</p>

            <p>That... would be the most epic thing in the history of epic. I was planning on doing it one at a time, but it would be cool if we could coordinate the board and dredge up the TCB badfics, and then do them all at once in a massive crossover in which Xenolestia is exorcised from everywhere, which ends in the Elements of Harmony cleansing Equestria of the Sue taint and then fades out on the note of the agents planning to neuralyze the canon characters... after they go to the gigantic party that Pinkie Pie set up.<br><br>I was also thinking that the Elements of Harmony would be a very good thing for most agents in the bad-insanity department. It&#39;s made of weaponized good feelings, friendship, and, well, harmony. If it can cleanse Equestria after Discord, then it can be very good for the agents&#39; mental health.</p>

            <p>Hey now, to be fair, there is the occasional story that actually explores the CB and what it means for both Earth and Equestria. Every once in a while, there is a CB story that is actually rather interesting, and not too bad of a read.<br><br>That said, yeah, it usually boils down to wish fulfillment. Though, I feel the need to mention the other side of the coin: the Anti-Conversion Bureau, the side that <i>hates</i> the CB and what it&#39;s usual fans think of humanity. These stories typically show the ponies as nothing short of monsters, lead by Tyrant!Celestia in a war against all of humanity. The humans then roll in, kick some flank, and then roll out, proving that the Equestrian&#39;s fears were absolutely right. How ironic. Thee stories are usually just as bad, just praising humans instead of ponies. Ugh.<br><br>Wait, what? The original was not that bad? Dude, that fic sucked. I mean, nothing against the author, he&#39;s actually a pretty cool guy who can write well enough now, but the original Conversion Bureau was awful. I mean, not like Cupcakes level awful, but still pretty bad. <br><br>Actually, if you were not planning on taking the original, I was thinking I may do something with it. I mean, I have My Little Unicorn ahead of me already, so it&#39;s not like I need another infamous badfic, but I&#39;ve been thinking of some things I could do with it. But, if you were planning on taking it on, by all means, have at it.</p>

            <p>The problem with &quot;Subjugation&quot; is that it&#39;s long, most of the charges are purely to do with characterization, and the content is so horrifying that it makes finding any humor in it incredibly difficult. Mechanically, it&#39;s actually pretty well written, and it&#39;s not like the author doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s doing. She even admits, in an author&#39;s note, to being disturbed at having written one of the more violent scenes. Not that that&#39;s an excuse. It&#39;s not a story that has any business involving <i>Harry Potter</i> characters, period.<br><br>And, just a reminder, it&#39;s <i>mine forever</i>. I have <i>plans</i>. But plans which necessitate lots of other things happening first. I&#39;d like to kill it before I&#39;m 30, but given my track record and the fact that I&#39;m turning 29 this June... we&#39;ll see. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>This reminds me, I ought to make time to go through the Claimed and Unclaimed lists and clean out anything that&#39;s been malingering. I&#39;ll make sure to give people an advanced warning or two before I do so they can renew any old claims, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... that long fics take time to tackle. As an example, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966278/1/TSAB-DOWNFALL-Halo-War">TSAB DOWNFALL: Halo War</a> is a little more than 34k words and is a bona fide bleepfic. Its mission is about 30k words long and it took three people about two months to write it.<br>Rose Potter&#39;s first book (not the whole series) clocks at an estimated 100k words. That&#39;s... a bit too much for one author to handle. Even if it weren&#39;t LB, and it is.</p>

            <p>A lot of people do that, of course, but killing fics before their designated end has always been a thing, so if you get a missionable badfic and find yourself looking at it and going &quot;there&#39;s way too much fic here,&quot; it&#39;s just a matter of finding a point in the text where you can kill it off. After that it&#39;s all up to how the story of doing the mission is written, not necessarily how long the agents allowed it to go on.</p>

            <p>Hey, everyone&#39;s got his own RL issues, right? To be sincere, I&#39;m actually behind schedule with both Blank Sprite and IrregularS due to IRL issues (mostly bad health and bad mood due to having had an idiotic argument with some friends, but I&#39;ve been quite busy too)<br><br>Anyways, the reason is pretty simple: my &quot;usual&quot; beta readers are having quite a busy time so I&#39;m asking for some more help to lift some load off their shoulders.</p>

Okay, now take a Shakespeare play and figure out how a PPC adaptation would go down. Would Romeo and Juliet be exorcised by Agents from the Department of Bad Het? Would Hamlet be played by agents from the Department of Angst? Would Nume and Jenni be a shoe-in for Benedick and Beatrice? <br><br>Go forth and celebrate the Bard&#39;s birthday! <br><br>Oh, and also, because Dawn in that linked thread asked for Jules Caesar and I&#39;ve been on a JC binge:<br><br>&quot;Why should Sue-sar get to rule over everything in the multiverse like some sort of gigantic sparkling Kaiju while the rest of us have to avoid the hell out of her or risk getting trampled by her anatomically-incorrect feet? What do the people see in Sue-sar anyway? She&#39;s a mad tyrant with no regard for the canon. Heck, you could take her place and you&#39;d actually be of some use to the plot. I mean, not like you should do that, but still. You&#39;re just as good-looking, and you&#39;re definitely smarter. We&#39;ve gotta take control of our destinies, Agent Brutus; it&#39;s not up to the Narrative Laws of Comedy to decide our fate. Sue-sar&#39;s presence in the canon has lasted long enough. We should totally just stab Sue-sar.&quot;</p>

Not Benedict, but... Benedick?&quot;<br><br>The Fisherman looked at her with a slightly confused expression, like a dog with a stick wider than a doorway. &quot;Uh, yes, Morgan, we&#39;ve established that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who names their kid <i>Benedick</i>? What sadist does that to a defenceless child? What kind of monster takes a word that literally means penis and smashes it together with Benedict, which is the <i>worst name</i>, and goes &#39;Yeah, I&#39;mma call my kid dat, ain&#39;t no way this&#39;ll ever impact his education or future prospects&#39;?&quot;<br><br>The Notary had been edging slowly away from Morgan for the entire outburst. &quot;Tigereye Castellan, are you quite well?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I mean, what&#39;s wrong with, with, Iunno, Steve or Brian or whatever? Omega&#39;s buck teeth, <i>Benedick</i>? That boy couldn&#39;t have had a worse time at school if he&#39;d been called Englebert Dum-Dum McStinkyface. What were they <i>thinking</i>?

            <p>Ah yes, the BBC&#39;s &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;.  One of my favourite Shakespeare adaptations.  TV doesn&#39;t need fancy gimmicks like special effects or even colour to tell a good story.<br><br>I was lucky enough to see some of the episodes when they were screened at London&#39;s National Film Theatre, 20 years ago.  (I could only get tickets for the Henrys, the Richards all sold out straight away.)<br><br>BTW since you&#39;re a Doctor Who fan, check out the Ian McKellan 1978 version of the Scottish Play, produced by Verity Lambert.  Again, done in a minimalist style.<br><br></p>

            <p>We appear to be talking about two different versions. I meant the more recent edition that covered the Henriad, in which Ben Whishaw played Richard II with the kind of skill that beggars belief. I also really liked it as a TV adaptation because it didn&#39;t look like someone had stuck some cameras in front of a stage play, for want of a better term; rather, it used the things you can do with the medium to augment the play.<br><br>Take Sir Patrick Stewart&#39;s rendition of John of Gaunt&#39;s monologue. Usually, it&#39;s done in this big, projected, very Shakespearean-actor voice (man, I am on fire with finding names for things today; clearly I&#39;ve been learning from Buffy Summers), whereas in the 2012 Hollow Crown it was very sombre, very quiet. You can do that with television because you can do close-up shots and boost the sound and make sure people hear the words, thus allowing the actors and director more room to breathe. That&#39;s how you do an adaptation. To me at least. YMMV. =]<br><br>Also, there&#39;s a new series of it coming out later this year concerning the Bard&#39;s first historical tetralogy, and Benadryl Cymbalclash (LOLOLOLOL I MADE FUN OF SOMEONE&#39;S NAME AM I INTERNET FUNNY YET) is to play Richard. I&#39;m really looking forward to it.</p>

            <p>I love it when creators make small little nods to the fandom, even when it&#39;s negative. Now, to be fair, Skye is not a Sue, not by any means, but it&#39;s still funny. Oh, and don&#39;t worry, this has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.

            <p>Hi there Boarders, I&#39;ve got a small proposition for you!  In my intro post, I mentioned a story I and a few others were working on, but as said post is older now, I figured why not get it right here at the top of the board?  What I am talking about is To Come Together, or TCT, and Fallout: Lonesome Hearts, or F:LH.  I will be referring to them by these acronyms from now on.  I&#39;m head editor, and fairly high up on the Moderator scale as well.  TCT is a fantasy/adventure story that anyone can contribute to.  All it takes is to click on the link, read the rules and regs, and know what you are doing.  Also a google account, but I&#39;m fairly sure everyone should have one of those.  F:LH is much the same, but set in the fallout universe instead.  It&#39;s more a fanfic, hopefully not a badfic, hahaha.  If you would like, have a go at them, feel free to edit, within the regs of course, and overall have a good time.  <br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNZ9KSZQfdT8mecViFrIIhTpLIX56F8zciVBrBwYd2Q/edit"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNZ9KSZQfdT8mecViFrIIhTpLIX56F8zciVBrBwYd2Q/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNZ9KSZQfdT8mecViFrIIhTpLIX56F8zciVBrBwYd2Q/edit</a></a><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m looking for some general or shipping fics for Marvel. I&#39;m hoping to find something that&#39;s been set in the main marvel universe, or from a cartoon canon.

            <p>For pairings I like... I&#39;d say that I like almost anything. I really like the X-men and the various pairings that go with them, but the Avengers are also awesome. My favorite pairings have combined these teams (Scarlet Witch/Nightcrawler, Black Panther/Storm.) I&#39;m also a fan of pairings that have married in canon (Wasp/Yellowjacket, Thor/Siff)<br><br>But if your trying to narrow it down I can help you. I just recently watched Linkara&#39;s review of the comic book Ultimatum, so if you could something that centered around the characters who died in that event I would thank you.<br><br>I&#39;m also a fan of Heroes for Hire. </p>

            <p>...would be to go through the pairing tag on AO3 (archiveofourown.org). There tends to be pretty good fic there, and a lot of good Marvel fic, too (at least, from what I&#39;ve seen). As with most archives, there are some bad fics (and even badfics!) there, too, but the majority tends to range from good to great to fantastic.<br><br>But yeah. Go to their website, and type the pairing you&#39;re looking for into the search bar. After that...you can filter by kudos or hits if you like (or date or author&#39;s name and all that). Alternatively, you can just choose a fandom and do the same (if you&#39;re not looking for a specific pairing). That generally works.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>So, I have an idea. What if there were a clinic that took Mary Sues and rehabilitated them into real characters?<br><br>Thus, the Mary Sue Rehabilitation Clinic. <br>Ideas- Run by Parody Sues, Redeemed Sues, and Canon Characters<br>-Uses Humiliation Therapy<br>-Uniforms look good with absolutely nothing<br>- Sues able to keep one relatively minor special ability, but have reality applied to whatever attribute they intend to keep (such as a Sue with super strength suffering from super recoil, or a cat girl sue needing special therapy to not act catlike)<br>- Lessons on proper fashion, friendships and so such<br><br>This idea is not intended to have anything to do with the PPC, due to its emphasis on redeeming Sues instead of killing them, but I would like help and feedback. I&#39;m pretty sure I couldn&#39;t pull this off alone.</p>

            <p>Sounds like something that I had in mind for one of the characters I have in mind for my PPC agents. One of them is going to be a redeemed Sue, but she has memory loss and stuff.<br><br>I think this Mary Sue Rehabilitation Clinic is a good idea. Go for it!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what FicPsych&#39;s Sue Support Group is for, but...it sounds like a great idea! Let me bounce a few little ideas of my own off of yours:<br><br>-The uniforms would be sweatpants and an orange T-shirt. I doubt even the most super of supermodel Sues can rock <i>that</i> look. <br>-&quot;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&quot; would be required viewing as part of the &quot;lessons on friendship&quot;. Yes, even for warrior-Sues/Gary Stus. <br>-Normal classes to boost their tiny Sue-brains. Schoolhouse Rock videos optional. XD<br><br>Many of your ideas wouldn&#39;t be out of place in an Official Fanfiction University curriculum. Granted, OFUs train writers rather than redeem Sues, but it&#39;s the principle of the thing: Learning Through Pain and Literal Metaphors.</p>

            <p>This group is more about redeeming the general Sues, the kind the PPC normally kill. That&#39;s why the MSRC is not affiliated with the PPC.<br><br>Love your ideas. I was thinking originally a simple hospital gown in the ugliest color imaginable, but the sweatpants-and-orange-t-shirt would be great. I&#39;ll make the sweatpants purple for maximum effect. After all, the idea is to counteract the Sues&#39; natural beauty.<br><br>The FiM thing is great. I think that I&#39;ll make &#39;friendship classes&#39; a part of the main curriculum, so that the Sues learn how to really interact. <br><br>I was thinking of normal Sue-classes anyways, because all except one Sue-attribute will be stripped from them, including their unrealistic (supposed) intellect.<br><br>Humiliation Therapy, as the name suggests, focuses on embarrassing the Sues rather than causing them physical pain (although it causes an awful lot of the latter).</p>

            <p>I had this. Exact. IDEA. HOW DID YOU DO THAT?!?<br><br>I had a character named Nurse Winters, who was frequently being killed only to pop up later none the worse for wear.

            <p>Namely, that Sues are typically immune to humiliation. Anybody who disagrees with or disapproves of a Mary Sue is <i>obviously</i> mean or stupid or evil or repressive, etc., so why should the Sue listen to them? She is <i>obviously</i> kinder/smarter/better/stronger, so their words are to be stoically ignored (or prettily angsted about, if her LO is around to console her) while she proceeds to do exactly as she pleases. Same goes for the males, too, of course.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what to suggest as an alternative. Repeated applications of logic and consequences, perhaps? The clinic would have to be set somewhere like a Reality Room, where the Sue can&#39;t simply exert her will to change things to her liking.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is up late tonight.</p>

            <p>In recent months, I&#39;ve been running dozens of plans for experiments on Mary Sues. Almost all of them involve removing Glitter and Aura of Smooth from the Sue. With a few programs set on the good old AGNeS* (which, unfortunately, I haven&#39;t introduced yet), the Sue should be humiliation-prone. No more Aura of Smooth, no more instant protection from whatever problems might arise. &gt;:)<br><br>On another note entirely, one should test the resolve of the Mary Sue by giving them a special test- a maze of doors. Each door has a face printed on it- one of an ugly monster (or something like that) and the other the Sue&#39;s LO. Needless to say, the doors with the LO&#39;s picture on them lead to some… unpleasant things.<br><br>I do hope this helps!<br><br><br><br>*AGNeS: Anti-Glitter NanitE System- Exactly What It Says On The Tin. A system of nanites injected into the bloodstream of a Mary Sue (or reformed Sue) to control levels of Glitter and other Sue-ish traits. The controller looks like a thick black rubber bracelet that one puts on the Sue&#39;s wrist.</p>

            <p>Unger was his species equivalent of 15 when he arrived at the PPC. At some point I established that he had set off on a kind of walkabout where the intention was that he find adventure, kill things, and come back with trophies. The better the trophies, the more of a man he is. (He was a Barbarian, afterall.) Not everyone makes it back. Some presumably die and others just find a life they like better. He is probably never going back. He likes the life in the PPC.<br><br>Cali was 15 almost 16 when he arrived at the PPC, but he had been living in a kind of low-rent home aimed at teen boys whose family&#39;s couldn&#39;t support them since he was 13. He was from a sort of dystopian world, so even though nothing like that was mentioned in the canon, I felt like it could make sense in the world. He does feel guilty for not at least sending his mother letters though, and we (Caddy-shack and I) have actually written a story where he goes home, but never finished it. Anyway, that&#39;s how I see his continuity.<br><br>My others were of age (more or less in Kelok&#39;s case).</p>

            <p>The average age of new agents tends to follow the average age of Boarders. Back in 2004-ish, most agents were 14 or so. The youngest (human) agent was Ella Darcy, who was ten when she joined.<br><br>The old answer to this question is the one used by Vemi in <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/JAAKSONS/ch4_bjamvemi.html">&#39;The Un-Sueing of Vemi&#39;</a>, and it goes like this:<br><br><i>Since time passes differently in the metaverse than in the Earth of normal human experience, she&#39;d re-appeared only a few days after the day she&#39;d originally left to join the PPC.</i><br><br>In fact, I&#39;m not sure that doesn&#39;t still apply. There&#39;s a more recent example - 2007 - by <a href="http://rc88.dreamwidth.org/7017.html">Laburnum</a>. It... hmm. Agent Laburnum does imply that time passes the same - <i>“I joined up over a year ago and haven’t been back since, because I’m either a wanted criminal or a missing person and I wasn’t too keen to find out which one.”</i> - but also mentions that <i>&quot;...of course the OFUs de-age you and put you back five seconds after you left...&quot;</i>.<br><br>She also mentions that <i>&quot;For all I know Makes-Things and Techno-Dann might have staged my death here, I know one or two agents who specifically asked for that when they joined.&quot;</i><br><br>Ultimately, then, there are several options:<br><br>-Use OFUesque timeline shenanigans to avoid anyone knowing you&#39;re gone.<br>-Fake your death so&#39;s no-one asks.<br>-Follow the example of Constance Sims and <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndAfter.htm">have a parent who knows about the PPC</a>.<br>-Or... yeah, just tell them. The PPC isn&#39;t a <i>secret</i> organisation - <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/phobos/phobos1.html">Phobos just wandered in one day to see his wife</a> - though you should expect that a) they might not believe it, and b) might not like what they hear. As Laburnum puts it, <i>&quot;Hi, Mum, Dad, all this time you thought I was dead I was actually working as a contract killer, here, meet my coworkers who are actually giant mustelids currently in human form ...&quot;</i><br><br>I&#39;d be interested to know, actually, what other examples we have of agents dealing with the passage of time in the Real World. <a href="http://the-ppc.livejournal.com/41112.html">Ella Darcy&#39;s farewell</a> is still as emotional (for me) as it ever was, but does mention  that <i>&#39;She’d done a first year of college by correspondence (ironically enough), but was planning on finishing it in person, and making her way in the Real World.&#39;</i>. Nyx Nightingale <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/Nyx.htm">pays a brief visit</a> at the end of her intro... but what else have we got? Anyone? We might get a wiki page out of this.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I read the comments on Laburnum as saying the fact her stories aren&#39;t written when they&#39;re set as proof of the weird time stuff as opposed to just, y&#39;know, being when the stories are set. So my bad. :P<br><br>You still said most agents in-universe are underage in the present-tense though, which is what I expressed discomfort with.

            <p>It makes me a little uncomfortable, too, but there are a couple of reasons for that:<br><br>1. I&#39;m a grown-up. I see teenagers as kids who are still developing and maybe shouldn&#39;t be exposed to certain things yet.<br><br>2. My culture (national and familial) supports the idea that teenagers and even college-age people aren&#39;t <i>full</i> adults, and shouldn&#39;t have to do certain things or make certain decisions. My culture does not support the idea of teens with weapons.<br><br>However, when you <i>are</i> fourteen (for instance), you&#39;re starting to realize that you&#39;re an independent person with your own will, and you want the freedom to make decisions and take action for yourself. If you feel passionate about badfic, it probably doesn&#39;t seem weird to take matters into your own hands by means of an avatar character who&#39;s the same age as yourself.<br><br>Furthermore, I&#39;ve found there&#39;s an age range where people feel most strongly about fandoms and such, and about 13-24 (give or take) seems to be it. Once people hit college and working life, most of them seem to be less worried about it. Not that everyone gives up caring about fandom entirely, just that it&#39;s a less urgent sort of caring.<br><br>So, I say let &#39;em be fourteen if they&#39;re fourteen.

            <p>... becoming an Assassin, Slasher, Floater or whatnot in a mind-bending building with little-to-no pay, murderous food, bosses who half the time actively hate you, and a better-than-even chance of going literally insane (also a not-insignificant chance of getting killed) isn&#39;t a job you <i>take</i> if you don&#39;t care.

            <p>Wait, did I? I didn&#39;t mean to... oh, right, I see. You&#39;re right, that was a mistake on my part. In functional terms, though, the fact they they&#39;re older <i>now</i> doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t have to deal with the issue <i>once</i>.<br><br>And I&#39;m not as uncomfortable with it as you are, I&#39;m afraid. I should note that Ella was in the DAC, which is not technically an Action Department - and was there <i>because</i> she was so young. Similarly, Elanor Laison joined at 14 and was placed as a secretary until she hit 16. On the flip side, Constance appears to have become an Assassin at 13 - but the Wiki does describe her as &#39;precocious&#39;. My <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2FGfkqIpk90Dg3LGIynNdZDSiQ_w0vWjNYPu0ESWu4/pub">most recent story</a> suggests in a couple of ways that 12 is the age when HQ-born children begin initial training as an agent; I assumed that would take at least a couple of years, and maybe longer (on the principle of &#39;we can&#39;t start them working yet anyway, so we might as well train them to do it properly&#39;).<br><br>In-universe, I think a lot of the 2001-2006-era Earth-recruits were movie fangirls, and so hit the demographic for that - 14-15 is a fairly reasonable average age. Nowadays, without the swell of fangirl activism on behalf of the canons, we don&#39;t have many people who deliberately seek out the PPC (Constance Sims, Techno-Dann, Nenya and Rosie... it happened a lot), and Narrative Causality seems to lead to older people falling through plotholes.<br><br>Ultimately: I remember the 14-15-year-olds who were writing the 14-15-year-old agents. I have no problem with their semi-self-inserts being in the PPC, because I knew the people behind them.<br><br>hS rambles incoherently</p>

            <p>Of course, the problem with the Flowers&#39; way of <i>doing</i> that is that rather than saying &#39;let&#39;s take the lower badfic flux as a chance to actually train our recruits!&#39;, they seem to have said, &#39;let&#39;s take the lower badfic flux as a chance to recruit fewer people - and keep throwing them straight onto the front lines!&#39;.

            <p>Like, some people are just thrown in, some are interns for a while, there&#39;s a couple stories and nods to actual proper months-long training (like PC&#39;s latest Danny Richardson story), etc. Seems like not much is really &quot;standard&quot; about almost anything PPC since the Mysterious Somebody&#39;s day.

            <p>I can&#39;t think of specifically who&#39;s done this off the top of my head, but I know some agents have told their families they&#39;re going to school or working abroad, and that&#39;s why they aren&#39;t around.

            <p>I didn&#39;t quite think about this... though now that I do, things look pretty simple from my angle:<br>1) Both Anebrin and the Librarians are adults. Anebrin, due to the way I wrote his recruitment, is probably thought of as KiA back home. The Librarian, meanwhile, just went missing.<br>2) Agent Des is borderline. By the time of the prologue - August 2012, HST - he&#39;s already an adult (since the age is 18 in Israel), but it&#39;s implied he&#39;s been an agent for some time, which means he joined the PPC while he was a minor. Since I implied multiple times he visits his home every once in a while, I assume his parents know about the PPC. Or at least part of it. It also means he wasn&#39;t conscripted... hm.</p>

            <p>...but my own Floaters/soon-to-be-DMS agent Xanthus Garkaran has a friend from his home continuum that he continually sees on the Citadel whenever a mission just happens to put him there.

            <p>It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve been involved in anything Scouting-related, but your descriptions definitely hit all the right notes in my memories. <br><br>I liked the alternating between the technical descriptions of what the Buds and Sprouts were about and the little vignettes. It managed to both build upon the world and give us some insights into these characters when they&#39;re not on the job. These kind of stories make the PPC, at least to me, seem like a much more realistic place.<br><br>One final minor addendum: my mind rebels at the very concept of a Department of Bad Slash achievement badge.</p>

            <p>Without trying to come up with them in full, I&#39;d imagine one badge would be performing an exorcism. Another might be a presentation on why slash is okay - not that the fictional PPC seems to have the same debates about homosexuality as the real world does - and why some is Absolutely Not. No particular ideas for the third, but I&#39;m sure we could avoid exposing minors to NC-17 smut. ;) (Maybe &#39;stay away from &#39;Agent Lux&#39; [who&#39;s actually Maly in a Lux costume] as long as possible&#39;...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This is sch a wonderful idea! I think my favorite badges were the Department of Out of Character Hobbits. (As an aside, if we ever get around to publishing it, the next thing that Caddy-shack and I are planning to post sends an Agent to work in that Department). <br><br>I liked all of it, but a piece no one else has commented on yet, is where Daffyd is repeating himself and the kids are worried that he is going to spend the whole time just repeating himself, like the Time Lord lecturer. <br><br>This was even funnier to me, because I call my youngest the Sprout (short for Doomsprout, but still). <br><br>Such a great idea. I have five kids to write for, though one is now too old for this, so definitely have to use this idea.</p>

            <p>(... who thinks I&#39;ve somehow locked down or &#39;finished&#39; the history and extended canon of the PPC - however jokingly they say it, Ekyl)<br><br>The only reason there was an &#39;all the good stuff&#39; for me to write is because I (and Vemi, and Starwind) <i>created</i> it. Before I wrote the original <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/OriginsPart0.htm">Origins</a>, the only statement on the reason for the Flowers was that &#39;we replaced all the human directors long ago&#39; (which is now retconned as a joke). Before I wrote <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/ReorgTitle.htm">The Reorganisation</a>, the SO had ruled uninterrupted since the PPC was founded - and still did, because the Board of Flowers was my invention, too.<br><br>But hey, that stuff <i>is</i> all written now - so what&#39;s left to do? Well, here&#39;s what I could come up with in twenty minutes of idle speculation:<br><br>-The history of the Garden. Ekyl dismisses it as &#39;the Origins side stories&#39;, but there&#39;s enough content there for a trilogy of <i>novels</i> if you wanted. I deliberately wrote as little as possible about civilians on Origin. The tensions between Works and Garden, their reaction to the increasing industrialisation of the Hill and the dangerous technology they&#39;re playing with, <i>the entire Civil War</i>, life on Origin <i>after</i> the war, the final collapse in the Cascade... there is endless scope there, and I barely touched it. Ekyl, all of your ideas are still perfectly valid - deliberately so.<br><br>-The ten-year-ish period between the Fall of Origin and Lofty Skies. This is the formative years of the PPC, when they go from &#39;mundicidal Flowers and Korean tech support&#39; to &#39;trios of agents hunting down rogue plotholes on the ground&#39;. There are heaps of stories to tell there - and the only things written in that time period are a handful of backstories. If someone wants to do this, I&#39;m even willing to rent out those of my agents who were around then - Nyx and Dassie, looks like.<br><br>-The formation of the DIS. There&#39;s half a year or so between the Mysterious Somebody assuming power and the DIS being formed. How did he find an excuse to create a secret police? Was there rebellion against his rule? Did he <i>invent</i> a rebellion in order to continue his plans? If so, did it come true for real when the DIS was created? For that matter, what <i>was</i> the DIS originally like? Dassie says they used to be not that bad - why did they shift? Again, it&#39;s completely untouched.<br><br>-The early history of the Mary-Sue Factory and BioInc. Flowers from the PPC, with their utter terror of rogue plotholes, were somehow persuaded to build a factory to create them. How did <i>that</i> happen? I bet it didn&#39;t go smoothly. No-one who knew about the Factory made it back to HQ to spread the word - but we already know the DIS was willing to take out anyone who tried.<br><br>-The formation of the League. Reorg claims there&#39;s only one Factory, but by the end of <i>Crashing Down</i>, there&#39;s an entire chain of them. Did the MS found them? He doesn&#39;t seem to call on them. Did some of his Flowers split off? How did <i>that</i> go? How did they interact with the PPC?<br><br>And that assumes you&#39;re only interested in the big, sweeping histories. I&#39;ve also expanded massively on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1VNyAq6Ob_sujX_yCyhHSMnfXeFYbKs_B3eI6H-iiCIw">DRD</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5qyBLOsA1sFt4vtPQzirx0ELp9F7K0bJCDlyp5ULas/pub">RDR</a> - but there are other departments with equally little written about them (SIELU? The DMFF? <i>Despatch</i>?) I&#39;ve written <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=16daCJWsF3F-0D0lftpl1Yt6-yt6Hfd7fohBWUYFRdPs">numerous</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ec-NVjkXCoFPl-kIgmuGKkwqulKrq0R2o-J5RV_d3Dk/pub">interludes</a> <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/DAVD2009.htm">about</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=16rHIVptHv4f4T1b84F9OtS3ofU2CD5P6FrFQLqMQ5vk">various</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G7CvxuwBvOkHi6_soXCz4YSZOxgioUx2Ah98n0atVPc/pub">Flowers</a> - but nowhere near all of them, and there&#39;s vastly more to say. I have a list of Infrastructure Departments first described by me as long as my arm, always including the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TjFsuVhzR_iPwxw_sxLz9LjuDF6ylRbA6FrXMI-EVrw/pub">DoDAEG</a> - but are there really no essential functions of HQ left untouched? I have <a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/Playscript1.htm">Playscriptes</a> which introduced the concept of six-dimensional HQ - but very few stories have really played with that. I have a <a href="http://genericsurface.livejournal.com/profile">webcomic</a>, but no-one has yet created any movies of anything PPC-related (barring my &#39;let&#39;s make HQ in Minecraft&#39; video). Most recently, I&#39;ve invented <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1afI3ufG8vPT2eFkA4tcmCdcYYqFk3kRhwnFhz_f6sh8/pub">mission pins</a> - and used them in a mission - and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2FGfkqIpk90Dg3LGIynNdZDSiQ_w0vWjNYPu0ESWu4/pub">Sprout movement</a>; there&#39;s nothing to stop anyone else doing random things of the same kind. My next minor project is called &#39;Ephemerals&#39;, and will build on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rptcTAxPrClb9GP3hGg217NDu4B55YGM1v1_Ax8puC0/pub">Wrecked Music Department</a> to look at some of our defunct departments, including some which have never been named before.<br><br>There is <i>so much</i> to write, folks. Anyone who thinks I - or anyone else - has done it all is missing a multiverse of opportunity.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... the &#39;secret&#39; in Secret Police isn&#39;t that their <i>existence</i> is secret - otherwise how do you use them to terrify your subjects? The &#39;secret&#39; part is who they <i>are</i>. There&#39;s a reason the DIS wear their badges on sashes - it means they can take them off and shove them in a pocket. Anyone you talk to could be a Guard. So you watch what you say even when you&#39;re among friends.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If a DIS agent going incognito involves them removing their flash patch quickly and placing it in a pocket, then the situation they were in when they decided to conceal their identities would need to be one in which a typical agent would be wearing a flash patch in the first place, right? Otherwise, if no one else nearby was wearing one, there would be no need to create special measures to hide a Guard&#39;s identity to avoid being conspicuous. They would just be wearing non-uniform clothing like everyone else. So, do the DIS spies have a backup flash patch that they wear during situations that would require a full uniform, and they just sling the sash over that when they decide to reveal themselves and arrest someone?<br><br>I mean, I can see how the patchless secrecy would work if you were in a hallway or something, and just pass by someone who isn&#39;t wearing any department designation without you noticing it, but in order to ingratiate oneself into social groups, which you implied that some of the DIS members would do with your line about speaking freely among friends, the spies would at least need to have some kind of cover story, right? A backup flash patch would help with that. Though it wouldn&#39;t be as effective if one of the agents that a Guard was sent to spy on decides to go over to the disguised Guard&#39;s RC for whatever reason(surprise party? following them back? unforeseen shenanigans?), it would at least provide a springboard for when the targets start asking questions.</p>

            <p>I have no particular plans to write anything else set in the DIS-era, so there&#39;s no story confirmation of any of this until and unless someone writes it, but that sounds eminently sensible.<br><br>Of course, it raises the question of whether the patchless DIA could do the same thing... following this train of thought, maybe they don&#39;t have patches because it makes a distinct divide from this. &#39;The DIS wore whatever patches they liked to get in among you, and threw on their own to come out of cover. We will never wear <i>any</i> patch, our own or yours.&#39; That sort of makes sense.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>They&#39;re really important for certain investigations and just going &quot;yeah we&#39;re never going to do that&quot; would be sorta foolish. So I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a thing they could do if they needed to conduct such an operation - in fact when I finally get an idea or two I might write that next time I do a DIA story - but I could see it as having been making the divide from the old DIS, yeah. Tactics like that in the DIA would likely need a good reason to be applied and aren&#39;t just used to intimidate people like the DIS did - it&#39;s possible the Board even kept them from using it at all pre-2006. I&#39;ll have to ponder it, because it&#39;s interesting territory.</p>

            <p>Earlier today, I was working on a story idea that I came up with recently. In one scene I was thinking of, the protagonist becomes a powerful, dangerous superbeing with dangerous powers. Then I gave it some thought… and realized that I had been inspired by ^Busou Renkin.^<br><br>The works of Nobuhiro Watsuki--^Rurouni Kenshin^, ^Busou Renkin^, and ^Embalming: The Another Tale of Frankenstein^--are not as well known as ^Naruto^ or ^One Piece^, but I&#39;ve found them to be incredible.<br><br>Meaningless bit of trivia--Eiichiro Oda, the author of ^One Piece^, worked as an assistant to Watsuki before going on to write his own series.<br><br>So put your hand in the air if you&#39;re a Watsuki fan!<br><br>And then go and kill Kenshin sues. Good luck.</p>

            <p>The protagonists fight monsters called &quot;Wraths.&quot; While I haven&#39;t ironed out the power system they use yet (this is a relatively new story), they use negative energy to attack and positive energy to defend. The main character learns insanely powerful attacks as per norm from the old man mentor, and has a mysterious rival not affiliated with his organization.<br><br>Then it turns out that the mentor has been teaching him more and more powerful attacks in order for him to transform into a villainous super being of apocalyptic power. The boy uses his most powerful attack to neutralize a threat to his friends, and transforms. Then he kills the mentor for threatening his friends and begins to act all villainous and crazy. His teammates escape with his rival and hide out while trying to figure out a way to bring him down.<br><br>I realized that the transformation into super being part is a little reminiscent Kazuki Muto&#39;s transformation into Victor III.

            <p>I simply have to ask this.<br><br>I have learned a lot here on the Posting Board, and one of the things I have learned is that stories cannot be used more than once for a mission. I can understand why. The Mary Sue had been eliminated, and all.<br><br>But it got me thinking. I am currently making plans for my own commentary series Imaginations Collide, for those who do not yet know. In order to make it expansive, I want to make it correlate with preexisting series, such as the Fanfiction Critic and the PPC. <br><br>My question is this; if I want my PPC agents to do a mission for a story that has already been done, will it be okay, as long as I explain it in the context of Imaginations Collide? <br><br>I don&#39;t think that what I have in mind has ever been done before, so I expect the answer to be anything. What are your thoughts, friends?</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re asking would it be okay for your PPC agents to go on a mission to a fic that&#39;s already been PPC&#39;d before (with some explanation from your other series), the answer would be no, for the reasons you&#39;re already aware of. It would be redundant out-of-universe and pointless if not impossible in-universe. Plus, you don&#39;t want to be the guy who thinks he&#39;s so much better than those who came before him that he can get away with retreading their work.<br><br>If you&#39;re asking would it be okay for your PPC agents to go on a mission that&#39;s been addressed in your non-PPC series or another fanfic critique...? Maybe, if you think there&#39;s a point to it. There&#39;s nothing wrong with multiple critiques of the same work, as long as each critique brings something new to the table. Otherwise, again, it&#39;s just redundant.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Okay, so, if I wasn&#39;t clear, sorry. My bad. Here is what I was talking about.<br><br>In Imaginations Collide, there will be an overall villain, and that villain is going to be intricately woven into the very fabric of the Internet. Since it is power hungry, it wants power the same way Users, or Authors, as they are called in Fanfiction.net. The best way for it to do that would be for it to take over certain stories that people talk about a lot, like legendary badfics (or some good fics, but mostly bad ones). <br><br>What I want to know is if it would be acceptable if my PPC agents are investigating an anomaly that is bringing back badfics that have been done in the PPC missions before. For example, Agony in Pink. I think someone did that already. The anomaly, which is linked with the Imaginations Collide villain, is resuscitating it and bringing the terminated characters back to life.<br><br>If I explain it in that context, would that be allowed? I know it is redundant, and I will have to make that a talking point among my Agents, but it is meant to tie in with Imaginations Collide and such, the members of which will definitely be doing fics that have already been done.</p>

            <p>That smacks of Drama For Drama&#39;s Sake to me. It&#39;s not something that would naturally happen in the PPC universe, and if it&#39;s left up to the PPC agents rather than the Imaginations Collide protagonists to deal with it, it&#39;s obviously not critical in the IC storyline, so I don&#39;t see the point except to engineer something big and special for your agents to do.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The PPC agents wouldn&#39;t be the only ones dealing with it, though. The IC crew would have their hands full with De facto missions of their own. I just can&#39;t provide many more details without giving any spoilers.<br><br>However, what the IC crew would be doing is trying to find out why strange things keep happening whenever they try to do a commentary on a story. For example, the IC version of your truly, Dark Brother 16, would be struggling to track down the characters from his stories that were either kidnapped by characters from the badfic or decided to go in there just to cause the IC version of yours truly, one of the hosts, grief. They develop wills of their own and decide to defect.<br><br>Meanwhile, while all that is going on, the Flowers notice that slain badfics are being resurrected somehow, and put a team together to stop the spread of revival while the other active agents try to continue with their work.<br><br>If it makes it any better, I will try to keep the number of resurrected badfics to a minimum without sacrificing the continuity with IC, if I can. I have a few planned that I want to tie in.<br><br>But as for the Drama for Drama&#39;s Sake, I can see where you are coming from with that. But I can still fit lots of humor in there.</p>

            <p>I find that what helps me write is doing something that gets me pumped. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me, but I tend to get some sort of random inspiration when blood is flowing through my brain. <br><br>What do I mean? Well, what I do- I do many things. I listen to intense music, specifically,  Slipknot. But it doesn&#39;t have to be heavy, intense music. Just listen to what music you love.<br><br>Also what you could do is watch Youtube, Netfilx, Hulu, or just DVD&#39;s. Watch a movie that you find inspirational. Or you can read a book that you love, or even talk to someone about ideas you have.<br><br>That is how I get ideas when I am having trouble. In your case, though, I expect that it will get you going, since you have your ideas already ready to go. But I get my advice from sources like Writer&#39;s Digest, so they may really work. It&#39;s not for everyone, but still...<br><br>Hope it helps.</p>

            <p>Well, when Randa and I worked on our first mission, what we did was print off the badfic (obviously, you don&#39;t want to print all of it if it&#39;s really long- maybe just the first ten pages?) and we went through it together with pencils, circling stuff like spelling errors and unintentionally funny sentences, and we also wrote in little comments about what the agents might say to seeing it in person. <br><br>(We also kept tallies for the number of times out &#39;Sue said &#39;EK!&#39;, which made it a little more bearable.)<br><br>Once the initial sporking was done, I started the mission by plopping the agents directly into the fic and working from there. Any particularly atrocious lines, or funny lines, or relevant lines were included, along with the agents&#39; reactions to them.<br><br>After the mission itself was finished, I went back and wrote the intro bit and then gave it to Randa to check over for SPaG and for Randa&#39;s (the agent) characterization.<br><br>Tl;dr I suggest MSTing the thing first. It doesn&#39;t require characterizing or plot and it can help you spot some particularly good gems of bad lines you might want to include.</p>

            <p>Except I do it all on my laptop, highlighting misspellings, funny bits, and other things I definitely need to include; leaving comments for myself if I think of particularly good jokes or gags; making note of any outside information I&#39;ve looked up; etc. I also choose the point where I want to kill it ahead of time—it helps a LOT to know where the story is going to end. Then, with all the highlighted stuff, you end up with a pretty good road map of the story, and you just have to get the characters from start to finish in a fun way. {= )<br><br>One important thing to note is that I don&#39;t include EVERYTHING I mark up in the document. You have to pick and choose the things that are vital to the story—things that demonstrate particularly well what the fic is doing and why it doesn&#39;t work—and not be afraid to leave out redundancies and distractions, even funny ones.<br><br>Also, some advice I gave someone else <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=254517;">recently</a>: beware of Talking-Heads Syndrome. Agents in a mission ought to be actively doing things and reacting to the terrible things being done to them. If all your agents are doing is standing around in undescribed space, in undescribed spatial relation to each other, merely inserting snarky comments between chunks of fic, that&#39;s a drag, and you might as well just write an MST.<br><br>A tip I learned for getting started on a story is to just write some kind of introduction, even if it sucks. It&#39;s allowed to suck, because once you get going, you can chop it off. Think of it as an on-ramp or runway: you need it to get going, but once you&#39;re off, you leave it behind.<br><br>Hope that helps!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I really, really hate writer&#39;s block. Some of my advice... Write the start of the mission on paper. Then, when you get to a point where your imagination is flowing, copy it onto the computer and go from there. If you come up with another case of writer&#39;s block, do the same thing. It may or may not help. :)</p>

            <p>According to the timeline on the Wiki, there hasn&#39;t been one since 2009, and even that one is debated as an actual emergency. <br><br>But anyway! What I wanted to know was how exactly such emergencies came to be a part of PPC canon, and if anything like that might happen again in the future (because if the last &#39;real&#39; emergency was back in 2008, that would give any of the PPC&#39;s enemies six whole years to plot and prepare).<br><br>What prompted this was the appearance of the SO and the Marquis in one of the below threads; cracks in the fabric of the universe are generally not a good sign...</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know how they got started. I think I still count as a Newbie here. But I can guess that the reason was that, as the universe of the PPC became more expansive, community events, known as Emergencies, became part of the canon.<br><br>Again, still a Newbie, don&#39;t know if I&#39;m right, but that is my educated guess.<br><br>Something I never understood, though. Does anyone know how these things were organized?

For example...<br><br>FicPsych needs more space, so they&#39;re expanding (don&#39;t ask what they&#39;re expanding into; the math for it hasn&#39;t been invented yet).

FicPsych allows it for the therapeutic value; there&#39;s been entirely too much Generic Food at Hogwarts and Redwall lately.<br>--Agents who are too Insane to work but not too Insane to let out on a field trip go to stay with former partners while walls are being knocked down.<br><br>Stuff like that might be interesting.

            <p>FicPsych is chronically understaffed as a rule, and they&#39;ve always seemed to have plenty of space. More than enough now, I&#39;d say, since most canon characters get neuralyzed in the field these days.<br><br>That said, if what&#39;s wanted is an excuse to bunk people in the Cafeteria, there are other ways to make the department unlivable for a period of time.

            <p>An agent, or pair of agents, portals into FicPsych and accidentally lets something through like your suggested laughing gas or gravity-reversal spell. Or someone was tinkering with their console and somehow managed to screw up the sound system all over HQ. Nothing super-serious, but problematic enough to change things up a little.<br><br>And I don&#39;t think anyone in their right minds would <i>dare</i> call the staff incompetent.

            <p>There is a long tradition (which is sadly uncitable, due to the Board archives not going back nearly that far) of Agents and Flowers showing up on-Board to say things; it happens when someone thinks it&#39;s the best/funniest way to make a point (which is what I was doing when I <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=257583;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">posted as the Marquis</a>). On certain special occasions, it has meant that there&#39;s a metafictional breach - but it does <i>not</i> have to mean that all the time.<br><br>I know you weren&#39;t the (only) one to subscribe to that interpretation - Sergio, Des, and PC did the same thing - but I think it&#39;s an interpretation that can be rather damaging to our goal of having fun.<br><br>Oh, here&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=253311;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">an example</a> - no-one read that as &#39;the agents of SIELU have infiltrated the Board&#39;. It was just... funny. Sometimes things can just be funny.<br><br>(Emergencies have already been adequately covered; but I think this post means I need to finally start <i>The Ispace Wars</i> to look at &#39;any of the PPC&#39;s enemies&#39; some more)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There are maybe three ways to react to that kind of post: silliness, humour, and seriousness. Silliness is to simply assume that that&#39;s what it is - someone being silly, nothing to do with canon. Humour is to treat it as a thing that&#39;s actually happening, and deal with it humorously. Seriousness is to assume that the multiverse is breaking down and Mary-Sues will soon be occupying the Empire State Building (because it&#39;s, liek, the biggest one, so it <i>must</i> be the mostest important!) unless we crush this foolishness immediately.<br><br>&#39;Fun&#39; covers both silliness and humour; your response was humour, whereas I was expecting silliness, and it threw me off. I hadn&#39;t actually thought about this before, so I leapt to the assumption that you-and-others were dropping into seriousness. I apologise.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>(I expect this is a mix of silliness and vague seriousness, though I could be entirely wrong...)<br><br>&quot;But why the Empire State building?&quot; Tony Stark let his head fall back. &quot;Seriously, why can&#39;t anyone ever take over a club?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; Dean Winchester replied. He checked his gun&#39;s magazine as he grumbled. &quot;We <i>never</i> get to deal with stuff like that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh,&quot; said Dean&#39;s brother, Sam. &quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting Lucifer?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That was different,&quot; Dean retorted. &quot;He didn&#39;t take over buildings, just the world.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, we&#39;ve had to deal with things like a giant slug eating the Statue of Liberty,&quot; Clint Barton put in. He sighed. &quot;That was a day and a half. We had to call in Daja Kisubo--smith-mages are a big help with slugs.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What I don&#39;t understand,&quot; put in PPC Agent Edgar Sullivan, &quot;is why you&#39;re all together in the first place. How did you even manage to meet?&quot;<br><br>Edgar&#39;s partner, Agent Agen_<strong><em>t, glanced over at him from where ze had been watching the holographic display. &quot;The multiverse is breaking down, Sullivan.

She widened her eyes at the looks she got. &quot;Isn&#39;t that what you&#39;re supposed to say in situations like these?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Seems out of character for you,&quot; Feanor said. He was sitting cross-legged on a table, absorbed in his task of fitting wires together in a sublimely beautiful pattern. &quot;Of course, worlds colliding tend to have that effect. Aha!&quot; He grinned at his wires, and began to twist the entire design. &quot;This will be good...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Speaking of out of character,&quot; the Ninth Doctor said mildly, &quot;you&#39;re a good example right now. Of course, we should probably save the world from these Sues just now, shouldn&#39;t we?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Isn&#39;t that my line?&quot; Rose Tyler asked.<br><br>Edgar and Agen</em></strong><em>t exchanged glances.<br><br>&quot;This isn&#39;t good,&quot; Edgar murmured, and Agen</em><strong><em>t nodded. &quot;We should probably go back to HQ.

<li>&quot;Emergency&quot; is a bit of a bad word around here. They are not things we want to happen.<br><br>2. When we say &quot;Emergency,&quot; we&#39;re mostly talking about the 2008 Macrovirus Epidemic and Mary Sue Invasion. Those are the main things that prompted the moratorium on Emergencies.<br><br>3. When those things happened, we were in the midst of a movement toward including every spin-off in the canon. We wanted (and still want!) our stories to live in a shared universe where the characters could interact freely with each other, not have each spin-off be its own little sub-reality that might not have anything to do with anyone else&#39;s. So, when one guy decided to kill off Makes-Things, infect all HQ with macroviruses, and then invade it with Mary Sues, <i>everyone</i> was affected, and we didn&#39;t quite know how to say &quot;no&quot; at the time because something like that was unprecedented.<br><br>4. Ultimately, we did say &quot;no; never again.&quot; We do not accept that one person should be able to affect the whole PPC universe without consulting everyone else, just by writing it into a spin-off or running a role-play on the Board.<br><br>That&#39;s why Emergencies are banned, but emergency-like things such as the 2013 Blackout can still happen on a <i>strictly opt-in</i> basis.<br><br>Hopefully that clarifies the situation a little more. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, Who Was There.</li>

            <p>I can see why they were banned. &gt;_<br>In that case, we&#39;ll need to get the PPC characters together in some other manner.

            <p>RPs and cowrites are <i>great</i> ways to get characters together! Ain&#39;t nothing wrong with more of that.<br><br>Another way to tie things together, though, is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Extended_Challenge:_Intertextuality">intertextuality</a>, which is a term I think JulyFlame coined for the challenge at the end of the hyperlink. The challenge is long over, but the idea is still a good one. Basically, it means referring to other people&#39;s stuff in your stuff—mentioning other people&#39;s agents, or missions, or other recent events in the course of a story. PPC agents likely (over)hear all kinds of things in the Cafeteria, through the rumor mill, just walking through the halls, etc. Have them talk about them. {= )<br><br>Also, never fear to ask others if you can include their characters in your story as cameos. Most of us will probably say yes! It&#39;s very gratifying if others are that interested in your characters, and it&#39;s fun to be included. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>And wow, you have a post up! I enjoyed it. ^_^ It&#39;s nice to get some insight into those first crazy moments of falling into HQ. Normally we just sort of take it for granted that it happens and everything somehow works out fine for the character, despite how overwhelmingly weird it must be.<br><br>FYI, though, it&#39;s pretty much never okay to write what someone else&#39;s characters do/say without their permission. Referring to stuff they have done, yes; making up new stuff for them, no. I&#39;ll allow it in this case, because Ilraen would absolutely help out a newbie who crash-landed in the Cafeteria, but ask first next time, &#39;kay? {= )<br><br>Oh, also FYI, you can set the date of your posts to whatever you want. I think Rina arrived in HQ quite some time ago, so you can backdate the post if you want, to make it more accurate to her timeline. I did that on Ilraen&#39;s second entry. It&#39;s a really nice feature for this fictional stuff, and it&#39;s also handy if you want to have a master post (a table of contents for your missions/other stuff, perhaps) that&#39;s always at the top.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who simply must comment on the journal now.</p>

Choose a journal skin that suits your character(s), upload icons for them, etc. There are lots of beautiful skins to choose from.<br>3.

Barid felt that he could help.<br><br>The troll agent looked at his table-mate and said in his Troll accent (read:Jamaican), &quot;Someone should do somet&#39;in about da Flowers.

He spoke with a slight Scottish accent. &quot;If we stand up tae them, we&#39;ll lose.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ya,&quot; said Barid, gaining strength as he spoke, &quot;Stand an ya may lose. Follow dem and ya&#39;ll live. And when ya console&#39;s beepin, years from now, would ya be willin&#39; ta trade ALL da days,&quot; he climbed onto the table with a bowl in his hand, &quot;from dis day to dat, for one chance, just one chance, ta come back &#39;ere and tell da Flowers dat dey may take our vacations, but dey&#39;ll never take... OUR FOOD FIGHTS!&quot; <br><br>With that final yell he scooped a blue, pudding-like mass out of the bowl and hurled it at someone sitting at the next table.<br>-----------<br><br><br>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the real reason Barid isn&#39;t allowed in the Cafeteria anymore.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>1) Why would there be sudden disruptions in pre-existing stories? True, a large number of plotholes to Headquarters appear when a suddenly-appearing hole engulfs an area or someone topples into it after shenanigans happen, but in order to send massive amounts of notable canon characters flinging outside of their native world into the null space of Headquarters, there would need to be something going on that was more messed up than even the already-enormously-plot-hole-ridden stories of ill repute could handle.<br>Unless we&#39;re assuming that a large number of canon characters just notice as a group the unstable fabric of the universe just tripped on its own proverbial tail in front of them, and they responded with &quot;Ooh, look, a shiny hole hovering in space! Let&#39;s walk through it!&quot;, but I&#39;m pretty sure that even in very stupidly written continua, the majority of characters would be smart enough not to do that. <br><br>2) Would someone have to RP the displaced canon characters? How exactly would they interact with everybody? Would each person taking part in the RP just have to RP a certain character alongside their agent? That wouldn&#39;t be very interactive with the other Boarders, but it&#39;s the closest idea I can think of that would work, unless we&#39;d ask the Board at large who wants to be the Honorary Galbatorix or the Honorary Jacob.<br><br>3) This is probably going to come across as me being a killjoy, but I&#39;ll just out and say it: if canon characters got into HQ, what would most likely happen would be that someone from a Security Department would show up, capture them if necessary, and then either restrain them for PPC checks or immediately portal them back home, and wipe the characters&#39; memories once they were back where they belonged. In addition, the natural plotholes dump things into HQ all the time, and that&#39;s usually dealt with without large-scale events. It would be sizably scaled for the people who are sent out to contain the breach(and possibly recruit it if it&#39;s a sapient being, susceptible to its new environment, and not an established canon character), but it might not even register to more than a handful of other people.<br>Essentially, what would be making this breach so special compared to all the others, aside from the more-than-usual number of characters it sends through? There would need to be something in particular that keeps the characters from just being rounded up and sent back, especially since the majority of canon characters would express a desire to be returned to their world to complete their story already in progress and thus wouldn&#39;t put up all that much of a fight. Maybe this could be tied into the event that brought them there in the first place, but regardless there would need to be some reason why lots of PPC employees get involved here.<br><br>4) If the plotholes &quot;finally destabilize&quot; to make this happen... that might just be a phrasing problem or I&#39;m interpreting it poorly(Though there are only so many things &quot;final&quot; can mean, so I&#39;m not sure how else I can interpret it. Maybe the idea was that something integral to HQ&#39;s structure has stretched to the brink and just a short time ago snapped entirely, but that isn&#39;t much better.), but that sounds nastily irreversible to me. If things start getting &quot;finally destabilized&quot;, we might have to deal with parts of HQ vanishing as the plothole-sustained sections start becoming unable to maintain themselves, or things from the outer reaches bypassing the shields entirely, and the last time the shields stopped being able to keep out trouble, we got Weeping Angels in here, and when they failed in 2006, the Black Cats invaded. Shirtless werewolves and prima donna dragons would be the least of our problems.</p>

            <p>...Emergencies were outlawed at least partially because they put too much strain on all the agents&#39; personal timelines, and everyone had to determine where everyone was, and where they had been to not die, and if they did this in the Emergency or that... It generally made a mess. The thing is, you can still have Emergency-type things. Last year&#39;s Blackout was sort of a  small-scale one, and allowed to happen because it was perfectly plausible to say that your agent was hiding in the RC or out in a mission and so didn&#39;t notice, and Sergio Turbo&#39;s Blank Sprite saga has all the hallmarks of an Emergency--except that the knowledge of it is deliberately restricted to his agents, so, again, there won&#39;t be any personal timeline problem for the rest of everyone &#39;cause they have no clue it&#39;s even happening.<br><br>I think that&#39;s all. Someone more knowledgeable about PPC history will probably correct me about something, though. I&#39;d welcome it.<br><br>-Aila</p>

            <p>There are no more emergencies planned because they were HQ-wide events that required everyone present to respond to them. That&#39;s not something that everybody wants, so the closest thing would be an event like the Blackout: if you want in, you can. If not, that&#39;s totally fine.</p>

            <p>The LMSF is more of a feature of the PPC multiverse than a &quot;plotline&quot; as such. It would be like looking ast a map, pointing at a country, and saying &quot;Why don&#39;t we go and solve that?&quot; You don&#39;t really resolve an organization, unless you disband it completely or reform it into something else, and there&#39;s no real reason to do that, since the League has plenty of future story potential that people just haven&#39;t been using, which would be more fun to use than blowing it all up would be.<br><br>Besides, the point behind a PPC-wide event isn&#39;t someone saying &quot;Huh. We&#39;ve not had anything big in a while, and I think I have an idea for something new we can do based on this, those, and that over there.&quot; That&#39;s exactly what we don&#39;t want. The Blackout worked because it was developed by a number of people for slightly different reasons based on some weird thing that happened to the Board one day, and only formed into one encompassing event because the group as a whole decided that it would be more fun if we decided to make it an actual canonical thing that happened during a certain period of time than if we left it as a series of jokes. One person imposing their plot advancements on everyone else is what got Emergencies their nasty reputation in the first place.</p>

            <p>After reading several young adult romance novels, one thing I noticed was that the love interest was always hot. I&#39;ve seen it in Twilight, I&#39;ve seen it in badfic, and I&#39;ve seen it in some good books, but I&#39;ve seen it.<br><br>And I wondered, &quot;What if looks weren&#39;t an issue?&quot;<br><br>And so the world of Masks was born.<br><br>In this world, it&#39;s a social imperative to always wear a mask. Even when you&#39;re sleeping or bathing. There is a social imperative to never think of the mask as your true face, so you do get to see what you look like about once a year, in a special ceremony to ward off evil influences. The only other person to ever see your face is your fiancee, and that will only happen after a lengthy courtship and a marriage for love, because the idea is that only the most trusted person in your life should see what is to this society the greatest secret in your life.<br><br>So, the love interest may be pretty, and he may be ugly. You&#39;ll never know until the couple has already agreed to marry, and already love each other, not knowing what the other looks like.</p>

            <p>&quot;The Moon Moth&quot; by Jack Vance is a science fiction novella that involves an alien society where everyone wears a mask all the time. Social status is everything on that world—it&#39;s like currency. Anybody can take anything they want, wear whatever kind of mask they want, providing they have the social chutzpah to back it up, and people <i>know</i> if you&#39;re faking it. They communicate with the aid of several small, tricky musical instruments, a different one depending on whether the person you&#39;re talking to is of a similar, lesser, or greater status, and how intimate you are with them; and the language is much more about communicating feelings than it is about concrete facts. Now, imagine a hapless Earthling suddenly dropped into this world to fill in for the previous guy who had his job, and then asked to find a dangerous criminal with no way of even recognizing him....<br><br>It&#39;s a really cool story. Good classic sci-fi. I recommend it, especially since you&#39;ll want to avoid duplicating it too closely. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yeah. I was just thinking of these points, and I saw this convenient little post down here to answer. So...<br><br>As far as the appearance, I believe the mask would be full face, possibly even covering the whole head. (Do they wear hoods with the masks and cover the rest of their heads? Can you show off your hair? Things to think on.) This would be so that nobody&#39;s running around with a skinny little domino mask and showing off their face.<br><br>Social standing? i have absolutely no idea.<br><br>Well, we would be able to tell who&#39;s a boy and who&#39;s a girl, so there would probably a difference of styles between masks. Like color, or animal basis, or something like that.<br><br>As for the other questions, I&#39;m running out of steam now, so I&#39;ll leave that to LonelyStar. :)</p>

            <p>Yes, the masks are full face. Hoods are optional, although sometimes added.<br><br>Masks reflect your place in society, so a shopkeeper would wear a specific style of mask, and a servant would wear another. <br><br>There are ways to tell who&#39;s a boy and who&#39;s a girl, but I haven&#39;t really thought too much on that. <br><br>The animal-basis thing is only for the Emperor&#39;s house (House Phoenix), and several noble houses given the honor by House Phoenix for their services during a troubled time a long, long time ago.</p>

            <p>Neshomeh&#39;s already explained why we don&#39;t have anything about TMNT on the Wiki - it&#39;s the same reason we don&#39;t have anything on, say, <i>Paradise Lost</i> - so I won&#39;t repeat her points. I will say that, while the TMNT page you created will probably be removed, mentions of your OFU won&#39;t be (or shouldn&#39;t); it exists, so in the interests of cataloguing, we&#39;ll mention it unless we have a good reason otherwise.<br><br>Instead (as well?) I&#39;m going to address your other post, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=257818;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>:<br><br><i>Oh man...I never realized a few spelling/grammar mistakes would be so bad.</i><br><br>This is going to depend entirely on your audience. Most people, let&#39;s be honest, won&#39;t care. But we&#39;re the PPC. We&#39;ve been nattering on about spelling, grammar, and punctuation since we came into existence. It&#39;s kind of our thing (one of several, I admit).<br><br>More to the point, you&#39;re not just writing any old story - in which case, if it came to our attention for some reason, we&#39;d just grumble and move on. You&#39;re writing an <i>Official Fanfiction University</i>. Your story demonstrates that you know what that means:<br><br><i>Dragon Love had to stop writing when she felt ice cold steel press against her neck, she felt deep fear and a Japanese Accented voice said &quot;I&#39;m going to have to stop you right there.&quot;<br><br>Dragon Love turned her head and saw a tall Japanese Woman with a strict expresion on her face the Woman was holding a Katana to her neck.<br><br>&quot;I am Karai.&quot; The Woman said<br><br>[...]<br><br>&quot;I have come to tell you you are now drafted into the Mutant Academy.&quot; Karai handed Dragon Love some papers...&quot;Your various crimes against our Canon left us no choice.&quot;</i><br><br>OFUs are two things. First, of course, they&#39;re stories - and they&#39;re supposed to be entertaining ones, naturally! Like I said in my review, TMNT is just a whirl of unfamiliar names to me these days, but you do have some good ideas. Making all your students into randomly-determined mutants was a good one, for instance. So on the &#39;story&#39; front, you at least have a good start.<br><br>But the other thing OFUs do is try to teach people how to write better - and specifically how to write in the fandom they&#39;re written in. Probably the biggest example of this I can think of is Lily Winterwood, who regularly sticks actual lectures into her OFUs. <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8083780/9/MBSFA-A-Caper-in-Crimsun">Here we see</a> a lesson given by Bilbo and Smaug, for instance, in the <i>Sherlock</i> OFU.<br><br>But even more than lectures, OFUs are meant to show by <i>example</i>. If you write a story that says &#39;good writing is important!&#39;, and you have dodgy spelling, mis-placed punctuation, and bad grammar, anyone who looks to you for examples of how to do it well is going to think those things don&#39;t matter. And anyone who knows they <i>do</i> is going to have a hard time liking your story, because it&#39;s... well, hypocrisy. If you hire me to catch a thief, and I steal your stationary while you tell me about it, you&#39;d think twice or even three times about giving me any money - even if I was the best thief-catcher in the world.<br><br>You also said:<br><br><i>I&#39;m going to be honest with everyone, I am a person with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, so I guess my spelling/grammar mistakes are caused by...Being so excited about my writing I don&#39;t stop and spellcheck</i><br><br>I can see how that makes a certain amount of sense, but honestly? We&#39;ve had people with Asperger&#39;s here on the PPC Board before. Some of them have been our best writers. On the other hand, even some long-time regulars with Asperger&#39;s never got the hang of it (to anyone who&#39;s interested, I&#39;m thinking of kippur here). So you may have a point - I&#39;m certainly not prepared to claim you&#39;re lying!<br><br>So, if spelling and grammar are important, but you, as an author, are incapable of giving them the attention they need, what&#39;s the solution? Simple: a beta reader. That&#39;s someone who looks at your stories before you post them (but after you feel they&#39;re finished), and tries to catch any errors.<br><br>There are many ways for betas to work. Often, you want a &#39;canon beta&#39; - one who can check that you&#39;ve got the details of the canon correct. As I&#39;ve said, I can&#39;t help you there. But I <i>can</i> help with the SPG errors. If you would like, I will go through your current five chapters with a fine-toothed comb, correcting every error of that kind that I come across; I&#39;m even willing to do the same thing for any future chapters of <i>Mutant Academy</i>.<br><br>Obviously, my hope would be that my doing this would help you to learn to do it for yourself, making my job less and less necessary. But even if that doesn&#39;t happen, the offer&#39;s still there.<br><br>hS, long-winded, but had a lot to say</p>

That&#39;s why there was no page, and why the one you added will probably be taken down. It&#39;s not that we have anything against TMNT, or you for that matter.

            <p>They&#39;re non-humans (I&#39;ve never been comfortable with any of the miniature-human versions of minis), and fairly iconic in their own right - as a team, not individually. I don&#39;t see any actual instances of the minis, but I suspect they&#39;re in the same vein as mini-Aragogs - they&#39;re actually just minis of the same species, but - oh, yes, it&#39;s in Chapter 4 - &#39;mini-Rhino-Mutant&#39; is a fairly awful name.<br><br>More to the point, while <i>we</i> - as the PPC - usually stick to just one mini (though there are continuua where the minis are &#39;a miniature version of the appropriate [whatever]&#39;, determined by something about the character) - the OFUs are not under PPC Community jurisdiction. We&#39;re the heirs of Jay and Acacia, not of Miss Cam - we don&#39;t have the <i>right</i> to say what OFUs aren&#39;t allowed to do. Make suggestions, yes - but not issue orders.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>When you misspell a name, would it create both a mini-Bebop and a mini-Rocksteady, both with the same name? Because if not, the minis would still be operating as individuals, and there would need to be some way of determining why one mini came out a Bebop and the other came out a Rocksteady. I think it would just make sense to have the original model for minis be part of a single species, rather than the two species that Bebop and Rocksteady are, while remaining iconic to its native continuum. I&#39;m not going to claim I have very much knowledge of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, though, so the only idea that I would have for an alternative mini choice is one I already mentioned.<br><br>You&#39;re right that the most we can do is make suggestions, and that&#39;s what I was trying to do. I had intended to point out something inconsistent, say why it didn&#39;t quite fit, and offer an alternate solution, and I apologize if it seemed like I was ordering anyone around. Consistency is always good, whether it&#39;s consistency with the other OFUs, which also usually have one mini species each, or with the broad nature of how minis as a whole have been shown to, for lack of a better word, work, and I would always like to see it maintained if possible.</p>

            <p>Since the OFU non-franchise was declared open by Miss Cam, any OFU story which acknowledges her as the origin of the concept is legitimate. If it contradicts a previous mini type in the PPC, then we probably end up discussing it here to decide what to do (as we recently did with the Pokemon mini). If it&#39;s a very <i>bad</i> OFU, we may well decide - as the PPC - to not recognise it, and - as OFU<sup>2</sup> - to go and break its supporting columns with a crowbar.<br><br>So, <i>is</i> there a story?

It looks like it could do with a Beta, at least. What are the criteria for invoking OFU<sup>2</sup>?<br><br>On another note, it&#39;s cool to see <i>The Ispace Wars</i> up, I enjoyed reading that again. I wonder how much of Ispace Mountain is going to left after the Administrator finishes knocking on Liliac&#39;s door?<br><br>I guess now that I&#39;m back on the Board I should really finish off my piece for that, unless you made other arrangements during my absence?

            <p>And I have no idea what&#39;s going on!<br><br>Well, OK, that&#39;s a slight exaggeration, but not all too much. Readers, if you have not read OFUDisc, there is a lot you will not know. Trust me, I have not read it, and I have a lot of questions that I know would be answered in OFUDisc. However, that&#39;s just the first chapter. Perhaps in later chapters it will split further from the OFU, which I certainly hope it does. However, while waiting for the next part, you may want to read OFUDisc.</p>

            <p>Sounds vaguely interesting, actually. Maybe I can charm animals into doing my bidding with my voice and/or hypnotic dance skills? (Seriously, Disney!Esmeralda was a <i>good dancer</i>.) <br><br>I could be from any fantasy continuum! That&#39;s the best part! I probably wouldn&#39;t be a luster, though; not too many fictional crushes. I think I&#39;d be more of a &quot;Best Friend Sue&quot;.

            <p>Since the surname is Potter, I will recast my Stu self as Dreaded Master Potter the Undying. He will insist to all of his mind-controlled underlings that &quot;Master&quot; is his real first name, and thus they should refer to him as such both in the formal and casual senses, though deep in their minds, buried somewhere in the vestigial portion of themselves that still experiences free will even under the unending torrent of Aura of Smooth, every one of them will doubt him. Some will even laugh. Well, laugh as best they can with the mind-clamp that prevents them from making fun of him in place. I imagine Krystal Potter would have a number of issues about mockery of his name, so that clamp would be the first thing he patches into his mind-control field.</p>

            <p>I just picked names of Sues I&#39;ve seen out of my brain. Arianna and Raven and Seraphina are fairly common names, as are things like gemstones and nature. <br><br>I did swap some of the names around (like I had Malfoy, Potter and Dumbledore all close to each other at first, but I wanted to space them out a bit) but mostly I went down the list, putting in the first Sueish name that came to mind.</p>

            <p>But first, my Sue name: Felina Silver the Light. Could also claim &quot;of Rohan&quot; if I wanted to use my maiden name.<br><br>So, Gary Stus. In my observations, Stus tend not to have overly flowery names. The name might make a statement about who they are, what they&#39;re about, etc., and they might use a code-name instead of their real name, and they might steal the name of a cool canon character; but otherwise any suitably tough-sounding guy name will do. Here are some I&#39;ve thought of or lifted from the Slain Mary Sues category:<br><br>1. Shadow<br>2. Blade<br>3. Jack<br>4. John<br>5. Viper<br>6. Steel<br>7. Blaze<br>8. Spike<br>9. Angel<br>10. Matrix<br>11. Mace<br>12. Ronin<br><br>Last names will probably be descriptive, stolen, or not exist at all, because one-word names are badass. You could also forgo a first name and just pick one of these. Here are some ideas:<br><br>1. (too cool for a last name)<br>2. the Wolf<br>3. Silverblade<br>4. the Hedgehog<br>5. Freeman<br>6. 3000<br>7. Black Death [yes, I have actually seen this]<br>8. Skywalker<br>9. X<br>10. (way too cool for a last name)<br>11. the Wanderer<br>12. the Gunslinger<br><br>Middle names... eh, not likely. So, what other Stuish first and last names can we come up with?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Because if so, I think it <i>might</i> be worthy of carrying the Hawk 3000 name. If not, the best it&#39;ll probably be able to get is somewhere along the lines of Hawk 2400, especially since its wings appear to be attached to its tail by one of those flight feathers/batlike finger extensions.

            <p>Seriously, imagining the agents running into their Sue&#39;d and/or Stu&#39;d versions of themselves is funny enough as it is- but Nume meeting Esmeralda Trixie Evenstar? *dies*<br><br>I wasn&#39;t expecting this to become so popular! It was just a derpy idea that plopped into my head while one of my friends was showing me some Moon Moon memes.<br><br>Also, congrats to your brother! Give him a hug/high five from me and tell him it&#39;s from a random person you met on the internet who is friendly to everyone as long as face-to-face encounters aren&#39;t necessary.

            <p>I&#39;m actually American, I moved to the UK after we got married.<br><br>As for how we got together . . . this was before Facebook was even launched, let alone open to the public. It was all the way back in the dark age where people used chat programmes (I think we started on MSN Messenger, LOL forever). After we&#39;d had a few conversations on the Board, I added hS to my contacts. And we talked A LOT. At one point I had literally thousands and thousands and thousands of pages in my transcripts file.<br><br>We didn&#39;t actually meet until a few years later; he visited me in the US after I turned eighteen. And then we got married a few months after that. And then a few months after that I made the leap over the pond. And now here we are -- old, married and boring. Let this stand as a warning to all. ;)<br><br>Iximaz, my parents did flip out. It&#39;s entirely possible that they&#39;re still gently rotating through the air, in fact. Bless them.<br><br>(Uh, I should probably put a responsible-adult disclaimer for any teenagers reading: always be careful who you meet from the internet, do your best to weed out any axe-murderering truck drivers, take your parents along. Not everyone is who they claim to be, and even if they&#39;re telling the truth they might not be safe people. There has definitely been at least one predator on the PPC. He&#39;s not been a PPCer for years, but he did lasting harm to quite a few girls before he left.<br><br>There we go, that was my stab at responsible adulthood for the day.

            <p>I&#39;m all for people trying to get the badges - I actually added the Agent and Flower ones myself - but editing purely for the sake of editing... isn&#39;t a terribly good idea. It clogs up the &#39;recent changes&#39; page, for one thing, and it&#39;s also... well, basically a waste of time.<br><br>Which isn&#39;t to say you can&#39;t do <i>something</i>. Ekyl and Neshomeh both have their current &#39;projects&#39; - Nesh is trying to eliminate useless redirects, Ekyl is (among other things) changing all references to &#39;Crashing Down&#39; to be descriptive. I&#39;m just starting my Great Readthrough, which involves adding references to all the articles relevant to my stories.<br><br>So if you want to do a lot of editing, I&#39;d suggest finding something like that. Going through Agent pages and adding the tag for no stories, say, or the Reference Needed tag (though don&#39;t go wild with that). If you&#39;re comfortable with how to enter references, picking a PPC series you enjoy reading and starting your own Great Readthrough would be a brilliant move, too - it involves nothing more than reading each story, noting down each fact that should be on the Wiki, then checking if they are, and adding (if necessary) and referencing them. Refs aren&#39;t very hard to do, either.<br><br>But just going through and adding &#39;is&#39; or whatever where it&#39;s not really needed? I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. In fact, I&#39;d do the opposite.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>In this case, I&#39;m not really sure why you&#39;d need to edit Agent Neshomeh&#39;s page, since I&#39;ve already got a link to &quot;Brown DragonRider&quot; on there and I&#39;ve said as much as I want to say about it.<br><br>I guess that&#39;s kinda how I feel about it in general—if Oaken doesn&#39;t see a need to include a comparison of the two characters&#39; hair color on Morrigan&#39;s page, it&#39;s a bit presumptuous for Lacksi to second-guess him. However, Lacksi can write whatever she wants on Remora&#39;s page, so if she really wants to make that comparison, that&#39;s the place to do it. Lacksi can also contact Oaken directly and say &quot;Hey, I noticed this thing and I think it&#39;s cool! Do you think it should go on your agent&#39;s page?&quot;<br><br>As far as refs go, my basic assumption is that anything on an individual writer&#39;s agent page is sourced to the mission logs/appearances by default, so referencing isn&#39;t necessary unless it&#39;s something crazy out of left field (like what, I don&#39;t know). That said, adding links is good—just let the other guy do it for his own pages unless he&#39;s unwilling or unable.<br><br>When it comes to shared characters who&#39;ve been passed around a lot, like Makes-Things and Lux, refs are a good idea so we can keep straight what came from where and can know at a glance that the &quot;facts&quot; about them haven&#39;t been invented on the fly.<br><br>As for inactive characters, fleshing out their pages is good, and &quot;automatically sourced to the missions/appearances&quot; still applies. You&#39;re restricted to what&#39;s actually on the page, so the articles may never be very long, but that&#39;s okay.<br><br>Does that cover it, and also make sense? These are just the conclusions I&#39;ve come to playing it by ear all this time, so if we want to come up with some kind of codified guidelines that are different, I&#39;m open to that. Historically, some people have gotten very tetchy about having their characters&#39; pages messed with, but if we want to say &quot;no, it&#39;s a wiki, everyone can edit everything equally and you can always change anything you don&#39;t like,&quot; that&#39;s not an invalid position. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d advocate for it, but just putting it out there.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I take your point. One final question - what about people who are absolutely active in the community, but just... don&#39;t edit the Wiki? Like, um, me, until recently. Should we be bugging them to do so? Doing it for them? Or letting their agents&#39; pages stand at &#39;Cadeline Rho is an agent of the PPC.&#39;?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>For the past ~5 days, Webs.com - who host all my websites - have been suffering from a DDOS attack. They didn&#39;t go <i>down</i>, but their sites ran slowly enough that a slow internet connection will actually time out before it gets through. I can confirm this, because my sites didn&#39;t work at home (we&#39;re in a very slow area), but <i>did</i> work at work.<br><br>The CSS that defines the Board is stuck on one of my Webs sites.

            <p>If I get permission to begin missions, I am thinking of going into the Department of Mary Sues. Why? Well, for two reasons. 1) I have had the misfortune of coming across (and quite possibly creating a few) Mary Sues during my fanfiction &quot;career&quot;. 2) The flash badge for the Department of Mary Sues is a potted cactus, and I am from Texas where cactus is our native plany.<br><br>Before I start, however, I have a few questions to ask before I begin making plans.<br><br>1) When I create Agents, do I have to go into any great detail regarding where they came from? I have several possible Agents already planned out, and most of them come from fics with no names.<br><br>2) Are the Department of Mary Sues and the Department of Mary Sue Experimentation and Research known to work together? Because one of my ideas involves a member of the DMSEandR providing technical assistance and giving strategic advice, as well as analytical assistance into the mission&#39;s fic.<br><br>3) Another idea I have for an Agent for the DMS is a semi - reformed Mary Sue assassin. I want to satirize the concept of Mary Sues, and yet still make her a three dimensional character who can carry into the Imaginations Collide series I am working on. <br><br>So the question for point 3 is can I do that? Is it possible to make a Mary Sue be an obvious Mary Sue, and yet still make her a three dimensional character? <br><br>4) So torture is bad. Okay. But what about psychological torture? What about playing with the target&#39;s head, using what the Agents found out about them to manipulate the target Sue into accidentally killing herself? I&#39;m sure the whole &quot;Mary-Sue-accidentally-kills-herself&quot; thing has been used before, but what if it were portrayed in a slightly darker way? Now, not too dark, obviously, but with a lean that is more toward the depravity of the author of the mission than is traditional?<br><br>Those are all my random questions for today. If anyone has answers to only some of these, go ahead and just focus on one. Whatever floats the boat best. Or, you could just go all out and answer them all.<br><br>Cheers! (As my Scottish grandmother says.) </p>

            <p>1) When I asked for Permission, I wrote about a hundred words about each of my agents - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FP07_52pLW2Q61WlDlwz9MLNC5bToNbUQCrnzq3iuq0/edit">and since I got it I assume that&#39;s OK.</a> Agents can come from pretty much everywhere.<br>2) AFAIK DMSE&amp;R are more &#39;dissect those weird(er) Sues the Agents throw our way&#39; and less mission control, but you can have a Voice With an Internet Connection - just have a character stay in the RC and communicate with the Agents somehow.

            <p>1) So, the fics of origin don&#39;t have to actually exist, and I don&#39;t necessarily have to go into much detail about them? Okay, cool.<br><br>2) I&#39;m sure I can think of something. What I have in mind as of yet is a scientist who had been in field work for many years who wants to find a way to break a Mary Sue and make them less &quot;speshiul&quot;, or whatever the phrase is. He captures one and somehow successfully does this, but he can&#39;t remember how he did this. So he needs to find another test subject. Meanwhile, the Sue he had manages to turn has to be under constant monitoring. And since the scientist knows so much about Mary Sues, he provides Intel on the target via walkie talkie, or the RC communicator, or something like that.<br><br>3) Alright, sweet! Yeah!<br><br>4) Alright, then it will be more like pranks, or something more innocent like that. I&#39;ll come up with something. Something without any kind of torture.</p>

            <p>If you do, you give them the potential to angst, and that just makes them stronger. Bad idea!<br><br>However... <br><br>It&#39;s entirely warranted to make them look utterly silly, especially when your agents are particularly annoyed and want revenge. That&#39;s the one thing they can&#39;t stand, you see--they need to be speshul and perfect and have the story revolve around them. Relegate them to comic relief, and your agents might get some much-needed laughter from the situation.<br><br>It&#39;s not a routine part of a mission, and agents aren&#39;t really supposed to interact with the Sue any more than they have to. Still, agents do a lot of things they aren&#39;t technically supposed to do--like taking photo albums full of shots of Rivendell, for example--and this is one of the more harmless things they might do. If, on occasion, an agent decides that a Sue&#39;s urple ball gown needs a few stinging nettles woven into it... well, the Flowers aren&#39;t going to bother with disciplining them for that. Agents need to let off steam once in a while.<br><br>It is a good idea to have your agents do more than just watch the fic and vomit at the appropriate moments. It&#39;s not an MST; it&#39;s a mission. Get the agents involved, play off the crazy in the fic, and turn it into a proper story.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the advice here. I&#39;ll be sure to keep it in mind. And I&#39;ll be sure to avoid the torture. That will be more for the darker parts of Imaginations Collide, which I may or may not have happen often, depending on the Mary Sue in question.</p>

            <p>Hello loves. :) If it isn&#39;t obvious, this is my first time here. I go by The Baron (although my &quot;full name&quot; is Baron Hotschaft Von Hugenstein; Mortal Instruments fans may get the reference). The lovely Iximaz (whom I know in the real world) put in a good word about this new stretch of Internetdom and suggested I investigate--and, being both an avid fan and evader of fanfiction due to my zero-tolerance level of crappy writing, I thought I&#39;d do so. :)<br><br>FANDOMS (in order of obsession): Doctor Who, Sherlock, The Mortal Instruments, The Fault in Our Stars (and other John Green tales), Supernatural, Harry Potter, Percy  Jackson, Divergent, The Fantastic Foursome (and other big-name British YouTubers), The Most Popular Girls in School (also YouTube), and The Hunger Games.<br><br>I also enjoy writing original stories and songs, playing piano and guitar, avoiding eye contact with most people, collecting fandom-y pins for my pin hat, eating Oreo pudding, and sleeping.<br><br>Feel free to talk to me. :)</p>

            <p>I say this as an American: I really have no idea why American football gets exclusive rights to the name &quot;football&quot; here when the word fits soccer so much better. Baseball has bases as a central component of scoring points and winning the game. Likewise with basketball, and racketball, and volleyball(a volley isn&#39;t a physical object, but it counts as something important, and it&#39;s something that happens to the ball), and the ones that don&#39;t have &quot;ball&quot; in the name are usually named with something crucial to the game in mind. Feet aren&#39;t that iconic an element to American football. I mean, neither form of football would work if you had <i>no</i> feet, but that&#39;s how it is for most sports. You don&#39;t get much of a sense of how important feet are to the progression of the game in American football. In association football, feet are kind of the whole gimmick of the sport, which makes it a little odd that it&#39;s referred to as the contracted &quot;soccer&quot; in this one location. I guess it&#39;s like the use of yards as a unit of measurement rather than the more universal meters. America likes to say it&#39;s special when talking to the other countries.<br><br>Besides, there can be so many better names for American football! Tackleball! Rushball! Helmetball!<br>I had intended those as a joke, but rushball actually sounds like a good sport name.</p>

            <p>Being 1, 4, 9, 10, 11, and the War Doctor, I&#39;m not lying when I say that I love all of them. Equally? Well... ^_^ I won&#39;t lie, I also find Tennent attractive, but the funny thing is is that this one guy I&#39;m head over heels for looks almost exactly like Tennent- and I liked that guy before I started watching Doctor Who. So I&#39;m a reverse fangirl?<br><br>But to be really honest, any Doctor that mentions Harry Potter and J.K.

            <p>That means that the first seven Doctors would never have even gotten a chance to be your favorite, since they were replaced before the Harry Potter series even came out! Then again, most of the Classic Who Doctors don&#39;t really seem like the sort of people who would make a reference to it in the first place, except maybe Four. Well, Seven might.

            <p>And you never know, five might have made a reference. (Assuming, of course, that HP had been published at the time.)<br><br>The point I was trying to make was that most of my love for Tennent was a result of the references. Though he convinced me he&#39;d be a good Doctor with the &#39;barefoot on the moon&#39; scene.<br><br>I am glad they&#39;ve decided to have an older regeneration of the Doctor. It&#39;s kind of like they&#39;re going back to their roots; funny but of trivia, Hartnell and Capaldi are/were both 55 when they first appeared as the Doctor. Anyway, hopefully this&#39;ll dissuade the fangirls who only care about the HAWT young Doctors- hey, look! A flying pig!<br></p>

            <p>Apparently, I&#39;m bad at it. I liked the Tenth Doctor&#39;s references, too. How do I prove myself... I know! Here&#39;s Ten <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjz-ynF2o34">quoting from The Lion King!</a> The Christmas Invasion is still the best Doctor Who Christmas special.<br><br>I&#39;ve heard rumors that Moffat was going to leave the show after Series Eight(hooray!), but he&#39;d kill of Twelve before he left. I hope that&#39;s not true. We&#39;ve already had a Doctor&#39;s run cut tragically short with Nine, and having an incarnation of the Doctor written out of the show because the producer is leaving instead of the other way around would be horrible. Twelve being older means that there&#39;d be so much potential for a new dynamic between the Doctor and his companions after two Doctors in a row that the companions keep falling in love with, and I wouldn&#39;t want to see that rushed or ended abruptly to make way for another regeneration story when we only just had one recently.</p>

            <p>I hope it&#39;s true, though. Even if Moffat had been a good writer, which he hasn&#39;t been in years, he&#39;s been showrunner for four years now, and has created three seprate season-long driving plots that he had complete or near-complete creative control of. It&#39;s time someone else got to have a little fun with the show. Maybe they can ret-retcon the mess Moffat made on the Day of the Doctor.<br><br>I miss Nine too. The worst part is that Eccleston had initially been planned to stay around for three seasons, but resigned after the first because of problems on the set. Can you imagine what the show would have been like if he&#39;d been around for <i>three whole seasons</i>? We would&#39;ve gotten to see the Ninth Doctor versus the Cybermen!</p>

            <p>Actually, what I have in mind is a sort of original story that dances between the Twilight Saga and the Harry Potter series. I will create original characters from both franchises and team them together to fight against a villain that wishes to subjugate wizards, vampires and Muggles all at once. I will eventually give the canon characters cameos and such, but the focus will be on OC&#39;s.<br><br>I think it&#39;s fairly safe to say that I do fanfiction a little different from most other people. Too often Crossovers are about romance, or are romance centric. You know what I mean?</p>

Part I is subtitled “Lost Luster,” after Volt Luster, its main character. Part II’s central character will be Lync Volan. The puns basically write themselves (“Missing Lync,” “A Lync Between Worlds,” etc.); the only issue is choosing one that I like.<br><br>Here is where I&#39;d appreciate some help: Please make up some suggestions for a subtitle for Part III. The characters for Part III are Mylene Farrow (also known as “Mylene Pharaoh”) and Shadow Prove (pronunciation note: the “o” is long, as in “boat”). Can you make up a sufficiently punny subtitle using one (but preferably both) of the characters’ names? (And if you feel like just giving a silly entry, do so!

            <p>I was reading through Araeph&#39;s missions, and am curious to know what, if anything, happened to Wilma Turner, the girl!Will from Araeph&#39;s mission Caribbean Ding-Dong. If nothing has happened to Wilma, what is our policy on using her in missions? Araeph has been away from the Board for an unfortunately long time, so asking her directly for permission to use the character is unlikely, but it still feels wrong to just use someone else&#39;s character. So, what do we do in this scenario?</p>

            <p>Most of the exceptions come when the author of a mission has something specific in mind for their recruits, since they would naturally get first dibs on the new character that they introduced. Obviously, you should try to contact whoever originally wrote the mission before using the character if you can, not only because it&#39;s good to get their okay on this sort of thing, but also because if you missed something in your background research, the character could have been loaned out to someone else you&#39;d never heard of and future stories would be going against the character&#39;s previously established history, or the author could have decided on the Board at the time to put them in a specific location and you just didn&#39;t know because the Board recently wiped out all pre-2013 posts for some reason.<br>But, if you&#39;re interested and there are no protests to using a previously recruited but until now unrealized character, you should be able to do so. Or, you and/or the original mission writer could even make whoever it is into a free-to-use character, so that anyone can write about them whenever they want. We don&#39;t have a lot of free-to-use characters right now aside from the Flowers, which is unfortunate. It&#39;s a shared universe, and so it makes sense that there would be more than a handful of shared characters.<br><br>To directly answer your question, I don&#39;t think anything has happened to Wilma Turner since she was first recruited, like what happens to most of the characters found on missions. I&#39;ve had plans for a while to just make a gigantic list of our unrealized recruits and post it under Adoptable NPC on the wiki, but it&#39;s going to have to wait, since I&#39;ll need a few days that I&#39;m not juggling six things do do at once and can get down to a reasonable three or four.</p>

            <p>Watch RWBY.  Just do it.  It has humour, action, gunblades, monsters, magic, a secondary magic system, a really interesting moon, good animation for the most part, animal people, a combat school, EPIC music (so, so, SO EPIC), Combat Skirts, dinosaur easter eggs, it&#39;s produced by roosterteeth and MONTY OUM, and is getting serious in the next volume.  Also may I mention that the creator is supportive of fanfiction, may or may not include a fan made character later on, and has already held a design contest for the battle gear of one character, who was originally supposed to be a bit character that appeared twice, but is now a full fledged character because of fan popularity?  Also, REALLY EPIC FIGHTING.  REALLY.  REALLY.  EPIC.  I say epic, but in the non-slang sense, it has fairly short episodes, and only one &#39;volume&#39; in the first season, if I understand the system right.  Also mysterious back-stories, and weapons even more epic than the fighting. for example...<br><br>Crescent Rose, a High Calibre Sniper Scythe (HCSS), touted as one of the most dangerous weapons ever conceived.<br><br>Myternaster, a rapier with a revolver mechanism that allows the powering up of her attacks with elemental magic.<br><br>Magnhild, a warhammer/grenade launcher.  &#39;Nuff said.<br><br>Gambol Shroud, part Cleaver, part Glock-18, part Katana/Ninjato/generic Japanese sword, part Kusarigama, and all awesome.<br><br>Ember Cecilia, shotgun gauntlets that have either concussive or long range projectile ammo.<br><br>Ruyi Bang &amp; Jingu Bang, a staff that spits into shotgun nunshucks.  Once again, &#39;nuff said.<br><br>If that doesn&#39;t convince you, I don&#39;t know WHAT will.</p>

            <p>Even the Krull Glaive worked well in-universe, and that thing would do more damage to its wielder than to the enemy in literally any other context.<br><br>Anyway, the Crescent Rose is still enormously impractical. It shapeshifts and apparently weighs nothing at all, so the functionality gets a bit of a break due to plot boosting, but speaking in terms of usability, sweet Sobchak would that be hard to maintain. The mass conservation systems alone would play havoc on its ability to do <i>anything</i> if they were damaged even slightly. The blade would be damaged every time she fires one of those gun-scythe blasts since there&#39;s nowhere else for the recoil to go with her rooting it into the ground like she does and whatever she&#39;s shooting is apparently a high enough caliber to gib a wolf in one hit. Good luck pulling off that &quot;just shot another round at such an angle as to decapitate someone&quot; move if you&#39;ve damaged the blade or its join enough to bring either out of alignment. If you end up hitting the wrong spot when that blade starts going through bone, the gun recoil is going to snap the end off.<br><br>In context, the characters not constantly shrouded in darkness are apparently magic or something, but it&#39;s never explained how or why everything is so indestructible, not even a handwaved &quot;precursor material&quot; or &quot;PKE-enhanced&quot; or something. I watched most of the first season yesterday since the episodes are apparently only five to ten minutes long each, and there was still nothing, which just strikes me as kind of silly. Even Star Trek would blame new weird space stuff on poliustic shield fluctuations in the beta waves of the engineering deck or something. The closest there was to any explanation was a mention of &quot;the power of dust&quot; in an exposition dump in the first episode, which was never elaborated on except for a later appearance that showed it was highly combustible.<br><br>I don&#39;t hate the series, before you take this the wrong way. I am just the sort of person who notices things like this. After the first episode&#39;s cavalcade of what-is-going-on moments and absolute bullcrap(a fifteen-year-old forged a mass-altering shapeshifting weapon by herself? Out of what, Makuta armor?), everything started to get much better, and most of the first episode&#39;s nonsense was either completely forgotten or explained better later, save Silly Cigar Guy With A Grenade-Launching Cane That The Penguin Would Call A Bad Idea, who is apparently going to be a recurring antagonist. Also, Yang was introduced after the first episode, and Yang is the best. I know I say things are &quot;the best&quot; a lot, but I don&#39;t say it as a ranking. Sometimes a character just deserves to be called the best.</p>
