            <p>Hm, okay. I&#39;m not actually sure if any of you are familiar with Lemony Snicket&#39;s most recent series, All The Wrong Questions. It&#39;s really rather good, and I encourage you to read it if you haven&#39;t already.<br>Anyway, I&#39;m attempting to write a crossover story between All The Wrong Questions and Doctor Who involving Lemony, Moxie, Cleo, Jake (and of course Ellington) meeting the 7th Doctor and Ace in the midst of a mystery. Of course, interesting things happen and there&#39;s a kidnapping, and a cat. But I&#39;m still looking for a beta. Even if you&#39;re only slightly familiar with 7th Doctor it would be great.<br><br>The fanfic is tentatively titled &quot;Where Could It Possibly Have Gone?&quot;<br><br>With all due respect,<br>Kitty</p>

            <p>Hello!<br><br>*coughs nervously*<br><br>So I&#39;m back! Kind of.<br><br>Got a bit devoured by life for a bit, but I saw the date, was reminded of a bad canon of the past, and went &quot;hey wait wasn&#39;t this the same calender date as the first day I posted on the PPC forums?&quot;<br><br>And lo, it was.<br><br>I&#39;m also deathly afraid of forums. So this&#39;ll be fun. <br><br>Oh boy, where do I begin. Well, since I vanished off the map, I&#39;m still in the lovely PNW, albeit briefly. But I&#39;m hopefully moving to the UK soon, to the green northernly bit. Although those of you who have known me these past five years know I&#39;ve been &quot;moving to the UK&quot; for about that long. But hey, this year I really feel it. I have a paying job (sometimes) and I have most of my paperwork in order, except for the citizen registration papers. <br><br>Uhhhh... haven&#39;t written much. Haven&#39;t done much at all but work and panic. <br><br>But I do work with 3d printing, now! And I just saw the third hobbit movie today. (I&#39;m surprised less people aren&#39;t frothing at the mouth about it on here.) It was. Alright. First twenty minutes were hobbit, last two hours or so were ??Silmarillion?? *makes ????? noises*<br><br>Anyway I&#39;m in the #PPC chatroom right now, just kinda lingering with intent. Will be for the next like, hour or so. So... yeah. <br><br>Five years. That&#39;s more than a quarter of my lifetime. I was a snot nosed squidling when I wandered in here. And now I&#39;m almost a responsible member of adult society.<br><br>Holy cow, guys.<br><br>Here&#39;s to many more!<br><br>*Disperses various beverages of questionable booze content depending on the drinker.*</p>

            <p>Good to see you again!  Glad you&#39;re making the moneys, and that you&#39;re getting closer to the Big Move!  3D printing is fancy~!<br><br>I actually saw <i>Five Armies</i> in Boston with Araeph and Fractal Dawn earlier this week.  I got treated to a long explanation of Everything Wrong by Fractal on the walk back to the subways; my Tolkien knowledge is not up to par in this community.  My main problem with the film is that, being based only on the climax and denouement of the novel, it&#39;s basically one long, tense fight scene with hardly any breather moments.  It wasn&#39;t as fun as most of the other . . . anything Tolkien.  Yeah.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a long and actually pretty good fanfic where Thorin uses a pool in the Dwarvish afterlife to spy on the events of the War of the Ring. It got extremely popular, and it utilized the term extensively, so it&#39;s likely that this fic, with its research and world building on the Dwarves, spawned or spurred on the trend.</p>

            <p>...&quot;dwarrow&quot; is the historical plural for &quot;dwarf&quot; in the word&#39;s home mythology (Norse, I think?). Tolkien called his pluralization into &quot;dwarves&quot; a bit of &quot;personal bad grammar&quot;, but it seems to have been kept in order to match the pluralization of &quot;elf&quot; into &quot;elves&quot;. Thanks, Wikipedia!<br><br>This doesn&#39;t excuse &quot;dwarrowdam&quot;, though, because that still isn&#39;t anywhere.</p>

            <p>To channel my frustration into something constructive, I decided to write a two-part ficlet.  Chapter 1 - lure unsuspecting Suethors in, making them think it is another &quot;girl falls into Middle-earth&quot; fic.  Chapter  - the girl meets very logical death in the not so logical world.  <br><br>I posted the first part, I will give it a few days and then post the second chapter (still to be written). :)<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10907451/1/Beware-of-Your-Dreams"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10907451/1/Beware-of-Your-Dreams">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10907451/1/Beware-of-Your-Dreams</a></a></p>

            <p>As far as I know, the only time the word &quot;dwarrow&quot; appears in Tolkien&#39;s writings is in &quot;Dwarrowdelf&quot;, which is probably the influence behind this...lovely?...new term. <br><br>A quick Google search shows it only showing up in Hobbit-related fanfic.

            <p>Hi, Hellga! It&#39;s always nice to see you again. ^_^<br><br>And, as my incredulous reaction may have told you, I&#39;ve never heard the term &quot;dwarrowdams&quot; before and I have no idea where it came from. I haven&#39;t been following the <i>Hobbit</i> fandom that closely, and I kinda get the sense that that was a good life choice. O.o<br><br>That said, if you have any particularly heinous fics to report, you might find me a willing sporker. Or, if not me, then someone.<br><br>Welcome back!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Thanks for welcoming, Neshomeh!  :)<br><br>Yes, and the term just upset me so much more than She-Elf ever did. Though I must say, average level of Hobbit-fanfic is even lower than that of the LotR-fanfic. At least, back then there were some decent fics in the mix, now I didn&#39;t see any.   Can&#39;t say anything is really terrible, just average stupid Sues joining quest and all varieties of slash... </p>

            <p>Been a while. :)<br><br>I personally think someone was just trying to be alliterative with &quot;dwarrowdam,&quot; and the word got carried away. I, too, find it much worse than she-elf considering the definition of &quot;dam&quot;:<br><br>noun<br>1. a female parent (used especially of four-footed domestic animals).<br><br>Ooh yeah, way to show respect to the Dwarven women!<br><br>Also infuriating is that fanwriters--even otherwise articulate ones--constantly use the word &quot;dwarrows.&quot; That&#39;s like saying &quot;deers&quot; or &quot;mices&quot;! Just goes to show that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. <br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>Yes, I am trying to pretend that whomever coined the term was thinking of the Middle English meaning &quot;lady&quot; but still, the result makes me want to feed her to Azog&#39;s warg. <br><br>And yeah, dwarrows is ridiculous.  Why not use words that Tolkien did?  Oh wait, they probably just watched the movies and read Wikipedia, not actual Tolkien...</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9136030/1/Conker-s-Other-Bad-Fur-Day">Conker&#39;s Other Bad Fur Day</a> by Dream the Fox<br>Description from Author: Set after Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day. Conker&#39;s still upset about Berri&#39;s death and wants her back. When Gregg tells him how to do it, Conker, along with some friends, head off on a new adventure to bring Berri back. My first Conker story. R&amp;R and NO FLAMES.<br>Anonymouse&#39;s Notes: This fic was named after, and intends to replace, <i>Conker&#39;s Other Bad Fur Day</i>, Rare&#39;s planned sequel to Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day that was fully scripted but never made it off paper because &quot;Microsoft never asked for it&quot;. What appalls me is that the author knows enough to name it after that game but never bothered to look up the released details- like King Conker being dethroned and almost executed due to blowing his kingdom&#39;s treasury on alcohol, and Berri coming back as a Terminator-like antagonist. Also, it&#39;s fishy when the author gives away the whole plot in one line of dialog from one character, and even more fishy when they never even use his proper name- the Grim Reaper&#39;s name is Gregg in this game, people. Gregg. Not &quot;the reaper.&quot; And he&#39;s not in charge of the afterlife, just the proper &quot;harvesting&quot; of the dead, like all Grim Reapers- so he wouldn&#39;t have time to get annoyed by Berri.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/442721/1/Revolt">Revolt</a> by TheOgeeBoogieMan<br>Description from Author: Jenkins E. Weaselov, the son of the professor, has mustered up a second reich [<i>sic</i>]this time much more serious than the last. I&#39;m also going into depth to explain certain aspects of the game.<br>Anonymouse&#39;s Notes: This fic is apparently set after the events of Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day/Conker: Live and Reloaded, which seems to be a popular topic. First off, spatial distortion noted right in the first chapter&#39;s author&#39;s notes, but the fic after that was surprisingly readable, until I realised that Conker himself is very, VERY out of character, being far too qualified for a government job than he ought to be- and ASKING HIS GUARDS TO ASK SOMETHING FROM DON WEASO. Er, sorry, it&#39;s &quot;Weaselo.&quot; Just for the record, and sorry if I spoil a ten-year-old game for you, but Don Weaso murders Berri in cold blood right in front of Conker in the finale, and even in this fic he&#39;s upset about her death, so not holding Don at least partially responsible for her not being there- and thus NOT HATING HIS GUTS- is infuriatingly out of character in and of itself.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1072508/1/Friend-In-Need-Professor-s-POV">Friend in Need Professor&#39;s POV</a> by Julie Riley aka Julayla Beryl [<i>sic</i>]<br>Description from Author: This is the Professor&#39;s version on how he met up with Nack. It might have words you might not understand since he&#39;s german. Hope you like it though. (Finished)<br>Anonymouse&#39;s Notes: Nack? Who is- Ohhh. Oh, right, Nack, that one Sonic character that I totally forgot was a Conker character as well. Silly me. Evident from the Author&#39;s Notes is that he stole &quot;Weaselov&quot; (an apparently non-canon last name) from Mr. TheOgeeBoogieMan up there, and evident from the first full paragraph is that although this is not marked as a crossover, Julie here decided that the Conkerverse is on Mobius- in other words, the entire Conkerverse is inside the Sonicverse. Oh, and it&#39;s hard to read because the narrator is the Professor with his constant German accent. There are other POV&#39;s of this fic, but this one is the one I got first.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/840380/1/Conkers-Scale-encounter">Conkers Scale encounter</a> by Ra88<br>Description from Author: Sigh...Conker never has peace, because now, a dragon dude called Tenka makes his entrance, creates a cheap T-Virus rip-off, and then tries to conquer Conk. O, yeah, Berri is back but she wants to kil him. An ordinary day in the life of a squirrel.<br>Anonymouse&#39;s Notes: Misspelled words and abuse- as opposed to neglect- of various forms of punctuation. Also, paragraphs huge enough to be f[EXPLETIVE REDACTED] bricks of text. I hope that &quot;Berri is back but she wants to kil [<i>sic</i>] him&quot; is evidence that Terminator Berri is in this fic, but I didn&#39;t get that far.</p>

You may not get all the references, as they apply to running gags used on both LPs and the forum.<br><br>I actually haven&#39;t been on the forum for a long time, for... reasons.

            <p>I gotta say that I disagree; I can&#39;t classify HPMoR as goodfic. Harry is massively OOC - even considering that this is a very different AU, he&#39;s completely replaced - and so is Hermione, the fic is a huge author&#39;s tract, Quirrel... isn&#39;t, Harry is some bloody OP Chessmaster, Harry&#39;s a jerk, Lily broke the Wizarding laws for Petunia but wasn&#39;t thrown into Azkaban, etc, etc.</p>

There is some swearing.<br><br><a href="http://www.whofic.com/viewstory.php?sid=22767">Most Likely Kill You In The Morning</a><br>This fic drew me in because of the title. If you don’t recognise it, it’s from The Princess Bride. I feel the need to put the quote that is at the beginning here. <br><i>“Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, &quot;All right, Westley, I&#39;ve never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I&#39;ll most likely kill you in the morning.&quot; Three years he said that. &quot;Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I&#39;ll most likely kill you in the morning.&quot; It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.”</i><br>This is what happens if the Doctor never came back from Girl in the Fireplace. Rose takes up his occupation, and meets old friends of his. It’s delightfully creepy and some bits will make you sob your eyes out. All of this author’s stuff is great, to be honest.<br><br><a href="http://www.whofic.com/viewstory.php?sid=38208">Fearful Symmetry</a><br>Oh wow. Where do I start? Looking at this fic again, I must say it is the best ever 11 fic I have read. The mystery character that I won’t tell you about otherwise it’ll ruin it is characterized perfectly. You’ve got the Doctor running in on Amy and Rory having... romantic... moments... and him attempting to wear a top hat. Brilliant dialogue, snappy and perfect, and I would like to submit this short section as proof.<br><i> “Oh my God…” Amy stared at the Time Lord in quiet horror: “What is that, that thing?”<br>“What?” The Doctor gaped in alarm and turned to look behind him. “Where? A thing in the TARDIS?” He ran around the console, flapping at every nook and cranny he could see in an effort to flush the interloper out: “Get out of it, thing! Go on! Bad thing! Naughty thing!”<br>“No,” Amy groaned, pointing at him; “on your head.”<br>“Oh, this?” The Doctor stopped and beamed, running a finger around the brim of his headgear with obvious satisfaction: “This old thing? Didn’t I tell you? I wear a top hat now. Top hats are—”<br>“No,” Amy told him, adamantly.<br>“Blimey, Rory,” said the Doctor, turning to his other companion for support. “Back me up here!”<br>“I…” Rory opened his mouth to speak, closed it again and then shook his head: “No, she’s right, it’s horrible. A bit like this shell-suit.”<br>“You’re only saying that because you’re scared of her,” the Doctor told him.<br>“No, I’m…” Rory hesitated again before nodding wretchedly. “Yeah. Yeah, I am.” </i><br>You also have the best plot this side of canon that can ever be done.

            <p>Well, it depends if you want to watch Classic or the Revival Series. I&#39;m a big fan of Classic myself- I just like the acting- but the Revival series is better with CGI and such.<br>If you want to watch Classic- I really liked Battlefield. And possibly the Masque of Mandragora.<br>For the New Series, you could start at Rose, since that was the first one and provides a bit of an opening for the rest of the series. If you prefer to start at Matt Smith&#39;s era, try The Eleventh Hour. <br>Moffat has been said to be a bit horrible at times, but he&#39;s <i>not that bad</i>. Just... don&#39;t get attached to any companions, huh?<br>Partners In Crime might work well for you... just as long as you know that the Doctor and Donna know each other already.<br></p>

            <p>I liked how you were able to flesh out your agents&#39; characters, especially E.V.L. She&#39;s pretty much how one would expect a Suvian agent to act! I hope to see a lot more of your work.<br><br>That said, I did catch a few things:<br><i>and even if we hate each others’ guts, I still need to know how you idiots do things around here</i><br>The apostrophe is in the wrong place. It should be should be &quot;each other<b><u>&#39;s</u></b> guts&quot;.<br><br><i>E.V.L. decided not to pose the obvious question about how dA treated MLP</i>:<br>I suggest that you cut the acronyms. Granted, it&#39;s easy to guess what you&#39;re talking about, but it might throw people off. <br><br><i>A second mini-Discord, Cadence, promptly </i>poof<i>-ed into existence next to the agents.</i><br>I don&#39;t think that the hyphen is needed.<br><br><i>“There never was any mention of how many alicorns the world could support at any one time,” the disguised ex-ficubus noted. “So that means this prophecy wouldn’t have been backed up by anything in the actual canon.”</i><br>It seems like E.V.L. is trying to make a good argument on the Sue&#39;s behalf; she&#39;s saying that the prophecy does not run afoul of canon.<br>If so, then the word that you&#39;ve used is the exact opposite of the word you want: you should use &quot;contradicted,&quot; not &quot;backed up.&quot;<br><br><i>“Neat use of a title drop, but no points for you, Tara,” E.V.L. sighed.</i><br>This sounds like a good comment, but the problem is that the <i>reader</i> does not know the context! What is the title that the Sue is dropping?<br><br><i>In the following chapter, the other ponies caught up with the Sue, upon which she told them about where Twilight was...</i><br>You&#39;re using the wrong prepositional phrase. Where you put &quot;upon which,&quot; what you really meant to say is &quot;whereupon&quot; or &quot;at which point&quot;.<br><br><i>“Now, roll over!” Rayner ordered. Cerberus roll over onto his back.</i><br>Tense shift. It should be &quot;roll<b>ed</b> over&quot;.<br><br><i>“Then why don’t you just transfer him in External Security?” E.V.L. growled. “That way, I’ll never have to see his stupid face ever again.”</i><br>Two issues. One, it should be &quot;transfer him <b>to</b> External Security&quot;.<br>Two; How does E.V.L. know about External Security?</p>

            <p>Good work! As someone who is still very new to the series (I&#39;ve only seen a few episodes of Season 1), this was very enjoyable and a fantastic mission to read. However, the text seemed very clustered together - I read most missions on my iPad, and my brain started confusing which line I was on after a while due to the spacing. Some more space between each different lines of dialogue would be great. <br><br>Overall, though - I loved the mission!</p>

            <p>(There&#39;s nothing wrong with a trope title.) Rayner&#39;s mean-spiritedness still comes across as weird to me. I know he&#39;s not supposed to be all rainbows and flowers, but... Is he going to mellow out at all in the forseeable future? (Also, remember to make Wiki profiles for him and E.V.L.)<br><br>I particularly liked the part where E.V.L. charged fake!Sombra and tried to fight him off. It really captured her overconfidence and relative inexperience with this whole PPC thing. (Also, what is the deal with her head? I thought it got reattached, why does she occasionally play with it? That&#39;s creepy even by her standards.)</p>

            <p>As noted on the cover page, this mission took place two months after, well... <i>that</i> one... and he had to recuperate in Medical the entire time. It&#39;s technically the second one since then (the one where he first met E.V.L. was the first, straight out of Medical in fact). He wasn&#39;t particularly happy about it. I plan for my second mission with this team to take place concurrently to my Floaters team&#39;s timeline (i.e. two months later), and yeah, I hope to have Rayner&#39;s mood to improve somewhat, partly due to making a new friend after this one (and no, his partner doesn&#39;t count).<br><br>Yeah, E.V.L.&#39;s Suvian mentality really did throw a Mankey wrench into the mission that was only barely cleared up due to Rayner&#39;s intervention. And as for her head, that was the result of a poorly worded metaphor for losing her temper (I&#39;m betting it would have been something like &quot;her head came completely off its shoulders&quot; or something). And I understand that Medical can probably regenerate severed limbs, but I don&#39;t think putting a typo-induced detached head back on would be doable, at least without grievous bodily harm to her. Besides, it would be fun to have her head fall off at the most embarrassing moments, too.<br><br>I&#39;ll probably take care of the Wiki profiles later today, along with putting the mission on the front page.</p>

Speaking of which, I am still owed a cake-- as in a “cake that was made by me for my grandmother’s birthday”.<br><br>SiliconChipEater: Okay, I’ll admit that one was my fault. I did say that anything in the kitchen was hers. So, are you going to help me?<br><br>SiliconChipEater: Hello?<br><br>SiliconChipEater: Did you seriously just bail on me here?<br><br>Colibri: Sorry-- AFK for a while. Nasir came over and dropped off his Pokйmon before his date with Penny. So where do you want to go this time? North America? Europe? Someplace tropical? I’ve got a lot of stuff planned for Europe-- especially around this time of the year. Even it it’s a little after Christmas some places still have their lights up: New Year’s is upon us and all. <br><br>SiliconChipEater: Well, preferably somewhere warm. Mei liked the South American trip that you planned last time but wanted somewhere even warmer. By the way, we took some great pictures at Machu Picchu, wanna see them?<br><br>Colibri: No thank you.  <br><br>Colibri: Might I suggest Hawai’i this time? It’s nice and tropical, everything is in English, and a lot of things in Waikiki are also translated into Japanese for tourists’ sake. <br><br>SiliconChipEater: Really? Now that’s pretty useful. Yeah, let’s go with Hawai’i. What is there to do there?<br><br>Colibri: There’s a fireworks show at scheduled at midnight tonight. If I were you, I’d pack a supper, walk on the beach with Mei until sunset, and have a picnic while watching the tourists mill around. I’d sit there until midnight, watch the fireworks, and then pack up and go home afterwards. <br><br>Colibri: My only concern would be to arrive on time for the next sorting shift: by my watch, you’d only have 2 hours left to sleep before we have to report at the Hub.<br><br>SiliconChipEater: I’ll manage. Any restaurants in the area? I’m really looking to impress this time. Sandwiches are good and all but I’m looking for the wow factor.<br><br>Colibri: Waikiki has a ton of good Japanese/Korean food. I’d suggest walking along Kalakaua Avenue and exploring the side streets if you have the time. If not, there’s a really good ramen place on Beachwalk Avenue. Can’t remember the name, though. <br><br>SiliconChipEater: Sounds good. Anything else I should know?<br><br>Colibri: Arrive early at the restaurant; chances are it will be jam-packed full after 5:30pm. I’m forwarding a part of my notes to you right now if you want to do some extra reading.<br><br>SiliconChipEater: You’re the best, De Grasse. By the way, what are you doing tonight? Partying it up? Meeting friends?<br><br>Colibri: Watching over Nasir’s Glaceon and Murkrow, actually. Grandma has gone over to visit some friends in World One and my parents are working the night shift. <br><br>SiliconChipEater: What, you’re gonna be alone?<br><br>Colibri: Nope. Juliane and Blacklight are going to watch some <i>Star Trek</i> with me. It’s a nice change of pace for once.<br><br>Colibri: Er, the Pokйmon, I mean.<br><br>SiliconChipEater: “For once.” <br><br>SiliconChipEater: When you scurry off and hide after work or between shifts are you really always alone? <br><br>Colibri: Well, I do a lot of things with my family but most of the time I’m alone, yes.<br><br>SiliconChipEater: Do I really smell that bad?<br><br>Colibri: No, it’s not that.<br><br>SiliconChipEater: What, then?<br><br>Colibri: I don’t want to be a bother. I haven’t got much to share and nobody likes a third wheel. I find that it’s better if I just keep to myself and not disturb anyone. <br><br>SiliconChipEater: May I ask a personal question?<br><br>Colibri: Go ahead.<br><br>SiliconChipEater: You were bullied at school, weren’t you?<br><br>[<i>Colibri has left the chat room</i>]<br><br>SiliconChipEater: Well, f*** me for trying to understand, right? Don’t think that you’re off the hook, De Grasse. I’ll talk to you when I get back; I’m turning off my phone now.<br><br>[<i>Colibri is currently offline. Your message will be sent to them upon their return.</i>]<br><br>[<i>SiliconChipEater has left the chat room</i>]<br><br>[<i>Colibri has joined the chat room</i>]<br><br>Colibri: I swear I logged off because Blacklight landed on my keyboard as I was typing my message. If it’s not too much trouble for you, I’d like to have a chat with you once you’re free.<br><br>[<i>SiliconChipEater is currently offline. Your message will be sent to them upon their return.</i>]<br><br>Colibri: And yes, I was bullied at school. With a face like mine, who could resist taking potshots at me, eh?<br><br>[<i>SiliconChipEater is currently offline.

            <p>I have found a truly terribeautiful textbook example of a Homestuck Sue.

            <p>...I&#39;ve decided, based on the feedback I have received, to <b>withdraw this story from the PPC canon.</b><br><br>The reason for this is twofold. Firstly, PoorCynic makes a very good point about <i>Disney Infinity</i> being completely different from *any* of the continua featured, especially with most of the story elements being changed to the point that they can&#39;t be considered canon to those continua. To be fair, I have not played that game even once (don&#39;t have the required equipment or any of the toys), so no, I am not familiar with that game, and I should have realized that when I wrote this. Again, I would gladly work on an OFU of some sort if I get the time, but it won&#39;t be for a very long while because of real-life reasons.<br><br>Secondly, and more importantly, the main pitch I had in my head when writing this story was, in fact, a series of stupid self-inflicted Mary Sue/Gary Stu deaths in a manner akin to <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1518794/1/The-Game-of-the-Gods">&quot;The Game of the Gods&quot;</a>. I now realize that in the context of multiple Disney continua, it simply doesn&#39;t work, even if some of the events from certain Disney canons can get pretty dark sometimes (the Feminist!Sue&#39;s death was based off that of Scar from <i>The Lion King</i>). As it stands now, though, it stands in stark contrast to both the canons featured and the fact that this was supposed to be a holiday special. I&#39;m reminded of that one fiasco from my first mission, particularly the death of that Character Replacement, though to be fair, it was in the context of a continuum where gore is somewhat expected. There is no such context here, and in hindsight, there was no way I could have work around that.<br><br>Finally, I will confess that I was being lazy, selfish, and reckless when I said what basically amounts to &#39;anyone can write this as long as they credit me&#39;. Again, I will reiterate that I have very little time as it is to write any OFUs, but that is not an excuse to pawn them off to other people, especially not one as broad in scope as this. What I said was uncalled for and I cannot apologize enough for it.<br><br>So, yeah. I&#39;ll edit the Wiki accordingly, and probably start work over with a much more innocuous holiday special in the future. Sorry, everyone! :(​</p>

            <p>This got rather opinionated, for which I apologize, but I feel it&#39;s an important thing to discuss.<br><br>I don&#39;t like the heavy focus on the gore of the Sue deaths.  Partly, this is because it flies in the face of how PPC agents do things.  Showy, dramatic displays of skill and arrogance are Sue things, not PPC things.  Now, I know some of these Sues&#39; deaths were brought about by canon characters, or, in the case of the chef Sue, her own illogical behavior, but you wrote those; hence, they are still deaths caused by a PPCer.<br><br>I think the worst example is the feminism Sue.  It actually starts out excellently: an agent and Sue in a Mexican standoff, with the tension suddenly being broken by another agent singing a Christmas Carol.  That&#39;s fantastic: there&#39;s danger there, but it gets interrupted by bizarre and slightly awkward humor.  Now Rashida has the opportunity to put a bullet through the temple, and the scene can go on—<br><br>Except that the scene doesn&#39;t go on.  Rashida disarms the Sue instead, giving said Sue the opportunity to fight back (read: show off and garner more screen time).  This fight then leads to a horrific accident involving parts of a <i>Christmas tree</i>, followed by a slow, loud death by being eaten alive by sentient predators while the Sue begs.<br><br>Here&#39;s a brief list of things I don&#39;t find funny or entertaining to read about:<br><br>-dying people begging for mercy<br>-a detailed description of someone being literally eaten alive<br>-someone&#39;s internal organs being punctured by ornaments from a Christmas tree, a symbol of bringing together my loved ones<br><br>I mean, this is sadistic.  To put this kind of scene in a story that a) purports to take place alongside some of Disney&#39;s animated canons, and b) in your obligatory Christmas episode is just very, very bothersome to me.  I would charge for a scene like this being included in a badfic for any of the canons you represented here.<br><br>But a further problem, to get back to what I was saying about that particular assassination: when you give a big, dramatic fight scene like this to a Sue, it&#39;s <i>reinforcing the Sue&#39;s power</i>, whereas the purpose of the PPC is to take away power from the Sue, and give it back to canon.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m not saying missions should never end in big, dramatic scenes, because there have been some good ones here and there.  But I find it more satisfying when a Sue is defeated, not because xir power was <i>matched</i>, by a stronger (more Suish) force, but because xir power was <i>subverted</i>, rendered immaterial in the grand scheme of the re-emerging canon.  (I know this wasn&#39;t a mission, and that the Sues were made up, but the treatment of them still matters.)<br><br>Now, you actually had an excellent example in your <i>Friendship Is Magic</i> mission below.  (And I apologize for not responding to both separately, but I read both during the same work shift, and I need to get to sleep.)  I liked the outcome you gave to E.V.L.&#39;s attempt to dispatch the replacement villain: E.V.L.&#39;s Suvian assumption of &quot;I do thing and succeed&quot; falling flat on it&#39;s face against the fully powered Sue is a great example of why taking on a Sue on xir own terms is a terrible idea, not only because it&#39;s dangerous for the agents, but because it gives the Sue a chance to shine even brighter than before.  The replacement&#39;s eventual successful assassination is better, as it involved a distraction, followed by stripping of the powers.  It&#39;s still marred, in my opinion, by the violence inherent in the scene (in a <i>My Little Pony</i> story!).  The snapping off of the horn I could have forgiven on its own, since it&#39;s a logical way to deprive a unicorn of xir magic, but coupled with the blood draining assassination method . . . it&#39;s just gross to read.  (How did that work, really?  Wasn&#39;t E.V.L.&#39;s head detached while she drank that blood?  Where did it go?)  I actually wasn&#39;t initially planning on commenting on it, since you gave signs at the end of that mission that both agents are due to have their powers hobbled, but I decided to bring it up, too, after reading the Christmas story.<br><br>Okay, I feel like I rambled maybe too much (and deleted a good deal of what I wrote, may it please thee).  Part of this got very opinionated, and again, I apologize for that, but I can only review from my own point of view, and sometimes it&#39;s unavoidable.  Let me just summarize what I was aiming for:<br><br>1. I&#39;m not saying never have dramatic fight scenes that show off a Sue&#39;s powers.  They can be fun, but they should be a sometimes food, like cookies or ketchup sandwiches; otherwise, they get tiresome and boring to read, and miss the point of the PPC-as-a-whole&#39;s problem with Sues.<br><br>2. I personally hate reading gore.  (Or watching it, but that&#39;s not relevant.)  It&#39;s especially off-putting in situations where it doesn&#39;t belong (kid-oriented continua, love-themed holidays, etc.).  Obviously, I can&#39;t stop you from being the violence-themed PPC spin-off, if that&#39;s what you like to write, but . . . I&#39;m unlikely to keep reading your work if it&#39;s going to continue featuring scenes of this borderline-sadistic nature.  That&#39;s just how I feel.</p>

            <p>Before we begin, my usual disclaimer: I apologize if my opinions and points seem to be presented harshly. My intention is neither to belittle nor insult.<br><br>This story... this story is not good. I am struggling to think of anything that I liked, which is not what my reaction should be after reading a PPC fic.<br><br>First off, there&#39;s the OFU itself. It bothers me that you seem to have just created an OFU with which you intend to do nothing. It is especially bothersome since you made this OFU so broad in its scope (despite it supposedly being just about <i>Disney Infinity</i>, which I will get to in a second). If canon-specific OFUs can just supplant it, then why does it need to exist in the first place? Disney has no shared overarching canon. What benefit does this provide to these smaller fanfiction schools?<br><br>I must also protest your use of <i>Disney Infinity</i> for one major reason. The game might not have a lot of canon to it, but there is one important point that you have either forgotten or not researched. The characters in <i>Disney Infinity</i> are not canonical transplants. They did not jump universes. They&#39;re <b>toys</b>. Literally. That&#39;s the central focus of the game. That&#39;s why all the levels are based off of toy boxes and why the characters fall to pieces when they run out of health. It therefore makes no sense that the original canonical characters would go to teach at this OFU (expect maybe the <i>Toy Story</i> characters). You also included characters who are not actually part of the <i>Disney Infinity</i> line like Tiana. I suppose that ties into the &quot;all-purpose OFU&quot; excuse.<br><br>That bothered me a lot when I read through this the first time, and it took me a few minutes to figure out why. Ignoring or overlooking key canonical details for the benefit of your own characters or plot is something that happens in <b>badfic</b>.<br><br>I&#39;m not even sure why this needed to be a crossover at all. Very few of the Disney characters outside of those from <i>The Incredibles</i>, <i>Frozen</i>, and <i>Tangled</i> did anything. Mickey Mouse was pretty much entirely ignored, which is weird since he literally is the face of Disney. His speeches were bushed off in a couple of sentences.<br><br>Some of the canonicals felt OOC at times. Elsa and Anna seemed the most prone to this (although that could be because I saw <i>Frozen</i> most recently of any Disney film). Wh would Elsa care about statues? I don&#39;t recall that particular aspect of her character.<br><br>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I didn&#39;t see the point of this story. Your characters didn&#39;t seem to develop in any significant way apart from what I felt was a very weak token lesson about respect at the very end. Stories need to have a point; something that drives the characters and invests the audience. This whole fic just seemed to be a excuse to have your characters interact with certain members of the Disney canon. If that was indeed the point, then color me a little concerned.<br><br>This is a weak effort, all in all. I know you&#39;re capable of better.<br><br>PoorCynic</p>

            <p>Okay, I&#39;ve edited the story a bit so that it now explicitly mentions the whole matter of the characters being toys here. I&#39;ve set it up so that when the characters enter this universe for real, they become the AU toy versions in a similar way to the toys being brought into the actual game. Again, it was my mistake to forget that fact initially, though I&#39;m also open to other suggestions about how to integrate the toy aspect into this OFU as well.<br><br>And while I&#39;m at it, I should also retract what I originally said about intending to pawn the OFU fic off to someone else. I should have said outright that I *do* plan to work on the OFU proper, but it will be a while before I can get to it because of real-life responsibilities. Hopefully, though, I should still be able to start up at least something by next year. We&#39;ll see how it turns out!</p>

            <p>Okay. Um. Well.<br><br>I guess I&#39;ll have to address all of your points pretty carefully here, as I could&#39;ve sworn this went over well with my betas. Hmmm...<br><br>If I had any time available to myself, I would gladly write about the OFU in question and explore what coursework for it is like. The problem is, I <b>DON&#39;T.</b> At least, not yet. I have enough projects as it is on both a personal and academic front, so that means that if I do end up starting work on the OFU, it wouldn&#39;t be until after I graduate from my degree sometime next year. That&#39;s part of the reason why I had the characters note that the classes wouldn&#39;t start until that time.<br><br>As I&#39;ve noted <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=266529;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">here</a>, this is intended to be a general-purpose Disney fanfic university. My reasoning was that the smaller fanfiction schools aren&#39;t suitable for those who write Disney fanfic in general without preference for any particular continuum, rather like an OFU for Anime (which was listed in Miss Cam&#39;s OFU catalog) as opposed to OFUs for specific animes like Madoka, Trigun, Black Butler, etc.<br><br>My betas and I agreed on Infinity because an OFU of Disney/Pixar just didn&#39;t seem right. Infinity at least provides a general universe for Disney and Pixar characters.  The point that all the characters are toys in this continuum is something I failed to consider in the writing process, however, which now presents the problem of how to integrate that into the story. I&#39;m tempted, very tempted, to have the canons be transformed into toys upon entering the universe of the OFU, and once they return to their home continuua, an AU version of them splits off and stays behind to continue teaching there.<br><br>The fact that I unintentionally ignored a lot of other characters was partly due to making the Christmas deadline and partly due to this being told from the POV of the agents once they entered the picture. It&#39;s like you&#39;re listening to a speech and you don&#39;t remember half of what they were saying afterward. If I do get the time to work on the OFU (and I may end up collaborating with someone else if things don&#39;t pan out for a solo effort), I&#39;d be more than willing to expand upon what the other characters will do there.<br><br>Lastly, this was first and foremost a holiday special, and the key thing I had in mind was Rashida&#39;s mentality and how she comes to warm up to the whole thing. I don&#39;t know if I accidentally covered it up amidst the rest of the fic, but the idea was to have her start out as not wanting to even be at the party because she needs to get back to HQ,  becoming increasingly angry that she doesn&#39;t get to do so, finally snapping after too many mishaps and ruining her partners&#39; good spirits, and then regretting her decision to storm off on her partners and coming back to apologize to them. Again, I don&#39;t know how well I did it, though, and I may rewrite this to emphasize that at a later time.<br><br>I wonder what some of the other Boarders around here have to say about both your feedback and my response. Starting up a new OFU honestly makes for a fascinating avenue of discussion, especially since most of them have recently stopped updating for some reason or another.</p>

            <p>First off, you&#39;re still ignoring the fact that <i>Disney Infinity</i> is a stand-alone canon. It has its own rules and its own storylines. The worlds in <i>Disney Infinity</i> are not the same as the regular Disney worlds, just as the worlds in <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> are not the same as the regular Disney worlds. Making the characters all toys does address that issue. For example: in the game&#39;s version of <i>The Incredibles</i>, Infinity!Syndrome survives and sends more Omnidroids to Metroville. It is not the movie verse. To conflate the two is a rather strange canonical error.<br><br>As I obliquely noted in my original post, that indicates to me that you either did not know about <i>Disney Infinity</i> and did not bother to research it, or just didn&#39;t care and wanted to write the story regardless. The PPC community is supposed to be one that prides itself on its knowledge and love of canon. The attitude I see in this story does not seem to fit that.<br><br>Secondly, what exactly do you mean by &quot;general-purpose Disney fanfic?&quot; What is that supposed to entail? The only thing I can think of are crossover fics that just cull from all of Disney. You cited that Anime OFU, but did you actually read it? To me it seemed just kind of generic and unremarkable, which is sort of what I expected. That&#39;s the risk you run when you make crossovers like this too broad.<br><br>And there&#39;s another thing. How much of Disney would this all-purpose OFU actually cover? Your other post specifically mentions Pixar, but what about other Disney subsidiaries? Would this cover Lucasfilm? Or Marvel? There are three Marvel-themed playsets in <i>Disney Infinity</i>, so it could theoretically stretch to cover that.<br><br>The plot with Rashida definitely did not feel like the central focus, especially since you start out on the Incredible family rather than your own agents. I get that she didn&#39;t want to be there, but that felt irrelevant. The canon characters overshadow your own at almost every point (which is part of the reason why agents typically don&#39;t interact with the canons outside of dragging them to Medical or FicPsych). <br><br>And also, honestly? Rashid was kinda right. I agreed with what she said when she had her meltdown in the kitchen. Most of her points were valid, which ultimately made her apology feel hollow and disappointing. At least to me, anyway.</p>

            <p>I always get a stack of books for Christmas, and I&#39;m usually finished them all within a couple of days of Christmas at the most.  There have been several years where I&#39;ve been curled up in a chair at my Grandmom&#39;s house furiously reading while everyone else is doing that Christmas thing.  Sometimes, people just don&#39;t understand the allure of a new book. </p>

            <p>Sounds like you got some nice loot! I already have so many books my relatives just gave up trying to remember what I already have and just send money to buy my own books. :P Poor Nana would have a heart attack if she knew I was gonna get more D&amp;D stuff.

            <p>It seems like it was just yesterday my little wizard/psion hybrid was starting out at level 1 with only six spells available to her and constantly being dead weight. Now she&#39;s got a fearsome selection of twenty spells, is manipulating time, mind-controlling enemies so they walk off cliffs or attack their allies, and delights in setting fire to everything in sight. I&#39;m so proud of her and I just wanted to share it with everyone.<br><br>Also, I was digging through my D&amp;D binder and found my very first character I ever made, and looking at the backstory? Holy Gygax, was she a Sue. Half-Elf Ranger with abusive adopted patents, tragically orphaned at birth and ran away to live in the woods with wolves. Of course she was constantly scorned because of her &#39;mixed-blood&#39;. The funniest part is that you can tell I had no idea what the frack I was doing; Rangers need their highest stat to be Dexterity. I ramped up her Intelligence instead. :P</p>

            <p>Heh, most of us have probably had a Sue (or Stu) character or two. I still skirt the line a bit with a lot of my RPG characters, since I like weird character concepts. The city druid (long story, which I won&#39;t inflict on you) especially. It&#39;s a balancing act, probably even more than with characters in writing. :P<br><br>Have you heard of the Tenebrae MUSH? They do Pathfinder and not D&amp;D, and I don&#39;t think they have any Psion characters, but I&#39;m sure Bellna would like having another Wizard around that doesn&#39;t completely overpower her. (Being Level 2 makes Bellna sad. She doesn&#39;t get no Fireballs. ;_;)<br><br>And lest this become me being kind of in-characterly silly or something like that, I shall stop talking now!</p>

            <p>(I&#39;m assuming by &quot;adopted patents&quot; you meant &quot;adopted parents&quot;. Darn that Toey.) I don&#39;t play D&amp;D anymore, but I kept the info sheets for my character just in case. I think she might be a little bit Sue-ish, what with being an elf and a Beastmaster with a wolf companion and born on a mountain during a lunar eclipse. (No, really, it says so right there on page 2.) Oh, well. I can work out the kinks and slightly blah backstory whenever I get around to the story I wrote about her for Camp NaNoWriMo two years ago.</p>

            <p>Anyway, I think all characters have a little bit of a Sue inside them. They are special for a reason: they&#39;re adventurers! Although yes, some characters are more so than others. Let&#39;s not get me started on the Eladrin Princess who ran away from an assassination attempt, got amnesia, and became a &#39;Rouge&#39;.<br><br>My current character&#39;s mother died under &#39;mysterious circumstances&#39; (protecting an artifact) and her father was killed by a Lich who wanted information on that artifact. So my character fled and ended up being raised by elves. I guess it&#39;s kind of justified because her mother was a half-elf, so the elf was her grandfather, but still.<br><br>I wish we lived a bit closer together; I&#39;d totally DM a campaign!</p>

You&#39;d think it would be fun, but it&#39;s just a big hide-and-seek with the Suvians: you need to get close enough to see what they&#39;re doing but act as if you&#39;re a background character. <br><br>Colibri: Sometimes, accidents happen: last week a friend of a friend had his cover blown by a warrior!Sue. The DIA Special Response team found him facedown in a ditch, half beaten to death.<br><br>Colibri: We can&#39;t interfere either, so we have to watch our favourite worlds become playthings for the Suvians and not do a single thing to stop them.<br><br>Colibri: In a way, we kind of envy you Action Department folks.

I&#39;m in Intelligence.<br><br>Colibri @DeadlyMushroom: Oh man, I&#39;m so sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I know that DoI regulations allow field operatives to carry only <i>one</i> high-potency healing item like a <i>Zelda</i>verse fairy in a bottle, phoenix down, or a 1-Up mushroom on them. Officially, it&#39;s to allow operatives to escape almost-certain-death situations versus overpowered Suvians but I think they want to see how using these items affects an agent&#39;s Glitter levels in their blood. <br><br>Colibri @DeadlyMushroom: I personally know a guy that has been brought back to life by a handful of phoenix down after being turned into shish kebab by a elf princess or something. It took a week for Medical to filter all of the Glitter from his blood. His case was picked up by DMSE&amp;R because of agent health and safety, etc etc. According to their report, a second resuscitation would&#39;ve turned him into a full-blown Sue. <br><br>Colibri @DeadlyMushroom: Personally, I just carry a Dead Ringer watch on me.

            <p>Colibri: All right then. Where to start?<br><br>Colibri: It concerns the weapons in <i>Mass Effect</i>, which is a superb game and something you should play at least once in your life.<br><br>Colibri: All firearms in this universe are built around a very powerful mass accelerator. If you remember your formulas from high school physics, kinetic energy is determined by the formula F = 1/2 * m * v<sup>2</sup>. <br><br>Colibri: Modern-day weapons use a bullet weighing several grams and shoot them at speeds around or higher than the speed of sound.<br><br>Colibri: In <i>Mass Effect</i>, the accelerators can shoot a bullet the size of a grain of sands at supersonic speeds and cause even more damage that a modern-day firearm.<br><br>Colibri: That way, you can simply shave off tiny pieces of metal from a metal block stored inside the weapon and almost never run out of ammo!<br><br>Colibri: The only problem is the heat buildup: the accelerator gets really, <i>really</i> hot with prolonged use. If the weapon overheats, it locks up and has to vent heat for a few seconds before it can be used again. <br><br>Colibri: Simple enough, right? That&#39;s how it was in the first game: no reloading shenanigans, you just have to keep an eye on the heat gauge.<br><br>Colibri: In the second game, they got rid of the internal cooling mechanism and introduced &quot;heat sinks&quot; that absorb the accelerator&#39;s heat instead, effectively making weapons have limited ammo again. <br><br>Colibri: The in-universe justification is that a) one faction discovered that they could unload a greater volume of lead in a shorter amount of time (thus out-shooting the enemy) if they had the thermal clips and b) the mass accelerators got more and more powerful (and thus produced more heat).<br><br>Colibri: It just bothers me that the game devs decided to be more like other shooters and reintroduce an ammo system.<br><br><br></p>
