            <p>Are you ready for this?<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/1/PPC-Driftwood">PPC: Driftwood</a> is my new series, intended to put a lie to the notion that PPC missions have to be fifty pages long and only released once a year or so. Jay and Acacia put out 25 missions in a year or so, and there&#39;s no reason we can&#39;t still do the same. For reference, the prologue + first mission here were begun on Monday. See what I mean?<br><br>And... I&#39;m taking requests for their next mission, on a &#39;first come, only served&#39; basis. Specific requirements:<br><br>-The badfic needs to be short; not more than 6000 words, please.<br>-The badfic should be rated no higher than T/PG-13.<br>-Please tell me why you think it&#39;s bad! You can use the Intelligence Report format (below the line underneath), or something less formal, but don&#39;t just throw me a link and say &#39;this is a bad story&#39;.<br>-The one you can&#39;t judge... I have to know the canon! I&#39;m not even going to try and list what I know, so just post and I&#39;ll say if I don&#39;t. I will note that, barring &#39;Pokemon games up to Platinum&#39;, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m familiar with anything in the anime-manga continuua.<br><br>So - what&#39;ve you got for me?<br><br>hS<br><br><hr>

            <p>I pretty much agree with what doctorlit said. My favorite stuff was the dialogue between the agents, seeing how their relationship is beginning to form. Seems like they&#39;re going to work well together.<br><br>Just... try not to make out like writing slowly/not being amazingly prolific is a bad thing? At least one person I can recall quit the PPC because they felt bad about not writing enough (that was Inkling), and some of us can&#39;t churn out a gazillion words in a go like you can, whether it&#39;s due to time constraints or just because our brains don&#39;t work that fast.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who will probably never win at NaNo.</p>

            <p>I am a <i>master</i> at writing incredibly slowly. I still have Kayleigh and Salamander&#39;s mission into <i>Dragon Fever</i> on file, which predates most of the planning for <i>Crashing Down</i> - ie, it was begun in 2006 or earlier. I also have Narto and Lou&#39;s last mission, and I don&#39;t know if you remember the year-and-a-half break I took in the middle of Reorg?<br><br>But there are 50+ of us here, and the ten missions on the Wiki front page go clear back to March. <i>Four of them are mine</i>. I&#39;m not complaining that [person X] isn&#39;t writing fast enough - I&#39;m complaining that <i>no-one</i> is writing <i>at all</i>.<br><br>And yes, that includes me. Agent Huinesoron is in the middle of his third mission, and has been for some time. Then there&#39;s all that stuff I mentioned above.<br><br>So this is something different. This is putting missions on the Board at a pace we haven&#39;t seen in a decade - and on the front page of Fanfiction.net, where many of us got out start.<br><br>This... is <i>PPC: Driftwood</i>. And I&#39;m already halfway through Mission #2.<br><br>hS has just reread <a href="http://qntm.org/structure">Fine Structure</a> and might be speechifying a bit</p>

            <p>Probably more important than the above, actually...<br><br>It&#39;s not about writing speed. It&#39;s about, as I see it, <i>length</i>. We all (myself included!) have this burning desire to kill the worst of the worst fics by having our agents analyse every line, record every charge, grouch about each problem, and also work in their own overarching plot and deep personal traumas at multiple points in the mission (and let&#39;s make sure there&#39;s a whole bunch of references to other agents, probably including cameos and and and).<br><br>And that&#39;s one way of writing missions - but it doesn&#39;t have to be <i>the</i> way. It probably shouldn&#39;t be, in fact, for the same reason we shouldn&#39;t have Emergencies every five minutes - they lose their impact. A series of short, simple missions <i>leading up to</i> the big set-piece can work just as well. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying with Agent hS, in fact.<br><br>But equally, we can have short, simple missions <i>without</i> the finale. Why not? Not everything needs to be a gripping saga. Have you never watched a TV show which you wished would stop with that stupid arc plot and just go back to monster-of-the-week episodes? In our case it was <i>The Mentalist</i>. Well, <i>Driftwood</i> is your monster-of-the-week(ish) PPC fix. Go read Agent Huinesoron if you want my drama and arc missions - you won&#39;t find them here.<br><br>Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to see a girl about a horse. She thinks she recognises it, see.<br><br>hS might shut up now - no promises<br><br>PS: I have no idea how this is coming across. I&#39;m just trying to get my thoughts down, not to cast nasturtiums at anyone. Waste of good flowers, that. ~hS</p>

            <p>I know you&#39;re not intending to cast aspersions (or nasturtiums). I just felt like I should speak up for those of us like myself, who are unable to write quickly (at least not anything good) except in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Even my much shorter, simpler first missions took me a year each to finish on average—the second one only appears to have been completed faster because I switched 1 and 2 midway through, so 2 was already half-done when I finished 1.<br><br>The fastest I ever got a PPC story done was &quot;The Dark Side&quot; (17,659 words), most of which was a cowrite between me and Phobos, so we could physically pass the thing back and forth and have real-time discussion and feedback about what was going on. Still took us two months, and that&#39;s when we were both working at Blockbuster and had too much free time due to crappy hours and no social life. I doubt we could pull it off now.<br><br>And say what you like about being slow, but you&#39;re still far and away the most prolific PPC writer out of anybody, not to mention a multiple NaNo winner, and you manage to do a lot of things despite having a real job and a family. So, just saying, it&#39;s all well and good for <i>you</i> to crank out a bunch of monster-of-the-week stories in an attempt to show us how it&#39;s done—and they&#39;ll be good and we&#39;ll enjoy reading them, and some people really could stand to scale things back some, so I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s at all a bad idea—but we can&#39;t all be you, even if we wanted to. I want to make sure everyone knows that&#39;s okay.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Very fun!  You definitely delivered the feeling of the Original Series, with the mission being to-the-point, but still long enough to allow the agents time to let their personalities show through their actions and reactions.  I . . . don&#39;t really have anything negative to say!  doctorlit will shut up sooner for once!<br><br>Just to share my two cents on the topic of mission length: I get what you&#39;re wanting to show, that not every mission needs to be long and complex, but to be honest, I prefer reading longer missions.  I literally read both the introduction and &quot;Winterwood&quot; in the time it took to clean my teeth before going to bed.  (Which takes about an hour, because I inherited terrible teeth genes, just to be clear.)  And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, but it&#39;s also not as immersive for me.  When I read a story, I want to feel like I&#39;m there, in that world, and spend a long time getting to know it.  But I guess that&#39;s just my brain&#39;s legacy as a longtime novel reader, it&#39;s just my preference.  (And I&#39;m enough of a glutton for reading to take whatever I can get.)<br><br>—doctorlit lied about shutting up sooner!<br><br>(Man, the first <i>Frozen</i> mission took way longer to appear than I expected.<br><br>♪Do you want to spork a badfiiiiiic?<br>And find the problems with the plooooooot♪)</p>

            <p>Fic:  <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/98141/the-smarty-complex">The Smarty Complex</a> <br>Description: This one is actually only bad because of technical issues. But there are so many of those. Bad SPaG, walls of text, run-ons, overly long description and bad pacing. <br><br>Plot Holes: Not much actually. Maybe how the animation spell<br>works in this story though. <br><br>Problem Passages:<br>1) &quot;Twilight awoke in a soft cot, soft sheets enveloping her. She [bad error, Twilight is a she!] sighed, relaxing as she sank into the bed. It was lovely, she was worn out, after all, creating a new life form in its entirety. However, her mind was clouded with worry as she facehoofed for being so careless. She needed to take Smarty Pants to a doctor’s appointment. But, she’ll only be there for a few days before I turn her back. Twilight cringed again, arguing with herself. There’s something about her though, something that drew her to me, some kind of bond. She knew there was a part of her that wanted to keep Smarty Pants. Something about her coat, something about her eyes, even her odd hair. Everything about her seemed, She didn’t know what it seemed like, whatever this feeling was, she couldn’t put her hoof on it Twilight soon however was overcome by the logic in her mind. She isn’t meant to be alive, she isn’t meant to be a foal. She’s a toy, that’s what she always would be. But, then again, it’ll probably take me a week or so to build my energy again, and it might be worth it just to see. She resolved it [‘Resolved it’? maybe she decided she would take Smarty to the Doctor, or something similar. Resolved isn’t usually the term for thoughts.], she was going to take Smarty for a doctor’s appointment. She bolted up from the cot, shaking herself awake. She was determined to help the foal for as long as she had to while she built up her arcana [Arcana? Well, it is your decision. However there are a few more common terms. ‘Strength’ ‘Energy’ ‘Focus’ or even ‘Mana’, but still your choice on this one.] once again.&quot; <br><br>Huge wall of text plus what are apparently editor&#39;s notes were left in. <br><br><br>2) &quot;No, she was an inanimate object. But what if, all the times we had spoken to Smarty all those years ago, some part of her was wishing she could speak back, letting all of her emotions out? She was a doll, she had no emotions. She’s like francium suddenly becoming bromine, one thing becoming something completely different. Yet, how would it feel to have a taste of the most beautiful food ever tasted, and have it snatched away from you by some torturer. Was she killing Smarty Pants, or restoring her. She was ending the life of a foal. No, she knew there was something about the new, living Smarty Pants that had moved somewhere in her heart, well, in her brain, there are no emotions in the heart, it only pumps blood. Never mind. Twilight gazed at Smarty, who was cooing at her, smiling as she embraced her Mother. Twilight sighed, she knew she couldn’t turn Smarty into a doll, how could she do that to an adorable little foal. She smiled again, and faced Smarty Pants.&quot; <br><br>Smaller,internal dialogue wall of text. Pacing problems regarding Twilight deciding things too quickly, making it already pretty clear what decision she is going to make in the ending. <br><br>Offenses Against Canon: [Broad categories of charges]<br><br>Additional Comments: I am mostly sending you this because of the whole concrit at the end of the mission angle you are going with this series. This story actually has a potentially good premise, but that is currently obscured under the technical errors, specially the troublematic pacing that is basically killing any suspense over Twilight&#39;s decision regarding turning Smarty Pants back or not.</p>

            <p>If you don&#39;t know the Canon, then I guess there&#39;s not much you<br>can do about it. It&#39;s a pity. I think this story is a diamond in the rough.

            <p>I think... I think the reason why you were able to write it so quickly is because you didn&#39;t include too many direct quotes from the badfic. The Original Series was very similar in that regard. Maybe that&#39;s the key to faster missions...?<br><br>Anyway, new mission for Kaitlyn and Selene!<br><br><br>Title: And So The Journey Begins <br><br>Description: A modern girl uses wall-of-text urple prose to describe how heartbroken she is over her ex-fiancйe before finding a portal that takes her to Middle Earth.<br><br>Problem Passage 1: &quot;Her stubborn heart had prevailed over her will of succumb to sleep. The world kept turning and it was only her little world that had ceased. That bliss that was no longer what she came home to. She couldn&#39;t deny that it was pathetic, wallowing in her own misery whilst across the globe there was surely someone rejoicing at the mere essence of life. She once believed in fairytales and happily ever afters but now, reality had taken hold and slapped her over the face like a scorned being.&quot; ALL THE URPLE PROSE. And this continues through the whole fic, from what I&#39;ve seen... <br><br>Problem Passage 2: &quot;Lord Elrond nodded reservedly, &quot;I had not realised that orcs have spread to the north as well or have you come from Gondor?&quot; He inquired, looking distastefully at her attire.&quot; I have... no words... <br><br>Main OC: Guinevere Archer (because Legolas is an archer, of course)<br><br>OC Type: Modern fan of Tolkien&#39;s who falls into Middle Earth and falls in love with Prince Legolas.<br><br>Charges: Overly-flowery descriptions of just about everything, apparently there are orcs taking human slaves at an establishment near Rivendell, Lord Elrond is a condescending jerk to the Sue but warms up to her wit...<br><br>Additional notes: the author says Guinevere isn&#39;t meant to be a Mary Sue.

            <p>The dialogue in this piece feels a bit odd what with everyone going on these long, uninterrupted tangents. I presume that’s just an artifact of the original message-based RP, but it still reads strangely to me.<br><br>I was also not a fan of how it felt like Des and the Guardsman were just swapping backstories and character-building facts with each other. While all that’s very nice to know, at the same time it feels very artificial. It goes get a bit better on when they actually start swapping stories.<br><br>One minor nitpick: <i>”[...]Don&#39;t mind if I do, Agent Des,” beamed the Time Lord as he allowed himself to crash into the seat opposite Des.</i> One cannot “beam” dialogue unless one is some sort of robot communicating via electronic signals. “Said with a wide smile” or something similar would be more accurate.<br><br>Overall, this was pretty enjoyable. I think it could be edited to be a lot tighter in terms of dialogue and pacing, but that might be taking it too far from the original RP. Kudos and well done to the both of you!</p>

            <p>...I got a real kick out of the part where you bought up my own Agents, including that one disastrous mission that led to Rashida transferring to Floaters in the first place (and yes, I would like to revisit that particular incident soon. I have plans for it...). I have to second Huinesoron in that you might want to edit the &quot;something something Giza&quot; part, though - it&#39;s Rashida Mafdetiti now, actually.<br><br>In light of this, I&#39;d actually like to have my own Agents meet up with yours.

It&#39;s not so much the swapping around of viewpoints and writing styles - you and SeaTurtle are close enough in style (or did you rework things?) that that slips by, and you carefully didn&#39;t spend much time in Deep Thoughts that would make the viewpoint swapping obvious. No, my main problem is that the Guardsman, in particular, breaks his speech over multiple paragraphs.<br><br>I can see why. SeaTurtle&#39;s dialogue tends towards long speeches - that&#39;s not a problem, it&#39;s just one way of doing things - and those <i>should</i> be broken up. But because it started life as an RP, not every paragraph immediately identifies the speaker. Single example: &#39;He thought for a few seconds and cocked his head.&#39; That starts a new paragraph, so is &#39;he&#39; the previous speaker, or the person who could be replying to him? It makes the reading tricky, is what I&#39;m trying to get across.<br><br>Once you get past that - and it becomes a lot easier when there&#39;s four participants, since they tend to cut in on each other more frequently - it&#39;s an interesting story. It&#39;s always fun to see agents from different canons interact in a casual setting, and ask the questions they normally don&#39;t get to. Fun.<br><br>(Oh, minor point: since Rashida has a new name, you might want to edit the &#39;something something Giza&#39; section.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, for those of you who don&#39;t know, I work for amazon.com. I started in the Tax Software department (which is about as exciting as you would imagine), until about a year and a half ago. I was approached by a manager I respect deeply to work on a new secret project that landed squarely in my interests - and he couldn&#39;t tell me anything more until I&#39;d signed on the dotted line.<br><br>Okay, so that last bit isn&#39;t exactly true. I knew what I was getting into, but I couldn&#39;t tell anyone else until we launched - which finally happened today!<br><br>I give you the last year and a half&#39;s work: <a href="https://writeon.amazon.com/beta/code?code=WEREWOLF">Write On by Kindle</a>.<br><br>Write On is a social space for reading and writing, especially around works in progress. While it&#39;s primarily for original work, fanfiction is cool too - we like writers and we like stories. The PPC itself is something I haven&#39;t even tried to discuss with the business people, let alone the lawyers, so it&#39;s probably a gray area, but I would love nothing more than to see a healthy dose of the spirit of the PPC show up in the Write On community.<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for a space to write in, or a community to write with, please give Write On a poke - at the very least, I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on what we&#39;ve built.</p>

            <p>For a minimum, I&#39;d say consult the Original Series. Charge lists on average have become rather longer since then. However, the point of a charge list is to establish that an OC is a Mary Sue and/or that the canon has been broken. You could rack up a million SPaG errors and still not accomplish that. Also, charging for the same problem (e.g. bad spelling) more than once is unnecessary and will just result in a wall o&#39;text that no one will want to read.<br><br>See Also:<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Charge">Charge</a><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Charge_List">Charge List</a><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide#Okay.2C_So_You.E2.80.99ve_Found_a_Badfic._Now_What.3F">Mission Writing Guide: &quot;Okay, So You&#39;ve Found a Badfic.

            <p>So far, I have these. (This list is not limited to Grammar and Spelling.)<br><br>- Notably, there are several mentions of a &quot;her&quot;, despite this story being in the First Person.<br><br>- The Main Original Character has a double-bladed Sword of Sueness, a Cute Animal Companion Horse, is the (human) daughter of Aslan and the granddaughter of Professor Diggory, and falls in love with Peter Pevensie.<br><br>- The following characters are brought out of character; The Professor is never supposed to be married to begin with, and even if he was, he would most likely not allow his daughter run away to Narnia- meaning, he would not be the kind of person to give her a reason to run; Peter never falls in love as far as we know, and most certainly, not very easily, if he did; Aslan is supposed to be the Narnia&#39;s version of Jesus, or God, or whatever, and he is portrayed as ignorant in a few cases, and his powers are greatly diminished as a result; Jadis is portrayed as a more dramatically evil character, as opposed to the stuck-up, cold and calculating villain she is supposed to be.<br><br>- Additionally, the Mary Sue has a problem with unnatural, sometimes forced dialog that really grinds my gears personally, and will likely irritate one of my Agents, and this Sue never learns any lessons, or has her character developed in any way, positively or negatively.<br><br>So far, those are all that I found.</p>

            <p>Hello, PPC-ians! For Christmas this year, I am giving the extravagant gift of... <i>storytelling!</i><br>Okay, I suppose that it’s a bit early for Christmas. But I’m getting this started early, so you guys have plenty of time to write.<br>Yes, that’s right. I’m hosting a prompt exchange. If you’ve never done one before, this is how it works!<br>1. You head to the Prompt Exchange Form, which has been created on Google Drive. It’s availible here- <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/8lOaT0OVPd"><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/8lOaT0OVPd">http://goo.gl/forms/8lOaT0OVPd</a></a> <br>2. Complete the questions, and type in a prompt that you’d like someone to write a short story based on.<br>3. Click Submit!<br>4. On November 1st, you will be sent an email with the prompt that you need to write. Even if it seems too difficult, just try it!<br>5. Send the completed story (minimum 1500 words) to <a href="mailto:thebiggeniusrocks@gmail.com">thebiggeniusrocks@gmail.com</a> by December 20th.<br>6. On Christmas, I will OPEN THE PRESENT BOX. That is to say, I will post a list of everyone’s stories and who requested them.<br><br>A couple of ground rules. First, please don’t write fanfiction. These stories are all supposed to be original. <br>Keep the ratings down, people! No erotica. All genres allowed, but if a prompt makes you snort out loud, it’s pretty much a given that it’s supposed to be humor. This is the PPC, after all.<br>You won’t find out who gave you the prompt, or who got your prompt until the release of all the stories on Christmas.<br>Any questions? Easy! Just ask me on the thread.<br><br>Lotsa love,<br><br>Kitty </p>

            <p>I have a problem. You&#39;re asking for prompts, but I usually think of a prompt as being as short as possible: witness <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=264560;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the Monthlyish Challenge</a>, where the prompt is two whole words. They&#39;re an idea which people can read wildly differently.<br><br>Given the four-sentence-minimum requirement, I&#39;d class what you&#39;re asking for here as <i>outlines</i> - a fully-fledged story idea, basically just needing fleshing out and writing. In other words, it&#39;s &#39;I&#39;ve got a great idea for a story, but I don&#39;t have the time/energy/skill/knowledge to write it&#39;.<br><br>And, uh... my problem is that I can&#39;t think of those. Or rather, if I can come up with a four-sentence outline, I can also come up with a two-page outline, and plan to write the story. I don&#39;t particularly have stories of the &#39;want to write but can&#39;t (be bothered)&#39; variety in my head, or not in any detail.<br><br>What I&#39;m saying is, I&#39;d love to participate - but I can&#39;t think of anything. If I come up with something, I&#39;ll add it.<br><br>(And how many words did I use to say that? Shh, that&#39;s how many. Here&#39;s an extra .023: .)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have a suggestion. November is also NaNoWriMo. Would it be possible to tweak the dates so everyone gets their prompts, say, a week before November 1. so people doing NaNo can finish them before the madness starts?<br>If not, it&#39;s no big deal. 20 days of December is still time enough to write a story. I just think it would be a great pre-NaNo warm-up.</p>

            <p>NaNoWriMo is short for National (it&#39;s actually international, but never mind that) Novel Writing Month. You write a novel (50.000) words in a month. It it all kinds of fun and exhausting and there&#39;s usually a good deal of PPC&#39;ers participating.

            <p>PPC- the Musical was the first spin-off I ever read. It&#39;s still my favorite. We should do a live version of it at the next Gathering! It&#39;d be fun. I&#39;d love to write the script.<br>Or we could just sing through the songs in public. And watch people stare. I do it all the time. I accidently sang &#39;Agents&#39; instead of &#39;All Stars&#39; once. I got some pretty weird looks, can I tell you. And I do &#39;Going Through the Fanfics&#39; and &#39;Song of Suvians&#39; all the time.<br>But the &#39;Sues&#39;thing is  new one. I&#39;m off to go read it!<br><br>~Kitty, who is indeed in LOVE. «3</p>

            <p>Put simply: do not make your agents Suvians.<br><br>The world of the PPC is one where agents - moderately regular folk, just out to get their job done, wipe out evil, and hopefully avoid going flamethrower-crazy - struggle through badfics, and ultimately perform The Duty with some difficulty. They&#39;re at a disadvantage - basically everyone they have to face down is in some way more powerful than them, whether it be a canon character they have to keep from getting killed by <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFddeA6xDGWo5vJxDvOUep_LPJIzrmgZ5EwUUzFj8jg/pub">while their partner sets up an exorcism</a>, or a Suvian they have to fight <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1-s7LIQsH6vWklzYLPriCMYS5CWQDIsUdtRXJ5qHdgCM">or even just catch</a>.<br><br>If your agent has an easy time of their missions, you&#39;re doing it wrong. If you find yourself giving them powers or weapons because you &#39;need&#39; them to take down the misplaced flora and fauna you&#39;re planning to send them against, you&#39;re doing it wrong. If, in fact, you&#39;re planning on giving them a power without consequences, a bonus without a downside, a plus without a minus - you&#39;re probably doing it wrong.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If so, I&#39;d like to take the time to bring up <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4445668/1/Indiana">this</a> ugly thing.<br><br>The reason I know of this... ABOMINATION is because it&#39;s got its own TV Tropes entry, which is how I stumbled upon it a few years ago. Here&#39;s the summary of said entry, which really speaks for itself:<br><br>&quot;After venturing into a cave and getting a gold tube that grants him the power of flight, Indiana Jones finds his dad Dr. Jones and takes him flying... but then Dr. Jones has a shocking admission: He was sent from the future to kill Indy. Needless to say, Indy doesn&#39;t handle this too well, and Dr. Jones sends him into the future... first to the World Trade Center on September 11 (yes, THAT September 11), and then to the year 2008. Indy is distraught by the fact that his &quot;history is now history&quot;, but then he meets a &quot;really cool kid&quot; named Andy who offers to help him get back to his time period. Meanwhile, Dr. Jones is plotting to take over the world, and he does so by running for &quot;overlord of the world&quot; by eating Barack Obama and John McCain.<br>And that&#39;s just the beginning of the sheer insanity on display.<br>Quite possibly the most insane and surreal Indiana Jones fanfiction ever written, the story is full of spelling errors, characters acting out of character, and generally makes no sense whatsoever.&quot;<br><br>You know, I wonder if I can claim this one. Not to sound masochistic and all, but I&#39;ve... got some plans for it ;)</p>

            <p>You can&#39;t claim an RC number until you get Permission. Also, what counts as a messy RC varies with the person, in my opinion; for example, Eamon and Barid&#39;s doesn&#39;t rank high in my list (as opposed to Iximaz).</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t see this thread being anything more than a way to bash badfic authors. That&#39;s not what the PPC is about. At all. Period. Let me point out this snippet from the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a>:<br><br><i>Sporking is NEVER about the fic&#39;s AUTHOR. This point cannot be emphasised enough. Authors of a badfic are not equal to the badfic. Moaning and complaining about the badfic should never turn into insulting the author. It&#39;s rude, it&#39;s cruel, and it&#39;s created far too many dramas already. Leave authors out of it.</i><br><br>PC</p>

            <p>...Sorta. First, let me apologize  about my absence. I have been very busy working on the Mark Begich campaign up here in Alaska. I know most of you probably have not heard of it, but it is one of the most important elections in the U.S. right now. I can get into why, if anybody is interested, but for now, just know that is a very close race, that requires all of the attention and work I can give. So that is where I have been, and will be until November 4th. <br><br>Secondly, how has it been going? I have not been here for a long time! Anything interesting happen over here? I need the scoop!<br><br>Finally, to Iximaz, another apology. I have completely ignored that crossover for months. Granted, I have been busy, but that&#39;s no excuse. I should have had something in by now. However, I promise, November 6th, you will have my section of the crossover mission. You have my word.</p>

            <p>Like Iximaz said, we&#39;ve been getting a fair amount of newbies lately: June Blue Knight, Combat of Giants, Lunar Dusk...Another newbie, SkarmorySilver, got Permission, and Desdendelle and I have been beta reading his first mission. (Quite fun.) There&#39;s a Rudi&#39;s RP thread on the Other Board that&#39;s probably still open, we kicked out a troll back in May (long story), somebody started a camping trip thread, and way more cool things happened than I can shake a ten-foot pole at. (LOL, mixed metaphor.)<br><br>You&#39;re working on a campaign? That sounds pretty stressful, but also exciting. Who&#39;s Mark Begich and why is his campaign super-duper important?</p>

            <p>Man, it has been a while. So many things happening. I even missed the Badfic Games! Oh well, not like I had anything for it anyway. <br><br>So, since you asked, I shall deliver. Mark Begich is a U.S. senator from Alaska. He is a democrat from a largely republican state (though Libertarian would probably fit the state better), and is now fighting to keep his seat from the republican Dan Sullivan. Sullivan is nothing but a tool for the republican party and the Koch Brothers,who have been throwing millions his way. Now, Alaska, being one of the smallest states in the union, is ignored by most. However, the republican party sees an opportunity to take the senate back, and Alaska is the front line state. Many political analysts have said that which ever way Alaska goes, so goes the nation. In many ways, if Begich looses, the Democrats loose the senate, and Alaska a tremendous voice. He is on the appropritions committee, chairman of the  sub-committee of fisheries, and has brought over $1,000,000,000 for transportation. I could go on about him, and why it is important he wins, but I think that will suffice for now. Keep in mind though, that while the Nation is liable to be changed here, I really am fighting for local interests. </p>

            <p>Ahahahaha. &#39;Monthlyish&#39;. For anyone just tuning in, the last &#39;Monthlyish&#39; challenge was in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=247858;search_term=monthlyish">September 2013</a>. And the first one was in... well, I can&#39;t actually find it in the archives!. So here&#39;s the description from the first one, yet again:<br><br><i>Here at the PPC we&#39;re very big on writing. We write missions, we rant about the bad writing in badfics, we even play games like Fill The Plothole, which consist of, yep, writing. But at no point do we all sit down and try to improve our writing together.<br><br>So. The objective of the Monthly PPC Writing Challenge is to write a short story to a set theme, and then give useful, constructive criticism to other participants.</i><br><br>Here are The Rules:<br><br>-Write a (reasonably short) story in response to the Theme below, and post it on this thread. You may use a beta if you wish, but it is not required.<br>-Give constructive criticism (<u>at least</u> one positive point, <u>at least</u> one negative with suggestions for improvement) to at least one other submission.<br>-You may rewrite your story based on concrit you receive and repost it, but this is not required.<br>-Obvious fact, but no flaming! This isn&#39;t like the Badfic Contest - the goal here is to write a good story and get feedback from the community.<br>-You <b>do not</b> require Permission to participate in the Challenge. Neither do your agents need to be approved for you to use them.<br>-However, nothing written for the Challenge is considered part of the PPC Canon unless you do have Permission, and explicitly claim it as canon.<br><br>I think that covers it. Remember that both the writing and the giving of concrit are part of the challenge. (And no, there&#39;s no time limit - but there&#39;s not usually much point posting on a thread that&#39;s left the front page)<br><br>And this month&#39;s Theme:<br><br><i>Break precedent.</i><br><br>(It might help to include a note at the end of your story of which precedent(s) you/your agents are breaking)<br><br>And remember... have fun!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>RC 1953 had been quite for a too long time, so it was no surprise when a blue portal popped into existence and a pair of black-robed figures stumbled out of it. One of them was a young woman with very long, very pointy ears. Her arms were clutched around the elder male&#39;s shoulders in an attempt to hold him upright in front of her. But it did not do much good. She could barely keep her balance when he fell to his knees and bent over, his hands pressed on his belly.<br><br>The front of the man&#39;s cloak was soaked in glitter, and purple stains were all over his face and beard. He coughed and heaved, like he would vomit, but his already empty stomach had nothing to give up anymore. He cringed. A wilver knife fell to the floor.<br><br>“On your knees again, Hieronymus?” asked the night elf in a mislead attempt to joke. “You know this is not necessary in front of me.” The man coughed and heaved even more. “Get up on your feet,” commanded the woman, “and out of this robes. Then wash your face and you will feel better, I promise.” Hieronymus shook his head. “Oh, well then. Let me get some facecloths and towels.”<br><br>When she returned, her partner was still on his knees, his head bent and his gaze fixated on the stained knife. “Don&#39;t look at this thing!“ shouted Androia, carefully averting her eyes as she kicked the wilver knife into the space under the console. “I told you we should not keep it. Look at me!” But when she had dropped the towels onto the console, she had to grip the male&#39;s hair and pull his head back before she could start to clean his face with a wet flannel. Hieronymus appeared to be in a catatonic state.<br> <br>“You know,” said Androia, “this would be much easier if your face were less furry. Maybe I should get some scissors.” Hieronymus did not react at all. Androia looked really worried now. Deciding that, even if he did not object, removing the beard he was so proud of should only be a last resort, she continued to wipe and rub.  “Next time you cut somebody&#39;s throat,” she scolded, “remember that you should not be in front of them. Although I must admit that approaching the Sue like you intended to confess your unending love was a brilliant move.”<br><br>“Don&#39;t,” croaked Hieronymus.<br><br>This was at least something. “Don&#39;t what?” asked Androia. But Hieronymus had fallen back into silence and shivering. His skin felt cold as ice, while his forehead, which she had just rubbed dry, covered with small drops of sweat. <i>Get rid of the glitter,</i> thought Androia, <i>and keep him warm</i>. She looked around frantically. Three steps to the bedroom&#39;s door behind Hieronymus&#39; back. But the door was closed and she would not have a free hand to open it. Then there was the other possibility. Androia made a decision that appeared to be rational, shoved her hands under his axles, and pulled him up and forwards to the pile of blankets in the far corner of the RC. Having arrived, she unbuttoned his robes and, without further ado, pulled it down, just in time before she could not longer stand his weight.<br><br>Hieronymus eyes widened in alarm when he was dropped on the blankets. “But – that&#39;s your bed,” he stammered.<br><br>“There is no need to worry. It is okay for now.” Androia knelt down, pulled the topmost blanket over her partner and tried to wrap him in. “Look, we got you out of this glittering robes, and now we have to keep you warm, then you will soon feel better, I am sure. – Oh, no!” Looking down, she had suddenly realized that it would have been much better to remove Hieronymus&#39; robes before she had dragged him to her chest. The glitter was all over her robes now as well.<br><br>Hieronymus eyes widened even more when his partner wriggled out of her robes and threw it across the room. <br><br>“There,” she said, “it is all gone. Now let us keep you warm and comfortable.” Androia laid down on the blankets, shoved one arm under her partners neck and started to caress his face with the other hand. “Now, now,” she soothed. “It will get better soon.”<br><br>“It wasn&#39;t the glitter,” moaned Hieronymus. “Nor the wilver.” And then it broke out of him. “Androia! I just murdered a girl!”<br><br>Androia sat up and looked down at the man. “This is not what happened,” she said sternly. “Mary Sue is not a person. It is a concept that needs to be eradicated. I learned this from you. Do you remember? And you did not murder it. You saved my life when it held me at wand point and was about to use the killing curse on me.”<br><br>“I know all this. But if it looks like a person, moves like a person, talks like a person –“<br><br>“If it looks too good to be real, moves faster than a whirlwind and talks everybody into oblivion – come on, Hieronymus, you have read all the reports, and you have been there. It never bothered you when you watched me doing the Duty.”<br><br>“That&#39;s true, but I still wasn&#39;t prepared for how it would feel to do it myself.” Hieronymus shuddered, but then he shoved the blankets aside and sat up. “We should clean up,” he said boldly.<br><br>Androia glanced over the heaps of glittering clothes. “No need to hurry,” she said. “Any attempt to wash this stuff would be futile. It can all go directly into the garbage chute. She looked back at Hieronymus. “Do you feel better now?”<br><br>Hieronymus nodded, standing up. “I&#39;m okay.” <br><br>He was quite obviously lying.<br><br>“There is one thing I do not understand,” said Androia. “Why are you even here when you cannot stand the killing?”<br><br><i>Because you are here, and I would do everything to be with you</i>, would have been the honest answer. “I can&#39;t tell you,” said Hieronymus instead, on his way to the console.<br><br>“Why not?”<br><br>“There&#39;s no time,” answered Hieronymus, starting to program a portal. “We&#39;ll be sooo in trouble if I don&#39;t clean up the mess I made, puking all over the Slytherin common room.”<br><br>Androia wanted to hug him. But apparently he did not want to be comforted anymore. And considering their current state, it would probably be inappropriate. “It may already be too late,” she said. “And don&#39;t you think that we should get dressed first?”<br><br>-------------<br><br>I should probably have set the precedences first, before I break them. <br><br>But you may have guessed that usually Androia does the killing. <br><br>You may also have noticed that Androia sleeps on the floor because she doesn&#39;t want to share a bedroom, let alone a bed, with her (strictly professional) partner.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure, but don&#39;t these hurt/comfort scenes always end with sex, or at least a confession of love?<br><br>In case you wonder why Androia didn&#39;t take her partner to Medical: this is a precedent not broken yet. Androia Avatar was designed to be a one-woman-army able to go wherever she is sent to on her own. She doesn&#39;t call for help.<br><br>(The miraculous sudden healing may not be understandable without the back-story that is always hinted at, but never spelled out. In short, at this time Androia may or may still not be aware that Hieronymus is her creator and tried to snatch her out of the game for the sole purpose of seducing her. I keep this ambiguous, because I don&#39;t know when it will happen, it depends on when I find a mission where it fits. So Androia&#39;s shock therapy may be deliberate or totally innocent. Anyway, seeing his dreams come true in this unexpected and unwanted way is a greater shock for Hieronymus then whatever may have happened during the mission. Being aware that Androia would be horrified if she realized the unfortunate implications – supposing that she doesn&#39;t know exactly what she is doing there – Hieronymus just cannot let this continue. Because he cares for his partner as much as she cares for him.)<br><br>The provisional claim of RC 1953 is still pending (me asking for) Permission.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right that this scene loses some of its power without knowing its context within your spin-off.  That said, it&#39;s still a powerful scene, with lots of emotion.  It also does a fairly good job at <i>hinting</i> at the precedents it&#39;s breaking, so that it still gives the reader a good idea of what&#39;s happening, in general, between these characters.  All in all, it&#39;s a decent &quot;teaser&quot; for your spin-off, as it shows off the personalities of and interactions between your agents.<br><br>I wish I had more to say, but it&#39;s a little tough without knowing more about your characters.  Sorry!<br><br>And now, welcome to doctorlit&#39;s trademark list of errors:<br>&quot;RC 1953 had been <b>quite</b> for a too long time . . .&quot;<br>-&quot;Quite&quot; should be &quot;quiet.&quot;<br>-&quot;For a too long time&quot; is phrased weirdly.  Alternatives would be, &quot;for too long a time&quot; or just &quot;for too long.&quot;<br><br>&quot;. . . commanded the woman, &#39;and out of <b>this</b> robes.&#39;&quot;<br>-&quot;This&quot; could be either &quot;these&quot; or &quot;those,&quot; since &quot;robes&quot; is a plural word.<br><br>&quot;. . . while his forehead, which she had just rubbed dry, covered with small drops of sweat.&quot;<br>-If you ignore the phrase separated with commas, the sentence, &quot;His forehead covered with drops of sweat&quot; has no verb.  You need a &quot;was&quot; in between &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;covered.&quot;<br><br>&quot;. . . shoved her hands under his <b>axles</b>, and pulled him . . .&quot;<br>-I&#39;m not sure about British English, but in American English, &quot;axle&quot; isn&#39;t used as a synonym for &quot;shoulder&quot; commonly anymore.  I would suggest just saying &quot;shoulder&quot; here.<br><br>&quot;<b>Hieronymus</b> eyes widened in alarm . . .&quot;<br>&quot;Hieronymus&quot; needs an apostrophe to show that his eyes are being talked about.  Since &quot;Hieronymus&quot; is a proper name ending is &quot;s,&quot; an apostrophe-s is added: &quot;Hieronymous&#39;s.&quot;  (If it were a common noun ending in &quot;s,&quot; like &quot;grass,&quot; it would only get an apostrophe: &quot;the grass&#39; color.&quot;)<br><br>&quot;&#39;Look, we got you out of <b>this</b> glittering robes . . .&quot;<br>-&quot;Robes&quot; is plural, and the robes being talked about in this sentence have been pushed away (meaning far, rather than near), so you would use &quot;those&quot; instead of &quot;this&quot; here.<br><br>&quot;<b>Hieronymus</b> eyes widened even more when his partner wriggled out of her robes and threw <b>it</b> across the room.&quot;<br>-Again, &quot;Hieronymous&#39;s.&quot;<br>-Since &quot;robes&quot; is plural, use &quot;them&quot; instead of &quot;it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;. . . shoved one arm under her <b>partners</b> neck and started . . .&quot;<br>-&quot;Partners&quot; needs an apostrophe between the main word and the &quot;s&quot; to show ownership.

            <p>Should I waste a Permission Givers’ time so that I can set up agent pages gathering everything I learned about Androia and Hieronymus in writing exercises and the badfic games?

            <p>Headquarters has become such a big place, you could easily write decades&#39; worth of material just showing Hieronymous and Androia exploring it.<br><br>Plus, there are so many departments and divisions that don&#39;t necessarily need to involve badfic.  There&#39;s the Cafeteria and kitchens, DoSAT, Experiments and Research, Legal . . . You could also try some Intel work, so that you can look at the badfics through a more traditionally critical eye, without having to focus on every little problem.<br><br>Another solution would be to simply make up badfics for missions.  I&#39;ve never tried this myself, so I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like, but a lot of older spin-offs especially took this path.  It would give you more control over what happened in the missions, and you wouldn&#39;t have to deal with anything worse than what you can imagine yourself. :)</p>

            <p>Taking my Agents Kitty and Kay out for a spin. They&#39;re brother and sister, and Kay&#39;s the calm and logical one. Kitty... doesn&#39;t have much regard for rules.<br>Phoebe is a OC that is just popping up for fun!<br>---<br>DAY TRIP<br>---<br>“-and this,” said Kitty, throwing open the elaborately decorated door with a flourish. “is our response center. Hi, Kay!”<br>“Hey, Kitty,” her brother greeted, without looking up from the copy of Harry Potter he was focused on. “How many rules did you break today?”<br>She fidgeted a bit. “Ah, just one. Or two. Maybe. Come on in, Phoebe.”<br>The other girl looked strangely reluctant to enter the room. Maybe it was the odd splotches of Urple and Wilver that streaked the walls. Or maybe it was the Sue head nailed to the wall.<br>Kay banged his head against the page of the book. “Don’t tell me that you brought one of your friends into HQ for a tour.”<br>She shrugged. “Okay. I didn’t bring one of my friends into HQ for a tour. Come on, Phoebe,” she tugged at her friend’s arm. “The minis don’t bite. Much.”<br>“But that’s Phoebe!” Kay objected, jabbing a finger in the other girl’s direction. “I remember her! She came to your 12th birthday party! She was the one with the ice cream-”<br>“We don’t mention the ice cream,” Phoebe snapped, finding her voice at last, and sliding into the room. “Nice place. Apart from, you know, the body parts nailed to the wall-”<br>“It adds to the decor,” Kitty grinned. <br>There was a loud siren from outside. Everyone inside the room jumped simultaneously. <br>“...did you actually tell anyone you let Phoebe into the building?” Kay asked. <br>“I may have forgotten to mention that small fact,” Kitty admitted.<br>“What’s that noise?” Phoebe poked her head out the door.<br>“Internal Affairs,” Kitty told her, and motioned out into the hallway. “We should probably... you know, run.”<br>“Internal Affairs?” Phoebe screeched, allowing herself to be tugged along. “What sort of staffing do you have in this place?”<br>Kitty broke into a quick sprint, and Phoebe let go so she could run at a normal pace beside her. “Let me put it this way. IA usually deals with the agents who are a little too trigger happy.”<br>Phoebe snorted. “What sort of people do they hire here? Homicidal assassins?”<br>“Yes!”<br>They rounded a corner, and passed the open door of a Flower’s office. Phoebe stopped and stared for a moment. “Was that a flower in a business suit?”<br>“Flower,” corrected Kitty. “Capital ‘F’. And yes! They’re our bosses!”<br>“Where are we even going?”<br>“Don’t think about it!”<br>Kitty closed her eyes, and hastily slapped a hand across her friend’s forehead. She yelped in surprise.<br>“Recite the 12 times tables backwards!” the junior Agent ordered. “12 times 12 is 144... 12 times 11 is 132...”<br>Phoebe, being slightly in front, was the first of them to slam face-first into the Cafeteria door. Kitty opened her eyes and grinned. “Welcome to the Cafeteria, my dear friend!”<br>“That sounds weird,” Phoebe decided. “Don’t call me that. You have a Cafeteria?”<br>“Yeah, you don’t expect us to starve, do you?”<br>“Well, from what you’ve told me... hey, what’s in that fountain? It doesn’t look like water.”<br>Kitty pushed the doors open and dragged Phoebe through them. “Bleepka. Don’t drink it unless you want to get utterly high.”<br>“What’s-?”<br>“Bleepka? It’s bleach, mixed with aspirin, mixed with vodka.”<br>Phoebe frowned, remembering her chemistry classes. “But, that’s realistically impossible.”<br>Kitty spun around, and pointed a finger at her. “YES, I KNOW. Everyone knows that, and they don’t care. But it works. And don’t remind them that it doesn’t, ‘cause they may start trying to kill you. And we are very creative here.”<br>So saying, she continued her stalk down to a table, where she waved at a couple of elfin agents, and greeted a Time Lord in Old High Gallifreyan.<br>“Right,” she decided. “Try a hamburger. They’re wicked good. But avoid the Sue Souffles.”<br>She herself walked over to the counter and ordered three Canon Cookies, before swooping back to the table, and peering intently over at Phoebe. “So what do you think?”<br>“Of this place?”<br>“Yeah.”<br>She wrinkled her nose. “I think... it’s utterly insane.”<br>Kitty wiggled her toes under the table. “I know! Isn’t it great?”<br>Phoebe looked slightly unsure. “Uh...”<br>Behind Kitty, a cat-woman spat up a giant hairball, then walked away, leaving the clump of hair on a table.<br>“And the best thing is,” Kitty continued, oblivious. “We can do whatever we want! Basically.”<br>“Kitty,” Phoebe said quietly. “Can I go home now?”<br>“Why?”<br>“Because I think Internal Affairs is here now.”<br>A crash from the doors signified the arrival of the aforementioned Action Department. Phoebe backed away slightly, but Kitty was unconcerned.<br>“Hello!” she waved cheerfully. “If you wanted a Canon Cookie, sorry, but you’re out of luck. Now, if you had arrived about five seconds after the cookies got to our table, then maybe you could’ve got one, but...”<br>Phoebe dropped her head onto the table and sighed. She was most definitely not going to join the PPC at any point in her life.</p>

            <p>I love how the personalities of all three characters shine through, despite the short length of the piece and the lack of description.  I especially like the contrast between Phoebe, as a complete outsider wholly uninterested in joining the PPC, and Kitty, a newbie who has nonetheless embraced it.  The whole thing is frantic and exciting and silly, and very, very entertaining as a whole.</p>

            <p>(Sorta. Mostly nitpicks, though).<br>1) Bleepka is not made from real Vodka, since Bleeprin and Alcohol go boom when mixed.<br>2) The food in the Cafeteria is horrid (did my steak just move? Ew), and has been so, IIRC, since the Mysterious Somebody got booted.<br>3) I&#39;m not sure whether DIA would jump because a (non-Suvian) someone just entered HQ; after all, lots of Agents started their careers that way.</p>

            <p>Why would Agent Kitty tell the truth about the non-alcoholic character of pseudo-alcoholic Bleeprin Products? Does she look like a person who would even be aware of this &quot;unimportant little detail&quot;?<br><br>How would the DIA know that Phoebe is non-suvian if they don’t do some kind of investigation? Scaring Phoebe and making the DIA agent’s lives more difficult by running away rather than telling them who Phoebe is may just be what Agent Kitty does to have fun.<br><br>Opinions about cafeteria food may differ. I agree that the food was horrible for many years. But this was probably when the cafeteria staff was still anonymous and nobody knew where to complain. Shouldn’t we expect that named cafeteria workers try to go new ways, especially after the meatloaf incident? Apparently the cafeteria still serves traditional menus (like Sue Souffles) for agents who don’t care, so agents who don’t ask may never find out that there is other stuff.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The way I see it, it&#39;s a mix.  Obviously, they&#39;ve got gross stuff, put together from raw materials that sit around for dozens of vague time units.  Hawkelf touched on this in her <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/hawk-like_elf/story/gandmintrod.htm">classic cafeteria story</a>.  *shudder*<br><br>But we&#39;ve also seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/109VYOpXbqnCTtkCzEyMHyzhlzDjOAAz4xzLDa6rws-g/edit">in VM&#39;s spin-off</a> that at least some Cafeteria workers go on &quot;missions&quot; to collect food directly from fics (good or bad).  That stuff is probably a lot more quality and edible and, uh, homogeneous than the stuff that gets thrown together in the kitchens.<br><br>Just my take.  Right now, I&#39;m writing an interlude/mission for my cafeteria workers that will show a mix of both in the kitchens.<br><br>—doctorlit, who has sadly managed to bring up every existing cafeteria spin-off in this tiny little post </p>

            <p>You&#39;ve (probably) read missions that spork songfics.  Well, here&#39;s a mission that is, itself, a songfic!<br>* * *
<br>BEEEEEEEEP!<br><br>Agent Josie groaned and hugged the blankets tighter over her head.  Her partner had already shut off the alarm, but the RC was now filling with guitar riffs, rising in volume.  <i>Here we go again,</i> she thought.<br><br>Franklin ripped off her blankets in one easy motion.  &quot;♪Back in black♪&quot; he sang, and Josie found herself already fully dressed in PPC uniform.<br><br>&quot;♪I hit the sack♪&quot; she tried to complain, but it came out song against her will.<br><br>&quot;♪I&#39;ve been too long; I&#39;m glad to be back♪&quot;  Franklin began gathering equipment, so quickly he blurred a bit as he moved around the room.  &quot;♪Yes, I&#39;m let loose♪&quot;  He found a tied coil of rope from somewhere, shrugged, and added to the rest of the weapons.  &quot;♪From the noose♪&quot;<br><br>&quot;♪That keeps me hanging around♪&quot; added Josie, with a longing look at the rope.<br><br>Suddenly, they were jumping through the portal into the Word World.  Looking at the clouds over Barnett College, Franklin continued the song.  &quot;♪I been looking at the sky &#39;cause it&#39;s getting me high♪&quot;<br><br>Josie muttered, &quot;♪Forget the hearse, because I&#39;ll never die.  I&#39;ve got nine lives—♪&quot;<br><br>&quot;♪Cat&#39;s eyes♪&quot; Franklin interrupted, pointing to a woman with slit pupils and clothing that definitely did not exist in the 1930s.  A crowd of students and faculty was following her wake, entranced.<br><br>The two agents sang in unison, &quot;♪Abusing every one of them and running wild♪<br>* * *
<br>Once the Sue tracked down her target in Hamilton Hall, he  was awestruck by the cat-eyed woman.<br><br>In a weird, falsetto voice that didn&#39;t sound like Indiana Jones at all, he sang, &quot;♪I can tell that you are the most beautiful girl in the—♪&quot;<br><br>&quot;♪Room♪&quot; finished Franklin.  The agents were listening from outside the door to Jones&#39; office, which contained exactly two humans.<br><br>Josie snickered.  &quot;♪In the whole wide room♪&quot; she added, earning a grin from Franklin.<br><br>Inside, the Sue glowered towards the doorway.  Jones hadn&#39;t noticed anything, and continued to sing.  &quot;♪And when you&#39;re on the street♪&quot;<br><br>&quot;♪Depending on the street♪&quot;<br><br>&quot;♪I bet you are definitely♪&quot;<br><br>&quot;♪In the top three♪&quot;  Another round of snickering.<br><br>&quot;♪&#39;Cause you&#39;re so beautiful, like a . . . tree♪&quot;  The Sue raised an eyebrow at Jones.<br><br>The agents in the hallway had to cover their mouths to stop from laughing aloud at this.  Jones was either fighting the Suefluence or really, really addled by it.<br><br>Franklin started to add, &quot;♪Or a high-class prosti—♪&quot; but Josie smacked him in the nose.<br><br>The Sue <i>knew</i> she heard something that time.  She got up in a rage and walked to the doorway.  But there was nothing there, except for a nasal voice floating down from some distant hallway: &quot;♪You could be a . . . part . . . time . . . model♪&quot;<br>* * *
<br>Over a map of the world, a simple drawing of an airplane traveled from New York over the Atlantic Ocean to Egypt.<br><br>&quot;Man, I love this canon&#39;s scene transitions.&quot;<br>* * *
<br>The Agents followed the archaeologist and the . . . whatever the Sue was supposed to be from the Cairo International Airport to an unspecified pyramid.  A hidden passage had led the two characters into and endless stream of battles with an army of mummies.  (Ironically the mummies were actually canon for the continuum, but the airport shouldn&#39;t have existed prior to World War II.)<br><br>It was, perhaps, the least interesting fight scene against armies of monsters that had ever appeared in fiction.  Despite the tight quarters of the passageway, endless numbers of enemies and nearly total darkness (Jones had at least brought a torch), the Sue and Jones were meeting little more effort than they would have strolling through a country park on a quiet day.<br><br>The Sue turned a corner, knocking a mummy away with one hand and pulverizing it into dust.  The agents trailed behind just outside the range of Indy&#39;s torch light.<br><br>The Sue killed another five mummies with three bullets, barely looking to aim as she continued towards her destination with no map.  She proclaimed, &quot;♪We call them fools, who have to dance within the flames.  Who chance the sorrow and the shame that always comes with getting burned♪&quot;<br><br>&quot;♪Standing outside the fire?♪&quot; Josie questioned.<br><br>&quot;♪Standing outside the fire♪&quot; Franklin confirmed.  Then, both agents sang together.  &quot;♪Life is not tried, it is merely survived if you stand outside the fire♪&quot;<br><br>The Sue smiled at Indy, who followed along beside her, but smirked after she looked forward again.  &quot;♪We call them strong, those who can face this world alone, who seem to get by on their own.  Those who will never take the fall♪&quot;<br><br>Franklin shaped his hands into a vague airplane shape and raised is arms towards the ceiling.  &quot;♪Wanting to glide higher and higher♪&quot;<br><br>&quot;♪I can&#39;t abide standing outside the fire♪&quot;  Josie flipped open the chamber of her pistol and checked that it was loaded.<br>* * *
<br>The Sue and her tag-along canon had found a . . . thing.  It was in a large chamber hidden inside of a fake sarcophagus.  The Sue seemed to think it was very valuable, although the agents thought it would be difficult to sell something that tried to be about seven different colors at once while its edges continuously wavered, and that may or may not have been hovering in mid-air.  The agents wound up missing most of that scene due to the headaches brought on by looking at the questionable artifact for too long.<br><br>Franklin downed another smiling mouthful of Bleeprin.  &quot;♪All I know is working on drugs feels better when they&#39;re prescription!  All I know is the world looks beautiful, the world looks so damn beautiful♪&quot;  He started rocking back and forth.<br><br>Josie was taking one tablet at a time, raising it to her mouth slowly, putting it inside just after swallowing the previous one.  Then, she started chewing while reaching for the next one.  She quietly sang, &quot;♪Daydream.  I fell asleep beneath the Flowers for a couple of hours on a beautiful dream♪&quot;<br><br>Suddenly, their demeanors reversed.  Franklin slouched against the wall and drawled out,  &quot;♪Sometimes I&#39;d liked to slow things down.  Enjoy the moment.  But when I look, the moment&#39;s gone♪&quot;<br><br>Josie jerked up and smashed a fist into the stone wall.  Glancing about wildly, she sang forcefully,  &quot;♪As I spy from behind my giant robot&#39;s eyes, I keep him happy cause I might fall out if he cries.  Scared of heights so I might pass out if he flies.  Keep him on auto-pilot cause I can&#39;t drive♪&quot;<br><br>But the moment passed; Josie settled back down and put her head in her hands, while Franklin began to get jittery again.  &quot;♪All I know is work is easy when you don&#39;t stress out about deadlines. All I know is to take my medicine; I always take my medicine♪&quot;<br><br>Through her hands, Josie mumbled, &quot;♪Daydream.  I dream of you amid the Flowers for a couple of hours.  Such a beautiful day.♪&quot;<br>* * *
<br>The Sue had left Jones trapped in the treasure room, and was absconding with the torch and the unnameable something, unaware that Indy had already been neuralyzed and portalled back to Barnett.  She wasn&#39;t yet halfway back to the entrance when a male voice, accompanied by guitar chords, echoed out of the darkness.<br><br>&quot;♪You got your war on science and your dusty roads.  Reverse logic tricks and shadows♪&quot;<br><br>The Sue picked up the pace, running through the hidden passage.<br><br>&quot;♪Morbid fascination with other people&#39;s souls.  Like watching cars crash, your false bravado♪&quot;<br><br>Her running speed put out the torch, and she dropped it to clatter on the tunnel floor.  It didn&#39;t matter; she had <i>made</i> these tunnels.<br><br>&quot;♪You try to rewrite history, add a little mystery.  You&#39;re still waiting for your time to come♪&quot;<br><br>Left.  Left.  Right.  Up.  Down.  She would be out soon.  Left.  Right.  Wrong?<br><br>&quot;♪You&#39;re still waiting?  Oh the moment&#39;s gone.<br>Yeah, it&#39;s gone♪&quot;  The last line&#39;s echo faded into the background as the Sue found herself in a strange section of tunnel.  The walls were all grey, and there didn&#39;t seem to be a way out, except for the shimmering blue doorway she had just run through.<br><br>Suddenly, the treasure in her hand seemed to lurch on its own.  It settled down into one color, and the edges became defined—it had settled down into a simple gold coin.  Still valuable, but significantly less special.<br><br>&quot;No!&quot; the Sue started to shriek, but her voice changed timber halfway through, sounding more like an animal&#39;s wail.  She felt herself shrink down, suddenly very near the floor.  If she could see her reflection in a mirror, however, she would find solace upon discovering that her eyes were still the same.<br><br>A figure appeared through the portal, a woman.  She gave a simle— not a nice one.  &quot;Sorry about all the singing,&quot; she said.  &quot;My partner can&#39;t help it; he comes from <i>Glee</i>.  As you can see, he&#39;s far enough away now that it&#39;s no longer affecting us.&quot;<br><br>She raised a pistol from behind her back.  The Sue flattened her ears against her head and hissed.<br><br>&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t <i>quote</i> a song, of course.  So how about this?  &#39;You may hate me, but it ain&#39;t no lie.  Kitty, bye, bye, bye.&#39;&quot;<br>* * *
<br>Precedents broken:<br>*Missions are not songfics.

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard a single positive thing said in this community about songfics, not even the &quot;rare but possible to do well&quot; that Mary Sues get.  I have a <i>Sound of Music</i> mission in the (long distant, eventual) works, that would be treated very similarly to this.

            <p>Back in Black was the only song I recognized, although some of the other lyrics seemed familiar enough that I felt like I should know where they came from. I have to say it is more fun when the song is in the back of my mind while reading the story.<br><br>That said, this worked really well for a mission. That they sang the lyrics and the lyrics fit so well into the flow of the story was great. My usual gripe about songfics is that they misuse the song. The song&#39;s general meaning is twisted, or the lyrics taken way out of context, or the canon is severely twisted to force it to fit the song. I liked that there was an explanation with him coming from Glee. Will we see more of this aspect of his character later on?<br><br>So, interesting mission with unique style. <br><br>I saw a typo here:  She gave a simle— not a nice one. <br></p>

            <p>It was pretty tricky to find lyrics that could be molded into the story well, so I can see why well done songfics aren&#39;t easy to find.<br><br>I would like to use these two a bit more, but only if I can think of good ways to use them.

            <p>Well, songfics are definitely not my thing. But that’s mostly because I never recognize the songs, and having fun with this is probably the point of a songfic. Or maybe it isn’t.

            <p>PPC Precedent: The console always goes off in moments of idle contemplation and relaxation. Always. . . unless something worse could possibly happen.<br>Because even agents need some rest and consoles can be downright mean.<br><br>Possible relevant things to note beforehand: Lance is from the Chronicles of Amber continuum, and there&#39;s this magic thing there. It&#39;s mentioned briefly. That&#39;s it, basically.<br>There&#39;s likely to be some wonky sentences in here, so bewaaaaare.<br><br>----------------------------<br><br><u>Sentience</u><br><br> It was too quiet in the room, though no one seemed to notice. Its inhabitants had just arrived from a particularly nasty and ugly fic and both needed a little alone time.<br><br>  The top bunk, Shri decided, was super duper excellent. She had an excellent bird&#39;s-eye view of the entire room (and of Lance sort of absently wandering around), and she was just short enough that she wouldn&#39;t bash her head against the flat, grey ceiling if she were to suddenly sit up. <br>  So she shut her eyes and relaxed- or, at least, tried to. Something felt. . . tense. There was a sort of nigh imperceivable static in the air, the feeling of a storm roiling and coiling into range, and in this moment of nothing she was able to sense it. <br><br>  Sighing, she opened her eyes and stared at the blank ceiling above her. <i>I&#39;ll have to put up a poster or something</i>, she thought, as she called out, &quot;Lance?&quot;<br>  He grunted in response.<br> &quot;Does something feel wrong to you?&quot; She sat up to look down at him. <br>    He paused in his pacing to glance around, dark eyes narrowed. &quot;Yeah, actually, it does. It&#39;s been bothering me for a while. I&#39;m glad you noticed, I thought it was just in my head, or something.&quot;<br><br>  Shri slid down the ladder and put her hands on her hips, surveying the room critically. &quot;It&#39;s almost like. . . it reminds me of the caves, everything&#39;s just kind of. . .&quot; She made a vague sweeping gesture with her hands and Lance nodded in agreement. <br><br> &quot;It&#39;s too quiet,&quot; he said. <br><br> Shri hummed under her breath. &quot;That could very possibly be it.&quot; They both paused and listened. &quot;What would we normally be hearing?&quot; Shri murmured.<br>  Their gaze settled on the console in the corner of the room. <br><br>   It was too quiet. <br><br>  &quot;Oh no,&quot; Shri said. &quot;Oh no oh no oh no.&quot;<br>    Lance looked unperturbed. &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine-&quot; he began, but Shri had already strode over to it and was tapping away at the keyboard. She gave Lance a stricken sort of look, as if she&#39;d just witnessed a traumatized puppy.<br>  &quot;Lance, I think it&#39;s broken.&quot;<br>   &quot;Shri, c&#39;mon, it can&#39;t be broken, it&#39;s probably magic, or something, I dunno-&quot;<br>  &quot;When was the last time we got back from a mission and it didn&#39;t make an exceedingly loud noise while we were relaxing? No, there&#39;s definitely something wrong with it. . . come look at it using the tendril Logrus thing or whatever, will you?&quot;<br><br>  Lance sighed heavily. He stepped over to the console and placed a hand on the screen, cautiously, as if it might bite him, before shutting his eyes and carefully feeling outwards, deep into the machine.<br>  &quot;. . .I have no idea how that thing works,&quot; he admitted, stepping back from the console and shaking out his hand. It had pins and needles, which was slightly odd. &quot;So I can&#39;t fix it, if it&#39;s even broken.&quot;<br>    &quot;Then what are we supposed to do?!&quot; Shri said, her eyes wide and worried. &quot;I mean, this place probably has maintenance or something, right? I think there was a section in the handbook about that, or something-&quot;<br>  &quot;Shri, relax,&quot; Lance instructed, taking her by the shoulder. She fell silent. &quot;Worse comes to worse, we just won&#39;t have missions for a bit while we figure out what&#39;s going on, right?&quot; He grinned. &quot;Like vacation.&quot;<br><br>    She bit her lip. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t that be dishonest?&quot;<br>  &quot;Never bothered me before.&quot; Lance shrugged. Shri looked bothered.<br>   &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to do something about it,&quot; she declared, turning back to the machine. He sighed. <br>  &quot;Suit yourself.&quot; He settled himself on the bottom bunk (he&#39;d had enough run-ins with the ceiling and had reluctantly given up the higher bed for the sake of his skull), pulled the pillow over his eyes, and slipped into a deep doze. This wasn&#39;t difficult, considering the amount of work they&#39;d been doing. Fixing fic will do that to a person, or demonic creature, as it may be.<br><br>    Shri, meanwhile, tapped fervently on the keyboard. Her touch-typing skills, thankfully, were still up to par, as was her rudimentary coding knowledge. . . though it took ages just to locate the programming itself, and even then the programs were nothing like she&#39;d ever seen before. It wasn&#39;t long before she rested her face in her arms (just for a second to rest her eyes, naturally) and found herself nodding off.<br><br> The room was silent a little longer. The agents rested soundly.<br><br> The approximate amount of time for an acceptable and healthy cap-nap is about twenty minutes. Twenty minutes later, an ear-rending BEEEEEEP sliced through the air.<br> Shri made a noise that she hoped was a yelp but was really more of a short scream and Lance jerked upwards into a sitting position, promptly smacking his forehead against a beam under the upper bunk of the bed.<br>  Amidst the stream of cursing in many different languages, Shri picked herself up from off the floor where she had fallen and stumbled forward, squinting at the console.<br><br>    A bolded &quot;<b>HA HA HA HA HA</b>&quot; was prominently displayed at the top of the screen, followed by new mission information.<br>   And Shri found herself wondering, not for the first time, if they actually had a third sentience residing in the room with them.<br><br>------------------<br>A lot of dialogue and not a lot of description, so. . . I guess really short paragraphs? Whoops.</p>

            <p>Oh yes. I like.<br><br>For starters, I like the very idea. The notion that a nice thing happening to the agents is so foreign that they spend all their time trying to find the catch is hilarious. You&#39;ve done an excellent job of building their reactions gradually: first the slow realisation, then the increasingly frantic attempts to fix it.<br><br>One thing that baffles me is your paragraphing. You&#39;ve clumped some paragraphs together, and broken others apart. Is there any particular reason for this? They don&#39;t seem to be scene breaks - just random single or double line breaks.<br><br>You&#39;ve also got some split paragraphs that didn&#39;t need to be. 2 and 3, for instance - &#39;if she were to suddenly sit up. So she shut her eyes&#39; would&#39;ve worked fine. I&#39;m honestly not sure if you were trying to do something specific here.<br><br>I&#39;m also dubious about one point - the idea that the programs behind the console can be accessed and read by agents. Even allowing for the assumption that they&#39;re in anything approximating a real coding language - though, admittedly, you did say it looked weird - this seems like a really serious security flaw.<br><br>Still, it was fun to see Shri and Lance&#39;s different reactions to the situation; they were pretty convincing, though &#39;the lady doth protest too much, methinks(!)&#39;. And the ending, of course, was brilliant.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Paragraphing is one of my major vices, yeah. There. . . really isn&#39;t any rhyme or reason to it, to be honest, except for a new paragraph for dialogue by a different person. Is that necessary? I&#39;ve always operated under the assumption that that is necessary, or at least highly encouraged. I should look that up.<br><br>That is a very good point! That would be a pretty serious security flaw. If I ever go for permission and decide to edit this and make it part of my agent&#39;s canon, I&#39;d definitely change that. <br><br>Thank you so much for the concrit!</p>

            <p>First of all, you need to use a double line-break between paragraphs all the time. That&#39;s hitting &quot;Enter&quot; twice. That&#39;s the easy part.<br><br><i>When</i> to start a new paragraph is a tricky questions, and there are very few concrete rules about it. You&#39;re correct that you need a new paragraph when a new person speaks, but beyond that, it can get pretty fuzzy, especially in fiction.<br><br>However, I have some tips:<br><br>1. Start a new paragraph when a new person does something, including <i>but not limited to</i> speaking. This is especially helpful in dialogue passages. We communicate with body language, not just words, so a silent facial expression or gesture in response to someone&#39;s speech counts as a line of dialogue. This is <i>even more</i> helpful when you&#39;ve got two characters of the same gender in the scene. If everybody sticks to their own paragraphs, it&#39;s harder to confuse which of two <i>he</i>s or <i>she</i>s you&#39;re talking about and you don&#39;t have to belabor their names as much.<br><br>1.5. No, you don&#39;t have to strictly adhere to this all the time.<br><br>2. Paragraphs are used in formal writing to set off different ideas, and this more or less works for fiction, too. Each paragraph should contain a complete thought, whether it&#39;s one sentence or more. Especially long thoughts should be broken up into smaller paragraphs (each containing a piece of the thought) to save your readers&#39; eyes, though.<br><br>3. As for what constitutes a &quot;thought,&quot; consider the function of the passage you&#39;re writing. Is it dialogue, action, description, exposition...? Consider using a new paragraph when you switch functions or to a new subject of the same function. (I.e., as you would use a new paragraph for a new speaker, use a new paragraph for each step of the action, each new thing you describe, each new thing exposited, etc.)<br><br>4. Write things in the order they happen. This isn&#39;t strictly a paragraphing rule, but it helps to remember that actions should come before reactions. You can, of course, play with this—your POV character may not be privy to the action that caused the reaction, or you may want to write the reaction first for comedic effect. But always <i>know</i> what happened in what order, and that&#39;ll help your paragraphing.<br><br>~Neshomeh will shut up and go run errands now.</p>

            <p>&quot;Are you sure this is actually allowed?&quot; Kelly asked looking at Apollo from their current position, hiding behind some of the trees at the edge of the Forbidden Forest.<br>&quot;No&quot; Apollo answered bluntly as he carefully attached the Howler to his arrow. &quot;But that&#39;s why we&#39;re both doing this, so one of us can&#39;t shift the blame entirely onto the other.&quot;<br>&quot;I could of sworn the reason you gave originally was that the Charge list was too long to be read out loud and for just one howler.&quot; Kelly asked, as she too attached a howler to an arrow before carefully nocking it into her bow.<br>&quot;That too.&quot; Apollo said, raising his bow up and aiming it at where the Sue would be walking along soon as she &#39;waited for her moonlight walk with Draco&#39; that, as the Words on the edge of Apollo&#39;s vision said, would end up as a lot more than just a walk. <br>&quot;OK,&quot; Kelly agreed, aiming her bow. &quot;You&#39;ve got the first bit of the Charge list right?&quot;<br>&quot;Mhm.&quot; Apollo affirmed, as he continued to wait for the &#39;Sue to appear in his sights.<br><br>It was a few minutes later that the Sue appeared in Apollo&#39;s sight, letting out a sigh he fired his arrow, a couple of seconds later hearing a similar sound as Kelly loosed her arrow towards the Sue. Thankfully the attack worked as planned, surprising the Sue before she had time to activate the &#39;magical elemental powars&#39; that she supposedly had. Staying until the first Howler started screaming at the Sues body the two agents as the sound resonated throughout the Hogwarts grounds. <br>&quot;That went well don&#39;t you think.&quot; Apollo said as they landed back into RC 9.81 <br>&quot;Not as badly as the other one we&#39;ve done in Harry Potter.&quot; Kelly agreed, jumping back onto her bed for a quick nap. Not a moment later she jumped back up as the console gave off a slight tune, that the two agents now recognized as it receiving a message rather than a mission. <br>&quot;What is it?&quot; Apollo asked from his bed where he was putting a couple of new arrows into his quiver.<br>&quot;It&#39;s a message from the SO.&quot; Kelly replied, &quot;it wants to see us about the quote &#39;unusual ending to our last mission&#39;&quot; <br><br>---<br><br>Precedents:<br>Obviously not charging the Sue whilst it&#39;s still alive.

            <p>This was interesting. I liked the use of the Howlers to present the charge list; one of my ulterior motives in selecting this challenge was to see what ideas people came up with which could be used in normal missions, and that&#39;s definitely one. The idea of tying them to arrows, and of recording two so&#39;s the blame couldn&#39;t be laid on just one agent, was both clever and funny.<br><br>My main issue with this piece, sadly, is the middle: it took me two or three reads to figure out what had actually <i>happened</i>, though some of that might be down to not being terribly familiar with Howlers. But... well, for one thing, you never actually say the Sue is dead. She&#39;s &#39;surprised&#39;, and then the Howler screams at her, and the agents run away. Showing us her &#39;reaction&#39; in more detail - throwing up her arms, scrabbling for her wand in an effort to use her &#39;powars&#39;, then falling still as the first Howler starts up - would have made things much easier to follow. (You&#39;ve also got a missing word or two in the last sentence of that paragraph - &#39;Staying until the first Howler started screaming at the Sues body the two agents as the sound resonated&#39;. The two agents <i>what</i>?)<br><br>Anyway, I really like the way you ended the story. Yes, it&#39;s somewhat cliche (didn&#39;t Jay and Acacia have exactly the same ending once?), but it&#39;s important to show that breaking precedent =/= getting away with it. Breaking the rules and taking your punishment is a far more interesting story - and characters who <i>don&#39;t</i> face consequences are more accurately known as Suvians. So well done!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I thought I&#39;d replied to this before, but it seems I hadn&#39;t, so sorry about that. <br>Onto the concrit.<br><br>Yeah, the middle. I&#39;ve looked back at it and I&#39;ve got to agree it&#39;s nowhere near the best bit of writing I&#39;ve ever done. I think I was getting a bit too bored of the largely dialogue based first part and wanted to do something different in the middle.

Like I said before I&#39;m going to try and rewrite it now, so (despite this being halfway down the front page and much less likely to be read) I hope the second version is better than the first.<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>&quot;You that this is allowed?&quot; Kelly asked, looking at Apollo from her current position, hiding behind a tree on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.<br>&quot;No&quot; Apollo answered bluntly from behind the tree next to Kelly&#39;s. He was leaning against his tree as he carefully tied the Howler onto one of his arrows. &quot;But that&#39;s why we&#39;re both doing this, so we can&#39;t leave one person with all the blame.&quot;<br>&quot;Unless I don&#39;t fire this&quot; Kelly countered playfully.<br>Apollo glared at her for a second &quot;Then I&#39;ll leave you to explain why we the Sue died after hearing only a half completed charge list, unless you want to run in their afterwards and finish her off yourself?&quot;<br>Kelly shook her head slowly, as she too tied a Howler to an arrow. &quot;I was only joking, you realize.&quot;<br>&quot;Wasn&#39;t exactly that funny though.&quot; Apollo replied, nocking the arrow to his bow, before testing how it felt as he drew his bow back slowly.<br>&quot;So you don&#39;t mind having a bit of a lugh in the RC, but now...&quot; Kelly started.<br>&quot;Now we&#39;re on a mission, we need to focus and not try to lose our heads.&quot; Apollo interupted.<br>&quot;You don&#39;t have to be like Batman anymore, you&#39;re not in your home &#39;verse fighting for survival&quot; Kelly argued back, before sighing and testing her own bow.<br>Apollo started on a reply before stopping himself. He sighed &quot;I know, but old habits die hard. C&#39;mon let&#39;s just get this done and go home. You have got the second part of the charge list right?&quot;<br>Kelly checked her Howler, noting that it had the number two circled in the lower right hand corner she nodded and said &quot;Yep, I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m glad we&#39;re doing this instead of reading that long-ass list like we normally do.&quot;<br>&quot;That&#39;s the other reason why there&#39;s two.&quot; Apollo said, as he scanned the words that appeared on the edge of his vision, looking to see how long it would take for the Sue to be walking along as she &#39;waited for her moonlight walk with Draco&#39;, that further down the words, Apollo could see would turn into a lot more than that. &quot;It seems weird that there&#39;s a character limit on Howlers in this fic, especially seeing as the &#39;Sue sent that one to Molly Weasley that contained all the made up titles the &#39;Sue has collected.&quot; <br>&quot;Yeah&quot; Kelly agreed. &quot;Not long now right?&quot; she asked as she readied her bow.<br>Apollo double checked the words. &quot;Any second now.&quot; He replied, drawing his own bow back properly this time, aiming for the correct spot between the trees in which the Sue would be waiting. <br>--<br>&quot;There she is&quot; Kelly whispered a couple of minutes later as the Sue finally appeared in sight. &quot;You goi--&quot; She was interupted by a slight whistling sound as Apollo loosed his arrow. Sighing to herself Kelly loosed her own bow at the Sue, watching as the Sue turned around as her &#39;elemental powas&#39; alerted her to the arrows flying towards her, although she was unable to react quickly enough as the first arrow struck her right shoulder, just as she released her wand from the holder on her wrist, Kelly&#39;s arrow struck her second, getting her in the centre of the left side of her torso. As the first Howler exploded and started to shout the beginning of the charge list at the dying Sue, Kelly nocked another arrow into her bow. &quot;Apollo guide my aim&quot; she muttered to herself quickly, hoping her father could hear her, or else that her partner would be a better shot than her, not of course that she&#39;d ever admit it to Apollo. Loosing her arrow, Kelly heard the second Howler explode into life, it&#39;s voice resonating throughout Hogwarts&#39; grounds.<br>&quot;She&#39;s done for&quot; Apollo called, his eyesight allowing him to see through the dying flames that the Sue had &#39;conjured&#39; to protect herself, as he noted that the Sue was lying still with four arrows sticking out of her. &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;<br>&quot;Right behind you&quot; Kelly replied, activating their portal back and following Apollo through it. <br>--<br>&quot;That went well don&#39;t you think.&quot; Apollo said as they landed back into RC 9.81<br>&quot;Not as badly as the other one we&#39;ve done in Harry Potter.&quot; Kelly agreed, jumping onto her bed for a quick nap, although it was less than a moment later that she jumped back up as the console gave off a slight tune, that the two agents now recognized as it receiving a message rather than a mission.<br>&quot;What is it?&quot; Apollo asked from his bed where he was putting a couple of new arrows into his quiver.<br>&quot;It&#39;s a message from the SO.&quot; Kelly replied, &quot;it wants to see us about the quote &#39;unusual ending to our last mission&#39;&quot;        </p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to throw this out as a series of points, rather than a cohesive review; it&#39;s easier that way. Note: these are in no particular order.<br><br>-The actual course of events was much clearer; well done!<br><br>-Double-spacing paragraphs makes internet text much more readable. That or indenting them, but the internet prefers double-spacing.<br><br>-You have a few typos of various kinds dotted around. &#39;explain why we the Sue died&#39;, &#39;a bit of a lugh&#39;, &#39;run in their afterwards&#39;. I mostly noticed them right at the beginning, though.<br><br>-You&#39;re running into run-on sentences. Apollo&#39;s &#39;then I&#39;ll leave you to...&#39; is one example, but take a look at &#39;the other reason why there&#39;s two&#39; - your first sentence runs clear down to the second set of speech marks. The shooting scene consists mostly of two gigantic sentences. If you break these up, it will both sound more natural, and convey the passage of time better.<br><br>-I like the character-building in the first half; I get a very clear idea of how the two agents are different, and who they used to be.<br><br>-... why did Kelly fire two arrows? I see Apollo did so, too - why? Was the plan explicitly to wound and incapacitate her, then kill her once the Howlers were done? No, because Kelly fires before she hears her Howler kick in. So... why two arrows?<br><br>-Apollo interrupting Kelly&#39;s question by shooting was funny. :D<br><br>Overall comments: much improved. You have a much better flow across the story, and give us people we can be interested in. Sort out what are essentially formatting issues (in a broad sense that includes sentence structure and typos) and you&#39;ll be made.<br><br>(&#39;Made what?&#39; I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s an idiom so it doesn&#39;t have to make sense)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Because I forgot to add these to the end of the piece. Obviously the same precendents as before were broken, but I tried to put a bit more characterization into it as well as fixing the previously badly written middle and trying to give a bit more information about the &#39;fic&#39; itself that they&#39;re sporking.</p>

The Flower had been antagonising her ever since he and the Coriander showed up in her RC, claiming that they needed to &#39;observe agent operating methods in the field, to determine what, if anything, need be changed&#39;. She wasn&#39;t entirely sure it was deliberate, but on the other hand, she wasn&#39;t inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br><br><i>If I might interject with an interruption,</i> the Coriander said, her tone thoughtful, <i>would I be correct in thinking, and voicing my conclusion, that this chapter is the final, ultimate, or last chapter of the story in which we are currently situated?</i><br><br>&quot;... currently situated,&quot; Sandra mumbled, trying to parse the question. &quot;Uh... yes, ma&#39;am, it&#39;s the last chapter.&quot;<br><br><i>As I deduced, or perhaps recalled.</i> The Coriander spread out her leaves, angling them towards the Words. <i>And would it be both accurate and correct if I were to state my belief that the current time, being the portion of the story or badfic in which we are waiting, is in fact close to the final line and end of both chapter and scene, which could be said to be imminent, or indeed upon us?</i><br><br>&quot;... come again?&quot;<br><br>The Coriander shook herself irritably. <i>To the Hole with this,</i> she growled. <i>Agent Cassandra: the story is almost over.

Her eyes widened. &quot;You could have said something!&quot;<br><br><i>I did, in fact-</i><br><br>&quot;No time!&quot; Grabbing her bow from where it lay, Sandra ran back through the trees, not heeding the branches that snagged at her hair and jacket. &quot;Not gonna have time to charge her,&quot; she panted, leaping over a rock. &quot;Come on, come on...&quot;<br><br>She reached the bluff overlooking the old road and skidded to a halt, already nocking an arrow to her bow.

            <p>Oh man.  This was so fun to read.  I love that—well, let&#39;s go in order.<br><br>I love that the SO refers to the Sue as <i>the infestation</i>, because it feels like a call-back to &quot;Origins&quot; where the Flowers thought of the Psuedos as illness/parasitic.  It&#39;s a sharp contrast to typical agents, who still use the same pronouns and other human/character signifiers towards them.<br><br>I love that the Flowers, and especially the SO, are basically sitting there MSTing Sandra&#39;s work.  It&#39;s got that insufferable &quot;my boss is watching over my shoulder&quot; vibe.  This gets reinforced by the fact that the mission&#39;s failure is entirely, undeniably 100% the Coriander&#39;s fault, and that it is entirely, undeniably 100% clear that Sandra will be getting all the blame.  Altogether, it shows just how confident the SO is, that even being in the field for the first time in <s>literally ever</s> decades, he&#39;s still quite unfazed by being in a Suefic.<br><br>I also like the bit of character development you&#39;ve given Sandra here.  In the past, she and Freckles have been roughly interchangeable with &quot;generic&quot; PPC agents.  Here, though, we see how dedicated Sandra is to the Duty itself.  Not only does she cry when she fails at the end, but she was even willing to skip the charge list in the actual, physical presence of two Flowers in order to get rid of the Sue.<br><br>The &quot;talking not a free action&quot; angle is an interesting one.  I might watch more closely in my future missions, for times when my dialogue goes on so long it could potentially make the agents miss something important.<br><br>As for the mission &quot;failing&quot; . . . eh.  There&#39;s really nothing preventing them from just portalling back to the beginning of the fic and starting over.  Or even just to the start of this chapter, and doing the charge list there.  This might just be my own inability to cope with failure talking.  Also, I can&#39;t help but notice they can&#39;t quite go back to HQ right away: they have an uncanonical bridge to deconstruct, with a . . . possibly uncanonical article of clothing to remove from the continuum?  Are bras a thing in Middle-earth?  I honestly have no idea.  But at least Sandra has something left to do to redeem herself a bit, even if only to herself!<br><br>You forgot one more precedent you&#39;ve broken: you made no SPaG errors for me to put in a, long obnoxious list here at the bottom!  :)</p>

            <p>How about this? <a href="10a.html">His little girl</a><a></a> <br><br>This probably might on the way too short to mission side, since it is only one chapter long and certifiably dead. <br><br>So, we have a potion gone wrong that is still nevertherless strong enought to drain Hermione of her intelligience and give it to Ron, which obviously would have turn them really OOC if this ever continued.

The effects of the potion on her. Now, let&#39;s switch to Ron&#39;s. You may remember, and hopefully you do, or you&#39;ve got short term memory loss issues, that the potion was meant to give Ron all the intelligence that Hermione lost. You might have assumed, since Ron&#39;s name was mentioned, literally, only ten times in the last chapter, compared to Hermione&#39;s twenty-four, that maybe since the potion was made so badly, Ron had escaped all its effects. &quot; <br><br>So, what do you think? is this thing missionable?  </p>

            <p>I like that Selene got to show off her emotions more this mission.  I didn&#39;t realize she liked Boromir so much, so it was nice to see the scary thunder-pire acting like the typical PPC agent more.  (Full disclosure: I haven&#39;t read most of your past missions yet, so I don&#39;t know what she acted like much before I joined.  I&#39;ll get around to them eventually, but you&#39;re kind of a low archival priority, since I doubt you&#39;re leaving anytime soon. (: )<br><br>Anyway, that emotional response to Boromir made the ending scene where he dies all the better.  You can really hear from both agents&#39; dialogue that they care about Boromir, but also that they respect him too much to interfere with his life, in the way any given Sue might.<br><br>I also like the extremely subtle bit of envy going on regarding the cloak.  One thing that I think would have been improved would be seeing the action of Selene grabbing the cloak as it happened, rather than getting it as narration to Agent Kaitlyn afterwards.  I get why you did from Kaitlyn&#39;s point of view, since it reinforces Kaityln&#39;s desire to get the cloak, but it would have been more exciting from Selene&#39;s pov.<br><br>The charge scene is especially excellent.  I love that Kaitlyn delivers the charges in a way that Guinevere doesn&#39;t realize she&#39;s on the chopping block.  It&#39;s a nice gesture to a less offensively bad character, but more importantly, it allows the agent and the Sue to have a more real conversation, because the Sue isn&#39;t instantly set on guard by antagonistic words.<br><br>All in all, a fun mission, you had some entertaining little moments, and did a few things new and different.<br><br>—doctorlit, who realizes his reviews more resemble flat discussions sometimes, but hopes they are still of some value, or at least interesting to read.</p>

            <p>Replies in approximate order:<br><br>Selene has been a bit up-and-down in terms of her personality. It comes from having two authors, plus my writing style changing significantly in the middle of her run. The stories I think of as including in-character Selene are &#39;legolas by laura&#39;, <i>Crashing Down</i>, and &#39;Rejection&#39; from my Alternates&gt;Agentshipping page. Her earlier missions will probably need rewriting; the &#39;big vampire reveal&#39; in particular is just, uh, bad. (And I didn&#39;t write it, so it&#39;s not my fault! ;))<br><br>The cloak... only exists because Kaitlyn needed one when she talked to Guinevere. So I&#39;m pleased it worked out well, since it was quite last-minute! I see your point about seeing Selene take it, but you&#39;ve also hit on one of my reasons for not doing so. Additionally, I try to stick vaguely to a Kaitlyn POV - it&#39;s not consistent, but there are very few scenes where she&#39;s <i>not</i> present. Something similar happens in the next mission, mostly because I didn&#39;t want to write them trying to portal Godzilla back home...<br><br>And yeah, I had fun with that charge scene - could you tell? ^-^ I know I tend to skip over long charge lists, so I figured it would be nice to do something totally different. I&#39;m glad it gave the impression I was going for!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>(Other Potterheads, feel free to add anything I might have missed.)<br><br>Bellatrix is probably the most devoted of Voldemort&#39;s followers and is batcrap crazy. She&#39;s responsible for Neville&#39;s parents being unable to raise them because she, her husband, and Barty Crouch, Jr. tortured the Longbottoms into insanity because they thought the Longbottoms knew where Voldemort was.<br><br>As far as I know, because Bellatrix ate up her parents&#39; pureblood ideals, she was actually the favorite child, though Narcissa was also in good standing with their parents. Andromeda was disowned because she married a muggle-born, though.<br><br>There&#39;s never any indication that Bellatrix&#39;s husband (Rodolphus) was ever abusive- in fact, he&#39;s kind of in the background when she&#39;s in the scene, if he&#39;s even there at all. And if he ever tried to abuse him, she&#39;d Crucio the living daylights out of him. Yes, their marriage was arranged, but there was also never any indication in canon that Bellatrix had a problem with it. Though there are a lot of Bellamort fics out there for a reason- think Legolusters, but apply that to Bellatrix about Voldemort. Except not quite as much. Bellatrix worships the ground Voldemort walks on.<br><br>&quot;So I did what He expected of me, when Lucius ...ed up it was me who got punished by Him, so that Narcissa didn&#39;t have to worry. I became an imposter, I was locked away in Azkaban.&quot;<br><br>This here? Wrong. Bellatrix got sent to Azkaban because of her involvement in torturing Neville&#39;s parents. And when Lucius &#39;...ed up&#39;, let me tell you, he fell WAY out of favor with Voldemort.<br><br>&quot;Bellatrix Lestrange is getting up from her seat and walks out of the room. The Death Eaters look after her as if she was crazy, they weren&#39;t surprised though. Bellatrix was not like anyone else, she did what she wanted and got away with it. Bellatrix decided to take a walk along the Dark Lake, Hogwarts was not a safe place for someone like her but it was the only place that made her feel something. And that was exactly what she needed, some kind of feeling.&quot;<br><br>And then while she&#39;s out there, Hermione&#39;s narration says:<br><br>&quot;I saw someone sitting on my spot, I came out here to get rid of all my problems and worries even if just for one night.&quot;<br><br>WRONG WRONG WRONG. The Death Eaters who were &#39;teaching&#39; at Hogwarts got chased out/incapacitated before the Battle of Hogwarts and Bellatrix was not one of those Death Eaters. What she was doing in Hogwarts in the first place, I have no idea, and Hermione would have been preparing for battle, not strolling along the lake. <br><br>Oh, and Bellatrix wearing yoga pants and a blue sweater? She only wears Death Eater robes, which are black. Muggle clothes are a no-no.<br><br>And the stuff about Hermione going to an orphanage because her parents didn&#39;t want a witch made me tear my hair out.<br><br>Bellatrix being self-conscious? Would never happen in a million years. She&#39;s a psychopath and she loves killing and torturing.<br><br>And lastly, you can&#39;t Apparate or Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds.</p>

            <p>Though I&#39;ll have to write myself a summary so I can follow what&#39;s going on... do we have <i>Twilight</i> minis yet? Ah, mini-Sparklewolves. So, hmm... what would a mini from Ancient Rome be? I see we have mini-Erinyes as a potential Aeschylus mini... heh. How would people take the idea of a completely abstract mini, such as a mini-Ides (as in, &#39;of March&#39;). Given the general personification-obsession of Rome and Greece, they&#39;d have a humanoid form (probably fairy-sized, with seasonal attributes depending on where and when they were encountered) - but they wouldn&#39;t always use it. A lot of the time, they&#39;d simply be a vague feeling in your mind that it was the date in question - or, if you&#39;ve got several hanging around, multiple dates.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>After a bit of inspection, MLP&#39;s legendary badfic seem to not achieve legendary status by how bad they are, or how notorious they are. Instead of filth or notoriety, legendary badfic from the ponyverse are measured by <i><b>fame.</b></i><br>The three biggest candidates for such legendary badfic are Cupcakes (of course), Rainbow Factory, and Sweet Apple Massacre, although the latter is more a classic &quot;notorious&quot; legendary badfic than a &quot;famous&quot; one.<br><br>Cupcakes is known by pretty much every brony, nor/mlp/erson, /pone/friend, pretty much any pony fan, so much that its central replacement!Sue has gotten its own name outside the fic (&quot;Pinkamena&quot;), is referenced almost constantly, has gotten cameos and central/side character status in everything from fanfics to videos to comics to fan songs, and even has nor/mlp/eople and /pone/friends calling her thier waifu.  Despite its being killed by the PPC, I think it&#39;s reaching canon break status, as Pinkie&#39;s depressed state in &quot;Party of One&quot; (which aired about the same time Cupcakes was released) has been co-opted by Cupcakes fans as Pinkamena in canon, with most Pinkamena fanart using depressed!Pinkie&#39;s straight hair.<br><br>With Rainbow Factory, it&#39;s easier to see why it got famous. Rainbow Factory, a songfic noteable for having an author-insert bit character who is killed in the fic, was based on a song of the same name (that is just as grimdark and uncanon) by WoodenToaster that pretty much exploded in popularity, and piggybacked off the song&#39;s success when WoodenToaster himself put a link to the fic in the song&#39;s Youtube description. Since then, WoodenToaster has teamed up with H8Seed to make a sequel to the song (&quot;Awoken&quot;) that has become just as popular (and is just as grimdark and uncanon), and a third artist, SylphStorm, has made a song inspired by &quot;Rainbow Factory&quot; (both song AND fanfic) AND &quot;Awoken&quot;, called &quot;Pegasus Device&quot;. The reason I mention &quot;Pegasus Device&quot; is because it is auditory gold, and explicitly references the fic, which is a prime example of fanart that C[EXPUNGED]n and other non-mlp legendary badfics (well, except maybe Half Life: Full Life Consequences, but that&#39;s more parodic than fanart) still haven&#39;t claimed to themselves. Luckily, unlike Cupcakes, it is not an impending canon break scenario, but it does have its fair share of pretty much every kind of fanart.<br><br>With that said, I must now leave. I apoligize, but I have abandoned plans to create a PPC spinoff at the moment, as I have other, more pressing problems to tackle both elsewhere on the Internet and in real life. However, I will be monitoring this, my last thread, for a while, and sometimes may pop in and create a thread.<br><br>This is Anonymouse, signing out.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s...fairly disturbing information, to be honest.

            <p>The set of fanfic that has its own fanfic, or other fanart (or fansongs, in this case) has to be pretty small. Obviously there&#39;s the PPC and OFUM - and a lot of the other members of the broader Canon Protection Initiative - but we&#39;re weird. People write parodies of &#39;My Immortal&#39; all the time, but that&#39;s different - it&#39;s not serious fanfic, it&#39;s, well, parody.<br><br>There&#39;s always <a href="http://pika-la-cynique.deviantart.com/gallery/772068/Girls-Next-Door">Girls Next Door</a>, the fancomic of <a href="http://asherhyder.deviantart.com/gallery/">Roommates</a>... the theme here seems definitely to be &#39;megacrossovers&#39;.<br><br>But as far as I&#39;m aware, your MLP examples don&#39;t fit that theme (though I suppose &#39;Fallout: Equestria&#39; comes close - it definitely has its own fandom, whether you call it good or bad). You&#39;re right - they&#39;re definitely different to the classic style of badfic.<br><br>I wonder if this might be down to the general structure of the fandoms in question? LotR fandom, for instance, has always been (well, since the movies) primarily teenaged girls who have a crush on one of the characters. ;) The writer of &#39;C<em>l</em>br__n&#39; wasn&#39;t one of those - and that&#39;s not the sort of fic they tend to write - and so it hasn&#39;t gone &#39;mainstream&#39;.<br><br>MLP, from my understanding, has an older fanbase, and fans are typically male. I dunno... it seems like there&#39;s a key difference in there somewhere, but I don&#39;t know enough to spot it. Something to do with what brings people to like MLP, in contrast to something like <i>Harry Potter</i>? Perhaps either the nature of the show or the makeup of the fandom makes them more inclined to focus on dark-themed stuff (even if hideously overdone), whereas other hosts of LBs - LotR, HP, <i>Redwall</i> - have enough dark themes of their own that uber!dark!gruesome fanfics are just over the top and generally ignored.<br><br>Honestly, I&#39;m just rambling here.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The MLP fandom is notorious for this. The crowning pinnacle of MLP legendary goodfic is Fallout:Equestria, and it&#39;s popular enough to trump Cupcakes, gaining tons of fanart, tons more of spinoff fanfics, and even an entire Fallout:Equestria general on /mlp/ that was one of the first generals to make the jump to /pone/, beating out both Anon in Equestria and Flutterrape, mentioned in my other reply to this comment. (For the record, there may be occasional Pinkamena threads, but never a Cupcakes general, and often, half the thread or more refers to the actually-canon depressed!Pinkie as Pinkamena instead of Cupcakes!Pinkie.)<br><br>The problem here is that there&#39;s not much difference in theme between Fallout:Equestria and the legendary badfics Rainbow Factory and Cupcakes. In the two legendary badfics, it&#39;s a straight injection of grimdark into one part of MLP, while in Fallout:Equestria, the entire world is fused with the very, very grimdark Fallout universe. The difference between FO:E and the two legendary badfics is the execution- it&#39;s set a long time into the future, almost all of the canons are either dead and depicted as pretty much in character plus a few years, justified by maturity in the case of Spike, or justified by something going wrong in thier mind, like Trixie.  (At least until the point I&#39;ve read.) The ENTIRETY of the rest of the world is either Fallout canon modified to fit Equestria&#39;s world- and pretty well, I might add- and OCs. TONS AND TONS of OCs, allowing the author to create her own characters. The good thing there is that there are no sues.<br><br>In contrast, the legendary badfics focus on the actual characters, and are exexuted badly. However, Sgt Sprinkles and Aurora Dawn got the same kind of fans that FO:E did because they kept the same theme, except not hiding behind Fallout.<br><br>So yeah, they aren&#39;t teen girls with crushes on the characters, they&#39;re teen-to-young-adult guys with crushes on the characters (seriously, they call them &quot;waifus&quot; and &quot;horsebandos&quot; on /mlp/ and /pone/) and a taste for grimdark.</p>

            <p>Well, I do believe that that&#39;s the difference. Many MLP fans do actually like grimdark things- in fact, reading Cupcakes, Rainbow Factory, and other MLP grimdark fanfiction actually brought me into the fandom.<br><br>In addition, the pony fandom started in 4chan, where the fandom was and still is tolerant (ha ha) of such fanfic to the point of it being written there as greentext on a daily basis. The fact that Cupcakes&#39;s author is unknown and had to be claimed by Sgt. Sprinkles, and had horrible grammar, points to its being created originally in a comment box for /co/&#39;s MLP general, for a pony thread on /b/, or, later, for /mlp/.<br><br>Pattycakes (brought up elsewhere in this thread) probably has a similar genesis, as even now on both /mlp/ and /pone/ there&#39;s a &quot;diaper general&quot; for diaper/age regression fetishists, where ponies of various ages are posted wearing diapers and other baby gear in various states of use in various circumstances. In fact, a readthrough of it tells me it wouldn&#39;t be out of place posted in that general.<br><br>Rainbow Factory, Cheerilee&#39;s Garden, and a few other grimdark fics tell me that the early-in-the-genesis-of-the-fandom Cupcakes set a theme for other grimdark fics to follow, and each one existing is bringing fans of such grimdark tales that would love for it to be canon, explaining Cupcakes as a canon hazard.<br><br>However, a greater hazard to canon is /pone/ and /mlp/. While they are sticklers for SPaG- you learn to be when the only true content someone can make for a year or two is greentext or CYOA- nobody blinks an eye if a greentext takes a pony out of character, and they have no qualms about self inserts somehow appearing in Equestria. The pinnacle of both is &quot;Flutterrape&quot;- a general consisting of greentext where Fluttershy is thrown so out of character that the general has to define what the Flutterrape Fluttershy is supposed to do in the OP- and &quot;Anon in Equestria&quot;- a general about Anonymous, which is a self insert sue designed so that anyone reading the fic can simply say it&#39;s themselves, landing in Equestria via various means, including magic portals, suicide (yes), and magic teleportation spells gone wrong. Many greentexts don&#39;t die anymore when the thread dies either- they are capped (screenshot) or copied into Pastebin first.<br><br>And we wonder why MLP is in so much canon danger.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure how you couldn&#39;t find the song, WoodenToaster/Glaze is a pretty big artist. He&#39;s also known for Avast Fluttershy&#39;s Ass- a remix of Avast your Ass by Kitsune<sup>2</sup>)- and Beyond her Garden- which pretty much takes the record for the most remixed/covered song I&#39;ve ever seen.<br><br>You were looking in Youtube, right?</p>

            <p>All I knew at the time was that &quot;Rainbow Factory&quot; was based off a song, not that it was a brony who wrote it. I looked for the song the way I look for any song when I know the lyrics but not the title: I looked up the lyrics in Google. IIRC, I ended up finding links to the fic and to riffs of it, but not to the song.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right, both Rainbow Factory and Awoken (the Woodentoaster ones, Awoken being a collaboration with H8Seed) leave a lot to the imagination as to what actually happens in the factory, evidenced by the various music videos. Both of the most popular versions involve sucking the color out of adult ponies, and I&#39;ve seen a third (possibly for a remix) showing the grinding up of dead bodies that have to be pulled out of coffins. However, it does go &quot;In the Rainbow Factory, where not a single soul gets through...&quot;</p>

It wouldn&#39;t be anything hugely complicated, I&#39;d just need things like company logos, maybe renders of trophies or title belts, etc. The game does use 3D renders of characters but only portraits, head and shoulders at most, so nothing someone decent with something like Daz3D couldn&#39;t do. Logos probably aren&#39;t too complicated either, we&#39;d be looking at something like these images: <a href="http://imgur.com/is6GZUn,HvqPuEG,g8yEalq,iwxDst5,S9SMrDP,x9FJ57o,VQytYgk,AqjZkb9,m8OozbG,EL8dASg"><a href="http://imgur.com/is6GZUn,HvqPuEG,g8yEalq,iwxDst5,S9SMrDP,x9FJ57o,VQytYgk,AqjZkb9,m8OozbG,EL8dASg">http://imgur.com/is6GZUn,HvqPuEG,g8yEalq,iwxDst5,S9SMrDP,x9FJ57o,VQytYgk,AqjZkb9,m8OozbG,EL8dASg</a></a></p>

            <p>Hi! So I&#39;ve recently had a lot of work and I get the feeling that this weekend I&#39;m going to want to just sketch for a bit to unwind, especially since it&#39;s a long weekend.<br>Ergo, free sketches! Or more specifically, headshot sketches, I suppose? Haha. . .<br><br>Some notes:<br>• I&#39;m better at humanoids, though I can definitely give something more animalistic a shot. . .?<br>• Max of two characters per person!<br>• Depending on how I feel/how many requests I get it may or may not have some color slapped on, or some watercolor (because I&#39;ve been trying to practice that).<br>• Because I don&#39;t want to be totally swamped, it would be cool to reply before tomorrow eveningish, say. . .3 or 4 PM EST? So approximately 3:30 PM EST on Friday, October 9th. 8)<br><br>If you want one, please supply me with either a pretty detailed written description or a reference image! Otherwise I will make it up or just skip it entirely, haha.<br><br>If I don&#39;t get a lot, you can probably expect most of them by Sunday afternoon; otherwise it&#39;ll probably be Monday, and if not then, then next weekend. Whatever the case, I&#39;ll definitely get to everyone&#39;s!<br><br>Here are examples, if you want an idea of what my style is like!<br>8)<br>So go forth and request!<br><br><img src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/8b84bdda6a24beda55ab301b414d93bf/tumblr_nd72879amO1tnma71o1_1280.jpg" width="500"> <br><br><img src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/69dd04ccb00f3d30ae8a9d1f4193e568/tumblr_nd71mub9dR1tnma71o1_1280.jpg" width="500"></p>

            <p>To start: posting! What I will probably do is a lot on one page, so when I finish all of them I&#39;ll comment on this thread with a higher quality scan so you can crop and use what you please. However, so you don&#39;t have to wait for me to finish all of them, I&#39;m going to reply specifically to your comment with a lower quality iPod photo so you can at least see them as I finish them. <br><br>On reposting: you can basically do whatever you want with them! Websites, PPC wiki, etc., etc., are all fair game. I just ask that you don&#39;t somehow make money off of them (I doubt I&#39;d have any trouble with that, but better safe than sorry) and some form of credit wherever you use it would be nice!<br><br>That&#39;s all! Thanks again!!</p>

            <p>I am a sucker for fanart. I&#39;m gonna have to put a gallery on my website at some point...<br><br>Anyway, my requests:<br><br>1. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill">Human!Ilraen</a>. I&#39;ve only done one picture of him myself, and it&#39;s <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Hey-Over-Here-394805696?q=gallery%3ANeshomeh%2F11844615&amp;qo=1">not very accurate</a>. Also, I haven&#39;t managed to cobble together a decent description of his face in one place yet, which doesn&#39;t help. Lemme see... He should look like a combination of <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/neshomehswork/jenni.jpg">Jenni(1)</a> <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Ten-Portraits-91220995?q=gallery%3ANeshomeh%2F11844615&amp;qo=11">(2)</a>, <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Lo-We-Are-Not-So-204165731?q=gallery%3ANeshomeh%2F11844615&amp;qo=3">Nume(1)</a> <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Ten-Portraits-91220995?q=gallery%3ANeshomeh%2F11844615&amp;qo=11">(2)</a>, and <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Ginger-26611165?q=gallery%3ANeshomeh%2F11844615&amp;qo=18">Ginger</a>.

He&#39;s five and is the Mpreg baby of Harry Potter by Severus Snape. He&#39;s not the best-looking kid—I imagine he&#39;s got kind of a long, thin face even at this age, and I dunno what age the nose will really come in, but that&#39;s something he has to look forward to. He&#39;s fairly happy, though, which helps. He also has green eyes, which has nothing to do with genetics. His hair is black, and I don&#39;t have a solid idea of the style, just that it&#39;s thin and therefore difficult to control and prone to static.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

She was fair-skinned, with blue eyes and flowing cyan hair that reached halfway down her back. A pair of rope braids went around the sides of her head. She was five-foot-nine and currently wore an elegant cyan dress over a golden bodice. The dress had flecks of silver in it that sparkled in the sunlight, matching the silver tiara on her head.</i><br><br>To give some points of reference, she is supposed to be the sister of King Zenoheld, (the figure in the center of <a href="http://bakugan.wikia.com/wiki/File:Vestal_Height_Chart.jpg">this picture</a> and the aunt of Prince Hydron (the figure on the left).</p>

Think like a Luxray from Pokйmon. He wears a black leather jacket, unzipped over a yellow t-shirt, with the DMS flash patch on the jacket&#39;s right shoulder. He&#39;s very slender and gangly. His skin resembles that of an Asian/Caucasian mix and his eyes are an orangeish-yellow.<br><br>*sits back with a silly grin to wait*</p>

            <p>(What? All the cool kids were saying it)<br><br>I may be fairly predictable, but... can you do <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Kaitlyn_(Agent)">Kaitlyn</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Selene_Windflower">Selene</a>? They both have pictures on their bios, but here&#39;s a few extra notes:<br><br>-Kaitlyn is based on the same person as <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Constance_Sims">Constance</a>, (ie, Boarder!Kaitlyn), so you can use the Constance picture as an extra reference. She&#39;s rather more cheerful, though. And shorter, though I doubt that&#39;ll get into headshots... and her hair tends to curl. Actually, <a href="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/AgentConstance.jpg">this</a> might be the best &#39;Kaitlyn&#39; reference (other than her bio picture).<br><br>-Selene is... basically that image, except that image is rubbish. So&#39;s <a href="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/AgentSelene.jpg">her other picture</a>. Um. The picture of <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/TCDAFairytale.htm">Serenity</a> on there is pretty good, though Selene tends more towards &#39;black leather coat&#39; than corsetry.<br><br>Basically, she&#39;s a tall, thin Chinese woman with long, straight black hair. Since she&#39;s a vampire, she has mildly pointed canines, and a red hint to her eyes (which can just be plain red if you like, and if you&#39;re colouring). She currently has a steampunk device on the left side of her face, described as &#39;a tangle of copper pipes and brass cogs&#39;, that makes her look kind of like a Steampunk Borg.<br><br>Did that make any sense? I really need to make Sel a proper bio image one of these days...<br><br>And: I like your style. It&#39;s giving me a definite Art Nouveau feel, with the curves and naturalistic shapes - the agents&#39; hair, the framing on the colour image. Nice stuff.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I particularly like Kaitlyn; that&#39;s definitely going on her Wiki page. Selene I like... pretty much except for her mouth; I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s bothering me about it, though.

            <p>The rather blue shadows? Or... hm. I was thinking it&#39;s pretty low-contrast, and Kay seems to have light eyes, but that side of the image is a bit darker than the other, so that might be messing with it. ... Also, my laptop screen is pretty terrible, so I shouldn&#39;t even try to comment on issues of color from here. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Could be that the features are a bit pinched, though?<br><br>Anyway, I don&#39;t mean to pick on you. I like your work, and as someone else said, I&#39;m looking forward to seeing my characters. I know I&#39;m last in line, and I shall be patient. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh, who has zero—actually, make that <i>negative</i> room to complain about waiting for art. &gt;.&gt;</p>

            <p>Very nice. I&#39;m resisting the urge to use too many smilies right now.<br>Can you please draw Agent!Des and the Librarian?<br>You can find a description of the Librarian <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fVyYpwPqPDdgdyzptIIK8VA46AYzdZZ7J-qgYrijy2g/edit?usp=sharing">at the beginning of this mission</a> and a description and a sketch of him <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Librarian">here in the wiki</a>; Des is described <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Desdendelle">in his page</a>. He&#39;s also described thus (from an elf&#39;s point of view):<br>That someone was human, male, and slightly shorter than the 1.8-metres tall elf. He sported a messy, if short, reddish-brown goatee and moustache and short brown hair, and was currently wearing black pants with lots of pockets and a green shirt. He had some weird thing on his face – a thin frame that held two pieces of glass near his eyes.</p>

            <p>This is still happening!

            <p>The best I&#39;m able to do is cartoons. I can&#39;t comment on how well they match Des&#39; idea of what they look like, but they look spot-on to my headcanon. ;)</p>

            <p>Also, I think this is the second &#39;Rats does art&#39; post where I&#39;ve missed my chance to actually request art.

            <p>It&#39;s entirely possible that the first was someone else; I could easily have seen two similar art posts spaced a ways apart and just assumed that since you did this one you also did the first one. Come to think of it, the drawing style was kind of different. Oh well.<br><br>Glad to hear there will be more! In the meantime, I&#39;ll continue my own (very slow) attempts at drawing my own characters...<br><br>Watercolors, though. Haven&#39;t tried using them for portraits in ages.
