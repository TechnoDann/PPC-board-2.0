            <p><a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon">Againt the Moon</a> is up to 660k+ words, 105 chapters, and three thousand reviews. I&#39;ve been following it for over a year and a half and it is excellent if you&#39;re interested in Marauders Era stories. You can probably guess from the title, but it mostly focuses on Lupin, with a very good amount of character development for all the Marauders- even Peter. <br><br>The SPaG is practically flawless and there are little nods to canon that let you know the author&#39;s been following updates on Pottermore. Actually, the only &#39;major&#39; canon break we get is the names of Lupin&#39;s parents, and the author didn&#39;t go change them because it would be jarring to the readers.<br><br><br>The other one I&#39;d like to mention is <a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse">Reverse</a>. It&#39;s definitely much darker, and I will say now it&#39;s rated M for a lot of violence and some heavily implied sexual activities. However, I think it&#39;s fantastic. Once again, the SPaG is excellent and the plot- oh man, where to start without giving away spoilers? Basically, Hermione gets transported to an alternate universe where everything is reversed. The good guys are Tom Riddle and his resistance (made up of who we know to be Death Eaters) and Dumbledore is the evil overlord who plans to take over the world by merging wizard magic with muggle technology and enslave anyone who dares fight back.<br><br>The whole story is one big Mind Screw and I dare you to not ship Hermione/AU!Draco by the end of it. I&#39;m not gonna lie though; it&#39;s really disturbing to see the characters who we&#39;ve always known as the good guys start torturing for the fun of it and basically being like canon Death Eaters. I&#39;m just going to say take caution if you decide to embark on this one.<br><br><br>So, all my fellow Potter fans, check them out! And everyone, feel free to share your favorite goodfics! It seems like the majority of our fanfic threads are badfic-based. Let&#39;s mix that up a little! </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve started reading Reverse, and it is truly fantastic. If you&#39;re a fan of the Potterverse and know anything about the characters, you need to read this. As Ixi mentioned, the setting is basically Bizarro!Hogwarts where Dark Arts combined with Muggle technology are used to advance wizarding society. Light-side magic is actively shunned. The entire plot is riveting, and the author handles situations masterfully while keeping each AU person in character. I&#39;ve only found one grammar error in twenty chapters of reading, which was a missing space. I highly recommend this as an example of what fan fiction SHOULD be. </p>

            <p>Let me give y&#39;all a few others! (Probably just two or three; typing on this phone is weird)<br><br>First up, we have &quot;He Says He is an Experimental Theologian&quot; by Sailor Ptah: <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1062757/chapters/2131218"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/1062757/chapters/2131218">http://archiveofourown.org/works/1062757/chapters/2131218</a></a> A Welcome to Night Vale/His Dark Materials crossover AU that (coincidentally( explains a few questions about the show, like &quot;How does Cecil always know exactly what&#39;s going on in Night Vale if he&#39;s always in the radio station?&quot; and &quot;Why all the fuss about Telly giving Carlos a trim anyway?&quot; (Turns out that was a cover for something else.) The OCs (primarily Carlos&#39;s team of scientists) are plot-relevant but not scene-stealing, the writing feels like an actual episode, and most important, Tamika Flynn is a badass.<br><br>Next, Meta-Akira&#39;s &quot;Beneath the Veneer&quot; series: <a href="http://meta-akira.deviantart.com/art/Beneath-the-Veneer-Intro-255113516"><a href="http://meta-akira.deviantart.com/art/Beneath-the-Veneer-Intro-255113516">http://meta-akira.deviantart.com/art/Beneath-the-Veneer-Intro-255113516</a></a> Pokйmon medieval AU with rebellious prince!Silver, evil king!Giovanni, and shepherd!Lyra.

            <p>I&#39;ve got my characters balanced out, a badfic to take on, working knowledge of this crazy verse, both permission prompts written and plothole-free, just enough confidence...I think I&#39;m ready.<br><br>Agent 1<br>Name: Chris<br>Age: 20/11 (it&#39;s complicated)<br>Species: Human<br>Appearance: <br>-Hair: black, slightly spiky<br>-Eyes: grey<br>-Body type: skinny but toned. Average height.<br>-Always wears a red-and-white baseball hat with a red jacket, black-and-gold shorts (black with gold accents), and red sneakers.<br>Home continuum: Pokйmon Silver Version<br>Department: Floaters (for now)<br>RC: #2319 (yay Monsters Inc. jokes!)<br><br>Chris started life as the player character in my old Pokйmon Silver game. I got pretty far, up to the Elite Four, but I lost the cartridge years ago. I don&#39;t want to leave a good character hanging, so for our purposes, Chris has been stuck in Limbo since about 2005 HST and only recently fell through via plothole (of course). He doesn&#39;t remember a lot of what he did in Johto, at least not very clearly. He isn&#39;t even sure what Pokйmon were last on his team; only his starter, Meganium, came with him. <br><br>Limbo&#39;s a strange place, so Chris is a strange boy. For one thing, he&#39;s physically a twenty-year-old man even though he still thinks of himself as eleven. He has trouble sleeping at night and jumps at shadows now and then. He&#39;s very protective of the things he has, especially Meganium and the Johto region as a whole. (To be fair, he might have a minor hero complex as well.) Knowing he&#39;s done things like kicking the pants off Team Rocket, beating the Gym Leaders, and a few Bug-Catching Contests, but not remembering how he did them is very frustrating for him. Also, because Johto changed so fundamentally with HGSS, he&#39;s not sure he&#39;d recognize much if he went back. But that&#39;s something to explore/angst over another day. The point is that Chris has a new place where he can work hard and generally be useful. (Well, Pokйmon is an inherently social game...)<br><br>Chris is the serious/sarcastic one in my agent pair, generally being quick to point out flaws in the Sue&#39;s plans or awful dialogue/word choices. (Sometimes with a facepalm as well.) He&#39;s totally OK with not-World-One(-based) creatures <strike>like minis</strike> because, frankly, Pokйmon are plenty weird all by themselves. However, he&#39;s not nearly as forgiving of overpoweredness and/or wangst. Also, he and Ami share a Problem with bad SPaG. (Note the capital P.)<br><br>As a fairly experienced Pokйmon trainer, Chris can gauge the power level and/or recruitment potential of various Cute Animal Friends, including a Sue&#39;s Pokйmon, by observing them in action. (Ideally he&#39;d battle them, but that&#39;s not always canon or a smart move.) He doesn&#39;t have any powers himself, but he is athletic; in his words, &quot;If you train six-foot monsters for a living and <i>don&#39;t</i> gain muscles or lose weight, you&#39;re doing it wrong.&quot; Chris also has pretty good stamina. <br>--Meganium&#39;s known moves (read: official moveset) are Synthesis, Body Slam, Poisonpowder, and Solarbeam. He&#39;ll come along on Pokйmon-verse missions as security in case Chris ends up challenging the Sue or something. (Any other Pokйmon he/they adopt will more than likely guard the RC.)<br><br>---<br><br>Agent 2<br>Name: Ami Seeker (pronounced Amy)<br>Age: 20 in human years<br>Species: Unicorn pony<br>Appearance: <br>-Fur: green <br>-Mane/tail: brown, curly. She keeps her mane in a slightly messy ponytail most times. <br>-Eyes: blue w/freckles at the corners<br>-Body type: stocky, a little short for a pony<br>-Cutie mark: a quarter note inside a speech bubble, representing her love of music and extensive vocabulary<br>-Accessories: black newsboy hat, purple glasses (she&#39;s nearsighted), silver heart necklace<br>Home continuum: My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic<br>Department: Floaters<br>RC: #2319<br><br>Ami is my ponysona, or what I think I&#39;d look like if I lived in Equestria. This means that personality-wise, she&#39;s basically me mixed with the inherent friendliness/kindness of FiM ponies. She tries to be respectful to everyone she talks to, or failing that, not overtly rude. Ami is somewhat confused by modern/World One technology, and spends most of her free time reading (she prefers fantasy novels), singing, or thinking up ways to obtain a grand piano for the RC. She&#39;s also what we&#39;d call a semi-fic blip; a character I thought up but haven&#39;t actually written.<br><br>I <i>could</i> be cheap and use Ami to work through my own personality issues/growth, but I&#39;m kinda already doing that with the main character in my Pearl Nuzlocke. Therefore, Ami is always ready and willing to lend a hoof wherever she may be needed. She goes overboard sometimes, though, which gets people mad at her. Since she likes being around kids, she may help out in the Nursery from time to time. Ami is afraid of bees and their meaner cousins (wasps and hornets), shying away whenever she sees one. She also gets progressively more nervous/upset the longer she feels that a situation/character doesn&#39;t make sense. It&#39;s hard for her to recover from these &quot;meltdowns&quot;, which is why she&#39;s signed up for biweekly(ish) counseling sessions in FicPsych.<br><br>Unlike Chris, Ami tries to find humor in various badfic-spawned horrors and/or give fics the benefit of the doubt. The latter is naive and potentially dangerous, and she knows it, but optimism is in her nature as a pony. (She does have a rational explanation; namely, a fic can be presented poorly but still have a solid main idea.) Only four offenses really anger her: inconsistency (including bad logic), violence towards children, bullying in general, and disrespecting the Princesses (especially Twilight). <br><br>Like all My Little Pony unicorns, Ami can channel magic through her horn. Her magical aura is the same shade of blue as her eyes. Ami&#39;s magic, besides letting her move things without touching them, centers around music. Specifically her singing, or humming, or even playing piano. She can also cast illusions of things, but they look vaguely ghostlike and cannot make noise. (Illusion magic is more Trixie&#39;s shtick anyway.) As a cartoon character, she is able to take a fair amount of physical abuse/slapstick, though she would prefer not to whenever possible. Being a (variety of) horse, she&#39;s also a faster runner than Chris.<br><br><br>For your reading convenience (I tend to ramble a bit when I write stuff), here are the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10wqc2ds8sUxlByecfS7Nh6zbfYbMRMwV98A44aea-fc/edit?usp=sharing">control prompt</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NEng0xbjlit29fsa52p5iGkT12b5WK-VY0pk7YD26iw/edit?usp=sharing">random prompt</a> in all their Google Doc glory.<br><br>My first target is <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/894267/">here</a>.<br><br>Questions?

            <p>You: well, I recognise your name, and you don&#39;t set off any mental alarm bells, so no problem there. ;)<br><br>Characters:<br><br><b>Chris</b> - seems fairly inoffensive. I&#39;m glad you highlighted that Meganium only comes along in Pokeverse missions - that&#39;s been a rule for a long time, which is why Jay and Acacia never took their minis in with them. Plus the fact that he&#39;s essentially a living weapon - yeah, good call.<br><br>(Random thought - if Chris comes across Agent Falchion in the corridors, would he try to battle him? What would happen if a PPC agent got himself stuffed into a Pokeball? Eek.)<br><br><b>Ami</b> - why isn&#39;t it pronounced &#39;Ami&#39;? I&#39;m assuming naming her &#39;Friend&#39; was deliberate, here, in which case, nice one. ;) Again, no real problems here (do ponies have glasses? I&#39;m assuming so, since you don&#39;t include that under &#39;confused by modern technology&#39;; if not, a <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndCorrection.htm">story where she gets them</a> is always fun). The magic seems low-key enough not to be a problem. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;ll still work when she&#39;s in disguise, since it&#39;s not specifically related to a physical attribute - you say it&#39;s &#39;channelled&#39; through her horn, but actually invoked by music (very Tolkien, that).<br><br>So yeah, no problems there. On to the meat of things: the samples.<br><br><b>Control Prompt</b> - Hey, this is good! I&#39;m pretty sure I just wasted my time reading the bios - this story covers pretty much everything I needed to know. The one thing I flagged up as &#39;huh?&#39; is Chris apparently being &#39;deadpan&#39; when he explains a Pokeball - usually that word indicates &#39;saying something funny/telling an outrageous lie and not letting it show&#39;, which isn&#39;t what he does.<br><br>(Also, <i>Velociraptor</i> has feathers, not fur, but I guess you&#39;re thinking &#39;down-type feathers&#39; here. Well done on giving an otherwise accurate depiction of it!)<br><br>I really like the fact that Meganium is a significant player in this story, but is also <i>not</i> stealing centre-stage - the two agents are the real stars.<br><br><b>Random Prompt</b> - this one has a feel of being something of an afterthought. I like the setting, but you spent more time explaining the game than anything else. Still, it does give a nice look at their interactions.<br><br>I was disappointed that you didn&#39;t do something with the singing aspect of Ami&#39;s magic - it seems like it would be a perfect opportunity to show that off. And, of course, you have her glaring at Chris - which would be fine if you hadn&#39;t specifically described her as being almost ridiculously nice. I agree with her sentiment, but I&#39;d expect something more sad than angry from her.<br><br>Oh, and you lost the final speech mark in the story, which may contribute to the &#39;afterthought&#39; feel.<br><br>But still - despite some strange sentence structures (&quot;I did both of them because I have no idea which one’s lead&quot; is the one that makes absolutely no sense to me), it shows off Chris&#39; personality well, and gives a peek into Ami&#39;s alongside it. And, for that matter, it shows how you&#39;d write an &#39;action&#39; scene; not bad.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b> - in case you can&#39;t tell from the generally positive tone of the above, I&#39;m going to go with <u>Permission Granted</u>. Have fun!<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: How difficult did you find the Permission process? Was there anything you think was less than helpful? Can you suggest any improvements? Conversely, did anything we needed help you develop your characters more? Since I keep revising the process, I figure feedback is probably a good idea. ;)</p>

I can&#39;t wait for your first mission and our collab. :)<br><br>IIRC, Pokemon battling within the PPC HQ isn&#39;t allowed, though now that I think of it, Falchion accidentally triggering battles with other Pokemon-verse agents due to his presence alone would make for a pretty neat running gag, especially if they have a casual conversation the entire time. It&#39;ll also be a great way for him to meet new people like Chris for example - and maybe we could do an interlude about exactly that! XD<br><br>Disguises would most likely have the same abilities as the species in question, so if you&#39;re disguised as a unicorn pony, you&#39;ll be able to use unicorn magic; inversely, disguising yourself as a human will prevent you from using any special abilities, as Falchion can attest based on his first two missions. As a general rule, the abilities of a disguised form should be consistent with what the continuum in question would allow. Anything out of the ordinary would look suspicious to the canons and especially the Sue your agents are trying to kill.</p>

            <p>Can&#39;t that wait until our collab or something?! Well, at least that&#39;s a pretty interesting idea for yet another running joke...<br><br>It&#39;s funny, though - I&#39;ve seen both Pokemon Trainers and Pokemon themselves suggested as agents or staff members, and there hasn&#39;t really been much talk about what would happen if members of the two parties actually encountered each other. That could make for an interesting source of story ideas, and since my collab with eatpraylove will involve both Falchion and Chris, I suppose it would be a great opportunity to bring up this issue.

            <p>So, I was getting ready to make the wiki page for the mini-children of the night, and wanted to do my usual &quot;Canon Origin&quot; section about the relation the minis had to canon.  So I pretty much spent all of today bingeing on Wikipedia articles about <i>Dracula</i> and its many, many adaptations.  (Dracula has appeared in 217 films, though they aren&#39;t all serious adaptations of the novel.  That really is a huge number, considering the novel was only published in 1897.  That&#39;s only 117 years, and movies weren&#39;t even a thing for all that time.  According to Wikipedia, the only character to beat that number is Sherlock Holmes, who has appeared in film an also-impressive 223 times.)  I was looking for uses of Dracula&#39;s abilities to shift his shape into a wolf, or to communicate with actual wolves, which he does on multiple occasions during <i>Dracula</i> and &quot;Dracula&#39;s Guest,&quot; a short story that takes place before the novel.<br><br>And I discovered that this ability is almost universally ignored among adaptations.  The 1931 Bela Lugosi film has the Count give messages to Renfield through wolf howls, which shows at least one of these abilities, but it happens offscreen.  The 1992 Gary Oldman film has Dracula talk to a wolf at one point, but he also turns into a freaky humanoid wolfman thing for one creepy-as-hell scene, so that movie didn&#39;t get it right either.<br><br>There are only two instances (that I could find) that get this right.  One is the 2012 film <i>Dracula 3D</i>, which, from all the YouTube clips I&#39;ve watched today, seems to be the most accurate adaptation of the novel (although there is some priest dude who&#39;s not supposed to be there . . . #canon purist).  The other, and I can&#39;t believe I have to admit this, is Grandpa Sam Dracula from <i>The Munsters</i>.  While obviously not canon to the Stokerverse, Grandpa&#39;s official backstory on <i>The Munsters</i> is that he <i>is</i> the original count, having found a way to survive without feeding on humans and turned over a new leaf.  And yes, he does turn into a wolf.<br><br>Why the failure to pick up on one of Count Dracula&#39;s most awesome abilities?  Partly to blame must be the much more popular association between vampires and bats.  Bats may seem to be the better companion, since they can fly, and one genus feeds on blood.  A genus of tiny, tropical bats that would probably freeze to death in a Transylvanian summer, let alone winter.  While wolves are intelligent predators that work together to capture living prey and then kill it—yeah, no, wolves are totally a better match to vampires than bats.<br><br>Oky, well wolves are, of course, large and potentially dangerous animals.  It is reasonable for studios back in the day not to want them on set.  That doesn&#39;t excuse more recent productions to not include wolf transformations through CGI affects.  And what about non-live adaptations?  Even radio plays, comic books, and animated series that feature Count Dracula don&#39;t let him be ♪hungry like the wolf♪!  There&#39;s just no excuse for this totally awesome and totally canon ability to have fallen by the wayside for so long.  I just can&#39;t understand it!  I mean, <i>The Munsters</i> got it right.  <i>The Munsters</i>!  Gan damn.<br><br>Well, sorry for ranting all over the Board.  Just wanted to clear that off my brain.<br><br>—doctorlit, who saw way too many partly undressed humans today.  Seriously, filmmakers.  Vampire movies have way too much nudity, and not enough wolves.  Fix this.</p>

            <p>I actually read <i>Dracula</i> for the first time when writing that mission, and compiled a list of vampire abilities for reference. Let&#39;s see...<br><br>-Dracula has no shadow, as well as no reflection. The latter makes it in a lot; I&#39;m willing to bet the former is ignored for filmmaking.<br><br>-How often does weather control make it in? Dracula calls down storms on several occasions, though never with the pinpoint accuracy Selene demonstrates.<br><br>-I guess film!Dracula may turn into mist on occasion, though I&#39;m not certain - but how about shrinking down to a couple of inches high? The description of Lucy doing this is really weird, but she definitely retains her human form while doing so. She just... shrinks.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the weaknesses. Would I be off in suspecting that Abraham Van Helsing&#39;s fanatical obsession with the Host - including placing bits of it in every one of the forty-odd chests of soil they find - tends to be glossed over? How about the limits on when Dracula can use his powers? They are:<br><br>On home soil<br>On unhallowed ground<br>At night<br>At dawn, dusk, or noon, where these last about half an hour either side of the actual event<br><br>The rest of the time he&#39;s just a normal human (and thus spends most of it sleeping). I suspect this is usually trimmed down to &#39;night&#39;.<br><br>Oh, and the absolute best thing which I really doubt makes it in: if you nail a branch of wild rose to a vampire&#39;s coffin, they can&#39;t get in or out of it. It&#39;s quite charming, really. <sup>-<sup><br><br>hS</sup></sup></p>

            <p><s>Even if I had to read it for a high school class.</s><br><br>Yeah, the &quot;no shadow&quot; thing would require a lot of tedious, costly editing for a detail most audience members wouldn&#39;t notice throughout most of the movie.  It also would have been flat-out impossible for the earlier movie adaptations.  (<i>Nosferatu</i>, which was actually a bootleg <i>Dracula</i> ripoff that got its creators sued by Stoker&#39;s estate, made intentional use of the Count&#39;s shadow, which may have been a workaround to turn the inability to include that canon detail into an advantage.)<br><br>I haven&#39;t actually read &quot;Dracula&#39;s Guest,&quot; but based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula#.22Dracula.27s_Guest.22">Wikipedia&#39;s summary</a>, it does sound like Count Dracula gets a direct shot with a lightning bolt against another vampire.  (Said vampire also summons a snowstorm before being hit; maybe different vampires get different types of weather <s>magic</s>?)<br><br>I don&#39;t even remember Lucy shrinking.  I&#39;ll have to look for that scene in the novel once the sun comes up.<br><br>As to the restrictions . . . Huh.  Does that mean he can use powers on hallowed ground, provided that ground is earth from his home country?  What if a holy figure blessed the ground he was standing on from a distance, without Dracula noticing?  Would he suddenly get de-powered and not understand why?<br><br>And why do his powers come back at noon?  That&#39;s the moment of least shadow (typically), so it seems like he should be at his weakest.  Does he spin around in a circle, and be like, &quot;Well, I can&#39;t <i>see</i> the sun.  Therefore, it must not be up right now.  PAWERS OF DARKESS TEIM!&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some legendary origin for rose to have power over vampires, though I can&#39;t really imagine the connection.  If a vampire was in the process of getting in or out of their coffin, and someone hammered some rose in really suddenly, would they be stuck in the opening forever, half in and half out?  And I guess no one should write Selene/Rose of Sharon slash (slash?) in the next badfic game.<br><br>. . .<br><br>Tee hee.</p>

            <p>Yeah, somehow it had slipped past me; dunno why. Anyway, quotes:<br><br><i>&quot;He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature’s laws—why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come; though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset. These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest. We have seen it with our eyes.&quot;</i><br><br>This is part of AVH&#39;s ridiculously long speech on Dracula&#39;s powers and weaknesses. The &#39;unhallowed&#39; apparently means more &#39;unholy&#39; than simply &#39;not hallowed&#39; (which would be almost everywhere). I love the idea that vampires aren&#39;t <i>hurt</i> by sacred symbols - they simply go and wait somewhere else out of respect.<br><br>But yeah, AVH doesn&#39;t have a clue why Dracula&#39;s powers are limited by time of day. I reckon your &#39;spin in a circle&#39; theory has a lot of weight to it.<br><br><i>We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door.</i><br><br>Shrinking Lucy! I really have no idea what Stoker wanted us to see here, but it&#39;s clear that she&#39;s still in human form, not a mist or anything. My only deduction is that she shrinks down to doll sized.<br><br>And a couple of scenes later AVH encourages Arthur to necrophilia. Literature!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And I was not disappointed. In fact, I enjoyed it immensely. I wish we were reading this in English instead of <i>Animal Farm</i> for the third time. Oh, well...<br><br>And yeah, Lucy was shrinking:<br><br><i>&quot;He become so small- we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door.&quot;</i><br><br>I&#39;d say that means shrinking. It wasn&#39;t very clear in the graveyard, though.<br><br>But the &#39;spin in a circle&#39; idea is all I can think of as to why noon is one of the times he can shapeshift... But <i>&quot;noon, exact sunrise or sunset&quot;</i> seems like it could be potentially problematic. If he doesn&#39;t shift at that exact time, is he stuck until he can get back to his home area?<br><br>As for the holy symbols and Dracula <i>&quot;in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect.&quot;</i> Well, why then, does he require in hallowed ground? And if he retreats out of respect to holy symbols of Christianity, shouldn&#39;t he do the same for other religions? Besides, Dracula makes quite a fuss whenever he&#39;s near/touching a holy symbol.<br><br><i>&quot;When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demonic fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe it was ever there.&quot;</i><br><br>Insta-mood swing!<br><br> Why then is the sacred bullet so effective? You&#39;d think a regular bullet would work just as well. When Quincy shot at bat!Dracula, Dracula scampered pretty quickly, unless he&#39;s more vulnerable while shapeshifted?<br><br>I was squicked out by Arthur kissing vamp!Lucy after she died, too, but for a different reason; after he drove the steak through her, we got this lovely bit of description:<br><br><i>&quot;The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam.&quot;</i><br><br>Ew.<br><br>Speaking of Lucy, she was laid to rest in hallowed ground, but she didn&#39;t seem any the worse for it.</p>

            <p>Filmmakers probably worry about confusing people about what kind of monster movie they&#39;re watching. You&#39;ve got vampires on the one hand, werewolves on the other. If your vampires start turning into wolves, then what have you got? Plus, there&#39;s the &quot;vampires vs. werewolves&quot; thing, though I don&#39;t know when that got started.<br><br>Personal side-note: in my original fantasy setting, my idea for vampires is that functionally, they <i>are</i> wolves: humanoid, blood-eating, nocturnal pack hunters that go around picking off the sick and weak.

            <p>Thanks a lot, <i>Underworld</i>.  (I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s really where it started, but I think it was the first high-profile series to employ it.)<br><br>I guess the movie would have to really sell the theme of shapeshifting to make sure the audience understood the vampire could do a whole bunch of different forms.  Still, wolves are <i>cool</i>.  You&#39;d think that alone would warrant their inclusion in a Hollywood money grab.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve all caught up with the most recent pages so spoilers, naturally. <br><br><br>And then there were three left alive. Well, <i>six</i> if you count the live trolls. You can really feel this comic lurching towards the endgame, right? Heroes dropping like flies, the villains scoring a major victory, plans going awry, confusion and tragedy among the heroes&#39; ranks, and the whole session looking doomed. Everything looks like it&#39;s set up for John to retcon everything using Lord English&#39;s treasure... but isn&#39;t that too obvious a solution? After reading Homestuck you start to get paranoid and wonder what kind of curveballs Hussie can throw at you. <br><br>But I digress. Two humans left alive, no Time player, no Space player, Seers are down, general inability of the universe to keep down the clown (Gamzee is not dead, I can feel it in my bones), Dirk is MIA, nobody left to negotiate the release of the Genesis Frog with Echidna, Maid of Life is permadead, B2 Earth is stuck in Jade&#39;s sylladex with no hope of redeployment and worst of all the Mayor is still MIA.  We know that this mess will somehow straighten itself out-- universe C and the rise of Lord English guarantees it-- the big question is how. A two-man team (three if John and Roxy manage to find Dirk and to get him out of his funk) is probably not strong enough to bring down )(IC in a straight-up strife and there is still Lord English to take care of.<br><br><br>Fellow Homestuck readers, what are your theories for the endgame?<br><br><br>Personally, I think that there are going to be some last-minute additions to the team from Aradia and Sollux: the former as a replacement Time player to prevent further doomed timeline mishaps and the latter as a guide for this session that seems... <i>doomed</i> to fail. The Seer of Light is dead and we need another guide who specializes in Doom. Maybe Roxy can even conjure up a Quest Cocoon for Sollux to God Tier in. Just not sure how Sollux can be convinced to go back to the B2 session. Or how the two can actually travel there. Maybe this is a bad theory after all... hm. <br><br>As for Terezi... she might join in the final push. Her character arc is still not complete. I&#39;m guessing that there is still some more stuff that she needs to do while she&#39;s still alive but I just don&#39;t know how she&#39;s going to do it with the bazillion fractures she probably has and the zillion of litres of blood she lost.<br><br>We know John does some time-travelling (as seen when he stops himself from interfering with Dave and Jade&#39;s rooftop duel) so we can at least be sure that there <i>is</i> a plan afoot. <br><br>Also: Caliborn seems pitifully weak. Even if he managed to walk the path of the conqueror and God Tier, he was pretty much slapped around by plain ol&#39; John [S] GAME OVER. When we see him draw the stage on some blueprint, it became real elsewhere (in the Oubliette right next to Calliope). Could it be that Lord English is actually a come-to-life version of the Mary-Sue OC that Caliborn drew and subsequently possessed with his soul or something?<br><br></p>

            <p>God Tier auto-rez only works if a player is killed doing something <i>not</i> heroic or if the player in question doesn&#39;t deserve the death. For example:<br><br>A God Tier Mage of Void is exploring a cave for loot. He loses his footing next to a crevasse, bashes his head on a rock and falls 200 metres to his death. Was it heroic? Definitely not-- &quot;undignified&quot; might be a better term for the event. Was it a just death? Nope, not that either. Therefore auto-rez will kick in after a while and the Mage&#39;s crumpled remains will straighten themselves out, heal all wounds, and reanimate. The Mage will then stagger to the exit, feeling kinda freaked out that he just had a <s>near</s>death experience and berating himself over a easily preventable death.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Hussie has split up his heroes. On one side, we have John, Roxy, and maybe Terezi and Dirk left to deal with the mess left by )(IC. On the other, we have the dead who might try to work with Calliope and the other dead trolls to foil Lord Enligh&#39;s plans in the Furthest Ring. No, they may no see each other again, but they&#39;re still working together towards a common goal.<br><br>Dream bubbles will probably become the main theatre of events for the following acts.

            <p>I have nothing as coherent as actual theories, but here&#39;s what&#39;s going through my head:<br><br>1. Roxy has crazy-powerful Void abilities. Couldn&#39;t she theoretically utilize those to conjure up life where there is none, and bring people back from the dead?<br><br>2. Dirk. What is even up with that? Did he self-destruct? (I don&#39;t actually remember why things are all pixelated, except maybe it was something to do with Lord English maybe? This is why I will never come up with any theories.)<br><br>3. Do we know for sure that Lord English is Caliborn and not Jake English? I&#39;m not at all sure how that would work, but it&#39;s something Phobos and I have talked about a little bit.<br><br>4. Gamzee is definitely not out of the picture yet. He&#39;s the most important character in the comic, after all, and we saw him using a computer with the Felt, buying stuff with Calcoins. Also, Phobos has a theory that his chaotic Bard powers basically let him use everyone&#39;s abilities, so he can travel through time.<br><br>... That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.

            <p>1) That seems a little more like the domain of a Life player; Jane&#39;s abilities were supposed to cover this role but the Condesce had other plans. However! It appears that the Ring of Life is lost in the fires of LOFAF. This will allow the Ring of Void to be found. Such a powerful artefact in the hands of a Void player might be enough to allow Roxy to conjure up multiple copies of Life Rings... maybe?<br><br>2) It looks like he was simply obscured by the glitches much like someone would disappear under a wave at the sea. <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ACT6ACT6.php?s=6&amp;p=008176">The glitches are in fact caused by Caliborn.</a> He stuffed the Act 6 Act 6 cartridge full of special stardust and slotted it into the computer to advance the plot. Amusingly enough, this problem can be solved by blowing wind into the session, NES cartridge style. <s>John confirmed for MVP</s><br><br>3) Aranea <a href="http://i.imgur.com/nNfuJtt.png?1">confirmed</a> that Caliborn is Lord English. That being said, how Caliborn chose the name is something we&#39;ll have to wait and find out...<br><br>4) (And replying to Phobos) Gamzee is definitely not dead, I agree, but I don&#39;t think that he God Tiered. If I recall correctly, if either the dream self or the real self God Tiers, both personas are merged and respawn either on Skaia or at the location of the quest bed. If this is correct and Gamzee did God Tier, then we wouldn&#39;t have the double Gamzee shenanigans going on. </p>

            <p>3) Aranea definitely believes that Lord English and Caliborn are the same person.  However, despite what people may say about her, she doesn&#39;t actually know everything.<br><br>4) We know that dying on a quest bed on your own planet acts like that.  However, we&#39;ve seen the Prospit/Derse slabs react <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/ACT6ACT5ACT1x2COMBO.php?s=6&amp;p=007746">differently</a>.

            <p>...now that I think of it, the entire <i>Homestuck</i> universe seems like a great big game of Mornington Crescent except the objective of the game is for your team (ideally all God Tiers by the end of the game) to get a perfectly bred Genesis Frog to a properly prototyped Skaia before the Reckoning and to defeat the Black King so that Skaia is ready to accommodate the Speaker of the Vast Croak so that the victorious team can enter the universe contained inside the Frog and reside there as Gods.<br><br>Quite simple, really.<br></p>

I could only get through Acts 1-4 and about halfway through Act 5 before I gave up. I couldn&#39;t tell what the flippty flapjack was happening to save my life. <br><br>Maybe I&#39;ll give it another shot.</p>

            <p>I do! I think the difference all the time.<br><br>Er... hang on a minute, resetting.<br><br>I think the difference is that a lot of the fandom jargon for Homestuck is English words with Random Capitals. If you&#39;re confused by, say, Dior Eluchil leaving Doriath by way of Neldoreth to visit Gil-Galad on the Isle of Balar, you just write it off as &#39;high fantasy names blah&#39;. But words like &#39;Mage of Void&#39;... you can understand the <i>words</i>, they&#39;re just thrown together in ways that make no sense. Rather than floating through in a haze of blissful incomprehension, you stand there going &#39;what? But that- what? How? Huh?&#39;<br><br>Also, if Dior&#39;s heading to the Havens by way of Neldoreth, he&#39;s gotten seriously turned round.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Since a couple of these theories started with me, I can fill in the blanks.<br><br>3) The theory that Caliborn is not Lord English.  As has been pointed out already, Caliborn is a wimp.  Seriously.  Can you see that petulant little wuss turning into the scourge of the universe?  Also, Caliborn can&#39;t shut his mouth for more than three consecutive seconds, where Lord English has only really spoken on one occasion.  They just do not seem like the same guy, at all.<br><br>Now, I don&#39;t know if there actually is any connection to Jake, other than the name, and I don&#39;t have an actual theory for who might turn into LE (at least not one that I am happy with).<br><br>4) Dear, sweet Gamzee.  Not gonna lie, he is my favorite character.  Both of him.  That&#39;s right, I believe that there are two Gamzees running around.<br><br>How does that make any sense? Allow me to kick the wicked educating you.<br><br>It all comes down to this: Andrew Hussie says he is &quot;personally not aware of a single timeline in which this codpiece packing moron dies&quot;. I take that to mean that both Gamzee and his dream self are running around somewhere. This is backed up by the fact that no dream Gamzee shows up for the mini-strife.<br><br>&quot;But, Derrick,&quot; I can hear you saying. &quot;If Gamzee and his dream self are both alive, then where has his dream self been hiding?&quot; First off, how do you know my name?  Second, that is a good question. The answer is, of course, in plain sight.<br><br>Consider what we know:<br>-Gamzee appears one of two ways: In shadow, where he is angry and talks in the usual dark tones, or in God Tier regalia, where he is happy and never says anything but honk (the narrator does all his talking for him).<br>-We get conflicting accounts of who and what Gamzee is. The most notable is whether he is God Tier or not.<br>-Gamzee claims to be both of the Mirthful Messiahs<br>-Caliborn can&#39;t kill him, try as he might.<br>-He is a rascally clown. This is very important.<br><br>Gamzee is the dark one who talks. He is not a God Tier, and he is only one of the Mirthful Messiahs. The happy one who doesn&#39;t talk is Gamzee&#39;s dream self. He IS a God Tier (which is why Caliborn can&#39;t kill him) and is the other Mirthful Messiah.<br><br>How did this come to be? Well, that has an especially easy explanation. Gamzee is who he has always been (moreso since he ran out of slime pies), and his dream self became a God Tier when Bec Noir destroyed the Troll&#39;s Prospit. He was napping on his stone slab in the core of the moon, which allowed him to Ascend (they do love to nap in uncomfortable places).<br><br>So, where do we see the different Gamzees in action?<br><br>Dream Gamzee took a meteor trip through a Skaia portal to Earth and became the guardian of the Cherubs in their infancy, and a guide for Caliborn later.<br><br>Gamzee took a trip through time (using Aradia&#39;s crystal time tables) to guide the kids and prototype the Trolls. He met up with and talked to John, which is what John doesn&#39;t want to bring up with Terezi when they meet up on LOLAR.<br><br>So, there&#39;s that. Now let me get into the theory that Gamzee is every class and every aspect, by nature of being a Bard.<br><br>I can make a case for Gamzee acting as just about every class and every aspect at one point or another in the comic.<br><br>Thief of Void and Prince of Light- He stole Equius&#39;s blood and used it to redact the knowledge in Callie&#39;s book.<br><br>Knight of Heart and Witch of Mind - He has turned Karkat&#39;s feelings for Terezi against him, and has manipulated Terezi&#39;s decisions.<br><br>Heir of Time - He &quot;inherited&quot; the time-tables from Aradia to travel forward in time.<br><br>Page of Breath and Seer of Doom - He seems to know when things are going to go down, and he always knows what to do.<br><br>In the end, all of this will serve to bring the group together when they need it the most (Maid of Blood) to fulfill the Bard of Rage&#39;s inverse goal, to mend the path to victory (Sylph of Hope).<br><br>I could go on, but it is late and I am tired.  Maybe more later.<br><br>-Phobos, spending way too much time on theories since 1986</p>

            <p>Just thought I&#39;d drop this here before going to bed... I&#39;ve been actively looking for Suvian colors lately, and I think I may have found a new one. It&#39;s mentioned in this Hunger Games fic I&#39;ve found, <a href="http://www.quibblo.com/quiz/g2GGzju/Game-of-Chance-An-HG-fanfic?story_chapter=4">Game of Chance</a>. A character is mentioned as having &quot;blunde&quot; hair, so I think it&#39;ll probably be a relative of &quot;blunette&quot;, i.e. a sickening mix of blue and blonde. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll actively spork the fic in question, because despite its sporkable quality (seriously, just look at the whole thing), it&#39;s disappointingly incomplete with only four chapters so far. Still, I might add this color to the spectrum for future reference soon...<br><br>Additionally, I&#39;ve been thinking of starting an agent team in the Department of Mary Sues, just to give me something to do while waiting on my two collabs in Floaters (the one with Des is taking quite a while, actually - though if he has more important things to do, then he&#39;s more than welcome to take his time). I&#39;ve been meaning to experiment with an idea I&#39;ve had for a while. Basically, my DMS team is formed when an agent accidentally sends a Sue to the PPC HQ, and for safety purposes, she has to be bound by canon. So she&#39;s inherently Suvian but has to fight alongside the agent who initially caught her, like a bound demon of sorts. The Sue&#39;s captor will likely have some involvement to Rashida&#39;s history as well, though I won&#39;t spoil that until after I start work on the bios tomorrow.<br><br>Thoughts on both topics are appreciated as usual! <sup>_^</sup></p>

            <p>So, I had some free time to just relax for once, and I (for some reason) decided to binge through the Rose Potter Septology again. I have read it through a few times, and it got me thinking critically about it.<br><br>Yeah, it is pretty bad. But as I may have mentioned at some point in a different thread, it does have some potential, which, unfortunately, remains untapped. There are some decisions in  the story that make no sense, like one point in the second story where the Mary Sue, the titular Rose Potter, teleports into Hogwarts (which, for those who don&#39;t know, is supposed to be impossible) only to deliver a letter and then teleport back to the same place she was just stuck at, despite the fact that she was trying to get to Hogwarts in the first place. And then there is an annoying and pointless pro-naturist message that permeates throughout the whole series. But then there are several plot points that are tantalizing, such as a hinted bitter enmity between the sect of Druids the author invented and a group that never makes it into the story, the Necromancers. This presents an incredible opportunity for someone who wants to build some new aspects to the Harry Potter universe, and it never gets used! And finally, there is the excessive underage sex, underage even for the wizarding world, which allows people to come of age when they are seventeen. <br><br>For those who have read the Rose Potter series themselves, I have this to ask you. In a hypothetical situation, could this series be fixed so that it is actually good? If so, how would you suggest it be improved?<br><br>Why am I asking? I&#39;m going to challenge myself to rewrite this series (maybe, just maybe, with some aspects of my own), and I&#39;m going to eventually submit it as an &quot;alternative work&quot; alongside my own series, Imaginations Collide, which, yes, is still in development. (Note: I might not actually do anything with this rewrite of Rose Potter, but I would like to at least try my hand at it as an exercise of my own skill. You know, to help me improve myself even more than College can help me with.)</p>

            <p>Full disclosure: while I have read a fairly in-depth sporking of it, I have avoided the original. What I saw was enough to make me ill as it is.<br><br>Do I think that a female Potter could be well-written? Absolutely, although none I&#39;ve ever seen manage to (see: Holly Potter the woobie). But one of the problems with the Rose Potter series was, I believe, exactly those plot points you find tantalizing. I found they absolutely take focus away from the actual world of Harry Potter by shifting focus to things which make no sense and which in fact often <i>supplant</i> the canon precisely as Sues do (i.e., Let Me Take A False Name As An All-Powerful Druidess So I Can Make The Wizengamut Cower Before Me, Dumbledore being impressed by this, etc.)<br><br>The problem with female!Potter stories is that it is almost impossible to do without regurgitating so much of canon that it could get quite boring. I do think it could be done well, and even do so in ways that explore things not shown in canon, like what it means to be a witch in that universe when, while there is not as much overt sexism as Rose Potter claims, there is no reason for it not to parallel the real world to some degree. Frankly there are absolutely gender issues which could be explored--it&#39;s even called the Wizarding World, what about the witches?--although if you are male, as your handle suggests, and you want to handle this, please get a woman (and even potentially a British woman as cultures may vary) to consult with on this. The other thing which it could do is explore the little-explored aspects of canon. Harry Potter is known to have plenty of holes, undeveloped parts, and any number of dimensions to explore without adding entire magic systems to an already dubiously developed one. For instance: explore international relations in the Wizarding World more. There might even be ways to work in some of what you liked out of Rose Potter without inventing things that have no place in the canon and which frankly upstage it.<br><br>Adding Druids and Necromancers and the like honestly feels to me like adding Uncanonical Cities With Non-Elvish Customs which claim to be Elvish or Users of Previously Unknown Magic Type to Arda, or random Generic Monasteries to canons that have none and no reason for them, and that almost never ends well. My policy is that in the hands of a sufficiently talented writer, there is almost no Bad Idea (TM) which cannot be deftly handled. Doing so simply takes care, lots of beta-reading, and consideration for the worldbuilding. When you&#39;re playing in someone else&#39;s sandbox, respecting that still matters. <br><br>For some fics, adding whole things like that could easily work if there are outright unexplored areas of the map, of the magic, etc. One of my favorite canons I default to absolutely has this, because of the directions canon can grow, particularly post-plot. Harry Potter doesn&#39;t seem to have that much unexplored, at least not in the immediate region of Britain. Working new groups in from Africa, Mesoamerica, Oceania, India, or other places we just don&#39;t know much about could do this. Locally, however, things are fairly complete.<br><br>If you think it&#39;s so incomplete that you need to add entire things with your own rules and history and interactions, honestly? Try making an original world instead. Develop it into something no one&#39;s seen before, and make it fantastic. Personally, I would rather see the results of that than Harry Potter turned into something it isn&#39;t.</p>

            <p>So, it theoretically can be done. Okay.<br><br>Hm. Take focus away from canon... Good point. Could redo that, though...<br><br>Yeah, I remember that part. It actually made me side with Fudge and Umbridge! Fudge and UMBRIDGE!!! We&#39;re supposed to dislike them (or hate them, depending on which you prefer). If Rose Potter is going to work as a character, those actions need to have negative consequences and/or people need to raise aggressive objections. Mary Sues don&#39;t get that, so the Sue needs to eliminated somehow. Preferably in a creative, ironic way... Okay, I&#39;m going to stop before I go into a full blown rant.<br><br>Yeah, it&#39;s a tradeoff that people tend to mess up. At least My Immortal had Harry Potter&#39;s gender correct (if not his sexual orientation).<br><br>I know someone in the UK I could get in touch with. She recently had a rant on Facebook about some scandal in Parliament over budget funds disappearing, or something.<br><br>I understand that completely. As this is, however, it&#39;s not much more than an exercise in the writing process so that I can see how well I could make a disaster like Rose Potter work. I could make an entirely different world- in fact, you have given me some ideas that I could use for my own stories in the Pit. It would be interesting to see how Wizards live in the United States, for example.<br><br>(If I&#39;m not careful, I&#39;ll have too much writing to get done in the span of a few years. Not that I&#39;m complaining, but that&#39;s a lot of writing I&#39;m giving myself.)</p>

            <p>I really am trying to be constructive, and sometimes that means directness. I spent a lot of time thinking about your opening of, ‘So, technically it can be done.’ After a lot of consultation and consideration I formulated my actual response based on that, because I do not want my name on a belief I don’t hold.<br><br>To answer your original question:<br><br>Do I think that a genderbent!Harry could be written well, if proper care were taken? Absolutely.<br><br>Do I think that Rose Potter can be rewritten into something good?<br><br>Frankly, no.<br><br>Here’s why:<br>- As I’ve said before, the things you mentioned enjoying have nothing whatsoever to do with Harry Potter canon. This would, I reluctantly admit, not be an inherently incorrect thing in and of itself. However, those changes weren’t actually made to explore and broaden the world, they were made to make Rose more Super Speshul, to allow the nekkid girls, or to create teh sexytiemz. As far as I can tell, the world of Rose Potter shares little more than window dressing with the world J.K. Rowling built, especially as all the characters are wildly OOC. It isn’t fanfiction. It’s original ideas under the veneer of fanfiction. If those original ideas were what you liked, write original fic and wow me with it.<br><br>- I don’t think it can be rewritten and remain a Harry Potter fanfic at all. The sporking—more MSTing, as I seem to remember being subjected to those parts of the series which weren’t copy-and-pasted straight from canon--I read indicated that Halcyon left off rather suddenly after chapter 7 of Rose Potter Year 6. More, while the reason for stopping is somewhat debatable, it looks like it’s either a simple a shipping rage-quit or possibly to do with the irreconcilable differences with canon established by <i>Deathly Hallows</i>. Even leaving aside the many, many ways the fic broke canon rules before and bizarre mix of destruction of and yet slavish adherence to canon plots beyond all sense of logic, that is a clear indication the concept has nothing to do with Harry Potter.<br><br>- Halcyon is also known for having plagiarized from other fanfic and lifted things straight out of games he/she liked in a rather blatant manner, to say nothing of the early stages being almost word-for-word canon until it diverges so wildly it isn’t even recognizable anymore.<br><br>- Rose Potter is one of the most overpowered God-Mod Sues widely remembered on the internet, and does so in ways that blatantly flaunt canon. For instance, she is able to cast Unforgivable Curses by somehow powering them with <i>~love~</i>--which is in direct contradiction with canon and frankly undermines the emotional impact on the reader. This is to say nothing of the ninja business or any number of other problems.<br><br>- My main reason, though, for believing that it cannot actually be salvaged: What do you get if you strip away the inconsistencies with canon, if you excise all the horrifying underage nudity and sex, if you erase the plagiarism, if you make it all fit logically, if you somehow make the additions plausible, if you remove all the grossly God-Modding extra powers? What are you even left with?<br><br>Unfortunately for all concerned, you’re left with Rose Potter.<br><br>Rose Potter is a horrible, horrible person who starts murdering people at the tender age of <i>eleven</i>. She carves words into Ron’s forehead after flinging him around the room. She actively learns dark magic, she is eager for genocide—in short, she is a terrible person who is more akin to Voldemort than Harry Potter.<br><br>So then what happens if you take that personality away as the last vestige of Halcyon’s screw-up?<br><br>You get… well, genderbent!Harry Potter.<br><br>In conclusion: you can write genderbent!Harry Potter. You can try to add the original elements and keep anything recognizable as Harry Potter&#39;s world. You can write unexplored parts of the Harry Potter world—go ahead, explore the United States, but then it’s not Rose Potter anymore. You can original fiction with druids, necromancy, and magical schools.<br><br>Girl Who Lived itself, though? No. No, I don’t believe it’s salvageable, and I don’t know why anyone would try.</p>

            <p>I had a review. It was at least somewhat lengthy, discussed which points I loved and why (particularly handling the issue of Selene&#39;s dietary needs and appreciation of good food), pithy remarks and astute observations.<br><br>And then Firefox crashed and ate it.<br><br>I am too tired to re-type it. So we&#39;ll just leave it as &quot;I really loved how you handled the characters of the PPC Agents, as always I love the constructive criticism at the end, the fic was WTF, and it was well-handled; thanks for a great read.&quot;<br><br>Also, nit-pick: &quot;Selene turned in the stool...&quot;<br>Should that be <i>on</i> the stool?

            <p>Here&#39;s one I was thinking of taking at one point, but decided I won&#39;t:<br><br>Fic: &quot;<a href="http://www.quotev.com/story/3113250/Another-Hobbit-Story/1/">ᴛʜᴏʀɪɴ&#39;s ʟɪᴛᴛʟᴇ ᴘʀɪɴᴄᴇss/ᴀ ᴋɪʟɪ sᴛᴏʀʏ</a>&quot;<br>Continuum: <i>The Hobbit</i><br>Description: A random girl claiming to be a Ranger and an Animorph joins the Quest for Erebor, makes Thorin a misogynist, flirts with Kili, steals lines, makes out with Kili, and otherwise contributes very little to the plot.<br>Type of Badfic: Numerology-Wrecking Suefic<br><br>Plot Holes: She joins Thorin&#39;s company; she&#39;s somehow &quot;the last Animorph&quot; (without actually tying the story to the <i>Animorphs</i> series in any real way, or I&#39;d be all over it); apparently Animorphs are considered monsters, according to her bio and Radagast; she&#39;s somehow a Ranger and Thorin&#39;s adopted daughter; apparently she&#39;s also a Shadowhunter/Dragon Warrior/Shadow Runner, the last of which at least is apparently a racial enemy of the Dwarves; and the story has annoying formatting and POV shifts.<br><br>Offenses Against Canon: Her name is silly, her <i>other</i> name is silly, and her horse&#39;s name is silly; most of the fic is a word-for-word retelling of the movie; she can blend in with shadows and turn into animals; she makes Thorin question her as a fighter because she&#39;s a woman, then handily beats him; she&#39;s Thorin&#39;s adopted daughter; she has a portentous dragon-shaped birthmark; and she gets a speshul sword with a silly name from the Trolls&#39; cave.<br><br>... I&#39;m not actually sure what I should call a plothole and what I should call an offense against canon. I tried.<br><br>I don&#39;t know the wordcount, since it&#39;s on Quotev, but the good news is that you can completely ignore the large, obnoxious stretches that simply recap the film. {X P And hey, maybe Kaitlyn will finally get her wish to be a Hobbit.<br><br>Happy sporking!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I have a little plotbunny involving Alice and that Valinorian horse I found in <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/ryntirhawkey/story05.html">one of Adagio&#39;s missions</a>, but he really does need a better name than &quot;Delroch.&quot; Could you help me figure something out? Probably Quenya, since he&#39;s from Valinor. He&#39;s supposed to be the son of Nahar&#39;s sister, so I was thinking something along the lines of &quot;proud blood.&quot; He&#39;s white, if that suggests anything that won&#39;t remind us of Snowmane.<br><br>Failing that, I could look for another literary reference a la Alice... Charles, maybe, that being Lewis Carroll&#39;s actual first name... which would probably lead to all sorts of terrible &quot;Charlie the Unicorn&quot; jokes. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be a Q. word for &#39;pride&#39;, but &#39;holy&#39; is another matter. And... well, Nahar is almost certainly a Maia in his own right, not a horse at all - he creates <i>mountains</i> when he jumps. That means his sister is presumably a Maia as well - in the same sense that Manwe and Melkor are brothers - so Horse here is in the same situation as Luthien the Nightingale. Only, uh, for horses.<br><br>So... how about &#39;Aireyбr&#39;? It means &#39;Holy blood&#39; (insert <i>Da Vinci Code</i> reference here), using an older word for &#39;blood&#39;, as might be expected for the nephew of Nahar. Or there&#39;s &#39;Aineyбr&#39;, directly adopting the word &#39;Ainu&#39;. It&#39;s a bit unsubtle, but I see he was owned by Maglor; that Feanorian arrogance rubs off, y&#39;know.<br><br>Wandering further afield, there&#39;s a lovely word &#39;Calambar&#39;, which literally means &#39;light-fated&#39;, but is interpreted &#39;blessed&#39;. You could also have something like &#39;Mбnayбr&#39;, &#39;blessed blood&#39;, or &#39;Mбnalossл&#39; for &#39;blessed snow-white&#39;. Or, for any of the &#39;-yбr&#39; names, you can use &#39;-sercл&#39; instead; it&#39;s a more modern &#39;blood&#39; word. &#39;Mбnasercл&#39; is probably the neatest of those.<br><br>Anything? I can keep wandering the name lists if you want something else. Nahar&#39;s own name is no help - it&#39;s apparently onomatapoea in Valarin.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It is a curious fact of the history of Middle-earth that Maglor Feanorion was the premier horse-master of Beleriand. Between the hardy native breeds and the powerful Valinorean race - the ultimate ancestors of the <i>mearas</i> - there was no contest, for even setting aside the effect of the Two Trees, Valinor was a land of wide plains, while Beleriand was heavily forested.<br><br>But the horses of Aman never crossed the Grinding Ice; the only Valinorean steeds to reach Middle-earth were those carried by Feanor&#39;s host in his ships. Given the tense relations between House Feanor and the rest of Beleriand, it is clear that the Feanorian horses would have remained just that.<br><br>But Maedhros lived on a mountain; Caranthir, Celegorm, and Curifin guarded hilly regions and mountain passes; Amrod and Amras hunted in the ancient forest. Of Feanor&#39;s seven sons, only Maglor lived in horse country - in fact, in the greatest horse county in Middle-earth. For Maglor&#39;s Gap was the eastern gateway between forested Beleriand, and Ard-galen - the massive plain between Dorthonion and Thangorodrim. Until the Sudden Flame, it was a sea of grass - and of Noldorin warriors, and of their horses.<br><br>So Maglor would have raised the greatest horses in Middle-earth; tall and proud, fleet of foot, heirs to the horses of Valinor, and even to Nahar himself. And they would have been long-lived - the one Valinorean animal we know the lifespan of is Huan, and he lived at least 460 years. Maglor would have had a lot of time to get to know his charges.<br><br>So what would he have named them? Given Maglor&#39;s somewhat tense relationship with his family, the typical Feanorian names would have been out. But the first thing everyone knows about Maglor is that he was a harper - and we all betray ourselves in the metaphors we use. Maglor would have seen his horses as <i>allegro</i>, as <i>adagio</i>, as <i>prestissimo</i>, their personalities likening themselves to music.<br><br>We do not have a Quenya (for Maglor of House Feanor would certainly have used Quenya) musical vocabulary comparable to our Italian one. But different instruments are suited to different tempos and styles of music, and so a slow horse might become <i>Nainiл</i>, &#39;Lament&#39;, and a frisky, ever-juvenile steed might be <i>Nyellл</i>, &#39;Bell&#39;. A steady walker could be known as <i>Lairл</i>, &#39;Poem&#39;, and one who could hold a rhythmic trot as <i>Lнrл</i>, &#39;Song&#39;.<br><br>And Maglor&#39;s personal mount? We each seek out personalities like to our own - and so what else could his horse be known as but <i>Nandaro</i> - &#39;Harper&#39;?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The trouble is finding a suitably terrible crossover with continua I know—and if I had my druthers, I&#39;d want it to really mess with Ax or Elfangor or maybe Aldrea for maximum effect. Unfortunately, most of the ones I&#39;ve looked at are either one-shots/single chapters or epics on the order of tens of thousands of words, and/or just mediocre-boring rather than making my fingers twitch for the sporks.<br><br>I&#39;ve got my eye on this little gem, though: &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8050775/1/The-54th-Hunger-Games">The 54th Hunger Games</a>.&quot; As you might&#39;ve guessed, it&#39;s a <i>Hunger Games</i> crossover. The Animorphs live in various districts in Panem for some reason, and of course they all get reaped. The story spends most of its time on the reapings and the fancy dresses the female characters wear. It&#39;s insipid, OOC, has barely anything tying it to <i>Animorphs</i> besides the characters with their names, and overall just dumb. And Ax is in it, even if he is human. I might go for it if nothing better falls into my lap before I&#39;m ready to start a new DIC mission.<br><br>On the bright side, I also found an <i>Animorphs</i> x <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i> fic that&#39;s fairly good: &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10356837/1/Invasion-of-Pern">Invasion of Pern</a>.&quot; It&#39;s all OCs, it&#39;s well-written, and above all it&#39;s <i>plausible</i>. <sup>_<sup><br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

            <p>(Hi, you)<br><br>O&#39;course, much like <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/Ashes.html">the crew of the <i>USS Eminence</i></a>, their use of the term &#39;Mary-Sue&#39; doesn&#39;t match with the PPC&#39;s: they&#39;re apparently using it to designate any OC. I guess it could be a protest against the label being slapped on characters willy-nilly - at the least, it&#39;s a protest against all OCs being dismissed out of hand - so there&#39;s that.<br><br>The most interesting idea in there is the notion that some canons need fixing. They talk about plotholes being filled by fanfic, which I think we can all get behind - but they also talk about aspects of canon which are &#39;unfair&#39;:<br><br><i>See this machine hood? Yeah, in my native Fabric, it&#39;s the only way to keep sane and safe from these marauding evil spirits that grant me completely necessary powers; I don&#39;t think any native-born of that fabric would mind if I made said power a little safer for everyone.</i><br><br>And that&#39;s something the PPC would <i>not</i> accept (the organisation, not the community); a canon is inviolate, regardless of how bad it is. And while I might be personally inclined to agree with the idea of &#39;fixing&#39; dodgy canons - it&#39;s impossible to actually alter the original, so the PPC&#39;s viewpoint makes more sense. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>(Hi, you)<br><br>I thought it was interesting how much this forum&#39;s definition of Mary Sue differed from ours, despite the shared feeling of &#39;Mary Sues make fanfiction terrible!&#39; I also thought it was interesting just how much the attitude towards what to do with them differed.<br><br>Then again, this is also a gaming forum; the point of it isn&#39;t nearly the PPC&#39;s of commentary and analysis and general &#39;Please, this is how you do it right.&#39; It&#39;s of how to make an entertaining tabletop game. I kind of wonder what it is about the different definition and goal that makes it seem like a more entertaining premise than, you know, Kill The Sue as a campaign, Stop The Sue Distorting Reality, etc.<br><br>And yes. Alas that we cannot actually fix dodgy and/or eternally inconsistent canons, but Canon is Canon.<br><br>Anyway, I figured it was something we could all enjoy reading and thinking about, as &#39;definition of a Mary Sue&#39; has been a discussion before and I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s a good thing to know how others define it in case someone accidentally ends up discussing it with one of them. Mutual understanding of terminology is important. (Alas for a lack of consistency.)</p>

            <p>I just. Very strongly dislike Moffat. I think Capaldi is an excellent choice for the Doctor, but I just can&#39;t get into the show any more at all. Sigh. <br>In my opinion, Moffat&#39;s writing with Smith in season 6 was pretty decent! But since then it&#39;s been spiraling downhill out of control. So I would say no, it&#39;s not much better. <br>Each to their own, though; I would be lying if I said that some interesting ideas weren&#39;t coming up, so I&#39;d say definitely give it a shot.

            <p>... but in general, Series 8 has been good.<br><br>(I guess the below might be considered spoilers? I guess. Read at your own peril. The only real spoilers are regarding Episode 7, <i>Kill the Moon</i>, which frankly, you shouldn&#39;t watch anyway)<br><br>The exceptions, unfortunately, were <i>very</i> exceptions. Regrettably, episodes 2 (<i>Into the Dalek</i>) and 3 (<i>Robot of Sherwood</i>) were a bit pants; 2 violated large amounts of logic, and 3 was... uh... well, it depicted the Doctor as nearly totally useless in order to let Clara do everything. So there&#39;s that. Episode 7 (<i>Kill the Moon</i>) is apparently quite a good story for Clara - provided you can ignore the complete lack of science taking place in what should be a highly scientific story. Gravity on the surface of a spherical object disappears because the contents of the object move, and single-celled organisms have segmented legs, is what I&#39;m saying. Also, the uplifting ending is literally only uplifting for Clara, despite the Doctor ignoring what actually happened and saying it&#39;s about humanity as a whole. (I didn&#39;t like that episode)<br><br>But the rest of the series, I really enjoyed. Episode 4 (<i>Listen</i>) is very much in the spirit of <i>Blink</i>, and is frankly brilliant. I also particularly enjoyed 5 (<i>Time Heist</i>) and 8 (<i>Mummy on the Orient Express</i>).<br><br>The one thing we&#39;ve had a hard time pinning down is who, exactly, Twelve is supposed to be - what sort of Doctor. He&#39;s actually quite ruthless, brushing up against &#39;the end justifies the means&#39;. They&#39;re also playing an &#39;overbearing father&#39; angle with him and Clara (bumping up against her &#39;teacher&#39; role, which does make for some good moments), which will probably drop away if and when we get a new companion. Despite the very Three costume, he reminds me rather a lot of One...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Also, I fully echo the sentiments both about Series 8 and about absolutely not watching &quot;Kill the Moon,&quot; which was as far as I am concerned absolutely atrocious.<br><br>The thing I am finding fascinating about this series is that while the writing is being uneven (not exactly something new, with this show), the <i>acting</i> is often rescuing it. Capaldi has, in my opinion, been doing an absolutely astonishing job, particularly in drawing from so many Doctors for inspiration. Also, if he&#39;s like One, it&#39;s probably because he&#39;s almost guaranteed to be the last actor playing the Doctor who actually watched Hartnell play him back in the day; I have no doubt it&#39;s deliberate. Also, a friend of mine noted that when he talks to himself, sometimes his mannerisms slip into Four&#39;s, probably deliberately.<br><br>All of which is to say despite the writing fails in the most recent episode--which there were, I will not spoil but there were a few moments that had me twitching--it&#39;s the acting that has been really making this season well worth it.<br><br>My two-cents.</p>

            <p>There were some episodes that were excellent in terms of writing, and others that just made my entire family do nothing but point out the plotholes. <br><br>I would say yes, because in the event the writing gets better, you&#39;ll not have several seasons to watch in order to get caught up. <br><br>Besides, Moffat (my dad and I call him the Troll and shall be referred to as such fom here on out) wrote the most recent episode and I personally thought it was fantastic.

            <p>I&#39;ve always been a proponent of the idea that any story-type can be written well. The last one that came up was Tenth Walkers in LotR, and I spent a little while <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9998481/1/Tenth-Walkers">proving that one</a>.<br><br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done OC/canon (well, technically I have, since Dafydd == Maglor, but that&#39;s rather different), but I <i>have</i> written a romance between two unconnected canon characters, which hits many of the same points: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10368490/1/The-Horn-and-the-Harp">The Horn and the Harp</a>.<br><br>But yeah, it basically comes down to the same questions as any other story. Is the canon in-character? Is the OC believable? Does the plot make sense in light of both the setting and the characters? Then you have a workable story. (&#39;Good&#39;, obviously, requires things like spelling and nice writing, as well, but at the least this wouldn&#39;t be <i>bad</i>).<br><br>Of course, some characters are more difficult to pair off than others. Finding a girlfriend for Captain Kirk shouldn&#39;t be hard, though I wouldn&#39;t expect it to last long. Breaking up Anakin and Padme would be a lot harder, because Ani is an obsessive lunatic. You could probably get Padme to leave <i>him</i> - she was basically doing so when he killed her, so shuffle events around, make his darkness more obvious, and you could pull it off - but that would likely just flip him into full-on Vader mode early, making a relationship with an OC unlikely.<br><br>(&quot;But you said any story-&quot; Yes, and I&#39;ll stand by that. If challenged, I&#39;d go with either killing Padme, or having her take a stand against the Jedi for political reasons. The former, if done early enough, would give Ani time to back down from the Dark Side, briefly; the latter could drive a wedge between them, with him taking her actions as a personal insult. Since this would be pre-Vader, he wouldn&#39;t actually strangle her, so it could work)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Tenth Walker thing was actually one that I&#39;ve been curious about!  I&#39;ll have to look in the archives to find that discussion and read it when I get a chance.  <br><br>We&#39;ve all seen horrible, 10th Walker Suefics.  On the other hand, I&#39;ve seen 10th Walker fics that I thought were really good, with well-written OC&#39;s (who were believable as not only people but a part of Tolkien&#39;s world, who weren&#39;t super powerful, who definitely understood the temptation of the One Ring) and canon characters that weren&#39;t OOC. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s just that most of these days, it&#39;s getting harder and harder to find fanfic authors that are willing to take the effort to actually make the story interesting and believeable. Nowadays, 80% of OCxCanon or ships of characters that had never met are written like the author recruited a drunk monkey banging on a keyboard while looking at a harlequin romance novel. <br><br>You have no idea how many Suethors I&#39;ve seen that just assume that since they paired their Sue up with a canon character that all other ships involving that canon are inferior to their amazing, spectacular, beautiful (ly gross) pairing.</p>

            <p>Yes, I have read a few OCxCannon fics that were believeable and well-written. Heck, I&#39;m writing one myself. However, there is definently a certain stigma with such fanfictions, usually because OC shipfics make up a large part of (if not the majority of) Suefics.</p>

            <p>There are a bunch of people who are awesome with this one story I&#39;m writing, and they encourage me and give me ideas. Specifically, an amazing guy by the name of Golden Keyblade who freaks out with me about Doctor Who.<br>But, I&#39;d have to say, the best review I&#39;ve gotten so far was from someone who told me that they had bought a dinosaur that looked like the one in my fic and named it Charles, in honor of my writing. <br>I feel kinda guilty now that Charles the Calvinosaur is going to be evil in later chapters... but, yeah.

            <p>Because the persona fanfic I mentioned is, in fact, the only writing project that no one has proclaimed to be stupid yet (Well, there was stargazer, but my dad&#39;s cousin was at least being civil about the criticism, and those were only parts of it), likely because it&#39;s interesting and despite being my first time writing a goodfic (the last one before that was a badfic that I took down. that one was stupid, even for me), My beta thinks it&#39;s pretty interesting.<br><br>I&#39;m very proud of this because it is the only writing Iv&#39;e ever done that has never angered me.

            <p>Don&#39;t mind me, just going to dump my thoughts here.<br><br>Okay. So. First of all: he escaped. Son of a gun, he managed to escape. It just goes to show that if you don&#39;t completely, absolutely, irreversibly <i>destroy</i> a character then they are not dead. Even then, they might pop up again: consider Rory Williams and the Time Fissure. Actually, death has no meaning in <i>Doctor Who</i>. Forget I said anything.<br><br>Secondly, how did he escape? We&#39;re all pretty sure that the Master was on Gallifrey at the Moment of salvation: otherwise Rassilon would still be in control of the High Council and the universe would be dead because of the Ultimate Sanction. This means that the Master definitely killed Rassilon (and maybe a chunk of the council for good measure) before he was neutralized by guards or whatever. (Which would probably prompt the line said by the General during the <i>Day of the Doctor</i>: &quot;To hell with the High Council, their plans have already failed!&quot;) He (now she)  must&#39;ve regenerated during that time and escaped thereafter-- breaking out of the parallel pocket universe Gallifrey is sealed in and into the Doctor&#39;s universe (and maybe stealing some tech too, for good measure-- Missy couldn&#39;t have just built the Nethersphere-Matrix out of normal things... or could she?). <br><br>Thirdly: from the trailers, we know that UNIT get involved. The Doctor manages to escape Missy because he&#39;s seen in a hangar with UNIT loading his TARDIS in a plane. Cybermen are all over the place and can now fly Iron Man style with <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005850">jet boots</a>. I wonder how this will pan out... oh, who am I kidding. UNIT will get curbstomped. H&amp;K G36 are pretty rubbish when even futuristic laser weapons have a hard time slowing down Cybermen.<br><br><b>Lastly and most importantly</b>: if Master-now-Missy broke out, she must know the way back. <br><br>Gallifrey might be within reach.<br></p>

            <p>You know how the regeneration happened in an instant, like snap?

            <p>Two of &#39;em.<br><br>1/ This is <i>not</i> the Master as last seen taking down Rassilon. That was a half-alive, resurrected-from-genes-on-Lucy&#39;s-lips, undead monster version. The <i>real</i> Master - the one the Doctor &#39;left... for dead&#39; (as mentioned in the episode) - was last seen on the <i>Valiant</i>. So Missy knows nothing about Gallifrey, Rassilon, or any of that. As far as she knows, the Doctor last met her &#39;refusing to regenerate&#39; (yeah, like we ever believed <i>that</i>) after succeeding in conquering the Earth and being beaten by Jesus!Ten.<br><br>Another point in support of this: there&#39;s a statement in the wildly uncanonical Doctor Who: Unbound AUs that a Time Lord will regenerate into the opposite sex if they commit suicide.

She&#39;s actually... yes, you guessed it, the same person every female character has been suspected of being since 2005... the Rani! After all, she&#39;s a scientist, while the Master definitely is not. And she knows of the Doctor&#39;s rivalry with the Master, which she would absolutely make use of. And, perhaps most significantly: Steven Moffat has specifically denied that he has any plans to bring back the Rani. <sup>-<sup><br><br>Oh,</sup></sup> and one for luck (not Missy related):<br><br>3/ That face reflected in Pink&#39;s iPad in the last shot... we&#39;re <i>supposed</i> to think that&#39;s The Boy, I&#39;m sure, but to me, it looked a lot like Lalla Ward...

When I first saw the word &#39;Nethersphere&#39; my first thought was &#39;oooh yes, this is E-Space&#39;. Not true, obviously, but when Missy stated the whole bit about Time Lady insistent terminology, I literally screamed out &quot;<i>Romana went evil regenerated escaped from Gallifrey in a Void Ship and thinks she&#39;s the Doctor&#39;s boyfriend!!</i>&quot; which was followed by a massive sigh when I found out who she really was.<br>Of course Missy could be lying.

            <p>Sudden thought that can be best explained with a shortfic. <p>Danny&#39;s trembling finger hovered over the &#39;Delete&#39;  button. It was time, he decided. Time to just go. He was dead, anyway, and Clara had practically admitted she wasn&#39;t coing for him. His finger stabbed down.<br>A slender hand caught his arm, roughly twisting it away. The same hand grabbed the iPad, and held it up. The hand belonged to a woman that looked like she was in her twenties. She had long, shoulder-length brown hair that had a halo of friz about it and a scattering of freckles about her face. She was dressed in a simple grey dress and crimson combat boots. Danny stared at her sudden arrival. <br>&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; she told him, still examining the iPad with a distinct air of distrust. &quot;But, trust me, you really do not want to do that.&quot;<br> Danny gaped for a moment or two beore finding his voice. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I was about to commit suicide here. I&#39;d prefer it if you didn&#39;t get in the way! Who are you, anyway?&quot;<br>She glared at him with a look he had only seen frm the Doctor before. &quot;Like I said, you do not want to do that. You can call me Fred, Mr Pink. And, right now, we need to save Clara Oswald from never existing.&quot;<br>She raised her eyebrows, tucking the iPad under her arm. &quot;Are you with me or not?&quot;<br>He made up his mind. &quot;I&#39;mwith you.. Miss Fred.&quot;<br>She winced. &quot;Just Fred, please. The Miss makes it sound odd.&quot;</p></p>

            <p>It was in the eleventh Doctor&#39;s episode <i>The Doctor&#39;s Wife</i>, when the Doctor mentioned an old friend who&#39;d been both a man and a woman.

            <p>I do believe you are the only person I know who could accidentally do NaNo.<br><br>...also, that looks <i>awesome</i>. It&#39;s reminiscent of the Silm, though that may partly be just the nature of creation myths. But I find the concept intriguing! Going into the pre-contact stage of American Indian lifestyles and myths, it&#39;s become strikingly apparent that significant portions of the oral tradition are either historical accounts or, perhaps even more fascinating, metaphorical ways of talking about scientific knowledge. Which is a really interesting way of looking at the universe!</p>

            <p>In the past, I&#39;ve always been too busy with work and school to participate.

Everything I&#39;ve written in the past was fanfiction I scribbled in notebooks back in high school that I never published anywhere (not even in the Pit that is ff.net, and thank deity-of-choice-here because looking back it was horrible).  I definitely don&#39;t want to get in over my head, so I&#39;ll probably start smaller and work my way up from there. <br><br>Good luck to everyone who is writing though!  You can do it!  Wooo~ </p>

            <p>Yep, you guessed it, Iv&#39;e started to work on starhunter again. For those of you who don&#39;t know, starhunter is a game Idea that I&#39;ve been working on for.... about half a year now. Here are some basic details:<br><br>GENRE: first-person roleplay-shooter, but it contains massive amounts of dialogue and a relationship mechanic (similar to persona&#39;s social links).<br><br>SETTING: an alternate dimension that exists in the minds of those &quot;Taken&quot; to it (technologically, the shared mind-world is highly reminiscent of Halo, Starship troopers, and Killzone.)<br><br>TARGET AUDIENCE: 10-14, but starhunter&#39;s emphasis on world-building, deep customization, fleshed-out story and characters, and some darker themes than most other media targeted to that age group will most likely draw in an older periphery demographic.<br><br>STORY: the amnesiac main character learns about (and fights for) the main empire of the mental world, but soon finds himself embroiled in a conflict that affects both the mental world and earth.<br><br>OTHER: customization is a large part of the game. armor, weapons and ships can be modded, and even mods have slots for components.<br><br>Anyone find that interesting? well, Since my last beta request for this game didn&#39;t exactly work out the way I planned, I would like to Email anyone who is willing to beta this (The last person to beta was James Shields.)</p>

            <p>First off, hS didn&#39;t just magically &quot;disappear,&quot; you flipped out and swore at him for giving you constructive criticism - then, with that thread not even halfway down the page, you went looking for a beta. Second, you seem to have gone after him specifically in your requests because, and I quote, &quot;...you seem to have graded hundreds of characters in the last decade, but everyone that grades my other characters are inexperienced.&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re referring to the thee PGs (in which case you&#39;re wrong - all of us, or at least the ones you&#39;ve dealt with, have been doing this for years, some of us professionally on occasion), people outside the PPC, or just the people who have commented on your repeated beta request threads. I obviously can&#39;t speak to the people outside the PPC, but I&#39;ve seen several experienced writers and critics give you feedback.<br><br>Know what else I&#39;ve seen? You have not treated <i>any</i> of them well. You have gotten defensive when people ask you for more information, you have snapped at people who point out flaws in your characters and writing, and I don&#39;t believe I have ever seen you <i>thank</i> anyone, regardless of the nature of their feedback, for taking the time to help you. This is, as you have repeatedly pointed out, immature. It&#39;s also a really great way to ensure that absolutely no one wants to beta for you. Beta-ing an idea requires trust on both parties: trust that the writer will be respected, and trust that the beta will be as well. Nobody wants to get involved with a writer who only takes praise, and rejects or gets angry so quickly... and who never acknowledges that the beta is doing a job for them.<br><br>So - yes, your response to hS was immature, uncalled for, and most of all <i>verbally abusive</i>, which goes against the Constitution (and standards of behavior in most communities). More than that, though, your behavior on the <i>whole</i> has been immature, and it is not okay. Saying &quot;I&#39;m just immature&quot; is not an excuse, nor an apology. To move past this, you need to make a conscious effort to <i>stop</i> this behavior. Until you do, I predict that you are going to have the same problems over and over finding a beta, not just here, but anywhere.<br><br>Unbidden, I keep thinking about how I would&#39;ve responded to one of my reporters doing this, when I was editing the campus newspaper. Or what my adviser would have done, if I had gotten hurt and angry when he pointed out the major flaws in my scholarship application. My priest has a saying about getting your ego out of your writing, which he has thrown at me several times, and which I think may be useful: make sure that your self-image is not reliant on the work that you do, because you will never be satisfied with it (and you will always have trouble taking criticism).</p>

There is a distinct difference between &#39;I don&#39;t agree with your opinion and I think that your theory is factually wrong&#39; and &#39;You&#39;re an idiot and your opinion is built on lies and stupidity&#39;. If you find that you&#39;re hurling insults around, just stop.<br><br>--I consider what has been said about Ekyl to be in violation of this. It could be open for debate, but that&#39;s where I am seeing it.<br><br>Article 3. Jokes about subjects such as rape, murder, abuse, bigotry and mental health issues will not be tolerated. These topics are considered to be Unfunny and &#39;it was just a joke!&#39; will not be an accepted argument or excuse under any circumstances.<br><br>There have been <i>so many</i> violations of this one. He was warned multiple times in IRC for this type thing before being banned for it. (He used the name Sheeep on IRC). He&#39;s been warned repeatedly in threads on the Board for this one. He has never, to my knowledge, said he&#39;d actually stop doing it or expressed any understanding of why there is disapproval for it. If I&#39;m wrong and he has actually shown this, I&#39;d like to see a link to it posted.<br><br>Article 4. People engaged in any violation of the Constitution, particularly Articles 1 &amp; 2 will be given at least one actual chance to stop and apologise. Telling someone to shut up because their opinion is unwanted does not constitute a chance. Giving someone a chance means informing them their behavior is wrong or unwanted according to our Constitution and why, as per Article 9.<br><br>Iximaz was very blunt <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=265106;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"> here</a> with this. Others (VM, hS, July, Neshomeh, doctorlit, Desdenelle, and Phobos) have all been rather polite and used more words, but basically said he should stop and change direction. The best that has been given is a &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m immature.&quot; Followed by a great deal more of the same behavior.<br><br>Article 7. If someone says something that seems offensive, but you’re not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. Astonishingly enough, most people aren’t out to offend anyone. (If they are being deliberately insulting, believe me, you’ll have a lot of backup.) Don&#39;t be afraid to ask what someone meant- it isn&#39;t silly to want the full facts.<br><br>I&#39;m fairly sure that it has been stated pretty clearly by  7.65x54R that insult is exactly what he did mean.<br><br>Article 12. The PPC community is kid-, family- and work-friendly — make sure it stays that way. That means no cursing, no graphic violence, sex or whatever. If you feel you have to break this rule, please give a specific warning (and remember, just because you don’t have a problem with something, doesn’t mean others won’t). The PPC shared universe is also kid-, family- and work-friendly, but in this case the rule is to warn for anything that raises your rating, rather than necessarily cutting it out.<br><br>This has been a repeated, repeated issue, and even after the large thread just a couple of days ago, he said this:<br><br><i>You want to see my flamer side too? hint: If I can think of disturbing acts of sexual violence on a whim when perfectly calm, do you really want to see what I think of when angry?</i><br><br><br>It seems like a lot of people have been very kind and put in a lot of effort toward helping 7.65x54R fit in with the community and grow as a person and writer, but that he may not ready for growth at this point in time. <br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m inclined to agree, especially if Ammo Guy has already gotten himself banned from the chat for inappropriate behavior. It might be good to see some documentation of that, if it still exists, but I think it was agreed that bans should apply equally across PPC spaces, so that coupled with what we&#39;ve seen in this thread seems like more than enough justification for us saying &quot;enough is enough.&quot;<br><br>I did see today&#39;s &quot;fine, I&#39;ll stop&quot; in response to KittyEden stating outright that banning might be appropriate, but I think it&#39;s too little too late. He was given plenty of warnings and time before now, and I&#39;ve seen zero indication that Ammo Guy intends to change his ways anytime soon.<br><br>As to the matter of Ekyl allegedly flaming Ammo Guy, even if it&#39;s true, this was not an appropriate way to handle it, and &quot;that other guy did a bad thing, too!&quot; never has been and never will be an excuse for your own bad behavior. Anyway, I seriously doubt Ekyl was anything other than his admittedly blunt self, since the description of the &quot;flaming&quot; is basically &quot;he used a lot of words to say he thinks my story is unfocused because the genres don&#39;t work together&quot;—hardly a dire insult—and I&#39;d bet money that Ekyl never used the words &quot;sax ballz&quot; or any variation thereof. I&#39;m underwhelmed by the accusations, and I don&#39;t think Ammo Guy actually understands what concrit and flaming are.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Ammo Guy (Known as SHEEEP on the IRC, for reasons only clear to him) got in the habit of posting very out-of-context things when he arrived on the IRC:<br><br><blockquote>

<br><br>And then this one started showing up:<br><br><blockquote>

<br><br>There was also assorted bravado:<br><br><blockquote>

<br><br>And then we found out what &quot;Man on Pig&quot; meant:<br><br><blockquote>

<br><br>He was quite quiet for a while, and then this happened:<br><br><blockquote>

In fact, to all appearances, so has Ammo Guy.<br><br>IP bans have, historically, been almost exclusively used for spambots and explicit trolls - the ones who are being disruptive as their sole motivation for being here (and thus won&#39;t leave when they&#39;re told to), rather than the ones who are making at least some effort to join in (even if that effort is solely because they want to write their canon-rending story).

            <p>I&#39;m with hS that we shouldn&#39;t be too eager to resort to IP banning. It&#39;s always possible that it might affect someone besides the person we&#39;re targeting, and it&#39;s difficult to tell if we&#39;ve actually taught someone a lesson if they can&#39;t prove it. If/when he actually does pop up again, we can whack him just as easily then. We&#39;re still rid of him in the meantime, which is what we want.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Ten years is a <i>long</i> time. Longer than some of us have been around the PPC at all. An IP ban seems more symbolic than effective at that stretch.

            <p>A &#39;ban&#39; simply constitutes the community demanding that he leave. It&#39;s not a technical anything. IP blocking is a technical measure which is used to <i>support</i> a ban, in the event that a banned person refuses to stay gone. As an example: Jacer was IP banned because they just kept coming back. zdimensia wasn&#39;t, because she left when she was told to.<br><br>I would consider stating that you&#39;re leaving and then coming straight back as being the same as violating a ban; in that case, I guess the thing to do would be to outright state that he&#39;s banned, and do the &#39;reply one time to say that you understand this, and then never post again&#39; thing. If <i>that</i> gets ignored, it&#39;s onto IP block and delete the messages.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This might be foolish of me to reply to this fracas but I think this needs to be said. First, using ones immaturity is not really an excuse for ones actions. I know that younger people, and older for that matter, can be rather foolish but there is a cut-off point and from what I saw you passed it. Second, time does not cure immaturity if it did we wouldn&#39;t have some of the problems that are around today. Now, I know many people have many definitions of maturity but in my eyes to truly mature one has to constantly reflect on ones actions past, present and future. All things considered in ten years time this whole thing might repeat itself leading us nowhere. Basically what I am saying is examine your actions and think whether you were in the right or wrong.<br><br>I am going to apologize in advance if this just causes more problems and if I come off as insulting since it is not my intent. I just felt I needed to chime in since I rather strongly dislike when something like immaturity is used as an excuse for terrible actions.</p>

            <p>I want you to acknowledge that your behavior towards several people has been wrong, and make some sign that you&#39;re planning on changing this behavior in the future, rather than just handwaving it as though immaturity was some immutable character trait, like blood type or eye color.<br><br>A beta telling you that a story or &#39;verse is &quot;unfocused&quot; is <i>not</i> borderline flaming. It&#39;s actually exactly what a beta <i>should</i> be telling you, and I have to admit I have no sympathy here; that is literally the exact same word that was used, in person, about a piece of writing I asked a professor to look at yesterday. Like... word for word. It&#39;s a very, very helpful criticism, if blunt - it tells you &quot;I need to be more clear about the central plot of this story.&quot;<br><br>Now: <i>You should know how I respond to that kind of stuff. back off or face the suethor rage.</i><br><br>This reads like a threat, and on top of that, it is the <i>exact</i> thing we tend to cite as reasons to PPC a fanfic. The difference between a chronic badfic author and a <i>growing</i> author is their response to concrit: &quot;That&#39;s a borderline flame, how dare you,&quot; versus &quot;I think I see what you mean, but can you be more specific?&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m glad you haven&#39;t raged against people who have beta&#39;d your persona fic. Please take that attitude and apply it here, as well.</p>

            <p>Ekyl does not even know how to read a GDD (yeah, stupid, but I was desperate), but his game designer friend (obviously) does, and did not say it was unfocused. besides, to make it focused in Ekyl&#39;s eyes would have turned the game into a boring, one-trick, CoD-in-space slog.<br><br>And no, it had nothing to do with the plot. it had more to do with a combination of genres that he said was unfocused. A: how can genre combinations be unfocused? and B: other games have done the exact same type of genre combinations and were not unfocused by their very design.<br><br>JS highly praised the characters though, but that&#39;s beyond the point. <br><br>Plus the people who beta&#39;d my persona fic did not say &quot;This essential part of your story sax ballz and needs to change or else the whole thing will sux ballz&quot; or some embellished variation. they all target an essential part of the concept and want it changed because whatever. I got criticism, but the helpful kind that did not do any of the above. he just bluntly told me &quot;It&#39;s too fast.&quot; and I fixed it, no problem.</p>

            <p>First of all, the beta appears to be telling you about the PLOT, not the gameplay, coding, etc. Therefore, bringing stuff like this into the conversation is not good, and essentially amounts to saying &quot;look at stupid Ekyl. If I had a choice, I wouldn&#39;t have let him beta me.&quot; Also, why are bringing a persona fic into this, as well as JS&#39; opinion. Look, please let go of your ego, apologise to everyone.

            <p>Beta for 7.65x54R and in return for your efforts you will receive nothing but insults, verbal abuse, belligerence and attempts to guilt trip you into not giving him even the tiniest hint of criticism. I declined further services to him, I will admit, and did admit I knew someone more qualified to speak on the matter of game design, but only after I was very patient with him and attempted to help to the best of my ability, especially with sharpening up his writing. Apparently he will also attempt to publicly tarnish your name. I do not feel this is something any member of this community should be made to deal with, so after he&#39;s twice lied about me in posts I felt compelled to warn the rest of the Board about what betaing for him is like.

            <p>(we know we&#39;re probably wasting our breath or this post or whatever, but in the interest of good faith, we will try.)<br>Rifle Calibre Guy - &quot;he&#39;s also bad&quot; is not an excuse for bad behaviour, which you&#39;ve shown here in spades. You&#39;ve accused Ekyl of bad behaviour while - as far as we&#39;ve seen - they haven&#39;t shown anything of that sort, flipped multiple people off and threw a hissy fit unbecoming of a mature person. That&#39;s the sort of behaviour that gets you detention in school, fired from your job or a harsh reprimand in the army (at the very least; at worse, you could get a disciplinary hearing for insubordination). Basically - not the sort of behaviour people tend to tolerate.<br>If you have a problem with Ekyl, bring it up in a polite, cultured manner. Otherwise people will tell you to mind your manners and/or ignore you.</p>

            <p>Would you be grateful for someone who told you your entire story sucked for no reason other than he&#39;s never seen this kind of genre combination before? yeah, I thought so, especially if it was not in a civil manner. cause seriously, Ekyl was NOT being civil. he was ranting about how some aspect of the concept was horrible by it&#39;s very design and I couldn&#39;t find any way to change those because A: I did not see those as bad, even in retrospect, and B: that would completely change an essential part of the concept for no other reason than &quot;Some rude anonymous person off the internet said so&quot;</p>

            <p>The thing is, a beta&#39;s concrit constitutes advice, not a binding arbitration. You don&#39;t have to do anything they suggest, but you do have to acknowledged that YOU asked for suggestions. Ekyl was using their own time helping you without asking for anything in return. Even if you thought everything they said was complete and other nonsense, the right thing to do would have been to thank them for their time and effort and find another beta. Not to complain about them on the board.</p>

            <p>We haven&#39;t seen any examples of this behavior you claim. If you had copies of the comments in question, then we would be more inclined to believe you. From what I have seen in this thread, Ekyl has been perfectly reasonable. Although I don&#39;t tend to post much, I do lurk quite a bit, and this situation shouldn&#39;t have happened in the first place. It just seems so... sudden.

            <p>So my first thought is that this project might be a bit overambitious. I&#39;m not sure this is something the kinds of studios that make XBOX One or PS4 games would pick up - but then, Hotline Miami is going to be on at least the PS3, so anything can happen I suppose. This isn&#39;t just about distribution, though, but the fact that your game feels like it&#39;s trying to do far too many things at once - you&#39;re familiar with the idea of too many cooks working on a soup? An open world FPS RPG dating sim that tries to be Halo and Higurashi at the same time is going to lack any real focus and at best confuse your player - at worst it&#39;ll be an unplayable mess; I wouldn&#39;t call Halo low-tech either, all things considered. These are not all necessarily good tastes that go well together. And when you say &quot;space you can explore&quot;, that&#39;s kind of a nothing field unless you mean the ability to go into outer space - which again, show me some damn focus in this thing. Also, TV Tropes has no idea what the hell deconstruction is, so don&#39;t use their definition of it in a professional game design document (and really, nobody&#39;s going to care about 1990s shonen anime - not everything has to be anime!). Lastly, I&#39;m not sure you should be talking about art style, music, etc. in the present tense when the game does not currently exist.<br><br>Second: For the love of God, learn how to use capital letters! Tomorrow I&#39;m going to go over this with a finer comb and point out to you where you need to sharpen up the grammar - I&#39;m not saying this to be mean, vindictive, anything like that, but it looks unprofessional and if you give this to a studio or an agent with this presentation they&#39;ll laugh you out the of the room.<br><br>Third: Stop all the references to Stargazer unless you plan to submit both simultaneously or something. Nobody is going to have any clue what you&#39;re talking about - and none of them will care. Also, when you get to describing the gameplay it really comes off as Halo meets Skyrim meets Mass Effect - this is not something new, no matter how you try to spin it. I&#39;m also not sure how you intend the branching paths to go re: choices, few games manage to do this right so you might want to tread carefully. You might want to be careful about throwing around terms only mentioned later in the document, too - either move your setting info up or rephrase. Magnums and pistols seem unnecessary as different weapon classes, as well - pick one.<br><br>Fourthly: The PC waking up to start the game is clichй, do something else. Your game design document probably doesn&#39;t need a whole lot of info on plot, either, though I should stress that&#39;s the gut feeling of someone who&#39;s never built a game from scratch before. I&#39;d have to talk to my game designer friend to get into much more detail than these initial feelings of mine.<br><br>OR:<br><br>We&#39;re not talking about the plot here, that is in how you describe the gameplay (in fact, it&#39;s questionable how relevant plot is at all at this stage, because your audience right now isn&#39;t the player - it&#39;s the studio and the tired programmer who will be having to put this thing together at 3 AM). Those are very different types of game and thus won&#39;t necessarily work as well all mashed together. You specifically asked me to read this over and give you my honest opinion, going &quot;well my brain works differently from yours so whatever&quot; is defeating the entire purpose of the exercise.<br><br>As for how it&#39;s unfocussed, I thought I was quite clear about that. Action RPGs (think Skyrim or Mass Effect), first person shooters and visual novels all play very differently, it&#39;s inherent to the design of each type of game. Even within the same genre you need to have some kind of concrete idea of what the player can do - while they are both action RPGs, Mass Effect and Skyrim are both different in how play unfolds and what situations they&#39;re designed around handling, and just because you can go from first to third person and back in Skyrim doesn&#39;t mean it would be a good FPS (compare shooting a bow in Skyrim to say, firing your rifle in one of the eight billion military FPSes out there already - they feel and operate quite differently due to the design philosophy behind both games). To be fair I&#39;m almost certain there are some FPSes where you can switch from first to second person (ARMA lets you do that, I know), but you still need to be careful not to load the player down with too much stuff, or to make switches in gameplay too jarring. A shooter/RPG suddenly turning into a dating sim or visual novel is not a smooth transition, and those types of games are trying to do very different things in the end.<br><br>(Also, on the note of clutter, you have too many weapon types all taking up the same space. No player is going to want to waste time micromanaging whether they&#39;re using a submachine gun or a PDW, or a sniper rifle or marksman rifle. Streamline it.)<br><br>or finally: <br><br>Quite frankly, if you&#39;re going to argue so much with everybody who offers even the slightest bit of criticism, nobody is going to want to work with you long enough to buy your concept, no matter how polished. I&#39;m trying to help you but remember that you came to me asking for me to look this over and critique it - for free, I must add. I think the issue in re: dating sims is the examples you give are too widespread to illustrate a clear design, and also imply elements that don&#39;t mix well together. I should also caution you that Bioware kind of has the &quot;action RPG with dialogue trees and branching plots&quot; market covered, though they&#39;re by no means the only people doing it. There is more between &quot;bizarre flop&quot; and &quot;soulless cash grab&quot; than you seem to think, but keep in mind that &quot;Mass Effect with a few other bits stuck on&quot; won&#39;t exactly knock people&#39;s socks off.<br><br>(Also, keep in mind that a good melee engine and a good shooting one are fairly different animals - I&#39;d think about which aspect of combat you want to prioritise, and keep in mind a lot of shooters have some melee mechanics already. Not in a &quot;this has been done&quot; sense but in a &quot;you probably don&#39;t need to do the sudden switch in perspectives&quot;.)<br><br>Sorry if you did not find these insulting, but he was basically complaining about how the game wouldn&#39;t work the way I envisioned it. I would have to completely butcher the concept to make it work in his eyes, so why should I do what he says if all he&#39;s saying is &quot;Do as I say or fail miserably&quot;</p>

This may or may not be true, I can’t judge. If it is true, he spent a lot of time and effort on an attempt to help you in a field where he lacks the necessary expertise. Since it didn’t help, this may have been wasting your time, but it certainly wasn’t an attempt to flame and bully you.<br><br>To answer your question: If you, after sincerely considering the response, feel certain that your beta readers are wrong, you should not do what they are saying. The appropriate reaction would be to say “Thanks for your time, I appreciate the effort, although it didn’t help because our brains work too differently”, and then asked for other opinions. A still acceptable, although not polite reaction would be to ignore your betas and ask for other opinions.  Complaining on the board about “flaming” and “bullying” when evidently none of these really happened was really inappropriate.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>As a videogame enthusiast who tried making some stuff (I toyed around with RPGMaker 2000 and FPS Creator, but in the end I didn&#39;t manage to make a playable gane) and playing around with in-game editors like FarCry&#39;s Sandbox myself, this sounds good advice (And I don&#39;t see anything that can be considered an insult). While I don&#39;t agree with all that Ekyl said (for example, SMGs and PDWs taking the same slot is fine to me, as they&#39;re both compact rapid fire weapons), I don&#39;t see any flaming here and... well, most games that try to achieve too much like yours seems to be end up being outright terrible.<br><br>DOn&#39;t get me wrong here, I would love to play a game with all the things you mentioned inside, I&#39;m not against multigenre games - I would love, for example, a anime-style modern day MMORPG in which you can do anything from going to battle with any weapon you like, be it guns or swords or magic, go car racing, manage a home, even be a farmer if you want. (And it to be an huge crossover between all the series I like, obviously)<br>But the point is, there&#39;s no way a game engine is going to be able to do all that stuff needed for either game idea properly today. It&#39;s more or less the reason why in FPS or TPS action games the driving is usually subpar or even terrible.<br><br>As impossible as it may seem, Ekyl was actually trying to make your game more appealing to developers. You can have the best game idea of the world in you mind, but if it&#39;s so complex that it would cost billions to make it... I don&#39;t think many developers would be interested.<br><br><br>That said, your attack on Ekyl was completely unjustified, and your behaviour on the IRC just inacceptable. You were given several chances to understand and apologize, but now I&#39;m leaning towards a ban.</p>

            <p>When Hieronymus Graubart beta&#39;d the first draft of my next mission, he pointed out all the bits that didn&#39;t work. There was no tiptoeing around it- he told me what did and didn&#39;t fit and I listened. It&#39;s why said mission isn&#39;t out yet. I want to make it better, and I needed that blunt honesty to see that the mission, written out of sheer frustration at a badfic, was definitely not the best I could have done. <br><br>The Beta is there for a reason, you know. The ones who just shower you with praise don&#39;t give you ideas as to how you can make your work go from &#39;good&#39; to &#39;excellent&#39;.<br><br>Quite frankly, I&#39;d kill for more Betas like him and Ekyl. </p>

            <p>Are you saying that you <i>only</i> accept positive comments on your work? <br><br>That outlook just defeats the entire point of a beta. These people provide an outsider&#39;s look on your piece. Their point of view might show you something you&#39;ve overlooked or got wrong. They are giving some of their free time to provide a free service for you. Dismissing all of their less-than-positive comments as &quot;flaming&quot; is, in my eyes, the height of disrespect. <br><br><br><br><i>&quot;you would get angry at a painter who painted your house the wrong color, would you?&quot;</i><br><br>Hey. A beta is like if you&#39;re designing something (let&#39;s say a building, for example) and an architect takes a look at your blueprints and says &quot;I like this, this, and this, but there&#39;s a problem here, here, and here. You should fix these things to make your building stable&quot;. Your painter analogy implies that the only thing you want from a beta reader is praise for your work. <br><br><br><br>&quot;<i>You should know how I respond to that kind of stuff. back off or face the suethor rage.</i>&quot;<br><br>Are you saying we should tiptoe around each and every of your sensibilities when giving you feedback on something?
