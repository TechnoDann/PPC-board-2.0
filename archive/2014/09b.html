            <p>I was going to get this posted sooner, but a wild Electabuzz got into the neighborhood power plant and gave us a blackout for 5 hours. Welp.<br><br>Anyhoosers, it only took about seven days or so, but the first draft of the first part of my first mission (yes, first part - I&#39;m splitting it into two parts since it&#39;s so long) is complete and ready for reviewing. Before I open up requests for beta-readers, though, there&#39;s a tiny lil&#39; problem I need to take care of... Rasheeda&#39;s name.<br><br>Since I like the reference to the Rosetta Stone that &quot;Rasheeda&quot; brings, I want to either keep her first name or adapt it in some way that her name can be Anglicized to Rasheeda [something]. Her surname is a lot trickier - I had the Sphinx of Giza in mind, but I can&#39;t find any excuses to make it fit anymore now that I&#39;m learning that it wasn&#39;t the original name. A play on the Egyptian name for the Sphinx, Abū al-Haul (The Terrifying One), would be nice, though something based on Egyptian deities could work too.<br><br>Here are some suggestions I&#39;ve received in past reviews of her character bios. Please feel free to suggest additional ideas, or otherwise weigh in on the ones listed.<br><br>Huinesoron:<br><i>- &quot;&#39;Rosetta&#39; is the Anglicised (version of the French version of the Arabic) name of the town the stone was found in, currently named Rashid/Rašīd. And Rasheeda/Rashida is the feminine version of that name. For what it&#39;s worth, BehindTheName renders it as &#39;rightly guided&#39;.&quot;<br>- &quot;The problem is, you&#39;re very unlikely to be able to justify keeping her Rosetta name. The Arabic Rashid is apparently from the Coptic (late Egyptian) Trashit - and originally, it was called Khito. <br>And... well, do you know how Egyptian names work? I certainly don&#39;t! &#39;-mose&#39; appears to be &#39;son of&#39;, but I don&#39;t know of a &#39;daughter&#39; ending.<br>One possibility would be to coin her an Egyptian first name, and an Arabic surname. So, to keep the link with the Sphinx, she could be Mafemakhet, &#39;Mafdet of the Horizon&#39; - or maybe Mafemkhito? I have no idea whether the language works that way. Then you could surname her al-Rashid, &#39;of Rosetta&#39;, and still juuuust about call her &#39;Rasheeda&#39; in common use.<br>Actually, one more name suggestion - &#39;Tut&#39; is &#39;image&#39;. So something as simple as Tutmafdet, &#39;Image of Mafdet&#39;, could work. And I may be wrong, but I think &#39;-titi&#39; is &#39;has come&#39; - so Mafdetiti (a la Nefertiti) is a pretty scary thought.&quot;</i><br><br>Anonymouse:<br><i>- &quot;...Rasheeda bint Giza should have an Ancient Egyptian name instead of an Arabic name (I.E. &quot;(something) sat Giza&quot;, as &quot;Sat&quot; is &quot;Daughter&quot; or &quot;Daughter of&quot; in Ancient Egyptian)...&quot;</i><br><br>Desdendelle:<br><i>- &quot;...I have one problem with Rasheeda: her last name. From what I know about Arab, Arab-like and Egyptian names, there are next to no &quot;Bint this-and-that&quot; names. There are &quot;Ibn/Bin something-or-the-other&quot; names - quite a lot of them, in fact - but they are &quot;this guy&#39;s son&quot; and not &quot;comes from this place&quot; - &quot;comes from this place&quot; names are of the &quot;Al-place-i&quot; form, like Al-Misri (Egypt) or Al-Baghdadi (Baghdad, obviously). There are also &quot;Abu-&quot; (father of) and &quot;Um-&quot; (mother of) names - Abu-Bakr, Um-Culthum, etc - which can also denote certain features (&quot;Abu Alhureira&quot; = &quot;Father of a cat&quot; = &quot;Steps-softly&quot;) or be used as noms de guerre (&quot;Abu Alwalid&quot; = &quot;father of the child&quot;, Khaled Mash&#39;al&#39;s nom de guerre).<br>&quot;Bint Giza&quot;, as a surname, simply does not fit into any of those categories. Of course, if you were aiming for something other than an Arabic name, disregard the above.&quot;<br>- &quot;The daughter term is &quot;Bint&quot;, but it simply isn&#39;t used much. I&#39;ve mostly heard about &quot;Um-&quot; names when talking about daughters. I think that the correct name (with the reference to Giza) would be &quot;Algizawi&quot;. Of course, the sphinx has no connection to Arab culture; the Ancient Egyptians weren&#39;t Arabs. Wikipedia suggests &quot;Hor-em-akhet&quot; as the Sphinx&#39;s Ancient Egyptian name (its current name is, apparently, Abu Alhul - The Terrifying One). That might be a better thing to work off from.&quot;</i></p>

            <p>Name her Something al-Rashid - Something of Rosetta - and give her a semi-mystical connection to the town. Maybe she&#39;s some form of destined guardian, or maybe it&#39;s just that she was born there and after so long, she&#39;s fond enough of it that she wants to keep it safe. Then grant her &#39;Rosetta&#39; as a <i>nickname</i> - somewhat like referring to Arthur Wellesley as &#39;Wellington&#39;, the name of his duchy.<br><br>Alternately, keep the nickname as above, but give her... any other name you like. The Arabic name of the Sphinx literally means &#39;Father of Dread&#39;, so per Desdendelle, &#39;Um al-Haul&#39; would be &#39;Mother of Dread&#39;. But it&#39;s not a very nice name.<br><br>Aha. Per Anonymouse, you could have a surname &#39;sat Mafdet&#39;, &#39;daughter of Mafdet&#39;. And for a brilliant punny first name... &#39;Khititi&#39;, &#39;Khito (= Rosetta) has come&#39;.<br><br>Khititi Samafdet? That at least looks like a name. Since I&#39;m not sure Egypt used surnames, Samafdet would be a descriptive title (a la &#39;Son of Horus&#39; - so actually, this might be &#39;Samafdet Khititi&#39;), and she could have adopted an Arabic &#39;al-Rashid&#39; to go with it. If she&#39;s literally using that as pure convention, it would be entirely natural for her to give her name as &#39;Samafdet Khititi of Rosetta&#39;... which would give you the &#39;Rose&#39; nickname.<br><br>Or perhaps something even simpler: Rasheeda Khititi. Modern name, ancient name, massive redundancy, Rosetta reference, terrible cat pun. What&#39;s not to like?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Rasheeda Khititi... Hmmm, tempting as it sounds as a name for her, I think I&#39;ll have to pass. Knowing her, she&#39;d probably prefer a more serious name, preferably without redundancy or wordplay. Mafdetiti sounds good for a surname, though, with emphasis on the second syllable.<br><br>I&#39;ll wait on a few other peoples&#39; opinions, but I&#39;ll keep either Rasheeda Mafdetiti or Mafdetiti Al-Rashid in mind.<br><br>(Not relevant, but I posted yesterday that I&#39;m looking for betas for my Mission 1, Part 1, btw!

            <p>Actually a quadruple pluggle, though two of them have been seen before...<br><br>First up, <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndReturn.htm">Returning</a> was my entry in my last Monthlyish Writing Challenge; it&#39;s now up on the Webplex in its proper place.<br><br>Secondly, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g0ydi4ik2JM3jLLkyAui9deCbNNOsWHen4_CgyRDS4c/pub">Boorman</a> is technically a full Department of WhatThe/DAVD mission, and it&#39;s technically in LotR, but... yeah. Written for an earlier thread, it&#39;s here if you missed it.<br><br>New stuff! First... er, third, a bit of current events: <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndEuro.htm">End of the Beginning: Euromadian</a>, in which Nyx Nightingale gets news from home, and I resolve a minor continuity error.<br><br>And finally, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFddeA6xDGWo5vJxDvOUep_LPJIzrmgZ5EwUUzFj8jg/pub">Getting Some Exorcise</a>, a new outing for Agents Sandra and Freckles, who have just transferred to the DBS. Not a mission, it&#39;s... well, you&#39;ll see.<br><br>Regarding the azhdarchid: the wraith version is supposed to be <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/wp-content/blogs.dir/471/files/2012/05/i-9d3709385f33473a7dc23a1110ae26d7-Hersey-Quetz-1980-May-2010.jpg">this early reconstruction</a>, which is frankly terrifying.

            <p><u>On <i>Returning</i></u><br>This is a pleaasant little interlude, although there was one things about it that I do admit to being confused about even after several read-throughs. Are the members of the angry mob supposed to be other PPC agents? It seems to be taking place in the PPC judging from all the references to impossible achitecture and various departments, but the mob members are just a generic formless mass. It might have been nice to detail them up at least a little with phrases like &quot;a sea of furious black-clad figures&quot; or &quot;she narrowly avoided the grasps of several [department] agents&quot; or what have you.<br><br><u>On <i>Boorman</i></u><br>The Boorman script was not something I was previously familiar with, so it was interesting to get a bit of insight into it. I also really like how Kyaris was called into the mission for a consult. That&#39;s something I&#39;d actually like to see a bit more, the pop-in consultation/assist. It&#39;s something that could potentially lend itself to good bits.<br><br><u>On <i>End of the Beginning: Euromadian</i></u><br>I liked this piece, although I will say I can see how some people (like Ekyl did down below) would not given the current events angle on it. The PPC is (typically) somewhat light and humorous, whereas the conflict in Ukraine is anything but. I personally enjoyed the look into Nyx&#39;s backstory and I liked the interaction between her and Tango. I don&#39;t believe the internal monologue would have worked in this case. Plus, as you said in your reply to Ekyl, a story where an agent&#39;s partner helps them heal and carry on from their issues is far more interesting (both plot and character-wise) than just a struggle inside a person&#39;s own head.<br><br><u>On <i>Getting Some Exorcise</i></u><br>This was probably my favorite, and I&#39;m not just saying that because of the little nod to Xericka (although it certainly didn&#39;t hurt). This was just plain fun. Each exorcism scene was interesting and had some good humorous bits in them. I liked seeing your agents being basically corralled into become test subjects for the DBS. I think my only major complaint was that it wasn&#39;t quite clear what was going on in the <i>Pokemon</i>-themed scene. It took me couple of read-throughs to understand what Sandra and Freckles had actually done.<br><br>All in all, some kudos-worthy additions to PPC lore.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve made tweaks in <i>Returning</i> and <i>Exorcise</i> in response to your comments; in particular I&#39;ve added a few more clauses of description to the <i>Pokemon/Discworld</i> scene, which as you said was somewhat unclear. In my defence, a shield:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/AShield.jpg"><br><br>The idea of agents dropping in to consult is one I explored at length in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12D2DmSZCDJ73qVYlw84vK5USwi80GgjA5DmMBaQWT2M/pub">Of Wolves and Fellowship</a>, which features two actual examples and discussion of several others (and jokes about the DOOCH, which are always fun). It&#39;s one of those things that must happen, but with a few exceptions - the Department of Redundancy Department and the Department of Redundancy Department, for instance - we don&#39;t often see it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I just got up and gave these a read-through, so a lot of these might just be initial impressions that I&#39;ll either not entirely agree with upon further reflection or find I wish to elaborate on, but hey, I need to get my critic muscles moving again somehow, and people&#39;ve been saying there needs to be more concrit around here, so here we go. Starting bottom up because a) I feel like it and b) the new stuff is at the end of the plug:<br><br>I might be biased against the Bad Slash one because now I have to completely start from scratch on one of my missions. I can&#39;t even keep one of the main agents&#39; names or use LOTR. Grrrr. ;) But seriously, I like the use of nonconventional exorcism methods/ones more tied to the actual canon, it&#39;s an interesting touch and I&#39;m a little tired of all exorcisms consisting of nothing but hitting things with books and screaming &quot;Avaunt&quot; over and over. It&#39;s nice to see other ways of doing things, even if I&#39;m beaten to writing them. :P <br><br>Expelling a wraith from Arda through music and dance is an especially nice touch. The QAL pointing out Freckles is an odd nickname is pretty neat too - I&#39;m not sure I like them being established as &quot;among the SO’s most notorious Assassins&quot; right out the gate though. I&#39;ve certainly never seen these agents before, but I could be wrong (the wiki doesn&#39;t say anything about them...), and either way that feels like a title that needs to be earned, not simply slapped on the second somebody shows up - especially with the market so competitive on that ground. It turns out to have nothing to do with the rest of the mission so I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a point to having it - you could do with just going right to the QAL being surprised they want Bad Slash, specifically. Hieronymus went into the whole Patronus thing so I won&#39;t bother commenting on that, though I&#39;m curious about why these all seem to be crossovers. I do sort of wish these had been established as <i>a</i> way to do it as opposed to <i>the</i> way, as well, if nothing else because it&#39;s kind of constraining to future authors. <br><br>I&#39;m of two minds about the Nyx one, though part of that might be me being preoccupied by the fact we&#39;re looking at the start of WW3. It&#39;s hard to be amused by a story around something that&#39;s going to end with us all being blown back to the Bronze Age at best. I like the idea of agents actually reacting to stuff going on back home, though, it&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t come up a lot and really helps HQ feel more alive - these agents came from <i>somewhere</i> after all. I also think this piece could&#39;ve been better served as just Nyx on her own - maybe that&#39;s personal preference but I didn&#39;t really feel like Tango added much except her own commentary, a lot of which felt like repeating things Nyx and the reader already know. If this were Nyx alone with her thoughts it might&#39;ve been more effective. In spirit of full disclosure, though, I&#39;ve never particularly liked Nyx and thus my enjoyment of this was a little limited between that and the whole World War Three thing. <br><br>Boorman is interesting and I don&#39;t have much to pick at. While it feels like a bit of a needless jab at a project that ended up never happening, I do like the idea of accidentally crossing from a fic written around Boorman&#39;s script to Boorman&#39;s script itself, as well as stuff like the recurring DAVD flashpatch problem (though in places it seems to imply DAVD simply doesn&#39;t <i>have</i> one). I also find Rile X getting dragged along to serve as Mortic&#39;s partner amusing. Mortic&#39;s felt kind of inconsistently written in some past things he&#39;s been in, but here he works well enough. <br><br>&quot;I need a partner,&quot; Mortic said bluntly. <br>Returning... I&#39;m pretty neutral on, I must admit. Not a lot earth shaking here, but also nothing I&#39;d say is super bad, though I think prequel jokes are a little passé by now - next year even ROTS will have been a decade ago. And just because it&#39;s unclear, which lobby is being referred to re: potted plants?</p>

            <p>Apparently some things I&#39;d thought I&#39;d made quite clear are being completely mis-read... well, anyway, in order.<br><br>~<br><br>-Sandra and Freckles <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_RLF3oGSMN1h1SzbEzW6ldcEuZPfJHvAfM3FxHwHeQc/pub">have a previous full mission</a>. They&#39;re not new agents.<br><br>-The idea of exploring alternate exorcisms is one that&#39;s been explored in two recent threads; the Patronus and song exorcisms are my original reactions in those threads. (This is one that needs to go in the A/N, which I need to write)<br><br>-They aren&#39;t notorious Assassins. The dialogue in that scene, I thought, made it pretty clear - after Freckles says that line, Sandra immediately responds with &#39;that doesn&#39;t sound like us&#39;, Freckles says &#39;didn&#39;t think so&#39;... I&#39;m not sure how this ended up unclear, so can you suggest what needs to be changed?<br><br>-The exorcisms aren&#39;t crossovers, any more than using a Christian-style bell-book-candle in a universe without Christianity is a crossover. An exorcism is a <i>technique</i>. The &#39;Lord of the Rings style exorcism&#39; was used in a <i>Labyrinth</i> fic. Would it help if I added &#39;Exorcism Method&#39; in front of each number? It&#39;ll look a bit clumsy, which is why I tried to restrict it to the first instance, but if it&#39;s unclear... (This is probably another one for the A/N, regardless)<br><br>-I don&#39;t know why you think them appearing in S&amp;F&#39;s report makes them &#39;<i>the</i> way&#39;, any more than Jay and Acacia using bows makes that <i>the</i> way of assassinating Sues. I guess that can go in the A/N as well, since it&#39;s definitely not part of the story.<br><br>~<br><br>-Nyx: I... don&#39;t think this was meant to be a particularly amusing story? Nyx certainly isn&#39;t amused by it. The second half is mildly humorous, I suppose, but isn&#39;t about Ukraine. Tango is there to ask the question about her name - the continuity error mentioned in my description - and because, honestly, &#39;character thinks about how miserable she is&#39; isn&#39;t a story I&#39;m interested in writing. &#39;Character talks to her partner and partner helps her carry on&#39; is more interesting.<br><br>-You are, of course, entitled to like or dislike any characters you please. ;) Mind if I ask what you don&#39;t like about Nyx?<br><br>~<br><br>-&#39;A needless jab&#39;... doesn&#39;t that kind of describe the PPC?<br><br>-The DAVD flashpatch was just fun to play with.<br><br>-I know Mort&#39;s been a bit up-and-down - he&#39;s ridiculously old, but doesn&#39;t really feel it, probably because his backstory&#39;s been added piecemeal. I&#39;ll probably be tweaking him when I read through his stuff.<br><br>-I&#39;ll consider the dialogue tag, thanks.<br><br>-Er... I was never siccing OFUM on <i>Boorman</i>. The joke here is that the PPC can&#39;t do anything official about the Boorman canon - it&#39;s a canon, however much they don&#39;t like it. &#39;if we so much as look sideways at this Script, we&#39;ll be for it!&#39; But... did you recognise the name of Miss Lina Holling, noted for being the protagonist of OFUM 1 and ending the year in a relationship with Gimli? If there was anyone who&#39;d be willing to risk the wrath of Jurisfiction by stepping in to stop Gimli being abused, it&#39;s Lina Holling. Not by going after the author - again, this <i>isn&#39;t fanfic</i>, OFUM would have no jurisdiction. But B!Gandalf is still susceptible to an axe to the knees... I suppose I could make it clearer that they&#39;re not trying to get at the author (though why that would need saying, in a PPC story, I&#39;m not sure), but I&#39;d prefer not to explain the joke more than I have to.<br><br>~<br><br>-The prequel joke: I guess. This is more a joke about prequel jokes, though. I needed something instantly recognisable as A Thing People Don&#39;t Like, and that took the position.<br><br>-The lobby is... the PPC lobby? I don&#39;t know; it&#39;s in one of the early spinoffs - a lobby with potted plants. There&#39;s not a lot more to say about it, other than that Morgan parked her TARDIS there before her first regeneration.<br><br>~<br><br>Overall: thanks for the comments. I&#39;ll be sure to poke the ones that need poking, and get that A/N written for GSE.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That&#39;s the only reason I said it seemed like you were saying it was <i>the</i> way to do it. Citing Jay and Acacia is kind of a false starter given they used multiple assassination methods and also didn&#39;t imply any in particular were the standard issue way Sues were supposed to be killed. Aside from obvious stuff like the charge list, taking a form that fits the canon and makes sense as a killer (so much for that given half the PPC goes in as elves now...), etc. And yeah, me not having found the previous S&amp;F mission is why I admitted my unfamiliarity and basically, y&#39;know, asked.

            <p>The description is partly from the HP wiki, and partly just from my own head. I&#39;ll definitely change &#39;white&#39; to &#39;silver&#39;, that&#39;s a pure error. I think the description of the actual casting - beam of light becomes Patronus - is close enough, since it could read simply as the Patronus moving very fast. I&#39;ll reword it as a <i>streak</i> of light, though, since that more explicitly has it as a discrete object. The Deathly Hallows examples show that they do sometimes physically attack, so I have no qualms about that.<br><br>The preamble, though... I don&#39;t know. I like it, and I&#39;ve explicitly classed it as &#39;secondary&#39;, ie, as a focussing aid. How much focus do HP spells take? Is it even possible to mutter the words of a spell without firing it off? My reading (er, of my own story ;^-^) is that Sandra was still getting her mind focussed through the remember/mutter/star sequence; the actual casting of the spell begins when she opens her eyes.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Otherwise I would have extended the quotes to include Harry’s Happy Thoughts and other preparations.  I actually like the invoking of canon and the canon-compatible wand movement. What bothers me is the part where the corporeal Patronus apparently jumps out of the point where the streak of light hits the ground, when it is expected to come from the tip of the wand.<br><br>I only glanced on the HP wiki and cannot tell how reliable it is (the place I usually go to look things up is <a href="http://www.hp-lexicon.org">The Harry Potter Lexicon</a>). But apparently they didn’t do a deep analysis. Remus Lupin may depend on pre-werewolf memories because he doesn’t get happiness in his current life. Harry doesn’t use memories so often, and he tells Hermione/others that what she/they need(s) is a “Happy Thought”. When I’m at home I may post more quotes just to show off.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The idea I&#39;m trying for is spell &gt; streak/beam of light shoots out and hits the ground &gt; light resolves into silver squirrel Patronus. It was badly phrased, but the light was never supposed to persist after hitting the ground. The light <i>is</i> the Patronus - just either not yet resolved into its true shape, or simply moving too fast to make out. I&#39;ve tweaked it again; it now reads like this:<br><br><i>A burning silver streak of light burst from her wand, lancing past Freckles and striking the ground in front of Psycho!Frodo. The blazing form of Sandra’s Patronus crouched for an instant, then leapt in a burst of electric fire. Frodo had no time to run.</i><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It doesn&#39;t actually need to fit exactly what I imagine from reading the books. The Patronus just adapts beautifully to a world that&#39;s not its home.<br><br>Since I collected most of these quotes anyway (and intended to get the rest when I will reread DH), here is what we know of &quot;Happy Memories&quot;:<br><br>&quot;[You conjure a Patronus] with an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.&quot;   (PA 12, Lupin teaching Harry)<br><br>&quot;[Harry ...] settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.  <br>&#39;Right,&#39; he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful soaring sensation in his stomach.&quot; (PA 12, practicing.)<br><br>&quot;Harry thought hard, and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the House Championship last year definitely qualified as very happy […]  <br>&#39;Ready,&#39; said Harry, trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about Gryffindor winning [...]&quot; (PA 12, practicing.)<br><br>&quot;He racked his brains. A really, really happy memory … one that he could turn into a good, strong Patronus … <br>The moment when he&#39;d first found out he was a wizard, and would be leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn&#39;t a happy memory, he didn&#39;t know what was … concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he&#39;d realised he&#39;d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once more.&quot; (PA 12, practicing. First successful attempt  with a Bogart pretending to be a Dementor.)<br><br>&quot;He didn&#39;t stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, &#39;<i>Expecto patronum!</i>&#39;&quot; (PA 13. Harry doesn&#39;t need a memory. Playing Quidditch <b>is</b> happiness, and he is about to catch the Snitch.)<br><br>&quot;&#39;Hermione, think of something happy!&#39; Harry yelled […] <br><i>I&#39;m going to live with my godfather. I&#39;m leaving the Dursleys.</i> <br>He forced himself to think of Sirius, and only Sirius, and began to chant: Expecto patronum! Expecto patronum!&quot; (PA 20. Still depending on a recent conversation, but more an expectation than a memory. Hermione tries and fails.)<br><br>&quot;And then it hit him – he understood. He hadn&#39;t seen his father – he had seen himself – <br>Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.<br>&#39;EXPECTO PATRONUM!&#39; he yelled.&quot; (PA 21. Time traveling Harry does what he watched himself doing.)<br><br>&quot;He summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and Hermione, raised his wand and cried, &#39;<i>Expecto patronum!</i>&#39;&quot; (GF 31, Third Task.)<br><br>&quot;He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again – <br>And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breath.<br>&#39;<i>EXPECTO PATRONUM!</i>&#39;&quot; (OP 1, Harry had nearly been overwhelmed.) <br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve got to think of something happy.&quot; (OP 27, Harry teaching Dumbledore&#39;s Army.) <br><br>&quot;Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her being sacked.&quot; (OP 31, examination.) <br><br>&quot;It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered. ‘<i>Expecto patronum!</i>&quot; (DH 28.) <br><br>&quot;’That’s right, Harry ... come on, think of something happy  ...’ <br>‘Something happy?’ he said, his voice cracked.<br>‘We’re all still here,’ she whispered, ‘we’re still fighting. Come on, now ...’&quot; (DH 32, Luna Lovegood helping out.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I actually ran into the pinhead on the hilariously-titled <a href="http://chasmosaurs.blogspot.co.uk/">Love in the Time of Chasmosaurs</a>, though I think I remember seeing it in a book when I was a kid (and being suitably horrified). I think there&#39;s been a couple of links across to TZ, but I haven&#39;t archive-binged it as yet. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get there... :D<br><br>LB4T: apparently there was a female <i>Quetzalcoatlus</i> in III and VII. It looked like <a href="http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080729075654/landbeforetime/images/5/5f/Quetzalcoatlus_2.jpg">this</a> (on the left); seems it was of the bipedal variety, and has a terribly shrunken neck and bloated body to go with it. It also didn&#39;t speak, but was &#39;friendly&#39;. So it&#39;s a possible.<br><br>Other azhdarchids I know of are in the <i>Dinotopia</i> series - as <i>Quetzalcoatlus skybax</i> - and one brief appearance in <i>Walking with Dinosaurs</i> of yet another Quetzal. Neither of those talk, though the Skybaxes are intelligent. <i>Dinotopia</i> also has the rarely-seen <i>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</i>, which are larger and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatlus">have the advantage of being real</a>. Still don&#39;t talk, though.<br><br>Or at least, don&#39;t talk <i>English</i>. It&#39;s well established that there are numerous Saurian languages on Dinotopia (Bix speaks a lot of them), so presumably the pterosaurs do talk. So maybe our unnamed canon azhdarchid was... hmm.<br><br>Actually, the wiki tells me there <i>is</i> a talking Skybax - Windchaser, from the novel of the same name. He&#39;s reclusive, but ends up as human/Skybax ambassador. So he might fit, possibly once he gets old. The canon can&#39;t be Nimbus, really - he and Cirrus come across as too adventurous. But Windchaser, I can see...<br><br>(Yes, they&#39;re all Quetzals. I&#39;m not sure popular culture has <i>heard</i> of any other azhdarchids...)<br><br>Missions nitpicking random things - and pterosaur anatomy is pretty random - are always a good thing! Provided they do it in an accessible way; hopefully even someone who&#39;s never heard of <i>Azhdarchidae</i> got that possibly!Windchaser was a giant flying reptile.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And speaking of the devil... People were actually talking about you and Agent!Ella Darcy in a threat a few ago. <br><br>It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you! I heard quite a bit about you in that threat and read a few of your writings. Quite impressive stuff and even more so considering you were the youngest to write for PPC. <br><br>I can see from your missions that you were a LoTR fan and the time and I think it would be safe to assume that you still are. What other fandoms do you keep these days? <br><br>As a returning Oldbie Gift, have a Rorschach Book (Changes according to your current reading interests.) <br><br>I hope you do hang around us at least a bit.

            <p>Hello wiki! I have been reading this wiki for 4 months now and thought it was time to introduce my self on the board. I have become completely engrossed in the wiki and have read: the original series, the histories (the one with origin in it, lofty skies, and crashing down, to be specific), several essays about sues and conspiracy theories, and most of the legendary badfics, except celebrian, which was too disgusting to read past the second chapter without vomiting. If I read the FAQs correctly, I am now supposed to bum around on the board for a bit, right?</p>

            <p>So what are your fandoms? You mentioned C***b***n, so I&#39;m assuming you like Lord of the Rings/Tolkien in general. (Also, while I appreciate your mental fortitude, we don&#39;t generally make people read Legendary Badfics before joining.) Do you have a favorite spinoff yet? Mine are Caddy-shack&#39;s and Herr Wozzeck&#39;s.<br><br>Anyway, I look forward to hearing more from you. Enjoy your complementary peanut butter cookies!

Five years ago she stopped posting anywhere -- LJ, ff.net, deviantart. She wasn&#39;t active here for a long time before then, but she&#39;s well-known in LotR fandom...<br><br>In the last thing she posted in her journal, she joked about her husband being worried she had swine flu. <br><br>Like I said, a long shot.

            <p>Funny, I check in here every few months or few years to see if this place is still going (obviously it is, I mean who am I kidding, and may the PPC live on forever) - just so happened to see this post tonight.<br><br>I also have wondered about Boz over the years. I still think about her and wonder what happened to this day. She disappeared very suddenly. There was no indication, from what I recall, that she was leaving or that anything was wrong. Maybe she just decided to leave the fandom and make a clean break. Whatever the case, I hope she and her family are well. :\ </p>

            <p>Wait, did we call you Fondy? I don&#39;t actually remember doing so, but it&#39;s such an <i>obvious</i> nickname...<br><br>Anyway, hi! Yay, I&#39;m remembered. ^-^ Unfortunately, I can&#39;t help with Boz, though VixenMage is right that LJ was all sort of fading at that time. Question: did she stop posting at exactly the same time everywhere, or just fade out over time? Checking the Board archives, it seems she posted surprisingly little (that survives), and her last recorded post is waaay back in May 2006 (on a Fill the Plotholes thread, of all things). LJ is 2009... but her Friends Only banner says the following:<br><br><i>Please be advised that my online time is seriously limited if not all but non-existent these days, though.</i><br><br>That was in March; she stopped posting in July. Anyone remember how old Bozling was?<br><br>And yeah, it looks like she just faded out over time. She stopped writing fanfic on ffn and Open Scrolls ca. Sept 08; she last posted on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180005-boz4pm">Goodreads</a> in Dec 08; she last posted on Yuki <a href="http://nenya.u.yuku.com/#303842">Jan 09</a>; deviantArt in 07; everything indicates someone with just less and less time to be online, not someone who was deeply involved and then suddenly died.<br><br>Ehm... she was based in London, apparently, so if she managed to die of swine flu, she&#39;d&#39;ve been <i>ridiculously</i> unlucky: there were less than 300 deaths in England total. My best guess is that she just... ran out of time to Internet.<br><br>Final note: she was already posting irregularly before she stopped. End of May she did a &#39;last few weeks&#39; update, which suggests she wasn&#39;t regularly saying anything much. Her LJ looks like mine - random posts which suddenly stop.<br><br>And... hmm. Her second-to-last post was on Jul 9th, but her <i>replies to comments</i> were all on either the 12th or 19th. Nothing in between. That just happens to be two consecutive Sundays - the day when even people with no time at all can find half an hour here and there. No, I&#39;m definitely going to say &#39;no internet time&#39;, followed by &#39;couldn&#39;t be bothered to go back&#39;. Though that doesn&#39;t explain no emails...<br><br>hS<br><br>(Bet there&#39;s enough personal information in her LJ that we could track her down. For starters - there was a funfair in a park four blocks from her on June 22nd 2009. Who wants to hunt up the details? :D)</p>

            <p>I may have gone as Fondy on here for a while too (?), but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if you picked it up from LJ -- ten years later Kelduiniel *still* calls me Fondy because she prefers it to my actual name. :P<br><br>You, sir, are exactly the sort of person who is useful at this sort of thing! I hope you&#39;re right about her simply being busy. For a long time that was my assumption also. I found a comment I&#39;d made to someone on deviantart in 2011 where I said exactly that. They were the first person to suggest that people had begun to worry if she was okay. I never bothered to ask what this person meant by &quot;people-&quot; how many and at what site, or what sort of information they had- because I assumed she was fine. <br><br>What gets me are the emails. You&#39;re right to think it&#39;s odd, I agree. Boz never struck me as a callous or cold person, and people had started to leave comments on her stuff clearly showing concern, and to the best of my knowledge she never replied to any of them. Still, the fact that she was posting replies two weekends after being sick makes me feel better. <br><br>Also, about [[DELETED AT SUBJECT&#39;S REQUEST]] -- she sent me several private messages a half a year or so ago politely asking if I could delete any trace of comments she&#39;d left on my deviantart page. Stuff to do with fandom, mostly, but she wanted all of it gone. I ended up deleting my entire profile just to be safe. I think she was worried stuff from her past might somehow make it into her public/career life, or maybe it already had. Sending her an ask is still a good idea, though. I&#39;m just hesitant because I don&#39;t want to make her feel anxious about people from her past tracking her down, even if it&#39;s just for information on someone else.<br><br>It&#39;s kind of a mystery. If any of you all manage to find any leads on your England-y side of things, I&#39;d love to know!</p>

            <p>Ask [[DELETED AT SUBJECT&#39;S REQUEST]], I mean. &#39;cause unfortunately (for us), Boz was very good about not saying, like, <i>anything</i> personal.

            <p>I really think it is just a trollfic since the author has Luna Lovegood kind of appear out of nowhere (she is essentially a hippie in this if you must know.) Not to mention the only one in their house, or as the author calls them sorting hats, is Harry himself. Also apparently the Weasleys have multiplied while I wasn&#39;t looking since the author describes the table as being packed full of Ron&#39;s family. Which leads into a very funny mental image since they are in SLytherin and I am imagining the canonical Snapes reaction to such an event.</p>

            <p>Chapter 6 attempts to pin the different Hats (that&#39;s never going to stop being hilarious) down to four different types of Christianity. So how well are they pinned down?<br><br>-Slytherin is Catholicism; the Marian aspect is a dead giveaway. Only it&#39;s a sort of Catholicism that prays to, uh, statues. That sounds more like a corrupted version of the Eastern Catholic fondness for icons than anything I know about Roman Catholicism. I&#39;m also not sure what the &#39;book full of guidelines&#39; is - perhaps it&#39;s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism_of_the_Catholic_Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a>, which would bring us back to Roman Catholicism?<br><br>They&#39;re also all red-haired; I assume that&#39;s a joke about Ireland, or maybe US Irish Catholics. Quite a funny one, actually, and explains why Ron&#39;s a Slytheratholic.<br><br>-After that, I can&#39;t pin names on things. Hufflepuff are clearly defined as &#39;wishy-washy&#39;, but frankly I suspect they&#39;re meant to reflect most of Protestant Christianity. Ravenclaw are &#39;the mean ones&#39;: they hate Slytheratholics, and explicitly hate women as well. Gyffindor is... whatever the author (purportedly) agrees with? It looks like they&#39;re just as strict as Ravenmean, but for &#39;the right reasons&#39; - eg, they agree that women shouldn&#39;t be allowed to work, but their reason is based on positive &#39;they should do this instead&#39; rather than negative &#39;women suck&#39;. So... maybe Ravenmean is meant to portray the Dark Side of whatever demoniation Gryffinbest represents?<br><br>This is why I said Hufflewashy represents most of Protestantism: anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with the Gryffinbest principles (including women staying at home, rejecting the science of evolution, and not celebrating birthdays) is either a Mary-venerating Catholic, or a Hufflewashy. Since I don&#39;t believe the Gryffinbest principles are widely held across Protestantism, that means Hufflewashy is the largest non-Slytheratholic house.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure Luna&#39;s sudden appearance makes it more likely to be a parody - I wouldn&#39;t call it a <i>troll</i>, because if it&#39;s not serious, then it&#39;s seriously well-executed. Draco does the same thing, after all; they just read like character introductions. However, my numbers 1 and 2 reasons for thinking &#39;parody&#39;:<br><br>-Sorting Hats. ^-^<br>-The level of knowledge is too up-and-down. Things like Sorting Hats would imply someone who&#39;s never read the books or seen the films, since it&#39;s <i>not</i> a change to fit the theme - it&#39;s just a very strange mistake. But the overall understanding of the books is too high, even if shown in altered form. It doesn&#39;t work unless you assume it&#39;s deliberate.<br>-Also (I know, I said two...), the author&#39;s notes don&#39;t ring true. She&#39;s not someone you&#39;d see lying, but it is absolutely impossible that she&#39;s received three times as many positive PMs as negative reviews (Ch. 4). And the &#39;I got a PM from someone who thought I wrote the original books despite the fact that they were reading the Harry Potter section of FF.n&#39; disclaimer (Ch. 5) is even less believable.<br><br>So: parody, but pretty good one. It doesn&#39;t poke fun at the beliefs it claims to be espousing: it just lays them out plainly and lets you decide whether or not they&#39;re ridiculous. See: <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal">A Modest Proposal</a>, by J. Swift. Parody and satire are always best when they&#39;re &#39;serious&#39;. ^-^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Just a guess, but the more positive &#39;women should do this instead&#39; sounds to me like it would fit either Southern Baptist or Assemblies of God. Both very popular in the Bible belt of the US. Both are very strict and very restrictive on women&#39;s roles, but do tend to aim for saying &#39;do this instead&#39; not just &#39;we hate women&#39;. They&#39;ve also been, in my experience, very mistrustful of Harry Potter and also frequently of Catholics.  <br><br>Not sure about the Ravenmeans. Fairly sure whatever group they are referencing, it isn&#39;t saying anything nice about them, and the group in question would probably have a different opinion of themselves.</p>

            <p>Southern Baptist in particular is what I think when I hear &#39;highly conservative US Christian&#39;.

            <p>Well, I can think of a few possible denominations that could be the target, but Westboro is a pretty safe choice.<br><br>I don&#39;t really think the large majority of Southern Baptists (or Assemblies of God, small group overall, I think, but numerous here) would be offended at all about the label &#39;highly conservative US Christian&#39;. I live in a highly conservative area (seriously, Prohibition hasn&#39;t even fully ended here), and most of the people I am related to and grew up with are proud of the label conservative. </p>

            <p>Personally, I hear &#39;troll&#39; as an insult, and &#39;parody&#39; as a neutral term. So something which is amusing is something I wouldn&#39;t insult, so I wouldn&#39;t call it a troll...<br><br>The troll-parody-satire distinction, unfortunately, lies in the author&#39;s mindset. All three are designed to look like something they&#39;re not - in this case, an actual Christian who believes what the A/Ns suggest she does. As you say, a troll is doing it to push buttons and make people angry. A parody is doing it to get laughs - &#39;see how silly this is when you push it to the logical extreme&#39; - a la <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9450972/1/Till-The-World-Ends">LonelyStar&#39;s story</a>. Satire is doing it to make a point.<br><br>Personally, I <i>think</i> the author is aiming for satire, because it&#39;s not really bombastic enough for parody, and trolls... tend to be more obvious and less worked-on. But I won&#39;t rule out a very dedicated troll, or even someone entirely serious.<br><br>Ultimately, I&#39;m not sure the lines between them are even <i>this</i> solid. But this is how I see it.<br><br>(Reference: <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/cliffsnotes/literature/whats-the-difference-between-parody-and-satire">Parody and satire</a>. But try and find the difference between trolling and parody... eesh!

            <p>Either parody or trollfic, though I only read the first chapter.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re a Christian now, Harry!&quot; -- and the fic immediately ends, because predestination doesn&#39;t require Harry to head off to fake|Hogwarts to study, he would have been saved even if Hagrid never showed up at the door.  Wizards in HP are born, not made, and Hagrid&#39;s line here tells me that the same holds for Christians.<br><br>The checklist of Petunia&#39;s faults includes not wearing makeup -- sounds like someone&#39;s working off old Tammy Faye Bakker jokes here.  I&#39;ve had my share of run-ins with hardcore fundamentalists, and the usual belief is that wearing makeup is the sin of vanity.  I suppose that &quot;failing&quot; could really be a subtle clue that Petunia will be saved later in the fic, but it&#39;s not worth reading further to find out.</p>

            <p>It could very well be a parody and the second chapter provides a clue. Since when Hagrid tries to convert Harry Petunia tries to bribe him with a second birthday. Although the wording makes it sound like Harry gets a birthday everyday. Then there is that very odd &#39;Birthdays are not of God,&#39; bit that honestly I have never heard as an argument before.<br></p>

            <p>I have no idea. The rationale behind excising Christmas and Easter I could explain, but I honestly have no idea what my mother&#39;s reasons for giving up birthdays were. If I had to hazard a guess, I&#39;d say it had to do with the idea that the day one was born was somehow aloft - that, or the connection to Zodiac? That was another source of evil, I remember that. It could also have been the &quot;pagan symbolism&quot; of candles on a cake. I know there was a lot of angst about candles.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m with Neshomeh. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re comfortable in your own faith, but there are a lot of really nice, really lovely fundamentalists in the world, and several of them write really excellent fanfiction.

            <p>... that birthdays are sometimes seen as venerating another person above God. And, to be fair, if we set aside a whole day to praising and giving gifts to some other person, we&#39;d probably be talking about Cults Of Personality.

And I&#39;m sure there are other reasons (candles could be one, or something about commercialisation, or... I dunno, anything, really. Maybe there&#39;s a New Testament Apocrypha where a birthday ate Thaddeus&#39; sister or something. Stranger things have happened)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It was pretty different with me. As stated elsewhere in this thread, we are Christians ourselves, but thankfully my parents were pretty lax with popular culture. My mom even took me to most of the movies. It was pretty much the same as you with my grandparents, and today the same with older sister, though. Can&#39;t ever mention anything of the sort with anyone of them going off the rails... But yeah, at least your family had the sense to not go off the hinges like this lady.<br><br>Yeah, this sort of makes all of us look Bad in the eyes of others. This sort of thing leaves a lesser form of the damage that things like Chick Tracks, Westboro and Quiverfulls do to the rest of us. And it&#39;s also really, really stupid. <br><br>But yeah, it is falling into a slippery slope fallacy, though I guess the fear is that they are going to convert to Wicca or (heavens forbid!) Satanism, which is also pretty stupid because first of all, those are often equated with each other (Wiccans workship the devil etc) when they have nothing in common, and secondly, as has been stated multiple times in defence by them, the religious practices of Wicca have  nothing in common with HP-verse magic. <br><br>&quot;communing with the dead and spirit world, sorcery, curses, occult symbology, black magic and demon possession&quot;, all charges laden against HP and correlated with Wicca, nothing of that figures even slightly in their beliefs. Oh and also, apparently what critics often call Wicca is something that is lump together from many different spiritualist practices that have little in common with each other, so there is that too.      </p>

            <p>didn&#39;t know you and snowy were Christian. I&#39;m an atheist.<br>and the reason I hate this particular fic is because it&#39;s more proof that extreme religion is invading our culture. In addition to the obvious perversion of one of the most beloved franchises in the world just to make it fit with their nutty views. I have a theory on the fic&#39;s origin.<br><br><br>this.... thing needs to be sporked. and I will happily heap praise on whoever rips into this abomination(seeing as I&#39;m not going to ask permission in the near future).<br><br>as for the origin, It may have come from a member of the Kids in ministry international/kids on fire ministries group. or worse, Becky Fisher herself( if that is the case that.... witch will be truly unforgivable). <br><br>and yes, the implications of painting devil worship on Wiccans is disturbing. essentially it means that extremist nutjobs have the moral right to destroy them(demonization is the first stage of genocide).</p>

I hope I came off as mostly just discussing things like my faith and criticism of HP with Snowy<br>and why things like this story may offend me, but if I did anything at all hurtful I am sorry. I understand the reason for the ban on religious fic, I throughly support it and I call off the comments on missioning this fic.

            <p>My understanding was that we made a community decision not to send any more missions into fanfic <i>based on religious scripture</i>, not religious fic in general.

            <p>...says that it was specifically &#39;fic of religious texts - I remember being super uncomfortable that Bible-fanfic even <i>existed</i>, at the time of this debate. (I also remember a post by Mum&#39;s The Word that involved casting the entirety of the PPC as wide-eyed children in need of guidance, which was largely ignored although the <i>conclusion</i> agreed with. Yet I somehow don&#39;t remember who made the final call. The mind, she&#39;s a seive.)<br><br>My instinct would be to uphold that call, with a caveat that no religious &#39;fic whatsoever should be tackled unless the author feels they can do it without malice or insult or disrespect. As I may have mentioned, my <s>D&amp;D</s> Pathfinder group took great pleasure in verbally MSTing it as I read it, with several of the complaints being more along the lines of &quot;SAID, dammit! It&#39;s a good word, not a swear!&quot; and &quot;Okay, if Harry&#39;s never even seen a cross before, how is he suddenly referencing Bible verses in conversation?&quot; and, from the DM&#39;s roommate, who&#39;s actually a Sunday School teacher, &quot;THAT WAS THE WRONG TENSE FOR THAT.

            <p>That puts the whole thing waaaaaaay back in 2004-2005... which is three quarters of the lifespan of the PPC. For that matter, the moratorium on Emergencies was half our existence ago...<br><br>I&#39;d hope the &#39;without malice or insult or disrespect&#39; statement would go for all fic, not just religious fic - and that it would go without saying. If people are bashing <i>the subject matter itself</i>, rather than the <i>treatment</i> of it, they&#39;re doing the PPC wrong. A girl who falls into Middle-earth can be good - but presentation of it as a Mary-Sue is bad. Slash can be good - but bad slash is bad. A, I dunno, devout Scientologist* attempting to convert Darth Vader could be good, provided it bends neither the rules of the universe nor the characterisation of Vader (so, uh, it probably wouldn&#39;t <i>work</i>, and would probably end with Simon Tologist being force-choked, but that&#39;s Vader for you).<br><br>Agents can disagree with the beliefs someone states in a mission - but they should limit their <i>abuse</i> to places where it&#39;s done badly. And, like anything else, they should do their research. You wouldn&#39;t insult an author for giving their Elf a bow, or even insult the story for using &#39;such a hopelessly obsolete weapon&#39;; you&#39;d insult the fact that said bow is made of obsidian, <i>after</i> checking that obsidian bows weren&#39;t a thing. Equally, you wouldn&#39;t insult Christian!Hagrid for saying that &#39;Evolution is a fairytale&#39;, though you might vehemently <i>disagree</i> with him - you&#39;d insult him for overriding Petunia&#39;s ability to say anything in response to that statement, for describing atheism as a religion, and for slapping random adjectives on the end of every dialogue tag he uses.<br><br>Frankly, there&#39;s so much to poke fun at in this story without ever touching on the beliefs of the author that I don&#39;t know why you would.<br><br>Actually, that&#39;s not true: I <i>do</i> know, and something like the evolution part might easily provoke me into a character rant. But... hmm. I&#39;m beginning to see your point.<br><br>To take a safe example: imagine you read a story by a devout Greek Pantheon worshipper who had a character claim that in the Real World, there&#39;s a bunch of gods living on top of Mount Olympus, looking just like people (only prettier). Well, that&#39;s provably false - you can look up satellite photos of the mountain, and they&#39;re not there. So... would an agent be allowed to call that stupid? It <i>is</i> stupid, because you can absolutely prove they&#39;re not there - but the character insists they are, and seems to be echoing the beliefs of the author.<br><br>Darn. This just got annoyingly complex. Is this why we banned it to start with?<br><br>hS</p>

I seem to remember a (more figurative) knock against Monica in the Original Series, too; what&#39;s with all the TbaA hate, early PPCers?  :(<br><br>There was also one scene where Kippur showed the author has eroded their own logic/argument:<br><br><b><i>“Now, remember, these friends are good Christians. So behave yourself.&quot;</i><br><br>“As opposed to bad Christians?” Alec muttered.</b><br><br>This is the closest the mission gets to addressing the religion itself.<br><br>So, uh, yeah.  I would personally be in favor of lifting that ban, just for the sake of having a greater variety of missions to do.  (Same for real person fics, but that&#39;s maybe a discussion for another day.)</p>

            <p>... it being brought up on the Board that the PPC are not allowed to spork badfics with a religious angle. It must have been years ago, probably around the time I joined, so I don&#39;t remember many of the details.<br>Somebody brought up a truly horrendous HP badfic where everyone in Hogwarts were getting stoned and having premarital sex and nobody would be able to touch canon with a fifty feet pole. But since it was written from a religious standpoint, we weren&#39;t allowed to kill it. I think the idea was that it would be impossible to spork the fic without touching on the underlying themes and that could come close to bashing somebodies religious beliefs.<br>Frankly, I found this rather silly for various reasons, but since it&#39;s not hard to simply steer clear of religious fics, I never felt like objecting openly to the rule. *dramatic pause* Until now.<br>No, it&#39;s still not something I feel strongly about. I would be happy to see the rule go, because I simply don&#39;t think that religion should be given that sort of special status (after all, we kick people off the Board for bashing LGBTQs, even if they claim that they are simply stating their sincerely held religious belief), but I am not religious in any way myself. If other people are uncomfortable with the idea and the rule stays I&#39;ll simply carry on as I always have and avoid those kinds of fics.</p>

            <p>that it would be nearly impossible to stay respectful of other people&#39;s religious views when they are vastly different than the PPCer who is trying to spork the material. Or at least that many people would find it very difficult, and all it would take for serious unrest to erupt on the Board would be one person who was not capable of handling that delicate situation who ended up writing a &#39;bash the belief system&#39; sporking (even if they did it unintentionally).<br><br>It would be particularly hard in regards to some groups. I know people who are very, very devoted to their beliefs that ignore and/or contradict basically all science. I, personally, have a problem with many of their beliefs and I am not alone in that. I am a Christian, for what it&#39;s worth in this conversation, and I still have a problem with those beliefs. I think they make those of us who don&#39;t have a problem with thinking and science and social equality look bad. HOWEVER, that doesn&#39;t give me the right to bash them for their sincerely held beliefs. And it would be mighty hard (for me, speaking on a personal level here) to keep that in focus while sporking a fic that had severely OOC characters spouting those beliefs.<br><br>So anyway, I can understand the ban on missioning fics with a certain content. They have a great potential for causing a blow-up on the Board, which possibly outweighs the potential they have for entertainment. <br><br>All that said, I wouldn&#39;t be adamantly opposed to lifting the ban, but possibly with the caveat that perhaps a PG should be in on the beta process for any fic that falls into that category. (Sorry, I know, volunteering you all for more work.)</p>

            <p>I basically feel the same as Miah about this: while it should technically be possible to spork a fic like &quot;Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles&quot; without bashing the religious beliefs therein, it would be really, really hard for a lot of us, and we can see that just from following the discussion in this thread. We spork for quality, not content, so anyone going &quot;oh man, fundamentalism, ew&quot; has no business PPCing this fic any more than someone who hates slash has any business PPCing a bad slashfic.<br><br>When the religious beliefs are the entire point of the fic, I think it&#39;s safer for everyone just to stay away from it. That&#39;s not to say I think <i>any</i> fic that happens to have some religious content is untouchable, but when it&#39;s clearly a fic about someone&#39;s religion, whether it&#39;s explicitly a religious-text–fic or not, discretion is probably the better part of valor.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yeah, definitely not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. Whole bunch of stereotyping there. Calling evolution a religion, shaming girls at public schools for wanting to have careers &quot; like the women in Sex and the City&quot;, making the infamous reference to the Proverbs 31 woman... The whole thing feels closer to endorsement of fundamentalist Christianity like the Christian Patriarchy or the Quiverfull Movement. I would be surprised if Hermione there doesn&#39;t become a housewife and mother of upwards of 10 kids... I am a Christian but this thing... *shudders* <br><br>If you guys want to read a Goodfic that involves Hogwarts (regular Hogwarts) and Christians that is interestig and pretty much is never preaching,  ranting or condemning anyone, you should check out <br> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5176787/1/Thou-Shalt-Not-Suffer">Thou Shalt Not Suffer</a>.  <br><br>The main character, Michelle, is the daughter of a fundamentalist Christian couple, and of course, turns out to be a Muggle-born witch. This also of course a whole lot of conflict, not only with her parents but within herself as well, as she tries to navigate the conflicting desires of being a devout Christian and not commit the sin of witchcraft, and at the same time the one of wanting to learn her talent and about the simultaneously wondrous and terrifying world that has been reaveled to her. <br><br>Michelle is a great OC, both deeply flawed and extremely likable and also a refreshingly honest narrator. The fic also includes what is perhaps the most balanced and best portrayal of Slytherin to date. Such fairness also extends to the main two groups as well, as it purports to portray that neither all Christians are extremist nor does it condemn all wizards as inherently bad.</p>

            <p>We are all, in view of our posting here, secular. The term &#39;secular,&#39; despite its common misuse in an increasingly polarized media, does not generally refer to people. It&#39;s more of a term that describes cultural happenings - holidays, concerts, meetings, for example. Christmas is a great example because it&#39;s got both sides - the secular, which is along the lines of Santa Clause, songs like &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and &quot;Suzy Snowflake,&quot; and so on - and then there&#39;s the sacred (which is the opposite meaning of &#39;secular&#39;) side: the season of Advent, the stories of Christ&#39;s birth, songs like &quot;Joy to the World&quot; and &quot;The First Noel.&quot; I personally dislike the secular holiday immensely, mainly because I used to work retail. *shudder* Many people observe the secular side of the holiday, but see no point in keeping the religious holiday - which, too, is fine. Some people would like to separate the two, leading to the immensely irritating media bone of &quot;War on Christmas,&quot; which... well, that&#39;s another rant for another day. (Another example, fwiw, would be Halloween. Secular entirely to me, and probably to most people, but quite sacred to many pagans as Samhain.)<br><br>Anyway! You can be both secular and sacred. For the past many-thousand years, at least, humans have done both. Worshipped at temples and pyramids, then gone out into the market to hawk their wares. Put out all their fires and watched the great temple-pyramid in reverent silence at sunrise, then three days later continues their lives. Etc. </p>

            <p>Rule 1 of this battle: Write what is funny or otherwise advances your story<br><br>But for a scientific background:<br><br>As hS has mentioned, waves in a solid medium can be of three types (well actually more than three but for real earthquakes there&#39;s the three he&#39;s mentioned), all of which can exhibit interference. Technically, none of these is a true shock wave (which is basically a near-instantaneous change in the properties of a fluid and is non-linear). A linear wave, such as most we encounter in daily life, can be modelled using the principle of superposition- ie the effect of mixing the two waves is the (vector) summation of the two waves, with the magnitude, frequency and phase of the wave determining the sum.<br><br>I&#39;m not up to speed with Pokemon, so unsure whether these powers are a single pulse of energy or whether it&#39;s something more persistent. <br><br>If it&#39;s pulses, their frequency content is broadband (they don&#39;t have a characteristic frequency) and only the magnitude and length of pulse matters. Depending on where you are on the waveform you&#39;d get firstly reinforcement where the positive parts add, then (if the pulses are different duration) destructive interference, then finally (negative) reinforcement.  In general terms where the pulses meet you end up with the two powers most likely combining unless one power is a slower,  more spread-out burst of energy in which case the magnitude would be lower. <br><br>If they&#39;re waves (ie repeating waveforms) they will interfere, either constructively (171%) or destructively (29%) depending on where within the cycle the waves are when they meet. The effect will be a spatially-varying waveform so the damage will range from 29-171 if the combatants move slightly. <br><br>All this assumes that the waves are pure waveforms in coherent phase so that interference can occur. This is actually pretty rare in real life - more often &quot;real&quot; waves are in random phase relationships and add incoherently, which is just adding the energy of the waveforms together (energy is proportional to the amplitude squared so any positive or negative amplitude differences don&#39;t cancel when adding energy. Adding energetically results in the combined waveform being (on average) 122%.<br><br>Tl;dr version: you&#39;re most likely to get spatial/temporal variations in the damage from 29% to 171% as the combatants move and fire their powers at different times. As a story mechanic this could be interesting by basically including a randomised &quot;critical hit&quot; variability to the damage. It would be difficult/impossible to time the powers so that damage I&#39;d always minimised/maximised. <br><br>Elcalion,  acoustic engineer by day </p>

            <p>in a shockwave, one particle is thrown forward by the force and hits another particle, which is also thrown forwards. when two particles hit each other, they will push each other in different directions, like a reverse tug of war. cancel out, I think. in real earthquakes, when two earthquakes collide, this is what happens: one cancels out the other. however, where they meet, the land is jolted about more than usual. </p>

            <p>The way I&#39;m arriving at that answer is by considering the other two options. &#39;Earth-waves&#39; are like sound waves, in that they&#39;re longitudinal - at least, I hope so! I suppose they could be transverse... anyway. That means they can interfere either constructively or destructively - a 171% outcome or a 29% outcome.<br><br>Now, in the pass-through option, either makes sense. You either get a massive peak in the middle, or a deceptive low zone. No problem there.<br><br>But what about the other option? If they destructively interfere, you&#39;d get zero Magnitude and 29% Earthquake. But if they <i>constructively</i> interfere? Your description would have the Earthquake coming out at 171%, and the Magnitude vanishing. In effect, you&#39;d be asking the Earthquake to reflect the Magnitude, which... doesn&#39;t seem plausible.<br><br>Another way of looking at it: if they are longitudinal waves, then they <i>are</i> sound waves - just through a solid, not a liquid.<br><br>~<br><br>Further checking reveals that earthquakes actually feature three sorts of waves: longitudinal P-waves, transverse S-waves, and surface waves, ie ripples.  The P-waves travel roughly twice as fast as the S-waves, but those are still km/s measurements - for your purposes, they&#39;re instantaneous. Still, as far as I&#39;m aware, transverse waves exhibit the same interference patterns as longitudinal. If you&#39;re really interested in showing minutae, you could have one set cancel, the other magnify,  so the earth stops trembling but suddenly jolts massively up and down.<br><br>And of course, as I said, this is instantaneous. So they &#39;meet&#39; everywhere between the two Pokemon, and indeed all around them. This does suggest you could use a well-tuned Magnitude to protect you from the effects of Earthquake... or maybe the waves just propagate slower there. Though they shouldn&#39;t.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The P, S and surface (Rayleigh) waves all have their own speed of propagation and decay at different rates (partly due to p and s waves being able to propagate in 3 dimensions while Rayleigh waves are confined to the surface.<br><br>Assuming that Earthquake and Magnitude have the same proportional mix of each wave type (differing only in magnitude and phase) you&#39;ll get the superposition of three interference patterns (one for each wave type) with a complicated amplitude relationship ranging from full destructive interference to full constructive. If the Pokemon are moving during this battle or firing their powers at different rates it only makes it more complicated. <br><br>All this suggests that (based on physics at least) the cumulative effect of the two powers will be different at each combatant and will be so complicated that it will look like a randomiser on the damage between 29 and 171%<br><br>Which is also an interesting story mechanic.<br><br>Yay for physics!<br></p>

            <p>Eariler today, I was looking up fanfiction for my favorite pairings. I&#39;m a fan of the new Teenage Muntant Ninja Turtles Cartoon and liked the ship tease of Leo/Karai so naturally I looked up the pairing.To my abousolte horror I found more than one fic with warnings for sexual content. This leads me too my next question. Did you ever come across a fanfic that made you want to reach for the brain bleach just by reading the summary.</p>

            <p>At one point I was looking up Homestuck badfics in an effort to find out which ones were the worst and most prevalent. So I find this fic on AO3 that&#39;s got all the weirdest tags; mpreg, eggpreg, egg laying, etcetera, etcetera, and so forth. So, in a fit of absolute brilliance, I decided I was going to read it.<br><br>Yeah, no.<br><br>I&#39;ve never wished so hard that bleeprin was real, and about two thirds of the way through I had to take a break to go get some vinegar because my stomach was revolting so hard. But I read it all the way to the end, and I know that I will never ever forget that Homestuck is a thing, if only because of that fic, because it was seared into my memory with a branding iron fresh from a fire the temperature of a dying sun. Eerghu.<br><br>afahvhobna.<br><br>And then there&#39;s Thirty Hs, but I&#39;m not sure anyone even needs to mention that one. I made my friend almost cry just by summarizing the first three chapters to him. (I was trying to prove that badfic really is &quot;that bad.&quot; Did I hit him too hard?) I really did cry when I got to chapter eight.</p>

            <p>Look what I found while wiki walking on Tv Tropes:  <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MagicalDiary?from=Main.MagicalDiary">Magical Diary</a>, a VN about a girl who suddenly finds that she is a witch and has choose wether or not she wants to go a magic school caled <br>Iris Academy. <br><br>They are several similarities to HP-verse, specially to fanfics: you got animal-themed houses where you are sorted by personality, a seemingly normal, Muggle girl who turns out to be a witch (here termed a Wildseed), who is sort of parody of Sues and who default (insert here name) is Mary Sue... <br><br>They are interesting differences though. The magical society in this much more authoritarian and the Secrecy Statute is enforced via Laser-guded Amnesia ( just read the non-spoiler entries on Wildseed families to see what I mean), magical classes are different (black magic for example is no more evil than any other color-coded magic and is closer to alchemy, and is of course taugh by a Draco in leather pants!Snape parody...  )  <br><br>It is also of course a Ren&#39;ai (romance) VN, and an Otome (girl&#39;s love) at that. Since wizards and witches can be anywhere on the sexual spectrum on this &#39;verse, there are of course lots of paths and options. <br><br>overall, I think this would be a nice Hogwarts-like, but somewhat darker experience for both us HP fans and for any PCC-cer who might wanna try it since it is not really fandom specific. What do you guys think?      </p>

            <p>Very brief, I have about ten minutes... (which is why no Terri this time; also because you&#39;ve said to Nesh that it&#39;s not complete)<br><br>Unfortunately, the negatives that Terri highlighted in <i>Arrow</i> are still here - in fact, they&#39;re magnified. One reason I&#39;ve always disliked missions taking place in TARDISes is because they completely separate the agents from the action. And, uh... okay, it turns out that they <i>weren&#39;t</i> in their TARDIS? Then why are all the quotes in [square brackets] like they&#39;re coming from a computer screen? And, more importantly, why don&#39;t the agents interact, like, at all? Yes, Ceka goes and pesters the Doctor, but other than that, this reads like an MST, not a mission.<br><br>You&#39;ve tried to paraphrase parts of the action, but you&#39;ve run into two stumbling blocks: you&#39;ve still got way too much direct quoting, and you&#39;re not really being selective about either. Yes, every direct quote got a reply, but... how many times do you need to say &#39;No respectable Time Lord would say that&#39;?<br><br>I think I can probably stop here. My main issue is that the agents don&#39;t interact with the world around them, um, pretty much at all, except when you write little set pieces (Ceka talks to the Doctor, the agents sneak into the gym). I also have no idea why Ceka is a Time Lord - or why she&#39;s even there. Two agents would have been plenty, and would have let you flesh out Silver and Anna&#39;s characters further.<br><br>Oh, and something I go on about a lot: no-one&#39;s going to read a half-page block-paragraph charge list. Break it up with interruptions by other characters, or trim it down to bare essentials, but that sort of thing is too long. (And yes, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1-s7LIQsH6vWklzYLPriCMYS5CWQDIsUdtRXJ5qHdgCM">I have a few of my own floating around</a>).<br><br>If you&#39;d like me to go through and dissect <i>TLT</i> in more detail, I can try, but right now, my time&#39;s up.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If I were suggesting how to improve this mission, my number one recommendation would be: work aggressively in Third Person Limited.<br><br>You&#39;ve come close to this. Most of the story, we seem to be sitting solidly on Silver&#39;s shoulder - but occasionally we wander off. You&#39;re halfway between Limited and Omniscient, and it drags the story down.<br><br>So make it strictly Limited. That means: anything Silver doesn&#39;t know, <i>we</i> don&#39;t know. If you have thoughts written in - &#39;This was it. Ceka shows her true colors.&#39; - they can only be Silver&#39;s. If someone is away from Silver - such as Ceka immediately before that line - we don&#39;t find out what they were up to unless they tell Silver.<br><br>And the flip side of that is, we delve significantly deeper into Silver&#39;s mind. You&#39;ve added a subplot about Silver hating (and fearing) new things, but it makes almost no impact. In aggressive Third Person Limited, we can see all the times Silver glares at Ceka, or thinks she&#39;s untrustworthy. And through Silver&#39;s eyes, we can see her gradually come to trust Ceka. At the moment, she suddenly trusts her out of nowhere; we should have seen that building through the entire mission.<br><br>To show you what I mean, I&#39;ll throw up an example of &#39;strict Third Person Limited&#39; for the Ceka-bothers-the-Doctor scene. Please don&#39;t use this; it&#39;s just intended to show what I&#39;m talking about. Based on your text, of course.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Anna broke down in sobs, pulling Silver’s attention away from the cringeworthy ‘interactions’ of the Doctor with the unoriginal characters. She patted Anna on the back, trying to comfort her, but not getting very far: how could she, when she was in need of comfort herself?<br><br>Anna was still sniffling when the class ended. Flier and Angel went… somewhere, the fic wasn’t at all clear.<br><br>“It will be all right,” Ceka said to Anna, sounding distracted – as if she were planning something. Silver looked up, and her suspicions were confirmed: the Time Lady was already sprinting away towards the school door.<br><br>“Running off again,” Silver said in a low voice. “Do you know if we’ve got a way to contact the DIA on short notice? I’ve a feeling we might need them.”<br><br>Anna lifted her head from her knees and gave Silver a surprisingly sceptical look. “You know she’s just trying to finish the mission, right?”<br><br>“After all those protests about not wanting to write charge lists?” Silver countered. “She’s up so something. We should never have brought a Time Lord into a mission with others of her species; she’s probably plotting to take over HQ with them.”<br><br>“There’s humans in the story, too,” Anna pointed out. “Are <i>we</i> planning world domination?”<br><br>“That’s different,” Silver objected. “She-“<br><br>There was a rush of footsteps, and Ceka lunged around the corner of the building. She dove beneath the window, and Silver jolted to her feet, hand on the hilt of her dagger.<br><br>“Where did you go?” she spat, eyes blazing. This was it – time for Ceka to show her true colours.<br><br>The Time Lady stopped dead, taking a deep breath, and then that eerie calm descended on her features again. “Oh, I was just checking up on the Doctor,” she said, her voice much too casual. “It seems that he is possessed when the Twins are around.”<br><br>“The Twins of Doom,” Anna muttered, climbing to her feet and wiping her eyes. She shot a look at Silver – <i>I told you so.</i><br><br>Silver was less than convinced. She was hardly going to <i>admit</i> to helping the Twins, was she? “Don’t run off again,” she growled, glaring at Ceka – who returned the look, with interest.<br><br>Anna’s voice suddenly broke the silence. “Character bios incoming.”<br><br>Silver had no time to react. The bios pummelled at her ears, an aural assault that forced her to her knees, and it was no consolation that Ceka was suffering just as much.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>As you can see, I&#39;ve completely removed Ceka&#39;s excursion - we&#39;re sitting on Silver&#39;s shoulder here. I&#39;ve also done my best to eliminate things happening to <i>them</i> - instead, our Limited viewpoint sees them happening to Silver, <i>and</i> to the others. Since Anna&#39;s behind her, she actually doesn&#39;t notice that she&#39;s gone down as well at the end - only Ceka, who she&#39;s facing.<br><br>My rule has been to try and have a Silver-perspective in every single paragraph. Sometimes it&#39;s because she&#39;s the one speaking, of course. But other times - the description of Ceka&#39;s demeanour as &#39;eerie calm&#39; and &#39;much too casual&#39; - her impressions colour the narrative. Sometimes it&#39;s even more subtle than that - &#39;Anna&#39;s voice broke the silence&#39;, rather than &#39;Anna&#39;, because the silence is in Silver&#39;s ears, and she&#39;s not paying attention to Anna right then. So what she notices is the voice.<br><br>This can be hard. It&#39;s much easier to just slip into reporting the bare essentials - lines of dialogue traded back and forth. But that pushes you ever closer to MST style. I&#39;m not saying Silver should colour <i>every</i> line - but she should be doing so more often than not.<br><br>(I&#39;ve gone with Silver because, like I said, you&#39;re most of the way there anyway. But this story would be equally interesting from Ceka&#39;s shoulder - trying to befriend someone who&#39;s irrationally suspicious of you - or Anna&#39;s - trying to make Silver see reason about Ceka, who&#39;s actually quite nice)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>to ask a follow-up question. When writing a &#39;fic, if you decide to use a different POV style, does that mean that you <i>have</i> to rework the rest of the story? Obviously that would be the ideal, but the question is whether it would be obligatory.<br><br>Here&#39;s what I mean: I believe that like Tigeress&#39;s mission, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9697398/1/The-Vexos-Chronicles-Part-I-Lost-Luster">the crossover that I am working on</a> is somewhere in between Third Person Limited and Third Person Omniscient (albeit leaning more towards Limited). I&#39;m now thirteen chapters into my fic. If I were to come to the conclusion that a strict Third Person Limited style would work best, does that mean that I&#39;d now need to rework the previous thirteen chapters?<br><br>P.S.: If you are so inclined, how would a scene from my crossover look like in strict Third Person Limited (Volt&#39;s POV, please)?</p>

            <p>Your last three or more chapters don&#39;t <i>include</i> Volt. You&#39;d be looking at, uh, Third Person Multiple Limited (?) or something - TPL, but with the viewpoint character changing from scene to scene. That&#39;s different from TPO, where the viewpoint shifts <i>within</i> a scene.<br><br>And I think you&#39;re already in TPML, honestly. Take Chapter 11: it&#39;s pretty much all from Keith&#39;s viewpoint. People are described relative to Keith (&#39;Standing by Keith&#39;s side&#39;, &#39;He was Keith&#39;s best friend&#39;), we don&#39;t see things he doesn&#39;t (&#39;Keith did not have to turn around to tell&#39;), other people&#39;s actions are related only as Keith notices them (&#39;He looked down at his sister, whose eyes were starting to well up with tears&#39;), and if he doesn&#39;t know something for sure, neither do we (&#39;her expression seemed to tell that she knew something about it&#39;). So switching to TPL with just one character would simply mean not using the others any more, not a change of style.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, to be honest, I <i>was</i> trying to keep the story from Volt&#39;s perspective during the chapters that take place in Kanto. It appears that I was more successful than I thought.<br><br>As for the other chapters (i.e. 11,12, and 13), even though it started from Keith&#39;s point of view, I think it transitions more into Third Person Omniscient, especially after the <i>Destroyer</i> lands on Vestal. Then again, I&#39;m not that concerned about the chapters that take place on Vestal; those can stay in Third Person Omniscient.<br><br>However, come to think about it, I am <i>not</i> trying to stay solely in Volt&#39;s perspective throughout the story. You&#39;ll see what I mean once Chapter 14 comes out. I was more concerned about a) not switching between Limited and Omniscient when I wasn&#39;t planning on doing so, and b) finding ways to better my storytelling.<br><br>Thanks for the advice!</p>

            <p>Um.  I don&#39;t have time for a full beta reading, either, but there were some things I want to bring up about the mission&#39;s current form that need to be worked on.  (I couldn&#39;t do a proper beta anyway, as I&#39;ve only seen a few Ninth Doctor episodes.  Hey, Slitheen!  Nice to see you guys again.  Nice to actually recognize something out of a <i>Doctor Who</i> mission for once.)<br><br>The one big issue right now is this extremely forced animosity between Silver and Ceka.  It&#39;s completely distracting throughout the entire mission, and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any reason for it, except to have conflict for conflict&#39;s sake.  I&#39;m fine with agents not getting along well all the time, as the PPC isn&#39;t a children&#39;s TV show.  But Silver&#39;s . . . Time Lord racism?  I don&#39;t know what to call it.  Silver&#39;s racism gets thrown at us out of nowhere in the beginning—nothing in the previous mission suggested Silver had anything against Gallifreyans.  She doesn&#39;t display the same level of distaste towards the Doctor later, or even to the Sues.  Heck, she even goes along with recruiting the Flier at the end without a word of complaint, so what is it that makes her dislike Ceka specifically?  And there&#39;s no resolution to it, either; we&#39;re just told at the end that &quot;her prejudice [is] finally gone.&quot;  But this just makes it more illogical, because we never knew why that prejudice existed in the first place, or why it has suddenly disappeared.  The agents&#39; collective actions during the mission also contradict that there is any conflict between them, as on two occasions (neuralyzing the gym and returning the Doctor to the TARDIS) Anna leaves Silver and Ceka alone together, with no sign of enmity between them during those periods.  If Silver disliked Ceka so, wouldn&#39;t she volunteer to do those things, to get away from Ceka?<br><br>Perhaps the answer there lies with the suspicion in the beginning that Ceka might have been trying to help the Sues.  But that leads to another contradiction, because if Ceka, an established, if newbie, agent was untrustworthy, why would Silver (again) go along with recruiting the Flier, an actual Sue?  At the end of the day, it feels like you&#39;ve written Silver to be mean to a new character for the sake of giving the agents something to do during the mission, then magically removed that conflict at the end when it was no longer convenient.  Honestly, it doesn&#39;t work; take away the Time Lord hate, and all the agents have left in their part of the story is commenting on what the badfic does and performing the motions of observe-neuralyze-assassinate.  The actual badfic sequences are far more entertaining than what the agents are doing.<br><br>I realize this all sounds extremely negative, but that&#39;s partly because I&#39;m reacting to an unfinished product that got posted too early.  My goal here is only to point out a major narrative error so you can retool it in the next draft.  Give your agents personalities: not just contextless, baseline traits like &quot;hates Gallifreyans&quot; (though again, I&#39;m still not clear that is Silver&#39;s problem), but full viewpoints and opinions that can play off of each other and whatever&#39;s happening around them.  That will lead to much better dialogue and a much better reading experience overall.</p>

            <p>I actually don&#39;t have a beta-reader right now, (looking for one) so... probably why.<br>Thank you for your criticism!

            <p>Maybe try working some shyness into her behavior at the start?  Although it might be tricky to have both shyness and the antagonism you were leaning towards here.  It&#39;s an interesting idea, though.  I wonder how Silver will react if they get sent to a canon her partner knows, but she doesn&#39;t?</p>

<li>Remember that writing is first and foremost something that you do because you want to. It&#39;s very, very nice if it ends up pleasing others, but if that&#39;s the <i>only</i> reason you&#39;re doing it, 90% of the process is not going to be much fun. Writing is hard work and takes a lot of time, so make sure you&#39;re doing it because you enjoy it. If that&#39;s not the case, then yeah, you might want to give it up and find a hobby that actually makes you happy.<br><br>2. Assuming that you&#39;re writing this story because you love the idea and you&#39;re excited to create something with it: You can please some of the people some of the time, but you can never please all the people all the time. There will always be someone who disagrees with you or doesn&#39;t like what you&#39;re doing, but don&#39;t let them make you forget about the people who like it—including yourself.<br><br>3. Getting negative reviews sucks, but it never hurts to think earnestly about what they have to say. In this case, <i>can</i> you make your story more original and more funny going forward? If so, do it! Always push to make your work better than it was before, and remember that you can&#39;t make that happen by quitting.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>A lot of writers, and artists in general, are insecure about their abilities. To some degree, this is a good thing: it can push you to take steps to make sure you don&#39;t screw up for stupid reasons like failing to do the research, use a beta-reader, or double-check the meaning of that unusual word you just used. There&#39;s a good saying that goes roughly like this: the minute you think you&#39;re done improving is the minute you start to suck.<br><br>Of course, it can also be really discouraging. One way to avoid letting self-doubt hold you back is to choose very carefully whose opinions you put stock in. Personally, my ranking goes something like this:<br><br>1. Concrit from people I don&#39;t know. (Not likely to be biased.)<br>2. Concrit from friends and family. (Probably biased, but those who know me best know that I value honesty over flattery.)<br>3. My own judgement. (I am often my own harshest critic, so I trust others more than myself to tell me when I&#39;ve done well.)<br>4. Exclusively negative comments from anyone. (Not pleasant, but can still be used to find areas to improve as long as they&#39;re more than mindless flames.)<br>5. Exclusively positive comments from anyone. (Nice to hear, but unreasoned &quot;This is so awesome!&quot; type comments are completely useless and, IMO, more insulting than flames.)<br><br>Hope that helps. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I assume the first two reviews, the guest ones, were your self<br>flamer reviews for story purposes, right? <br><br>It seems you got a couple of new bad reviews, one for each chapter.  The content is already bad enough, but that not even my real concern. The author of both of them - Michelle the Editor - that&#39;s Thantosiet&#39;s fanfiction.net profile.   <br><br>Now, those were post after you posted this thread, so I have to ask.

            <p>I&#39;ve always been bad at conveying my emotions properly through text, particularly when it comes to snark, or when I can&#39;t go back and edit my words. What I was trying to say was that you managed to create a parody Sue that was believable enough to be good, but still over-the-top enough to be fun to read. The part I liked most was how you managed to swing to the opposite extreme of Suefics from My Immortal. Where that fic was crude, &quot;goffik&quot; and abrupt, full of horrible spelling and author&#39;s notes, yours tilted towards purple prose, extreme niceness and fluffiness and run-ons. Just the kind of thing someone who knows the vague symptoms of a Sue, but not the underlying problem, would do to &quot;fix&quot; a story like My Immortal. It&#39;s already my favorite parody of that story.<br><br>Again, I am so sorry I bungled my words badly enough to seem like I disliked your story, because the whole reason I went to review them was because I thought it deserved more positive ones.</p>

            <p>No, I don&#39;t they ever were. You conveyed it pretty well to LonelyStar herself, and that is what matters. <br><br>Well, yes I guess parody flames would be wanted. I don&#39;t know if you saw the first post the thread or not, but LonelyStar actually flamed herself for plot purposes. Those two &quot;guest&quot; reviews were the ones she responded to in Chapter 2. I take it this is one of them: &quot;Ivory is a self-righteous bitch. And hypocritical, too: She&#39;s wearing a SEE THROUGH dress. And, BTW, you said that the sun was one- fourth through its daily revolution. That would mean that it was 6:00 A.M.

            <p>Of course, it is generally not good practice to leave anon reviews in the first place. In this case it was needed because, well, she couldn&#39;t very well flame herself under her own name.

I guess you should take Neshomeh&#39;s advice to heart. Those are clearly on the exclusively negative category, and if you genuinely think that the story is neither unoriginal nor unfunny, which in my opinion you would be correctly assuming so, then there is nothing good that can be taken from it.

            <p>The more, the merrier? Do you want to show some of your writing too?<br><br>I totally get you on the novel part as well. I had my first original fiction idea about 6 years ago. While I did sort of complete a book, I will have to be honest and say it was a complete mess. I still gotta a few novel ideas and I hope I will complete them while still in.my twenties... <br><br>As for fanfic, I have to a Harry Potter OC cooking up, the first chapter of should be up for betaing in a couple of ...days I think?.

            <p>well, I&#39;m working on a game Idea.<br><br>problem is I intend this game to start the next big kid&#39;s franchise (think Pokemon or Power Rangers), but it is a Roleplay-FPS.

            <p>Hello everyone,<br><br>I am pleased to announce that work is underway for my first mission! Given the sheer length of the writing I&#39;ve created so far (courtesy of the unbelievable monster of a fic I&#39;m sporking), I&#39;ve been advised by my betas to divide it into multiple parts, so I&#39;ve split up the writing so far into &quot;acts&quot;. The Pre-Mission and Acts 1-3 have been completed, and I thought I&#39;d show them on the Board for your enjoyment.<br>Based on my readings within the Board, I&#39;m also uploading the prologue I published for my current Agent pair. My RC number is #227.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VaQoKHdhMvN5S0I8hZX5uY1M8LGBLdd2iOyVgthV-30/edit?usp=sharing">Prologue: A Wild Skarmory Appeared!</a> (completed on September 6)<br><br><b>Mission 1: Connecting The Dots</b> (In progress)<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Sj_VpYzdbYNcsfLA7C1ylDYRpbjh55Ii-PhEwifOg4/edit?usp=sharing">Pre-Mission</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VfzKnlfUSpPz1WGphZqbPTUa1KBWdnlFlXxu45C68Tk/edit?usp=sharing">Act 1</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnKMY2E63l_BZmLye5t7s_cy-ZIhDle27dlGSCaOJVM/edit?usp=sharing">Act 2</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CGcoSXASpsQabWOXSettL2ACGKs5eoy6TBm5NHXz8W8/edit?usp=sharing">Act 3</a><br><br>As an aside, I&#39;ve settled on a good name for my Sphinx Agent: Rashida Mafdetiti. I had to change the spelling of the first name, as Rasheeda is Muslim for &quot;Conscious&quot; but Rashida is Egyptian for &quot;Righteous&quot;, which suits her better. Her name now means &quot;The Righteous one [for whom] Mafdet has come&quot;, which suits her pretty well, I think.<br><br>My writing will be a bit slow due to research and all that, but Acts 4-6 and the post-mission are in progress and will be delivered to my betas for perusal, I promise. Take care!<br><br>-SS</p>

            <p>My thoughts- firstly, formatting. I suggest having an extra line between paragraphs. Even though you indented, you still ended up forming a but of a text wall. <br><br>Secondly, Rashida. I love how you included so much insight into her thought process and yet still left her past unclear. Makes things more exciting, it does. ;) <br><br>Thirdly, the Pokémon battle. I was laughing my stomach sore the whole time I was reading it, especially the bits involving the battle narration.<br><br>All in all, a very good start, and I will leave more thoughts as I read!</p>

            <p>The only complaint I really have is the lack of space between paragraphs. And considering you couldn&#39;t have had time to change that (if at all) I guess I have nothing negative to say.<br><br>On to the good things!<br><br>The Sar-Plasm was a very nice touch, and it seemed fitting for Rashida. Though I do have to ask... how does a Skarmory know how to work a shower? I can&#39;t imagine Falchion ever had reason to learn in the past. Still, it made for an amusing image when he fell in. And where exactly was the shower located in relation to the rest of the RC? I got the sense that it was out in the open, which seems quite a bit odd.<br><br>Anyway, just from reading Rashida&#39;s description of the fic I can tell your agents are going to be in for quite a ride! I&#39;m interested to see what significance Falchion&#39;s Shiny Bauble will have, too.</p>

            <p>I just e-mailed the most current drafts of Acts 1-3 to you for your perusal. Enjoy!<br><br>As an aside, I&#39;ve fixed up some things pointed out in the replies to the original post. Mr. Incrediebell is no more, and instead I&#39;ve modified the writing so that helen is identified as the first mini-Omnidroid. I&#39;ve also retconned the Ominous Red, and since I didn&#39;t want to get rid of mention of a new Suvian color entirely, I decided to substitute another one. From Act 2, Page 5:<br><br><i>[Rashida:] “There’s <b>an eery glow from the corner of the basement</b>.”<br>[Falchion:] “An eery glow?” I asked.<br>[Rashida:] “Yeah,” I muttered, cringing as we tried not to stare at the glow – its color wasn’t directly specified but to us, it was a disturbing shade of red that apparently instilled viewers with overwhelming dread...</i></p>

            <p>It&#39;s unusual for a PPCer to tackle such a huge fic for his first mission, but I must admit that you&#39;ve done so quite admirably. This mission could easily have been penned by a more experienced Boarder. You&#39;ve gotten me interested in the story, and you demonstrate Rashida&#39;s and Falchion&#39;s personalities quite well.<br><br>A few things, though:<br>1) The mini &quot;Mr. Incrediebell&quot;: I do not think that this counts as a mini. In context, it is clear that in-fic!Megamind got the name wrong but did not care to find out if he was indeed amiss. In other words, the authors <i>meant</i> for it to be misspelled.<br><br>Of course, I would welcome it if an Oldbie would give his or her two cents on this.<br><br>2) Ominous Red: I do not think that this should be a Sue color. Though a comma <i>would</i> have been useful, I think that the sentence is perfectly grammatical as is: it&#39;s pretty clear that in the phrase &quot;glowed with an ominous red aura,&quot; both &quot;ominous&quot; and &quot;red&quot; modify &quot;aura.&quot; I know that we at the PPC love to find humor wherever we can is, but this seems like creating an issue where there is none in my opinion.<br><br>3)<i>“Called it,” I grinned smugly as I watched Donkey Kong introduce himself…<i><br><br>That comma should be a period, or else the verb should change; one cannot &quot;grin&quot; a quote. If you want a facial expression tied to the quote, consider something like this: <i>&quot;Called it,&quot; I said with a smug grin on my face as I watched Donkey Kong introduce himself…&quot;<br><br>Either way, good work so far, and I&#39;ll be looking forward to the rest of the mission.</i></i></i></p>

            <p>1.) *Facetalon of D&#39;oh!* In hindsight, I should&#39;ve known that Megamind&#39;s mispronounciation was canon. I&#39;ll wait on additional feedback for that, though, since Mr. Incrediebell was the first mini I found on the mission and our first Incredibles mini as well, and I&#39;m a bit reluctant to retcon it out of existence because it may uproot quite a few minor details in the story.<br><br>2.) Yeah, the Ominous Red sounded a bit forced in hindsight. I WAS wondering if there was a Suvian color tucked in the fic somewhere, and I was hoping this was it, but I may end up having to retcon that particular part. I do have to wonder, though, are there any Suvian shades of red that can be substituted?<br><br>3.) I&#39;ll fix that ASAP. Thanks!<br><br>P.S. Is anyone interested in creating a page about The Incredibles continuum on the Wiki? I was tempted to but I&#39;ll hold out in case someone else knows about Incredibles badfic and related subjects better than I do...</p>

            <p>From &quot;My Immortal: An Investigation&quot;, the author posits that all the misspelled names are relatives/friends/just have a similar name to the characters, and are being pulled into the story so that the originals don&#39;t have to show up.<br><br>Given that the fanfic analyzed was My Immortal, it reads like a free-for-all with everyone trying to get out of the story, and then getting dragged back when their names are used again. It&#39;s quite funny. <br><br>The writer also gives each misnamed character their own personalities and backstories. Frankly, it&#39;s much better than the source material (although that isn&#39;t too hard).</p>

            <p>Well, to be fair, the originators of the PPC <i>were</i> American, so you&#39;ll find that we PPCers are mostly American, though there is the occasional Brit (e.g., hS, Cyba Zero), as well as people of other nationalities.

            <p>Yeah, filters tend to be pretty random about what they do or don&#39;t block. The Board often slips by due to not being one of the obvious social networks or forums, but it&#39;s impossible to predict.<br><br>So, what brings you to these parts?

            <p>So it seems we haven&#39;t done this since - brace yourselves - May <i>2011</i>. That&#39;s terrible.<br><br>This is <b>Fill the Plotholes</b>. It&#39;s the oldest PPC game; it&#39;s been going since before I joined; and it is <i>awesome fun</i>.<br><br>How it works is this: I list a bunch of summaries, riddled with the plotholes that usually infest summaries. You pick one of these summaries and write a story that fills those plotholes. It can be an interpretation that makes the story actually good, or it can be satire which draws out every single error and implausibility.<br><br>This does not (normally) involve PPC agents, though they&#39;re not strictly forbidden. Nor does it involve reading the actual story - some of these look like they might be quite good, but the summaries are plotholicious. No, you don&#39;t need Permission. Yes, multiple people can do the same summary. No, there&#39;s no need to &#39;reserve&#39; a summary; just write it and post it. (No, you don&#39;t need a beta, and no, it doesn&#39;t need to be very long. This is a <i>fun game</i>)<br><br>For this round, I&#39;ve chosen summaries from the Great Trifecta of PPC traditional canons: <i>The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter,</i> and <i>Discworld</i>. All summaries are taken from the first page of the relevant category on Fanfiction.net. Enter at your peril...<br><br><u>The Lord of the Rings</u><br><br>1/ <i>Struck by an Arrow</i><br><br>WARNING: Legomance, but no tenth-walker and all that jazz... Story of a girl who&#39;s struck by lightning and transferred to Mirkwood, stumbling upon some of the most fearsome elves in all of Middle Earth. How will she explain what happened to the Elvenking? Or to herself? Sorry, the summary isn&#39;t great, but PLEASE give my story a try! Thank you! :)<br><br>2/ <i>Children of Vána and Oromë</i><br><br>Lara and Jack are the Children of two of the Valar. They are destined to meet their fate in Middle-Earth, not in England. When one night, Nienna, the mourner of the Valar is sent to inform them of their fate, taking them over the bridge with her. They end up in Arda and are changed, they find their fate but they face some difficulties. Proudly Slash Free.<br><br>3/ <i>The Daughter of Elrond</i><br><br>The Ring has been stolen and a daughter of Elrond is missing. Rated T for possible language.<br><br>4/ <i>The Morning Star</i><br><br>During the war of the ring, the woodland realm lives troubled times. Between war and fear appears a child that might change the course of what would seem like a predictable tale.<br><br>5/ <i>Side by side with his dwarf</i><br><br>Legolas and Gimli are great friends but Aragorn knows that they are more than that he just needs to make them realise it.<br><br><u>Harry Potter</u><br><br>6/ <i>Destiny Flame</i><br><br>Abandoned by his family for having a darkness clinging to him, Harry jumps at the chance to go to Hogwarts. Unfortunately the twin that his parents favoured over him spreads rumours about his darkness, saying that they had abandoned him for a perfectly good reason. Struggling through a world where almost no one likes him, Harry manages to become something great. Eventually.<br><br>7/ <i>A Father&#39;s Love</i><br><br>Abraxas and Lucius get sent back in time thanks thnaks to a potion, while they are there they try and find Harry, also both of then look like they are 15 and 17 years old, this story and some of the characters are from my idea of what happened after deathly hallows ended. If I said anymore I would give away the story, so if you want to find out what happens plz R&amp;R :)<br><br>8/ <i>Elemental Girls at Hogwarts</i><br><br>When 4 new students going by the names of; Summer Flame, Rosely Forest, Sky Thundercloud and Icey Tsunami enter Hogwarts as 2nd years. They have to defeat old Villains and deal with Love. Will their secret be found out and who will fall for who?<br><br>9/ <i>Worth It (if you stick around)</i><br><br>It&#39;s possible to be such a critic that you lose sight of what could possibly keep you. It&#39;s a good thing his heart is made of brave scarlet, or he would never go searching for clarity. A story in which life just happens.<br><br>10/ <i>One Year</i><br><br>Robbie was scared, he was nervous. Leaving America to head to England to go to Hogwarts, his parents told him it would be alright. But he felt like he would be a ghost, joining Gryffindor might just change all of that. Meeting some new people and making friends might not be so scary after all, but what can one 11 year old do?<br><br><u>Discworld</u><br><br>11/ <i>Twisted In Every Way</i><br><br>12-year-old Victoria and her twin brother James are orphaned because of a freak &quot;accident&quot;. But what will &quot;dear little Victoria&quot; do to get into the guild that wants her brother as a member? Be warned, it is rather disturbing at the beginning. Please Review!<br><br>12/ <i>Zoo Tales</i><br><br>Posibly the beginning of a new cycle set in the City Zoo. No sex except for the animals and not much swearing. Though watch where you stand...<br><br>13/ <i>The Discworld Tarot</i><br><br>NC &quot;DEATH&quot; AT chap. 15! The Tarot Pack is either a neat psychological tool, or it offers genuine portals to the world of The Other, or it&#39;s a good way for plausible bluffers like me to earn 20 quid a reading. Or it could be about Discworld characters...NOW WITH MINOR ARCANA! (building slowly but surely.)<br><br>14/ <i>The Sanest of the Bunch</i><br><br>&quot;We are the only sane ones here, aren&#39;t we?&quot; Unfortunately, the answer was yes, Toad and Jeannie were the only sane ones there.<br><br>15/ <i>Dancing Lessons</i><br><br>The Patrician is dead. Long live the Patrician. Rated for mild language.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The tortoises here in Arizona could work as a thermometer.  Too hot, or too cold?  Taking shelter.  Otherwise, tortoise sexy times.

            <p>9/ Worth It (if you stick around)<br><br>It&#39;s possible to be such a critic that you lose sight of what could possibly keep you. It&#39;s a good thing his heart is made of brave scarlet, or he would never go searching for clarity. A story in which life just happens.<br><br>There was a painting at Hogwarts that never moved, no matter how long the students might stare at it. There didn&#39;t appear to be anything remarkable about it aside from how it hung on the wall. Though it was a depiction of a heavily forested landscape, it had been placed on the wall as if it were a portrait. Altered as it was, the trees took on the appearance of scraggly green bristles on a massive brush, the rolling knolls became green pustules, and the clouded sky became a sloppy imitation of a waterfall. It was appalling.<br><br>It was no wonder that few wasted the time to observe it; however, it retained a certain amount of intrigue for the students with more artistic leanings. Dean Thomas was no exception. <br><br>&quot;Why would there be a Muggle painting at Hogwarts?&quot; he asked, pausing in front of the painting, as well as nearly causing Seamus to crash into him in the process.<br><br>&quot;Probably for the same reason you&#39;re still lolling around looking at it,&quot; Seamus snipped, irritated by his near miss. &quot;It&#39;s weird. Weird things tend to stick around Hogwarts.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fair enough, I guess.&quot; Dean continued to watch the painting, waiting for any sign that it might spring to life. He did not look as if he planned to move any time soon, much to Seamus&#39;s dismay.<br><br>&quot;I reckon that Potions will start in a few minutes,&quot; Seamus prodded.<br><br>&quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; Dean answered absently. <br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t you think we should, I don&#39;t know, actually go? I don&#39;t much like the idea of losing twenty house points.&quot; <br><br>That got Dean&#39;s attention. He snorted, turning away from the painting at last. &quot;You&#39;d lose them the first time you blew up your draught anyway,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;Oh yeah? I bet you a Galleon that I don&#39;t blow up a single thing today.&quot;<br><br>Laughing, Dean started walking to class once more. &quot;I&#39;ll take that bet. I hope you&#39;re not saving up for Hogsmeade, Finnigan. You won&#39;t have two knuts to rub together by the trip if you keep throwing your money away like this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very funny. I&#39;ll have you know that I have great odds today. Hermione told me that we aren&#39;t working with anything that reacts violently in Potions this week, modifying Cheering Charms isn&#39;t going to make anyone spontaneously combust, and I can&#39;t exactly set a transfigured mirror on fire, now can I?&quot; Seamus grinned. &quot;Just watch, I&#39;ll be flush by the end of the day.&quot;<br><br>Seamus proceeded to set a record for himself in producing four explosions in one day, only one of which was magical in nature. <br><br>[Time skip of doom and subsequent abrupt transitions because this is already longer than intended and I regret everything]<br><br>Later, Dean returned to the motionless painting. Down the hallway he could hear the clamour of students returning to their common rooms from the Great Hall. Sometimes he stayed as late as he could when it was a mealtime, but he left as quickly as possible just as often. There weren&#39;t many times when the hallways were free of students, save for the dead of night, and breaking curfew had long since lost its air of rebellion. It just felt nice to be alone sometimes.<br><br>Unaccompanied as he was, Dean had all the time he needed to observe the painting. He spent most of it tilting his head to the side. The first thing he had concluded was that it was beautiful from the correct perspective, but the way it was placed would prompt tears from its creator. He had entertained the notion of it being a sort of modern art, but had ascertained that it was much too old. <br><br>The second thing he ascertained was that it was hiding a door.<br><br>Dean had spent years living with a mother who was extremely fond of daytime telly, so he felt he was something of an aficionado regarding hidden passages and forbidden affairs. Knowing that the two were almost always intertwined, Dean found himself unwilling to open the painting door. He had no desire to see people snogging behind the painting, especially considering he was just as guilty  of liaisons behind tapestries and in passages of all sorts as any unfortunate couple he might spy.<br><br>Considering these factors, he very slowly and deliberately knocked on the wall to the left of the landscape. When no answer was forthcoming, and there was a definite absence of students rushing out of the painting, he decided to take a chance. He took one deep breath and opened the door.<br><br>&quot;Well, that&#39;s anticlimactic.&quot;<br><br>Before him lay a round, nearly bare room. The only thing adorning its walls was a single scarlet cape, embroidered with a heart, and a piece of parchment pinned to it. Upon further examination, the paper read, &quot;Thif is to fay that Gregory shalle ne&#39;er lay eye on his cloak if he e&#39;er again mocks the artes. - Professor Claerty Hathorne&quot; <br><br>[Surprise. I wrote this monstrosity to lead up to passive aggressive 16th century professor shenanigans.] <br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Interesting little tale! Nice ending, too..<br><br>Just wondering, does it ever specifically state in the books that Seamus is a pyromaniac? I can&#39;t remember reading it anywhere, yet in lots of different fanfics he seems to have that talent. Most memorably, HPatAotDMKMDL (yes, long title, be glad I abbreviated it) in which he manages to blow up a Slytherin girl&#39;s pumpkin juice from 3 table away, giving the explanation &quot;Backwash&quot; and refusing to elaborate.</p>

            <p>I had always thought it was fanon until I decided to re-read the series and have a marathon of the HP movies. I usually derive most of my information from the books, but on this rare occasion I synthesised information from both the movies and the books.<br><br>The exact quote from the movie ran along the lines of, &quot;Why don&#39;t you confer with Mr Finnigan? As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.&quot; <br><br>The book is far less dramatic in its depictions, stating that, &quot;Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it.&quot;  It was never stated whether this fire was accidental or purposeful.<br><br>I had never pictured his powers of incidental conflagration being so great that he  could accidentally set something three tables away ablaze, but that&#39;s due to my own theories. I like to imagine that half of it is inflating the inside joke, and half of it is truly an accident. In any case, his experience with fire, explosions, and the like surely served him well during the war. <br><br>(I cannot begin to decipher that fic title, but I love guessing anyway.

            <p>1/ Struck by an Arrow<br><br>WARNING: Legomance, but no tenth-walker and all that jazz... Story of a girl who&#39;s struck by lightning and transferred to Mirkwood, stumbling upon some of the most fearsome elves in all of Middle Earth. How will she explain what happened to the Elvenking? Or to herself? Sorry, the summary isn&#39;t great, but PLEASE give my story a try! Thank you! :)<br><br><br>&quot;Your king--he is a king?--well, he&#39;s probably still wrapped in vines. You shouldn&#39;t startle people, you know. <i>Especially</i> mages.&quot; Trisana Chandler plunked her fists on her hips and glared up at the tall man (one of many) in front of her. &quot;And speaking of mages--I&#39;m a mage. So you&#39;d better put me back where I came from.&quot;<br><br>No one moved. In fact, everyone stared.<br><br>&quot;Do I have something on my face?&quot;<br><br>This got them to exchange glances, at least, but she might as well have been talking to...to...to snakes. Only these people wouldn&#39;t even hiss at her.<br><br>&quot;Listen,&quot; Tris said, doing her best to keep the desperation out of her voice, &quot;if you don&#39;t send me back, I&#39;ll get angry. Really angry. You won&#39;t like what happens when I&#39;m angry.&quot;<br><br>The leader blinked at her. &quot;Do you mean to threaten us?&quot; He raised his bow until the nocked arrow pointed at her heart.<br><br>Tris&#39; voice raised in annoyance. &quot;I don&#39;t <i>mean</i> to threaten you. I don&#39;t need to. I just want you to know what you&#39;re up against.&quot; The arrow stayed where it was; the man&#39;s eyes narrowed. At least he&#39;d spoken? &quot;Stop that,&quot; Tris added, jabbing a finger at the weapon. &quot;Just put me back. Now. Before I <i>really</i> get angry.&quot;<br><br>Today had been a bad day. The lightning had definitely been fun--strong and wild and rippling hot, tasting faintly of rain--but the richly dressed man stumbling out of nowhere and proclaiming loudly that there were no tenth-walkers or jazz had been a complete surprise. He hadn&#39;t gotten himself wrapped in vines until he managed to startle Briar into ruining an entire pot of burn salve. The plant mage had wrapped him in progressively more vines in a growing attempt to keep him silent and still.<br><br>(This stand-off continued for rather a while, really. No one quite knew how to set things right. No one quite knew how to bring up Tris&#39; hair, either, which stood straight up where it wasn&#39;t braided, and crawled with seed lightning besides.)<br><br>*<br><br><i>Lightning suggested Tris to me. Very strongly, in fact. I&#39;m not sure this really came out the way I wanted it to, but it&#39;s also my first time <b>writing</b> Tris, so that probably affected it. Hope you enjoyed nonetheless...and sorry for the general lack of Legomance, I couldn&#39;t make it fit with the length. Feel free to picture it somehow working out eventually, if you&#39;d like.</i><br><br>-----<br><br>5/ Side by side with his dwarf<br><br>Legolas and Gimli are great friends but Aragorn knows that they are more than that he just needs to make them realise it.<br><br><br>&quot;I do not understand this,&quot; Legolas said once they had attained privacy. &quot;Has he taken leave of his wits? What could cause him to say such things?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Perhaps &#39;tis the stress of ruling,&quot; suggested Gimli. &quot;It weighs on him, we have seen this--&quot;<br><br>&quot;But to suggest that--!&quot; Legolas&#39; hands waved about in unusual frustration. &quot;It is not only absurd but physically impossible!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Peace, Legolas.&quot; The Dwarf waited until his friend was more collected before he spoke again. &quot;Perhaps he means it as a joke.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A joke.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye.&quot; Gimli warmed to this theme, gesticulating broadly. &quot;Grown weary with the formality of royal audiences, he has turned his mind to play. And what better way to relax than to play at convincing his friends--&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see no humor in this,&quot; Legolas protested, but Gimli shook his head.<br><br>&quot;Perhaps you need not, friend Legolas. After all, it is his own amusement that Aragorn seeks.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If this is indeed a joke,&quot; Legolas put in.<br><br>Gimli nodded reluctantly. &quot;If it is indeed a joke, and not a failing in his sanity.&quot;<br><br>For some time there was silence. At length, Legolas spoke.<br><br>&quot;We should alert the Queen, if nothing else.&quot;<br><br>Gimli&#39;s eyebrows shot upwards. &quot;And how do you propose to explain this to her, Master Elf?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We tell her what he said,&quot; Legolas replied firmly. &quot;We tell her, and we explain that we suspect a break in his sanity. Should it indeed be a joke, he will laugh all the harder; and should it be the stress of ruling, Arwen will see it and take measures to correct it. This shall be our course of action--if you agree.&quot;<br><br>Gimli thought it over, and then nodded. &quot;It seems a sensible idea. Very well--I am agreed. When shall we approach her?&quot;<br><br>&quot;At once.&quot; Legolas straightened his already-straight clothing, and turned toward the door. &quot;There is no time to lose.&quot;<br><br>Gimli nodded his agreement once more, and they left the room side by side.<br><br>What Arwen Undómiel would say to their claims of Aragorn&#39;s attempts to convince them that a Dwarf and an Elf were in fact blood brothers, neither preferred to imagine. Their only hope was that she would believe them.<br><br>*<br><br><i>Hey, it doesn&#39;t spell out what this &#39;more than that&#39; is. I&#39;m perfectly justified in claiming that Aragorn&#39;s trying to convince them that they&#39;re directly related biologically.<br><br>Your choice whether he&#39;s insane, playing a joke, or something else entirely. It&#39;s all up in the air.</i><br><br>-----<br>As a final note--please excuse or point out any OOCness. Tris was kind of hard to write, and I tried to base Gimli and Legolas mainly on the books rather than the movies.</p>

The four girls had decided to sit there together even though they were all sorted into different Houses based on their elemental-sounding names (someone&#39;s gotta be laughing about it, somewhere); after all, not many people paid too much attention to the Hufflepuff table. <br><br>&quot;Okay, and Villains?&quot; asks Summer.<br><br>&quot;Still demanding their fee,&quot; reports Icey Tsunami as she heaps eggs onto her plate.<br><br>Sky shudders. &quot;What a creep.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What choice do we have? They&#39;ve got information on us. If the Ministry finds out --&quot; Rosely begins, but Sky squeezes her hand and shakes her head. <br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t. We&#39;re going to find some way to make sure old Villains doesn&#39;t get that information to the Ministry.&quot;<br><br>Rosely briefly smiles at her girlfriend before turning back to the others. &quot;Who&#39;s going to deal with Love then?&quot; <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll do it,&quot; grumbles Summer.</i></i></p>

That <i>is</i> a mystery.

<br><br>What? They never said <i>which</i> Ring. As for the language - well, it was possible, but fortunately Celebrían restrained herself.<br><br>hS</p>

This the question this Mass Effect AU fic asks. And the answering is, differently from other AU fics (cough Alternative Realities cough), that things are profoundly changed. What alliances are formed, how Humanity comes to see the Galactic Council and whether or not they decided to join them as a Council Space race. We get to see different perspectives, such as  <br>Hannah Shepard&#39;s, Rael&#39;Zorah&#39;a and Garrus&#39;s father&#39;s.though  a large number of characters are written so as have been born several years earlier than in Canon, so that for example, Shepard and Tali can be at the center of the Human-Quarian contact. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9156000/1Mass%20Effect%202%20-%20DLC:%20The%20Equestrian%20Equation">Mass Effect 2 - DLC: The Equestrian Equation</a> - Mass Effect/My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic <br><br>One of the most interesting aspect of this story is that<br>it was sucessful and good example of an interactive fanfic.<br>At the end of each chapter the author would provide two or<br>three choices for Shepard to make in the next one. The outcome was decided by the majority of votes in the comment section. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4775548/1/Curses">Curses!</a> - Psychonauts <br><br>This story features psychic powers, Psychonaut items and Mental Worlds that would right at home in the game. <br><br>    </p>

They are primarily in the <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2065518/1/Demon-Duelist-Legacy-Shadow-Tournament-Arc">Demon Duelist Legacy series</a> and its sequel series <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2143827/1/Legends-of-the-Demon-Duelist-DA-Arc">Legends of the Demon Duelist Series</a>. They tend to diverge a lot from canon, from the kind of supernatural beings that drive the conflict of the stories to the ample usage of author created cards. <br><br> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2569371/1/Rising-Star-to-the-Heavens">Rising Star to the Heavens</a> This tends to follow the mold of the new student in the Duel Academy and Shadow Games, but most characters are interesting, most part of the plot is not cliched and it has really threatening villians later on. Sadly discontinued since 2007. <br><br> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4703308/1/Year-One-The-Trial-of-Shadows">Year One The Trial of Shadows</a> - Mostly follows the manga version of Yugioh GX but attempts to fix the problems  the series generally has. It develops characters like Asuka, Misawa, Junko and Momoko so that Judai doesn&#39;t end saving the day all by himself. It also substitute the Seven Star duelist for much more threatening antagonists. Its two sequel do the same for the other two seasons. <br><br> <a href="http://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=460092">Yugioh Battle Zone</a> - Breaks the mold for Yugioh GX fics by starting with its three protagonists graduating the Duel Academy and entering into the world of professional duel tournaments. The writing is spot on, specially in the dialogues and when describing duels. <br><br> <a href="http://destinyshorizondyh.webs.com/apps/links/">Yugioh Destiny&#39;s Horizon</a> - A separate series by same author of Battle Zone, set in a distant future. The same reccomendations on the writing apply here <br><br> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2381425/1/Following-the-Footsteps-of-Destiny">Following the Footsteps of Destiny</a> - The same caveats as Yugioh Foverer apply here. Really long but really great next generation fic, this for Digimon 02. <br><br> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/302058/1/Next-Generation-And-So-It-Begins-Again">Next Generation and So It Begins Again</a> - Another Digimon 02 next gen fic. This one has maybe too many main characters, there is at least one child for each original Digidestined from the first two seasons, totalling 14 in all, but it&#39;s still well written and a good deal shorter.  <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/345261/1/Canadian-Digidestined">Canadian Digidestined</a> - Takes advantage of the international Digidestined of 02 to tell the story of another Digidestined team in a whole another <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/302058/1/Next-Generation-And-So-It-Begins-Again"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/302058/1/Next-Generation-And-So-It-Begins-Again">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/302058/1/Next-Generation-And-So-It-Begins-Again</a></a>. It has its own general plot and antagonists, though of it overlaps with the Canon material since it is still occuring at the same time the same universe.  <br><br>           </p>

            <p>Well, okay, rereading one and then rereading another. And because they&#39;re both incredibly fantastic, I&#39;ma rec them here! (As though that course of action wasn&#39;t so predictable a mongoose could have guessed it.)<br><br>First, The Journals of Karkat Vantas, Nerevarine:<br>(<a href="http://archiveofourown.org/series/48699"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/series/48699">http://archiveofourown.org/series/48699</a></a>)<br>It&#39;s, well, exactly what it sounds like: Karkat the Dunmer as the Morrowind player character, with all the ranting about everyone and everything and creative insults addressed to all and sundry implied by that description. It&#39;s really, really hilarious, and also incredibly well written and in-character. I suggest if you like either Homestuck or the Elder Scrolls to go check it out because it&#39;s pretty accessible even if you don&#39;t have both fandoms. I literally reread the while thing today, and it was just as amazing as I remembered. And Karkat getting annoyed at game mechanics like his inexplicable ability to swim in armour and the complete insanity of everyone who isn&#39;t a player character will never not be funny.<br><br>Aaand second! is One of Our Submarines:<br>(<a href="http://archiveofourown.org/series/23579"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/series/23579">http://archiveofourown.org/series/23579</a></a>)<br>This...is so fantastic. I literally just found it today, and...wow. It&#39;s written entirely in chatlogs and dialoglogs, which is really, really impressive, because all the characters, even the OCs (especially the OCs) feel so <i>real</i>, and I spent much of the story feeling incredibly distressed, but in a good way. It&#39;s a rebellion AU, which is, admittedly, pretty common, but it focuses mostly on the Helmsmen and Sollux and the Psiioniic, and Karkat&#39;s revolution only really comes into play about halfway through. Also, I never thought I would respect Eridan, or really have any other emotions towards him other than apathy and murderous intent, but the way he&#39;s written in this fic... And let me remind you that there&#39;s not narration, only dialogue. Wow. <br>Also, if you read it, there&#39;s occasional dialogue hidden in code, thanks to distressed Helmsmen, so have this translator thingie always on hand!

            <p>There is a tie for what I consider my favorite fanfic.<br><br>Alas, I don&#39;t know how to make links on the board, so I guess you&#39;ll just have to search them on ff.net<br><br>My first is the Tamers forever series, a Digimon fanfic. It is known for featuring a very prominent Rika/Takato ship, but that&#39;s not the reason I like it. I like it because of the action, the characters, the inner conflicts, and the basic premise of the last two fics in the series(namely Takato has to struggle against a literal personification of the digital hazard that takes the form of a split personality,which was a really good way to integrate the already cool ChaosGallantmon into the story. the second is a crossover with 02, and features TK and all the original DigiDestined fighting Daemon, Who now seeks to destroy the tamers dimension. it was sad and epic at the same time.)<br><br>My second is the Pokemon-based Alphabet soup, which is a novelization of Black/White. it features some of the most believable characters I&#39;ve ever seen in a fic, some of the most excellent writing, and one of the best plot twists ever. even though it does get a little violent at the end.<br><br>So? have you ever seen or read any of these fics? Well, I consider them to be the best fics ever written.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10342553/1/Darkness-and-Dreams">Darkness and Dreams</a>: An excellent and sort-of steampunk Homestuck AU. I actually think I originally opened it because I thought it would be stupid, but I got hooked right away. The characters, especially the Alpha kids, are portrayed almost perfectly and the writing is really good for the most part. Also, the AU world itself is very well-established. Currently in-progress, but updated regularly.<br><br><a href="http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?49049-FANFICTION-Jake-English-s-Mysterious-Theater-of-Scientific-Romance-From-the-Year-3k&amp;p=6547927#post6547927">Jake English&#39;s Mysterious Theatre of Scientific Romance from the Year 3000</a>: This just cracks me up. It&#39;s Homestuck characters reviewing bad fanfiction. The writing isn&#39;t the best ever and sometimes the characters, especially Jake and Karkat, get a bit out of character, but it&#39;s pretty good. The catch is, just like Jake canonically likes all movies, here Jake likes all fanfiction, including such masterpieces as &quot;Dave Stdider Pokemon Traner&quot; and &quot;Thirty Hs.&quot;<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6024634/1/Home-with-the-Fairies">Home with the Fairies</a>: A well-thought-out and well-written deconstruction of the clichéd girl in Middle-earth plot. Maddie is a believable heroine who wakes up in Middle-earth one day in the middle of nowhere, doesn&#39;t speak the language, isn&#39;t instantly buddies with all the mains (the first several chapters are very OC-heavy, and several OCs remain in the plot up to the current point, but they&#39;re really good OCs), and has a believable and subtle character arc. Unfortunately it hasn&#39;t been updated in a while, but it&#39;s still well worth the read.</p>

            <p>(probably? *shrug* Seems to me Miah was just plugging the one thing.)<br><br>Right, here are some of my favorites:<br><br><a href="http://sakuramota.deviantart.com/gallery/24502140/Follow-Me"> Follow Me</a>, by SakuraMota. The writing is excellent, the characters have great interactions with each other, and I happen to share the writer&#39;s OTP (Lyra/Silver). <br><br><a href="http://totaldile.deviantart.com/art/Pokemon-Online-Part-1-Emerald-Storylocke-418147552">Pokemon Online</a>, by totaldile. The plot of SAO mixed with a Pokemon Emerald Nuzlocke. Fun, right?<br><br><a href="http://warrenhutch.deviantart.com">This guy&#39;s fanfiction</a>. He has two, &quot;Windfall&quot; and &quot;Earth and Sky&quot;, and they are both works of art. Windfall is short and cute, while Earth and Sky is longer (much) and action-packed.</p>

            <p>First of all, I thought that the &quot;E&quot; did not belong because of Google Translate. Had I done two seconds&#39; worth of thinking instead of consulting Google in my insecurity, I would have remembered that the &quot;E&quot; <i>did</i> belong there; since <i>souhaiter</i> is a regular -er verb, it&#39;s <i>je souhait<b>e</b></i>; I was right the first time.<br><br>As for the phrase itself, I was trying to go with something along the lines of &quot;I hope that you have fun.&quot; The word <i>espérer</i> completely slipped my mind, so I used <i>souhaiter</i> instead.

            <p>I also have an inexplicable love of making charts.
