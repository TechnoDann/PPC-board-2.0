            <p>Hello, everyone! Yes, it&#39;s me again. Things are beginning to come together a little more now. We have lots more lines in (thank you, everybody who&#39;s done them), and we even have a few pictures.<br><br>However. There are some people who have not sent in their lines, for whatever reason, and we would appreciate it if they would. These people are Ansela, Platinumyo and Paddlebrains. The latter two are being poked via other means, but if anyone could get a hold of Ansela, &#39;twould be appreciated. Several vocalists have also dropped out or simply not replied to anything we&#39;ve said. This has left us with a number of characters which need voicing. You know what this means... yes, we need more volunteers to take on lines. The characters in need of voicing are:<br><br>Medical Sue #2<br>Cafeteria Agent #1<br>Sub Rosa<br>Medical Sue #1<br>Daleks<br>DoF Stu<br>DoF Sue<br>Jill<br>Medical!Sue #1<br>Sue from Scene 37<br>Tomb Agent #1<br>Tomb Agent #2<br>Vixen!Sues<br><br>Of these, only Jill and the Sub Rosa have more than two lines. If anyone else feels like taking on a few lines, please offer. I&#39;m fairly certain we can alter the voices in some form or another, if you&#39;re concerned about them all sounding same-y.<br><br>While on the topic, if anyone&#39;s got thirty seconds or so could they please record themselves screaming or shouting in some form or another? Trojie would like background noise for the battle scenes. Screams, battle cries, howls of agony or triumph, that kind of thing.<br><br>On a different topic, we&#39;d like to request some pictures. Nothing elaborate, unless you want to make it so, but could everyone please submit a picture of their Agents in some form or another? The Tektek avatars are only useful in so many ways. If you&#39;re bothered about your lack of artistic skills, don&#39;t be; mine suck, but I still managed to cobble something together.<br><br>Anybody who feels like a bit of a challenge can have a go at designing our title screen, and perhaps some bits of scenery too. Email me privately and I&#39;ll give you the details.<br><br>And finally, a vote. We have two options available for the name of the production company. PPC Productions, and Urplefilms LTD. Please vote on whichever one you like best.<br><br>Thank you all very, very much for your continued support, and we hope to get this thing finished one day.</p>

            <p>Hey, the movie!  I remember that!  I&#39;d be willing to volenteer for more &#39;Sues or agents, I might even be able to do Daleks if I had to (though the idea about using clips is better, pretty sure the BBC has some for free).  Since my agents weren&#39;t in this, I don&#39;t need pictures (yay).  Um...my vote is for Urplefilms LTD.  It&#39;s funner to say.</p>

            <p>Ya, me again. :P Ansela was just replying to a thread of mine yesterday, but I don&#39;t have any other way of contacting her so I hope she drops in. My Dalek impression is shit, sadly, so I won&#39;t volunteer for them unless nobody else does. If Sub Rosa was a guy I&#39;d try for her, too, and I can&#39;t do a female voice so the Sues are out too. However, I will (probably foolishly) volunteer for the Tomb Agents and DoF Stu, and maybe the Cafeteria Agent if nobody else volunteers. Once I&#39;m free for a bit, preferably with nobody else in the house, the battle sounds recording will be done easily, especially since with Tirsaer&#39;s lines I can meld his right into the rest of the lines. If I had any artistic ability/software I&#39;d help with the title, sorry. My vote is for Urplefilms LTD, by the way. Dunno why, just sounds more &quot;official&quot; or something.</p>

            <p>So far the difficulty has been more in finding good voices than any strain to my voice. Only time I really strained my vocal chords so far was with Rosedale, because of the accent I gave him, and that was more &quot;my voice was stuck like that for three days and my throat was sore&quot; than wearing them out. Thanks for your concern though. And yeah, I think  using actual Dalek soundclips, considering the BBC has some for free, would be a better idea than relying on a voice actor&#39;s best Dalek impression. I mean, really, only the Daleks sound Dalek-y enough. :P</p>

            <p>Just wanted to expand on something. If there are any bit Stus or Agents available other than the ones listed (since people like Laburnum have asked you to look for other one line Sues or other such characters), I could also try those. It&#39;s mostly up to your discretion though, and if you can&#39;t find any or there just aren&#39;t any, I&#39;m fine with that.</p>

            <p>I do like how literally the canon interprets everything. Although I&#39;m now put off ever reading Pern.

            <p>Aww, don&#39;t hate Pern because of bad writing. Even the author isn&#39;t the greatest ever, but it&#39;s just such a cool world, with really cool characters in it.<br><br>...

            <p>Oh, those sneaky gerunds! Google suggests that portal is a perfectly legitimate verb these days, however, what with its in connection with internet portals. Have to disagree with you on which looks better, but then, I tend to be a bit of a fascist when it comes to British English spellings, and as mentioned recently, we double letters a lot.<br><br>Good to know I&#39;m probably not erroneously using &quot;to whit&quot;.<br><br>I suspect one of these days Trojie will force me to read Pern. But my reading will be tainted with memories of the badfic, in much the same way as I can now never watch the Land Before Time. And I suspect I&#39;ll be expecting Pratchettesque satire where none is to be found, what with the dragonriders in The Colour of Magic. Alas.</p>

            <p>I was more using them as examples, but I really was curious to see how departments that weren&#39;t necessarily involved in Sue-killing (though I know those two do kill them sometimes) worked, and even though I&#39;ve seen DOGA and Bad Slash work a couple times I&#39;ve never seen a DIC mission. It was very interesting to read though. Heh, <i>three</i> Sues, that must&#39;ve been annoying to deal with.</p>

            <p>But I have read the book. It is fanfiction. The main character is textbook Sue and her love interest is a terrifying stalker portrayed as the Perfect Guy. The plot is treated as a necessary evil by the author, much more attention is paid to the love interest&#39;s changing eye colour and scary good looks. Oh, and of course the main character who is so selfless and beautiful and modest and kind while still being a total brat, treating her friends like crap and deliberatly making her life harder for herself so that she can angst.<br><br>Yes it is a form of canon, so we have a duty to protect it, but there is nothing the movie can do for Twilight that the book hasn&#39;t already done. Actually, considering what I&#39;ve heard, the movie should be signifigantly better than the book (this is not hard) so it might even be good for the fandom. <br><br>*hopes no one here actually likes Twilight because that could make things awkward.*</p>

            <p>My friend&#39;s a big fan of the books, and thinks that Edward is a Gary Stu, but Bella isn&#39;t.

            <p>I ran across his Doctor Who fic a while back and ran away screaming. This one looks only slightly better. I get the impression that he doesn&#39;t really comprehend the concept of crossovers--he just randomly throws in characters from other universes without really any attempt to incorporate their &#39;verses into the story.<br><br>Sekka and Vanir are his two favorite Stus, I think--Sekka as the main character, Vanir to be Sekka&#39;s punching bag. It&#39;s obnoxious. I just want to tell him to go write his own piece of fiction if he feels the need to shove these guys into every story. Grr.<br><br>This isn&#39;t entirely relevant, but can I claim his Doctor Who fic? I&#39;ve been looking forward to sporking it for a while now, though I still don&#39;t have permission yet.</p>

NOW.), since I hope someone can make a good kill of this one. Just by existing it messes up the canon by having Spike survive the series&#39; ending (Resurrected!Spike= automatic mission, as far as I&#39;m concerned, though I don&#39;t know if that means the agents who take this one have to kill him again). Spelling and grammar get pretty dicey at points, too, but there&#39;s a lot of chapters (18 so far) and it updated last month. There&#39;s also a good bit of OOC behaviour on the part of everyone involved. The Sue even rips off a bit of Faye&#39;s backstory, though otherwise she&#39;s a bit textbook. Still, I think it has potential to make an entertaining mission if any of you are willing to take it.</p>

            <p>Exactly 26, actually, though the last episode is a two parter. If you have a free day it wouldn&#39;t be hard to go through the series in it. It&#39;s a really good anime, anyway. I&#39;ll put a link to the first episode here once I find it, if you want.</p>

            <p>Hello, PPC Board.<br><br>I&#39;ve read the major OFUs, the Wiki, TOS and a bunch of other mission reports, and most of the already published PPC history. People with Legendary Badfic links at the ready, you needn&#39;t bother. I&#39;ve already sat through some, including C*l*b*i*n and Draco&#39;s Christmas Cuppa. Without throwing up. I suspect this is derived from both iron will and insanity.<br><br>I&#39;m a Grammar Nazi and a die-hard canon nut. I don&#39;t normally write though, I&#39;m not that good. No published works so far, and no desire to write Missions for a long time.<br><br>I know some information about certain canons I haven&#39;t read too much of the original material of, such as H2G2, Discworld, and LOTR. Rest assured that I will get around to reading all of these, so put the weapons away.<br><br>Oh! One more thing. I brought a present, but I&#39;m not sure who can actually use it. It is an Ion Canon, created by a Command and Conquer misspelling. Any Agent in a universe with large orbital lasers can have it sent in, I think. Hope you&#39;ll be able to find a use for it.<br><br>A last note, before I forget. Are there still Ypurs available, and are they available to non-Agents? I want to adopt one, they look cute.</p>

            <p>Yes, you read that right. An axe that shoots fire due to a flamethrower component being added to it. Coolest weapon since chainswords, I say. There should still be Ypurs to go around, as Neshomeh said, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find a use for the Ion Canon. Probably give it to DOGA if nothing else, and we can always put it in the Armoury.

            <p>Okay, I was chatting to a few PPCers, and one of them made a comment which got me wondering... what misions does everyone take on? I don&#39;t mean Agents, I mean Boarders. For example, I was told there have only ever been five people who write for Bad Slash, and I was wondering if there was anyone else who did it. So... help out a curious li&#39;l ol&#39; PPCer?</p>

            <p>On the missions front, I&#39;ve done DOGA and DoWTF officially, with some of the DOGA missions being DMS stuff in disguise. I guess the co-mission with Neshomeh and Kippur was DMS mostly, too. I&#39;ve also done the DIO, and about half of a Bad Slash mission which was supposed to be a lead in to Crashing Down. That kind of didn&#39;t work out, but I&#39;ll probably finish it someday. Oh, and I&#39;ve done an Intelligence report with Agent Kyaris.<br><br>On the other writing front, I have Agents in just about every major Department, to the extent that I can&#39;t even remember who most of them are.

            <p>The DMS has lots of Divisions, like LOTR, Harry Potter and Video Games. Anyone who takes on Video Games would naturally cover only those games for which they know the canon, but they&#39;d receive their missions just like anyone else. Just because your Agents are the first known of Video Games Division doesn&#39;t mean they have to make decisions about all Video Game fics, if you see what I mean.<br><br>And if I recall correctly, just as a note to anybody who might read this, the DMS has a Floaters <i>Division</i>, which means they take on any fandom they&#39;re competent with.</p>

            <p>Intelligence looks up the missions and sends them to the Agents that fit the bill for tackling it. That&#39;s what leads to some of the mix-ups sometimes, like Slash Agents getting Sues (when said Slashers aren&#39;t rigging the console to steal missions). Sometimes the Flowers <i>do</i> take a hand (or leaf) in assigning missions, generally the majorly awful ones like in the case of That Series, but I don&#39;t think they make a regular thing of it.</p>

            <p>We were discussing the DBS, yes, but it&#39;ll also be interesting to see who, if anyone, writes for the other departments. &#39;Cause there are quite a few of them, but pretty much everyone seems to be in Sues.

            <p>So, it&#39;s just come to our attention that there&#39;s only ever been, like, five Bad Slashers, and we&#39;re feeling a little lonely, so we though, how can we make outselves feel loved, and popular, and members of a vast organisation of likeminded individuals?<br><br>The answer, after a moment of alcohol-fuelled tangents, became clear: T-shirts.<br><br>And so we ask any and all comers to participate in a caption competition.

I own nothing but the character of Elbereth but not her name. All owned by Professor Tolkien! PLEASE R &amp; R!<br>Pairings: Haldir/OC, Legolas/OC<br><br>Oh, no, not again. Not as ridiculous as &quot;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&quot; for a name, but just Elbereth is bad enough. Daughter of Arwen and Aragorn, and grows unnaturally quickly for an elf. She develops at the rate humans do, which is just bad biology. She is taught dagger-fighting and archery at the age of five, and is good at it; this is ridiculous enough for humans, let alone a five-year-old elf. She is also apparently an illegitimate daughter. Of course, this is absolutely nonsensical and pointless, as Aragorn and Arwen were actually married. Stupid Suethor. What&#39;s worse is that this one actually KNOWS canon, up to having correct Sindarin and knowing the exact date of Arwen&#39;s going to Valinor. Very OOC Arwen for the blasphemy alone, and probably other OOC canons.<br><br>I think the DMS or DoF will take this one. Standard NameStealing!Sue. I suggest #17 on the 31 Ways to Kill a Mary Sue list. Seems quite fitting, as she&#39;s named after a resident of Valinor. #17 involves leading her to the western shore and holding Alfirin in front of her until she drowns.</p>

            <p>That reminds me - where are you getting the info on Elves&#39; ageing from? &#39;Cause we&#39;ve got a very woobiefied 40 year old Legolas acting like a cross between a 13 year old girl and a stable-boy, and it&#39;d be nice to hit it with a bad Elvish biology charge.

            <p>&quot;Morgoth&#39;s Ring&quot;, from the Histories of Middle Earth, tells us that Elves mature much quicker than humans mentally and can speak, walk and even dance by their first birthday.<br><br>However, physical puberty sets in around 50-100 years old, though they reach their adult height by about 50. So you&#39;ll get your bad biology charge, Legolas hasn&#39;t even hit puberty yet according to your fic.</p>

            <p>But for the purposes of the series, she was essentially a living, breathing character. We weren&#39;t given much insight into her true player. She might be made of digital pieces, but in that thread, we&#39;d have to ignore Digimon as well, since technically they&#39;d be avatars of computer bugs, viruses and programs.<br>And Mary-Sue stories don&#39;t really care about logic. Maybe the Tabby Avatar would have to be drawn into PPC medical to get rid of a data corruption left behind by a Mary-Sue?

            <p>Found this on the net: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_catgirls"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_catgirls">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_catgirls</a></a> <br><br>Might take a while to look up all those different people, so I&#39;ll give you a few catboys to go along with it.<br><br>Hellsing has Schroedinger. He&#39;d probably be the most adorable thing ever to walk the multiverse if he wasn&#39;t an arguably insane Nazi kid. Despite that, he looks like something you just wanna pick up and cuddle. It&#39;s kinda creepy.<br><br>If you&#39;re willing to accept anthropomorphic cats, there&#39;s also Neko-sensei/Mr. Cat from Princess Tutu. He&#39;s a pretty funny guy, and rather obsessed with marriage.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if this last one really counts, seeing how he&#39;s from a webcomic instead of a manga. The fairy tale webcomic (sort of) No Rest for the Wicked features the catboy Perrault as one of the main characters. I&#39;m not certain about the status of webcomics in this community, though, so he may not be a legitimate cameo.</p>

            <p>I can answer both interpretations of the question. <br><br>If you mean in fanics, then if they are actual replacements, we kill them just like normal sues. If they&#39;re just dramatically out of character, we restore them either by killing the Sue responsible, or by beating them over the head with a canon text until the author-wraith is exorcised. <br><br>If you mean characters in actual published stories, then there&#39;s not much we can do but complain - the Eragon books are a notable example. Strictly speaking, as PPCers, we&#39;re supposed to defend them, too, but if a character isn&#39;t much liked, most agents can easily find pleanty of more worthy souls to watch out for. </p>

            <p>Forgive me for the ridiculous number of edits to the Oz article - I did use &quot;preview&quot;, I swear. It was only when I started checking the wiki markup that I actually realised how ridiculouly oversized the whole thing was, and I had to do the cut-down editing by section to keep wiki from crashing.

            <p>Hey, fellow literary masochist here! I&#39;ve looked over the Legendary Badfic on the Wiki, and I also think it needs some additions. While the ones they have are in fact absolutely horrific, I can tell the editors missed out on the darkness that plagued the net in my time (I.E late 90s). I&#39;m surprised, frex, that the Marissa Picard Chronicles aren&#39;t on there. Others that definitely merit attention:<br>1.The Misery Sensei Neo-Zero Double Blitzkrieg Debacle. It&#39;s an epic length (500 page) Sailor Moon/Daria crossover that ends up being absolutely incomprehensible. Has been Msted, to great success.<br>2.The Oscarfics. Oh God. Written by a self-proclaimed 13 year old hermaphrodite, who inserts himself into the Sailor Moon Universe to pursue the affections of Artemis. That&#39;s right, the cat. Yeah. Some brave souls actually managed to MSTie it.<br>3. Agony in Pink. Quite possibly the worst Fanfic in existence. Completely blows My Immortal out of the Water. Basically, the Pink Ranger from Power Rangers gets kidnapped by the main villian and tortured, raped, and eventually murdered. So bad it actually caused Australia to ban Usenet for a while. <br><br>If anyone can so much as touch these, you will have my unending admiration and respect. Tread carefully.</p>

            <p>If a story is so infamous that you can mention it&#39;s title and most people will groan and go, &quot;oh, THAT one!&quot;, then it&#39;s Legendary. Same for goodfic - the list is (or, tries to be) only made up of stories that practically everyone has heard of.<br><br>That said, if something truly terrible comes up, we might just add it. Generally it&#39;s good to have consensus, though. I think it would be frowned upon to arbitrarily add a whole bunch of badfics to The List.</p>

            <p>the list is left exactly as each part was submitted, typos and all. Editing it on the Wiki means that it won&#39;t be the same as the LJ version any more, and as each part is complete when someone (Tawaki I think) posts to LJ, it is up to him to decide if there should be changes made.</p>

            <p>Questions are good--we like them, we want you to ask them--but as each new thread pushes old ones off the front page and into obscurity, we prefer that a) you wait until you have several and ask them all at once, and/or b) keep questions to a previously-started question thread.

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about the partner idea since I read the original series, and I wanted to run an odd idea past the board and (hopefully) get some feedback. Also, does anyone know where the archive of the 2008 Mary Sue Invasion is(the marcrovirus incident)? Here goes...<br><br><br>Name:Earl D. Grey<br><br>Description and history:A sentient, anthropomorphic cup of tea, this bizzare beverage container is a refugee from a Hitchhikers-Star Wars-Real World crossover gone horribly wrong. During the events of said crossover, Arthur Dent&#39;s wish for a good cup of tea was overheard by a being from &quot;a high plane of which we know nothing&quot;. Said being evolved an entire species of sentient tea cups on a planet, coincidentally known as Bergamot. Earl&#39;s community and tea subspecies was wiped out by a natural disaster, with only him and his brother (Robert Grey) surviving. Five minutes after the end of the incident, the two fell through a plot hole. His brother appeared on the dispenser tray of the Nutrimatic Drinks Dispenser on board the Heart of Gold due to the effect of the Infinite Improbability Drive on the extreme unlikelihood of an interaction between Arthur Dent and Robert Grey. Rendered limbless, unable to communicate, and otherwise helpless and indistinguishable from an ordinary (if good) cup of tea, Robert was quickly drunk.<br><br>Earl ended up on Squornshellous Zeta, and would spend the next 200 years with Marvin the Paranoid Android. Needless to say, the experience didn&#39;t help his attitude. <br><br>He would fall through another plot hole, and somehow cross paths with several PPC agents. They would take him back to headquarters, and the rest is history.<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>Yes, it&#39;s THAT Saphie. <br><br>LJ was down and I totally just happened to peek in here on a whim and was surprise to see y&#39;all were still going. (Not like in a bad way. It&#39;s just been so long...) <br><br>Any Oldbies still around? I&#39;m still best buds with Andy, and I&#39;ve run into others here and there, like Hawkelf and Blayze, who I RP with, but I was just curious to see what everyone else is up to. <br><br>I&#39;m mostly deeply involved with comic RP fandom, DC and Marvel and have a sci fi pan-fandom game I&#39;m running, if anyone&#39;s interested. <br><br>So, anyone here actually remember me? And what are y&#39;all up to in fandom nowadays? I feel sad that I lost so many email addresses of people when I let my old hotmail die. There&#39;s no way to get back in contact with some of &#39;em now.</p>

            <p>Very, very new Boarder here. A lot of oldbies and newbies appearing - or reappearing - since I joined, apparently. I read Suedom a few times, and it&#39;s good to hear it isn&#39;t actually a dead fic.<br><br>Oh, and do you want some random shiny and/or pointy objects? I&#39;ve got a lightspork, glass equipment from Morrowind, random lightsaber crystals, a few extra copies of Glorious and the Omniscient Staff from the Disgaea-verse, a few Prinny costumes, and a whole bunch of Wall-E plushies. Granted, the plushies and the Prinny suits aren&#39;t actually shiny or pointy, but they are still very awesome.<br><br>Oh, and Neshomeh, is there any more of that food and drink left?</p>

            <p>That&#39;s a flamethrower/axe combo, if you&#39;re wondering. See the nozzle? No, slow down, don&#39;t point it at me, please. Glad to have an old face back, the doors are always open. I was around somewhere between &#39;05-&#39;07 way back when (probably &#39;05 or &#39;06, I KNOW it wasn&#39;t in &#39;07...ah well), but that&#39;s as close to being an oldbie as I can claim to be. Dunno any others aside from the already-established vets, so sorry I can&#39;t help with that. Hope you have fun! Have you read the wiki? A lot of stuff&#39;s happened in the PPC.</p>

            <p>Someday we&#39;ll finish Suedom. Andy and I are guilty as hell that we haven&#39;t yet. Most of our energy&#39;s devoted to school, and Andy&#39;s pretty much converted the idea into an original one she wants to put out as a comic, where I sort of converted Kira&#39;s character into a comic book character with her own comic book world. <br><br>But it&#39;s nice to see people still read it. We REALLY need to finish the dang thing for you guys. <br><br>LOL, and that Mary Sue Invasion thing is great. We never used to do big PPC-wide event crossovers before. </p>

            <p>(Yes, I remember Suedom... as I recall, I&#39;m <i>in</i> it somewhere) I&#39;d just assumed it was abandoned along with so many other large-scale PPC things, so I&#39;m quite pleased to hear you&#39;re still at least thinking about thinking about it. I have noticed a few Suedom-derived things on your LJs, and I figured that was as much as we&#39;d ever get... which would be a real shame, because I know there&#39;s lots of people who <i>really</i> want to know how it ends.<br><br>hS, who as previously mentioned talks too much, but in his defense he was always a big fan of Suedom and only didn&#39;t mention it in his own post because he thought it might be impolitic to do so, and this description is going to end up longer than the post itself if it doesn&#39;t end soon.</p>

            <p>Yeah. The game is panfandom. Any fandom, any character can be apped. It&#39;s a sci fi/horror setting. We allow some OCs, too, but we&#39;re picky about them. (They can&#39;t be Sues or Stus, obviously).</p>

Then James finds out that they&#39;re having sex and gets mad. Sirius proceeds to discover that Remus&#39; werewolf side has taken James as a mate, even though James continues to date Lily. Sirius and Snape find out that they only fell in love because Remus cast a spell on them. Later on, the duo discovers that the spell was working, so their love is real. Oh, and Lily&#39;s a bitch because the author hates her. All this in ten chapters and several gratuitous sex scenes. Joy.</p>

            <p>Yes, Sara and I have got together and decided that a Skype meetup this weekend would be an absolutely fantastic idea. Nice and relaxing. The scheduled meeting times are Friday and Saturday evenings/nights.<br><br>I&#39;ll be around from about 6 p.m. GMT onward, so if everyone who wants to join in emails me their Skype address-name-thingy (or post it on here, if you don&#39;t mind it being generally known) and then pokes me on Gtalk or MSN around that time, we can get started.<br><br>However, to quote hS, &quot;But we&#39;re the PPC -- we don&#39;t just do &#39;relaxing&#39;. No, we need to add a side order of &#39;insane&#39;.&quot;<br><br>Therefore. We propose badfic readings. &quot;The Eye Of Argon&quot;, of course, is just too tempting an opportunity to pass up, so we will be covering that one evening.<br><br>The other evening, we will be doing several shorter ones. &quot;legolas by Laura&quot;, of course, will be making an appearance, alongside &quot;300 Batled for the Alamoe&quot;, which Sara suggested. If anyone else has a favoured little fic they&#39;d like to hear read out, post a link here and I&#39;ll ad dit to the list.<br><br>My email, for those who want to send their Skype names, is cassie dot dramateacher at yahoo dot co dot uk (with slight lterations, obviously).<br><br>Hope to see you there!</p>

            <p>Skype badfic reading sounds very, very fun. Sucks that I&#39;m busy with intrusively-scheduled school-related stuff and miscellaneous other things this weekend, I really wanted to join in. And the time is very inconvenient for me, because it would be 8 in the morning here and I like sleeping in... Ah well. Maybe some other time.<br><br>Maybe someone could try to record it somehow? That would probably be a Very Good Thing for people who aren&#39;t available but want to listen. Like me.</p>

            <p>Hello, everyone. Just figured you should know that Cassie Morgan-Webb and I have just finished the first part of our first ever MST together! We started it two days ago, but due to formatting issues it got delayed some. Mainly, GDocs glitched and turned the bloody thing into an illegible mass of %20 marks. Anyway, work on part two has started (split in two because otherwise it&#39;d be way too long), but we thought we should post it up somewhere for you all to see until the second part is finished! It was too big to put in her LJ, but we got around that by publishing the GDoc and putting it on my site. The idea was to have two copies in case something happened to one, so here you go.<br><br><a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=ddkcfxr6_62dmhskcct&amp;hl=en"><a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=ddkcfxr6_62dmhskcct&amp;amp;hl=en">http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=ddkcfxr6_62dmhskcct&amp;amp;hl=en</a></a> <br><a href="http://rc5593.webs.com/mst1part1.htm"><a href="http://rc5593.webs.com/mst1part1.htm">http://rc5593.webs.com/mst1part1.htm</a></a> <br>With the second link, though, keep in mind that everything else on my site is a work in progress and is therefore constantly being changed, though I would appreciate if you read the MST first before looking at the other content. By no means a requirement, just a preference. Call it courtesy, if you want. Constructive criticism will be appreciated, and is requested actually (especially if you know how to fix that typo in the site&#39;s title) but I just thought it would be fair to inform you in the event that you were reading my work there after finishing with the MST.<br><br>All that said though, have fun reading! I hope you enjoy reading it just as much as we did writing it.</p>

            <p>Following the events of Crashing Down, the PPC has moved into a new era, an era of crises and catastrophes, true, but for the most part of normal, every-day work. That doesn&#39;t mean, though, that nothing changes.<br><br><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/EndTitle.htm">The End of the Beginning</a> is a loose collection of stories from the next few decades of PPC history. It embraces the era known as Ten Years Hence, passes into the depths of Thirty Years On, and eventually comes to rest in an incredibly distant time, more than sixty years from the present. Here, in a PPC nearly three times its current age, many things are different, but many others have remained the same as they always were. That&#39;s what makes the PPC the PPC, after all.<br><br>While most of End of the Beginning cannot yet be released due to spoilers for Crashing Down, this time period is <i>so</i> far into the future that it doesn&#39;t reveal anything. All it does is show what the PPC of 2069 might be like. How we get there is still to be revealed.<br><br><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/EndSeventy.htm">TheEnd of the Beginning: Seventy Plus</a><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s of the same high quality that comes from any hS production, and offers a very intriguing view of the future that seems ever so slightly WoW-inspired. Still a fascinating read, and it&#39;s nice to see the Illian-Sims kids (I assume that&#39;s who they are, anyway) turning up.<br><br>The only query I have is the timeline. What does the 2009 Epidemic refer to? If it&#39;s the slew of disasters we&#39;ve endured this year,shouldn&#39;t it be 2008?

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking it would be good to have some standardization of capitalization across the wiki for words like &quot;agent,&quot; &quot;department,&quot; the various equipment, etc. I think the tendency is to capitalize to make the words important or official or something like that, but it&#39;s kind of unnecessary until they become part of a name, like Agent Someone or the Department of Something. Words like &quot;Bleeprin,&quot; however, that constitute a sort of brand name, should be capitalized.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>This is not about the definition of Sues. Instead, I have a question about what seperates a  merely poor fic from one PPC-worthy. This fic caused me to write this:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4567793/1/Windwalker_First_Test"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4567793/1/Windwalker_First_Test">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4567793/1/Windwalker_First_Test</a></a><br><br>Its main character, Kyranon Ilaren, is the daughter of a police group called the Starhawks. She is naturally force-sensitive and is the daughter of Jinn. Other offenses include being the Chosen One of her subgroup, using the Dark side as well as the light and claiming immunity to corruption (although this charge is dubious due to canonical precedent), creating a race of force-sensitive, sentient Cute Animal Friends, stating that her Starhawks saved the Jedi and saved them from the Sith in the distant past, mucking with the timeline and Jedi policy on marriage, using techniques reserved for Masters in the canonical timeline, being more powerful than any other Padawan, and having her character&#39;s mother intimidate the Council. <br><br>Despite all this, and the occasional bad description, the fic is much better written than the usual tripe in the Pit, and there are some redeeming elements. The Starhawks upstage the jedi, but they would fit perfectly in their own fic. In short, they appear to have been grafted into the Warsverse.<br><br>My question is as follows: is the above fic bad enough to PPC? I&#39;m somewhat undecided...<br><br></p>

            <p>You mentioned the biggest problem yourself: &quot;The Starhawks upstage the [J]edi.&quot; Upstaging the canon characters is the trait all Sues have in common. Everything else just serves to make it worse. The fact that the Sue&#39;s group would work well in their own fic just means that the writer would have done better to write an original story.<br><br>As for whether or not it&#39;s PPC-able, that depends on whether or not you think it would make an entertaining mission for someone.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As should be well-known by now, where one of the halves of Andy and Saphie go, the other is apt to follow, so, here I am!  Hi guys!<br><br>I&#39;ll just go ahead and bring up the S-word right away, since a few people have expressed an interest in what has happened/is going to happen to <a href="http://www.lotrfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?sid=2847">Suedom</a>.  Saphie&#39;s mentioned <a href="http://thekitchensink.comicgenesis.com">my webcomic</a> as an outcome of some of the ideas we were throwing around, which is true to a lot of degrees, so check it out if you&#39;re interested, but don&#39; get your hopes up.  Like Suedom, the comic has also been on hiatus for a year, since I realized that in order to obtain certain life goals, I was going to have to sell my soul to academia for a good long while.  <br><br>So I did.  And for the most part, I have.  And now I&#39;m six months away from graduating Magna Cum Laude with a B.A. in anthropology and a minor in writing at a reputable (and somewhat vindictive) institute of higher learning.  The moral of this story?  Stay in school, kids.  Kicking academic ass is good for your self-esteem (even if it&#39;s not so good for your health).<br><br>So what this means for you guys is that by late May, I intend to be tackling my Post-Graduation goal of giving Suedom a facelift.  Much like looking at my webcomic&#39;s old art, much of my old writing makes me feel like my eyes are bleeding.  (The punctuation use!  The pacing problems!  The undeniable bouts of OOC!  It burns us, preciouss, it burnssss. Ss.)  Thus, much like a phoenix rising from the smoke of a candle burnt at both ends of a horse led to water, Suedom will begin anew - stronger, faster, more powerful than ever before, and about 50% shorter.  Also with fewer dangling participals and better use of commas.<br><br>So, in the meantime, while my BFF Saphie has dived (dove? diven?) headlong into the world of spandex-clad crusaders, I&#39;ve gotten srs bznsly into Avatar: the Last Airbender, and am happily sitting back, chilling with a cup of tea on the good ship Iroh/Everyone, waiting for the rest of the shipwars to die down so that the fandom can be less about who&#39;s pissed off/thrilled that they didn&#39;t get/others didn&#39;t get their ship and jump into the analytical canon-developing fun stuff.  I wonder if, during the periods between the Two Towers and Return of the King being published, there was a substantial amount of vitriol between the Aragorn/Arwen and the Aragorn/Eowyn shippers?  Does vitriol travel as well without the internets to carry it along?  Whatever, I say!  Bring on the cultural analyses of life in the Earth Kingdom.  I&#39;m so ready to get settled and happy in my nice, explorable fandom, much like the well-established LotR fans who used to pat me on the head when I was a wee little n00b who thought Frolijah was the dreeeeeamist thing evarrr.<br><br>In conclusion, I&#39;d just like to address some rumors floating around regarding my hotness, which has been described by some certain BFFs of mine as &quot;smoking.&quot;  It&#39;s time to confront these rumors, and to confirm once and for all that they are all true.  <br><br>The good ship Andy/Saphie returns to mess with your heads!</p>

EDIT ME, YOU BASTARDS!&quot; but since both of us are busy with school and don&#39;t have much time to edit them... <br><br>We kinda want to wait until we have free time, fix the whole thing up, tack the last few chapters on, and put the entire thing out as a more presentable (complete) story from start to finish. </p>

            <p>One of the things the last three and a half years have drilled into my head is the value of saying as much as can be said in as few words as possible.

            <p>Well, I could always do with more bricks (the last set I made just /about/ worked, but at a stretch), but at the moment what I need is more time. I -- ouch -- apparently the last strip was made on the 5th September, so it&#39;s been a while. I&#39;ll hopefully get at least a few together over Christmas, but it&#39;s hardly regular, so... I dunno, it&#39;s your choice whether you still want to do that.

I&#39;m looking for either the worst fics or the most fire. I think I&#39;d go for DOGA, DoWTF, or DoF.<br><br>Also also, how&#39;s the Movie going? I can&#39;t wait for the release, it looks like it will be very, very awesome and full of much win.<br><br>Oh, and am I the first newbie to bring very large amounts of Random Shinies and cute stuffed toys? And am I actually allowed to distribute said shinies, or do I have to wait until I&#39;m at least a semi-Oldbie to obtain shiny object-giving rights?<br><br>Lastly, can I mention random PPC-related things in an original fic I&#39;m trying to write? I won&#39;t be using the PPC and its technology directly, I&#39;ll just be referencing it a lot.</p>

            <p>In one of Manx and Shadow&#39;s missions, there&#39;s a line that &#39;canons cannot die before their author deems so&#39;.

            <p>I might be wrong, but I think you still need permission from Miss Cam to start an OFU. If not from her, then probably from the Permission-Givers here.<br><br>As for #3, I think it would depend on the Sue and the circumstances, but you&#39;d have to be careful with something like Agent Smith--your average Sue would probably manage to &quot;rewrite&quot; him and maintain her personality and appearance while gaining his abilities. We do NOT want a Sue version of Agent Smith running around the Matrix. O.o Same goes for zombies/vampires/werewolves/etc. The Ranma 1/2 springs would probably just be an excuse for her to be more speshul.

            <p><i>If not from her, then probably from the Permission-Givers here.</i><br><br>While, yes, it&#39;s admirable to want to keep some form of control on the OFUs, the problem is that the PPC is only one part of the OFU fan community. We as Permission Givers were chosen as stewards of the PPC -- not of the OFUs. I&#39;m not sure we have the right to claim authority over the latter as well.

            <p>Permission Givers were just for PPCings (I feel like Miss Cam was even one of the original PGs, but it&#39;s been a while, so I could be making it up).  OFUs and the PPC are one in purpose, and there&#39;s a wide overlap in the respective fanbases, but we are separate.<br><br>I think the main thing about OFUs is that there should only be one per fandom.  A lot of people were starting up more OFUs in LotR and Harry Potter, and it was not okay.</p>

            <p>Miss Cam was one of the first three PGs, along with Thalia Weaver and GreyLadyBast, after Jay and Acacia.<br><br>But I think one big thing is that a lot of OFU-writers are also PPCers.

            <p>Those were the three people I&#39;d come up with for the original Permission Givers.  No wonder there&#39;s no room in my mind for studying and stuff like that, my brain&#39;s full of useless PPC trivia.  :P<br><br>I think the PPC Board is an awesome--and usually untapped--source of writing advice, especially for something with established tradition, like an OFU.  I just also think that if anyone&#39;s going to extend authority over OFUs to the PGs, it should be the illustrious Miss Cam herself, instead of us trying to place limits on something that isn&#39;t ours.  Of course, I run <i>everything</i> I write past hS for approval, but, you know, that&#39;s because he&#39;s my husband.  :P<br><br>The Ten (or however many, I know the PPC does get a little carried away with lists sometimes.  XD) Commandments of OFUs sound like an excellent idea that would basically solve all of these issues.  :D</p>

            <p>For 1, I think it got pulled off. That&#39;s all I know, though. I&#39;ve been wondering where to find it myself, as Google is useless for that and it vanished before I even knew about OFUs.<br><br>For 2, it is very much possible. The only thing needed is an Author and a mini designation. I&#39;m personally voting for mini-Flood Juggernaut, a very large Flood form that was cut from the final game. Mini-Juggernauts would definitely be deadly enough, that&#39;s for sure. Besides, they&#39;re the only very large not-really-sentient creatures in the continuum. Hunters can think too, you know... Check the Halo Wiki for details if you want to know more.<br><br>Not sure about 3, I have no experience with that particular situation.<br><br>For 4, I think it is allowable. Trojie and Pads did that in one LxC mission, by taking the Dino-Sues to the meteor of mass extinction and death. Oh, and execution by Rakghouls sounds very, very fun...</p>

            <p>It *is* frowned upon to take Sues out of the canon they&#39;re in to another one to exorcise them; we took them to the Real World, albeit the Real World 65mya ago ... and Agents Trojie and Pads will probably end up getting in some trouble for that one, probably in the form of a particularly horrific mission in the Potterverse - the Flowers like inflicting Marauder-era pain on them when they do wrong. <br><br>The reason, I suspect, that it&#39;s not allowed is that they already contaminated one Word World - by moving them to another you give them a chance, however slim, to contaminate another.

<li>Would it be possible to make a new one? We could say the Sues used a Malachor V-esque Gravity Generator on the old one...<br>2.I vote for mini-Grunt. They&#39;re so cute! Of course, you&#39;d have to avoid stepping on them...<br>3.On second thoughts, that might be a bad idea. If the Gravemind gets Sued, or a Rakghoul could use Sue powers...<br>4. Excellent. I was also thinking of the Flood, or Taris five minutes before its razing...</li>

            <p>For 1, I&#39;m not sure. I guess you should wait for one of the veterans, they have more experience. I think it might be possible though, because I remember a new POTC OFU I saw on FFN.<br><br>For 2, I think mini-Grunts wouldn&#39;t actually be able to keep fanbrats off Canons, being small and squishable. Hunters or Juggernauts might be a better choice... Besides, there are going to be a lot of Generic Normal Grunts running around anyway. The whole Covenant army&#39;s probably going to show up.<br><br>For 3, yeah. That would be very, very bad. I do NOT want to see Gravemind under Sue influence, or superpowered Rakghouls.<br><br>For 4, the Flood seems like a very painful and fun way to kill someone. Just make sure to glass the area or chop up the corpse with an Energy Sword afterwards, because a Sue Form would probably be quite hard to kill normally. Taris death sounds quite fun, especially if it&#39;s recorded somehow to watch later. May I also suggest feeding one to Nihilus or throwing one in the Pit of Carkoon? Sarlacc is a bit slow though. You&#39;d have to portal forward a few years to make sure the Sue is dead.</p>

            <p><br>2. But can Hunters throw blue &quot;spider&quot;s at said annoying fangirls? In any event, my vote&#39;s for Hunters. <br><br>3.Let alone mind warping, god-moding plague vectors or intelligences.<br><br>4. Flood might actually be a bad idea for Sues. If their blood is contagious, things could go downhill in a hurry. Better to simply reserve the Flood for dying bit characters. Carkoon and Nihlus seem to be Very Bad Ideas, if only because the Sue&#39;s life force might be dangerous in the hands of a xenocidal, power-mad loony. As for the Pit of Carkoon, do we really want a Sued Fett/Anonymous Victim or the Sue herself to escape through a plot hole.</p>

            <p>Forgot about that thing with Nihilus, and the Sarlacc being escapable. Nihilus would probably be possessed by the Sue&#39;s soul if that happened... That, or he&#39;d get some new Sue powers and eat the galaxy much faster. And I completely forgot about Fett getting out of Carkoon and mysteriously appearing plotholes. Flood for bits sounds like fun though.<br><br>Hopefully, these suggestions will be better. Tie a Sue to a UNSC NOVA-class bomb or dangle her over a MAC cannon barrel. That, or you could chuck her off the tallest point in High Charity. The really long fall should only be for the ones who can&#39;t fly by any means, though.<br><br>For Star Wars, maybe feed her to the very big fishes on Naboo, the Kamino sea life, or a random krakana? You could also stick one to the Death Star&#39;s laser. Summoning thousands of Hssiss with the Dead Jedi corpse in the Korriban tomb and watching a Sue get eaten by them is also fun. Jekk&#39;Jekk Tarr poison gas is sadistic, evil and absolutely perfect. Just tell the Sue you&#39;re letting her go in front of the door, and that she should have a nice drink.<br><br>Oh, and mini-Rancor. Can I adopt Nihlus? I always wanted a Star Wars mini. By the way, mini-Hunters sounds like a pretty good idea.</p>

<li>Yep, spotted them, and think I claimed one. I&#39;m sure I claimed one that you reported, anyway.<br><br>2. Floaters get everything from Sues to geographical aberrations to slash and more. That&#39;s partly why it&#39;s so popular. Agents there can be made to take on anything. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re after, go for Floaters.<br><br>3. The Movie&#39;s getting there, thank you for asking :). Still waiting on a few people to send in their recorded lines, but storyboards are being worked on, artists are being tentatively contacted for preliminary sketches, and drawings of Agents are being sent in.<br><br>4. Once you&#39;re here, you can distribute gifts freely, so far as I&#39;ve seen. Just don&#39;t give out anything distinctive that other people give out, such as July&#39;s linkage or Sedri&#39;s Transdimensional Pocket Knives.<br><br>5. I think it&#39;d be better if you didn&#39;t, just because a lot of PPC things are pretty close to unique and it wouldn&#39;t be too great an idea to reference obscureish things like that. I&#39;d wait and see what the older oldbies say, though.</li>

            <p>July covered the rest, so here&#39;s my two cents on these:<br><br>3. I know for a fact there&#39;s still recording to be done, because I have to do some of it (though I&#39;m still waiting for my latest parts). Then there&#39;s the animating. I have no idea how Cassie and Trojie plan to see that done, but art takes time, and animating, I&#39;m sure, takes longer. Add in the fact that none of us are professionals (as far as I know), and that we&#39;re all busy with other things, and we&#39;re looking at a good long production period. So, as <i>Farscape</i>&#39;s Pa&#39;u Zotoh Zhaan would tell you, the answer is time and patience.<br><br>5. I&#39;ve already recommended not mixing the PPC with original work to someone else, so I&#39;m doing the same here. We&#39;re allowed to play with the PPC as its own entity, always giving credit to Jay and Acacia for the original concept, but once you cross the line into your own original work, it starts looking like idea theft. Also, the fact that only other PPCers would likely get the references makes it kind of pointless for you if you expect any sort of legitimacy for your work.<br><br>~Neshomeh, wearing her Permission-Giver Hat.</p>

            <p>1 Yes, people did notice the four fics you reported. Most everyone tends to look at all the threads.  If you want you can add them to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Unclaimed_Badfic">this page here.</a>  <br><br>2 I&#39;m going to be honest here and say I don&#39;t care/have an opinion. You should go with the department you think you&#39;ll enjoy writing for the most. <br><br>3 The movie is a topic I have no idea on, and so you&#39;ll have to wait until Cassie or Trojie pop up to answer that question.<br><br>4 No, you are not, and yes, you are allowed, last I checked.<br><br>5 I don&#39;t know in this case, but I&#39;d have to venture a guess and say it would probably be a no. Of course, I&#39;m not sure, and that&#39;s something a PG would have to say on for sure, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be a doable.</p>

            <p>My blessings on you.  I&#39;m pretty sure that it isn&#39;t a canon Abhorsen, actually.  Probably some random historical Abhorsen (aka OC), so she should either be dispatched or recruited.  She seems kind of incompetent, though, so it might be best just to kill her.</p>

            <p>If I had an Assassin agent, I&#39;d take it. That&#39;s both awful enough to warrant a spork and short and stupid enough to be an entertaining mission.

Obviously we&#39;ll need crash dummies, but how do we make the kill without ripping the dummies to bits? Or damaging them at all? (We&#39;re planning violent ends for them, if you couldn&#39;t tell.)<br><br>So, help? Please?</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t read any PPC mishes that are entirely in first person, or any that are in first person at all, to my memory, which isn&#39;t saying much.<br><br>What I recommend though is for the mission to be done in a diary form, or, barring that, how you would write it in a report for the DoIA, just much longer. Report form would be the best, I think.<br>As for the crash test dummies, I advise weapons that work on ghosts and not physical form, or which can be selective on which realm it attacks.<br><br>On that note, I think an artificial Keyblade would actually be a great help here. It possesses the power to momentarily force a ghost (or shadow) into the normal world and make it physical, giving you enough time to hurt it. The spirit (Or shadow) remains attached to the thing they&#39;re possessing, however, and will return if not destroyed quickly enough.<br>Another way to go about it is the Avada Kedavra curse, since it leaves the body unharmed, but seems to destroy the spirit, if the Horcrux that was in Harry is any indication.<br>Other suggestions would be to use any psychic or dark-type Pokemon from the Pokemon continuum, a Ghost-Slaying Axe from the City of Heroes Continuum, an exorcising / depossession spell from Charmed / Buffy or the Light Arrows from Legend of Zelda. The arrows won&#39;t work by themselves, nor will the axe, but when used with the Keyblade or depossession spell, they&#39;d be much more effective.</p>

            <p>That might actually be a good idea, asking for a dimensional travel-capable hitchhiker&#39;s towel. Although I should probably just try to think of an appropriate price for some sort of cool gift, like the talent of erasure from Demons Don&#39;t Dream (one of Piers Anthony&#39;s Xanth novels, where the talent is a prize for winning the game Companions of Xanth).<br><br>On another subject, if someone were to wish for immortality (quite possible, seeing as Yuuko can create gods if she wants to), I would think that an appropriate price would be as such: The person can feel pain, and even lose their sanity for a period of time, but no matter what lengths they go to to die, or how sick they get of life, they are unable to leave the mortal plane permanently. Plus, they are cursed in such a way that events are always arranged to cause them trouble, and frequently at that. As an example, the person is inexplicably disintegrated. Said person must then spend decades dragging back and reassembling their atomized, very much scattered (by a convenient gust of wind) body, or remain as clusters of free-floating atoms.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think Yuuko can create <i>Gods</i> so much. She might be able to give people powers but it&#39;s all strictly on her terms. I don&#39;t think she can give people immortality either. Well, she might be able to but she wouldn&#39;t due to the whole Space Time Continuum thing. She&#39;s got this thing about not letting people come back from the dead, so eternally putting off death is probably a no no too. Death is inevitable, after all.</p>

            <p>Yes, you must definently read Tsuabsa. You can find it in most bookstores that stock manga, along with most online manga readers. The latest chapter just came out and it is made of so much awesome I had to read it twice before I could stop squeeling.</p>

            <p>We certainly hope there won&#39;t be any story death, and with the authors as determined as they are (one of them likes prodding people to make them do things they&#39;re supposed to be doing), it shouldn&#39;t happen, though there may be fairly long waits between chapters.<br><br>As for your questions: yes, enrollment is still open (unless Oozaru&#39;s closed it without telling me), and no, you don&#39;t have to write TRC fanfic to join. Several of our students&#39; authors don&#39;t even know the continuum, they signed up out of sheer masochistic curiosity. The enrollment form is on the OFUTRC LJ, it&#39;s the first post we made. Just copypaste it, fill in the answers to make a fanbrat, and email me the result. My email is cassie.dramateacher at gmail.com (with obvious alterations).<br><br>Fanbrat-you should appear in the next chapter, as we&#39;re trying to make sure we cameo everyone fairly.<br><br>And thank you again, we don&#39;t get much feedback on our work, and it&#39;s nice to know people do enjoy it.</p>
