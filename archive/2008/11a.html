            <p>The way I plugged the missions they could indeed be seen as badfic reports.<br><br>It would be nice to have someone else working in Doctor Who/Torchwood division. There&#39;s a lot of badfic there. Luckily most of it is so short there&#39;s barely enough of it to do a mission on, but some of it is just too painful to read.</p>

            <p>Heh, yeah, tricked me because I was tired and didn&#39;t read that carefully. The missions are good though. And yeah, those fandoms have some of the worse non-Legendary fics from what I know. I know some about the fandom, so it wouldn&#39;t take me long to be well-versed enough to do missions there if needed.</p>

A vampire rescues a little girl when she&#39;s about four years old, watches her for most of her life, then the two fall in love when she&#39;s in her twenties.

            <p>Hey, Lily, that&#39;s a really nice poster, but having headliners is a bit... odd.<br><br>Especially since because of how that RP worked, there were no main characters really, making there be little sense in having &#39;Starring&#39; right there at the top with just three Agents. It downplays on the participation of a lot of other Agents, as well. <br><br>Not to mention the credits below don&#39;t really mention a fraction of the people involved.<br><br>I do like the artwork, though. :)</p>

            <p>And it&#39;s very nice. <br><br>I&#39;ve got the tracks loaded as MP3s on my hard drive for use when we come to putting the soundtrack audio on it.

            <p>Love this poster, Lily, it looks awesome and just makes the idea of the movie more exciting. I&#39;ve been trying to get all my lines in as quickly as possible (doing three characters at once makes that a little easier said than done), and I hope the rest of the cast does too so we can get even closer to finishing this. I can tell the whole thing is gonna be amazing when it&#39;s done. Is &quot;There Will Be Glitter&quot; supposed to be a parody of &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;? That&#39;s what I thought of when I saw the title. Yeah though, awesome work.</p>

XD The RP it was adapted from was even better. And I&#39;m sure your contributions will help immensely.<br><br>As for the movie title, it was the result of a vote. We had everyone send in titles they liked, and then once we stopped getting offers, we put them to a vote- yep, all 58 of them. &quot;There Will Be Glitter&quot; won out.</p>

            <p>And that&#39;s saying something, as I&#39;m rather critical of art work. But the sketchy picture combined with the bold text makes a really nice effect. I would have done it differently, probably used colour but kept the sketchy element and my drawing style is a little different to that, but I still like. So much going on in one picture, it attracts your attention. Was it you who drew it?</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I hope you are all well, and none of you are offended by my daring to ask permission. The rules were not that clear on where former semi-regulars stood as far as the &quot;one month&quot; thing went, so since I used to be at least somewhat active in &#39;05/&#39;06 I thought I would be allowed to try. I am writing up the sample as well, but this part will only be the agent bios, both for length concerns and because I want to make sure my ideas are accepted before I waste my sample on concepts that might not even be approved. When it is finished I will probably put the sample in as a new topic. I am basing the layout of the profile on the agent profiles on the wiki for convenience, if that is alright. I&#39;ll do Marcus first, and then Zodfang. As Marcus is an entirely original character, and Zodfang is an Ork, Marcus required more work and putting both in this one will honestly take too long. I will then put Zodfang&#39;s bio in as a reply to this post. I hope you don&#39;t hate it too much, and I apologize for the ungodly length (at least, it&#39;s really long on my computer, it might be different for yours, different monitors and stuff). I&#39;d appreciate it if you let me get both bios up before giving feedback, but if you do before I&#39;ve gotten the next one up I&#39;ll take what you say into account and try to improve upon the characters.<br><br>  Agent Marcus<br>Name: Marcus Langston<br>Age: 41<br>Species: Human <br>Home Continuum: the Real World/Earth One<br>Department: As a veteran PPC agent, he has done at least a few missions with several of the Action Departments, especially the Department of Mary Sues, but as of his re-instatement he has been temporarily assigned to the Department of Floaters.<br>Division: Freelance<br>Response Center: RC #5593 <br>Partner: Agent Zodfang<br>Fandom(s): Has grown familiar enough with several fandoms over the years to at least function in missions there, a measure he took out of necessity, but his personal fandoms are M*A*S*H, Metal Gear Solid, Half Life, The Godfather, Halo, Legend of Zelda, Doctor Who, Lord of the Flies, Lord of the Rings (but only in passing), Les Misérables, Battle Royale, and Street Fighter.<br>Lust-object(s): Prefers &quot;real&quot; women to the natives of the various continuua that make up the multiverse, partly due to the hazards created in the event of a lust object being in the fic a mission goes to, and partly due to the fact that it just seems weird to him. He is, however, something of a playboy at times, and gladly flirts with whatever female catches his eye at those times, whether they&#39;re canons, badfic characters, civilians or even PPC agents, even if at the same time keeping some respect for them and their personal space. It&#39;s not enough to be a male Lux, just prevalent enough that it&#39;s a notable facet of his personality and reputation. He suppresses this as much as possible during missions, however, even being known to take doses of anti-Lustin hours in advance if he thinks a mission is imminent.<br>Favourite(s): Has no real favourite characters. Not out of not liking any, but just that there&#39;s none that he would say are his favourite above all, especially since in some cases he&#39;s met the actual canon character on missions (and, of course, neuralyzed them) and either thought less of them or there are just too many people he likes and respects for one to really rank above everyone else.<br>Weapon(s): A ferociously dirty fighter, he&#39;ll use whatever is on hand when in a fight to incapacitate, kill, or simply injure the opponent. Primarily uses handguns and either swords or knives, but has also dabbled in the use of submachine guns (FN P90 for example), shotguns, and explosives, though he is not as good with those and rarely uses explosives. He likes to switch up his weapon loadout if he thinks he&#39;ll need it for a mission, and used to stop by the armoury with annoying frequency to acquire new weapons. His current armaments are a BFR .50 Beowulf revolver (he sometimes switches this out with a Colt M1911 .45 pistol which is sometimes more useful in a firefight), a Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife, and a 40k power sword which he tends to save for tougher opponents and is therefore left in his response centre about as often as he takes it with him. He was known to use a machete in his earlier missions, as well.<br><br>Appearance: Standing at 6&#39;1, Marcus is slightly taller than average, and his 193 pound frame doesn&#39;t look nearly as old as Marcus actually is. Not very obviously muscular with his clothes on, Marcus is still fit-looking and toned, with corded muscles and something of a six-pack visible. More an athletic figure than that of a bodybuilder, his frame actually looks a bit thin if you look at him right, belying the fact that he is actually very strong and works hard for his strength (when he moves into a new response centre, one of the first things he does is start building a gym in the first place he sees where it would be reasonably out of the way). Understandably, he does have a few notable scars on him, one going from just above his left cheekbone next to the eye to next to the corner of his lip (knife wound sustained during his first mission when the Stu attacked him while he was reading the charges, luckily his partner killed the Stu while it was grappling with Marcus to finish him off), another from right temple to just above his right ear (burn from a bullet grazing him), a horizontal line half an inch long in the middle of his gut (slashed by a Sue in a swordfight, dodged most of the blow so only the very tip of the blade cut him), and a circular burn-like scar under his left shoulder (shot in the flesh of the armpit area in a firefight, was able to kill the Sue and get back to Medical in time to be treated and save the arm, though) are his most outstanding. He has a few other small scars from scuffles and the like, but they&#39;ve long faded by now and even the big, notable, scars have been worn by him for so many years now that sometimes one has to look closely in order to really make them out. He doesn&#39;t tan very well, his caucasian heritage obvious, but he isn&#39;t exactly sickly-pale either. <br><br>  Barring some stubble on the chin, he keeps his face clean-shaven, and his features are strong, still at least somewhat handsome (but not too attractive, just also not quite ugly) despite his scars and steadily increasing age. Not too round, but not too angular, he enjoys a decent middle ground between the two. His jawline is slightly squared, giving his face a solid appearance, and he has high, nicely-defined cheekbones. His nose, of medium size and length, is straight and unbroken, not drawing much attention. His eyes are a little smaller than average, but not much, just slightly smaller than medium, and they are a dark, somewhat dull, green. The dark/dull colour of his eyes lend to the feeling of disinterest people get from him, as even when he&#39;s completely focused on something there&#39;s almost a sense of inattentiveness. Like his hair, his eyebrows are brown, and surprisingly not starting to show signs of greying yet, bushy but not too much so, a bit high up but not much and arching a little, complimenting his eyes well. It&#39;s difficult to tell if his hairline is receding or if he just slicks his short brown hair (only goes down to mid-neck in the back) back, but probably either the latter or some combination of both where the former isn&#39;t that noticeable. He has a nice smile on the rare occasions he shows it, but not perfect. Overall his face gives the impression of a tired man who probably looked better when he was younger but, while not the most attractive agent, is hardly ugly despite his work wearing him down.<br><br>  Marcus has no tattoos or other body modifications. His legs are slightly bulkier than his arms, but not disproportionately so, the muscle in the thighs and calves and the like is just more noticeable. His neck muscles are powerful but not that girthy, one of the first few clues that his apparently average-sized frame is stronger than it looks from years of fighting and exercise. His uniform is a black jumpsuit similar but not identical to Solid Snake&#39;s sneaking suit circa the second Metal Gear Solid game, modified to give the maximum range of movement without being so skintight, the flashpatch proudly displayed over Marcus&#39; heart. He isn&#39;t out of uniform often, but when he is he tends to wear casual black clothes, usually a black t-shirt, some black sweatpants, and steel toed boots.<br><br>History: Marcus was born in Manitoba, Canada, on 15 January 1967. Having been an energetic and slightly bratty child, he loved to cause trouble for his parents at first, but was fundamentally good at heart and never really stirred up more than his parents could handle, though at times said parents hated raising him because of it. All that aside though, the Langstons were a relatively happy family comfortable with their more or less middle class status. Growing up, Marcus had a mostly normal life with a good, caring, family, though he had a firey temper which lead to several fights at school. He did start to mellow out eventually, though, especially once he discovered the wrestling team as an outlet. Years passed uneventfully, and he went through school, made friends, passed time with the family, and all in all enjoyed life as a young person was supposed to. He even discovered an interest in the law and made moves towards getting a criminal justice degree and joining the police force.<br><br>  At twenty five, he finished all of his schooling, and with some of his friends had a wild party to celebrate. That was how he discovered the PPC. Like many Earth One agents, he fell through a plothole. The difference? Marcus had been monstrously drunk and barely able to stumble along without falling over, gotten separated from his friends, and leant against a wall only to discover that it wasn&#39;t a wall when he then found himself laid out on the floor of what he would eventually know as HQ, with two very startled Agents in the room.<br><br>  A couple of queries as to what the hell was going on, a mumbled &quot;okay...&quot; to a question he didn&#39;t hear, and a hangover the next morning later, and Marcus found himself recruited into the PPC. Needless to say, he freaked out. After waking up in (what he would later know as) Medical where the two agents had put him the other night so he&#39;d sober up, he grabbed the person who looked like they had the most authority and demanded to know what was happening. So the person offered to take him to someone called &quot;The Marquis de Sod&quot;. Too confused to stammer out anything other than &quot;Uh...sure?&quot;, he followed, only to do a double take when he noticed the &#39;Marquis&#39; was a giant Daisy. That asked him with telepathy what he was doing there. Naturally, Marcus&#39; first question was whether he was high and everything in the building was a bad trip. This, unfortunately, got an annoyed &quot;no&quot; from the giant flower, who proceeded to take quite a while to convince Marcus otherwise while trying to tell him what was going on.<br><br>  After a while it simply assigned him to something called the &quot;Department of Mary Sues&quot;, a &quot;response centre #7589985&quot;, and told him to meet someone named &quot;Agent Wilson&quot; there. If not for the fact that the person who&#39;d brought him to the giant flower&#39;s office hadn&#39;t offered to take him there the bewildered 25 year old might&#39;ve been lost for quite a long time. &quot;Agent Wilson&quot; turned out to be a red haired man dressed in black who looked a bit younger than Marcus was, but who walked like he&#39;d been in wars already. He was friendly to Marcus though, helping him out with the uniform and how to understand all the stuff the Flower had told him, even giving him a weapon. The console in their room eventually bleeped, and Wilson prepared for the &quot;mission&quot;, telling Marcus to come along and offering to walk him through it.<br><br>  The first mission was a disaster, and if Wilson hadn&#39;t been there Marcus would have been killed. He&#39;d followed all of Wilson&#39;s instructions, written down the things Wilson said to mark as charges, and then when they had portalled the Stu out of the fic Wilson let Marcus read out the charges. The Stu was scared, though, and pulled out a knife. It charged as Wilson called out a warning, and Marcus was slashed in the face, though he was able to tangle up the Stu&#39;s arms before it could get a fatal stab in. He went to the ground with it, and tried to keep the knife away, and then there were suddenly two sharp cracks. The Stu fell dead, Wilson holding the smoking gun. He asked if Marcus was alright, and Marcus said &quot;hell no!&quot;. So Wilson took him to Medical after the mission report was submitted.<br><br>  They were more careful for the next few missions, being sure to restrain the Sue or Stu thoroughly before reading the charges, but Marcus was still shocked about the incident, not just how close he had been to death but watching a living being, more or less a person as far as he knew, die right in front of him. He got used to the &quot;seeing people die&quot; bit quickly, but the first time Wilson handed him the gun and told him to do it, Marcus almost choked. After a few more missions he started getting used to that too though, stopped feeling so guilty. &quot;Those things are a threat to the multiverse,&quot; Wilson had told him after Marcus had loudly questioned why they were going around murdering random fanfic characters or whatever the hell they were doing, &quot;We leave &#39;em in there, they distort and rot the whole canon. You ever seen gangrene work? It&#39;s like that. Danger to pretty much everything that exists, will exist, or did exist.&quot;<br><br>  At first Marcus wasn&#39;t sure he bought it, but he tried not to bring it up. After a while it stopped bothering him. More missions came, and eventually Wilson was transferred, another agent being put in as Marcus&#39; replacement partner. By then he was starting to be a capable agent himself though, so he could start working with his partner instead of using them as a tutorial. Eventually it was he who got transferred, and she who got the replacement.<br><br>  His next partner, however, got killed. It was only his third partner, but Marcus already had a lot of missions under his belt by then, and seemed to know more about how things worked than the other boy. It was their fifth mission together, to a Batman Stufic, and while Marcus was compiling charges the boy, Agent Paul Hargrave, got overexcited and charged the Stu as it ducked into an ally, startling it and causing it to shoot him dead. Needless to say Marcus immediately returned the favour, not even citing the charges since &quot;Murdering a PPC agent&quot; really topped all of the ones he&#39;d had down for that one.<br><br>  Eventually, Marcus stopped hating himself for letting Agent Hargrave die, and life moved on. More partners went in and out of his life, some died (those he mourned), some went insane (those he pitied), some retired (those he envied), and some just got transferred (those he identified with because it happened to him too many bloody times). It didn&#39;t help that after a while he seemed to have been bounced around the Action Departments like a pinball, which got annoying. He&#39;d be in one Department, randomly transferred, and then put back just as randomly after a few missions. Eventually he just directly asked the Sod to stop doing that.<br><br>  Marcus eventually became quite a good agent, though he tried to stick to the background. He did well in missions, and tried to avoid trouble when it popped up elsewhere, like in the case of the DIS. That wasn&#39;t to say he didn&#39;t fight when necessary, he just didn&#39;t take it further than he had to. In neither the Reorganization nor the Black Cat invasion was he a key player, but he wasn&#39;t completely uninvolved. Just stayed out of the spotlight as much as he could because he was more concerned with staying alive. Until late 2007, he wasn&#39;t really at the centre of any real scandal.<br><br>  It was some time near the end of December &#39;07 when it happened. The mission he&#39;d been sent on, to a Warhammer 40,000 Stufic (as unlikely as that sounded), went awry. People analysing it in the future would probably call it a &quot;meta ... up&quot;. At the disciplinary hearing they said that the fic had still been in progress and that looking at the Words indicated the Stu had been about to die an</p>

            <p>You spent three rather long paragraphs simply on his physical description. For a character bio on a website, fine. But not for a Permission request. Time enough for all that later. What we want is a brief synopsis so we can be sure he&#39;s not Prince Gary of the Magical Land of Fairydust, Middle-earth, and that he&#39;s not a copy of any other Agents (unless that&#39;s a plot device, of course). We want to know Department, fandom, and any <i>major</i> personality traits which could mark him as a &#39;Stu. By all means <i>keep</i> all the details, for use later, but right now they&#39;re unnecessary and we can&#39;t get through them.<br><br>Also, no one really has a clue who you are yet. You say you were here a couple of years ago, and while I don&#39;t actually remember you I&#39;m willing to believe that, but that&#39;s just it. No one remembers. So keep posting until we know you, then we&#39;ll see.<br><br>All of which boils down to a temporary Permission Withheld, with the understanding that once you&#39;ve been around for a while, you can post again without this affecting our decision one way or the other.<br><br>hS, temporary spokesperson for the Permission Giver Hive Mind</p>

            <p>That all makes sense, thanks. And yeah, goes back to the &quot;way too detailed&quot; thing, it seems. That&#39;s just a habit of mine from my other websites (since they stress giving a detailed description so people have a clear image of him, it&#39;s a habit that grew on me). Just a mistake on my part due to transferring writing styles. I do appreciate your input though, this really is helpful. I&#39;ll edit this and work on the sample and other agent bio while I get to know people then. I mentioned the years thing because I was more looking at the letter of the rule than the spirit, I guess. I hope I didn&#39;t offend you, thank you for your pointers. I think part of my error was sheer eagerness, heh.</p>

            <p>This is, so far, a massive first draft, and I&#39;m used to writing more detailed histories so I got a bit carried away. So I understand what you mean when requesting I make a more summarized version, it really could do with being shorter. I&#39;m currently doing Zodfang&#39;s, but after he&#39;s done I&#39;ll take Marcus&#39; and make it a bit less insanely long. As you said, they&#39;d need a while of time available just to read through it. Sorry about that, heh.<br><br>Thank you, though, for clearing up the month thing. I was confused by that. I can&#39;t edit on this, so I assume it&#39;d be okay to put the more cut down version in a new reply, with an advisory that it should be read over the previous one?</p>

            <p>There seems to have been a problem with the length of the bio. I apparently made it too long, so I have to type up the rest. So yeah, two parter, and I&#39;ll make a mental note to not make Zodfang&#39;s so bloody big.<br><br>&quot;yway, marking a point in the story where it would improve, but Marcus interfering early to kill the Stu before it could escape (as it did look like it was about to escape) not only prevented that but created a parodox. The Words were shown, describing a &quot;figure in black&quot; levelling a pistol at the Stu&#39;s head.<br><br>  That bit there, the alleged &quot;accidentally being written in&quot; (despite Marcus&#39; claims that it was impossible), damned Marcus&#39; whole case. Killing without charges was excused by them being in the middle of combat, but a potential security leak? Causing a parodox in the fic? It didn&#39;t matter if it was true, if it was Upstairs&#39; fault for giving him a mission to a fic that was in progress, none of that mattered. At the end of the day, Marcus still insisting the hearing had been biased against him, he was found guilty on all counts and his license as an Agent was temporarily suspended. At least three years they said, most likely. There were concerns about if he would be able to adjust to civilian life, so he was allowed to continue to live in the New Caledonia city (especially since they figured they might need to contact him), but he wasn&#39;t allowed in headquarters and wasn&#39;t considered an Agent until the suspension was lifted. Through all that, Marcus continued to appeal it.<br><br>  After a few months, Marcus all but gave up. However, events such as the Macrovirus plague and the Sue invasion came by, devastating the PPC. A few months after that, his case was finally put back under review by whoever (hell if he knew). Almost a year after the hearing and suspension, the verdict was overturned and he received new orders: report back to the Marquis de Sod for reassignment.<br><br>  Needless to say, Marcus&#39; first thought was &quot;what the hell took those Flowers so long?&quot;. His second was &quot;I hope I haven&#39;t gotten rusty.&quot;<br><br>Personality: While not the emotionally dead shell you might expect a 16 year vet of something like the PPC to be, Marcus definitely gives off the impression of being tired, in the literal sense of suffering from fatigue, oftentimes people conversing with him feel as if he&#39;d rather be asleep than talking to them. This is through no fault of his own, or of the other party, however, more due to the relaxed, almost lazy way he typically carries himself. The fact that he often IS quite tired doesn&#39;t help things, but he&#39;s still more laid back than people expect, which does give the impression of aloofness. <br><br>  He is more alert than he looks, though, right down to the seemingly calm gait he walks with, every step calculated as if half of him were checking for traps and the other half was ready to explode into action and rip the throat out of the nearest living creature in an instant. Like anyone who lasts more than a couple of missions in the PPC, he is a remorseless killer when you get down to it, and a highly dangerous one at that, if more controlled and only really willing to kill when he has to (his justification for mercilessly killing Sues is a third &quot;they&#39;re a threat to the multiverse&quot; a third &quot;If I don&#39;t kill them, they&#39;ll kill me&quot; and a third &quot;it&#39;s my job&quot;). He is much slower to anger than when he was younger, not as rash or impulsive. Hardly cold and unflappable, it just takes a lot more to actually get him pissed off nowadays, and except for a couple of instances his fury tends to be more cold than hot. When provoked, he usually assaults the person responsible with no warning.<br><br>  He has always been sarcastic and snarky, but it seems age has only increased this trait in him, along with increasing the sheer venom in his words. He has no tolerance for stupidity, and will make that known at the slightest provocation. When it is not used to lay people low, however, his &quot;smartass&quot; sense of humour is still quite potent, and can be amusing in the right situation. More often than not though, he just comes across as an asshole and makes people angry. Not for a lack of trying though, when he can be arsed he definitely puts on a strong effort to come off as a decent and likeable person, and has actually made some friends in the organization, but it&#39;s always easier said than done for him, especially since he constantly has to convince himself that there&#39;s even a point in trying. Where that many years in the PPC make many others too paranoid to ever be in contact with anyone else, it took him a while to get past that himself, and figure out that his best chance of actually making it was to stick with people.<br><br>  It isn&#39;t just pragmatism that drives Marcus to occasionally try to reach out to people, though. Every time he gets close to someone and they die, or get reassigned, or go crazy, or just retire, it hurts him greatly, but he always tries again, mostly due to the desire to form a sort of &quot;normal&quot; life in the organization, especially since at this point he is sure most of his friends and family in the &quot;outside world&quot; believe he is dead. That fact, and the inevitability of their having moved on, used to depress him, but by now he&#39;s largely gotten over it and been able to find a place in life where he is content, if not always happy. The sense of being a part of something greater, of actually being valuable to the protection of what is basically all of existence, is both overwhelming and extremely satisfying to him, and he still sometimes falls back on reminding himself that people *need* the PPC when he isn&#39;t sure he can keep going without that kind of boost.<br><br>  As said before, Marcus is also something of a playboy and flirt, when the mood takes him he can pretty reliably be seen hitting on whatever girl catches his eye, though not absurdly and not to the point of harassment. If he can get in their pants, great, if not, he backs off, as just the act itself helps him establish that connection with another human he is typically after when on such endeavours, and he usually feels better than he did before. Some have suggested that this means he&#39;s more flirty/perverted when he&#39;s depressed, but he denies this. Overall, Marcus is someone who likes to put on a strong face for everyone else, though he isn&#39;t afraid to let it down every once in a while. He has actually started to wonder if he is starting to get too old for the job, on the grounds that the pressure can be so overwhelming at times.<br><br>  All that having been said though, he is still sometimes capable of the same hot-blooded insanity as other PPC agents, it just shows up less frequently.&quot;</p>

            <p>You&#39;re down far enough south that it&#39;s cold :) Cos the earth is a globe, and the closer you are to the poles the further you are from the Sun&#39;s warmth, and so the temperature in the air is low enough that water can freeze to form snow! And snow increases the planet&#39;s albedo, so it reflects more warmth, and gets colder! <br><br>Positive feedback loops are FUN!</p>

            <p>Thing is, snow in November is a northern thing. It&#39;s supposed to be well on its way to summertime now - and yes, I know I&#39;m further south than you, but snow flurries this late are... not common. I won&#39;t say &quot;rare&quot;, as I haven&#39;t been here long enough, but still. <br><br>And anyway, people don&#39;t generally appreciate the cold nearly enough.

            <p>I refer you to the PPC Constitution.<br><i>2. Respect other people’s opinions, especially when it comes to controversial issues, like religion, homosexuality and slash, or witchcraft. You don’t have to agree with anyone, of course, and stating your own opinion is encouraged, but no telling other people that their opinion is WRONG. It’s kind of hard for an opinion to be wrong, considering that it’s how that certain individual sees a certain issue.</i><br><br>Yeah, calling Obama &quot;the good guy,&quot; especially without any evidence to back up your claim? Not so cool. Back off, please, or at least justify your side. Just because you support him doesn&#39;t make him good, and doesn&#39;t make McCain evil. Please remember that we&#39;re trying to not attack each other here, and please remember that whichever side of the line you happen to fall on, there will be plenty of intelligent, reasonable people on <i>both</i> sides, so let&#39;s not go attacking morals, please?

            <p>Sounds like you could handle it as an Imposter!Stu, though I&#39;m not really sure. Then it&#39;d be a textbook case of getting rid of the Stu, finding the real canon character, and replacing the Stu with the canon. I&#39;m guess guessing though, more or less.</p>

            <p>The fact that you didn&#39;t have your agent bios done, said they would be finished later, and then you replied with &quot;Forget it&quot; is a pretty damn good reason. Besides, did it cross your mind that maybe the PGs missed it because they weren&#39;t on at the time, and when they saw it it had you saying &quot;forget it&quot; as the immediate next reply?

            <p>Wik is far too over the top to be a suitable PPC Agent character, and your writing shows a distinct tendency to attempt to push the boundaries way too far.

            <p>Since I&#39;ve noted of late a distressing tendency to forget a few things, I figure now is as good a time as any to remind everyone of them.<br><br>1/ The PPC does not condone torture. The only two instances of it in the Original Series are a) Jay&#39;s sockpuppets, and b) sending a &#39;Sue off with Miss Cam. In the final TOS mission, <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/Bip.html">No Way Back</a>, it is explicitly stated that &quot;you know Headquarters frowns on torture&quot;.<br><br>2/ Permission is granted to people so that they can participate in the world of the PPC. This is not a right -- it is a privilege. Certain forms of writing are allowed without formal Permission -- MSTs are outside the remit of the PPC, Fill the Plothole is non-canonical, and participation in RPs as minor characters is fine. Missions and large changes to the PPC canon are <b>not</b>. This hasn&#39;t been previously stated, but is in effect as of now.<br><br>3/ The PPC is first and foremost about the missions, not the massive events. I realise I&#39;m actually the one who started this trend, with the Reorganisation and now Crashing Down, but I also have 21 missions written and posted. It&#39;s fun to have RPs and plan massive attacks on or by the PPC, but that&#39;s <i>not what we&#39;re about</i>. The number of missions being written has dropped dramatically of late, and that&#39;s worrying.<br><br>4/ You don&#39;t need to come up with a quirk or shiny new concept to write your missions. Again, there is a tendency for people to want to make their mission stand out by doing something big -- be it a new Department, an uber-badfic, an arc plot, an obscure fandom, whatever. That&#39;s <i>not necessary</i>. I&#39;m reminded of, I think it was Artemis, who wrote the original DIA stories, and then stepped <u>back</u> and wrote <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ppcagents/main.html">Agent Aerilyn and Zera</a> in an effort to get closer to the spirit of the Original Series.<br><br>5/ Above all, the PPC is supposed to be FUN. We don&#39;t write these stories to slaughter &#39;Sues, that&#39;s the Agents&#39; motivations. <i>We</i> write them to entertain ourselves and one another. We do this with Agent-Agent interaction (yes, <i>that&#39;s</i> why they work in teams), Agent-Sue interaction (come on, who didn&#39;t find <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/whyamihere.html">Mr Socko</a> hilarious?), and Agent-picking-on-Sue action. That&#39;s what we&#39;re here for. That&#39;s why we keep reading.<br><br>So I&#39;m going to make a couple of suggestions. No, call them challenges. First up, I&#39;m going to point everyone to <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> and say that we all need to read it again. Everyone. That&#39;s it -- just read the series.<br><br>The second challenge is the tough one. For anyone who has a set of Agents (and has been granted Permission), even if you&#39;re in the middle of doing something else right now, I challenge you all to drop every dangling plot thread, massive project, everything, and <i>write a mission</i>. Write a mission which isn&#39;t connected to anything else. Backdate it if that makes it easier for you -- if your Agents are currently tied up in arc-plot angst, set it six months before that started. No foreshadowing, no plot relevance, no nothing -- just a plain, simple mission in whatever Department your Agents happen to be in. Or happen to have been in, if they&#39;re retired; I&#39;m going to try and put together a backdated Dafydd &amp; Selene mission, despite Dafydd&#39;s quitting a couple of years back.<br><br>Is everyone going to manage this? Of course not. But I hope everyone&#39;s going to <i>try</i>. And I do recommend completing the first challenge before the second -- it&#39;ll make it easier.<br><br>Hopefully this post will be taken in the right way -- I&#39;m trying to bring the PPC back to its roots, not attack anyone in particular (I promise you that I&#39;ve ignored most of these points at one time or another). Still, I&#39;m always here as a punching bag if someone gets too upset about it -- and provided you&#39;re not afraid of what my wife will do (you shooooould be...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>While Teh Awsum Drama is all very well, that&#39;s not what the PPC was made for.<br><br>As for your challenges...  I just finished reading TOS, but I&#39;m more than happy to do it again. I&#39;m sure my neighbours don&#39;t mind hearing me giggling like a loon at weird hours of the night. And I think the missions I&#39;ve done so far are pretty grass-roots... but if not, I&#39;ll put my effort into the one I&#39;m going to finish before the month is up.<br><br>And I apologise if my creating the MTFFAT was a litle overboard, I just liked the idea of someone wandering around trying to get people to be nice to their technology and constantly having to leg it because of their (predictable) reactions.<br><br>So... *attempts to nudge the microphone she&#39;s been using to record for the Movie out of sight* I&#39;ll get on that. Though my production duties will continue- I&#39;m the one who runs round poking everyone to do things, after all. Looks like we have something in common, hS.<br><br>*salutes* Sir, I accept your challenge with great pleasure! (And a bit of a groan, now that I have to actually find a Suefic to put into my mission, but I won&#39;t mention that.)</p>

            <p>I probably fouled up at least a few of these points, though thanks for the message. I didn&#39;t mean to offend, if I have. And yeah, I know this isn&#39;t directed at me, but I do feel like I&#39;m at least a little at fault (especially when I accidentally started that &quot;attack the Factory&quot; discussion), so I thought I&#39;d say something. Never know if you&#39;ve pissed someone off when you&#39;re only talking to them through a computer, heh. The only challenge of yours I can actually do at the moment is rereading the Original Series, but I&#39;ll go do that. Very well said post.</p>

            <p>For a while I started to wonder whether there was something wrong with the missions I wrote because none of them are part of any major plot arcs (most of them can even be read in random order; that&#39;s how unconnected to a plot arc they are).<br><br>That said. I&#39;d like to excuse myself from Challenge Two. At least until December. It&#39;s NaNo and I&#39;ve just plugged two missions on the board less than a week ago.</p>

            <p>Another thing about PPC canon: If it isn&#39;t in the Original Series, it&#39;s pretty much up to group consent. If everyone goes &quot;Oooh, yeah, that&#39;s awesome!&quot; then it can be canon. Otherwise, if I don&#39;t like something someone has done since the OS, I feel okay about ignoring it. I&#39;d go so far as to say that&#39;s a right. So, just because you have Permission doesn&#39;t mean that what you do is automatically going to be accepted by everyone. If it is, congratulations, but it isn&#39;t really something you should be expecting. Again, it&#39;s all in fun. If you want to make all the rules, write an original story in a world of your own.<br><br>As for me, I&#39;ve been trying to finish my current mission (which does contain angst, but it is mission-specific angst). It SHOULD happen sometime this year... And then I have a 2008 Invasion interlude to do, and then a FicPsych story, and before I <s>die</s> retire I really want to take on &quot;Subjugation,&quot; but other small missions will probably happen before that&#39;s done.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who might get more prolific when she&#39;s out of college, but then again, she might also drop off the face of the internet for the lack of money to afford it.

            <p>I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re saying this. I&#39;m slowly coming back from a really long hiatus caused by everyday Real Life things, and I&#39;m looking around and thinking, &quot;Wow...lotta stuff&#39;s happened.&quot; It&#39;s a little disorienting to come back and find out that there&#39;ve been a couple hundred additions and changes to PPC canon, as I&#39;m slowly finding out. <br><br>That said, I&#39;m gonna go read the Original Series, and then find the time to finish up that mission I started ages ago. And that little interlude, too. And then maybe write another interlude chock-full of character interaction and development, should I find the time.

            <p>... so do I have to drop that to do a mission? It&#39;s overdue as it is.<br><br>I kind of like the bog-standard missions more than the big complicated storylines (I don&#39;t think the TS set counts as a big complicated storyline so much as a bunch of missions stuck together) but I admit I&#39;m guilty of #1 - I did mention that my agents got in trouble for the Drip Rat and Redneck Tree deaths but didn&#39;t detail their punishment because I couldn&#39;t make that funny. Could also apply to the Nighthunt fiasco, unless HQ makes exception for characters who attempted to violate and/or consume PPC members.</p>

            <p>According to the wiki page, the discipline is either a reprimand (if used on a Sue) or outright expulsion (if used on another agent, and I assume it&#39;s the case if you&#39;re a multiple offender, too).</p>

            <p>Kitchen duty, Building Maintenance duty--anything menial and boring, really--a spell in FicPsych (they probably CAN adjust your personality if need be)...<br><br>But most likely, a total prohibition from all things Bleep in conjunction with missions just bad enough to make your fingers twitch for your Bleeprin without being so awful as to induce a homicidal rage. It would be easy to accomplish. An HQ-wide memo stating that these specific agents were not to be given any Bleep-stuff would likely result not in sympathy for the offenders, but in lots of pointing and laughing.

            <p>The fault was mine. I <i>was</i> an arrogant jerkass fanbrat who acted stupidly. Despite this, I am still, as Fanficrants would call it, butthurt. I put all my eggs into one basket, snacthed them back in less than 24 hours, and when I wanted to know why no one took them or smashed them, I asked why in a way that was both foolish and juvenile. Because of that, the shame from my Impertinence in trying to add to the PPC canon was coupled with the shame from my misdirected outrage. I could have taken those seperately*, but not together. I was ungreatful to my Internet hosts, and knowing how rare civility is in the Web, I can&#39;t forgive myself for that.<br><br>PS: I will however, return for special occasions.  <br><br>*Yes, I know I woudn&#39;t have had the second one if I was more patient.

Lots of us here have been a bit scary when it comes to certain topics (Such as that list of weapons I asked for a while ago), because we enjoy it. You won&#39;t be able to fix the reputation if you run though. It just gives us a bad feeling, and makes you feel like there&#39;s no lace for you here. All you need to do is actively post around here for a little longer, and you&#39;re good to go. That&#39;s all.

            <p>Okay, yes, you screwed up. Fine. So what? Running away doesn&#39;t do any good, and we&#39;re not the type to hold a grudge against anyone who&#39;s willing to try. If you leave now, your &#39;reputation&#39; (for lack of a better word) will stay exactly as it is. Stick around, be polite and engaging, and you&#39;ll earn the respect you wanted - and which, quite frankly, I think people around here want to give as soon as it&#39;s appropriate. Publically beating yourself over the head isn&#39;t something that either party wants - we take no pleasure from seeing you say &quot;I was wrong&quot; fifty different ways. </p>

            <p>Rest assured that I am a fairly experienced PPC boarder myself - I use &quot;The Nameless Admin&quot; for administrative posts rather than my usual username specifically to separate the two functions. I don&#39;t want people kowtowing to the usual me because I&#39;m also TNA, and I also don&#39;t want people to try to blackmail me. I got admin powers when the ypur invasion was going on, so I was trying to avoid being a target.<br><br>My identity isn&#39;t that big of a deal really, hiding behind TNA just gives me a touch of protection against the casual observer. With a little bit of research here on the board, I&#39;m sure you could work out who I am. Just please don&#39;t post it for the world to see, ok?<br><br>And no, I&#39;m not the SO. I&#39;m here in the real world, not in HQ. While a link does exist between the two, I am not it.<br><br>I, at least, am trying to not be something to be afraid of - I&#39;m just the janitor, cleaning up after the occasional idiot pours junk all over our nice shiny board. As for the SO, he&#39;s been posting every now and then for as long as I&#39;ve been on the board. He&#39;s certainly not harmless, but he&#39;s on our side.<br><br>I hope that helps.</p>

            <p>Hello all,<br><br>As I introduced myself a while ago, I&#39;m a returning member of the PPC after a long wandering journey through the internet. Anyway, since it seems it has grown considerably since I&#39;ve been gone, can anyone direct me to a general list of canon and what not? What stories should I read, and where should I start (I already read the original series, along with a few other early spin-offs, way back in the day). I also know there is a wiki, though I have not thoroughly combed it.<br><br>Thanks in advance<br>-Paladin</p>

            <p>In a fic I&#39;m sporking at the moment, Ron Weasley is turned into a girl and impregnated. We can use the Embryo Extraction Kit to take it out before we turn him back, but where do we put it afterwards? The fic has also turned the agents killing it into the opposite gender, so only one of them now has a uterus, and as soon as &quot;she&quot; leaves the fic he&#39;ll go back to being male. Should we take it out after they turn back? Does Doc Fitz have a tube or something to incubate it in?</p>

            <p>Not only that, but I&#39;m pretty sure the PPC does not condone killing infants. We kill Sues, yeah, but killing babies is just abhorrent.

            <p>Ron was, for various ridiculous and unexplained reasons, turned into a girl and transported to a weird alternate dimension which looks sort of like The Arabian Nights except everyone has Japanese names, ended up posing as a handmaiden to the Princess Sue, and was randomly raped by a guard (see, that&#39;s why guards in Real World harems were eunuchs). Doctor employed by the Princess heals &quot;her&quot; up and casts a spell to see if &quot;she&#39;s&quot; pregnant ... so actually it&#39;s a couple of hours, not a couple of days.

            <p>You&#39;d be best off checking with one of our resident biologists to see if sperm would have met egg after two hours, but I suspect not.<br><br>I would be interested to know how this spell to see if transgender!Ron is up the duff works. Again, we must turn to the biologists, but two hours after intercourse has taken place, there aren&#39;t really going to be any chemical or physical or hormonal differences in the body to detect. So unless this spell is basically a powerful microscope crowbarred into transgender!Ron&#39;s newly deflowered lady bits... You know what, I&#39;m not even going to finish that sentence. The mental images are getting too weird.<br><br>If the author&#39;s using this fic to broadcast her anti-abortion stance, then I&#39;m leaning even more towards the spiking option. However, there&#39;s an easier option. A ridiculously high proportion of pregnancies spontaneously abort, for a variety of reasons. I&#39;ll bet the mother changing gender would be a good enough reason.<br><br>Can we have a link to this trainwreck of a fic?</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ve heard something about that mentioned on the wiki, especially since embryos extracted by the kit and put in the nursery would have to be born <i>somehow</i>. It&#39;s a logical answer to the problem of not having a readily available surrogate mother, at least until one is found. I mean, in that kind of situation it&#39;s a choice between something like that or letting the embryo die, almost.</p>

I will not ask the new recruits to check outside and tell me what the weather’s like.  <br><br>836. I will not make a wish using any of Captain Dandy’s Weeds.  <br><br>837. If my remote activator is broken, I will not attempt to get out of a fic by clicking my heels together three times and saying, “There’s no place like home.”  <br>-My parents would not be amused if my partner and I suddenly appeared in the living room covered in glitter, carrying weapons, and dragging a Sue corpse.  <br><br>838. I will not discuss Feanor’s “family jewels”. <br><br>839. I will refrain from decorating my RC with vases filled with flowers.  <br>-Particularly freshly-cut ones.  <br>-It doesn’t matter if they weren’t sentient to begin with.  <br></li>

            <p>It&#39;s a Character Replacement. The Deku Tree, coupled with the power of the Forest Temple, would be enough to prevent the forest from burning. Additionally, while we do have Pyromaniacs in the PPC, they would have enough sense to put down wards and things.<br>Plus, the shape and size of the Character Replacement means the Agents themselves would be burnt if they directly set it on fire. It&#39;d be much better to chop down the tree first, which also gives enjoyment on the hacking and chopping level.</p>

            <p>After Thanksgiving, that is. x]<br><br>But I&#39;m going to put this pressie offer up for all my fellow PPC buddies--I&#39;d like to draw your Agents or yourself as a Christmas present! Simply put whether you&#39;d like a pic of you, your Agents, or you with your Agents. Give me a description, or better yet, links to any existing images.Then specify whether you&#39;d like color or not. After that, put down if you&#39;d like me to do icons off of the pic and with what sayings. Finally, drop off your email if you want me to send it to you personally. <br><br>If anyone want the original pic, email me at <a href="mailto:lilywinterwood@gmail.com">lilywinterwood@gmail.com</a> with your address. I swear I will just use that for sending you shinies and piccies. Really. <br><br>~Lily Winterwood<br><br>Posted <a href="http://lily-winterwood.livejournal.com/9032.html?view=25672#t25672">here</a> originally.</p>

            <p>Um, pretty please? I, er, suck at drawing the people that come out of my head. I can draw other people, sometimes, but... not them. x.X<br><br>I&#39;d feel all guilty going &#39;draw me something!&#39; and not giving anything in return, though... hm. Well, I&#39;m good at drawing things that aren&#39;t people, though it tends to take me a while, and I&#39;m pretty good at writing, so if you want something along those lines, consider me at your service. <br>...I can also sing stuff. I&#39;m still working with my computer on that front, but if you come up with something you want sung by a mezzo-soprano (I think that&#39;s the technical term), let me know. =P<br><br>So yeah.<br>Um.<br>Right. Agents Katrina and Samuel. I don&#39;t think we need me in the mix; that could get... <i>interesting</i>. Kat&#39;s short, athletic, with mid-length curly strawberry-blonde hair that&#39;s usually braided; Samuel is tall, somewhat lanky, with long black hair simply tied back. White streaks at his temples, silver bracelet on his right wrist. PPC uniforms are nifty. They do have a ypur, if you have spare time, room, and get bored. :P<br><br>...there are no existing images. Color would be awesome if you have time. Icons... I want to say yes but I don&#39;t want to add to your workload, and I have no idea what I&#39;d do with them anyway.<br><br>Hm, about the picture... I have this image in my mind of Samuel sitting near the console reading a book and Kat bugging him in some manner, but I&#39;m not wedded to it. (That would be awkward.) <br><br>Look, ma, no more wall of text! =D </p>

Searches for their names/nicknames and &quot;PPC&quot; within the gallery should turn up all the results you need. (I might just make a PPC folder while I&#39;m thinking about it, too.)

            <p>Awesome, thanks Lily.If I could draw, I&#39;d do an exchange, but my stick men gt made fun of by other stick men...<br>I currently have three Agents, Arti, Lunac and Liadan. Lunac and Arti have very basic descriptions on the Wiki, but I can provide more info if you need it.<br>Liadan, on the other hand, will have to be created. Hmm... I&#39;ll get back to you!</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t mind original fic or fanfic. Assuming I know the fandom. I have some slight issues with short stories, but I&#39;m working around that.</p>

            <p>Cos then I&#39;ll probably ask you for some nice, funny fic involving all the members of the Fellowship. Just something cute and light, a &quot;light in dark times&quot; sort of thing.

            <p>I&#39;m not going to tear your spleen out if you don&#39;t go by the book. But that&#39;s probably because I think the movies are just as awesome as the books. Of course, the books are more awesome, but...whatever. <br><br>Funny, I&#39;m reading LotR right now. *grin*</p>

            <p>Just a question first, if that&#39;s okay. When does this expire? I&#39;m asking because, while I&#39;m interested, I don&#39;t have Permission yet and therefore my agents don&#39;t technically exist yet (and while I do have their bios and stuff, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d be allowed to request for this without it anyway. It&#39;s not a mission, but having agents implies having a spinoff, which you <i>do</i> need it for. A bit of a hazy area), and I was going to try again either late November or early December (before Christmas). Naturally, if the offer expires before that, I would be up the creek without a paddle, so I just thought I would ask, thank you for your time.</p>
