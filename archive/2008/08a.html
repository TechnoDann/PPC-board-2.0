            <p>As I said on Fichunter&#39;s thread just now, I&#39;m finally going to take the plunge and apply for Permission, but there are a couple of things I need to know first.<br><br>1. Can I claim <a href="08a%3Fuser_id=16.html"><a href="http://striga-kun.deviantart.com/art/1-The-Girl-Who-Shouldn-t-81217488">http://striga-kun.deviantart.com/art/1-The-Girl-Who-Shouldn-t-81217488</a></a>&gt;this piece of schtick? The &#39;Sue is awful, and when it turned up on Pottersues, I hated it beyond belief.<br><br>2. Would it be permissible to post something that isn&#39;t fiction <i>per se</i> for my writing sample? The reason I ask this is because I have no fanfiction at all, but I have an essay that I&#39;ve written - it&#39;s <a href="08a%3Fuser_id=16.html"><a href="http://wilver-and-ecru.livejournal.com/3293.html#cutid1">http://wilver-and-ecru.livejournal.com/3293.html#cutid1</a></a>&gt;here if you&#39;re interested. Basically, it&#39;s the only thing I can think of to use as a writing sample, since everything else I&#39;ve written makes me cringe.<br><br>Also, could anyone who helped voice the PPC radio play tell me how you did the voices for the Flowers? I want to start voicing my parts as soon as possible, but I can&#39;t if I don&#39;t know how to do this. Thanks! </p>

<li>Yes.<br><br>2. Not sure, I think a PG would have to rule on this.<br><br>And as to the last bit, just record the lines normally. I didn&#39;t do the effects for the Flowers parts in the radio plays until after I put the scene completely together. So leave that for Trojie or Cassie to do, I&#39;d say.</li>

            <p>Acutally, I went on another fantasy generator that I knew, found some totally ridiculous characters (one was from a generator specifically designed for fangirl-lust-objects, which should tell you something), and wrote the first chapter of a rather pointless fantasy adventure.<br><br>It shall be posted on Fictionpress (the original-work sister site of the Pit), to see how many people realise it as being clichйd dreck, and how many think it&#39;s omg!gud riting. <br><br>Mostly because I&#39;m bored. :) I still love Heist the porcupine, though. </p>

            <p>I figured I should introduce myself, so:<br><br>Hello! I&#39;m Wandering Critic, WC for short, and I, um, wander and criticize. Specifically, I criticize badfic, sometimes very extensively — I&#39;m somewhat notorious on FFN for writing critiques that are longer than the original story. I also have a <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/wanderingcritic">website</a> so I don&#39;t have to explain the proper use of the period to every lousy writer individually, and a rather widely ignored <a href="http://wanderingcritic.wordpress.com">blog</a> where I rant about Sues and badfic.<br><br>Let me see... I&#39;m probably a lousy fit for the board culture here because I don&#39;t giggle, don&#39;t enjoy silliness all that much, take writing way too seriously, and have a generally crabby personality. Don&#39;t bother giving me stuff beginning with &quot;P&quot; because I&#39;ll just hold a virtual yard sale and price, peddle, and profit from it. Also, I don&#39;t layer what I say in a dozen disclaimers like &quot;this is just my opinion, but...&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings...&quot; and tend to have little respect for anyone who would disintegrate into a sobbing pile of hurt feelings if such phrases were omitted. Oh, and I believe that an opinion most certainly <i>can</i> be wrong: consider the number of people who hold the opinion that capital letters, punctuation, and paragraphs are unnecessary in their fanfic writing. So now you know the worst about me.<br><br>Aside from having the personality of a wood rasp, I try to be useful, I <i>do</i> have a sense of humor (it just runs to really bad puns or jokes so subtle that nobody gets them), I write fanfic (though not under any name that could be connected to this identity), and I&#39;ve been a PPC fan for a couple of years. It&#39;s hard to say what fandoms I prefer because I&#39;ll snark any badfic that holds still long enough (to the point of watching hours of TV shows I&#39;d never seen before to get the background for a good sporking), but in general I lean towards classic fantasy, hard SF, military themes in general, and I passionately hate vampires. I&#39;m a canon purist, I overwhelmingly prefer gen, and I&#39;m still pretty much a literary (rather than media) fan. I&#39;ll shovel through mountains of suck to find one single gem of a story, because it&#39;s <i>so</i> worth it when you find one of the good ones. Aside from proper writing and fact-checking, I take very little seriously, particularly not myself.<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s me, warts and all, for whatever that&#39;s worth.<br></p>

            <p>Somehow I knew there was going to be a plover in my future.

            <p>After going through your website (Well, the FAQ, anyway. I don&#39;t actually feel the need to read up on all the basic rules of English), as well as the first three (or four?) entries on your blog, I have to say I&#39;m pretty glad you came here, because you seem like a pretty cool person.<br><br>And I think leaving scathing/blunt reviews on stories is actually a lot better than just -killing- them or sporking them or MSTing them without warning. If you leave a crit, telling them exactly what&#39;s wrong with their story, it actually gives them the chance to fix the problems, and redeem themselves. Just laughing about it behind their backs, and sporking it as though they were writing purely out of malice, always seems a bit... nasty.<br><br>There&#39;s actually a lot more I&#39;d like to say to you, but I doubt my boss will be impressed with &quot;internets&quot; as an excuse for being half an hour late.

            <p>Thanks for the welcome. The psychic paper and the sniper rifle seem useful. I&#39;ve read quite a few of TOS in the past, and I&#39;m now enjoying many delightful moments browsing the wiki. I never dreamed there were quite so many Flowers.<br><br>No worries about the legendary badfic. I&#39;ve not only survived quite a few of the ones listed, but I&#39;ve read through <i>The Eye of Argon</i> in one sitting, with no ... accidents (though I doubt I could safely read it aloud). Writing has to be very, very good to creep me out or otherwise squick me; I just laugh uproariously at the bad stuff.<br><br>Oh, one thing I left out of my intro: Due to a traumatic incident at an anime con, I have an auditory allergy to squeeing. This may explain a lot about why I took up sporking as a hobby.</p>

            <p>Not the worst, by far, but it&#39;s definitely sporking material. After the squeeing reviews already up there, the author may be badly traumatized by mine (and should be grateful that I&#39;m quite busy and didn&#39;t have time to give her story a thorough going-over). Y&#39;know, I really should write a blog post about the people who see the whole world through their teenage perspective and have no concept that there is anything else out there, and who turn <i>everything</i> into a bad teen romance novel. I miss the old days; now, when the overwhelming majority of fanfic is written by semi-literate teenage girls who have never read a book in their lives, this stuff is the rule rather than the exception.</p>

            <p>People online have got the (mainly accurate, sadly) opinion that all teenagers hate reading, are addicted to textspeak and just want to get in to [lust object of choice here]&#39;s pants. I get a lot of teasing from my peers when they read my social-network-thing page, simply because it is written in plain English. Admittedly, I did put a big notice reading &#39;If you&#39;re going to comment in chatspeak, don&#39;t comment at all&#39; on my profile, but I feel that&#39;s justifiable.

            <p>Having survived it myself, I can say that the one good thing about being a teenager is that you eventually grow out of it. As for the people who rag on you for writing correctly, remember that you can <i>always</i> write like an ignorant twit if you want to — but it&#39;s doubtful that they can write like anything <i>but</i>. Don&#39;t tell anyone you&#39;re 14 and they&#39;ll never know. :)<br><br>ne1 cn uz chatspeak but just u w8 til ur peerz try 2 get jobz :)</p>

            <p>Well...here goes nothing. *deep breath*<br><br>Alright. I&#39;ll start with my agents.<br><br>Agent Ecru is pretty jaded - she reckons she&#39;s seen most of the worst stuff in fanfiction. Reading Celebrian, she says, counts, even if she doused at least five pints of Bleeprin afterwards. At some point during her PPC career, she acquired some massive guns, and she&#39;s slightly bitter about not being able to use them in the Harry Potter fandom. She&#39;s somewhere in her mid-to-late twenties, with shortish brown hair. She wers glasses, and is slightly plump. <br><br>Agent Avada is incredibly hyper, to the point of extreme annoyance. Ecru attributes this to having to much sugar in her tea. She&#39;s pretty protective of Snape, and tries to claim the rights of any &#39;Sue that abuses his character. She&#39;s tall, with black hair and brown eyes, and a rather high-pitched voice.<br><br>Both are going to be working in the Harry Potter fandom, Department of Mary-Sues. A sample of my writing is <a href="08a%3Fuser_id=16.html">here</a>. While not fanfiction as such, it&#39;s pretty fandom related and I&#39;m pretty proud of it.<br><br>The fic I&#39;d like to claim is <a href="08a%3Fuser_id=16.html">this</a> monstrosity. Ever since I saw it on Pottersues, I&#39;ve been itching to give it its just deserts,and I can&#39;t wait to get started on it.<br><br>Apologies for the rushed writing<br>Lynxihez</p>

            <p>Um. <br>Okay. This is both good news (ish) and bad news and both of them I&#39;m only posting here because I&#39;ve seen other people doing so. The Good News Ish is that, by dint of today being August 3rd, I am now a thirteen-year-old; or, more exactly, will be in *looks at clock* about four hours. React as you see fit. (This birthday may also result in me getting a LiveJournal, as no longer I&#39;ll have to lie about my age, but we&#39;ll see.)<br>The bad news is that I still haven&#39;t gotten my act together to ask Permission. I wanted to do so before my birthday, but ah well.<br>And, a note: this would also be the birthday of my agent-to-be, Ciri. She&#39;d be 14, though she&#39;s born on the same day as me. Just an FYI.<br>*suddenly realizes what she&#39;s saying* Omigods. I&#39;m a TEENAGER! <br>As I said, react as you see fit ^^<br><br>:)<br>C<br></p>

I have no idea why not, since Squid is a perfect name.<br><br>So, I entreat all the Boarders for suggestions since I can&#39;t think of any and I&#39;m trying to stick with a nautical/marine type theme to go with our other dog, Sailor.<br><br>I have already told Trojie I am not going to name the dog &quot;Captain&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Sparrow&quot;, or any combination of those, or after any of the main characters of PotC, and have already downed her suggestion of &quot;Earendil&quot;.

            <p>I like &quot;Pilot&quot; for non-nautical reasons all my own, but then there&#39;s the Japanese &quot;Anjin.&quot; That&#39;s what they call John Blackthorne in &quot;Shogun,&quot; because they can&#39;t pronounce his name. {= )<br><br>If you want to name him after an awesome character from a relatively obscure fantasy epic, you could call him Saltheart Foamfollower or Pitchwife. Of course, you might then want to read &quot;The [First, Second, and Third] Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever,&quot; if you haven&#39;t. It&#39;s worth the author&#39;s redundant and sometimes condescending prose, and the main character[s]&#39;s unrelenting angst, to get to know some of the other people in the world.<br><br>Um... there&#39;s Nautilus or Urchin or Limpet or something like that... Oh, I know! Pagoo, after Pagoo the Hermit-Crab. ^_^ Or maybe Sebastian, which I think is actually a cool name.<br><br>Someone said Kraken... following the train of thought, there&#39;s Leviathan, Selkie, Narwhal, Triton, Neptune, Odysseus, Ulysses, Argo[naut]...<br><br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got right now.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It was the author&#39;s style that bothered me the most, though. Curiosity (sometimes morbid) and the fact that the supporting cast is awesome carried me through.

            <p>300 is a standalone canon, as many things were introduced into the (very much true) story in order to make it a modern myth. And it was written by Frank Miller, not Homer or any of that lot. So I don&#39;t think it would be the same mini as for Greek Legends.</p>

            <p>The Battle of Thermopylae was true enough, it&#39;s just that many societies in Greek, particularly the Spartans, exaggerated the story afterwards, often stetching the number of people involved to make the Greeks look better. Eventally it became a legend to the Greeks, which means it has a core of truth to it. However, because the events were so vastly exaggerated, it became one of Greece&#39;s mainstream war myths.</p>

            <p>This suethor has written 30+ stories and they are almost all rewrites of some popular movie with added Sue. Sometimes she mashes two together.<br><br>And her profile ... over 800 LINES of &quot;favorite&quot; movie quotes (methinks she&#39;s a bit unclear on the concept of favorites). Profiles of all her OC&#39;s. Some MySpace-like comments. But, as usual, no hint that she&#39;s ever read an actual book. That makes the one good thing about her rather surprising.<br><br>On the plus side (as I noted at the end of my rather slapped-together review) she can construct a valid English sentence, which seems to be a rare skill nowadays. It&#39;s not enough to save &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit &amp; Mary Sue in Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; though.</p>

            <p>Good luck finding enough of a &#39;Sue to kill. All the author does is retell the movie from the OC&#39;s point of view--the OC barely does anything except angst over Gromit and snog him at the end. It&#39;s really insipid and boring. {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Any fic which abruptly includes the line &quot;then he shot a beam from his paw which the rat teleported away from&quot; is going to be classic badfic. What got me about that line was how matter-of-fact it is, like we shouldn&#39;t be surprised at all that they can do this even though there&#39;s no AU tag and hardly any hints of magic up to this point ...<br><br>And then there was the part where Leif declares that his female sidekick needs protecting because, quote, &quot;She is a seventeen-year-old girl she is bound to be assaulted and raped sooner or later eh&quot;, which sent my inner feminist on a rampage.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;m new around here. Pretty obviously, I think. But I&#39;ve been lurking around the PPC sites for a while, and I&#39;ve finally given up the whole lurking thing. I mean, in the long run, it&#39;s not all that productive.<br><br>And besides. These ... er ... <i>stories</i> that I recently encountered need to be dealt with. I&#39;m pretty certain they qualify as badfic, and what the one girl is doing to Jade... it makes me want to burn something.<br><br>So, fresh from the world of Auldrant come these two &quot;gems&quot;.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4448219/1/">karins past</a><br><br>and<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983354/1/">Blind love</a><br><br>Both are located on FF-net - I believe I&#39;ve heard it affectionately referred to as &quot;the Pit of Voles.&quot;<br><br>I actually read through them both in their entirety. Stupid, but I do stupid stuff sometimes.<br><br>*whimper* Hide me. Before something has to die. Please.<br><br>Oh yeah, and I&#39;m Makari. Hi.</p>

            <p>&quot;karins past&quot; is possibly the worst use of 460 words I have ever seen, and I&#39;m including the spam posted below. I have seen better trollfics.

I have seen better stories in a bowl of Alpha-Bits.<br><br>The review I posted there may be my all-time harshest review, but then again, if this was bad in some really creative way, and big enough to care about, it would be in the running for the all-time worst (or at least stupidest) story.

            <p>It&#39;s bad, yeah, but bad in kind of an incompetent, boring sort of way. It&#39;s hard to reach a truly legendary level of awfulness in so few words. While the writing is abysmal, the real badness of the story is that there isn&#39;t really any story down there. That&#39;s why I said it&#39;s unsalvageable: fix the broken writing and you have a story that is, basically, &quot;these two people find a kid in the woods, take him home, and put him to bed.&quot; It&#39;s a scene, not a story, and it&#39;s a lame scene at that. There just isn&#39;t enough of it to compete on the same level as the likes of Celebrian and Subjugation. It&#39;s a Mini-Cooper full of fail, or maybe just a roller skate, but the Legendary Badfics are tractor-trailers running overweight with full loads of fail.</p>

            <p>My Agents are Agent Lily and Christianne, and they work in the Mary Sue Department. Christianne is a veteran, but Lily is a newbie. They go through one mission in the Harry Potter division, then get transferred to LotR. <br><br>Lily is the result of a cloning experiment on a Random Elleth. But that&#39;s odd, because the two have opposite personalities. Lily is considerably more insane and flake-y. And she worships chocolate, coffee, and the Canon. She can pull together enough of what&#39;s left of her sanity during missions, but she&#39;s Hell on wheels at HQ. Never give her a flamethrower. Or Sparkly Shiny Things(tm), because Sparkly Shiny Things bring out the Gollum-like behavior, which in turn is a prelude to more insanity. She likes giving people annoying nicknames, reading, MST-ing, and drawing. Her lust object is Frodo Baggins, and oddly, Dark Haired!Legolas.<br>Eye color: blue<br>Hair color: black<br>Species: Elf, Lord of the Rings type.<br>Canon Literacy Level (CLL): Harry Potter (ok) LotR (semi-Tolkien nut) <br><br>Christianne Shieh was recruited from Real Life. She&#39;s a snarky b*tch with sadistic tendencies, and probably the only thing to get yourself on her good side is to give her nutty dark chocolate. Surprisingly enough, she and Lily get along considerably better than other Agents. She also harbors an intense dislike for dresses, Mary Sues, and especially Mary Suvian dresses. She has no known lust object. <br>Christianne, as mentioned before, is a veteran of &#39;Sue Slaying, having worked in the HP and Naruto divisions. She was moved from Naruto to HP because her partner died, and then assigned to Lily after her partner in the HP division also died. Then, she and Lily are transferred because of a MS fic overload (poor Middle-Earth!). While working in the Naruto section, Christianne learned how to use Japanese weapons. She often tries to demand a license from Upstairs to use them regardless of which division she is in, though the answer is always NO for a good reason. Never give HER a flamethrower, either, because of her obsession with dealing cruel punishments to Mary Sues.<br>Eye color: green<br>Hair color: black<br>Species: Homo sapiens (Human)<br>CLL stat: Naruto (somewhat of a know-it-all) HP(okay) LotR (I read the Canon only ONCE just so I can kill the &#39;Sues)<br><br>Writing Sample <br><br>(taken from &quot;Andi Black&quot;, the first mission)<br>At one o’clock, Christianne appeared back in the dorm, soaked in blood but grinning, full of job satisfaction. Lily was sitting in her four-poster bed, playing around with a French baguette. Every so often, it would emit a “prrrrp” sound and would transform into something else. <br>“What’s that?” asked Christianne, her curiosity piqued by the baguette, which was now a rubber duck. <br>Lily’s eyes widened. “What, you’ve never heard of D.O.R.K.S?”<br>“Dorks?”<br>“No, no, no!” exclaimed Lily, waving the rubber ducky, now a science textbook, in the air, causing it to turn into a table lamp and then a Harry Potter plushie. “It’s D.O.R.K.S. It stands for ‘Disguise-Outfitting Ryticular Kostume System’. Oh…and it’s the apple of Makes-Things’ eye. We better be careful with it.”<br>“One itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny question. Why is ‘costume’ spelled ‘Kostume’?”<br>“Search me.” Lily pressed something on the plushie, now a Rubik’s Cube ™. She promptly turned into the splitting image of Adalora Black. “How do I look?” she asked Christianne, who backed into another bed. <br>“Scary.” That was all Christianne could say.<br><br>(taken from &quot;What, Mary Sues Can Read?&quot;, one of my LotR fanfics on FF.net)<br>Well…Tolkien must be rolling around in his grave so much by now that if someone harnessed the raw energy he produced, then that person could provide enough energy for an entire neighborhood for almost a year. Talk about going green. For even as he laid in his coffin, rolling around restlessly, these four aberrations of original characters were drawing dangerously close to the hidden valley where the Last Homely House lay, its occupants unaware of their existence. Canon was going on smoothly as usual, and the characters had no worries regarding these four girls. They could hardly be blamed, since the One Ring was in Imladris at that moment, and the Council was already in progress. As Gandalf got up to share his tale, about ten leagues away the four ‘Sues were riding on their equally freakish horses, laughing and talking like friends do.<br><br>So...that&#39;s my little bit. If you need more of my writings to decide on whether you should give me Permission or not, tell me.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s what I think Lily&#39;s origins should be now...<br>~~~<br>&quot;Let go of me, you vile--&quot; screamed Eledhwen Elerossiel as two workers at the Mary Sue Factory #1203 shoved her into a clear tube. <br>They laughed at her. These dimwitted factory workers did not understand Westron, but the look of sheer hatred on the elleth&#39;s face told them the message anyways. <br>&quot;Labo vi Orodruin,&quot; Eledhwen spat as they closed the glass door and started pressing random buttons. Then the bumbling fools stood to the side and cackled appreciatively. They would soon have another Mary Sue bearing the likeness of the foul-mouthed elleth standing in the tube. <br>Little did they know that they pressed a wrong button. When pressing the buttons for the clone&#39;s personality, they had pressed all the personality buttons contradictory to those of Eledhwen&#39;s persona. But of course, these were people with an IQ so low they made orcs look smart. They could only look on in surprise as a spitting image of Eledhwen Elerossiel emerged, but this elleth seemed to be more...happy?<br>The new elleth laughed a rather insane-sounding laugh before exclaiming, &quot;I&#39;m alive! And so are the Fuzzy Pink Bunnies!&quot;<br>~~~<br>Eledhwen Elerossiel is the name of an elleth in my story &quot;Tales of a Nightmare Come True&quot;. She hates Mary Sues with a fierce passion ever since the &#39;Sue in the story &quot;Never Leave Fanfiction Lying Around&quot; (Crazyroninchic&#39;s creation, so my story is a spin off of it) had her be a servant to the vile, disgusting, and overall sordid excuse for an original character.  </p>

            <p>What if Eledhwen somehow escaped to the PPC from the Factory?

            <p>Thanks for pointing out the problems...I shall fix them!<br><br>And HQ works in mysterious ways, do they not? I suspect with the understaffing problems, they have to resort to the theory of duplicating people&#39;s genes. My theory goes to think that something went wrong while they were duplicating the personality of the victim. I&#39;m inclined to think that some mad scientists or maybe an apprentice or assistant of sorts for Makes-Things (Though I have a slight feeling he does not need apprentices or assistants) got the whole idea to create a cloning machine and botches it all up. <br>Besides (though this sounds very weak...), I like elves. I think they do need a little insanity amongst their ranks, too. (as if the &quot;Tra-la-la-lally&quot; song isn&#39;t undignified enough...)     </p>

            <p>Hi Lily, me again. I don&#39;t mean to sound over-picky, but it seems to me that the understaffing problem is not really bad enough to warrant cloning, especially since Agents recruit bit characters, replacements and dead canons reasonably frequently, not to mention breeding their own little Agents (ah, the pitter-patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots). If she&#39;s a clone, it probably didn&#39;t happen in the PPC, put it that way :). Cloning experiments are the kind of thing that the Mary Sue Factories do ... not us. <br><br>Other than that, she sounds pretty cool as a character.</p>

            <p>Who&#39;s really not to say that some crazy person from a MS factory infiltrated HQ? Just wondering. <br>But if that&#39;s out of the question, then I think that the MS factory people abducted the Random Elleth and cloned her. Something went wrong with the machine, and there is a personality change in the clone. Said clone gets a new (un-Elvish, of course) name...Lily. The factory then try to send her through a portal, but the bumbling nincompoops that work in this factory bungle up the whole thing and accidentally open a portal to HQ. <br>Or if that&#39;s not that convincing, then maybe they send her in as a bit character and the PPC recruit her because she only had one line or something as minor. </p>

            <p>I wanted to see how you would answer the questions before saying it, Lily, but the cloning thing made me think of the Mary-Sue Factories right away. Trojie said it: it&#39;s not really the kind of thing the PPC does. I&#39;d explain her origins another way.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>They&#39;ve taken over for M-T since his death in the macrovirus crisis.  Techno-Dann is one of them.  But I can&#39;t see DoSAT doing cloning experiments.  That might be more the style of the Department of Mary-Sue Experiments.<br><br>There are also some rogues, like my Agent April and her ex-partner Van Lew, who have advanced scientific knowledge but don&#39;t get along with DoSAT or DMSE.  <br><br>Or she could be the product of a botched crossover between, say, Star Wars and LOTR.  </p>

            <p>Aside from the DORKS, they can use more mundane methods.  Dye their hair some outrageous color.  Get colored contacts to change their eye color.  Put on copious amounts of make-up and outlandish, impractical clothes.  Make up a long, involved, fruity name, and be sure to tell everyone.  Most of all, act like the &#39;Sue type they&#39;re emulating.  Mostly, it would come down to acting.  Even if they went without disguises, they could pull off Goth!Sue (from all the black) or Average!Sue (when they look normal but are still speshul).  As July said, it&#39;s all in the attitude.  <br><br>Of course, it&#39;s much more fun to dress up.</p>

            <p>That it&#39;s not the appearance that makes a Sue.<br><br>But the actions. <br><br>So arrogance and confidence and probably a touch of makeup would work for a disguise.<br><br>And besides, I&#39;ve found that so long as you /look/ like you know what you&#39;re doing and where you&#39;re going, people are less likely to interfere.

            <p>My suggestion would be Agents from the HP Continuum, with Polyjuice Potion, Agents who are capable of turning into things anyway (I.e.: Paddebrains)or those capable of altering the perception of others through illusions and the like.<br><br>Assuming Sues aren&#39;t resistant to having their minds controlled (Doubtful, none of them seem to have a mind anyway), then Agents with psychic powers will be able to attend as well, by using their powers to change how others percieve them. Downer to this is that some Psychic Sues may notice, but Agent Lunac has several devices from the Pokemon World which block psychic powers.<br>And lastly, but not least, you can always have the Agents who don&#39;t fit into any of the above categories to simply be invisible. </p>

            <p>Since I&#39;ve only been here a few days, it&#39;s obviously too soon to summon a Permission Giver. However, for entertainment value and possible future reference, here is a writing sample introducing Agent Katty and her new partner, Agent Recruit Ace, from the Department of Floaters.<br><hr>
<br>The young man hesitated at the door. <i>My first assignment. My first partner.</i> He wasn&#39;t quite sure why he was so nervous. What could happen that the Academy hadn&#39;t prepared him for? Admittedly the Academy hadn&#39;t been what he&#39;d expected — who would expect a week of reading manuals in a disused office with a ventilator that dripped? — but the big daisy had told him that he was learning everything he needed to know. He looked at the door. 207. That was definitely the number on his assignment card. He hitched his duffel bag a bit on his shoulder, took a deep breath, and knocked.<br><br>&quot;Come!&quot; a female voice called from inside. The door slid open and the young man stepped in for the first sight of his new home.<br><br>He looked around the room, his eyes passing over assorted clutter, for the source of the voice. A pair of black boots were propped on the overstuffed arm of a rather ratty-looking couch that was big enough to conceal the boots&#39; occupant. The boots quickly retracted and swung to the floor and the head and body of the attached Agent popped up. She had hair of some indeterminate shade between brown and blonde, eyes that were trying to make up their mind whether to be green or brown, and he couldn&#39;t guess her age, though she seemed to be older than he was. She stood, revealing black chinos stuffed into what seemed to be riding boots, and a green T-shirt with the Slytherin house crest on it. At a guess, she was an inch or two taller than his own five foot six.<br><br>&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Agent Katherine Brown,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;Agent Recruit Ace Chang,&quot; he replied, and Katty raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yeah, Ace is my real name,&quot; he said somewhat defensively. &quot;My sister is Deuce, and my kid brother is Trey. My parents didn&#39;t have much imagination, okay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, no need to get testy. I&#39;m Katty, thanks to my little sister.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No problem, Agen... er, Katty. Where do I put my things?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The bunks are through that door.&quot; She pointed to one he hadn&#39;t yet noticed. &quot;Mine&#39;s the top one. Bathroom is that other door. Go ahead and toss your stuff in there. With our luck, we&#39;ll probably get a mission before you&#39;ve even got your gear stowed.&quot;<br><br>The bunk room turned out to be a narrow room, sectioned off from the main room by a wall that the builder hadn&#39;t even bothered to drywall on this side. The bunk bed was in the middle, with a closet of sorts behind a curtain at each end. Several boards nailed between the exposed studs held books. The right-side closet was empty of anything but a cheap closet organizer. Spare black jeans went on hangers, clean black T-shirts went on the wire shelves, and, after a moment&#39;s thought, he peeled off his leather jacket and hung it on a hook. The last thing in his duffelbag was his set of official PPC Agent Manuals. He shelved them on an unoccupied board, tossed the empty duffelbag into the closet, and stretched out on his bunk to relax. That was clearly the wrong thing to do, as he was informed by a whistling beep from the main room. <i>A mission!</i> He bounced to his feet and popped out of the bunkroom.<br><br>Katty, holding a half-eaten bagel, was staring at the console with a look of disgust. <br><br>&quot;Food detector.

            <p>Uh. Yeah. Greetings, I come in peace. Probably, anyway.<br><br>I&#39;ve been lurking on PPC sites for...a really long time, but the board was, for some odd reason, not one of those websites.<br><br>So, I&#39;m Anity, and this is my pet spork Laura, &quot;rescued&quot; from a Taco Bell utensil bin thingy. She is my second one-  my original pet spork, Bob, was lost in the recent move and I have yet to find him, alas. He lived on my dresser; Laura lives on my computer desk, and utilizes camouflage to avoid detection. (She&#39;s black plastic, she sits on the black base of my monitor.)<br><br>Alrighty then. Random Me Facts. I&#39;m an obsessive fan of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, demonstrated by regular posting on her website&#39;s forum and the fact that I&#39;m always reading at least one of her books.<br><br>I read constantly, and there are always three or more books in progress. I also write, but not quite so reliably.<br><br>I love the rain, and am one of those crazy people who runs around outside at midnight without shoes on.<br><br>I can watch moving water or fire forever. This can cause problems, as demonstrated by today&#39;s bike ride- I kept getting distracted by the shiny water falls and creeks, then sliding down small cliffs (only a few feet!). Long story short, I&#39;ve got a lot less blood than when I woke up this morning.<br><br>I like reading and memorizing poetry, like The Highwayman, and The Lady of Shalott. I also write poetry, but I can&#39;t speak for its quality and I won&#39;t pretend to.<br><br>I can rant on for quite a while, as seen above. And I&#39;m gonna shut up and wait for comments now.<br></p>

            <p>YES! More rain lovers! I give you a welcome gift - RAIN!<br><br>Actually, it&#39;s running water. One of those self-contained mini-environments that has a river flowing up and down hills and lifted by water-wheel to return to the beginning.

            <p>It&#39;s always good to find another person who can&#39;t be in a rain shower without dancing! And another Atwater-Rhodes fan (love her vamps)! And distracted by moving shinys! And a poetry nut!<br><br>I think maybe I love you. XDD<br><br>Speaking of which, you heard Loreena McKennitt&#39;s song version of The Highwayman? She leaves out a few stanzas, but otherwise it&#39;s fantastic! I&#39;ve always found that having a tune to the words makes memorizing much easier. And have you read John Masefield? His sea poems sometimes make me wonder if he didn&#39;t have a little of Tolkien&#39;s sea longing himself...<br><br>And now for the obligatory gift: the egg whisk! It&#39;s shiny, gold-plated, and it whisks eggs! Feel free to use on spambots and other nasties!<br><br>Welcome to the insanity!</p>

            <p>Yay! <br><br>Yep, I&#39;m a Loreena McKennitt fan as well, thanks to my dad. That song&#39;s quite good, though I prefer the song/poem Bonny Swans...which demonstrates how morbid I can be. (If you don&#39;t get that, google &quot;Bonny Swans&quot; or &quot;Bonny Swans lyrics&quot;.)<br><br>Rain is meant for dancing, and running, and getting wet in, and sometimes staring at and listening to. No one else seems to agree with me there, but it *is*.<br><br>Like I said, I&#39;m an obsessive fan of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, Kiesha&#39;ra and vamps.<br><br>Shinys....prettyful shiny whisky thingy...</p>

            <p>This can all be attributed to me going to a Beethoven concert last Sunday. While I will not deny that Beethoven is quite the epitome of awesome (Tchaikovsky, who was also involved, isn&#39;t half bad either) I felt my mind wandering a bit as the music played... and played. You really don&#39;t notice how long a piece can go until there&#39;s no &#39;fast-forward&#39; button.<br><br>Anyway, I remembered fondly my own orchestra days, and my brain turned to the PPC as is its wont. So here&#39;s the idea: an orchestra comprised of various members of the PPC, available for weddings, funerals, marches and whoever else asks for them.<br><br><u>Current information:</u> the PPC Symphony Orchestra, or Picso as it is affectionately known (or rather, because agents get lazy and like acronyms) is currently open to all PPC agents with musical talent or an interest in it. The orchestra contains all sections found in a normal orchestra - woodwind, strings, brass, percussion - with a large group marked &#39;other&#39; for everything that doesn&#39;t fit anywhere else. The repetoire is wide and variable, including the more popular pieces such as &#39;The Sporking of Figaro&#39; and &#39;The Agent of Seville&#39;. There is also a special party piece (see below), composed by an unknown PPC agent and titled &#39;In the Hall of the Badfic&#39;. They will occasionally take requests.<br><br><u>Special performances:</u> the orchestra&#39;s party piece is &#39;In the Hall of the Badfic&#39;. This is a unique piece of music intended to recreate the feeling of being within a fic of excessively poor quality. Each musician is given a piece of sheet music that they have never seen, much less played through, and told to play it as quickly as they can. During rest bars, they take anything they can find to hand to improvise the percussive noises as the score demands. The conductor&#39;s job is to inspire the members to ever greater volumes and general dischord as the audience is plunged further into the badfic. When the piece is at its climax, a single agent strikes a gong with a spork-shaped mallet and all other musicians stop playing, representing the neutralising of the badfic by agents and the return to canon. Fainting fits on the part of the audience or the musicians are not uncommon.<br><br><u>History:</u> assumably the Pisco formed at some point after the PPC, but its original members are lost to history. It is known that at some point in its early history, the Pisco often invited musicians from various canons to play as guests in the orchestra, but this practice has been discontinued. (This has been attributed to the orchestra&#39;s last guest performer, the Librarian of Unseen University in the Discworld canon, whose presence caused a disproportional amount of music involving organs to be played. Evidently an agent snapped after hearing news that they were to play the Organ Concerto for the thirteenth time in a year.)<br><br><u>The Conductor:</u> this posed somewhat of an issue to the orchestra&#39;s survival, since agents are by nature independent -minded and many of the instruments played are not represented on the traditional score. The last conductor, whose name has been forgotten, was said to be led away while gibbering about seven-eight time symphonies. Since then several agents have been suggested as conductor and all have refused a permanent position. Currently orchestra members take it in turns to be conductor each week by way of a roster, since waving the arms around, shouting at various musicians and making dramatic arm gestures are enjoyed by all. Due to their rarity and general delicacy, batons are eschewed in favour of whatever the acting conductor finds appropriate (pencils, whips, battle-lances, etc). The general mentality is that if it doesn&#39;t make the sheet music fall to the ground, it&#39;s acceptable.<br><br><u>Joining the orchestra:</u> all members of the PPC are welcome to join the orchestra, and all instruments are accepted (organs are the exception to the acception. See &#39;History&#39; for more information.) Traditionally, some areas of the orchestra have had more recruits than others - violins, for example, are more numerous than krumhorns. This has led to grievous rumours of musical press-gangs roaming the corridors of HQ, manned by musicians desperate for more members. It is not uncommon for a newly-recruited agent wandering the halls to be rendered unconscious and wake up to find themselves in possession of an instrument and a note that reads &#39;Music for orchestra inside. Learn this in time for practice tomorrow. Regards, your fellow [insert instrument]-players.&#39; As abhorrent as this treatment is, the Flowers have reported a sharp increase of press-ganged agents going on missions without complaint (well, less complaining than usual). Research is ongoing.<br><br><u>The Orchestra</u> - a list of the agents known to be members, current as of the last PPC census.<br><br><u>Strings</u><br><br>Viola - Agent Tater<br><br><u>Woodwind</u><br><br>Clarinet - Agent El<br><br><u>Brass</u><br><br><u>Percussion</u><br><br><u>Other</u><br><br>---<br><br>That&#39;s all I can think of now. If it gets popular I&#39;ll make a page on the PPC Wiki for it, but it entertained me at the time. Reply with your agents and their instruments and I&#39;ll include them on the list.<br><br>~Enelya</p>

            <p>...if there&#39;s an Orchestra, why not some sort of ballet/dance company?<br><br>The amount of Agents who can dance credibly might be small, but shove them into the corps de ballet, find a couple who are pretty talented to dance as soloists, and you&#39;ve got instant ballet.<br><br>And, of course, the Orchestra would provide their music. :P<br><br>The PPC Dance Ensemble, or whatever it would be called, would have such gems in their repertoire as &quot;Sue Lake,&quot; the tragic tale of an Agent, cursed to be a &#39;Sue, and her ex-partner, who predictably winds up hunting Sues in the same area. Also included is the shapeshifter!Sue Odile, who mimics the cursed Agent to attempt to trap the ex-partner.<br><br>Another possibility is &quot;The Sue-cracker,&quot; a story about a young girl who has always dreamed of becoming a PPC agent when she grows up. One night, she has an incredibly realistic dream about the toy she got for Christmas - a sort of humanoid automaton designed to pursue &#39;Sues, perhaps? - becoming life-sized, and she grows to become the Agent she might someday be. They then proceed to take a mystical journey through several canons, eliminating a few &#39;Sues on the way. The canon characters thank them by means of an entertaining dance before sending them on their way.<br><br>...and so on. I was in dance class today and these gems popped up while I was really supposed to be paying attention. It would be a shame to let them go to waste. <br><br>Dunno how viable an idea this is - I mean, it would require actual spare time - but hey, what the heck.</p>

            <p>(Not for anything bad, it&#39;s just that I&#39;ve never played in an orchestra with a recorder. But it still fits under woodwind.) A lot of agents are going to be absolute beginners with their instruments (especially the press-ganged ones) so there&#39;ll be some leeway. The Picso is about teaching agents to play as much as actually doing performances.<br><br>Xylophone and drums are fine - harp is so quiet in orchestras that you can&#39;t hear it half the time anyway, so I think we should be safe.

            <p>I wonder, has the orchestra changed its name over time? There&#39;s a passing reference to a Caffeine Overload Symphony <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/themary-sue.html">here</a>, as well as an All-HQ Choir (which is probably no more than what the name says).<br><br>Anyway, Agent Robinson would love to join. She can play anything resembling a recorder (though not so much with reeds) and she&#39;s not bad on the guitar, either. Not usual symphony stuff, but hey. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of her patient occasionally leave musical scores behind when they leave... could be a good source of new material. *g*<br><br>Agent Ilraen would probably be interested, too. He would just have to learn to play something that doesn&#39;t require a mouth--unless you can keep all concerts to under two hours. {= ) <br><br>Nume... well, given his history with weapons and tools, I think it&#39;s clear that manually-operated hand-held &quot;mechanical&quot; devices in general are not safe around him.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My agents may not be particularly gifted with instruments (though feel free to make them attempt to play some anyway), but they do sing.<br><br>Cassie&#39;s voice... is actually rather good. She used to sing soprano in her school/college choir and one of her most annoying habits is singing randomly around the RC and on missions. When Nat sings, she goes for enthusiasm over actually hitting the right notes, but if kicked into shape she&#39;d not be that bad either. Tyler... just no. He might be able to cope with an instrument, but he can&#39;t carry a tune in a bucket. And once I (finally) get my next two agents sorted out, you can drag them in too.</p>

            <p>Arti would probably go under percussion.

            <p>I just got an email from the WikiLot administrators, which is that WikiLot is going to be shutting down all the wikis running on their servers. Tomorrow, no less.<br><br>This includes the PPC wiki.<br><br>&quot;We have some sad news. Effective tomorrow WikiLot will be shutting down. We can no longer afford to keep the site running. We suggest using the export feature on you wiki to export your database to a file. Then you can sign up for a wiki at Wikia or another Wiki Farm and import your wiki. We apologize for this inconvenience.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve already begun to fill out the request for a Wikia wiki, and have begun to export all of the Wiki articles so far so that way we&#39;ll still have everything.<br><br>But yeah.

As anyone can tell with a cursory search on there, there are quite a few holes right now, but I&#39;m doing my best to make sure I get everything back up. It&#39;s hard to tell what&#39;s missing though since the &#39;Wanted Pages&#39; page has yet to update to show me this.<br><br>I&#39;d be more than grateful if people would start signing up on this wiki and helped get it back in order; for instance, many, if not all of the redirects that were in place seem to have died, but this might be due to the fact that everything is taking awhile to get back into place. I don&#39;t really know for sure.<br><br>In the case of articles that were lost in the move, it&#39;d be brilliant if I could get the saved HTML versions from you, Wandering Critic, since you mentioned your spider had collected them all. As it is though, I&#39;m not sure which/if any were lost since some pages are being tricky and displaying red links to pages that I know for certain are already up. I&#39;m figuring this is due to confusion on the part of the software.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got more than just the HTML. My zealous little spider poked around the edit pages and grabbed all the wiki-code, too.

My net connection can&#39;t handle uploading that; the download took hours, and that&#39;s the fast side of ADSL.

            <p>My spider is at this very moment sucking up the whole PPC wiki. It collects it as the generated HTML pages, of course, not the underlying data, but in the event that July&#39;s export or later import fails, at least we&#39;ll have the content -- though we might need a fair bit of cutting and pasting to get some of it back where it belongs.<br><br>I wish I could do more, but I can&#39;t think of anything else I can do without blowing my anonymity.

            <p>Hi, all,<br><br>As some of you may know, I&#39;m doing a rather large essay for my third-year english class at uni, and I chose to write about fanfiction - the basic goal is to convince anyone who doesn&#39;t already know about fanfic (particularly academics) that it is a Good Thing.<br><br>To that end, I&#39;m trying to interview as many people as I can, and I&#39;d appreciate any volunteers. Beware that I&#39;ve compiled a rather long list of questions, and it will take a while. I&#39;d much, much, much rather do it in real-time on msn messenger or gmail chat, and I&#39;m quite happy to split any one interview over several days. <br><br>If necessary, I can email the questions in a word document. If you&#39;re interested, please add me to your msn or gmail lists: <a href="mailto:fanwriter_sedri@hotmail.com">fanwriter_sedri@hotmail.com</a> OR <a href="mailto:fanwritersedri@gmail.com">fanwritersedri@gmail.com</a><br><br>I&#39;m going to try to be online as much as humanly possible, but between classes and time zones (I&#39;m in New Zealand; if you want to check time zone differences, go here: <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/"><a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/">http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/</a></a> and use Wellington for my time), arranging real-time chat might not be possible. If you think that&#39;s the case but still want to help, drop me an email at either of the above addresses and I&#39;ll mail you the questions.<br><br>In advance, BIG thanks and MANY chocolates *distributes boxes of Cadbury&#39;s*<br><br>- Sedri</p>

            <p>Firstly, many thanks to everyone who has volunteered. *hugs* I love you guys. <br><br>To make a long story short, I did real-time interviews with four people today, and found that it took about <i>three hours</i> per person. (At one point I had three different windows open in two programs, and was going a little mad.)  Obviously, this is not a good thing - I don&#39;t want to ask that much time of any of you. So it looks like direct interviews aren&#39;t going to work.<br><br>This is annoying; I wanted to do it real-time so that I could drop questions that had already been answered or obviously didn&#39;t apply to said person, and - more importantly - so that if a particularly interesting answer was given, or a new angle came up that I hadn&#39;t considered (which happened at least three times already), we could pursue that particular train of thought, which isn&#39;t so easy via email.<br><br>Sorry, I ramble. In short, unless you happen to have three hours to spare when you see me online, I think we ought to go with emailing. I&#39;d appreciate it if I could ask a few questions afterwards, if something comes up, but if not, no worries.<br><br>I&#39;ll send out the questions in the morning (it&#39;s getting late now) - if anyone volunteers after that, no worries; I&#39;ll just send it again. <br><br>Thanks again, all. The interviews so far have been <i>fantastic</i> and if this keeps up, my only problem will be getting through all the data before my essay is due!</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a lowlife on FFN who has been posting plagiarized stories by other people as his own. At least one is from someone I know, who is NOT happy about this. <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4375879/1/Draco_Malfoy_and_the_Shadowed_Fate">This story</a> is from a story in German on FFN.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1377853/Troufeilloumont">His profile</a> is interesting in other ways, too, most notably for the threats he makes against anyone who calls him on his plagiarism. I got a real laugh out of him saying &quot;...I will ensure that you never return to this site again&quot; like he&#39;s some kind of FFN authority. If the FFN staff finds out about him (and actually shows more signs of life than the average brick) he&#39;ll be banz0red so hard his head will spin.<br></p>

            <p>He&#39;s deliberately trying to hurt people.<br><br>For example, after Kittenmommy decided to have anything further to do with his CC (quietly, by PM) he first insulted and threatened her, then retaliated by posting reviews on a bunch of her stories accusing her of plagiarism and worse. He&#39;s done something similar to Roadstergal. Have you read his profile? He threatens people, he tries to intimidate people, and he&#39;s way beyond jerk and well into full-blown psychopath.<br><br>Not that I&#39;m advocating any action against him aside from reporting his plagiarism to FFN Abuse, each and every time, mind you. 12 fics came down today; it&#39;s working.

            <p>Don&#39;t think I&#39;m defending this creep, but speed does not in and of itself make a good beta. If I take on beta work, I expect to read through it at least twice before sending it back to the author, and then I usually have questions for them to address in addition to basic corrections. That means another read-through after they&#39;ve answered my questions with fixes; rinse and repeat if I&#39;m still not satisfied.

            <p>So, I&#39;m able to read quite a long document (not sure how many words, I hardly ever use Wordcount) in a matter of hours - possibly even minutes - and finish betaing in maybe three hours? That is, of course, once I get around to it. But three days is appallingly slow to beta, even if it&#39;s sitting on your desktop for two of those days.</p>

            <p>Actually, they don&#39;t say they copy-paste stories. They say they adapt them using certain tools and methods but keeping the core of the story. Keeping the core of the story sounds to me like: taking the plot and rewriting the whole thing. <br><br>I can&#39;t judge on whether they did that as they don&#39;t quote source.

            <p>I should&#39;ve put this in the other thread, but oh, well...<br><br>For sake of variety (and, in many cases, Morbid Curiosity), I&#39;d like to send my interview questions to a few badfic authors and see what comes back. I&#39;m a bit scared of what they might say, but it&#39;s all in the name of research. *chants* the name of research... the name of research... the name of research... <br><br>Anyway, since the wiki&#39;s not exactly available in full right now, I can&#39;t get links to the Legendary Badfic authors (LittlefootxCera author, for instance), so I appeal to you for links to any particularly annoying badficcers or RPF writers (not the plagerist trolls, though) that you know of. I&#39;m skimming FFN now for stereotype Suethors - there&#39;s certainly enough of them, so I&#39;m going for those who are active (ie, posted recently). <br><br>... Let me also note, for the record, that I&#39;m going to cut the question about OFUs and the PPC out of interviews I send to them, to avoid drawing flames if they find us.

            <p>(that is to say, when I was a newbie.)<br><br>We&#39;ve tried a few different alternate forums - one on livejournal, one on Proboards, and I think there was a third as well. None of them took off, though, and I think there&#39;s a few basic issues.<br><br>Firstly, the thread setup here on the board is quite unique, I have yet to find another place like it. I like being able to see every single post made from the index, I think it adds something to the community.<br><br>Secondly, there&#39;s a matter of momentum - we&#39;ve been here for a very long time, getting up and moving would be all kinds of hassle. There are those who have left (either temporarily or permanently) because of security issues (virii, adware, etcetera), but ultimately, if you have decent protection (Firefox, ad-aware, AVG, etcetera), you should be fine - I&#39;ve never had any trouble with it.<br><br>As an addendum to the previous point, there are a lot of websites that link to us here, many of which are no longer updated. If we were to move, we&#39;d be a lot harder for newbies to find, which is a Bad Thing.<br><br>There are ways to get around the IP address display - I connect from a big university, where I could be any of twenty thousand people. It would be a lot easier to find and read my livejournal to work out who I am, rather than try to IP trace through my school.<br><br>On a more practical note, there are a lot of proxy servers available on the internet - how they work is that you send your internet traffic through them, and it all gets stamped with their IP address rather than yours. I wouldn&#39;t trust the free ones with any important data (passwords, credit card numbers, home addresses), but for surfing the Board, they&#39;re reasonable.<br><br>Finally, if you&#39;re really paranoid, there&#39;s TOR, which is like a proxy server, but way better. I don&#39;t understand all the ins and outs, but a system built to get anonymous traffic through the Great Firewall of China without revealing its source is going to be very, very good. It&#39;s also free.<br><br>I like the IP addresses, myself - they give just a touch less anonymity, which has come in handy in the past for spotting sockpuppets, trolls, and the like. </p>

            <p>Oh, I fully understand the use of proxy servers, much to the frustration of one badfic writer who has this idea that she can keep me from commenting on her badfic (and it is very, very bad) on her blog. TOR is a royal pain in the neck. As for the sockpuppets, trolls, and whatnot, they know about proxy servers too. Unfortunately. One of the first things I learned as a forum admin was never to underestimate the persistence and inventiveness of trolls; you&#39;ve never seen it all.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit that not many forums use this format, although off the top of my head, I can think of Slashdot and Groklaw having a user option for a similar layout. I know Groklaw runs GeekLog; not sure what Slashdot is using but I think it&#39;s proprietary. There&#39;s a down side to this, though. It&#39;s very hard for someone, especially someone new to the forum, to find something from more than a few days ago. There is a lot of community history here, but it&#39;s all inaccessible behind some very large number of presses of the Next Page button, or getting lucky with the limited Search if there&#39;s something in particular you&#39;re looking for. A more conventional forum would allow that history to remain readily accessible (and browseable) to the community, newbie as well as veteran.<br><br>I suppose I&#39;m mildly annoyed with myself over the IP issue; if I&#39;d noticed that before I posted, I would have been using a proxy all along. Guess it&#39;s time to talk to my ISP for a change of IP, and use a proxy. *sigh*<br><br>I&#39;d still like an EDIT button, though, and topic organization, and an archive of everyone&#39;s PPC stories all in one place, and user profiles, and a pony.<br></p>

            <p>While I can&#39;t pretend to know the first thing about the technical ins and outs of proxy servers and whatnot, I have to admit, losing old topics isn&#39;t much fun. For example, when Trojie and I discussed making the PPC Movie, we were both aware that the posts for the 2008 Sue Invasion had been shunted off the Board into the ether. It was only thanks to JulyFlame&#39;s brilliant foresightedness in saving the posts that the project was able to go ahead. If we could find a way to store them, that would be an extremely good idea. And an EDIT button would probably be appreciated by just about every SPAG Nazi on here.<br><br>However, I first found <b>this</b> Board, just the way it is, and I wouldn&#39;t change it for anything. I may be a newbie compared to the other people commenting on this topic, but I like the Board just the way it is. I&#39;m very fond of this place. So I might not have any technical advice or even other useful comments to make, but my attachment to the Board as it is leads me to join my voice with the others who don&#39;t want to change.</p>

            <p>But what&#39;s so special about this board?<br><br>Is it the specific software that it runs on?<br><br>Or is it the people, the community, the friendliness, the silliness, the stories, and all that?<br><br>Changing the software wouldn&#39;t change the people. We can have software that does good things (like saving posts forever) without changing anything about the people.<br><br>If we really want only one section, then we can have only one section, and post everything in there. In fact, doing that would make it a lot easier to see the newest posts than it is here, where you have to scroll down the page and try to spot them. Depending on the forum software, we could probably even skin it to look pretty much like this board.<br></p>

            <p>to be perfectly honest, while everyone seems to agree that the Board isn&#39;t perfect, we&#39;re <b>happy</b> with it. It&#39;s always been like this, it works just fine, and to be honest, nobody seems to mind too much about its flaws.<br><br>I can appreciate wholeheartedly that going somewhere else would have a lot of advantages, but we&#39;re happy right here. We know where it is, we don&#39;t need to try altering links and all that just for the sake of a few extra gadgets and amenities.<br><br>Moving somewhere else, even if it looks and behaves almost the same, won&#39;t be the same. It&#39;d be like turning your bed round in your room so it faces a completely different direction- awkward and a struggle to get used to. Sure, we might grow into it after a while, but for the lurkers it&#39;d be really difficult because, well, they lurk. It could be lack of access, or simply not having enough time, but they can&#39;t get to the Board as often as others and our suddenly changing things would throw them.<br><br>I know it sounds like I&#39;m being stubborn and awkward and argulg just for the sake of it, but the truth is I really don&#39;t want to move.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s the problem:<br><br>It&#39;s not hackers I&#39;m worried about; it&#39;s butthurt fanbrats.<br><br>There are a number of ways to get someone&#39;s IP address. For example, it&#39;s usually visible to forum admins and blog owners. There are a number of us, I believe, who use different names here than we do where we actually post our fanfic (myself included). I try to maintain a certain amount of separation between this identity and my writing identity, for I think obvious reasons. Revenge reviews are no fun.<br><br>Basically, with this system, anyone who has access to my other identity&#39;s IP (and there are quite a few ways to get it that I&#39;m not going to go into) can find the connection between the two with a bit of googling. And, honestly, I&#39;m really not comfortable with that.<br><br>There&#39;s rather a lot you can find out about someone from their IP, by the way. For instance, one of you is from the El Paso, Texas, area, while another one is in Japan. Not necessarily an important bit of information in and of itself, but as one data point out of many, it can help build up a profile of you. As an example, in the process of hunting down a troublemaker, in an hour or so of work I&#39;d found her real name, her parents&#39; names and employers, her employer, the school she graduated from, pictures of her and her mother, and a sufficiently in-depth profile of her interests, hobbies, etc., that I could have posed as her if I&#39;d wanted to. (also, I found that she wrote really <i>really</i> bad slash) What did I have to start with? A FFN pen name.<br><br>If we want to look into an alternative, there are a lot of them out there. For instance, GoDaddy has a package for about fifty bucks a year that includes a website, forums, blogging, etc. I&#39;m not sure if it comes with wiki support or not, but we could certainly install our own, something like MediaWiki. A year of that, plus domain name registration, would cost sixty bucks. If we put up a PayPal donation button and a dozen PPCers kicked in five bucks each -- the price of lunch at a fast food place -- we&#39;d have our own site and not have to worry about a sudden crisis when the folks who host our wiki, or board, or anything else, suddenly shut down. Hell, we could run our own fanfic archive for PPC stories.<br><br>I only mentioned GoDaddy because I&#39;ve used them in the past; I&#39;m sure there are other deals as good or better available from other vendors.<br><br>With our own forums, we&#39;d have search capabilities, we&#39;d have history, we&#39;d be able to keep spammers out, we could organize things so that the badfic reports aren&#39;t all tangled up with welcome messages that are all mixed in with links to new stories, and so on. Sure, this still works, but there are things that would be good to have it do that it can&#39;t and won&#39;t ever be able to do. Just having a login system that works would be nice, not to mention user profiles, links to our stories, sorting posts by categories, spam suppression, and getting rid of the ads.<br><br>I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m being an annoying, pushy newbie here, barging in and telling all the people whose community it <i>really</i> is, the people who built it and gave it life, how they should be doing things. I&#39;m really not trying to do that. I respect all of you like you wouldn&#39;t believe (I&#39;ve been reading some of your stories for a long time) and I&#39;m not really trying to be an asshat. It&#39;s just that if we can have something that fits the needs of the community better than what we have now, if it&#39;s more secure for all of us, and if it can be done easily, why not do it?<br><br>Tell me to shut up if I&#39;m getting above my place here. Honestly, despite how it may appear, I&#39;m trying to contribute to the community, not to criticize how things have been done since time immemorial.</p>

            <p>I have to say that I&#39;d much rather we stick to what we have. True, WC, another forum could be more sophisticated, but quite frankly, I like the simplicity here - having multiple subsections for different categories annoys me immensely, as it often means having to check six different pages while looking for interesting updates... which isn&#39;t to say that every other type of forum would necessarily have that (I&#39;m no expert, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case), but still. <br><br>I ramble. Again. Must break that habit. In any case, while a new board is definitely possible and practical, I really don&#39;t see it happening. I&#39;m not an &#39;oldbie&#39; by any means, but every place will have something about it we dislike, and as long as this one has relatively few, there&#39;s not much incentive to leave. I become quite grumpy when I notice a typo after posting, but so what? I&#39;ll live, and no one around here really cares about little mistakes; they can, in fact, make for a good laugh, or spark some creativie manifestation in HQ.<br><br>Most significantly for me, I wouldn&#39;t want to be one of those former members who might decide to come back, only to be faced with a blank page and a small chance of finding the real activity. Call me soft-hearted, but I wouldn&#39;t want to do that to anyone. (Including myself, should I ever have need to vanish for a few months.)<br><br>*shrugs* There&#39;s more than enough experienced people with better points, but that&#39;s my say. </p>

            <p>But, like I said, this has been hashed and rehashed and discussed over and to death, over the past few years that I can remember.

            <p>And I&#39;ve always had an open policy regarding my name or location. There&#39;s no point in me doing anything that&#39;d ruin my reputation online or in real life in the long run. I don&#39;t hold the opinion that online activity and what you do in real life is going to be as separate as it is in a few years. <br><br>And it comes to those &#39;butthurt fanbrats&#39;, however, pretty much none of them have the ability to understand what to <i>do </i>with that IP address, though. It takes real understanding to bother to do that, and pretty much all of them don&#39;t have that understanding.<br><br>As to the idea of the PPC getting its own website, that sort of thing is tricky. Yes, we /could/, and if several people help out at once it makes it easy to afford it. But then we get down to various nitty gritty problems. Such as is it really a good idea to do that? Who would manage the account? What would we do if they dropped off the face of the earth? And so forth. Not to mention most of us are underage or still living under our parents&#39; thumbs. A bit difficult to explain why you need to use one of the credit cards, I would think.<br><br>And there&#39;s another reason for us to stay here besides the fact that we&#39;ve always been here as a community: As it is, both the main PPC archives that a lot of people find their way to the PPC community through direct to this board and there is no way to change that link. <br></p>

            <p>Who would manage the account? Make it several people. That way, if one of them vanished, the others could take over, and appoint a new cabal member if needed.<br><br>For those of us who are not underage, paying for it is easy enough; PayPal is everywhere. I&#39;ll pledge twenty bucks towards the funding, and my services in setting up the forums as well.<br><br>For those who are underage, why not the truth? &quot;Some friends and I are setting up a website for our writing and stuff, and we&#39;re each pitching in five bucks to pay for it.&quot; If that doesn&#39;t work, you go down to the 7-Eleven, buy a money order, and snail it off to whoever&#39;s paying for the website.<br><br>Regarding the links, I take it that both the PPC archives in question are abandoned, then? Disappointing to know. :(  That&#39;s a good argument in favor of having a full-fledged site that several people have admin access to, by the way. Anyway, if the links point here, the simple solution is to leave a link here pointing to the new website at plotprotectors.org (or whatever). People will follow it, don&#39;t worry; fans will find anything. (oh, and someone really ought to update the front page here; it&#39;s been like five years since any new news was posted)<br><br>By the way, the &quot;wait until the posts drop off the page&quot; doesn&#39;t work; they&#39;re there for all eternity. Check <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=173110;">this link</a> for a random example -- I googled for a post from a few pages back, and there&#39;s the page. So we have all the negatives of persistence without the positives, like being able to easily find something in an old thread.<br><br>Again, I&#39;m not trying to browbeat people into agreeing with me. Just addressing the technical objections.<br><br>As to whether online activity and real-life identities are going to be more or less separate, that&#39;s a whole other can of worms. Certainly one side of the political spectrum is trying very hard to restrict freedom of speech all they can, and outlaw anonymity (except, of course, for the State and its operatives) along with it, and the other side wants to make everything politically correct &quot;for the chidren.&quot; But there&#39;s a counter-push by privacy advocates to prohibit tracking and data-mining of our online activities, and that seems to be picking up momentum. Speaking of our underage posters, it may well be a US federal crime to have their IP&#39;s visible here; the law is a bit vague and very weird about that. So it&#39;s not quite as cut and dried as it looks.<br><br>Just out of curiousity, by the way, who is the administrator of this board? It seems like there are a lot of options that aren&#39;t being used.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ll put twenty bucks and my forum setup skills where my mouth is, if people decide to go that way.<br><br>Oh, as for the butthurt fanbrats, having them posting revenge reviews for my fanfic would be majorly annoying. I&#39;ve never said anything online that I wouldn&#39;t tell the person in question to their face, nor that I wouldn&#39;t admit to on national television (a good rule for not having things come back to haunt you, like some politicians have had), but I&#39;d <i>really</i> rather not have my fanfic, and my other activities, cluttered up by whiny children.<br></p>

            <p>I think one of the things that has made the PPC what it is is the utter lack of a ruling cabal. We have no leaders, no authority, and no real politics, beyond voting in permission givers. We are a creative anarchy here, and that&#39;s definitely part of what the PPC is. While we&#39;ve had to deal with problems in the past with more creative ways than simply banning and being done with it, I think it makes us stronger. I&#39;ve seen board politics on more conventional forums get very ugly, and I really don&#39;t want that to happen to the PPC.<br><br>Now, if we were to get a new website, and keep the current forum structure intact, what could we do to reduce politics? (This question is for everyone, by the way - I&#39;m not challenging you for an answer, Wandering Critic, I want to know what people think, and this is a convenient spot to put it.)<br><br>(And don&#39;t worry about coming across as pushy, conversation is a good thing. Going out, making a website on your own, and then posting demanding we all switch would be pushy. This is good conversation.)<br><br></p>

            <p>Well, having been through at least my share of forum politics, I&#39;ve formed a few hypotheses about that particular problem. The most important is that the cause of forum politics is not the forum itself, but the innate politics in the organization that populates the forums.<br><br>Take Usenet as an example, back in the golden age before the Eternal September. Unmoderated newsgroups were about as much of a free-for-all as has ever existed. Some of them were nightmares of flaming, sniping, infighting, and general asshattery. Others were some of the most civilized discussion groups I&#39;ve ever seen. Since they all had the same structure, or rather lack thereof, the only significant difference was the population. The same is true of Web forums. For example, at various times, I&#39;ve been a mod or admin in a number of online game forums. Those whose populations consisted of people who were big on in-game drama brought it to the boards, and there was more than enough forum drama to last a lifetime. Others, whose populations consisted of people who basically liked each other and weren&#39;t trying to be jerks (my former WoW guild, for instance) had no forum drama at all; there was a general agreement on how to go about things, so that&#39;s how it got done.<br><br>The way to reduce politics, I think, is simply to make it useless. What would be the point of politics on a PPC forum anyway? Make those decisions that need to be made -- should we add a new forum section for legendary badfic nominations? -- by consensus. Forum mods could be appointed by the same mechanism as PG&#39;s are. Or we could do entirely without mods, for that matter, and just deal with troublemakers the same as we do now. Or something in between, where there&#39;s a mod or two to take care of spam, but anything by a real user is left alone. Look around you: is there any problem with politics now? Changing whether we have an EDIT button and organized sections won&#39;t change people&#39;s attitudes, or make us all into different people.<br><br>I was using the term &quot;cabal&quot; jokingly. Whoever would maintain the website and hosting, and being root admin of the forum, wouldn&#39;t have any more of a voice than anyone else. I hope we, as a group, would be able to choose people who wouldn&#39;t want to expand that role to anything more than keeping things running and implementing any changes, like a new section, that the group consensus called for. Having a member of a group who takes on a job that needs to be done (like keeping a website paid-for) doesn&#39;t diminish the anarchy as long as their role is understood to be akin to that of groundskeeper rather than owner: a duty and a service, not a position of authority.<br><br>In other words, go along just the same as the PPC has always done, except that a couple of trusted people handle the technical stuff on behalf of the group. A better forum won&#39;t cause political drama to spontaneously generate any more than moving some politics-riddled forum to a system like this would cause it to go away. It&#39;s the people, not the medium.<br><br>Oh, and just so the massive cash flow doesn&#39;t cause drama of its own: Anyone who contributes five bucks during the annual fund drive gets listed on the forum, so the bill-payer (who would obviously have to be a Money Plant!) never gets accused of collecting a few extra contributions than are needed and splurging on a double-cheese pizza.</p>

            <p>The PPC is set up in such a way that no one is really in charge. The permission givers are here so that way there&#39;s at least /some/ control over the shared universe. They&#39;re permission givers because the community as a whole trusts them to know what the community is about and to help with newbies also wanting to PPC, not be figures of authority. Having a website would end up doing something like that. There&#39;s no real hierarchy here except for the ones people put in their minds.<br><br>As to links, Cam still maintains her website which still hosts the original series after it was kicked off of FF.net, but P@L, whose site has the link to this board, has been AWOL from fandom for a few years now, at least. (Thus why the front page hasn&#39;t been upated.)<br><br>The Board only keeps a limited number of posts in the provided archive; and will only stay up for a limited amount of time. If there were no posts on it in, I can&#39;t remember which, either three or six months, then the board would be deleted, simple as that. So yes, while your link is evidence of there being an archive, it&#39;s a very small archive- right now going back to only mid June- and every new topic on the front page pushes an old topic off the last page and into internet oblivion. <br><br>The person who set this board up I believe is P@L, who as I mentioned earlier has been AWOL for several years. The only thing keeping this board in existence is the activity of <br>its members.<br><br>And yes, I agree, revenge reviews are annoying.</p>

            <p>The Board has been showing the IP addresses of the poster for at least a year (I say at least a year since that&#39;s about how long I&#39;ve been posting here). From what I know, none of us can shut it off, my guess is that that is a setting that an administrator for the board would need to do if it is possible, but I think it has been years since the person who set up the board (P@L, if I&#39;m thinking right) has had a presence here.<br><br>From what I know, looking at archived pages from the Way Back Machine as well as various links and pages from the LJ community, there have been a few times where the Board has given serious consideration to switching to a different venue, at least once due to a serious trolling problem, but despite that, this particular sort of forum has been stuck with for at least five years.<br><br>And that&#39;s about as much as I know.</p>
