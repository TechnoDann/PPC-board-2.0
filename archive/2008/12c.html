            <p>Actually, FicPsych is kind of My Thing. Not that it&#39;s really obvious, but still. It seemed like a little-used corner of HQ that I could play in without anyone minding too much.<br><br>Anyway, as for other doctors (as opposed to nurses), I think the answer is no.

            <p>As we write metafiction as well, any rules we implement concerning metafiction should be applicable to us as well, unless the Continuum Protection Initiative itself gives us special license (and even that smacks of sue-dom, as it would have to be us writing the CPI...)<br><br>It would be interesting to have a team of agents bump into a &quot;film crew&quot; filming a badfic for MST purposes...<br><br>2, on the other hand, is easy to answer.

            <p>I have a feeling the fourth wall wouldn&#39;t survive the encounter either.<br><br>The author&#39;s also written self-inserts in Halo and Harry Potter. Unfortunately, the sequels make the characters invincible. And as a Halo and Wars fan, I did notice the problems. However, the shots in question come from military grade hardware, and civilian shuttles have been stated to be capable of surviving laser cannon fire from fighters.</p>

            <p>The thing is, were they using the heavy cannons? The novelization mentions it, but the fact that near-hits and even direct hits didn&#39;t reduce the yacht to space dust is telling, especially given the description of ImpStar turbolaser power in the Incredible Cross Sections books.

            <p>... but there are documented contacts between the PPC and other trans-dimensional organisations (excluding of course the Black Cats and the League of MS Factories). Agent Quen was once <a href="http://agent-quen.livejournal.com/3105.html">asked to contact Jurisfiction</a>, and Agent Dafydd and Selene once <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1272424/14/The_Boromir_Saga">helped out ISPCE</a> in an unofficial capacity. I&#39;m sure there have been other encounters (well, obviously: the OFUs?), so the PPC has a history of contacting other dimension-hoppers, on and off the record. However, if they&#39;re Suvian, we still get to kill them. Or at least sic Despatch on them.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&#39;Lo, all. Found the wonderful organisation that is the PPC on TV Tropes and decided to join up. I&#39;m wondering whether anyone has assassinated the notorious Ebony Dark&#39;ness Dementia Raven Way yet. If not, I might attempt to take on the task myself, but as I think there is not a single canon character in sight in the fic she comes from, that they have all been kidnapped, I think it would be something of a mammoth task to dump on a newbie.<br><br>Any veterans feel like skewering her?

            <p>Sorry to take so long in dropping by to say hello, but I&#39;ve been off the computer recently for medical reasons. Just glanced through your poetry and liked what I saw, though I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have enough time to look them all other. &quot;We Still Kill the Old Way&quot; gave me the creeps (that&#39;s a compliment, by the way), though it only really makes sense with the comment below. If you like, I can post concrit from my Deviantart account, though I&#39;m better at taking apart prose than I am at poetry.<br><br>Do you put all your stuff up on Deviantart, or do you have a separate website?</p>

            <p>Aye, I write more poetry than I do prose. Thanks for the review, and concrit is welcome! Hopefully you know more about English than the person that reviewed Hunt and tried to tell me &quot;roiling&quot; was a typo of &quot;rolling&quot; :P<br><br>Not too fond of the first stanza of We Still Kill The Old Way - there was something of a tone shift after that, and I prefer the tone of the latter part of the poem.

            <p>That is a very, very epic understatement. *hands over shiny gold Massive Understatement trophy* You&#39;re almost as unsquickable as I am, and that&#39;s saying something - I&#39;ve read most Legendary &#39;fics, usually with no reaction or outright laughter.<br><br>Have a Prinny suit. *goes into obligatory Captain Exposition mode* It increases stats (in an RPG sense), may or may not come with complimentary Prinny bombs and a pair of swords, and makes you say &quot;-dood&quot; at the end of every sentence. It makes people explode when thrown, but that&#39;s... usually... only a problem in NIS videogame canons and similar games. Basically, games where people can be tossed around anytime, by anyone. (It&#39;s amusing to see the biggest normal enemies being carried by the smallest creatable characters in Disgaea, where the suits are from. Testing on the Final Final Boss, Baal, has not been attempted yet.)</p>

            <p>I have come into a bit of a dilemma recently, which I was hoping y&#39;all could help me with. Short version: I have run across a fic I&#39;d love to spork or see sporked. I also want to grab the idea behind the fic and run away with it, cackling madly.<br><br>See, I happened to run across this fic called A Different World, by Lady Clark-Weasley of Books. If that name sounds familiar, it&#39;s because one of her other fics was nominated for sporking a while back. Looking at her fics generally provoke feelings of RAGE within me. This one was not much different, having the usual bad spelling, tense jumps, bad grammar, and awful characterization. However, I found the <i>concept</i> behind the story quite interesting: in the Season Two finale of the new Doctor Who, the Doctor is the one who ends up in the alternate dimension. With him gone, the TARDIS somehow transforms Rose into a Time Lady, and she goes on to take his place in the canon scale of events.<br><br>Yes, I know it&#39;s a weird, even silly-sounding idea. Only the more I thought about it, the cooler it seemed. Just for starters, there&#39;d be the mental, physical, and emotional shock of suddenly becoming a <i>very</i> different creature. Presumably over the chapters you could follow the slow readjustment to her new identity and responsibilities. Then there&#39;s the fact that Rose is very much NOT the Doctor--she&#39;d react to things differently from him, and other people (the Master springs to mind in particular) would react differently to her. So over time the story slowly deviates from canon, and the reader gets the pleasure of watching what Stays and what Doesn&#39;t. I&#39;ve got even more ideas, even scenes sketched out in my mind, but I&#39;m probably boring your socks off as is.<br><br>The question is, do I have the right to take this idea and make my own story out of it? It&#39;s not as if I&#39;m picking up on a common AU idea; this is the first time I&#39;ve ever encountered &quot;Rose as Time Lord,&quot; frankly speaking. I don&#39;t want to come off as an idea-thief, but that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;d be doing. Then there&#39;s the fact that I would gleefully spork pretty much all of Lady Clark-Wesley&#39;s fics given the opportunity. Talk about adding insult to injury! While I believe that people who write badfic deserve the riffs they get, I don&#39;t believe in being unnecessarily cruel. Posting her fics for retribution and then running off with her ideas...well, that&#39;s kind of pushing it.<br><br>And then, on the other hand, I genuinely believe that her version is a waste of a good idea and I want to give that idea the story it <i>deserves</i>.<br><br>Okay, so maybe I&#39;m making a mountain out of a molehill. But I&#39;d still appreciate hearing your input on the subject all the same. And if you have anything to say about the idea itself, feel free to post it--I&#39;d love to hear what you have to say.</p>

            <p>Have you worked out the details of <i>how</i> the TARDIS can somehow turn Rose into a Time Lady? Given that whole thing where, y&#39;know, Time Lords are the ones that have graduated from the academy on Gallifrey and all that. To be a Time Lady she&#39;d have to have all the knowledge a Time Lord would pick up at the academy, and that seems remarkably similar, to me, to the season four finale, and the thing where you can&#39;t have a Time Lord consciousness in a human brain. So you&#39;d be having to change her biology to make her into a Gallifreyan, and, alright, the chameleon arch can be used to do the process the other way around, but then you&#39;d need a specific reason why chameleon arches or something like them to turn non-Gallifreyans into Gallifreyans would have been invented and installed in TARDISes.<br><br>Short version: how on earth is this going to work? What are your ideas so far?</p>

            <p>Sporked a story and then wrote my version of it. I did give credit where the idea came from. The only people who didn&#39;t like what I had done (or at least the only people to tell me so) were the original authors. Other people have complimented me on a well written story.<br><br>Anyway, authors can&#39;t actually claim ownership to ideas. Except if the idea is very, very specific. Which may or may not be the case here. I haven&#39;t read Lady Clark&#39;s fic (not do I tend to; she leaves raving reviews for fics I intend to spork), but I have come across several fics that had elements of the plot she used way back in that short period of time that I still read Whofics. <br><br>I&#39;ve seen a few where the Doctor gets stuck in the other dimension leaving Rose with the TARDIS (heck, one of those even inspired me to write a short fic about Rose trying to get out of the building before it colapsed). There are many other fics where Rose in one way or another becomes a Time Lady (if not the mother of one). And of course there are many, many fics that do a character replacement for series three, though usually of Martha.<br><br>But I like your approach to it: Rose will react to changing into a different creature; she will respond differently to things that the Doctor would. I&#39;d say go for it. Good plot ideas deserve good stories.<br><br>If you&#39;re going to post the spork and your version of the story in different locations very few people are going to notice and/or take offense that you have done both.</p>

            <p>It wasn&#39;t a badfic, persay, but it definently wasn&#39;t good. I could think of a thousand things I would have done differently and made it better. But like Sedri said, you can&#39;t just steal someone&#39;s idea. <br><br>The best thing to do, would be to as Lady Clark-Weasely if you can write your own version of her idea, making sure to say you&#39;re doing it differently, and if she gives you permission you can run with it. The downside to this is that you really really shouldn&#39;t spork any of her work afterwards. That&#39;s just rude.</p>

            <p>...and they all boil down the point that deliberately taking someone else&#39;s idea without their permission leaves me so sick with guilt that I couldn&#39;t do it. It&#39;s not right. Just because it&#39;s fanfic doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t respect someone&#39;s idea. I would be deeply wounded if someone pinched my &#39;original&#39; (as much as fanfic can be) plotline - that is, after all, why some disclaimers include things like &quot;but so-and-so IS mine&quot;.<br><br>That said, I know how you feel. There are some stories - fanfic and published - that I look at with longing, going, &quot;I could do SO MUCH better! I could FIX that!&quot; But I can&#39;t, and it&#39;s frustrating.<br><br>All this applies doubly if the rest is spork-worthy. It&#39;s painful, but that&#39;s life. The only chance I think you&#39;d have of getting to write that story is if the author gives up, stops writing, and you ask if you can use the idea. But that&#39;s not likely. <br><br>Sorry. :(</p>

            <p>Stealing means taking something so that someone else can&#39;t use it anymore. If you take an idea, even one that someone else had before, they can still use that idea. Therefore using someone else&#39;s idea is not stealing.<br><br>Then there is the issue of whether you should ask them whether they are okay with it that you use the idea they had first. That depends. It&#39;s not unheard of that two people independently come up with the same idea. I&#39;ve had an idea in my head for a Torchwood fic for the past two years, and I&#39;m surprised no one else has used that idea in a fic yet.<br><br>Ideas themselves are not copyrightable unless they are very, very specific. This means that it&#39;s also not really possible to claim ownership over ideas. Indeed, some authors do, but most of them barely know the basic rules of punctuation so I kind of doubt they know the little details of copyright and ownership laws.<br><br>So, technically, you do not have to ask permission to use ideas. Perhaps you feel you have to morally, but that&#39;s a different matter. The problem with that is, the author could deny you permission even though it is morally questionable that they do: they are using copyrighted work without permission themselves. <br><br>If the idea is specific (to the point where other readers are likely to point you out to an author that wrote this story first) you should give credit where you got the idea. But that does not require permission. If the badfic author think it does, just point out that they are being a hypocrite.</p>

            <p>And I was talking morally. But I disagree with your last two paragraphs because there is no dividing line between where an idea becomes specific. If I wrote a story about a coven of vegetarian vampires, even if I use nothing else even vaguely similar to <i>Twilight</i>, I would instantly get shouted down for plagerism. Whether or not that&#39;s right is debateably, but I know I wouldn&#39;t be able to do it morally because the idea did NOT occur to me until I&#39;d seen the film.<br><br>There&#39;s no way to prove whether a second author came up with the idea independantly, but if you <i>know</i> you didn&#39;t, then I still say it&#39;s wrong.</p>

            <p>there are other stories where vegetarian vampires make an appearance. Not a whole lot of them, but Angel from Buffy stayed away from human blood.<br><br>True, there is not an exact defining line where an idea becomes specific. But writing a story about teenagers in a boarding school learing witchcraft does not make a story plagery for Harry Potter. People may shout that, but they would be wrong. If anything, it would be plagery for the Worst Witch, because that is older.<br><br>I just read what Twilight is about: Meyer says that the idea for Twilight came to her in a dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood.<br><br>That&#39;s funny, I have a book that was first published in 2001 that can be summarised like that. Stephenie Meyer is plagerizing Charlotte Harris!<br><br>Seriously, ideas have to be way more specific than that. If two stories would get the same (detailed) outline, then perhaps they would be too similar. But if there are just some elements the same (Doctor in parallel universe, Rose not. Rose becomes Time Lady) you are not using the same ideas as someone else. Particularly not if you&#39;re going to explore what it means to Rose to become a Time Lady rather than right away plunking her into the Christmas special.<br><br>Ugh, it&#39;s like telling a fanficcer: you can&#39;t write that missing scene plot idea because you got it from watching that episode.<br><br>Ideas have to come from some place. And other fanfics are as likely a place as any. You&#39;re doing yourself a disservice if you dismiss an idea because you can point out a source to it. </p>

            <p>I was talking socially. Whether it&#39;s right or wrong, if you write an idea and someone (however immature) recognises it from elsewhere, they might start throwing around accusations of plagerism, and I don&#39;t think anyone wants to deal with that sort of mess.<br><br>That said, I probably came across as too definite, and I apologise.

            <p>Accusations of plagery are a bother. But as said, I&#39;ve used ideas I got from other people&#39;s fics, I&#39;ve given credit where I got the idea, and no one has said anything about plagery. I guess the given credit played an important part in that.<br><br>If you feel uncomfortable using an idea you got from another fanfic you shouldn&#39;t use it.

            <p>Never seen it done (or used it myself), but ysalamiri-usage would be fairly canonical. At least for the New Republic era - I seem to recall a statement that Myrkr was effectively blockaded/off-limits for the Old Republic.<br><br>Elcalion</p>

            <p>Been a while since I read the Thrawn trilogy - and they&#39;re down at my parents place, so couldn&#39;t check... Anyway, I&#39;d think ysalamiri would be a bit unusual pre-Empire or during the Empire days, it&#39;d be primarily in the New Republic era that ysalamiri would be more readily accesible. That said, Star Wars canon is sometimes hard to pin down on things, and retcons are not unknown! (Boba Fett&#39;s backstory, anyone?)</p>

            <p>It&#39;s both funny and disturbing in a bizarre way. And if I recall my Torchwood correctly, the crew isn&#39;t exactly the picture of a smooth-running team itself. Still, I can&#39;t help but snicker at the image of a kid living in the Hub: &quot;I don&#39;t have my homework &#39;cause a Dalek from last Sunday&#39;s invasion got into the Hub and we all nearly died only Ianto managed to kill it with a rocket launcher and all the fighting and stuff damaged the computers including the one with my essay. But Tosh said she could get most of the stuff on the computers back by Wednesday so if you can wait I&#39;ll have it in by then. <i>Honest</i>.&quot;<br><br>Good job killing the Sue, and congradulations on finally finishing the mission!</p>

            <p>I felt as though I&#39;d fallen into a Sue&#39;s Christmas when I saw my sister&#39;s collection. If there was a single thing in it that wasn&#39;t pink and/or sparkly, I&#39;m a Flower.

            <p>Alas, I have no gifts for you yet. But then, I haven&#39;t gotten gifts for anyone else yet, either. ... It&#39;s been one of those years.<br><br>As a substitute, I give you the first part of the FicPsych story I&#39;m working on and one more chance to contribute to the flavor of the thing with suggestions for canon characters and the badfics they came from.<br><br>~*~<br><br>The power snapped out.<br><br>Imagine, if you will, that you are standing on a beach somewhere.  It doesn&#39;t particularly matter what beach.  Imagine that the day is calm and that the waves lap gently against the shore.  Imagine the soft hissing noise as the water slides back through the sand into the sea.  Imagine the silence as the next wave gathers.<br><br>The next wave is a tsunami.<br><br>In the Department of Fictional Psychology, Suvian voices crashed through the walls with the force of a sonic boom.  Even the combined cries of the canon characters couldn&#39;t completely cover the insidious suggestions slicing through the air (or arrest the author&#39;s arbitrary alliteration).<br><br>Head Nurse Suzine forcibly spat out her decaf Bloffee before she could choke on it.  The spray drenched the potted fern hanging around the donut table, but completely missed her white skirt.  No one quite knew how she managed these things.<br><br><i>Was that necessary?</i> said the fern.  <i>Not that I dislike Bloffee, but really.</i><br><br>&quot;No power.  No Four-S,&quot; Suzine replied.  &quot;This is Bad.&quot;  She put her mug down on the nearest surface and fumbled her way to the supply cabinet.  She always made sure the nurses&#39; lounge had an emergency cache of the most popular sedatives, just in case a situation arose that couldn&#39;t wait for access to the B-ware, as the heavily-guarded supplies in Unit B were affectionately known.  This was definitely one of those situations.  After some trial and error with her keyring, she got the cabinet unlocked, and not a moment too soon.  As predicted, the nurses came running.<br><br>Well, not running, really, as that would have caused them all to fall over themselves in the darkness.  It was more of a rapid shuffle.  Suzine switched on a penlight from the cabinet and shone it at the doorway, nearly blinding Nurse Elms and Nurse Pablum.<br><br>&quot;Oh boy, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here,&quot; said Nurse Elms, whose uniform was rather singed.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but if we don&#39;t get Raistlin contained immediately—&quot;<br><br>Suzine waved Elms silent.  &quot;What&#39;s his condition?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Post-Traumatic Bad Slash Syndrome,&quot; said Elms.  &quot;He keeps switching between looking for Tanis Half-Elven and being sick, screaming &#39;oh gods why?!&#39;, and trying to blast us with lightning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s praying to Bilius?&quot; remarked Nurse Parwill from behind her.<br><br>&quot;Shush, you.&quot;<br><br>Suzine sighed.  &quot;Fine.  Take this.&quot;  She handed Elms a small frying pan from the sedatives cabinet.  It was made of aluminum and said &quot;No. 2 – Mild&quot; on the bottom.  Beneath that, in a smaller parenthetical note, it said &quot;1d6.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thanks!&quot; said Elms, who turned and pushed her way back through the crowd.<br><br>&quot;Next?&quot; said Suzine, and Nurse Dewstan stepped up.<br><br>&quot;Woobie!Legolas; keeps violently cuddling anyone who gets too close.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And taking his pants off,&quot; added Nurse Pablum.<br><br>&quot;And taking his pants off.&quot;<br><br>Several nurses curled their lips.<br><br>&quot;I see,&quot; said Suzine.  She considered for a moment, then selected something that resembled a small baby bottle with a candy nipple.  &quot;Wet the candy bit in his mouth, stick it in the bottle, shake it up, and put it back in his mouth.  Repeat until he goes to sleep.  I think this one is Dorwinion wine–‏‏flavored.  Next?&quot;<br><br>~*~<br><br>I will endeavor to find enough privacy to do some recording over the next couple of weeks. Again, Merry Christmas!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>*hands everyone electrum-decorated, paired lightsporks* Don&#39;t ask how I got that much electrum. They can be joined to form a double-blade, or used separately. Each one contains a Kaiburr crystal (From KotOR-verse; if you&#39;re very lucky, you can get a decent amount of them randomly), a Topic Shard (from all of those topic breaks), and a Logic Fragment (Logic shatters under pressure from badfic). Yes, those last two seem to appear as shiny crystalline objects. The lightsporks could be any color, because having every one of them red from the Kaiburrs might not be such a good idea, and the other pseudo-crystals vary heavily in color. Enjoy the shiny objects!</p>

            <p>Decorations of red, green, gold and silver covered the walls of one of the medium sized meeting rooms of PPC HQ. Tinsel was draped from every wall and vertical object, banners were tacked onto walls and mistletoe hung in corners and dangled from the ceiling at various points in the room. A large pine tree, complete with a disgruntled looking, purple-haired young man dressed in a fairy costume tied to the top, dominated the centre of the room, festooned with more tinsel, strings of flashing lights and baubles and ornaments of various intricacy scattered across its green boughs.<br><br>Ansela sat on the edge of a table covered in party snacks, her legs swinging idly back and forth as she sang along heartily to a popular World One Christmas hit between mouthfuls of food. Another table nearby was covered in Bleep products of all kinds, kept in bottles of varying sizes and fullness. On the wall above and behind her, directly opposite the door, was fastened a banner that proclaimed to all and sundry <b>Merry Christmas <font size="1">or whatever other holiday you celebrate</font> and a Harry New Year!!!!</b><br><br>She checked her list. Decorations up? Check. Food procured? Check. Drinks present? Check. Invitations sent out? Yup, to every Console that she could access. Now she just had to wait for others to show up, then it would be party time!</p>

            <p>Zodfang, having decided to make his entrance with a mighty kick to the door, subsequently made his entrance as if he were a conquering king, confidently looking around as he strolled in, a wild grin baring his teeth.<br><br>  &quot;OI, &#39;OOMIES! DIS A PARTY OR WOT?!&quot; he shouted, before immediately setting course for the food and drink tables.<br><br>  Deciding to be a bit less conspicuous (and obnoxious) than his partner, Marcus simply <i>walked</i> into the room, closing the door behind him. A couple minutes after they had gotten back from that absurd double-mission and sent the report, the console had beeped again. Zodfang had been about to smash the damn thing, until they&#39;d seen that it wasn&#39;t a mission. Instead, it was an invitation from Ansela Jonla, to a Christmas party. Agent Ansela had joined sometime during Marcus&#39; suspension, but they&#39;d both heard of her at least somewhat. It helped that she had a reputation, especially for supposedly keeping a second Armoury behind closed doors. Marcus hadn&#39;t been too keen on going, mostly due to the mission putting him in a sour mood. However, while Zodfang had no concept of Christmas, he <i>did</i> have a concept of wild partying, and practically dragged Marcus out of the RC. Being even less keen on having his arms ripped off than going to the party, he elected to simply go along with the eerily-jovial Ork.<br><br>  <i>Besides,</i> the veteran agent thought. <i>It&#39;s Christmas, I might as well have some fun.</i><br><br>  That was what found him walking after his partner in the middle of a throng of Agents, all partying and enjoying themselves. There were some familiar faces, but a lot of them were people he didn&#39;t recognise. So many had died, retired, or been recruited in his year of absence that it wasn&#39;t surprising that he didn&#39;t know too many people he really noticed, but still somewhat saddening. Not that he&#39;d let that ruin his mood.<br><br>  &quot;Yo, Marcus!&quot;<br><br>  The voice caught his attention, causing him to look to his left where a peculiar-looking Agent stood. He was a young man with long black hair, wearing wire framed glasses on his boyish face. There was a bit of black to his uniform, but most of it (including the hood) was red and yellow. Marcus couldn&#39;t help the small smile that appeared on his face; this was an Agent he <i>did<i> remember, and one that&#39;d always amused him at that.<br><br>  &quot;Hello, agent Kalmer.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Didn&#39;t think you were the type to go f&#39;r these, man!&quot; Kalmer laughed, clearly a bit tipsy. He&#39;d always been strangely cheerful for someone who worked in the DAVD.<br><br>  &quot;Well, I am, sometimes. Why not? Figured, might as well have some fun if they chose <i>Christmas</i> to put me back in,&quot; Marcus replied, shrugging a little. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;ll just go mingle, might get a drink. See you later, Kalmer, we oughta catch up with each other sometime, anyway.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;No w...worr...what&#39;stheword? Worr...worries! Thassit! No worries, Marcus, sees ya!&quot;<br><br>  Stifling a laugh, Marcus left the drunk Agent to his own devices, seeing who he could run into. Besides, he had to keep Zodfang from hurting somebody.</i></i></p>

            <p>Moving through the crowd of agents, partly doing his own thing and partly looking for Zodfang before the Ork curbstomped someone or something like that, Marcus wasn&#39;t payting attention and stumbled when someone walked straight into him. Getting his footing back and turning to face the newcomer, he saw a young woman, probably 19-ish, with blonde hair and glasses. Judging from how she spoke, she was very inebriated, but that wasn&#39;t a surprise.<br><br>  &quot;Hello,&quot; Marcus said, a friendly smile on his face. &quot;Name&#39;s Marcus.

            <p>Marcus, somehow, didn&#39;t see the mistletoe that seemed to appear over his head, focusing too much on the conversation he was having with Cassie. She&#39;d apparently been recruited just before the Sue invasion, explaining why he hadn&#39;t met her before. She smiled and looked up, but just as he&#39;d started to look to see what she saw, Cassie drunkenly said &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; to him and promptly pressed her lips to his in a kiss that caught him off guard before he could reply.<br><br>  Taken aback for a second, Marcus couldn&#39;t decide whether to run away or go with the flow. Two different mindsets were grappling for his decision, especially the consideration of just how much older than Cassie he probably was. Still, after a couple seconds he relaxed and returned the kiss, moving his body closer to hers.<br><br>  <i>Don&#39;t most people find a room for this sort of thing?</i> he couldn&#39;t help but think.<br><br>  Meanwhile, at one of the snack tables, Zodfang looked up from the prodigious amount of food and drink he was wolfing down to see his partner in the crowd, a mistletoe over his head and kissing some random female Agent. His shoulders shook with the suppressed laughter as his attention turned to an Agent at his side and the grog in his cup. &#39;Oomies could be so strange.</p>

            <p>a bright flash distracted both Marcus and Cassie.

            <p>Everything had happened too quickly for Marcus&#39; tastes. One second, he had randomly been kissed by Cassie, and returned the favour, but just as he had been getting into it, they&#39;d been distracted by several bright flashes. Detaching himself from the liplock and feeling his arm being grabbed, he saw agent Luxury standing there with a camera in hand and a grin on her face. Before he could say anything though, Cassie had lunged at the other blonde and ended up on the floor as Lux fled. This had the unfortunate side effect of pulling Marcus to the ground, too, where he got his bearings after landing next to Cassie and cursing Lux mildly in his thoughts.<br><br>  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; he managed to say in response to Cassie&#39;s apology, his face starting to turn a bit red. The whole party had been not much more than embarrassing so far, and now he found himself hoping Luxury wasn&#39;t the type to try to blackmail him. Then he heard the voice of another Agent and looked up, noticing another young agent standing there and offering her hands to Cassie and himself. The woman was laughing uncontrollably, for some reason, heightening Marcus&#39; embarrassment.<br><br>  &quot;You could say that,&quot; he said in response to her asking if he needed help up, pulling on her arm a bit for leverage as he pushed himself up to his feet. &quot;Hey, Cassie, you alright down there?</p>

            <p>Brushing himself off from the bear hug, Marcus failed to hide his amusement as Cassie went after the elf, having almost forgotten about Zodfang, who was busy boisterously reciting war stories to a bunch of rowdy and drunk agents in some other corner of the room. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder if everyone who&#39;d been recruited since he&#39;d been suspended (the word still put a bitter taste in his mouth) was that interesting as he looked to the new girl who had appeared. She was another one he didn&#39;t really recognise, for some reason. Shorter than Cassie, though, and with curly brown hair.<br><br>  &quot;Heh, is she always like that?&quot;<br><br>  He figured it would be a good way to start a conversation with Sara (though he didn&#39;t know this was her name), especially since he actually was curious about if Cassie always acted that way. If nothing else, it&#39;d break the ice.<br><br>(OOC: Sorry it&#39;s not got much to it, writer&#39;s block.)</p>

            <p>Despite saying this, Marcus was only slightly less amused than Sara was as he watched Cassie&#39;s display, taking his eyes off of her snogging the elf just long enough to take one of Sara&#39;s arms and try to pull her to her feet.<br><br>  &quot;I&#39;m Marcus, by the way,&quot; he said, having not gotten the chance to introduce himself earlier.

            <p>Someone fairly tall and skinny, but with enough muscle to shove nearly everyone else out of her way.

One moment she was enjoying herself with a quick Christmas kiss (that had lasted well over twenty seconds already, but she had lost all time sense by now) and the next there was a sharp pain in her hair -her <i>hair</i>? - and she was lying on her back on the floor with Nat glaring down at her.<br><br>&quot;All right, pal.&quot; The Welsh girl&#39;s voice was dangerously low. &quot;Just what do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;<br><br>Sitting up with all the drunken dignity she could muster, Cassie replied, &quot;I was jus&#39; show&#39;n him &#39;bout kissing un&#39;er the mistl-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Scaring the poor lad to death is what you were doing!&quot; Nat hissed. &quot;Just look at him!&quot;<br><br>Cassie obediently tried to focus, but the alcohol caught up with her eyesight, and a moment later, her consciousness.

            <p>Zodfang had been attracted by the noise and Nat forcing her way through the crowd, leaving the group of agents around the grog for the moment and following her. Due to his sheer size, he had an easier time of this than Nat, easily able to see over the heads of many of the agents, and helped even more by violently shoving any agent that got too close/in the way/he felt like shoving. When he got there, he was greeted by the sight of Sara sitting on a very unconscious Cassie, with Nat, Marcus, and an Elf agent he didn&#39;t know anything of standing around them.<br><br>  &quot;I think it&#39;s kind of self explanatory, Zodfang,&quot; said Marcus, before moving forward and squatting down behind Sara. &quot;C&#39;mon, I think Cass might need to go to Medical, or at least she&#39;ll need that Purple Stuff.&quot;<br><br>  Having said that, Marcus hooked his arms under Sara&#39;s, getting a hold just below her chest if she didn&#39;t resist.

            <p>and stepped back to give her some room to move. When Nat rounded on Cassie, Marcus found himself sighing, advising the tall woman to be careful lest she knock Cassie out again. Unlike his Ork partner, he didn&#39;t find the random display of violence appropriate, or even amusing, actually quite pointless. As if purely to provide a contrast, the Elf agent with them glanced curiously at Zodfang, who immediately grunted threateningly at the Elf as if saying &quot;what, you wanna fight?&quot;. Regardless, when Sara spoke, Marcus nodded in agreement, though a bit red as Cassie started to realise what she had done.<br><br>  &quot;There&#39;s really no reason to hit her, you know. Unless you just enjoy smacking people around. I mean, really, this is a party, it&#39;s natural people will get a bit tipsy, and it&#39;s not like she did anything serious. There&#39;s no reason for anyone to be fighting in here, we do that enough on missions!&quot; Marcus paused to chuckle a little, then continued. &quot;Let&#39;s just take it easy for once, okay? Actually, I don&#39;t think I even know who either you or the Elf are, mind an introduction since we&#39;ve already seemed to have gotten off on a bad start? Name&#39;s Marcus.&quot;</p>

I&#39;m Nat, by the way.&quot; This last comment was to all three.

Cassie introduced me to, um, Georgia and Kumori a while back, but-&quot; He looked over at Cassie, but she was currently facing the opposite direction to them and trying to stop her face from going redder.<br><br>&quot;Anyway,&quot; Nat cut in, &quot;who are you lot, then?&quot;</p>

            <p>Knowing Zodfang would probably launch into some hot-blooded boasting session at the slightest prompt, Marcus chose to answer Sara before the Ork could, ignoring Zodfang&#39;s disgruntled scowl. Of course, that was for naught as the Ork spoke anyway.<br><br>  &quot;Dat&#39;s right, ya grots! I&#39;m Zodfang, da biggest an&#39; baddest Ag-&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Yeah, yeah, we get it. Nice to meet you all, now that we&#39;re not beating each other senseless.&quot; Marcus cut the Ork off sharply, but in a way that seemed more out of jest than malice. Before either of them could say something else, Sara laughed, said that they should party, and grabbed Cassie and Nat, running off into the throng of other agents. <br><br>  This just left Kelvin with Marcus and Zodfang, who looked awfully tempted to reach over and throttle the Elf.<br><br>  &quot;&#39;E doesn&#39;t look &#39;ard &#39;nuff to be an Agent...&quot; Zodfang mused, only for Marcus to roll his eyes in response.<br><br>  &quot;Leave the man alone, Zodfang. He&#39;s probably a rookie. Come on, let&#39;s go enjoy the party.&quot; Marcus said, but looking to Kelvin for a second before turning around to join the other partygoers. &quot;Don&#39;t let this place break you, it&#39;s not as bad as they all say.&quot;<br><br>  With that, he walked off, though Zodfang feinted at Kelvin for a second before laughing in his face and going off to bother somebody else.</p>

Once he had given himself time to unwind, he was really starting to enjoy himself, though unlike many others in the room he hadn&#39;t sampled any holiday &quot;spirit&quot;, having had a strong distaste for alcohol ever since he ended up rat-arse drunk on the floor of HQ and drafted in as an Agent. He was having fun, though, and he supposed that was what mattered.<br><br>  He hadn&#39;t known Kelvin was following him, though, so the Elf&#39;s voice grabbed his attention as he continued to walk, trying to focus on not plowing through people while answering the nervous Elf&#39;s rapid-fire questions.<br><br>  &quot;Huh? Oh, yeah, I did. It&#39;s just that the PPC has a tendency to drive its Agents batshit crazy after a while, y&#39;know? Some dangerously so, but we usually put them in FicPsych or just kick &#39;em out. Um...that&#39;s pretty much what they <i>do</i> say, mostly the &#39;all PPCers are nuts&#39; thing and that HQ and Upstairs are out to get us. It&#39;s not that bad, really, eventually you even get used to having to kill Sues all the time.&quot;<br><br>  He kept walking after saying this, drawing his attention away from Kelvin for a second, but seemed to remember something and thought better of it. &quot;Oh, and sorry about Zodfang. He&#39;s an Ork, they&#39;re all like that, and I don&#39;t think he can really help it. It&#39;s what happens when you put someone from Warha-oh, sorry!&quot;<br><br>  He had been cut off, and then apologised, because just as he had started to finish explaining Zodfang&#39;s situation, he ran straight into agent Kumori, staggering back and shaking his head after firing off an apology. The agent he ran into didn&#39;t seem to be in any bad shape from it, but he thought he should say something.<br><br>  &quot;Sorry about that, I wasn&#39;t paying attention. You&#39;re all right, I&#39;d assume?&quot;</p>

            <p>...of Kumori&#39;s name. However, he had enough tact to follow her request and not bring it up, as much as he was tempted to make a snarky comment. He found himself half-wondering what had possessed her parents to give her such an odd name, but no matter. He couldn&#39;t leave her hanging after requesting his name.<br><br>  &quot;Marcus Langston, also Department of Floaters. Odd, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve met before but I&#39;ve been an agent for a long time. Ah well, Response Centre&#39;s 5593, it&#39;s a bit out of the way, that&#39;s probably why. Still, pleasure you meet you, Kumori, just hope next time it&#39;s not by literally running into you.&quot; Marcus smirked a little at the Elf after saying this, &quot;Yeah, I bet you&#39;re having <i>fun</i>, eh?&quot;<br><br>  A wink and a quick nudge of the elbow were given to Kelvin, Marcus unable to resist teasing him a little. All in good fun, of course.</p>

This is typically seen in counterpoint to the other, purely dominant half of the desired pairing.<br><br>The syndrome can be frequently seen in couples who are equally strong-willed in canon. Theoretically the writer or such couples believes that all gay pairings must have a 100% uke and 100% seme, with no reversal, and thus changes one of them to fit their idea of &#39;uke&#39;.<br><br>There are many other occurrences, all in varying degrees of severity.<br><br>Beginning symptoms include but are not limited to: excessive crying, blushing, stuttering, lack of willpower, loss of strength and common fighting sense, clinginess,  fainting, and never dreaming of topping.<br><br>More severe cases involve: an innate knowledge of cooking and/or housework, a sudden change in body structure to a more feminine and slender build, a sudden innocence and obliviousness to all sexuality around them and any attraction to them, a decrease in size of their manhood, a tendency to cross dress in frilly maid/nurse/kink outfits, an inability to do any canon athletics including getting jars from high shelves, and excessive overreacting in high voices.<br><br>The afflicted WUS sufferer&#39;s symptoms have a tendency to mold him to his partner and make him utterly helpless without. See Damsel in Distress (DID).<br><br>Those infected with WUS are more susceptible to rape, wangst, and mpreg.</i><br><br>What do you think, DBS <s>read: Pads and Trojie</s>?

            <p>My name is Tasari/Glass/Tatharien and I read manga.  I am a yaoi fan.  I have an extensive collection of manga scans featuring males getting friendly and/or naked.  My least favorite of these follow the seme/uke polarization trend very strongly.  There are quite a few mangaka (and hence fanwriters, poorly informed about gay male relationships) that do this.  This is a form of fetishization and no more accurate to most people&#39;s lives and experiences than most other fetishes are to everyday life.  It is, however, a strong stereotype, though articulated differently in different regions.  Unfortunately, one of the warning signs of poor writing is lack of research...</p>

            <p>After several months of lurking, I introduce my agents, Paladin and Scathach<br><br>Agent Paladin<br>Age:25<br>Paladin is a returning agent. He was originally an intelligence operative for the DMS and quite good at his job. After a few months in service he was offered a posistion as an assassin, but he declined and left the PPC, citing that he &quot;lacked the proper bloodlust.&quot;<br>He spent the next five years wandering the multiverse. Now he has come back, much changed by his experiences. While he doesn&#39;t generally talk about his travels, it seems he suffered quite a bit, for those who knew him before say he is much more cynical, grim, and edgy. However, he still has his sense of humor, and generally is in good spirits.<br><br>Agent Scathach:<br>Age: 21<br>Scathach was a top assassin in the DMS, specifically the Anime and Manga division. Unfortunately, a particularly powerful Sue got the drop on her and blasted her. The PPC was able to save her, but much of her body was replaced by cybernetic components. Because of this, she was not allowed to retire, but retained by the PPC as a prototype. She hasn&#39;t completely gotten over the incident, nor has she finished adjusting to her new abilities. In her personal life, Scathach is a hardcore dedicated Otaku, which is what drew her to the PPC in the first place. <br><br>Both of them have been recruited to DAVD, Paladin for his experience in the field, and Scathach for her capabilities. Together they form a special unit to deal with the worst of badfic. Because of their front-line status, they also tend to get access to cutting edge tech and weapons from DoSAT. <br><br>Writing sample: <a href="http://nova-paladin.livejournal.com/21207.html"><a href="http://nova-paladin.livejournal.com/21207.html">http://nova-paladin.livejournal.com/21207.html</a></a><br><br>The fic I intend to destroy: <a href="http://www.monstersandangels.com/matalk/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=189"><a href="http://www.monstersandangels.com/matalk/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=189">http://www.monstersandangels.com/matalk/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=189</a></a> <br>(Warning, both fic and host site are very NSFW/B.

            <p>If your writing sample wasn&#39;t friend-locked, so I could actually read it...<br><br>(I&#39;ve both friended you and left a comment on your LJ, so it should be easy for you to find me)<br><br>Writing considerations aside, one thing concerns me - all field agents count as &quot;front line&quot; agents, so you&#39;re not likely to get any special treatment for that. Agent sanity (the more the better) and/or unique targets are much more likely to get prototype weapons, but as any software engineer can tell you, &quot;prototype&quot; really is just a market-speak synonym for &quot;buggy and incomplete&quot;. (And any PPC-engineered cybernetics are likely to be very... unique. In a C3PO meets Inspector Gadget sort of way.)<br><br>As it stands, these agents could be very well written, and they could be very poorly written. I&#39;d like to see your writing sample.</p>

            <p>You can&#39;t see it? Nuts, I thought I&#39;d gotten around that by posting the URL directly. Ah well, I&#39;ll fiddle around with it and fix it. <br><br>As for your concerns, I suppose &quot;front-line agents&quot; was a bad choice of words. The idea I was trying to get across was that Scathach and Paladin have access to a wide array of of weapons and tools, especially since they&#39;ll almost certainly need them. The reason I made them prototypes is that no one has bothered to use them before, and I couldn&#39;t justify the agents just pulling new heavy weaponry out of thin air. Of course, most the of the tech I wanted to use is from one cannon or another anyway, so it&#39;s not exactly new.<br><br>At any rate, I&#39;ll try reposting the the journal entry to the PPC group or something.<br></p>

            <p>It probably fluctuates. There could be a dozen Untanglers one day and a hundred the next without anyone actually joining or quitting, due to the shifts in time-space. Some may be present in the here-and-now more frequently than others--for example, Trojie and Pads exist far more than Nume and Ilraen do most of the time, and they exist more than someone like Head Nurse Suzine in FicPsych, who has a name but hasn&#39;t actually had any spoken dialogue (yet).<br><br>In the case of the Invasion, there were probably more existent agents due to the fact that the universe was paying attention to them.

            <p>Many elements of the PPC have been retconned or changed over time. My money&#39;s on the exact number being uncertain, with 75 million or so the absolute maximum possible. Still, several thousand at any one time makes the most time.</p>

            <p>These are even more confusing than most badfic. I mean, it&#39;s almost impossible to tell what is the story and what are the author&#39;s notes. Do these people have any concept of how to construct a story...okay, I guess not. Still, *wanders away, muttering*</p>

            <p>&#39;Poster expressions&#39; is very, very screwed up. It just might be for the DoWTF. The &#39;Yue&#39; ones... well... Japanese? In LOTR? Stupid, stupid Suvians. No. Just no. Never mind the fact that the name makes it sound a whole lot like a Naruto crossover, even if it wasn&#39;t supposed to be one. Honestly, I&#39;m getting sick of all this retarded filth. Someone really should take a large, burning, and preferably pointy object to these &#39;fics.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think this has ever been done before, except in passing, so I think there&#39;s a need to lay down what, exactly, permission givers are, and what we aren&#39;t.<br><br>When Jay left the PPC, she had to set up some system whereby a degree of quality control would exist for potential PPC spinoffs. She gave Miss Cam, GreyLadyBast and Thalia Weaver the right to decide whether or not any given Boarder could write for the PPC. That right has been passed down through various people, until it came to the permission givers of today (see <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission_Giver">the Wiki</a>). That&#39;s the history.<br><br>The purpose of the permission givers is to give permission. Very simple, no? The permission in question is permission to write spinoffs. In fact, permission givers have only three powers:<br><br>1/ To decide who is permitted to write a PPC spinoff.<br><br>2/ To revoke that permission when someone has clearly lost track of what they&#39;re doing. (This one&#39;s never been invoked, but I think it&#39;s implicit)<br><br>3/ To pass on permission giving rights to anyone else they choose. (This power is also held by the Board at large, although not by individual members)<br><br>So that&#39;s what permission givers are. Now let&#39;s cover what we&#39;re not.<br><br>We are not moderators or administrators or lawgivers or trendsetters. We&#39;re not in charge of the Board. We&#39;re not in charge of the PPC.<br><br>On another slightly incidental note, we&#39;re not arbitrators of what can or cannot become PPC canon. If one of us writes something, it has no more natural authority than anyone else&#39;s writings. When I write Crashing Down or End of the Beginning, it&#39;s purely because I enjoy writing it (usually). If someone wants to ignore it in their PPC writings, that&#39;s their choice, and they are entirely allowed to do that. By the same token, I&#39;m then free to try and reconcile the two -- but not in any official capacity. That&#39;s just me being a meddler, and I wouldn&#39;t try to claim that anything they&#39;d written was officially Not Canon.<br><br>So basically all we are is a filtering system to keep PPC missions looking like PPC missions. If you&#39;ve got permission already, we&#39;re no more important to you than any other member of the Board.<br><br>This has been your &quot;hS isn&#39;t <i>actually</i> a minor deity&quot; post for the year. Thank you and goodnight.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>On two counts, actually:<br><br>1/ As said, the only thing that&#39;s canon is whatever you want to be.<br><br>2/ The Origins-Lofty Skies story at least, and probably the Reorganisation as well, are internal accounts written by someone who wasn&#39;t there at the time.

            <p>I think the most appropriate would be nemeses, though. Could be wrong. And then there&#39;s the plural of apocalypse, which I&#39;m betting very few people have ever needed.<br><br>My dictionary says &#39;smote&#39; is the correct past tense, with &#39;smitten&#39; as past perfect?

            <p>Though really, hS, I think it&#39;s the sheer amount of <i>stuff</i> you churn out on a regular basis that has earned you the reputation of a minor deity--that and the fact that it&#39;s <i>good</i> stuff.

            <p>So you&#39;re both of you old enough to be married, but you&#39;re not old enough for a visa that will let you live in the same country? Someone somewhere really didn&#39;t think that one through.<br><br>Could be worse though. You could be trying to move to NZ. They don&#39;t let you in, last time I checked, just because you&#39;ve a spouse there, or even if you&#39;ve a child who&#39;s a citizen. You have to have valuable skills to offer the country too. Which, unfortunately, means my plan to emigrate and be Trojie&#39;s nanny/librarian/muse may need some work.</p>
