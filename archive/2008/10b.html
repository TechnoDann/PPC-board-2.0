            <p>For those of you who remember, Mystia and I took on a mission a while back and promptly proceeded to procrastinate like the wind. Approximately a year later we got back to it, and lo and behold the first part (split in two, because livejournal is like that) is already written up and ready for your viewing.<br><br><a href="http://mysticcreep.livejournal.com/907.html"><a href="http://mysticcreep.livejournal.com/907.html">http://mysticcreep.livejournal.com/907.html</a></a><br>The first half of the first part<br><br><a href="http://mysticcreep.livejournal.com/1264.html"><a href="http://mysticcreep.livejournal.com/1264.html">http://mysticcreep.livejournal.com/1264.html</a></a><br>The second half of the first part<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2761420/1/Expect_the_Unexpected"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2761420/1/Expect_the_Unexpected">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2761420/1/Expect_the_Unexpected</a></a><br>The target<br><br>Enjoy the fireworks, kids =D</p>

            <p>This looks good so far. You guys make a good team. Also, I know just enough about Yu Yu Hakusho to be really annoyed by Kurama&#39;s characterization, so I&#39;m glad to see this dealt with.<br><br>I have one nitpick, and that is that Bleepka is not alcoholic. It is explicitly &quot;pseudo-alcoholic,&quot; because Bleep-products and alcohol tend to explode on contact. Mind you, some intrepid folks have actually managed alcoholic Bleep-products (e.g. the Pan-Galactic Gargle Bleeprin Blaster), but Bleepka is not one of them. The Wiki isn&#39;t very specific about these things, but if you check out the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/menu.html">Substance Menu,</a> you&#39;ll get more details.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m so happy we got this much done. Boogey and I collaborated on this part but the majority of the writing is his. The next part will be mostly my doing and will be up NOT a year from now, but much sooner. Boogey will come up with deadlines for me and will punish me if I don&#39;t meet them. And not in the sexy hunkydory punishment way because that&#39;s not the way Boogeyman and I do things.<br><br>We love you all like crazy, and we ought to post on the boards more often instead of lurking like we do and we know that. And therefore, we welcome concrit in all its forms. <br><br>Much love and hugs,<br>Mystia</p>

            <p>Would anyone be interested in a &#39;Costume&#39; Party, what with Halloween coming up?<br><br>Idea would be instead of using our usual usernames, we&#39;d use a costume thing for username, or go by a character&#39;s name - thus being in costume/disguise.<br><br>And then do this on either the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/Indices/241484.html">secondary board</a> or the <a href="http://pub19.bravenet.com/chat/show.php/1551371238">Bravo chat</a>, or maybe even both?<br><br>Using the second board has the advantage of what&#39;s going on being recorded where everyone can see it, but disadvantage in that your disguise can be undermined by people just checking your IP address. Chat has advantage of immediacy and anonymity (fairly sure, at least) but disadvantage of not able to record it unless someone constantly copies while they&#39;re in there.<br><br>And be either from the 17th to 19th or 24th to 26th. Since I figure Halloween weekend anyone doing Halloween stuff would be doing that.<br><br>Who is interested, which&#39;d be better (or just say &quot;Both!&quot;), and which weekend? </p>

            <p>*nurses bruised arms* As I have been so <i>pointedly</i> reminded - ;p - I promised you all a copy of my university project, the informative essay on fanfiction. So... here it is.<br><br>Let me say, though, that I sincerely hope you won&#39;t be disappointed - this was not, after all, written for those of us who already know the fanfic world, but rather as an introduction for those who <i>don&#39;t</i>. So there won&#39;t be anything here that you lot don&#39;t already know.<br><br>I was going to do this on LJ or googledocs, but my nice formatting with the pictures would have been lost, so instead I&#39;ve turned it into a PDF file - two of them, actually. A <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=2Z38QPHM">long version</a>, which includes the appendix, citations and bibliography, and a <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=JQKJP2O6">short version</a>, which does not, and should be nicer to slow connections. <br><br>In case you wonder about the thin black box under the subtitle - that was my name, but as I&#39;d like to keep my internet and real life identites separate, I blacked it out. Not that I don&#39;t trust you, of course - :) - but I do want to publish a longer version of this as a proper book someday - soon - and so I&#39;m a little protective. Hence, also, why I made it a PDF. Please don&#39;t share it around too much; show people, sure (particularly parents and teachers - who complain about us &quot;wasting our time&quot; on the net - hint, hint, Ciri), but don&#39;t give other people copies of the file, or link them to the download. Please. <br><br>If any of you don&#39;t have the reader program for PDF files, email me and I&#39;ll send you a Word copy. <a href="mailto:fanwriter_sedri@hotmail.com">fanwriter_sedri@hotmail.com</a><br><br>Feel free to tell me if you find anything you disagree with, that is factually wrong, or that you think I misinterpreted. Spelling/punctuation errors too, if you want, but as it&#39;s already been handed in, there&#39;s not much point there.<br><br>And... yeah. Hope you like it - particularly those of you I interviewed. *crosses fingers*<br><br>- Sedri</p>

I had to prove fanfic and role-play weren&#39;t ruining my life through sheer persistence, which often wasn&#39;t pretty. ^<em>^;<br><br>Anyway, it&#39;s a very well-written essay. The way you keep coming back to <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> and <i>Wicked</i> really helps tie it together.<br><br>And, a little self-indulgent moment: Yay, I got quoted! ^</em>^ I&#39;m glad I said something useful to you.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I was having trouble trying to use examples that everyone would know, sticking with things like Harry Potter, LotR and so on, but my teacher gave me the idea of describing one story early on to frame it, so I took that idea and ran with it.

            <p>Megaupload does a lot of advertising - sorry &#39;bout that - and makes things rather complex. <br><br>The links I gave you will go to a very busy page with no direct download link - you need to find an orange &quot;download&quot; button next to a box and a three-letter picture code. Enter the code, hit the button, and it will take you to another busy page with a table showing how their premium downloads are so much better. Ignore that and look at the little button saying &quot;please wait _ seconds&quot; - it has a countdown from thirty, then turns into a &quot;free download&quot; button. Click that.<br><br>Sorry again. <br><br>In better news, I just made an account at FictionPress to host the whole thing there, permanenetly, but they have a two-day waiting period for new members, so I can&#39;t put it up just yet.

            <p>I really don&#39;t know. When summarising a fanfic, I always have a general idea of what fanfic readers are attracted by (particularly the types of readers I want - ie, not dragging a book purist into a Susan/Caspian story), but with original fiction... bah. <br><br>It probably says something that I read your summaries and didn&#39;t start reading the stories. (Something besides the fact that I have almsot no spare time.) I skimmed one of them, but not already knowing the characters, I couldn&#39;t fall in easily.<br><br>I suppose the most important thing for an original fic summary is to make it sound familiar; give potential readers a grounding with something they already know (say, an apparently stock character - the Innocent Princess, for example) and then give an enticing twist (one of my favourite childrens&#39; books was called &quot;The Tough Princess&quot;). <br><br>In general... I&#39;d say it needs to be enticing without seeming to beg. Quotes from the text would be good, if you can find something concise and illustrative enough. <br><br>... Actually, I really don&#39;t know. *shrug* Sorry.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll pick your brain about other things. Which story did you skim, and what could I do to make it more fall-into-able, given that you&#39;re not expected to know the characters?<br><br>I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;ve garnered a lot of hits on my stories, but only three actual comments, and two of those on older works that I&#39;m not really concerned about at the moment. I understand time constraints, but I was really hoping for good critical reading whenever people were/are able to do it. &quot;Opportunity&quot; is really short. So is &quot;Natural Consequences.&quot; Pick a single element of a story to critique, even. Title, summary, intro, ending, description(s)... I know I need a better title for &quot;Fugitive,&quot; for example. It doesn&#39;t really say anything useful about the story.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m coming off as pushy or anything like that. I&#39;m just sick of not getting anything beyond &quot;that&#39;s cool&quot; and &quot;I liked it&quot; from my RL friends and family. I mean, compliments are good, too, but tell my <i>why</i> it was cool, or <i>what</i> made you like it if that&#39;s the case. If something doesn&#39;t work, why not? {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh, who probably should have been clearer about what she wanted in the original post.</p>

            <p>You just need to make the summary memorable. Stock characters are a good way to go, they&#39;re easy to remember and identify with, but word it wrong and you can make it sound cliche. For me, to make a good summary, you need to give away a small detail that the readers will find out quickly, and make it interesting. One of the best summaries I&#39;ve seen came from one of my friends for her Sailor Moon fanfic:<br><br>&#39;Dane&#39;s not fussed she&#39;s suddenly the stormheeled warrior, Sailor Aello. she&#39;s got more important stuff to be concerned about then wangsting over a past life. That chainsaw inspired youma rushing at her head for example...&#39;<br><br>From that, we know it&#39;s set in the Sailor Senshi Universe, the character, unlike most, isn&#39;t thrilled to be one of the Sailor Scouts, and makes it funny. That instantly caught my attention (Even though I don&#39;t follow Sailor Moon) and made me have a look-see.<br>Now, let&#39;s take a look at &#39;Opportunity&#39;.<br><br>&#39;A young king, having just taken back his family&#39;s crown, seeks advice from a loyal duke. How the heck do you rule a whole kingdom, anyway? Same world as &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn&quot; and &quot;Fugitive;&quot; different time and place. Completed May, 2008.&#39;<br><br>Ok, we can tell it&#39;s slightly unusual, because the King doesn&#39;t know what to do. However, what throws people off is the latter part of it. Most, if they follow your stories, would assume it&#39;s set in the same Universe, and usually they don&#39;t really care when it&#39;s completed. I know that does sound harsh, but if you saw that on a story, you&#39;d probably pass over it.<br>Now, let&#39;s see if we can pump some life into it!<br><br>&#39;Oliver, having just come to the throne of his Kingdom has come to an epic conclusion; he has no idea how to be king! Deciding to better himself, he seeks out the advice of one of his most trusted subjects to find what it truly means to be King.&#39;<br><br>Though it might be me being biased, that one seems a little more energetic. It seems a little lighter than what you might be going for though, so I&#39;ll try again.<br><br>&#39;With his enemies defeated and his family restored to the throne, King Oliver must try to understand what it is to be a King. Realising he can&#39;t take this journey alone, he seeks the help of one of his family&#39;s most trusted Advisors.&#39;<br><br>It&#39;s more stoic than the last, but it gets the information across. The word &#39;Journey&#39; also peaks the responder&#39;s interest, and may make them more likely to click.<br>But yeah, that&#39;s just what&#39;s happened with me. Hopefully this helped!</p>

            <p>I really appreciate the feedback. With my college years coming to an end, I&#39;m trying to get serious about this, because it&#39;s what I really want to do aside from my &quot;real&quot; job.<br><br>I&#39;ve updated most of the summaries now, so I hope they&#39;re better.

            <p>As I have a ring size something like Q-and-a-half, which is bigger than they usually stock, at least for womens&#39; rings.

            <p>And I certainly agree with kicking the sexist traditions. I don&#39;t want to wear white - not all white. If he&#39;s wearing a tux, I&#39;ll have a black-and-white dress... though I&#39;d rather something with colour, like green or blue. Light blue. Like the Earth.

            <p>It&#39;s only pretty recently that the &quot;white dress&quot; tradition came in, and it seems to be going out of style now.

Apparently there was a couple who were married in the family-owned grocery store, in full traditional wedding regalia, with the bride&#39;s mother sitting at the counter and continuing to conduct business throughout the whole ceremony. And another; &quot;It was at the local courthouse, they stopped on the way there to buy milk and bread, and they wore regular clothes, the groom in jeans.&quot; Well, it&#39;s a lot less fuss than the usual way ... I think, if I get married, I&#39;ll deliberately try to make my wedding so horrifying someone sends it to etiquettehell.com.</p>

            <p>Snap! I wear a Q and a half ring; my engagement ring had to be resized cos I couldn&#39;t even get it over my knuckle :)<br><br>And it&#39;s white gold ... because while I prefer silver, I also have the mystical power to turn it black within a day.

            <p>Most of my jewelery (and I don&#39;t have much) is sterling silver or steel, and I tend to turn it all red - oxidisation, I guess. It takes a few weeks, months if I&#39;m lucky, but the inside of my watch is all red, and all the chains of my necklaces wear away to red eventually, too.<br><br>*ponders* So what would we call the Marvelverse Trojie?

            <p><i>Greetings, Agents and Authors, from the Department of Intelligence. I am the Sub Rosa, and I would like to take a minute or two of your time.<br><br>As you know, my Department is tasked with investigating bad fanfiction and determining whether it requires the PPC&#39;s attention. You Agents may think you are overworked, but believe me, without us you wouldn&#39;t even have time to </i>breathe<i> between missions.<br><br>You may remember that Agent Architeuthis was kind enough to post some of her intelligence reports on the HQ network for all to read, and that they made their way from there onto the internet. Now that we have time to breathe again, we are interested in taking this idea and running with it. To that end, we have co-opted a section of your &quot;<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">PPC Wiki</a>&quot; to use as a portal for our reports.</i><br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Intelligence/Reports">Department of Intelligence Reports</a><br><br><i>We hope that these reports will, in combination with the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Unclaimed_Badfic">List of Unclaimed Badfic</a>, make it easier and simpler for you Authors to choose missions for your Agents, and for you Agents to understand what you&#39;re getting into.<br><br>I wish you all the best of luck in not getting killed.<br><br>~The Sub Rosa, Head, Department of Intelligence</i><br><br>(What the Sub Rosa didn&#39;t say is that this isn&#39;t a closed area. If you&#39;re feeling bored, and don&#39;t feel up to a full mission, why not write up a quick report? You can create an Agent specifically for the DoI, or let one of your Agents do a bit of transfer work, or if you have an Agent who wants to retire, you could transfer them into Intelligence. Hopefully these reports will be <i>useful</i>, as well as entertaining. They don&#39;t need to be announced on the Board, or cleared with anyone [although I think I&#39;ll have to say that you need Permission to write them, since they are actual PPC stories], and as I&#39;ve tried to get across on the page in question, they don&#39;t preclude a mission being written for that story -- in fact, they&#39;re meant to <i>help</i> the mission-writer, or at least the mission-selecter.<br><br>And, of course, they&#39;re meant to be fun! So write them if you want to, don&#39;t if you don&#39;t... it&#39;s up to you.<br><br>hS)</p>

            <p>Contrary to appearances, I am not in fact dead, in jail, or on the run from giant vampire gerbils.

This is the most over-the-top Mary Sue I&#39;ve seen in a long time. It&#39;s just ... remarkable. There are no words. You have to see it. This Sue might need more than two Agents to take her down. A lot more.<br><br>I&#39;m thinking of doing a major dissection of that fic over on Wandering Criticism. If there was ever a textbook example of how <i>not</i> to write LotR fanfic (or how not to write, period), that is it right there.</p>

            <p>(note: Repost from the LJ group. It&#39;s more or less an introduction)<br><br>It has been many a year since I last heard of the PPC. I don&#39;t even remember how long ago it was, honestly, but a long time indeed. Last time I checked it was really just Jay and Acacia, along with a few other brave souls. I made cause with them, but honestly I couldn&#39;t get through enough bad fanfics to actually write anything. As time went by I became distracted, and wandered away from this corner of the internet. I figured this little adventure would have eventually played it self out, leaving behind, at best, a decaying, obsolete website.<br><br>So, imagine my surprise while wandering the awesomness that is TVTropes in finding that the PCC was still around. You guys have done damn well for yourselves, and have carved out your own niche in cyberspace. In fact, from what I&#39;ve seen, you&#39;re better organized and growing faster then most of the online communities I&#39;m part of, not to mention the Real World ones. You guys should be proud of yourselves.<br><br>Anyway, enough ramblings from an old-timer (well, relatively speaking). In more relevent news, have you guys had a chance to take a stab at the new contender for the title of &quot;World&#39;s Worst Fanfic&quot; AKA &quot;My Immortal?&quot; (No, really. Google &quot;worst fanfic&quot; and it&#39;s the first hit). If not, it definitely needs it. Worst Sue I&#39;ve ever seen, and quite possible one of the more disturbing things on the internet, and believe me, I&#39;ve seen a lot.<br><br>Happy hunting!<br>~Paladin</p>

            <p>Yup. New. Came into knowledge of the PPC when a friend kept talking about conversations between a Sith and a Cardassian. Needless to say I was curious and have been hovering around the PPC wiki for a while now reading up when possible. Still at it too. <br><br>But what drove me to make this post and make myself known and support the PPC? I read a certain Stufic known as Halo: Halos in Space and after my eyes stoped bleeding I swore to myself I that I couldn&#39;t just stand by while people butcher my favorite subjects and the English language I love so much.<br><br>So here I am, casting my die in to kill the Badfic and send those who write them scampering back to their 6th grade English classes.</p>

            <p>DS9, Voyager, TNG, The TNG Movies, TOS Movies, Enterprise, TOS. Yes, i know its odd, but the movies about the original crew seem better than the show. Maybe because they weren&#39;t using crappy props anymore? Enterprise is higher than TOS cause its pretty... messes with the Canon I think though. I &#39;like&#39; it about as much as I &#39;like&#39; The Force Unleashed being Canon -_- but hey, its Lucas&#39; world he wants to muck that up he can. The Original Series though was just... well... at the time i can assume it was cool but now it just seems silly... [sing] Bounce the forward particle beam of the main deflector dish.

            <p>...an extremely hilarious (though mildly inappropriate) song by a most wonderful artist by the name of Voltaire. <br>Though not to be confused with the witty dead Frenchman of similar title, he is equally awesome. I&#39;ve seen him perform live twice to date. ^_^<br><br>Anyway, I can probably send you the song if you&#39;ve got MSN Messenger or AIM- file transfers and all that, if you can take mp3 or mp4 files. Or you could look it up on YouTube.<br><br>Suffice to say it&#39;s based on Trek&#39;s tendency to get out of certain doom with large amounts of technical jargon that somehow explain everything. (Geordi&#39;s quite good at it.) With added pokes to all the series, but it&#39;s quite funny. <br><br>TNG is probably my favorite series, though DS9 and Voyager are cool.

            <p>I&#39;ve added you on MSN - I&#39;m <a href="mailto:fanwriter_sedri@hotmail.com">fanwriter_sedri@hotmail.com</a>. mp3 is fine, though you might just want to do it by emiail, as I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll ever be online at the same time - time zones and all that.<br><br>Do you know there are a few books out that try to rationalise the science of Star Trek? They&#39;re not bad; it&#39;s fun to try and make logic out of fantasy. For instance, Vulcans and Romulans have green blood, right? Well, the book rationalises that since ou blood is red due to the iron oxidising, then Vulcans must have copper-based blood, since copper turns green when in contact with oxygen.<br><br>Of course, that completely kills the logic of an early TNG episode (can&#39;t remember the name) in which a Romulan&#39;s life can only be saved if Worf agrees to donate some bit of biology, because a body that depends on copper-based blood would probably have a hell of a lot more problems trying to work with something used to iron-based blood, but that&#39;s just babble.<br><br>I like Geordi&#39;s tech babble, though. And B&#39;Elanna&#39;s. The song sounds like fun - I look forward to it!<br><br>(And I, too, will now cease taking up so much space.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read one of those books- the title was &quot;Life Signs: The Biology Of Star Trek.&quot; I found it on my school library shelf and my inner nerd started turning somersaults of sheer glee. <br><br>Writers do have a tendency to slip up. For instance, they implied that Voyager&#39;s EMH could reproduce. The lines weren&#39;t integral to the plot in any way, but:<br><br>The Doctor has learned to experience emotion and is technically solid, thus enabling him to pursue the... attendant pursuits of some emotions, but how on earth could a hologram have gametes or other forms of viable genetic information? And even if they could, <i>why?</i> (On second thought... I don&#39;t particularly want the &quot;why&quot; bit answered.)<br><br>I&#39;ll email you the song. :)<br><br></p>

            <p>I read the biology one once, but before that I bought and devoured &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot;, which was somewhat more interesting.<br><br>The Doc... as a father. No. We saw what happened when he created a holographic family - that was enough. Then again, he&#39;s grown up since then.<br><br>If you want to be technical, though, he could use Lewis Zimmerman&#39;s DNA - provided Lewis lets him - as they are identical in appearance, at least.

            <p>Young man/lady/unidentified being, you have come to the right place, as you definitely appear to appreciate more dakka. The Division hereby issues you a bolter, optimized for use by unaugmented humans. The bolter is similar in concept to the weapon you specified with two main differences-its rounds are about twice the size you requested, and the bolter is capable of single shot, burst, and fully automatic firing modes.<br><br>In place of your request for incendiary grenades, the Division of More Dakka also issues you sufficient magazines of Inferno-pattern incendiary bolter shells.</p>

            <p>Ah 40K. I personally know little about it but the Imperial and Chaos ships look exceedingly pimptastic. There&#39;s just something about the concept of a Giant Flying Space Cathedral that I find alluring... Especially with guns.</p>

            <p>Yes, I&#39;m questioning the sanity of asking the PPC about shiny weapons, but hey, it&#39;s all good fun!<br><br>The dilemma is this: In one of my stories, certain, signature characters are represented by each having a weapon that&#39;s unique from the other. I have 17 different &#39;Weapons&#39; so far, I just need one more, and I&#39;m tapped out. Each of these people also represent a personality trait, and the person left WITHOUT a weapon has the trait of &#39;Charity&#39;. Now, what kind if weapon could she have?<br>The ones I&#39;ve used so far:<br><br>Sword (Courage)<br>Staff (Friendship)<br>Gloves (Love)<br>Symbols and Gestures (Power)<br>Book (Knowledge)<br>Martial Arts (Determination)<br>Bow and Arrows (Sincerity)<br>Guns (Kindness)<br>Shields (Hope)<br>Spiked Knuckle Dusters (Trust)<br>Wand (Faith)<br>Medallion (Justice)<br>Dagger (Independence)<br>Chains (Integrity)<br>Axe (Responsibility)<br>Boomerang (Virtue)<br><br>That&#39;s my list of weapons. I was thinking Nun-Chuks, but they really don&#39;t fit in with the above list, or the trait of Charity. I&#39;m just out of ideas when it comes to weapons... I&#39;m also staying away from weapons that are similar to one another, like Spears to Staffs, or Broadswords to Longswords.<br><br>So... Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Well, it really depends on how serious you are about classifying it as a weapon. I mean, Genis Sage (Tales of Symphonia) smacks things with a <i>kendama</i> for cryin&#39; out loud.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_melee_weapons">This</a> may help you, if you haven&#39;t found it already.<br><br>Might some sort of whip work? I&#39;m partial to the nagyka, myself, though apparently it&#39;s been perceived as a symbol of oppression. ^<em>^;; The tough part is finding something you&#39;ve not already used that vaguely suits charity.<br><br>Dynamite? ^</em>^;; I&#39;ve been on a bit of a Katekyo Hitman Reborn! kick recently, which might explain that addition. Is a trident too close to a spear/staff, I wonder?<br><br>Here&#39;s a thought - maybe the Charity person could convince the animals in the nearby area to fight for her?<br><br>!! Oh hey! Ahaha! What about a war fan of some sort? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_fan">Here&#39;s</a> the wikipedia article. <br><br>What else... Chakram(s), club... <br><br>&#39;nother brilliant idea: a sickle or a scythe, since those are traditionally associated with the harvest. Harvest = plenty = more than enough to share?<br><br>The last thought I have to offer you is that the staff (Friendship) is most often (at least in RPGs :P) given to the white mage, the one who heals the party even at the cost of his or her own life. Personally, I call that extreme charity. :D And Friendship could easily be symbolized by a twinned weapon - i.e. dual chakrams, maybe? See Axel (KH2) and Colette Brunel (Tales of Symphonia) for further reference - I didn&#39;t realize it before, but both of them did this whole self-sacrifice thing for their friends.<br><br>Well, that&#39;s that - I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve overloaded your brain, but you happened to ask about one of the topics I&#39;m quite passionate about. <br>I&#39;d be interested to see this story, if you&#39;re willing to share. : )</p>

            <p>When it comes to the whips, the Chains will be very similar in use. I&#39;m wanting a weapon, as opposed to calling nearby animals, because there&#39;s no always animals in the story, unfortunately. The War Fan is a good option though. I could use that.<br><br>Now, as for the Staff. The person using it takes the role of the Summoner, just think Final Fantasy. The role of the Healer falls to a mixture of whoever has the Gloves or the Book, and which is nearer.<br><br>And you might have fun with this story. The person actually recieving this weapon is Aerith, from Final Fantasy VII. The weapon also gives her power over metal, so this should be fun.<br>I did also consider Chakrams. They&#39;re on my list of potentials.<br><br>And thanks so much for this list. Makes it a lot easier to decide.<br><br>Oh, and I&#39;m always willing to give out the URL to my stories.

            <p>So far as I know, morning sickness generally ends after the second trimester or earlier, and can be cured with the moderate application of Guinness. Or so my sister found, anyway.

Water don&#39;t reach up that far and if it did cold water baths would be a problem too.<br><br>According to babycentre.co.uk (which looked professional enough to not declare urban legend as fact) hot baths can lower your blood presure.

Which means the sprog gets less oxygen and nutrition and that is bad for sprog&#39;s development.<br><br><s>Sprog&#39;s boiling temperature is likely the same as mother&#39;s internal organs.

            <p>You can have warm ones, and they might soothe your back pains. But really hot ones are out. My sister was complaining about such when I was visiting her a few weeks ago, and was having the hottest baths possible while she still could. The fact that she was unknowingly up the duff then and still is now suggests the hot baths won&#39;t automatically do away with the sprog.</p>

            <p>We alerted his service provider and they&#39;ve shut down his access. Apparently they caught him doing other illegal things as well. Disappointingly, they aren&#39;t legally allowed to tell us who he is or whether they&#39;ve contacted the cops, but apparently sending this kind of stuff is a federal offence so we&#39;re talking FBI here. Yay! (I shouldn&#39;t be so happy that I potentially sent someone to jail, but he was sending obscene death threats to twelve-year-old kids on ffnet, so I sincerely hope he suffers in every way that is possible within the extent of the law.) If he shows up again we can report him again, but I doubt he will.<br><br>Now that appears to be sorted, could I get in trouble if I wrote a PPC fic where my girls did something insanely unpleasant to someone very similar to this idiot?</p>

            <p>The section of the act that you should be pursuing in the US, if you charge over there, is section 223 of title 47 in the Communications Decency Act (amended). In particular, you&#39;re looking to charge the bastard/bitch under this subparagraph -<br><br>&quot;(a) Prohibited general purposes<br><br>Whoever-- (1) in interstate or foreign communications--<br><br>(C) makes a telephone call or utilizes a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communications;&quot;<br><br>(NB: subsection (h)(1)(C) of this act states(C) &quot;in the case of subparagraph (C) of subsection (a)(1), [telecommunications device] includes any device or software that can be used to originate telecommunications or other types of communications that are transmitted, in whole or in part, by the Internet (as such term is defined in section 1104 of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. 151 note)).&quot;)<br><br>In the UK, you&#39;re looking at the Malicious Communications Act 1988 (amended 2001), which states the following -<br><br>&quot;(1) Any person who sends to another person<br>(a) a letter, electronic communication or article of any description which conveys<br>(i) a message which is indecent or grossly offensive<br>(ii) a threat or<br>(iii) information which is false and known or believed to be false by the sender or<br>(b) any article or electronic communication which is, in whole or part, of an indecent or grossly offensive nature,<br>is guilty of an offence if his purpose, or one of his purposes, in sending it is that it should, so far as falling within paragraph (a) or (b) above, cause distress or anxiety to the recipient or to any other person to whom he intends that it or its contents or nature should be communicated.&quot;<br><br>(The relevant section is section 1, subsection a, paragraph ii.)<br><br>So there you go. If you need any other legal advice from a first year Law student who&#39;s not been admitted to the bar in his country yet and thus is in no way an expert on foreign legislation, don&#39;t hesitate to ask (on the plus side, it&#39;s free advice, heh).</p>

            <p>There are two different ways to attack this - cut his E-mail account, and cut his web access. The first is more likely, all you should need to do is forward one of the E-mails with an appropriate note added to abuse@ his E-mail provider. They should deal with it quickly.<br><br>The second is a bit trickier - you&#39;ll need to open up the MIME headers of his E-mail address. Included in the header is a server-by-server list of how the E-mail got from him to you, including all IP addresses involved. The first one on the list should be his. If it&#39;s something at yahoo.com or whatever, he&#39;s using a webmail client - go back to technique one.<br><br>Once you have his IP, it&#39;s relatively easy to reverse-DNS it (or whois) and work out at least generally where he is. Unfortunately, laws on cyberstalking vary wildly by state - some have very strict laws, some have no laws at all. You&#39;ll have to play that one by ear.</p>

            <p>Cyberstalking and that is covered under local law. If they&#39;re in America, they&#39;ll be punished under American law. If you have their IP Address, notifying their Internet Provider can help, and if you&#39;re serious, they can easily press charges against the person doing so.<br>And when it comes to the Neopets, inform them of the hijacking of your accounts and what&#39;s going on with your email. If you provide the neccesary details, then the Neopets team could probably track the person&#39;s IP address the next time they log on to your accounts and ban that IP address from Neopets.</p>
