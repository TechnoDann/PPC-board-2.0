            <p>Yay! So I&#39;m being recruited by Zoe, whose standing behind me, eating gummie bears, and telling me to talk about myself.<br><br>And she says hi.<br><br>So, okay. Well, lets start with my lovely Silmarillion obsession--gravitating very much towards the Feanorians. Annnnddd....I really don&#39;t know what else right now. 1) because my brain is dead, and 2) because dear Zoe is distracting me. So I&#39;m going to go away and let her ramble about everything she&#39;s rambling about. <br><br>The end.<br>Cheers!<br><br>Ariel</p>

Let everyone get to know you. Join in with discussions. During that time, check out some of the PPC stuff that&#39;s been written. A good place to look for stuff is the PPC Wiki, found here:<br><br><a href="http://ppcwiki.wikilot.com/wiki/Main_Page"><a href="http://ppcwiki.wikilot.com/wiki/Main_Page">http://ppcwiki.wikilot.com/wiki/Main_Page</a></a><br><br>Make sure to read the Original Series, and have a look at Huinesoron&#39;s work- the Reorganisation/ Crashing Down and the DOGA website, mainly. (He&#39;s the main chronicler of PPC history, as well as doing about a million and one other projects. Strange person he is, but we all love him to bits for it. Links on the wiki.)<br><br>Also during that time, think yourself up an Agent or two. If you&#39;re working with someone, then one Agent each might be a good idea. Think about what Department you might like to go into- is it just Mary Sues, or are there other things that bother you, like Bad Slash or Technical Errors?<br><br>Then, once your month or so is up, post on the Board asking for Permission. Include brief descriptions of your Agents and a sample of your writing so the Permission Givers can get a feel for your style. Then wait a bit. Within the next few days, you should get a reply from a Permission Giver. Once Permission is granted, write away!<br><br>Note: if anyone gives you links to something called C*l*br**n, That Series, Littlefoot x Cera or anything called Legendary Badfic, for the love of everything sacred, DO NOT CLICK THAT LINK. They are called Legendary Badfic for a reason. You can find summaries of them on the Wiki, but even those could melt your brain.<br><br>Lovely to have you. Welcome to the insanity.</p>

            <p>Yay! Shiny things are fun :D <br>Now, I think I&#39;m going to fail at writing such a nice, detailed reply, but...no...this will be rather short, sorry.<br><br>Thanks for the info and all:) Zoe introduced me to the PPC Wiki last night, and, of course, warned me of the badfic. Would you happen to have something I could stab my eyes out with? Or erase the time between 10:30 and 11:30 last night? It was painful. *twitch* I went to bed last night afraid of having creepy, perverted dreams. None, luckily. I dreamt of something to do with Maedhros, but I don&#39;t think it was anything...yeah. <br><br>Okay. The end. Thank you for the welcoming *salutes* :D</p>

            <p>And I&#39;m sure someone will traumatise you with something worse than whatever you saw last night... Assuming it wasn&#39;t one of the No-Drool videos *Shudders*<br><br>But, in the case you get even more tramuatised, there are the different brands of Bleeprin you can deal with. Bleepolate would be milder, while Bleepka is very potent. It should be up on the Wiki, so if you ever get that nagging headache and a mental picture of Snape dancing around in a g-string saying he&#39;s such a pretty girl, then head for the stronger stuff.</p>

            <p>Anyone interested in another go for Sunday?<br><br>For Saturday&#39;s, we finished off Brown Dragonrider of Pern and got through two of the playscripts. Neshomeh ended up voicing the SO for this, and Jai played Mortic. I&#39;m sorry, hS, but everyone else agreed she did a better Mortic than you. :P<br><br>We held off on Eye of Argon for Pigeon (who wasn&#39;t able to join in), so we still have that left over.<br><br>This one lasted about six hours before everyone left.</p>

            <p>Please hurt it like it hurts us, precious... Gah, it hurts. I think my biggest issue is the fact that the author establish Telmar as an actual city kingdom in that world. If they had even READ the books, they&#39;d know the &#39;Telmarines&#39; are from the Real-World Earth, and were originally villagers fleeing from pirates *Mutters*.<br><br>I&#39;m looking forward to your dealing with this one.

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking of transferring my agents to there.  They&#39;re actually rather well written. Not great, but decent. It&#39;s all a little... odd but this IS set in Nerima. Admitably, I&#39;m not familiar with Sailor Moon or Eva but Akane&#39;s Keyblade seems more like a crossover parody than anything else. </p>

            <p>But the fic itself just doesn&#39;t seem that atrocious to me, from purely a Ranma fandom viewpoint. I was reading through the first chapter quite happily before I got distracted by something else. So, while it is uncanonical and a bit Mary Sue-ish (not to mention totally random), I wouldn&#39;t call it horrible. Maybe Not-so-good!fic, but not bad!fic. That&#39;s just me though.</p>

            <p>A very famous troll, at that. As in, quite possibly the most famous troll in the HP fandom.

Most of the earlier reviews are actually funnier than the fic, if you look. I don&#39;t blame you for thinking it&#39;s genuine, though, it had me fooled for ages. :P</p>

            <p>A troll, in fanfiction, is written intentionally to show up the stupidity of the badfic out there. Unfortunately, most are as bad, if not worse, than the actual badfic.

            <p>I&#39;ve done the same thing. Ever heard of &quot;Harmony Hippogriff At Hogwarts?&quot; It was the first true hideous badfic I&#39;d seen, and at the time I was just totally enraged.

            <p>In Februari/March 2007 I started PPCing a fic that at that time was not yet finished. There are two Sues in that fic (one male, one female) and the canon characters barely make an apparence. And when they do they seem quite OOC. The mission has long since run a dead spot, &#39;cause there was no more story. I initially deemed it too early yet to kill the Sues &#39;cause despite being Sues and gross deformation of character of a diversity of military institutions (and not researching whether there is actually moon or sun light at 4am on 24 august) the number of crimes against canon are slim. Just that each of the canon characters did one thing they would never ever do, and it isn&#39;t specified whether the canons have age 20 years or the story is AU.<br><br>So, I&#39;m caught in a dilemma. I read what I had written so far again this weekend and it&#39;s one of the funniest missions I&#39;ve ever written and it be a shame to let those jokes go to waste (and there is only a very slim chance I will ever be able to use the one about the date and moon calander again). There&#39;s plenty of evidence and grounds to charge the Sues with being Sues, not doing research or even take grammar lessons, but there&#39;s hardly any canon breakage (unless you take real world military as part of canon (which you can considering the canon supposes it is part of the real world), &#39;cause then there is plenty of breakage). <br><br>Any thoughts on whether I should go ahead and charge the Sues, or just forget there ever was this mission? <s>Did I mention that one of my agents is quite psyched about encountering her first male Sue?</s></p>

            <p>Well, if the fic hasn&#39;t completely slammed the canons out of character, you could always just give them a warning. But if they make a bunch of other mistakes with grammar and common sense, then it&#39;s probably enough to kill them off towards the end of it. <br><br>You can either mention that there&#39;s no more story, but the Sues are ridiculously upstaging the canon characters enough to be sporked, or you can just kill them off with what&#39;s been given and pretend like it&#39;s some kind of screwed up ending(Example:&#39;Look, the Words stop because the author has failed. I think we should kill them before they run out.&#39;).</p>

            <p>I guess it&#39;s really up to you. It probably depends on how severely out of character the characters actually were. Something completely opposite of what they&#39;re character would do, and supposing there were a lot of them, would easily be enough to charge &#39;em I reckon.<br>I tihnk you can also charge them for making the Canon Characters disappear, if it was set in an important area to those characters, or at an important time. I.e.: Battle of Helm&#39;s Deep and Aragorn wasn&#39;t there, stuff like that. Then of course, there is the charge for just being a &#39;Sue. Maybe you could kill them, and claim you were &#39;nipping it in the bud&#39; before they could turn into full-blown &#39;Sues?</p>

            <p>I randomly found a link to the PPC portion of Miss Cam&#39;s website, through a Mary Sue Litmus Test website (I take them for fun; I suppose that says something about me). I think I ended spending all night reading Jay and Acacia&#39;s stories. Then, of course, I had to find all the other stories, too.</p>

            <p>Trojie and I are about to tackle &quot;Pathways&quot; (listed with linkage on the claimed badfic list). It&#39;s hideously wrong and Sueish, but we have the slight problem that Trojie doesn&#39;t know the canon at all, aside from the fact that there&#39;s a bearded bloke with dreads whose attractiveness we argue over on a regular basis, and my knowledge of the canon isn&#39;t exactly as detailed as it could be, as I&#39;ve only seen seasons 2 and 3 once, and 4 not at all. So, is there anyone out there who knows the SGA canon and would be willing to have a quick flick through the fic with me and do some detailed charge-spotting? It&#39;s not long and not graphic.</p>

            <p>Well I&#39;m currently writing up my masters thesis (Nutrient/Gene Interactions in Breast Cancer). The deadline for my first draft is Monday, and what happens? The dreaded Writers Block (and it fully deserves those capital letters!). I&#39;ve tried reading around the subject, I&#39;ve tried reviewing what I&#39;ve already written, I&#39;ve tried banging my head against the desk (getting some odd looks from the other people in the office), but not much is coming out. I&#39;m getting about 1000 words a day written, and what I want is more like 5000!<br>So what do other people do when this dread condition strikes you? Also has anyone else noticed that it only ever happens when you have a deadline?<br><br>To answer my own question I would usually write something else, but obviously that is not an option at the moment!<br><br>An increasingly crazy Crystal</p>

            <p>I turn away from the computer, stare around at my room for a bit, then look back at the screen and the cursed little blinky thingy. Then I get up and have a string cheese Because I Do.

Although, thing is, I haven&#39;t had a chance to be in your situation, &#39;cos the worst writer&#39;s block I got was for some random crap story for English class that wasn&#39;t even worth much anyway.

            <p>Uni essays, for example, tend to be a case of &quot;just write SOMETHING&quot; and, indeed, a deadline tends to motivate me, but depending on what class it&#39;s for, sometimes I have the entire thing done weeks in advance; if I enjoy the subject. (Amusingly, I wrote an essay for English a few weeks ago that I didn&#39;t like, only to have my tutor ask if they could have a copy to use as an example of an A quality essay!)<br><br>My current personal battle with Writer&#39;s Block isn&#39;t academic at all, though - I&#39;m stuck on a scene for my <i>Stardust</i> fanfic. I&#39;ve been stuck on this scene for about two months. If I could, I would go and work on a later scene - and I&#39;m sorely tempted to try anyway - but my usual writing style is a very steady flow from one scene to the next, and writing out of order can completely ruin that. So I avoid it, if I can.<br><br>And yes, there&#39;s a deadline for this, too - of sorts. It&#39;s self-imposed and Guilt (which also deserves its capital) is constantly tormenting me; when I first started writing, I updated every second week or so. Now it&#39;s been months. I don&#39;t ever want to be one of those authors who just fizzles out and is never heard from, but it&#39;s so HARD. *sniffle*<br><br>Sorry, I ramble. For you, Crystal, I think what the others have said before me will help as much as anything I can say; a good outline helps a great deal, and personally, if I don&#39;t know what to write I just start, randomly, anywhere, and write and write and let it start flowing. Usually I get to some sort of sensible result which can then be edited and reshaped into the outline.<br><br>Also, as you&#39;ve said, this is a draft. Don&#39;t panic too much; it&#39;s not your final version.</p>

            <p>...I found the best way to get past writers block was to write out first the rough outline of the thesis, i.e. all the chapter headings. Then under each chapter heading I wrote out the subheadings, so for my Geological Setting chapter I had subheadings &#39;Location of Field Area&#39;, &#39;Geological History&#39; &#39;Lithostratigaphy&#39; etc. Then under each subheading there may have been yet another set of subheadings, and then finally I wrote out bullet points of what needed to be said in each section. Then even if it wasn&#39;t in prose yet, I had down exactly what needed to be in each place. And often looking at the list of bullet points brought up some inspiration.</p>

            <p>I find that energy drinks are incredibly helpful when trying to write past a wall. (tea, sometimes, too.) I don&#39;t know why, but they do something to my mind-- especially Monster, with ginseng extract. You kind of have to force yourself to stay sitting and writing, though: then all the energy comes out that way. Given, it takes a bit of editing afterwards, but it&#39;s worth it.<br><br>Also, classical music can help, a lot. Or not necessarily classical, but something without lyrics; lyrical music is often way too easy to sing along with, and not write at all, which is... well, bad.<br><br>Good luck!</p>

            <p>But if you&#39;d like to take on a Tamora Pierce fanfic, there&#39;s at least one per page in the Pit.

The quickest sure-fire way to find a Sue in most well-known fandoms is to search the Pit with a keyword like Crystal, or Starfire, or Fate, or something like that.

            <p>Okay, so...it&#39;s been a whole month since I joined the Boards on Towel Day. And now I most humbly request permission from the higher deities of writing above me to write my own PPC characters/spinoff.<br><br>My first Agent is named Savitri Qazvin, age 25. She&#39;s not a very nice person, reverting to witty rudeness and bluntness rather than trying for subtlety in conversation. She doesn&#39;t exactly make &#39;friends&#39; with anyone, but she forms alliances with those she deems worthy, and then ends up being friends with them no matter how hard she tries. Savitri is also fiercely loyal to those people who manage to break her shell.<br><br>Savitri isn&#39;t a violent person, but she&#39;s a decently skilled fighter, having grown up mostly on her own, picking up whatever skills she could along the way. She tries to be logical and doesn&#39;t fight when it&#39;s not appropriate or profitable.<br><br>She&#39;s about 5&#39;9&#39;&#39;, with black hair streaked with white, blue eyes, and has a Celtic Knot tattoo on her abdomen. She likes to wear things that are decently form-hugging but ensure her freedom of movement in case she needs to move quickly. She also has a number of scars that she&#39;s rather self-conscious about and tries to hide most of the time. They are a reminder of her past, and that&#39;s not something she likes to dwell on.<br><br>For all her skill, though, Savitri is sometimes too ambitious and gets herself into difficult situations that are not easily remedied. Her pride often gets in the way of her seeing that she&#39;s been beaten, and she&#39;s afraid of failure. She has yet to learn that sometimes failure is a good thing. <br><br>She works in the Department of Improbable Crossovers.<br><br>Agent numero two is named Leo Bradley, age 31. Leo is much more subtle than Savitri, able to push people&#39;s buttons with an amount of practiced ease, just for the hell of it. He likes to learn everything he can about people, and all manners of social interaction fascinate him. As a result, he sometimes doesn&#39;t know when to draw the line, and he&#39;ll get smacked for his intrusion.<br><br>He&#39;s very optimistic about life in general, and sees the best in people. He doesn&#39;t always follow the &#39;logical choice&#39; in favor of the one that might potentially have a happier ending. Unless, of course, those people mess with his favorite characters and &#39;verses, in which case he immediately gets down to the business of eradicating them. Out in the real world, Leo was always irritated by cross-cultural contamination and the introduction of non-native species to any area that resulted in damage to the native lands. The same applies to fanfiction, and crossovers bother him more than he can say.<br><br>Leo is 6&#39;0&#39;&#39;, has medium length brown hair that almost always looks like he just rolled out of bed, no matter how often he combs it, and green eyes. He looks kind of stringy, like he&#39;s still going through a teenage growth spurt, the result of a high metabolism that makes him hungry just like a teenager most of the time, much to the annoyance of his partner.<br><br>He also works in the Department of Improbable Crossovers.<br><br>Aaaaaand here is my sample of writing from my brand new LJ account in URL since I&#39;m not quite sure how the codes work here just yet: <a href="http://sealrat.livejournal.com/819.html"><a href="http://sealrat.livejournal.com/819.html">http://sealrat.livejournal.com/819.html</a></a><br><br>Hoping you like it, much thanks.<br><br>Seal</p>

            <p><i>Agent Supernumerary looked Savitri and Leo up one way and down the other and raised an eyebrow. &quot;Did you two actually </i>polish<i> your CADs? And I thought my partner was bad. Oh well. Welcome to the DIC, newbies.&quot;</i><br><br>... Yeah, Permission granted. {= ) Just a couple of things to keep in mind, though: First, it&#39;s Implausible Crossovers. The Department of Improbabilities is something different.<br><br>Second, don&#39;t try too hard. A couple of places in your sample are a little wordy, like &quot;innumerable amounts of loving friends.&quot; Just &quot;innumerable loving friends&quot; would do, and it would save you from misusing the word &quot;amount&quot; with something that requires the word &quot;number.&quot; Remember, you measure amounts and count numbers.<br><br>Another example of wordiness is &quot;For much of my childhood, I saw this as inspiring as each year coincided by fireworks illuminating my passing age.&quot; I&#39;m actually not sure what you&#39;re going for here, but I&#39;ll make a guess: &quot;The celebration and fireworks coinciding with my birthday inspired me during much of my childhood.&quot; Sometimes, &quot;poetic&quot; language has to be abandoned in favor of language that gets the point across.<br><br>Anyway, I second the cheer for more people working crossovers. We are writing for a terribly under-represented department. Are there any particular continua you&#39;re interested in?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I&#39;ll make sure my friend (who has graciously volunteered to beta) will keep an eye out for that.<br><br>For continua...probably Percy Jackson (I saw some freaking scary ones there), maybe some Harry Potter, Torchwood, Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis, and the Bourne fandoms.

            <p>Nume and Ilraen have a pretty broad range, Nume being what he is, but it seems the only one we have in common is Harry Potter. I know a little of SG-1, but it never impressed me like the original movie did, so I didn&#39;t get into it. Also, I was (well, am) a little bitter over Farscape&#39;s cancellation, and the fact that SG-1 took its time slot didn&#39;t help. Even when Ben Browder and Claudia Black joined the cast, I just kept thinking, &quot;So, this is a &#39;Crichton&#39;s Head&#39; episode, right? He&#39;s going to wake up soon and everyone will be back on Moya, right?&quot; ^<em>^;<br><br>My other great love is Pern. I quit role-playing on message boards a couple of years ago due to time constraints, and for the most part it&#39;s been a good decision, but I&#39;d go back to Pern in a heartbeat if I could.<br><br>... If I ever see a Farscape/Pern crossover, I think I will die. It will either be so awesome or so awful as to kill me.<br><br>Middle-earth is up there, too, but it&#39;s more of a worship situation. I can&#39;t bring myself to touch it at all, not to role-play, nor to write fanfic, nor to PPC.<br><br>There are several other fandoms I watch, including Harry Potter, Young Wizards, Phantom of the Opera (Leroux, Kay, and Webber), and Jekyll &amp; Hyde (book and musical). Nume is a Trekkie, but I&#39;m only a casual viewer, so that means he doesn&#39;t get to visit his favorite canon as much as he&#39;d like. And I&#39;m afraid to look in the Animorphs section for Ilraen. ^</em>^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Um, I&#39;m not sure if I got my agent approved yet. Just in case, here she is.<br><br>Name: Eni Andrews<br>Age: 15-ish<br>Department: Video games, particularly the Dynasty/Samurai/Orochi Warriors series.<br>Physical description: Eni&#39;s about 5&#39;10&quot;, with short brown hair that she dyed purple. She has hazel eyes. She wears a lot of bracelets and rings, and she likes girly clothes but rarely wears them.<br>Personality: She&#39;s rather shy, and doesn&#39;t get on well with other people. She joined the PPC a fair deal of time ago, and totally forgot about it until she was forcibly re-recruited. She&#39;s very self-conscious and insecure whenever she has to actually communicate. Eni is rarely seen without her precious books (namely a  heavily highlighted and slightly tattered copy of Sun Tzu&#39;s <u> The Art of War </u>, which she reads for stress relief.)<br>Writing samples are on my (rarely used) LJ <a href="http://violet-secret.livejournal.com/"><a href="http://violet-secret.livejournal.com/">http://violet-secret.livejournal.com/</a></a>.<br><br></p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay.<br><br>Best line: <i>We had had an oath, signed in chocolate and dreams ...</i>.<br><br>Most confusing line: <i>For it was said, done, written, and made to be that way; the last one walks with just memories of a life once led and dreams of a life that will be, and, as ominous music plays, a villain sheds chains and a hero fades to dust, for so it was.</i><br><br>Advice: Pretty much the same thing I told SealRat--don&#39;t overdo it. Also, if your agent is closely based on yourself, be careful not to get sucked into simply reacting to badfics, because you&#39;ll miss half the humor that way. I know this because I noticed myself doing the same thing recently. I have to make at least two passes at writing a mission: first to react, then to spork.<br><br>Prognosis: Nothing that writing a few PPC fics won&#39;t improve. So have at it!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>How far does a canon have to be OOC before it counts as a totally different character?<br><br>I&#39;m currently killing a Silmarillion Suefic in which a very unElven Sue goes after Maglor Fëanorion.  In it, Maglor says such phrases as &quot;<i>They’re these three jewels that contain the light of the Two Trees or something like that. I don’t really care about them— I mean, they’re okay and all, but they’re just jewels...</i>&quot;, <i>&quot;...Celegorm’s dog Huan keeps drinking out of the loo and it’s really annoying. That dog drives me nuts...&quot;</i>, and, my favorite, <i>&quot;Sheesh, dude, calm down.&quot;</i><br><br>He also has a somewhat... unMaglory description: <i>This guy was absolutely gorgeous. He had pale skin, fine, elegant features, and brilliant amber eyes that seemed to glow in the dim forest light. Oh, and he had amazing hair. I’d thought at first that it was plain dark brown, but on closer look it had some reddish highlights and nearly reached his waist. All in all, he was WAY hot.</i><br><br>He doesn&#39;t talk like the Eldar, he doesn&#39;t look like a Noldo, and he doesn&#39;t act like a Fëanorian- and the rest of his family&#39;s not much better.  The way the Silm&#39;s written, though, characters are very open to interpretation.  It never says he doesn&#39;t have amber eyes, and it never says his father doesn&#39;t look down on him, and it never says he doesn&#39;t use phrases like &quot;Peace out&quot;.  Still, judging by what we do know of him and his family, all these things are highly unlikely.  How far does it go before I call character replacement and dispose of him, or will an exorcism/killing the Sue cover it?  (I&#39;d be recruiting if it&#39;s not the real Maglor, as I&#39;m already taking his horse.)</p>

Lots of dialogue, and even the first two paragraphs of the fic are entirely Pratchett.<br><br>The link, for those interested: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4106592/1/Wherefore_Ducks_And_Other_Stories"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4106592/1/Wherefore_Ducks_And_Other_Stories">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4106592/1/Wherefore_Ducks_And_Other_Stories</a></a></p>

            <p>I wish to request the attention of the Permission Givers.<br><br>I am requesting that my two Agents be given PPC status and allowed to start patrolling the continuums.<br><br>First Agent:<br><br>Luana Starlight<br>  She is 24-years-old, with dark blond hair and gray eyes.  She is a 5&#39;10&quot;.  She is slightly more responsible and a little less insane than her partner.  The writer of the pair, she tends to get frustrated when something isn&#39;t easy to read.  She enjoys reading well-written fanfiction and can&#39;t stand it when other people write Mary Sues or self-inserts that make no sense in the course of Canon.  She does not mind reading AUs, except when they are badly written.<br>  Because of her lifestyle, she enjoys different types of genres.  This can include anything from Lord of the Rings to Star Wars to Monty Python.  She has also already adopted a Mini-Balrog, Haildar, who is currently living in the family oven (don&#39;t ask).<br><br>Second Agent:<br><br>Orange Plaid<br>  She is the younger sister to Luana Starlight.  She is 20-years-old also with dark blond hair.  She has blue eyes and is about 5&#39;8&quot;.  With a tendency to slack off when it comes to certain things, she is also the insane one of the pair.  She also enjoys reading fanfiction with a tendency to stick to oldies but goodies.  Loves to complain, loudly, about certain writers and their stories.  With certain movies, she loves to MST them while watching, to the enjoyment of her sister/partner and their father, but to the annoyance of their other two sisters and mother.<br><br>They wish to join the Department of Floaters.  They do not have any particular Canon they wish to join so they feel this would be the best place for them.<br><br>Here is a couple of samples of writing:<br><br>This one was written as a POV fic for a class.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1860044/1/Gimlis_Story_after_Moria"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1860044/1/Gimlis_Story_after_Moria">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1860044/1/Gimlis_Story_after_Moria</a></a><br><br>Here is my account on ff.net.

            <p>It won&#39;t be cheesy for the agent in question, whose bad news will be real and not simply designed as an excuse for angst and healing-whatever. (If it IS designed that way, best re-think it!) In any case, there&#39;s nothing wrong with comforting someone who&#39;s hurt as long as it&#39;s appropriate--healing sex, for example, is almost never appropriate. Since the circumstances will be different from those of the fic, the agent with the news should be able to separate the two enough to accept the help, even if comparing it to the fic is inevitable. For best effect, actual flashbacks ought to be reserved for the truly horrific.<br><br>Feel free to ask about the specifics of what you want to do, too. I mean, don&#39;t say who the agents are or exactly what the bad news is if you want to avoid spoilers, but the details of the fic and of what you&#39;d like to have happen between the agents might help us give you better advice.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who can&#39;t ask questions about her missions without spoilers, since she only has one team plus Jenni.</p>

            <p>Whatever works for the pair is probably fine. Even if there are flashback problems, hopefully they can work through those, too. It would be a bad sign for the future marriage if they couldn&#39;t comfort one another!<br><br>... Since I seem to be channeling Jenni anyway, your agents are welcome to talk to her if they want to.

            <p>The book is Skulduggery Pleasant. It&#39;s actually quite good and I don&#39;t mind the Sue too much, it just startled me that the author would do that after he developed some pretty amazing characters.

            <p>I agree Daine has some Sueish traits, but the biggest Sue from the TP universes has to be Aly. I read the Trickster set for the first time a few years ago, thinking the whole time about what a Sue she is.<br>Oh, and plotting to spork her a few times too, but that was pre-PPC for me.</p>

            <p>Alanna may be the one with violet eyes and a telepathic cat, but at least she generally has to work for everything and has her  moments of humiliation.

            <p>Possibly because I&#39;m so fond of Tortall-verse magic, four whole books without one of the things I liked best were hard. Then again, I appear to have very little judgement on this kind of thing. I&#39;ll nose out of the discussion, but that&#39;s my two cents.

            <p>Kel is the best. Alanna might be my favorite just because she introduced me to Tamora Pierce. And Aly definitely has some pretty strong Sue traits. Oddly enough, she never bugged me the way Daine did. I mean, daughter of two gods (granted her mom wasn&#39;t one in the beginning) as well as being the most powerful Wildmage. It was the backstory angst that really drove me nuts.<br>I love Neal. I think the Kel series was probably the most awesome. </p>

            <p>Well, I dunno, but everything about Aly bugged me. I mean, beautiful, excellent hand-to-hand combatant, speaks with Gods, you name it, she can pretty much do it. I mean, sure, with her parents being the Lioness and George, maybe, but she shouldn&#39;t inherit all of her parent&#39;s particular gifts.She didn&#39;t have The Gift though, which is a mixed blessing.<br>I liked Daine, actually. I suppose I sorta forgave her &#39;Sue tendancies when TP made the interaction with animals interesting.

            <p>You definitely have valid points about Aly.<br>I think it wasn&#39;t so much the magical aspect of Daine that bugged me (the animals were awesome after all), but the angst in her past. There was something about it that didn&#39;t, for me anyway, ring true.

            <p>No one here has the ability to PPC is -- or, more precisely, the permission. There&#39;s actually a ban on PPCing fanfic based on religious texts (which is why there&#39;s only one such mission report).

            <p>Alright, I know I&#39;ve laid this out before, But I wanted to get some fresh insight into what could be done with my Discworld -Witches/Sisneys Filmore crossover.<br><br>To start off, I&#39;m concernd whether the idea of using child forms of Esme and Gytha to represent wards of the state is even plausible.  <br><br>Would the child Esme, hailing from a small town in eastern Pennsylvanian/the W.V. northern panhandle be able to capture the characters conflicted nature of being born to be the bad witch but needing to be the good one?  Perhaps as something of a stubborn mule, sometimes engaging in quasi-bullying by simply staring people into submission... but only really using it on true bullies, those who inflict harm on the weak.  I&#39;ve decided to give her adequate education for her grade level, but having her literacy be mostly functional, not recreational.  <br><br>The circumstance of her wardship is the aftermath of a domestic dispute turned fatal (father came home drunk after getting layed off from one of the towns last industries, began venting his frustrations on everything in sight, including his wife. Mrs. Weatherwax swung a household implement at his head, hoping to knock him out, but caught his temple with a sharp bit and is now servuing 3 to 10 for manslaughter).<br><br>Gytha, on the other hand, is from a mountain farming community on the Missouri Ozark plateau.  They were people who beleived in some strange things:  they saw charismatic preachers mostly as entertainment, evangelicals as busy-bodies and believed in a school of medicine not so different from Daisy May Moses:  Native plants, a bit of superstiton and a big ol&#39; dollop of moonshine.  Of course, since a still can explode or the brew render you blind if laced with methanol, Gytha&#39;s Maternal grandmother (local midwife, family matriarch and ruler-by-default of the female community in a 10 mile radius) was instrumental in introduing the use of the young shoots of the fibre-hemp crop as a substitute.  That however, leads to the circumstances of her wardship:  the DEA busted the entire community less than 6 months before the fic begins on having a &quot;marijuana&quot; crop worth a street value of over 25 million dollars.  Gythas&#39; mother actually fainted when she heard the amount on the news... because, hey, if the knew they could sell it for that much, would they be killing and butchering their own hogs?<br><br>Gytha is.. well, one could say &quot;life incarnate&quot;, hopefully drawing parrallels to her pratchett inspiration.  She&#39;s helpful, especially to people who&#39;ve been kicked under the wheels of life.  She also has an uncertain record in terms of teenage relationships.  She&#39;s been known to humour advances from males of her own age (or closely above), but certainly lets them know when they&#39;ve reached the limit.  I&#39;ll leave that ambiguous.  <br><br>She was also apprenticing under her mother to be a midwife, so her knowledge of how to help women and girls in relationship-trouble (upto and including threatening the student-council president with a steel baseball bat on the subject of paying for an embryo-termination for his girlfriend) should be her stong point to counterbalance her dearth of formal education.<br><br>And that&#39;s before they find the scumble still in the undergrowth.<br><br>I just wanted to know whether the characterizations were close enough or whether I should make these into OC&#39;s.<br><br>In fact, is any of this realistic?  Is X Middle school able to handle these wards, or are they here because of an excellent record on delinquent rehabilitation?     </p>

            <p>*Ahem* Whee, I haven&#39;t done this for a while. In fact I haven&#39;t been on a computer for most of last week, thus, let alone on the Board. Right, here goes:<br><br>1) (out of necessity) I have a very canon-purist friend (let&#39;s call him Bulgaria) who I would like to shove onto the Board, the only problem is... he only speaks one language and it&#39;s Spanish. So I was thinking... would any multilingual Boarders be willing to help me translate, oh, for example something like what the WikiMaster&#39;s been writing into any languages they can, to get the word out? (FYI, PPC in Spanish is Protectores de las Continuidades De Trama, or la Continuidad de Trama, I think - depends on if you&#39;re going literal (Plot <i>Continuum</i>) or figurative-ish (Plot <i>Continuui</i>). Now you know that!)<br><br>2) (Out of curiosity and weirdness) Okay. So there are people who have lust objects from other people&#39;s work, but are there any authors who fan-person characters they happen to have made up? If so, would it be regarded as weird? *holds out mind-bank* Put in your two cents! <br><br>C, -0.00000000(repeat to infinity+13)0000000002% inquisitiveness.</p>

            <p>I kinda-sorta fanperson some of mine, but not in a Lust Object way.<br>About the closest I came to that was with an RP character of mine, after the GM had put him through hell again and again and again with no real pauses. Since I was focusing on keeping him IC with the personality I&#39;d given him, I started feeling protective. The &#39;wrap them in a blanket and hide them from more suffering&#39; feeling I tend to get when a fictional character I have some sort of empathy for suffers; and I sort of needed to understand what he&#39;d be feeling/thinking in order to play him right.<br>However, I never actually took him out of the game or any other means of stopping it all. I kept playing him, after taking a short break IRL to get my perspective back.</p>

            <p>The GM did. He wasn&#39;t going to be a woobie. He was going to be happy, bit of a drinker, slightly sarcastic but overall a nice guy.<br><br>So I get my Imperial Knight all set up to be a cheerful, fun-loving guy, I give him some fun quips in the first few posts...then the GM *deep breath*: kills off my Knight&#39;s mentor/friend(in a Force-merge with him so he senses the guy&#39;s death as well as sees it), has him witness the invasion of his home planet and an attack on the temple he lives in, sends him on a mission he&#39;s morally opposed to, kills off his mission partner in a way that my Knight thinks he could have saved him if he&#39;d been faster, messes with the mission so that my Knight is left with a child whose mother has been taken away and whose utter despair he just saw before the ship took off, then had him try to get her back and find she was on a world that&#39;s priming an invasion fleet. All of this with no real pauses in between for him to deal with it.<br><br>So yeah. The hyped happy Knight can&#39;t live up to that anymore. Happycat has run out of happy.<br><br>And since, as his player, I know his personality/emotions...well, when you read fiction and get to know a character well, their emotions have an impact on you. It was rather like that. In order to keep him IC as the decent guy he was, he had to suffer when those things happened. I tried not to let it affect me, I took breaks IRL every so often to keep myself in perspective...but I really couldn&#39;t help but feel sorry for my character.</p>

            <p>I create characters I squee over, but lusting after them ... I can&#39;t imagine doing so. (&#39;Tis partly why I didn&#39;t want to get involved in the agentslash fad with my own two - pairing a character I publicly admit is my avatar with another character I created just creeps me out a tad. That and I noticed some eerie similarities between my agents and a couple in a webcomic I read, which I hadn&#39;t started reading when I made them, so I didn&#39;t want to make them any more similar to this webcomic couple by making *them* a couple ... that made better sense in my head.)</p>

            <p>Admittedly, the one character I do sorta squee over was mostly based on a friend I have a crush on. Only the character&#39;s a god. But that might explain it...

            <p>As to the first, I&#39;d say it&#39;d be a lot of work and very difficult for both parties. If any Boarders speak Spanish you could ask them to write their posts twice (as in, one under the other) but to translate what&#39;s already there would be complex and time consuming. You could certainly try, but I think you, Ciri, would have to do a lot of it. <br><br>Perhaps you and your friend could go online together and you could read it aloud to him, and type in English for him?<br><br>Also, it could be very hard to translate the excessive word jokes. I&#39;m not trying to be a pessimist, but I think it would be very hard.<br><br><br>As to the second... Yeah, weird. Not bad, but weird. At least to me.<br></p>
