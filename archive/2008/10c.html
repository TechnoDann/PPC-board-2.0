            <p>In April 2003, a young woman named Kaitlyn joined the PPC Board. She&#39;s been here ever since, mostly lurking in the background.<br><br>In September of that same year, a young man named Huinesoron arrived on the Board, and for some reason rapidly became rather prominent. Even before that, Kaitlyn had noticed him...<br><br>Later on (quite a while later) their respective Agents, Constance Sims and Dafydd Illian met up in HQ, and began a rather, well, scary relationship. This was mirrored by...<br><br>You know what?

            <p>A properly sharp katana will go through an unarmored limb relatively easy. So will most similar swords - a cavalry saber, for example. A machete will provide similar results, but requires more effort. More classical medieval swords were designed for armor piercing, thus they have blunter edges and won&#39;t penetrate flesh as easily.

            <p>All of these seem fairly interesting. Glitter decrease/withdrawal could be tied into the same experiment though. Now, I may be out of the loop here since I was last at the PPC in something like 2005, but I&#39;d think it&#39;d be interesting to see an experiment on what kind of conditions Sues can comfortably exist in, the strength of their immune system (gradually introducing them to more serious diseases to see how long it is until they recover, maybe?), maybe testing if they recover from injuries at a faster rate than normal people? Dissecting Sues and trying to get genetic samples to see how biologically/genetically similar to actual humans they are would definitely be something to check out, but I get the feeling you don&#39;t want to do that right away.</p>

            <p>First it could start out as just research to find out more about how Sues work/how to kill them more easily/how close to &quot;human&quot; they are (since they&#39;re humanOID, but obviously not human), and the like, and then go on to that eventually? Sounds interesting, if a *really* long-term project. And no problem, glad you like the idea.</p>

            <p>What about the Sue Factories? If there are any still around, especially considering they&#39;re hostile to the PPC, we could actually take one over and use it to create/breed Sues specifically for the experiments. That way we wouldn&#39;t have to worry about where the test subjects are coming from, the Factories get karma for the &#39;08 invasion in the form of a military attack, and assassins don&#39;t start asking questions about why they&#39;re suddenly taking Sues alive.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right. Of course, before that happens I&#39;m focusing on getting permission to have agents and do missions (I wonder, does the fact that I&#39;ve technically been here before negate the &quot;be here for a month&quot; requirement?). :P But yeah, a full scale military-style assault on a Factory would need more than, no offense, a few scientists. And probably permission due to the huge size of the assault and plot-changing nature of it.</p>

            <p>Realistically, it&#39;d take the PPC quite a while to even FIND another one of the League&#39;s Sue factories, I think, let alone to mobilize for a full on attack. We&#39;re assassins, not soldiers, after all. And at the moment those experiments are just mere ideas in the back of some lab techs&#39; heads, it&#39;d be a while down the road, especially since they&#39;ve already got other labs to do.</p>

            <p>That still means most agents don&#39;t know where they are. They could be anywhere in the multiverse, after all, though her telling the Flowers about that one could be a good hook assuming the people running that factory haven&#39;t picked up and moved it somewhere else by now.</p>

            <p>(and I apologise profusely for that remark, but the Board&#39;s so wide now that I can&#39;t see a thing further down) if you&#39;re planning an assault on a Mary-Sue Factory, I think you should hold off for a while, like you&#39;re planning. We&#39;ve already had several crises this year- the Double Whammy Invasion of Macroviruses and Mary Sues, a Canon Crisis back in July/August with the Robecca Exorcism, and the Ypur Invasion- and we could do with a break and some nice, regular missions.<br><br>Once everyone&#39;s rested, though, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be ready to take on a Sue Factory- for revenge, if nothing else. We lost over a thousand agents to the viruses and Sues. You have my Agents standing by for whenever the assault begins.<br><br>Oh, and in reply to the remark about the Agents not being soldiers... most of them may not have any formal training, but as they demonstrated in the invasion, they can fight as well as most regular armies, and probably better than some. In addition, they have access to all kinds of weapons and defence systems that are far beyond what World One can provide.</p>

            <p>OVER ONE THOUSAND AGENTS?! Holy shit! O_o Yeah though, I didn&#39;t intend on starting anything about an assault on a factory for quite a while, both to let the PPC recover and for me to get experience and stuff, though I could lead up to the idea in implications and stuff. It&#39;d be a real hard thing to pull off. Glad to hear you&#39;re interested though.<br><br>As for the Agents thing, I didn&#39;t SEE the invasion, so I don&#39;t know how well everyone fought. Still, you have a good point, but we&#39;re still not exactly an army, and a lot of our agents aren&#39;t that used to working as such a huge force, though some of the better ones could be considered pretty much special forces soldiers. And there IS the sheer combat experience and the fact that we&#39;ve got weapons and technology from all the multiverse at our disposal. And sheer numbers, heh.</p>

            <p>The problem would be, if a Factory ever was located and assaulted, in the planning. A spontaneous defence of HQ is one thing. A planned, premeditated attack on a possibly well-defended location is a completely different kettle of fish. <br><br>Leaders would have to be selected, plans would have to be made and Agents might need to be reminded of the value of working with people other than their regular partners.<br><br>There&#39;s also the fact that the Factories might actually be prepared for all out ground assaults. It might be necessary to locate Agents with training in aerial combat vehicles, whether World One or canon. I&#39;d imagine that very few Mary Sues would be able to stand up to a <i>Macross</i>-verse Valkyrie or a <i>Gundam</i>-verse Mobile Suit (from any of the multiple continuities). Hell, even an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-10_Thunderbolt">A-10 Thunderbolt</a> could do the trick.<br><br>It seems like a lot of planning, and not something that just one person should take on. Hell, just the planning alone is probably above most Agents capabilities. <s>Maybe kidnapping a character replacement of a tactical forecaster such as Sumeragi Li Noriega might be useful.</s><br><br>All that aside, my Agents would be perfectly willing to go out there and join in with an assault if it ever happened.</p>

            <p>It&#39;d definitely be difficult; as you said, it&#39;d take a really long time of preparation and a lot of information on the headquarters, which would probably have defenses on it to make a full on ground attack as difficult as possible. Presumably the PPC&#39;s been weakened at least a bit by the last attack too, and considering we&#39;d lose a LOT of good men and women on such an assault it&#39;d be a good reason to want to hold back on it. As for who was in charge I was assuming a Flower would be in command of the overall operation, if not on the battlefield personally.<br><br>I&#39;d actually be surprised if the factory WASN&#39;T prepared/heavily defended. If there were a way to portal directly into the factory we could bypass the majority of defenses, but I can still see where vehicles could be needed. Especially since the Sues will have the advantage, being on the defensive and literally being able to MAKE their own reenforcements whereas we&#39;d have to portal them in. It&#39;d be a bloodbath no matter who won. In story we could say the Flowers were discussing a plan or something, but we&#39;d still need to actually make said plan up. <br><br>Could be an excuse for why it takes so long for the attack to happen; even if we were ready (and we&#39;re not at the moment), we&#39;re still planning and trying to mobilize and figure out how to get it to work. No point in a suicide attack after all. Maybe send in some agents to locate the factory and do some basic recon? And once the actual attack comes a diversionary assault would come in handy, if just long enough for strike teams to get through and take out vital targets that allow the rest of the attack to go more smoothly.</p>

            <p>Heh, already put it in a word doc, so no need. Honestly my only real worries about the permission thing are the technicalities with the rules and the fact that I have some issues with some of my ideas, more writer&#39;s block than anything, so it&#39;d actually be a good way to fine-tune the concepts I have. Can&#39;t be as easy as it looks though. Anyway, all I was saying is I want to get that out of the way first, especially since &quot;massive PPC assault on a heavily-defended Sue factory&quot; isn&#39;t something I wanna do until I&#39;ve gotten my feet wet. :P</p>

            <p>Reposting this from the other place:<br>&quot;<br><br>Hi all, I didn&#39;t exactly get to introduce myself on the other place, well not properly anyway what with the &quot;Does anyone except that spambot post here?&quot; and the &quot;No, but we&#39;ve moved here temporarily&quot; and the &quot;Hey, you&#39;re that guy from (fill in the blank)!&quot;, heh. So, yeah, I&#39;m Kyle. I actually joined this before years ago, but I eventually lost interest, especially since the place was all but dead at the time and technically I&#39;d never gotten permission to do anything PPC-like. <br><br>I&#39;ll go for the making agents and getting permission some other time, since at the moment I&#39;m dealing with some writer&#39;s block, but I just thought I&#39;d introduce myself proper-like and show that I wasn&#39;t some random guy who popped in out of morbid curiosity about if it was dead or not. Oh, also, does anyone know how I can get in contact with the people in charge of the movie? I&#39;ve been meaning to look to see if there were any open roles for voice actors left, as it seemed fairly interesting, but I kinda...lost their emails, haha. Help would be appreciated on this, thank you for your time.&quot;<br><br> Also, I was told to check the &quot;Ypur Invasion&quot; article on the wiki to understand what&#39;s going on, but there is no such article. I saw the RP, read some of it, but assumed it was a joke and not a serious thing like the Sue invasion was. This is another thing that I would like information on, if that is a reasonable request.</p>

            <p>I know this is rather late, but I have to take whatever internet access I can get at the moment. So, yes. Welcomes. Here, have a bag of pebbles and a Random Shiny Object.<br><br>As for the Movie- I happen to be one of the co-ordinators, so I guess I&#39;d be someone to talk to about it- yes, there are open roles available, unless they&#39;ve been filled while I was away. I get the impression that you&#39;re of the male persuasion, so we have Redd, Sparky and Denny for you to take a bash at, if you&#39;d like to. The deadline is tomorrow, but you are a very, very latecomer, so I expect we could make an exception if our sound tech can make do without those lines for a short while longer.<br><br>Many thanks, and welcome again.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the welcomes. I actually talked to Trolljie about this yesterday, and she assigned me those roles. She said she&#39;d be sending me the scripts (one tailored to show which parts I have to do, and the other is the whole thing) either then or today. I&#39;ll do them as soon as I can, and hope I can perform in a satisfactory manner.</p>

            <p>Fair point, but I more meant like in that unlike some other events it seemed more deliberately humourous, maybe parodic. Pretty much everything in the PPC has at least some level of humour to it, but I more meant that I thought the Ypur thing wasn&#39;t supposed to be taken as a real thing, just some random fun or something.

Considering they made the deadline halloween, I assume it&#39;s too late to get in on the movie anyway, so ah well.

            <p>Hi all, I didn&#39;t exactly get to introduce myself on the other place, well not properly anyway what with the &quot;Does anyone except that spambot post here?&quot; and the &quot;No, but we&#39;ve moved here temporarily&quot; and the &quot;Hey, you&#39;re that guy from (fill in the blank)!&quot;, heh. So, yeah, I&#39;m Kyle. I actually joined this before years ago, but I eventually lost interest, especially since the place was all but dead at the time and technically I&#39;d never gotten permission to do anything PPC-like. <br><br>  I&#39;ll go for the making agents and getting permission some other time, since at the moment I&#39;m dealing with some writer&#39;s block, but I just thought I&#39;d introduce myself proper-like and show that I wasn&#39;t some random guy who popped in out of morbid curiosity about if it was dead or not. Oh, also, does anyone know how I can get in contact with the people in charge of the movie? I&#39;ve been meaning to look to see if there were any open roles for voice actors left, as it seemed fairly interesting, but I kinda...lost their emails, haha. Help would be appreciated on this, thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>Yeah, you know what I mean. (I hope?) <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> is upon us once again! (Cue the dramatic music?) For everyone who hasn&#39;t been bitten yet, National Novel Writing Month is where everyone with a pen and paper, or a laptop, and a basic <s>masochistic</s> need to write-- but not just write. No, that would be too mundane for us. NaNo is when you take the month of November (thirty days, by the way) and try to write 50,000 words in it, a novel in the genre of your choice.<br><br>Now, this might sound crazy to some. <br><br>But this is the PPC! I&#39;ll admit that when I saw the topic &quot;Artic&#39;s Game of the Month,&quot; my first thought was &quot;Poke, prod, taunt, and generally bother NaNo participants until they completely lose it?&quot; <br><br>What&#39;re y&#39;all doing for NaNo? What are your strategies this year? (Especially for shutting off the Inner Editor; do I err in guessing that the average Agent&#39;s biggest problem is ignoring said voice?) Have you ever won? And so on, and so forth.<br><br>(I&#39;m taking two and a half characters I love and throwing them into a semi-Steampunk universe along the lines of Thirty Years War status, but... with the whole world involved. I figure this will give me a lot more opportunity to actually <i>win</i>, because both times I tried to write a set out, planned plot, I ran out of words and ideas too quickly. This time, I&#39;ve only given myself exceedingly vague plot guidelines, in hopes that I&#39;ll be able to actually finish the damned line this year. &gt;_&gt;)</p>

            <p>Which is why I&#39;m leaning towards third person now, but from the viewpoint of this one character. Or maybe I&#39;ll switch between characters. I dunno. The story has changed it&#39;s purpose a lot in the last 24 hours. <br><br>Thirty days it is. See you at the finish line.</p>

            <p>Redheads don&#39;t tend to be popular with Mary-Sues either. Just look at Ron and Ginny Weasley.

            <p>A lot of Mary Sues like that color. After all, the genes that cause red hair are perhaps the most recessive of all other hair-color genes. For &#39;Sues that seems to be the opposite. Many are blondes or redheads, with an occasional Goth/Emo black-haired Sue. <br><br><br><s>But it might work...Lori is a redhead, according to my Permission post on LJ.

            <p>Abarai Renji and Kurosaki Ichigo from <i>Bleach</i> seem to both be rather affected by Sues.

            <p>Maybe they could do studies on the addictive properties of Glitter. And I&#39;m sure FicPsych has records about ex-Sues, who have had to recover without the aid of fancy drugs or machines. How did they do it? Is it that they&#39;ve de-Glittered themselves, or that they&#39;ve just built up a tolerance for it through sheer force of will? Is Glitter something produced in the bodies of Sues, or do they channel it into themselves from outside sources, like Dust?<br><br>So many questions.

            <p>I mean, Exorcisers can remove a Possession!Sue wraith from a Canon Character&#39;s Body through exorcism, so they&#39;re essentially seperating the glitter from the flesh and blood. And all Agents can Exorcise, just look at the Alumia and Robecca exorcisms.</p>

            <p>I have to say I really like this idea and its execution. I don&#39;t know if I said that clearly before.<br><br>However, as a PPCer and an English major and an editor-in-training--that is, as someone specifically trained to spot plotholes and other inconsistencies--I have to point out a few issues I find in your experiment. First of all, the classifications could be punched up a little bit. Pseudolatin is the done thing, of course, but the closer you get to the genuine article, the better. For example, <i>Humanis perfectis</i> should probably be <i>Homo perfectis</i>. Also, for weird classifications, you could follow the example of plant classification and use modifiers like &quot;var.&quot; for &quot;variant&quot; (<i>Puella moderna</i> var. <i>prophesida</i>) and &quot;type 1 x type 2&quot; for such combinations as <i>Sidhia tolkienii</i> x <i>uncanonicus fantasylandia</i>. Also, your Angsty!Goth!Sue could probably be classified as an Emo!Sue, if my understanding is correct.<br><br>Second of all, I wonder if the source of the Glitter affects the type of Sue. That is, you drew Glitter from several sources of various types and used the combination to produce a variety of different types in the dummy. What if you drew Glitter from only one source, or one type of source, and increased the levels in the dummy with that?<br><br>Third, wraiths have blood? O.o<br><br>I mean these points only in a spirit of advancing science, so I hope you&#39;ll take them in the same spirit. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>For one, she&#39;s smarter than London. London would have accepted the &#39;Mouth to Mouth&#39; excuse Zack gave. Secondly, London views anyone who is poor as animals, so she wouldn&#39;t like Cody like that. Thirdly, London is nowhere near as serious as the girl in that story, that&#39;s usually Maddie&#39;s turf.</p>

            <p>When Character Replacements enter the story, they generally kidnap the Character they&#39;re replacing and stashing them into a plot hole. I think the plot hole i this story that the real London might be hiding is when Cody is in hospital, and Zack is asleep in the room next to him. Hospitals rarely, if ever, have adjoining rooms, and family or friends have to go home to sleep, no matter what, unless they&#39;re in a chair. If she got lost in that plot hole, chances are she&#39;s thinking she simply took a wrong turn from Shoe Planet.</p>

            <p>Some hospitals/wards might have adjoining rooms. I&#39;m thinking top-flight maternity wards (probably not appropriate here) and specialised children&#39;s hospitals. Of course, in America they might be a bit more expensive than they can afford (unless London&#39;s paying of course).</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC Board Halloween Costume Party! This will be going on the whole weekend (24-26), so I hope you enjoy.<br><br>I hope you wore your costume, because this is a masquerade. I&#39;m not in mine yet, since otherwise it&#39;d be obvious.<br><br>---------------------------<br><br>The (secondary) Board has been decorated in an impressively slapdash way. Orange and black streamers decorate the room, and pumpkins of various sizes litter the floors, waiting to be tripped over. In the center of the room is a table cluttered with bowls of candies. Next to the table is a cooler of sodas and and various bleep drinks. <br><br>---------------------------<br><br><i> When you make your introductory post in here, make sure to describe your costume. Your username can be of a canon character, and the actual &#39;costume&#39;, the description, can be as creative or accurate as you care to be.<br><br>This will be going on in here and in the <a href="http://pub19.bravenet.com/chat/show.php/1551371238">Bravo chat</a> as well.<br><br>Have fun! </i></p>

            <p>Chani shrugs. <br><br>&quot;I know the effects on normal people, but not on Sues. Perhaps that can be tested. Unfortunately, there&#39;s the off-chance that it&#39;ll give them abilities beyond comprehension, but then that&#39;s the power of the spice.&quot;</p>

            <p>There is a young man here who moves with the alert confidence of someone who has won many battles. His long, uneven brown hair is tied back so as to obscure little of his face and less of his vision. However, the blue-and-green mask he wears covers at least enough of his face on its own.<br><br>As our imaginary viewer&#39;s eyes travel downward, they pause on a blue cape, a slightly battered breastplate over a gray-green tunic, and a worn sword hanging from the man&#39;s belt.<br><br>After a few moments spent looking around, Felix nods, steps forward a little, and holds out his hand. Those sensitive to magical or psychic phenomena would see a giant ghostly hand spring out from his own, close gently on a cup of Hot Bleepolate, and carry it back to him; those not so sensitive would simply see the cup flying into Felix&#39;s hand. He raises the cup to his mouth, but stops as it hits the mask. His other arm moves up into a facepalm.</p>

            <p>Sheryl snapped, &quot;that my singing is so good that even giant alien space bugs appreciate it. I protected my adopted home from enemies with my songs, at the risk of my own life. What has &#39;nuclear fuzz-grunge&#39;, whatever that is, ever done for humanity?&quot; Sheryl&#39;s hair was practically standing on end, her eyes somehow flashing angrily in the dim lighting. Hiro&#39;s comment hadn&#39;t quite been quiet enough for the pro singer to miss.</p>

            <p>A young woman leaned on the wall, blue eyes closed as she waited for other partygoers to turn up. She wore a short, blue sleeveless dress, which was longer in the back than the front, over a half-sleeved white blouse, with a large pink bow tied around her neck. Her hands and forearms were covered by spotless white gloves, and a chunky bangle dangled from one wrist. Her pink and blonde hair was topped by a blue beret the same colour as her dress, and she wore a pair of tan-coloured knee-length heeled boots on her feet. A half-empty can of soda dangled from one hand as she flipped her hair back to reveal a single earring, an iridescent purple gem hanging delicately within a golden rhombus and connected to her ear by a wire so fine it was invisible but for the single bead halfway down it.</p>

I&#39;m also certain that this is because I sent my recordings in inside of a month after I got the lines. So unless I was sent more lines recently that didn&#39;t go through, I must insist that there is some error here.</p>

My story actually has the potential to turn into an intermission for my agent. Unfortunately, I have hit a sort of writer&#39;s block.<br><br>My agent has found herself trapped in a room with no windows, no portals, and all doors locked.

            <p>It becomes reality somewhere in the PPC.  Who hasn&#39;t said &quot;if these walls could talk...&quot; at some point?  Saying it in the wrong place could invoke the Ironic Over-Power and the walls would start talking.</p>

            <p>Firstly, there&#39;s the Minis. Not sure which ones would be able to teleport or anything like that, but I know my mini-Agent, Arit, is capable of shapeshifting and all that, so he could easily answer back.<br>Next, there&#39;s the ghosts. Not sure if HQ would have many, but maybe if the room were close to the Tomb of the Forgotten Agent?<br>Then it could always be herself answering back. I&#39;m guessing Quantum Physics in HQ would be very skewed, so talking to yourself could very well cause a copy of yourself to form.<br>And my final idea, why not the security team? They&#39;re Weeds, and as we know, weeds can get ANYWHERE. *Glares at his garden*.<br><br>Or we could go with ye old reliabile hallucinations...</p>

            <p>None that are well-researched or well-documented, that&#39;s for sure. However, I happen to like a variety of non-<i>Camellia sinensis</i> hot infused beverages (my definition of herbal tea), and I think there are benefits in drinking them just as there are benefits from infused tea. {= ) As for echinacea warding off colds or chamomile making you sleepy, I don&#39;t know, but it can&#39;t hurt to try. They smell nice, they taste nice, they can contain antioxidants and various other healthful chemicals, they provide variety in one&#39;s life, and they don&#39;t have to have caffeine.

            <p>But when it comes to echinacea, it&#39;s been tested plenty, and doesn&#39;t stop you getting colds in the slightest.<br><br>I find herbal teas disappointing.

            <p>Presumably, somewhere out there, there are civilised people, who threaten a delicate china cup of hot water with a teabag, then add lemon to it. You could be one of that sort of tea drinker instead. Unfortunately, over here in Yorkshire, we have to take our tea the manly way. Otherwise how would we know we were in Yorkshire?

            <p>I mean, you don&#39;t have to like tea, but my goal is to get the word out--the right word--for people who are not <s>crotchety</s> seasoned tea-drinkers like Pads. For example, highly-steeped tea is definitely not for beginners. You definitely want it more steeped if you&#39;re going to put other stuff in it, but not if you&#39;re going to drink it straight.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s true that smell doesn&#39;t necessarily reflect flavor, but tea is a multi-sensory experience.

            <p>I think lot of us start on the wrong foot and get turned off tea forever. Apparently some fool on Yahoo! somewhere said that Earl Gray tastes like Froot Loops. A girl who writes for our little student publication went in expecting Froot Loops and got tea with bergamot, and of course was shocked and dismayed. That&#39;s the sort of thing I want to correct, at least on my campus.<br><br>Part of the problem is not growing up with tea. It&#39;s an acquired taste, so if people haven&#39;t got a liking for it from saturation in the womb, it takes time to appreciate it.<br><br>The other part of the problem is the culture of instant gratification. One can slam a quick cup of tea if necessary, but I&#39;ve always liked the process of boiling water, watching the tannins seep from the teabag, breathing the steam, feeling the warmth of the cup, and finally savoring the flavor. It&#39;s more than just a beverage--it&#39;s anti-stress. Perhaps that&#39;s an Asian influence, but they did start the whole tea-drinking thing.<br><br>... I&#39;m rambling. I&#39;m not even sure I have a point, other than &quot;tea is fantastic.&quot; <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>~Neshomeh,</sup></sup> going to peruse the tea website now.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m with you on the ritual. When Trojie and I are in the midst of writing, I need a constant supply of tea, but my pint-and-a-half mug takes about ten minutes to brew to my satisfaction. So I end up just chucking the milk in when it&#39;s like dishwater, and letting it brew next to the computer. But it&#39;s never the same. Mostly, I think, because part of the ritual is letting it brew for the length of time it takes to smoke a roll.<br><br>As for saturation in the womb, you&#39;re not wrong there either. When I was visiting my sister a few weeks back, we took my two year old niece out to buy her first ever proper teacup, because it just doesn&#39;t taste right out of a plastic beaker. She likes it milky at the moment, but we&#39;ll train her onto the harder stuff as best we can.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t vastly keen on tea when I was dead little, but my parents drink it constantly, so it was that or water. I will admit to taking three sugars at first. Brining it down to two was easy. Cutting down to one, not so bad. Cutting out sugar altogether was tough, but made me lose a stone.<br><br>Oh, and Earl Grey? Vile muck. Stick to Tetley or PG Tips.</p>

            <p>And that the teas smell create, and then don&#39;t follow up on flavour. And it also depends on the tea that we&#39;re looking at. Green tea has proven to contain antioxidants that enable you to lose weight if you drink it before exercising by loosening up the cholesterol and fat in the bloodstream. Other than that, I&#39;d say the ohter effects would mostly come through aromatherapy from the tea, not actually drinking it.<br><br>Artic, whose new white kitten is wondering what these fun &#39;Key&#39; things are.</p>

            <p>We get a lot of limescale in the water here, and it makes for positively delightful scum on the top. And then, presumably, gets stained black and adheres to the inside of the mug, where it gradually becomes thicker and knobblier. So it&#39;s not so much flaky bits as the entire inside of the mug being coated with a thick tar.</p>

            <p>I always wondered about the scum on the top. It gets there even when I&#39;m sure the mug is perfectly washed out, so it couldn&#39;t be soap scum.

            <p>The true tea drinker will always let it accumulate. Washing it out washes away the flavour! Next time you wash your tea mug, wash the outside, and wash around the rim inside, about where you fill it up to (there should be a handy line of scum for guidance). The repeated boiling water will kill any germs, and after a few weeks, you&#39;ll be horrifed by seeing what your intestines must look like.</p>

            <p>Like many Infrastructure Departments, the DMSE&amp;R tends to just get mentions in other missions. I believe there&#39;s an Agent from them in the Alumia exorcism, for instance, and I recall some from the macrovirus crisis. But there&#39;s no actual &#39;fics involving just them.<br><br>As to whether it would work? Well, it could, naturally. There is a tragic lack of actual Infrastructure stories (most are either an Action Agent visiting, an Inf Agent sent on an Action mission, or some sort of crisis -- the Intel reports may count as pure Inf stories, as well as Leto&#39;s General Store writings, and maybe the DIA  stuff), and I&#39;ve had various conversations about redressing that. Sadly, though, the life of a Finance Agent is <i>dull</i> and not worth writing about. DMSE&amp;R, however, might be promising.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I actually haven&#39;t even touched <i>Eldest</i>, since the first atrocity was enough to turn me off to the dude.<br><br>So far, though, I&#39;ve looked at a few different reviews, and they seem to be either<br><br>1) This book was awesome, it was perfect, Paolini pulled off another hit and if you didn&#39;t like it, well, you&#39;re not the intended audience (BWAH? I&#39;m not &quot;too old&quot; for it, I&#39;m freakin&#39; eighteen!) and should probably stick to your generation&#39;s classics and stop nitpicking. Or something.<br><br>2) This book wasn&#39;t a worthy conclusion of the first two, which were amazing, because of A) the plot was too slow and there was way too much filler, B) the pacing was weird (which amounts to the same thing, really), or C) What. The. Heck? I don&#39;t know what he did, but it was not nearly as good. He should&#39;ve just taken a little longer and finished the series. [The general consensus seems to be that if he had too much for one book, he still didn&#39;t have enough for two, and should&#39;ve just cut stuff to make it fit.]<br><br>3) Another disappointment by Paolini, I&#39;m not sure why I picked this up after the first two, but it&#39;s basically more angsting, more whining, more Eragon-can-do-no-wrong hero worship, more self-insertion. Don&#39;t bother.<br><br>*shrug* That&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen, anyway. I&#39;ll probably be towards the third camp. <br><br>(Does anyone know where I can find a good snarky synopsis of the first, or second books? I remember one Agent doing them, but haven&#39;t seen them in a while, and for some reason I&#39;m thinking it was Nscangal, but that might&#39;ve been &#39;cos she did the <i>DaVinci Code</i>... thing. &#39;s like a cross between a review and an MST.)<br><br>Also, I can&#39;t be the only person who&#39;s waiting with bated breath for the day after Mr. Paolini finishes his book, and then stages a press release, saying &quot;OH my GOD, I can&#39;t believe people actually bought that! Dude, I just lost a bet with my friend for $1,000! He <i>told</i> me people would buy the worst book I could put out as long as I threw enough fantasy into it, but I never would&#39;ve believed him... Ah, well. Let me get on and see if I can write something for the real fantasy readers out there now, eh?&quot; (seriously. I want something to redeem the homeschooled authors out there.)</p>

            <p>And that was enough. After I finished, I literally threw it at my wall in disgust. And the movie wasn&#39;t any better. I agree with the comment someone made; that it&#39;s simply Star Wars retold via Lord of the Rings, with a bit of Dragonriders of Pern thrown in.<br><br>The reason publishers publish it is because it does appeal to the masses, unfortunately. Since a lot of us are widely-read, and have the ability to critically analyze a book by looking at it, that&#39;s why you&#39;ll hardly find a good word about it around here. It&#39;s a generic fantasy novel with elements of others, thus making it easy to read, and even easier to create your mental images of what&#39;s happening in there. In a lot of cases, people won&#39;t even realise that the plot is essentially Star Wars, since it has dragons and it&#39;s in a fantasy setting, as opposed to the Sci-Fi genre of Star Wars.<br>What really irks me is that all these people are praising him because of the age he was when he released the books. &#39;Oh he&#39;s so talented, and so young!&#39;. Too bad they&#39;re mistaking talent for determination.<br><br>Ok, that&#39;s the end of Artic&#39;s rant, brought to you by the letters W,T and F.</p>

            <p>Just the ability to find what&#39;s truly good in the story. I was rather impressed that he was capable of finishing a book before being an adult, and he has made an excellent world, it&#39;s just that he focuses more on taking elements from other stories than creating ones of his own in his own, original work. The story of Star Wars, while probably the most famous example, follows a writing blueprint, which I can&#39;t remember the name of, that most stories follow in one way or another. The reason I support Star Wars as opposed to Eragon is the lack of any truly original elements in his story. Eragon is essentially a Character Insert, CP has admitted it himself, but if I ever met such a person, I&#39;d probably deck him.<br><br>A lot of my friends enjoy Eragon. And a lot of excellent authors would too, because it&#39;s a familiar story being retold. A lot of us a pickier though, preferring to want something new in a story, rather than reread old stuff in a new format. The reason Kenya Starflight likes Eragon is because the storyline so closely parallels Star Wars. SHe is an excellent writer, I can tell just from reading that one story, but I&#39;m not gonna hold it against her for liking the story, just because I don&#39;t. Everyone has a right to their own opinions. I just don&#39;t happen to agree with this one because CP offends me as a writer in the way that he has crappy character development, cannot seem to make original fiction, has a generic location, etc.</p>

            <p>Much older. They were published in 1968, and Australian copyright lasts for 50 years, unless special extensions are made. 50 years after the death of the author, that is.<br><br>In which case, this just adds another bad point to the crime. Unless he gained permission from Le Guin herself, he could eaisly be sued for it. Chances are that no-one else has made the connection, or Le Guin refuses to read the books.<br>Now that gives me a humerous mental picture of all the best Fantasy Authors sitting in a circle, discussing this and that. They look at the cover of &#39;Eragon&#39;, and decide to throw it in the fire. They all have British accents for some reason, though not all of them are British.</p>

            <p>Ugh. Don&#39;t get me started on Brisingr. I&#39;m over 200 pages in, and absolutely NOTHING of importance has happened yet. I&#39;m starting to think that it might just be another brick of filler material until Eragon finally kills off Galbwhatever in Book 4. <br><br>Mild spoilers below in the event anyone cares...<br><br>Paolini seems to have picked up on a few teenage trends, as there&#39;s a cutting scene and a furry. Well, okay, the cutting scene is a &quot;test of strength&quot; over who gets to lead the rebels, but it reminded me WAY TOO MUCH of the emo!Sue cutting her wrists in badfic... And the furry is an Elf guy who decided to take on the form of a wolf, or something to that effect. Apparently he gives off a scent that makes all the women in the vicinity want to mate with him. &gt;.<br>And yeah, emo!Eragon. Good Lord. One minute he&#39;s angsting over how many people he&#39;s killed, then he mercilessly kills a soldier who&#39;s begging to be spared, then he angsts over that, then he kills some more people... Ugh. I&#39;m rather pacifistic, so I&#39;m in pain at those parts... &gt;.<br>[/rant] <br><br>Good to be back on the Board, though. I need to remember to show up here more often... XD</p>
