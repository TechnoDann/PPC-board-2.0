            <p>Huinesoron was probably referring to the possibly-annual PPC Badfic Fest when he mentioned the agent slash coming later. If I&#39;m reading the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/">Fanfic Land</a> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/Page1.htm">PPC section</a> right, it should be coming up in a couple of weeks or thereabouts.

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Hello again, chums! It&#39;s that time again. We here at <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/">Fanfic Land</a> (The Fanfic You Can&#39;t Find Anywhere Else) are always eager to help out the fans of obscure works, those you can&#39;t write for anywhere else, and today we&#39;re highlighting one of our Internet Culture categories -- the PPC.<br><br>For those of you who don&#39;t know, the PPC, or Protectors of the Plotting Continuum (or something like that) is an internet phenomenon where &#39;Agents&#39; work for &#39;Flowers&#39; and kill &#39;Sues&#39;, working out of &#39;Hq&#39;. It&#39;s all very exciting, and we&#39;ve had some excellent work from our members in the past!<br><br>However, sad to say, the number of writers has gone down recently -- to be precise, no one&#39;s bothered since last July. This makes us her at FanfiC Land very sad, because we like having people writing on our site! Really we do! So go on, come back to us -- and get writing!<br><br>We know the internet moves very quickly sometimes, so there may be new writers among you. If there are, remember to pick a cool username, and, of course, to write yourself a profile. You can&#39;t make it big if noone knows who you are!<br><br>FfL Admin Team<br><br>~~~~~<br><br>This, for those of you who don&#39;t know, is the PPC Badfic Game. The premise is that a website has opened (Fanfic Land, of course) which features a PPC section. The internet being what it is, this attracts a horde of writers, most of them bad, and you, my dear fellow Boarders, are those writers.<br><br>The rules aren&#39;t exactly strict, but this is a game for the PPC fandom, rather than for the Board. Unlike the &#39;shipfest, most of the works from this will deal with Agents and their associated &#39;Sues, not with their Authors. Of course, this is badfic, so Authors may well show up, but it&#39;s primarily about the Agents and the PPC, not the Boarders.<br><br>The relevant section of the website is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/Page1.htm">PPC section</a>, and if I&#39;m not very clear about what&#39;s going on, take a look around and see what horrors we came up with last time. Additionally, this year, I&#39;m going to point at the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/category.htm">Internet Culture</a> category. At the moment it&#39;s just window dressing, designed to give the site a FF.net feel, but if anyone feels like writing a story for one of the other categories -- or one that I haven&#39;t listed -- that would be amusing. I note particularly that we have a &#39;Wiki Projects&#39; category... and a PPC Wiki. I&#39;ve no idea how you could write fanfic for the Wiki, but if you think you can, go for it!<br><br>It should be obvious that the name you use as a FfL writer does <i>not</i> have to be the same as your Board name, or any other handle you go by; only myself and kippur used the same names, and we were the first two to participate, before I&#39;d really started FfL. So pick a fun name, and create a persona -- or more than one, there&#39;s at least a couple of people who&#39;ve got two different &#39;accounts&#39; with different personalities. As to posting... well. There&#39;s no automatic posting, of course -- I have to add everything in by hand, so I&#39;ve got a few requests to make things easier.<br><br>First, it&#39;d be very helpful if anyone participating for the first time &#39;creates an account&#39;. What this means in practice is that you make a post giving your author name and a profile I can add to your, well, profile page. This will mean that when you leave reviews, they will be &#39;signed&#39; -- they&#39;ll link back to your profile. So even if you&#39;re not writing a story, an account can be useful.<br><br>As an aside: when it comes to reviews, I pluck them from the replies to the posted chapters of the stories. This is a fully in-character game, so these reviews are more like gutsy<em>gem</em>iwrya&#39;s &#39;lol romantic!!&#39; than a Boarder saying how amusingly terrible it was. And yes, flames are allowed -- we all <i>know</i> it&#39;s not serious. And you can review-reply to your own story, or to your reviewers.<br><br>Following the aside, second point: when you start a story, it helps immensely if you make sure to give your FfL author name (obviously), along with the title of the story and, if possible, the details that will appear on the front page -- Category, Rating (G, PG, PG-13, R), Language, Genre. The other things I put in myself, but these four (well, Category and Language are usually PPC and English, so you don&#39;t need to mention them unless they&#39;re different) these two I&#39;d appreciate it if you could give me. Makes my job easier.<br><br>Third, and finally, this is a game which pretends everyone is posting directly to the website. The various people throwing &#39;shipfics back and forth at each other in the &#39;shipfest was immensely amusing (and sometimes disturbing :P), but doesn&#39;t work in this format, really. In general, this one involves the first chapter of a story being attached to this post, and then the reviews to that chapter as replies to it, and the next chapter also attached to the first, and so on down.<br><br>Um... I think that covers most of it. Yes, I will be continuing the epic tale of Jaycacia Thornbyrd (OMG shes like SO COOOOOL!!) once I have a little time to think about it. If anyone has any questions that need clarifying, just ask, or check the page and use your common sense. And yes, as I said, you can have more than one account.<br><br>Oh, and thanks (blame?) go to Cassie and Neshomeh for sparking this off. I&#39;m only posting this because I&#39;m the one with the password to the website.<br><br>hS</p>

One made me laugh with his attempts at being &quot;gangsta&quot;, so I&#39;ve based it mostly off of him.

            <p>Summary:A story about the love and life of Melba,the Smut Carver.<br><br>Melba was running through the corridors of HQ,thinking about the life she had lost forever.<br><br><i>Picnics in the soft grass...</i><br><br><i>Rejuvinating dives in lakes of pure azure...</i><br><br><i>Wild dances under the night sky...</i><br><br><i>And all in the confines of HQ...</i><br><br>However,it was all taken from her when one fine day,the Flowers kidnapped her and took her to a secret lab,where they dressed her in black leather and whipped her unmercifully.<br><br>Saying that &quot;they needed something to keep your fellow Agents in line&quot;,they pumped Sue compounds into her body and forced her to read one thousand and one bad smut ideas.<br><br>They kept tourturing her for three days and three nights,until they released her into a grey and cruel world.<br><br>There,she did her duty well,traumatizing her former comrades with her evil and strange ways.<br><br>After brooding(gothically) about what her life had become, she continued running along the passageways,crying.<br><br>Then she met Melvin.<br><br>He was the only person who saw through the veil of disgust that she had woven about herself. He was the only person that cared about her despite what she has done.<br><br>She surrendered to him,and they had nights of love in convinient broom closets and patches of grass that appeared whenever they were.<br><br>However,the Flowers were wrathful that she had found love,and they sent an army of Evil Dandelions to destroy her happiness. She used all her abilities to protect her loved one,but was shot by one of their hired snipers.<br><br>Using the last of her powers to teleport Melvin to safety,she expired.<br><br>Melvin then later founded a brotherhood of gallant smut Knights(and priests,can&#39;t have a cult whithout priests)that lasted until this day: THE CULT OF THE SMUT CARVER!<br><br>~~~~~<br><i>The Sub Rosa looked up from the piece of paper she had been holding,and said: &quot;I&#39;ve never seen such a horrible pack of lies my entire life!&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;You&#39;ll get over it,my fellow Board Member,said the Marquis de Sod.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;You&#39;re right. Judging by the reports sent by my Department,not even the Cult members belived the fic,even</i>after<i>Melvin neuralyzed them.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;Really?&quot;</i><br><br><i>Yes.</i><br><br><i>&quot;Phew! I tought I might have to treat you to some Bleeperin just to calm your nerves.Not that I tought that was a bad thing,of course.&quot;<i><br><br><i>Don&#39;t worry.

            <p>Summary:A story about the love and life of Melba,the Smut Carver.<br><br>Melba was running through the corridors of HQ,thinking about the life she had lost forever.<br><br><i>Picnics in the soft grass...</i><br><br><i>Rejuvinating dives in lakes of pure azure...</i><br><br><i>Wild dances under the night sky...</i><br><br><i>And all in the confines of HQ...<i><br><br>However,it was all taken from her when one fine day,the Flowers kidnapped her and took her to a secret lab,where they dressed her in black leather and whipped her unmercifully.<br><br>Saying that &quot;they needed something to keep your fellow Agents in line&quot;,they pumped Sue compounds into her body and forced her to read one thousand and one bad smut ideas.<br><br>They kept tourturing her for three days and three nights,until they released her into a grey and cruel world.<br><br>There,she did her duty well,traumatizing her former comrades with her evil and strange ways.<br><br>After brooding(gothically) about what her life had become, she continued running along the passageways,crying.<br><br>Then she met Melvin.<br><br>He was the only person who saw through the veil of disgust that she had woven about herself. He was the only person that cared about her despite what she has done.<br><br>She surrendered to him,and they had nights of love in convinient broom closets and patches of grass that appeared whenever they were.<br><br>However,the Flowers were wrathful that she had found love,and they sent an army of Evil Dandelions to destroy her happiness. She used all her abilities to protect her loved one,but was shot by one of their hired snipers.<br><br>Using the last of her powers to teleport Melvin to safety,she expired.<br><br>Melvin then later founded a brotherhood of gallant smut Knights(and priests,can&#39;t have a cult whithout priests)that lasted until this day: THE CULT OF THE SMUT CARVER!<br><br>~~~~~<br><i>The Sub Rosa looked up from the piece of paper she had been holding,and said: &quot;I&#39;ve never seen such a horrible pack of lies my entire life!&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;You&#39;ll get over it,my fellow Board Member,said the Marquis de Sod.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;You&#39;re right. Judging by the reports sent by my Department,not even the Cult members belived the fic,even</i>after<i>Melvin neuralyzed them.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;Really?&quot;</i><br><br><i>Yes.</i><br><br><i>&quot;Phew! I tought I might have to treat you to some Bleeperin just to calm your nerves.Not that I tought that was a bad thing,of course.&quot;<i><br><br><i>Don&#39;t worry. Now,is it just me,or are Het!Author-Wraiths stalking us...</i> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br></i></i></i></i></p>

            <p>Title: Song of the Vampire<br>Genre: Angst<br>Summary: Selene&#39;s partner died last year. Now shes trying to recover. xover with Twilightt.<br><br>A/N Okay so I read this book called <i>Twilite</i> and it had vampires in it. An I was thinking about the PPc and how theres vampires Agents and I thought itd be cool if Selene wasn&#39;t a vampire like she is (how doesnt she burn up in the son, anyway?) but a vampire out of tWilight instead and then I herd this song which was reelly aptropriate to the story so I just had to right it!!<br><br>~*&amp;*~<br><br><b>My life goes on in endless song<br>Above Earths lamentations</b><br><br>Selene Morgana Windflower Perdita Lilith X sat in her response centre listening to the music in her mind. It had been a year since her partner Daffyd had been killed and she was still sad.<br><br><b>I hear the real though far off hymn<br>That hales a new creation</b><br><br>He had been on a mission with his girlfriend Constance and had blown himself up with a ring Selene had given him (A/N is that write?). She had been upset but Constance had left the PPC before the campire could apologise, so she was left alone with her grief.<br><br><b>Through all the tumbles and the strife<br>I hear its music ringing</b><br><br>Since then Selene hadn&#39;t had a partner, and had had to go on missions all alone, because she was being punished for letting her partner die even though she hadn&#39;t been there. This meant she was even more sad, and the bonsy Mallorn hated her.<br><br><b>It sounds an echo in my soul<br>How can I keep from singing</b><br><br>BEEEEEEEEP went the console and Selene pressed the button to make it shut up. She had another mission, and it was a very hard one. She got her bag and opened the portal and stepped through.<br><br><b>When tyrants tremble in their fear<br>And hear their death bell ringing</b><br><br>On the other side of the portal Middleearth was dark cnd grey. It was raining and Selene was miserable as she walked through the puddles towards Rivendale. She could still hear the music in her mind, though, and that encouraged her and kept her going.<br><br><b>When friends rejoice both far and near<br>How can I keep from sniging</b><br><br>As the vampire reached the edge of Rivendale she paused on the bridge, looking up. Miraculusly, the clouds seemed to clear over head, and a brilliant ray of sunshine shone down on Selene. She held up her hand in the light and watched the sparkles move over her skin like thousands of glittering diamonds.<br><br><b>In prison cell and dungeon vile<br>Our thoughts to them ar winging</b><br><br>Standing on the bridge, listening to the music, Selene smiled. Life wasn&#39;t so bad after all, she decided, watching her hand. There were worse things that could happen to her, and had in the past. Now that was all behind her. Holding her head high and sparkling like an opal, the vampire Assassin went on with her mission.<br><br><b>When friends by shame are undefined<br>How can I keep from singing</b></p>

            <p>Account details:<br>Username: XxLuminescent-TearsxX<br>Profile details: I am a Traveler on the Road of Lyfe. From the Ancient Moonlight of Yesteryear, I bring to you the many Musings of One, once Mortal, now a Goddess of the Night...a Vampyre Ascended into the very Pinnacle of Power. Look not directly upon my Face, for the Crystal Tears of an Immortal will haunt your Soul and rise within your Dreams.<br><br><br>Story:<br>Title: Forsaken By The Sun<br>Genre: Angst/Romance<br>Summary: Two Vampyres Dwelling Within HQ...can their Love ease the Pain of Eternity?<br><br>Chapter One<br>~~~<br>A/N: No Flames, for our Intrepid Lovers must not be Harmed by Harsh Words. You may give them Praise and good Reviews to raise their Spirits, if you Wish.<br><br>/\/\/\/\/\/&lt;br&gt;<br>She hated Them. The Sues. Their cheer made mockery of her sadness, the way they walked amid the Great pained her, for they could never truly appreciate it as She did. So happy. They were. Yes, so happy, unknowing of the cold anguish that seizes the soul after one has lived age upon age in the Darkness, alone at heart no matter how many forms pass by upon the physical plane, people seeming like insubstantial wisps, for they lived so short a time and cared so little for Her that they could never truly seem real to Her. And so she did the Duty set out for Her, and took the lives of Sues, bitterly hating them. They could see Canon outside of the velvet Darkness of the Night, where She could only ever walk by Midnight, forced to flee each Canon before the Sun could rise and end her Life, if it could truly be called a life when all around her was so meaningless. Their Shallow mockery of Happiness ended as her knife slid whispersoft into their bodies, their blood falling gently all around her like the tears she so bravely fought to keep from spilling.<br>There was no Sunlight in HQ. No Ending to her life that it might Dawn and catch her unawares. Thus her pearly white skin, of Haunting opalescent sheen, was never Graced by Daylight in one Final Embrace that would light her up Translucent and Ethereal before she would disolve into Mists of Ephemera, her ancient Soul gone Forever. Instead her Raven hair, long and silken and flowing like a River around her slender body, blended with the Night, dark her Hair, dark the worlds around her...dark her Heart. Eyes of Silver like shining precious Crystals shone amid the bleakness, as though She wore bright Stars for eyes and held within them all the Agony and Torment of all that has ever lived.<br>She wore the Uniform of the PPC, plain and Black, and did not care, for compared to the Sorrow in her Heart, a mere artice of Clothing was as Nothing to Her. And so, lost within her Greif, she was Unseeing of the way others Eyes follwed Her, their Dreams of her and the way Her slender yet voluptuous curves lay within the rough fabric, at once outlines and temptingly covered over by it&#39;s dark cover of much of Her body, in a way that seemed to invite any Man to seek to discover the Mysteries hidden yet hinted at by her Clothing.<br>Yet She dared not engage in Dalliance with them. She was a Vampyre, and her Cold marbleesque Skin would startle them if they were to touch it, expecting the warmth of human flesh. Soft, soft and smooth as silk, yet cold as Stone and unyielding to the touch. Their Blood ran too hot for Her and so She dared not embrace them, lest Temptation overtake her and drive her to tear their lives from them in the Sweet Pain of one final touch in which her Ivory fangs would drain their Life&#39;s Essence away and let them sink into the Darkness of Death, encircled by Her fair yet cold arms. She Shunned them therefore in order to let them keep their Lives, blessed by a Mortal span in which they would not outlive their time and leave all that they had Loved behind, as She had.<br>Alone, always alone. Her father, Her mother, dead, their voices now no more than Echoes in Her memory. Her sisters cruelly stolen, and slain before Her eyes when She had sought to save them. Her friends, long since dead of old age, having so Harshly turned their backs on her when they discovered what She had become. Of all the things to miss, even the loyal hound of the family. It had turned on Her, as all Animals now did, and she had been forced to kill it before the eyes of her Family, revealing strength beyond that of a Mortal, causing them to Forsake her. She missed the Trust and sweetness of mute Creatures, that loved her no more and avoided one they Sensed bore a Life that was not Natural. The first such Creature she recalled had been no more than a goldfish. Merely a fish, when She was but a Child. It had Died, and She had known the Endings of Lives for the first time. All things Die, her Parents had explained to her and She had been afraid, afraid of Her dying, of their Dying, of losing and others. If only it had been True. If only, like the Fish that had been Swimming one day and buried the next, She could have known true Death. Instead She was left behind as as all else faded and all Others died.<br>She, She who was Ellerianniel Darkrose, Raven Lady of Sorrow...She was alone. Could there ever be any Other who would not Die, would not leave Her? Was there such a One? Far away...or closer than She might imagine?<br><br>/\/\/\/\/\/\/&lt;br&gt;A/N: I hope you have enjoyed this Tale so far, I will Update soon and reveal what is to come at that point. If you have liked it, please Review.</p>

            <p>Summary: This is my firts stroy Im putting up so plz be nice cos I don&#39;t like flames the make me sad!<br>So yeah I heard about the marcovirus invasion in March and I herad abotu MakesThings being killed by tehm. and I thought tht was reallu really sad cos he was a niec guy and nobody ever payed much attentoin to him. SO I thouht abuot what would have hapened if some1 had saved hime bfore the marcrovirus (whateverthat is) got him.<br><br>Chap 1<br><br>MakesThings was in his workshop fixingthings as usual and he wasjust working one a Cad when he got a mesage from teh Sonflower Offical. So he wnet to check it. It saidn “there has been a marcaovvirus invasion and you need to makes Tardisses for all of teh Agnets so they will hvae somwher to live cos hQ will be dagnerous”.<br><br>So MakesThigs calledn TechnoDann and they began to build Tardisses for every1. Then TechnoDann had to go adn build somwher for teh ohter ppl in the Deppartmnet adn MakesThings was all alone and building the  Tardises. He was soo busy working taht he didn;t notice that a marcoviruss was comign towrads him… but soemone els e did.<br><br>Tehre was a gunshiot and MakesThigns turned round quiickly. It was an Agetn fromm the Dpeartment of MarySUes (A/N he ciould tell byt the badge she wore I forgot what its caled lol) adn she said tohim “yu need to be mor carful tehy are getin everywhrer”. He juts looked atthe dead macrdovirus and he said nto the Agnet “you saved my life thank you asoo much”. Then he said “what is your naem”? and she said “I amd Melody Windfire Breeze but just cal me Mel and I was a Sue but now Im and Agent for Teh PpC”.<br><br>He smile d cos he thouht she was pretty but not liek an real Sue cos she was al dirty (A/N adn Sues dont get dirty) but thehn he looke dbehind her and shoutded “lookout theres another oen”! She turnde round and treid to shot it but it was to close so MakesThinsg grabed a gun of the bench and shot…<br><br>A/N: OMG whats goingn to hapen to them? Well plz R&amp;R adn I’ll get the next chapter out quickr cos reveiws make me want to work!<br></p>

            <p>1/ Badfic writers don&#39;t usually ask permission. :P So far, we&#39;ve not had any problems with people not wanting their Agents used. Off the top of my head, the only Agents with rules about them are Laburnum&#39;s pair who aren&#39;t really Laburnum&#39;s and who she has to get permission to use. I&#39;d hold off on using them, but other than that -- you&#39;re a badfic author!<br><br>2/ I think we have a couple of stories classed as NC-17 on there... yes, there&#39;s <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/Story2.htm">Surprises at Twelve</a>, although that never got to the NC-17 bit. I think the most explicit story to date was <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/Story21.htm">Elvin Passions</a>, so you might want to use that as a guide. The aim of the game is to entertain rather than sicken, so.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Title: Childhood Crush<br>Author: VegetaFangurl4Eva! (OOC: I already have an account at Fanfic Land)<br>Summary: One day Jason wonders the hall and wonders why nobodie sees him. Thn he meats some1 who does. Georgia/Jason<br><br>One day Jason was bored and lonely in the nursery. All the ladies in charge (LOL! I can&#39;t remember the right word 4 them!) were bsy qith other kids and wrn&#39;t paying attention to him so he was sad. &quot;It&#39;s not fair&quot; he said &quot;Mummy hasn&#39;t visited me in ages and no one plays with me cuz Im wierd.&quot; Coz, you see though Jason was very handsome for his age and kind to evryone he met none of the other kids would be his friend because he was from a fanfic from a fandom no1 had heard of and he kept fading into wallz. <br><br>&quot;This is stuupid.&quot; Jason said. &quot;Im going to go find some1 to be my frend.&quot; So he left the nursey, all the adults being to busy to pay attention to him and wondereded about in hq. All the agents passed him by, one person tripped over him. No1 could see him and that made Jason cry. &quot;Why wont anyone be my friend? am i doomed to never know tru wuv?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aw don&#39;t cry.&quot; Jason looked up to see a girl agent with beautiful curly red hair, emerald green eyes and clear skin (i no Georgia has freckles but i dont like freckles so in my story she doesn&#39;t have them) leaning over him. Thogh she was only a little older than him she had a firgure like an hourglass and was more beautiful than Luthien. <br><br>&quot;Who r u?&quot; Jason asked, blushing fiercly. &quot;Can u see me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m Georgia Branch and of course I can see you, genki-chan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How can u see me? And wot does genki-chan mean?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can see you coz I have super agents powerz and genki-chan means really cute person.&quot; Georgia said, finally bringing in words other htan dialogue.<br><br>Jason smiled, happy that someone thought he was cute. &quot;I&#39;m Jason. Wanna get married?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, Jason-chan,&quot; Georgia said &quot;Ai shiteru&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yay!&quot;<br><br>And they lived happily ever after until July Flame and Kumori Tenki tracked them down, banged their heads together a few times and sent them to Medical for a few months.<br><br></p>

            <p>A/N: Sorry its been so long since the last chapter! Also, i&#39;ve changed my name -- I&#39;m now JayBird, not Huinesoren. Write it down in your diaries!!!<br><br>~*&amp;*~<br><br>Acacia pulled out her bow and shot the SO in the head!!!!! But a pink and purple glow appeared around Jaycacia and the arrow stopped in mid air, with sparks flying up and down it. &quot;I can&#39;t let you do that, mother,&quot; the young girl said, standing her ground in front of Acacia.<br><br>The Assassin snarled a snarl of purest rage. &quot;You think you can defy me?!?!&quot; she bellowed, ignoring Jay, who let out a squeak and tried to burrow under the SO&#39;s desk. &quot;I have more power than you can possibly imagine, <i>little girl</i>.&quot; She unstrung her bow (A/N can you do that??) and held the wooden bit up in her hand. &quot;You think this is a bow?&quot; she demanded. &quot;I suppose you imagined I <i>trained</i> to achieve my perfect aim?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I never really thought about it,&quot; Jaycacia said blandly. &quot;But whatever it is, you may not use it to harm my mother -- or the SO.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who&#39;s going to stop me?&quot; Acacia demanded. &quot;You? You, little girl with no clothes? No weapons? You have <i>nothing</i>.&quot; She pointed the bow at her daughter and sighted along it.<br><br>Jaycacia did not even look embarrassed. &quot;I don&#39;t need clothes to stand up to you,&quot; she said in a strong voice, &quot;nor weapons. I have power.&quot;<br><br>&quot;AND SO DO I!&quot; Acacia shouted. From the tip of the bow a bolt of black light shot out, crossing the room in a flash and tearing into Jaycacia&#39;s chest.<br><br><i>Noooooooooooo!</i> The SO exclaimed. <i>Jaycacia, no!</i><br><br>Acacia Byrd turned, smiling cruelly. &quot;Youre next, flower,&quot; she said, and sighted along her bow.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br><i>&quot;No, don&#39;t tell me.&quot;<br><br>Acacia blinked, stopping at the foot of Jay&#39;s bed. &quot;You&#39;re awake? I thought you were asleep!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve been watching the calendar,&quot; Jay replied, sitting up and opening her eyes. &quot;I knew you&#39;d be along soon, Acy. Jaycacia again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re taking all the fun out of this,&quot; Acacia complained, holding up a sheet of paper. &quot;And you&#39;re not even in this chapter.&quot;<br><br>&quot;New chapter rather than new story?&quot; Jay asked. Acacia nodded. &quot;That&#39;s a new one for her. Who was the author, again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Someone named Huinesoron,&quot; Acacia supplied. &quot;Or at least, she <i>was</i> called that... she changed her name.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh?&quot; Swinging her legs over the side of the bed, Jay rubbed her eyes to clear them. &quot;What to?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll see when you read it,&quot; Acacia promised. &quot;But first... coffee?&quot;</i></p>

            <p>As Acacia aimed her wand at the SO, Jay turned away from the desk and threw herself on top of Jaycacia with a sob. &quot;Oh my beautiful darling daughter,&quot; she cried, kissing her face and lips. &quot;I only just got you back and now you&#39;re dead!! You can&#39;t be dead, Jaycacia! I love you!&quot; She pressed her hands to the beautiful girls&#39; chest, feeling an intense heat from where Acacia&#39;s bolt had hit. Acacia, meanwhile, was looking on with a sneer.<br><br>&quot;As if that means anything,&quot; she said cruelly. &quot;I thought I loved you once, before you betrayed me. Oh, yes,&quot; she went on, &quot;you&#39;re the reason I turned to evil - your cheating on me with Sean and Lux. But I&#39;ll never turn back, never! I&#39;m <i>happy</i> to be evil!&quot; And she laughed an evil laugh.<br><br>Turning, Jay glared at her through tear-stained eyes, clutching Jaycacia&#39;s body to her. &quot;You don&#39;t deserve love,&quot; she said, her voice breaking. &quot;But Jaycacia did, and now she&#39;s dead!&quot;<br><br><i>And we did love her,</i> the Sunflower Official said, his tendrils wrapping around Jay. <i>We two, we loved her dearly. And you took her away from us.</i> Supported by him, Jay bowed her head over Jaycacia&#39;s still form. Crystal tears slid from her eyes, splashing down onto the black stain between her breasts.<br><br>&quot;Oh, shut <i>up</i> already,&quot; Acacia snapped, swinging the wand round. &quot;That girl was a complete slut. She never loved either of you, she just <i>used</i> you. She deserves to be dead -- you all do!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But they will not be,&quot; a voice said, &quot;not today.&quot; Ignoring Jay&#39;s astonished exclamation, Jaycacia sat up. &quot;You may have power, but I have more, because I have known love, and you... you never have.&quot; Screaming, Acacia fired her want, but Jaycacia caught the black fire in her hand effortlessly. &quot;Not this time, mother,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;This time you&#39;ll lose -- permanently.&quot; The captured energy reformed itself into an ebon sword, which Jaycacia, leaping to her feet, swung at Acacia.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br><i>&quot;Sean? And </i>Lux<i>??<br><br>Acacia shrugged. &quot;It could be worse.&quot;<br><br>Jay stared at her. &quot;She&#39;s got me sleeping with </i>Sean and Lux<i>, how could it be worse?&quot;<br><br>Acacia raised an eyebrow. &quot;She could have you sleeping with the SO and a Mary-Sue?&quot; she suggested. Jay glowered.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s not the same. I mean, this is </i>Sean<i>. And-&quot;<br><br>&quot;And Lux, yes.&quot; Acacia shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m amazed that&#39;s the first thing you find objectionable about that... thing, Jay.&quot;<br><br>Jay shrugged. &quot;The rest of it&#39;s just funny, Acy. But that... ugh. Can you imagine what Lux would say?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... yes. In great detail.&quot; Acacia shuddered. &quot;Never tell her about this story.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agreed,&quot; Jay said fervently, and sipped her coffee before turning the page.</i></p>

            <p>The black blade struck the evil Assassin full on the chest. Acacia stared down at it for a stunned moment, and then exploded into a vortex of dark fire. For a moment it seemed about to consume them all, but Jaycacia concentrated and a pink-purple glow surrounded it, containing it... but not enough. &quot;Help me!&quot; she cried out. &quot;Mother, husband -- help me!&quot;<br><br>Struggling to stand against the howling wind that filled the office, Jay clutched at her daughter&#39;s hand. &quot;What can we do?&quot; she cried.<br><br>&quot;I told you!&quot; Jaycacia replied. &quot;The power... of love!&quot;<br><br>Jay blinked uncertainly. &quot;I do love you...&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s not... enough,&quot; Jaycacia said, the strain showing on her face. &quot;Have... to show--!&quot;<br><br><i>I understand,</i> the SO said, his tendrils already winding their way up Jaycacia&#39;s bare legs. <i>Jay, I will show her down here. You must kiss her -- now!</i> He wrapped a spare frond around Jay, pulling her close to Jaycacia&#39;s nude form. The older Assassin&#39;s hands pressed against her daughter&#39;s bosom as she kissed her hard on the mouth, feeling the younger girl responding eagerly. As her hands explored Jaycacia&#39;s body, the brilliant light started to overcome the darkness that had once been Acacia.<br><br>&quot;More!&quot; Jaycacia screamed. &quot;I must have more!&quot;<br><br><i>Gladly!</i> the SO cried, plunging his tendrils--<br><br>~<br><br><i>Jay put the sheaf of paper down. &quot;Does it get any better?&quot; she asked.<br><br>Acacia peered across the table, trying to read the upside-down story. &quot;Not really,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#39;re nearly at the end, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yah-huh.&quot; The former Assassin glanced further down the page.</i><br><br>~<br><br>Bucking beneath her lovers&#39; ministrations, Jaycacia felt the metal of the SO&#39;s desk, cold beneath her sweaty back. She gasped repeatedly as Jay&#39;s tongue--<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;I don&#39;t want to read this!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just skip to the end,&quot; Acacia recommended.</i><br><br>~<br><br>The trio lay upon the soft carpet--<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;Carpet? Since when did the SO have a carpet?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just. Read.&quot;</i><br><br>~<br><br>--upon the soft carpet, breathing heavily. The SO&#39;s tendrils were still tangled around the two women, touching and stroking their sensitive spots slowly. <i>Is she gone forever?</i> he asked quietly.<br><br>&quot;I think so,&quot; Jaycacia replied in a murmur. &quot;By your love for me, you have brought peace and safety to the PPC at last.&quot;<br><br><i>I am glad,</i> the Sunflower said. <i>And I am glad... to have you back.</i><br><br>&quot;I&#39;m glad to be back,&quot; Jaycacia said with a smile, and glanced across at her mother, sleeping soundly. &quot;Do you want me to go back to my Response Centre now, my love?&quot;<br><br><i>Hmm... perhaps not,</i> the SO said. <i>I&#39;ve just realised that I&#39;m in need of... let me see... a pair of assistants here in my office.</i><br><br>Jaycacia Thornbyrd smiled. &quot;An excellent idea,&quot; she murmured, and fell into a deep sleep.<br><br>~<br><br><i>&quot;... what, that&#39;s it?&quot; Jay asked.<br><br>Acacia shrugged. &quot;That&#39;s the end, apparently,&quot; she said. &quot;The story&#39;s marked as &#39;complete&#39;, so.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But she&#39;s still alive!&quot; Jay protested. &quot;Acacia, why&#39;s she still alive?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because she&#39;s a Mary-Sue, Jay,&quot; Acacia said calmly. &quot;Who did you think was going to kill her?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; Jay began, &quot;we--&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Acacia said firmly. &quot;We&#39;re not going back again. </i>No<i>.&quot;<br><br>Jay raised an eyebrow at her former partner, then lifted her mug and drained the last of her coffee. &quot;All right,&quot; she agreed. &quot;I suppose this means there&#39;ll be another story from her next year?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Quite likely,&quot; Acacia concurred. &quot;Want me to bring it to you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Could you wait until daylight next time?&quot; Jay asked plaintively. &quot;</i>Some<i> of us have work in the morning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Acacia replied, and grinned.</i></p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a while since I read the Ranma 1/2 manga but if they&#39;re really from Nerima, isn&#39;t that a legitimate explanation? I mean, I know that in theory not everyone in nerima has super martial art powers but you couldn&#39;t be blamed for thinking otherwise...</p>

            <p>For roughly two years now, I&#39;ve been planning a story, well, specifically, a fanfic. The problem is, it&#39;s a crossover. And I&#39;m not meaning one or two fandoms, I&#39;m meaning several. The list is as follows:<br><br>Kingdom Hearts<br>Pokemon<br>Charmed<br>Buffy<br>Digimon<br>Final Fantasy<br>Legend of Zelda<br>Harry Potter<br>High School Musical<br>Naruto<br>Tamora Pierce Tortallan Universe<br>Tamora Pierce Emelan Universe<br>City of Heroes<br><br>I know, it&#39;s a very long list, but hopefully, it&#39;ll make sense. In a short question, I just want to know, since we have the pinnacle of Fanfic Writers here, with people saying what should and shouldn&#39;t be allowed, is the following plot feasible:<br><br>Name: Worlds Apart<br>Set after Kingdom Hearts, Worlds Apart is the follow-up to Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. The main plot behind Kingdom Hearts is the invasion of evil creatures called Heartless, which are born out of the darkness in people&#39;s heart. When they are created, they then go after the Hearts of Worlds. Once they&#39;ve found a World&#39;s Heart, that World disappears, its inhabitants taken by the darkness and only those with very strong Hearts can make it to other worlds.<br><br>In Worlds Apart, it turns out the original invasion was just a preliminary wave, which required only the power of the Keyblade, a mythical weapon which can kill Heartless and lock the World Hearts, to turn back. The 12 Gods of the Universe decide it is time to bring forward their own main line of defense; the Crest Holders (Original idea is from Digimon)<br><br>Essentially, each of the Crest Holders represents one, pure personality trait of the human psyche. And along with being the Crest Holder of whichever trait they represent, Courage, Friendship, Love, etc, they also gain special weapons which are also capable of killing the Heartless. Since King Mickey and Sora closed and sealed off Kingdom Hearts in the first game, only the power of the Crest Holders is capable of bringing it back, by use of the World Savers on the five, primary worlds, which were the first five worlds to be created in that Universe. The Primary Worlds are the Pokemon World, Digimon World, Hyrule, Spira and the Destiny Islands.<br>Now, originally, only 9 Crest Holders are Awakened through use of special trials. After realising they need further power to activate the World Savers, the Gods awaken a further 9, lesser Crest Holders.<br><br>And here&#39;s the parts I&#39;m on shaky ground on, the worlds the Crest Holders venture to. In Kingdom Hearts, Sora, the main character, was capable of journeying to different worlds, such as Agrabah (Aladdin) or Neverland (Peter Pan). The worlds I&#39;ve picked, however, are Hogwarts, East High, Emelan, Paragon City, Tortall and Naruto&#39;s world.<br><br><br><br><br>In Hogwarts, set during the seventh book, the Crest Holders stumble upon Harry, Hermione and Ron, who are in the wilds. Since they&#39;re new to their powers, nothing can really happen. After convincing the Golden Trio that they are also young wizards / witches on the run, the Crest Holders join Harry and the other two long enough to help find one of the other Horcruxes, which Harry destroys.<br>It&#39;s then that they come up with the plan to attain the other Horcruxes within Hogwarts, following the plot of HP7. One by one, the Crest Holders allow themselves to be captured, and are sent to Hogwarts. Due to their magical natures, they can see the castle, while their weapons are transformed into wands for the duration of their stay on the world.<br>When Harry eventually makes his way to Hogwarts, the Crest Holders take part in the Battle of Hogwarts, but primarily deal with the Dementors, who it seems can actually be vanquished by the powers of pure, good human emotions. They do not help Harry kill Voldemort, nor do they resurrect him, or try and convince him to go into the forest. They&#39;re too busy dealing with the Dementors. Plot follows the same line as HP7, with the Light winning, the near-total elmination of the Dementors and the Hogwarts Keyhole being sealed.<br><br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ll post for now. I just wanna know if that would get a thumbs up from the PPC, or a thumbs down. You cna ignore this, or give one word answers, but any help would be appreciated.<br><br>Oh, and the Crest Holders are as follows:<br>Crest Holder of Courage) Link, from Legend of Zelda<br>Crest Holder of Friendship) Sam, OC from the Pokemon World<br>Crest Holder of Love)Kairi, from Kingdom Hearts<br>Crest Holder of Power) Sora, from Kingdom Hearts<br>Crest Holder of Knowledge) Zelda, from Legend of Zelda<br>Crest Holder of Sincerity) Mai, OC from Charmed<br>Crest Holder of Determination) Tidus, from FFX<br>Crest Holder of Hope) Matt, OC from Charmed<br>Crest Holder of Kindness) Yuna, from FFX<br>Crest Holder of Trust) Nick, OC from the Pokemon World<br><br>Should be noted that all the OCs are my own characters. If anyone wants a character profile, or an example of what the character acts like, gimma a holler.<br><br>Anywho, this is only the first part of the story. Again, ignore this if you want, I just don&#39;t wanna step on the PPC&#39;s toes, and stick to the plots as much as I can.</p>

            <p>I love crossovers!  Er, I mean, tricky situation.<br><br>The first problem&#39;s going to be fusing the fandoms.  Don&#39;t know anything about Kingdom Hearts other than the basic idea, but as far as I know that particular canon comes with its own ready-made explaination for how world-travelling works.  You&#39;ll still have to work in how the very different magical systems overlap, of course, but that should be doable.  I know it&#39;s possible, seeing as my List of Awesome Fics includes a very well done Star Wars/Rurouni Kenshin crossover-fusion and a Discworld/Silmarillion crossover, and if someone can make those work you can make this work.<br><br>The other main problem I can think of is the Trump Syndrome.  When two canons collide, it&#39;s too easy to make one entirely pwn the other.  This is a bad thing.  Somehow you&#39;ll have to make the High School Musical canon/characters as powerful and effective as the Buffy canon/characters, if not in the same way.  Good luck with that.  You said that the Crest Holders aren&#39;t going to interfere with the successes and failures of the Harry Potter group, which is a good start.<br><br>Can&#39;t really do more than point out the obvious, since most ideas rely on the writing style to make it or break.  Which means that I&#39;ll be expecting you to plug when it&#39;s up.  <s>Not because I need something for my crossover addiction, I swear!</s></p>

            <p>Okies, and I&#39;m back.<br><br>I&#39;ve hopefully already covered the fusing fandoms, with mostly using the Kingdom Hearts explanation, so that should be fine.<br>As for the magic, I&#39;ve decided to combine many different groups, and seperate others. An explanation would be this: In the Pokemon World, a small part of the populace have Psychic Powers. If one of those people went to Hogwarts, they too would have magic,only because their overall &#39;Magic Well&#39; has been tapped by the psychic powers, but can only be truly expressed with the wands and incantations. I guess I&#39;m gonna be doing it on a World by World basis.<br><br>As for the Trump Syndrome, hopefully I have worked my way around that too. In battle, Buffy and co would win, but the HSM characters would hold their own in other areas. The HSM characters are actually protected against magic for the most part by their &#39;World&#39;s Magic&#39;, an invisible force that not only protects the inhabitants of East High, but also forces them, and the people who connect to it, to burst into song and dance in moments of extreme emotion. Whoever has the World&#39;s Magic behind them is incredibly powerful, as it is essentially the power of the world that they are using in that moment.<br>For the most part, the Crest Holders won&#39;t interfere with the events, but merely influence them. There will be a part in Worlds Apart where the Crest Holders become directly involved in a war effort, specifically Emelan, after the Four escape from Namorn, where the CH protect Emelan against the armies of Namorn by having their powers &#39;Woven&#39; together by Sandry, and gain the powers of the other CH. As a result, they lose their humanity, and begin to act like Gods.<br><br>Other than that, I suppose it&#39;s all fine and good then. I&#39;ll list the specialised &#39;Crest Weapons&#39; as well, the ones capable of harming the Heartless:<br><br>Courage) Master Sword (Legend of Zelda)<br>Friendship) Nirvana (FFX)<br>Love) Papal Gloves (Own invention)<br>Power) Keyblade, but otherwise works with symbol (KH)<br>Knowledge) Book of Shadows (Charmed)<br>Sincerity) Apheteros Arrows (Own invention)<br>Determination) Martial Arts (&#39;Nuff said)<br>Hope) Faraday Shield (Own invention)<br>Kindness) Cyrus (Guns, FFX-2)<br>Trust) Bahk Nagn (Knuckle Dusters, FFX)</p>

            <p>Post Chain of Memories?  Is that post Chain of Memories, pre KHII, or post CoM <i>and</i> KHII?  If it&#39;s the former, how&#39;re they going to be travelling between worlds?  The impression I was left with was that it wouldn&#39;t really be possible to travel between the worlds after the door was sealed.  Further, pre KHII, it&#39;d seem both Sora and Kairi wouldn&#39;t really have been going anywhere.<br><br>Twelve Gods of the Universe?  How does this fit with the known cosmology of the KH-verse?<br><br>Wouldn&#39;t Disney Castle be fairly important, too?  Cornerstone of Light, Keybearer came from there…?

I wouldn&#39;t be sure everyone we met up with in the games already knew and were prepared, and guest party members seemed to do all right.  Fairly sure Beast only uses his claws, too.<br><br>I don&#39;t think I quite get what the problem is with the worlds you&#39;ve chosen.  Could you maybe explain that a little more?</p>

            <p>Post CoM, meaning that it starts where KHII should. Literally, it starts as Roxas ends, and where Sora is waking up.<br>Travel between the worlds isn&#39;t possible, because the World Walls have been reintroduced to the Universe. Within the story, I had to have the 12 Gods destroy those walls, in order to allow the Crest Holder of Friendship to have his world taken and to meet up with the other Crest Holders, as the Crest Holder of Friendship is also capable of &#39;Forging&#39; bridges between the worlds using the power of frienship. The World Highways would only be created whenever he enters new worlds, however, and as such, they need to use a Gummi Ship to get to new worlds until the CH of Friendship comes into his powers.<br><br>Within Kingdom Hearts, there&#39;s the side of the Light, and the side of Darkness. There aren&#39;t any set Gods or Deities, unless you count the ones from Olympus Coliseum. Within Worlds Apart, they are Gods for that world, and have no power over others. The 12 Big Gods were the ones who originally created the Universe, as well as the various worlds.<br><br>I&#39;m still toyingwith the idea of Disney Castle, so I&#39;ll get back to you.<br><br>The weapons are specialised in a similar way to the Keyblade. However, instead of using the direct power of the heart, each weapon uses the power of a pure emotion which has been elevated to become very dangerous to the Heartless. Again, in my story, it is set that no-one can harm the Heartless, unless the Keyblade or Crest Weapons are nearby, as power of the Keyblad e/ CW&#39;s spread to the weapons around them for a short time.<br><br>The problem is just the plots.

            <p>For the most part, it&#39;s hopefully tying it together, and finishing it off.<br>When they bring the Walls down, they&#39;re destroying all the World Walls, unfortunately. It leaves all the Worlds open to Heartless invasions, but it allows the CH to travel quickly, thus increasing the chances order will be restored. After Kingdom Hearts opens, the Worlds Walls will be restored, but because the Crest Holder of Friendship, who creates bridges between the worlds, will know how to use his power and create pathways made of Light, as opposed to the Heartless who use pathways of Darkness, that will be fine.<br><br>For the most part, I&#39;m actually using Deities who are known to people, at least, people who have played the respective video games. The Gods are:<br>Mew, Celebi and Jirachi (Pokemon)<br>Seraphimon, Ophanimon and Cherubimon (Digimon)<br>Bahamut, Shiva and Ifrit (Valefor and Ixion are Gods too, but the above three are the ones mostly seen in the story)<br>And Din, Nayru and Farore (Legend of Zelda)<br>There isn&#39;t much evidence for and against, yes. I&#39;m introducing the Gods as a way of giving the Light a face, like the Darkness has theirs in the form of Xemnas and the like. The Crest Holders never directly interact with any of the Gods, the Gods are the ones who decide a lot of the big stuff in the story though.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure about if the KH-Verse started as one world or not. There is a tale in KH1 about one world where the Darkness originated from, and such. In World Apart, the Pokemon World was the first World created, with the other worlds coming off of it. So, I suppose Worlds Apart does match up with the legend...Sorta. I&#39;ll need to clarfy that though.<br><br>Hopefully they won&#39;t overshadow, but rather enhance. I&#39;m aiming for the CH to offer assistance when it&#39;s needed, but otherwise only deal with the Heartless or Crest-related issues. Most of the time they won&#39;t specify exactly how powerful they are, nor their titles, only that they have magic, or special abilities if they&#39;re accepted in that world.<br><br>The noticablity is gonna be a problem that they&#39;ll need to deal with as well. Since there are 10 of them (Nine Major Crest Holders and One Minor), it&#39;s a huge group. They&#39;ll learn to only send a few of themselves at a time onto a world though, unless the full number is needed. Otherwise, they&#39;d stay on the Gummi Ship. If they can get away with all 10 being on the planet without notice, they will do it then.<br><br>And thanks, I&#39;ll check them out. More help is always great. And thanks again for your help.</p>

            <p>I… thought those were made, for the most part?  In FFX, at least- in other games it seems they&#39;re already known, and IV and VI both have another plane where Espers exist, though with V you could make an argument that summons can exist in their own right on the same plane as the party…<br><br>Er.  Sorry, got sidetracked.<br><br>Any particular reason for choosing those summons?<br><br>*thought Xemnas was nothingness?  Nobodies rejected by light and dark, state of indeterminacy?*<br><br>Glad to help.</p>

            <p>And no. The Fayth were &#39;Created&#39; in a way. A thousand years ago in Spira, they had Summoners, which indicates there must have been previous Fayth to Summon before Ifrit, Bahamut and the like came along.<br>I&#39;m explaining this in the story like this.<br><br>&#39;A thousand years ago, when Sin was born, Lady Yunalesca, daughter of Yevon, was given new information to create special Fayth, more powerful than any ever seen before. The rituals demanded a human sacrifce, and when it was complete, it was not the sacrifice&#39;s soul that was bound to the Fayth Stone, but the spirit of a God. It was a special branch of magic that bound them, one of their own forging, which meant they could not escape the bonds. It was simple chance that Bahamut, Valefor, Shiva, Ixion and Ifrit were the ones bound, it could easily have been Mew or Ophanimon. The events that took place in FFX was a way to free them from their bonds to that planet; when Sin was destroyed, they would be set free.&quot;<br><br>And that&#39;s the story. After they were freed, each of the Gods left behind a small copy on the planet, just in case their form would ever be needed again. It was these forms, which were far weaker than the true ones, that were possessed by Shuyin and forced to fight Yuna and the Gullwings.<br><br>Yojimbo, Anima and the Magus Sisters are a different branch as well. Since they were created using the old way of creating a Fayth, they are not counted as Universal Gods, but rather, as minor ones specifically given the duty to protect Spira. They were also taken captive by Shuyin, because they did not have the power to repel him, being Minor Gods.<br>And that&#39;s pretty much it...<br><br>Organisation XIII are the sentient bad guys of the series. Because the Crests do not like nothingness, or voids, such as Dementors, they tend to make the Crest Holder lash out at the Nobody or Dementor, and destroy them. The Crest Holders will be manipulated like Sora was by Xemnas to unleash Kingdom Hearts and give the Organisation back their hearts.<br><br>And thanks for the help! Again, it does help to get my thoughts donw in stone, and reveal areas I might be lacking in.</p>

            <p>Personally, I didn&#39;t get so deeply involved as some of you - the literal pain in my eyes kept me from reading everything - but I&#39;ve been suffering the after-effects of deliberate bad spelling ever since, not to mention the shame of giving my seven-years-younger badfic writer self a name and chance to escape the cage in back of my head.

            <p>Ahhh, peace. *shares in the chocolate* I think the worst thing for me is the way the badficcers always seem to be talking at the top of their voices. They don&#39;t even need exclamation points or capslock. Those just make it worse.<br><br>Maybe it has something to do with all of them wanting attention so badly. I think Brandy is actually fairly &quot;cool&quot; in &quot;real life,&quot; which would explain why she has no motivation to improve: No one has the nerve to tell her she&#39;s bad. But that coolness also goes hand in hand with craving that sort of attention.<br><br>I also think I have an advantage in sanity, with Brandy being a distinct character whose voice I&#39;m simply borrowing.

            <p>I don&#39;t believe she&#39;s ever named in canon - she&#39;s only mentioned a couple of times, and that&#39;s as &#39;Ramandu&#39;s daughter&#39; or &#39;the Queen&#39;. *sigh* I&#39;m predicting a response much like Thranduil&#39;s spouse for her, I&#39;m afraid.</p>

            <p>Just a physical description. This is one thing that I hope the movies flesh out a bit more - I like the Susan/Caspian ship, but if they can make Ramandu&#39;s daughter a substantial character, it&#39;d be much easier to like the canon ship as much. *sigh*</p>

            <p>... why is it that badficcers always miss the point that they had to go back to the real world for a REASON? And that the series would have lost a large part of its point if they&#39;d all stayed and lived happily ever after, and presumably made up a Shagging Caspian Roster, if everything you believe in Narniafic is true then they ALL (except possibly for Lucy) want to jump his bones and that would be the only fair way to get around it.</p>

            <p>Now, my last question was about the PPC defending fanfiction of fanfiction, which people rose to answer quite well. Now for the next question:<br><br>Is it possible, for an Agent in a particular dangerous story, to approach members of a Goodfic to help fight a Mary-Sue?<br><br>This is with the instant assumption you have been given permission by the author. To put this in an example:<br><br>&#39;Miss Mary Sue has corrupted everyone, everyone lovers her, and would rise to her defense. Your partner has just eaten some bad meat (The Cute Animal Friend makes it&#39;s final stand) and you&#39;re on the verge of passing out. Using the Portal, you open a portal into a Goodfic, where you hope the characters can help you stablise the continuum long enough to weaken the Sue, and help you defeat her.&quot;<br><br>And that is Artic&#39;s random idea. What do you guys think?</p>

            <p>Though I think the more likely solution would be to contact HQ and get another agent, a friend, to come and help instead. <br><br>That said, the biggest problem of using Goodfic characters... hang on - are we talking about canons or Goodfic OCs? Because the latter would be BRILLIANT - especially if it&#39;s a well-known goodfic. If you mean canons from a Goodfic (or simply from Canon itself), the biggest problem I see would be having two running around at once and possibly being mixed up. </p>

            <p>Canons may confuse the issue, but there are some of them who naturally resist Sue-influence, and it might be an idea to have them help you. For example, Gimli and Eowyn from LOTR, Gaspode from Discworld and Ron Weasley from Harry Potter are all noted for their anti-Sueishness.<br><br>And I don&#39;t think you can bring the characters from the Canon into the fic per se, becasue the fic is in the Canon world.

            <p>Sorry for posting again so soon, but I have a question.<br><br>I am writting a Doctor Who fanfic in which an established canon character (Ace, to be precise) became a Time Lord through some deus-ex-machina genetic tweaking and then regenerated.  Would Ace II, her new incarnation, be considered an OC or a canon?  I need to know for labelling purposes.  <br><br>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>With the Doctor, each time he regenerates, he&#39;s a new character, with a different personality.  From what I know of Romana, she&#39;s the same way.  If you made large changes to Ace&#39;s character, I&#39;d say OC.  If she&#39;s mostly the same, than canon.  <br>Personally, I&#39;d say something like &quot;AU canon&quot; or &quot;mostly canon.&quot;</p>

            <p>Sleepovers are FUN! We managed to get Prince Caspian on high-def DVD (no special features though - :( ) by snitching it from the Real World filmmakers. Agent Sedri has been staring longingly at said prince ever since, though she all but attacked Iza when caught. Dangerous. <br><br>We should gather up all the other &#39;classic&#39; girl-aww movies, too; I vote for Ever After. <br><br>I suspect the guys will crash, though; there aren&#39;t many of them on the Board and I think they&#39;ll be feeling all left out.

            <p>Hiya, everybody! *waves* It&#39;s been ages, I&#39;m afraid. And as much as I hoped I&#39;d never do this, I&#39;ve got a reason for turning up on this board after so long.<br><br>The problem is, I loved PPCing. .... Ing. Loved. It. But while I was PPCing, I was writing a novel, and now that novel is in the process of being sold. I posted the name and pieces of my novel while I was working on it, on the same LJ that I posted my PPCings. And if I want to avoid legal issues once the book is published, I can&#39;t continue sporking other peoples&#39; work.<br><br>:( I&#39;ve missed you all, guys. Board snowfights and tearing the hell out of badfic were wonderful. I met a lot of awesome people on this board, even if I haven&#39;t been able to keep up with you.<br><br>The reason I&#39;m posting here is that I need to transfer ownership of my agents, Diocletian and Suicide, as well as their minis Narnia No-Longerfled and Thiranduil. This would also mean asking their new writer to complete the unfinished first portion of the &quot;Subjugations&quot; mission, a killer in and of itself. But even if they just continue for that one mission, I&#39;d like to see the end of it. And I&#39;m hoping one of you guys can help.<br><br>The PPCings themselves are going to be transferred from my Livejournal to the website at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sixty_of_nine2138"><a href="http://www.geocities.com/sixty_of_nine2138">http://www.geocities.com/sixty_of_nine2138</a></a>. The new writer could, if they liked, take over this site, or do as they pleased with the characters and the writings.<br><br>*shakes a tin cup* Don&#39;t leave these agents homeless! Alms! Alms!</p>

            <p>...of what to do if that happens to me.  And the answer I came up with is: the Department of Intelligence.  See, if you&#39;re careful about it, as an Untangler you don&#39;t actually have to interact with the canon characters.  All you&#39;re doing is analyzing what&#39;s going on in a bad fanfic and why it&#39;s deleterious to canon. Doing just an Intelligence brief is even better: it&#39;s really like a badfic review, and there&#39;s nothing legally wrong with that.  (There&#39;s internal PPC history, too, but I think hS has kind of cornered the market on that one.) <br><br>Just out of curiosity...would someone have to be very familiar with the book Suicide is from, or just very familiar with the history of Ancient Greece? (I&#39;m the latter, not the former.)  I know Neshomeh has already offered to take care of them, but I like adding other agent cameos into my missions, and not just the &quot;pop-in-to-make-an-appearance&quot; kind.  *has been known to co-write missions with other agents*<br><br><br></p>

Its cheerful chimes were greeted with less than enthusiastic response by the occupant of the bed, one Diocletian Astreth, who opened one bleary eye, considered the clock, and then swatted it hard enough to put a crack right down the jolly hamster&#39;s jolly abdomen.<br><br>&quot;Su,&quot; Diocletian said, rolling over. &quot;It&#39;s the OTHER alarm.&quot;<br><br>This was addressed to a large hammock hung up near the roof of the small room. In it reposed two hundred and ten pounds of groaning Scythian, who had drunk far too much <i>everything</i> at the &quot;Our Writer&#39;s Retiring, We Can Finally Get Some Sleep&quot; party of the night before.<br><br>&quot;Mnrgh,&quot; was his response.<br><br>&quot;Su!&quot; Diocletian repeated.<br><br>&quot;Gnraaargh!&quot; the Scythian responded, punctuating his statement with a thrown bottle of Kahlua. Diocletian took a deep breath and silently begged forgiveness for what she was about to do.<br><br>&quot;WRITER KIDNAPPING!&quot; she screamed, putting just enough of her Sueish soprano into it for maximum pain. Suicide jerked upright in a humorous fashion and promptly bashed his head on the ceiling, which sent the bundled hammock swinging like the cocoon of a gleeful caterpillar just about to move out into his own set of wings. Indeterminate swearing drifted down to Diocletian, who was scrambling out of bed and looking wildly for a pair of non-crusty socks.<br><br>&quot;Dio, I will ----in&#39; KILL YOU,&quot; Suicide said, when he had managed to stop swinging. His face was slightly green under its heavy tan. &quot;Ugh. My mouth tastes like tin and mini-Balrog.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No time!&quot; his partner responded. Since the sock graveyard of the floor had yielded nothing usable, she clambered over the lower laundry foothills in search of the lost washing basket. It was around there somewhere, she knew. &quot;A writer&#39;s  been kidnapped. Get dressed, Su!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good,&quot; Suicide responded. <br><br>&quot;No, not good. Writers control our existence, you dolt!&quot; Diocletian yelled.<br><br>&quot;Yours, maybe. I&#39;m a published OC, thankyouverymuch.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not right now, Su--you&#39;re a fanfic character! And if a writer gets kidnapped by ravenous minis, it could throw our entire existence out of whack! Are these boots yours? They&#39;ve got something crusty and black on them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, yeah. Don&#39;t ask.&quot; Suicide was suddenly a lot more alert. &quot;Which one was it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gandalf the Beige.&quot; There was no washing basket to be found. In despair, Diocletian just shoved her sockless feet into her sneakers. <br><br>Suicide rolled over. &quot;No worries, then.&quot;<br><br>A second sneaker beaned the hungover Scythian upside the head. &quot;Care to rephrase that, soon-to-be-deleted-and-relying-on-the-charity-of-fellow-Board-members-for-continued-existence boy?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, okay, okay! What kind of minis?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mini-sloths.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, the sin?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, the animal. I think. It&#39;s hard to tell in a text-based medium.&quot;<br><br>Suicide clambered awkwardly out of his hammock, revealing a pair of official HFA boxers with the Tootsitramp crest on the hip pocket. Diocletian, not interested in starting a fight, valiantly suppressed the urge to snicker like a fangirl and instead tossed him a pair of somewhat clean jeans. (They had celebrated their supposed freedom by burning their uniforms, along with an effigy of the Sunflower Official. That would be an interesting Departmental Memo.)<br><br>&quot;Suit up, Su.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shotgun?&quot; Suicide said.<br><br>&quot;Shotgun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Needles?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Needles.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Continuum?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Check.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why didn&#39;t you repeat that one?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Too long.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um . . .&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A shirt would be nice, too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;After appearing in that tabloid, you&#39;re not allowed to have shame. Let&#39;s go!&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;d wondered if you were going to be back here or not. The Real World is kind of a slap in the face, isn&#39;t it?

I&#39;d be glad to pick up Dio and Suicide for the purpose. (I could consult with you for characterization, right?) On the other hand, I don&#39;t know how long it will be until I can get to it, or at what point (I hope) I&#39;ll find myself in your situation and simply have to quit altogether. So... consider me if no one else steps up, I guess, but only if. I still plan to do my part, though. I think it was the part after yours...?<br><br>~Neshomeh,</p>

            <p>Anything potentially litigious (such as PPCing, which falls under parody but could still be the cause of trouble from butthurt fanbrats) has to go. And no, the agent didn&#39;t lay down rules as such . . . I&#39;m taking the hint and doing it on my own. He doesn&#39;t know much about my OL activities; he&#39;s an old-fashioned pro, and probably isn&#39;t really familiar with the world of online fanfiction.<br><br>I think any work you&#39;ve done with your own OCs should be fairly kosher; that&#39;s your intellectual property.

            <p>Well, hopefully the fanbrats are and will be lazy or grown up enough not to hunt us down. It isn&#39;t as though they have a leg to stand on, really. What would the suit be, do you suppose? I don&#39;t think they could prove intent to cause emotional distress or something like that, particularly since there isn&#39;t any such intent.

            <p>It&#39;s the trouble that once you&#39;ve said &quot;these are my original characters,&quot; and those original characters are associated with an online name that also does PPCing, and then a book is publishing featuring those OCs--fanbrats can connect the dots and see a lawsuit for compensation for pain and suffering.

            <p>Nah.  A lot of professional artists do both their original work and stuff that would basically be fanart and display both; there&#39;s a lot of derivative art work that&#39;s professionally shown and sold, along side completely original stuff. <br><br>However, that doesn&#39;t really work with novels, since the two can get mixed, but from what I&#39;ve seen so long as the two are kept separated (EG, don&#39;t stick the fanfic right smack in the same place as your original work if it&#39;s prominent) it&#39;s not really troublesome (after all, regular fanfic writers who aren&#39;t published are subject to the same problems of legality as the published writers who do fanfic), but can be occasionally weird. </p>

            <p>Let them see how it feels.<br><br>I was thinking of setting up an LJ community devoted to watching for trolls on the Pit. Members pledge to send at least one report for EVERY troll that shows up, report trolls as soon as they show up (moderated comm, so we can check that the troll isn&#39;t just someone the poster has a grudge against), and everyone on the comm floods the support inbox with reports of each troll as it&#39;s reported. Would that stand a chance of working?</p>

She enjoys reading well-written fanfiction and can&#39;t stand it when other people write Mary Sues or self-inserts that make no sense in the course of Canon. She does not mind reading AUs, except when they are badly written.<br>Because of her lifestyle, she enjoys different types of genres. This can include anything from Lord of the Rings to Star Wars to Monty Python. She has also already adopted a Mini-Balrog, Haildar, who is currently living in the family oven (don&#39;t ask).<br><br>Second Agent:<br><br>Orange Plaid<br>She is the younger sister to Luana Starlight. She is 20-years-old also with dark blond hair. She has blue eyes and is about 5&#39;8&quot;. With a tendency to slack off when it comes to certain things, she is also the insane one of the pair. She also enjoys reading fanfiction with a tendency to stick to oldies but goodies. Loves to complain, loudly, about certain writers and their stories. With certain movies, she loves to MST them while watching, to the enjoyment of her sister/partner and their father, but to the annoyance of their other two sisters and mother.<br><br>They wish to join the Department of Floaters. They do not have any particular Canon they wish to join so they feel this would be the best place for them.<br><br>Here is a couple of samples of writing:<br><br>This one was written as a POV fic for a class.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1860044/1/Gimlis_Story_after_Moria"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1860044/1/Gimlis_Story_after_Moria">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1860044/1/Gimlis_Story_after_Moria</a></a><br><br>Here is my account on ff.net.
