            <p>I just found an interesting article on Cracked.com, which details the 5 Most Baffling Sex Scenes in Fanfiction History. It doesn&#39;t really go into anything graphic, otherwise my mind would have exploded, but it&#39;s an interesting read. Number 2 was quite warped for me...<br><br><a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_16554_5-most-baffling-sex-scenes-in-history-fanfiction.html"><a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_16554_5-most-baffling-sex-scenes-in-history-fanfiction.html">http://www.cracked.com/article_16554_5-most-baffling-sex-scenes-in-history-fanfiction.html</a></a><br><br>So yeah, mind-warping is to ensue.

            <p>*is very, very red* In my very first PPC mission, Agents Sedri and Iza killed a Gary Stu named <b>Geron</b> who was playing matchmaker for one major and one minor <i>Star Trek: Voyager</i> canon characters. I did my research! I ran searches for the name and searched my memory (as well as my DVDs) for a canonical &quot;Geron&quot;. There wasn&#39;t one. <br><br>Guess what? There IS a <b>Gerron</b>. I just dicovered him - <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Gerron">here</a> - while browsing. He fits the badfic description well enough that I&#39;m sure he was meant to be the same character, though this canon is &quot;reticent to the point of rudeness&quot; while the &#39;Stu&#39; was Mr Happy Innocence.<br><br>... I still killed him. Meep. <br><br>I&#39;m sincerely hoping you guys will tell me that because the Stu was constantly misspelled, he wasn&#39;t actually the canon character, but... *squeaks* The Flowers scare me.<br><br><br><br>(Also, because I don&#39;t want to double-post: I&#39;ve been trying to find out more about the shipping war between Harry/Hermione fans and... whomever they were against. I heard it got pretty bad, but I don&#39;t know the details. Can anyone help me out?)</p>

            <p>But I can help slightly with the HP. Apparently before the release of HPDH, there was a petition going around for J.K Rowling to pair Harry with Hermione, and enforcing this by threatening to boycot (sp?) the book if she did not go to their whims.<br>Even more amusing, after the seventh book was finally published, a second petition went around demanding that Rowling REWRITE the entire Book, with Harry and Hermione getting together. Around the same time, a third petition went around, demanding that the 7th book should be withdrawn and instead of Rowling publishing it, a Fanfic writer who supported the Harry/Hermione pairing, write it instead.<br>I was rather amused at that...</p>

            <p>but I can for the H/Hr wars. Basically, JKR was interviewed by two fansite owners - Melissa and Emerson, who run The LEaky Cauldron and Mugglenet respectively - and she was asked a question about shippers. JKR said something about &#39;anvil sized hints&#39; that it was gonna be Ron/Hermione rather than Harry/Hermione. On top of that, Emerson called the H/Hr shippers &#39;delusional&#39; and the H/Hr fans went batshit.<br><br>I mean, the sane ones didn&#39;t. Most H/Hr shippers, I&#39;m sure, got a bit annoyed, but didn&#39;t start writing letters to JKR and boycotting the series. But the batshit ones did, and that&#39;s why everyone thinks ALL H/Hr shippers are batshit. The main focus of the war was between H/Hr &#39;Harmonian&#39; shippers and R/Hr shippers. And, yeah. So Harmonian shippers got a bad press while the R/Hr shippers came out scot free. Fandom_Wank will have reams on it, but I&#39;m not sure of the links, and since their main purpoe is to make fun of everything, I don;t know how much you&#39;lll find.<br><br>Wow, long post is long.

            <p>So I&#39;m sure most of you guys probably know about this, but I only discovered it a few weeks ago whilst looking up Cory Doctorow online, and was blown away by the concept of it all, in practice. I mean, I&#39;ve -thought- about sites like that, but it actually EXISTS! <br><br>This is a site, just in case there&#39;s some of you guys out there who don&#39;t know, like me, where there can be found over 25,000 free e-books. They have (or at least it would seem) just about anything our twisted copyright laws will allow them! It is AWESOME. Also excellent for written projects, if the work being researched is public domain; the only drawback of that is that it&#39;s difficult to get page numbers on some of the sites... the one I use, at least.<br><br><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/"><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">http://www.gutenberg.org/</a></a><br><br>(also, the fact that they named themselves after Gutenberg makes the historian in me sqee.)<br><br>Is AWESOME.</p>

            <p>Did you know, in the Harry Potter continuum, that Godric Gryffindor, one of the Four Founders of Hogwarts, is still alive? And where is he?<br>He happens to be the giant squid in the lake. His Animagus form happens to be the largest of any living wizard. According to Rowling, he transforms at 11pm every night and takes a stroll around the grounds.<br><br>As he is known for being one of the greatest duelists in history, kinda begs the question about why he didn&#39;t participate in the Battle of Hogwarts, huh?<br></p>

            <p>It came from JKR&#39;s diary section on her home page on May 14 2007. You can find them all posted here: <a href="http://www.hp-lexicon.info/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-diary.html#13"><a href="http://www.hp-lexicon.info/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-diary.html#13">http://www.hp-lexicon.info/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-diary.html#13</a></a><br><br>But the one in question reads as such:<i><br>May 14, 2007<br><br>A couple of weeks ago (April 28th, if you want to go and search the archive) the Potter fansite The Leaky Cauldron posted an editorial on potential spoilers for &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. It made me laugh, but I was also incredibly moved and grateful.<br><br>We&#39;re a little under three months away, now, and the first distant rumblings of the weirdness that usually precedes a Harry Potter publication can be heard on the horizon. The Leaky Cauldron&#39;s early mission statement on spoilers (ie, don&#39;t, and we&#39;re not putting them up if you do) is deeply appreciated by yours truly.<br><br>I add my own plea to Melissa&#39;s for one reason, and one only: I want the readers who have, in many instances, grown up with Harry, to embark on the last adventure they will share with him without knowing where they are they going.<br><br>Some, perhaps, will read this and take the view that all publicity is good publicity, that spoilers are part of hype, and that I am trying to protect sales rather than my readership. However, spoilers won&#39;t stop people buying the book, they never have - all it will do is diminish their pleasure in the book.<br><br>There will always be sad individuals who get their kicks from ruining other people&#39;s fun, but while sites like Leaky take such an active stance against them, we may yet win. Even if the biggest secret gets out - even if somebody discovers the Giant Squid is actually the world&#39;s largest Animagus, which rises from the lake at the eleventh hour, transforms into Godric Gryffindor and... well, I wouldn&#39;t like to spoil it. </i><br><br><br>Anyways, point is, as a few of you have mentioned, it seems to have been intended as a joke. But you know how things go in the fanfiction world. I bet there&#39;s a fic out there using Godric Gryffindor = Giant squid as the formula for a cringe-worthy story.<br><br><br>--Boo</p>

            <p>&#39;It was revealed by J.K. Rowling, while making a joke, that Godric Gryffindor is still alive: he is the Giant Squid that lives in Hogwarts&#39; lake, and thus makes him the biggest Animagus in the Wizarding World. At the eleventh hour of each night; the Squid transforms back into Gryffindor, who wanders the school grounds before returning to his Squid form. This explains why the Squid, despite its dangerous-looking appearance, is kind and gentle in nature (revealed when he saved Dennis Creevey from drowning).&#39; <br><br>She did say it while joking though, so it&#39;s possible it may not be true. I&#39;ll have a look around for the interview though. I&#39;ll keep you posted.</p>

            <p>We&#39;re looking for a slightly different storyline to the usual &quot;Sues invade&quot; thing for the OFUR. I had the idea that we could bring in a dimensional rift which, instead of allowing Sues in, allows in something horrible from a fandom which does not have any fic or an OFU, therefore the characters and monsters do not know what&#39;s going on and behave exactly how they would in their canon, i.e. killing everything in sight. Would this work, or would it just confuse people who don&#39;t know the other fandom?</p>

            <p>The original versions of common fairy tales and Disney movies, for example, though it might drop the cosmic horror theme. Snow White, for example. In the fairy tale, Snow White was about 14. She was woken up from her coma by one of her children sucking on her finger and accidentally removing the splinter that made her fall into the coma. Yes, children. She had been raped and given birth twice while asleep, and when she did wake up, she immediately hunted down the good prince responsible, who had gone home to be with his wife... and in a couple of versions, she ate her kids in a rage at the end.</p>

            <p>... we were going to use <i>Jack</i> earlier, in a comedy chapter. (insanegrrl and I have already shown in missions that the Jack cast know about the Canon Protection Initiative - well, the dead ones do - and there have been shoutouts to Redwall in the canon comic - see Artie&#39;s wife being treated in Saint Ninian&#39;s Hospital - and I find the idea of a field trip in Hell to be deeply amusing.) Besides, <i>Jack</i> already has a fanfic board, though not an OFU - webcomic OFUs may not be a good idea because the original author would be looking over your shoulder all the time and things would get weird.<br><br>The one I was thinking of is purely PG-rated, but still rather darker and more gruesome than Redwall (not that Mossflower doesn&#39;t have its fair share of random deaths, but they&#39;re slightly more avoidable there). Trouble is, it&#39;s also very obscure, so it&#39;s likely that nobody reading would understand what was going on. Probably a bad idea, then.</p>

            <p>To get Audacity to export a file as an MP3, you need to download <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/help/faq?s=install&amp;i=lame-mp3"><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/help/faq?s=install&amp;i=lame-mp3">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/help/faq?s=install&amp;amp;i=lame-mp3</a></a> <br><br>then when you tell Audacity to make a file into an MP3, it will ask for that file; you tell it where you saved it, and bingo. As long as you don&#39;t move the file it will always know where to find it and will just do it for you when you click the option.<br><br>Failing that, save it as an .aup file (the standard save option) but when you email it to me, send the project_data folder that it makes *as well*. Without that folder my copy of Audacity won&#39;t open the .aup <br><br>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Whow, whoa, whoa! Put down the pointy implements. Please. I implore you.<br><br>That&#39;s better. Now, I know my little pet project Team Phoenix has kind of been grandfathered into the PPC as a fact of life. And I&#39;m not saying I want to bring in more members. (Seven&#39;s quite enough to be going on with.) However, there is <i>Project</i> Phoenix, which is separate, and dedicated to the recruitment and assimilation into the PPC of canon characters who (hopefully) won&#39;t cause a stampede.<br><br>Still with me? Good.<br><br>Because, dear colleagues, I&#39;ve been mulling over new canons to add to the PPC for quite some time.<br><br><i>Nowaitdon&#39;thurtme!</i><br><br>Steady on now...they would all be going to understaffed departments. One to Intel, one to DoSAT, and one to FicPsych. All three of them are incredibly well-qualified for these positions. (And two of them are unceremoniously murdered by a new, allegedly-canonical author, which is perhaps a blessing in disguise because it saved them from Character Assassination by aforementioned author, a fate worse than death IMO.)<br><br>For Intel, I nominate the <i>bookverse</i> Alexander Conklin, from the Bourne series, as he is a killer strategist and can hold his own in a fight if need be. (Seriously. Cane-fu.) He is also Captain Snark of the series, along with my next nominee...<br><br>...Dr. Morris Panov, candidate for FicPsych, an excellent psychiatrist with much experience with post-traumatic stress and other such lovely brain-things.<br><br>My last nominee is a mite more controversial, because she is such an important character in her canon - however, I justify this by clarifying that <i>this is an alternate-universe version of this character</i>, and there are reasons for her to join the PPC, not least of which is knowing two agents. She would not be removed from her home continuum; in fact, the one I plan on taking her from has already branched off. There are loads of other reasons, but I&#39;ll leave them to the person who will be writing this character, as she&#39;s bloody good at it.<br><br>My DoSAT nominee is Col. Samantha O&#39;Neill, originally of Stargate: SG-1 fame.<br><br>WHOA HEY PUT THAT DOWN.<br><br>Again, this is an <i>alternate-universe</i> version of her, because she has been married to Gen. Jack O&#39;Neill. Hence, you know, the different last name. She <i>may</i> change it back to Carter once within the PPC, because Jack won&#39;t be coming with her for reasons that are just way too convoluted to try and explain here (long-running insane RP being one of them). I submit that she is different enough from her canonical version to count as a separate character. Pseudocanon, if you will.<br><br>Now excuse me while I go put on my biohazard suit and hunker down in a bomb shelter...I mean, await your replies. ;D</p>

            <p>Personally, I don&#39;t feel to comfortable with this. Now I admit I haven&#39;t been around in a while, but to throw my two cents in from what I remember when I first joined, the point was to keep the canons in canon. <br><br>You could pick up Sues or Minor Characters in fan fics for agents if you wanted to, or just create someone, but canons were off limits for a variety of reasons. <br><br>One of those being Lust Object. Throwing a canon into a room full of crazed agents who may lust after them is begging for trouble. It&#39;s bad enough that the agents have to deal with their lust objects in the Fics, but to tempt them with a canonically acting canon?  It&#39;s not fair. <br><br>But this is just my two cents. <br><br>~Kips</p>

            <p>About the alternate universe characters- those of you who have played Kngihts of the Old Republic will recognize this name- I suggest one of the million and something versions of Revan running around, whether from a specific fanfic or the author&#39;s imagination.<br><br>Basically, Knights of the Old Republic is a role playing game set 4,000 years pre-Star Wars movies. If you want a more detailed explanation of the plot, you can look it up, but Revan is an ex-Sith Lord who gets captured by the Jedi, mind-wiped, and sent to defeat his/her apprentice Malak. <br><br>The canon has Revan being lightside and male, but for the alternate universe side of it, there are all sorts of weird options. You can make Revan female or a dark sider in the game, not to mention messing around with his/her assumed name, but for the purpose of being really AU, it would also be possible to give him/her his/her memories back, or somehting. Anyone else like this idea?(Please, let not the overuse of slash marks by for nothing)</p>

            <p>We need to be <b>really, really</b> careful about how we do this. There is Canonical precedent, IIRC, we&#39;ve got a copy of Voyager&#39;s Doctor working in medical (from TOS, actually). However, I would like to set some ground rules for borrowing Canonical characters (debate is welcome, of course).<br><br>First, and most importantly, we can&#39;t take characters out of the main continuity of their universe. We&#39;re here to protect the Canon, and that definitely includes the characters therein. Rescuing Wash, for instance, was rather borderline - I&#39;m willing to let it stand as Canon, (and keep Wash around), but please, don&#39;t do it again?<br><br>Effectively, this limits us to pulling characters from AUs - while I&#39;m no expert on alternate universe physics, I would suggest that the AU both has to be rather drastically different from the main Canon, and have been running for a long time - enough time and difference to (metaphysically) separate them from their Canonical counterparts.<br><br>The second rule I would suggest is that ex-Canons shouldn&#39;t be field agents. Mentioning that Sam is now working for DoSAT is fine, writing one-shots about her getting used to the job and her new co-workers is fine, stealing Luke Skywalker to kill &#39;sues with is definitely not. <br><br>Ultimately, the rule is &quot;write maturely&quot;. This is the PPC - we&#39;re a band of crazy people going crazier while fighting the growing flood of badfic. We are not an insert-your-favorite-character sitcom.<br><br>That&#39;s my take, anyways. Discussion is welcome.</p>

            <p>Looking at this thread, I&#39;d like to add that we really shouldn&#39;t be <i>looking</i> for canon characters to add. It&#39;s one thing to speculate, hey, wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if so-and-so worked here, but as Dann said, that&#39;s not what we&#39;re really about. Please resist the temptation unless there are extremely compelling reasons to go ahead with it <s>like Joss Whedon being evil</s>.<br><br>Also, along the lines of AUs being different from their canonical counterparts, it might help if they go by a different name. There is precedent for that sort of thing, after all, and it distinguishes them as separate characters.<br><br>~Neshomeh + $0.02</p>

            <p>If we&#39;re going to stick to strictly AU characters, I would suggest Future!Mohinder from the Heroes episode Five Years Gone. It&#39;s an alternate universe after the first season finale (so, therefore, it&#39;s an alternate universe that&#39;s been running for five years, and is drastically different to the main canon - as revealed by Season Three&#39;s Futures being completely different to Season One&#39;s), and he is the President&#39;s Chief Medical Advisor. Plus, it is suggested in the episode that the battle between Future!Peter and Future!Sylar kills him due to the sheer amounts of energy released. So, he would be a perfect candidate for medical.<br><br>I would also suggest Future!Hana from the same AU, as she has the power to &quot;intercept, generate and interpret electronic wireless transmissions&quot; - with her mind. She&#39;s also an ex-Mossad agent, and killed in the AU. She would be perfect for Intel or DoSAT.</p>

            <p>Specifically, that Hinder&#39;d be a perfect candidate for medical.<br><br>Item 1: he has not been revealed to have any medical training. As I shouted at the screen several times in late Season 1, he&#39;s a professor of genetics. That is a somewhat different thing.<br><br>Item 2: In the early part of Season 3, he has demonstrated a dangerous recklessness and disregard for, among other things, proper procedures and common sense, as well as an unwillingness to listen to good advice. What the specific consequences of this will be, other than what may be a calcium deficiency, remain to be seen.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s somewhat iffy to say that it&#39;s a long-running AU, considering that it was in effect from <i>Seven Minutes to Midnight</i> to <i>How to Stop An Exploding Man</i> - a present!canon time of only a few weeks. For that matter, we only saw one episode containing it.<br><br>I&#39;d also not say that the <i>first</i> Season 3 future - the one the present Future!Peter is from - is drastically different. It may be, but the scene we saw of it could fit very easily into a reasonable extrapolation thereof. The second future we saw - an unknown &quot;distance&quot; away - probably is, but... I dunno. Timelines in Heroes don&#39;t seem to be very solid.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t object as much to Hana showing up, mainly because she is qualified for the position you specify.</p>

            <p>However, I will argue that that particular AU has been eradicated because of the change of events (namely, NY not getting blasted to smithereens), and therefore Hinder&#39;d still be a good character to recruit - perhaps there&#39;s a Department of Medical Development and Sue Experimentation or something?

            <p>While I can accept your point that it is, indeed, an &quot;alternate&quot; AU (and perhaps I let my mind wander too far when I was composing that post), I still balk at the idea that it&#39;s well-established. Moreso than any other Heroes future we&#39;ve seen thus far, perhaps, but that&#39;s not really saying much.<br><br>According to the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppc_manual/Volume03.htm">PPC Manual</a>&#39;s list of departments, there is a Department of Mary-Sue Experiments, which might well be to his taste and qualifications. I don&#39;t know of any appearances by them except in DOGA&#39;s <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn3/WoodspritePart1.htm">Alumia the Woodsprite</a> mission, but if you search you might find more.</p>

            <p>The Sun Crusher won&#39;t be necessary-as I understand it, general PPC policy is to use canon weapons and technology whenever possible, and when it comes to methods of destroying things, WH40k takes a back seat to no one. If the destruction of entire non-canon star systems is necessary, I intend to lease two or three Blackstone Fortresses from Abbadon the Despoiler, Warmaster of Chaos-they can combine their energies to shatter stars, and they&#39;re powered by sacrificed souls, which should be plentiful.</p>

            <p>Muttering as he stalked down the hallways, his trusty Keyblade, adorned with even more trustworthy sausages, Agent Lunac shot glares at his partner, one Agent Liadan.<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t believe you left the cafeteria door open!&quot; He growled, mostly to himself. &quot;The Ypurs are out AGAIN, and now we have to catch them. You realise the SO is gonna chew our asses out about this, right?&quot;<br><br>Giving her partner a seemingly innocent look, one that happened to show every single one of her teeth, Liadan raised an eyebrow. &quot;Is it my fault that the Ypurs can break through magic? I put my bes tlocking charm on there.&quot; TO illustrate this, her wand, ten inches of willow, with a Mermaid scale, sparked threateningly.<br><br>Ignoring Liadan as his eyes caught movement, Lunac reached for one of the six red and white orbs located on his belt. His fingers trailed along until they reached the orb second form the end. Clicking a small button on it, making it enlarge to its usual size, Lunac threw the Pokeball. &quot;Go Apollo!&quot;<br>From within the sphere, a brst of red energy rocketed out, forming into a creature that was an odd mix between a Kangaroo and a Sheep. THe Ampharos bleated, looking at the Ypur in front of it. Having had plenty of experience with these creatures for the past month, and having more brains than most Sue Authors gave a Pokemon credit for, Apollo raised its paws and released a wave of yellow energy towards the Ypur. The Thunder Wave impacted directly, paralyzing the ram-like creature and making it fall to the ground. Giving his Pokemon a tuhmbs up, Lunac ran past Apollo, pulling out two small black devices and switched them on. Lowering a hand until it lay on the Ypur&#39;s broad back, Lunac stretched out with the psychic powers lent to him by the machines and teleported the Ypur back to the cafeteria.<br><br>&quot;One down, fifty-nine to go.&quot; Lunac murmured to himself.</p>

            <p>Agent Eledhwen was happily minding her own buisness strolling down the hallways trying to look innocent and not hurried at all. In reality, she was in a rush and needed to get back to her RC before her partner Christianne realizes that she was gone. <br><i>Don&#39;t think about RC#L0121F4114C3...</i> she reminded herself every other second. <i>Don&#39;t think about the fact that you&#39;re in a hurry.</i> She tried to calm herself down as she walked on and on in the endless hallways of gray.<br><i>THUMP. THUMP.</i><br>Eledhwen nearly jumped three feet in the air. &quot;What was that?&quot; she murmured as she looked around her wildly. <br><i>THUMP THUMP THUMPITY THUMP THUMP.</i><br>Eledhwen&#39;s hand tightened on the hilt of her sword. She looked around again, but her elven eyesight revealed nothing.<br>&quot;It&#39;s probably upstairs,&quot; the part-time Assassin told herself. &quot;Nothing special. I suppose it&#39;s just another two or more Agents getting frisky or something. Christy has often complained about our neighbors...&quot;<br>She never finished that thought because a whole herd of ram-like creatures suddenly popped out of a random plot hole, thundering down the corridor. <br>And Eledhwen was in their way.<br><br>&quot;Confusticate that elleth!&quot; snarled Christianne. &quot;She must have snuck out while I was taking my nap.&quot; The Assassin stormed out the door and down the corridor. <br>She was in such a rage (Not to mention that she was easily provoked, so a small issue like sneaking out when she was sleeping gets her positively fuming when she finds out.) that she tripped right over something on the ground. Christianne looked down, ready to shoot a stream of expletives at it. She refrained from doing so, however, when she saw who was lying on the ground. <br>It was Eledhwen. Or rather, Eledhwen run over by a bunch of stampeding Ypurs. Christianne groaned. &quot;It looks like I&#39;m going to have to lug her sorry ass over to Medical, then,&quot; she grumbled to herself as she picked up the unconscious elleth and started making her way over to Medical.   </p>

Since his recent abduction by Medical for mental reasons, he didn&#39;t see why turning all the Agents in sight into extremely attractive pseaduo-Sues was a bad thing, Arti had been bored out of his brain.<br>It had only been in the past week that he was allowed to wander around Medical, assuming he did not go near their supply of sugar, bleeprin, or sugarfied Bleeprin.<br><br>Glaring at the same wall he had been glaring for for three days, which had reduced it to a trembling pile on the ground, Arti contemplated the excitement in escaping.

            <p>Nat stomped down the hallway, Cassie and the minis trailing close behind.

As she threw a piece to Giml, she accidentally dropped one of the sausages she&#39;d been carrying to lure the Ypurs out with.<br><br>She didn&#39;t notice, but the Ypur lurking around the corner did. Greenlead, who had hung back to investigate something he&#39;d found interesting lying on the floor, growled and snapped at the blue-furred creature that scurried out to claim the sausage. On hearing the growl, Cassie turned round.<br><br>&quot;Nat! Nat, we found one!&quot; she yelled, dashing towards the Ypur which, unsurprisingly, dashed off as fast as it could. The two agents and their minis took up the chase with enthusiasm, all previous traces of Nat&#39;s earlier mood gone.</p>

Cassie, on the other hand, frowned at Sedri.<br><br>&quot;That one is ours, yeah, she replied in between gasping for breath. &quot;Look, it&#39;s still got the sausage I used to lure it in.&quot; That said luring had been wholly accidental she glossed over completely.

Between two sets of enormous armored treads, an armored hull that rises to nearly fifteen feet in height, and no less than eleven forward weapons, from the massive battle cannon on the top turret to the hull-mounted siege cannon and side turret-mounted bolters and lascannons, one standard-template Mars Pattern Baneblade has crunched into the armoury, covering the entering agents.<br><br>The enormous vehicle fires a single shell from its main cannon that fills the hallway with smoke, and a distinctly male voice shouts down from the top of the Baneblade.<br><br>&quot;That smoke shell should buy y&#39;all some time!

            <p>An explosion rings out in the corridor behind them, in the vicinity of the Ypurs, as two enigmatic figures without description or detail carefully advance down the corridor under the cover of gas grenades, and a stink of burning promethium fills the air as one of the figures triggers a flamer, covering the hall in a sheet of flame and cutting off the Ypur advance.<br><br>The other figure makes his way past the impromptu blockade and shouts an indistinct message, as no description of the figure&#39;s voice or speech has yet been made by its creator. The message itself, however, is clear-they can hold of the Ypur advance, but don&#39;t know for how long.</p>

            <p>She saw the explosion and, letting go of the two Agents she had been holding in either hand, ran back towards the featureless people. &quot;NO!&quot; she yelled, waving her arms and doing a rather good, if unintentional, impression of Captain Jack Sparrow. &quot;We&#39;re not meant to kill them!

            <p>Although there is nothing to describe their voices, the meaning of the featureless agents is clear enough somehow: they have no intention of killing the creatures. They are reasoning the creatures to be afraid of fire, and hence are barricading this passage in flame. If the creatures are not afraid of fire, they will be. The flamer can be turned off at any moment-combat promethium, burns and dies fast.</p>

            <p>Sedri translated; &quot;That&#39;s a no. I&#39;ll do it. I have an Idea.&quot;<br><br>Nat hesitated. When a PPC agent speaks In Capitals, general wisdom is to stay Far Away.<br><br>Sedri pulled a small object from her pocked and aimed towards the fire - and Cassie. First Nat thought was a gun, then jumped back as the Thing began to spurt huge quantities of water down the hall. <i>Must be plothole-driven,</i> she thought. <br><br>Iza was watching with a serene smile. Nat shook her head and watched the torrent douse every flame in the corridor. Water rushed back across the meal floor, soaking all their shoes, but the explosion was sufficiently quashed. <br><br>Nat looked at Sedri&#39;s tool. &quot;What <i>is</i> that? Some sort of deux-ex-machina you pinched from a Sue?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Close enough,&quot; said Sedri, twirling the thing like a gunslinger before offering it to Nat. &quot;Transdimensional Pocket Knife. Useful little things: I&#39;ve been giving them away like crazy to the newbies - plothole in my RC seems to be duplicating them - but no one seems very interested. I don&#39;t see why. They can&#39;t be taken on missions but there&#39;s enough to do around HQ.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If we&#39;re ever here,&quot; muttered Nat, but she had no chance to say more - Cassie was returning.<br><br>She was utterly drenched.</p>

            <p>However, the shock of being suddenly soaked from behind seemed to have silenced her, and she merely squelched back up to the others, wringing out her clothes and peering short-sightedly at them.<br><br>Tyler had managed to get out of the way of the worst of the water, and was merely damp. He seemed rather cheerful, considering the current state of affairs, and was about to say something when Cassie cut in. &quot;Er, has anyone seen my glasses?&quot;<br><br>Sedri looked rather sheepish. Nat held up the Transdimensional Pocket Knife and said, &quot;She used this thing to make all the water. I reckon your glasses got washed off in that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, d&#39;you think?&quot; Cassie replied in a heavily sarcastic tone. &quot;Well, this is just great. We have a shedload of those ypur things just down the corridor, the place is soaking and I can&#39;t see more than three feet. Any idea what we do now?&quot;<br><br>Tyler shrugged, then yelped as Sedri grabbed him. &quot;Okay, techno-boy, you can run, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er, yes-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good. Then get them to chase you towards the cafeteria.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How?&quot; Nat handed over a pack of sausages.<br><br>&quot;Wave these at them. They&#39;ll happily run after you for hours. And while you&#39;re doing that, we can try to find Cassie&#39;s glasses. Now go on!&quot; She shoved him towards the herd. Nervously, he took out a sausage and waved it at the blue creatures. They moved towards him as Iza dragged everyone else into the shelter of a doorway. After a few moments, Tyler turned round and ran. The herd followed, but as the Agent had excellent speed due to his continually having to run away from enraged Agents, he was in no danger of getting trampled.<br><br>Nat stepped back out once they were gone and splashed down the corridor. &quot;Come on, I guess we&#39;d better find Speccy&#39;s glasses.&quot; Cassie hit her. &quot;Ow, you loon, what was that for?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not deaf, you know, and I can still make out where you are, Stringbean.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t call me that-&quot; They began bickering again, ignorant of the two featureless figures standing nearby.</p>

            <p>Nat groaned. &quot;Cass, why don&#39;t you carry spares?&quot; She wasn&#39;t too concerned, having recognised Five of Seven as a Trekverse agent, though she wasn&#39;t sure what to make of Omicron. She called after the retreating Dalek, &quot;We just sent someone off to lure a bunch to the cafeteria. If you want to go give him a hand, you can, but there aren&#39;t any more around here.&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, Cassie had been squinting at the featureless people who were approaching until she heard Nat ask if about spare glasses. She rummaged through her bag of holding, which she never went anywhere without these days, and came up with a spectacles case triumphantly. &quot;Ha! Got some!&quot; She put them on and looked around at the group - three human agents, two Trekverse agents, a Dalek of some sort, and a couple of figures whose species was unknown. &quot;So? Who wants to do the introductions here?&quot;</p>

            <p>Whatever the power that plucked the strange figures out of the womb of creation, it now gave the nameless figures some description, though both were still hopelessly generic, and only if you knew the subject matter-one could be described only as an Inquisitor-male human, late twenties. The other, a Sister of Battle-female human, mid twenties, ritual scars on her face. The male steps forwards and speaks with a distinct drawl.<br><br>&quot;We are without name, for our creator has given us none. For now, you may simply call me Inquisitor, and my companion Sister. She cannot speak, for our creator has yet to decide on her syntax and accent.

            <p>Liadan slid across the floor, hitting the wall and collasping into an undignified pile.<br><br>&quot;#^%&amp;@($ Ypurs!&quot; She cried, unaware of her newfound ability to pronounce symbols in her speech. Rubbing her head, she looked up at the group of people near her. &quot;Oh great. None of you saw that.

Getting to her feet, she dusted herself off ignoring the wet patches on her uniform.<br><br>Liadan suddenly froze as she looked at the featureless beings before her. Blnking her eyes to see if they were playing tricks on her, they weren&#39;t, she shook her head. &quot;Hi, not sure who you are, but hi.&quot; Looking over at Cassie, Liadan grinned. &quot;Hiya Cassie, haven&#39;t seen you since Robecca. Good party after that, huh?&quot;<br><br>Hearing the trampling of what had to be yet another stampede of Ypurs, Liadan instantly moved into action. Raising her wand, she moved it in a sweeping motion, muttering under her breath. Where there had previously been empty air there was now a Ypur. Looking down at this one, Liadan quirked her mouth.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s the one we domesticated.&quot; She told the other Agents. &quot;So far he&#39;s been having fun acitng as transport for some of the lazier minis, but the Ypurs go off of a group mind. If one isn&#39;t running anywhere, they&#39;ll stop.&quot;<br><br>Looking up at the woman who had summoned him, the Ypur cocked his head. She was a nice woman, she smelt like sausages. A rumbling made him turn to the left. A stampede of his brethren were running at him!<br>At this point, the group mind Liadan had mentioned kicked in. The domesticated Ypur began running, keeping a considerable lead over the other Ypurs.<br><br>Watching the departing Ypur dumbly, Liadan let out a &#39;Gah!&#39;, and rubbed her temples. &quot;That didn&#39;t go as planned.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Well, that has to be all of them now, doesn&#39;t it? Tyler just lured about thirty off to the cafeteria.&quot; She shrugged and leaned against the wall. &quot;Maybe we should go down there and see if they&#39;re back.&quot;<br><br>Nat shrugged and waved at the newcomer. &quot;Okay, seeing as nobody else feels like it, I&#39;ll introduce.&quot; She nodded towards the two faceless people. &quot;They&#39;re Inquisitor and Sister, apparently. You already know me and Cass, and I think you know Sedri and Iza.&quot;<br><br>Elsewhere, Tyler was running for his life. Having thirty stampeding ypurs behind him was almost as motivating as thirty stampeding Agents. He raced through the door ahead of him and found himself in the cafeteria lobby. Sprinting for the cafeteria door, he yanked it open and threw the sausages inside before diving behind the door.<br><br>The ypurs charged through and he slammed it shut, then leaned against it, completely winded, and gasped for breath. Fortunately, he had very good lungs, and was just about recovered by the time another group came pounding towards him. Calmly opening the door, he let them run back into the cafeteria and closed it behind them before sitting down and waiting for either Lunac or Liadan to arrive.</p>

            <p>The figures emerged, plucked capriciously from the womb of a hapless writer&#39;s mind before their time. They had no distinct form, for their genesis was not yet complete, and had settled on no details concerning their appearance. They were without name, for the whim of the uncaring powers that brought them here had not yet seen fit to grant them such. Indeed, so hazy and ill-formed were they that they were little more than figures of mist, animated only by the brightly burning spark of the idea in each, a spark that burned in the smoke that formed them. Even their voices were little more than indistinct whispers, though one seemed to have affected a French accent and a feminine tone, while the other was just as clearly male, and bore a drawl distinctive to those who knew of the planet Catachan-or alternatively, the mythical land known as Texas.<br><br>But these figures were not to be dismissed, for what their creator had not yet granted them in description, he had gifted them in firepower. While some of their weapons were little more than indistinct haze themselves, others were not...<br><br>Two Ypurs immediately fell to the neural shredders on loan from the Callidus Temple, mental activity hopelessly scrambled by the arcane weaponry, while a third barely dove out of the way of a hail of fire from the needle pistol one of the mist-shrouded figures bore. <br><br>It didn&#39;t help. A psyk-out grenade bounced around the corner, courtesy of an expert throw by one of the figures, despite the fact that it had no solid hands to speak of. The Ypur never awoke, silenced by the point-blank blast from the neuro shredder that followed as the unborn figures silently moved down the corridor, so indistinct that they barely seemed to register at all to the naked eye, save for that burning heart of the idea within...<br><br>Three had been cut down. There would be more to come. The figures shared what might have been a smile, had they faces to smile with, and continued down the corridor, shredders level.</p>

            <p>Ansela ducked behind a half-open door, out of sight of the Ypurs stampeding through the cross section ahead of her. She didn&#39;t like the things, therefore she didn&#39;t even want to look at them.<br><br>&quot;Stop hiding, Ansela, and help me out here,&quot; Risa resisted the urge to roll her eyes as she watched the Ypurs. &quot;I cannot handle this number of these creatures by myself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I ain&#39;t coming out and you can&#39;t make me,&quot; Ansela scowled and reached for her zat, knowing the Shinigami could quite easily drop her in the middle of the Ypurs without being harmed herself if she wanted to. Activating the energy weapon, which looked rather like a stylised snake, she went to stand by her partner. &quot;Can I kill just one of them?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We do not yet know what the consequences for killing one of these creatures are,&quot; Risa snapped, her eyes closed as she concentrating on focusing her energy.<br><br>&quot;Whatever,&quot; Ansela&#39;s hand snapped up and squeezed the trigger of her zat, blue energy bolts arcing out and striking the Ypurs. Any that were hit collapsed instantly, knocked out by the Goa&#39;uld stun weapon.<br><br>&quot;<i>Geki!</i>&quot; Risa yelled, thrusting her palm forwards at the Ypurs. Several of them stopped, paralysed by the red light that engulfed them. <br><br>&quot;W00t, we got them!&quot; Ansela did a victory dance, waving her zat above her head madly. Suddenly Risa shoved her backwards, barely pulling her out of the way of an enraged Ypur.<br><br>&quot;Do not celebrate until they are all unconscious or restrained,&quot; Risa barked, before spinning round to face the dozen Ypurs that were still standing. &quot;<i>Geki!</i>&quot; Three more Ypurs were restrained by the paralysing red light. &quot;<i>Rikujōkōrō!</i>&quot; One more was caught by six rods of light, which crashed into it from all directions. &quot;<i>Sajō sabaku!</i>&quot; A thick chain wrapped around two of the Ypurs, binding them together from head to tail and preventing them from moving. &quot;<i>Hyapporankan!</i>&quot; A spear of light formed in her hand, which multiplied into a hundred when she threw it, driving the rest of the Ypurs back and impaling the limbs of two of them. Ansela&#39;s zat hummed four more times, knocking out the last four Ypurs and preventing them from breaking down the wall of glowing spears.<br><br>&quot;You the gal, Risa,&quot; Ansela grabbed her partner and pulled her into a kiss, a wicked grin on her face. &quot;Ansela and Risa 1, Ypurs 0.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We should call Agent Lunac to return these to their proper place. He should be pleased to find that his burden has been lessened by seventeen escaped Ypurs.&quot;</p>

            <p>Risa pulled a small black butterfly with purple markings from somewhere within her shihakushou and cupped it within her hands. After whispering something to it she released the insect, allowing it to fly off in search of Agent Lunac.<br><br>&quot;Um, Risa, how&#39;s Lunac meant to know how to take a Hell Butterfly message?&quot; Ansela asked, sitting on one of the unconscious Ypurs.<br><br>&quot;If you can figure it out then so can he,&quot; Risa ignored Ansela&#39;s indignant sputtering and leaned against the wall, unwilling to use one of the blue creatures as a seat and risk getting fur all over her black clothing.</p>

            <p>Looking around the endless hallways that made up HQ, Lunac began muttering to himself again. He and Liadan had become seperated somewhere around the DoDAEG when a stampede of ten Ypurs seperated them. Liadan had fallen down an inconveniently placed trapdoor that sprouted from under here, while Lunac, used to the HQ making trapdoors appear in his presense, simply rolled his eyes. Calling out the rest of his Pokemon team, he had made quick work of seven of the ten Ypurs while the other three got away. From the crunching noise and resultant squeals of indignation, Lunac assumed the Ypurs hadn&#39;t bothered turning when they got to a wall.<br>After teleporting the knocked out Ypurs, one of which was still being poked by his Blissey, Lunac eyed his Pokemon crew. &quot;Ok guys, the Ypurs have gotten out, as you may have guessed. Hestia,&quot; He Blissey perked up at the sound of her name.&quot; If you find any injured Agents, you can heal them. Otherwise, stick to the Egg Bombs and Doubleslapping. The rest of you, we want unconcious, not dead.&quot; A fluttering on his shoulder made him look left. A small black and purple butterfly stood there, looking up at him intently. Blinking at it, Lunac arched an eyebrow, wondering where it had come from. Taking their &#39;Valient&#39; leader&#39;s sudden silence as permission to go, the Pokemon headed off down different corridors. Lunac sincerly hoped no other Agents would attack; if they did they would soon be slapped, burnt, blinded or several other handy effects his Pokemon had.<br><br>&quot;So, uh.&quot; He looked at the Butterfly. &quot;You live around here?&quot; If the bug could snort, he was sure it would have done so then. As it was, it flickered its wings again, before a jolt of pain shot through Lunac&#39;s head. A telepathic message, albeit not by a method he was used to. Lowering his mental guards, he could hear a voice talking to him.<br><br>&quot;Reporting seventeen Ypurs down.&quot; THat was Risa&#39;s voice, he knew it now that he could hear it properly. Accompanying the messages was a mental image of a hallway, it must be where Risa and Ansela were.<br>Giving a sigh, Lunac looked back down at the Butterfly. It seemed quite comfortable now that it&#39;s message had been passed on. Pulling out the two, black devices again, Lunac turned them up again, mentally searching until he could find Risa&#39;s mental energies.<br><br>&#39;Risa, it&#39;s Agent Lunac. I got your message from the butterfly thing. Are you good to secure the Ypurs, or do you want me over there?&#39; It was his own branch of telepathy, imported straight form the Pokemon World. He found it much easier to deal with than butterflies, which was plain odd.</p>

            <p>Risa mentally jumped when Lunac&#39;s voice echoed through her head, not anticipating the telepathic message. Realising what was happening, she concentrated on sending a reply back.<br><br>&#39;Agent Lunac, I would appreciate some warning next time. I hear that having your mind shredded by a defensive zanpakuto spirit is a very unpleasant experience,&quot; she added an image of Dokuha&#39;s snake form poised to strike with fangs dripping venom. &quot;And to answer your question, of course your presence here is required. If Ansela and myself were capable of dealing with these beasts further I would not have sent a Hell Butterfly, my last one might I add, to locate you. I would appreciate it if you would bring my Butterfly back in one piece as well.&quot;<br><br>Risa opened her eyes and sighed as she spotted the two Ypurs injured by her <i>hyapporankan</i>. &#39;If you could also bring some form of medical assistance for the Ypurs that I was forced to injure, I believe that the beasts would appreciate it.&#39;</p>

            <p>Resisting the urge to cover his eyes or rub his temple, Lunac settled for simply shaking his head. &#39;Ok, I&#39;m on my way. I&#39;ll just grab my Blissey and we&#39;ll be right over. Oh, and having my brain shredded by a Butterfly is not oly painful, but quite humiliating.&#39;<br><br>Spreading out with his powers again, and feeling the weariness that came when he was doing too much, Lunac sighed. Connecting with his Pokemon, he asked her to head to the Cafeteria, interuppting her action of slapping a Ypur into the next century.<br><br>&#39;We&#39;re on our way.&#39; Lunac sent, before cutting off the connection. Looking around, Lunac shrugged, closed his eyes and spun around on the spot. Opening his eyes again, and taking a dizzy step forward, and turned a corner to find Risa and Ansela.<br>Lunac&#39;s eyes flashed over the pile of Ypurs. Giving the two Agents a grin, he knelt next to the bovines. &quot;Sorry if I was short, I&#39;m kinda tired, for obvious reasons.&quot; He told Risa. Narrowing his eyes, he glared at the ile of Ypurs, and with a &#39;Pop&#39;, they disappeared into the cafeteria. A spell of dizziness fell over Lunac and he fell down onto his backside, clutching his head. &quot;Wow that does not feel good.&quot; He murmured. On his arm, one of the machines beeped rapidly, before sparking and dying. Glaring at it between his fingers, Lunac groaned. <br></p>

            <p>&quot;Foolish child. Do not kill yourself through exhaustion and overwork,&quot; Risa knelt down next to Lunac and looked him in the eye. &quot;I suggest that you take some time to rest and regain energy before you attempt any more of your teleportations, or I will restrain you myself.&quot;<br><br>Standing up, Risa brushed off her shihakusho and resettled her zanpakuto on her hip. &quot;Dokuha would like an apology from you. He, like many snakes, is rather prideful and does not appreciate you confusing him for a Hell Butterfly.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What Risa&#39;s trying to say,&quot; Ansela leaned on her partner&#39;s shoulder and grinned at Lunac, &quot;is that Dokuha is her zanpakuto, and is giving her a headache right now with his whining. Hissing. Whatever. Say, you wanna come to our RC? I&#39;m sure I have some Super Restore or Magic Potions or Wizard Mind Bombs lying around there that might help you out.

            <p>&quot;STU-PE-FY!&quot; said Omicron, and nailed an Ypur with a stun blast.  The Ypur photo-negatived and collapsed, out like a light.<br><br>Tawaki and Dustin were on their way to the mail room when they ran across four Ypurs.  Tawaki cursed in Romulan and sent a message to the DIA.<br>&quot;Here we go again,&quot; sighed Dustin.<br><br>Tawaki drew his DL-44, set to stun.  Dustin pulled out a pencil-sized device called a Sonic Smiter, recently confiscated from a Forgotten Realms/Doctor Who crossover that shipped Drizzt with Rose.  Dustin pointed it at an Ypur and activated it.  There came a noise not unlike Sue-squealing, and an Ypur went down.  A blast of expanding blue rings from Tawaki&#39;s blaster and another went down.  K-9 took the other two down.</p>

            <p>Thanks, everyone!  And to anyone who is still thinking of volunteering...it&#39;s not too late!  <br><br>What I&#39;m thinking of is dividing this mission up into four parts: one part for every episode of the miniseries.  For those of you who haven&#39;t see Lost in Austen, you can go onto Wikipedia and figure out where the episodes begin and end from the plot summary there. Then, simply choose your (least) favorite episode and e-mail me *points above*. That way, the poor agents will get some relief from the badfic. Don&#39;t worry...you can all be present for the no doubt gruesome ending of Amanda Price (though I haven&#39;t decided what that will be, yet. Red-hot shoes are <i>very</i> tempting). <br><br>Thanks for volunteering!</p>

            <p>I got through the first episode thanks to you-bloody-tube and that was MORE than enough. I mean, if Jane was so vulnerable as to nearly DIE from the cold, would Mrs Bennet have sent her out the first time? *strangles*<br><br>Admittedly, I didn&#39;t hate the Sue character too much. Amanda, I think her name was. She wasn&#39;t infuriating; it was all the things the scriptwriters did FOR her that was worst.

            <p>The &quot;saga&quot; begins: &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged that we are all longing to escape.&quot;<br><br>Cue our Sue, Amanda Price, angsting about how terrible her life is.  She undergoes such harrowing difficulties as dealing with difficult customers as a bank teller and having her boyfriend propose to her when he&#39;s drunk. Angst angst angst, and the only joy she has in her life is reading her beloved Pride and Prejudice. <br><br>Then, one  a<s>s</s>uspicious day, she finds Elizabeth Bennet in her bathroom. It seem that Amanda Price is &quot;the key&quot;: the only one in the entire universe who can make her bathroom wall into a door that opens into another world. Elizabeth Bennet, who doesn&#39;t display any shock at going into the modern world or misgivings about leaving all her family and friends, immediately proposes trading places with our dear Amanda.  Oh, and as for Elizabeth&#39;s witty lines? She doesn&#39;t have them. At all.<br><br>Soooo, just as Mr. Bingley arrives in town, so does Amanda Price.  Her well-rehearsed and rock-solid story is that she is Elizabeth&#39;s friend from Hammersmith who no one has ever heard of before. Not only does this mean the Bennets let her stay in their house for free and treat her as one of the family...but in every scene thereafter, whenever Amanda does something explicable (for instance, shouting out &quot;Bumface!&quot; at Lady Catherine&#39;s table), she explains it away to oblivious canon characters as &quot;it&#39;s an expression from Hammersmith&quot;.<br><br>But I digress. <br><br>The next day, Amanda wakes up to Lydia copping a feel in her sleep, so Amanda believes she&#39;s on reality TV. To get out of the &quot;show&quot;, she asks if she has to flash Lydia to get sent home. No one answers her, but she does it anyway. Is Lydia shocked? Horrified? No, she gives a little half-giggle as if, after all, these things happen.<br><br>Amanda, as you may imagine, is an instant hit with Mr. Bennet. She seems to him to be a girl of common sense, which is patently impossible because Amanda keeps spouting off anachronisms and 21st century jargon at every turn.  She doesn&#39;t know how to dance, she uses peculiar expressions, she curses frequently, later on calling Mrs. Bennet a &quot;ball-breaker&quot; and Mr. Collins a &quot;minger&quot;. In fact, I wonder...I seriously wonder...why she is not shipped off to Bedlam directly.  Wouldn&#39;t that be fun!<br><br>Amanda meets Mr. Bingley, who is lovestruck practically at first sight, despite the fact that Amanda is still in her modern clothing. Yep, leather jacket, low-cut blouse and jeans...a paragon of 19th century beauty. Bingley steadily ignores Jane at the Netherfield Ball, which leads Mrs. Bennet to take Amanda into a private corner and make covert, subtle threats against her. But wait. Mrs. Bennet, covert? Subtle? <i>Intelligent?</i> Yep, the CADS are sounding like bugles.<br><br> Poor Jane is left in the dust, and Amanda feels a pang of guilt, so instead of dancing with Bingley, she dances with Darcy. Darcy is suitably put out. Mary Sue makes a puny attempt to fit in by wearing a dress, but for some reason no one comments on the fact that Amanda has unbound hair and has on heavy make-up, like a lady of ill repute. <br><br>Amanda, when insulted by Darcy, goes out for a smoke.  Bingley catches up to her and says, admiringly, &quot;You even breathe fire!&quot; as she lights up a cigarette. He starts to profess his affection, Amanda kisses him deeply, but then makes a half-hearted attempt at telling him that he should be with Jane instead.  After the ball, Amanda virtually forces Bingley to fall for Jane, telling Bingley that Amanda can&#39;t love him because she&#39;s a lesbian. Bingley is shocked and appalled…oh, wait, that would be canon…Bingley is mildly surprised, but docilely agrees to fall for Jane. (Jane almost dies of her cold when she rides to Netherfield, in contrast to canon.)<br><br>In the background, Wickham shows up and tries to charm her, Amanda rebuffs him with the kind of righteous indignation that can only come from having read Pride and Prejudice ahead of time and knowing who&#39;s the villain. Collins shows up and is promptly bowled over by Amanda&#39;s…um…Amanda&#39;s…to be honest, I&#39;m not sure what he thinks he&#39;s doing. In canon, he&#39;s obsessed with propriety and with his own superficial virtue.  Amanda has neither.  But I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter, because Mr. Collins is a pervert in this version of P&amp;P. Regardless, Mr. Collins flirts with her, she agrees to marry him in order to stop Jane from having to marry Collins (Lizzy, upon whom he should be fixing his attentions, is still &quot;out of town at Hammersmith&quot;.) However, Collins drops her after Wickham spreads a rumor that Amanda&#39;s father is a fishmonger.  It looks like a hopeful sign that Amanda may be facing the consequences of her actions. But don&#39;t worry; she won&#39;t take responsibility.  She&#39;ll just knee Collins in the balls instead! Sadly, the author&#39;s Suefluence causes Mr. Collins to propose to Jane shortly thereafter…and Jane accepts him.<br><br>Turns out Darcy has persuaded Bingley away from pursuing Jane, which Amanda finds out and calls him a &quot;tit&quot; and some other things, too, if I remember correctly. Darcy gives her a well-deserved tongue-lashing for a few glorious seconds, and Sue flounces off to cry about how everything&#39;s gone wrong.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t stand watching all of the episodes, but at some point the following happens: Bingley turns into a drunkard and runs off with Lydia.  He returns to Longbourne, where he assures Mr. Bennet that he didn&#39;t actually have sex with Lydia. He does this using such vulgar language (Bingley. Vulgar and coarse in speech. And running off with fifteen-year-old girls. Just like in the books!) that Mr. Bennet challenges Bingley to a duel…in the drawing room.  Ignoring any proper dueling rules, Mr. Bennet attacks, forcing Bingley to wound Mr. Bennet out of self-defense.  (If you want a real laugh, look at how this &quot;sword fight&quot; is choreographed!  Bwah!) Mr. Bennet is bleeding heavily and sure to die, when...dun dun dun!  It&#39;s Sue to the rescue, with her modern ways of knowing about <i>stitches</i>! <br><br>I swear, I&#39;m not making this up. Shame on whoever did. By the way, Lydia is never heard from again, so it&#39;s not exactly clear how, or if, that scandal was resolved.<br><br>After saving Mr. Bennet&#39;s life (she&#39;s a hero, now, see? See?!) , Amanda meets Lady Catherine when she goes to see Jane at Mr. Collins&#39;s parsonage. (Fortunately for Jane, Mr. Collins is undergoing a period of abstinence for some obscure religious reason.) It is there that we learn that, despite having loathed Amanda and held her in contempt before, Darcy is actually violently in love with Amanda!  As with Bingley&#39;s amorous attentions, Amanda makes a few weak protests towards Darcy, all the while gazing at him with limpid, tear-filled eyes. Darcy returns this with a gaze that I&#39;m sure is supposed to be smoldering but looks instead like he is having a rather bad hangover. He doesn&#39;t really give a good reason why, with so little contact, with no exchange of witty repartee, with no respect for her personally, he loves her.  In fact, in a later episode he admits that he does not find either her simpering or her obscenities attractive!  This is supposed to be the woman he chooses to be the Mistress of Pemberley, sister to Georgiana, mother of the heirs to the Darcy line?  In any event, Amanda reacts to this news in a typically fangirl way: by forcing Darcy to dive into Pemberley&#39;s pond and emerge with his shirt dripping wet.<br><br>I&#39;m still not making this up.<br><br>Canon, which is now in a coma and on life support, gives one last gasp in the form of Amanda returning to her own world.  Darcy follows, Amanda is reunited with her boyfriend, who says sweet things to her, and Darcy meets Elizabeth for the first time. Except it&#39;s not really Elizabeth; it&#39;s the soft-spoken, tepid, dull Out of Character Elizabeth, who has cropped her hair short, wears pants, and is working in the modern world as a nanny.<br><br>Yes, a nanny. <br><br>Okay, so it hasn&#39;t gone totally wrong. Darcy and Elizabeth will meet, fall in love, Amanda will go back to her boyfriend…<br><br>Nope. Amanda drags Elizabeth back through the door because Mr. Bennet is still unwell.  Elizabeth seems very reluctant to go, even though her father was almost mortally wounded! Amanda&#39;s boyfriend tells her that if she goes back through that door, he&#39;s leaving her.  So, she does. And…he leaves. And we never hear from him again.<br><br> Darcy and Elizabeth don&#39;t hit it off, and Elizabeth wants to go back to &quot;Hammersmith&quot; and spend the rest of her life there.  So she does.  Guess life as a nanny in London is a LOT better than being happily married, rich, and living in your own time!<br><br>(Elizabeth is not the only one put on a bus, metaphorically speaking.  Elizabeth&#39;s best friend Charlotte Lucas, bereft of Mr. Collins whom she otherwise would have married, decides to go to Africa and be a missionary.  And she is never heard from again.)<br><br>Lady Catherine DeBourgh goes to Amanda and makes her promise that Amanda will leave Darcy alone forever. Well, Amanda promises. It&#39;s a lie, of course. But in exchange for that favor, Lady Catherine gets the marriage between Jane and Mr. Collins annulled.  Right on cue (was he waiting in the shrubbery?) Mr. Bingley shows up and proposes to Jane.  Jane responds that it would be a disgrace if they were to marry now, so Mr. Bingley tells her they will go to America, &quot;be married by liberal Episcopalians, have twenty-five children, and name all of them Amanda…even the boys!&quot;  And they are never heard from again.<br><br>Lady Catherine and Miss Bingley drive off together in a snit, Miss Bingley making a pass a Wickham  along the way.  And they are never heard from again.<br><br>Meanwhile, Amanda somehow travels all the way to Pemberley (In Mr. Bennet&#39;s carriage?!  By herself?!), meets up with Mr. Darcy, and they each profess their undying love.  Darcy has tears in his eyes as he tells Amanda what an awful person he has been and how sorry he is.  Then, the music swells and they engage in a very unromantic smooching session. Darcy now looks like he is drunk <i>and</i> has a hangover at the same time. Note to whoever that actor was: you, Sir, do not know how to brood. Please stop trying. It&#39;s embarrassing to watch you. <br><br>And thus it ends.  <br><br>Kitty what? Mary who? They have maybe three lines apiece in the entire thing.  Colonel Fitzwilliam, Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, Sir William Lucas, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, Anne DeBourgh and anyone else I haven&#39;t mentioned here vanished into Fanfic Oblivion for the duration of this farce.  <br><br>Scary, isn&#39;t it? But there it is.</p>

            <p>For a crime this heinous, we should come up with an equally painful finish.<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, the Canon has suffered enough. So, let the Canon be the one to inflict the punishment.<br><br>Firstly, we have a Chosen!Sue. For this, the Sue must be made to face another Chosen One.

I&#39;m sure Father Time and assortment of other Time Deities would each like to &#39;Bless&#39; her with their own Gifts, ala Pandora&#39;s Box style.

I&#39;m sure many of us here would remember Tara? The imfamous Harry Potter Sue who not only angst&#39;d in general, but had &#39;Blue eyes brimming with limpid tears&#39;? Well, I know Tara is probably still Angsting about Harry ad Draco, ahem, sorry, Vampire and Draco not getting together, so we place this Sue in with Tara and wait until she is Angsted to the death!<br>Or, if that takes too long, we can throw her in with the Ypurs...<br><br>Anywho, that&#39;s my idea.

            <p><i>(especially as the first line of P&amp;P is a false truth)</i><br><br>Yes, it&#39;s intentionally false: she is mocking people who think that any single man in possession of a large fortune must be in want of a wife.

            <p>Quite frankly, I don&#39;t understand the point of that fanfic at all. I had the joy of writing a ten-page research paper on P&amp;P for a class last semester, analyzing what I felt the author was trying to accomplish, and LiA threw it all out the window. It&#39;s not even badslash or wish fulfillment, near as I can tell-unless the fanfic author knew nothing of the time period, living in nineteenth century England would not be remotely considered wish fulfillment.<br><br>I confess that I&#39;m not as inclined towards violence as some of y&#39;all with this one-it&#39;s really not worthy of any animosity from me. It has no redeeming values, but no especially damning traits either, beyond the usual laundry list of canon rape, character derailment, etc.</p>

            <p>Hey there, newb here.  It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve been interested in badfic (especially ever since the fabulous <a href="http://ficbitches.livejournal.com">FicBitches</a> fell into inactivity) so imagine my delight that there was a yet active badfic sporking community.<br><br>I came across PPC not long ago when, on a whim, <a href="http://raane.livejournal.com/21966.html">a friend of mine Googled</a> a gem of amalgamated bad!yaoific we&#39;d written once upon a time called &quot;Immortality in Fickle Affection,&quot; which was listed among the unclaimed badfic on the PPC wiki.  Intrigued, I decided to see what the PPC&#39;s modus operandi involved, and liked what I saw.<br><br><i>Anyway</i>, the long and short of it is that I&#39;m interested in claiming &quot;Immortality in Fickle Affection&quot; for myself, as it looks like no one&#39;s taken up that cause yet (*sadface*).  Being one of the writers on the original fic though, I see where this could just lead to a conflict of interests--and far be it from me to harsh anyone&#39;s buzz if someone else had their sights on this one.  If not, sweet.<br><br>Thing is, I don&#39;t really know that this fic is capable of (or meant for) fixing in the usual PPC style when the very body of the text is grounded firmly in the &quot;hey, it would be kind of awesome and ...ed up if this happened next!&quot; school of thought.  A mess of genital mutilation and yaoific conventions from start to finish.  <br><br>So I was thinking, what if by way of &quot;fixing&quot; this fic, I went in and provided direct context for every line/event/bit of characterization seen in it?  The writing process of &quot;Immortality in Fickle Affection&quot; was passing it between Tekki and myself to try and get the other to laugh, and those lulz were generally based on exaggerated observations of the characterization and badfic tropes of 4+ years ago.  Of course, this would also be explaining the jokes, and that always makes things less funny.  (Of course, when the decision was made to upload it to the internet, my assumption was that the sheer ridiculousness of the text would speak for itself, but it appeared--with exceptions--not to be the case.)  Thoughts?  I could, instead, attempt a more by-the-book PPC fixing solution, but something tells me that it would involve a complete renovation that would render it unrecognizable.<br><br>Or if you&#39;d just rather I not touch it and leave someone else to make with the funny on &quot;Immortality&quot;, I can do that too.  I defer to the hivemind.</p>

            <p>Trust me, you&#39;ll need it. Welcome to the PPC!<br><br>Now, let&#39;s take a looky here. You wrote that story, huh? Well, I know everyone on the PPC has a story they&#39;re ashamed of. I myself have hidden mine in the Land of the Gods, guarded by the Dragons of Eternity across the River of Lost Souls.<br>Anyways, it&#39;s really up to you. Firstly, you need ot gian permission to write in the PPC Universe, however. We do have a time-period for that, about a month of active participation on either of the Boards, and then one of our handy-dandy Permission Givers should give you the ok.<br><br>ANd it&#39;s really up to you about how you PPC. You could MST your story, PPC it, Reference it, dress it in drag and force it to do the hula (I support that one!), it&#39;s really up to you.<br><br>Anyways, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got. Be careful, there are a few marbles rolling around here. We don&#39;t talk about them, simply bow to them in respect and shuffle them on.</p>

            <p>*laughs*  Strangely, not ashamed at all!  (It is my opinion that it&#39;s still funny as hell.)  Though I do wish the ridiculousness of the text had spoken clearly enough for itself, but I suppose what it <i>needed</i> was giant, flashing text scrolling across the top going <b>WARNING: FACETIOUSNESS AHEAD</b>, so in some way I suppose I&#39;m hoping to rectify that here.  <br><br>Forgive the rampant noobery--which of the &quot;other&quot; Boards would you be referring to?

            <p>This one is mostly meant for RPing and the occasional refuge when we get a Spambot attack. The other Board, which is the main message board that everyone goes to, can be found here:<br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/Indices/199610.html#176176"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/Indices/199610.html#176176">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/Indices/199610.html#176176</a></a><br><br>And to apply for permission to write in the PPC, again, wait about a month, and then ask. Nothing too complex, but we do like to know who we&#39;re stealing the Bleeprin from on the occasion. You know about the various Bleep products, right?</p>

If not, sweet!  Thing is, I don&#39;t really know that this fic is capable of (or meant for) fixing in the usual PPC style when the very body of the text is grounded firmly in the &quot;hey, it would be kind of awesome and ...ed up if this happened next!&quot; school of thought.

The writing process of &quot;Immortality in Fickle Affection&quot; was passing it between Tekki and myself to try and get the other to laugh, and those lulz were generally based on exaggerated observations of the characterization and badfic tropes of 4+ years ago. Of course, this would also be explaining the jokes, and that always makes things less funny. (Of course, when the decision was made to upload it to the internet, my assumption was that the sheer ridiculousness of the text would speak for itself, but it appeared--with exceptions--not to be the case.) Thoughts? I could, instead, attempt a more by-the-book PPC fixing solution, but something tells me that it would involve a complete renovation that would render it unrecognizable.<br><br>Or if you&#39;d just rather I not touch it and leave someone else to make with the funny on &quot;Immortality&quot;, I can do that too.

            <p>Greetings, hail and well met, and other such phrases!<br><br>As a newbie, I gift thee with a bag of pebbles and a Random Shiny Object!<br><br>Now, I believe you&#39;re enquiring about fic claimage? I don&#39;t know whether anyone else has gven you this advice, but I&#39;ll say it anyway. When it comes to writing missions and whatnot, the general consensus is that you should hang around the Board for a month or so, chatting and letting everyone get used to you and your style. During that time, most people tend to work on creating and developing their Agents.<br><br>At the end of that month, you post a message for the Permission Givers, asking for Permission to write missions. In that post you should include a writing sample or link thereto, a description of your Agents, and possibly a link to the fic you intend to tackle.<br><br>*deep breath* Now that&#39;s over with, I&#39;d like to welcome you to the Board. Other people should be along shortly to give out presents and advice.<br><br>If anyone links you to something called C*l*br**n, That Series, or anything else labelled Legendary Badfic, for the sake of your brain DO NOT READ IT. They&#39;re Legendary for a reason. If you&#39;ve already seen them, however, feel free to disregard this friendly warning.<br><br>Lovely to have you here!</p>

            <p>The Division of More Dakka authorizes that kind of wargear on a case-by-case basis only. Besides, Blaziken is a Fire-type, so the inferno pistol&#39;s strength would be halved. I suggest requisitioning a tremor cannon from the currently unreleased Space Marine Codex and employing Blaziken&#39;s ground weakness.</p>

            <p>I think there are a few agents around that first started by PPCing one of their own fics. So there is precendence on that.<br><br>I&#39;m a little confussed as about your intentions with the fic mission wise. Most of the PPC agents go into a fic point out what is wrong, some add how it could have been right, charge the offending parties, execute them and go home. You seem to have more of a tour guide idea. Not sure why you&#39;d need the PPC for that.<br><br>Unless the Flowers have decided to branch out and offer tourist trips (compare those tourists that went into space).</p>

            <p>... that while not particularly suited for a PPC <i>mission</i>, your idea looks ideal for PPC <i>training</i>. The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Operations">Department of Operations</a> is in charge of things like the Nursery, and so is probably officially supposed to run training of Agents, too. If you want to adapt this idea into a training exercise for new recruits -- a guided tour through the mind of a badficcer, as it were -- I would consider that an interesting expansion on a previously under-explored area of the PPC. Of course, first you&#39;d need to explain why the Nightshade has suddenly started training properly...<br><br>(Qualification: this message does not constitute official Permission.

At this point, I have most of it planned out, but there are some changes and things that I wanna run by other people to ensure I&#39;m not creating &#39;Sues, God!Sues or anything like that. The story is an epic crossover, which goes into several genres. If you don&#39;t wanna be an &#39;Idea Bouncer&#39; for the entire thing, then it&#39;s ok if you wanna help with a particular section.<br>Involved in the cross over are the following continuums:<br><br>Spira - Final Fantasy X / X-2<br>Hogwarts - Harry Potter Series<br>East High - High School Musical<br><br>For the most part, I just wanna leave a majority of the storyline intact. If you wanna offer, give me a yell, and I&#39;ll write up an explanation. I&#39;ve been planning this for about three years, so there&#39;s a lot of preparation and background notes, AKA, there&#39;s a LOT of reading.<br><br>Thanks everyone.

            <p>Essentially it&#39;s a Sue who has Godlike, or very extreme powers. AN example of this is Robecca, the Mary-Sue who &#39;created&#39; Narnia with her Cute Animal Friend &#39;Aslan&#39;. Essentially, the difference is the level of power. WHile Mary-Sues do often have world destroying powers, they tend to keep these &#39;Quiet&#39;, showing them off when they need to. And these powers tend to be very mystical, with no solid basis for their power source. I.e.: Mary-Sue who can destroy the world by falling in love. There&#39;s no reason to it, and we have no reason why it would destroy the world.<br><br>God!Sues on the other hand have very blatant powers that they show off very regularly. Whats worse is that they tend to have a reason to their power, which is usually &#39;They&#39;re a God, duh!&#39;. The God!Sue is usually specifically named to be a God, like that Horse Goddess Sue that was recently dealt with.</p>

            <p>I was thinking that most Sues had devastating powers (mine included). I still have some Sues in my fics, but they don&#39;t show off their powers and I have slight reasoning for their mega-powers. At the moments when they most need them, something cancels out their advantage. Whether that is an enemy of the same strength (or worse, as is more usual) or just something that nullifies their magic or whatever it is.<br><br>But I haven&#39;t created a God!Sue for a long, long time, thank God. I&#39;ve created a character who becomes a god when he dies but, like the Ancients in Stargate, is forbidden from helping the mortal plane. It annoys him to no end.</p>
