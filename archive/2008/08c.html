            <p>I&#39;m trying to write the missing piece of Agent Trojie&#39;s backstory; her year of insanity during 2006. I need a few volunteers for brief (one or two line) cameos. They will be returned unharmed; the worst that will happen to them is they&#39;ll be fed freshly-baked scones ...<br><br>I&#39;d rather use actual Agents than make up a few bit characters, is all, but I&#39;m not sure who has Agents that were actually around in 2006, so any volunteers would be really appreciated.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t dare look at any more. *glugs bleepka*<br><br>According to Wikipedia, rutting only happens in antlered members of the ungulate family (deer, sheep, antelope etc). Naruto seems to be some kind of human/cat/kyubi hybrid.<br><br>Herm!Naruto is, ugh! He&#39;s a male in canon <s>(or Sai would have said something already)</s> and so he should stay that way in fanfiction. Unless you&#39;re writing a genderswap AU that is. Or he&#39;s in his Sexy Jutsu form.<br><br>It says that Iruka is a school teacher, so maybe the author got suitcase and briefcase mixed up somehow. It makes an amusing mental image though.<br><br>Drowning works well for Naruto and Sasuke, as you suggested before. I don&#39;t know about the other characters though, since there&#39;s not enough of them in the first chapter to tell.<br><br>Pre-timeskip Sakura was pretty strong, if you count the fillers as canon. Before Sasuke left she ripped the mast off a boat and used it as a weapon.</p>

            <p>I took care of a High School AU that featured characters from different times (for example, one was canonically dead when another was a few years old).  When the author-wraith was exorcised and the canon snapped back, the series basically restarted and the characters were returned to how they would be at that point.<br><br>Or you could separately neuralyze each character and drop each back into the canon universe at the spot their characterization most closely matches.

            <p>As for killing them ... not sure. Since three of the agents getting rid of them are natural carnivores, there&#39;s an obvious answer for disposing of the bodies.

The technicalities of the writing are passable enough, and the NSFB aspects just go on at a fairly regular (and excessive) level all the way through so it&#39;s not like you could go partway and expect to exorcise at the &#39;most appalling part&#39;.

            <p>For example, we could be the PPC - a collection of people who strive to make use of a satirical sense of humour to define what is &#39;Acceptable&#39; and what isn&#39;t in the world of Fanfiction writing. To do this, we make stories that parody the cliches of writing, using a pre-existing text as our basis.<br><br>Or, otherwise, the PPC is an organisation of sentient beings who are controlled to take a stand against the stock character of the &#39;Mary Sue&#39;<br><br>That&#39;s my definition anyways.</p>

            <p>We got into a good MSN chat, and somehow came up with the idea of writing a story based on fantasy cliches, where most of the names are reversals of ordinary words and names. The working title is &quot;Fantasy By Numbers (And Some Backwards Names)&quot;. The cast so far is as follows, listed in order of creation: <br><br>Samoht, the Generic Desert Rider extra<br><br>Ardnassac, the bard who shows up to deliver an ancient song with convenient clues<br><br>Eissac, the guard escorting Our Heroes through the woodland fortress<br><br>Ennaxor, the Big Bad&#39;s underling who kicks Our Hero&#39;s ass in about Chapter Three, then gets killed ignominiously around Chapter Ten<br><br>Xela, the demoness whose wiles leave her beheaded<br><br>Yxor, the Big Bad who has taken control of the king<br><br>Newlir, the Standard Elf Guy who is Teh Awsum with a bow<br><br>Tarp, the local yokel and standard Hairy-Footed Short Thing<br><br>Gnik, the good king<br><br>Elcycib, the friendly big-bosomed tavern wench<br><br>Oreh the Mighty, the Hero<br><br>Dren the Weedy, the main sidekick<br><br>Krod, the ogre with bad timing and worse footwork<br><br>Resol, the very bad assassin<br><br>Ome the Androgynous (and angsty)<br><br>They live in the land of Onnudi.<br><br>We also have a few quotes from the as yet unwritten story.<br><br>&quot;What shall we call ourselves?&quot; &quot;Why not Dnabeht?&quot; &quot;Dnabeht, Ardnassac? Why a silly name like that?&quot; &quot;It seemed to fit the theme.&quot; &quot;What theme?&quot; &quot;You know what? Forget it. Would &#39;Oreh&#39;s Group&#39; work?&quot; &quot;BRILLIANT!&quot; &quot;...*sigh*&quot;<br><br>&quot;Here. My song. I was told to learn this while I was becoming a bard. It has never been appropriate until now, I&#39;ve never until now been able to sing it, and you&#39;re going to analyse the words and ignore my talent entirely, so let&#39;s get it over with?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, I am so depressed. My mum died after living a long and happy life, warm in her bed, with those she loved around her...&quot; &quot;Oh, Ome, shut up. You got the house.&quot; &quot;But the house...it is a fount of tragedy and despair...&quot; &quot;If you don&#39;t want it, I&#39;ll take it...&quot; &quot;*hastily* No, Resol, that house is *my* despair-filled burden, I cannot lay it upon you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Krod&#39;s pants itch.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Krod wiped Krod&#39;s rear with funny-looking leaves. Krod can feel swellings.&quot; All:*shudder* &quot;*sarcastically* Krod should make sure not to do that next time then.&quot; &quot;There will be next time?&quot; &quot;Yes, seeing as you never pay attention when we point out poison ivy.&quot;<br></p>

He runs the Makes-Things Fund For Abused Technology, or MTFFAT.

He&#39;s pretty distinctive, though- got turned into a Pak- Nixen&#39;s Known Space verse, apparently; I&#39;m not personally familiar with it- and Medical couldn&#39;t reverse it, so I doubt anyone&#39;d mistake them on sight.)</p>

            <p>&quot;I&#39;ve always wondered who invented that song.

            <p>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t surprise me either,&quot; he said.  &quot;Pretty poor melody that&#39;s got.

            <p>I don&#39;t feel comfortable asking for any sort of free reign in writing, so I&#39;m just throwing this idea out as an idea for a collaborative project.  Not sure if something similar has been done (casual browse through the Wiki doesn&#39;t show anything).<br><br>Anyway, let&#39;s say somebody (was thinking a rogue agent, but it can be whatever) shows up with a hijacked TARDIS (with the original owner left bound but otherwise unharmed in some easily located area, all the tracking machinery on it disabled, and the computer wired to intercept all mission communications) and starts interfering with the other agents&#39; missions with the intent to capture (as opposed to kill) as many Mary Sues as possible (including the subversion of at least one factory).  The idea behind kidnapping all of them (which is told to the organization in an attempt to get some cooperation) is for research into a potential but controversial solution to purify and seal off the entire multiverse from external tampering.<br><br>The solution in question is based around stolen Genesis technology from the Star Trek universe, with the projected end result being the &quot;Retbomb&quot;.  The Retbomb (which would be featured in a small scale test on a particularly contaminated but largely uncared about universe... probably Manos: The Hands of Fate or something) works by resetting every universe back to their original starting points before external tampering, but has the disagreeable side effect of also diverting all the PPC agents, equipment, and such back to their original canon universes (if not outright erasing them if they have no particular source) and erasing all memories of having traveled outside of their home universes.  Obviously, this would not mesh well with the survival instincts of the PPC and would also have too many potentially negative side effects to be something they&#39;d approve of and would result in a three way war between the PPC, League of Mary Sues, and this third entity.<br><br>Any thoughts?  I wanted to throw this idea out to see if anybody likes it.  I have some ideas for characters and such, but I wanted to first make sure that nothing like this had been done before (I can&#39;t find anything all that similar at the moment) and also that it would be something people would like to partake in.</p>

            <p>I think the others are right, y&#39;know. This year we&#39;ve had the Macrovirus Invasion in March, the Mary-Sues Invasion in April running on from that, the Robecca exorcism in Narnia in July, and the spambot/Ypur Invasion a few days ago which resulted in us switching Boards.<br><br>We really don&#39;t need any more emergencies, major threats or full-out wars. The Catastrophe Theory adherents are already going to be going berserk and waving placards about Doom and the End being Near. If you want to see the other emergencies we&#39;ve had, the Wiki page &quot;PPC Emergencies&quot; will tell you everything.<br><br>Not to mention that HQ, while back to normal business, suffered a drastic loss of agents during the first two Invasions this year and therefore probably would struggle to cope with another war.<br><br>And as a final point against carryng this idea out right now (I&#39;m not saying &quot;Forget it, we&#39;ll never do this&quot;, just &quot;Hold back and wait&quot;), a few months ago we were requested by hS to remember that the purpose of the PPC is entertainment, not continually taking down the big guns. I believe his metaphor was along the lines of &quot;It&#39;s very satisfying taking down a Death Star, but while you&#39;re doing that there&#39;s a thousand TIE fighters on your tail&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;d suggest taking on a few regular missions- exorcising slashwraiths from Legolas and Aragorn or killing off another twin sister of Harry Potter or something- before we have to deal with yet another problem that pulls us all off regular duty.<br><br>On the other hand, I do think this sounds like an idea with a lot of potential and I would be happy to join in with it. I am also curious as to where the Flowers would go, as their original world no longer exists.</p>

            <p>If you want to trick them into reading goodfic, assuming that the Legendary Goodfic are already known and feared by them, I can recommend a few for you. One&#39;s a Naruto/Gundam Wing crossover, another&#39;s a Naruto/Harry Potter and a third is a Harry Potter/Gundam Wing crossover. No one expects crossovers to be good, which is what would lull them into a false sense of security perhaps.</p>

            <p>Looks like it&#39;s missing, all right.<br><br>It was that bad. I don&#39;t even know much about Full Metal Alchemist, and it was blatantly, obviously, horribly bad. Songfic, too, by the way.<br><br>Since I still had it up on my screen, here&#39;s the first couple of sentences:<br><br><i>Sophie walked into the office. In her crisp blue uniform with the Uniform Skirt and a pair of blue heels. Sophie Jennifer Witmor. She was a solider and a girl, at only age 17. She was a little to mature for her age, and she hated it. Everyone liked her for her looks, they never let her do anything!</i><br><br>Yeah. And that&#39;s just the start. She&#39;s a lieutenant, by the way. One who flouts regulations and insults superior officers ... hell, knocks down superior officers ... but seems to avoid the court-martial that should naturally follow. We&#39;ve got world-class Sueage here ... and she took it down. :( Where&#39;s the fun in that?<br></p>

            <p>There was one thing I didn&#39;t mention in my post over on the alternative board concerning dealing with the spam-bot: The yourwebapps.com people will give control of an admin-less forum to someone who asks for it. This omission was deliberate - spam-bots are annoying. Spam-bots with admin powers would murder this place faster than you or I could blink.<br><br>As it stands, I currently have access to the administrator account for the board.

            <p>It&#39;s a good idea for the PGs and any potential Mods to be kept seperate. Absolute power will corrupt absolutely, as the saying goes.<br>Rather, why don&#39;t we keep the Moderators a secret? We hold the vote, etc, or rather, Techno-Dann does, deleting everyone&#39;s vote as they come in. Once done, he tallies the votes, and the selected Moderator would gain their position, and be notified, with no-one else knowing the result.<br>That way, if a Moderator tries to lord it over people, they can have their position removed because no-one is meant to know who it is. If they reveal it, then a new Moderator is chosen.<br><br>The PPC Secret Service, or something like that. Techno-Dnan acts as the visible head *Coughs* Target *Coughs*, while the other one works behind the scenes.</p>

            <p>Personally, I guess I don&#39;t like it because it requires the admin and all the mods to be trustworthy. If someone out to get us got mod powers, or for that matter, if there was ever a nasty debate involving a moderator, there&#39;d be no accountability at all - the moderator involved could edit whatever she pleased, and nobody would have solid proof of who had done it. (Not even the admin - that&#39;s one of the limitations of the system.)<br><br>I prefer the &quot;break glass in case of fire&quot; approach to admin powers - they really should only be used when there&#39;s an obvious need - spammers, trolls who wouldn&#39;t go away when asked nicely, and so on. As long as discussions stay civil (and we&#39;ve got a great track record when it comes to that), we shouldn&#39;t need admin intervention at all.</p>

            <p>Although it is rather an interesting idea. We don&#39;t have to be unaware of who the admin is, but it doesn&#39;t need to be brought up in general discussion. That way, if someone or something new starts kicking off, that admin can step in and fix the problem witout being singled out as a target. Maybe a little more like the DIA than the DIS. A tiny group wholly dedicated to the PPC&#39;s protection, rather than a group dedicated to bullying and silencing those whom they didn&#39;t want around.<br><br>And I&#39;m babbling.

            <p>I just thought I&#39;d raise my voice in agreement with the majority. <br><br>We don&#39;t need mods. The PPC is run on the grounds of modding ourselves and each other. What we do need is an admin to fix the technical problems. As others have said, Techno-Dann is our most internet-savvy person, and has been handling the problem since day one. If we do need to vote, I&#39;m going with him.<br><br>If he decides to retire or something, we can decide on a new admin then.</p>

            <p>At the very least, becoming one (a permission giver or a moderator) must not imply the other - they&#39;re different jobs, and a person who is good at one may be absolutely the wrong choice for the other.<br><br>Onto a more fundamental question... do we even need moderators?

            <p>As long as being a PG isn&#39;t synonymous with having Board powers, or vice-versa, I don&#39;t see a problem.

            <p>There are two ways of looking at moderators:<br><br>One, and it&#39;s the way most moderators seem to see themselves, as <b>authorities</b> -- people with the power and authority to keep the peons in line.<br><br>The other (which I think is the right way to look at it) is as <b>garbage collectors</b>, hired to clean up spambot droppings and similar detritus.<br><br>The trick is, first, to appoint people with the garbageman mindset, and second, to make sure they don&#39;t drift towards the dictator mindset.<br><br>The problem is, of course, that there&#39;s no 100% reliable way to go about it. Or if there is, in 14 years of moderating everything from a BBS to numerous Web forums, I haven&#39;t met anyone who&#39;s figured it out. The best solution seems to be having a stable, sane, steady, and well-trusted person in charge -- Techno-Dann, in our case -- and having that person act as &quot;benevolent dictator&quot;, able to appoint mods as needed to take care of shoveling up bot droppings if and when needed.<br><br>Moderating users&#39; posts can be a slippery slope, because there&#39;s always the matter of lines and where you draw them. The &quot;what is a flame?&quot; poll in my FFN profile is still live, and it&#39;s interesting seeing the spread of the responses. There are people who draw the line maybe a little harsher than I do, and people who think all but the mildest and most apologetic concrit is a &quot;flame&quot;, and many somewhere in between. The same thing happens on forums: What exactly constitutes a &quot;personal attack&quot;? How far is it to &quot;off topic&quot;? What exactly is &quot;unfriendly&quot; and is it different for different people? When you have people making judgment calls about that, you get drama.<br><br>My rules as moderator:<br><br>1. Never mod a discussion you&#39;re participating in. At the very least there is a perception of a conflict of interest; at the worst, you&#39;ll turn into a modzi.<br><br>2. Use the least-destructive moderation possible: For instance, move a post rather than editing it; edit it rather than delete it.<br><br>3. If you edit or delete a post, put a copy of the original on the mods&#39; board for review.<br><br>Obviously 2 and 3 require a forum that has editing and moving capabilities, and somewhere to put the mods&#39; board. The basic principles, though, remain the same.<br><br>Resentment and distrust of the mods is more destructive to an online community than any amount of off-topic posting, flaming, and board drama. 99% of the time, that distrust is self-inflicted, as the mods get above themselves (much like politicians) and see themselves as your masters, not our servants.<br><br>So, I propose that the title of anyone given moderation powers on this board be &quot;Bot Manure Shoveler&quot; and they be issued a patch depicting a shovel and a wheelbarrow.<br><br>Moderators, like fire, make good servants but poor masters.</p>

But giving all PGs moderator&#39;s powers over the Board, as you say, would be a Bad Thing.<br><br>I suppose the fair path to take would be to hold some kind of an election for Board Moderators and choose say three of them, or something, and then make sure that one cannot be both a PG and a Boad Moderator.<br><br>Having said that, I think that at least for the moment, Techno-Dann is probably the most logical choice as Moderator given he is computer and Internet-savvy and the person who knows most about the whole situation. <br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve looking for a reasonably well-written yet still utterly cr*p badfic that I once saw. It&#39;s a Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings crossover with (I believe) a bit of Dragonball Z lumped in. It involves Harry getting booted into Middle-Earth and randomly becoming Harold the Black, the sixth Istari (or something, I really can&#39;t remember much).<br><br>I believe the title was &#39;BLANK BLANK Arda&#39;.

            <p>I think you--or I--may be confusing two badfics--&quot;Sanctuary of Arda&quot; is the LotR/HP/Dragonball Z crossover, like Eni said.  There&#39;s another fic, &quot;The Black Wizard of Middle-earth&quot; or something like that where he goes to Beleriand, becomes Harold the Black, and makes Fлanor OOC.  I could be wrong, though.</p>

            <p>I remembered it from a sporking someone once did. I wanted to read the original fic but never got around to it. I think I had it saved on my laptop but after raising it from the dead (almost literally. It&#39;s virtually lifeless) I couldn&#39;t find it.

            <p>...for the simple reason that death would be much slower, and of the Sue&#39;s own making.<br><br>See, one of the things I REALLY hate about this TV show is:<br><br>a) it makes Pride and Prejudice sound like escapist literature, which it is NOT. <br><br>b) it legitimizes escapism without consequences, that is, the Mary Sue sees nothing wrong with escaping into Pride and Prejudice instead of <i>dealing</i> with the consequences of everyday life. That, my friend, is called turning yourself into a victim of circumstance.   <br><br>One of my favorite passages ever comes from the Neverending Story.  It has this to say about Fantastica (the world of human fantasy):<br><br><i>&#39;There are people who can never go to Fantastica,&#39; said Mr. Coriander, &#39;and others who can, but who stay there forever.  And there are just a few who go to Fantastica and come back.  Like yuou.  And they make both worlds well again.&#39;</i><br><br><b>That</b> is what fantasy should be.  That is what going into another world should be. The character should have enough imagination to go there, enough pragmatism to go back, and enough strength to knit her desires into the fabric of her real life, and make both her dream and day-to-day worlds whole and healthy.<br><br>...they never do that, though, do they?<br><br>~Araeph <br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>the usual organiser of the Gatherings is hS, and as a Brit, he tends to arrange them in Britain. I think the only Gatherings he wasn&#39;t organising or at least present for were the Canadian ones- the one that Leto organised back in 2004 and the two-person one that happened this summer.<br><br>American Gatherings would be tricky, just for the logistics of getting everyone to the meeting place, and it&#39;d have to be more than just a day-trip thing.</p>

Anal would be pointing out that there&#39;s no way Nazgul could be chasing Harry Potter because it&#39;s two different fandoms, like one person I told about your incredibly amusing attempt to insult me.  If you think I&#39;m anal, just wait until you find out how anal bosses are.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m back from holiday, and thinking about actually organising some of my backlog. Some of it involves Bad Slash missions. However, I am not a natural Bad Slasher, and so must request help ...<br><br>1) The Naruto mission Kitsune106 and I agreed to share. We&#39;re struggling with what to do with the &quot;pet&quot; copies of the characters. Obviously the two leading felines need to die because they&#39;re disgustingly cutesy and nothing like the characters they&#39;re supposedly based on. What about the rest of them? Ansela recommended killing the lot at once, and they are blatantly character replacements because even I&#39;ve read enough of the manga to know that Hinata is not a hermaphrodite with mouse ears (not making this up, I swear), but some of them might be salvageable or just too cute to kill. Even if the ones supposed to be based on canon characters aren&#39;t salvageable, what about the babies they produce in the later chapters?<br><br>2) I require help with the sporking of a much shorter Harry Potter badfic entitled &quot;Suck&quot;, which mutilates the Nine Inch Nails song of the same name and apparently features Harry Potter raping Remus Lupin, or at least engaging in a deeply dubious situation with him. I believe Paddlebrains offered to help me with it when I first brought it to the attention of the PPC, but if she&#39;s busy it&#39;s okay. Any tips from anyone else would be welcome regardless.<br><br>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>The only people she&#39;s shown hitting in canon, outside of combat and training, are Naruto and Sai, the latter only when he calls her a hag, insults Sasuke or takes his teasing of Naruto too far.
