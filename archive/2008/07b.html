            <p>I got to see Les Miserables tonight, and it was absolutely amazing. Never were hype and fandom more deserved! I was very fortunate to have a great cast to carry the roles, which demand that you connect to them in a very brief period of time. I cried more than I usually do at plays, which just goes to show how well they did and how well-crafted Les Mis is to begin with.<br><br>I had all kinds of things to say, but it&#39;s late and I&#39;m tired, and they&#39;ve slipped my mind.

            <p>Props to Sara. I liked the turn of phrase. {= )<br><br>So, thoughts. First of all, Eponine is way more sympathetic than I thought just from hearing the soundtrack. Whoever does her voice in the original cast recording is really, really annoying, which makes it hard to like her. The actress I saw was very good, though. She&#39;s probably the most interesting female character in the play.<br><br>I&#39;m still not entirely sure what the play is &quot;about,&quot; but I am sure it isn&#39;t about the Revolution. This is very strange to me. The Revolution feels like the climax of the story because it has the biggest action, but for everyone but the students, it&#39;s merely incidental. It forces Valjean, Javert, Eponine, and Marius into some choices they wouldn&#39;t have had to make otherwise, but other than that, it accomplishes nothing. As the chorus observes, the world goes on more or less unchanged. It&#39;s completely tragic in that sense, and it confuses my sense of plot. I don&#39;t think there is a plot in the regular sense--it&#39;s just the chronicles of the lives of a few people trying to get by the best they can in a hard world.<br><br>When I say I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s about, I think I mean I&#39;m not sure what the take-home message is. Maybe there isn&#39;t one of those, either. Maybe we&#39;re just supposed to think about it thoroughly.<br><br>In all the drama, it was good to have the Thenardiers to break the tension once in a while. They&#39;re so delightfully horrible, and they add comedy without trivializing the drama. In fact, the way those rats seem to have the last laugh just highlights the terrible state of things.<br><br>All of the cast was very good with the possible exception of Fantine, which is too bad. Even though I cried at her death scene, I was glad I wouldn&#39;t have to listen to her anymore. Javert was probably the best. He had some kind of accent; I&#39;m not sure what, but it made him stand out, and his voice was great. Valjean sounded like Valjean--very impressive, what with the demanding range in the part.<br><br>Men have an unfair advantage when it comes to range. Anyone can train their voice to go higher (whether it sounds good is another matter), but the bottom of your range is the bottom of your range. You can&#39;t train your vocal cords to be longer than they are. Also, there&#39;s only so high a soprano can go before nobody wants to hear those notes, even if she&#39;s exceptionally gifted. {= P<br><br>All those long-haired bass/baritones reminded me of <i>my</i> long-haired bass/baritone. <sup>_<sup><br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

            <p>You lucky dog, you. <br><br>Yay about Eponine--I agree that her voice on the soundtrack was...well...bleh, to put it into a sound-word. And too bad about Fantine. Sort of a switch in voice goodness/badness for the characters as opposed to the soundtrack, then?<br><br>Eee, Javert and Valjean! Good to know that Valjean was pulled off well--that range is damn impressive.<br><br>I&#39;d have to agree about that unfair advantage--case in point, my voice instructor. The man can hit those low notes beautifully, but do the most spot-on Julie Andrews vocal impression ever, high notes and all. <br><br>Thank you for tellings! ;-D</p>

            <p>The world does not change, but the people do.  Valjean finds peace and redemption, Cosette goes from being a drudge to a young woman with the man of her dreams.  Javert is unable to accept the changes in his worldview and chooses death instead.  That&#39;s where the plot is.  <br><br>If there&#39;s a message, I think it has to do with redemption.

            <p>There were several times. <sup>_<sup>;</sup></sup> Fantine&#39;s death, Gavroche&#39;s death (which I did NOT see coming)--pretty much any time people died, actually--a couple of Eponine&#39;s songs, &quot;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.&quot; I think perhaps because I was already familiar with the soundtrack, it didn&#39;t take much to drive it home, if that makes sense.<br><br>Incidentally, I agree that &quot;Stars&quot; seems out of place, even though I haven&#39;t read the book. It&#39;s a beautiful song, a great song, but it&#39;s kinda like, &quot;the scene is over, but oh, wait, I have a solo now.&quot; And it doesn&#39;t really tell us anything about Javert that we don&#39;t already know, i.e., he wants the world to follow the rules, be stable, and make sense. Of course, it doesn&#39;t. Poor him.<br><br>I saw it at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. Apparently they &quot;reimagined&quot; it, with different sets and staging and stuff, but I have no basis for comparison. All I can say is that it worked.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Jeeze, it&#39;s been a long times since I did one of these. Well, here goes.<br><br><i>4) Janette, the Outcast by MarryMerryMonaghan<br>*VSS*Janette is and outcast among other things, she becomes a witch, what happens when Merry and Pippin spend a day with her? Read and find out *VSS*Very Short Story</i><br><br>Janette was--that is to say, she existed. There wasn&#39;t much else to say about her until the day she got kicked out of her village for wearing entirely too much mascara (they had public ordnances for such things back in the day), at which time she found herself gradually drawn to the bad side of Angmar, where she fell in with a crowd of fellow rejects and started dabbling in witchcraft. Well, that&#39;s what they called it. It looked more like an excuse for nine guys to wear swooshy robes and play with jewelry. Janette never got quite as into it as they did, and she decided it was just as well when they all went off and got killed in some war.<br><br>One day, she decided she&#39;d had enough of exile and wanted to see the world, so she packed her things and headed south. Imagine her surprise when she came upon two small people in armor!<br><br>&quot;Greetings and salutations,&quot; she said redundantly, employing the universally-approved method of speaking to foreigners, which is of course to speak LOUD-ER and SLOW-ER. &quot;I am Janette. Who are you?&quot;<br><br>Unfortunately, neither Merry nor Pippin reacted well to the protracted screeching and hissing that made up her language. Merry was particularly affected by her sudden appearance at the side of the road as well as her black robes and the ridiculous amount of mascara she still wore. With a Rohirric battle-cry, he drew his sword and repeated his performance of the Pelennor with one important difference: His aim was quite a bit better this time. Janette died before she hit the ground, and the hobbits spent the rest of the day disposing of her corpse.<br><br>~*~<br><br>I hope I spelled everything right. It&#39;s been a while since I read LotR.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The story I&#39;m about to PPC happens to involve a young &#39;Witch&#39; - the niece of Voldemort and the Granddaughter of Dumbledore, whose name is Celebi. Now, people have told me I need to have a very painful death for her, and this is what I&#39;ve come up with.<br><br>Since Celebi also happens to be a &#39;Grass / Psychic&#39; Type in the Pokemon World, the plan is this: Firstly, the Agents &#39;Borrow&#39; a device from a Pokemon Goodfic which prevents the use of psychic powers.<br>At which point, the Agents tie the &#39;Sue to a stake (Little tribute to the Salem Trials) in the middle of the HFA Quidditch Stadium, where the monsters Volvagia and the King Dodongo from Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, have a Detahmatch against each other, with said &#39;Sue in the middle.<br>It&#39;s more a point of permission. I don&#39;t really wanna tread on anyone&#39;s toes, particularly Meir&#39;s. Anyone else think of a suitable location, or know how to acquire permission?<br><br>And since we do want the &#39;Sue to be in pain for as long as possible, we will be casting the occasional healing charm, not neccesarily a HP one, to fix up her burns. Any Wizard / Witch Agents are welcome to participate in the spectacle.</p>

            <p>It was posted. Since it&#39;s probably about two pages in the past, I&#39;ll post it again:<br><br>1. Celebi&#39;s Diary<br>Celebi Dumbledore, granddaughter of Albus Dumbledore and niece of Voldemort, releases herself from fulfilling her duty as a death eater and turns to Harry&#39;s arms. What will happen to her promised marriage and love to Draco?<br><br>Now, since little Celebi happens to offend two continuums, that&#39;s why I&#39;m making the punishment extra mean, by pitting King Dodongo: <img src="http://jm3091.k12.sd.us/lores16.gif" alt="http://jm3091.k12.sd.us/lores16.gif"><br>and Volvagia: <img src="http://jm3091.k12.sd.us/lores15.gif" alt="http://jm3091.k12.sd.us/lores15.gif"><br>against each other in a big death match. Since both use fire, Celebi will be tied to a stake in the center of the field. To prolong her suffering, she will be doused in fire-resilient oil, and subject to the occasional healing charm from the crowd. Of course, other charms are also welcome. The match will end when there is a definite victory by King Dodongo or Volvagia, and the &#39;Sue has been destroyed. Should Celebi live through the first battle, we will cast an illusion on Celebi to make her look like Link, from Legend of Zelda. That should just about do it.</p>

            <p>So, we all know that if you can&#39;t fix something with duct tape and gorilla glue, you&#39;re basically screwed. Duct tape happens to be a personal favorite of mine (I have a wide variety of colors from camo to hot pink), and in a discussion about an insane RPer Chatvert and I have gotten to know well, this came up. She fails at reality, so I was going to beat her with a clu-by-four and then the duct tape showed up.<br><br>Duct tape is used to keep things together, yes? Well, take that, and apply it to canon. Thus, you get the Duct Tap O&#39; Canon. Basically, you can use it to fix holes in canon that may spontaneously appear, and if you wrap a Sue up in it, she suffocates. Feel free to be creative here, from wrapping her up like a spider&#39;s dinner to sticking her humiliatingly on a ceiling or other such surface.<br><br>It can also be used to tie up canon characters to placate them a little bit in case they have been so drastically affected by the fic or the Sue that they need to be tied up while the perpetrator is disposed of.<br><br>Sounds good/bad? Please feel free to bash or approve, I care not. This just popped in my head and I thought it might be worth exploring.</p>

            <p>Just going on a string of logic here... <br><br>What if a former-Sue/Stu is an agent? Would it hurt them, particularly if they&#39;re in the canon that SueAgent came from? What effect would it have on agents in general, as we, too, don&#39;t really belong in the canon?<br><br>I&#39;m picturing this &#39;DTOC&#39; as being much less sentient than Canon itself, which, as we all know, tries to protect its agents.

            <p>Yes, I agree that the DTOC wouldn&#39;t be very smart, so you&#39;d probably have to get specific types that were individualized for canon, like LotR tape doesn&#39;t work in Narnia or something.<br><br>I do agree that it should have a downside; it might burn agents in general if they don&#39;t belong in that canon, which they don&#39;t mst of the time. For ex-Seus/Stus, I guess the effect would be stronger. I wasn&#39;t figuring that it would work immediately though, like it would start affecting someone only if they had it stuck to them long enough, so short-term contact while applying it to someone else would probably be safe.<br><br>And then, when you got back to HQ, you&#39;d have to keep it in a box by itself or something so it wouldn&#39;t start forcing canon on random objects it was dropped on.</p>

            <p>Like those heat or ice packs that take a little while to work after exposed to air. So you rip it off the roll, and then you&#39;ve got a short but specified amount of time before whatever-it-is that&#39;s on the tape starts to eat through your skin. A fun thing here would be a type of reaction that actually causes explosions, and they are possible by the laws of chemistry. I can&#39;t remember any offhand, but there are a few. Also, you could put fire to the tape and then it explodes whatever it&#39;s holding.<br><br>Or, you&#39;d just have to be really careful when taking it off if poison is used.<br><br>Canon-specific tape is also an option, as is kill-specific. Like LotR tape doesn&#39;t work in Narnia, and poison versus fire or just pain until you can kill them some way else. If you were to tie up a canon character with it, generic tape would just subdue them but harm a Sue that didn&#39;t belong, and in that case it would probably burn Agents, but if you only hold the sticky side for a short period of time, it should do too much to you.</p>

            <p>...if we were to focus on well-known fandoms, an awful lot of truly awful fic would be allowed to live, and that would be a Bad Thing. I think the trick&#39;s finding a balance that still satisfies your need to kill the fic while making the mission accessible to people who don&#39;t know the fandom. Which is, obviously, easier said than done, but certainly worth a try.</p>

            <p>When writing a PPC mission for a little-known fandom, there aren&#39;t necessarily going to be many people around who can read it. I&#39;m rather saddened that I have to skip over a number of available missions just because I don&#39;t understand the original canon well enough to understand what&#39;s going on - anime is a good example. LotR, Harry Potter and so on are great because almost everyone knows them.<br><br>But certainly, it&#39;s worth a try. Don&#39;t let me discourage you. </p>

            <p>Actually, I have seen a few goodfics there, which I really enjoyed. Both oneshots, but <i> beautifully </i> written.<br><br>Ah, goodfic... *wistful sigh*<br><br>But, this, well... The person claims that HDM is her favorite series ever, but then proceeds to bugger everything up.<br><br>Now, I have no problem with aspiring writers who may have a lot of trouble with plot, grammar, or formatting.<br><br>But if you don&#39;t bother to study or ask questions where you need help, nor learn important facts about the book you write fic for... I have no sympathy. <br><br>I  must also write down one particular thing which is bothering me about this fic thus far:<br>Premise: Will and Lyra have got married and had a child. (Oh, yay! Totally ruining the point of the bittersweet ending! Ye <i> gods... </i>)<br> Now, they&#39;re living in Will&#39;s world, and the daughter has no idea that she has a dжmon- her parents kept him from her until he settled (as a cat), and she doesn&#39;t understand why they won&#39;t let anyone touch him, etc. She thinks he&#39;s just her pet cat.<br><br>On the plus side, the girl has always felt something missing, but that&#39;s the only positive.<br><br>Need I say that Will would never do this? He is fascinated by dжmons, as we know, and Lyra would never let him do something so cruel to their own child.<br>And I think, personally, that the author is really underestimating the power of the connection- which can, after all, break open gates between worlds, as Roger proved. If they haven&#39;t been severed, being kept apart until adolescence would be devastating, potentially fatal, to both. She wouldn&#39;t just feel sad sometimes. <br>Why are they hiding this from her, anyway? *controls urge to  burn things*<br><br>The author has also totally steamrollered over Pullman&#39;s name significance- Lyra&#39;s daughter is &quot;Lylee.&quot; <br>Lyra happens to be a constellation. D:<br><br>Oh, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but have panserbjшrne ever been referred to as &quot;ice bears&quot; rather than the proper &quot;armoured bears?&quot; Because Suethor did that, too.<br><br>...You know, this fic is probably going to be how the still-resentful Teek and Crebaina finally bond. Because Crebaina&#39;s mental and emotional state is not going to hold up well. <br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Well, he has three of those reddish border-collie pup things from Final Fantasy X-2 (Their mother was a Cute Animal Friend). Additionally, there is also a recently found Mini-Chocobo, which COULD pass for a normal animal, if it isn&#39;t seen too frequently (Use of a SEP Field would be useful).<br>There is also a horse who is the (Eugh) daughter of Epona, from Legend of Zelda, and therefore, very intelligent. No found &#39;Suish qualities yet though.<br>Other than that, he has a Kecleon in stroage which can change its colour to look like a normal chameleon. There&#39;s also Arit, the mini-Agent who shapeshifts on demand since no-one knows what he is, so he could be used to suit the way daemons change their shape if your Agents are adapting a young persona.<br><br>And that&#39;s about it. Arit would probably be your best bet though, since he&#39;s intelligent. Other than that, maybe Epona&#39;s daughter? She was never really given a name, so if you want, your Agents could name her, or something like that.</p>

            <p>Hi, all - I need some advice.<br><br>For a paper I&#39;m currently taking at uni, the semester&#39;s major project is a long essay on a non-fiction subject of our choice. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I think I can make fanfiction <i>as a community phenomena</i> my subject - which, quite frankly, would make my day, because of all the topic ideasI&#39;ve had so far, it&#39;s the only one that really sparks my interest.<br><br>In the course of researching I would be doing a lot of research, including surveys, which I may offer to everyone here, if you&#39;re interested in helping, but my main issue at the moment is whether or not it would be wise to talk, however briefly, about the PPC in a rather offical essay. I&#39;m going to write a section on the legality of fanfic itself, and defend it, but Tungsten Monk&#39;s recent withdrawal has made me cautious; I don&#39;t want to get anyone, including myself, in trouble, and the PPC is a much smaller and more specific group than fanfic writers in general.<br><br>So I ask you; is it wise? <br><br>I&#39;m pitching the idea to my professor in a day or so, and nothing&#39;s final yet anyway, but I&#39;d like your opinions on the matter. <br><br>Thanks in advance,<br><br>- Sedri</p>

            <p>I suppose that I mostly felt I needed your consent before deciding to do something like this. I don&#39;t particularly fear that we&#39;re all going to be dragged into court, but in my experience, it&#39;s always better to ask.<br><br>So thanks, all of you. And yes, I&#39;ll definitely keep you lot involved in it; you probably won&#39;t be able to shut me up after I finish it - I&#39;ll be too happy. You&#39;ll certainly get a link, Tomato. ;)<br><br>In direct response to Nesh and Pads: No, I don&#39;t particularly care if my professors give me strange looks, because if nothing else, I&#39;ll be remembered as someone who&#39;s passionate about writing and precision. And I like this one; he seems quite open-minded - actually, in the first class he told us that since he has to read about twenty thousand words at the end of semester, we&#39;ll get better marks if we&#39;re interesting. He certainly thought it had potential when I gave a very brief sketch of fanfiction a few weeks ago. Besides, that&#39;s why we have a very early session devoted entirely to topic approval. <br><br>Ah, I ramble. I suppose I&#39;m just relieved. Thank you, guys.<br><br>(Of course, if anyone has more to say, don&#39;t let the finality of the above line stop you. I&#39;m always interested.)</p>

            <p>...is that they don&#39;t actually check up on these things. If it&#39;s one particular module of your course, the odds of whoever&#39;s teaching you taking a dramatic interest, seeing what&#39;s happening, and pulling a load of lawyers on fandom&#39;s head in the name of creativity are minimal. If you were, for example, basing a Phd on a fanfictiony topic that relied heavily on the PPC, you&#39;d be drawing a little more attention, but even then, the prospects of negative legal impact are slim; the greater worry would be having a tutor who objected in some way and thus marked you down. And if you&#39;re concentrating on the phenomena aspect rather than anything else peculiar to the fanfiction world, as a paper it works, and there would also be little basis that I can see for problems with your tutor.<br><br>And certainly, if you&#39;re choosing the PPC and related phenomena, your surveys and whatnot should be thrown this way.</p>

            <p>Remove Heist the Porcupine, The Foot Kestrel and &quot;of course the unforgettable&quot; Max Ranger and make them a trio in a new story! The story opens on them surrounded by an army of robot ninjas in an empty desert, and they flashback to how they got into this mess - revealing an epic journey to find The Sword of Abull-Kabar across the land of Anarchronis, and save it from &quot;a gazillion-jillion&quot; years of ultimate darkness.<br><br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got so far.

            <p>Aeron is pleased at the kinship. For the record (since I, too, am dying to plug something I&#39;ve thought up), Aeron is a crow because they symbolize, among other things, trickery, boldness, cunning, understanding things related to ethics, knowledge, and &quot;moving freely in the void.&quot;<br><br>Crebaina came here through a plothole, has become rather scarily obsessed with Enlightenment philosophy, and the rest is self-explanatory. <br>(Although, I found the bit about the void <i> after </i> deciding on the plothole idea, and I&#39;d already chosen his form before that. Decidedly creepy.)<br><br>I was right? *controls urge to dance about in glee* <br>Now that I think on it, Crebaina probably would have done that, but either Aeron cautioned her out of it, or she remembered that all this stuff was integral to her task. <br>(One could delve into her backstory and say that one day she probably took apart something equally complicated in her father&#39;s lab, which did not end well.)<br><br>I... actually just finished reading that about half an hour ago.

            <p>Thanks! And yes, you guessed right. <br><br>Crebaina thinks Teek is immature, rash, and far too hyper; plus, she can&#39;t stand her tastes in music, but Teek insists on hooking up her iPod to whatever&#39;s available and blasting Queen after every successful mission.<br><br>Teek, meanwhile, is jealous of Crebaina&#39;s dжmon and the fact that she&#39;s from another world, and thinks she&#39;s too cold and haughty. (It doesn&#39;t help that Crebaina&#39;s natural expression is rather arrogant, but it&#39;s just the way her face seems.)<br>To make matters even worse, she tried to pet Franзois the iguana, who promptly bit her. <br><br>They&#39;ll probably have to be firmly bonded through strife; i.e. REALLY terrible badfic. <br><br></p>

            <p>...and the ownership of Response Centre #1764, Department of Floaters.<br><br>A writing sample can be found here; it&#39;s a random and rather strange little Redwall-based oneshot from my Pit of Voles account (it was all I could think of at the moment; apologies in advance for weirdness and morbidity).<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183158/1/Eater_Of_The_Dead"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183158/1/Eater_Of_The_Dead">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183158/1/Eater_Of_The_Dead</a></a><br><br>Brief descriptions of Agents are as follows:<br><br><b> Agent Teek: </b> The definite extrovert. Hailing from the Real World, Teek is a cheerful, mildly psychotic, extremely klutzy sixteen-year-old, who finds everything from foxes to cuttlefish positively adorable. She has a fervent love for anything remotely pointy and sharp, and very loud punk, rock, and power-metal (much to her partner&#39;s displeasure). She refuses to wear skirts, dresses, or any clothing that isn&#39;t black; fortunately, this works out fine.<br><br>Obsessions include, but are not limited to: Harry Potter, The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide To The Galaxy, Discworld, and a <i> lot </i> of Monty Python. Still retains a bit of the die-hard Redwall fanaticism of her middle-school years, as well, and positively adores Pirates Of The Caribbean. <br><br>She&#39;s a realist (though her definition of reality is to turn the music up louder and ignore it), as well as a cynic.<br><br><b> Agent Crebaina: </b> The introvert. As her name infers, she&#39;s the Tolkien nut of the pair. Crebaina is seventeen, and also native to the Real World, although she doesn&#39;t seem to have acknowledged it too much during her stay. Despite the fact that she&#39;s calm, idealistic, and philosophical, she&#39;s a control freak and a ruthless Grammar and Canon Nazi. (This combination does not bode well.)<br><br>She has a very long temper (well, in comparison to the volatile Teek, at least), although the time before it finally snaps is time spent seething. Her loves, besides Tolkien, include His Dark Materials and anything by H.P. Lovecraft; her obsession with the latter borders on unsettling.<br><br>She shares her bit of the RC with her crow dжmon, Aeron, and her beloved iguana, Franзois (he was a welcome gift). <br><br>*pantpant* Hope all this checks out. I am rather excited. :)</p>

            <p>Firstly, I don&#39;t use the horizontal lines that much- the piece was a weird little thing that kind of cut back and forth between thought and flashback; hence, the scene breaks. It&#39;s not exactly the best thing I&#39;ve ever written.<br><br>Secondly... well, all right, that isn&#39;t going to work, as I can&#39;t readily find a plausible explanation. It was a sudden, spur-of-the-moment idea, really, and I&#39;d totally forgotten that it doesn&#39;t easily compute. Although, it might not be too hard to re-write her as coming from Lyra&#39;s world... she&#39;d just use different words for things, and have some slight cultural differences. <br>I was just unsure on how, exactly, random people from other universes would learn of Sues and the PPC, when both originated here. Is there an accepted answer? <br><br>(Because I&#39;ve been working on the first mission a little, and the daemon seems to have stuck. It&#39;d be interesting to write a character from Pullman&#39;s universe... that little question just bothers me.)<br><br>But thanks very much. :)<br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>It could always be a Mini, that would be the first attempt. <br><br>Another likelyhood could be that, while she was born in Lyra&#39;s world, a badly-placed plothole put her into the Real World.<br><br>And lastly, maybe she was experimenting in her RC with bleeprin, alcohol, chocolate and cake to make an alcoholic Bleepolate cake when she was knocked out by the ensuing explosion.

            <p>I like the plothole, though- she could easily have learned about the windows into other worlds, and mistaken a random plothole for one.

            <p>I was - for some reason - under the impression that this thread was just for nominating ideas, and that later on you&#39;d post a master list from which we could vote directly, rahter than do a bit here and a bit there.

The lyrics are as follow:<br><br><br>&#39;You know that I&#39;ve come something special.<br>I feel so lucky to be.<br>Some people say that I&#39;m a princess running wild.<br>But don&#39;t waste your time with them; just look into my eyes.<br><br><br>Now you&#39;re under my spell.<br>And I&#39;m not gonna set you free.<br>But you can hitch a ride on my star.<br>You better believe that I want you,<br>And you need me.<br>It&#39;s time to make some history.<br>So why&#39;d you have to go and waste your time on her?<br>Waste your time on me!<br><br>Some people say that I&#39;m superficial;<br>But that&#39;s a compliment to me.<br>Because I&#39;d rather be a super-something<br>Than a boring anything else.<br>Just take one look at me<br>And throw your heart in the wishing well.<br>&#39;Cause I&#39;m your Jezebel.<br><br><br><br>I wanna save the whale;<br>And start a charity.<br>Just as long as I can keep all eyes on me.<br><br><br><br>I&#39;ll blow your mind,<br>Don&#39;t spend your time on boring personalities.<br>Forget the rest, &#39;cause I&#39;m the best.<br>Turn on all the lights and worship me.<br>Why&#39;d you ave to go and waste your time on her?<br>Waste your time on me.&#39;<br><br><br>Watcha think? Suitable? It&#39;s by &#39;I Dream&#39;, just to let you know.</p>

            <p>Because you asked for it. ;p<br><br>Hmm... I think I will also give you a Pencil. Not a <i>pencil</i>, but a <i>Pencil</i>. Respect the capital. It can be used for writing charges, of course, but comes with the additional benefits of never needing to be sharpened, and turning into a steel-tipped stake when in direct contact with a Mary Sue&#39;s body. It also has your name scratched into the wooden shell. Enjoy!</p>

            <p>To get straight to the point: I&#39;m working through the second mission for my agents, and at one point they&#39;re walking through HQ corridors and just for atmosphere, I want them to say hellos to other agents passing by. I already have JulyFlame, but since I&#39;ve been working with Cirнchen on her background stories, I thought it&#39;d be nice to let her agents have a cameo, too. <br><br>But Ciri doesn&#39;t have Permission (yet).

            <p>Hi. So. I just got a LiveJournal recently to post missions and ramble on about my life, and I swear I have a mission coming soon, it&#39;s just really freaking long. <br><br><a href="http://sealrat.livejournal.com/"><a href="http://sealrat.livejournal.com/">http://sealrat.livejournal.com/</a></a><br><br>Feel free to stop by and say hi.<br><br>Now, onto the question. What&#39;s the policy on recruiting caon characters that have been pulled into massive crossovers and the like? I kind of wanted to nab someone for DoSAT. At the time the character would be pulled out of a world, she technically should have been in a completely different galazy anyway, so it would be like having a copy of herself around, and not the original. Canon would continue as it was intended, and all would be well. Is this acceptable? <br><br>I know there were a few other canons pulled out like Dafydd(spelling?), but I just wanted to check.</p>

            <p>The unwritten policy on pulling canons is that they have to be character replacements, not the actual canon character. Dafydd was meant to be Maglor, but wasn&#39;t really. Paddlebrains thinks of herself as Sirius Black, but clearly isn&#39;t the canonical version. Exceptions have been made only if the character is canonically dead with no chance of returning, as with Agent Suicide and Team Phoenix. It&#39;s better if they&#39;re more obscure characters, too. If the character is definitely the character and she&#39;s still alive in her own canon, even presumed missing, it&#39;s probably best not to recruit her.<br><br>Is it directly stated that she was pulled from someplace she wasn&#39;t supposed to be?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>She&#39;s in an RP that&#39;s basically a universal crossover point, with at least twenty-seven different worlds contributing characters. It&#39;s not a bad RP, really, but it&#39;s a dying site. I don&#39;t know if that counts as &#39;canon&#39; or not, since she&#39;s pretty IC, but definitely not where she&#39;s supposed to be.

            <p>No, she isn&#39;t in a fic, it&#39;s just the RP site. A few PPC agents are also on it, and we&#39;ve written little side fics that occasionally include her when we get bored, but this would just be pulling her from the RP site/verse/thingy, not a specific fic. If, of course, that is deemed acceptable.</p>

            <p>First: Where is this site?

Central-crossover-point RPs are not uncommon, and I don&#39;t think being in one--or a good AU fic, for that matter--should constitute grounds for recruitment by itself. I mean, I&#39;ve been in a RP like that myself, and my two canons are both canonically dead as well as AU, but I still wouldn&#39;t recruit them. (The fact that they are the Phantom of the Opera and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde has something to do with it, but still.)<br><br>If other people want to offer their opinions at this point, I&#39;d appreciate it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><u>She&#39;s brave.  She&#39;s graceful.  She hasn&#39;t got a stitch on.</u>  <br><br>Many OCs we see shoved awkwardly into fanfic fit this description:<br><br>Mary Sue the Warrior is well known for unrealistic clothing, but you&#39;d think that she&#39;d at least cover up enough so that her vital areas aren&#39;t exposed in battle.  Not so.  While Warrior Sue is often armed to the perfect sparkling teeth with swords too heavy and weapons too awkwardly placed to reach, she fails to dress in the kind of outfit that would actually protect her from harm.  <br>Armor and fighter clothes must be practical before they can be aesthetic.  Gauntlets are not something you put on because they make you look sexy when you fight.  Also, long flowing hair isn&#39;t a good idea—it&#39;s liable to get caught, pulled, or blown in one&#39;s face, obscuring the vision.  <br><br>Why doesn&#39;t her profession come before her perm?<br>_____<br><br>The physical description is just the tip of the iceberg, but since we can all remember instances of more painful canon warping, I thought I&#39;d let you off easy.<br><br>The sad thing is, the woman warrior has the potential to be a symbol of power and independence for women.  It can possibly break a lot of molds around stereotypes of women. Yet Suethors take the idea and turn it into one big cliche. Even worse, these strong-willed women are usually bashed or warped in fanfiction, which makes them into weeping romantics or violent femme fatales. <br><br>Now, considering how much we all love <i>good</i> stories, we must have run into really awesome warrior women in our reading or viewing the canon we love.  So, PPCers...let us know how it <i>should</i> be done!  (You can name someone from literature/movies/TV, or even a goodfic OC, if there&#39;s one to be found.  Historical figures, unless they&#39;re from historical fiction, don&#39;t count.) Pick a non-Sue woman warrior, and show the canon love.  I&#39;ll post this to the PPC LJ entry after we&#39;re done.<br><br>I will, of course, contribute myself, but I want to see what you guys come up with. </p>

            <p>... but the character of Sentinel Sarah Lyons from Fallout 3 certainly stands out as an intereting example. She&#39;s down to earth, frank (in her own manner) and she&#39;s no slouch in a fight (though that full-body suit of T-45 power armour and her decade or so of training certainly helps). Heck, she&#39;s even in a position of power - commander of an elite strike force of the Brotherhood of Steel and the second-highest ranking person within her chapter.<br><br>Best of all, in my opinion - she may fight alongside you if you are of good heart, but SHE ISN&#39;T A ROMANCE OPTION (sorry for the caps). This was one of the first occasions in my 10 or so years of video-gaming life when I found this cliche broken in a role-playing game. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure whether I could cite any particular faults, but one that can stand out is her fool-hardyness - she&#39;s  generally level-headed, but dangle a crisis in front of her and she&#39;ll be filing a request for an asignment instantly to her superiors. This, more often then not, causes her to have to speak with her father (the Eldar of the chapter, no less) and she usually is convinced to stand down.</p>

            <p>Katara, from Avatar the Last Airbender.  Admittedly, she goes around in some pretty aesthetically-pleasing costumes, but most of them are flexible so as to be functional when waterbending.  She&#39;s beautiful, smart, a master of her element, and she managed to transcend some ugly gender stereotypes in her art.  She also has a hot temper, but she doesn&#39;t get away with mouthing off by any means.  She has made some horrible choices in men, resulting in a couple messy break-ups, but instead of laying around feeling angsty about her life, she learns from her mistakes and eventually ends up with one of the most decent guys on the show.  All in all, she&#39;s awesome.<br><br>From the same show, there&#39;s Toph Bei Fong.  She&#39;s also a pretty young woman, and she&#39;s overcome her blindness by developing an awesome method of echolocation, even managing to bend metal, previously unheard of in earthbending.  She still makes little mistakes due to blindness (like pinning up posters backward), but when she realizes she makes them, she owns up to them and goes on with life.  She possesses a cruel sense of humor, which her friends call her out on even though she&#39;s completely unrepentant, and she&#39;s very bull-headed, which leads to some justifiable tension in the group.  But she doesn&#39;t make excuses for herself because she is blind or because she&#39;s a girl or because she has a very bad past with her parents...rather, she owns her issues, and grows as a person because of it.<br><br>Ooh, my newly-developed ATLA obsession is showing.  But while I&#39;m here...<br><br>Fujioka Haruhi of Ouran High School Host Club.  At the beginning of the story, she is a commoner who is admitted into a very prestigious high school for rich kids, because she did the hard work and earned a scholarship to go there.  She comes into a school with short hair and somewhat androgynous looks, and everybody thinks she&#39;s a boy.  Then, she&#39;s found out by the local club of extremely gorgeous man-meat boys, and, since she owes them several thousand yen&#39;s worth of favors, she is compelled to work for them, disguising herself as a boy.  Secretly, all the boys are in love with her, each in their own way, but they treat her like an equal instead of putting her on a pedestal (except for one, but he&#39;s a bit nuts).  She&#39;s not a romantic at all, settles into the club like she would a job, and tries not to let her secret out...by which is meant that she doesn&#39;t go around matchmaking, but actually, genuinely, tries to avoid any unnecessary attention whatsoever.  Eventually, the club needs her dry sense of humor and down-to-earth personality just to keep running.  And she&#39;s awesome!</p>

            <p>C.C, Kallen, Cornelia, Sayako and Anya from <i>Code Geass</i> are all strong warriors, in their different disciplines (ninja!Sayako FTW). Not to mention the fact that C.C seems to be completely frikin immortal and has the healing ability of Wolverine. <br><br>Relena, Noin, Sally, Hilde, Dorothy and Une from <i>Gundam Wing</i> are all strong women, even if they&#39;re not all warriors in the traditional sense. Relena especially, has the strength to try and change the world even while everything is falling apart around her.<br><br>Sumeragi, Nena and Soma from <i>Gundam 00</i> are all strong as well.

            <p>Kerowyn, Mercedes Lackey&#39;s Valdemar books.  Mercenary captain (it took her an altogether appropriate length of time to train and work her way to that position), Herald of Valdemar, owner of a magic sword that&#39;s really inconvenient to its bearer.  The pb cover annoys me (to the extent that I wrote a term paper on it), because the picture has her in a silly, silly suit of armor with long flowing hair, etc. that she would never wear.<br><br>Likewise her teacher, the Shin&#39;a&#39;in Tarma.  Goddess-bonded warrior.  Celibate, sarcastic swordswoman.<br><br>Mirax Terrik, Star Wars.  She&#39;s primarily a smuggler, but her cleverness, resource, and common sense sometimes end up in a firefight, where she keeps her cool well.<br><br>Polly Perks, Discworld.  She is a soldier.  That&#39;s really all there is to it.  She is a successful (i.e. passing) crossdresser, but doesn&#39;t turn into a bombshell when in girly clothes.<br><br><br>---<br>I would just like to put in a plug for a series of anthologies related to this.  The first is called &quot;Chicks in Chainmail&quot; and they are edited by Esther Friesner.  They deal with exactly this topic--how to write the warrior woman without turning her into a pinup girl or losing her sense of humor.  They&#39;re hilarious, frankly, and well written.</p>

            <p>Kylara Vatta (<i>Vatta&#39;s War</i>; Elizabeth Moon) attended Space Force Academy and then, sometime in her last semester, got kicked out for political reasons. She rejoins her family&#39;s space shipping business shortly before it is attacked and nearly destroyed by a coalition of pirates, whom she eventually manages to build up a force to defeat. Also, she often wears a spacesuit (really the only thing reasonable when you&#39;re in a spaceship that could get blown up).<br><br>Paksenarrion Dorthansdotter (<i>The Deed of Paksenarrion</i>; Elizabeth Moon) A shepherd&#39;s daughter fleeing an unwanted marriage joins a mercenary company. The books were written as a rebuttal to how the author was told paladins in role-playing games were often played, so Paks is unfailingly humble and, though she eventually succeds at most of her aims, goes through a lot of grief (including four straight days of torture).<br><br>Firekeeper (<i>Firekeeper Saga</i>; Jane Lindskold) A girl raised by (sentient) wolves is found by an expedition that set out to find the village founded by a disinherited prince (because his father is getting old, his siblings are dead, and his daughter is technically the next in succession). Her only posessions are a dagger and a set of flint and steel, both of which she is quite proficient at using. Although she is clever, she&#39;s also quite savage and has several opportunities to learn the value of armor. (Naturally, growing up in a forest had already taught her the value of short hair, and she did have that dagger to cut with.)<br><br>There was someone else, whom I will doubtless remember as soon as I post.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to list both Kathryn Janeway and B&#39;Ellana Torres of Star Trek Voyager. And Karrin Murphy of Dresden Files. I&#39;ve only (nearly) read one of the books, but I think she would qualify.<br><br>All three women have in common that they are strong, but also have their weaknesses, which they try to cover up to prevent from being exploited. You know, like real women do.<br><br>There are warrior!Sues in the fandoms I read in, but since those fandoms are about 20th/21st century Earth based military (like) these Sues generally manage to wear something appropriate in battle.</p>

            <p>I already mentioned Captain Unohana but there&#39;s also Yaone from Saiyuki and Meilin from Card Captor Sakura. Both of them tend to play second to their male teammate(s) in battle but they both have strong hearts and are perfectly capable of defending themselves. Though Yaone&#39;s outfit is some cause for concern it isn&#39;t nearly as bad as some Warrior Sue&#39;s. Meilin doesn&#39;t have any magic yet she still follows Syaoran to Japan to capture the Clow Cards and her martial art skills are very strong. But more than that she has a strong personality. She&#39;s very determined but also rather kind (even to Sakura, who she thinks it Syaoran&#39;s rival and there for an opponent). To me a strong female character isn&#39;t just defined by how good she is in battle. If we take battle ability out of the equation I&#39;d like to throw  another name into the pot: Yuuko Ichihara.<br><br>Oh, I just thought of a real Warrior Woman. Android 18 from DBZ. She beat Vegeta easily and she did it without being a &#39;Sue.</p>

            <p>I already had quite a bit of respect for her but after Syaoran told her he liked Sakura... She handled that very well, didn&#39;t she? Wished him the best and waited until she was safely in Tomoyo&#39;s arms to burst into tears. She even gave Syaoran advice and gave Sakura hints that he liked her! The female characters who are in love with male characters destined to end up with another are very rarely handle rejection well and are very rarely even taken seriously. I was happy with Meilin. I can&#39;t believe she never showed up in TRC.<br><br><br>I am not surprised you cannot explain your admiration of Yuuko. It&#39;s difficult enough explaining Yuuko at all.</p>

            <p>Tamora Pierce was who I thought of first, particularly Kel. I think Kel sorta fits the exact model all authors should aim for with women warriors (In Middle Age Time Periods anyway). She had to work damn hard to gain her skills, and even then she sucks at a few.<br>I think Rosethorn and Daja can also fit into this category. While Rosethorn doesn&#39;t actually fight with martial weapons, she does kick ass when it comes to magical fighting, something which took her years to do as well. Lark confuses me, because she has one of the idealic &#39;Sue pasts. Came to her magic late, but turns out to be a Great Mage... Go figure.<br>Daja really goes without saying. While she does use her magic to fight, it isn&#39;t often. If anything, she uses it only for her own, small conveniences, like adjusting her body temperature. She&#39;s a fair fighter. She sorta offsets the &#39;Sueish traits that Tris and Sandry have too.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s interesting how Tamora Pierce can write well-rounded characters aimed at mid-teens and young adults, but when she attempted to reach a younger audience with Daine&#39;s series she ended up with an illegitimate-and-angsty, animal-speaking, CAF-toting, super-archer, half-immortal, oh-so-pretty, loved-by-all Uber-Sue. (At least Thayet has minimal book time in the Lioness Quartet.) Pierce should have just called Daine &quot;Greek Goddess Artemis 2.0&quot; and been done with it. <br><br>Plus, a 16-year-old girl with her 30-year-old <i>tutor</i>? Mmmmm, not exactly my cup of tea.  <br><br>In my book, Daine&#39;s relation with Tortall is kind of like Wesley Crusher&#39;s relation with Star Trek.  Though another thing that&#39;s bothered me as I&#39;ve aged is the plethora of Generic Locations and Generic Beasts in the former universe.<br>(It should have a deathmatch with Forgotten Realms.)</p>

            <p>...the whole Daine/Numair pairing is...creepy. <br><br>Though another character I like muchly is Onua (though most of the time she&#39;s just there to compliment Daine...). She&#39;s a lot like Buri, though not quite as awesome. ;-)</p>

            <p>Rukia, Soifon, Yoruichi, Halibel and Matsumoto from <i>Bleach</i> are all good female warriors. They&#39;re strong, capable of holding their own against the men of the series and most of them hold quite high ranks. Armour isn&#39;t really an issue, since it&#39;s a rare thing for someone in <i>Bleach</i> canon to wear armour, but they do mostly cover up/wear the same uniforms as the males around them.<br><br>Sakura, Tsunade, Tenten, Temari and Hinata from <i>Naruto</i> can also hold their own against men that are considered as strong or stronger than them. They&#39;re not push overs, and woe betide anyone who thinks they are. Again, they don&#39;t wear the kind of skimpy clothes that you&#39;d see a Sue wearing (except in bad fanfics where they&#39;re sleeping with every man in sight).<br><br>The Weyrwomen of the <i>Pern</i> series aren&#39;t warriors in the traditional sense of the word, but they do fight to protect their world from a deadly threat, so I&#39;ll count them here. Lessa, Moreta and Sorka especially stand out amongst them. They&#39;re level-headed and mentally strong enough to handle riding a queen dragon, with all the responsibility that entails. </p>

            <p>Yes, we haven&#39;t actually seen her fight but we&#39;ve seen her bankai and we know she&#39;s powerful. She rules her division with an iron fist (even the 11th is scared of her) yet her division still loves her and she clearly loves them. She&#39;s strong, intelligent, independent, one of the oldest captains and she never even threatens a single soul while carrying out her duty.

            <p>I think there are more than enough &quot;symbols of power and independance&quot; for women around.

It seems like the pendulum has swung too far.<br><br>That said, I do like strong female characters. The one whom most fits your description is B&#39;Elanna Torres from <i>Star Trek: Voyager</i>, but the one I most admire in terms of being a strong woman is Mara from Raymond E Feist and Janny Wurts&#39; <i>Empire</i> series - she makes her victories by being clever politically, and has no skill at all with weapons. I like that. On a similar note, I love Yvaine from <i>Stardust</i> - the movie adaptation more than the book, but still. She is a fiercely strong-willed character, but I like that she keeps her strength without ever picking up a weapon (though she does wield her &#39;Super Shine Powers&#39; (thankfully not referred to as such) to defeat an enemy).<br><br>Hm, I ramble. And aside from B&#39;Elanna, I don&#39;t think this is what you wanted. Still, I wanted to say it. I like warrior women - I&#39;d call myself one - but I tend to avoid them because from what I see in society today, I think it&#39;s overkill. We know women can be strong; what&#39;s unexplored is how strength, how the ability to fight and win, doesn&#39;t require weapons or battle cries. There are many I would call warriors that don&#39;t fight.</p>

            <p><i>I think there are more than enough &quot;symbols of power and independance&quot; for women around.</i> <br><br>Really? I&#39;d argue that there aren&#39;t nearly enough, and so the few symbols we have do double duty, which just weighs them down under all our expectations.  Go to Rotten Tomatoes and look at the movies that have been released for this week.  How many have female leads whose character outshines their appearance? (You can even compare that to the numbers of male equivalents.) Furthermore, how many <i>collective</i> symbols of female power and independence have you seen?  Just by looking at the characters listed in this thread, I can tell that lots of these women are &quot;the girl&quot; of the team/regiment or, if not the lone warrior, are one of the few female warriors in that universe. That&#39;s not a very good indicator that warrior women are plentiful.<br><br>There is a sense in fandom that there are lots and lots of strong women in media, because people can now name five or six off the tops of their heads who really stand out. Unfortunately, the reason that a lot of these strong women are so <i>visible</i> is because they are so <i>isolated</i> in the sea of male characters that the human race has produced.<br><br>I&#39;d like you to do something for me. Go and write down your top 15 movies. Now, write down the following:<br><br>What percentage of the movies have strong and independent men in them? And women? (Please note that this can mean internal strength too, as well as other strength independent from firepower.)<br><br>What percentage of movies have only <i>one</i> strong and independent man? And women? Count how many characters of both sexes you would describe as strong. <br><br>What percentage have a token man who is the heroine&#39;s love interest? And token women?<br><br>What is the male-to-female ratio in each movie? <br><br>What percentage of the movies have men who are looked at not in terms of character, but in terms of appearance? And women? Count them all. (I&#39;m not asking if these people are sexualized <i>too</i>, I&#39;m asking if they&#39;re sexualized <i>first and foremost</i>.) <br><br>Now...and this is really sad...<br><br>Do the same, not for your top 15 movies, but for 15 movies you think have enough female chutzpah and strength to be called &quot;girl power&quot; movies. (Note that I&#39;m not calling them chick flicks; that&#39;s a different genre entirely.)<br><br>I guarantee you that even in most movies with a strong female lead, there is at least one capable male, and that in the majority of girl power movies, the strong and independent men STILL outnumber the strong and independent women!  And, hey, if you want to discount every movie made before the Women&#39;s Rights Movement, go right ahead. The results won&#39;t shift that much. <br><br>Are there still more than enough symbols of female power and independence?<br><br>That&#39;s just one medium, by the way.  There are <i>thousands of years</i> of literature behind us where women like Keladry and B&#39;Elanna cropped up once in a blue moon, where even internal strength in women was portrayed as rare.  Strong and independent women in fiction exist, oh yes they do, and always have.  But they are so heavily outweighed by the sheer numbers of strong and independent men (the ratio&#39;s probably about 500 to 1, taking into account all literature, fictional movies, TV, comics, legendary oral history, and heck, even folk songs) that they often get lost or are forced to become more in the public consciousness than they were ever meant to be by the author.<br><br>This is why years and years will pass before there are &quot;more than enough&quot; symbols of power and independence for women. This will only happen when those symbols outnumber <i>by a significant margin</i> all symbols of power and independence for men.<br><br>*toasts* Here&#39;s to you, 2800 A.D.!<br><br><i>Not to say that women don&#39;t deserve such thing, but quite frankly, we already have it, and I think a lot of women nowadays are throwing their victory into everyone else&#39;s faces. It seems like the pendulum has swung too far.</i><br><br>By &quot;victory&quot; I assume you mean the success of the women&#39;s movement. If I&#39;m mistaken, please feel free to correct me.  If I&#39;m not, how exactly does one throw one&#39;s hard-won civil rights into everyone&#39;s faces?  &quot;Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah, I get to vote now!&quot;? Besides, equality is really a victory for <i>everyone</i>, not just women.<br><br><i>That said, I do like strong female characters. The one whom most fits your description is B&#39;Elanna Torres from Star Trek: Voyager, but the one I most admire in terms of being a strong woman is Mara from Raymond E Feist and Janny Wurts&#39; Empire series - she makes her victories by being clever politically, and has no skill at all with weapons. I like that.</i> <br><br>I&#39;m familiar with (and have a soft spot in my heart for) B&#39;Elanna, and I&#39;ve never read Mara&#39;s adventures but have actually heard them cited elsewhere as a good example of a non-Sue, non-militaristic female.  It might have been Winterfox.  <br><br><i>I like warrior women - I&#39;d call myself one - but I tend to avoid them because from what I see in society today, I think it&#39;s overkill. We know women can be strong; what&#39;s unexplored is how strength, how the ability to fight and win, doesn&#39;t require weapons or battle cries. There are many I would call warriors that don&#39;t fight.</i><br><br>Of course there are, and I could say the same.  Arms-bearing women are just the easiest to contrast with Warrior Sues, the latter being the most visible female character clichй in most badfic.  (I count wand-dueling as warring, by the way.) I&#39;d argue that the existence of Warrior Sue is due to the fact that, even if there <i>are</i> many strong female characters, the proportion of these in comparison to men is so skewed that a lot of Suethors aren&#39;t <i>exposed</i> to enough of them and taught to value them. At the same time, as 21st century writers, Suethors subconsciously feel the need to reduce the huge gender imbalance that plagues virtually every genre and medium.  In other words, they <i>want</i> true strong female characters, but aren&#39;t knowledgeable enough either to write one <i>or</i> to appreciate one when one comes along.  Add this to raging hormones and the influence of Canon Sues that they idolize, and the result is a bizarre chimera--misandrist and sex object--that we agents encounter and slay on a regular basis.<br><br>~Araeph<br></p>

            <p>You&#39;re absolutely right about films and such; I hate them, and tend to ignore them, and while I was thinking of non-story social treatment, I should not have used the word &quot;symbol&quot;. The thread below this sort of outlines the point I was trying to get at, but I did so badly in this first post, so I apologise. I should&#39;ve gone back and rephrased myself. <br><br>Among other things, I DESPISE the fact that movies never seem to have women that aren&#39;t thin and sexy - or men that aren&#39;t handsome. Sexuality may sell, but it makes the rest of us feel horrible, and I would love to turn the fashion industry on its ear... but I&#39;ll not get into this discussion, because I will literally never shut up. In short, you&#39;re right again, Araeph, and I humbly bow at your feet. I didn&#39;t mean to imply otherwise. <br><br><br><i>By &quot;victory&quot; I assume you mean the success of the women&#39;s movement. If I&#39;m mistaken, please feel free to correct me. If I&#39;m not, how exactly does one throw one&#39;s hard-won civil rights into everyone&#39;s faces? &quot;Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah, I get to vote now!&quot;? Besides, equality is really a victory for everyone, not just women.</i><br><br>It should be, and yes I did mean the women&#39;s movement, but what I was getting at is that a lot of women seem to misunderstand what gender equality actually means; now both genders have the right to work any job they want, but that doesn&#39;t mean every woman can have a great career AND raise a family. Equality on that front gave women a CHOICE of what they wanted from their lives, not the ability to have everything, and from what I see around me, many seem to be blind to that. Then they go complaining about unfairness of little details because they&#39;re stressed by trying to have a good job and a family at the same time. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible, of course, just taken to be what every woman is entitled to have . <br><br>Sorry, I&#39;ve gone off on a tanget. By &quot;throwing in faces&quot; I meant that men are often getting the short end of the deal in situations such as custody cases because a lot of women throw around the &quot;I&#39;m a woman and if you don&#39;t support me you&#39;re gender biased!&quot; card. They forget that by making that very claim, they&#39;re being gender biased themselves. I didn&#39;t mean to imply that all women do such things, but it does happen.<br><br><br><i> I&#39;ve never read Mara&#39;s adventures but have actually heard them cited elsewhere as a good example of a non-Sue, non-militaristic female.</i><br><br>Mara&#39;s interesting. I rather like her, though I only read the five boosk by Timothy Zahn, and refuse to touch any of the other Star Wars EU books. She is militarisitic, though, in some ways; she was a trained assassin for the Emperor, and her targets were mostly political. A lot of her behaviour has (or HAD, as she did grow) straightforward, highly efficient mannerisms that people can associate with military training. That said, she never felt like a Sue to me, and I appreciate her character.<br><br><br><i>as 21st century writers, Suethors subconsciously feel the need to reduce the huge gender imbalance that plagues virtually every genre and medium. In other words, they want true strong female characters, but aren&#39;t knowledgeable enough either to write one or to appreciate one when one comes along.</i><br><br>EXACTLY. Exactly, exactly, exactly. Which makes it all the more of a shame when they create bad stereotypes.<br><br>- Sedri</p>

            <p>More than two years late, I realise that I confused two characters by the name of &quot;Mara&quot; here - when I first mentioned the name, upthread, I was referring to Mara of the Acoma, from the Feist/Wurts <i>Empire</i> series. The second time, in the second post, I must have been befuddled, because I was talking about Mara Jade from the <i>Star Wars</i> EU. Heh. <br><br>Well, I imagine no one will notice this now, nor care, since this thread is so old that no one will ever see the update. Still, I wanted to say it. :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m with you, Sedri--I&#39;m all for female empowerment, but I draw the line when, for example, feminism is almost the only method of literary analysis I hear about in my Lit classes. Sometimes enough is enough.<br><br>That said, I can think of one author who consistently writes good, strong, capable, and yet feminine women leads, and that is Sherri S. Tepper. Some of her work is distinctly feminist (<i>The Gate to Women&#39;s Country</i>), but most of it (<i>The Family Tree</i>; <i>Grass</i>; <i>Shadow&#39;s End</i>) simply has so much going on in the social, religious, scientific, and near-fantastical aspects that you can&#39;t help but be sucked in by the sheer complexity of it. I&#39;d recommend her to anybody.<br><br>I don&#39;t think women need to be macho to be as strong as men. Men and women have different strengths and weaknesses. We need to accept that.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who finds really good women leads hard to come by.</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s hard to find the balance. I mean, we&#39;re dealing with centuries of gender roles on the one hand--the ones that say good women are good mothers, homemakers, etc.--and the new feminism on the other hand, which says good women should be able and even want to do everything that men do. If you get a female character behaving like the classic woman, she&#39;s weak or at best oppressed according to the new standards; but if you get a female character behaving like a man, she&#39;s too outspoken, too forward, unfeminine, etc., by the old standards. There&#39;s a place in between, but it&#39;s hard to get there.<br><br>I think it&#39;s a mistake to completely devalue the old standards, even as we move forward and add new ones, like intelligence, ability, and self-confidence. It&#39;s a mistake to exclude anyone from becoming strong in any area if that&#39;s their nature, and that includes men.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is neither girly nor tomboyish, but her own brand of human person.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s kind of a fact of fandom that there are fewer male writers, thus fewer male OCs, and thus fewer Gary-Stus. But yeah, female OCs are more suspect, chiefly because there are more of them and the majority are poorly-written.<br><br>On the flip side, there are (or were--I guess I don&#39;t really know) fewer female leads in published fiction, and we have higher expectations for them because of all the stuff that&#39;s going on in this thread.<br><br>There&#39;s also the fact that the term &quot;Mary-Sue&quot; is associated with female characters, and is a relatively well-known term.

            <p>An overabundance of Soppy Male Leads, I mean. I can&#39;t think of any offhand, but I can&#39;t imagine it would sit better with me than the Overly-Macho Male Lead. I think the Stallone and Schwarzenegger character types are gross, frankly. Again, it&#39;s all about balance. I&#39;d like my boyfriend to feel strongly enough about me to clock someone who was bothering me (if I didn&#39;t do it first myself), but I wouldn&#39;t like him to feel like he had to be a bruiser to be a good man. Similarly, I&#39;d want him to be able to recognize and express his emotions, but  not let them rule every moment of his life.<br><br>The best character I know who might be described as macho is Ka D&#39;Argo from Farscape. He&#39;s big, he&#39;s tough, he&#39;s gruff, he&#39;ll sock you as soon as look at you if you cross him... and we learn that his secret ambition is to start a family and settle down on a farm.
