            <p>I was browsing through some SPN fics tonight, and I happened to run across this fic called &quot;Vessels.&quot; And it gives me creepy feelings. The grammar isn&#39;t spectacular if understandable and the characters all feel really off-kilter. Also, the writer inexplicably spells &quot;Lilith&quot; with a y. The little obsessive-compulsive almost-English-major within me is jumping up and down screaming &quot;NO NO NO LYLITH JUST SOUNDS STUPID NO NO NO,&quot; etc.<br><br>Still, I&#39;m very new to the fandom--I can count the number of episodes I&#39;ve seen on my fingers. So I was wondering if someone better acquainted with the series could give this fic a look over and maybe tell me if it should go up on Unclaimed Badfic.<br><br>Here&#39;s the link: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4601292/1/Vessels"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4601292/1/Vessels">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4601292/1/Vessels</a></a> <br><br>Incidentally, I took a glance at some of the other stories listed under her profile, and they have <i>scary</i> descriptions. This one called &quot;Harry Potter and the Chalice&quot; caught my eye. Warnings include (I quote) &quot;slash, rape, mpreg, lots of death and blood duh its got vampires every where&quot;. I opened the link out of sheer curiosity, got to the point where Harry gets a letter from someone named Serenity Snape, and then my brain shut down. And began melting when I read a bit more. This is just the first chapter. There are twenty-two chapters total. OH GOD KILL IT NOW MAKE THE PAIN GO AWAY SOMEONE PLEASE.<br><br>Link for this fic is here:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2556961/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chalice"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2556961/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chalice">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2556961/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chalice</a></a> </p>

            <p>Preferably DMS, I&#39;d think. The Floaters seem to be getting a lot of the recent missions. And yeah, there are OCs all over the place, especially the Sue (any chance I can bribe whoever takes it to kill the whole mess of OCs instead of just the Sue? :P). For once Bad Slash doesn&#39;t have to squick themselves out, but the fic needs killing.</p>

            <p>No, all the Torchwood missions are both reported and claimed by you. And I have to take it slow with the throwing new fandoms at Trojie, although she does agree that Captain Jack is fine. I imagine she may change her mind if she sees him pregnant, however.<br><br>The Division of MPreg would be a subset of the DBS, rather than an entirely new department. Basically, there&#39;s enough badslash out there as it is, without counting the mpreg, and also Agent!Trojie is likely to have a breakdown if she has to deal with much more of it. So the new division would mean she gets a break rather than a breakdown.</p>

            <p>so not much of that gets reported by me because for simple reasons of avoidance I don&#39;t see any badslash.<br><br>Found the one where Owen did five pregnancy tests on himself.

            <p>and making the head of the Division of Mpreg be the Ginkgo - almost all ginkgos in gardens etc are cloned males, because the female tree&#39;s fruit are smelly, and so considered undesirable. Given that mpreg authors think that women being involved in the equation anywhere is undesirable, I thought it&#39;d be an appropriate plant. Thoughts?</p>

            <p>I had a thought for a division of Floaters: namely, the Plothole Division. This is mostly a joke, as it&#39;s mostly inspired by games of Fill the Plothole, and is mostly an excuse for me to justify what Nume was doing for all the years before he switched to the DIC, but it could be a sound idea, too. The way I imagine it, there are stories out there that aren&#39;t really awful, but that are a few plotholes shy of really being decent. Suppose there were teams of agents whose job it was to actually fill the plotholes. It would be a nice job for newbies to start out in, and it would be someplace to put agents not really suited to more difficult or dangerous missions where they could still do some good. They might also have to clean up after other departments sometimes--if someone left a bottle of Bleeprin behind, or something like that. Thoughts?<br><br>As for the Department of Overkill, I seem to recall talking about it and deciding there aren&#39;t enough missions of that caliber to warrant a department for them. It seems to me their job would just be to coordinate things, which happens anyway. Also, the idea of a Flower like that is a little scary. <sup>_<sup>;</sup></sup> Who would want to work for it?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So I was browsing Wikipedia the other day when I ran across the article on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faberg%C3%A9_egg">Fabergй eggs</a>. After reading the article and the various things linked from it, I had two thoughts.<br><br>1/ Some of those eggs are <a href="http://www.mieks.com/faberge-en/1895-12-Monogram-Egg.htm">really</a> <a href="http://www.mieks.com/faberge-en/1913-Winter-Egg.htm">beautiful</a>.<br><br>2/ <i>This should have been fiction.</i><br><br>Seriously. The story goes like this: the Tsar of Russia loves his wife so much that every year, for Easter, he gives her a horrifyingly expensive egg crafted by the finest jeweller in the land. Each one is unique, and each has an exquisitely crafted surprise inside it. When he dies, his son continues the tradition, giving them not only to his own wife, but also to his father&#39;s widow -- every year, without fail, another two eggs, another two surprises, and all of them stunning.<br><br>There is <i>no way</i> that sort of thing happens in real life. It&#39;s the kind of thing you put into a book to demonstrate how kind and generous your king is; it shouldn&#39;t have actually <i>happened</i>.<br><br>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not the only example, though. So who else has some random historical trivia that Should Have Been Fiction? What would you never believe if you read it in a novel -- but it actually happened that way? I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all got something.<br><br>hS, trying to start a thread</p>

            <p>Okay, so this young Jewish boy is in a concentration camp during the Holocaust. His mother was immediately gassed upon coming to the place, but he dreams about her often. One night, she tells him that she&#39;s going to send him an angel. So one day, he sees this little girl hiding behind a tree right outside the camp&#39;s fence, just watching everything that&#39;s going on. And then she takes an apple out of her pocket and throws it over the fence to him, and he catches it and runs off before the guards see. Every day, she comes back and sneaks him food, and though they never speak, he starts calling her his &quot;Angel Girl&quot;. Then, one day, the boy gets shipped to another camp, and figures he&#39;ll never see her again. <br><br>After liberation, the boy goes to America. It&#39;s been fifteen years since he was in the camp, and his friends arrange a blind date for him. He and the lady get to talking about their lives in Europe. She was Jewish, but her family had posed as Christians to escape the Nazis. He tells her about this little girl who threw him apples while he was in the concentration camp.<br><br>Turns out, she&#39;s the exact same girl. <br><br>Six months later, they got married, and they&#39;re still living happily after today.<br><br><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/20/earlyshow/main4532220.shtml"><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/20/earlyshow/main4532220.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/20/earlyshow/main4532220.shtml</a></a> </p>

            <p>Two palaeontologists who started as friends, even naming species after each other ... and then became rivals. Even enemies. These guys used to bribe quarry owners to spy and attempted to blow up each other&#39;s fossil localities. In the process of chasing each other up and down the country in an attempt to be the better palaeontologist, they discovered between them almost every dinosaur you could call &#39;famous&#39;. <br><br>And the other ones were mostly discovered by Gideon Mantell. And his story would have made fantastic fiction; a poor country doctor became so consumed by his passion for fossils and geology that he lost his wife, his children, his home, his job ... and ended up making an enemy of Richard Owen, who plagiarised his work, had him refused membership of learned societies ... and when Mantell finally died, got possession of the poor man&#39;s twisted spine as an anatomical curiosity, because Owen was in charge of a museum. Oh, and he wrote a very nasty bitchy anonymous obituary for Mantell as well. Of course, it bit him in the arse because his behaviour to Mantell was so despicable that he lost his own position at the various learned societies ...</p>

Back when they used fire for stage lighting, most dancers doused their costumes in fire-retardent liquid (I don&#39;t remember exactly what) because, well, get too close and it&#39;s up in flames. However, some dancers ignored this because it made their costumes look &quot;dingy,&quot; or something to that effect.<br><br>You can guess what happened the next time they danced too close to the lights.<br><br>Also, IMO, the amount of things Windows will choose to crash over is almost comical.</p>

            <p>Hey, sorry if this bothers you lot, I&#39;ve just been wondering about something so I thought I&#39;d ask. I hope it doesn&#39;t seem too stupid. Permission isn&#39;t needed for (out of lack of a better term) &quot;NPC&quot; agents, is it? Agents that are named or whatever and interacted with, but aren&#39;t actually the agents you write missions with, strictly background characters? I&#39;m asking that partly because while I don&#39;t think it&#39;s needed I&#39;m also not sure and thus curious about if it&#39;s the case, but also because part of my writing sample involves one of my agents interacting with one of the mentioned &quot;NPC&quot; type agents, and I&#39;d be in a good bit of trouble if it turns out that&#39;s not allowed. Just one of those cases where I&#39;m a bit confused about it and want to know for sure where the policy stands. I thought Permission was only needed for your main agents and the missions, but if I&#39;m wrong (and this doesn&#39;t seem to be covered on the wiki page) I thought I should ask. Thanks for your time.</p>

            <p>Wasn&#39;t sure where to put this in the topic, so I&#39;m just sticking it near the top. Anyway, I know I&#39;ve had a lot over the past couple days, they just keep popping up in my mind. I&#39;ll probably cut down on them soon, I&#39;ve just had a lot of things I&#39;ve wondered. I&#39;m only asking questions I don&#39;t think have actually been addressed in the actual stories, but if they have (other than my &quot;where can I find story x&quot; question earlier) I&#39;m sorry, I just haven&#39;t seen the mission or story in question in that case. :P Anyway, not sure if it&#39;s been covered, but about how much contact with the outside world would one say Agents are allowed? Like, not just emails or calls (since mail has been referenced with the Postal Department), but occasional leave and the like. I&#39;d assume very little or none, especially in the case of (again for lack of a better term) &quot;shore leave&quot; in the world out of HQ (which sounds like it&#39;d be mostly a reward or something), but so far in all the stories I&#39;ve read (by now I&#39;ve read quite a few, but not every one) I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen it directly referenced or answered.<br><br>  Also, one that&#39;s always bugged me is about the New Caledonia city itself. Wouldn&#39;t the French government (hell, even people of New Caledonia, or whoever owns the first spy satellite to orbit near it) kind of <i>notice</i> a new, presumably large, city sprouting up in their territory and investigate? Sounds like the sort of thing that&#39;d blow the PPC&#39;s cover wide open, especially if the HQ entrance in the mountains is also found. My first thought was an SEP Field on the entrance and city, but it&#39;d have to be a really big field to cover a whole city, and unless it was there from day one I&#39;d think someone would go, &quot;hey, it looks like somebody&#39;s building a new city, did we commission one to be made there?&quot;. And then there&#39;s the issue of roads possibly leading there. Just something that&#39;s been on my mind about that, I never for the life of me could figure why the PPC city in New Caledonia never brought down the world&#39;s governments on it, either with troops or simply delegates there to ask just WTF is going on. Technology as it is now (though PPC tech seems way more advanced than World One tech), building a city without anyone noticing just doesn&#39;t happen. I don&#39;t mean it rudely, that one&#39;s just always been on my mind. Fridge Logic, if you will.</p>

            <p>I tend to ignore New Caledonia. It doesn&#39;t do my stories any good, it doesn&#39;t jibe with my concept of what the PPC is, it&#39;s not OS canon, and it&#39;s not universally accepted, so I don&#39;t really feel a need to make references to its existence.

            <p>I was just curious about how it actually worked, because it confused me how the PPC could build a city there without attracting attention, and the contact example was only drafted out of lack of a better one, since I was wondering (especially due to a possible plan of mine for a character thing, not as in a new character but as in a character development type thing) about where official policy stood on it. Figured there was no harm in asking.</p>

            <p>It doesn&#39;t even have to be on the entire city, just the walls, or things.

            <p>In reply to question one, it&#39;s become a standing joke of sorts. As proclaimed by Acacia herself, &#39;“Off duty? What is this off duty? Is it possible that, only being here two years, I’ve missed the phenomenon?”&#39; As far as I know, it is a reward or something that has been demanded from the Flowers as a repayment for extreme stress. If I recall correctly, several Agents demanded time off after having to deal with That Series and other highly stressful missions.<br><br>As for the city, I lean strongly in the direction of a combination of magic and technology used for hiding things. I&#39;m sure the Flowers wouldn&#39;t have been careless enough to let knowledge of the PPC become widespread across World One. A SEP-field would be useful, yes, but possibly other things are used as well. A chameleon circuit-type thing, like a TARDIS uses, to make the city look like a mountain? I&#39;m just throwing out random suggestions here, I&#39;m open to others.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s what I figured about actual leave (that is, outright leaving HQ, not including commuting between the New Caledonia city and HQ, for a period of time), part running gag and part reward, but what about simply contacting people on the &quot;outside&quot;? For example, would an Agent living in the NCC (New Caledonia City) be allowed to call or email a person they knew prior to joining? In HQ I&#39;d assume it&#39;s no contact allowed at all for security reasons, but that I wonder about too.<br><br>The city I don&#39;t actually know about, though I assume a definite solution hasn&#39;t been stated (?), though the mixture of SEP field and chameleon circuit would make sense. Look like a mountain, and then make sure nobody really notices said mountain with the SEP field. The Flowers would probably try to avoid directly contacting World One citizens for permission to build the city or something (heh, ultimate mental image), so it&#39;d make sense that they found some way to conceal it. That makes the whole city thing more plausible, but as said, I dunno if anyone&#39;s actually said anything concrete on the matter before. Unfortunately, New Caledonia isn&#39;t large enough to build a city in an ultra remote location where nobody would notice, and even then someone would eventually come across it. Bit of an odd problem.</p>

            <p>contacting people is never actually mentioned, really. I hadn&#39;t thought it would be banned, and part of my Agents&#39; backstories involves a couple of letters Agent Cassie wrote to her parents the day before she joined and a few days after her first mission. They&#39;re not published yet or anything, but she&#39;s been in HQ since her first day, so I assumed contact between the outside world and HQ wasn&#39;t banned.

            <p>The way I&#39;ve understood it is that you ask permission to write/post ppc missions. You do not ask for permission on specific agents. Meaning, you do not have to reapply for permission if you decide to start working with a different agent, or introduce cameo agents in your stories.<br><br>The writing sample is to show you have a decent enough grasp of grammar and punctuation as to not embarrass the PPC. You don&#39;t need permission for the actual content of the writing sample (well, perhaps you would if you want to use other people&#39;s agents in that writing sample, but I don&#39;t think your question was about that.).</p>

            <p>I was more concerned about people thinking my question was stupid than being offended by me even asking, though. :P Still, I appreciate the help, I was at a loss about that. Anyway, while I&#39;m on the issue of questions, do you or anyone else know where the Mirror Multiverse or Macrovirus epidemic stories are? I&#39;d be interested in reading them, but I don&#39;t know where to find them and didn&#39;t see them on the PPC fiction list. I don&#39;t need the original Mary Sue invasion RP, because the movie script&#39;s pretty much word for word what happened, but I&#39;ve always been curious about just what happened in those others.</p>

            <p>Assuming you follow the river (which in the days before SatNav and tarmac roads is the only way to be sure you get there) it&#39;s thirty miles or so from the Halls to Esgaroth-on-the-Long-Lake. Apparently a horse&#39;s trotting speed is 5-10 mph, which means that&#39;s a day&#39;s travel or a little less (accounting for terrain, trees, escort, anything you&#39;re bringing with you, random spider attacks, and lunch). From Esgaroth, it&#39;s then <i>another</i> thirty miles to Dale. Pushing your horse, and/or switching horses at Esgaroth, it&#39;s just conceivable you could make the trip in a day. But that&#39;s not advisable, and you&#39;d probably make your horse very unhappy. Remember it gets rocky up around Dale, too.<br><br>If I had my atlas I could tell you how long the Esgaroth-Dale trip took on ponies. But I don&#39;t. Sad.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>*goes to dig out her copy of The Maps of Tolkien&#39;s Middle-earth*<br><br>Allrightythen. Mirkwood appears to be at the same latitude-type-thing as Eriador and Arnor. I know the south of Eriador doesn&#39;t get much snow usually, but the north gets plenty, and by that token I&#39;m assuming Arnor would as well, seeing as it&#39;s north of Eriador.<br><br>Mirkwood is inland, so it hasn&#39;t got the moderating effects of the sea that would generally reduce the amount of snow. Northern Mirkwood, which appears to be the area you&#39;re intrested in, has got the Misty Mountains up by its west border and the Grey Mountains on the north border. I think they might also contribute to the amount of snow.<br><br>So basically, I think that yes, it would snow in Mirkwood, and definitely around Thranduil&#39;s halls. The density of the trees would have to be taken into account- it&#39;s not likely that much snow would get through to the ground for the most part, though I seem to remember hearing that the trees thinned out a little around Elven lands, so there might be more snow there.<br><br>Hope this helped.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been getting into the Supernatural fandom for the past few weeks, and, being a fangirl, I&#39;ve been drifting through the fanfiction. And, well, I was kind of wondering...what is the PPC&#39;s attitude towards incest in fics? E.g., does it count as a charge?<br><br>See, just today I finished the Original Series. One of the last stories is a nasty fic regarding Arwen and Elrond...I&#39;m sure you know the one I&#39;m talking about. Now, I&#39;m not Tolkienite, but I can firmly say that the idea of Arwen and Elrond...even as fully consenting adults...just UGH. And I&#39;m fairly certain that most SANE, MATURE members of the fandom would react the same way. I hope. The idea of incest among Tolkien&#39;s elves (hell, in Tolkien <i>period</i>) is just wrong in so many ways. And if by some bizarre chance I ended up PPCing an incestuous LotR fic, I&#39;d put &quot;warping characters into creepy incestuous relationship&quot; down as a charge.<br><br>On the other hand, in certain fandoms, incest ships are well-established and frequently encountered, and not just as badfic. This is why I mentioned my current flirtation with Supernatural; Wincest, so far as I can tell, is a strong pillar of the SPN slash community. Similarly, having watched the Petrelli brothers get all touchy-feely with each other on Heroes, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised to see people shipping Nathan with Peter in their fics. I could go on, but I know incest is pretty squicky for a lot of people, so I&#39;ll stop.<br><br>My question is: should incest be a charge when PPCing, even if a large part of the fandom enjoys that kind of ship?</p>

            <p>Personal squicks, even illegality, come second to what is canonical for that fandom.

            <p>The Department of Bad Slash counts it as a charge, unless it&#39;s canonical. Think about it; incest is considered taboo in most cultures. It&#39;s also illegal in most places (up to a point; technically having it off with your first cousin is incest and that is legal). And if offspring occur, it&#39;s geneticallly unwise (although that&#39;s not *usually* a problem we have in Bad Slash ... although mpreg does seem to be on the rise ... *cowers in fear of Rule 34*).</p>

            <p>It depends on the canon, the characters involved, and how well-written the story is. What the fandom thinks has nothing to do with it. As you said, incest in Tolkien is pretty much always a charge, particularly if Elves are involved, because that&#39;s how Middle-earth works. Incest between Tolkien&#39;s characters would also pretty much always be a charge because of their society and personalities--same with the Weasley twins in Harry Potter.<br><br>If you&#39;ve got a canon or characters with which incest might not be such a strong taboo as it is in our culture, and if the story is well-written in all other respects, then you might let it slide. I&#39;d lay money that doesn&#39;t happen very often, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Welcome to the fore, sir.

            <p>My favourite bit was the impromptu trial caused by a typo, myself, due to the hilarity of the mental image, but the whole thing was excellent. I especially liked how the characters started to snap back to IC when the Sue died and it was only the neuralyzer that saved Katrina from being in a world of trouble. Samuel holding his own in a fight against Kratos was odd, but interesting, I hope we&#39;ll be seeing more of him. Overall though, it was an excellently written mission. I only hope my first can be half as good as this one. Excellent job, again.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s always easier to spot other people&#39;s mistakes than your own - if it&#39;s your own your brain reads what you meant to write rather than what you actually wrote. And I&#39;ll happily keep pointing out errors should I spot any. :)<br><br>The spelling rule, in British English at least, is that words ending in L double it in the past tense. Happens with other letters too, like the P in worship. A lot of the time American English seems to stick with just the single letter. Google&#39;s only got a few relevant hits before it descends into what looks like Portuguese to me, so I&#39;m guessing in this case it has to be double-L.

            <p>Sometimes they&#39;re long, can&#39;t help it. Quite a few of TOS&#39; missions were even longer than that blighter. It&#39;s nicely written though, great job for your first mission. Keep at it and yours is gonna be a very enjoyable spinoff to read.</p>

            <p>Obviously the PPC members and OFU staff/students can&#39;t put up funny film snippets on YouTube, or it&#39;d look pretty darned suspicious, particularly with nonhuman characters. How about the introduction into PPC canon of a site that works in a similar way, but is only accessible to those involved in the Canon Protection Initiative?<br><br>If this is a good idea, does anyone want to come up with ideas for popular clips that their agents would post?</p>

            <p>Hey all, Paladin again.<br><br>I&#39;ve a few questions, with the possibility of a new PPC agent in the works. Basically, in my long wanderings I&#39;ve run across fics so disturbing I can&#39;t even begin to figure out who to report them to. Most of these are basically the characters forced to bow to the author&#39;s incredibly messed up fetishes, a lot of which isn&#39;t even on the charge lists (I&#39;ve looked).<br><br>In response, I was thinking of creating an agent (or possible a pair) to deal with this sort of stuff. Like I said, however, I have no idea where they&#39;d be assigned. I considered DAVD, but they&#39;re strictly observational. So, I was thinking of creating a special unit specifically to deal with this stuff. They would have rather liberal charge lists, more freedom of action in the field, and lots of heavy weaponry. <br><br>Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>On the other hand, according to the Manual, DAVD does actually do field work, or so it seems. It&#39;s a bit vague, but it does mention them having agents, along with a medical and intelligence subsection. Perhaps I can shoe my characters in there after all. </p>

            <p>Oh boy...well, letseehere, the fic I was thinking as a sample involves Buffy (the Slayer) getting turned into a hooker by her mother (who&#39;s been vamped)and starts out with her having sex with various characters and mostly random men. However, the part I was going to use is actually midway in, when she is turned into a &quot;alien breeding slave&quot; (really, it&#39;s in the title). And then in the following chapter she becomes a stripper and has a gang bang with a bunch of demons.<br><br>And this is one of the tamer fics...I won&#39;t even discuss the Disney tentacle porn...the horror, the horror.<br><br>Needless to say, this stuff would not be for the kiddies. As a reflection, the characters I&#39;ve written are also much darker then your standard PPC fare.</p>

            <p>No, actually. If I remember correctly (and Lord knows I tried not to), the story involved the Disney princesses, all of &#39;em, traveling to Japan and getting attacked by a tentacle monster.<br><br>Basically, there are people out there who want to literally rape your childhood. I think I&#39;ll decline the Disney fics unless they are at, or above, this level of disturbing.

            <p>Well, being newish, I&#39;m not entirely sure how all of the departmental stuff works, but... Well, assuming you have permission and you&#39;re using DAVD as your model, why not look into forming a new division of the Department for that purposes? Like I said though, I&#39;m not positive of all the details, so it might be counter-intuitive for DAVD to have field agents.

Grammar&#39;s surprisingly competent in some parts, but it&#39;s still a really stupid fic, especially since the Joker keeps bizarrely jumping between in character and out of it (character, I mean).

<li>How long should Permission-seeking writing samples be?<br><br>A bit theoretical:<br>2. How long, in HQ time, do missions take -- as long as the fic, as long as the agents spend in the fic (not counting if they, say, skip over bits of time) or...? Theoretically, since portals can travel through time (at least in fics), couldn&#39;t they bring the agents back, say, ten minutes after the mission came in, no matter how long it took? Food for thought. :)<br><br>And now something really theoretical and a bit strange:<br>3. Let&#39;s say there&#39;s an author-writer-person writing an original story and s/he is aware of the PPC. Even though it&#39;s an original story, could the character join, perhaps in the Epilogue? <br>Oh... I didn&#39;t word that very well. Basically, in an  original story, could the canonical ending be that the character joins the PPC? (Obviously it would have to be credited &amp;c, if this is even possible.)<br>I say the canonical ending because I believe there are some original characters from works like that running around, but I think these tend to be AUs.<br>Considerations: If the work ever gets published and acquires fanfic, can you imagine the effect on the Agent? *shudders*<br><br>*C, who is inquisitive today.</li>

            <p>Handling it that way, via implication and not explicitly mentioning the PPC itself, could work. It&#39;d definitely be more possible. I&#39;d think the legal stuff and the like would only come into play if you specifically said &quot;main character joins the PPC&quot; at the end of the book. Could be tricky if you then had the character show up as an agent in a PPC spinoff, but that idea would work better than what I thought your idea was at first. Especially since it leaves it open to interpretation about if it&#39;s actually the PPC.</p>

            <p>Your ideas sound interesting, but it&#39;d be better to save them for later. For things like agent bios and writing samples, it&#39;s best to stay simpler, more like summaries. If either of them are too massively long or detailed the PG won&#39;t be able to get through it, and overall it&#39;s just far more information than actually needed in the bio case. If you want to work with both it could be a good idea to make a more detailed version, but keep it to yourself for reference and make a more summarized version for your actual permission attempt. And as Neshomeh said, I&#39;m sorry but using the PPC like you stated in an original fic probably wouldn&#39;t be allowed, especially since it&#39;s owned property.</p>

<li>Long enough to give an idea of your skill level and style, but not very long. A couple of pages, maybe?<br><br>2. Missions take as long as it takes to gather enough charges to make a kill/exorcism or fix whatever needs fixing. Agents could return minutes after they left if they wanted to, but I would think that existing in two places at once tends to get stressful after awhile.<br><br>3. If you&#39;re planning on getting stuff published, I wouldn&#39;t mention the PPC in it. First of all, the PPC is a borrowed idea. We&#39;re allowed to play with it online by the grace of its creators, but publishing and making money with it is another thing. Second, good luck explaining the PPC to your agent/editor/publisher.

            <p>Is there any way to incapacitate him beforehand? If you can, find some way to render him unable to do said blasting before charging. Shooting out all four limbs (kneecaps and shoulders or elbows would be my bet) could do the trick, but I don&#39;t know the Stu in question. Other than that, maybe deceiving him, or simply use stealth. Remain undetected aside from voice until done charging, then just take him out from behind or in a blind spot.</p>

            <p>Because I really, really hate being confused about things, and my agents really *do* need to be run by people (mostly because of darling Samuel), and I would feel so much happier doing this the official way.<br><br>...please don&#39;t hurt me. *wince*<br><br>Anyway. Let&#39;s see.<br><br>Brief Character Summaries (cue the wall of text):<br><br>Agent Katrina (may also be called Kat or Katri, the former is preferable)<br><br>Kat is a short young woman, somewhere in her late teens. Her hair is a curly strawberry-blonde that will tangle if you so much as look at it sideways. To attempt to prevent this, Kat usually braids her hair; it doesn’t help too much.<br><br>Kat comes from the Real World. She had been an avid fanfiction reader and, occasionally, writer, before she accidentally wrote a plothole into existence. With her customary lack of grace outside of dance class, Kat tripped over thin air and fell through the plothole, and, luckily for all involved, into the PPC HQ, where she was more or less drafted. After that, she suddenly had a lot less time for reading and writing.<br><br>Kat is generally cheerful and talkative, though she gets homicidal when her L.O.s are toyed with (who doesn&#39;t?) and she often ineffectually attempts to implement sarcasm.<br><br>And now for Samuel, of whom I&#39;m slightly less sure.<br><br>Samuel is a tall man of indeterminate age. His hair is long and black, with prominent white streaks at his temples, and is usually pulled back in a loose ponytail. There is always a simple silver band around his right wrist. If this comes off, bad things happen. Samuel’s origins are a mystery to everyone except him – and he’s not sharing. One thing that is certain is that Samuel is not his real name. He also seems to have been accustomed to authority.<br><br>Another certainty about Samuel is that he has oodles of power over space-time. Not space or time individually: space-time. However, in return for his inordinate amount of power, Samuel has almost zero control. The probability that he will turn up at the point he wants is about 1 in 3,141,592,653,589,793, which also happens to be pi with the decimal point severely misplaced. His power also has a habit of popping out at random, extremely inconvenient times.<br><br>One of Samuel’s misfires landed him smack in the middle of PPC HQ; he was summarily recruited. Before he went anywhere else, he managed to acquire a handy device to seal his powers from DoSAT. Given a choice between extreme power with no control and no power but control over his daily life, Samuel took the ‘no power’ choice.<br><br>Samuel is very quiet, speaking only when he feels the need, and even then he tries to be concise. He has a very dry sense of humor, one which doesn&#39;t always come across well. He is, however, very impulsive, and gets very annoyed (irrational, even) when canon is tampered with, even when he doesn&#39;t know the continuum very well.<br><br>These are the shortened summaries. I have longer ones available if it becomes necessary.<br><br>Suefic to kill...<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3099840/1/A_Fragile_Soul">A Fragile Soul</a><br><br>Actually, I&#39;ve got it mostly done. I just... want to make sure I&#39;m not doing anything heinous by putting it on the interwebs.<br><br>And writing sample...<br><br><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/rcphi/interludea.htm">This</a><br><br>If more is wanted, I can point to my FF-net account. Not all of it&#39;s my best work, but I&#39;m always trying to improve. That counts for something, right?<br><br>So yeah.<br>That&#39;s about it.<br>I&#39;m going to hide under my table and hope I&#39;m not a completely paranoid little idiot.<br>And oh yeah! I know I haven&#39;t been very active on the board lately but I don&#39;t always feel that my input is relevant to the situation. So yeah. I&#39;m really quiet, but I am here. Really.<br>*hides again*</p>

            <p>... Permission Granted. We&#39;re not <i>that</i> scary, really.<br><br>I seem to recall quite a few normal human/powerful entity Agent teams in HQ, and they can go either way, really. Kat is perfectly normal for a PPCer (I&#39;d swear we had several Kats already, but there&#39;s nothing on the Wiki, and it doesn&#39;t matter anyway). Samuel is powerful, yes, but with that massive drawback (which is clearly manipulatable by Legal... you&#39;ll want to watch out <s>if</s> <s>when</s> if he loses his bracelet that you don&#39;t end up writing Legal on his side all the time). We don&#39;t know his past (yet), and that&#39;s fine, provided you make sure it&#39;s not too &#39;Stuish; I think we can trust you on that score, however.<br><br>Your writing sample makes me giggle (and haven&#39;t we seen it before?), and while I don&#39;t know the Canon the Suefic looks pretty bad. So here you go, have Permission and get... well, finish writing.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: It might also be nice to see you posting a little more. Don&#39;t worry about relevance -- post something on a complete tangent if you feel like it. The PPC is all about being completely bonkers, remember. ~hS</p>

            <p>So...hi.<br><br>I&#39;ve been lurking on and off at the PPC wiki and making my way through the original series. I&#39;m thinking about making my own PPC, so...here I am. Thought I should get acquainted.<br><br>I get a bit nervous about writing in &#39;verses that don&#39;t belong to me (like the PPC), especially when it feels like I&#39;ll never make it through all the canon material (again, like PPC). So I&#39;m hoping one of you guys would be willing to beta for me or at least put up with incessant questions.<br><br>I&#39;ll leave you with two for the moment:<br><br>What qualifies for PPC badfic standards? I&#39;ve got this one Heroes fic in mind that has been bugging me for ages, but compared to a lot of the stuff I&#39;ve seen here, it&#39;s the Fanfic of the Year. Well, maybe not, but the author actually knows basic grammar and puts together a coherent story. It&#39;s just that everyone is ridiculously out of character and the wangst is up to a trillion and it MAKES ME ANGRY GRR I HATE RAPE AS DRAMA DAMMIT.<br><br>It&#39;s called The Road to Redemption. Would it qualify?<br><br>Secondly, and much more embarrassingly...how do you get rid of badfic plot bunnies? I&#39;ve had this idiotic wangsty fic bouncing around since, erm, less advanced portions of my life and <i>I can&#39;t get rid of it</i>. Every so often it pops up in my mind and I giggle like a schoolgirl. You guys spork badfic on a regular basis and I&#39;m guessing some of you write fanfics, so I was hoping you might have suggestions.</p>

            <p>That is awesome. I knew HQ had a few, but I didn&#39;t realize they used them for response centers.<br><br>Does it matter significantly for the agents? I&#39;d like to write one of my Agents as a vaguely passive-aggressive Time Lady, but she would be the newbie on the team. It&#39;s not inconcievable that her human partner lives in a response center. Could you give me links to the report files for Agents based in TARDISes?</p>

            <p>Nope, sorry, not much of a gamer. I have a bad enough computer addiction problem already (you guys are NOT helping). I do have a soft spot for Metal Gear Solid, though I&#39;ve only made it through the second game (I&#39;m working on the first). Weird stuff makes me happy. I <i>liked</i> the ending of the original Neon Genesis Evangelion, okay? It was thought provoking and  I found it genuinely uplifting. No, seriously! <br><br>Right now, my biggest fandom in Doctor Who. I&#39;ve also started dabbling in Supernatural and may, some day, actually getting around to watching Battlestar Galatica or Farscape or Babylon 5 or...suffice to say, I like well-done sci-fi. I&#39;m also a fan of Pushing Daisies and BRITISH Life on Mars, but I can&#39;t see myself enjoying fanfiction from those shows.  I&#39;d also like to look into more British TV when I have the chance.<br><br>I&#39;m a big western comics geek, especially the Deep and Mature Works of Art Graphic Novels: Sandman, Watchmen, V for Vendetta, the Invisibles, Persepolis, you name it, I&#39;ll probably have read it--and if not, give me the title so I can hunt it down. Which isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t read comics for fun. When I can, I try to pick up Powers and the new Spirit, and my complete collection of Bone is a prized item.<br><br>Book series I read: A Song of Ice and Fire, Discworld, Wheel of Time...there are probably more, but I can&#39;t think of them. I&#39;ve read a lot of books. Back in the day, I was a big fan of Tamora Pierce and Brian Jacques, but I haven&#39;t read their recent books.<br><br>Anime/Manga: Death Note, Naruto, Akira, anything by Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Tutu, Cowboy Bebop, Elfen Lied, Ouran High School Host Club, Baccano!, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Hellsing (manga) and Fullmetal Alchemist (anime). I&#39;m working my way though Monster (manga) on and off, and someday I&#39;ll get around to catching up in the Fullmetal Alchemist manga. Ditto Zoku Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. I&#39;m hoping to get into Serial Experiments Lain and FLCL in the future.<br><br>Western Animation: Transformers Animated and Avatar. I&#39;m making my way through Transformers: Beast Wars, too.<br><br>That&#39;s about all I can think of...feel free to throw names at me, I&#39;m very forgetful.<br><br>Also...REVERSE GLOMP! Sorry to be a letdown on the Tales bit, but maybe we share other fandoms?</p>

I&#39;ve never played MGS, but I&#39;ve heard good things. I&#39;d watch Doctor Who if I could ever find it. x.X Ever heard of Red Dwarf? I blame the BBC. For... uh... not everything, but a lot.

You are about the fifth independant person to recommend A Song of Ice and Fire, so obviously I shall have to read it. Them. Whatever.<br><br>Amazingly, we share most of the anime/manga. I&#39;m not familiar with Akira or Elfen Lied, though. Princess Tutu is win. Ever heard of Katekyo Hitman Reborn? *hopeful grin* It&#39;s a nifty series. Kyou Kara Maou is also sort of good, but I can&#39;t watch it. x.X<br><br>So yes, we share fandoms. :P I approve of your taste; you&#39;re officially a nifty person in my books. Yay glompage... oh hey. <br><br>What do we call you? o.O Five_redclawed seems a bit of a mouthful to me, though fine as a full name. Nicknames? =D I have ideas bursting out my ears.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I guess it is a mouthful. I used to go by Lawrence-chan but I was thinking of dropping it because of the fanbrat implications that &quot;-chan&quot; carries (it&#39;s an inside joke by the way involving the movie Gettysburg...yeah, it&#39;s a long story...). But you can call me Lawrence or Lawrie if you like. Or something else. I&#39;m kinda interested in the nicknames you&#39;re thinking of.<br><br>In terms of Doctor Who, check out your local video store. Or, if you are a starving college student like me, there&#39;s this website called Sidereel.com where you should be able to get most if not all of the new seasons. Getting the old series is more difficult, but NuWho is as good a place to start as any. <br><br>I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t heard of Akira--it&#39;s a classic. So go watch it. You are forbidden to call yourself an anime geek unless you&#39;ve seen it. :P It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen it myself, actually, but I read and reread the manga all the time until my brother took it with him to New Orleans. It&#39;s excellent stuff, if pretty disturbing sometimes. But it&#39;s disturbing for a reason! Trust me, I nearly majored in English! I&#39;m all about analyzing the subtextual messages and stuff!!<br><br>But before you leap into Elfen Lied, you might wanna look it up on Wikipedia or something. It&#39;s...really gruesome. I mean, I liked it, though it was a good series, but the first few episodes were difficult to get through. And, well, its detractors claim that it&#39;s just about gratuitous violence and fanservice. I&#39;d say there&#39;s a lot more to the show than that but I just thought you should know, it&#39;s kind of an acquired taste. You should definitely check out the opening sequence, though. It&#39;s gorgeous. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKvZS3xe8zQ&amp;feature=related"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKvZS3xe8zQ&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKvZS3xe8zQ&amp;amp;feature=related</a></a><br><br>Oh Princess Tutu. I only finished watching you and I want to buy you and hold you forever. And figure out all those classical pieces that make up your soundtrack. I tried to show it to a friend, but he thought it was too girly for him. Yes, it&#39;s about ballerinas but it&#39;s AWESOME in so many ways!! Ah well. By the way, there&#39;s a really neat AMV on youtube that you should check out called Hold Me Now. I don&#39;t usually go for AMVs, but this one&#39;s pretty good. It was one of the things that got me into the series in the first place.<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZqxecCukg"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZqxecCukg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZqxecCukg</a></a><br><br>Katekyo Hitman Reborn rings a bell, but I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever seen it.

            <p>Lawrie works, I suppose. My first instinct was to call you Five, though. (Imaginative!) And I can have fun with numbers. The &#39;_redclawed&#39; bit makes me think of the Warriors series, but the warrior(s) with the closest name(s) to yours met... hm... unhappy ends. I could call you Lawrie-claws, but that sort of defeats the purpose, as it is, in fact, quite long. Well... three syllables...

Hm. Well, it&#39;s about a fairly average Japanese middle-schooler (I think. I believe he&#39;s... fourteen?) who really, really sucks at school and... pretty much everything. His nickname is &#39;no-good Tsuna,&#39; which should tell you something. (Full name Tsunayoshi).

            <p>...It hangs on my wall and is several feet long. And is red. With Chinese dragons on it. With five claws. See, in Chinese mythology, the royal dragons had five claws on their feet, while less important ones had only four. Well, something like that, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve really looked at my mythologies. I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know this &quot;Warriors&quot; series you mentioned, though...what&#39;s it about? And what does &quot;Angie&quot; have to do with it? Looks like I&#39;m going cookie-less<br><br>By the way, I&#39;m totally going with Lawrie-claws from now on. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a mouthful. It&#39;s too awesome not to use.<br><br>It&#39;s funny that you mention Five as a nickname, though. I&#39;m not sure how much you know about Doctor Who, but sufficed to say that the main character frequently regenerates (read: transforms) into a new body (read: new actor) every few seasons. It&#39;s how they&#39;ve kept the show going for so long. So we Whovians refer to the different doctors as numbers. For example: &quot;Poor 8 really deserved more than that crappy movie. He deserved a season or two of actual, good British TV shows before regenerating into 9.&quot; The point is, when you say you were thinking of calling me five, I get the image of a rather kind-looking man with a stick of celery stuck on his lapel. Hee. Just makes me giggle a bit.<br><br>I also got into Princess Tutu because of dancing, by the way. I&#39;m a Balkan folkdancer myself, which is <i>very</i> different from ballet. But still, if you&#39;re a dancer, you know how wonderful it is to watch as well as dance/perform. You really come to appreciate good dancing and the meaning of the movements. Of course, Princess Tutu is just a cartoon, not real people, but I loved the way it used dancing as a metaphor for feelings, fighting, etc....you know what I mean.</p>

            <p>Want. :P <br>The &#39;Warriors&#39; series is about feral cats, divided into four Clans, who hunt, fight over territory, and generally live in a forest somewhat near humans. (Yes, the humans become an issue.) The series starts when a young kittypet, a house cat, wanders into the forest, gets a little lost, and winds up joining one of the Clans.<br>They suffer a little bit from Slytherin Syndrome in the case of ShadowClan, I think, but other than that it&#39;s actually a pretty good series.

I was about to give you the wiki links, but July is indeed dangerous, so I&#39;ll settle for saying hello, echoing the Artic&#39;s comments about Permission asking, and add that any reasonably bad fic can be PPCd, even if we usually go for the worst of them. If it&#39;s dramatically out of character - ESPECIALLY if it involves rape as a plot device - you can do it. Once you have Permission. Go for it!<br><br>And welcome!<br><br>- Sedri</p>

            <p>Welcomeness! It&#39;s fun to delurk.<br>Firstly, in order to write in the PPC Universe, you need to gain Permission. You do that by hanging around the Board (This place) for about a month, getting to know people and letting us get to know you.<br>As for the PPC Canon, the Wiki will help. I&#39;ll leave July to do that, otherwise I may get a spork in the hand.<br><br>The quality of a badfic is really up to the PPCer themself. You do need a list of charges, but that generally changes from story to story.<br>And getting rid of plot bunnies, write the plot bunny, giggle, and then squirrel it away whee no-one can see it.</p>

            <p>Because I&#39;m a dork and I never recorded your e-mails when I asked for volunteer agents last summer. {= P I&#39;m more or less done with the HP/DroP crossover mission, and I&#39;d like you guys to at least read to make sure your agents (who come in about halfway through) are in-character. I&#39;d also really appreciate some serious editing from anybody whether I named them or not, because this mission is ridiculously long.

            <p>No worries. I used to be something of a Zelda fan, so I know my way around that one, but along with the mentioned notes I can do my homework on the others. :P And as said, you don&#39;t exactly need to be a continua expert to proofread. Glad to be of assistance though.</p>

            <p>The Harry Potter part won&#39;t come up for a while yet, I need to go through two other worlds first (Charmed / Buffy crossover world and High School Musical) before we get to Hogwarts, but hopefully that won&#39;t take long. If you want, I can send along the background notes specifically for Hogwarts, they differ from the ones I sent before.<br><br>I&#39;ll talk later though. Thanks Lynxihez!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m working on a fanfic (well, more accurately, resurrecting one long-postponed), in which the Woods of Nuath feature (they&#39;re the woods on the southern side of the Ered Wethrin between the sources of Nenning and Narog; near the pools of Ivrin).<br><br>Now, being as I am an Australian, my knowledge of northern hemisphere botany is sketchy at best. I know several of the tree names and so on, but have very little idea what grows where. So, the question is: any ideas on what might be plausible types of tree to grow in the area.<br><br>Doriath, across the Sirion, is described as having beech forests (and methinks Brethil, which is closer to Nuath, might also have beech). But Nuath would be further north and (presumably) higher elevation than either of these, lying as it does on the borders of a mountain range.<br><br>I have a vague half-remembered inkling about birch and linden being higher-elevation species - or is this completely wrong?<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br><br>Elcalion, botanically curious</p>

            <p>If we use North America as a model, I would expect to see:<br><br>In the coastal and low-lying regions of Lammoth and Nevrast, there will be a mix of maples, oaks, spruce, and firs, with the occasional beech and cedar. The further north one gets (or higher elevation), the firs will become more and more prominent. However, once one crests the Ered Lomin, the firs will quickly give way to pine.<br><br>I suspect you&#39;re thinking of aspen, rather than birch - while there are oddball species that prefer it the other way around, most aspens are high-altitude trees, while birches tend towards lowlands.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure where the tradeoff between pine and aspen happens - I remember that some areas of western Colorado (especially around Grand Junction) are very heavily forested with aspen, but that&#39;s a good six hundred miles from the nearest ocean, and across multiple rather high mountain ranges. Just by looking at the map of Beleriand in my Silm, I would guess that Nuath would have either a pine/fir mix, if the weather came up along the ered wethrin from south of mount Taras (a long trip, but no mountain ranges in the way to pull out most of the rain), or it would have a pine/aspen mix, if the weather came down from the firth of Drengist (and thus over some serious mountains).<br><br>Considering that a large amount of the water in the Sirion comes from Dorthonion and Ered Wethrin, I would suspect it&#39;s the former - that&#39;s a lot of water to go up and over the mountains. Also, the size of the Gelion up north suggests that the March of Maedhros gets a decent amount of water. It would make sense to me, anyways, if all of Beleriand&#39;s weather came from the southwest, from the sea.<br><br>Or, I could be all wet. The Columbia river is huge, and its watershed is on the far side of the Cascade mountains (and the Olympics) from the ocean. Personally, though, I&#39;d take that to mean that Hithlum should probably have a fairly big river for drainage.</p>

            <p>Well, that&#39;s a lie, there is a very SMALL amount of fandom knowledge required, and that is this: Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist, hates being called &quot;short&quot;.

            <p>So I&#39;m making a roleplaying character, and I came across something that I&#39;d like to know. Is there anything in the beer-making process that would cause a phosphorescent ingredient to stop glowing?</p>

            <p>The question would be, what is the phosphorescent molecule?<br><br>Beer making involves turning sugar into ethanol.  If the phosphoresance depends on the sugar, or even the sugar concentration, then, after a while the mixture would stop glowing.<br><br>The byproduct of making ethanol is CO2.  Generally that will also kill any phosphoescent properties of anything until it is released. I chan go into an energy level diagram and molecules, but that would be a little too technical.<br><br>Leto, chem geek</p>

            <p>I guess, then, I&#39;ll have to either drop that gimmick or handwave it as to do with magic - but since most of this people&#39;s &quot;magic&quot; is standard electricity, I doubt that&#39;d be plausible. Thanks, though.</p>
