            <p>... why would they be? They&#39;re not written to annoy, as far as I can see. The spelling and grammar and such seem to be quite good. The only reason you could class them as trollish rather than humour or parody is that five of them don&#39;t list either of those as their genres.<br><br>My understanding is that a trollfic is designed to trick people into thinking it&#39;s an unintentionally awful fic by someone who can&#39;t write, thus annoying the readers and amusing (somehow) the author. Now, if there were a vast community of writers about a well-spoken Pirate Puddleglum, then the accented version could be considered a troll, being deliberate misunderstanding of what it means for him to be a pirate. But (I sincerely hope) there isn&#39;t. So I&#39;m still not sure how they qualify as trolls.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Most of you know about the research paper I&#39;m doing for university; a broad overview of the world of fanfiction. I&#39;ve <i>finally<i> finished sifting through all the data from interviews and other research, but a few gaps remain. So I&#39;m throwing the question out to you:<br><br>Why do straight women write femslash? <br><br>I don&#39;t really understand slash at all, but that&#39;s personal preferance. I&#39;ve been told, by many interviewees, that straight women can enjoy writing m/m slash because it lets them oggle two attractive guys without female competition (as well as simply &quot;being hot&quot;), but my Logic Circuits short out when I try to apply similar logic to straight women writing f/f slash. <br><br>Admittedly, I haven&#39;t got solid demographics here; it could be that a large part of femslash is written by bisexual or lesbian women. I don&#39;t know. What I do know is that I&#39;ve been exploring the <i>Wicked</i> archive on FFN (which, if you don&#39;t know, is by and large a story about the friendship between two women, Glinda and Elphaba - there&#39;s also the man who ends up caught in a love triangle with them, Fiyero (eventually ending up with Elphaba), and another male interest that&#39;s quite often paired with Glinda), and I found that there is a (wonderful!) shortage of Mary Sues, an average amount of het romance (Fiyero/Elphaba, or Glinda/other guy, mostly), and a huge, HUGE amount of (&quot;Gelphie&quot;) femslash. <br><br>As I find it hard to believe that so many writers for that one fandom just happen to be lesbian or bisexual women, I just don&#39;t <i>get</i> it.<br><br><br>(And let me disclaim that I mean no offense to anyone, of course. My preferances are my own and until now, I just avoided slash issues as much as possible <i>because</i> I don&#39;t understand and don&#39;t want to offend anyone. But for the sake of doing this essay <i>right</i>, I need to know, and my poor, pitiable Logic Circuits are crying out for mercy. Help?)</i></i></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been puzzling over my own shipping preferences ever since I noticed that slash ticked me off, but femslash didn&#39;t. And from there, I can only bring myself to read femslash, not write it. Interesting double standards, aye?<br><br>I think it&#39;s because females feel more comfortable with their own bodies. So when they read femslash, they understand what the author might be going at in the writing. But hey, I don&#39;t know...I&#39;m no sexuality expert. </p>

            <p>Our own.

            <p>I was talking about both average-rated romance femslash <i>and</i> pure smut stories, as I&#39;m really no judge of slashfic quality.<br><br>I suppose it&#39;s worth stating here that, after reading those forty different interviews, many of them from you lovely PPCrs (*hugs*), it&#39;s easy to conclude that I am (once again) something of the odd one out. I just can&#39;t bring myself to read slash that&#39;s beyond what can be talked off as friednship; I don&#39;t know why. I&#39;m just traditional, I guess, and I always - in any subject - tend to stick with what I know. My own sexuality has a huge impact on what I read and write, and &quot;fun pairings&quot; have never appealed to me. <br><br>Maybe that&#39;s the problem? My lack of imagination? Or simple squickiness. I&#39;ve got nothing against it, of course, but I just... I still don&#39;t get it. Intellectually, I agree with every point you guys have made <br><br>... I could start a long rant now on <i>What&#39;s Wrong With Friendship?</i>, but that&#39;s probably not a good idea. I tend to get dramatic. And I&#39;m rambling far enough off-topic anyway.<br><br>But if nothing else, at least this makes the theoretical side of things clearer, and that&#39;s mainly what I need for my essay. I do feel a bit blind, though. <br><br><br>(And Lycaenion, to be honest, I haven&#39;t read <i>Wicked</i> yet, either; I&#39;m talking mainly about the musical adaptation and all the fanfic for that.)</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t understand how anyone could not get slash. ^_^&quot; If you don&#39;t like the romance genre, then that&#39;s fine by me, but I don&#39;t get why someone would enjoy het pairings but not slash ones (unless said slash pairing breaks up their het OTP- I understand that all too well).</p>

            <p>I love romance. I go all aww-ish and gooey over them. It might be my favourite genre. But every time I try to read slash, be it m/m or f/f, I just <i>can&#39;t</i>. It appears to be my personal squick, and I have no idea why. <br><br>I suppose it <i>might</i> be that the slash pairs break up my ideas of &quot;correct&quot; pairings - all of which, now that I think about it, are the deliberate canonical pairings. I&#39;ve never found myself &quot;seeing the potential&quot; for pairings other than the established, except in cases where the characters never have an established partner. *shrugs* Perhaps, in that regard, I simply have no imagination. <br><br>Honestly, though, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it. It sounds so terribly biased saying it, and I feel dreaful, but the mental image of two men or two women kissing - even if they&#39;re <i>not</i> characters I know - is possibly the most unromantic thing I can imagine. And it&#39;s <i><b>horrible</b></i> of me, but it&#39;s true.<br><br>If I may go on a slight tangent, it annoys me to no end that if a bisexual or gay person says they can&#39;t stand het relationships, they&#39;re practically martyred as &quot;forward thinking&quot; and &quot;confidant&quot;, but if I say the same thing in reverse, I&#39;m labled a homophobe. I&#39;m not. I&#39;m really not; I have nothing against homosexuality; I have gay friends, and I&#39;m glad that people can be happy. It&#39;s just not for me. In Real Life <i>or</i> fanfic.<br><br>Perhaps the best illustration is thus: I&#39;m perfectly fine with knowing the biological theory of how I came to exist, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m happy to watch my parents have sex. I just <i>don&#39;t</i> need to see that. <br><br>... and I&#39;m rambling again, aren&#39;t I? I do appreciate your attempt to make me feel better. </p>

            <p>I was referring more to the other fanficcers out there, but nonetheless, it&#39;s comforting to hear someone say so. I&#39;m most comfortable being honest; it&#39;s just such a touchy subject.<br><br>In any case, to follow your point there, Trojie, here&#39;s something to consider: While I was dating my last boyfriend, I read very, very few fanfic romances.

            <p>No one can be blamed for the thoughts in their minds; it&#39;s actions that are important.

            <p>I&#39;d imagine similar reasons apply to writing f/f as writing m/m. Not having the appropriate manly bits, I can&#39;t really appreciate an m/m fic by identifying hugely with one or other character, but they&#39;re still interesting to read and write about, because we&#39;re not talking about pr0n here, we&#39;re talking about stories about people. You might as well ask why authors who happen to be lesbians write straight couples. The author&#39;s sexuality should have no more bearing on characters or plot or anything else than, for example, their skin colour or nationality.<br><br>Of course, if we <i>are</i> talking blatant pr0n, that&#39;s another matter entirely, and I doubt you&#39;d get many wholly and comfortably heterosexual women writing PWP femmeslash. If you&#39;re writing or reading for the sex, after all, it&#39;s pretty pointless reading or writing about sex that really doesn&#39;t do anything for you.</p>

            <p>... that they find interesting. I can&#39;t really comment, even though I like slash and femslash, because I&#39;m bi. I have a straight friend who quite likes m/m but gets squicked at f/f. Maybe the straight women who write femslash just see a specific pairing and think &quot;Oh, they are so together.&quot; Then they write it, not because it&#39;s hot, but because it&#39;s a romantic pairing that they find interesting. You don&#39;t have to find something &quot;hot&quot; to enjoy writing it. I mean, look at all the SyaoSaku fans. I doubt many of them see their relation as anything other than &quot;omg so cute&quot;.<br><br>Most likely though is that they&#39;re just open-minded and mature enough to not let something like sexuality get in the way of writing a fun pairing.</p>

            <p>Hmmm... while it is most likely true that lesbian/bi women might do a better job of writing femslash, it&#39;s perfectly possible that a straight woman could see two female characters as &#39;meant for each other,&#39; and want to write this. <br><br>Or perhaps they feel that part of a certain female character&#39;s pysche is due to them pining for another female, and want to make this part of their story.<br><br>(N.B: I have not yet read Wicked, and the above are generalizations that probably don&#39;t support your example.)<br><br>However, if you&#39;re talking about <i> bad </i> or PWP fanfiction, I think you&#39;re right in saying that &quot;omg they&#39;re so hawt!&quot; isn&#39;t the correct reason. <br>But if f/f romance is an interesting plot point rather than just vapid porn, I don&#39;t think women have to be straight to write it. <br></p>

            <p>For me, writing any relationship is a progression from what potential I can see for it in canon. If I see potential for a f/f sexual relationship, then that&#39;s what I&#39;ll write. If I feel up to writing smut for it, then why shouldn&#39;t I? It has nothing to do with my own personal sexuality.<br><br>Hope this helps you.</p>

            <p>I think everyone has good reasons for both staying here and returning to the old place. I think most of the older oldbies and lurkers and whatnot know the old place better than this one. A lot of the old sites link to that board, too, which means that anyone who wants to find this place has to go through a big long stumbling mess. I also have to admit I&#39;ve never seen this place blue- a rather pathetic point, I know.<br><br>On the other hand, the newer and/or more active Boarders know this place a bit better, and most of our links lead here now, as has already been mentioned. Though I suppose it would be easy enough to change them back, and just have this place as the little party ground. Would definitely have made life easier on the old Board back during the Water Fight.<br><br>Maybe we&#39;d be better off with July&#39;s suggestion.

            <p>Crazy crossover/fusion/AU things make me ridiculously happy. I&#39;ve actually read most of that author&#39;s work; I haven&#39;t gotten through the one in question, but it was his or her stuff that put me back on to Bleach in the first place. &#39;Lone Flower&#39; and &#39;Petals in the WInd&#39; in particular - I read those and I was all &#39;hey, I should start watching that again, and pay more attention to the characters who aren&#39;t Ichigo, &#39;cause some of them are pretty darn nifty.&#39;<br><br>Kenpachi Zaraki is rapidly endearing himself to me. *scowls*</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>So...some of you may remember my last attempt at asking for Permission. Well, I&#39;ve switched around one character...Agent Christianne is now partnered with Agent Eledhwen. <br>So without further ado...<br><br>Backstory: Eledhwen Elerossiel<br>Being a Random Generic Elf had its perks. For one, no Mary Sue ever took the bother to notice her unless she had been cast by the Author/ess in a Suefic (often appearing for one line under a terrible name like Alinaserweniel, Lady in Waiting to Princess Mary Sue). She never stuck around long to fall under the PPC radar as a bit character, and never would want to. The PPC were scary, but they were her saviors. They just never knew that. After all, she was a Random Generic Elf. <br>Eledhwen patrolled the borders of Rivendell, often to just be the Random Elf who escorts Princess Mary Sue to the Last Homely House, though she never wanted to. Other times she would be sewing or cooking with the other Random Generic Elves, and if she really had nothing to do she would wander around, watching the Assassins (being a Random Generic Elf also meant not even Canon paid attention to you, so you could see things the official Canonicals couldn&#39;t), and sometimes close enough to hear them. In this manner, Eledhwen managed to learn that there were other worlds that were in a similar state of disrepair like hers. Not only that, but she also noted that the Assassins often talked about being &#39;understaffed&#39; and &#39;overworked&#39;. <br>And one day, she was assigned the role of Lady in Waiting to yet another Mary Sue--and the Author/ess knew her name and her usual role, and even gave her a more important part in the &#39;fic. Eledhwen then realized that she was in a parody &#39;fic, and proceeded to try to have the time of her life being a main opponent of a Mary Sue. <br>The MS, Starr Prettyprettyprincess, had other plans and contacted a Mary Sue Factory. This Factory was conducting experiments in cloning and Eledhwen was to be their Elf specimen. So while Minas Tirith was besieged, Eledhwen was kidnapped by Defectives and sent to the Factory. <br>During her stint at the MSF, Eledhwen got her hands on some Canon catalogues someone had left behind. They were never touched by the MS Factory workers because it was, after all, a <i>Canon</i> catalogue. To pass her time in between specimen testings, Eledhwen read about Narnia, Hogwarts, even Middle-earth in a time long since past. <br>When her hyperactive Mary Sue-ish duplicate was created, the Head Mary Sue informed Eledhwen that her duplicate, Lilith of the Wintry Woods, was to take her place, undercover, in the MS Parody and the original Elleth would be executed. Distraught, Eledhwen tricks a couple of Defectives to lead her to the Portal Room and portalls herself to HQ. Her information on this paricular Factory is still being processed. In the meantime, Eledhwen is a Part-time Assassin in DMS, partnered with Christianne if she is on the job. If not, she is at OFUM, learning more about the Canon (through pain, of course) or training to become a full-fledged Assassin.<br><br>Backstory: Christianne Shieh<br>Christianne Marian Shieh was a big fan of the PPC. That is, if she wasn&#39;t too busy flaming badfic for Lord of the Rings, Naruto, and Harry Potter. One day, she recieves a most curious envelope with odd forms (all written in Pig Latin) and a plane ticked to New Caledonia. <br>She fills out the forms simply because she had nothing to do, and decides that she should check out the scenery on that <i>charming</i> island. <br>Once she takes a step into town, she realizes that she was in the city the PPC fled to during the Macrovirus Attack. A hike in the hills led her to the door into HQ. After a chat with the Marquis, Christianne is placed in DMS, Naruto division. <br>After her partner&#39;s death (a rogue Canon still partly under the sway of a Mary Sue), Christianne is moved to the HP division. When one of the Mary Sues kills her partner in the HP division, Upstairs decides to just assign her to part-time partners in the LotR division. Consequently, she was partnered with Eledhwen Elerossiel and the rest is history. <br><br>So, if the PGs want more info, ask me. </p>

            <p>Would this work? They&#39;re a set of letters I wrote to my teacher in seventh grade. It&#39;s quite a statement for my writing when it comes to casual topics. I swear that everything written here is absolutely true and please don&#39;t give out the information, even if it&#39;s not that personal. <br>There will be names not many people would recgonize, but then, reading my letters without background info is like reading fanfic without consulting Canon.  <br><br><b>Letters To My Science Teacher: Destination Washington D.C.</b><br><br>Day One: April 5, 2008<br>Dear Mrs. Fallace,<br>HIIIIIII! I’m on a plane—a JetBlue plane, model A380. Right now I’m also watching TV. They’re built into the backs of the chairs. Pretty cool, huh? The show I’m watching now is 10.5, a sci-fi show about earthquakes and other natural; disasters. I applaud one of the characters’ (Samantha Hill, I think) tremendous knowledge of earth science. Earth science is so not MY forte. Ha. Later at seven they’ll be playing 10.5 Apocalypse. I want to see it, but by then I’ll probably be too busy learning more about Washington DC to be able to watch it. <br>I’m going to DC with my cousins Tony and Ashley, who like to call me Jenny-the-fur. (I personally HATE this nickname, so don’t get any ideas) Also coming along are my Aunt Sarah and Uncle Frank. They come up with the worst nicknames. (You can see them in the details book) Their dog, Rocky, is staying at home. Bet he doesn’t like that. <br>I wish you’d come along. Then I can have a conversation with at least someone who won’t be poking me every other word (Tony does that), criticizing me with a whole lot of swear words thrown in (Uncle Frank), making me feel insignificant (Aunt Sarah), or just being plain rude and immature (Ashley and Tony). Also, with them I feel like some alien from some distant planet in the Andromeda galaxy. It certainly isn’t fun feeling like that. Great…I’m not even in DC yet and already I’m school-sick (I don’t feel homesick, but I feel school-sick. How nice), and Portable C-sick. Boy, this is going to be a FUN vacation…     <br>—Jenny<br>Dear Mrs. Fallace,<br>I am officially in DC now. Our plane actually landed in Virginia, at the Washington-Dulles Int’l Airport. We had to ride for about 40 minutes in a taxi to get to town, and so I took a lovely little catnap. After all, it was just as exciting as reading from the science book in class, but I would never sleep THERE. Our hotel is the George Washington University Inn and it’s just a block or so from said college campus. It has a really good Italian restaurant called Notti Blanche. It’s good, but expensive—dinner was $145!<br>—Jenny <br><br>Day Two: April 6, 2008<br>Dear Mrs. Fallace,<br>We went to the Museum of Natural History today. I like it. You’d probably like it too because they have a lot of evolution exhibits (which is to be expected from a natural history museum, right?) and a whole lot of fossils. Go Darwin! <br>Actually, we went at first to the White House, but they said that we had to apply for tickets through our congressman (Diane…something is ours, right? I forgot her last name.) Because it would probably take said congressman months to give a yea or a nay to the application, the White House was therefore out of the question. <br>But even before that, we ate breakfast at yet another expensive DC restaurant—the Old Ebbit’s Grill. It was so popular that the tables were all occupied, and we had to sit at the bar. The people next to me had so many Bloody Marys; I was getting sick of watching the bartender prepare glass after glass of tomato juice with celery. After breakfast, we had our White House tourist’s problem because my aunt and uncle did not consult with Diane whose-surname-I-can’t-remember. So we went over to the Washington Monument. Unfortunately, it was rainy and gloomy, and although we took some pictures, we decided to go again some other day when Uncle Frank can go get free tickets to go up to the top of the monument via elevator.<br>After that, we went to the Museum. Outside it was freezing cold, and I bet Mr. Angel would have loved to be there. He just thrives in freezing classrooms, and often told us that he wished that the air conditioning can go so low that it’ll snow in the room. Once we were inside, we visited nearly all the exhibits. I wandered away from the group once, because wandering around on my own or with a less annoying group than the one I came here with was something I did often. (I bet you’re imagining past field trips I would have went to where the chaperone had to call Lost and Found for my whereabouts.) According to Uncle Frank, Aunt Sarah had contemplated calling the FBI, and I don’t believe him. But anyways, I saw a lot of fossils and a lot of evolution. There was a mammals exhibit, an African culture exhibit, an insects exhibit, and the list goes on. One of the highlights of the day was watching the IMAX 3D film Sea Monsters: a Prehistoric Adventure, which was about a <i>Dolichorhynchops osborni</i>, or a Dolly for short. It looks like an older version of a dolphin, and the movie is about its life journey. Another highlight was seeing the Hope Diamond, a blue diamond that is supposedly cursed. What would have been a third highlight became a missed opportunity—the “Butterflies and Evolution” exhibit’s butterfly pavilion was closed. After tearing my eyes away from a pair of mating grasshoppers and their exasperated (and maybe scandalized) grasshopper buddies, we were told that the museum would be closing soon. We went down to the gift shop, and I bought lollisticks (they look more like candy canes without the curve, and are not peppermint flavored) for my cousins and myself and candy with bugs in them for Christina and Brittany. How appetizing…just kidding. <br>We went down to the cherry trees by the Potomac River and took a lot of photos there. Afterwards we ate dinner at a restaurant in Chinatown. Both of my cousins were complaining about their growling stomachs and sore feet. Back at the hotel, I had trouble sleeping because while our bedtime may be 9:00 here, back in Irvine it is still 6:00, and my biological clock hadn’t adjusted yet. So now I’m tossing and turning in bed, dreaming of what school would be like come Monday. That’s just how school-sick I am.<br>--Jenny <br><br>Day Three: April 7, 2008<br>Dear Mrs. Fallace,<br>We’ve decided to forego going back to the Washington Monument today because of inclement weather—yeah it’s raining again. Instead, we went to the National Air and Space Museum. It wasn’t as interesting to me as the Natural History Museum because I’m not interested in aerodynamics. I guess I just like things a little bit closer to home. <br>I bought a gyroscope from the gift shop, and I have no idea how to get it to work. Maybe M. Johnson can help, or you if you know anything about gyroscopic forces. It’s pretty cool either way. I should bring it to class one day…maybe. We watched a show about cosmic collisions in the planetarium, and learned how things can fly (and no, it is not gas propulsion, which was Tony’s immature comment. It is lift and thrust, which must overcome gravity’s pull and drag). In the IMAX theater I watched two movies: To Fly and Space Station 3D. I like the space station one more because it made space look like a nice and cozy place. It is about the International Space Station. To Fly is the inaugural film played for the grand opening of this museum, and it is about the history of flight. There was also a stimulator ride we went on—it wasn’t worth the money. <br>The exhibits were pretty intriguing, especially the satellite one where you could view the world from a satellite. I was zooming in on the Californian coast, although it most definitely is not Google Earth and I couldn’t find Irvine on the map. Or Huntington Beach, for that matter—no, I’m not trying to find out where you live. There were also a few displays about the electromagnetic spectrum, and a very awesome wheel that had a series of lenses and mirrors to show people how light is reflected in certain models of telescopes. One cool thing was that they had actual airplanes, rockets, and missiles hanging all over the place. I took pictures of some of them. <br>—Jenny <br><br>Day Four: April 8, 2008 <br>Dear Mrs. Fallace, <br>Today we saw how money was made at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. You could smell the money there from the other side of the street. There’s money there, all right…loads and loads of it. Forget about bank robberies—rob the Bureau instead!<br>We got tickets for the 4:00 tour, so to kill off time we went to the Holocaust Memorial Museum next door. For my favorite museums at DC, the Holocaust Museum ranks third, under the Natural History Museum, which is in second place behind the International Spy Museum. The exhibits were very touching and intriguing. I mean, Hitler positively brainwashed the Germans into thinking that their race was superior to others, and that life was constantly a battle for the survival of the fittest and the fittest should be them and not any “inferior” race. And for members of those in the “inferior” races, their life was brutal indeed. I saw pictures and videos about the executions of millions of Jews, homosexuals, the physically or mentally disabled, gypsies, and anyone who did not measure up to Hitler’s standard. There was a model of the gas chambers, showing hundreds and thousands of those people getting killed by asphyxiation. Some of those corpses were sent to doctors for medical studies, especially in the field of genetics (how could they!). Other live victims became the guinea pigs for other experiments that were on the same plane as torture. All of this was too depressing for Aunt Sarah and my cousins, so they went to see the Hishorn Museum while Uncle Frank stayed behind. We were separated again because I was actually paying attention to the exhibits. In the end, Uncle Frank had to send up museum workers to track me down. It certainly is not fair. Harrumph. <br>After lunch we went on a tour of the Bureau. They showed us how money was made. Did you know the bills aren’t made individually? They are printed on huge pieces of “paper” that is part linen and part cotton. There is about 36 or so forth bills on each sheet. The guide said that we can buy some of those sheets there in the gift shop. Isn’t that crazy: buying money with money? The gift shop also has shredded dollars in a bag. Altogether the bills in the bag have a worth of about $150…if they weren’t shredded. <br>We went to the Jefferson Memorial afterwards. From there you can see the White House, although it is very small. In the gift shop there I bought a replica set of the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. All of them are reprinted onto parchment, and are somewhat hard to read. But if I could decipher the Tech Trek letter, I can read the Constitution replica. I don’t know whether to give it to Mr. Angel or to Mrs. Wimbrow, but I’d probably give it to the former because he also teaches US History. But that’s not helping my thoughts on what to get you…I’ll think on it. <br>—Jenny<br><br>Day Five: April 9, 2008<br>Dear Mrs. Fallace,<br>Boy, my feet hurt. We’ve set a record for most landmarks/attractions visited in a day today by visiting six. We visited the Washington Monument (Frank got the tickets at long last!), the World War II Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the Vietnam Memorial, and the outside of the White House—all before lunch. Bless the mighty mitochondria of my leg muscle cells! We took pictures outside of the White House because we couldn’t go in, but I’m fine with that. My aunt and uncle decided not to go to Monticello and Mount Vernon because they were too far. Sorry about that. The same fate befell the Roosevelt Memorial (both of them), the Pentagon, and the National Museum of Health and Medicine. I wanted to go to the last one because they had real body parts on display and there were stuffed germs in the gift shop. If we went, there wouldn’t be any question as to what I’d get you, but because we didn’t, I’m sad all the same. <br>This disappointment was somewhat alleviated by visiting the International Spy Museum. Their cafй, Spy City, had a wide range of hot dogs, but I don’t like hot dogs. My cousin Tony did, though, and had loads of cheese on his. How nauseating. I ordered a Panini. The museum, however, was not free because it was not part of the Smithsonian. But it was worth it because we had to assume aliases and anyone who knew me in elementary school knows that I love using fake names (I used my pen name on their valentines once). I was 13 year old Jane Meyer, who went to Ireland on a vacation (I wish it was for real). We had to withstand questioning by computerized guards and we crawled through air ducts to spy on people in the museum. There were real gadgets that real spies used, like a lipstick gun (Tony wondered if the spy using it would accidentally shoot him/herself because they forgot that it was a gun) and a shoe whose heel was actually an empty compartment. We also saw the history of espionage, and learned shocking things along the way. Did you know that George Washington started and led the nation’s first spy ring? Julia Child once served in the OSS and Alexander the Great read his soldiers’ mail to see whether they were loyal or not. At the end, we found our houses on Google Earth and shopped in the gift shop. On Google Earth I found the neighborhood near the Bolsa Chica Wetlands. Be afraid. Be very, very afraid. I also found my house, by the way. Tony bought a mosquito prankster that buzzed in dark areas to annoy the occupants of the room. He pulled the prank on Frank (hey they rhyme!), who was nearly driven to insanity before he “spied” on Tony while my cousin replaced the prankster thing in his shoe. On hindsight, I really ought to have bought you a handheld lie detector. It would come in handy the next time someone violates one of your rules. <br>The Spy Museum really had an effect on me. While we waited to get our pizzas (that was dinner), I was suspiciously eying everyone. After all, about one third of the tourist population in DC are spies. I paid the most attention to people with bags because you can hide cameras and disguises in there. Because Sarah bought Tony books on the CIA and the FBI, I read those books while he immersed himself in Harry Potter and his Nintendo DS. I think I’ll be a scientist for the CIA. <br>—Jenny <br><br>Day Six: April 10, 2008<br>Dear Mrs. Fallace,<br>I went to the Capitol today with the others at 7:30 just to get tickets for the tours. Can you believe that you have to present yourself in order to get a ticket? No one can get more than one. It’s annoying because my biological clock cannot wake up at 4:30 (that’s Irvine time for 7:30). I envy you—you get to sleep in, and your biological clock isn’t thrown out of whack because you’re not on the other side of the country.<br>Our tour was scheduled for 12:45 so we toddled off to see some art at the National Gallery of Art, East Building. All I have to say is that some of the contemporary paintings displayed there were quite a waste of canvas. What is so artistic about two vertical lines on a blissfully blank canvas? Would you call that art? We then briefly toured the West Building, which was much better than the East Building in my opinion, even if they showcased quite an array of nudes and scantily clad people. We even saw the painting of Ginevra de’Bedici by Leonardo daVinci. Time soon ran out so we went back to the Capitol and toured the place. It is absolutely lavish. The place is practically stuffed with ornate carvings, chandeliers, paintings, and so on. If those were the results of our tax money, I am going to be so angry. There is a spot where all four zip codes used in DC come together, and we took pictures of it. Then, we went to see the Senate and the House of Representatives. In the Senate gallery, I saw where our current presidential candidates sat in the room. Clinton sits a few rows behind Obama, who sits in the front. McCain sits on the other side of the room from them, in the Republican side. He sits near the back. Uncle Frank insisted we sneak into the House gallery, and we succeeded, although I strongly disapproved of it. There we saw Nancy Pelosi </p>

            <p>I do hope no one else from C&amp;S frequents this Board. Especially Maikke-Fluffy.<br>But Sed, you asked for it...<br>To anyone else: <i>This</i> writing sample is Alternate Universe. It is a Narnia Fanfic where the Pevensies stay and Susan marries Caspian. After their wedding dance, Susan decides that Caspian needs to have a dance lesson.<br><br><b>A Lesson in Painless Waltzing</b><br>“Come <i>on</i>, Caspian!”<br>“My dear, I do not wish to—“<br>“You are going to, and I will not be dissuaded. Do you know how <i>crushed</i> my toes felt after that dance?”<br>The rest of the Pevensie siblings and Trumpkin looked on amusedly as Susan Pevensie literally dragged her newly-wedded husband into the ballroom. Said king was struggling all the while with a childish pout on his face. <br>“I do not see the reason in this, my Queen,” the King of the Telmarines and Narnians grumbled as Susan proceeded to plant him firmly in a seat. <br>The Gentle Queen scowled at him in a most ungentle way. “Your problem is that while you know the steps, you don’t know how to do the dance with a partner without giving them toe injuries. We’re changing that today.” She turned to Peter. “All right; come over here. We’re going to teach Caspian dear how to do a proper waltz <i>without stepping on people’s toes</i>.”<br>The High King of Narnia smirked a little, still finding the situation funny beyond reckoning. He approached her and placed one hand on her waist. Susan put one hand flat against her brother’s shoulder before taking his other hand. Finally, she gave the minstrel who was also in the room a signal to start playing. <br>A little waltz started. Susan and Peter danced slowly, while Susan chanted “One-two-three, one-two-three…see, his feet aren’t pulverizing mine…one-two-three...” <br>Pretty soon it was Caspian who was dancing with her, and doing a terrible job at it. The word ‘ow’ was slowly becoming an overused interjection for Susan. <br>“You know, Su, you can always let Caspian lead,” commented Edmund as Susan took a seat, bending down to massage her aching toes. Caspian sat next to her with a ‘see-I-told-you-so’ look on his face. <br>His older sister glowered at him. “Pray tell, Ed, will there <i>be</i> a difference?”<br>Their Dear Little Friend Trumpkin tilted his head a little and said shrewdly, “If you let him lead, your Majesty, at least you will be able to <i>avoid</i> his feet. You are already able to feel him moving forward with the hand on his shoulder there, so it is a simple matter to move with him.”<br>Susan shrugged. “It can’t hurt to try, DLF.” Sooner or later she and Caspian were in the dance position again, ready to waltz. <br>As they began to move, Susan fought the urge to lead him and instead opted to follow his footing. Trying her hardest not to look down, she closed her eyes and braced herself for a bout of pain that would certainly occur if he stepped on her feet again…<br>…It never came. Her eyes slowly opened again at the end of the dance to see her husband grinning smugly at her. “Looks like Trumpkin was right,” he murmured in her ear. <br>Susan laughed, admitting defeat. But her laughter died out as she noticed that his face was dangerously close to hers. She closed her eyes again as she closed the distance between their lips. <br>“So I guess the lesson is over, aye?” muttered Edmund. Peter merely grimaced. No matter how happy he had felt when Aslan noted the feelings Caspian and Susan felt for one another and therefore allowed them to stay, he still felt his big brother protectiveness struggling to kick in whenever Caspian and Susan showed public displays of affection. <br>Peter tried to grin and bear it, mentally beating back the protectiveness with Rhindon. “It would seem that way, yes,” he replied. <i>They’re happy and love each other very much. There’s no need to step in</i>, he reminded himself.<br>Lucy smiled. “Well, now that Caspian can do a waltz without stepping on toes, I think we need to teach him the <i>minuet</i> without crippling people for life as well.”<br>Caspian, who heard Lucy, groaned.</p>

            <p><i>From my previous post</i>...<br><br>(forgive any spelling errors), who is the Speaker of the House. On the other hand, Dick Cheney is the President of the Senate. In the House wing we also saw the spot where John Quincy Adams died while serving as a representative. He died during a House meeting, and the cause was a cardiac arrest. Did you know that he slept through some, if not many of those meetings? I once slept during class in sixth grade when we were studying the ancient Greeks. Thank God the teacher wasn’t lecturing at the time. <br>When we left the building, problems arose. Tony and Ashley had, by the looks of it, fast metabolisms, and therefore were hungry. Sarah accused Frank of wanting to starve us. He wanted to get us to Union Station for lunch, and when Sarah told him that it would probably be too far, he lost his temper. They had a little screaming match, and then Frank leaves us to go back to the hotel. Bad move—Sarah then assumed that he was deserting us and hammered another nail into his coffin. We ended up spending the afternoon without him. So our little troop headed back to the art museum to see if they had a restaurant. They did, but it was closed. We then browsed around in the gift shop and there I bought a little black guidebook to go with my journal (these letters) and the photos I took. I think that would be a nice present, wouldn’t you agree?<br>—Jenny <br>Dear Mrs. Fallace,<br>We spent the rest of the afternoon enclosed in soap-operatic drama. Eating lunch at the National Museum of the American Indian (where we went after the art galleries) is strongly not recommended because the chicken soup is spicy, and the buffalo burger, according to Tony, was flavorless. The only interesting thing about lunch was that it was Native American fare. Afterward we only had half an hour to go through a bit of the museum before it closed. I wasn’t all too interested in the Native Americans, so I nearly bolted out of the exhibit at the fifteen-minute-before-this-museum-closes warning. Aunt Sarah wasn’t too pleased with that because she had wanted to come here. <br>When we got back to the hotel, the real drama began. Aunt Sarah screamed at Uncle Frank for about an hour straight. They’ve got plenty of parallels with Ron and Hermione in the Harry Potter books all right. Sarah accused Frank of ignoring her achievements, and instead focusing on her failures, “putting her down” as we say. She was in such a sour mood that she nearly left for Pennsylvania a day early! (We were going to visit Pennsylvania to go to the Longwood Gardens and see an old friend of my aunt’s.) In the end, we kids had to make Uncle Frank swear to God that he wouldn’t lose his temper and yell at any family member anymore. So far he has kept his oath, but I’m not going to trust that. <br>We’re going to Pennsylvania tomorrow and it’s going to be a long car drive. Aunt Sarah has rented a car now, but we walked around DC and wore our feet to their metatarsals. What a lovely trip.<br>—Jenny <br><br>Day Seven: April 11, 2008<br>Dear Mrs. Fallace,<br>Wow, the Longwood Gardens are so lovely! I took so many pictures of it. It is simply splendid. What is not splendid, however, is the long drive that we endured just to get here. Uncle Frank nearly broke his vow. But they haven’t sued for divorce yet, and that is a good thing. <br>There simply aren’t enough adjectives in this language to describe the beauty and majesty of these gardens, so I’ll fast forward to my aunt’s friend’s house and family. She has a son named Anderson and a daughter named Alina. Alina is eleven, and she’s in fifth grade. Apparently their fifth grade is like our seventh grade because they’ve already learned what we’ll be learning in May. Alina also acts like a seventh grader with her manner of dressing (she always buys at Aeropostale, and would never touch Abercrombie or Hollister, the “preppy” stores, with a ten foot long pole) and her lifestyle (she gossips, stereotypes, surfs the internet, and obsesses over My Chemical Romance, especially Ray Toro’s afro and Gerard Way’s looks.) Her teachers only assign about 2 minutes’ worth of homework every night, so she has plenty of time to do what she wants. (and no, I don’t want to go to her school. I like it here at Venado.) We slept over at their house. <br>Tomorrow we’re flying home. I can’t wait to see you again. <br>—Jenny<br><br>Last Day: April 12, 2008<br>Dear Mrs. Fallace,<br>I’m heading back to good old Irvine now. I can’t wait for Monday. I want to see Brittany and Christina’s faces when I give them their little presents. I want to give Mr. Angel the document replicas to display in his classroom. But most of all, I want to see you again, and learn everything you can teach me about Biology before June. Can you believe how quickly time has gone by? Soon I’ll be an eighth grader and I won’t be little Jenny, the teacher’s pet anymore. That’s probably a hard thing to go through—letting your students go; especially those that did well in your class and who you wish you could teach again. (I bet you won’t be so misty-eyed seeing the “bad kids” off, though) But maybe I’m wrong and maybe I’m right. All I know now is that now I’m sitting in an airplane seat, feeling my ears pop and watching the plane’s progress on a map, watching it slowly take me back home.<br>—Jenny <br></p>

            <p>I have a horse owned by another character. It&#39;s called Methusel (no description yet). I keep thinking that it sounds familiar, like I&#39;ve pulled a Paolini and transposed letters or added/deleted some.

            <p>Ah, but that&#39;s where miracles come in. Or, if you prefer, miracles masquerading as microevolution.<br><br>I&#39;d tend to suspect that the horse was based on Methuselah&#39;s name anyway, if only because of the excessive similarity between them. And, after all, living 969 years is an impressive enough accomplishment that the name&#39;s crept out into our culture. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah/">Wikipedia article</a> has the following under &quot;see also:&quot;<br><br># Back to Methuselah, a set of plays by George Bernard Shaw<br># Methuselah Mouse Prize<br># Methuselah (tree)<br># &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot;, an episode of Star Trek<br># 2000 Year Old Man, a recurring Methuselah comedy routine by Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks.<br># Methuselah&#39;s Children, a work of fiction by Robert A.

            <p>A while ago, I encountered a mildly horrifying Sweeney Todd slashfic. In this fic, Anthony rapes Todd. No, I did not switch those names around by accident. I&#39;m sure you can see exactly why this needs to die.<br><br>My problem is, what disguises should my Bad Slashers use? My first thought was police, but if Sweeney Todd wakes up to find two policemen in his barber shop he&#39;s likely to panic and do something messy to them. Random Victorian London inhabitants? Should Skyfire disguise herself as a boy, since she&#39;s probably not worn a dress since puberty and would be unable to walk in a Victorian womans&#39; outfit?</p>

            <p>Seeing Rapist!Anthony was kind of like the fanfic version of being violently savaged by a baby rabbit.<br><br>Sky can&#39;t very well go as a woman in male clothing in Victorian London and she&#39;d be unable to move if she wore appropriate womens&#39; clothing, so it looks like a male disguise is the best way. She would probably make an even less convincing boy than Johanna does if it wasn&#39;t for the Disguise Generator ... But then that may spoil the funny of another mission I wanted to do later, in which all four of my agents wind up getting gender-bent without their consent. (The Sue in that one drags Harry, Ron and Draco through a portal which turns them into beautiful Arabian handmaidens. Yeah.)

            <p>(I&#39;d have emailed this out to interview participants, but really, there aren&#39;t enough of you!)<br><br>Simple question, really: With the vast majority of people in this fanfic community being female, with many of them writing with the expectation that their readers will be women, do you ever have times when being male makes you feel set apart from the rest of us? Either in a good or bad way, or really just anything noticeable that makes you aware of the gender difference.<br><br>(I really should have included this in the interviews. Alas, my list of questions that I &#39;should have&#39; asked is almost rivalling the original for sheer length. This is a Bad Thing.

            <p>I&#39;m not a prolific fanfic writer by any stretch of the imagination, and I&#39;m not a prolific fanfic reader either. I tend to write personal OC projects and plays and stuff (which I have about ten going right now), so I&#39;m stuck more in a male-dominated domain of OC writing, particularly in the genres I write in (noir, drama, thriller etc.). But if anything makes me aware of the gender difference, it&#39;s the slash and Suefics. There&#39;s something odd about going to look at fanfic for any given canon (say, for example, Heroes, which logically would have more male viewers), and seeing 90% of the fics being self-inserts or Sues (including one named after that bloody Twilight canon Sue) trying to get their rocks off with the main character (say, for example, Peter Petrelli). It&#39;s an odd experience, but not one I&#39;m crazy angry about or care about a lot.</p>

            <p>I dunno. Since my original fanfiction was within the Pokemon fandom, which has a surprisingly large amount of male writers, I can&#39;t really answer the question the same way.<br><br>The only thing that frequently sets me apart is the fact that people often assume I AM female, rather than male. I&#39;ve only ever been amused by this, but it is a frequent question. I have noticed I do tend to have a different writing style than many females, prefering to break the cliches rather than reinforce them (No Prince Charming, sorry!). Male stories that I have read do tend to focus more on action - actual getting the story to go ahead, but all good male writers I&#39;ve read do acknowledge the need for romance and emotions.<br><br>So, I suppose my point is that it is easier to notice a good male writer because they know when to use emotion, something many females tend to get wrong, unfortunately (Again, represented by the Prince Charming figure). I know I&#39;m rambling, so I&#39;ll sum it up.<br><br>1) Only difference is people usually assume I&#39;m female.<br><br>None of my stories really portray males and females in their traditional roles. For example, the toughest character in my first story was male, based on strength, however, he could have his ass handed to him by my female character since she had a very good knowledge of martial arts.<br><br>Ok, done rambling.

            <p>I try very hard not to assume a writer is female, but it&#39;s so hard not to; it&#39;s definitely a point worth including in my (already-many-words-over-limit) essay. :)<br><br>I do want to note that, of female writers, the best ones I&#39;ve known are also those that break the cliches; the <i>Wicked</i> fanfic I mentioned below was boring because of its cliches. I&#39;ll freely admit that I like a fuzzy, fluffy romance where it all works out Happily Ever After (and if Prince Charming is in-character for the original canon, then all the better), but cliches are dull, and really, that sort of fluff is best kept in a one-shot. <br><br>Now I&#39;m sounding all defensive. Didn&#39;t mean to. That&#39;s my form of rambling, I guess. Cheers!</p>

            <p>... but for some reason I assumed that TS&#39;s author was male (which I apologise to her for even if I won&#39;t apologise for anything else). Possibly because about 75% of furries are gay men and that overrode the &quot;90% of fanfic writers are girls&quot; thing in my brain.</p>

            <p>Let me preface this by saying that I am a rather girly boy. The vast majority of my friends in high school were girls. I read <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> because I wanted to. I appreciate a good romance every bit as much as a good adventure, and get just as annoyed as Mom does when Dad asks the inevitable &quot;did they win?&quot;.<br><br>I agree with Leto, by the way - Mercedes Lackey is a tremendous author, and definitely one of my favorites. She&#39;s on my list, along with Lewis, Tolkien, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Neal Stephenson.<br><br>Anyways, back to the question at hand. There are times, both while reading published fiction and fanfiction, that it&#39;s quite obvious that the story was written by a woman for women. They fall into two main categories - bad thinking and bad biology.<br><br>Bad thinking is (fortunately) by far the most prevalent. There have been lots of moments in stories where I&#39;ve thought &quot;wait, guys don&#39;t think like that.&quot; It&#39;s usually minor enough that I think of it as an error like a plothole or a typo.<br><br>Obviously, there is enough variation in guys that as long as a character stays in-character for himself, he can think a little bit (or a large bit) strangely. It&#39;s just the occasional &quot;wait, what?&quot; moments that are confusing.<br><br>When it happens, bad biology is a lot more annoying. I won&#39;t go into details here, because the more common mistakes are definitely not PG-13. (E-mail me if you&#39;re morbidly curious - Techno.Dann(at)gmail.)<br><br>My advice for writers is fairly simple - if you&#39;re worried about making mistakes when it comes to writing the opposite gender, find someone who is said opposite gender who you can ask the embarrassing questions.<br><br>I really don&#39;t feel set apart from the community because of my gender - thanks to the Internet, everyone is a user name and a few paragraphs of text. Sure, I know that the vast majority of you out there are girls, but that isn&#39;t shoved in my face on a regular basis like it would be if we met face-to-face. The biggest things that stand out to me are errors in writing.</p>

            <p>This &quot;bad thinking&quot; definition is very helpful; now that you say it, I remember reading a <i>Wicked</i> romance fic where the male lead was just... not completely out of character, but so obviously acting out this girl&#39;s idea of Prince Charming that it didn&#39;t feel like a real story anymore. <br><br>Sorry, rambling.

            <p>I don:t know about other guys, but my main view at it is preference.  My favourite published author is a woman, Mercedes Lackey.  (I know the hissing starts now) but I like the way that she writes.  That doesn:t mean that all of her work is really good, or even mediocre, but her gems outway the busts in my opinion.<br><br>This has bering on my view of fanfiction.  Because I have read books by both male and female authors, reading the fanfiction of the opposing gender is interesting.  LotR is a prime example.  Unfortunatly, the majority of the fanfiction is about a mary sue falling into middle earth, which is interesting because there are increadibly few actual relationships in the serise.  There is a fundamental shift in the point of view.<br><br>While I am not saying that men don:t write relationship stories, it is just that there is less emphasis on the relationship aspect of the story unless it is key to the plot (Terry Pratchett &quot;Wintersmith&quot; or Terry Brooks Shannara serise (a couple of them)).<br><br>To answer the question:  No, I personally don:t feal set apart because the fics are something that I would have never conciders (I am only counting well writen ones in this category)  Which I hope is the same for the reverse.<br><br>Leto</p>

            <p>I think it is because they don&#39;t attempt to avoid  Ferris being a Stu. <br><br>He is, and Ferris definitely knows it, and uses it to his advantage in the movie.

            <p>I think certain characters just reach a point where they&#39;re so much a part of our heritage that we accept they&#39;re Mary-Sues / Gary-Stus, but we can forgive them. I mean, with Mary Poppins, it says she&#39;s &#39;Practically Perfect in Everyway&#39; so we know what to expect. Same with Ferris Bueller. The movie starts very confidantly, and we expect him to succeed. If he hadn&#39;t there would have been many feelings of disappointment, huh?</p>

            <p>Obviously, there are Sue characters in original fiction, but do we still <i>call</i> them &#39;Sues&#39;? I mean, as far as I know, the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot; applies only to fanfiction characters inserted into someone else&#39;s word. (And personally, at least &#39;formally&#39;, I think it should stay that way.)</p>

            <p>They&#39;re called Canon Sues, and there&#39;s an LJ group devoted to them named, aprops enough, canon_sues.  The main character of Cassie Clare&#39;s original fic trilogy has been pegged as one.  The first two books have been sporked and I&#39;m working on sporking the third.  Oh, and there&#39;s another trilogy set to kick off in 2010.  I look forward to shredding that one as well.<br><br>Anthony Caine of For Better or For Worse has also been identified as a Canon Stu.</p>

            <p>The only thing that differentiates a Canon Sue from a Mary Sue is the type of fic they reside in.  There are tests out there online to tell if your original character is a &#39;Sue.<br><br>One glaring sign your character might be a Sue is if she and the hottie who&#39;ve been lusting after one another for an entire novel find out they&#39;re actually brother and sister at the end, and in the next novel of the trilogy they spend pretty much the entire thing drooling over one another and not one single person around them slaps them up and says, &quot;Hello, incest?&quot;.  If, when the third novel opens, she&#39;s having a Sad Moment because *sniffleweep* her brother is acting like he has no feelings for her anymore and she was just So!Sure he really did and now she feels like a knife has been driven through her heart.  It only took him the entire last novel to finally say, &quot;Yeah, we really should cool it&quot; and then he had to go and ruin it with body language and actions and tone of voice that made it abundantly clear he was doing it only out of extreme reluctance.  I have no idea how much incestuous lusting the third novel of Cassie Clare&#39;s trilogy is packed with, but considering she remarks that the character on the front cover of Novel three comes between Canon Sue and her Incestuous Lust Interest, I feel secure in saying there&#39;s plenty to be had and that it won&#39;t turn out to be incest after all because *gaspsurprise* he&#39;s not actually her brother.  He was confused/switched at birth with her real brother so it&#39;s perfectly fine for them to be shagging like nymphos deprived for a year.  *rolls eyes muchly*</p>

            <p>I mean, I LIKE Mary Poppins, and isn&#39;t half the definition of a Sue the fact that almost everyone hates her? There are (fanfic) characters around that have almost every Sueish quality imaginable, but remain good characters because they are interesting and well-written.<br><br>And it&#39;s too easy to hurt feelings this way.

            <p>There are a number of characters I can completely agree <i>are</i> Suvian - but I don&#39;t let that bother me. (Doublethink, much?)<br><br>Honor Harrington, for instance. I sometimes say that she overcomes Sueness by excessive application of the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfAwesome">Rule of Awesome</a>, but that&#39;s not really the case. After all, one of the contributors to Suvianity is being awesome.<br><br>And to top that off, I couldn&#39;t even begin to tell you why I like Sue!Honor but not, for instance, the protagonist of the Truth series by Dawn Cook - a series I put down sometime in the third book specifically because I didn&#39;t like how Suvian she was becoming.<br><br>So, to conclude, while you&#39;re probably right about the list being a bad idea and feelings getting hurt, it&#39;s by no means inevitable.</p>

            <p>You could probably report it to either. One thing you should find out first is whether the UK has laws based on internet harrassment. It&#39;s likely they do in this day and age. You can try contacting them, and the mods, first. If they say go chat up the US folks, do that.<br><br>I know for sure the US has federal laws about harrassment on the internet; I was the subject of it once. My dad went a little trigger-happy and wanted them arrested because they could have been. It&#39;s pretty serious, so I&#39;m sure wherever you go they&#39;ll take *you* seriously.<br><br>Also, if you have any screencaps or downloaded evidence of this guy, or if anyone else does, it would be good to keep handy and present it. The more hard evidence the better. The mods might be useful for that.</p>
