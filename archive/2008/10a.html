            <p>For sheer firepower, one really can&#39;t beat the Retribution-class Battleship - nine torpedo tubes and strength twelve port and starboard weapons batteries (and three lance turrets) provides quite a bit of punch.<br><br>In terms of effectiveness, though, I&#39;d recommend the torpedo-carrying Dautless class light cruisers.

Besides, Sun Crushers wouldn&#39;t last long in a 40k-verse: no protection from the Warp, let alone against a Sue!psyker playing pinball with the brains of the pilot, or any Eldar.

            <p>I&#39;ve finally gotten around to posting my first sporking. It&#39;s a Fable fic (PC and Xbox RPG with a medieval magic and swords setting, but it differs by taking very little seriously, as with most Lionhead games), but there really isn&#39;t that much to do with Fable in it. The first chapter has none of the characters in and I think the entire fic has three Canon characters out of the dozens available. Well, there is Theresa in the first chapter, but she&#39;s clearly fake, so I don&#39;t count her.<br><br>This was one of my first sporkings (written around a year ago) and is not one of my best in my opinion (I wanted to start off with a dirt-free fic before delving into the horrors of Resident Evil X and the rest of AFF). So, at the risk of quoting the Suethors, be nice.<br><br><a href="http://thejadedfalcon.livejournal.com/"><a href="http://thejadedfalcon.livejournal.com/">http://thejadedfalcon.livejournal.com/</a></a></p>

            <p>Recently, during an RP, Cirichen discovered an amazing thing. Punctuation is edible! She found this out by taking a bite from an exclamation mark smebody dropped.<br><br>After an intensive taste-test trial conducted by Trojie, Plat and Cassie, we have discovered the basic flavours of each type of punctuation. The list is as follows:<br><br>!  chocolate, with a hint of spices<br>”  bacon and eggs<br>£  sauerkraut<br>$  buttered potatoes<br>%  curry<br>^  bouillabaisse<br>&amp;  pistachios<br>*  pizza<br>(  nougat<br>_  pork sausages<br>-  bagel<br>+  cheese<br>=  chewing gum<br>{  fried fish<br>[  apple sauce<br>:  beef stroganoff with rice<br>;  bananas<br>@  choc chip biscuit<br>’  never ending gobstopper, many flavours<br>~  roast chicken<br>#  broccoli<br>,  caramel<br>.  Cornish pasty<br>?  borscht - an East European beetroot soup<br>/  enchiladas<br><br>Another thing we have discovered is that the font affects the flavour. For example, a % mark, which has the basic flavour of curry, tastes like korma in Arial font, whereas in Times New Roman it could taste of tikka masala.<br><br>Anyway. We hope that this information is of use to you all, particularly Agents who land up in a fic with a lot of unnecessary punctuation around and no rations with them.

            <p>...punctuation behaved differently in Word Worlds to other places. After all, in Word Worlds, punctuation is part of what they&#39;re made of.

            <p>I think the way I saw it was that, as Trojie said, in the Real World punctuation isn&#39;t edible (unless somebody made punctution shaped chocolate or something, but I digress), whereas in RP-land and the Board, it is edible, and has all those lovely flavours. <br><br>However!<br><br>In HQ, we have seen people collect extra punctuation from missions and bring it back. I know I&#39;ve seen Agents take punctuation into fics, too. What I was proposing was that the unnecessary pieces could be used as a food supply for Agents, now that this new discovery has been made.<br><br>As for ideas springing fully formed into things, there are plenty of ideas that have become things in HQ as well as the Board when nobody really intended them to. Witness the Ypurs, for example, or the swearwords. I&#39;m fairly sure that &quot;Glaurung&quot; wasn&#39;t intended to be used by Agents when it was thought up, but within months it became all the rage at HQ.<br><br>...<br><br>Anyone else like to present an opinion?

            <p>Doubly so because just because things manifest one way sometimes (ie, punctuation that we can hammer into place in a fic) doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll ALWAYS manifest that way - HQ doesn&#39;t like to be that predictable. <br><br>(And when I asked about Real World, I *was* making a joke. ;p )</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;m planning on being in England for a month-long Medieval English Lit course this spring, provided all goes well with the application and I don&#39;t run out of money. I know I&#39;ll have some time to myself while I&#39;m there, and I&#39;d love to meet up with some of you across the pond. The term runs from about the middle of April to the middle of May and we&#39;ll be staying somewhere in London. I don&#39;t know much more than that yet--like which weekends will be free ones--but if it sounds plausible to anyone, I&#39;ll keep you up to date with the schedule. There should be plenty of advance notice. So, who might be interested in showing a displaced American how not to look like an idiot tourist? ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh, who has wanted to make this trip for years.</p>

            <p>Basically, for part of my GCSE coursework, I&#39;m going to be writing an essay comparing how Austen writes her characters compared to how Fanwriters do the same. Since I have both a copy of the book and a badfic, I&#39;m halfway there. But what I&#39;d love to do is to find a Pride and Prejudice <i>goodfic</i>, and compare how a fanwriter with demonstrated knowledge of the P&amp;P-verse writes the same characters to how a Suethor writes the same ones.<br><br>So, this brings me to my main question: has anyone found any Pride &amp; Prejudice goodfic out there? Obviously, I&#39;ll be looking as well, but since a lot of you have probably been in fandom in general a lot longer than I have, I figured that you might have found a couple of things that are archived on more obscure websites (such as a personal LJ that not many people visit)?<br><br>Sorry if I&#39;ve come across as condescending, lazy, etc., but I&#39;d really love to go that step further and get an A*, and I figure that you&#39;d be the people who&#39;ll have found that gem among the horseshit, forgive the metaphor.<br><br>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Just don&#39;t look for it on fanfiction.net.  Most of the bad stuff infests the Pit. If you want to check out goodfic, go to:<br><br><a href="http://www.austen.com/derby/"><a href="http://www.austen.com/derby/">http://www.austen.com/derby/</a></a><br><br>and start reading. Almost all of those stories have few, if any, annoying original characters.  In fact, about 85% of them are plausible AUs. Be sure to go to Epilogue Abbey, though, because Fantasia Gallery hosts the &quot;modern&quot; P&amp;P adaptations. <br><br>Another good site is the <a href="http://www.pemberley.com/bin/boiarchive/archive.cgi?category=PandP">Republic of Pemberley&#39;s fanfic.<br><br><br><br></a></p>

Are we permitted to conduct missions in forbidden continua, if we find fic for it?<br>2. Are we permitted to have agents that come from the forbidden continua?

            <p>If the author has forbidden fanfiction, there isn&#39;t likely to be any badfic for us to kill, is there? And if there <i>is</i> it&#39;s a whole different problem. As for agents from the forbidden continua... We need to remember that the PPC is essentially fanfiction. A rather odd genre of fanfiction, but fanfiction all the same. I&#39;m no permission giver but I&#39;m gonna have to say we&#39;re probably not allowed to use forbidden characters.</p>

            <p>If the author doesn&#39;t want fanfic written at all, then it might be tactful not to touch it, but at the same time, can we suffer those badfics to live? It depends on how much you consider the PPC to be fanfiction in the general sense. <br><br>You could also take the point of view of HQ as a Real Place; what would the Flowers think? I mean, badfic is badfic, and ruins the canon no matter what the author&#39;s opinion. If we WERE actual agents walking around, particularly if we love those stories, I&#39;d say there&#39;s more of an incentive to PPC them, not less.<br><br>But I doubt anyone reading our missions will see it the same way. Probably more tactful not to PPC it. I don&#39;t, however, see much of a problem with having an agent from that continuumn, so long as the Vampire features aren&#39;t their main characteristics.</p>

            <p>I know it has been a while since I last posted but I am floating around silently.<br><br>On the question I would, in my very limited way, agree that if the author has requested that no fanfiction be written about their constructions that it be left alone.   As an author myself I know that I would take gret offense at bad fanfiction writers distorting my creations and would even look a little sideways at good fanfiction because I would worry that the fanfiction may interfer with the canon.   With regard to the second point, again taking the attuide of an author I would say that having agents from that canon would be ok.   After all most fandoms are simply huge and the author in question only deals with a small percentage of the people.<br><br>My two cents on the subject.   Sorry if anybody considers me a little .............   I am not trying to be.</p>

            <p>Aren&#39;t there moments of the day when something happens and you immediately think of the PPC? Like when your best friend gets a pimple behind her ear and says, &quot;Well, at least it&#39;s not on my forehead&quot; and you&#39;re tempted to mention the Ironic Overpower. Or maybe that time when you got a shiny new cutting board made from acacia wood.

            <p>I keep on thinking (but not actually saying so far) &#39;stop making Mini-mes&#39; every time someone misspells my name. My surname is pretty rare and even the college library has managed to get it wrong (even though I write it down for them) and my given name has two common spellings and people tend to go for the shorter (by one whole letter) one. It&#39;s a good thing that Minis don&#39;t exist, or I&#39;d have a whole pack of them.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not a tremendous expert in either fandom, but I would say so - the Crucible seems to be a brute-force weapon, not relying on any of the subtleties of the Hammerverse.

            <p>I’ve been trying to come up with a comedy song for a bard to sing in a Fable fic of mine. I’ve come up with this. It’s based off of something one of you said about a year or so ago about (I think) the amount of Sues that have always known Middle-Earth was a real place (shortly before turning into elves). Someone then said something about why there were no Sues who knew the Silmarillion was real, then it turned out it wasn’t. I thought that was an amusing idea, so I turned it into a song. If it’s cheesy, that’s possibly even better. The bards of Fable are pretty rubbish. Any improvements would be welcome. The song ends when it does because Marek (main character) leaves the room at that point as an excuse so that I don’t have to write any more, but if you want to continue it, feel free.<br><br><i>Some tales have a hero,<br>Others have none,<br>But this is a tale,<br>Of someone really dumb.<br><br>All heroes need a name,<br>Mary-Sue was ours,<br>A princess by birth and nature,<br>She was like one of the stars.<br><br>Her beauty was great,<br>Her tongue was witty,<br>Or so she thought,<br>She was really a ninny.<br><br>She claimed to be intelligent,<br>But forgot two plus two,<br>She was as nosy as an aardvark,<br>And about as sensible too.<br><br>So it was that she crept,<br>One night into her father’s study,<br>It would have worked,<br>If her shoes were not muddy.<br><br>She found a large book,<br>Red jacket and hard-backed,<br>Which predictably she read,<br>Not as fiction but fact.<br><br>It told an epic tale,<br>About a magnificent gem,<br>If she ever got the hang of sharing,<br>Luckily, there were three of them.<br><br>They were shiny,<br>They were bright,<br>One was coated in phosphorus,<br>To stand out at night.<br><br>So she started on a journey,<br>Through mountains and mist,<br>To find a great artefact,<br>Which didn’t exist.</i></p>

            <p>So I&#39;ve been around since August 18 (the day the Ypur invasion began, no less), and I&#39;ve FINALLY decided to ask for the permission to join.  Without further ado, let us begin the great <s>begging and groveling before the Permission Givers</s> Permission Asking!<br><br>Agents:<br><br>Agent Yuki: An anthropomorphic Froslass, Yuki is calm, level-headed, and is rarely without a cool reply.  Unless fire is involved, because fire is NO GOOD for ice-type Pokemon.  We are not going to get into that, however.  Yuki likes cold places, and in the absence of cold she uses her ice attacks to make things cold.  She is protective of her home canon, but doesn&#39;t mind going out to freeze &#39;Sues in other continua.<br><br>Yuki is a floater, and focuses mainly on the Pokemon canon.<br><br>Yuki appears to be in her mid-twenties with white skin and hair, like a ghost.  Her eyes are electric blue with yellow sclerae, a trait all Froslass exhibit.  She likes wearing her hair in a bun and a red sash around her waist.<br><br>Agent Alexander &quot;Kip&quot; von Tepesblut:  A vampire, albeit a bit less stable than most.  Appearing about 18, he whines, sulks, and swears when things don&#39;t go his way, and he possesses a questionable sense of humor.  He has no moral issues against killing, but such things are trivial.  Humans alone might be in danger, but Homo Sapiens Agents need not fear when there are so many OCs just ripe for the picking.<br>Ideally Kip would only have to feed every month or so, but that scenario maintains that he not get seriously injured and avoids prolonged exposure to sunlight, two conditions that he has a distinct problem with following, and therefore requires food more often than most.<br>In the event that Kip is deprived of blood, instinct takes over and things die.  He&#39;ll come out of this condition once he&#39;s full, with no recollection of what happened while driven by instinct.<br>Interestingly enough, Kip will be forced into this instinctive state if he is bitten by a zombie, although it doesn&#39;t last very long.  No one really knows why this happens, but zombies are advised against biting him.<br>Otherwise, Kip tends to be rather human in his demeanor.  He can generally pass as human, so long as he doesn&#39;t say anything incriminating or displays unnatural strength.  This tends to be a problem.<br><br>Kip is in the Department of Mary Sues, since eradicating things is mildly entertaining to him.  He should not, however, be allowed within a mile of a Twilight fanfiction.  It won&#39;t end well.<br><br>Kip is tall, lanky, and pale, with messy black hair.  He&#39;s got reddish eyes and does not sparkle in the sun.<br><br><br><br>Writing sample: <br>(from a fic I&#39;m writing in the World Ends With You canon, born when I couldn&#39;t take the bad fics on the Pit any more)<br><br>“Minamimoto-kun, would you please pay attention?”<br>The tanned 18 year-old glanced up, pausing in his half-hearted chewing of his pencil.  “Eh?”<br>“The problem on the board, if you would.”<br>Sho Minamimoto stretched with an exaggerated sigh.  He knew this already, why did they expect him to recite it over and over?  He eyed his classmates, all frantically scribbling on their papers or tapping on their calculators.  Let them think they had the answer; Sho wasn’t going to even look at the board until all of the rest had gotten some erroneous answer.<br>“Minamimoto-kun!”  The teacher glared.  It was bad enough that Sho Minamimoto had the gall to lean back in his seat, feet resting on his desk.  The boy’s arrogance, rudeness, and blatant disrespect for authority had gotten him in trouble numerous times; it was a wonder he was still in school.  He would have been thrown out ages ago, had it not been for his genius in the area of mathematics.<br>“Alright, alright.  Don’t get your integers all divided by zero, sensei.”  Sho yawned.  Several of his classmates had finished and were waiting for his answer.  A second, fake yawn, and he finally looked at his challenge.  His mind whirred, processing the mathematical conundrum.  Pencil did not meet paper, for Sho did not need the tools his fellow classmates so heavily depended on.  Ten seconds passed… fifteen… twenty… twenty-seven seconds, and he had his answer.  A twisted smirk spread over his face.<br>“It’s unsolvable.  If you do the math right, you’ll wind up with a zero in the denominator halfway through.”  His classmates stirred with disbelief.  “That can’t be right, I got four…”  “What?  I don’t see it!”  “How did he do it that quickly?!”  He grinned.  “Well, sensei, what’s the solution?  Don’t leave these radians hanging.” <br>The teacher fixed Sho with a gaze that would cause other students to recoil, before glancing at the answer in his hand.  “The answer is… none.  It is, as Minamimoto-kun said, unsolvable.”<br>Sho spread his arms.  “Soh-cah-toa.  I’d ask for another, but school’s nearly over, and my fellow students of math wouldn’t be able to obtain the desired solution in the time that’s left.  They shouldn’t have to be stuck with a time limit they can’t hope to meet.”  He knew his words would go over badly; several students growled under their breaths.  Sho didn’t care.  He didn’t need them.  They were only a few extraneous variables in a mathematical world.<br><br>(end excerpt)<br><br>I&#39;m a dork who researched Japanese school systems to get the addressing right.<br><br>I&#39;m also the idiot who decided that murdering My Immortal would be fun, and enlisted SealRat in the cause.</p>

            <p>1) I&#39;m very curious as to how an anthropomorphic Froslass could come to exist. I&#39;m not too familiar with Pokemon canon, so is this something canonically possible, a badfic glitch, or something else?<br><br>2) Is Kip a vampire from any particular continuum? He seems to have a rather strange set of characteristics, so is this a canon type of vampire, a world you&#39;re working on, an invention for the PPC, or what?<br><br>3) I see you have one Floater, one Assassin. Generally Agents have partners in their own Departments, except for single-mission transfer duty. This being HQ, &quot;tossed together by fate/random whim of Upstairs/plothole&quot; is fairly common, but it does deserve commenting on; if you were just planning on them working together as if it were normal, you might want to rethink that.<br><br>Obviously you know the answers to these, but they&#39;re my immediate concerns when it comes to Permission.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>1) It&#39;s not canonically possible, however it could logically be a badfic glitch.

He&#39;s been a character that has existed in my imagination for some time, so I&#39;d have to say my own creation.  I think he first came into being about a year and a half ago, but I&#39;m aware that the characteristics are unusual. <small>It&#39;s not because I laugh at the idea that a vampire who attacks a human with a high blood-alcohol content would become similarly drunk, honest.</small><br><br>3) Hm, well I wasn&#39;t actually planning on having them work together as normal, at least not all the time.  I couldn&#39;t find anything against having my first two Agents in different areas, but if this is a problem, I could work it out somehow.</p>

            <p>1) And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that; it&#39;s just something you need to sort out in your own mind (even if you never tell anyone about it in detail).<br><br>2) And that&#39;s fine.

Those of us who have several lines of Agents -- myself, I think Artemis did, Laburnum, a few others -- all started with one team and then introduced others.

            <p>SealRat, whom I know, decided she wants to make Kip&#39;s partner-agent person, so I hope that&#39;s cleared up.  As for Yuki, I intend to create her a partner at some point, though I&#39;m not sure about what kind of partner just yet.

            <p>I have a vampire agent too, for whenever I get my nerve up to asking Permission (mostly I&#39;ve just been too tired to write a sample lately). She&#39;s from Nyeusigrube, and she&#39;d probably go a bit psychotic (foaming at the month) at Twilight. Come to think about it, maybe I should just keep her away from those books. Far away.<br><br>...right. What I *meant* to say was, whenever I get around to asking and, hopefully, receiving Permission I&#39;d have an agent to come on the joint-vampires mission.</p>

So how does time spent in HQ compare to the time elapsed in an Agent&#39;s home continuum (in this case, World One)?<br><br>Is it like an OFU, where if the Agent returns they arrive at the exact second they left, or does an equal amount of time pass in their home world?

            <p>...I&#39;ve assumed that time in HQ is kind of like the geography.  By which I mean that it doesn&#39;t stay in place and sort of moves all over depending on the individual.  So while time is generally in tune with World One, it might also depend on how much time an Agent <i>thinks</i> has elapsed.</p>

            <p>HST is tuned to World One most of the time; New Caledonia is occupied /now/, the AD 2004 Oxford Gathering caused problems in HQ in 2004 HST, there&#39;s Laburnum&#39;s interlude, etc etc. But not all cases fit. Agent Vemi, for instance, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/thequendi/bjamvemi.html">returned</a> home &quot;only a few days after she&#39;d originally left&quot;. In general, however, HQ is synched to World One. We hope.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It would be easy to set a remote activator to a time just after the agent left. Depending on how time in HQ has treated them, there may or may not be noticeable age differences to worry about, but that&#39;s another issue, and it could probably be solved with the disguise generator or a world with a reverse time flow. The possibilities are endless, really.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... Which, as I&#39;ve been forced to explain several times already, isn&#39;t actually an &quot;essay&quot;, but that&#39;s the only phrase under eight syllables that explains it. Not argumentative - informative. Not highly formal - comfortably polite. <br><br>I&#39;m really, really sorry to be using you guys for this project yet <i>again</i>, but I&#39;m tired, and stuck, and... I love you people. *looks pathetic*<br><br>So, if you&#39;d like to try...<br><br>It&#39;s due tomorrow. Everything&#39;s done - the prose is written, the appendix arranged, the citations recorded, the bibliography (mostly) complete - but I <b>still don&#39;t have a decent TITLE</b>. Ideas I&#39;ve had so far are a bit dull: <br><br>* <i>Fanfiction: An Insider&#39;s Guide</i><br><br>* <i>Fans, Fiction, and Fact: An Insider&#39;s Guide to the World of Fanfiction</i><br><br>* <i>The World of Fanfiction: An Insider&#39;s Guide</i><br><br>See how it gets a <i>wee</i> bit repetative? They&#39;re all <i>useable</i>, but they&#39;re really not <i>good</i>.<br><br>So please; help me.<br><br>Some necessaries: <br><br>- &quot;Fanfiction&quot; must be THE prominent word. Duh. Preferably the first word, too.<br><br>- This paper is arranged to guide complete outsiders into the concept of fanfic and walk them through its conventions and problems, so &quot;guide&quot; would be a useful word - or something like it.<br>     - I&#39;ve made no secret of the fact that I&#39;m part of this world, so &quot;insider&#39;s guide&quot; type things would be appropriate.<br><br>- This is mainly about the stories, not the writers, but I like to say &quot;the WORLD OF&quot; fanfiction, or something all-encompassing like that.<br><br>- it doesn&#39;t have to have a subtitle<br><br>- it can be two words if you think that&#39;s enough; preferably not more than eight. Simple is effective<br><br>- it doesn&#39;t have to be flashy or catchy, but that would be nice<br><br>- clever puns are great so long as they&#39;re understandable to an oblivious outsider (think academics - english professors)<br><br>- alliteration (and other such devices) is/are welcome so long as it&#39;s not over-done<br><br><br>Examples from my teacher (from existing books and popular styles for this sort of writing) are:<br><br>~ <i>The Surgeon of Crowthorne: A Tale of Murder, Madness, and the Oxford English Dictionary</i>  - yes, that&#39;s a real book. Apparently it&#39;s okay. Title makes it sound even better, though *hint*<br><br>~ <i>Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the World&#39;s Greatest Scientific Problem</i>  - another a real book, which I have read. Quite good.<br><br>~ <i>Nathaniel&#39;s Nutmeg</i>  - also a real book.<br><br>~ <i>Tolkien&#39;s Nightmare: The Fans Who Changed The Story</i> - a <b>not-useable</b> title I made up in class as part of a work-up-to-the-final project assignment. <br><br>Apparently &quot;So-and-So&#39;s Mundane Item&quot; is a fairly common style, as is &quot;The Blank Which Changed the Blank&quot;. Both of which are irrelevant in this context, and just goes to show that I&#39;m up too late. <br><br>... Yeah. As you can tell by my babbling, I have NO idea what to do. I&#39;m really, really tired and about to fall into bed. I need a good title <i>tomorrow</i>.<br><br>ANY and ALL ideas are welcome. Here&#39;s some brain-fuel: *hands out chocolate in advance*<br><br>*HUGS* I swear I&#39;ll do you all some sort of favour in return. </p>

            <p>Sedri already gave you wiki link.<br><br>Prepare to be assaulted in other linkage ways.<br><br>First off, let me introduce you to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">FAQ for the Board</a>, it is rather handy for a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Newbie">newbie</a> like yourself, and I promise it shouldn&#39;t eat you or give you rabies (<s>that&#39;s me</s>). Please to be making sure to read the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Board_Constitution">Board Constitution</a> (Wiki link here, Oddlots copy is up at top of Board) too. <br><br>Here is the infamous Araeph&#39;s <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/the_ppc/20306.html">The List of Everything PPC</a>, it is really quite shiny.  There&#39;s also the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/the_ppc/18564.html">Complete List of PPC Fiction</a>, and I personally heartily recommend reading several of the longer spin off series (I would give a few examples here but it is half past midnight as I write this and my brain is currently on holiday) to get a feel for things before you try  reading things like Huinesoron&#39;s more serious PPC stuff- <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/ReorgTitle.htm">Reorganisation</a> and <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/CrashTitle.htm">Crashing Down </a>- because while fantastic, both&#39;re confusing for newbie brains. <br><br>Now, beyond that, I&#39;ll give some handy advice.<br><br>Don&#39;t be afraid of the oldbies - they don&#39;t bite (<s>that&#39;s me that bites, and I&#39;m not an oldbie, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll find a muzzle and will provide you with rabies shots afterwards</s>), definitely post so that we can get a feel for you, and all in all have fun and don&#39;t take everything seriously (well, very seriously at any rate. Serious is allowed, so long as you don&#39;t take it too far).<br><br>Another handy bit of advice is that you, as a newbie, should not be left alone with me at all, so I welcome you to break that dire warning and IM me or something. fairladypsyche on YIM and AIM and with @hotmail.com suffix for MSN (and JulyFlame-at-gmail.com for Gtalk if you&#39;d rather). To be truthful, no one should be left alone with me at all, and I&#39;m sure a few of my <s>victims</s> friends will come along, spy this, and be honest and agree and warn you, which will do nothing but get you curious and end up leading you into a trap. </p>
