            <p>I was reading through the archives of Weepingcock on LJ and someone mentioned a thread at the GodAwful FanFiction Board called &quot;It Could Be Worse&quot;, where people posted ideas for terrifyingly bad fanfic which (thankfully) hadn&#39;t been used yet.<br><br>I propose that we play a variation of this. We come up with ideas for godawful badfic premises/descriptions/OC names/Sue origin stories/pairings/whatever that we haven&#39;t seen. Others then either try to find a fic involving that concept, or write a short ficlet involving it. If they choose to write one, it could either be parody badfic, or an attempt to make the concept work.<br><br>Anyone want to play?</p>

            <p>Plat, OA and I were having an ideas session for OFUTRC the other day, and somehow we got onto the subject of OFU badfic. Mostly encouraged by Plat, the first idea we came up with was, of all things, Misslash. Yep. Miss Cass/Miss Angel.<br><br>I think there is a section on Fanficland for OFUs. What makes the idea of OFU staffslash a little worrying is that pairings that would ordinarily have been separated by time and distance suddenly become plausible. Turin/Boromir, anyone?</p>

            <p>Well, in private Miss Angel is fairly friendly and easily amused. She&#39;s incredibly sadistic and rather likes singing, occasionally making up her own little (terrible) ditties when she&#39;s in a good mood (see chapter 4, coming to an LJ near you soon). Miss Cass creeps her out sometimes. In front of the students, Miss Angel is a total bitch. Ninja drill sergeant. She&#39;s 17-going-on-18 years old.</p>

            <p>Miss Cass is actually quite fond of her colleague, and avoids creeping her out as much as possible. (It&#39;s not always possible to avoid looking creepy if the light reflects off your glasses when you smile just right.) She&#39;s not quite as sadistic, but does derive much entertainment from students suffering, although she pretends to be all sweetness and light to them. She&#39;s at the young end of 20.</p>

            <p>I think they&#39;re cute, if repetative. If written well, of course; things well-written don&#39;t feel cliche even if they&#39;re all basically the same. Then again, I find Susan/Caspian adorable, so that rather influences my judgement.</p>

            <p>The repetativeness gets to my head. And it&#39;s kind of...not expected. Susan is what, sixteen or so? (can&#39;t remember real age *feels stupid*) And although she&#39;s considered an adult in Narnia, I don&#39;t think she&#39;s one to shag anyone, even Caspian (I&#39;m also a Casue fan, but that doesn&#39;t affect much of this) before marriage.<br>And maybe it&#39;s just me and the whole &quot;teenage sexuality&quot; thing.

And lots of teenyboppers read these fics. Who knows if their first sexual encounter could be fueled by PregnantAndSeperatedFromTheSpermDonorCaspian!Susan fics?  </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll be writing the circumstances of that recruitment soon, but for now, yes, he is here, he is attached to DoSAT as a pilot and mechanic type.

            <p>Greetings, folks. I honestly can&#39;t remember how I originally came to this site, but I&#39;ve been lurking and enjoying myself reading the PPC stories for a while, and thought I&#39;d emerge from hiding at last as a newcomer to this community, and a hopeful recruit into the PPC.<br><br>My background in fanfic lies primarily in the Baldur&#39;s Gate, Warhammer 40,000, and Supreme Commander settings-I have a thing for the darker and morally ambiguous settings, and have been dealing with the issue of Mary Sue for a while-the Baldur&#39;s Gate setting in particular virtually forces a good-aligned protagonist to be a Mary Sue to some degree, and I&#39;ve enjoyed reading the stories here, getting ideas of what is and is not acceptable. I fully confess that my first attempts at fanfic writing were indeed Mary Sues, but I have since buried or rehabilitated them.<br><br>I also might as well declare my intent now to seek permission to join the PPC as a novice agent, given my background in Warhammer 40,000, with the intent to hunt down and smite, disentangle, and purge the Mary Sue, the crossover, and the badslash with extreme prejudice, starting with the Warhammer 40k fanfic sector. I&#39;ll probably post an official request for permission in the near future, but for now, this newcomer salutes you all and the laughs he&#39;s gotten out of the storie.</p>

            <p>Fangirls getting desperate for love/lust? Does this mean I may have doomed myself upon identifying myself as male?

            <p>The male of the two Agents I&#39;m considering, tentatively named Nathanos, may be something of an exception-he&#39;s definitely well built, but he also has bionic augmentation due to injuries sustained before being referred to the Ordo Hydra, also known tentatively as the Warhammer 40,000 division (So named because for every head of the Ordo&#39;s target you destroy, three more arise). Probably at least an obvious bionic hand-maybe a full arm.<br><br>Current standard armament for him is a plasma pistol and a daemonhammer (extra-large hammer, blessed for the purpose of destroying daemons, which I believe Sues count as). However, given the scope of 40k, and thus 40k badfic, destruction of the non-canon elements may require additional firepower, which is why I&#39;m considering leasing a Blackstone Fortress from Abaddon the Despoiler for planet-killing purposes. 40k won&#39;t miss a random planet. Or even a lot of random planets.</p>

            <p>Believe me, such weapons are necessary. WH40k takes place on a scale unlike most: it is entirely likely there will be not one Mary Sue, but an entire regiment of them, and removing non-canonical planets from the WH40k universe does demand planet-killing weapons, which are fortunately in abundance-any midsize starship (at least those of the Imperium of Man) has planet-killing weapons aboard, and the Imperial Inquisition has the authority to declare an order of Exterminatus, no questions asked-it&#39;s the reason I chose the Inquisition to represent the war against badfic spreading to 40k. Crossovers, you are warned.<br><br>However, while my specialization lies in Warhammer 40,000, I am also versed in several other continuums, and will happily undertake assignments against the following:<br><br>Star Trek<br>Star Wars<br>Harry Potter<br>The Inheritance Cycle (don&#39;t ask)<br>Baldur&#39;s Gate/Dungeons and Dragons in general<br><br>Exception: Lord of the Rings. Loved the movies, but it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve read the books. If I ever recieve a request to do a LotR assignment (i.e. heavier weapons than normal are needed), I would require assistance.</p>

            <p>My hitlist is already filling out nicely-I intend to hit Squad Broken, for one: the squickiest, most infamous WH40k &quot;fanfic&quot; ever to grace the general awareness of the 40k community. Really fairly tame compared to some things *coughcelebriancoughchochangcough* around here, but the 40k community normally prides itself on the general absence of slash, smutfic, etc.<br><br>Once the Ordo Hydra has finished setting up shop, however, WH40k-grade weapons will be made available to Agents upon request, assuming the flowers and senior agents do not shoot the idea down. I believe the Department of Geographical Aberrations in particular might appreciate having access to methods for erasing continents or entire planets in one strike.</p>

            <p>Necron fan here, but for the purposes of the PPC, I think I&#39;ll masquerade as a representative of the Inquisition-it would make some sense to have an Ordo Minor dedicated to the purgation of 40k fanfic, which is the background I intend to use once I work up the nerve to apply for permission.</p>

            <p>All Sues, crossovers, and badslash are to be targeted. The Agents I&#39;m considering are a junior Inquisitor and a veteran Sister of Battle, and the weapons will be whatever is available-probably a daemonhammer for the Inquisitor and an Eviscerator for the Sister.<br><br>I&#39;ve been browsing fanfiction.net for suitable targets, but the 40k fanfic-verse seems pretty well behaved, to be honest-the setting is insane enough that the presence of a Sue tends to get lost in the clutter, and 40k fanfic has a surprising number of honestly good writers. Not to say I haven&#39;t found some targets, and will probably find enough to keep me busy for the duration of my stay, but 40k fanfic is nowhere near as bad as, say, LotR or Harry Potter fic.<br><br>Still, thanks for the warm welcome.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll certainly give you an email for female Marines, and yes, it&#39;s because the enhancement program works with male hormones, but I probably won&#39;t be doing much Mary Sue assassination-this is 40k. Bending the laws of physics to accomodate the protagonist&#39;s latest feat is not only expected, it&#39;s canon. Gary Stu is canon, because pretty much everyone is Gary Stu to a greater or lesser degre. To destroy characters for that is to assault a time-honored tradition of the Black Library and 40k fanfic.<br><br>My hunts will likely focus on egregious fluff rape (such as female Space Marines, and at least one fic I once read where Necrons joined the Tau) and badslash (yes, there&#39;s some in 40k).</p>

            <p>True. However, as a prospective recruit specializing in Warhammer 40,000, I feel obligated to offer the warning that as a rule the qualifies for the DAVD: it is an exceptionally violent setting where billions of people die as a result of rounding errors on tax returns, planet-killing weapons are a dime a dozen and used frequently, and chainsaws can be found in the form of just about any weapon. Chainsaw swords? Ubiquitous. Chainsaw axes? Check. Chainsaw glaives? Check. Chainsaw scalpels? Check. Chainsaw fists? Check, in every size from tank-busting chainfists that fit onto heavy power armour to chainfists the size of tanks mounted on Titans.<br><br>Other weapons this setting tends to produce include flamethrowers of every description, guns that fire pure pain, guns that strip away the target molecular layer by molecular layer, guns that send you straight to hell, guns that fire goblins through hell, minigun rocket launchers, guns that shoot thousands of shuriken, razor floss cannons... the list goes on.</p>

            <p>Lots of places to obtain chainaxes, but the best bet would be to take one from a Khorne Berzerker, but if an Agent wants to get one, I have to recommend extreme caution: Berzerkers are *extremely* bloodthirsty supersoldiers who happen to be axe crazy with a side order of fries, and most of them carry a semi-automatic armor-piercing rocket launcher pistol as a sidearm. The ones that don&#39;t are worse: they use that free hand for another chainaxe.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen bits and pieces of all the Trek series except the newest one, which I&#39;ve heard isn&#39;t worthwhile. I know basically who&#39;s who and what&#39;s what in the rest, though. {= )<br><br>My review isn&#39;t that long. I basically told her that I didn&#39;t like the tone of the story, explained why, and told her that a writer can&#39;t treat the readers like morons. I also told her that protagonists must be sympathetic or have some redeeming quality of humanity, or we have no reason to care about them. I used Dr. House as an example of a nasty character with redeeming qualities. The most scathing bit is this one:<br><br>&quot;Siris, on the other hand, is overpowered, disrespectful, full of herself, condescending, and totally unsympathetic. The fact that an albino horse goddess with a ridiculous curse is extremely out of place in J.K. Rowling&#39;s world doesn&#39;t do her any favors. The fact that she makes the characters who belong there and Hogwarts itself all look bad is a death sentence as far as a reader&#39;s interest is concerned. None of the canon characters has any reason to like her. Why should we?&quot;<br><br>I did give her props for halfway-decent mechanics, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yeah, a lot of people hate the newest one, which I&#39;ve personally never seen. <br><br>House was a pretty good choice; yes, he&#39;s acerbic and annoying, but you still like him. A character shouldn&#39;t turn sarcasm into sheer arrogance. <br><br>Good points, though, and what you said is made all the more obvious by the fact that she blatantly orders you to be jealous of her breast size. <br>The Pit&#39;s demographic has enough self-esteem problems as it is, plzkthx. And I&#39;m kind of, you know, <i>happy</i> with my body the way it is, and I&#39;m not winning any swimsuit contests. <br>Plus, from the many threads on Pottersues that I&#39;ve seen about such things, you are being astonishingly insensitive to the fact that breasts that big are actually painful. <br><br><br>Yeah, mechanics were pretty good. I&#39;ve seen a lot worse. (Except for the &quot;incandescent greeting...&quot; ah, the wonders of find-and-replace spell check.)</p>

            <p>Heh heh. The execution amuses me too; I was sitting at my desk, suddenly realizing, &quot;Well, <i>bugger</i>; how <i>do</i> you kill a goddess?&quot; <br>The first thing I thought of was actually the subtle knife (Жsahжttr, the god-destroyer), but there would be severe canonical consequences if it was stolen, and also neither of my Agents had knowledge of it. <br>So I kept thinking about the death of gods, which led me to Ragnarok, which made me remember the Klingons. <br><br>I&#39;ve seen entire threads on Pottersues ranting at the insensitivity of Suethors giving their creations massive busts, and how uncomfortable it really is. So I felt I was rather justified in striking back.<br><br>I&#39;m still flattered by your vast love. Unfortunately, Crelmos does not love you back (er, which is probably a good thing- never mind). <br>Teek would beg to differ on the Cardassian-ification front. She&#39;s probably deeply scarred. (I tried not to make the neck-stroking thing <i>too</i> creepy, but...)</p>

            <p>That smells like an intentional mockery of badfic, not serious badfic itself-many, if not most, of the badfics I&#39;ve seen sporked do at least try to be well-written, even if most of them still suffer from horrible grammar problems and whatnot. All of the linked fics are so over-the-top horrible that I think they can&#39;t be anything but intentional.</p>

            <p>So, I and a friend were browsing The Pit today to see whether anyone had already done an idea for a certain premise, and we found this:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4512298/1/White_Houses"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4512298/1/White_Houses">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4512298/1/White_Houses</a></a><br><br>Pride and Prejudice songfic, complete with abuse of the past participle and modern transport!<br><br>Anyone want to claim it?</p>

            <p>A quick run-through of the Jane Austen section on The Pit yields horrible, horrible Mary-Sue, inclusing two Gary-Stu brothers who were invited to Lizzie and Darcy&#39;s wedding, or something.<br><br>I&#39;ve saved a choice piece to practise MSTing on. It&#39;s Pride and Prejudice set in a modern High School. In Nevada. In it, Darcy is a wuss, every single female character (apart from Mary, because she&#39;s not TEH KEWLIES) could be replaced by generic!Sues, and Lizzie and Georgiana know each other from chapter two. Oh, and Wickham is a girl. We hates it, precious, we does...</p>
