<li>I will not take advantage of Agent Drake&#39;s naivety.<br>-- Especially not by attempting to use him as a Luxury-distracting method.<br><br>- I will not tell Tiria Wildlough that most of the fandom hates her. She&#39;s already developing quite a bad case of self-loathing.<br><br>- I will not portal into the Nelvana cartoon version of Redwall and attempt to perform gender-reassignment surgery on Pallum.<br>-- Even if everyone I know does hate said cartoon, it&#39;s still a legitimate canon.<br>--- Particularly if I do not work in Medical and therefore do not know how to perform said surgery. Not that many people in Medical know how to perform it on a hedgehog.<br><br>- I may not drop the Pevensies into the <i>Spellsinger</i> continuum while muttering &quot;Let&#39;s see how you handle it without a god on your side&quot; in an ominous manner.<br><br>- Speaking of Spellsinger, I should not introduce Mudge the otter to Luxury.<br>-- Nor should I make comments in front of him about &quot;cousin Skipper&quot;. Their continua are not in fact compatible, whatever certain badficcers may think.<br><br>- An addendum to the earlier &quot;death matches are a bad idea&quot; rules: DC Simpson and Ralph E Hayes should not be portalled into HQ and made to battle to the death.<br>-- Real World people should not be portalled into HQ without warning in general, unless they require medical treatment after an RPF fic.</li>

I tell you, that thing took one look at me and I was gone, no need ta wait around fer somethin&#39; like that! When I made it out to the other place, there was a breeze blowin&#39;, an&#39; it took me &#39;bout a split second to follow it the hell outta there! Another one o&#39; the damn things took a swipe at me as I was slidin&#39; through, around the screen-- bloodthirsty monsters, the lot of &#39;em.

And even then, they liked to match up tall tales, sometimes. Now, though-- what was that character up to?<br><br>Pike smiled and took a sip, watching the old fellow bask. He couldn&#39;t resist, though, and, carefully folding his wings, pointed out, &quot;It all comes of your foolhardy following the scent of the food, wherever it happens to lead. No one with a brain would go into one of those deathtraps if they gave it half a thought.&quot;<br><br>He was met by the expected cold sneer. &quot;Well, excuuuse me, we can&#39;t all sit around and sip the drink o&#39; the gods, now can we?

An&#39; what&#39;s a character like yerself doin&#39; in here anyway, if yer so much better than us common flies, eh?&quot;<br><br>In answer, the monarch simply raised his glass. &quot;Makes great drinks, and the conversation&#39;s entertaining.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, well you can jest as well take your overlong probo somewhere else, yeah? We don&#39;t need no stinkin&#39; flutterbugs &#39;round here.&quot;<br><br>Pike smiled again, and unfolded his wings. He was easily twice the size of the small green bug, but, sense of mischievous wit aside, would rather not get into fights, especially with houseflies-- they tended to get nasty, quickly. &quot;As you wish-- Gud, was it?&quot; He drained the last of his drink and, flexing once, rose quickly into the air on his graceful, orange wings.<br><br>Houseflies. They were an odd bunch, and no mistake. He&#39;d known some pretty smart ones, and some pretty stupid ones, but the craftiest ones even had a problem when it came to food. It was like they couldn&#39;t help themselves! Like he&#39;d pointed out, no one with half a brain would go into a house if they thought about it for two seconds, but if a fly smelled food, a fly would... well, fly. Pike laughed to himself as he landed on the top of the holly bush. Food of the gods, was it? Alright then, he&#39;d take it.<br><br>Pike was the exception for most monarchs, he knew. There was a reason why old Gud had been giving him funny looks even before he&#39;d opened his mouth. An average butterfly simply did not hang around under bushes-- especially not with houseflies. Butterflies were sunlight bugs, sunlight and flowers and breezes and dewy mornings. But Pike was not an average butterfly. He&#39;d been a strange one, even as a caterpillar, or so his friends had told him. The days of crawling were only a very hazy memory, at best, to most butterflies. Infancy, really, and then the cocoon, and then-- then rebirth.<br><br>There was a reason, he mused, why so many other flying insects looked at them so strangely, and why most butterflies kept their own company. They were not like other bugs. Butterflies had their own problems, their own risks-- quite different from the lives of other bugs, even aside from the rebirth halfway through their lives. They were practically like a magnet for predators, sometimes, and finding food was completely different from any other bug&#39;s life. No other bug had hummingbirds to contend with, he thought wryly.<br><br>&quot;Oi! Flutterbug!&quot; <br><br>Startled, Pike broke out of his reverie to see a young mosquito on the leaf opposite glaring at him. &quot;...Yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re in my spot, flutterbug.&quot;<br><br>Pike curled one antenna, the butterfly equivalent of raising an eyebrow. &quot;Your spot?&quot; Mosquitoes were quite posibly the cheekiest bugs he&#39;d ever come across. Maybe one tenth his size, shouting at him as though he was an aphid, the thing! They were crazy, the lot of them, too-- constantly dodging in and out of angry mammals&#39; reaches can do that to you. They didn&#39;t usually live long, but the ones who did were the best storytellers in the world, houseflies be damned.<br><br>&quot;My spot! I&#39;m there every morning, it&#39;s the only place on this bush where you can catch any sunlight!&quot; The little bug twitched its sharp mouth angrily. Pike was amused. <br><br>&quot;Alright, alright, don&#39;t get your wings twisted. I&#39;m going.&quot; Grinning to himself, he rose up into the air again, and, after a short pause to get his bearings, headed for the nearest vine of flowers. It was past lunch anyway, and there was nothing quite like morning glories at this time of day-- right before they folded. Some butterflies he knew liked the stuff fresh, but he tended to go for the older nectar-- it collected miniscule particles of dust, giving it an odd... &quot;tested&quot; sort of flavor. <br><br>Food of the gods, indeed. He unrolled his long proboscis-- it was one of the longest around, and he was rather vain, in that aspect. As he flitted from flower to flower, slowly working up to a full stomach, clouds gathered on the horizon, and the air began to get heavy. Pike grimaced as he realized that the growing storm could well be a bit dangerous, if things got heavy. It looked like cutting his lunch short was the only option.<br><br>Worth it, though, he acknowledged, settling in behind the trellis of the vines. Shifting his wings into a more comfortable position, Pike slowly fell asleep as the rain pounded outside, safe and... well, relatively warm.<br><br><br><br><i>So... thoughts? I will probably expand on it and add it to the growing book of short stories to lie gathering dust on my computer forever. Heh.</i></p>

            <p>Thanks for the help, but I&#39;ve since decided that it was fantasy. Supernatural is probably only ghosts etc, isn’t it?<br><br>Sorry that I couldn’t give a better explanation before, but my time at the library was almost up and I was about to get booted off the computer because of it. Anyway, here&#39;s the plot outline. It&#39;s still only a draft and could potentially change at any time. It&#39;s met with mixed comments from the few I&#39;ve shown it to so far. I&#39;ve also just recently changed a few things, so if something doesn&#39;t make any sense, call me out on it.<br><br>The year on Earth is 22?? (unsure of exact year. Probably the latter part of the century). Kyle Redfield, Europe’s stealthiest burglar, has been a thorn in the side of the police for over fifteen years. When a strange woman arrives at his door, bloodied and beaten, he feels a strange urge to take her in rather than send her to a hospital. As he nurses her back to health, he hacks into police files and finds no mention of the woman ever existing.<br><br>Demanding answers, Mala tells him that the worlds of magic and science used to be one, but split apart centuries before because of an unknown cataclysm/someone who wanted to separate them (haven’t decided). So far, so cliché. But don’t worry. I try to put an original spin on all clichés.<br><br>During the time they were separated, the magical world, Orlornu, faced a deadly danger and so the Circle was created, a ruling council with absolute power composed of a male and a female of every race: elf, nymph, troll, pixie, ogre, vampire and more. The Circle managed to save Orlornu from destruction, but the power they wielded began to corrupt them. Within a century, they had almost total control of Orlornu, but they wanted more.<br><br>Some of the rebels who refused the Circle’s rule attempted to fight back, but most fled through discovered rifts in reality and arrived on Earth in the early 20th century. Since then, the rebels have slowly tried to convince humans of the coming fight while the Circle’s minions hunted each of them down. While the rebel’s numbers were slowly whittled down to less than a hundred, the Circle’s power somehow continued to grow. Now, as their invasion force numbers into the millions, they have almost enough power to start to directly affect Earth and cause chaos throughout the planet: alter human minds on an immense scale to tie them up in massive, senseless wars; alter Earth’s geography to cause volcanic eruptions under major cities or even, if they so chose, burn away the atmosphere entirely.<br><br>Kyle refuses to believe her at first, thinking her to be a crazy woman who somehow escaped the government’s records. But when Mala is attacked by the ogre who caused her so much damage before, he starts to realise the truth of what she said. But will he be able to fight against the magic slowly polluting the world?<br><br>The answer is obviously yes as he’s the main character. I just nicked part of this off of a blurb I once wrote for it. It was riddled with clichés like that. Try this one: “If he wants to survive, he must fight for everything he believes in before it is destroyed by everything he doesn’t believe in.” Clichéd or what? Sounds like a B-movie.<br><br>But anyway, the magic is sort of undefined. If you want to do something, you can do it, as long as you have the power and the will to do it. It seems like a deux ex machine, but the Circle are the ones with the real power, not the good guys. All of the races have magic with the possible exception of vampires and the like. They might have something else. Cloaking and disguising spells are the easiest, which is how everyone moves around Earth without detection. Fire magic is the most commonly used as it’s one of the easiest things to summon and control.<br><br>This leads to the only way to detect a cloaked/disguised person: infrared (also the title of the series). Under an infrared detector, the person shows up as pure white because of the energy of the fire magic inside them. They can contain it inside them so that they don’t burn anyone they touch (though their skin always feels hot), but they can’t control it enough to appear as anything other than white on infrared. On a related note, exactly what temperature is white on an infrared scanner? Because I may need to change this slightly if it’s stupidly hot.<br><br>Yes, I know this sounds so dreadful that I should probably just give up now, but a) it sounds far, far better in my head and b) I just want to give it a try anyway. But any other helpful hints?</p>

            <p>&quot;If there are other magical elements, it&#39;s more fantasy.&quot;<br><br>There are other magical creatures and random magic, so yes.

            <p>&quot;creative writing,&quot; &quot;fantasy,&quot; or other similar things for Interests, you will find numerous comms where people post their work for others to read.

            <p>If they were, in fact, supernatural, or other elements in the story pushed it into the supernatural, that might be different. As in, if you actually were using the Norse roots.

            <p>I&#39;ve never truly read LotR. I once got to Frodo&#39;s section of The Two Towers and then gave up. That was three years ago. I&#39;m trying again and they&#39;ve just left Caradhras. Feanor was the guy after the Silmarils that Morgoth/Melkor/89 other names stole, wasn&#39;t he?<br><br>And is it just me, or is LotR a songfic in disguise? I&#39;m not talking about the songs themselves, but how they speak. &quot;Better the orc you fear than the wolf you hear,&quot; for instance. It&#39;s like &#39;Once More, With Feeling&#39;, only without a tapdancing demon in it.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s cool if LotR isn&#39;t your bag, but comparing the classic foundation of an entire genre of literature to common songfic is not going to sit well with many people here. Just so you know.<br><br>The following isn&#39;t personal, it&#39;s just me tangentially explaining what I think.<br><br>Language and thought are connected. There was a time when speech took as long as it needed to say what was meant, before TV and the Internet came and thoughts were reduced to sound bytes and then became as stunted as the contents of the average text message. Maybe there&#39;s no room for lyricism in modern language, but I, for one, think that&#39;s an unfortunate loss. How do you learn to think in beautiful language if you never experience it? What can we say about the contents of our thoughts if we can&#39;t express them with some finesse?<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that all language should be flowery and poetic, because that gets annoying, but there&#39;s a big difference between a songficcer inserting lines of pop songs into their writing because they thought it would be cool, and Tolkien inventing a little rhyme because, for that moment in the story, it said exactly what he meant it to say. That&#39;s part of what makes a great writer, after all: The ability to impart great meaning with a few carefully chosen words.<br><br>I&#39;m going to get off the soapbox, but I close with a quote from Charles de Lint&#39;s &quot;The Conjure Man,&quot; which sums up what good writing is all about:<br><br>&quot;The stories are just stories--they entertain, they make one laugh or cry--but if they have any worth, they carry within them a deeper resonance that remains long after the final page is turned, or the storyteller has come to the end of his or her tale. Both aspects of the story are necessary for it to have any worth.&quot;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I hope you are familiar with the concept of a wiki, because if you aren&#39;t, this explanation will make less sense to you.<br><br>There exists a wiki called &quot;<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage/">TV Tropes</a>&quot;, which is devoted to collecting and, to a degree, analyzing &quot;tropes&quot; (basically, commonly-used concepts and methods of execution, such as shoulder angels/devils and genre savvy); despite its name, it accepts examples from anything, up to and including real life and fanfic. Since <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability">there is no such thing as notability</a> on TV Tropes, examples don&#39;t even have to be from something widely known.<br><br>One of the tropes is the&quot;<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowningMomentOfAwesome">Crowning Moment of Awesome</a>&quot;, in which a character does something considerably more awesome than the norm; Vimes&#39; rampage at the end of the Discworld book <i>Thud</i> is listed, if I remember correctly.<br><br>Does that help?

            <p>TV Tropes is the sort of site that you visit with the intention of reading one or two pages and before you know it several hours have passed and you&#39;ve got twenty+ tabs open. Plus it&#39;s rife with spoilers, but Tropers tend to be good at hiding them behind spoiler tags on the whole, so you don&#39;t have to see them if you don&#39;t want to.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s really up to you. Lunac is more straightlaced, so if he got shot with sugar, he&#39;d really let loose for once. But if it were Arti, considering he&#39;s many-times over insane, having just turned much of the PPC temporarily into females, then you&#39;re asking for insanity in epic proportions. Anyways, either is free for you to use.</p>

            <p>However, unless Tawaki declares otherwise, we will assume that it never revealed its &quot;gender&quot;. Thereby sidestepping the problem of male/female vocal actors. The Flowers have not really been assigned on basis of genders, as we have so few male vocalists. For example, Captain Dandy, whom we know is male, is being voiced by Oozaru Angel.<br><br>Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>How do you guys record your stuff? Is there a specific recording thingy that&#39;ll put it into an mp3 file? Where can you get it? <br>And since I&#39;m also considering doing art, what kind of file does it have to be in? And ditto goes for animating. <br>Speaking of animation, is it in 3D?

            <p>Oh, yeah.  It&#39;s the Kenneth Branagh one--I thought it was really cool. Branagh, Kate Beckinsale, Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington as Don Pedro, Keanu Reeves as a surprisingly well done Don John.  Michael Keaton is Dogberry.  It&#39;s amusing, veeeery pretty, in line with the script, and has great music.  I can&#39;t say much about the costuming, as it&#39;s been a while since I watched it and I don&#39;t really remember.</p>

            <p>I recently deleted some entries from the Unclaimed Badfic section of the Wiki because it wasn&#39;t brought up here.  They&#39;re actually my particular stories, which can be found at: <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4300069/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4300069/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4300069/1/</a></a><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390189/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390189/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390189/1/</a></a><br><br>I&#39;d like to think that I carefully constructed the stories.  I wrote all ~25,000 and ~30,000 respective words before publishing anything and did several proofreading passes by both myself and other people.  I also paid careful attention to detail to avoid a lot of pitfalls and pretty specifically synthesized one key character as a parody of Mary Sue (as in... an anvil to the head blatant parody) while betraying the whole underlying mechanic that makes the character type offensive.  I certainly didn&#39;t just type it all out after earing a scoop of sugar and post it as is.<br><br>However, I&#39;m a good sport and I won&#39;t deny that the stories are, by and large, dull and uninteresting (if carefully written).  Being brought up at the PPC Wiki gave me an idea for a particular story, though.  What if instead of just another perfunctory assassination, the PPC as a whole has to deal with a particularly intelligent, self-aware, genre savvy, and very dangerous individual bent on destroying them?  It would obviously end with the PPC&#39;s victory (status quo is god, after all), but for the story, I&#39;ll need some C-list fodder.  Agents to be killed/injured/stranded in the middle of nowhere/brainwashed/turned into sharks/etc.  It would be a several story deal and overlap with other fanfiction assignments.  Anyone have any interest in this?</p>

            <p>The PPC might have enough opponents.<br><br>The idea has come up before, too, though it doesn&#39;t appear to have been continued past the second chapter- Ashes to Glory, archived about half-way down <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/archives.html">here</a>.  I don&#39;t know… maybe it&#39;s not a project for one person.  Might have potential as an RP, but I&#39;m not much of a fan of the fodder idea.  I understand you mean characters who aren&#39;t much liked any more by their creators, but… it seems off, to me.  *shrugs*  I&#39;m not sure about this.</p>

            <p><span style="color:#ff8c00">Before I say anything, I&#39;m just going to point this out. This is my opinion. No one else&#39;s, this isn&#39;t Official, hell, let&#39;s say this really isn&#39;t even PPC related, yeah?<br></span><b><br>Let&#39;s just pretend this is me and you.</b><br><br>I&#39;d like to know what made you think that you could delete some entries off of the wiki&#39;s badfic list since they weren&#39;t &quot;brought up here&quot;. See, there&#39;s thing about a wiki. Anyone can add anything. And anyone can delete it, too. But the thing is, no one needs damn permission or needs to give notification to add something to it. So I don&#39;t see why you saw the need to give that reason. By and large, your reason for taking those off? Excuse. Bad excuse. To me, all that first sentence of yours says is &quot;BAWWWW. SOMEONE HURT MY FEELINGS.&quot;. I&#39;d have to say that it&#39;s probably bad manners for the author of whatever was posted up there to remove it his or herself, that should be something a third party does. <br><br>People can take a fic off that list if they think it doesn&#39;t belong there if they have a look. Some of those fics? They probably don&#39;t deserve to be up there. After all, a lot of those were probably added after a look at the summary and a cursory look at the the first chapter or so. Maybe even less.<br><br>If someone added it there because they have a grudge with you, well, that&#39;s between them and you. Leave the PPC out of it. Getting other parties involved in a two way arguement just leads to more problems. So stop that garbage NOW.<br><br>And okay, so you think your fic is okay. You think it&#39;s written well technically, but you&#39;re thinking it&#39;s boring. You wrote it, you completed it. FANTASTIC. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not really your opinion that matters if you put it online for others to read, is it? It&#39;s the readers that decide if a story is good or not, if they think the writing is good or not, and so forth. All the proofreading in the world is not going to change that. And putting down the word you think it&#39;s boring too? That&#39;s not how it works. You do your best to make a good story, and good stories are not &#39;dull and uninteresting&#39;. And as the Trojanhorse said, parody Mary Sues are difficult. It&#39;s hard to carry a parody off properly no matter what. Parody and satire are dangerous beasts, and people can and will read them improperly and your &#39;parody&#39; Sue is going to be just a Sue. They&#39;re going to take it at FACE VALUE. <br><br>And hip hip hurrah, you want to write a PPC emergency where the PPC has to deal with destruction coming from within or without by a person or persons that know how stories work and are intelligent. Shall I point you to Huinesoron&#39;s Reorganisation? Or the as of yet uncompleted Crashing Down? How about Tawaki&#39;s subplot that involves Big Brother? And on the subject of normal characters being turned into Mary Sues, there&#39;s Suedom. And this is the stuff that&#39;s on the top of my head, there&#39;s probably quite a bit more out there. <br><br>Also, C-List? There are no &#39;C-List&#39; Agents. There are Agents still used by their creators. There are Agents that have officialy retired. There are Agents that are in that limbo of being unwritten since their creators left and might return, or not. Thinking of any character as being C-List isn&#39;t right, because you know something? This is a shared verse. What I might think of a C-List Agent is right at the top of someone else&#39;s A-List. <br><br>And what would happen if someone came back, wanting to write a mission with their old Agents, and got told, &#39;Oh, sorry, you weren&#39;t around anymore, so we figured it&#39;d be okay to use your old Agent as a dramatic sacrifice basically since we didn&#39;t think you&#39;d ever come back&#39;.<br><br>Killing off someone&#39;s character is not cool unless you have permission from them and you&#39;re totally sure they&#39;d be okay with it. Plenty of us have made characters purely for being &#39;Red Shirts&#39;. <br><br>And you don&#39;t think any of us have thought about the &#39;oh, wait, won&#39;t my character be a Mary Sue&#39; issue? I promise you, quite a few of us have. And the thing is, most of us succeeed at preventing our characters from being Mary Sues. <br><br>Want to know how?<br><br><br>Because the PPC is, first and foremost, just a humor thing. It&#39;s a shared universe, and it has its serious moments, but for the most part, the PPC is comedy. While the characters might not get into serious trouble or mess totally up, it&#39;s because there&#39;s only so far you can go before it is no longer Funny. Everyone asks themselves, how much humor can we get out of this happening to this character? How bad can my character screw up without getting hurt or waist deep in serious trouble? <br><br>And as to Mary Sues in the PPC? Some of them are ex-Mary Sues. And others, well, you saw the DIO page, didn&#39;t you?<br></p>

            <p>I took it off because it was just a pathetic attempt at trolling by somebody that didn&#39;t bother to read them (hell, the person doesn&#39;t even participate in anything related to fanfiction at all and had to ask around to find places like this) and just wanted to get a rise out of me.  I know all this because the person directly told me what they did, not out of guesswork.  I mean, honestly... if every petty grudge that somebody holds involves doing everything they can to discredit them (including posting stuff they&#39;ve written on this website)... this website would just be little more than a mirror for every single fanfiction website in existence.  This website has better standards than that and I don&#39;t want to subject it to this irrelevant crap.<br><br>Also, if I were some asshole, I&#39;d have just deleted the entries without saying a word (I wouldn&#39;t have bothered to post here, since I&#39;m smarter than to call attention to what is most likely just a minor, unnoticed blip in the edit history).  However, rather than acting like some thin-skinned egotist, I instead decided to take it in good humor and offer suggestions and material to maximize extracting the parody out of the stories.  I&#39;m being constructive in my whole intrusion, not destructive.  I like the concept of the PPC and even though the circumstances behind this proposed idea is a bit... I don&#39;t know, crappy, I don&#39;t want to unjustly rob potential material because some troll involved this website.<br><br>Anyway, I wasn&#39;t asking for people&#39;s characters without their permission.  I would not only want the full permission of the owners, but also for them to write their own actions and dialogue (even if they&#39;re ultimately railroaded into a certain conclusion... but they would know what that is going into it, regardless).  I don&#39;t like the whole concept of making red shirts because honestly... they hold no impact (dramatic, comedic, or otherwise) and are just too easy to spot.  &quot;Agent Williams, fresh from training, gets sent to investigate a disappearance within a recently scorched continuity.&quot;  Yeah, good luck getting any emotional involvement out of that.  Audience tunes out and just waits for the inevitable to happen so they can absorb whatever forced plot detail comes out of it, all the while wishing for somebody more interesting to come to the forefront.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ll admit that I haven&#39;t fully read the works in question.  I did, however, read the timeline, all the Emergencies, and most of the links within them.  I saw a bit of a gap I offered to fill.  Maybe it&#39;s just an issue with the way the website is written, but honestly... there doesn&#39;t seem to be any real chessmaster style character with a penchant for manipulating everybody and leaving a trail of irony behind.  There are corrupt bureaucrats, enemy commanders, card carrying villains, and such, but nothing that really seemed like a subversive threat that worked based on manipulating all circumstances around them while setting up a whole lot of messages and imagery meant to dismay, discredit, and otherwise just destroy the morale of the organization (all the while leaving behind run-on sentences).  Still, it&#39;s up to everybody if they would like to see this and I certainly don&#39;t want to go forward without at least about four other people contributing to it.<br><br>I apologize if anything I&#39;ve posted seemed prudish (I certainly don&#39;t want to give off that sort of vibe).  I&#39;m certainly not saying I&#39;m immune to this website and if somebody wants to use my stories for material, I&#39;m all for it.  Hell, here&#39;s a link to my profile:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1579216/EtherealMutation"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1579216/EtherealMutation">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1579216/EtherealMutation</a></a><br><br>Feel free to add whatever you want from it to the unclaimed badfic (provided that it&#39;s actually, well, usable... as mentioned, parodying parody generally negates the whole purpose and I certainly didn&#39;t just mash anything out in short order).  I suggest the aptly named &quot;Destroyers of Continuity&quot; as a prime resource (although it, also, is a parody, it has such incredible corniness that could be extracted).  Hell, feel free to add me as a target or whatever.  I&#39;d prefer that I be consulted with so that a certain amount of &quot;realism&quot; can be acheived, but so long as it isn&#39;t libelous (and my standards for &quot;libel&quot; are really, really, really high, so I doubt a comedic website would ever get anywhere close), I&#39;m all for anything.  In the end, it&#39;s all publicity anyway (I guess I shouldn&#39;t have said that... damnit, there goes my diabolical plan to draw in readers).</p>

            <p>Yes, I read it... I made plenty of references to the post and don&#39;t know how much more clear I could have been.  I don&#39;t know.  I guess since even just responding to this two and a half sentence post in any measure is sort of making me look like a jackass, I may as well address parts of the earlier post that particularly bugged me:<br><br>&quot;Excuse. Bad excuse. To me, all that first sentence of yours says is &quot;BAWWWW. SOMEONE HURT MY FEELINGS.&quot;&quot;<br><br>Except, as I mentioned, that isn&#39;t the reason I took it off in the first place (and the reason I took it off is neither an excuse by any measure nor about me, personally).  If it was, why would I then willfully describe my work as crap (which, by the way, is still subjective just as how somebody calling themselves the greatest writer ever is obviously subjective, but I honestly do think that my concepts for the two stories just turned out to be crap in execution and ultimately not very funny), then go to great length offering to rip apart all of my own work (and, indeed, my own damn -persona-) if all this was about my &quot;feelings being hurt&quot;?  Shouldn&#39;t I just edit it out and hope nobody notices if that&#39;s the case?  Or, failing that intelligence check, write some scathing post decrying the website for its &quot;unfair&quot; treatment of me by proxy?  Well, one interpretation (which I jokingly alluded to) is that I&#39;m doing this for publicity (honestly... I&#39;d rather be obscure than hated), but the real reason is because I am not Anne Rice, Tim Buckley, or David Gonterman and I have an actual sense of humor about myself and my creations.  I don&#39;t treat anything I write as serious.<br><br>&quot;If someone added it there because they have a grudge with you, well, that&#39;s between them and you. Leave the PPC out of it. Getting other parties involved in a two way arguement just leads to more problems. So stop that garbage NOW.&quot;<br><br>There is no addition to the argument.  As I mentioned, I brought this up simply because I wanted to contribute.  The other asshole of this &quot;feud&quot; (I can&#39;t adequately explain how retarded this person&#39;s motives were if I tried) just used the PPC website as little more than a tool to make a &quot;point&quot;.  Is that really a justifiable use of the website?  I certainly hope not, lest it undermine the whole concept.<br><br>&quot;Unfortunately, it&#39;s not really your opinion that matters if you put it online for others to read, is it?&quot;<br><br>Of course it&#39;s not my opinion that ultimately matters.  Two things, though.  First, the person that person added the stories did it for all the wrong reasons (as mentioned in earlier posts and this one) and I&#39;d rather not let other people get involved in this petty crap (you know, the thing that I&#39;m being accused of here).  Second:<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s hard to carry a parody off properly no matter what. Parody and satire are dangerous beasts, and people can and will read them improperly and your &#39;parody&#39; Sue is going to be just a Sue. They&#39;re going to take it at FACE VALUE.&quot;<br><br>I won&#39;t deny that parody is hard to pull off properly.  While obviously, any character whatsoever can be interpreted as a Mary Sue (the term is pretty much just a dead horse that translates into &quot;character I don&#39;t like&quot; at this point, but I like to pretend it still means something specific).  However, as I mentioned, using pretty much any real objective standard of Mary Sue (you know... a character that the author is obviously playing favorites with and bends the universe around) would not have the character come back as such.  The PPC website, itself, would vindicate the character.  I can argue that point forever.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a good character (oh, no, not at all.  I hate the C unmentionable).  It&#39;s just not a Mary Sue by any real definition.<br><br>&quot;Also, C-List? There are no &#39;C-List&#39; Agents. There are Agents still used by their creators. There are Agents that have officialy retired. There are Agents that are in that limbo of being unwritten since their creators left and might return, or not. Thinking of any character as being C-List isn&#39;t right, because you know something? This is a shared verse. What I might think of a C-List Agent is right at the top of someone else&#39;s A-List.&quot;<br><br>I guess using the term &quot;C-list&quot; might seem offensive, but did I specifically call any character in particular C-list?  No.  Did I imply that there might exist C-list characters that people might be willing to part with?  Yes, and that is because I seriously doubt any major project like this has managed to avoid having a casual writer grow distant from it.  I already mentioned wanting full permission and full cooperation, not having asked for abandoned characters without the permission of their authors, etc. etc. in the other post.<br><br>Anyway, since I haven&#39;t yet read all the stories, I guess I&#39;ll just put the idea I had for a story on the backburner (unless enough people decide they do want to actually go through with it).  I guess I&#39;m thinking more in terms of a particular style of execution, actually, and am not properly communicating it. Also, the more I think about it, the less casualties I think I&#39;d actually write due to the fact that death itself is just friggin&#39; boring.  Odds are, there would probably be all of two irreversible events (and one of them would be an accident).  Regardless, I guess I shouldn&#39;t offer suggestions until I&#39;m familiar with everything first.<br><br>I don&#39;t even see the negative of any of this.  Technically competent, self-aware (if self-deprecating at times, easily prone to mediocre ideas, and sometimes retarded) writer that could have just killed off the entries without much of a fuss instead decides to offer entirely free content for the entire PPC &#39;verse?  Without any conditions whatsoever?  Hell, I&#39;d even offer my really, really, REALLY crappy unpublished City of Heroes &quot;fanfiction&quot; for the chopping block if people wanted it.  I&#39;d rather not because I think that having not published it gives me the right to disavow it (it&#39;s not like I&#39;m taking it away from anybody), but I offer it, nonetheless.<br><br>Anyway, if there&#39;s something you want specifically answered, feel free to mention it.  Also, while I do my best to avoid letting any personally negative tones seep into my stuff, I might accidentally word something in a way that could be misinterpreted as such and for that, I apologize.  Let me assure you that I have nothing against you (and why should I?).  You might have completely missed a lot of the point and are using bad debate form, but you&#39;re otherwise rational and intelligent (even if it sort of feels like my posts were just casually skimmed over).  If you weren&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t have posted a big response and a second, largely redundant one with more clarification just because of a two and a half sentence wonder accusing me of missing the point.  And please don&#39;t assume that I&#39;m being negative in pointing this out personally.  I&#39;m just letting you know where I come from.  Again, if you have any lingering questions, concerns, etc., I&#39;m more than happy to address them and I hope I do not come across as some asshole for any of this.  I would like to contribute in some measure to the website (provided I&#39;m still welcome, anyway).</p>

            <p>We don&#39;t really have &#39;C-list&#39; or &#39;cannon fodder&#39; Agents in the PPC ... kinda goes against the whole idea, y&#39;know, since we Don&#39;t Leave A Man Behind, and the latest thing with the Mary Sue Factories ... mass produced is for the enemy, dude. And since people only create a few Agents, usually, and get attached to them, I sincerely doubt anyone will volunteer their characters. I certainly won&#39;t be.<br><br>I can&#39;t vouch for the quality of your stories as they aren&#39;t my fandom, but if they were on the page then someone at least thought them worthy of sporkage. It&#39;s my experience that parodying badfic only ends with worse badfic; perhaps try and steer clear of it? I don&#39;t doubt that you tried very hard, but a Mary Sue, even one developed carefully, is a Mary Sue, and you can probably understand why it&#39;s hard to differentiate between one done as an &#39;anvil to the head blatant parody&#39; and one written by someone with too much sugar in their bellies.<br><br>Just saying, is all.<br><br>- Trojie</p>

            <p>Parody can be of any quality (the term Mary Sue, itself, comes from a parody) and personally, I&#39;d like to think that I made a (failed) parody of the generic Mary Sue type as opposed to something that really is a genuine character of the mold.  She only -appears- to be a Mary Sue through virtue of being a (physically) attractive character with extensive sorcery powers that latches onto the main cast, but the universe and its characters already hate her, she&#39;s portrayed as being incredibly abrasive and irritating (to the point where she&#39;s actually the unaware villain), and she -loses- at every single major thing she attempts.  I mean... come on.  What can really be done here?  &quot;We&#39;re here to give you a mercy killing.  Your crimes include attempted canon rape that failed due to the story already starting out that way, being a villain, and for just simply existing.&quot;  It wouldn&#39;t make for a good PPC story in the standard mold.  But what if one instead comes to the conclusion that a &quot;wrongfully accused&quot; character, carefully constructed by a self-aware author out of mix-and-match pieces (with a little something extra made of pure evil... or something equally cliche) would instead produce a self-aware, genre savvy character that gives the organization a run for its money due to all the standard operating procedure being largely useless on it?  That has a lot more potential.<br><br>Anyway, when I say &quot;C-list fodder&quot;, I&#39;m really referring to characters that aren&#39;t cared about (any more).  I guess the term is a bit obtuse (it actually refers to how in comics, &quot;C-list&quot; characters that publishers create and then largely abandon have a tendency to be brought back for dramatic deaths without seriously impacting the canon as a whole).  I wouldn&#39;t say nobody would volunteer their characters for something like this (somebody had to volunteer the 19 characters in the Deceased Agents section).  People often change over time and grow distant from their old characters (or, perhaps, the website itself).  They might just want to give their character a fairly dramatic exit (or they just decide that they hate the character after all).  Also, the deaths (and other twisted things) wouldn&#39;t violate the PPC standard operating procedure (if anything, the deaths would inspire the full wrath and fury of the organization, something that would be the whole driving point of the story).  Certainly, the agents aren&#39;t all invincible, unerring, and completely in the right at all times.  That would just by hypocritical of the whole premise (&quot;We send Mary Sue to kill Mary Sue!&quot;), although that would actually make pretty good material (&quot;You strive to kill every Mary Sue there is, but fail to look within your own numbers?&quot;).  I ask for characters because I&#39;d really like to be part of the community and for the story to actually feel like a part of it instead of just creating six or so Red Shirts.<br><br>Also, I really view the character as being somebody who would get more pleasure out of ironic punishments than just maniacally killing everybody, so it&#39;s not even like everybody that volunteers for the project would end up dead, either.  For example, perhaps a character that is really, really, REALLY outspoken about their hatred of Mary Sues would end up getting brain-jacked, given a whole makeover, and forced to retain their consciousness as their bodies make them act like classical Mary Sues as the PPC unwittingly sends one of their own to kill them off (which could lead to whoever gets sent either rescuing them after they sense something wrong or finding out later that they killed one of their own agents and having to live with the consequences).<br><br>Regardless, as mentioned, I&#39;d like this to be a joint effort if possible.  After browsing the PPC Emergencies, there seems to be a gap this type of story could fill (not to mention that it would fit perfectly into the Catastrophe Theory).  They&#39;ve dealt with straightforward base invasions, fighting off the Borg, and major world infections... but somebody destroying them from the inside out?  It would require quite a bit more in terms of planning, resources, and all-around adaptability that would test the organization and offer quite a bit of &quot;character development&quot;, if you will.<br><br>By the way, I know specifically who added the stories in the first place and it certainly wasn&#39;t for anything involving the content (let&#39;s just say that the Final Fantasy XI endgame community as a whole is not very friendly and leave it at that).  If somebody else (as in... somebody not doing it out of petty spite) deems them actually worthy of being on the list, I won&#39;t oppose it (although I&#39;ll most likely claim them myself just because I like the idea I&#39;ve come up with).</p>

            <p>which I stand by, because I&#39;ve read so many poor fics (NOT including yours, cos I haven&#39;t read yours) that then claimed to be parodic that I have become suspicious of the whole idea.

            <p>I think I have a character I can offer.<br><br>My Agents&#39; second mission led them to rescue two uncanonical daughters of Aragorn and Arwen called Galae and Rana, who were crowbarred in to make the &#39;Sue look good and were barely mentioned again. On being brought back to HQ, the girls were renamed Galeya and Rina. Galeya is five and Rina is twelve.<br><br>They were placed in the HQ daycare centre to be rehabilitated into HQ life. Rina is nearly old enough to be an Agent in training, and probably will have already begun lessons on being an Agent. She&#39;s quite a gentle girl, though, so she&#39;d probably be training for Infrastructure rather than Action Departments- possibly Finance or Personnel. Galeya is very close to her older sister, but also idolises the other Agents and will probably end up in an Action Department.<br><br>I offer that Rina be the Agent who is killed. It would probably upset a lot of people, as she isn&#39;t even old enough to be able to fight back and would evidently have been picked as an easy target. Not only that, but she&#39;ll have made a lot of friends in the daycare who will all be wanting her avenged... Marsha, for one, and you don&#39;t upset a hormonal teenaged Triceratops unless you really want to see a rampage. Rina&#39;s not a full-blown Agent or even much of a character at all, so her death wouldn&#39;t damage canon, but it&#39;d hopefully rile people. At least three or four I can think of.<br><br>However...there are very few characters that aren&#39;t cared about, and many of those on the Deceased List were. Makes-Things, for example, was a beloved part of the PPC and the first ever non-Flower Agent. And as for someone destroying them from the inside out... have you read the Reorganisation? The Mysterious Somebody and the DIS were trying to bring down the PPC. Not physically, but certainly morally. I&#39;m curious to see how this would work, but perhaps holding off till a few more of the older Boarders have had their say.</p>

            <p>...it&#39;s very strange to be posting a message that isn&#39;t in characte- OH HAI.<br><br>As might be surmised by my ridiculous subject, I&#39;m a new person who is hoping to join and assist the PPC.  I was drawn in after reading Chatvert&#39;s work, which happened a while after she said I should join.  At least, I think she said that.<br><br>Well, about me.  Or, more importantly, my views on fanfiction.  I&#39;m a real stick in the mud when it comes to canon.  Simply put, if it&#39;s not canon or in character, I generally dislike it.  Exceptions of course are when something is really well written, with evidence and a strong basis for any non-canon material or OoCness that might exist.<br><br>Which is why I can rant on all day about why AxB is wrong because A would not have anything romantic to do with B in canon, yada yada yada doesn&#39;t work blah blah no support for it yackity yack let&#39;s get cookies.<br><br>I have a really odd view upon slash.  In my head slash implies a non-canonical pairing, and as stated above, I heavily dislike that.  But I can tolerate it, so long as it&#39;s not in one of my favorite canons.  I don&#39;t LIKE it, but it won&#39;t scar me.<br><br>Mary-Sues.  Not going to say much besides that they annoy me to no end and that I&#39;m really paranoid about any of my OC&#39;s being Sues, to the point where I actually slammed them through the Litmus Test just to make sure.<br><br>...I look this over and think great, it&#39;s tl;dr and I&#39;m not even DONE.<br><br>Fast-Forward through all the rest to... My Fandoms!<br><br>I&#39;ve... got quite a few fandoms.  And there&#39;s a priority thing for them in my brain, that really dictates just how much OoC I can handle without raging.  I&#39;ve actually developed a much higher tolerance level than I used to, up to the point that the only fandom that I will fiercely defend with the smallest provocation is Kingdom Hearts.  Yes, THAT Kingdom Hearts.  It&#39;s half Disney, for crying out loud!  Other fandoms I like are Get Backers, Death Note, Invader Zim, Okami (Giant funball of doooooom), D. Gray-man, Fullmetal Alchemist, Pirates of the Caribbean, and pretty much every Disney movie that came out in the 90&#39;s.<br><br>I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;ll be reading fics around those fandoms, and I&#39;m aware that Kingdom Hearts is a victim particularly of Sues and really bad OoCness (Organization XIII smut?  ...it just doesn&#39;t work.  There is NOTHING in canon that could allow it to work.  No emotions = no love, no pleasure, why would they waste their time?).  I also seek to find the really bad ones, and I want to kill them.  I want to kill them with FIRE.  I want to cleanse the world of badfic!  I shall FIND the worst, and I shall DESTROY it for the sake of SOCIETY!! I shall-- *dragged away*<br><br>*coughs* So yeah.  That&#39;s me in a nutshell.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s good, albeit fairly unrealistic.  Starts off slowly, and the script may seem pretty bad, but it appears that the translator got changed sometime in the first two novels, since it greatly improves by volume three.  There&#39;s cursing, violence, and it&#39;s got some nakedness in it, though not an absurd amount and it&#39;s mostly action and comedy.<br><br>The cast is pretty large, two main characters and a host of recurring supporting characters (one of whom is more popular than one of the two mains, as it were).  First volume is not a really good example of the series, since it&#39;s more introductory.  It really picks up in volume two and the first really big arc starts in volume five.<br><br>The cast is the real high point; one would be hard pressed to find a more diverse group.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m hoping to start my PhD before the end of the year. I will be studying molluscs rather than dinosaurs, but dinosaurs are a lifelong obsession of mine.<br><br>Favourites? I have to pick one? While I do like dromaeosaurids like the raptors, I have to say that Stegosaurus is my favourite. But Triceratops should probably be in there too given I have one as a daughter in the PPC :P<br><br>*btw; you know about Utahraptor and how it isn&#39;t Velociraptor?

            <p>I DO know the difference.  Utahraptor is something around four times as large as Velociraptor, and the skulls are built differently (Velociraptor has a much narrower snout.)<br><br>Triceratops used to be my favorite, but I find I really like the dromaeosaurids simply because they were probably about as smart as modern wolves.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m posting to warn everyone about an incoming flux of badfic that is bound to come. I just saw the new Star Wars: The Clone Wars...and...well, it kind of sucks but it has its moments. However, there are some...rather badly written lines on the part of the writers. The kind of lines combined with dangerously romantic music and sunsetty silhouettes that aren&#39;t too hard to read into.<br><br>There are a number of other moents and lines etc etc that are potentially dangerous to the canon. The movie itself is a little shifty in terms of the original non-animated ones. <br><br>So. Just as a warning. Keep your eyes out, try to hold on to your sanity.</p>

            <p>Lucas neither directed nor produced this movie, which probably explains why it fails so much. He basically just gave it the go ahead and probably gave some input on it. At least it didn&#39;t turn out nearly as bad as the Star Wars Christmas Special complete with a cracked-out Carrie Fisher.</p>

            <p>For those of you who missed it, there was a bot spamming the board with the same post at a rate of several posts per minute for several hours last night. I posted the above post at about 2 in the morning, when it looked like the bot had stopped for a while. I&#39;ve been exchanging E-mails with both the server.com folks and the hosts of the server doing the spamming, we&#39;ll see what happens with that. The posts around here will be more than a bit weird as all the (hundreds of) spam posts were deleted, leaving our inserted comments without context.</p>

            <p>Feels almost like home, doesn&#39;t it? Only with less spam all over the floor. And slightly wonky margins. Does anyone here know anything about style sheets?<br><br>Anyway. Currently this is just intended to be used for the duration and then retired gracefully, but the alternative is considering this a permanent switch. The Board looks the same and works the same: the sole difference is the address (we&#39;d need a new page to store the Constitution on) and the fact that anyone with the password would be able to block IP adresses. That&#39;s halfway between being a good and a bad thing -- it&#39;d be good when trolls come by, but the Board has always gotten by without moderators before, and we may not want to start now. Still, we&#39;ll see. For now... Business As Usual?<br><br>hS, who&#39;ll look really silly if no one shows up</p>

            <p>... okay, it doesn&#39;t look very different.

            <p>Anyway, I guess that by style sheets cascading style sheets are meant. I think that the problem here is that a margin needs to be defined for the main frame (where the main content is). If you know what that is called on the style sheet just add something like this:<br><br>#main_content { margin: 40px 12.5em 20px 20px;<br>    padding: 20px;<br>  }<br><br>Margin and padding both have the effect of placing text further from the border of the screen. There&#39;s probably more specifics to it, but I&#39;d have to look that up. Thing about style sheets is that you make them once and don&#39;t have to bother about them until you want to change them. Knowledge about them doesn&#39;t seem to stick much for lack of use.</p>

            <p>Seems to me they&#39;d be less like authority-wielding mods, and more like kind of security guards. I think that kind of a system would mostly be used just when we needed to get rid of a troll or something, like you said. It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they&#39;d have to act as moderators. (We could give them Dandelion uniforms or something.)<br><br>Nonetheless, I&#39;m in favor of keeping the old board, if only because we don&#39;t need to update the web address or anything <s>and it makes it easier for those of us who have the old URL memorized</s>.<br><br>Also, far from being silly, you pretty much become Board Hero for the moment.

            <p>... the Ypur appears to be a bovine, probably related to either the musk ox or the yak (going on what I recall of the picture linked to a while back). Any actual specific biological details you need, just ask, rather than me making this tl;dr by filling it with stuff about four chambered stomachs and cloven hooves :P<br><br>As to tasks, most bovines can be domesticated to provide meat, milk and leather products, or as draught animals to pull heavy things or to carry riders.<br><br>I am NOT volunteering to castrate any male Ypurs to make them more docile. Yes, I do know the theory and several techniques. But no, I am not doing it.<br><br>However I am working on re-opening the PPC Cute Animal Friends Adoption Agency and I&#39;m sure room can be found for any spare Ypurs there.</p>

So what I really need is the Ukrainian for &quot;Welcome to&quot;, well, <i>anywhere</i>.<br><br>hS, master of extremely strange requests</p>

            <p>Speaking of which, would it count as Sueism if my agents were to accidentally pick up an Object in the course of an execution, when they realise the only way to safely get away from the Holder is to pass its test? The entire series is in second-person, so technically there is no canon Seeker whose canon life-story could be damaged, but they damn sure wouldn&#39;t be looking for the rest of the things - they&#39;d have to portal back into the Holders canon and find an actual Seeker to pawn it off onto. But the things can&#39;t just be handed over, they have to be &quot;won&quot;, so they&#39;d also have fun thinking up some ridiculously humiliating and hysterically funny thing the Seeker would have to do to get it ...</p>

            <p>I rather like that idea. A new story to break up the Holders series would be nice, too-- my main issue with the Holders is that there are way too many and they ended up being much of the same, so I am in favor of an actual story for one of them.<br><br>Be ruthless in figuring out what troubles the Seeker should overcome/tape the outcome and hold a screening for other agents?<br><br>P.S. if you liked the Holders, check out the SCP series? Paranormal objects and government coverup, hooray!</p>

            <p>To Every Single Ficcer of My Work,<br><br>Stop.  Immediately.  That means &#39;now&#39;, in case I&#39;m using a word too big for your tiny little brains.  Any other words you don&#39;t understand, go get a dictionary.  If you don&#39;t know what one is, ask an adult and then beat your head against the wall for being such a moron.<br><br>I started as a ficcer myself so I&#39;m not at all opposed to the writing of fanfiction.  I am, however, totally and completely opposed to fanfic as profoundly horrible as all of you have produced.  I am disgusted and infuriated you would so totally abuse what I have spent over ten years crafting and refining and it will be over my cold, dead body such filth and trash is allowed to remain online.  I will be contacting whoever runs this archive or hosts this website and making it clear that unless all fanfic for my novels is removed they will be served with a lawsuit.  So will every single person--or their parents/guardians, if they&#39;re under eighteen--whose work remains posted online and, yes, I do have ways of finding out.  Thirty may sound ancient to some of you and you might assume you&#39;re sooooooooo much smarter than me with computers and the internet.  Keep thinking that.  I&#39;ll see you in court.<br><br>Two things:<br><br>1) What kind of crack were you snorting when you got the idea for Kyle/Brian?  Kyle and Brian are both straight as a ruler.  Maybe it&#39;s just me and the dozens of people over the years who&#39;ve beta&#39;d my stories, but all of us agree there are plenty of reasons why neither of them will ever get their rocks off with another guy.  The most they ever are is friends.  Period, end of story.  It&#39;s OOC for both of them and there are gay, lesbian, and bisexual characters in my novels so use them for your slash.<br><br>2) Anyone who wrote Laurel/Brian taking place within the timeline of my novels has earned my especial loathing and contempt.  Not only is it <b>incredibly</b> poorly written and executed, not a single one of you has given them any plausible reason for him to betray Felicity--his wife and her good friend--in that way.  Neither of them a nymphos with hair trigger libidos that explode into mindless passion the moment they&#39;re alone together.  Brian sees her as a sister, people.  A sister.  Speaking of sisters, the person who wrote Brian/Shelley has twenty-four hours to remove that fic before I sic the lawyers on you.  It&#39;s illegal and disgusting.  Anyway, like I was saying, Brian sees her in a totally platonic manner and Laurel clearly has more than enough self-control to keep her hands off of him.<br><br>Everyone who wrote a rapefic has twenty-four hours as well before the lawyers start getting involved.  Kyle wouldn&#39;t rape any woman, especially Laurel.  You all disgust me, using rape as a plot device.<br><br>With complete and total sincerity,<br><br>Jill O&#39;Brian<br><br>************************************<br><br>To the Agents who PPC&#39;d some of the mess made of my novels,<br><br>Good deeds should be rewarded, so how about this: autographed copies of my novels for the both of you and a cameo in my next novel.  Fair enough? ;)</p>

            <p>Dear so called &#39;fanwriter&#39;,<br><br>This was supposed to be fanfiction. With emphasis upon FAN. I find it difficult to believe that anyone fond enough of my work to term themselves a fan could churn out the drivel I have witnessed from you. Reread the books, please, until you remember that as my characters, they are and remain as I imagined them, not as what passes for your imagination would mutate them into.<br><br>Kindly desist from horrifying me with your illiterate nonsense. My patience is not endless. I may find myself forced to forbid fanfiction based upon my work...and rest assured that I will have you blamed for it. I look forward to either your silence or your improvement.<br><br>Cheers,<br>The author whose books you mangled.<br><br>Dear PPCer,<br><br>Thankyou for recognising the foul excresence that was that so-called &#39;story&#39;. Thankyou for your defense of the works I have writer. You, I consider to be a very genuine fan. Would you like a cameo in my next book, or would you prefer a signed copy of the one you defended so masterfully?<br><br>Yours,<br>A very grateful author.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s see...<br>Dear Suethor,<br>I am most DISPLEASED at seeing your fanfiction about my story posted online for the world to see. It is absolutely atrocious. Character X would have never fallen for your &quot;Princess Sparklypoo of MuffinLand&quot;. Indeed, MuffinLand does not even exist in GenericFantasyLand Y!<br>I used to be a fanfic author, just like you. But what makes us different is that I have an editor, or a beta reader. And I actually listen to them. I place my trust in my spellcheck and I constantly revise my stories to catch errors. From what I can see, you have not. <br>Do review what I have said. And for ReligiousDeity Z&#39;s sake, stop misspelling the characters&#39; names! I have heard of Official Fanfiction Universities, and I seriously am considering opening one for you and everyone else of your writing level. <br><br>To the PPC,<br>I once have read your fanfiction about other worlds in a similar state of disrepair, and I must say THANK YOU for bringing justice to mine as well. I am truly in your debt. <br></p>

            <p>To my dear, beloved, honoured fans,<br><br>If one more of you dares to write my boy Sam-chan in a romantic relationship with your little Mary Sue, I will hunt you down. I can put up with it when you make Tamaji-kun or Kami-kun in love with each other, despite their het love interests, as long as you do it well but Sam has said many times that the thought of being in that kind of relationship with a woman disgusts him. Do you know how many of the other fandoms long for a canon homosexual that they can pair with whichever male they want? Stop complaining and send your little female OC after one of the het/bi characters. Unless, of course, she&#39;s a Mary Sue. In which case, send her to take a long walk off a short pier. Your meddling kids are not wanted here.<br><br>While we&#39;re on the subject, leave Ka-chan alone. She gets barely any screentime as it is, because she&#39;s busy working behind the scenes, don&#39;t start bitching about what a &#39;Sue she is when she finally gets a few chapters. She&#39;s integral to the plot, I promise. Besides, with Kaya we get Tohru and I know you all love him. Maybe that&#39;s the problem.<br><br>To the PPC:<br>Thanks, I guess. It&#39;s flattering to know that my work can install so much passion in a person that they will really drown someone to make sure it isn&#39;t harmed in anyway. Kinda scary as well, but mostly flattering. Keep up the good work.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>the Mangaka.</p>

            <p>...if any of us were to get published, what would you think of fanfiction (of any calibre) of your universe?

            <p>I&#39;d welcome it.  As I said in my letter, I started as a ficcer and I&#39;m not opposed to the idea of fanfic.  I do have issues with crapfic, though.  Mary Sues will forever and always be a reality in fanfic and very few writers start out producing something that&#39;s not full of errors and weaknesses, so I&#39;d tolerate the &#39;Sues and try to help the n00bs better themselves.  I love to hear what people think of what I write so unless the fans gave me a reason not to, I&#39;d definitely go to forums and talk to fans.<br><br><br>I&#39;d limit slash and have zero tollerance for rape!fic and incest!fic.<br><br>Slash, unless it involves one of my GLBT characters, is off-limits for two reasons: 1) I don&#39;t like slash and 2) it would be totally OOC for the het characters of significance, on par with my posting I&#39;d converted to Buddhism and was moving to Tibet to live a life of solitude and prayer.  Like I said, I do have GLBT characters so as long as that slash isn&#39;t getting into anything like furries, scatplay, or serious BDSM and the writer isn&#39;t twisting them OOC it would be stupid to the nth degree to say something, now wouldn&#39;t it?<br><br>Rape and incest, I&#39;d drop a note to the author telling them the story is being pulled and then to the site admin instructing them to have it gone w/in twenty-four hours or they&#39;ll talk to my lawyers*.  That does not, I hope, need any explanation.  If anyone does wonder why I&#39;d have a problem, you need help.<br><br><br><br>*-There are fics out there that involve rape that are well written, in character, and treat the subject with the sensitivity it deserves.  Those, I&#39;d likely leave alone, or if it was a particularly dark fic I&#39;d ask them to move it to an archive for more mature/adult fics.</p>

            <p>slash, rape and incest fics are a part of most fandoms. Sometimes they are well written, a lot of the time they aren&#39;t.<br><br>I write slash, I&#39;m not ashamed to admit that, and I don&#39;t see anything wrong with it. As long as the characters are IC, then it isn&#39;t a problem. Very few people in life are completely, 100% straight or gay. Experimentation, especially amongst teens, happens. As long as these facts are acknowledged, there is nothing wrong with writing a slash fic.<br><br>If you have to break up a canonical pairing, heterosexual or otherwise, for your slash, with little reason other than &#39;all women are evil/his wife was abusing him/he didn&#39;t love her really&#39;, then that&#39;s not right. There should be a reason for ignoring canon pairings. You can make it a past fic if you have to. Just provide justification for the breaking up of canonical happiness.<br><br>If you, as the author, don&#39;t want fans to slash two characters then you should strive to put in as little subtext between them as possible. The pairings I write are ones that have canonical subtext in them, and in some cases are actually the most popular pairings in the fandom.<br><br>Rape!fic is trickier. It&#39;s not something I&#39;d write, mostly because I don&#39;t think I could do it justice, but there are some characters in my fandoms that I think would carry out that act. That&#39;s not to say that all characters would rape someone, or that all people think that way, but rather that it&#39;s my personal interpretation. Unfortunately rape, non-con and dub-con fics are very rarely written well and so are an off-putting factor for many people.<br><br>Incest is not something I read or write, except on rare occasions, i.e. the relationship between the characters wasn&#39;t revealed until late in the canon and there weren&#39;t even hints of it before that. However, some people find incest interesting and some people just like to write about two &#39;hawt&#39; characters having sex. Those are the people who are unlikely to be stopped by banning fanfiction of a series. Even authorial statements of &#39;that would never happen&#39; are often ignored by fanfiction writers.<br><br>As for stopping kink fics, that&#39;s very difficult. You can&#39;t state &#39;I will allow fanfiction but only as long as everyone writes about canon relationships and doesn&#39;t deviate from what I have written at all and I don&#39;t want people writing anything kinky&#39;. You either allow it, the good and the bad, kink fic and gen fic, or you ban it altogether.</p>

            <p>I know you&#39;re never going to stop everyone from writing fic you don&#39;t like, or fic in general.  Case in point: there are sites full of NC-17 HP fics and Jo&#39;s made it clear she doesn&#39;t want NC-17 fics written with her characters.  I just don&#39;t want it showing up on ff.net and other sites that get a lot of traffic.<br><br>At this point in my writing, all the characters have settled any questions they might&#39;ve had about their sexuality.  Bri&#39;s a moderately conservative Christian so he&#39;d never act on any homosexual urges and Kyle wouldn&#39;t because...he just wouldn&#39;t.  There&#39;s a reason but it&#39;s complicated and involves issues and baggage from his childhood that he refuses to deal with.  He still wouldn&#39;t even if he got therapy but at least he&#39;d be able to explain why in twenty words or less. ;)  The only subtext I&#39;ve tried to lay for them is one of friendship and mutual respect, both personally and professionally.</p>

            <p>I agree that NC-17 should not be on ff.net, mostly because of how many children frequent that site. Unfortunately there is plenty of evidence that underaged users are all over adult alternatives such as aff.net. There is no reliable way to block them out either. I know I used to lie my way into aff on a regular basis.<br><br>If there&#39;s a reason why a character would never experiment then I would respect that when writing fanfiction.

            <p>The NC-17 thing was just an example of people ignoring what the author&#39;s said.  I should&#39;ve separated that from the next sentence, which was referring to my own theoretical very popular novels.  I know people are going to write slash and rape and incest.  I&#39;d just want to keep a lid on the stuff people wrote about my characters, so I&#39;d put the kibosh on rapefic and whatnot being posted publicly and aff.net would be one of the first sites I informed of my wishes.<br><br>aff.net does the best they can to keep minors off the site but of course it&#39;s not 100%.  No matter how good of a mousetrap they build, the mice will eventually figure out a way to steal the cheese without tripping the trap.<br><br>Friendship fics are a total blast to write.  That&#39;s what the majority of what I&#39;m turning into a novel is, and there&#39;s a lot of guy/girl friendship.  Two people giving each other hell and jerking each other&#39;s chains and showing up with guns and ammo when the other needs reinforcements--or stays on the phone for three hours at 2 a.m. when they need to get up for work at 6 a.m. because the friend is having a really hard time of it and needs someone.  I have a guy friend like that and I love him to death.  Platonically, of course. ;)</p>

            <p>She plagerized not a small amount of the Draco Trilogy, if you hadn&#39;t already heard, and the first two books of her trilogy have been sporked over at .  I sporked <i>City of Ash</i>, or whatever the title of the second book is.  People familiar with HP and Buffy have found numerous instances where it&#39;s like all CC did was change the name (i.e., Auror to Shadowstalker).  Also, an assortment of characters, items, abilities, and other such things from Laurel Hamilton&#39;s Anita Blake Series, the Wheel of Time series, the comic book series <i>Fables</i>, the <i>Deathgate Cycle</i>, and the <i>Deathstalker</i> series have been identified.  Valentine, for example, and Clary being able to do magic with runes she doesn&#39;t know?  Apparently, taken straight from Weis and Hickman&#39;s Deathgate Cycle.</p>

            <p>If I ever got popular I fear that my characters would be &#39;shipped incessantly and without regard to their actual preferences (or lack thereof). A couple of them wouldn&#39;t mind, but that&#39;s beside the point. The worst things is that &quot;daughter of&quot; Sues would be plausible for those same characters, because they live in a setting without birth control as we know it and they don&#39;t really care, either.<br><br>I guess I&#39;d be more amused than annoyed most of the time. Legendary Badfic WOULD make me upset at the stupidity--I&#39;d like to think I would attract intelligent readers, and I would be disappointed to find otherwise. As other people have pointed out, though, actually reading fanfic of my books is probably a no-no. I might do moderated chats and interviews to try and keep a handle on things, though. If the PPC wanted to interview me, well, that would be sweet. I&#39;d trust them to ask all the right questions. {= )<br><br>Honestly, though, I don&#39;t even know if I want to be that popular. Published, yes, but I&#39;d be very happy with a small body of dedicated readers. Much less BS that way.<br><br>... My work can get hugely popular after I die.

            <p>Meaning that I can see a particular story or situation going several different ways. I also sometimes have the characters in one place at one time, and then somewhere else a week later, and I don&#39;t write what happened between.<br><br>So I&#39;d be really pleased if people read my books, liked the stories, and then tried to write stories explaining what might have happened in the interim. Or if they wrote AUs of the books. Or if they wrote stories that could fit in alongside mine.

            <p>who would love that and probably end up putting little hints in the canon to encourage odd yaoi pairings. I wouldn&#39;t like badfic of course but anything would be worth any goodfic that my work generated. As for talking to fans... I might actually create my own account on ff.net or somewhere, pretend to be just a fan, and write my own fanfic. See if anyone figures out who I am.

            <p>But if I found more than five Legendary Badfics without Legendary Goodfics to balance it out, I would cry. Potentially, if I found a story I really like, I would include a cameo from the lead character, or make a reference to the character&#39;s home-town, but nothing too in-depth.<br>But yes, overall, I&#39;d be very flattered.

            <p>Well, it makes a huge difference that I&#39;ve been in the fanfic world for long enough that I know how good and bad it can be. That makes a huge difference.<br><br>I&#39;d certainly be flattered by goodfic; I think I&#39;d enjoy be surprised by the creativity and detail that people create and expand on. Alternate universes would be interesting, and if there&#39;s a lot of angstfic or &quot;fix-it&quot; AUs, I&#39;d be pleased because that means I&#39;ve pulled their emotional strings the way I wanted. <br><br>As for badfic... knowing what I know, I like to think I&#39;d accept it as a necessary evil - after all, twelve year old fanbrats will be thinking it, even if they don&#39;t write it down. Seeing X-rated bad slash with two of my most beloved het characters would probably make me shudder, close the window, and contact the PPC for some bleepka. <br><br>Seriously? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;d make as many flat (&quot;No, he IS straight&quot;) statements as possible to dissuade the &quot;but there&#39;s no PROOF!&quot; types, and make it clear what types I don&#39;t apperciate, but beyond that... <br><br>I doubt I&#39;d make a Rice or McCaffery-style flat rejection; it just forces them underground. At least if they&#39;re writing something, they&#39;re still interested enough to buy more books and send me more money. ;p<br><br>I really don&#39;t know. I&#39;m very protective of Agents Sedri and Iza, and I find myself getting prickly when offering them for a cameo because I want to make sure they stay in character. Thankfully I can trust everyone here to look at my missions and do their best. <br><br>Finding that PPCers were patrolling badfic for my continumn would make me feel very, very honoured. </p>

            <p>It would make me unbelievably happy. &lt;3 &#39;Cause it would mean that other people liked my characters as much as I did. I&#39;d probably dance around and *squee* for a while.

            <p>What I&#39;d say to a badficcer depends on what the main &quot;bad&quot; part of the fic was. Bad SPAG a la &quot;legolas&quot;? Anatomy fail a la the Spear Incident?

It&#39;s me. Just called to tell you that ... well, that badfic you recently sporked? Actually, I wrote that and posted it anonymously as an experiment. I wanted to see how bad I could make it before people stopped telling me it was great. They love it. I&#39;m scared. Hug me now.&quot;</p>

            <p>Dear Badficcers: While I&#39;m glad you know about my books, I have to wonder if you&#39;ve <i>read</i> them -and, if so, how recently. I suggest that you set aside all current conceptions of the characters and read the books again with an open mind. This may help you to write something that bears a resemblance to the original, as opposed to something that is similar to it only in the names of the characters.<br><br>Dear PPCers: Glad to have you aboard.

While I&#39;m surprised you have the cranial wherewithal to <i>read</i> my books, let alone write fanfiction about them, I am very happy that you have.  Regardless of what you pounded out on your keyboard while you were watching TV, you have made me a very wealthy woman.  I will spend the money you used on my books to promote better literacy and reading comprehension in the public schools, so your like does not surface again. <br><br>In addition, your fanfiction is so miserably inept that my writing looks infinitely better the more you try to mangle it.  Anyone who didn&#39;t like my books the first time around will now think I&#39;m Voltaire in comparison to your literary excretions.<br><br>However, I cannot allow my canon to go unprotected.

            <p>So, the flooder switched servers for last night&#39;s bombardment. The new server seems to be coming through GoDaddy, although I&#39;m really not sure - the IP is a good bit harder to trace, to the point where I don&#39;t want to start bothering admins.<br><br>The MO is still entirely the same - most likely a script that posts the same thing over and over, as often as it can get away with it.<br><br>Now, I&#39;ve E-mailed back and forth a few times with the original host, and they really can&#39;t do anything about it without logs, which will tell them a whole ton more than the IP address can - that IP address is the address of a server running more than three hundred website accounts, so finding a single script running what&#39;s really a commonplace request is nearly impossible to track down.<br><br>So, I E-mailed the server.com people, and while they removed the first set of spamming, they didn&#39;t even E-mail me back to say that they really can&#39;t give me (or the first host) the logs needed to axe the spammer&#39;s account.<br><br>And then the flood came back from a different IP address last night...<br><br>That&#39;s all I know for a fact. What comes after this is just speculation.<br><br>The flooder seems to be out to get us. The first server he used was not a free (or even terribly inexpensive - $100 per year) service, and I suspect the second was the same. Furthermore, he didn&#39;t stop after the first banning and go after easier targets.<br><br>Also, try googling for phrases that he used - the only hits you&#39;ll get are from our board. This wasn&#39;t a mass spamming of server.com forums, this was a rather precisely targeted attack.<br><br>As a correlary to that last point, note that the PPC board is rather hard to find if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re looking for. All the Google searches I could think of to find an active server.com forum don&#39;t bring us up for ten pages or more, after tons of other forums, including some rather controversial political ones. If our flooder was just looking for a good target, we really aren&#39;t it.<br><br>So, where does this leave us?<br><br>We can&#39;t get the logs we need to get the flooder&#39;s server space killed. Thus, at least for now, we can&#39;t get the attack to stop.<br><br>On the plus side, the server.com people responded very promptly to my E-mail by removing the flood and quite probably banning the IP address as well. Reporting to them seems to be, at least temporarily, the best option.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t had more time to spend on this - work is absolutely crazy, I&#39;m working nine hour days, and expecting closer to twelve on Wednesday.<br><br>-Dann</p>

            <p>...but I found something very strange while Googling for answers.  I&#39;m not techno savvy enough to really help out, so I went about looking in my own way.  Namely, I Googled the phrases binservices spambot, and got one hit.  A site called Sign Up 4 Spam.  I don&#39;t know if this is relevant or not, since I could not load the page, but to me it seemed extremely suspicious.</p>

            <p>That site seems to be one where people post the email addresses of people they want to get spammed (it&#39;s been down for a couple of days, btw). I noticed yesterday that binservices was there. Someone&#39;s clearly pissed at them. Whether that somebody is our board flooder, someone else who got targeted in some way by the flooder, or someone else who has an unrelated grudge against binservices, though, is impossible to determine.

            <p>We all started as noobs. Let me see if I can explain somewhat less geekly than I usually do.<br><br>The yourwebapps.com forums are vulnerable to spam because no login, or authentication of any type, is required. If you look down the board a bit, you&#39;ll see a post entitled &quot;If this posts, the proxy IP isn&#39;t blocked (nm)&quot;. You&#39;ll also see that it was posted from 72.167.203.129, the IP that the spammer has been using. He didn&#39;t post that, though; I did.<br><br>72.167.203.129 is a proxy server. It acts as an intermediary between a user (me, the spammer, someone whose company&#39;s firewall blocks Fark, whoever) and the actual site. Let&#39;s say I want to post &quot;If this posts...&quot; here via that proxy. I tell the proxy what web page I want, it sends the request to the webserver, then passes it back to me. The webserver only ever sees the proxy&#39;s IP, not mine; only the proxy server knows who I am. When I enter my post, it goes to the proxy server, not yourwebapps.com; the proxy server then submits it to yourwebapps, and it gets posted as normal. In fact, I&#39;m using a proxy server right now, though not that one.<br><br>So, anyone who has net access can post on our board. They don&#39;t need an email address, an account anywhere (a library or other public computer will work fine), or much of anything else. It&#39;s like the old days of the Net, before the great spam plague. If they go through a proxy server, they can post without giving anyone but the owner of the  proxy server any clue who they are, and for obvious reasons, the proxy owner won&#39;t talk without (or even with, if they&#39;re offshore) a court order.<br><br>The binservices email address is listed on the home (and only) page, a placeholder, of binservices.com, which was registered for a while before this happened. So it has at least some solidity to it, unlike the other phantoms I&#39;ve been chasing.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t created to spam because the type of spam that has been done -- namely, of this board -- doesn&#39;t need a valid email account. Or a valid anything, actually. It just needs someone knowing where the board is. The Usenet posts connected to it, which also (like signupforspam.com, and our flood) seem to be attempts at getting the real binservices spammed, likewise don&#39;t require any type of verification.<br><br>So, there&#39;s no need for the actual binservices gmail account, website, or anything else, to be involved at all. It&#39;s apparently someone <i>else</i> our spammer has a beef with, and he&#39;s trying to kill two birds with one spam by flooding our board, and getting us mad at the other guy, who had nothing to do with the spam.<br><br>I could post here as binservices, the Queen, Techno-Dann, or you, and the board would be equally happy to accept my posts. No sock puppet accounts required. You know I&#39;m not you, and you could figure out that I&#39;m not Dann because I&#39;m not using the same IP he does, but for all you know, I <i>am</i> binservices or the Queen.<br><br>Does that make any sense?<br><br>There&#39;s a great webiste — <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com">How Stuff Works</a> — that explains about how all sorts of things work, including a lot of Internet things. It&#39;s a good place to go to get de-noobified, and a lot more fun than reading RFC&#39;s.<br><br>(yes, that part about RFC&#39;s was a bit of intentional geekery)</p>

            <p>Because of my interviews of various authors for my university essay - I included a bunch of obvious badficcers (some of whom never responded), including a Legendary Badfic author (who did respond). <br><br>It wouldn&#39;t have been hard for any one of them to google my penname and find both my livejournal (which does link to the PPC, as I archive my missions there), my FFN account, and the Board, all three of which appear in the first two pages of a google search. <br><br>I don&#39;t <i>think</i> I said anything offensive to anyone, but the very fact that I went out and interviewed some *cough* &#39;Highly Sensitive&#39; authors about their work, while being part of a community that so blatently mocks it, could have offended them. (I&#39;m not inclined to suspect the Legendary Badfic author, though, as his tone in the emails was quite satisfied, but then again, I could be wrong.)<br><br>If this is the case... guys, <i>I am <b>SO</b> sorry</i>. I considered using a second (little used) penname to send my interviews to the badficcers and other random writers (as opposed to the people who know me by this name), but figured that it would be all too easy for them to be connected (how many people do the same project at the same time?), so I didn&#39;t bother.<br><br>Until now, I didn&#39;t really think it was connected, but from what you&#39;ve said above, Dann... well, the timing is just too close. <br><br>I really, really hope I&#39;m wrong. I&#39;m even hoping that the offended spammer (if that is indeed the case) found this through another link just so I can stop feeling guilty. It wasn&#39;t even a foolish choice on my part, but if this is the result... damm, I&#39;m sorry. </p>

            <p>In an RPG I joined, one of the players started a post with this:<br><br><i>They&#39;re somewhere in the middle of Oxford and by the middle he means middle-of-nowhere, because there&#39;s nothing but countryside for miles. All lush green rolling hills and the occasional spectacle of grazing livestock.</i><br><br>I was confused at first because I&#39;ve been to Oxford and it doesn&#39;t look much like that, and then it dawned on me the person likely meant Oxfordshire, so in the OOC post I said &quot;Just a note: it&#39;s Oxfordshire, not Oxford&quot;.  Tonight I check my email and I have two people jumping on me.  One says &quot;I think she knows what she was talking about when she made the post&quot;, to which I replied &quot;Unless there&#39;s a part of Oxford I haven&#39;t seen before, then based on the description in that post, it sounds like she&#39;s talking about Oxfordshire, not the city of Oxford.&quot;<br><br>The other was downright hostile: &quot;Just a note (and unlike the first gentleman, I mean this to completely be a bastard): Obviously your perception is skewed. This is not your journal and certainly not the place for you to come criticizing anyone. So, uh, kindly redraw that line and step behind it. Better yet, let me help you out.<br><br>______________________________________________<br><br><br>There you go, go on and step right on behind that. Thanks for visiting. Come see us again soon. :D<br><br>I&#39;m out of line correcting a detail?  MY perception is skewed?  *twitchtwitchboom*  <br><br>I tried to be polite when I replied with &quot;No offense was meant and I&#39;m sorry if it came off that way. I was pointing up a detail I noticed and I wasn&#39;t aware pointing something out in the OOC area was out of line. I didn&#39;t criticize anything she wrote or how she was portraying the character, I pointed out an error in a place name. Big difference. So sorry if people here mistake that for criticizing them.&quot;<br><br>I checked a map of England and when I looked up Oxford, it came up as Oxford, Oxfordshire, UK.  Have I missed something and saying &#39;Oxford&#39; goes for the city and the surrounding shire?<br><br><br></p>

            <p>You really should read the Legendary Pokemon Goodfics. They aren&#39;t listed on the PPC Wiki, since we&#39;d need a group acknowledgement, but they&#39;re Legendary by my standards.

            <p>In regards to my last post about getting chewed for my RPG comment, the Oxford/Oxfordshire mistake was made in an RPG post my character had no involvement in.  Again, I made my comment in an OOC area, not in response to the actual RPG post itself, and I can&#39;t understand why people are acting like I stepped way over some line.  Was I out of line or are they being uptight?  I&#39;m new to RPG, at least the way these people are going about it.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re better off without them. Honestly, I&#39;ve dealt with their type before, and they&#39;re just a needless source of stress. They take their little forum fiefdoms far too seriously. They have all the charm (and the cranio-rectal inversion) of a particularly uptight homeowner&#39;s association.

            <p>None of this involves the person running the RPG and she hasn&#39;t said anything so the uptight twits can go twist the sticks they have up their rear ends a little bit deeper for all I care.  Besides, it might serve the RPG well that they don&#39;t like me much.  It&#39;ll help them get into character. Well, most of them. ;p  It&#39;s a Doctor Who RPG and I&#39;m doing River Song.  One of the twits is doing the Master and another is doing an incarnation of Rose (I forget which version).  The person I &#39;insulted&#39; is, IIRC, the Tenth Doctor.  *shrugs*  Whatever.  He&#39;s not supposed to much trust River in the beginning, anyway, and she&#39;s certainly not one to care what anyone else thinks, though I&#39;ll have to pretend to care in this case.  *makes gagging motions*</p>

            <p>RP is like writing, as far as I&#39;m concerned. People fall into the same traps as fanfic writers--it&#39;s just a role-play, it&#39;s not important, it&#39;s just for fun, so I can do whatever I want. My guess is that they took your comment as an infringement on fun and/or a personal insult and ran with it.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who has seen a lot of dumb stuff in RP settings.</p>

            <p>Wow, that&#39;s not a nice RP site.  This is why I like RPing on Landel&#39;s Damned.  You wouldn&#39;t get chewed out for correcting that mistake there.

            <p>It&#39;s good that your first response was civil.  That gives them a chance to be civil as well, or, as it seems, to chew you out for &#39;criticizing&#39; another player.  Then, by all means, chew them out.  Unfortunately, it looks like they&#39;re not going to let you.  Seems cowardly to me, accusing you of something then preventing you from defending yourself.</p>

            <p>Has any of David Gonterman&#39;s work been done by the PPC before?  Nothing shows up on the Wiki search for the name &quot;Gonterman&quot;.  Anyway, if his stories haven&#39;t been done before (would really, really surprise me... the man is &quot;legendary&quot;), I&#39;d like to claim the &quot;Davey Crockett&quot; trilogy of Power Rangers/Sonic the Hedgehog/Sailor Moon/everything under the sun crossover for a story.  I tried to find something about the due process of writing for this website, but there didn&#39;t seem to be any easily accessible page.  Any input would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>1) David Gonterman is a badfic author? &#39;cause the way your question was frased I first thought he was a canon author and I&#39;ve never heard the name. Which probably means that he is not that legendary. But as a badficcer he could be legendary in his fandom. or fandoms as seems to be the case.<br><br>2) So you would like to be a PPC author?

            <p>He&#39;s more infamous for his original comics (which borrow so heavily from everything else that they may as well just be fanfiction), but he started out by writing fanfiction.  Since this was circa 1995-1997 or so and he has since abandoned fanfiction, it&#39;s not too hard to see why he&#39;d become a bit obscure (in fact, it&#39;s more likely that everybody who reads these stories today do so because they found him through one of his great many webcomics).  Anyway, his stories have a certain... je-ne-sais-quoi to them.  They&#39;re highly disjointed, poorly structured, have no respect whatsoever for any canon they draw from, tenuous continuity, and everything pretty much revolves around his blatant self-insert author avatar of David &quot;Davey Crockett&quot; Kintobor.  Grim sights, to be sure.  Anyway, &quot;The Piasa Bird&quot; can be found at the first link (which has oh-so-subtle folder directories), with &quot;Blood and Metal&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon: American Kitsune&quot; at the second link:<br><br><a href="http://www.tuxedojack.com/godawful/nauseating/gonterman/gonterman-Piasa.txt"><a href="http://www.tuxedojack.com/godawful/nauseating/gonterman/gonterman-Piasa.txt">http://www.tuxedojack.com/godawful/nauseating/gonterman/gonterman-Piasa.txt</a></a><br><a href="http://www.commuterbarnacle.com/gonterman/text.html"><a href="http://www.commuterbarnacle.com/gonterman/text.html">http://www.commuterbarnacle.com/gonterman/text.html</a></a></p>

            <p>It&#39;s regular text.  Anyway, it is legendary, but not really as offensive as most entries on that sordid list.  It&#39;s more offensive for its hateful themes than for openly disgusting content.  I&#39;ll write out the fair warnings for the really offensive parts in PG-rated descriptions:<br><br>1) There&#39;s a racist undertone throughout all three of them against African Americans.  The basis for the plot is that David &quot;Davey Crockett&quot; Kintobor lost his arm in a racial riot.  It generally portrays African Americans as mindless monsters compared to the Mighty Whitey of Davey.  At least it&#39;s mercifully limited to backstory after The Piasa Bird.<br><br>2) More offensive are the homophobic overtones in the last few chapters of Sailor Moon: American Kitsune.  Every single offensive slur directed against homosexuals that one can think of gets used as Davey kills an openly homosexual Sailor Moon villain in graphic detail.  Afterwards, Davey gives a speech on the evils of homosexuality and how it ruined his live to be unfairly associated with it in high school.  The Sailor Senshi than weep after it, completely agreeing with the incredibly hateful viewpoints.  This chapter pretty much banished Gonterman from the online Sailor Moon community forever.  Mentioning him on a Sailor Moon forum is -still- guaranteed to send the community up in arms even after 12 years.  That&#39;s how offensive it was.<br><br>3) As if racism and homophobia wasn&#39;t bad enough, there&#39;s also a certain amount of sexism.  His portrayal of the Sailor Senshi is as a completely incompetent pack of fawning fangirls that fight each other for a chance to claim Davey as their own (yeah, certainly no wish fulfillment going on here...).<br><br>4) And as a hat trick to all this, Gonterman also rewrote Usagi/Serena&#39;s backstory just to make her Davey&#39;s sister.  By itself, it wouldn&#39;t be that bad (it&#39;s not like there&#39;s any shortage of noncanon siblings to canon characters out there), but Gonterman gave her the most truly demeaning origin possible (I won&#39;t describe it because the simple description of it probably count as NC-17 rated for making one want to bash their head against a concrete wall).  As if just trying to go further, it both turns their earlier relationship into incest (actually... the implied sex scene is also really disturbing as well) but they still decide to tentatively go forward with the relationship anyway.  And it&#39;s not even like Gonterman just forgot about the plot detail like he&#39;s prone to doing.  No, he calls attention to it each time they indulge in flirting with each other (at least there isn&#39;t any more implied sex) and gives Usagi the attitude that Davey is just too good a catch to give up even if it turns out that they&#39;re siblings.  I can&#39;t make stuff like this up even if I tried.<br><br>Actually... scratch my earlier statement about it not being so offensive.  It&#39;s not safe for sanity whatsoever.  What makes it extra creepy is that this is blatant wish fulfillment for Gonterman (he didn&#39;t even bother to come up with a terribly creative cipher for his self-insert), but his wishes include the gory death of homosexuals, the banishment of African Americans, and for every woman to be a fawning doormat to him.  And he uses a bunch of TV shows intended for young children to facilitate this (imagine the surprise of an 11 year old girl browsing for Sailor Moon stories and happening upon this... abomination).  Yeah... this stuff is definitely a shoe-in for the Legendary Badfic list.</p>

            <p>Ahhhh...found Ewoyn lurking around my ancient LotR and HP fics. I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve never posted those. I might have ended up getting put on the Legendary Badfic list. Or PPC&#39;d at least. <br>I don&#39;t mind taking care of Ithillien <i>and</i> Mara. I found him with Ewoyn, by the way, snuggling up in the corner and earning dirty looks from an old OC who is undoubtedly a Mary Sue. Like the whole magic staff with a blue crystal doesn&#39;t give it away...<br><br>*looks at minis* Ewoyn! Don&#39;t DO that! Now I&#39;ll need Bleeprin to get rid of the images! Come on Ewoyn, we&#39;re going to Aunty Cassie, she&#39;ll send you home...what&#39;s that? Oh...that way, huh?<br>*looks back* I think Ewoyn&#39;s in love with Ithillien...I&#39;ll send her back though...</p>
