First off...SHE&#39;S HALF-HOBBIT? And why would Elrond hate hobbits? He&#39;s had five in his house. What happened to &quot;kind as Summer&quot;?

            <p>There are plenty of badfics and Mary Sues in the Fairytale portion of the Pit. Is there policy regarding PPCing those stories? I know that fairy tales are common property and most of the main characters are Sues anyway (Cinderella, Snow White, etc.), but not all fairy tale characters are Sues. And I&#39;ve always loved fairy tales so seeing what people do to them in the Pit is extremely frustrating.<br><br>If this has already been discussed could someone send me the link?<br><br>Helen of Pylos</p>

            <p>If they&#39;re going after a particular version (such as the Disney movies) then they&#39;re fair game.  Straight fairy tales have so many different versions that it&#39;s hard to judge what&#39;s canon and what&#39;s not, so I think we mostly avoid them.<br><br>Bad Slash and such involving canon fairy tale characters could probably be PPCed, if the violations are obvious.  </p>

            <p>Hey, my Chinese name may mean &quot;precious jewel&quot; or if you don&#39;t write it correctly...&quot;moon&quot;, but here in America, it&#39;s the very bane of me. <br>Pronounced the Western way, it sounds like a personal pronoun. Who wants the world to think they were named after a personal pronoun? GAHHHHHH! I adopted a more normal moniker when I started grade school, but nooooo, my parents registered me under the Terrible Chinese Name Of Doom. So now, I&#39;m constantly correcting my teachers and subs.

            <p>Like the CCS character then. I actually kinda like that name but I don&#39;t think I could get away with naming a kid that outside of China.

            <p>Hello, everyone!  I&#39;m proud to say that I have finally come back into the world of actual PPC mission-writing.  My agents have returned from their hiatus, red pens at the ready.  They&#39;re a little older, a little wiser, but hopefully just as much fun.  We have a cute little Sue to maim tonight, so gather, one and all, &#39;round the flamethrower, and listen to her tale of woe. Thanks to all who volunteered cameos for the Welcome Back Party. <br><br><a href="http://uncommon-comma.livejournal.com/7796.html">Thar she blows, matey!</a><br><br>Man, have I missed these.

            <p>I&#39;ve been copying it into a word file for later torture and it&#39;s so much like what I&#39;ve read of My Immortal that I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that someone has plagiarised the plot. Couldn&#39;t they have done that to a good fic? Save us this torment? For proof, go to chapter four (the &#39;sex scene&#39; at the end) and the beginning of chapter five. Looks like Immortal to me. *commits hari-kari*</p>

            <p>I know I shouln&#39;t be laughing, or snickering, but I couldn&#39;t help it. It&#39;s such a blatant, try-hard rip-off of &#39;My Immortal&#39; that it amuses me to no end.

            <p>The phrase &quot;so i herd u liek mudkips?&quot; refers to this piece of copypasta which explains everything you ever wanted to know about *channers( mildly NSFW). Here it is in its original format.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Copypasta<br><br>    One day on Halloween, I decided to ... with the major retard at school when I came out of science for break. He was dressed as Ash. Knowing this was going to happen, I brought a Mudkips doll. Thus I started the conversation, making sure no one saw me.<br><br>    &quot;So I heard you like Mudkips...&quot;<br><br>    &quot;Mudkips? I LUUUUUUUUUUUURVE MUDKIPS.&quot;<br><br>    &quot;Well uh would you ... a mudki-&quot;<br><br>    &quot;OF COURSE.<br><br>    &quot; happen to have a Mudkips here, and.&quot;<br><br>    Before I finished the sentence, which would have resulted in me hitting him across the face with the doll, he grabbed it. In one swift motion his pants were down and he was violently humping it. Not to get between a man and his Mudkips, I started to walk away, because there is no way I&#39;d be caught wrestling a half-naked crazy guy humping a Mudkips.<br><br>    Needles to say, within 5 to 10 seconds, some girls saw him and started screaming. I cooly walked into a restroom, pretending nothing had ever happened; not that I had intended that outcome, but now that it was in play I didn&#39;t want to be involved.<br><br>    I came back two minutes later, and like any wanton act on school grounds there was now a huge crowd round him. He was still ...ing it and baying this real ...ed up &#39;EEEEEEEEEEINNNNF EEEEEEEEEEINNNF&#39; sound. Suddenly a scuffle broke out in the middle, meaning he probably did something stupid. I asked someone what had happened. A girlfriend of one of the football players tried to get him to stop, but he bit her for trying to take it away. Someone called in a few football players (all dressed up like Road Warrior) who proceeded to pummel the shit out of the guy. Meanwhile the school police were freaking out and having trouble getting in to the situation.<br><br>    A few minutes later the intruder alarm went off and we were shuffled into classrooms. Over the intercom the principal announced that someone had thrown a flaming plush toy into the library. Uh.. what the hell.<br><br>    So we were kept there and about 30 minutes later the principal came on again. This time he was saying that whoever was behind the beating should turn themselves in. All of a sudden this woman began yelling “I WILL SUE YOU FOR DAMAGES. YOU LITTLE PUNKS, I’M GONNA SUE…” and it was cut off.<br><br>    I asked an office later what had happened. Apparently his mother had come to pick him up and threatened to sue for the beating and &#39;whatever else happened.&#39; The school threatened to counter-sue because of lewd conduct, inciting a riot, and starting a fight.<br><br>    So I ask you: do you like Mudkips?<br>-------------------------------------------------<br>That&#39;s what that line refers to.</p>

            <p>I believe we&#39;re all familiar with the snarky, sarcastic and otherwise silly attempts to make a basic disclaimer interesting.

            <p>My Agents are Agent Lily and Christianne, and they work in the Mary Sue Department. Christianne is a veteran, but Lily is a newbie. They go through one mission in the Harry Potter division, then get transferred to LotR. <br><br>Lily is the result of a cloning experiment on a Random Elleth. But that&#39;s odd, because the two have opposite personalities. Lily is considerably more insane and flake-y. And she worships chocolate, coffee, and the Canon. She can pull together enough of what&#39;s left of her sanity during missions, but she&#39;s Hell on wheels at HQ. Never give her a flamethrower. Or Sparkly Shiny Things(tm), because Sparkly Shiny Things bring out the Gollum-like behavior, which in turn is a prelude to more insanity. She likes giving people annoying nicknames, reading, MST-ing, and drawing. Her lust object is Frodo Baggins, and oddly, Dark Haired!Legolas.<br>Eye color: blue<br>Hair color: black<br>Species: Elf, Lord of the Rings type.<br>Canon Literacy Level (CLL): Harry Potter (ok) LotR (semi-Tolkien nerd)  <br><br>Christianne Shieh was recruited from Real Life. She&#39;s a snarky b*tch with sadistic tendencies, and probably the only thing to get yourself on her good side is to give her nutty dark chocolate. Surprisingly enough, she and Lily get along considerably better than other Agents. She also harbors an intense dislike for dresses, Mary Sues, and especially Mary Suvian dresses. <br>Christianne, as mentioned before, is a veteran of &#39;Sue Slaying, having worked in the HP and Naruto divisions. She was moved from Naruto to HP because her partner died, and then assigned to Lily after her partner in the HP division also died. Then, she and Lily are transferred because of a MS fic overload (poor Middle-Earth!). While working in the Naruto section, Christianne learned how to use Japanese weapons. She often tries to demand a license from Upstairs to use them regardless of which division she is in, though the answer is always NO for a good reason. Never give HER a flamethrower, either.<br>Eye color: green<br>Hair color: black<br>Species: Homo sapiens (Human)<br><br>Writing Sample <br><br>(taken from &quot;Andi Black&quot;, the first mission)<br>At one o’clock, Christianne appeared back in the dorm, soaked in blood but grinning, full of job satisfaction. Lily was sitting in her four-poster bed, playing around with a French baguette. Every so often, it would emit a “prrrrp” sound and would transform into something else. <br>“What’s that?” asked Christianne, her curiosity piqued by the baguette, which was now a rubber duck. <br>Lily’s eyes widened. “What, you’ve never heard of D.O.R.K.S?”<br>“Dorks?”<br>“No, no, no!” exclaimed Lily, waving the rubber ducky, now a science textbook, in the air, causing it to turn into a table lamp and then a Harry Potter plushie. “It’s D.O.R.K.S. It stands for ‘Disguise-Outfitting Ryticular Kostume System’. Oh…and it’s the apple of Makes-Things’ eye. We better be careful with it.”<br>“One itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny question. Why is ‘costume’ spelled ‘Kostume’?”<br>“Search me.” Lily pressed something on the plushie, now a Rubik’s Cube ™. She promptly turned into the splitting image of Adalora Black. “How do I look?” she asked Christianne, who backed into another bed. <br>“Scary.” That was all Christianne could say.<br><br>(taken from &quot;What, Mary Sues Can Read?&quot;, one of my LotR fanfics on FF.net)<br>Well…Tolkien must be rolling around in his grave so much by now that if someone harnessed the raw energy he produced, then that person could provide enough energy for an entire neighborhood for almost a year. Talk about going green. For even as he laid in his coffin, rolling around restlessly, these four aberrations of original characters were drawing dangerously close to the hidden valley where the Last Homely House lay, its occupants unaware of their existence. Canon was going on smoothly as usual, and the characters had no worries regarding these four girls. They could hardly be blamed, since the One Ring was in Imladris at that moment, and the Council was already in progress. As Gandalf got up to share his tale, about ten leagues away the four ‘Sues were riding on their equally freakish horses, laughing and talking like friends do.<br><br>So...that&#39;s my little bit. If you need more of my writings to decide on whether you should give me Permission or not, tell me.  </p>

            <p>Forgot to mention it in the original post, but Christianne enjoys setting fire to things, thinking up creative ways to kill &#39;Sues, drawing, reading, being snarky, and annoying the Hell out of Upstairs by constantly asking for that license. <br>Her CLL levels run as thus:<br>Naruto (know-it-all), HP (semi know-it-all), LotR (I read the Canon only ONCE, just to get me into this division and kill Mary Sues) </p>

            <p>Do you mean in terms of showing it and asking for Permission, or simply posting it on the web somewhere? If the latter, there&#39;s no single database to submit to. I use my livejournal, as do several others, and some people have their own websites. <br><br>If the former, look <a href="http://ppcwiki.wikilot.com/wiki/Permission">here</a> and make sure you meet all the requirements, including being an active enough board member.

            <p>I see the others have already given you most data, so I will simply add that we encourage as much interaction as possible; don&#39;t be shy. Before I joined, I was rather shy of posting in other people&#39;s threads in case I was intruding. The PPC pretty much cured me of that ;p</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not a Permission Giver, but I&#39;d just like to put out my opinion here. If anyone vehemently disagrees, they&#39;re more than welcome to beat me over the head with a Clue By Four.<br><br>I really don&#39;t think you should be given Permission.<br><br>For one, a lot of the stuff you&#39;ve posted here for the last several months really isn&#39;t in the spirit of the PPC, and a lot of the time it&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to showboat how hardcore you are, that you can stand shock images and you go on /b/ and stuff. <br><br>Secondly, you don&#39;t even turn up very often. You post possibly half a dozen times a month. That&#39;s nowhere near enough for people to get to know you. The fact that your posts, when they show up, are normally just one liners that give us nothing doesn&#39;t help either. And when people call you out on things, you often ignore it for days and then when, if you reply at all, you pretty much brush off everything they say.<br><br>Another thing, the Agent you made, Janus, is pretty much a total Stu. I know you gave him more &#39;flaws&#39;, but honestly, he still is a Stu. Anyone reading the Agent page (stick link to page here for everyone&#39;s eyes) can see that. Even now, a bunch of edits later, your &#39;Agent&#39; still is a sorry specimen for the PPC.<br><br>Also, finally, you tend to make a lot of people feel uncomfortable when you post, due to the content (shock images from /b/ and so forth) and you don&#39;t seem to post in any thread unless someone that seems especially prominent in the PPC, like Huinesoron, Trojanhorse, or pretty much any remaining oldbie, Permission Giver, or midbie that posts often enough posts there, which quite frankly, is disgusting sycophantic behavior. Everyone here is an equal, regardless of how long they&#39;ve been here or how much they post. Stuff like that leaves poor impressions and a bad taste in everyone&#39;s mouth.<br><br>In short, just no. </p>

            <p>But, for anyone who cares, this is my reason why I haven&#39;t asked for Permission yet, nor will I any time in the near future.<br><br>Basically, I&#39;m terrified someone will one day call me out and say &#39;Hey! This writing&#39;s crap!&#39; (only far more eloquently here). It&#39;s all to do with a couple of writing experiences I had when I was younger, plus terrible insecurity that is also a relic from my primary school days. <br><br>One other thing before I start, please don&#39;t think I&#39;m a wangsty little brat. Rereading this post, while it&#39;s the best I can get it, I&#39;m still worried I&#39;ll paint a picture of myself as a typical emo teenager - someone who thinks their life sucks, even when it doesn&#39;t. Thank you.<br><br>In year 7 (age 11-12), I aspired to be a writer. I had a &#39;Sue from when I was far younger, and I idolised her. She was everything I wanted to be - i.e. Speshul. Primary school, and year seven, were both a rough time for me, so I was feeling pretty hard-done-by. So I wrote this &#39;Sue in private, just in notebooks or whatever, until I found out about Mary-Sues.<br><br>When I first heard of them, I laughed off the fact that my character might be one. &#39;She&#39;s not that special,&#39; I&#39;d say to convince myself.  &#39;She hasn&#39;t got &quot;milk-like skin&quot;, or wings, or chocolate eyes. I&#39;m fine.&#39; But this was all denial. Eventually, I saw sense, and dumped the &#39;Sue, promising myself I wouldn&#39;t write anything like that again. Unfortunately, however, I did.<br><br>When I started writing my second &#39;Sue, I checked litmus tests over and over again. I wanted to make her as believable as possible, and that meant no &#39;speshulness&#39;. It didn&#39;t work. The &#39;Sue turned out a travesty - she was Voldemort&#39;s daughter, with bright red eyes, Luna Lovegood was her BFF, etc. And again, I stopped denying ehat I&#39;d written, and woke up.<br><br>I think at that point, I stopped trusting my writing abilities. Whenever I think, &#39;Oh, such-and-such character might be interesting to try and write&#39;, I imagine bad reviews, being despised as a Suethor, any story of mine being featured on Pottersues. And when it&#39;s originalfic, I keep thinking, &#39;What if I run out of inspiration part-way through? What if no-one wants to publish it? What if I become another Christopher Paolini?&#39;<br><br>So, in short, I&#39;m not going to ask for Permission because I think I suck, and because I&#39;m stupidly insecure. The end.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry for the TL;DR post, and if anyone takes this as aimed at them, because it&#39;s not. You people are some of the nicest I&#39;ve met on the internet, and I have nothing but respect for you - apologies if I come across as bitter and angry. Thank you for your time.<br><br>-Lynxihez, who is now wondering whether this is even the right place to post her bucketload of BAWWWWW.</p>

            <p>Lynxihez, all our Agents have a flavour of Sue or Stu about them somewhere. It&#39;s hard to kick butt in fandom without some special skills :P Hell, half of them ARE ex-Sues and Stus who retain their Suvian abilities.<br>If you have worried that much about your writing, and analysed it that much, I&#39;m willing to bet it isn&#39;t half as bad as you think it is. My advice would be to ask someone else for an impartial readthrough. You don&#39;t have to ask for Permission if you don&#39;t want to, but I&#39;m sure anyone here would be cool with just going over your work with you if you have worries about it. I&#39;ll do it myself if you want. I&#39;d be pleased to.<br><br>Pep talk over, now here&#39;s the explanation.<br><br>The main objection with Fichunter is not his Agent Janus, who, admittedly, is quite Stuish, but who COULD, with work, become a workable Agent. No, the objection, at least as far as I see it and as far as I can glean from other posters, is that he just seems not to understand the point of the PPC and to not be getting into the spirit of the thing, which is the WRITING. Not the blowing shit up, or the steeling ourselves to read bad squick (if that&#39;s your idea of fun). It all boils down to quality of writing. We really are like vigilante transdimensional copy editors.<br><br>And it seems to me that you have a deep concern for the quality of writing, which tells me that you belong here with us, whether or not you choose to actively spork badfic. <br><br>- Trojie</p>

            <p>Oooh, look, I&#39;m only jumping in when Trojie did, same as other people were accused of. Bad me.<br><br>I&#39;ve been watching this thread since July decided to say something, and it&#39;s been a couple of days, and we&#39;ve heard nothing from Fichunter. There has been no response to this entire thread from her/him. That in itself says a lot. The entire thread seems to contain references to &quot;senior&quot; Board members, and that&#39;s not the way it&#39;s meant to work here, which means, in effect, anyone can object, but few dare to. So kudos to July for being the one who dared to.<br><br>And I will also volunteer to look at your stuff, Lynxihez, and quibble with you over any Sueish aspects and how to make them non-Sueish. Glod knows, as other Boarders could tell you, I&#39;ve been critical enough of late when it comes to potential Sueishness; it&#39;d be a fine thing to see a Sue whose author actually wants to fix her, and be able to help with that. Even if you&#39;re not planning to publish anywhere (even online), we&#39;re still happy to talk over how and why you&#39;re writing, and happy to try to help you improve.</p>

            <p>Lynx, I think the fact that you&#39;re so concerned with getting it right is what makes the major difference. I know of very, very few Sue writers who are willing to admit that their stories might need work - the willingness to accept criticism makes a huge difference. <br><br>I won&#39;t offer to help, as there are already quite enough people doing so (and I&#39;m rather swamped with work just now...), but I really suggest you try; even if you&#39;re never going to be the best writer around, I completely believe that anyone who tries hard enough can produce something decent. <br><br>And if not - fine. Everyone understands. And you can still create agents to join with the role-playing here on the Board.</p>

            <p>It can&#39;t be as bad as that. Sure, we&#39;ve all got a Mary-Sue or two in our closet *Ignores the fifty or so in his* but that doesn&#39;t mean anything.<br>But, while we&#39;re on the topic, maybe a new thread could have been used...<br><br>Anyway... The most interesting thing about Mary-Sues is that they can happen anywhere, anytime. Harry Potter, for example, is a prime example of a well-written Gary-Stu. Yes, he is a Gary-Stu, but he&#39;s written in a way that make sit forgivable.<br>Eragon, on the other hand... We just won&#39;t go there.<br><br>But in the end mate, it&#39;s all with you. If you have issues with writing, then just ask. If you post an Agent who seems Stuish / Suish, that&#39;s fine. We&#39;ll let you know, and if you&#39;re open to it, give you help to knock &#39;em down a little. When creating characters, I tend to follow the balance rule, my character might be good at sports, but only sports that require speed, or flexibility. It&#39;s all about limitations.<br><br>And that would be your self-doubt talking. I find the best way to deal with that is to shrug and ignore it. You&#39;re just being hard on yourself. at the very most, you&#39;re saying you could be better, and writing gives you the opportunity to be better, at worst, you stop doing the thing you love doing. Not a good option.<br><br>But again, this is a site for the PPC. Protectors of the Plot Continuum. We spork the occasional badfic, sure, but mostly, we&#39;re here to help guide new writers into what they could be, which could be the next J.k Rowling, or the next Tolkein (Blasphemy!). We don&#39;t go out of our way to hurt people, we just drive the point home when we get ignored. We&#39;re here to help you, and there&#39;s a bunch of people on here who would be willing to Beta anything you do, all you need is ask.<br>Well, to sum up, I&#39;d encourage you to ask permission. We wanna help, and we do enjoy new blood. We just might seem a little harsh right now because someone doesn&#39;t fulfil all the guidelines we expect, which were mostly social. If you&#39;re willing to work on writing, even if you&#39;re a far better writer than J.k Rowling, then we&#39;re always gonna be willing to help you.</p>

            <p>July and Sedri, there&#39;s &quot;turning someone down kindly&quot; and there&#39;s insulting their writing style, them, their agents and everything they stand for. <br>   I acknowledge your tact and honesty, July, but I do not applaud it. By the way I know I may seem rather insolent talking like this to several senior members of the board, and yes I know I&#39;ve probaly made half a dozen spelling and grammatical errors in this post. But, quiet honestly, I think someone had to say something.<br><br>cga <br><br>ps. can I get kicked from the board for being rude to senior members?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s just that I, being overcautious about offending people (and admittedly not having an excellent memory for who has done what), would find it very hard to do what July did, and say what needed to be said. Thus, I admire the fact that she did it, and wanted to say so. It was meant as a careful compliment. <br><br>Everything else I might say in response here has already been said - thanks, July. Le Jai, I really appreciate you sticking up for us. <br><br>And cga? Just to make a personal note, I don&#39;t think you were being insolent (not that I&#39;m even close to being a senior member); you were being honest. Inaccurate, in my opinion, but honest. Not rude. Sharp, perhaps, but not rude, and sharp isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. In any case, I&#39;m glad you said what you think instead of keeping quiet. </p>

            <p>Ah, just sorta interrupting here, but... I&#39;ve seen some of the shock /b/ material July is talking about. It&#39;s not really PPC fare. At all. Considering, most especially, that there are members that aren&#39;t even fifteen yet. People shouldn&#39;t have to look at that if they don&#39;t want to, especially if it&#39;s something like /b/-stuff. And I&#39;m a lurker/Noob myself, so, just saying and all. And if you&#39;re here, you should know that an Agent has to be good to get into the PPC; you can&#39;t just throw a Stu together and expect to get in. It&#39;s just not the way things work. I&#39;m almost positive my possible-agent-idea isn&#39;t going to be good enough, and I am always thinking of how to make it better. You can&#39;t simply just assume yours is good enough. <br><br>Also, out of curiosity, do you know Fichunter at all? Have you seen his posts, etc? Because if you haven&#39;t, I think it&#39;s kind of rude for you to be jumping down Sedri and July&#39;s throats for telling him the truth about his likelihood of getting in. If they think he&#39;s not got a good chance, he&#39;s probably not got a good chance. <br><br>And I really probably oughtn&#39;t be sticking my nose in, but as someone who respects July, Sedri and the other Mid- and Old-bies. <br><br>So, apologies for jumping in where my opinion likely isn&#39;t wanted, but I felt I had to say something.<br><br>And while my response isn&#39;t nearly as well thought out or as definitive as July&#39;s, I still feel the need to put it out there. <br><br>And now, I return to my lurking, and enjoying everyone else&#39;s interesting-ness on the board. </p>

            <p>Being &#39;kind&#39; was not the first concern when I wrote that post. It wasn&#39;t even a main concern. I&#39;m not going to be kind when stating my opinion, and the truth is, that&#39;s my opinion. I typed all of that because I believe that&#39;s the case. I even said that at the very first. &quot;I&#39;m not a Permission Giver, but I&#39;d just like to put out my opinion here. &quot;<br><br>And I said nothing, nothing at all about Fichunter&#39;s writing style. What I said regarding his posts here is that he posts rarely, and whenever he posts something that other people call him out for, he ignores it for a few days and then maybe replies. One of the things that is asked that a person do before they ask for Permission is to be active on the board. A half dozen posts a month that are mostly one-liners is hardly active.<br><br>As to Fichunter himself, I don&#39;t think saying that it seems like someone is showboating themselves, making people uncomfortable due to posting a link (on two different occasions) to a website full of things like bestiality, bad porn, and grotesque death images, or sticking to posting in threads where &#39;prominent&#39; people have posted is being insulting. When you&#39;re only posting in a thread because people like that have posted in it, that&#39;s more of an insult. All I was doing was stating what the situation looked like.<br><br>And when the point of the PPC is to be a fun thing that kills Stus and Sues and other badfic things, having an Agent that is a Stu is against the point. When at one point your Agent is described as reading &quot;...the entirety of Celebrian out loud without bleep-products or showing any disgust, (perhaps the sadistic grin was enough) and won the use of their bleepsinthe for &#39;whenever&#39;&quot; &quot;In an act of true insanity, and a bet between him and the bad slashers&quot;  alongside &quot;He also enjoys sadisticly [sic] &quot;enlightening&quot; the newbies about the many kinds of sex fetishes that suethors love to thinkup [sic] and why glue is not lube.&quot; this is less an Agent and more a Stu that&#39;s copying the characters of other Agents. He only changed all of that after several people read his article for Janus and commented on the talk page thinking he was a troll.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m insulting &#39;insulting... everything they stand for&#39; but if I managed that, I&#39;m definitely impressed with myself. I never even managed to do that when I was a flamer and was trying to do that!<br><br>And everyone is entitled to an opinion, cga. Even if it&#39;s wrong, crass, insolent, rude, stupid, over egotistical, silly, or insulting to someone else. After all, I&#39;m not sure about you, but I don&#39;t live under a totalitarian dictatorship where having an opinion is wrong. Plus, there&#39;s nothing wrong with what you said, you&#39;re definitely not being insolent. Maybe cheeky. <br><br>And no, you can&#39;t get kicked from the board for being rude, and definitely not for being rude to me. Besides, you weren&#39;t even rude here. If you thought you were being rude, you need to stop being so nice. Fynn could probably do something about it though, I imagine.<br><br>Also, long post is long. o.o;<br></p>

            <p>cga, I can assure you, not posting for a few weeks or months isn&#39;t going to get you refused permission - I would hope that you&#39;d post fairly frequently for a week or two once you got back, and then ask, just so everyone remembers who you are.<br><br>Secondly, there&#39;s a huge difference between denying someone permission and branding them as Trolls - we&#39;ve dealt with trolls here before a couple of times, it is very, very, ugly. I, and I suspect anyone who was around here for the last one (anybody else remember that?), will be very careful about branding people trolls.<br><br>Finally, given the... extreme nature of /b/ (protect your innocence, don&#39;t look for it), I think July&#39;s response was fairly well justified. The thing I really want to see, aside from decent writing ability, is maturity - linking hardcore porn/fetish pictures definitely doesn&#39;t display that.</p>

            <p>For one, I&#39;m definitely not an oldbie. XD<br><br>And yeah, definitely. <br><br>Newbie status just means you&#39;re new, stretching back a couple months. <br><br>Most people give gifts to newbies and for birthdays, something they picked out as their thing. Like for instance, Sara does the egg whisk thing. I do a link to the wiki if I don&#39;t get beat to it by a million other people. It used to be pokes, but people went outwards from the letter P, like Tawaki&#39;s plovers, and then from there even further.<br><br>Minis are misspellings of canon names and locations in a fanfic or such. You can&#39;t just grab one if you see one and say it&#39;s your&#39;s, because people tend to adopt them and so that doesn&#39;t work. Occasionally there&#39;ll be a post by Tawaki showing the latest minis he has found, and Cassie does the Mini-Balrogs now.<br><br>You need permission to write official spinoffs, mainly because the PPC is a group written canon, and you don&#39;t really want someone to wreck it at random. Missions and interludes usually require permission, but occasionally, using Pads for an example, they&#39;ll cowrite with someone who already has permission and go around through that loophole, which no one especially minds from what I&#39;ve seen.<br><br>When it comes to PPC RPs, which have popped up time to time, you don&#39;t need permission, but you do need Agents to do those, for obvious reasons.<br><br>Also, as to spelling issues, I suggest looking your posts over before replying, or use a internet browser that provides a spellcheck feature or install one yourself. I use Firefox and it comes with one.<br><br>And yes I am open to questions.</p>

            <p>Though due to my horrible memory for names, I hadn&#39;t made the connection between you and the &quot;shock images&quot; so it&#39;s really got nothing to do with that.

            <p>TROLL IN THE ARCHIVES!<br><br>… thought you ought to know.<br><br>There are five stories by ‘Screaming MeeMee’, but I only know the fandoms of three of them (Harry Potter, Fable and Eragon) so I won’t comment on the other two, which are Kingdom Hearts and Super Smash Bros Brothers (or something).<br><br>Let’s start with the Potter fic: Harry Potter Son fo harry (actual title)<br><br>Author’s Summary: Harry Potter has son and JENNY AND KILLS BAD GUYS!<br><br>Actual Story: Why the hell are you asking me? I’m not exactly privy to the madness of this author’s mind (thank god). As best as I can work out, Harry and Hermione have a son who could be two, seven or eighteen. The timeline’s whacked. Johnny has balloon phobia. Voldemort is alive and unwell. He’s lost all his intelligence (like everyone else) and appears to want Johnny/Johhny as a sex slave… or apprentice. Who knows? If Voldemort becomes a Samurai (which wouldn’t surprise me), it’ll be both. Voldemort lived in Johnny’s eyes and burst out of one in a spray of blood and gore. Aliens are invading… somewhere. An office tower of some sort. Jenny (read: Ginny) plays baseball (despite it being a solely American game) and fights the aliens not with magic, but with kungfu, a new brand of martial arts which seems to involve hitting people with fried potatoes known as ‘chips’. Until description of the aliens arrives, I’m picturing Xenomorphs. It’s an amusing image. The Xenomorphs are also subject to bad boss fights with glowing red spots. I think the troll has played too many bad computer games. Jenny has a strange leap of logic and says that, because they’re aliens, they’re not working for Voldemort. How she worked this out is beyond me, especially since she shouldn’t know that Voldemort’s alive. She also has the inside knowledge that Xenomorphs corrupt souls. For some reason, the aliens are after Johnny too. Back to Johnny and ‘Vodlemort’, Vodlemort has killed Harry and ‘Hermion’ and Johnny decides that he doesn’t care and helping the bad guy rule the world will be a fun use of his time. Man, Harry and Hermion must have been bad parents. And that’s just the first chapter.<br><br>A Little Snippet of Hell:<br><br>Then she saw enemy Boss was not dead and was still alive by dying. She ran to him and talk &quot;Who you guys are coming from? Is it Voldemort?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No...cough...we...cough...we are aliens from...cough...alien city town on plane...cough...t,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;Why did you uys come here to England?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The...cough...boy...cough...WE WANT JOHNNY POTTER...COUGH...&quot; then he died too, but his body disappearer! &quot;Imazing!&quot; Jenny said as the body was gone. &quot;They are from alien town but that means they dn&#39;t work for Voldemort and...Oh no I must rescue Johhny Potter befor more aliens and attack and corrut his soul!&quot;<br><br>And she went and got more kungfu chops.<br><br>Website Address: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4364314/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4364314/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4364314/1/</a></a><br><br>Okay… so, onto the Fable fic: Fable When Evil Men come. If no-one else wants to spork it or something, I volunteer. I’m rather defensive about that fandom.<br><br>Author’s Summary: What happen when evil men come and try destroy Fable&#39;s life? Se here!<br><br>Actual Story: The character’s name is Fable. That was what immediately made me think ‘troll’. Fable is a woodcutter. This means it’s not a short story about the game and is about something else entirely. I don’t know where in Albion it’s set or if it even is in Albion. He goes home and his family are dead. Somehow he knows who is responsible, despite him being nowhere near home. Two years on, he’s found some random teacher who is training him. In the use of a sword and a helmet. What about other pieces of armour like breastplates and greaves? And I don’t suppose it occurred to the author that, as a woodcutter, Fable is already trained in the use of an axe and axes are effective weapons too. The teacher appears to be somewhat evil and claims that defeating the evil people will somehow make him powerful. Randomly, a girl walks up to Fable. They like each other. They have a brat of a child. Notice I said girl. Now, yes, girl can mean woman, it’s brought up the incredibly disturbing image of a six-year-old having sex with someone who could be anywhere from ten to eighty. But the girl seems to leave him because, when the evil men return, they only kill the brat. You know, I’m starting to think that the evil men are actually the good guys, but it’s from Fable’s POV so he’ biased. Hmm? Anyway, it appears that the teacher dies (heart attack? Evil men? Balverine scoffing him down with a pint of lager?) and four years pass with absolutely nothing happening. Fable is ready to fight King Darkn, the lord of all bad guys, and is apparently only able to do this because he’s raided a museum and stolen thousand of helmets. Fable defeats Darkn (but doesn’t kill him apparently) and goes home. When he gets home, he notices that his sword has broken and that he can never fight any more. Now, most people would trot over to the nearest blacksmith and ask for a) a new sword or b) for the broken one to be reforged. Of course, most people would bloody notice that their sword has broken. I doubt it broke in the sheath, so it must have broken in the fight. Compare with Marek (my PC Hero). When his sword shatters in a fight with Jack of Blades, he rightly believes that he is totally, utterly screwed. Anyway, that’s the end of the fic, sort of. The final sentence is incomplete.<br><br>A Little Snippet of Hell:<br><br>A girl met him one day and they both liksed each other and they had a child but the evil men killed it as well and Fable was ever angrierer. &quot;I MUST GET REVENGE FOR HIM KILLED FAMILY&quot;! And he trianed with his master again until it was dead by the evil men too. so Fable was all alone until he me t another.<br><br>Website Address: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4363234/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4363234/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4363234/1/</a></a><br><br>Please let me murder this fic. The troll too, if possible. Now the Eragon fic: How ERAGON SHULD HAVE BEN.<br><br>Author’s Summary: This is how Eragon SHOULD have ben wroten by Christofer Palini. he culd lern a lot and be a better lo writer, i hope he sees this an maks brisenger good ADDED: WiTH A LEMON! ERAGON/ARIA ; <br><br>Actual Story: *eye twitches* Ex… excuse me. I need to lay down and die. I think that even My Immortal is better than this is. I have to say, if this were written by a decent author, some parts would be a fairly good Paolini spoof. However, the rest of it is insane. It’s a crossover with Pokйmon, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and probably a few other fandoms that I couldn’t identify. Worryingly, the troll feels the need to state that his/her fic is ‘A screaming meeme story by me’. The only possible explanation is that he/she realised that they spelt their own penname wrong and, instead of correcting it, decided to add a needless clarification onto the end. We start with Eragon’s dream. Eragon clearly snorted crack before going to sleep. He dreams of singing trees.

            <p>Cassie and Nat are both competent with swords, and are fair to middling archers.<br><br>Tyler, while a recruit from the LOTR continuum, is currently far better with electronics than weapons (as he had no experience with any in his home fic). I&#39;d suggest making him just tag along with either a pair of Agents or a partnerless one so they can exorcise together.

She&#39;s an excellent exorciser (rather over-enthusiastic - she tends to leave book-shaped bruises), and can poison monstrosities if pushed, but she&#39;s much too weak-stomached for blood - as you saw in my mission (thanks again for beta-ing). <br><br>Iza&#39;s probably useless for anything except herding Talking Beasts around.

            <p>But doesn&#39;t the Animorphs have something to do with aliens? Or am I thinking of a similiar fandom? Because if they do have aliens in, Terran is what I always call humans from Earth in my sci-fi fics. Earthlings is a horrid title, so Terran makes us seem to fit in slightly better among the Romulans and the Wookiees and the Wraith.</p>

            <p>IIRC Animorphs is about a group of human teenagers who acquire the ability to transform into animals from an alien, who needs their help to fight other aliens.<br><br>Terran is a better word than Earthling, I agree. Unless I&#39;m writing an SG-1 fic, then I&#39;ll use Tau&#39;ri instead.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think many Talking Animals can reach escape velocity.

            <p>I congratulate you on that one, actually. It&#39;s good to know I&#39;m not the only one in that club. Then again, I&#39;m still in High School...<br><br>Now, would Aslan&#39;s Country count as being in Narnia? I&#39;m pretty sure it wouldn&#39;t, since it&#39;s the equivelant to Heaven, but the Pevensie Children were able to get there in Voyage of the Dawn Treader.</p>

            <p>Personally I would count it, yes, but I think that, for the problem you&#39;re facing, you could count on Aslan himself containing the problem within the mundane &#39;shadowlands&#39; of non-heaven Narnia. I think that in VotDT, Aslan allowed them to get close, and cross the border, so to speak.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got a fanfic coming up and I&#39;m insanely stuck on one plot point. Ginny&#39;s died in childbirth and Harry&#39;s screwing up at his job because of it. He needs to put someone in mortal danger, so that limits the job to one of two things: Auror or Healer. Which one? I&#39;ve got the Healer plot pretty much worked out, but the Auror one is stuck. I can&#39;t think of how he could place someone in true danger due to carelessness. As a Healer, it&#39;s easy. Give the wrong treatment and make it worse, though I haven&#39;t decided whether or not to kill the patient. That might cause more things to resolve than I want to deal with in a one-shot. Maybe a spin-off?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s really up to you. Here&#39;s some possibilities:<br><br>1) On a recon mission to check out a new wizard / witch who MIGHT be a new Dark Lord / Lady (There have been several).<br><br>2) On a mission where the existance of magic is at stake. Because of Harry&#39;s blunder, he might need to use magic to save someone in front of Muggles, or a TV Crew.<br><br>3)Escorting someone to Azkaban. They fight back, and manage to get a wand from someone.<br><br>Any of those sound possible?</p>

            <p>&quot;There have been several&quot;<br><br>Do you mean in Canon or bad fanfiction?

            <p>I can&#39;t tell you exactly how many Dark Lords, but from what J.K Rowling implies, one &#39;Rises&#39; eveyr hundred years or so. The one before Voldemort was Grindelwald. Other than that, maybe one of the Harry fanatics could help.<br><br>And it&#39;s really up to you. Haivng Harry as an Auror would allow you to write a fight scene, so if you&#39;re good with description and mental images, go that way. Harry as a Healer would require a lot more intellect in the writing, so you&#39;d need to do a bit of research if you&#39;re mention specific medicinal herbs and things.

            <p>&quot;The one before Voldemort was Grindelwald.&quot;<br><br>A bit hard not to notice that, what with him being a main plot point in DH.<br><br>&quot;Haivng Harry as an Auror would allow you to write a fight scene, so if you&#39;re good with description and mental images, go that way.&quot;<br><br>I am good with fight scenes (or so I&#39;ve been told), but I was sort of hoping to have something different. Harry&#39;s always an Auror (probably because of the careers meeting), but I think that he&#39;d be slightly cautious about working for the Ministry after the amount they&#39;ve messed him around. Therefore, I sort of wanted him to be a Healer just for a change of pace. However, my Healer plot just totally collapsed when I spotted a plothole. I&#39;m still trying to make it work, but I&#39;m probably going to have to go for the Auror plot.</p>

But she has eyes for only one and the other is planning his revenge out of Jealousy. it does have scenes from Harry Potter but not that many. Rated T or now i might add a few bi<br><br>My summary: Narnia/Potterverse crossover - Hermione is randomly wandering through a tiny town that both Narnia and the wizarding world are constantly fighting over, for no apparent reason, and without the general population knowing about it. She&#39;s captured by Caspian, who calls her &quot;doll face&quot; (!) and practically announces that he&#39;s going to rape her. She&#39;s thrown to Peter, who is overly Sweet and Gentle, but Ed informs us that his brother is just as likely to use her as a sex slave. <br>On the up side, grammar and spelling are decent, and it&#39;s only one chapter.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4408807/1/">Princess of Narnia</a> by Kat-Princess-Kitty reviews <br>While riding in the forest Caspian comes across a hot tempered Princess who he later finds out is staying at his castle. With personalities that collide will love blossom or will they just end up annoying each other. Caspian/OC<br><br>My summary: She&#39;s Princess of Narnia at the same time as Caspian, Peter and the others are soverign Kings, but they&#39;ve never met. Very likely. She rides a unicorn called Amethyst. We also have the centaur &quot;Orious&quot; - if she meant <i>Oreius</i>, he should be thirteen centuries dead. <br><br>Sample: <br>(Generic forest-encounter-with-nameless-person-who-turns-out-to-be-a-prince scene)<br><br><i>&quot;I’m not going to hurt you&quot; he said in his Hispanic accent.<br><br>Alyssa tensed as his eyes met her own.

They throw her a birthday party, she is made a Knight of Narnia and fights battles, then throws a tantrum when Peter asks her to stay out of a war and runs off to play Eowyn.  <br><br>Sample: <br><i>“Well anyway, I guess you are probably wondering where on earth you are.” Kate looked at him like he was an idiot and he grinned, “I thought so, well you see … your not in England anymore. You are from England? Aren’t you?” Kate raised her eyebrows and said sharply, “Of course I am from England and what the hell do you mean we aren’t there anymore.” At this point the young girl chimed in, saying, “You are in a different world entirely! This is Narnia a land of talking beasts and magic beyond your wildest dreams.” </i></p>

            <p>Yay for the temporary internet folder. Though it does fill an unfair amount of my hard drive, it is good for finding things back. Here you are: <br><br>~<br><br>Hermione was wondering around in the streets of a small village called Freeromers, looking around, in the shops and restaurants. They sold unusual objects (and food), things that Hermione had never seen or even read about (and this was saying something). She even saw a shop that sold swords and shields.<br><br><i>Strange,</i> she thought to herself. <i>Who buys swords and shields nowadays in the muggle or wizarding world?</i><br><br>But what she had found stranger was that there were creatures that she had read about, but never actually seen. There were Fauns, Minotaurs, Cyclopes, Giants and talking animals walking carefree in the streets. She even saw Centaurs trotting about, chatting with some of the giants, which Hermione found quite alarming, being used to the now vicious herd in the Forbidden Forest.<br><br>Despite her being the brightest witch her age, she had no idea that this town was where the wizarding world and another magical world met. If you carried on walking through it, you would end up in a world called Narnia. The wizarding world and Narnia have been fighting over this town since it was discovered, but attacks were so frequent and the village so tiny, that nobody bothered to write about it.<br><br>Hermione had just entered a bookshop at the edge of the town when she heard a horn being blown. Everyone rushed around in panic, but to her astonishment, they all came back and lined up at the border of the town, everyone carrying a weapon of some sort, swords, bow and arrows, axes. She even saw some of the inhabitants pull out their wands, ready to fight, but against whom, Hermione didn’t know.<br><br>She approached the window, about to pull her own wand out, when she felt a hand snake across her right cheek and close on her mouth, preventing her from making any noise and another one, creeping over her flat stomach, pinning her arms to her sides.<br><br>“Don’t worry, doll face,” whispered a male voice with a Spanish accent in her ear, making her shiver in disgust. “I won’t hurt you, if you please me.”<br><br>Hermione closed her eyes in fear as unwelcome images formed in her head. With her arms pinned to her sides by the Spanish stranger, she was unable to reach her wand. She was defenceless and at the mercy of a stranger. It was worse than facing the Death Eaters; at least she knew what she was up against and could defend herself.<br><br>“Caspian!” called an English voice curtly. The Spaniard sighed with frustration.<br><br>“What do you want, <i>Peter</i>?” The Spaniard who Hermione assumed was Caspian replied, saying the last word in a mocking tone.<br><br>“We’ve won the battle,” the English answered, not at all put out by the boys’ tone. “What are your orders?”<br><br>“You’re High King, you give the orders.” Caspian replied rudely, pulling Hermione closer to him, resting his chin on her head, as he looked out the window his back facing Peter. The girl squirmed by he held her tighter.<br><br>“You ordered this battle for this village. You’re in command.” Peter retorted.<br><br>“Fine.” Caspian turned around; hand still clasped over Hermione’s mouth whose eyes were wide with fear and walked out the door after he had pushed Hermione into the chest of a blonde haired boy who she assumed was High King Peter. Peter caught her as she stumbled and almost fell to the floor.<br><br>“Don’t forget to disarm her!” shouted Caspian in a haughty voice.<br><br>Peter sighed and muttered:<br><br>“Git.”<br><br>Hermione smiled weakly despite the situation.<br><br>“You okay?” Peter asked, concerned. Hermione nodded her head though she shivered when she thought about what Caspian had said: “<i>I won’t hurt you, if you please me.</i>” What had he meant? She went pale and shivered at the thoughts running throw her head.<br><br>“What’s your name?” asked Peter, softly, knowing Caspian would’ve of probably said things, none too reassuring. She didn’t answer. He sighed and asked her for her wand. She seemed surprised that he knew she was a witch, but handed over her wand, though with great reluctance.<br><br>“Ed,” Peter turned towards a younger boy with dark hair, “take her to my tent for the time being. I’ve gotta check on Caspian before he does something stupid.”<br><br>Peter walked out, leaving Hermione and this Ed alone. Hermione tried to figure out want was going on. Peter had said ‘battle’ and ‘orders’. Was there a war going on here? And to his <i>tent</i>? Oh well, better his than Caspian’s. Not that she had much of a choice.<br><br>“C’mon,” said the boy. Hermione didn’t move. The boy sighed. “If you want to stay here, fine. But Caspian will be back and you’ll end up regretting you decision. Trust me.”<br><br>“Never trust anyone who says ‘trust me’.” Hermione couldn’t help herself. She wasn’t going to change her ways because she happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><br><i>What am I doing in this town anyway?</i> She cursed herself. She had planned to head straight to Australia to find her parents, now that Muggles were safe in the wizarding as Voldemort no longer lived.<br><br>“Well, you don’t have much choice, anyway.” Ed interrupted her thoughts. It’s either Peter or Caspian. Personally, I recommend Peter, not because he’s my brother or anything, but Caspian has quite a reputation when it comes to women and he’s only 18.”<br><br>“Okay, okay. Stop there!”<br><br>Ed led her out of the village and towards a ring of tents that circled a great fire. He marched up to a scarlet tent with the head of a lion drawn on it. It reminded Hermione of Gryffindor and she felt a little more at ease. He opened the ‘door’ for her and let her in first. She obliged with a slight look of surprise on her face.<br><br><i>And they say chivalry’s dead.</i><br><br>“Please don’t try to run away,” said the dark haired boy. “Cause you will be caught and we’ll have to bring you back in here and tie you up. If you’re lucky. And it will be wise to stay in the tent until Peter comes back.”<br><br>Hermione took a look around the tent. It was quite large, with the sun shining through the canvas; it cast a red glow around the room.<br><br>The tent was filled of interesting objects. He found a small stack of books near the bed, behind them, a small rag doll looking like Caspian with pins stuck in it. Hermione chuckled at the sight of it and opened a book.<br><br>After a few minutes, she realised what she was doing in the tent. She was a prisoner of war.<br></p>

            <p>Explanation: The Movie (as I prefer to capitalise it) is a retelling of the 2008 Mary-Sues Invasion, which was originally told via RP.<br><br>The idea to make it into a movie was the result of a chat between Trojanhorse and myself. The two of us asked if anyone would be interested, and on receiving a huge number of enthusiastic replies, set about actually trying to come up with a workable idea. Technically, I think she and I are the co-producers or directors or something of that nature.<br><br>Therefore. Live-action was, for obvious reasons, out of the question. So we decided it should be an animated movie. We have several talented artists and animators who volunteered (and a few who were hunted down and begged politely to help).<br><br>At the moment, scripting and casting is nominally completed, and instructions on recording lines are being put together. As this is a global operation, we&#39;re asking people to record their lines and send them to us- I believe Trojie volunteered to collect them, as she knows more about the technical stuff than I do.<br><br>If there are any other questions you&#39;d like to ask, please don&#39;t hesitate.</p>

            <p>Sounds good. If I actually knew that the Sues had invaded. I&#39;ve got to find out where these fics are. How exactly are you going to distribute this?
