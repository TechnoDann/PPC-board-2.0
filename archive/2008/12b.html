            <p>All you really need to do is start it. There used to be a rule where you had to ask Miss Cam for permission, so it&#39;s a good idea to send her an email mentioning it, but I think you just have to give her credit. Co-writers make it even more fun for me but that&#39;s a personal choice. Other than that, just go ahead and do it! <br><br><br>And <i>sure</i> it&#39;s just hypothetical. Sure.</p>

            <p>The first step would be to ask permission. I&#39;m not sure if Miss Cam is still the one to go to, but I&#39;m quite sure there&#39;s someone who should at least be notified. <br><br>Hoop #2 would probably be getting a co-author, but that&#39;s not necessary, only really helpful. <br><br>Hoop #3 would be telling us what fandom this is for. ;p</p>

            <p>Pay no heed to the minis behind me. <br><br>Hoop 1 is mostly what I&#39;m concerned with - as far as I can tell, Miss Cam hasn&#39;t shown up in... a while.

            <p>I need a beta reader for the second chapter of one of my stories as Sedri, who did the first chapter, is unavailable. It&#39;s a time-travelling Harry Potter story. It does have a few out of fandom elements later on (sequels are Stargate crossovers), but very little so far apart from the inclusion of a random unnamed character who&#39;ll appear again later. The chapter is twenty pages long and you can find the first chapter here: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4338634/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Correcting_of_Past_Mistakes"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4338634/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Correcting_of_Past_Mistakes">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4338634/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Correcting_of_Past_Mistakes</a></a><br><br>If you want to beta read, email me at the<em>jade</em><a href="mailto:falcon@hotmail.co.uk">falcon@hotmail.co.uk</a><br><br>Thanks in advance,<br>Jade</p>

            <p>Sorry, I forgot to mention something. I&#39;m trying to get it out before either Christmas or January 4th (my birthday). It&#39;s not vital, but I thought it&#39;d be a gift to my readers. If you can get it done before either of those dates, thanks.

            <p>That&#39;s a lot of Quizilla badfic. Gollum is very much not goblinlike, thank you very much. If I remember correctly, goblins are another type of Orc, and as we all know, Gollum was a corrupted proto-hobbit. And the &#39;middel earth madness&#39; one was just annoying. Seriously, it looks like it was run through this <a href="http://ssshotaru.homestead.com/files/aolertranslator.html"><a href="http://ssshotaru.homestead.com/files/aolertranslator.html">http://ssshotaru.homestead.com/files/aolertranslator.html</a></a> before it was published. I wonder why Suethors find it so hard to learn basic grammar skills. Honestly. This stuff is taught in elementary, it&#39;s a wonder they weren&#39;t held back for years...</p>

            <p>Would be one agent first person and another agent third or second person.  The point is that the reader is the actual agent.  This would be a massive undertaking.<br><br>I would personaly start off the adventure with a recrutment of the main character (they can always ignor the summons, but that would be a very short story) and have them just thrown into the middle of a mission with no training, much more entertaining.<br><br>Hope this helps!<br><br>L</p>

            <p>Spellsinger is pretty obscure, so some explanation will be necessary. For those that don&#39;t know, it&#39;s the continuum briefly referenced in &quot;Martin&#39;s First Time&quot; which Laburnum got so mad about during the MST (the line about Mudge the otter and the &quot;f***ing unicorn&quot;). It&#39;s about a human college student named Jonathan Thomas Meriweather who is transported into a weird alternate universe inhabited by talking animals - sort of like Narnia but with rock music replacing the Christianity and the animals all use a lot more bad language. Jon-Tom, as he becomes known, discovers he has the power of a spellsinger, which means he can work magic through music as long as he picks the right lyrics.<br><br>My question is, if an agent with some musical talent went into the Spellsinger continuum for whatever reason, could they develop spellsinging powers? If they could, would those powers remain when they went back to HQ? Since Tawaki&#39;s character developed permanent Bloodwrath from taking the form of a badger during a mission and mine developed it from putting it down on the OFUR form during her student days (gotta write about them some time) I&#39;d guess it would, but would they have to specifically put &quot;spellsinger&quot; into the Disguise Generator for it to start up in the first place?<br><br>And if they did, would it be too close to a Sue or Stu power? I think the inconvenience of having to pick exactly the right song and the ease with which it can go wrong, and the fact that s/he&#39;d probably never be able to play and sing at the same time without causing weird effects again would outweigh the coolness, but I think I&#39;d better ask. I might not do this anyway but I thought I should work out the specifics in case I did want to use it.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a while since I read those books, and I know I missed at least one later in the series, so this is not a fully-informed opinion.<br><br>My impression was that it takes three things to be a spellsinger - musical talent, a magical instrument, and what I&#39;m going to call a magic-resonance; I seem to recall other, non-singing spellcasters. (To be a <i>good</i> spellsinger, of course, you need improvisational talent and/or a good supply of songs.)<br><br>So it seems to me that the agent in question would need to not only have musical talent, but also some magical ability, plus get ahold of one of the incredibly rare instruments that can handle magimusic.<br><br>As far as permanence, remember that in one of the books Jon-Tom&#39;s duar got broken, so he couldn&#39;t sing up anything until he got a replacement (and then a repair). Since it would be Severely Frowned Upon to take such a rare thing out of the source canon, and the Flowers aren&#39;t likely to supply Agents with magical instruments, it&#39;d be pretty moot.<br><br>As far as Suvianity, let us again consider the source material. Due to being a fairly ordinary rock-interested college student, once he gets his duar he is able to get pretty close to the result he wants every time. Sure, it&#39;s never exactly right, and there are some side effects (&quot;first mate, he got drunk&quot;, for instance), but it seems excessive to me.<br><br>-Kd7sov, who is by no means an authority person, and who rambles too much.</p>

            <p>The character I was thinking of doing this with is already a good musician (legitimately so, not Sue-type) and in possession of an instrument which isn&#39;t <i>exactly</i> magical because his home continuum doesn&#39;t have &quot;magic&quot; but it seems to be very attuned - excuse pun - to him. (His original author did a ficlet showing him after death, finding his instrument also in the afterlife after it was destroyed because he&#39;d put so much of himself into it.) If he did gain spellsinging abilities, he&#39;d resent them deeply because it&#39;d mean he could never simultaneously play and sing without causing weird side effects - for that matter, only singing or only playing also has weird side effects for a spellsinger because it attracts the gneechees.<br><br>I think I&#39;ll not give them to him under normal circumstances, but maybe during the Designated Yearly Emergency of the OFUR when reality is stretched wildly out of shape and the characters figure out a way to tap into it ...</p>

            <p>It may depend on the continuum. There&#39;s a precedent that you can&#39;t become a wizard just by entering the Harry Potter continuum, for example, though I think people have ignored this one. Generally, though, they have to use wands made by HFA or Makes-Things, which may come with a wizard disguise.<br><br>It sounds like this canon allows for extra-dimensional people to gain powers by showing up, though, so it could work in this case.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m a music-lover and it sounds like fun. That said, you might want to wait for other people to weigh in before making a decision. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>One thing this isn&#39;t for me is surprising. While America has its (quite large, mind you) share of good people, among which I can count the American Boarders (Thank whatever God may exist for that), there are also ignorant bigots (fools that they are) in the country; the government officials who are proposing a ban on gay marriage and the people who Didn&#39;t Do the Research regarding videogames and Real World violence (just so you know, surges in the popularity of violent videogames coincided with the drastic lowering of crime rates in the country, <i>especially</i> in the case of Grand Theft Auto) are just two examples. With these types of people in the country, not to mention the Just Plain Stupid people who obtained power *coughGeorgeBushagaincough*, something like this was practically bound to happen. Sad, but true. Just my two cents.<br><br>Now, it&#39;s 1 in the morning here as I post this... Just needed to get that in.</p>

            <p>I mean really. They seized his <i>entire manga collection</i> -which I sincerely doubt was all hentai- when they were only charging him for part of it? Two adult men having sex in manga format is obscene and illegal (even though it was for private use)? Guys, I have enough stuff on my computer like that to get me arrested if that&#39;s the case. I mean, even if they thought the characters were children they only had to ask the guy to get an explanation (and God knows otaku love talking about their manga). <br><br>Anyone know what series he bought?

            <p>Are that if the manga were illigal, they should have not been alowed to cross customs.  The man should have been notified about the situation and the rest would have been sorted form there.  What is leagal in one country is not alway leagal in another (eg. marajawana and Belgium).  But allowing the man to accually get the manga and bring it home, that is against his rights.  There is no trade embargo between Japan and the United States.<br><br>And another thing, how would the man know that the manga was `obscene`?

            <p>That actually makes sense. Heh. In any case, my opinion is that the ruling that they are considered people is, frankly, quite ridiculous. I define a person as a living being with the capacity to make rational, uncontrolled thought. A fictional character thinks what the author wants them to think, and does what the author wants them to do. Fictional characters are puppets, whether depicted in text or imagery. If the characters were people, then ventriloquist dummies are, by extension, also people. And I say that&#39;s absolutely wrong.

            <p>... this whole thing is becoming a society-wide witch-hunt, and it sickens me because they&#39;re putting effort into this rather than helping actual children. We&#39;ve gotta do something, but I don&#39;t know what we could do which wouldn&#39;t make everyone assume we support real paedophiles or something because people are insanely dumb.<br><br>If you don&#39;t write or draw stuff which involves underage characters, you should be fine. I&#39;m a little worried about my &quot;Shadow Rapes Matthias&quot; MSTing, though - I didn&#39;t write the fic, but the fact that it&#39;s on my website, even for the purposes of being mocked, would be enough for some stupid people.</p>

            <p>Reminds me of a current plotline in a soap here - there&#39;s a girl who&#39;s just turned sixteen, who&#39;s been seeing her stepfather since she was twelve. The amount of people complaining that this is allowed to be aired, and that it&#39;s wrong, far outweighs the number of people saying &quot;wow, some realism in soap at last!&quot; But, y&#39;know, why the hell bother  fighting problems when you can attack symptoms and make it look like you&#39;re doing something?<br><br>Isn&#39;t the world a fun place?</p>

I&#39;m sure there&#39;s gotta be a petition or something we could start.<br><br>I know the problem. I&#39;d saved some badfics for potential sporking, but they featured graphic depiction of shota (any sane person would have classed it as &quot;depiction of child molestation&quot; but the ficcer wrote the brats as somehow being capable of informed consent, as they do. Sigh) and I&#39;d have cut that out in the sporking because it&#39;s gross, but I deleted them because I didn&#39;t want the things on my computer any more. And of course my computer history shows I&#39;ve read the sporkings of &quot;Little Miss Mary&quot; and the MST of &quot;Brightheart the Cub Sitter&quot; which did cut out most of the squicky bits but there&#39;s still enough there for it to be clear what was going on ...

            <p>I read a couple of webcomics which have, on occasion, featured underage nudity. Not graphic underage sex, but definitely hints. Is this likely to cause a problem? (The ones in question are <i>Jack</i> - the arc &quot;Suffer&quot; was about child abuse and showed a naked kid, nothing had happened but it was clear what would have happened if the main character hadn&#39;t burst in - <i>Gorgeous Princess Creamy Beamy</i> - the heroine&#39;s fifteen and there was a storyline set at the Japanese hot springs where she and a bunch of her classmates spent most of the arc nude, but not actually *doing* anything other than standing around - and <i>Concession</i> - the incident with Artie and Chelsie, again it was non-graphic but obvious what happened.) I wasn&#39;t aware of the law against drawn depictions of underage sexual conduct when I first read them, and it may not have been in force. I&#39;m also pretty sure the law is only against stuff designed specifically to be porn and &quot;lacking artistic merit&quot; - which is silly because how do you judge it? - and I just won&#39;t look at them again if it&#39;s a problem. They&#39;re all hosted in the US, so not subject to UK law.</p>

            <p>Reinette, a.k.a Madame de Pompadour, was featured in an early episode of season 2. Without getting into major details, the episode was written like a love story between her and the Doctor, though it doesn&#39;t work out in the end. I&#39;m not exactly sure why she&#39;s described as icky; the actress who plays Reinette is ridiculously good-looking, and I found her a witting and interesting character. However, I&#39;ve heard that certain 10/Rose fans bash her for getting in the way of their favorite ship--er, pairing, that is.<br><br>While I&#39;m no fan of 10/Donna myself, I kind of resent that she just dismisses people who do. If someone writes a good 10/Donna fic, I&#39;m willing to put up with it, even if it&#39;s not my cup of tea. It&#39;s rather difficult to get along in a fandom if you can&#39;t learn to agree to disagree.</p>

            <p>For a while the relation between the Doctor and the Master was in doubt, as in an earlier story the producers had intended to imply that the two were brothers. However, in Sound of Drums (NewWho, natch!), 10 explicitly says that the two were friends at school and not brothers.<br><br>And &quot;hate&quot; is a little too simplistic a word to describe their relationship, although it&#39;s probably an element...<br><br>By the way, what&#39;s with the &quot;for all we know River Song could be Jack after a sex change&quot; comment?

            <p>I&#39;m a Face of Boe girl myself. I figure, over millions and millions of years all sorts of things can happen. While Jack can&#39;t die, it doesn&#39;t mean that he can&#39;t physically change. Possibly it&#39;s an effect of the Time Vortex stuff. Perhaps as he gets older and older the Time Vortex starts to wear off, it starts doing weird things to his body... or else he becomes a giant head for the sake of life support or something. I know, I know, you&#39;d think that by the time he needed life support Jack would be ready to die, but wasn&#39;t Boe on life support in Gridlock?<br><br>Oh God--it just occurred to me that if Jack doesn&#39;t die eventually, he&#39;ll probably end up as a Toclafane.

            <p>They&#39;re the two scientists who collaborated with Pterry on the Science of the Discworld books, and believe me when I say that they do NOT need the professional novelist to make their book entertaining and readable.

            <p>I like <i>Wicked</i>. <br>Perhaps the author is simply very bad at writing fic, and so she does not make an attempt to write an interesting or funny fic, but takes refuge in really boring bull? I&#39;ve seen stuff like this before. Pinned up outside a fourth-grade classroom. </p>

            <p>Hey all. Yeah, I know I disappeared for a while, sorry, but it was for a good reason. I&#39;ve been really busy with real life stuff, especially school and wrestling, but I also shifted my focus to finishing the bios and writing sample so I could reapply for Permission. Now that those are finished, not only can I resume normal activity, but reapply.

I was making the site at two in the morning, I was exhausted, and my finger slipped. As far as I&#39;m aware, this is impossible to fix, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve tied it into an actual misspelling of the term on the RC&#39;s door in an attempt to make it into a running joke. Also, hS (I know you might not be the PG who sees this, but still, it&#39;s a general &quot;if you read this&quot; thing), if you have a google talk or are on Skype at some convenient time, I need to speak with you. I&#39;ve meant to issue a private apology (not just &quot;please don&#39;t smite me, Your Highness&quot; grovelling or whatever, but an actual, sincere, apology) for what happened during July&#39;s badfic reading, if possible and if you&#39;re willing to speak with me (I would not be surprised if you were not, but I hope you&#39;ll at least give me the chance to make up for it), but I just thought I&#39;d ask what time would be convenient.</p>

            <p>Bao-Dur&#39;s custom repulsor arm had the ability to break shields and emit electrical energy. It also amplified his strength significantly. That was a different kind of repulsor-powered arm though, and it was probably unique. Prosthetic arms can also carry weapons such as blasters, I think.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a couple factors involved...<br><br>Firstly, how much speed can the arm build up in the swing? Grevious-esque prosthetics would be at least human speed, and possibly a bit more (depending on how much he was using the Force), while Darth Vader-esque ones would probably be slower. We never really see Darth Vader move quickly... Initial speed translates into kinetic energy on the impact. Obviously, the harder the hit, the more impact damage (breaking bones, etc) is going to happen. Based on the movies (the only SW canon I&#39;m familiar with), I&#39;d guess it to be similar to a conventional human.<br><br>Second is follow-through. A large portion of the initial impact&#39;s energy dissipates as damage. Actually throwing people around happens in the follow-through, which is effectively a very short, fast shove. There&#39;s two things that affect the amount of energy that can be transfered - the weight of the cybernetic arm (a heavier arm will have more momentum, and deliver more shove at the cost of hitting power), and the strength and speed of the actuators (which can deliver something of a push during the contact time). Once again, guestimating from Episode 2 (where we see Grevious unable to overpower Obi-Wan), I would guess that Star Wars prosthetics aren&#39;t that much more powerful than regular humanity.<br><br>Finally, fist shape and strength. A blade will penetrate a skull deeply, while a brick-shaped fist with the same force could just crack it. Durability under impact loading is also important - if the fist deforms, it can enlarge the contact area, lessening the point load.<br><br>Fortunately for us, the human skull is very well designed. The average human, or even the average martial artist, really doesn&#39;t stand much of a chance to break it. Most martial art strikes to the head aim for softer targets - the nose, which is cartilage, and can be broken from the skull. Eyes. The temple is an interesting target because it&#39;s where a fairly major blood vessel enters the brain - a hard stroke to the temple can disrupt blood flow, without much risk of penetrating the skull itself. By far the easiest way to penetrate the skull is with a long, sharp object, delivering the maximum amount of impact energy to the smallest point possible. That much can be managed by a human with a good swing and a stiletto. A brute-force punch... For the vast majority of martial artists, there&#39;s no way a flat-fisted punch could really break a skull. Fractures would be the worst assumable injury.<br><br>As discussed above, I estimate Star Wars prosthetics to be similar to human strength and weight - the only real hope for a skull-breaking punch would be with a very non-human fist shape, or a swiss-army-knife stiletto attachment. Obviously, as they&#39;re mechanical things, one could build a massively powerful prosthetic arm, but see hS&#39;s comments concerning balance and leverage. There&#39;s also a weight problem - having a two hundred pound arm can be a real drag. (pun intended)</p>

            <p>That the makers of these arms would know what they&#39;re doing, and almost certainly would custom-make each limb for each user. Thus for Anakin, being a Jedi, they would have probably leaned towards something that is fast and flexible, rather than the brutishly strong, since that&#39;s how Jedi fight. Of course, from what I&#39;ve seen in the movie, it&#39;s pretty strong anyway. </p>

            <p>Of course, Grievous vs Obi Wan has certain differences from the situation I had in mind:<br>1.The target was a fairly powerful force sensitive, and they seem to be considerably tougher than the average individual. (Energy resistance, blunt force etc.)<br><br>2.Grievous was mostly droid, making losing the limb unlikely.<br><br>Still, Grievous did manage to break a Neimoidian&#39;s skull with a punch in the ROTS novel, showing that limbs are capable of that feat against at least some species...<br><br>Point taken on the other factors though. </p>

            <p>Ichigo and anyone who goes to school with him (who isn&#39;t a Shinigami/Vizard) are underage. For the Shinigami, Vizard and Arrancar it gets trickier, IMO. Do you go by physical age, in which case Yachiru, Hitsugaya, Wonderwyce and Hiyori are all counted as underaged, or do you go by actual age, in which case all Arrancar created less than twenty years ago are underaged?<br><br>Most writers ignore the ages of the characters in smut fic anyway, either by reminding their readers of character ages or by putting up a disclaimer that says that all characters have been aged to match the age of consent in whatever state the site server is hosted in.</p>

            <p>The author probably got reported for it, or they decided to take it down. In that case, it would probably be due to flames. Now, could you do me a favor and report a very bad Old Republic fic? I&#39;ve always liked the KotOR part of EU canon, and I need to imagine a particularly offensive &#39;Sue from there getting killed in horrible, horrible ways. Like getting the Force ripped from her then being... well... I&#39;ll think of something if the time comes. Preferably with poisoned kolto when she&#39;s being &#39;healed&#39; from whatever happens, just for fun.</p>

            <p>Because I&#39;m psychotic, I read the reviews to that fic. It <i>looks</i> like English, but the words make no sense.

            <p>Whatever happened to Diana? It occurred to me that if she is, to quote the fic, &quot;a sex fiend,&quot; and advises 17-year-old girls to have more sex than Agent Luxury and Jack Harkness combined, perhaps she might be willing to keep Lux...satisfied, shall we say. Well, if Diana swings that way. Just a thought, that&#39;s all.</p>

            <p>No, I can&#39;t recall anyone mentioning any vampire myths in <i>His Dark Materials</i>. I think the closest thing would be the Spectres, since in some real-world mythologies vampires, or rather the regional equivalents, steal life-force/chi/souls instead of blood.</p>

            <p>Okay, I have this unfortunate habit of seeing bad fanfiction and thinking ‘I can do better’. That usually leads to me at least plotting a story along the same lines, but fortunately that’s generally as far as it goes. For instance, I have a Hermione/Snape romance in the works. Well, on the drawing board, because I’m still really struggling to work it into Canonical parameters without Snape surviving the Battle of Hogwarts, which is fairly clichéd and illogical.<br><br>However, in my searches for sporkable material on AFF (pretty much everything I encountered) I found numerous stories were the females of Harry Potter are forced into sexual servitude for whatever reason… *sigh* Yeah, you can see where this is going, can’t you?<br><br>While quite a bit of me wants to forget I ever considered the idea, the other part wants to see what it would be like if everyone was in character (the women generally spread their legs eagerly and/or it’s Harry or the like doing the domination) and it was written by someone with knowledge of “consequences”, whatever they are.<br><br>So yeah, this fic is still in a state of extreme limbo. For a start, it’s the in character part that worries me. Rather sensibly, JKR didn’t introduce any serial rapists into her fandom (with the exception of Lockhart according to some). I’ve already ruled out Snape and Malfoy for being, if not good guys, definitely not bad guys. Crabbe and Goyle are a bit too thick to plan anything of the magnitude that this fic would entail. So that leaves Blaise Zabini or an OC. Yeah, sorry to focus on the Slytherins, but they seem to be the likely culprits (though if I have an OC, a Ravenclaw would also be acceptable due to their intelligence).<br><br>The woman/women in question (I’m likely to limit it only to one though, for my sanity if nothing else) is/are probably going to be Hermione, Ginny or, pushing it here, Luna. This is simply because they’re the most characterised and an OC would lose a lot of impact for this role.<br><br>Ideas would be appreciated, for both attacker and victim identity and also for ideas on how the attacker gets the victim to comply, however reluctantly. I’m thinking blackmail of some sort, because the attacker may not be kind enough/smart enough to use Obliviate. Finally, graphic or totally gloss over the sections in question? *<br><br>Of course, an overwhelmingly negative reaction will also be appreciated and may get this idea out of my head once and for all. Whatever your comments are, thanks in advance.<br><br>* What are the boundaries between M and NC-17 for sexual content on FF.net? And is sex the only factor separating the two? It’s never been very clearly explained and I’m personally not sure if the admins themselves have a standardised set of rules given some of the fics I’ve encountered on FF alone. And if I ever post sexual scenes, because I have a couple of major ones planned since they’re plot-critical, I want to know if I’m going to get kicked off for it or if I can be safe under M.</p>

            <p>I know just what you mean, because I have that same bad habit. Harry Potter isn&#39;t one of my fandoms, but I&#39;ll try my best to give decent advise anyways.<br><br>What I&#39;m really wondering here is what you mean by &quot;sexual servitude&quot;--do you mean consensual bondage, someone being pressured into sex, or flat out rape? If it&#39;s the last two, you <i>must</i> make it squicky and disturbing. I get the impression that people usually write these fics as a fantasy, so they try to make it all sexy. But in real life, something like this would be horrible and unhappy and really, really disgusting. Well, you probably know this already. But I thought I&#39;d say this just in case.<br><br>It&#39;s also worth considering what age these guys are. I generally squick out at underage fics that aren&#39;t &quot;first love/experiments/fumbling into adulthood&quot; sort of things. But more than a few teenage guys have drugged their girlfriend&#39;s glass in real life, so it&#39;s not inconcievable.<br><br>And leave out the filthy details. For one, we really, really, really don&#39;t need to see all the filthy and disgusting actions implied in such a situation. Also, by taking out the descriptions of sex, you leave everything up to the audience&#39;s imagination, which just ups the horror of the situation. And remember, in this story, you should be stressing the horror aspects.

            <p>&quot;do you mean consensual bondage, someone being pressured into sex, or flat out rape?&quot;<br><br>A mix of the last two usually. That&#39;s the one I&#39;m doing.<br><br>&quot;If it&#39;s the last two, you must make it squicky and disturbing. I get the impression that people usually write these fics as a fantasy, so they try to make it all sexy. But in real life, something like this would be horrible and unhappy and really, really disgusting.&quot;<br><br>Yeah, I know. I&#39;ve got this one fic (&quot;Harry Potter and the Shattered World&quot;) with a fairly graphic scene just to really rub it in that rape is not fun at all and if by any chance the victim orgasms, they won&#39;t actually want to and it will humiliate them further. And no, she won&#39;t in my fic.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s also worth considering what age these guys are.&quot;<br><br>I was thinking seventh year so that I don&#39;t get arrested and all that.<br><br>&quot;For one, we really, really, really don&#39;t need to see all the filthy and disgusting actions implied in such a situation.&quot;<br><br>Usually I&#39;d agree, but with Shattered World, I&#39;m putting it all in so that you <i>do</i> see it. Because maybe, by reading it, some authors may finally understand the true horror of rape. I direct you to Bottled Feelings on FF.net (another HP fic). Perfect example of an &quot;I&#39;ve been raped give me comfort sex&quot; fic.<br><br>&quot; Try focusing on the thought process of the predator and/or victim instead.&quot;<br><br>Victim is a given. I try not to focus on the predator because that might give the readers some form of pity, which I don&#39;t want. There&#39;s only one rapist in my stories who deserves pity and it wasn&#39;t for the rape itself, but the circumstances that he was caught in that led him to that moment (it&#39;s hard to explain without ruining the plot, but it does make sense).<br><br>&quot;If you must have them keep the situation a secret, give them a good emotional reason. A lot of people just come up with a wimpy excuse and move on.&quot;<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;m trying to come up with a good blackmail thing.<br><br>&quot;Remember, there&#39;s NOTHING WRONG with the authorities finding out about the predator in the end&quot;<br><br>In Shattered World, they find out at the beginning. Harry&#39;s daughter&#39;s rapes and the rest of the fic is finding out who did it while he tries to help her get through it all.<br><br>&quot;Alternatively, you might have the girl decide that she cannot tell anyone about this situation, and therefore must take care of the predator herself, which could lead to some sort of cat-and-mouse game...&quot;<br><br>Bits of that in Shattered, too.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m really getting a little too much into this, aren&#39;t I?&quot;<br><br>Not at all. You&#39;ve been very helpful so far.<br><br>&quot;I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that Ginny and Hermione are strong, smart girls. They&#39;re both very capable witches, they&#39;re both strong-minded, and they definitely wouldn&#39;t just lie down and take it. They&#39;d do something about the situation. Take out that struggle, and I think you&#39;d be leaving out a major part of their character.&quot;<br><br>Yeah, you see my problem. An OC wouldn&#39;t have the same impact as a character we know and love, but the Canon characters aren&#39;t weak and pathetic. All the females I can think of (Susan Bones, Luna Lovegood etc) were in Dumbledore&#39;s Army, which shows their character and their conviction.<br><br>Thanks very much for your response and for not calling the cyberpolice on me.</p>

            <p>Is it okay if I briefly use Katrina in my writing sample? I wanted to depict the Abhorsen&#39;s reaction to arriving at the PPC HQ and the way she was handling all the information being thrown at her. Since the last scene in your mission involved Katrina dragging the Abhorsen off while babbling stuff about the PPC, I thought I might include bits where she explains things like the difference between an OC and a Sue and the fact that Ancelstierre is, technically speaking, fictional. She wouldn&#39;t play a major part--just a few sentences or so. But I just want to make sure you&#39;re okay with her usage before I post my entry.<br></p>

I can put it back on my list, if you want.  Agent Glass (formerly) worked in the (now-defunct) English Classics Division of the DMS, so I&#39;ve been writing up old mission reports.

She&#39;s racked up over sixty, possibly seventy charges by my count, and needs a <b><i>slow, painful death</i></b>. Any suggestions that don&#39;t involve leaving the continuum or outright torture, seeing as we know HQ frowns on it?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m definitely in the camp of people who want to introduce her to a star.  Or... hmm.  Don&#39;t the Silmarils burn? Maybe you could introduce her to Varda, who could borrow Earendil&#39;s Silmaril for a moment. &#39;Cause, you know, Sue would be too dumb to let go of it and be burned.

            <p>I didn&#39;t actually read past the point where her &quot;heritage&quot; was revealed...  <br><br>Yup, the metal could be painted green.  It would be a Magical Mary-Sue Weapon, so for Glod&#39;s sake don&#39;t get in the way of it.  Steal it as soon as she puts it down or something.  I expect it&#39;ll either turn into a training lightsaber (as the not as powerful as a lightsaber descrip would suggest), cease to exist out of pure logic once she&#39;s dead (&quot;curved&quot; lightsaber beam + logic = poof!), or revert into an actual green-painted vibrosword.  While her influence is still around, it will, unfortunately behave as she describes, but as soon as she&#39;s dead...</p>
