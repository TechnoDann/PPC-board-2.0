            <p>But then I got distracted by studying, coursework, fanfiction and sleep. Three out of four and I would have been able to manage NaNoWriMo on top of everything else but staying awake forever just didn&#39;t work out. Besides, I lost interest in my idea and started writing about gay, blond pirates instead. It was much more fun.</p>

            <p>First up, sorry about that.  I should&#39;ve asked about it first.  I just… find it a little odd, with that number.<br><br>I had a couple of questions.  Um.  What would be the most appropriate way to deal with the longer series of video games?  Legend of Zelda can probably get away with one article, but I&#39;m a little less certain about the Final Fantasy series (for one thing, aside from the numbered, there&#39;s the Compilation, the various Tactics games, and I don&#39;t know much about XI aside from it being a MMORPG).  And then there&#39;s the Tyler-who&#39;s-not-in-MTFFAT-or-Reynolds.  I was thinking, would his (current) species designation be all right?</p>

            <p>Okay, so, this has been bothering me for a bit now, and since I just filled out the Transformers entry on the wiki, I&#39;m going to maybe-not-so-randomly ask this question here... <br><br>Would minis in the Transformers-verse(s) be, well, mini-Transformers? I&#39;ve been thinking that they could just be, like, the <i>toys</i>, or something. Only alive. Cuz that way they can still transform, which is kinda the point. And I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any nasty animals indigenous to the Transformers-verse(s) that could be used. Not to mention that they&#39;re ROBOTS, and I think they should stay that way... <br><br>The only problem with having mini-Transformers would be that, well, not all characters are giant robots, and I&#39;m not sure what misspelled human characters would be. I&#39;m thinking mini-hardhats, since it seems to be something of a recurring theme. <a href="http://transformers.wikia.com/wiki/Hard_hat"><a href="http://transformers.wikia.com/wiki/Hard_hat">http://transformers.wikia.com/wiki/Hard_hat</a></a> <br><br>So, would it be too much to have two mini species for one continuum? Or slew of continuums? I&#39;ve collected a number of the little buggers, and I&#39;d kinda like to know what I&#39;m dealing with here...<br><br>~Anjilly, who has a penchant for 80s cartoons, and who is also feeling slightly frazzled at the moment and thus apologizes for any flightiness inherent in this post.

            <p>1) Not many characters in Lord of the Rings are giant flaming demons, either. Doesn&#39;t stop them. :P Minis aren&#39;t supposed to be particularly similar in type to their canon character, I don&#39;t think.<br><br>2) You say there&#39;s no nasty animals, and okay, maybe not. But minis in general are minor canonical monsters, not a generic class which makes up most of the cast. I don&#39;t know Transformers, but is there a small group somewhere which you can make the model for the minis? Or a minor series with a distinct visual type? I don&#39;t know, obviously, but.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...So I&#39;m not very familiar with anything beyond the most popular of the many, many, MANY Transformers-related continua. And I&#39;m still getting acquainted with the ones that I AM familiar with. So while I could probably pull something out of the Japanese comics or one of their minor spinoffs, I haven&#39;t really gotten that far into the fandom yet... <br><br>At the same time, I just realized that the TF wiki does indeed have a (short) list of animal species. *headdesk* I&#39;m gonna go investigate it and see if there&#39;s anything nasty and dangerous enough to be a mini... Oh, who am I kidding, of course there will be. It&#39;s an adventure series aimed at ten-year-old boys, for goodness&#39; sake. XD <br><br>*plunges*</p>

            <p>I think I remember seeing the resurrection of students as a throwaway gag in the sequel to OFUM, but I don&#39;t know if that applies to other OFUs. Does it depend on whether the canon can bring people back from the dead? Would it be possible because, in OFUR, the students are not in their original bodies, so we can just put them in a new one if their current fursona form gets destroyed?</p>

            <p>Because one of the main themes of TRC is <i>not</i> bringing back the dead. One guy tried and apparently nearly ripped Time and Space itself apart. We&#39;re mainly avoiding the issue but I think in other worlds, if there&#39;s a canonical afterlife and such, the Headmaster&#39;s intervention  should be enough to bring them back.</p>

            <p>So I think we could do it.<br><br>Maybe during the Designated Yearly Emergency, whatever it is they use to bring the students back stops working for some reason?

            <p>Some of the oldbies probably remember you, but it might be best to hang around a bit more, so people get to know you again, before you ask. I went through something similar, and that seemed to be how it worked (then again, literally nobody remembered me, and a few seem to remember you :P). Anyway, it&#39;s good to have a previous member back, I hope you enjoy it here without all the real life hassle.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve officially changed my capitalization since last time I was here. Also I&#39;m now more into knitting than fandom. (Although my first knitting internet friend was an old PPC friend . . .)<br><br>But that&#39;s not the point of this post! While I&#39;m probably not coming back in any real sense of the word, I do have a 7-to-10-page paper of original research for a linguistics class that&#39;s due insanely soon. And I thought I might do something about the jargons of internet communities. And then I remembered how rich a jargon the PPC has. So I&#39;m thinking development of the PPC&#39;s vocabulary? I know, I know, the posts disappear off the bottom of the page, so it&#39;s hard to go back.<br><br>I did find you guys&#39;s wiki, and have been poking around there, but what I think I want to do is use the PPC as a specific case of the interaction of canon, general internet, general fandom, and community-specific vocabularies. So if anyone with a lot of time and/or links on their hands wants to point me to (say) that archive of the board somebody tried to do once, general fandom resources, or whatever, that would be super awesome. You guys rock my socks!<br><br>P.S. This is totally going to be one of those essays that is not, shall I say, 100% quality controlled. So whatever you got, I want!</p>

            <p>And that is doing interviews!<br><br>So, since I really have no idea what direction this paper is going to go in, just some general stuff for now:<br><br>For the oldbies: What are your memories of PPC vocabulary? Do you remember specific vocabulary creation events? Do you have something else awesome to say?<br><br>For the newbies: Do you find PPC conversations confusing? How do you cope with new terminology?<br><br>For everybody: How does the PPC compare to other internet communities you&#39;re a part of? Do you think you&#39;d be friends with fellow PPC&#39;ers in real life? Do you know people like your fellow PPC&#39;ers in real life?<br><br>It would be super awesome if you all responded to as many or as few of these as you felt like. a/s/l-type information, fandom history, PPC history, etc are also other options that would make my data collection even better.

            <p>Funny; I did something like this a few months go for my own university essay. I&#39;m glad to be able to help someone in return!<br><br>Female, twenty-one, living in New Zealand. I&#39;ve been here over a year but I don&#39;t think I yet count as an oldbie, so I&#39;ll just take the generic questions: <br><br><i>How does the PPC compare to other internet communities you&#39;re a part of?</i><br>Busier, and much more fun. Very lively. Many other communities, especially those that center around a particulr fandom, tend to fade out as people lose interest in that particular story. The PPC covers all stories, so when my favourite fandom changes, I can just write missions for the new one. :)<br><br><i>Do you think you&#39;d be friends with fellow PPC&#39;ers in real life?</i><br>I would say that I <i>am</i> friends with other PPCrs in Real Life, because even though we&#39;ve never met face-to-face, I&#39;ve spent time with Trojie and Pads and Ciri and July and... well, I won&#39;t bother to list them all. But I call them friends. We chat about a variety of subjects, sometimes very serious, lean on each other when upset and just... be friends.

            <p>Within my crossover, which many have probably heard me tlaking about at one point or another, eighteen individuals are granted powers that place them over many gods, but underneath the Universal Gods who created and control the Universe. Each of them, in addition to their mortal weaknesses and strengths, has absolute control over one element, and in the case of three of them, one element and the ability to warp the fabric of time and space.<br><br>My question is this: How do I make them seem powerful enough without it looking too overboard? An example would be one of them who can control energy (Think lasers, Harry Potter spells,etc) being capable of blocking the laser beam from the Second Death Star with her powers.<br><br>It just has me slightly confused, about how to impress it on the readers, but not overdo it.

            <p>And not realise it.<br><br>For instance, make the powers limited /strictly/ and /entirely/ to their element. So if you&#39;ve decided (say) liquid water is an element, great -- but heaven help the person if it&#39;s salt water, or heavy water, or frozen water. Similarly, you can tweak that energy control one. Specify types of energy, for instance -- ground it in physics, not vague concepts of energy. So, say, one has control over light energy -- which, on Star Wars lasers (which I understand are actually not laser-based, especially not the big ones, they&#39;re gaseous) it would have the effect of making the light deflect while the gas or whatever carries merrily on its way. Then, sure she can control light in every way -- but all that means is she can a) turn things invisible, b) blind people, c) make illusions, or d) make and manipulate lasers (real ones). The degree to which she can do this depends on her degree of skill.<br><br>Which is the other way to do it. Give them great powers, but no finesse. So she can divert that superlaser, but can&#39;t control /where/ she redirects it, because her thoughts are simply &quot;divert&quot; rather than &quot;divert by 75 degrees towards galactic north&quot; or wherever.<br><br>So. Very specific and rather picky limits, or great power and no skill. Those&#39;re my suggestions.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>They are each limited to a specific element, for example, the guy who controls water can do rain, fog, create lakes, etc, but he can&#39;t control ice, with limited control over steam. They are capable of pooling their abilities (Water guy and lightning guy combine powers to create thunder storms) but that&#39;s the limit.<br>The girl who controls energy specifically controls &#39;Aether&#39;, which I&#39;ve translated to mean magic mostly, with limited control over energy, as magic and energy are similar. Without her weapon, which is specifically designed by the Gods no less, she wouldn&#39;t stand a chance against the laser until years after she gained her powers. While they are given basic instructions on what they can and can&#39;t do with their powers, more powerful abilities must be developed by them alone, sorta reminscent of what would happen in an RP game.<br><br>While this sounds like it was set in stone, that was actually me musing to myself and turning musing into fan-canon.

            <p>While the Heroes of the story don&#39;t face many people on equal level with them when they are at full power, I have included ways that each of the 18 people can be weakened, reducing their power to half, or even a quarter, of what it should be. And since all the Chosen are humans, there are their normal weaknesses which can be taken advantage of.<br><br>The good guys lose quite frequently, now that I think of it. A large part of the story is dedicated to the efforts of Maleficent, controller of the Heartless, the bad guys, and her efforts to break up the group and control them, something she actually succeeds at.<br><br>And yes, these have also been included, things that can&#39;t be overcome. They can fix droughts, but they can&#39;t fix / manipulate death, emotions and, for the most part, free will. And to a certain extent, they can&#39;t even control their powers. On confrontation with Dementors in the Harry Potter world, their powers work automatically, regardless of the person&#39;s choice.<br><br>And the balance is something I&#39;ve been trying to figure out for a while too. The basic idea was to simply do the pair off thing, one evil guy for each good guy, but it felt too cliche. Their powers themselves weren&#39;t actually given to stop evil and dark powers, but rather to prevent the Universe returning to Nothing. Each of the 18 can be used as a Key to the Door to the Light, aka, Kingdom hearts, which acts as the Reset Button for the Universe, restoring areas which have been lost to the nothingness, and bringing back the people lost to the Nothingness as well. The 18 stand to represent Creation, to go against Nothing.<br><br>If it feels like I shot down each of your ideas, I hope I didn&#39;t. This actually really helped me realise how much planning I&#39;ve put into it, which seems to be a lot more thorough than I thought. And you&#39;ve really helped me define the limits too.

            <p>Here&#39;s a few ideas...<br><br>For one, you can have them doing things with their element that would have lesser elementals or wizards or mages or whatever in fits, and doing them easily, without thinking. Sorry, that&#39;s a little confusing; what I&#39;m getting at is that there&#39;s two ways of demonstrating the absolute control: through raw power, and through finesse. Finesse might be an easier way to do it. It helps if you have one of these lesser ones around to compare, or someone who&#39;s familiar with the lesser ones.<br><br>Another possibility is to show them keeping up (even if barely) with one of the gods, or a creature that is, in its home world, super-powerful. I&#39;m thinking Chernabog (sp?) from KH for some reason, dunno why.<br><br>Hmm... yeah, I&#39;m better at giving people awesome powers and making them half-useless. =P Hope I&#39;ve helped at least a little.<br><br>It occurs to me that I never did finish going through the chapters I have. If you still want me to, I can finish probably tomorrow... Sorry about that! It completely slipped my mind.</p>

            <p>The lesser wizards / mages in fits will actually happen. Since it is a crossover, it includes the world of Emelan, found in Tamora Pierce&#39;s &#39;Circle of Magic&#39; series. Magical rules in that world specifically state that messing with nature will rebound upon the user eventually, often killing them in the process.<br>In the world of Emelan, there is a woman called Sandrilene fa Toren, who, as well as being one of these 18 people, has the power to manipulate magic with her own, natural power. In the end, she combines the main 10 people that the story centres around, giving them the powers and abilities of the others. The sheer level of power they now wield essentially corrupts them, and they begin acting like vengeful gods, reworking the face of the planet to suit their personality, and dividing the world into territories. The things that the 10 do before they are combined are enough to make the average mage on that world twitch, but what happens afterwards would be nothing short of a miracle, even though the 10 become corrupted and ignore the reason why they have these powers in the first place.<br><br>And that is a good possibility. I&#39;ll take a think about that.<br>And I usually follow that pattern too, giving people awesome powers and making them useless. I sorta came to the realisation that these are epically powerful people, so stupid sorta has to be removed from the equation.<br><br>And that would be great Makari. I hadn&#39;t even remembered about those until you mentioned them. Like I said before, feel free to go through and do them whenever you&#39;d like.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a few days, but I thought I&#39;d drop you a congrats on your second mission. I&#39;m looking forward to reading it since Abhorsen&#39;s a personal fandom, unlike the Tales series.

            <p>Death by Keyship sounds fun, and the pre-glassing speech sounds like it would make a great addition. For the twins, maybe they could be knocked out and thrown to the Keelbugs? (Cut content; a Covenant race that floats around cutting corpses into pieces and taking them away for disposal) That, or the Covenant Stalkers (Also cut content; they sneak up to enemies and shred them, and look a bit like Zerglings. The idea behind them was moved to the much weaker and less aggressive Pure Flood Stalker Form.)<br><br>I was considering tying them to Regret&#39;s ship during the New Mombasa Slipspace jump, but there is a high chance of them disappearing through a plothole - Slipspace can make people inexplicably disappear.</p>

            <p>Yeah, but I was thinking about a more...canon disposal method. Sues would probably act like the crystal from First Strike: they&#39;d screw the Slipspace up badly enough to distort canon events. Besides, if you don&#39;t see the body...</p>

            <p>Now I&#39;m out of interesting-sounding established-canon Haloverse kills, besides NOVA bomb and very, very large amounts of needler spikes. There just aren&#39;t enough good non-Flood monsters in the Halo continuum; the deadliest ones, like the Stalker and the Drinol, were cut. Scarab gun is too fast for a killing... Maybe they could eat Grunt food until they died? That stuff is positively foul. That, or the needlers.</p>

            <p>Hey, I&#39;m officially reserving a couple of &#39;fics for as soon as I have a computer again, which should be just a coupla weeks.  Namely, the two Symphonia fics on the unclaimed list.  I have only recently been introduced to the joys of Symphonia, and I have one thing to say to the Suethors: LEAVE KRATOS ALONE.<br><br>Now, if there are others interested, I may be willing to do joint missions; currently I&#39;m asking Trojie and Pads to help with the slash one, but if others want to do those two with one of my two agents, then you&#39;re welcome to ask. I think I&#39;d like doing joint missions.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Lee</p>

            <p>I can offer up my three Agents. They&#39;re the original video gaming Agents, so they have a good stash of weapons from almost any game you can think of, from Halo to Legend of Zelda. Not so sure how well we&#39;d write joint missions, since I&#39;m in Australia and I assume you&#39;re an American, but we could give it a try eventually.<br>But anyways, weapons, power-ups and such are available from RC #1010</p>

            <p>Hey everyone, hope y&#39;all are doing well. Holiday season and all that. Hope this isn&#39;t a bother, but Sara and I just wanted to make a quick announcement. She and I have just got together, with help from a friend who we had both gone to for advice on the matter (much to our embarassment, they had apparently figured that a sledgehammer would work better when we had requested a scalpel, to be metaphorical about it), and in the excitement figured that an announcement might be in order. Again, I hope this doesn&#39;t bother you lot, and that you don&#39;t think of us as whoring for attention or anything, we just thought it was a good idea at the time. Best wishes for the holidays, everybody.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure the hunter guns are fuel rod cannon - heavy radiation and plasma burst weaponry, rather than goo.<br><br>In chapter 5 (looks like you co-wrote it with someone), it says &quot;six tanks, and a few warthogs flew over the hill on the other side of the hill.&quot; First off, I&#39;m pretty sure Scorpions don&#39;t fly - it&#39;s more of a lumbering crawl, or at least was in the original. Also, referencing multiple hills gets confusing very quickly - could something be added to identify them?<br><br>Per the bits of canon that I&#39;ve read (Fall of Reach, mostly), I didn&#39;t think that Spartan toughness was generally known, so saying &quot;The heavily armed troop transports were fast and maneuverable, and their plasma turrets were capable of killing even SPARTANs in a few shots&quot; doesn&#39;t seem reasonable, unless the character making the observation has prior experience in the area.<br><br>Technical nit-picking aside, it&#39;s very well written. The characters are believable, and I&#39;m definitely enjoying the descriptions of the navy action. The story is very much in the flavor of the Halo universe.<br><br>The story seems very unemotional at times, to the point of being almost clinical in its descriptions. It seems to spend more time discussing calibers and target areas than what the people involved are actually feeling.<br><br>Okay, one more technical nit-pick... The story mentions the <i>Benelux</i> (odd name - doesn&#39;t seem in-character for the universe) moving from low orbit to a geostationary orbit above Eva - that would suggest to me that Eva is equatorial, as otherwise, the <i>Benelux</i> would have to stand on her thrusters.<br><br>Geostationary orbit is also very, very high altitude - here on Earth, it&#39;s more than twice the equatorial circumference of the planet. Getting that high would make providing accurate orbital fire support difficult from the <i>Benelux</i> a bit difficult. While she could stand on her thrusters at a lower altitude, that quickly becomes a major power drain.</p>

            <p>I just read <i>all</i> of That Series in less than three hours. Now my brain hurts like all hell. I would tend to think think someone would need a mind of <i>titanium</i> to not be affected. Mind you, this is coming from someone who sat through C*l*b*i*n and most of Subjugation without feeling nauseated. My reaction to those consisted mainly of murderous intent and pure hatred for the authors. These are the only Legendary Badfics that have done anything to my stomach. Now I know never to read too many of these in a row ever again.</p>

            <p>Beauty and the Beast one was dumber than a Stegosaurus with a head injury. Interrogation of Leia read like a very incomplete and very dumb Choose your Own Adventure book. Teasetting Ron was just idiotic (and it&#39;s a second-person to boot), but at least it was short. I have yet to read the other, longer ones, but I&#39;ll find time to at some point. All in all, they were more stupid than squicky, especially for someone who <i>laughed</i> at parts of C*l*b*i*n and Subjugation (Not much, and mostly at the massively retarded bits, but it happened at least once).</p>

(Foxglove is the one who says all the things I wouldn&#39;t dare to say. Laburnum is the one who says all the things I&#39;d be too smart to say - see the time she cussed out the angry wolverine leader of a vermin horde in front of his followers, who, had she not been rescued, would have done something very similar to certain events in TS to her.

            <p>I finished both the original and the sequel. I also read &#39;Agony in Red&#39;, which was an attempt to make something more disturbing than that &#39;fic. All of this was more ridiculously stupid than it was squicky. The characters being tortured should be dead or at least somewhere very early in their &#39;fics, not in pain. No, scratch that. The right description is definitely &#39;dead&#39;, especially in the sequel - six hours in an airtight box filled with bodily waste at one point, apparently. Still, the torture descriptions managed to garner a &#39;mild nausea&#39; rating from me, a bit lower than all of That Series combined. Actually, the last chapter of the sequel was just <i>too</i> stupid to be particularly disgusting, and Agony in Red was just moronic.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s not even get into the spear thing, but a six-year-old could point out the anatomy fail there. And poor Pikkle. I realise one doesn&#39;t lose all that much blood from being raped, even several times in a row, but she actually says &quot;over a hundred&quot; times (I think - could be worse, there were four thousand Corpsemakers in total and she could have detailed ALL of them!) so, if we assume each one took two minutes (though I&#39;m probably being generous here, hehe) that&#39;s over three hours of constant pain and difficulty breathing since they were, um, utilising both appropriate apertures, so one would think he&#39;d at least have <i>passed out.</i><br><br>And at least Agony In Whatever Colour&#39;s author didn&#39;t claim to be a veterinarian!</p>

            <p>That must be uncomfortable for the animals. Vet from Hell, anyone? Oh, and that&#39;s exactly what I said about TS - they should all be dead after... err... <i>in the middle</i> of that kind of abuse. And four thousand? I don&#39;t remember *that*, but then again I haven&#39;t read any Redwall canon in a while. Pikkle should have died from the some-number-under-a-hundredth, actually. Poor hare. Most or all of the TS missions should have/should have had (depending on whether they&#39;re completed or not) a mention of &quot;Avaunt, necrophilia!&quot; in them.</p>

            <p>Nin volunteered for that one, but she&#39;s otherwise occupied right now. Going to hurt, though - it actually focuses on Tagg, with a brief cameo by Schizophrenic!Paedophile!Sawney. Sawney was about the only vermin leader who was actually a fairly decent guy before he went nuts, so Nin was pretty mad about that. Sadly we couldn&#39;t exorcise necrophilia which didn&#39;t actually explicitly occur, but it came pretty close. But it&#39;s bad enough, with the random incest and the paedo and the spur-of-the-moment orgies and the forced piss-drinking and the spear and the fact that she apparently doesn&#39;t realise that you can SEE people on the walltop of a fortified building particularly when it&#39;s besieged and there should be more than two defenders up there ...<br><br>Yeah, she said she&#39;s &quot;in training to be a veterinarian&quot; in the author&#39;s notes of Among The Roses. I don&#39;t know whether the author not knowing about the anatomy fail or just ignoring it in the name of getting off is creepier. The latter is probably better for society as a whole, though.<br><br>Have you seen her other works? The Lion King poem caused me physical pain. (As Nin said when we were discussing the mission via email; &quot;It&#39;s called &#39;Poetic Orgy&#39; and only one of those words is accurate.&quot;)<br><br>The irony is, I LIKE Redwall slashfic. Well, the non-graphic kind which does not involve physically impossible actions being perpetrated upon innocent characters. There&#39;s some gleeful fun in doing something the creator would disapprove of to something so cute and wholesome, but it still has to be written decently. And okay, Stormsong&#39;s death scene in the fic I borrowed him from was just as gruesome, but Snowspine was a better writer, it was far less detailed, and he actually got to DO things in the fic as a whole other than &quot;be in extreme pain&quot;.</p>

            <p>I want to read a good slashfic for once. It makes a nice change from all the crap floating around (I&#39;m looking - and pointing a Scarab Gun at - you, Subjugation, with the &#39;defiling Monty Python&#39; charge), so a link would be a Very Good Thing.<br><br>Oh, and I just read Among the Roses now. The prose in that one is very, very urple, and now I understand what that &#39;doesn&#39;t mean you s*** rainbows&#39; line was about. Didn&#39;t know it was part of That Series (Forgot to reread the Wiki page, I just clicked on all of the links that had the series name) - damn, now my badfic reading record is a bit off. I did read the poem, it was just plain stupid. I called BS on that one - Biological Impossibility is very, very common in Uoikih fics, but that one&#39;s particular offense was absolutely moronic.</p>

            <p>And yeah, thanks to the whole &quot;getting stuck on the other side of the Gate right before WWII breaks out&quot; thing at the end of the series/movie, there&#39;s PLENTY of Holocaust fics... I have nothing against how the writers ended the series at all, I actually think it was pretty brilliant. But all those stupid fics... I mean, I took a class on the Holocaust as an elective last year, and we really delved into the psychology of the whole thing. And ANGST ISN&#39;T POSSIBLE when you don&#39;t feel like a human being anymore. &gt;.<br>Besides, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reason for the Elrics to end up in a concentration camp. Sure, Ed&#39;s technically physically disabled, but I get the feeling he could hide it well thanks to the automail. Not to mention that they&#39;d probably <i>leave</i> Germany while hunting for the atom bomb, so... <br><br>[/rant] <br><br>Can&#39;t wait for the new series, either. Didn&#39;t know it&#39;d start that early, though... I thought it&#39;d be another year before dubs came out, and then they&#39;d play it on TV. Though I&#39;m in the US, so things could be a bit different... (You&#39;re in the UK, right? XD)</p>

            <p>One of those doesn&#39;t fit with the others. And I&#39;m not surprised at where WWII/Holocaust fics can pop up. I keep finding them all over Bleach, despite the characters being Japanese which opens up the Pacific theatre for them to get involved in never mind that most of the cast would have either been in Soul Society or not born at the time. /end rant.<br><br>I&#39;d like to see someone trying to put Ed and Al in a concentration camp. They wouldn&#39;t go easily, alchemy or no alchemy.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t clear? *checks back* No, I wasn&#39;t. I meant that it airs in Japan in April. I&#39;ve gotten into the habit of getting up early on Sunday morning to watch Gundam 00, which is the 5pm timeslot in Japan (8am in the UK currently), so if FMA is in that timeslot when 00 ends I know I&#39;ll be able to get up in time to watch it live via internet streams.</p>

            <p>if you think anime takes a long time to cross from Japan to America, think how much longer it would take to cross from America to the UK. We&#39;re lucky if we get something two years after it originally airs in Japan. <s>It&#39;s for this reason that I rely mainly on internet downloads to get anime.</s></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never thought about how long it&#39;d take anime to get to the UK, but in the My Little Pony collecting community, certain models/playsets never make it out of the US. It drives the foreign collectors crazy, cuz they usually wind up paying someone over here to buy and ship the items for them. <s>At the same time, there&#39;s been a number of European-only MLP releases that plenty of USA collectors would give up their firstborn to own...</s> <br><br>So I&#39;m not terribly surprised about anime taking so long. Still, that sucks.</p>

            <p>is let us know what the plotbunnies are. Though I think just following the guidelines we tend to follow when writing fanfic could help. You know, characterisation (which admittedly is easier with your own characters, just be consistent about it), basic spelling and grammar rules, things like that.</p>

            <p>One is about an empire, modeled on Byzantium* (knowledge of Byzantine Greek is necessary for this**.) I&#39;ve mostly focused what remaining creative prowess I have on the setting, so I don&#39;t have many characters. I only have ideas for the Hero and the Emperor:<br><br>The Hero is either a mercenary from the Divided Empire to the North (based on the Holy Roman Empire, in which case Medieval German and Slavic is needed as well)a kid from some peaceful province who finds out that he is the Chosen One, or a Half Elf.<br><br>The Emperor is a Combination of Basil II, Manuel Commenus, and Roy Greenhilt from Order of the Stick. He is your standard Reasonable Authority Figure, and is as Snarky as he is wise.<br><br>*I have not read Harry Turtledove&#39;s books in my life (availability reasons, oviously). I&#39;ve heard of his Videsoss series, but I developed the idea without thinking of it. <br><br>**Wikipedia can give me knowledge of Byzantime Customs, Government, Dress, Army, etc, etc if nessesary.<br><br>PS: Sorry for any errors in grammar.

This just goes to show that no matter how old you get, you will still make all sorts of silly mistakes.  Excuse me while I go bang my head against the wall a few times.</p>

            <p>I just joined recently, that&#39;s why. Have a Prinny suit anyway. If you don&#39;t know what it does, it increases all your stats by a large amount, but it makes you add &quot;-dood&quot; to the end of every sentence, like this, dood. Warning: Make sure you are not picked up and thrown while wearing one, as you may have to wait at the nearest Netherworld hospital to be resurrected from the explosion.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s only a real danger in the Disgaea-verse, where the thing&#39;s from. There, everyone can be picked up and thrown. i think even the biggest enemy in the game (well, the first, anyway) can be picked up, but I&#39;m not sure. Stat boosts from it go over 999 though, so it&#39;s still quite useful. Actually, in the game, the suits don&#39;t really cause you to explode like a normal prinny or look like one, but I&#39;ll just shrug that off as a programming limitation. Heh.</p>

            <p>Sadly, the only Redwall fanfiction I still have on my account on the pit is serious.  The first chapter is appalling though, and was written about three years before the rest of it.  All I can say to redeem myself, is the otter in that chapter dies in the next, and then it&#39;s all slightly ambiguous otters and vermins attacking Redwall from there on in.<br><br>Chocolate!

            <p>Here&#39;s an interesting question for you guys. I just wanna see what everyone else thinks.<br><br>Most everyone knows about how Blood Status is in Harry Potter, my question is, in Crossovers that introduce witches of different kinds (I.e.: Charmed Witches, or Witches of Eileanan), what would their Blood Status be? Would they be Pureblood, due to actually being the definition of witch, half-blood if they have mortal parents, Muggle born in some cases, or (the really boring scenario) in a genre of their own?<br>Assuming it was any of the first three, how would Lucius Malfoy react to, say, meeting Piper Halliwell?<br><br>Artic&#39;s thought for the month.</p>

            <p>They certainly wouldn&#39;t define <i>themselves</i> by HP terms, but HP characters might define them by what they know.  In the case of Piper, she&#39;s from an old witch family, but her father was mortal, so Lucius would probably consider her a halfblood.  </p>
