            <p>I mean, yes, I knew what the idea was, but seeing it in writing...it works quite nicely. It has some lovely moments that just made me smile--the note, the ending, that sort of thing--and I like how the focus was mainly placed on how the moments progressed. Basically: I like what you did with this idea :D It makes for a very short, very sweet story.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to voice a concern that I have, namely that we are slowly veering into SRS BSNS territory. I only really noticed this after what happened Little Miss Mary - and if you have read it, (I think mostly everyone has by now,) then you know exactly what I mean. It was an incredibly well thought out mission, and filled in some plotholes, but <i>my GOD</i> it got dark. I really, really don&#39;t want the PPC to be any darker than it already is, (if you think about it, it is already quite dark.) I can&#39;t be the only one thinking this, can I?</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t read Little Miss Mary, but I want to read it now. Thanks for piquing my interest.<br><br>But that is a good point. If the PPC loses sight of it&#39;s original intent, the entire point is lost. I&#39;ll have to keep this in mind when I write my stuff in the future. <br><br>Of course, a bit of dark humor and satire, maybe even downplaying the seriousness of otherwise serious situations is called for.<br><br>This is giving me ideas just sitting here writing this.

            <p>I probably coulda worded my post better.  More what I wanted to get across was that if too many people jump on Ixi and Dawn&#39;s wagon, which is a perfectly good wagon, as far as I&#39;m concerned, we have the <i>potential</i> to get really dark really fast. So this was mostly an attack of Orange can&#39;t word important things properly syndrome. It&#39;s an extension of Orange can&#39;t spell correctly syndrome. So sorry for causing a fuss, just wanted to get my opinion out there.</p>

            <p>So what you&#39;re saying is: &quot;Hey, this is cool and all--but let&#39;s not wallow in melodrama&quot;, right?<br><br>Which is... well, it&#39;s good advice. The PPC has potential to go sliding down a very boring and uncreative grimdark slope if we don&#39;t watch out. People do go nuts, and do die, and that&#39;s always been a part of the setting.<br><br>Here&#39;s how I see it: People in real life also go nuts and die, and we manage to live with it. Whether we die at age 75 after retiring from work at an auto factory, or whether we die at age 18, subjective age 143, after getting the wrong mission, we all die, and we all lose people we love. And yet we&#39;re not all walking around being sad all the time. We get on with our lives. We laugh, love, have children, tell stories, create art and learn new things.<br><br>My advice: A world with dark elements doesn&#39;t have to be a dark world. Just like we can find joy in a world where we know we&#39;ll lose our loved ones someday, our agents can laugh their socks off at the Mary Sue&#39;s detached emerald eyeballs perching on Jack Sparrow&#39;s shoulders even if they know the next mission could end their careers.<br><br>Let those dark elements stay, but handle them the way people in general handle the dark and scary parts of our real lives--each person, in his own way, finds a way to live a good life despite it all.</p>

            <p>Little Miss Mary was a *legendary*--I don&#39;t think it should be handled in a trivial manner! Besides which, it&#39;s a truly horrible story that trivializes pedophilia; I wouldn&#39;t want to treat it like an afternoon&#39;s entertainment.<br><br>I like it when missions get serious without being melodramatic, when agents fight real threats, when they get away by the skin of their teeth. I like a good fight scene or a well-planned ambush.<br><br>The PPC isn&#39;t as small a world as when it got started; it&#39;s not really just about laughing at badfic anymore. We&#39;re writing in a well-developed world now, and just like real people&#39;s lives get serious sometimes, our characters&#39; lives will get serious sometimes.<br><br>We&#39;ve moved from Bilbo chanting rhymes at Mirkwood spiders, to Sam facing down Shelob with a frying pan. That&#39;s the way things happen when a world gets bigger.<br><br>If you want to write humorous stories, write them. Let others write their more serious stories. PPC writers should be free to write whatever they want, as long as it&#39;s good writing, as long as it doesn&#39;t infringe on someone else&#39;s story or change the way the PPC and HQ work.<br><br>We&#39;ve banned Emergencies partly for precisely that reason: Because we don&#39;t want one writer to declare that something they write about must happen to everyone, and pull others into their serious story. So someone else writing a story in which an agent deals with a real threat, by no means keeps you from writing a story in which the worst threat is from snorting Bleepka out your nose while laughing at the badfic.<br><br>If you want the PPC to be more light-hearted, you write light-hearted stories. There&#39;s no need to dictate what other people do with their own agents, within the bounds of non-melodramatic good writing. With such a huge variety of writers doing their thing, we&#39;re going to have a huge variety of tones. Unlike a multi-author published series, we don&#39;t have to worry about keeping the tone the same for each installment. Because we don&#39;t have to be homogeneous about our writing, we can have a serious, hard-fought battle with a Warrior!Sue in one story, and still have the next one be a light-hearted story about a couple of agents trying to cope with cat disguise in a Warriors fic.<br><br>I know that the people who lived through the Emergencies and their accompanying problems might be wary of serious stories, but please, trust me, this isn&#39;t the same thing! No one is keeping you from writing what you want, and if they did, all of the Board would call them out on it. Our agents experience the PPC in their own ways. Just like a light-hearted mission can&#39;t prevent others from writing serious ones, a serious mission can&#39;t prevent others from writing light-hearted ones.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m very much torn on this, which is why I haven&#39;t responded to this thread before now. Whenever I went to write something, I would see another aspect of the debate that I hadn&#39;t considered. What finally sold me was this: <br><br><i>We&#39;ve moved from Bilbo chanting rhymes at Mirkwood spiders, to Sam facing down Shelob with a frying pan. That&#39;s the way things happen when a world gets bigger.</i><br><br>The PPC is a world unto itself. It&#39;s no longer just a tool for poking fun at bad fanfiction.<br><br>I like serious PPC stories when they&#39;re done right. I like seeing these characters deal with heavy issues. Goodness knows I&#39;ve got a few drafts concerned with those kind of things (although after this, I believe they will be delayed even more than they already were).<br><br>That being said, I still have some qualms. Mostly, I&#39;m worried that people are confusing &quot;serious&quot; with &quot;spectacle.&quot; Everything&#39;s been big and dramatic. Yes, I know that LMM is a Legendary badfic and should be treated as such, but I feel like this phenomenon is not confined to merely that story. I can recall reading only one recent story that I would consider to be quiet and serious (Nesh and Ixi&#39;s collab, to be specific). I would very much like to see those kind of stories as opposed to their big and loud compatriots.<br><br>Also, the old guard aren&#39;t wrong when they say stretches of doing nothing but LMM and its various tie-ins could color how outsiders see the PPC. I will admit to asking myself at least once since it came out whether I really fit with this new tone. Yes, I know it hasn&#39;t actually changed, but for one brief moment it felt like it had. I&#39;m not sure how that can be actually addressed, but it is something to keep in mind.<br><br>I&#39;ve also seen a lot more proposed agents that seem only built for one thing: fighting Sues and Stus. I&#39;ve always held (as many people can attest to) that agents should not be engaging in open combat with Sues. The rules that we&#39;ve established say that, 99 percent of the time, any agent who does should be horribly killed or maimed. I&#39;ve got no problem with sneaky ambushes and clever tactics, but I&#39;m not seeing a great deal of those being used in stories. <br><br>So those are my thoughts. Sorry if this seems fragmented; I&#39;m writing this right before work.</p>

            <p>I like your point about people building agents to actually fight Sues and Stus. I too rather enjoy the sneaky, assassin-style killings, the ones where agents who are smart, tough, or just plain creative win out over the powerful but bland Suvians.<br><br>Voluntarily going toe-to-toe with a Sue or Stu is... inadvisable at best, both in terms of narrative and in terms of common sense. Some Sues/Stus are so two-dimensional that they won&#39;t even resist when you shoot them through the heart, but not every one of them is like that. Some are warriors who are actually seen using their warrior skillz. If you&#39;re smart, you don&#39;t want to deal with that.<br><br>Here&#39;s the trouble: You have to charge the Sue/Stu while they&#39;re alive, and charging them takes time. So you can&#39;t just use a sniper rifle or a heat-seeking missile or whatever and kill them outright.<br><br>I think we need more creativity when it comes to disabling them before charging them, and I think we need to focus on having our well-developed agents fight in creative ways against the blandly overpowered Suvians--we need to demonstrate that a well-written character has the flexibility and wiles to win against a Suvian *in an unfair fight*--which is unfair in the agent&#39;s favor because the agent has set up the fight to be unfair, to begin with, and the Suvian simply doesn&#39;t anticipate that anyone who isn&#39;t at their power level could possibly be a threat.<br><br>Not that plans don&#39;t go wrong sometimes. Sometimes, agents have to fight a Sue straight up. But most agents--even ESAS dealing with godmoders--should not be actually planning on simply overpowering their targets. That&#39;s boring, and it goes against the point of an assassination, which is to show that well-written characters in the hands of a good writer can beat raw power and reality-bending without becoming Sued themselves.</p>

            <p>Because like Neshomeh said, yes, we&#39;ve seen this happen before, and it is actually very, very hard to steer things off that path when it&#39;s happened.<br><br>What Neshomeh didn&#39;t mention with her response is that around the same time as all these events and emergencies and what not (That eventually led to the creation of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Catastrophe_Theory">Catastrophe Theory</a>- as you can see we successfully entered what should have been the DOOOOOM stage without DOOM actually occurring, well done us, unless we weren&#39;t paying attention when it actually happened, which is a distinct possibility) the PPC page on TvTropes was created.<br><br>And filled very much with things that were not what we at the time considered to be in the mainline for the PPC, nor do to this day, for that matter. <br><br>So the end result was we got a lot of newbies who arrived with the Completely Wrong Idea about the PPC and that we were serious and were in it to dismantle writers and mock them (which is a concern voiced below by Silentthunder in another thread, as can be seen) and that the PPC as a concept was 100% serious, rather than being what it is. Some of said people managed to work their way through it and are in fact still around, but a lot of them were rather displeased at the fact that we weren&#39;t here to smack fanauthors into submission to acknowledge How Canon Should Be Done- several, in fact, didn&#39;t like fanfiction at all! I&#39;d rather not round two of that, personally. <br><br>That said, I&#39;m also more than a bit put out over the fact that it&#39;s entirely consumed the board since that mission was published- while I&#39;m impressed that said fic was taken care of and a mission done out of it in a relatively short time period, considering what&#39;s happened with most of the other Legendaries- at the same time I&#39;m kinda put out. I can&#39;t read this mission for a good week, if at all, because it&#39;s definitely not something I can read while at work, or access through the only current internet source I have without a significant chance of getting into trouble. <br><br>There&#39;s nothing like feeling like you&#39;re missing quite a bit when you can&#39;t even see what it is that&#39;s going on and a chunk of what&#39;s following in the flurry is related so is also filled with spoilers. </p>

            <p>First of all, it was a mission to a Legendary Badfic - making it easy would be anticlimactic at best, and bordering on Suish for the agents in question.  Just look at the Celebrian mission.  <br><br>Secondly, and the main point... that&#39;s <i>one mission</i>.  There&#39;s no rule saying that all missions have to be that level of serious.  Even a lot of Rina&#39;s previous missions have been much more light-hearted.  You&#39;re making a generalization about the direction of the entire organization based on one story.<br><br>If you really want there to be more funny, light-hearted missions, then you should write them.</p>

            <p>I note that none of you who have replied so far were around back in, eh, was it 2006-2008 when hS was writing <i>The Reorganization</i> and <i>Crashing Down</i>, and Tawaki was doing the Assimilation Crisis and the Key to Canon thing and Mirror Multiverse thing and the Macrovirus Epidemic and the Mary Sue Invasion, and Laburnum was busy trying to push the limits of squick in missions?<br><br>Yeah, other people tried to do the same stuff. It didn&#39;t go well. It started getting out of hand. That&#39;s when we started writing the FAQ for Newbies, Guide to the PPC, etc., to stop people doing that stuff and joining because they thought we were ALL ABOUT that stuff.<br><br>So, as long as it&#39;s just Iximaz we&#39;re probably cool, but I&#39;ll second OrangeYoshi&#39;s wish not to see the whole PPC try to emulate her, even if she is the hS of today what with being madly prolific and wildly popular and an all-around nice person. Because it wasn&#39;t fun the last time it happened. If we can make sure it <i>doesn&#39;t start</i> this time, so much the better.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As you&#39;ve already seen, DawnFire and SeaTurtle have been a part of the arc for a while, as well as one other Boarder who shall remain unnamed because spoilers. However, it is a small number of agents overall in the grand scheme of things, and it&#39;s not like we&#39;re setting out to incite riots or anything. <s>You can blame Sergio Turbo for that.</s><br><br>But yeah, we&#39;re basically keeping it just within our little circle of agents, and anything anyone else does is entirely them. We&#39;re doing this as an exploration of what would happen to agents in their circumstances, and it&#39;s not going to stay dark forever. It&#39;ll all balance out in the end. :)<br><br>(Also, the hS of today? Um, I kind of squealed a little bit, ehe... <sup><sup>;</sup></sup> That means a lot, you know.)<br><br>-iX</p>

            <p>I let myself become emotional, and my writing suffered.

            <p>I can promise you that everybody I&#39;ve seen get involved has done it of their own free will. We&#39;ve been very happy with the results, too--and we&#39;re trying to keep things pretty believable, which...also makes for fun. And I&#39;m all for the connections between agents: they&#39;re very, very fun both to write and to see happening.<br><br>Honestly, though...watching this grow and develop over the past months has been incredible. There have been cute things and sad things and satisfying things, and overall I&#39;m just really happy with how much we&#39;ve put into this and how well it seems to be coming out. It&#39;s been a great experience.<br><br>But yes. Essentially, this is at least intended to be self-contained. It&#39;s not an emergency--it&#39;s one dead agent, another injured one, and their closest friends and family being affected. We also intend to balance it where we can.<br><br>And now that this has ended up being more of a response to several posts at once, I think I&#39;ll end it and go back to looking forward to the fire-lizard hatching :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t been here nearly as long as you have, but I can understand why you&#39;d want to avoid a similar situation. My point of view is this: do whatever best suits a story or character arc. Whether that is light, dark, or some overwhelming shade of grey, do what will make the story the best it can possibly be. <br><br>However... don&#39;t do something just for the sake of doing something. If you force a joke, it won&#39;t turn out well, will it? Darkness for the sake of darkness or gimmick for the sake of being different is a very bad idea, IMO. Everything you write should have a purpose to it, a reason. If you decide to start or follow a trend... step back, take a look, and ask what the overall purpose of the action will be. Everything has a reason - so make it a good one.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t mind darkness. There are people who may found the PPC being too... childish? There are people who may found it too serious. <br><br>It&#39;s like Harry Potter - it started as a childrens&#39; book and gradually went darker, as its readers were maturing. I like to think of the PPC in the same way.<br><br>As Ixi said, life is not all sunshine and turnips (I think that&#39;s what she said ;D) - things are bound to get bad, or have an unexpected turn.

            <p>I personally don&#39;t have any problem with things getting dark every now and then, if there is good reason for it to happen.  The darkness makes the light that much brighter and it propels characters toward growth.<br><br>Even back to the beginning, there has been darkness in PPC stories.  Some of the greatest moments in the best spin-offs have come from seriousness and darkness.<br><br>What you should have a problem with is darkness for the sake of darkness.  I find a lot of grimdark stories fall into this trap.  We have to have gore/death/trauma because those things are edgy or cool.  If it doesn&#39;t serve the story or the characters, then there is no point.<br><br>So, ask yourself, does the recent seriousness and darkness serve the stories and characters that they inhabit?

            <p>Yeah, the PPC is mostly a humorous setting, but it&#39;s not always. There&#39;s a reason why we have frequent references to agents snapping in action, agents dying in action, agents running away from HQ and being declared MIA...<br><br>Face it, for all the humor it has, it&#39;s not exactly fun to be an agent. They&#39;re harried, they&#39;re tired, they&#39;re overworked and underpaid. And the longer a spin-off goes on, the longer an agent has to buckle under the stress. And considering Rina held a record of 36 recorded missions (which, I think, is the second-highest number overall; someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong), she&#39;s had a lot of time to reach snapping point, especially considering what she&#39;s already gone through.<br><br>The PPC isn&#39;t always sunshine and rainbows. Look at the various Sunderings. Look at the Reorganization. Look at the Emergencies that have left hundreds, if not thousands, dead and injured. Look at the other Legendaries, at C*l*br**n; I mean, Dafydd <i>died</i> on that mission, and would have stayed dead if it hadn&#39;t been for Constance. Look at Subjugation, where most of the agents never came back.<br><br>I can&#39;t help but feel a little offended, though, that you&#39;re dismissing months of work out of hand like this. This has been in the making since February, and we&#39;ve put a lot of effort into it. Many hours spent writing, rewriting, planning, discussing, betaing, polishing. Every PPCer gets to decide the overall flavor of their spinoff, and this is what we&#39;ve gone for. We want to explore the consequences of being an agent, and how it really isn&#39;t the greatest job anyone could ever ask for.<br><br>But if it makes you feel any better, LMM is about as dark as my spinoff&#39;s going to get. Everything will be lighter from here on out. </p>

            <p>Well, I won&#39;t say &#39;we&#39;re heading&#39;. I&#39;d say &#39;Ix&#39;s spinoff (and parts of the spinoffs of other connected people such as DawnFire) are heading&#39;. That&#39;s their choice as writers. Other people write different things.<br>Also, I&#39;d like to point that while LMM — and its repercussions — is rather serious and dark, it is not WH40K levels of grimdark and it&#39;s certainly not grimderp.<br>It&#39;s been done before, too; look at Tawaki&#39;s adventures, or read Caddy&#39;s writings — there are some serious moments there, too.<br>What&#39;s more, if you look beyond the funsies and at things usually played for laughs here, you&#39;ll notice that the PPC is an organisation of overworked misfits with barely functioning tech fighting a battle against Eldritch Abominations; the bosses are negligent aliens; and so on. For the most part, it&#39;s played for laughs but it can be played for drama as well.<br>Last but not least, it feels to me that reading LMM and saying &#39;oh no we&#39;re going SRS BSNS grimderp stahp&#39; is kinda rude to Ix, DF and the rest of the people and the huge amount they put into this arc.</p>

            <p>Tawaki at one point wrote something that ended with a number of agents--including <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2015/www.ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Salok">T&#39;Zar&#39;s husband</a>--actually <i>dead</i>, and a number of others assimilated by the Borg. Caddy--I don&#39;t remember the exact details, beyond some things with Cadmar and with Maria Nightingale (mental state in both cases, I think?), but I loved the way it was done, and I still want more of that spin-off. For that matter, we can also add to the list a number of insane or dead agents, a number of serious moments between Nume and Suicide (also handled wonderfully), and, well, basically...this really is nothing new. We may be doing a rather complex arc, we may be involving several groups of our agents...but things can&#39;t possibly remain bad forever (that&#39;s not the way of the world and would get very boring to write), and, at the end of the day, we&#39;re still writing other things--and we three or four writers are also <i>not the entire PPC</i>.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I agree that it&#39;s a concern, and I understand why. However, our intentions in writing this arc are *definitely* not to make the whole of the PPC dark and serious--because we don&#39;t think that&#39;s better or cooler, we honestly think that that just gets boring and depressing to write and read if it goes on too long. (I think I speak for all of us; we certainly switch between writing fluff and feels often enough, and we try to keep stories balanced for the most part. They can feel free to clarify or contradict, though.)<br><br>While we do intend to explore the consequences of what&#39;s happened, and to do so realistically for our characters and their situations, angst is not and will not be the only thing going on, and it won&#39;t last forever. Everyone, including us, would probably get very bored if it did.<br><br>So yes: our corner of the PPC, if it can be called that, is currently going more serious, and will remain that way for a bit while this arc plays out. However, we have no plans to keep it that way forever. And, most importantly, we do *not* want the entire PPC to go serious and dark, especially not for for an indefinite period of time. The PPC is supposed to be fun, to have substance of varying types, to be, in essence, generally comedic even if it&#39;s not always light. We&#39;d really like to keep it that way.<br><br>Again, I definitely understand the concern. But I can vouch for myself and my co-writers that we are in no way trying to change the PPC for the darker--we think it&#39;s plenty cool as it is, and have done for years. We just want to explore something relatively self-contained that could happen within it.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>---Whoops, that was an impressive misuse of word in my previous one, should be &#39;past&#39; rather than future. I think, nothing like watch to drain the brain outta you.<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;m going to be frank: Your reply here does not impress me whatsoever. Let&#39;s break it down. <br><br>My initial response to Scrape was largely along the lines focused on &#39;before we have to deal with people trying to make the PPC dark and serious because they think it&#39;s better or cooler.&#39;<br><br>Your response... while you&#39;re insisting you&#39;re saying that no, you don&#39;t want the PPC to be dark and serious, you&#39;re also being rather dismissive of the actual issue because that&#39;s kind of what you guys are actually doing right now, with all of this.<br><br><i>&quot;So yes: our corner of the PPC, if it can be called that, is currently going more serious, and will remain that way for a bit while this arc plays out.&quot;</i><br><br><i>&quot;I can vouch for myself and my co-writers that we are in no way trying to change the PPC for the darker...&quot;</i><br><br>For better or worse, you lot <i>are</i> rather dominating the current publishing scene for the PPC, as Phobos noted; the board is swamped just from stuff from you guys and with so much of it recently connected to LMM I can&#39;t even read much of it. Just because it&#39;s your &#39;corner&#39; doesn&#39;t remove it from the rest of the PPC. By fact of making your rather large and fast moving corner of the PPC more serious, yes, you are making the whole of the PPC go the same direction as well. <br><br>That said, I don&#39;t hold this particularly against <i>you</i>, any of you, in the singular, but it is something that has to be kept in mind against the whole. I was there for the whole shish-kebab of problems that came about the first time. I&#39;d rather there not be a second. <br></p>

            <p>Okay. I&#39;ve been writing and rewriting replies to this since you posted it, while slowly calming down, watching everyone else calm down, and just...I don&#39;t want to drop replying altogether, because I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m ignoring what you wrote, but I also think that a summary of the points I wanted to make is the more logical idea at this point.<br><br>I wanted to tell you that you make good points--we *are* posting a lot. Some of it is unrelated to LMM (the interludes Des and I did, for instance), but a good chunk of it is. Potential newbies arriving and thinking that the PPC is all about dark themes and only dark themes--well, without knowing what&#39;s planned for this arc, without knowing exactly what&#39;s been written and when things are set to be released...I&#39;d have gotten concerned as well. It seems likely that the time-span and remaining volume of what we have left of this arc (not to mention us and other people posting lighter things) will prevent that.<br><br>Something I wanted to clarify was that I didn&#39;t mean to dismiss the issue--just to respond to what looked like an implication that we were writing this arc because we want to change the tone of what everyone else in the PPC was currently writing (and, presumably, to change the tone of all of our own works permanently). That thought horrifies me, and I wanted to refute it, hence why I wrote what I did (which, apparently, was not clear and managed to miss a point).<br><br>I do not now, and never will, want every writer in the PPC to go &#39;yes, let&#39;s make everything dark and grim and humorless for ever and always because lighter things are boring and uncool&#39;. I wanted (and still want) to make it perfectly clear that I do *not*, in any way (potential accidental influence aside, which would be, well, accidental), think that the PPC would be improved or made somehow *&#39;cooler&#39;* by all the agents becoming humorless, super-dark James Bonds of some sort. (Although now I want to write that as a badfic for the badfic games, and add a scene of horrified and amused agents responding to it. That could be fun). As I&#39;ve said, the thought that someone might think that *is* what I wanted...that really, really horrifies me, to the point where this is less a summary than a slightly shorter rewrite of the attempted summary of the fourth rewrite of...ach.<br><br>Basically: I missed the point, you may have misunderstood me at some point, and by this point I just want to let you know that I have in no way been ignoring what you said and call it quits (and stop using the word &#39;point&#39;). I think the main issues that were being discussed have been worked out, everyone is calmer, and this message doesn&#39;t need to get any longer.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I really appreciate the fact that you took the time to calm down and muster your points, as logically as you could.<br><br>First item: That was definitely a cause; it&#39;s hard to tell what&#39;s going on if you aren&#39;t in the loop, after all, and most of us weren&#39;t! Which isn&#39;t a bad thing, because after all, if everyone&#39;s involved straight up it&#39;s different from seeing their reaction as a reader in the audience. <br><br>Second item: The implication wasn&#39;t aimed at you or the others. It&#39;s more that at this point, I (and the people who&#39;ve been around way longer than I have) have by now seen an awful lot of people swing through the community and declare they want to write super-serious PPC missions and make everything like that! Or even say it *after* they&#39;ve been given permission. That&#39;s a good part of the reason the Permission process is more stringent these days. It was alarming then, and it&#39;s still alarming now! We didn&#39;t mean to suggest it all at your feet, not at all, but it&#39;s still something that is a worry to everyone who was around when it seriously looked like the PPC was going to blow up into being constant emergencies and serious events. <br><br>Third: Again, I appreciate that. (And as for the Bonds comment, well, I highly suggest staying tuned into the Board, I&#39;m going to be posting something you might want to be around for shortly.) Like I said, I&#39;ve seen it, and so have others. It is exactly as horrifying as you&#39;d think.<br><br>In short: It&#39;s cool, we&#39;re cucumbers, this is a salad bowl. <br><br><br></p>

            <p>We&#39;re not doing this arc for teh coolz. We&#39;re not doing it because we think it&#39;s the direction the PPC needs to go, because that&#39;s not at all the case. <br><br>We don&#39;t want the PPC as a whole to get darker, not by any means. <br>My spinoff isn&#39;t going to stay like this, but because I just haven&#39;t yet released certain unpublished materials, everyone seems to be freaking out and acting like LMM is the end-all, be-all of my spinoff.<br><br><i>This is not the case.</i> Things will get lighter, but not immediately. That would be unrealistic and would quite frankly make what&#39;s already happened look like, well, like it happened just for the cool factor. <br><br>Seriously, I don&#39;t want to see the PPC get turned into a grimdark place because keeping that as the status quo is depressing and boring and nobody likes a downer ending, myself included (contrary to what it might seem). <br><br>And I&#39;m sorry, but what do you want me to do about that? Stop writing for a while? It&#39;s not my fault I&#39;m releasing the most stories; if other people want to release, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m stopping them. I just happen to have a lot of free time on my hands, and I use almost all of it for writing. </p>

            <p>You&#39;re welcome to calm down, to begin with. I apologize that this particular thread is upsetting you and that you feel like you&#39;re getting targeted, because it&#39;s definitely not the intention on my part or anyone else&#39;s.<br><br>As for your assertion that your stories stories will be returning to a lighter tone: Okay. I don&#39;t have a problem with that. Nor I suspect does anyone else who&#39;ve expressed concerns in this thread as well.<br><br>The concern was the possibility of this indicating a turn overall towards darker material for the whole of the PPC. You and your cohort are currently publishing a great deal, and they&#39;re following a lot of your lead. It&#39;s not out of order to be concerned about that sort of thing when rather suddenly a rather large group of people who are publishing regularly and quickly are writing darker PPC stories- especially for those of us who saw it happen before and what happened after.<br><br>We are not psychic. We cannot tell what is going on in your mind for the most part from sheer text alone, or even if it is actually sarcasm, like in the example of Matt Cipher and Nesh. We can&#39;t tell what you were planning or intending to do without being in your head, unfortunately.<br><br>And as for the speed of your writing: All I did was comment on it. Nowhere did I even insinuate that you should curb your writing speed or stop whatsoever.<br><br>If you want to talk one on one, I&#39;m going to be on AIM for awhile at fairladypsyche and on Gmail with the address that&#39;ll be clickable with my name.</p>

She is absolutely dedicated to seeing the PPC be the best it can be and adding quality work to be enjoyed by others in the process. I can understand your concern, and it is very realistic - but she has yet to disappoint, and I know she would never want to set the PPC on a course that would be detrimental. She has a lot yet to come, so just wait and see; I promise you will not be disappointed. Have some faith in her, she&#39;s never let us down before!</p>

            <p>You accuse Iximaz of &quot;swamping the Board&quot; with &quot;darker material&quot;. That rather implies - to me at least - that you take umbrage with the amount of missions she&#39;s writing as well as their content and tone. Which, okay, fair enough. But to suggest that, off the back of one mission and a few interludes concerning its effects on the agent in question&#39;s close friends, Ix and her &quot;cohorts&quot; are ushering in some kind of new age of grimderp is absurd. Yes, you were around way back when we were diddly ickle fanlets, and your experience of PPC history is to be respected, but you&#39;re right - you are not psychic.

            <p>And here&#39;s a suggestion: Whenever I&#39;m particularly hot-headed about something, instead of replying immediately, if I can&#39;t cool down, I ask a friend- usually someone who&#39;s cooler heeled than I am by default- to read what I&#39;m going to respond with first.<br><br>That way I can still reply, but I also get some advice on if I&#39;m coming off too strong or anything and then I can change it rather than running right into causing a fight with someone. <br><br>It works pretty well for the most part for helping with tone but still being able to say your opinion. </p>

            <p>July, frankly: implying that a fellow PPCer, whatever their faults, shouldn&#39;t be a part of a public discussion on the Board is rude as well. Scape has apologized to you, which is good; I believe you owe her an apology as well. </p>

            <p>At no point was I rude to Scrape, nor was I making the insinuations or accusations she said I was.<br><br>My response was due to the fact that she entered the conversation to make said response.

            <p>Now that I&#39;ve got some hours of sleep: Well, the thing is that there were two distinct issues in this line of conversation last night.<br>#1: Scape was rude. You were right to call her out on it. She apologised, and I think that&#39;s it for that; holding her rudeness against her <i>after</i> she apologised has a score of, em, unfortunate implications, let&#39;s say.<br>#2: The title of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=281821;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">your post</a> was poorly phrased. It looks to me like there&#39;s an &quot;and you shouldn&#39;t be, so go away&quot; ending implied. Basically, people have a right to voice their opinion, and being rude doesn&#39;t mean they have to shut up; being rude means being called out and, optimally, apologising. The thing is, it looks to me like you&#39;ve mixed the two, and that&#39;s why I think you owe Scape an apology.<br><br>Also... frankly, what pissed me off last night is that people were saying &quot;look, there&#39;s an issue&quot; and not following up with &quot;and I think a, b, c would be good things to avoid the similar Bad Stuff that happened in the past&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know how to resolve this, do you have any ideas?&quot;. That might be my biases (or issues with <s>people</s> a person I&#39;ve met, =/) speaking, but it really pissed me off. What&#39;s more, it feels uncomfortably  similar to &quot;your story has issues a, b, c&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Look, you&#39;ve got problems a, b, c in the story; try doing d, e, f to make it better&quot; or &quot;there are problems a, b, c with your story; I&#39;m not quite sure how to solve them, but please pay attention&quot;) to me.<br><br>I really hope I didn&#39;t end up rambling here, because I&#39;ve the sinking feeling this makes a lot more sense to me than it&#39;ll to anybody else.</p>

            <p>I think you - and Iximaz - and Dawnfire - and Scapegrace - and whoever else - are misunderstanding here.<br><br>Neshomeh, July, and whoever else aren&#39;t saying &#39;this story/storyline is unsuited to the PPC&#39;, which seems to be the feel you&#39;re (all) getting. The analogy <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=281773;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Nesh made</a> to the earlier situation is instructive; it went in, mm, four or five stages.<br><br>1/ I wrote <i>Reorg</i>, <i>Crashing Down</i>, and <i>C<em>l</em>br__n</i>. They were very popular.<br><br>2/ People (eg, Tawaki and Laburnum) decided that they were popular <i>because they were darker</i>/grittier/more interconnected/had deaths in. They started writing that sort of thing into their own stories - Tawaki did repeated arc plots, Laburnum... did Laburnum stuff.<br><br>3/ (Partly because of TVTropes) New people arriving thought that the Tawaki-Laburnum type of mission was how the PPC was all the time. They started trying to best it, with horribly-violent or convoluted prospective agents.<br><br>4/ The people who&#39;d been here beforehand spent a couple of <b>years</b> going &#39;Erk?! That&#39;s not what we&#39;re about!&#39;. It took a very long time to sort it out.<br><br>5ish/ &#39;Sorting it out&#39; involved trying to increase the profile of more positive writing. I wrote Sandra and Freckles&#39; first mission as an antidote to it; I also (perhaps ironically) killed off the DIO to get rid of the &#39;there are secret agents who kill others&#39; darkness wandering around.<br><br>What various people are trying to say is that this storyline has put us into Stage 1: it&#39;s wildly-popular, consuming the Board, and making an impression. And that&#39;s fine; popular things are good! Neshomeh certainly wasn&#39;t saying &#39;<i>Crashing Down</i> should never have been written&#39;!<br><br>Stage 1 is fine; it&#39;s just another way of saying &#39;sometimes stories are popular&#39;. But... well, look at Matt Cipher&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=281772;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">&#39;joke&#39;</a>. That&#39;s a classic Stage 2 response - &#39;you did it, so now I will too!&#39;. And there&#39;s this three-way &#39;who can write the most missions&#39; thing going on with Iximaz, Voyd, and SkarmorySilver; do you think it impossible that one of them would go &#39;hey, I could pull a LMM on my agents, too...&#39;?<br><br>And then we&#39;d have new people seeing just that sort of mission - the big, everybody-dies-this-changes-everything stories that we saw too many of <i>last</i> time. And we&#39;d be sitting solidly in Stage 3.<br><br>What July and Nesh are trying to do (and, I guess, me, at this point) is shortcut to Stage 4: raise awareness of the fact that <b>if people try and imitate this</b>, things will go badly sideways. Hopefully, if that message goes across, we can skip Stages 2 and 3 entirely.<br><br>So, what should you do? What should everyone do? <b>Not change.</b> Iximaz has a moderately dark storyline going on right now, but apart from the agents involved in that, no-one else needs to. Keep letting Agent Des be cheerful, even though miserable things are happening elsewhere in HQ. If you&#39;re <i>not</i> involved in the LMM fallout, don&#39;t try to imitate it - don&#39;t give your own agents Dark Arcs because you think that&#39;s the way to go. Just... keep on being normal.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Short version: nobody&#39;s saying there&#39;s something wrong with the story. The concern is that other writers will try to imitate it and make it the new norm. Counter that by not doing so yourself.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>[Spoilers], but believe me, Des will keep soldiering on (for the most part. He&#39;s allowed to hate his job); he&#39;s the kind of person to spring back up again (and get help when he needs it — cf. his stay in FicPsych after ATWNaNS, calling for help in &quot;So Much for Subtlety&quot;) — though, I think, not right away. The whole business <i>is</i> going to shake him. Even Librarian [spoilers]. But, yeah, I&#39;m not gonna go LMM on my agents. <br><br>Related to that: while the PPC is, at the end of the day, comedic, I know that I want to explore what being an agent does to people. Is it all grimderp? No (and look at the fluff I&#39;ve been writing recently. Mm, fluffeh). Is it all sunshine and rainbows? Also no, because, frankly, being an agent is a shitty job (albeit with some nice perks).<br><br>And, anyway, it might be me, but the &#39;shortcut to stage 4&#39; bit simply didn&#39;t register with me right up until <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=281822;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this post</a> and by that time I was already pissed off. Related to that: can I ask you guys to be more forthcoming with that sort of thing? This is the sort of thing people are emotionally invested in and it&#39;s a good idea to be extra-clear in that case; I know that I&#39;d have reacted differently if there wasn&#39;t such a wait between you guys&#39; posts and that post of July&#39;s.<br><br>There is also the bit about Scape, but that seems mostly done and the bits that aren&#39;t seem to be under control.<br><br>(I hope I didn&#39;t miss anything in this post.)</p>

            <p>(And yes, full disclosure, I am slightly irked at being informed that I have to do this for someone I consider generally mature, intelligent, and thoughtful.)<br><br>Here&#39;s what my process was when I first posted:<br><br>1. I&#39;m busily working on an intro RP post so we can do a fun thing when I said we would, despite unexpectedly having to go to work after all.<br><br>2. I get a text from Phobos alerting me to look at the main Board.<br><br>3. I see a guy with a reasonable and reasonably worded concern getting brushed off by the LMM Cohort en masse, making it seem like his opinion isn&#39;t allowed.<br><br>4. I react with the content of my post, which hS already elucidated. I would like to further elucidate that I was attempting to help Phobos disrupt the &quot;ganging up&quot; effect as much as anything else, because as July points out, that is quite as scary as, in fact <i>moreso than</i> any potential descent of tone into srs bsns. I didn&#39;t spell that out because I rather thought y&#39;all would stop and think about the effect you are having or could have on the Board, and it wouldn&#39;t be necessary. I certainly didn&#39;t want to so much as imply that you guys were <i>deliberately</i> shutting down someone who disagreed with you, because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case at all. I like you guys. You&#39;re nice people. I know you&#39;re not doing that.<br><br>However, I do think y&#39;all need to be more aware of the effect you&#39;re having in both areas: 1) Popular things tend to get emulated. Be aware; please help make sure we don&#39;t have to go through 2008-2010 again. 2) People who all hang out together and plan together and generally do stuff together apart from the rest of the group all popping up to disagree together is scary. Be aware; try not to all jump on a thread within minutes of each other to support/dismantle X opinion.<br><br>I hope that is fair as well as sufficiently clear. Again, I do not intend to accuse anyone of anything, merely to raise awareness of a potential issue and provoke a little more thought going forward.<br><br>~Neshomeh, going dark now because work.</p>

            <p>What Nesh &amp; July are trying to say is that the previous incident set a pattern:<br><br>1/ I wrote <i>Reorg</i>, <i>Crashing Down</i>, and <i>C<em>l</em>br_<em>n</i>. They were very popular.<br><br>2/ People started to imitate them, working in their own dark/interconnected/death-filled plots.<br><br>3/ New people arriving thought that dark-interconnected-death-filled was how the PPC was all the time. We saw a lot of very violent/convoluted agent proposals.<br><br>4/ The people who&#39;d been here beforehand spent a couple of years going &#39;Erk?! That&#39;s not what we&#39;re about!&#39;. It took a very long time to sort it out.<br><br>The LMM fallout is classic Stage 1: it&#39;s wildly-popular, consuming the Board, and making an impression. And that&#39;s fine; popular things are good! Neshomeh certainly wasn&#39;t saying &#39;<i>Crashing Down</i> should never have been written&#39;!<br><br>What July and Nesh (and now me, I guess) are trying to do is shortcut to Stage 4: raise awareness of the fact that <b>if people try and imitate this</b>, things will go badly sideways. Hopefully, if that message goes across, we can skip Stages 2 and 3 entirely.<br><br>So, what should people do? <b>Not change</b>. Don&#39;t imitate or try to best LMM and its aftermath. Just go on as normal. Simple as that. ^</em><sup><br><br>hS</sup></p>

            <p>Hi there guys, I&#39;m finally back! I don&#39;t know if you still remember me. probably not, or if you do it is likely as that guy who had someone post a farewell thread for him. Sorry about that. That was really cold and impersonal, but I had no choice. After the thing that caused me to leave happened, I had to leave immediately so I had to do that. <br><br>Anyway, since my original introduction post is most certainly long since buried,and for the benefit of those were not around the Board at the time I wrote it, let me do it once again. <br><br>I&#39;m James Shields, but you may call me James. <br><br>I have read every relevant introductory material, including The Original Series of course, a good deal of spin off series and plenty of the wiki pages. <br><br>I am from Brazil and my first language is Portuguese. <br><br>My main fandoms ( and those most relevant for PPC purposes, such as for future missions for when I get around to that) are Harry Potter, Nanoha, Sakura, Sailor Moon, Mass Effect and MLP FIM. <br><br>It is good to be finally back guys! I hope I am able to stay for good this time, get you all really well (and for those that were around last time, to reconnect with you all) and even get my Permission (thought that will take so time since obviously I have not been very active in the past 10 months or so).  <br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>A Harry Potter and Doctor Who! crossover? Sounds interesting, though I have to admit that I don&#39;t know much about DW. <br><br>Hermione has always been my all-time favorite. She is indeed awesome :D <br><br>Which is why I dislike those badfics I listed so much. I mean, I love Hermione and I ship HHR, but those stories force her, Harry and sometimes Ron and even Dumbledore to be very different than what they should be. You will notice that all four are actually HHR fics. This is not a coincidence. <br><br>This is a case of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage">Don&#39;t shoot the message</a>. It is always worse when someone who is supposed to be on your side ends up making a bad case for it. I would love for Harry and Hermione to be together, even if I understand why they wouldn&#39;t work as a couple in canon, but it is not helping my case when someone has to assassinate Ron&#39;s character to get them together. Or create a Sparkly Sue that causes highly illogical adoptions or pregnancies to get the same result. Or invent a Love Goddess that was trying to hook them up since they were GLAURUNGING 11 year olds. You get the idea.<br><br>* Sighs * Sorry about the ranting.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m always ready to listen to a rant; it&#39;s cathartic for me when I rant, but I don&#39;t have many people to rant to. <br><br>I know what you mean, too. I get some of that IRL with political/religious stuff-- people make a bad case and bring the rest of us down with them. I&#39;m a Christian, y&#39;see, so I often bang my head into a wall because one of us said something silly. <br><br>I don&#39;t read much shipfic (outside of canon relationships) so I&#39;m not familiar with how they work out. I... may have read some Dramione and some Druna a while back. Maybe. </p>

            <p>You&#39;re right, it does feel good to get that sort of thing out of your chest. So if you evet need to rant, and especially if it is badfic related, I&#39;m always ready to listen to it too. <br><br>I&#39; m a Christian too, so I get what you&#39;re saying as well. <br><br>Non-canon shipfic can be a rather messy business if done wrong. Ever heard of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">Die For Our Ship</a> ? If one plays their cards right with character development, then they shouldn&#39;t have to derail or even kill off one half of a pairing in order to make way for their preferred ship, but unfortunately with badfics Die For Our Ship is almost exactly how it goes.<br><br>I have read some Dramione, but I have never read Druna. I mostly read either Harmony or canon pairings.</p>

            <p>I might take you up on it. <br><br>Awesome! It&#39;s great to have another Christian around. What denomination are you in, if you don&#39;t mind my asking?<br><br>Yeesh. I&#39;m fond of some non-canon pairings, but Die For Our Ship is a wee bit extreme. I wonder, what&#39;s the weirdest pairing someone has pulled off, and pulled off well? That&#39;d be interesting to know. <br><br>I&#39;d say I ship Druna more than Dramione, but when I read fics of either my standards were low; I couldn&#39;t say if any were well done. I&#39;ll have to look over the archives and see if there are any good &#39;uns among them. <br><br>-Alleb<br><br></p>

            <p>Feel free to take me up on that anytime, though I feel like that would be probably best done in the IRC, unless you want to rant to the whole Board, which I am fairly certain no one would have a problem with. Everyone here is so nice and understanding. It really feels like a community around here. Anyway, I have never frequented the IRC myself, but I feel like I probably should sometime anyway. <br><br>If I am honest, I would have to say I don&#39;t have a chosen denomination. I did grow up in a really nice presbyterian <br>school, so I probably feel closer to that. <br><br>Another of my favorite HP goodfics is  <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5176787/1/Thou-Shalt-Not-Suffer">Thou Shalt Not Suffer</a>, precisely because it is the best HP involving christiasn that I have seen around. Unlike most of the others that I seen so far, it never devolves into a religious rant about the Wizarding World. Sure, the protagonist&#39;s parents still come off as extremely fundametalistic, but that and a few SPaG issues(none severe enough to be really distracting) are probably the worst things I can say about it.<br><br>Michelle is simply a really great protagonist. She is duely flawed and extremely likeable. She never gets preachy, but instead mostly just gets really torn apart between staying true to her faith and accepting that she was born a witch, something that very faith deems as inherently evil and sinful, and that she needs to learn to control her gifts. There is also the fact that this story contains one of the most balanced and realistic portrayals of Slytherin that I have seen around. <br><br>Die Fo Our Ship is always more than a little bit extreme.  Good non-canon shipfics obviously mostly don&#39;t fall for it, but it is always a risk with badfic. I would rather  the writer gave me  a reasonable explanation for why the canon pairing is no longer together and why one or both of them is now attracted to the other half of the preffered ship.</p>

It makes them extraordinarily hard to take down, especially if your opponent&#39;s using more fragile wallbreakers. Enjoy!

While the world fades away, she knows that, next time, she’ll have to take a greater effort to fit in. But will she ever find another world where she can fit? Will she dare returning to this same world, in some distant place where nobody knows Hiro and will wonder why he suddenly looks like a girl?

            <p>The story potential for an entity like what Hiroko ultimately became is indeed enormous (especially when you consider that E.V.L. was once a malevolent version of said entity). I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to do it much justice myself, though - I just wanted a mission that ended in a peaceful resolution between the Sue and the agent and this was what I ended up with.</p>

            <p>I am considering leaving the PPC. Let me explain.<br><br>Something about the missions just sits wrong with me.<br><br>I feel that the missions are not the best way to educate the masses on writing well. More specifically, we don&#39;t write a mission for a badfic that&#39;s really for the author&#39;s education. I feel that while we don&#39;t outright flame, we <i>are</i> mocking people who have not learned to write decently.<br><br>We are the ones who carry out executions as if we have the sole right; as if we are assuming that the badfic authors will never listen to good advice. But as I (and probably a few others) know, a story can be rubbish for a long time, and yet not always be the fault of the author. I wrote an Angst!Sue that lasted 19 chapters because only one reviewer came along and told me I was doing something wrong. Everyone else just said it was a good story.<br><br>The thing is, I understand the adrenaline rush of disgust at people getting it wrong and heartily wanting to see it fixed. But I still feel like we&#39;re making little hatefics against the badfics. We&#39;re being purely judgmental. I&#39;d feel better writing a mission if we asked the badfic writer if they&#39;d be willing to listen to constructive criticism, and then doing the mission if they said no.<br><br>All in all, I&#39;m starting to feel that the PPC is most likely not the best group for me to be involved in.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think the PPC really does anything to help people outside the PPC write better. Those of us doing the sporking--yeah, we learn a lot from it. Many of us spork our own old shames.<br><br>What we&#39;re doing is more like MST3K than anything educational. We don&#39;t notify the people whose stories we&#39;re making into parodies. Some missions--the Legendaries, and some of the bleepfics and squickfics--really deserve to be parodied and &quot;killed&quot;. Think of the recent &quot;Little Miss Mary&quot; mission, for example: That mission doesn&#39;t have very much to do with encouraging better writing; it has everything to do with saying, &quot;Glorifying pedophilia is NOT COOL. Let me show you exactly now non-cool it is.&quot;<br><br>Sporking an honest effort by a likely young writer, a Mary Sue usually, can be anywhere from hostile to nearly affectionate. I guess it depends on the writer, and what kind of agents they&#39;re writing. Personally, if I ever start writing missions, I&#39;m probably going to go at it like, &quot;Yipe, this Mary Sue sucks. Poor baby writer; you&#39;ll be embarrassed later. I used to do that too.&quot; Because I did. My Mary Sue was an Animorphs &#39;sue who was the daughter of The Ellimist and literally omnipotent. Yes, really. Oh, and a fighter pilot who was taking calculus at the age of twelve.<br><br>I think you have to follow your conscience. Whatever we do here, we shouldn&#39;t hurt real people doing it. Whether that means leaving the PPC altogether, writing about untangling bad writing, focusing on the truly reprehensible fics, or writing mostly interludes, you have to be true to what you believe is right.<br><br>Personally, I think I want to start writing missions soon, but I want to do it in a way that makes it clear that the PPC, in-universe, is killing &#39;Sues and exorcising wraiths, instead of just squashing entire universes or promoting universal quarantines, because the writers who write those &#39;Sues will someday mature into goodfic writers who will strengthen the continua we all love. In the meantime, we do damage control: Kill the &#39;Sue because her writer, years later, will write goodfic, and it&#39;s worth the effort.</p>

            <p>I know, it wasn&#39;t a question - but it was, really.<br><br>There are two main purposes of the PPC - entertainment, and education. I think you know why it&#39;s entertaining, so I won&#39;t dwell on that. <sup>_~<br><br>But</sup> education... aye, there&#39;s the rub. Who are we meant to be educating? As you say, writing stories murdering their fics is not a good way to teach authors.<br><br>But does it teach other people? I know I learnt a lot about what makes characters bad from reading PPC missions. I know we&#39;ve had a lot of people come here over the years saying &#39;I used to write Mary-Sues, but then I found the PPC...&#39;.  So I think, really, it <i>does</i> educate - but not the badfic&#39;s author.<br><br>You&#39;ve put forward the idea that some (most?) writers of bad fanfiction would improve if they knew they needed to. That definitely didn&#39;t <i>used</i> to be the case! Back when the PPC was all about LotR, almost every fic missioned was of the &#39;if you don&#39;t like, don&#39;t read/any negative comments are flames!&#39; variety. That&#39;s not a parody we created - that&#39;s a thing that actually happened, and happened a lot.<br><br>But have things changed? I don&#39;t know - you tell me! If you think authors of the badfics that get posted on the Board would listen to constructive criticism - why not go and give it? You don&#39;t need to mention the PPC, but just reading through their story and providing that concrit - who knows? It might even work.<br><br>That goes for everyone, actually: if you&#39;re willing to read fics in order to write missions, why <i>not</i> leave a review along the way? It&#39;s not going to hurt you! Obviously that doesn&#39;t apply to old, abandoned fics, but the ones that are still ongoing... well, why not?<br><br>~<br><br>One more thing (there&#39;s always one more thing...): are we &#39;mocking people who have not [yet] learned to write decently&#39;? I certainly hope not! Mocking their <i>stories</i>, yes; even mocking their <i>writing</i>. But not them.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Araeph mentioned in the A/N to one of her missions that she personally leaves concrit first, then missions if the concrit goes nowhere. I think that that would be a good practice to emulate, at least in part: if the fic isn&#39;t clearly abandoned, give at least some concrit (you don&#39;t have to be exhaustive), and if the author is receptive, good! If not, spork away.</p>

            <p>I left some concrit, and the author wrote me back wanting for more, to the point they decided to re-do the whole story taking at heart my suggestions.<br><br>Don&#39;t know if the rewrite did actually happen - didn&#39;t hear anything from the author for a while, and after quite a bit there was still no trace of the rewrite anywhere, but the intent to improve alone is enough for me to consider the sporkign pointless and in bad taste from that point onwards.</p>

            <p>And they weren&#39;t even stories I was missioning!

At least writing missions (though it takes more effort than writing a review) is more entertaining for me, and helps me get better at writing. And considering I plan on making a career out of my writing, I don&#39;t want to be known as the next Stephenie Meyer or the next Cassandra Clare.<br><br>Speaking of them, is it mean to criticize, MST, spork, and otherwise riff on those works of &#39;professional&#39; literature? Or does it make it okay to spork because they&#39;re getting paid for their bad writing? Where do <i>you</i>, Silent, think we should draw the line?

If you don&#39;t like the criticism, you can ignore it, you can not accept it, you can circulate your stories in a closed community. But if you publish it on a place like fanfiction.net, you are implicitly consenting to scrutiny. And we never force anyone to leave a site for any reason, unless they are violating the TOS.<br><br><br><b>&quot;You are a flamer!&quot;</b><br>Politely reminding people to not be lazy asses and that they should take the time to write correctly is not harassment. It&#39;s constructive criticism and, on ff.net, it&#39;s what you agreed to do when you signed the TOS. It&#39;s also something your teachers wish you&#39;d do so they didn&#39;t feel driven to get wasted so often because their students are illiterate numpties.<br><br><br><b>&quot;Cowards! Why do you mock me on your own sites behind my back?&quot;</b><br>Well, seeing as we almost always get whining when we criticize your work to your face, it&#39;s sometimes less annoying for us to keep you out of our critiques altogether. And then there&#39;s the fact that you won&#39;t LET us criticize your fic to your face. The most obvious example of this is the fate of the original PPC series. It used to be on fanfiction.net, where everybody could read it and know whose stories were being mocked. That is, before someone got offended and unjustly reported it and got it taken off, thereby causing us to relocate.<br><br><br><b>&quot;You insulted the story/character, so in a way you insulted me!&quot;</b><br>A Mary Sue is not a human being. A Mary Sue is a character type. It&#39;s like saying, &quot;Storybook villains are stupid!&quot; Authors of storybook villains may disagree, but you&#39;re not insulting a real person if you say that.<br><br>In fact, it&#39;s a common mistake of Sue-authors to believe that we are directly insulting them instead of berating their characters. There&#39;s a world of difference. One is a criticism, and one is a personal attack. You can be a smart and/or good person and still write a truly worthless story—believe me, I&#39;ve seen it.<br><br><br><b>&quot;Why don&#39;t you just give constructive criticism?&quot;</b><br>Because the chances of badficcers benefiting from constructive criticism are slim, at best. Constructive criticism only works when:<br><br><u>The story in question has some merit to begin with.</u> Before you &quot;construct&quot; anything, you need a foundation to construct it on. In this case, the foundation is the badficcer&#39;s basic understanding of English and the canon of a particular fandom. If there is no foundation—if the only advice we can give is, &quot;Next time, please <i>read</i> the book you&#39;re supposedly a fan of!&quot; or &quot;Perhaps you could have a third-grader instruct you on the proper use of punctuation?&quot;—then there&#39;s really no point in our giving criticism of the constructive kind. We are here to enjoy fanfic; we are not Remedial Writing 101.<br><br><u>The author actually cares about the fanfic s/he is writing.</u> More than once, I&#39;ve caught blatant admissions that the badfic authors wrote a fic down while on the phone, in class, or watching TV. If that&#39;s the case, we&#39;ll have put more effort into our critique than they&#39;ll have put into writing the fic in the first place. To mock such a fic will give us entertainment; critiquing it seems like a waste of our time.<br><br><u>The author is receptive to our critique.</u> This is rarely the case in badfic. It&#39;s one of the many problems with creating a Mary Sue: since the Suethor identifies with the character so strongly, s/he tends to treat even slightly negative comments about said character as a terrible personal insult.<br><br>So while it&#39;s not unheard-of for us to leave constructive feedback, we don&#39;t always feel the need to waste our time honestly critiquing a story for someone who will not benefit from it and/or who did not put any effort into the story in the first place.<br><br><br>But, if you want to leave, that&#39;s entirely up to you. We won&#39;t try to stop you.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t disagree that the current FAQ is a little overly aggressive, and I feel that we could stand to tone it down.  We&#39;re not out to rile people up, after all, and coming off like we are isn&#39;t going to help matters.<br><br>That said, nothing we put is going to convince said angry fanwriters not to be angry at us.  It doesn&#39;t matter how you say it, most people aren&#39;t going to care unless you&#39;re saying what they want to hear.  The other thing is, we don&#39;t come off as overly obliging.  Too many Suethors already feel like they should be able to get what they want by making threats or crying.  If we worry too much about not hurting their feelings, they might get the impression that they can manipulate us with them.  And there&#39;s nothing more irritating than having to deal with a temper tantrum.<br><br>Personally, the tone I would advocate is &quot;politely firm.&quot;  Basically, what we need to tell them is that, yes, your writing is that bad; no, we don&#39;t really care that you&#39;re upset to be told so; and no, we&#39;re not going to change our minds about any of this.  Don&#39;t make it rude or personal, that&#39;s just going to cause more offense, not less, but don&#39;t prioritize assuaging hurt feelings, either.  Who knows, maybe a little tough love will even help them grow up - or at least discourage them from throwing a temper tantrum.<br><br>Also, I think a little humor isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, so long as it&#39;s not too aggressive.  I think we should, above all, avoid billing ourselves as some kind of Fanfiction Arbiters of Taste.  If the FAQ comes off as too formal, we run the risk of seeming like we think the PPC is SRS BSNS, which will give a reputation that, in my opinion, is even worse than a rude one.<br><br>Anyways, please don&#39;t necessarily take this as specific criticism of anything so much as general rambling on the issue.  The word &quot;placating&quot; just got me thinking, and I ended up writing way more than I intended.</p>

            <p>But it&#39;s not really our problem that they feel that way.  Learning to disassociate your self-worth from your creations is an important life skill - if you go through life feeling hurt and upset because someone criticizes your work, then you&#39;re going to spend a lot of time being hurt and upset.  Sure, there are lots of people out there who aren&#39;t mature enough to handle criticism, but I don&#39;t think catering to them necessarily helps anyone.<br><br>Also, you have to realize that we&#39;re not doing this to their faces.  Optimally, they&#39;re never going to know if we missioned their fic.  The real education is aimed at the writers we spork, but the people who read our missions, which is hopefully a completely different audience.</p>

I think those two steps, combined, take her work away from mockery of Suesette, and into parody of her cookies.<br><br>As it were. I&#39;m hungry for cookies now. <sup>_<sup><br><br>hS</sup></sup></p>

            <p><i>In the wake of the debacle that was Little Miss Mary, HQ has been abuzz with chatter. Some internal documents have been retrieved from the HQ datanet for your viewing convenience...</i><br><br>&gt;Login<br>&gt;&gt;BOARD OVERRIDE DETECTED, GRANTING FULL ACCESS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DIA Datanet/[[OVERRIDE]]/Today/Special Response/Officers/Section 9/Terabyte/Debriefings/FILE00132<br><br><br>&gt;&gt;Play audio log<br><br><br><b>Inspector Chandra</b>: Tell us about the incident.<br><br><b>Terabyte</b>: The theft occurred in at the beginning of our shift. My partners, Emiranlanoamar and Naya’Keegan, were busy talking to Agent Reader, from DIC. She was visiting us; she and Emiranlanoamar like to discuss Gallifreyan culture and science. Once we received the call, we grabbed our gear and quickly made our way to the DoSAT TARDIS storage.<br><br><b>C:</b> Mhmm. What happened there?<br><br><b>T:</b> We arrived by portal in the DoSAT’s TARDIS storage area. We located the lot where the stolen TARDIS was located. We encountered Agent Abaddon in the storage area. Upon being questioned, he told us that Alex Dives, brother of Agent Dives, was present when she left Headquarters.<br><br><b>C:</b> What was this Abaddon doing there? <br><br><b>T:</b> Looking for a technician to repair his console, ma’am. <br><br><b>C:</b> In a TARDIS storage area?<br><br><b>T:</b> He heard crying and went to investigate. He found Alex Dives on the floor, crying and holding a the stolen TARDIS&#39; tracking device.<br><br><b>C:</b> Hrm. All right then. I&#39;ll need to send a team to follow up on Abaddon&#39;s case, then. What of Alex Dives? Did either of you interact with him?<br><br><b>T:</b> Affirmative. Naya was sent to bring Intern Dives in for questioning at Central. Meanwhile, Emiranlanoamar needed to track the missing TARDIS as fast as possible. He skipped over locating Alex in favour of moving to the New Caledonia TARDIS docks for his rescue attempt.<br><br><b>C:</b> Ah yes, the emergency requisition. We delivered a TARDIS to New Cal. Since Agent Dives was not apprehended, I can see that it didn’t work. Why?<br><br><b>T:</b> Every PPC TARDIS is a clone of the original. Emiranlanoamar theorized that the clones might share a memory of each others’ “future” — if he could catch a glimpse of the stolen TARDIS’ flight path, we could intercept Agent Dives and bring her back to Headquarters. Once he had pulled the time machine from hibernation, he immediately went to work—<br><br><b>C:</b> Sorry — TARDISes hibernate?<br><br><b>T:</b> Affirmative. They are living machines. When the Macrovirus Epidemic and the Mary Sue Invasion ended, they were put in storage in DoSAT. Since we do not have the proper resources or training to efficiently field a TARDIS fleet, they were mothballed and put in storage.<br><br><b>C:</b> I see. We need to do something about them, then: having them lying around like that is a liability. I’m sure DoSAT would appreciate stripping them down for technology and materials too. Anyways, you were telling me about the Guardsman’s attempted intervention, yes?<br><br><b>T:</b> Yes. Emiranlanoamar accessed the TARDIS timeline and found a point of interest. He extrapolated the data and managed to track the startup cycle for the stolen TARDIS —  accelerated by a fast-time field in order to allow for an almost-immediate takeoff — and then the dematerialization. Unfortunately, Agent Dives used a complex trick to mask her demat signature. We were unable to track her. There is no way to know where she went. The Whoniverse, ostensibly, but trying to pinpoint her location in a universe where time and space are easily navigable is an impossible task.<br><br><b>C:</b> Who taught her how to fly? Piloting a TARDIS is not common knowledge in this place.<br><br><b>T:</b> My partner, Emiranlanoamar. <br><br><b>C:</b> Why?<br><br><b>T:</b> Agent Dives and Emiranlanoamar were close. He wanted to please her and satisfy her curiosity. He built a dummy TARDIS and she trained on it along with Agent Reader.<br><br><b>C:</b> Hrm. [Keyboard keys clacking] We will have to investigate him for that.<br><br><b>T:</b> He has already volunteered his headcam memories in order to clear his name. At no point in time did we suspect Agent Dives would steal a TARDIS and escape from Headquarters. I was present for every lesson, ma’am. I can support his testimony. <br><br><b>C:</b> Noted. Thank you for your time, Constable. You are dismissed.<br><br><b>T:</b> Acknowledged. Good day, Inspector.<br><br><br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Medical Department Records/Profiles/DIA/Special Response/Time Lords/Guardsman, the/Bills/Today/Treatment_21314<br><br>Description: Patient came in with a heavily injured left hand. Could not move fingers at all. Severe lacerations, multiple broken bones, and metal, silicon, and bio-coral fragments  embedded in his hand. <br><br>Cause of injury: Driving a fist through a TARDIS console.<br><br>Treatment: Removal of debris and use of a Medi Gun to set bones and mend skin. <br><br>Nurse: Nicole Roy <br><br>Payment: DIA Fee Waiver<br></p>

            <p>Apparently, in the course of time, the concept of fanfiction universities attracted some writers who lack the necessary competence or may be truly evil, finding too much joy in torturing the students while not actually teaching them anything, or concentrating on school pranks while not showing the students learning anything. Thus, some boarders, who may also be administrators of successful fanfiction universities, joined to create the &quot;Official Fanfiction University of Official Fanfiction Universities&quot;, or OFU-squared.<br><br>Someday we will certainly be able to read it.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>It&#39;s kind of nice to see this side of the Librarian, when his barriers are down more than usual. It&#39;s also pretty cool to see inside the Time Lord subculture of HQ, too - while the PPC as a whole is very inclusive, the groups within it might not be. It&#39;s very interesting to me, at least. Fantastic work on this, and can&#39;t wait to see what comes next.</p>

            <p>((-- ah, drop the brackets.))<br><br>1/ There will always be characters who disagree. If Agent Sergio had said &#39;I think this was a bit sub-par on behalf of the Flowers, what what? Perhaps a politely-worded letter of complaint should be worked up&#39;... Dafydd would still have given much the same response. ;)<br><br>2/ Equally, you&#39;re always going to have agents who think the Flowers are justified in whatever they do, so don&#39;t try to get EVERYONE on your side. To some extent, you/he overstated the situation in an effort to make more people go &#39;gasp how terrible&#39; - someone pointed out that they <i>did</i> actually complete the mission, so Sergio&#39;s claim that they couldn&#39;t was patently wrong. <sup>_<sup><br><br>3/</sup></sup> If you want to get Boarders to make something in-universe happen... don&#39;t make it too dramatic. People are far more likely to get on board with, say, a protest outside the SO&#39;s office, than a demand that they start bombing the Flowers. Tune it right, and you can make something in-universe happen, which is always fun.<br><br>4/ Keep an eye on your characters! I&#39;ve recently had to retcon most of Mortic&#39;s interactions with Scapegrace&#39;s DW agents, because he wandered out of character and into self-parody. Don&#39;t let a single note - &#39;Sergio doesn&#39;t trust the Flowers&#39; - drown out the rest of what makes up the character. That&#39;s... probably one of the most important skills a writer can learn.<br><br>5/ Sorry, <i>who</i> started the Blackout? I seem to recall the Board being blacked out having something to do with it... <sup>_~<br><br>hS</sup></p>

            <p>1) and 2) That&#39;s for sure. Never imagined a 100% revolt against the Flowers, &#39;cause that isn&#39;t healty for the PPC.<br><br>3) The protest outside the SO office was indeed the plan - as those who were in yesterday&#39;s chat can testimony. Agent!Sergio&#39;s letter was supposed to be the spark - but instead of a spark I wrote an explosion.<br><br>4) Yeah, one of the reason I went &quot;What have I done&quot; is because, with a cooler mind, I realized that this is too far - probably right into Chaotic Evil when the character is actually between Chaotic Good and Neutral Good. I let my emotions about LMM get the better of me - that is something I have to learn from, too.<br><br>5) But if I didn&#39;t start the RP with my Agents&#39; message to DoSAT there would&#39;ve been no Blackout interlude, right?...

Thank you for your concern period backup um delete? AUGH, forget it.<br><br>My apologies for that mess, I am stuck dictating this as I&#39;m currently bedridden and not able to move much of anything right now.<br><br>Oh, so you just stop talking to get the period, okay. Backup. Backup! Delete! <br><br>Augh, again, I am sorry. <br><br>Moving on to the main part of your message, I didn&#39;t see anyone raising a stink over the Flowers&#39; treatment of agents when Rina and I were sent into Rose Potter and Rina—still a child by human standards—was essentially killed. Sure, everyone was all &#39;ooh, look at the new Time Lord!&#39; but not one of you raised any objections to sending her and myself (then a rookie agent barely into my first week) into a six-part Legendary with no backup, that culminated in my partner getting hit with a puncturing curse that left her entrails all over the floor, then subsequently having to regenerate because our primary remote activator had been broken in the fight with Rose and I would have been unable to get her to Medical in time to save her.<br><br>But no. Now, because Rina has snapped, and stolen a TARDIS, suddenly everyone is interested in our case. Yes, I realized she was starting to go insane, and maybe if I&#39;d been more adamant about her going to FicPsych, none of this would have happened. But while I am not entirely blameless, from things I picked up on, she was never quite stable to begin with, I don&#39;t think. She alluded to being locked up in a mental hospital once before and when I questioned her further on the subject, she became hostile and refused to say any more on the matter. As best I can figure, it was not a pleasant experience for her and one she was not eager to repeat.<br><br>Her refusal to go to FicPsych was ultimately her decision, and while—while it is reg-grettable [sobbing noises] <br><br>No, no, delete that, delete that!<br><br>...<br><br>While it is regrettable, and I miss her a lot... There is nothing we can do, I&#39;m afraid, but hope she comes back. Emiranlanoamar taught her well, possibly too well. From what I understand, she&#39;s beyond tracking now.<br><br>As for your threat against the Flowers, I am quite frankly appalled that you would go to such extreme lengths, especially for someone you don&#39;t even know. Perhaps you should seek assistance at FicPsych so you don&#39;t end up like my partner. <br><br>Yours, <br><br>Agent Zeb, DMS</p>

She was also in no way suitable for a mission of that magnitude, due to issues commented on in Former-Agent Turbo&#39;s original letter.

I must note, however, that this isn&#39;t the first time this has happened - and yes, unfortunately, I speak from experience i.e. being forced to watch my partner [bleep]-ing <i>die</i> in front of me, in a manner so horrific that MTV wouldn&#39;t have aired it, and not being able to do anything to save him to top it off! Things like this can and <i>will</i> happen, even if agents are fully prepared. Rina and Zeb had more than enough preparation thanks to both sporking a different Legendary Badfic (which left behind a mess which I, my partner, and five other agent teams helped to clean up), and over thirty other missions besides, including one with a friend of mine from the DF and his partner into one of Cori Falls&#39; fics. And yet, well, this happened. My heart goes out to everyone who knew Rina on a personal level and are impacted by their loss. In the meantime, I implore any agents unfortunate enough to have been assigned a Legendary Badfic to exercise caution on the highest level during the mission into it, and be prepared for worse than the worst at all times during such an endeavor.<br><br>As for your letter, on the other hand... I literally cannot imagine a more inappropriate and insensitive response to this situation. Literally. Cannot. I can understand that the Flowers were not entirely blameless, and that the assignment of &quot;Little Miss Mary&quot; to Rina and Zeb is disproportionate with respect to the latter&#39;s reporting her violation of the PPC protocol! But it came to my attention recently that Rina refused to seek psychiatric help while she still had the chance, and that she also stole the TARDIS that she used to escape HQ. I was not able to get the details of why Rina took this path, but I can&#39;t condone her actions in the aftermath of the mission. I don&#39;t mean to be demeaning, not by any means - I have the highest level of respect for Rina and her partners. But I was able to recover precisely because of the actions of the Flowers and the staff of the PPC HQ, and refusing to seek those who are willing to extend a helping hand is not a gesture I would endorse for the safety of not only Rina herself, but for others around her as well! From what I read, she was very troubled prior to the LMM incident, and if she ever comes back to HQ in the state that she was back then, this mentality will surely continue unless she reaches out the way I did.<br><br>In short, Rina will be missed by many, including myself, but I hope other agents could learn from this. The arguments that have been spawned by the LMM incident have been many, but it&#39;s worth realizing that the whole situation isn&#39;t exactly as one-sided as it may seem.<br><br>Finally, regarding your threat of violence against the Flowers...  What. The. Buck. That is by far the most absurd and ridiculously ignorant response I&#39;ve ever seen in my life! As noted above, the Flowers&#39; decision to send me to FicPsych for treatment was one that ultimately helped me in the long term, and in general, I can attest to the fact that even if some of HQ&#39;s decisions aren&#39;t necessarily sensible, it&#39;s because of them that we are even able to function as agents in the first place, even if there influence is indirect! They were the ones who founded the PPC, they&#39;re the ones who help those who <i>need</i> help like I did, and they&#39;re the ones who ensure that the PPC continues to function both as an organization and as a community. One very notable agent leaving HQ on bad terms, partly due to her own decisions rather than the decree of her higher-ups, is no grounds for war against the Flowers by any means. And if, by some antonym of a miracle, you decide to follow through with your threat... well... Let&#39;s just say that my Rainbolt, along with plenty of other implements from more than a few of my colleagues, will have your name on it in short notice.<br><br>Sincerely, your Number One Greatest Ace Pilot in All Of Humanville,<br>Rayner Bowerman Blitzkrieg the 20 Percent More Awesome, DMS<br><br>[And while I&#39;m at it, is everyone who&#39;s registered for the Rose Potter cleanup interlude busy or something?

I have, however, done some research into the matter, and I believe your intentions here are entirely out of line. <br><br>Now, while I can relate to the pain your companion must be going through in the loss of her friend, I must remind you that Agent Dives understood the risk of this job. She has not only completed, but publically released mission reports for a variety of continua, including the infamous Rose Potter (which is a fiasco in and of itself - Dives is no stranger to controversy, but I digress). She has already completed a mission of Legendary status - and not only did she complete it, she came out stronger than before. With such a track record of success, who would be a better choice for a mission of the same caliber? Dives had already proven to be up to the task, after all. <br><br>According to the declassified report released recently, the Legendary-status mission &quot;Little Miss Mary&quot; had actually been completed at the time of the incident. Although Agent Zeb was wounded in action, he made it back to Medical safely. Your assertion that she was unfit to complete the mission falls short when you consider that she had already succeeded. Her subsequent actions of breaking into a DoSAT storage lockup and stealing highly-sensitive technology is completely unjustified, and your expectation of a rescue team is, quite frankly, preposterous. This is not the rescue of an agent - it is the capture of a thief and a renegade. <br><br>In response to your terroristic threat of a &quot;daisycutter&quot;, I have reported this correspondence to the Department of Internal Affairs. The jobs we do carry great responsibility, and if you are not able to handle the conditions? You should not be allowed to meddle in the affairs of these worlds.<br><br>If we ever meet, rest assured that I will have a multitude of ways to counteract any violent intentions you may have towards our employers.<br><br>Regards,<br>Bosh&#39;Guk, Ogre Magi of the Stonemaul Clan</p>

            <p>Former Agent Turbo,<br><br>Firstly, let it be known that Internal Affairs is investigating Agent Dives&#39; case as per procedure. An agent has deserted the organization, stolen a valuable piece of technology during her escape, and is no doubt interfering with a Word World as we speak. The crimes Agent Dives is charged with are severe and carry the possibility of expulsion from the PPC if ever she is apprehended. There is no rescue team to retrieve her. This is a manhunt. You are welcome to participate in it if you so wish-- if you know of a way to track a renegade TARDIS commanded by an expert and paranoid pilot in a massive Word World please let us know.<br><br>Secondly, why this particular case? You don&#39;t seem particularly concerned with the twenty-odd other agents that went insane last week, or the fifteen the week before that. Furthermore, I will have you know that Agent Dives has obstinately refused to seek treatment for her stress problems. What were we supposed to do? Arrest her and force her to go to FicPsych as she kicks and screams and rages against us? Tie her down as the Nurses cram pills down her throat? The Flowers expect agents to use the services available to them in order to avoid slipping into insanity. If said agent completely refuses to seek treatment and embraces a self-destructive behaviour, there is nothing we can do except stop them when they will snap. Unless you suggest that every agent submits to a quasi-Orwellian surveillance program to monitor their mental health, we can only continue to promote FicPsych&#39;s services and stop agents who have crossed the line.<br><br>Thirdly, let it be known that DIA takes every threat of violence against PPC personnel very seriously. If you act, you will be stopped.<br><br><br><br>Inspector Ananda Chandra, Department of Internal Affairs<br></p>

(I&#39;m not surprised.  Take them away from the Capitol, and they all immediately start acting strange!)<br><br>Anyway, to answer your point about tracking and communicating with TARDISes in canon...<br><br>-- The Daleks tracked the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS in <i>The Chase.</i><br><br>-- The Daleks and the Monk tracked the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS, and vice versa, in <i>The Daleks&#39; Master Plan.</i><br><br>-- The Celestial Toymaker tracked and captured the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS in the story that bears his name.<br><br>-- The Elders tracked the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS in <i>The Savages.</i><br><br>-- The Great Intelligence tracked and nearly captured the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS in <i>The Web of Fear.</i><br><br>-- The Time Lords tracked and nearly captured the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS (and only didn&#39;t capture it because they wanted to force him to return of his own - ahem - free will) in <i>The War Games.</i><br><br>-- The Doctor tracked and followed the Master&#39;s TARDIS, despite not even having a working TARDIS of his own, in <i>The Time Monster.</i><br><br>-- The Time Lords were able to divert the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS to Karn in <i>The Brain of Morbius.</i><br><br>-- The Time Lords sent a recall signal to all TARDISes in <i>The Hand of Fear/The Deadly Assassin.</i><br><br>-- The White Guardian diverted the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS to His domain in <i>The Ribos Operation.</i><br><br>-- The Time Lords sent a message to the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS in <i>Full Circle.</i><br><br>-- The Keeper of Traken found and projected himself aboard the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS in the story of the same name.<br><br>-- Other people from Traken sent a message to the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS in <i>Logopolis.</i><br><br>And that&#39;s just from the first four Doctors&#39; eras.  Going by canon, it should be possible to track a TARDIS.<br><br>However, most of these involve the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS and may rely on specific flaws in the Type 50 design.  And if you&#39;re talking a TARDIS that fought in the Time War, it may have been specifically protected against tracking and interception.<br><br>~Agent Sean Bellman.<br><br>--<br>((BTW the comments in the opening paragraph aren&#39;t intended to be disrespectful of Ix&#39;s amazing story.  They&#39;re just to show that for most of HQ, this isn&#39;t a big grimdark SRS BSNS tragedy that&#39;s engulfing everyone.))<br></p>

I&#39;m gonna need to get DoSAT again.<br>Anyway &amp; as I&#39;ve said: we can&#39;t use any canon beings (such as the Celestial Toymaker) for this end — that&#39;s what Suvians do. So the question is, do we have any Time Lord or Dalek (or Trakenian) tech that can do the same? I&#39;m inclined to think that if DoSAT would have had any such thing we wouldn&#39;t be sitting here exchanging ICEP messages about it; we&#39;d be hearing about Rina&#39;s trial.<br><br>~Agent Desdendelle</p>

            <p>I suspect there are old forums and new forums. What we&#39;ve got right now is an old forum, the threads of which pretty much behaves like any other wiki article; what could be enabled in Wiki Features is a new forum, which would behave like... a forum. Do we want to give it a try and see what happens, just in case we need it?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As some of you may or may not know, my dream is to become an interpreter in both writing and speech. I have this thing, where I search for English novels and try to translate them. But... why don&#39;t I try the other way around? Take some of Poland&#39;s best books and try to translate them to English? The only problem is – I need readers! Recipients! Audience!<br><br>My first big Polish project would be <i>The Soul Thief</i>, Book One from &#39;Dora Wolf Hexalogy&#39;. <br><br><img src="http://ecsmedia.pl/c/dora-wilk-tom-1-zlodziej-dusz-b-iext22650509.jpg"><br><br>The shortest description I could think about it would be: Think <i>The Dresden Files</i>, with a genderbent main character.<br><br>Now, would there be anyone willing to Beta-slash-read my work just like that? Also, don&#39;t worry about the copyrights; I&#39;m friends with the author, she allowed me to use her book for a non-profit fan translation.<br></p>

            <p>...but not to edit the whole thing, no. Quite honestly--even if you were paying me to edit the whole thing, I simply wouldn&#39;t have the time. I&#39;m a full-time university student pursuing two degrees, doing a placement one day a week for which I&#39;ll have to make lesson plans this year, and I may end up with a Sunday job again, too. I&#39;ll (hopefully...) have free time this year, but definitely not enough to edit or comment on an entire book.<br><br>However, translation is very interesting to me (although I don&#39;t know any Polish at all, unless any of it is the same as the tiny bits of Russian that I know/you count whatever Polish words made it into Yiddish, which I can&#39;t actually identify since I don&#39;t speak Polish--wait, where was I going with this? Oh, right). Essentially, I wouldn&#39;t be at all able to tell you if your translation is accurate, but I can let you know if a short piece is understandable or if I see any really glaring errors. But yeah, there&#39;s no way I could beta the entire thing.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I mean the one from Trek, in case any other franchise happens to have a Galaxy Class.<br><br>The Galaxy Class is billed and said to be this ultra-super mega awesome starship, but it, well... Kinda seems to suck a little. To quote Tv Tropes&#39; wallbangers page on TNG, it seems to have a glass jaw. I mean, look at how the original Enterprise fought without shields. Pretty badassly, if I do say so myself. Then, you have the Enterprise-D. (Spoilers) It got shot down by a single, outdated bird-of-prey. And, I get it, the Galaxy class likely had a lot of help from the plot when it came to sucking, like a starship version of The Worf Effect.<br><br>And this isn&#39;t just some rant. I want to know how I might portray the Galaxy Class in my fanfics (Once I recover my hard drive) and my foundry missions in STO. I don&#39;t want to be completely dismissive of the class, but I think it&#39;s a little bit past &#39;ideal starship&#39; given how many they lost during the Dominion War, for instance.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure where or who bills the Galaxy as mega awesome, necessarily. It&#39;s not meant to be a warship, which is in many ways the whole point of the TNG part of the franchise: compared to the old Trek with Kirk indulging in green-skinned alienesses and the second movie being a submarine thriller in space, Picard is meant to be a diplomat and an explorer. <br><br>The Galaxy class does have some design peculiarities. Its remit is to<br>- explore space<br>- conduct scientific experiments<br>- carry out diplomatic missions<br>- conduct search, rescue and humanitarian operations<br>- patrol the edges of Federation space, and<br>- transport VIPs or important cargo.<br><br>This calls for a vessel that is<br>- moderately combat-capable<br>- fast<br>- spacious but not as spacious as a dedicated cargo ship<br>- passenger-capable<br>- able to carry non-combatants (including family members of the crew, which is a Federation ideological choice and probably a major draw to enlist capable Starfleet personnel in an economy without financial incentive) and<br>- self-sufficient for long missions <br><br>The Galaxy class has an incredibly broad mission profile (even too broad - why not have separate VIP transports with military escorts? but this is more to do with Starfleet design ideology and tradition which seems to favour generalist designs), and thus the ship itself needs to be very adaptive as well. It can&#39;t be a specialized warship like the Defiant (which is too small and too Spartan) or a research vessel like the Oberth (which is also too small and has no combat ability to speak of). It&#39;s flagship material for the kind of Starfleet whose mission includes things that the United States government has several separate agencies and branches for: the Navy, the Air Force, the Army, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the NOAA, NASA, the State Department... the fact that the Galaxy can do all these things successfully is impressive already. <br><br>This could be thought of as author oversight, but remember that in DS9, they went out of their way to design and build a warship for the Dominion War, and inspired by this, the Sovereign class (Enterprise-E) is built to be more of a warship than the Galaxy class. Using the Galaxy in the Dominion War was like using up-armoured cars in World War 2: it would serve a purpose in a pinch but it was not anywhere as good as a purpose-built design. The fact that the Galaxy class suffered losses in the Dominion War is not meant to signal how poor the Galaxy class was as a ship as much that the Federation was unprepared and desperate enough to throw Galaxies into the fray.<br><br>And of course the Bird of Prey was able to take down the Enterprise-D in Generations: they had an inside man and they exploited a flaw in the shield systems that would have been present in ANY Federation class of ship using the same shield system (probably all of them) allowing them to score a surprise hit on the most critical of the ship (the warp core).<br><br>I&#39;m more appalled by the tremendous design white elephant that is the saucer separation system. </p>

            <p>Just letting you know, the Defiant was made to fight the Borg, not the Dominion. Though, it certainly proved it could handle both. And as for the Generations thing, Khan disabled the Enterprise&#39;s shields, as well. I get that it&#39;s even less of a warship than the Constitution class, but I still find it... odd that the much larger Galaxy class would be outclassed in both armour and hull integrity by a design over a century old. Again, this really makes no difference.<br><br>I am curious about what you mean by &#39;white elephant&#39; when talking about the separation system. As in, there are so many different ways that it&#39;s a white elephant, I&#39;m not really sure which one you meant to draw attention towards. Maintenance? Fragility? Hell, maybe the system itself was responsible for it getting shot down in the first place! More redundant systems, bigger warp core. Bigger warp core, bigger target.<br><br>I always thought that maybe the Galaxy class was made like the Titanic: Grand, comfortable, great on paper, perfectly sinkable in reality. More made to showcase the Federation&#39;s starship building talents than anything.</p>

            <p>Now that you mention it, it&#39;s funny how Khan used the exact same trick (use an inside source on the ship to find the magic number to kill their shields) against the original Enterprise. It&#39;s almost as if it&#39;s a massive operational security issue to make something like that possible. Doesn&#39;t the keycode actually give you control over ALL of the victim ship&#39;s systems, to boot? Why would you ever design something like that? <br><br>(My bad on the Defiant raison d&#39;etre.)<br><br>As for the separation system, imagine the discussion at Utopia Planitia Shipyards.<br><br>ENGINEER: &quot;The saucer section will be detachable and capable of autonomous operation and thus all critical systems need to be redundant on both vessels per existing specs. If separation is deemed necessary in an emergency, all non-combat personnel will be evacuated into the saucer section and the saucer and neck prepared for detachment by engineering crews. We estimate that this procedure will take 50 minutes if done properly and as low as 20 minutes if done as a crash procedure.&quot;<br><br>ADMIRAL: &quot;So you would say this would be a way to react to the slowest emergency in the universe while also increasing the complexity and cost of building the ship?&quot;<br><br>ENGINEER: &quot;Well, the alternative was just throwing all the civilians into lifepods or equipping the Galaxy class with enough shuttle capacity to carry all non-essentials and that would be incredibly <em>boring</em>.&quot;<br><br>ADMIRAL: &quot;This sounds like it&#39;s prohibitively expensive, makes the ship more vulnerable to malfunction, and is something any reasonable Starfleet Captain would never commit to, because his ship will be vulnerable for at least 20 minutes in an <em>emergency</em>.&quot;<br><br>ENGINEER: &quot;Oh, also, despite the fact that the saucer separation system is only to be used in a dire emergency, the saucer and battle sections are also able to re-dock in situ, meaning instead of a system to shear the connections between the saucer and the battle section in a controlled manner, and reattaching the sections back at Utopia Planitia, it&#39;s actually an extremely complicated undocking-docking procedure.&quot;<br><br>ADMIRAL: &quot;I bet next up you&#39;ll tell me the saucer section has been designed sturdy enough to endure atmospheric re-entry and unpowered descent on a class M planet in the extremely remote - nay, <em>astronomic</em> - chance that the ship happens to run into its slow-motion emergency near such a planet, and all this without turning the crew into mush.&quot;</p>

            <p>As Artell mentioned at some length, she&#39;s a long-range exploration spaceship - think of her as a Coast Guard cutter rather than a warship at all.

            <p>There actually are fighters in Starfleet in the TNG era onwards in the canon, but they don&#39;t really feature until the Dominion War because they are meant for war, not peaceful things.

            <p>...particularly battle groups consisting entirely of drones, is enemy electronic warfare. <br><br>Sure, your drones are autonomous, so you don&#39;t have to worry about signal decay, but you&#39;re still going to want to be able to transmit new orders, update target priorities, change mission profiles, etc. so they do have to be capable of receiving signals. And if they can receive <i>your</i> signals then they can receive other people&#39;s signals too: which means there&#39;s a chance they can be suborned.

            <p>It seems from <a href="http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Galactica_type_battlestar#Armament">the Battlestar wiki</a> that Colonial ships use physical weapons exclusively, which means all that frequency-matching going on in <i>Star Trek</i> is entirely pointless. Memory Alpha <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Deflector_shield#">claims</a> that a <i>Constitution-</i>class could take 90 simultaneous photon torpedoes to its shields. How many high-explosive bullets is that? Should we assume equivalence to <i>Galactica&#39;s</i> high-energy shells? Colonial weapons are optimised for use against superconducting armour, and are designed to cause physical damage, which makes me think they won&#39;t be too effecting against deflector shields.<br><br>So how about going the other way? A phaser strike on a Battlestar&#39;s hull should be dissipated by that armour, since phasers are energy weapons. Destroying a Battlestar with phasers will involve heating the entire hull until... well, probably until you cook the crew. That&#39;s going to take a while.<br><br>Torpedoes? Uh... Memory Alpha <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_torpedo">thinks</a> that a <b>single</b> photon torpedo detonation could destroy an unshielded <i>Galaxy-</i>class. And that&#39;s a physical matter/antimatter detonation. <i>Star Trek</i> ships don&#39;t appear to be armoured, so that&#39;s not a terribly impressive achievement... but it still speaks to the power of the weapon.<br><br>How well can a Galaxy aim? If it can hit a Viper accurately with a phaser, the Viper is probably dead (due to hull heating if nothing else) - but that&#39;s true of any fighter up against main guns. Energy weapons probably make hitting your target easier, though. On the flip side, phasers are probably useless against a Battlestar - but photon torpedoes are orders of magnitude more powerful than anything the Twelve Colonies have. Unless Federation shields are highly ineffective against Colonial weapons (Memory Alpha doesn&#39;t really talk about how well they work against physical objects), I think the Galaxy takes this one.<br><br>(A Galaxy is somewhat under half the length of the <i>Galactica</i>, for the record.

Stick a few hundred of them out there on long-range ballistic courses, ramp them up to a few thousand times the acceleration human-crewed ships can handle, and watch your enemy burn from across the solar system.  <sup>_^</sup> Doesn&#39;t make for gripping TV, though. ~hS</p>

            <p>I call shenanigans on a <i>Constitution</i> class&#39;s shields being able to take that much punishment. According to the episode quotes the <i>Enterprise</i> takes a hit equivalent to 90 photon torpedoes with little effect: it dropped the shield&#39;s integrity by 20%, but that was about it. Apparently it wasn&#39;t until it had taken a further 3 of those hits that the shields dropped. <br><br>But I can&#39;t remember any fight ever using hundreds of photon torpedoes, and I sure can remember the ships taking damage. <br><br>Also, I believe that your statement that &#39;photon torpedoes are orders of magnitude more powerful than anything the Twelve Colonies have&#39; is inaccurate. According to <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/usefultables.php">my favourite page on the internet</a> the destructive power of a photon torpedo is 2.7 x 10<sup>17</sup> Joules (equivalent to 64.3 million tonnes of TNT). Which makes it just a bit more powerful than the Tsar Bomba at 2.1 x 10<sup>17</sup> J (a 50 Mt yield nuclear device), and the largest mankind has ever detonated. I think that a society far enough in advance of our own to have easy FTL transport will also have continued to build bigger and more powerful weapons, so assuming that our current largest has become their standard seems reasonable to me. Having said that, phasors are almost certainly significantly more powerful than the main cannons carried by <i>Battlestars</i>. <br><br>We also know that the <i>Galactica</i> can survive nuclear strikes, and with fairly minimal damage (you know, considering they got nuked), so they could probably survive several photon torpedo hits. <br><br>Having said that, I suspect that a <i>Constitution</i> carries more photon torpedoes than a <i>Battlestar</i> carries nukes. So it&#39;s still not looking great for the <i>Galactica</i>.  <br><br>As for how may bullets it would take to punch through a <i>Constitution&#39;s</i> shields... well, I don&#39;t think that anything which can take a high yield nuclear detonation is going to be bothered by any number of bullets. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>Something possibly of note is that (in the reimagined series at least) the Colonial Battlestars appear to use some manner of chemical propellant for their main weapons. Now, space combat, as any fule kno, occurs over very large distances. This implies that the projectiles are moving very, very fast indeed, which in turn means that high explosives are going to be vastly less effective than simply using a more massive bullet. I wonder how Trek shields stand up to high-speed kinetic bombardment; after all, it&#39;s not like they&#39;re kinetic barriers. =]</p>

            <p>How fast can <i>Star Trek</i> space ships move when they don’t travel FTL? There’s probably some hand-wavy hyperspace explanation for FTL travel, but at very high STL velocity, every particle of cosmic dust should punch a micro-hole through a space ship that is neither heavily armored nor equipped with some sort of shield against fast-moving objects.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>... sublight (&#39;impulse&#39;) engines have been seen to drive a ship at up to 0.5c.

            <p>Actually, I&#39;m not entirely sure which of two points you&#39;re making:<br><br>1/ The guns use space!gunpowder, which means the weapons <b>aren&#39;t</b> internally propelled, which means they have to fire fast to get there in any reasonable time. If this is the case, then yes, they&#39;re going at a fair clip, and the wiki actually specifically calls the Vipers&#39; main weapons Kinetic Energy Weapons.<br><br>2/ The projectiles <b>are</b> internally propelled, with chemical fuel, which means they must be moving fast because they continually accelerate. This only works if they have a high rate of acceleration, of course.<br><br>To either point: the range of Battlestar combat is roughly planet-scale, I think - I&#39;m sure I remember <i>Galactica</i> firing on base-stars as they came over the horizon. The scale of Federation combat is... uh... a lot less. I remember seeing a figure of 40km for something on Memory Alpha, which is frankly ridiculous.<br><br>Which means that Captain Kircardway will try to close on the Battlestar, while the Battlestar uses its Vipers to try and stand her off. Hmm... are short-range warp trips possible? If so, that&#39;s a major advantage to the Galaxy, because it gets to choose the range.<br><br>I still can&#39;t find <i>any</i> information on the matter-deflecting properties of Trek shields. I know they <i>do</i> block matter - they have to be lowered to let shuttles fly through - but how well... no idea. It doesn&#39;t matter how fast the Colonials are shooting their bullets if Kircardway&#39;s shields can stop an asteroid, for instance. (Well, it does... but you said chemical propellants, and they aren&#39;t going to give significant fractional-c speeds).<br><br>(All of this assumes Kicardway doesn&#39;t use the traditional <i>Star Trek</i> &#39;get out of combat free card&#39;: transporting a photon torpedo into the Battlestar&#39;s interior.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>By a very simple trick, you gain a 50% chance that your enemy will miss you entirely. You get to move to the exact position you want. You can open fire immediately. Even if half the time it doesn&#39;t work (ie, they target the new version), that&#39;s still a massive advantage.

            <p>As for why the Picard Maneuver didn&#39;t revolutionise space warfare, Data supposedly came up with a counter for it. I&#39;ve read the brief explanation, and it doesn&#39;t make any sense to me, but apparently there is a countermeasure. <br><br>More realistically (I love using that word in these kind of discussions), it may be that while the short hops are <i>possible</i>, they aren&#39;t advisable for some reason - such a short jump could place undue strain on the FTL system, risking burning it out or something. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>But Data&#39;s, uh, basically the most advanced computer in existence, right?

            <p>In the reimagined series, the main guns have massive muzzle flashes consistent with extremely scaled-up conventional weapons. As for the second point, well, it rather depends on the field of battle. I dimly recall planetary and stellar gravity playing hob with entering and exiting warp, buti might be wrong. In deep space, however, this is obviously not an issue.

            <p>According to the <i>Farscape</i> Encyclopedia Project, a command carrier can take a dreadnought in a one-on-one fight.

            <p>No, I don&#39;t have Netflix, although I have been wondering getting an account, or one of the equivalents like Amazon Prime. My annual DVD budget is probably higher than the subscription costs would be, but I do like actually having the physical copies sitting on my shelves.<br><br>Having said that, the boxset of all the series seems to be a reasonable price at the minute, so I probably will pick it up.

            <p>The inaugral All-Multiverse Warship Rally is already underway; the eight competitors have had their first round each, so a third of the battles have been played.<br><br>Obviously, news of this has spread across the rest of the Multiverse, and new challengers are lining up to enter. The Organisers Who Shall Remain Nameless (OWSReNs) have been forced to lay down some rules:<br><br>-Only one ship class may be entered from each civilisation or faction.<br>-This ship may have docked smaller ships (ie, a carrier), but may not receive assistance from outside forces.<br>-The ship must be a <b>production</b> ship, ie, representative of the larger members of its armed forces. Unique, one-or-a-few-of-a-kind vessels will not be permitted.

            <p>You make a compelling case for the Champion (and I&#39;m not just saying that because the <i>Honorverse</i> is one of my favourite settings). <br><br><b>Round 1</b><br>I&#39;m glad to see the Battlestar got through her first round encounter (even if she did take a bit of a kicking). <br><br><b>Round 2</b><br><i>Thor hefted his hammer. &quot;Right,&quot; he said. &quot;This could take a while.&quot;</i> - loved that line :)<br><br>Although not surprised that it didn&#39;t go well for him.<br><br><b>Round 3</b><br><i>The Star Destroyer Vanquisher moved through space like a shark</i> - what, you mean it had to keep moving forward to stop itself from sinking? (Sorry, but that was my first thought on reading that line)<br><br><b>Round 4</b><br><i>...every single one wasted itself against the roof of [Insert ship name here]&#39;s wedge.</i> - a line taken straight out of so many of the books. <br><br>I also thought, at first, that a salvo of 200 warheads seemed low for an SD(P). Then I wondered if that was just because I&#39;m used to seeing the thousands and tens of thousands that battlegroups throw, rather than just a single ship. <br><br>I&#39;m still not sure though. According to the <a href="http://honorverse.wikia.com/wiki/Medusa_class#Technical_Specs">technical specs</a>, a <i>Medusa</i>-class has enough fire control links to handle salvos of 200 pods, but each pod will be carrying somewhere between (I think) 6 - 12 missiles depending on which generation they are.<br><br>Just thought I&#39;d mention it, because the fact that HMS <i>Masquerade</i> fires off 200 missiles in each encounter makes it seem like you think 200 missiles is her maximum throw weight, when actually it&#39;s much higher than that. <br><br><b>Round 5</b><br>Nothing much to say here. Shame the <i>Battlestar</i> got taken out, but I agree with your reasoning. <br><br><b>Round 6</b><br><i>Masquerade&#39;s missile pods gave her a heavier weight of fire, but once rolled they were critically vulnerable to proximity kills.</i> - not so much. See, the thing is, the early pod designs towed their (completely unshielded) missile pods outside the ship&#39;s wedge, which meant that they were exposed, and that the ship&#39;s max acceleration and turn speed was reduced - if the ship was fired on before they&#39;d turned to present their broadside for firing, then the pods would simply be lost as collateral damage to all the bomb-pumped x-rays flying around. Heck, one decent ship-killer could probably take out dozens of pods if it went off in the right place.<br><br>But with the design of the podnaughts, the missile pods are only exposed to potential enemy fire when they are about to be fired themselves. Yes, they could still be taken out, but the Star Destroyer&#39;s primary armaments are its turbolaser batteries - and these weapons don&#39;t have blast radiuses to worry about. Sure, a hit from one will definitely destroy a pod (for the same reason that it&#39;d shred any starfighter), but I doubt they&#39;d be able to aim for them. Also, once your pods are rolled, you don&#39;t have to worry about them too much - if you see incoming fire that might take them out, just launch. You may not have the best firing solution at that point, but you don&#39;t have to lose the missiles. <br><br><b>Round 7</b><br>Nice tactic from the <i>Masquerade</i> there. Also, as a comment about the tournament in general, I like how the outcome of some of the fights is due to differences in the science of the settings, and how some tactics just don&#39;t work against ships that use different rules - such as the <i>Honorverse</i>&#39;s &#39;only vulnerable from the sides&#39; quirk. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure about the damage that <i>Masquerade</i> sustained though. The only comparable instance I can think of is in <i>On Basilisk Station</i>, when <i>Fearless</i> disables a Havenite courier ship with a close pass, but the courier ship has significantly less powerful nodes, and it&#39;s the nodes that get damaged - not the hull. Which to me implies that it suffers some kind of energy feedback thing on its nodes, which caused the damage. If <i>Fearless</i> had passed closer, then the hull would have been damaged by the gravitational stresses, just as happened to the <i>Cataclysm</i>, but I don&#39;t see why <i>Masquerade</i>&#39;s nodes would have suffered damage in this case - there was no conflicting gravity wave present to cause the kind of feedback that I think is necessary for this damage.<br><br>Of course, this is all just conjecture on my part, as I don&#39;t believe the question of what happens when wedge strikes a significant mass has ever been answered in canon. <br><br>The only incident I can think of is at the end of <i>In Enemy Hands</i>, when a pinnace brings it&#39;s wedge up um... <i>very</i> close... to the much larger mass of a battlecrusier, and the nodes certainly last a little while: it&#39;s possible that they burned out, but equally possible that they didn&#39;t - and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be getting any witness statements. While the pinnace is certainly destroyed, that destruction could have come from any number of sources. <br><br>But, it&#39;s your story, and I can&#39;t think of any reason why it <i>couldn&#39;t</i> happen like that - it just isn&#39;t what I would expect. <br> <br><br>I have some candidates in mind for the Second Tournament, but they are mostly from more obscure series, or from canons that I know of, but don&#39;t really know that well myself, so I&#39;m going to have to have a look around and see if there are decent reference sites for them. One thing that did occur to me about this first tournament is that the computer games were <i>severely</i> underrepresented. <br><br>- Irish </p>

            <h1>6: Yes, they certainly can be destroyed once they been rolled (hell, if a hit gets through the sidewall and hull armour they can be destroyed <i>before</i>), but it seems like a much lower risk in this situation. The Star Destroyer&#39;s weapons, being non-explosive, probably aren&#39;t going to do much to the pods, simply because they&#39;ll likely be targeted against the ship laying them. <br><br>I think the main problem <i>Wayfarer</i> (yes, I&#39;m pretty sure you got that right) had was that she was the trial for this type of weapon design, and had been made by retro-fitting an existing merchant hull. That meant that she was quite slow to roll her pods, and her mission profile meant that she didn&#39;t have the back-up from a full task group while she did so. She also ended up going up against opponents with significant defences (if I remember rightly she went up against battlecruisers, when she was meant to be on anti-piracy patrols), which meant that the only way she could beat them was to roll several salvos of pods, then launch them all at once for one massive salve that completely overwhelmed her target&#39;s point defence. So while she was assembling her heavy salvo, it was very vulnerable. <br><br>The proper pod-layers can lay more pods at once than she could, and of course they tend to operate in large groups, so they can get their overwhelming salvos by having a dozen ships roll two sets of pods, instead of one ship roll two dozen sets. This means that modern pod-layers are much less vulnerable to having their pods killed, as they are more spread out, and the salvo takes less time to assemble. <br><br>#7: Obviously my personal head canon is different from yours, but I see the nodes and their gravity bands like a cutting torch - put an object in the way, and that object is going to get wrecked, but the torch (or impellar nodes) are going to be unaffected by the object. Point two of them at each other, and they could both take damage, but if one is significantly more powerful than the other then it will &#39;win&#39; in short order, and no longer have to worry about taking damage. <br><br>The thing is, the gravity bands are intangible objects that are being projected remotely. I don&#39;t see why disruption of those bands by physical would cause anything to happen to the actual projectors - but I can see conflicting energy fields setting up some sort of destructive harmonic/oscillation in the emitters. I dunno why, it just seems different to me. <br><br>As for <i>Masquerade</i>&#39;s &#39;easy win&#39;, it seems quite sensible so far, and I&#39;m struggling to think of a non-<i>Honorverse</i> ship that would be able to overcome that. Even in settings which have powerful defence shields, like <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Star Wars</i>, generally speaking hammering on those shields will cause them to break. But <i>nothing</i> can get through a military grade wedge - if <i>Masquerade</i> just approaches &#39;belly up&#39;, then rolls when she&#39;s good and ready to fire, she&#39;ll be able to soak up all the initial incoming fire.<br><br>Even a surprise attack from a stealth ship wouldn&#39;t necessarily do that much, as they&#39;d have to get lucky and fire down the throat or kilt for it to do any good (which they might not want to do anyway - after all, ships present a much bigger target from the side, so hitting them amidships has got be easier, right?). And if the <i>Masquerade</i> survives the first blow then she&#39;ll be able to fight back.<br><br>The only thing I can think of off the top of my head that would stand a reasonable chance is something much more massive, that could soak up the kind of punishment a Medusa can dish out, and would actually have a chance to learn about her peculiarities while still being combat effective. Maybe some of the Titans from <i>EVE Online</i>? I dunno, I tend to lose interest in the supermassive stuff. <br><br>- Irish</h1>

            <p>The gravity bands are... well... gravity! That&#39;s gonna have some kind of impact when they hit something massive, even if it&#39;s only the object&#39;s own gravity (and a 7-km ship will definitely have that, even without gravity generation) distorting the field.<br><br>Also: I wasn&#39;t joking about the <i>Masquerade</i> and the ISD being evenly-matched. A Medusa has <i>no</i> shielding at her bow and stern, and a Star Destroyer has bombers. Can you imagine the damage a proton torpedo could do if it got inside the inner hull? Yikes!<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure an ISD&#39;s turbolasers could burn through her sidewalls, too: they&#39;re basically just shields. The problem for the Imperials was simply that they use a mode of combat that has become outdated in the Honorverse.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, if you want to find more characters like this I&#39;d suggest looking at the tropes, and sub-pages of, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> and <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well Intentioned Extremist</a>, maybe even <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> depending on your point of view. <br><br>Also, while it&#39;s not quite what you&#39;ve asked for, there are a number of times where actual villains have teamed up with the heroes of a series in order to take down a worse villain. See <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalsTeamUp">Rivals Team Up</a>, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> and <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">Teeth Clenched Teamwork</a> for examples of that kind of thing.  <br><br>The few characters that immediately sprang to my mind were:<br><b>Sergeant Schlock</b>, from the webcomic <i>Schlock Mercenary</i> (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of Tagon&#39;s Toughs). On the &#39;hero&#39; side, they have saved people, planets and even had a hand in saving the galaxy one time. On the &#39;less-heroic&#39; side, they usually only do that stuff because they&#39;re getting paid for it, frequently use violence as a <i>first</i> resort, and aren&#39;t always that concerned about collateral damage. <br><br>Their skills can generally be summed up as &#39;breaking people and hurting things&#39; (or maybe the other way around), and most of them enjoy the pretty lights caused by massive explosions. <br><br>Having said that, some of them have managed some truly heroic feats when their friends were in danger. Other than that, they <i>can</i> be heroic, but usually only if they&#39;re getting paid to be heroic. Tagon&#39;s priorities are 1) survive in order to get paid, 2) get paid, 3) client satisfaction. <br><br><b>Belkar Bitterleaf</b>, from the webcomic <i>Order of the Stick</i>. He is a member of an adventuring party that is one of the few groups actively trying to save the world from impending doom, but his alignment is Chaotic Evil. For the most part, he only really cares about himself (and, later on, his cat) and occasionally suggests plans for dealing with obstacles/distractions which are very efficient, but morally wrong. The rest of the party tends to stop him from actually acting on his villainous impulses though.  <br><br><b>Amanda Waller</b>, from the DC universe. She runs Task Force X, a.k.a. the Suicide Squad - a group of not-even-slightly-reformed supervillains that she (barely) keeps in control through the use of explosive collars. <br><br>The Squad only tends to get used against targets that are even worse than normal, or in situations where sending regular forces would just be sending them to their deaths, so she does do good, but her actions are completely illegal and immoral. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>You can count any player character who can potentially act evil, even if it&#39;s not necessarily the &#39;canon&#39; route. Let&#39;s take The Lone Wanderer, from Fallout 3. Essentially the chosen one in all but name, you can save the day, even if you sell fifty people into slavery, murder your way across the wastes, peddle more drugs than the Los Zetas, or just kill people so you can eat them. Sounds pretty villainous, no?

            <p>Antiheros are about the thick grey line between hero and villain. A sleazy used car salesman who would sell his own mother for a nickle is not exactly a hero, right? He&#39;s a jerk, but not really a villain. What you&#39;re talking about is known on TV Tropes as a &#39;Nominal Hero&#39; AKA the person who fights on the same side as the heroes, but for completely non-heroic reasons. The Unscrupulous Hero is the type who acts like a villain, but fights for good with heroic motivations. Certainly a type of antihero, but not the only one.</p>

            <p>Late-ish response, but still.<br><br>I&#39;ve thought of doing a ponies mission, although it&#39;d have to be either a cowrite or done with a consultant--I&#39;ve seen all of, oh, one episode ever. I do, however, want to see Kozar as a pony--or Dawn, or both, aaah--and watching agents flail around in a continuum they don&#39;t know (crossed with one they do know, if they&#39;re DIC) sounds like a lot of fun. I don&#39;t currently have a candidate, though.<br><br>As for the wated, to add to what Scape said: it seems to act rather a lot like a tribble in that it shrieks at Klingons. As it looks like a (black, I think?) tribble with fangs...Klingons react to it in much the same way as they do to tribbles, at least going by Kozar.</p>

But yeah, no, generally it is considered logical and polite to at least have the intention of reading the mission (unless you&#39;re joining a side discussion that&#39;s sprung up in the same thread, that happens here and there). I hadn&#39;t realized you (N. Harmonik) hadn&#39;t read it, which was why I was confused--this was an earlier mission. It actually takes place some weeks or a month after Cale Seche. If anything, I would have expected a comment about playing Taps on the LMM/Picking Up the Pieces combo, considering what happens there, and it&#39;s so exciting to be able to say that now, because it&#39;s no longer spoilers :D<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I&#39;m starting to get confused about the povs. I originally thought that they were sorta related to the bads, in that they&#39;re creatures spawned from misspellings. But why did &quot;Rogue&#39;s POV&quot; create a pov in this mission? <br><br>IIRC, originally povs were created because the badfic writer wrote &quot;pov&quot;, all lowercase. And I understand how, in a previous mission (I believe it was a SkarmorySilver cowrite), a pov was created when the writer wrote &quot;[name] POV&quot;, no possessive.But what&#39;s the deal here?<br><br>And on a broader note, how <i>should</i> one mark a change in point of view?</p>

            <p>Of course there should be some scene divider, or a new chapter, but point-of-view tags are offending.<br><br>Supposed I showed the readers Mafalda Hopkirk sitting in the Trace room, watching the Trace report of the Battle of the DOM and organizing counter measures. Then, after a scene divider, I show the readers Constable Bulstrode taking the elevators down to the Atrium and walking to the watchwizards security desk. Why on earth should I tell the readers that the first scene is &quot;Hopkirk’s POV&quot; and the second scene is &quot;Bulstrode’s POV&quot;?<br><br>It’s a bit trickier with First Person. For one, the tone of the narration should change, showing that another person is narrating now. Then, the readers should get clues from the narration. They hopefully still remember whom Hopkirk sent down to the Atrium in the last scene (but I may pull off a surprise by having another narrator also going down their).<br><br>So, I would put up point-of-view tags because I don’t trust my reader’s ability to understand what’s going on there in plain sight? Or because I don’t trust my ability to show what’s going on in the narrative (in which case I should continue writing to improve my skills, but I probably shouldn’t go public yet)? Or because I’m too lazy to even try? Can there be any other reason?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>They&#39;re there because it&#39;s funny. Povs are little skittery scuttly fluffy things that hide on top of a canon&#39;s head. They go snrf. Big POVs are similar; however, they just hide behind the canon in question. Or rather, since they&#39;re about the size of a steroidal wildebeest (though most of it is floof, like a giant angora rabbit), they TRY to hide behind them. I find this funny. YMMV. =]</p>

            <p>About 25 or so hours after your last call post, I realized that Kozar with a fire-lizard sounded awesome. Blame autocorrect--it kept putting in his name, so that I was talking about fire-kozars instead of fire-lizards. So I started thinking, but by then it was too late.<br><br>Anyway. If you <i>do</i> end up with extra eggs in the end, I&#39;m happy to claim one for Kozar. Klingon with a fire-lizard--what&#39;s not to like? I expect Victoria&#39;s Pov might get jealous, too, which could be hilarious.<br><br>...which reminds me: at some point, someone should definitely write about an agent who adopts a POV rather than a pov.

            <p>I think I&#39;ve got about as many bids as eggs at this point (12 now, if you missed that), so I&#39;m gonna call an end to the bidding <b>24 hours from the time of this post</b>. Get &#39;em in before then, or you&#39;re out of luck!<br><br>Also note that I&#39;m setting a couple rules as of now in case I end up with <i>more</i> bids than eggs:<br><br>1. Infrastructure agents get priority. This is purely for in-universe reasons: they&#39;ll have an easier time caring for their new friends, training them, etc. Also, Action agents aren&#39;t supposed to take pets on missions, and fire-lizards will make that pretty difficult (though not impossible). From an out-of-universe perspective, though, I demand stories of fire-lizards making trouble for their Action owners in the field. It should be fun. *eg*<br><br>2. One egg per Boarder. I think everyone got this intuitively, but just so it&#39;s clear. {= ) (I may go back on this if I&#39;m figuring wrong and I end up with an extra egg or two.)<br><br>If it comes down to deciding who&#39;s in and who&#39;s out, it&#39;ll be purely from an in-universe standpoint. So, that&#39;s who has a better bid and who&#39;s more emotionally stable and responsible. Familiarity with Pern is a bonus.<br><br>Oh, and characters with real people behind them get priority, too, so if it&#39;s a choice between the Lichen and a player character, the PC wins.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I&#39;ve been around since late 2006 and have never been stuck in FicPsych for an extended stay (that is, my level of insanity is within the accepted range for agents and has stayed there for the past 8 and a half years. Wow, time flies). That should speak for my mental stability. I used to be a big fan of the Pern series, too; I read more of the books than I can count on two hands. I wouldn&#39;t say I remember everything I read, but I&#39;m sure I can find the resources to fill in the gaps--wikis, books, that sort of thing. I&#39;m good with research. I also have a good history with animals and minis of varying sorts: we had pet rabbits and pet guinea pigs before I joined the PPC, and I currently live with several minis, a pov, and a tribble. We all get along pretty well, too. You can meet some or all of them, if you like.<br><br>As for trades...I&#39;m not <i>completely</i> sure what sort of things you prefer, but maybe one or more of these will interest you. If not, feel free to let me know what sort of thing you&#39;re looking for, and I&#39;ll see what I have--I&#39;ve collected a lot of odds and ends.<br><br>I can offer you:<br><br>-A Tortall-verse sword, Carthaki steel blade (ridiculous Sue, thought she could steal Jon from Thayet--but her weaponry wasn&#39;t bad.)<br><br>-One of those medical scanner things from <i>Star Trek: TOS</i> (you know, those things that Dr. McCoy uses that were actually pepper shakers or somesuch. This one has a tendency to get bleen stripes when scanning Vulcans, but otherwise seems to work perfectly. Can be calibrated for out of universe aliens if you know how, I expect.)<br><br>-A tribble. Or several. (Not currently, uh, born, but if you want one or several I can feed my tribble a very, very small amount of whatever&#39;s lying around. That should do it.)<br><br>-<i>Torchwood</i>-verse Retcon. (Very useful if your neuralyzer stops working--they&#39;re amnesia pills. Once swallowed, the person gets sleepy--well, with the mix I have, anyway, there&#39;s a mild sedative included--and when they wake up, they&#39;ve forgotten however much time you calculated the dose for. Can be dissolved in liquid.)<br><br>-A Quick-Quotes Quill. (To quote the HP Lexicon: &quot;A quill that is enchanted to be set up on a sheet of paper without human support, which when activated will write an exaggerated account of whatever is said in its presence.&quot; Very fun to use if you&#39;re charging a Sue or replacement who&#39;s been using really purple prose.)<br><br>-Three dragon scales from the Enchanted Forest Chronicles, green and gold. (Not much practical use, but very pretty. Also useful as bookmarks and coasters.)<br><br>-Crocheted scarves. (Made by me. I have some extras by now. I tend to just use whatever yarn I had with me or could find, so the color combinations are odd on some of them, but they&#39;re nice and warm and they aren&#39;t itchy. The yarn is mostly nice quality too.)<br><br>Again, if none of those are things you&#39;re interested in, let me know what sort of thing you&#39;re looking for and I&#39;ll see what I can dig up.<br><br>Yrs sincerely,<br>Agent Dawn McKenna<br><br>--<br>((Hopefully this is coming in before the 24 hours are up. I can&#39;t quite tell what time zone the Board is set on. I&#39;d also like to add that Dawn can be serious: a lot of the craziness goes towards missions, and can be dropped, especially when she&#39;s put in charge of something or someone. Especially a child of any sort. She just...generally does prefer to run around grinning maniacally and quoting everything in sight. I&#39;m also fairly sure she&#39;s been going to FicPsych to chat for years now; she tried it reluctantly a while back, probably at T&#39;Zar&#39;s urging, and found it was helpful. So she&#39;s pretty far from flamethrower-crazy. She&#39;s pretty responsible overall, and adores anything that is fluffy or dragon-like. She will probably get bouncy at some point during the hatching, of course, assuming her bid gets accepted :)<br><br>Also? I really, really, really want to see someone write a charge list using a Quick-Quotes Quill. That would be hilarious.<br><br>Anyway. Here goes!<br><br>~DF))</p>

            <p>I am obliged to inform you of a request for one of your eggs from my associate, Wobbles the Clown. As you may or may not be aware, Wobbles is a television presenter and friend to all children, however violent, dull-witted, or sticky. Upon hearing of your advertisement, she was filled with joy at the prospect of having a &quot;real-life Puff the Magic Dragon&quot; to act as a pet on her delightful program. When considering this request, I urge you not only to think of the love she can give it, but also how loved it will be by all the little children of the Nursery, her colleagues in the A/V Division and NutMint, and everyone with whom she works.<br><br>Payment will be provided in the form of all paperwork, Stores requests, and similar unpleasantnesses being comprehensively expedited for one calendar year as of the date of the transaction. Additionally, compromising photographs of LOs of your choice will be made available from the A/V Division&#39;s aborted &quot;Canons After Dark&quot; program (please see attached file for a comprehensive list of canon characters).<br><br>Finally, to preemptively answer the question of why my colleague has not contacted you directly, her condition (acute arcane technometaplasia) prevents her from operating anything more mechanically complex than a buttonhole flower that squirts water at the unwary. It therefore falls to me to act as a go-between.

She felt, and Wobbles concurred, that a more tangible benefit would be agreeable to you, rather than the miscellany of Suvian gimcracks that people are on record as offering in similar situations, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that they declined to swipe anything from their previous missions, with the exception of a Suvian AAT-mutated combat toaster currently being studied by our mutual friends in. I agree with the Notary, for my part -- something I&#39;m given to understand happens rather rarely. I&#39;ll ding her presently<br><br>Thank you for reading,<br>Barney Bradstow-Chapman,<br>Director of Children&#39;s Programming, A/V Division.<br><br>---<br><br>To: Agent Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill, DIC<br>From: Spinel Promotor Notary, Continuity Council of Gallifrey-In-Exile [rassilonssaggylefttesticleanyonebuther.console2A5B9C05A1E1.rc1875.DF]<br>CC: Jennifer Robinson [jrobinson.console3114ps94394fp42865.rcC-14.FICPSYCH]<br><br>Agent Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill<br><br>I am given to understand that you have considered my offer and not found it wanting. This is well. I do not personally believe that the accumulated gimcracks of a career in canon maintenance is acceptable as trade goods for a living being, but I understand that I am very much in the minority here, with my colleague in the majority. She wanted to give Agent Supernumerary and his children, if any, a guest spot on her program; I managed to dissuade her. I will assume a note of thanks is in the post.<br><br>To clarify my basic position in this matter, I am willing to correct clerical errors, expedite them, make sure they are read, offer assistance in bureaucratic preferred styles and the navigation of the PPC&#39;s comparatively simplistic filing system, and ensure that any and all censures are delayed, held back, sent to the wrong subcommittee, sent to the right subcommittee from the wrong supracommittee, lost, found, lost again, and buried in a peat bog for nine months. Do forgive my lapse into human media for that reference; the clown has been on at me to engage more readily with &quot;World One&quot; culture, and I am deathly afraid that some of the mud thrown at my proverbial wall is beginning to stick. This will last for one calendar year as of the transaction. A full list of services is available in the attached file marked 15-B.<br><br>Finally, I am extremely gratified to be remembered by yourself and your partner.

However, it&#39;s not him doing it; the Notary is merely <i>au fait</i> with his style and is capable of mimicking it. Did you really think she&#39;s not capable of making an ICEP message look like it came from somewhere else? <sup>_~<br><br>Also,</sup> this is part of the backup plan. It makes her seem slightly less monstrous if she was offering to do it for her partner, but afraid that her reputation might cause her (quite rightly) to be ignored. Would anyone believe her if she said right off the bat that she was doing it for Wobbles? Of course not. However, if you reframe the conversation thus, her reputation works to her advantage. The only snag is that she&#39;ll have to bring the clown along to the Impression.<br><br>Finally, convert the alphanumeric string in the Notary&#39;s console string from base-16 to base-36.

I don&#39;t own the physical books that detail Alleb&#39;s home universe. I have them in audiobook format, so I can&#39;t search for information. The books have a wiki, but it&#39;s not detailed. Therefore, disclaimer: Everything I say about the Realm&#39;s dragons ought to be taken with a grain of salt.))<br><br>The Realm&#39;s dragons are, from what I know of other dragons, fairly standard. The Blues I tended were used by messengers, and known for their speed and stamina. Their roars are very loud, their fire hot, and their wings wide. Some of them are quite temperamental, and I think my experiences with them have prepared me for anything a fire-lizard might do. <br><br>I am afraid that my partner is as unsure of the items as I am. He does not know the value of my daggers in your modern currency, and as to &quot;purebred companion animals,&quot; well, here is what he said: <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t rightly know what she* means. Any dog&#39;s a good dog so long as it earns its keep.&quot; <br><br>The price of the daggers is... somewhat hard to place. They were made as a favor to my uncle, and given to me as a gift, so I do not know how much gold they might be sold for. But, if I understand rightly, I believe the deal is fair. Jesse says he doesn&#39;t want a fire-lizard for himself, so only one dagger need be bartered. <br><br>A pamphlet would be lovely, <br><br>Agent Alleb. <br><br>((*I know Ilraen is male, but Jesse&#39;s just arrived from the Civil War, and the name sounds feminine to him. That&#39;s also why he&#39;s useless with the money exchange; he&#39;s still freaking out about how much a bag of flour costs.)) </p>

            <p>Alex has a couple of pieces of Sue-tech he&#39;d be willing to trade, such as a freeze gun he dismantled and put back together so it was less likely to fall apart, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;s got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricorder">tricorder</a> waiting for repairs as well.

            <p>It seems that in canon, wild gold clutch sizes ranged from 21 to over 50 (though the latter may have been retconned in later books).<br><br>Even 20 seems like rather a lot for HQ. In the wild, you&#39;d want a large clutch to overcome the high mortality rate seen when Menolly Impressed, but perhaps Hera has gotten the idea that this isn&#39;t necessary? Or, with just Ilwion around to fly her, maybe her flights simply aren&#39;t all that energetic. What about 12?

            <p>Hello everybody! Is there, perchance, a Dutch speaker here? I have a few questions about the language. To explain: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Navare">Navare</a> uses the <a href="http://gamesverse.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Kabupatenic_(style)">Kabupatenic</a> style of MGLN-verse magic, which is analogous to Dutch.

            <p>Let me preface this by saying that the Rose Potter and C*l*br**n missions have my highest respect. No way <i>I</i> could read through either fics, even for sporking. They&#39;re the most notable missions we have, which is why they&#39;re often seen on the sidebar of the wiki. <br><br>But...<br><br>Is there any chance that we could change their images? I get that the pictures are meant to convey the content of the article, but even though they&#39;re not explicit I always try to cover up their part of the screen. It would also be <i>supremely</i> awkward to try and explain what they mean to a non-Boarder, or to have someone see them over my shoulder.

            <p>On a personal level, if you have Adblock, you can also use it to block specific images.  There should be an option to do that if you right-click them.<br><br>I think the images work, and it&#39;s probably okay to have them on the wikipages themselves, since they&#39;re already tagged as NSFW.

            <p>I&#39;ve no problems with NSFW pictures on pages marked as such, but the fact that some of them pop up in pages that are supposed to be SFW is problematic.

            <p>I&#39;m fairly certain that all minis from a single continuum are the same, although there&#39;s one sort-of-exception. There are five different minis for <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender.</i> As far as I know, any M-e fic, regardless of the original work it&#39;s based on, will use mini-Balrogs. <br><br>However, I&#39;m still rather new, so an older Boarder might know of other exceptions or loopholes. <br><br>Speaking of being new, have you looked at our Sib Houses? We have an <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sib_Houses">article</a> on the wiki; basically, an older PPCer will &quot;adopt&quot; a new one, to help them learn their way around the community. My personal Big Sib is Iximaz. We exchanged email addresses, and that&#39;s about all you have to do. Are you interested? </p>

            <p>Iximaz ninja&#39;d me on the base issue, but it&#39;s slightly more complicated than that.  Many agents, such as Jay and Acacia, are from &quot;World One,&quot; a mildly fictionalized version of the Real World.  Other agents come from unpublished works of fiction, such as Mittens and the Radioactive Moss Creature.  Some agents even come from AU versions of the Real World, like Agent!Des.  That said, you should probably have some idea of what the setting your character comes from is like, just to flesh out their backstory.<br><br>Unless you have some very specific reasons for asking your questions, I&#39;d recommend spending more time going through the wiki and just reading whatever comes up that looks interesting.  That&#39;s how I got into the PPC at first, and it&#39;s a good way to learn the details of the canon.

            <p>Lots of people use characters they&#39;ve created for their own stories but ended up not using.  It can be a good way to develop them.

            <p>I&#39;ll second Tira&#39;s advice to spend more time reading stuff on the wiki, and I&#39;ll add that you should allow it to lead you to missions and other PPC stories, too.

            <p>You really need to read those, since after all that&#39;s the canon we&#39;re writing from. Aside from that, I mostly just read whichever ones look interesting from the fandoms I know.  Neshomeh&#39;s spin-offs are really good, and I&#39;d definitely recommend Trojie and Pads&#39; missions if you want to get into Bad Slash.</p>

            <p>As it depends, for the most part, on just how different the remake is, compared to the original.<br>Also, I think that most people won&#39;t mission a story again.

<li>The structure of the codes is explained on the relevant wiki page. They&#39;re picked by anyone who feels like it, basically. There isn&#39;t a full list because not many people have bothered.<br><br>2. Hard to say. Missions usually end before the actual fic does, <i>especially</i> if it&#39;s a really long fic. You&#39;d probably have to do some serious research to find that out. Or, do you mean what&#39;s the longest mission to a single fic? ...

            <p>...Is it bad that Rina&#39;s starting to scare me a little now? Cause she is. I hope she gets some help soon. (The joke about Rina&#39;s guinea pig was great, by the way, well done.)<br><br>Some things I noticed:<br><i>“...hiding from the Silence on the streets of New York.” Rina recited.</i><br>That period after &quot;New York&quot; should be a comma.<br><br><i>“No, seriously, who the </i>flying ...nuggets is Victoria?<i>”</i><br>According to Wikipedia, Victoria (Waterfield) was a companion during the Second Doctor era. She first appears in &quot;The Evil of the Daleks,&quot; where her scientist dad&#39;s time travel experiments attracted Dalek notice. What I don&#39;t understand is how a Suethor knows about Susan (who actually <i>was</i> the Doctor&#39;s granddaughter) but not about any other Classic Who companions. *shrugs*<br><br><i>His partner’s behavior was just going to have to wait.</i><br>Abrupt ending is abrupt. I assume there&#39;s a part two forthcoming?</p>

            <p>1) That was reciting the badfic, and it ended on a period. Thus the full stop.<br><br>2) I knew that, but the fact that the Doctor was referring to her as his granddaughter made me &#39;wat&#39;.

            <p>It&#39;s acceptable to change periods to commas and vice-versa for the sake of grammar, at least in the Chicago style. Alternatively, you could set the quote in normal-weight font and surround it with single quotes, then place the comma outside the single quotes but still within the double-quotes for Rina&#39;s speech.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yeah, &#39;X species attacks/invades Earth&#39; is pretty much the bread-and-butter of lots of <i>Doctor Who</i> plots. These can, however, be broken down into a few broad categories:<br><br>1. They want to wipe out humanity for TEH EVULZ. <br><br>2. They want to use the Earth as a resource for something, and humans are just getting in the way. <br><br>3. They want to use the humans as the resources. <br><br>4. They just happened to crash-land and ended up getting stranded, and humans mistook it for an invasion.<br><br>5. They don&#39;t possess the intelligence necessary to realize that what they&#39;re doing is wrong, and attack people simply because it&#39;s their instinct to find food.<br><br>And a puzzle can be anything, from hacking into a computer to figuring out the aliens&#39; motive(s). Puzzles aren&#39;t confined to just riddles and physical interlocking pieces, after all. :)</p>

            <p>So first, you don&#39;t  wanna make anything too complex, or try to write the next Sherlock Holmes, especially if it&#39;s your first time. And maybe the aliens are invading because they need to take a dump and their toilets are broken. I dunno, I don&#39;t watch Doctor who.</p>

            <p>And, uh, no clue. In <i>Supernatural</i> the monsters certainly move around, but there&#39;s generally a reason for it, generally something to do with modernization. However, these awswang...would probably not be aliens? Unless they inspired the myths? Myth inspiration sounds rather DW-ish. I don&#39;t know anything about the monsters themselves, of course, but you&#39;d need to find a reason for them to have appeared in the first place, a reason why they didn&#39;t stick around, and a reason why they&#39;re back.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Is it just me, or have there been more stories posted than usual recently? I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not used to seeing so many Missions and Interludes out all at once :) <br><br>So, the inspiration for this piece came from a conversation a couple of weeks ago which suggested that the PPC using autonomous attach drones wouldn&#39;t make for an entertaining story.

            <p>That wasn&#39;t actually meant to be an HK-47 reference - it was supposed to be a reference to <i>Schlock Mercenary</i> (the continuum that the mission ostensibly took place in).

<br><br>Amy walked back in to her RC to see Skeet glaring at the console as if it had just insulted his mother. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br><br>Skeet gestured at the console screen. &quot;Oh, just someone trying to ruin another happy memory from my childhood.&quot;<br><br>Amy frowned to herself, wishing that her partner would be a little more consistent with his facial expressions. &quot;What canon?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Thunderbirds</i>,&quot; Skeet said. &quot;You ever watch it?&quot;<br><br>Amy shrugged. &quot;A little.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I watched it a lot. And the others, like <i>Stingray</i> and <i>Captain Scarlet</i>. And the recent reboot isn&#39;t bad, but this...&quot; Skeet gestured at the console again. &quot;This just doesn&#39;t sound good. Grab us each a pistol, would you?&quot;<br><br>Amy fetch a pair of weapons, while Skeet pressed buttons seemingly at random. <br><br>Amy was waiting by the wall when Skeet pressed the final button, which usually resulted in a portal for them to walk through. On this occasion, however, Amy was left staring at a blank wall.<br><br>&quot;Um, Skeet, I think our portal generator might be broken again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What? Oh, no, you don&#39;t think we&#39;d start a <i>Thunderbirds</i> mission by just walking through a hole in the wall, do you?&quot; Skeet was on the other side of the RC, near the bookshelves. <br><br>He reached out and grabbed one of the books, &#39;Secret Rooms and Hidden Passages: An Observer&#39;s Guide&#39;, and tipped it back slightly. <br><br>The bookshelf began sinking into the floor, revealing a hidden compartment behind it.<br><br><b>[5]</b>
<br><br>&quot;Argh!&quot; Amy jumped back in surprise, loosing her balance. &quot;Was that the console?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yup.&quot; Skeet grinned. &quot;I added a little to the programming.&quot;<br><br><b>[4]</b>
<br><br>Amy picked herself up and joined her partner by the bookcase, just as it slid out view entirely. <br><br>The small alcove that had been revealed contained a pair of harnesses, that looked sort of like the safety harnesses for a rollercoaster. <br><br><b>[3]</b>
<br><br>Skeet took the right one, and Amy took the left. Once they were both in position, the harnesses clamped down on their shoulders. <br><br><b>[2]</b>
<br><br>The floor and wall jerked slightly, then the whole assembly moved up and over, tipping the agents so that they were lying on their backs, head first pointing down a slope. At the bottom of the slope was the telltale blue glow of a portal.<br><br>&quot;Waaaah!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Relax, Amy, you&#39;ve got nothing to worry about.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh yeah? Then next time we get tipped upside down, <i>you</i> can wear a skirt!&quot;<br><br><b>[1]</b>
<br><br>Skeet looked across at his partner, as she tried to preserve her modesty. &quot;Riiiight, sorry about that.&quot;<br><br><b>[Thunderbirds are go!]</b>
<br><br>Amy glared at Skeet, and was just about to reply when the clamps released, and they were both sent hurtling down the slide. <br><br>A/N: I take no responsibility for this whatsoever. <i>Thunderbirds</i> was created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. <br></p>

            <p>Since I joined the PPC two years ago, <ul>
<li>I talked on the Board<br>
</li>
<li>I played with bad ideas in the badfic games  <br>
</li>
<li>I began building my agents in writing exercises<br>
</li>
<li>I edited the Wiki<br>
</li>
<li>I beta read (not as often as I should)<br>
</li>
<li>I was shipped in the Shipfic Fest<br>

<li>I worked on the &quot;Lost Tales&quot; archive<br>
</li>
<li>I tried role-playing in Plort (and nearly talked my <i>alter ego</i>’s head off)<br>
</li>
</ul>
<br>Guess what I never did?<ul>
<li>Chat on the IRC? No, that’s not what I meant. I’m still waiting for the big Ypur feast in La Wunj.<br>
</li>
<li>Ask for Permission? It’s on my schedule, but it’s further down than &quot;Retire from my job&quot;, and this may still take some time.<br>
</li>
<li>Sign the Constitution? Now that you remind me... procrastinate, procrastinate. Isn’t it sufficient that I signed the last two amendments? I may still need something to do for next years celebration...<br>

<br>I actually never wrote fanfiction.

            <p>But you may want to reconsider all the Death Eater’s spells registering on the Trace. Remember that Wormtail and Voldemort got away with casting Unforgivables in Harry’s presence on Little Hangleton’s  graveyard in GOF. Apparently distance matters.<br><br>The Snowdrop, Head of Department, Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies<br><br>-------------------<br><br>I did remember, and I theorized that they always kept enough distance from Harry, but I didn’t check until now. And now I may have caught JKR making a mistake, in GOF chapter 32:<br><br><i>It [the hooded figure who was Peter Pettigrew] stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only <b>six feet</b> from them [Cedric and Harry].</i><br><br>And yet, when Wormtail casted an unforgivable killing curse so close to Harry, no Aurors apparated to the graveyard to arrest the murderer? How did this not register on the Trace?<br><br>On the next page, Wormtail dragged Harry to the marble headstone on Tom Riddles grave and conjured <i>tight cords around Harry, tying him from head to ankles to the headstone</i>. <br><br>Well, using this spell near a kid on a graveyard may not be sufficiently suspicious to justify an immediate investigation.<br><br><i>Cedric’s body was lying <b>some twenty feet</b> away.</i><br><br>How did he move? Last page, he was six feet away from the marble headstone, <i>lying spread-eagled on the ground beside [Harry]</i>. <br><br>So I’m not sure whether six feet or twenty feet from the nearest kid is sufficiently far away to escape being traced. <br><br>Anyway, the trio was near the other end of the time room – which is not small – when a Death Eater opened the door. This <i>Alohomora</i> should not be on the Trace’s report. <br><br>Also, Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters trying to stun Harry’s friends across the round room with twelve doors were probably too far away to be detected by the Trace.<br><br>But I believe that everything else is either sufficiently vague or justifiable.<br><br>And sorry for breaking the bad news to Ixi and Matt – apparently I’m the biggest <i>Harry Potter</i> nerd around.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Sorry, this sounds too much like a hand-wavy &quot;everything’s possible with magic&quot;, when the books clearly show that this isn’t true.<br><br>If you could point me to a hint that the trace can be fooled by powerful wizards, or that Dumbledore side-by-side-apparating with Harry could not be traced, or if characters in DH had talked about how easy it would be to get Harry out of 4PD again if Dumbledore were still there and jammed the Trace, then I would buy &quot;Babymort set up wards around the graveyard&quot; as JKR’s explanation.<br><br>But apparently only him being able to do this, when he wasn’t even on the height of his power, without any foreshadowing (or aftershadowing)?

            <p>This is one of the reasons why I assumed that the Trace doesn’t tell names. In CS, Mafalda Hopkirk didn’t know that the Hover Charm had been performed by Dobby. But the Trace may still have reported something like<br><br>Hover charm performed <b>near Harry Potter</b> at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging.<br><br>When Tom Riddle and his parents had been killed, nobody bothered to look for the – probably traumatized – under-aged witness who must have triggered the Trace. They had a suspect, and Morfin Gaunt confessed immediately, so they didn’t need the witness’s testimony.<br><br>I don’t like to imagine that they didn’t care although they knew the &quot;witness’s&quot; name and could guess that he was related to the victims, not just a passer-by. But even if the Trace reported <br><br>Three UNFORGIVABLE KILLING CURSES performed <b>near Tom Marvolo Riddle</b> at the Riddle House, Little Hangleton<br><br>nobody would have suspected that the supposed witness had actually been the murderer.<br><br>Concerning the Order of the Phoenix getting Harry out of Privet Drive to Grimauld Place, the Advance Guard had to wait for a specific time, four days after the Dementors’ attack. It seems quite obvious to me that, at this time, a member or associate of the Order was on duty at the Trace, determined to ignore any reports from Little Whinging (and possibly to destroy the printed evidence).<br> <br>HG</p>

            <p>I especially love what you did with the POVS. *snrf* I quite enjoyed the mission, and though I&#39;m only familiar with <i>Percy Jackson,</i> I didn&#39;t feel totally lost all of the time. Two things, though. <br><br><i>“Hello, Chiron POV. “Wow. Does canon!Dionysus mess up names to that level, or is this just Flanderization? And Chiron rolling his eyes - that doesn’t seem quite in character for a centaur older than every modern civilization.”</i><br><br>Extra quotation mark. <br><br><i>“And how does Bianca’s soul show up on the map?” asked Theia, incredulity evident in each syllable</i><br><br>I thought for a moment that another agent had somehow come along and just escaped my notice up to that point, but she&#39;s not mentioned anywhere else. </p>

            <p>So, I&#39;ve been working on Carnage and Sesrik (My new Thin Man agent and Carnage&#39;s partner), and I was wondering if someone could look them over and see what needs improving.

            <p>My main question with Carnage is not &quot;Why a dragon?&quot; or &quot;Why a monster?&quot;, but &quot;Why a <i>kaijuu</i>?&quot;  The vulnerability to cold in particular is extremely characteristic of a red dragon in D&amp;D and related games.  I feel like that should at least be referenced somewhere as an inspiration.  Honestly, I&#39;m not sure what the kaijuu elements add, except as a reference to his somewhat overly complex backstory.  The other thing I find off-putting is the sheer length of his powers section - it&#39;s longer than both the personality and bio sections.  I know dragons are dangerous, but it seems a little excessive.  I don&#39;t think he needs pyrokinesis AND thermal manipulation AND fire-breathing.  Finally, I don&#39;t really understand why he hated humans.  Because they&#39;re greedy and bad for the environment?  Because he wants to conquer the world and they&#39;re in his way?  I know he&#39;s technically an ex-Stu, so sensible motivations might not always be a factor, but I&#39;m concerned that might intrude on Sesrik&#39;s schtick.</p>

            <p>A DND red dragon would work with the backstory - Carnage is supposed to be from a crossover with MLP:FiM, and the reason you get cool monsters showing up in that show all the time is that Hasbro owns the rights to the Monster Manual and similar. A red dragon just works better, and you also have more of the dynamic of old vs. new - which you can&#39;t do with kaiju for reasons I should hope are obvious. =]</p>

            <p>Now that I&#39;ve had the time to look at your agent bios, both together and separately, I&#39;ll spend some time with both general thoughts and each of them. I&#39;ll preface this by saying that I have constructive intents here and I don&#39;t mean to be demeaning. (Of course, my own experience with such a disclaimer implies that some things about your bios don&#39;t sit well with me, but hey, that&#39;s what concrit&#39;s for. <sup><sup>;)<br><br>First</sup></sup> off, Scapegrace is correct in that first-time agents don&#39;t have to be human. Looking at a lot of Permission prompts and starting missions my fellow Boarders have written, I believe the reason so many people go with human agents as a basic &quot;starting kit&quot; is that, as TV Tropes puts it, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman">Most Writers are Human</a>. This means people are much easier to write for us than non-humans are, because we relate to other people much easier than we would a bird made of knives, a nine-foot-tall insect, or for that matter, a fire-breathing dragon. We tend to see monsters as, well, things, and not characters, which is why so many horror movies nowadays don&#39;t leave a lasting impression. I think the scare could be greater if you can relate to the creature in some way. On a broader scale, unless you start with a species that&#39;s already subject to some degree of anthropomorphism, such as a Pokemon, a non-human agent is a greater challenge than a human one, but has the benefit in that you don&#39;t have to stick to tradition. It&#39;s just a matter of personal taste. I personally find that trying to write a World One agent who stumbled upon the PPC via a plot hole would be boring compared to, say, writing Falchion or Cupid, for example.  (Also worth noting is that Darkotas sent in two non-human agents for Permission as well, a Gungan and a Warcraft ogre I believe.) It&#39;s harder to build a strong base for either of them than for a human, especially a World One agent with a simple tried-and-true formula, but I can say with confidence that it&#39;s not impossible by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>With that being said, I had a look at each of your agents, and I feel that while they could use a little work - okay, a LOT of work - you seem to be off to a good start. I&#39;m not familiar with XCOM, but I had a look at the Thin Men, and the first thing that came to mind was the Uncanny Valley. I&#39;m reminded of the agents from The Matrix movies, but with disturbing proportions, acid breath, and so on. The biggest thing that threw me off with his bio, though, was the lack of a History section. Without it, I couldn&#39;t really picture how he ended up in the PPC in the first place, which is really important if you want to build up his backstory. Suggestions include either going with the old plot hole trick like with Falchion (albeit with a good explanation as to why the plot hole was there in the first place; just having it show up for no reason would sound like an ass-pull to the reader), being found by an agent group in a badfic as with Cupid or Backslash, or else escaping from a badfic like Lapis. You didn&#39;t indicate whether any of these was the case, which really bothered me when I first read the bio, because it made him look as though he only existed to support Carnage (whom I&#39;ll get to in a bit). Every agent has a story to tell, and Sesrik should too if you want him to pass as a solid character. Scape made a good point about the Thin Men being essentially living tools without emotion or honor, so exploring how that would mesh with the PPC and its mix of democracy and comedy would be an interesting path to take. Hey, if Chakkik can do it, perhaps Sesrik can too.<br><br>As for Carnage... I honestly have more problems with him personally, even though I <i>get</i> what you&#39;re trying to do and I can understand why. An agent that&#39;s essentially a shrunken-down kaiju would pose some interesting implications, especially regarding how he now lives among the people he once towered over and within the buildings he used to destroy. <strike>It doesn&#39;t help that I once thought of an Indominus rex replacement as an agent, but I digress.</strike> However, when I looked at his bio, I noticed that it was too long. By itself, it&#39;s not too bad in terms of verbosity - I myself went into quite a bit of detail with both of my starting agents - but what was really jarring for me was that Carnage&#39;s bio was too long <i>relative to Sesrik&#39;s</i>. This is the other reason for my sentiment that the latter came off as only being there to support the former. A massive part of the reason for this is that while his abilities are par for the course as far as kaiju are concerned (many of the ones I&#39;ve created have just as many cool tricks), a human sized <i>kaijin</i> of sorts is a wholly different animal, quite literally so. Carnage could probably wipe half of HQ off the map if he lost his temper, and the bloodlust he has as a &quot;weakness&quot; does not help, especially because if he&#39;s going to be an assassin, he&#39;d have to witness the deaths of every Sue he&#39;ll come across. (I had the same complaint about the bloodlust lobbied against me when I first introduced Rayner; I&#39;ve since been sorting it out, but I must say that it just doesn&#39;t mesh well with how agents work.) Everything else is reasonable, though I would again agree with Scape&#39;s suggestion to make Carnage a Noble Demon of sorts. Kaiju were originally created by war and violence, so it would make sense to have Carnage be born from, well, carnage, and have to live with the consequences. In his case, since he&#39;s burned everything, he has nothing left to do, so it&#39;s only fair that he starts moving down from the top, taking a good long look at the smaller beings he once lorded over and starting to empathize with them. (As for the shrinking thing, don&#39;t worry about it too much - my second DIC mission involved the use of a Shrink Ray to deal with a giant Sonic replacement.)<br>With all that being said, I&#39;d still give him far fewer powers than he has in this version of the bio. If the technology the PPC has can shrink him, getting rid of his more dangerous powers wouldn&#39;t be too much of a stretch. The only powers I&#39;d give him would be his thick, possibly fireproof scales, to contrast with Sesrik&#39;s vulnerability (and even then make him vulnerable to certain things like cold), and his fire breath, because, well, he&#39;s a <i>dragon.</i> Among his weaknesses, I think the bloodlust has to go, unless you can write it sensibly into the PPC like I did with Rayner and that I highly doubt because, well, my poor pony boy has to take meds to <i>suppress</i> his condition. I will reiterate that a bloodthirsty predator does not an agent make.<br><br>As far as final thoughts go, my major piece of advice would be to think carefully about how your characters would work within the setting you&#39;re trying to put them in, as opposed to looking at them within a vacuum. This is a pretty common trap for Sues/Stus in general, and believe me, I myself was guilty of it plenty of times back in the day, as if that angry <i>T. rex</i>!Violet I had slain on my very first mission wasn&#39;t enough of an indicator. The PPC is not, however, a free-for-all, but a coherent and cohesive universe where everyone has their place, use, and limits. It&#39;s important to know in particular what your characters&#39; limits are, and whether they fit the standards of the PPC and its community. I like where you&#39;re headed with your characters, but they need to have their capabilities and mentalities not only defined more clearly but also scaled down very much in order to gel with their peers. As it is, I&#39;m not confident in either of these aspects for either of these agents, and until I see a lot more streamlining and tightening for them both, my hopes that they&#39;ll get a pass when you request Permission are uncomfortably slim.<br><br>Now, then, I wonder if I can get your e-mail? I&#39;d be happy to discuss your agents further and serve as both a sounding board and a beta reader if you need one in the future. :)<br><br>-SS</p>

            <p>Well, first off: Agents that are murder-machines tend to be hard to pull off. It seems like these two are interested in killing Sues because of the killing part, not because of the crimes-against-canon part:<br><br><i>&quot;as a former world conqueror, he views Sues as pathetic amateurs who try and fail to compensate for their lack of finesse with an arsenal of powers that they are incapable of properly using&quot;</i> <br><br>and <br><br><i>&quot;Carnage views Sues as insults to nature itself-they’re a feeble attempt to “improve” their species, but only succeed in bringing out their worst qualities&quot;</i><br><br>It seems like these two don&#39;t have much love for the canon, so why are they are in the PPC? Also, while murder-crazy Agents can show up and work - see Desdendelle&#39;s Amris - they need someone else to hold them back and be a counterpoint. But in this case it seems like these two&#39;d just cause each other to be worse.<br><br>For another thing, it seems like you&#39;re focusing too much on what these guys can do, and not why they do it. Powers are often immaterial in missions, what with disguises and all, and personalities are much more crucial to good agents/<br><br>And finally - dark humor =/= talking about the worst ways to torture Sues. In fact, the actual in-universe PPC has rules against torture, for good reason! And agents who act like that tend to not be very fun to read.<br></p>

            <p>Besides the reasons that other PPCers have listed, there are four other reasons why I chose to make my agents the species that they are:<br><br>1. I wanted my agents to be firsts-just with their species, I&#39;ve just created the PPC&#39;s first agents from both D&amp;D and XCOM.<br><br>2. The badfics I&#39;ve got my eye on involve a lot of powerful Sues and Stus: no less than eleven dragons; a kaiju; a Character Replacement of the Colossal Titan that turns into Crystalak; a colony of xenomorphs, including a replacement of Queen Chrysalis who&#39;s become half-xenomorph, a giant non-canonical xenomorph, and multiple Yautja; and an entire army of changelings led by Queen Chrysalis&#39; &quot;daughter&quot;; some Stu with an Omnitrix and the ability to turn into an Indominus Rex; a legendary Primal Carnage badfic; and an Indominus Rex that somehow ends up in Equestria. To take these things down, I need heavy firepower.<br><br>3. Carnage has been sitting in my head for years, unquestionably a Gary Stu. It&#39;s about time I put him to work.<br><br>4. I run on Dwarf Fortress logic. More monster=more fun to me.</p>

            <p>If these are your first agents, you&#39;ll have a lot more leeway and options within a story if you don&#39;t have to keep shaping things around the size or bestial nature of your agents. Remember that direct conflict with a Sue is maybe a few sentences at best, and aren&#39;t usually the reason people read a mission. You&#39;re going to need enough characterization to last pages upon pages of dialogue, taking charges, and potential interaction with other agents or canons. The Sue is not the direct threat that an agent fights; rather, the influence the Sue has on the canon around them is. And right now... I&#39;m a bit worried your agents in their current state might add to that influence.</p>

            <p>The problem isn&#39;t non-human agents. It&#39;s non-human agents for the sake of powers, monstrosity, etc. The Librarian is a Time Lord because of his origin story and nothing more (though it really helps with his racism, so to speak - so many more reasons to belittle humans when you aren&#39;t one, etc). Amris is a Culture Drone because that&#39;s a different sort of character that has a different mindset and works in different ways.<br>Oh, and apropos Amris: can you guess who are the two major inspirations for him?</p>

            <p>A dragon on the one hand and an alien bioweapon on the other? They&#39;re very different mindsets that work in different ways, both from each other and from the reader.<br><br>If these were my agents - and I know they&#39;re not - I&#39;d write Carnage as a kind of Noble Demon figure, a victorious general who, to (mis)quote Plutarch, &quot;saw the breadth of his domains and wept, for there were no lands left to conquer&quot;. Evil, certainly, but with a strict personal code; unable to so much as countenance deviating from it. Honourable in all his dealings, just evil and with the muscle to back it up.<br><br>Sesrik, on the other hand, is rather different. Thin Men were clearly designed to be infiltrators; sneaks and assassins, carving up government figures, liaising with fifth-columnists like EXALT, and trying to break human resistance from the inside. They&#39;re <i>tools</i>. They don&#39;t feel emotion, because emotion clouds your perspective; they know no honour, because honour limits your options. They are an acid-vomiting, plasma-blasting, incomparably evil clone race; not because of any specific malice, but rather the will to dominate matched with a total indifference to the so-called &quot;rules of war&quot;.<br><br>That&#39;d be an interesting matchup to read about; the agent of aliens and the king of hell, thrust into the last war, the war that will claim them by degrees, the war where there are always more lands left to save. It&#39;d be... possibly a little dark for the setting, but I think if Sesrik&#39;s arc was being introduced to a joke and shaking its hand, they could be a lot of fun.<br><br>But meh, I&#39;m just spitballing. =]</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not a PG, but I took a look at the profiles and I have some thoughts.<br><br>First things first: I&#39;m a bit concerned you&#39;re focusing too much on the &quot;coolness&quot; factor of an agent as opposed to making an agent that is well-rounded. Looking at Carnage, for example, I&#39;m seeing a LOT of things about all the cool things he can do and his combat capabilities, but not a lot about who he is. He seems to be focused around, well... just killing and fighting. That can work, but I&#39;m not seeing enough characterization to compensate. Remember, he isn&#39;t going to be in his natural form most of the time, he&#39;ll be in disguise. Most of those abilities you listed will be moot.<br><br>Sesrik... is a good start. He&#39;s cold calculating, and a former malevolent alien. Okay, cool. But who is he? Why does he stay in the PPC? Having his entire reason be &quot;he likes fighting Sues&quot; won&#39;t really give you a lot of options for stories, IMO. Flesh him out as an individual first, and as an agent second.</p>

            <h1>1: &quot;<i>Department: Floaters</i>&quot;<br>Was he drawn to the DF because it&#39;s vaguely reminiscent of his airborne comrades-in-tentacles? I think you could make a joke out of that.<br><br>#2: &quot;<i>[...]firing at foes with his trusty plasma rifle, the typical weapon for his kind</i>&quot;<br>Thin Men in XCOM: EU use Light Plasma Rifles rather than Plasma Rifles; the former is really more of a carbine than anything else, which is why Long War replaced them with, er, Plasma Carbines. Thin Men with Plasma Rifles really does not bear thinking about. =]<br><br>#2a: Further to this, Thin Men are also incredibly strong - remember that they are extremely accurate with their LPMs and fire them like pistols, despite the fact that the incredibly burly Mutons need to use both. This is something I think worth commenting on, if only to further emphasise Sesrik&#39;s glass cannon nature.<br><br>#3: &quot;<i>He can also unhinge his jaws in a similar fashion to a snake</i>&quot;<br>It&#39;s funny that you use that comparison, since Thin Men were conceived as a replacement for Snakemen.<br><br>#4: &quot;<i>[His] poison breath only works on creatures with a functional respiratory system</i>&quot;<br>That&#39;s not the case. It&#39;s an acid attack; it works, for instance, on SHIVs, and the Chem Grenade (which uses bits of dead Thin Man in its construction) works on Mechtoids, Cyberdiscs, and similar cybernetic, non-breathing foes. I get that you&#39;re trying to balance it, but it&#39;s <i>wrong</i>, and you can find other ways to deal with it.<br><br>#5: &quot;<i>Having little experience with humor, Carnage’s snarks and remarks often sail right over his head</i>&quot;<br>Don&#39;t write Drax the Destroyer. One is plenty.<br><br>#6: There is no rule 6.<br><br>#7: &quot;<i>[...]he views Sues as pathetic amateurs who try and fail to compensate for their lack of finesse with an arsenal of powers that they are incapable of properly using.</i>&quot;<br>I... am conflicted. While I like the idea of him finding the Sues&#39; lack of finesse distasteful - it certainly fits with the Thin Men&#39;s role as infiltrators - I don&#39;t think any agent, however villainously inclined, should sympathise with what the Sues are trying to do, even in an &quot;Aww, it&#39;s Babby&#39;s First Genocidal Conquest&quot; way.<br><br>#8: &quot;<i>the sight of [...] an Ethereal sends him into a blind panic to get away as fast as he can, often requiring his larger partner to get him to calm down.</i>&quot;<br>No. No, this is just flat-out <i>wrong</i>. That&#39;s like being scared to fits of paranoid terror of your <i>line manager</i>. The Ethereals are their bosses/brahmins/generals, depending on who you ask; they&#39;re not the devil. More likely, he&#39;d have to be restrained from prostrating himself before them.<br><br>So, y&#39;know, aside from all that, that&#39;s average. Can&#39;t comment on Carnage because I sort of very slightly don&#39;t care. =]</h1>
