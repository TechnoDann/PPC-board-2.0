            <p>Are you leaving these Easter eggs intentionally because you realized that I may not comment if I don’t find at least one? And everybody else ignores them, because they know that they are for me? Is this a conspiracy?<br><br><i>The Sue begged for him to take <b>him</b> along, and after only minimal argument, he agreed.</i><br>You probably meant &quot;to take her along&quot;.<br><br><i>She already was, biting back a screech of indignation when the canons started asking the Sue if <b>they</b> could tell them about the future in store for them.</i><br>Don’t we know the Sue’s gender? You probably meant &quot;if she could tell&quot;.<br><br>Also, I had a weird experience with this sentence:<br><i>Rina pressed her face into the snow as a wave of out-of-whack time sense-induced nausea hit her.</i><br><br>The apparent necessity to emphasize the time sense induced nausea’s sense-induced nature by connecting these two words with a hyphen forced me to think about it and to look back to remember what sense we are talking about. Apparently it is the time-sense that is out of whack – no, wait, is it the out-of-whack time that – ah, what did it do again?  <br><br>It is impossible to forget what I read and do a real comparison getting the same information for the first time from another version of this sentence, but I feel like &quot;time sense induced nausea&quot; wouldn’t have made me trip and stall like this. Of course this may be a not-being-a-native-reader thing, and other readers may see it differently.<br><br>Huh, a lot of words for such a tiny thing like a hyphen.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>&quot;Time sense&quot; is two words referring to a single concept; thus, if you make a compound word using it, you put a hyphen between the connected words and an n dash between that and the other half of the compound (time-sense–induced). Except possibly if you&#39;re British.<br>If you <i>are</i> British (hS), you do this: &quot;time-sense induced&quot;. I think the British prefer to use as few hyphens as possible.<br>Admittedly these are broad generalisations – different institutions have different house styles – but HG is right; as it stands, what&#39;s there is confusing.</p>

This works particularly well in combination with Tailwind Talonflame, as the massively boosted Speed stat allows it to shatter pretty much everyone in the tier with STAB Stone Edge, assuming you can get it to hit anything.

            <p>I have a tendency to lapse into what I like to call &quot;Thomas was Alone&quot; narration. It&#39;s a rather odd way of narrating where dialog is avoided as much as possible, and the narrator describes how the characters are feeling, along with their surroundings. I&#39;m actively trying <i>not</i> to do this. Is this an okay way to narrate?</p>

But dialogue is a major way to portray character interaction, and it would be very weird if there isn&#39;t any.<br><br>One thing you could try doing if you want to move away from a style you think you overuse is to force yourself to write in the opposite style.  For example, I made myself write a fight scene to get away from Talking Head Syndrome.  So if you think you need to work on adding more dialogue, try doing a scene that&#39;s nothing but dialogue. It&#39;s not necessarily a better style, but it&#39;ll make you branch out.</p>

            <p>Try writing dialogue without using dialogue tags (he said, she shouted, etc.). Instead, show who&#39;s talking by giving them an action. For instance:<br><br>Bob sighed and leaned up against the mossy stone wall. &quot;So, where to next?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I dunno.&quot; Alice sat down cross-legged on the grass and ran a hand through her hair. It got stuck in a tangle and she shook it out with a frown. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, the Sue is off to Isengard, but her stupid pink pegasus is going to have a sappy rendezvous with Shadowfax. If we follow it, maybe we can kill it now.&quot; He grinned, and his hand unconsciously stroked the pommel of his purloined Andúril replica.<br><br>Alice regarded her partner and bit her lip. &quot;You don&#39;t think you&#39;re getting a bit bloodthirsty, do you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who, me? No way! Though I do hear horse steaks are good on the grill, and this one has flight muscles, which ought to be extra-good. If we let the carcass drain properly, that should take care of any excess glitter . . . .&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>I&#39;ll stop there, or this might accidentally turn into a whole story. ^_^; See what I mean, though?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Unless the fic you&#39;re sporking is a) really short (less than four thousand words) and b) really beige, you&#39;d want to quote as little as possible.<br>That said, it&#39;s a case-by-case thing and I can&#39;t say anything else without knowing what you&#39;re talking about. That said, what I usually do - with any fic I come to spork - is C/P its text to a GDoc, read it thoroughly, and note charges in comments; afterwards I try to figure out which charges are important and which charges are so heinous they deserve a quote.</p>

            <p>My general feeling is that if the fic is beige, there&#39;s little point in quoting it, because you&#39;re just making your readers look at something boring; better to restate what happens in your own words and make it funny.<br><br>My principles for what to quote are more or less as follows:<br><br>1. Does the passage illustrate a point I&#39;m making about why the fic is bad?<br>2. Does the audience need to see this nonsense to believe it?<br>3. Is the passage inherently funny?<br><br>If the answer is no to all three, it probably doesn&#39;t need to be quoted. If the answer is yes to at least one, you may wish to quote it. If the answer is yes to all three, it&#39;s probably good to put it in. On the other hand, there are fics like &quot;Blood Raining Night&quot; where just about every line is absurdist comedy gold, so numbers two and three don&#39;t help at all and you have to use more discretion with number one. Don&#39;t want to hammer on the same points too much, after all.<br><br>In the end, you can always fall back on a principle that goes for everything you write: &quot;Does including this help me tell a better story?&quot; If the answer is no, don&#39;t do it. If the answer is yes, go for it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s really hard to judge what&#39;s too much and what&#39;s balanced without actually seeing it.  If you have someone with more mission-writing experience go over it, they can give you more specific advice.<br><br>If I had to give a general suggestion, it would be to restate some of it in your own words, and try to only quote really bad instances that you want to make sure the reader sees.</p>

            <p>I highly encourage you to talk to SkarmorySilver and check out Karalora&#39;s fanfic &quot;Crowns of the Kingdom&quot;. I recommend the fanfic because in addition to an awesome adventure through Disneyland, the author makes sure to let the readers know where she gets her information from at the end of various chapters. That should help you find out more about the parks and stuff. :)</p>

            <p>...the major reason for this being that when I tried getting a Disney OFU to work, even after I asked the Board about it, said attempt at establishing the OFU ended up being inconsistent with... well, everything to do with the PPC, basically. There really isn&#39;t any way I can think of to get an OFU that blanket-covers such a massive collection of various disparate continua to work. Additionally, the closest two things I can think of to a canon Disney mega-crossover would be Kingdom Hearts, which is a continuum of its own which I&#39;m guessing would likely have an OFU already, and Disney Infinity, which has no direct canon transplants and revolves entirely around its Amiibo-like toybox playstyle. (Granted, there ARE Disney Infinity books that show the canons interacting, but that&#39;s probably non-canon because their toy counterparts are the ones involved.)<br><br>OFUs in general, AFAIK, are based off a specific continuum or, at least in the case of the OFU of Crossovers, a type of fanfic genre. I&#39;ve been told of OFUs cropping up for pretty specific fandoms, and they seem to be doing quite nicely by themselves, so that means an OFU that serves as a sort of &quot;hub-campus&quot; for say, everything to do with Nickelodeon, Dreamworks, or Disney/Pixar for that matter, as amazing as it would be, would sadly be entirely unnecessary in-universe, and way too complicated to keep track of besides.<br><br>BTW, eatpraylove, thanks for the fanfic rec! I&#39;ll remember to check out that story sometime. :)</p>

            <p>Originally, you had animated movies from  Dreamworks (HTTYD), Pixar (The Incredibles), and Disney (various others, mostly princesses). Then you tried to change it to Disney Infinity without knowing the canon. <br><br>Alleb&#39;s just focusing on the Disney Princesses, it looks like. Big difference.</p>

            <p>The initial concept I had in mind was based in the logic that there would have to be some OFU to cover all the general topics about animated movie or Disney fanfic, but again, there isn&#39;t a need for that in-universe. As noted, Infinity was the only Disney mega-crossover I could think of as being canonical, but at the same time it... isn&#39;t.<br><br>From what you&#39;ve noted, it seems like the scope of Alleb&#39;s take on the project is far narrower, which is a plus, though that still leaves the question of why an OFU for Disney in general would exist alongside those for specific continua. I hope an explanation for this can be provided because aside from that issue, I would really like to see how a Disney OFU would be handled. And if it helps any, my skills or lack thereof in handling OFUs is more than made up for by my knowledge of Disney, and assuming my schedule doesn&#39;t get in the way, I&#39;d be happy to be a beta reader for this endeavor. If only as a canon and SPaG expert.</p>

            <p>Even though there are separate entries for the different movies, there&#39;s a catch-all category on the Pit for Disney, under cartoons, and that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be dealing with. I&#39;ll look at the others so I can get a good understanding on what needs to be taught, but justifying the mega-crossover isn&#39;t hard. Not to mention they&#39;re all mixed together in the parks, and in the merchandise. <br><br>A canon expert would be great! I can&#39;t make any statements about schedules- I don&#39;t even know when I&#39;ll be able to begin writing. But when I do, a canon consultant will be awesome!</p>

            <p>I&#39;d recommend checking out the Nostalgia Critic&#39;s <a href="http://channelawesome.com/tag/disneycember/page/12/">Disneycember</a> videos. They&#39;re fun, and you&#39;ll pick up some interesting trivia.<br><br>As for the question of minis, my first thought is the demons from the &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; segment in <i>Fantasia</i>. If you subscribe to the &quot;<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/FriendsAndTheHighCouncil">Friends and the High Council</a>&quot; theory (which I find amusing), Chernabog is the biggest bad in the unified Disney multiverse, so what better to use than his minions?<br><br>Alternatively, every film is its own universe and gets its own minis. Have fun with that!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>How much a character can be thrown OOC by being <i>mentioned</i>, let alone by a cameo. For example - I&#39;m sporking a fic that throws a character OOC by mentioning him being condescending to his protege, who&#39;s also the second-best friend of his (adopted) little sister. The fic does that in a couple sentences. Length has nothing to do with this.</p>

Wait...&quot;<br><br>The man turned on his heel and walked away. Lucy gaped after him. &quot;I&#39;m <i>not</i> strange!&quot; she yelled. &quot;I&#39;m approved! And I&#39;m not little, either-&quot;<br><br>The man stopped in the doorway, then turned with a weirdly mechanical movement. As he retraced his steps towards Lucy, she couldn&#39;t help but notice that every pace was identical in every way. The only thing that changed was the swirl of the air currents through his hair.<br><br>He held out the photo, exactly as before. &quot;She sat on a chair. Pulling the paper out of the bag, she started flipping pages and dark, pointing to the paper, began to read:&quot;<br><br>Lucy stared at the picture. Sure enough, the girl shown in it was sitting on a chair, reading in the dark. &quot;So... is she missing? Do you need to find her? Look, if she&#39;s in trouble, I&#39;ll forgive the &#39;weird&#39; comments-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Experts have found out that the girl&#39;s death came at midnig-&quot;<br><br>The man stopped. No: he <i>froze</i>, his mouth open, his tongue flexed in mid-syllable. Even his hair was static now, caught in the pattern the air con had given it.<br><br>Lucy reached out as if to touch the man, then thought better of it. She didn&#39;t know which would be worse: if his skin was hard and immobile, or if it yielded under her fingers. Instead, she snatched the photo from his loose grip.<br><br>&quot;Right,&quot; she said, &quot;well. I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll look into it. Um. Yes. Gotta go now.&quot; And she fled, leaving the man where he stood, staring into nothingness.<br><br>~<br><br>That was fun. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

Those whose lands are closer are either absent or engrossed in their work, as my Lady Wife can attest. Therefore, the only Baron who might take stewardship is my self, and I move that this council cede all the lands currently under Baron Araeph&#39;s control, and those held by Baron Cassie, into my care. The &quot;Baron&quot; Kaitlyn may keep possession of her fantasy nation, for the time being.<br><br>&#39;I think you will find that this is the most logical course of action.

            <p>I selected the agents on that dropdown based on who&#39;d been nominated as Featured Agents in the old system, where they had to be nominated by other people and not self-selected. From that list, I went with ones that represent a wide variety of departments and/or have spin-offs that I feel are particularly worth reading to get a solid handle on the PPC. So, unless y&#39;all wanna come up with some other method of selection that covers those bases and is fair, not so much?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Doing things. Doing stuff.<br><br>And yes, Araeph solved world hunger and saved Christmas and conquered the empire of the evil Lemming-Men from beyond the stars and the rest of us are therefore Not Giving Her The Due And Proper Adulation. <i>Araeph</i> was prominent. <i>Araeph</i> did things. Her agents? Not so much; at least, not any more. The fact that I had to look up who Araeph was should maaaaaaybe clue you in to the fact that not everyone does, particularly when her primary fandom is a godawful popcorn movie franchise with two of the three leads having a love story like a six-year-old mashing Barbie and Ken together and the other being a prolonged Keith Richards impersonation by the victim of a serious head injury.<br><br>What I&#39;m driving at is that I think the drop-down list should be constantly and consistently updated. People fade from prominence. I&#39;m certain that, in time, Rina will as well. She&#39;s active and actively well-liked, her author is a Permission Giver, and she&#39;s actually written more missions than Araeph has, so I really don&#39;t see what your objection is.<br><br>Perhaps I should crowbar a load of new inventions into our next cowrite. We&#39;re doing Wabloo Swabloo, so it&#39;ll help pass the time between bouts of staring mounrfully out the window, watching the sandbars move in the bay.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know why it was necessary to insult both my fandom and my friend, Neshomeh (the condescending &quot;should maaaaaybe clue you in&quot; implying that she is somehow slow of wit), but I assure you it won&#39;t convince anyone here to support your argument further. I am also confused by your attempts to knock me off a pedestal that no one put me on in the first place. Not a soul, to my knowledge, was praising me as the Second Coming or criticizing others for not swooning at my feet, yet you seem to imply that my name is somehow sacrosanct. (Given that I am the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Smite">resident PPC infidel</a>, that would be quite the accomplishment.) <br><br>I am sorry that you view <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> as yet another junk popcorn movie. In my opinion, it is remarkably intelligently written and acted, and to reduce Jack Sparrow’s character to a Keith Richards impersonation is to engage the movie on only the most superficial level. While none of the PotC movies are perfect and the sequels are inferior to the first, there is a wealth of characters, lines, effects, myths, and music to sink one’s teeth into. Might I add that what makes a fandom worth protecting is not whether the canon is considered a classic, but whether it has earned our love and respect? There is no hierarchy of PPCing where, say, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> agents are considered to be of a higher caliber than those of <i>Independence Day</i> or <i>The Matrix</i>. To do so would encourage a highly undesirable PPC caste system, unleash a flood of canon hatred as people from less popular fandoms jockey for power by criticizing works higher on the food chain, and, worst of all, invalidate the fan experience of boarders who find value and meaning in less critically acclaimed material. (Though the first PotC, with its 79% tomatometer rating and five Oscar nominations—one of them for the very Johnny Depp performance you derided—does not fall into that category, so I’m afraid you’d still be stuck with it.) <br><br>I don’t feel that my agents need defending, so I shall not attempt to do so. I am proud of them and what they have done, and will leave it up to the community to decide whether either of them are, indeed, still “famous.” Since fame was not my objective in writing them, the DTE making the &quot;Prominent Agents&quot; list at all is an unexpected pleasure.<br><br>~Araeph<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been working on a theme park for the last few days that, well, is still basically a bloody builder&#39;s yard. It opens tomorrow. It&#39;s been... preying on my mind a little, shall we say, and it&#39;s made me even more fractious, high-handed and dismissive than normal. I hasten to add that this is not acceptable as an excuse; merely that it is the reason for my outburst.<br><br>While I personally think that the list of prominent agents should be more current than its present incarnation (which, prior to Ix&#39;s agents being added, contained about two agents who were still around) with something like a Hall Of Fame setup on a dedicated page for older agents who <i>aren&#39;t</i> about as much for whatever reason, there was no reason to go into personal attacks. I&#39;m sorry that I said those things, and ashamed of myself for saying them. I&#39;ll try to be less of a cow in future.</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t hurt, just exasperated and, as I said before, a bit confused. I also see nothing wrong with a list that includes more current agents, but I do agree with Nesh that PPCers who helped make the organization what it is today still deserve a place of prominence in the list. I&#39;d say the same thing even if it weren&#39;t my agent up for debate. But I <i>am</i> an old fogey, so make of that what you will.<br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>Which I think still matter, because they contributed to making the PPC what it is today:<br><br>1. Pioneered a new department that was actually a new department, with its own MO, not just another DMS in a new fandom like lots of the &quot;new departments&quot; back in the day. Note that this is not just inventing random new things and shoving them in. This was a whole new concept.<br><br>2. Starred in seventeen stories. Yes, a few others have passed this number; most haven&#39;t even come close.<br><br>3. Officiated at the Sue-Smiting Ceremony. Lots of folks were involved. It was a big deal.<br><br>4. Her spinoff is bloody well-written, and she&#39;s a good character. I feel like I&#39;ve heard that this matters somewhere else in this thread.<br><br>4.5 It&#39;s also responsible for introducing the PPC Crash Dummies, which are staple equipment today. Inventions that actually passed the test of time and stuck around strike me as worth recognizing.<br><br>5. Oh, look, her author IS still around. How &#39;bout that.<br><br>I don&#39;t object to Rina being added. In fact, I&#39;ve just done so. I object to the existing members of the list being derided by people who haven&#39;t bothered to read them and somehow feel that their ignorance is evidence of something. It isn&#39;t.<br><br>Also, PotC was extremely popular when it first came out.

            <p>Way I see it, while the list is a great way to see who <i>was</i> a prominent agent while they were still active, half the list hasn&#39;t done anything for years and one of them has all but completely retired. I think it might be a good idea to expand that list and bring it a little more up to date.<br><br>And so what if we have this same conversation in two years, and again two years after that? It doesn&#39;t make the slightest bit of difference. New agents will rise to prominence and old ones will fade. Say, for example, if one of them took down a slew of Legendary Badfics that culminated in a six-part epic that succeeded where at least one previous set of agents failed. Surely that alone would be worthy of inclusion, never mind the fact that they kept going afterwards rather than take the month of accrued vacation time to mainline antipsychotics and sit dribbling by a window while the sky glowed pink.<br><br>Agent Rina Dives shows up everywhere, and she shows up in quality missions, and she shows up in quality RPs, and basically? She&#39;s exactly the kind of agent we <i>should</i> be promoting. Rina Dives is an excellent character, and all the better for being a prominent agent.<br><br>Consider this me seconding Voydymort&#39;s nomination.</p>

            <p>You seem to be under the impression that both Neshomeh and I are vehemently against adding anyone new to the list. I&#39;m not sure where you got that impression.<br><br>My point was that coming up with a detailed nomination process <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277795;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">as Iximaz did</a> is pointless, because <b>people won&#39;t nominate for long</b>. This isn&#39;t just speculation; it&#39;s based on two rounds of Agent of the Week which went exactly that way - a few weeks of nominations, and then nothing. To look at it from another angle: what&#39;s the process for deciding whether a Mary-Sue should be given a wiki page? We&#39;ve got one, you know.<br><br>So coming up with any sort of nomination mechanism is pointless, because it will not be used for very long. Have a party nominating people on this thread if you like, but don&#39;t try and create a lasting system, because it won&#39;t last.<br><br><b>That&#39;s</b> what I was trying to say.

            <p>I took a stab at it because it looked like nobody else had any ideas/suggestions. Plus, &quot;Must be nominated by someone other than their author&quot; and &quot;must have done something noteworthy&quot; doesn&#39;t seem like quite enough. Otherwise you&#39;d have just one person&#39;s voice declaring who gets to be added when the agent in question might or might not be considered prominent.<br><br>(And I thought we didn&#39;t have a process for nominating Mary Sues for the Wiki?)</p>

            <p>... about ten people seem to think &#39;nominate her right here&#39; is an acceptable method. ^_~<br><br>But no, you&#39;re right, and it is a decent method - but what&#39;re the odds of it happening outside this thread? A year from now, are you going to read Lacksidacksical&#39;s new mission and think &#39;wow, Agent Tallulah should really be on the Prominent Agents dropdown, I should nominate him&#39;? Proooobably not, because it won&#39;t be on your mind. So the list will drop steadily back towards Voyd&#39;s &#39;obsolete&#39;. Which was my point.<br><br>(The method I last recall for adding Mary-Sues was essentially the same as the one you suggested for agents - they have to be nominated by someone not their author as being important, and seconded by however many.

            <p>I&#39;ll...whatever number it is...Rina Dives for Prominent Agent. Also seconding what everyone else has been saying. Rina&#39;s got a lot of screentime, has had character development and will only continue to get it. As a bonus, she&#39;s also been in co-writes and seems to be generally widely read and well-liked.

I give many thanks to Ixi for acting as my proxy during Plort and stuff!<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve been actively watching Agent Rina&#39;s career since her second mission. At this point in time, she&#39;s now up to mission 26, with a great deal of characterization along with excellent examples of PPC lore development. In short, the exploits of Agent Dives (both in how prolific her appearances are as well as achievements including the takedown of a notorious Legendary) are classic examples of what the PPC is all about. She is more than worthy of notable status, in my opinion.</p>

            <p>It sort of mirrors real life.  Sure someone may have been prominent at one point, but was surpassed by someone else.  The way the world works is that older generations will be replaced by newer ones.  You can always keep the older ones in as sort of a hall of fame.  Or alternatively maybe to alleviate that risk just create a &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; for PPC Agents.<br><br>So to make this a bit clearer, maybe create a separate entry for the PPC Hall of Fame, where the current community decides what would make the HoF Agents, which I imagine would be what would make an agent a Prominent Agent.  You immortalize the former Prominent Agents, while allowing the metaphoric next generation be the prominent ones, then when they cease being active, they can get shifted over to the HoF.  Best of both worlds.  Just my two cents.<br><br>Also I support Rina Dives for Prominent Agent.</p>

I remember no indication whatsoever that the character even speaks Latin. And furthermore, <i>I</i> don&#39;t even speak Latin and I <i>still</i> know it&#39;s almost definitely bad. Why? Because it smacks of badfics that try to use Sindarin in the sense of &quot;hannon le for le helping me make mellyn with Arwen&quot; (okay, a tiny bit better than that, but it&#39;s got English mixed in and I&#39;m fairly sure Latin has a feminine form that should be being used but isn&#39;t.)<br><br>So, in short: this is the sentence, followed by Google Translate&#39;s explanation and my guess of what it&#39;s meant to be. Could any Latin experts please tell me exactly how wrong the Latin is?<br><br>(Female character to other female character, breaking my brain in the process): &quot;I hope you forgive me for what I have done to you but you will not be a vampire you shall be <b>tutis illorum vos diligo , proeliator illi quisnam can&#39;t pugna pro themselves , angelus ut vigilo super totus.</b>&quot;<br><br>&quot;secure of those you love, of war for those who can not fight for themselves, an angel to watch over the whole man.&quot; says Google Translate.<br><br>I expect it&#39;s meant to be something like &quot;protector of those you love, champion/warrior of those who cannot fight for themselves, an angel to watch over everyone.&quot; Only, obviously, the author somehow couldn&#39;t find translations for &#39;can&#39;t&#39; and &#39;themselves&#39;--but decided to go ahead and use the Latin anyway.<br><br>The same speaker then calls the same character &#39;carus unus&#39; several times. GTranslate says that&#39;s &#39;dear one&#39;; I say, that&#39;s great, but again...even ignoring the OOC, am I imagining that Latin makes a distinction between genders?<br><br>Thank you so much in advance to anyone who helps. (You, too, can contribute to DawnFire&#39;s understanding of the end of the giant speech that&#39;s breaking her brain! :D )<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>OK then. To catch everyone up:<br><br>Translatin: <b>tutis illorum vos diligo , proeliator illi quisnam can&#39;t pugna pro themselves , angelus ut vigilo super totus.</b><br><br>English (after DawnFire bravely strove to make sense of GTranslate’s translation of the Translatin): protector of those you love, champion/warrior of those who cannot fight for themselves, an angel to watch over everyone.<br><br>We’re two parts in, and our running translation so far is <i>defensrix illorum quos diligis, propugnatrix illorum qui pro se non pugnare possunt </i><br><br>One last part to go: <b>angelus ut vigilo super totus.</b><br><br>9) <b>angelus</b><br>That’s the word for “angel”. Absolutely no problem here.<br><br>10) <b>ut</b><br>The word is correct; <i>ut</i> is the word for “to” when it is used to introduce certain types of clauses. (If you know French, think of this <i>ut</i> as akin to the French <i>afin que</i>.) However, <i>any</i> student of Latin knows to be wary when <i>ut</i> rears its head, as it usually requires the upcoming verb to be in the subjunctive mood. Of course, if GTranslate cannot even get the indicative mood right, don’t even put your hopes up for seeing a correctly-conjugated subjunctive.<br><br>11) <b>vigilo</b><br>Again, lazy translating. <i>Vigilo</i> is the verb for “watch,” but I reiterate that GTranslate didn’t even try to conjugate it: <i>vigilo</i> means &quot;I watch.&quot;<br><br>Question is: what do we need to conjugate this verb to?<br><br>To figure this out, let’s unpack the English a bit. The full sentence reads, in relevant part, “[Y]ou shall be … an angel to watch over everyone.” The sense is “you shall be an angel <i>so that you may</i> watch over everyone.” In other words, <i>vigilo</i> needs to be conjugated to second person singular present subjunctive active. That is <i>vigiles</i>.<br><br>12) <b>super</b><br>Wrong word. “Super” means “over” in the sense of “on top of.” Of course, this is not what we are looking for here; we want the preposition that is part of the verb phrase “to keep watch over [someone].” Here, I will admit that I do not know for sure, but my best guess is <i>pro</i>. If someone is willing to confirm or correct me, I&#39;d gladly appreciate it.<br><br>13) <b>totus</b><br>Wrong word. <i>Totus</i> means “all” in the sense of “entirety.” We want “all” in the sense of “everyone.” That is the word <i>omnes</i>. The object of the preposition <i>pro</i> must be in the ablative case, though, so <i>omnes</i> declines to <i>omnibus</i>.<br><br>Fit the words in their proper places, and (assuming that I used the proper preposition in this last part) we have all three titles properly translated: <i>defensrix illorum quos diligis, propugnatrix illorum qui pro se non pugnare possunt, angelus ut vigiles pro omnibus.</i><br><br>And with that, class dismissed!</p>

            <p>OK then. To catch everyone up:<br><br>Translatin: <b>tutis illorum vos diligo , proeliator illi quisnam can&#39;t pugna pro themselves , angelus ut vigilo super totus.</b><br><br>English (after DawnFire bravely strove to make sense of GTranslate’s translation of the Translatin): protector of those you love, champion/warrior of those who cannot fight for themselves, an angel to watch over everyone.<br><br>We’ve gone through the first part and now know that a more proper translation would be <i>defensrix illorum quos diligis</i><br><br>Are we all caught up? Good. Off to the next part:<b> proeliator illi quisnam can&#39;t pugna pro themselves</b><br><br>3) <b>proeliator<br>Proeliator</b> is an actual word meaning “fighter.” GTranslate got it right. No issues here.<br>Of course, feel free to look in WORDS if you want another word. Since you think that the English is going for “champion,” I’d prefer <i>propugnatrix</i> (remember that the hearer is female).<br><br>4) <b>illi</b><br>Declension fail. And you had it right just a few words ago, GTranslate! <i>Illi</i> is the masculine singular dative form of the reflexive pronoun <i>ille</i>. The word needed here is the masculine plural genitive: <i>illorum</i>.<br><br>5) <b>quisnam</b><br>OrangeYoshi99 hit it right on the head again. This is an interrogative pronoun: “who then?” The correct pronoun is the <u>relative pronoun</u>, which I’ve introduced you to in Part I. Since the relative pronoun is the subject of its clause here, we need the nominative masculine plural: <i>qui</i><br><br>6) <b>can’t</b><br>Why didn’t you even <i>try</i>, GTranslate?<br><br>There is a word in Latin for “can,” as in “to be able.” It is <i>possum</i>. Conjugate to third person plural present active indicative, and you get <i>possunt.</i><br><br>To negate a verb, just add <i>non</i> before it. So “they cannot” becomes <i>non possunt</i>.<br><br>7) <b>pugna<br>Pugna</b> is the noun for “a fight.” We are looking for the verb “to fight.” And since the word “fight” is following the word “can,” it needs to be in the infinitive mood: <i>pugnare</i>.<br><br>8) <b>pro themselves</b><br>So close, yet so far, GTranslate! Anyone who’s been in court may already know the term for “for himself”: it’s <i>pro se.</i> That’s what we need here.<br><br>Given that Latin has a case system, word order is a lot freer in Latin than in English. But in general, Latin syntax is subject-object-verb. So we need to mess with the syntax a bit to put the words in their proper places: <i>propugnatrix illorum qui pro se non pugnare possunt</i><br><br>So our running translation thus far is: <i>defensrix illorum quos diligis, propugnatrix illorum qui pro se non pugnare possunt</i><br></p>

            <p>First and foremost, major kudos for wrapping your brain around the task of trying to make sense out of the badfic Translatin.<br><br>That aside, let&#39;s look at how badly the author/Google Translate botched it up now that I have some English to work off of. I want to make this manageable, so I&#39;ll chop this into multiple parts.<br><br>I&#39;ll warn you right now: there will be a lot of grammar terms bandied about. If you have no idea what a word means, please ask.<br><br><br>*ahem*<br>*taps ruler onto chalkboard*<br><br>First off, let&#39;s reiterate what our author supposedly meant to write: &quot;protector of those you love, champion/warrior of those who cannot fight for themselves, an angel to watch over everyone.&quot;<br><br>Now for the Translatin: &quot;<b>tutis illorum vos diligo, proeliator illi quisnam can&#39;t pugna pro themselves, angelus ut vigilo super totus.</b>&quot;<br><br><br>Before I go on, I must thank Matt Cipher: I had no idea about the term &quot;negative transfer.&quot; There&#39;s quite a bit of it here, and that term will be quite useful. <br><br>Off we go:<br><br>1) <b>tutis</b><br>First off, I have little idea where GTranslate got <b>tutis</b>. Most likely is that GTranslate tried to use the verb <em>tueor</em> (to protect) or the adjective <em>tutus</em> (safe, protected). However, <strong>tutis</strong> is nowhere close to meaning &quot;protector.&quot; I won&#39;t bother you with the possible parsings: suffice it to say that you can conjugate <em>tueor</em> to get <em>tutis</em>, and you can also decline <em>tutus</em> to get <em>tutis</em> as well.<br><br>But how to say &quot;protector&quot;? Well, if we want to work off of the verb <em>tueor</em>, the word for protector is <em>tutor</em>.<br>However, that might throw an Anglophone off, so what other words can we use for &quot;protector&quot;?<br>A look in any good dictionary (BTW, I highly recommend <a href="http://lysy2.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/words.exe">Whitaker&#39;s WORDS</a>; it&#39;s the program I use) will give quite a few options. One that would resonate more with English speakers would be <em>defensor</em>. So let&#39;s go with that.<br><br>2) <strong>illorum vos diligo</strong><br>And we see negative transfer at work: <strong>illorum</strong> for “of those” (nice job actually declining for once, GTranslate!); <strong>vos</strong> for “you”, and<strong> diligo</strong> for “love”.<br><br><strong>Illorum</strong> for &quot;of those&quot; is actually correct.<br><em>Ille</em> is the demonstrative pronoun &quot;that.&quot; &quot;Of those [people]&quot; requires <em>ille</em> to be declined to genitive masculine plural. (Just like French, a group of people is referred to by the masculine plural unless the group is composed totally of females.) And the genitive masculine plural of <em>ille</em> is, indeed, <em>illorum</em>.<br><br>But that&#39;s where GTranslate begins and ends being correct in this clause.<br><br>Just like Spanish, personal pronouns are optional for conjugating verbs. And since the speaker is talking to one person, the pronoun used here is wrong. OrangeYoshi picked up on that: <strong>vos</strong> is plural. The correct pronoun here is <em>tu</em>. But as I said, it is optional; Latin mainly uses the pronoun for emphasis, and we don&#39;t need it here.<br><br>As for <strong>diligo</strong>, it seems that this is more fodder for the belief that GTranslate utterly fails at conjugating Latin verbs. Sometimes it tries (and fails), and other times it doesn&#39;t even try. This time, it didn&#39;t even try.<br>Go to any Latin dictionary and look up a verb, and you&#39;ll find that the entries look something like this: “<em>natō, natāre, natāvī, natatus</em>: swim” The parts that I put in italics are the <u>principal parts</u> of the verb. (Akin to “swim, swam, swum.” in Englishj)<br>However, unlike other languages&#39; dictionaries, Latin dictionaries&#39; verb entries start with the first person singular present indicative active, as opposed to the present active infinitive.<br><br>Why did I say all that? To underscore how wrong GTranslate got it when it simply plugged in <strong>diligo</strong> for “love.” It would be akin to it plugging in <strong>aimer</strong> in a French translation. It’s even worse since <em>diligo</em> is a finite verb: it means “I love”! So GTranslate gave “to those protected of those ye I love”—utter nonsense. (Since we’re dealing with a language that distinguishes between singular and plural “you,” I’ll use “thou” and “ye” to distinguish in the English translations.)<br><br>So, how to fix it?<br><br>First off, we need to expose a word that GTranslate missed because it was hiding in the English. The English is “protector of those you love.” More properly, it’s “protector of those <em>whom</em> you love.” GTranslate missed the “whom.” The relative pronoun in Latin is <em>qui</em>. Here, we need it to be accusative masculine plural: <em>quos</em>.<br><br>Next: “you love.” As I said, the pronoun is unneeded. Using <em>diligo</em> for “love”, second person singular present indicative active gives <em>diligis</em>.<br><br>OK, I said a lot, so let’s summarize what I’ve said so far.<br><br>The English: “protector of those you love.”<br>The Translatin: <strong>tutis illorum vos diligo</strong><br>The problems:<br>* <strong>tutis</strong> is the wrong word, no matter how you slice it<br>* GTranslate, being not human, did not detect the hidden relative pronoun<br>* <strong>vos</strong> is the wrong number<br>* <strong>diligo</strong> is conjugated wrong<br>A correctly-done Latin translation: <em>defensor illorum quos diligis</em><br><br><br>I won’t add the summary to the later parts, but I will keep a running translation as we go through the sentence.</p>

            <p>It looks like a few Latin-student PPCers have joined since <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=239076;search_term=Latin+and+the+PPC">I last looked for fellow Latin learners</a>, and the bits of advice you&#39;re getting are, for the most part, right.<br><br>But unless I&#39;m mistaken, you want to get into the nitty-gritty of the depth of GTranslate fail here.

            <p>What happened, it looks like, is they ran the sentence through a translator program, thus can&#39;t and themselves are in English; presumably, it couldn&#39;t handle contractions or reflexive pronouns.  Not only did they just Google Translate a phrase into a language they don&#39;t speak, they didn&#39;t bother to read through the results and realize it didn&#39;t all translate.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve run out of villain ideas for a video game I&#39;m trying not to procrastinate over. I&#39;m trying to make a genuinely chilling, creepy villain. I&#39;ve tried several things, but I&#39;m just too easily amused, and I think it just comes out as hilarious no matter what I try. I was thinking about going the affably evil route, but that&#39;s been done so many times. I already have an Omnicidal Maniac and a humanoid abomination(Who is on the heroes&#39; side), so I&#39;d like to do something different for this guy. It&#39;s a sci-fi style game, in case anyone was wondering.<br><br>Anyone who answers gets Magical Cookies.</p>

            <p>...Is that the villain doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s the villain at all. He&#39;s the hero of his own story, and in that story, <i>you</i> are the villain. Think about what this person wants, why they&#39;re willing to do what they do to get it, what might have led them down this path. Behind every monster is a living, breathing person who probably didn&#39;t just wake up one morning and go, &quot;today, I shall be evil!&quot;</p>

            <p>... mostly because there are so <i>many</i> different types of villain that fit better or worse depending on the narrative. A few general tips:<br><br>Some villains, like serial killers, are frightening because of who they <i>are</i>. Others are frightening because of what they <i>represent</i>, where villainy is as much carried out by their faction/minions/whatever as themselves. Note that this doesn&#39;t mean such a villain necessarily has to be some kind of behind-the-scenes puppet master- they can be significant, visible badasses in and of themselves, so long as they also represent kind of the natural pinnacle of their faction&#39;s power.<br><br>To showcase the threat of what a villain will do if not stopped, they usually have to be in a position where they have come at least partway to doing what they actually <i>want</i>. They don&#39;t have to have won, but for a faction it&#39;s generally a good idea for them to have controlled at least some territory, and if they have something in particular they plan to <i>do</i>, if it&#39;s something less final than destroying the planet or whatever (see, Omnicidal Maniac) it&#39;s usually a good idea for them to have <i>done</i> it successfully at at least one point prior.<br><br>Villains with strong &quot;acting&quot; are always a nice touch, but it&#39;s not strictly necessary. Tevos T&#39;sael from <i>Palaven&#39;s Dogs</i> was just a sleazy politician with relatively little screen time, but that played to her advantage when she discusses the extermination/enslavement of the turian people just as blandly as she does her newest trade proposal.<br><br>So, ultimately, creating a villain is a very broad challenge, and without knowing more about what goes on in this game there&#39;s no easy answer. Usually, when I can&#39;t think of anything, I tend to plan out what the villain <i>doesN/i&gt; to move the plot forward, then see how I can use that to make them see villainous (which is how Tevos came into being, above).<br><br><br>Also, a side note. It seems like a lot of media these days (mostly fan, although the last <i>Mad Max</i> movie was also extremely guilty of this), seem to think that making a villain or villain faction ludicrously sexist is enough to make them threatening. I&#39;ve always found this to be a bit of a cheap substitute for actual characterization, and it usually leaves me just sort of snorting disdainfully about how these troglodytes could possibly have made it into a position of importance as opposed to being scared or angry at them.</i></p>

            <p>Depending on the title, make it true. The creepier it is, the better. For example, Ugnatt Trunn from &quot;Lord Brocktree&quot; by Brian Jacques had the title of &quot;He Who Drinks Blood from the Skulls of His Enemies.&quot; Not a page after this name was first written was Trunn handed a hollowed-out weasel&#39;s skull, with blood in it, to sip.

            <p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d describe them as chilling, but personally, I really like villains that have understandable motivations but absolutely no morals.  Whether their goals are noble (making the world a better place, getting revenge for the death of a loved one) or selfish (money, power), they&#39;re something the audience can recognize.  But they&#39;re willing to cross the line with their behavior.  Basically, the kind of villain that you can almost, <i>but not quite</i>, understand completely.<br><br>Also, villains who do have really clever plans.  This is a little more subjective, but I&#39;ll admire a villain a lot more if he can outwit his opponents.  The same&#39;s true for the heroes, too.</p>

            <p>Well, &quot;she&quot; is very much like you described, in the sense that she is a complete pragmatist who essentially seeks out powerful things in order to control them and bring order. The fact that she is helping the heroes while stringing them along and playing mind games with them. So, at least I know I&#39;m on the right track with her. I&#39;ll likely apply some of what you mentioned to this other villain I&#39;m trying to write.</p>

            <p>This may or may not get a tad opinionated. I&#39;m not as well versed in popular media as I&#39;d like to be but I know of some really good examples that I feel are worth sharing.<br><br>My idea of a genuinely creepy antagonist is one who knows and understands you on a personal level, or vice versa. The former because he is not only relatable to you but also knows how to well and truly ruin you, and the latter because you get the sense that this could be you, or at least someone you know. How either of these can be expressed in the character can vary depending on the writer and the audience but in general they are basically the incarnations of things that the viewer is afraid of, and those that have the potential to damage them on a personal level can be especially terrifying. Especially if they have the public backing them up. For example, my idea of a truly scary villain would play on my own fear of losing face due to exposure of my personal faults, with said character broadcasting the hero&#39;s worst secrets to the entire world and getting everyone to hate them. Or, if the reader fears being wrongfully accused by the masses, Tumblr style, the villain could spread hateful rumors among the populace with a similar result.<br><br>On the flipside, there’s also the villain who could very easily turn up in real life and affect the people around them no less differently than their fictional counterpart. That&#39;s why Dolores Umbridge is so widely hated because really, who HASN&#39;T had at least one teacher as despicable as her? Another good starting point could be emotional manipulation in that the villain convinces the heroes that they are in the wrong, even if it&#39;s not true, which is something that happens a lot in real life as well. Again, if the character has a public reputation and following, even better, since those who admire the character could easily turn against you if you try to speak against their idol.<br><br>By the way, you don’t have to worry about projecting your own fears into a scary villain, because lots of writers do that in canon, and I know I would. The key is to make sure your audience can also relate to whatever makes your villain so frightening. In my opinion, if there&#39;s anything a good book or movie must be, it&#39;s engaging. And the same goes for the characters of these works, antagonistic or otherwise.</p>

            <p>The PPC in fact started with such, and it&#39;s only been in the last few years really that the majority of people have gone with creating utterly new characters for being their starting agents rather than using some version of themself as one of their starting agents.<br><br>TOS is rooted in such, as are plenty of older spin-offs.</p>

            <p>The instant they join the PPC, their experiences and yours start to diverge. The changes will be small at first, but the longer they stay in the PPC, the more they&#39;ll begin to grow into their own character. It can get a bit difficult at times reminding yourself, the further you go along, that they aren&#39;t going to be getting the same real-world experiences that you, their author, are getting as you go on with your life and they do their job.<br><br>Look at Agent Trojanhorse. She started off as a SI. but she&#39;s gotten so much development she and her author are two completely different people. Look at Agent Rina. She&#39;s not diverged <i>too</i> much from me, personality-wise, but her insanity is definitely growing and <s>it&#39;s only a matter of time before she snaps</s> it&#39;s going to play a huge part in her character development. By the time I&#39;m done with her, the only things we&#39;ll have in common will be our origins and our fandoms.<br><br>Oh, and to answer your question: Yes, there are self-insert agents. ;)</p>

            <p>Long answer, people sometimes play a caricature of themselves meant to be entertaining. I know that this might be something I&#39;ll try, since my flaws would be hilarious when exaggerated. In fact, this is really more a testament to the PPC&#39;s general amount of skill when compared to other fansites, considering how easy it is to make yourself into a sue without even realizing it. It takes an incredible amount of both humility and self-awareness to play an unbiased version of oneself. I encourage you to try it, because it can be quite fun if you do it right.</p>

            <p>Some people play completely weird agents, which can be interesting if done well and nightmarish X-man Sues on the hypothetical occasion that they are done poorly. Some people play themselves, which has the same risks. However, there&#39;s also the option of creating an agent who isn&#39;t <i>you</i> necessarily, but some other everyday human.</p>

            <p>Often times the present themselves as caricatures of the writer.  But others like the more fantastical approach.  I think the general rule is as long as it is a well written character and not a Sue (though I do not think the two are anything but mutually exclusive), you can really do what ever.  And of course assuming it fits the tone of the PPC.<br><br>But keep in mind that here on the board, we are essentially who we are.  There might be some differences, but for the most part the board is essentially a place where you can be who you are.  The agents are the characters you create for the stories you write or the RP&#39;s you want them to take place in.  So I hope that answers your question.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s always gratifying to see another Sue get taken down, and this one was... well, it felt like the kind of Sue TOS always ended up murderating. Taking command of canon, rendering the original plot unworkable, no regard for the actual canon work - it&#39;s PPC Bingo in full force. I didn&#39;t spot any real SPaG flubs, though I&#39;m sure HG&#39;ll dig up something, and overall it was a short, sweet little fic that didn&#39;t outstay its welcome.<br><br>One thing, though. Rina seemed... more terse than usual in this one. Is there a psychotic break on the horizon?</p>

            <p>This is a fun little wordplay game. Basically, you think of two homonyms, then come up with a sentence for them. For example, an equine with a sore throat is a hoarse horse. One person poses the sentence, and the other guesses the homonyms. No proper nouns. I&#39;ll begin- pronoun of praise. </p>

            <p>Live from a LaQuinta hotel...<br><br>I know that most people avoid making humanoid minis because keeping a humanoid as a pet is creepy.<br><br>However, I personally feel like humanoid minis could be regarded as more like children to agents, and would mature at least mentally over time.<br><br>Enter Kouroki. For those not in the know, she&#39;s the mini-Mokocchi rescued from Valon&#39;s third mission. She&#39;s humanoid, smart enough to understand Japanese and English, and perfectly willing to cause a bit of mischief.<br><br>Another thing is that minis aren&#39;t normally allowed on missions. However, here&#39;s an idea: Kouroki stows away in Valon&#39;s vest, thus tagging along without the agents&#39; knowledge or consent, and once discovered escapes attempts to return her to the RC.<br><br>Could she possibly contribute to the mission in some way? Smacking mini-Sues around with a tiny baseball bat or something?</p>

            <p>The point is that Kouroki finds some sneaky way to follow the agents, and Valon&#39;s vest of holding was the first thing I thought of.<br><br>There are probably other methods, though.</p>

            <p>Sometimes they have animalistic intelligence, sometimes they seem to be fully sapient.  Either way, they&#39;re more like beloved pets than children, and don&#39;t seem to really grow in intelligence.  Also like Pokemon, the whole issue gets slightly creepy if you think about it too hard.<br><br>As for having a mini go along on a mission, there&#39;s no reason that it couldn&#39;t contribute.  Within the OFUs, they&#39;re frequently used to keep the fangirls in line, so I think being able to take on a mini-Sue is reasonable.  Taking one along would be highly discouraged, of course, and they might violate the SEP field.</p>

            <p>To continue the Pokemon analogy, it would be foolhardy to suggest that Pikachu doesn&#39;t count as a character, and some Pokemon, like Meowth, are basically human in behavior and intelligence.  I&#39;m just not sure about forcing them into the mold of &quot;children&quot; is necessarily the best way to go about doing it, as it makes things kind of uncomfortable for people who don&#39;t want to go that direction.  Most minis seem to be capable of taking care of themselves, at the very least.</p>

            <p>(Live from Comfort Inn!)<br><br>The more I think about it, the more I figure that Kouroki in particular probably has the mentality of a seventeen-year-old girl, since she&#39;s base on one. She&#39;d act childish sometimes, but mainly to convince Valon to give her what she wants (she&#39;s just too cute).<br><br>Granted, she&#39;s probably doing better mentally than Tomoko herself is, considering that she&#39;s surrounded by affection.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve skimmed over the first few chapters; I haven&#39;t had time for a full reading. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t comment much on the Alagaesia portions, because I&#39;m not very familiar with the novels. I CAN remark on the Discworld portions, though. What I notice is this:<br><br>1. As hS noted, there are some spelling and grammar issues. Are some or all of you non-native English speakers? Do you have a beta checking over the fic to catch mistakes and make sure the style is consistent throughout?<br><br>2. The authors are clearly attempting a Pratchett-esque style, but I&#39;m not sure they quite understand how it works. It&#39;s more than just saying things in a round-about manner. There&#39;s always a reason; a point or a punchline.<br><br>3. A lot of things about the characters seem to be Just Because. The Watchman has a dragon that isn&#39;t a swamp dragon... because he just does, and because it just is. The witch has pointy ears and dislikes nudity... because she just does. The dwarf has a horse and cart... because he just does. The Golem eats cake... actually, can Golems even eat? I don&#39;t recall if this features in the books.<br><br>Again, Terry Pratchett rarely does anything Just Because. There is no randomness for randomness&#39; sake; there&#39;s always a reason that makes sense within the narrative and the fictional universe.<br><br>4. The elf&#39;s name is Narsil. Really? Just because Paolini stole his concept of the elves from Tolkien doesn&#39;t mean you should steal MORE things.<br><br>5. <i>Another</i> unique dragon species, huh? You&#39;ve got two universe with different types of dragons to play with, but you needed more different dragons? Why?<br><br>6. Huh, Alice really throws her magic around, doesn&#39;t she? She&#39;s not much like any of the other Discworld witches at all. So... why is she a Discworld witch, again?<br><br>7. The characters seem to accept the bizarre situation of meeting people from another universe very easily. They just kinda chat about it and get on with things. This makes me disbelieve in them as people, and therefore I&#39;m not terribly interested to read more about them.<br><br>I&#39;d recommend getting a beta and focusing a lot more on WHO your characters are rather than WHAT they are. Right now, they seem to be collections of labels rather than actual people with inner convictions that drive them. Note that Pratchett&#39;s best characters all have a certain something inside them that forces them to be who they are even when it gets them into trouble. Vimes believes in the law; Granny Weatherwax is intensely moral and self-critical because she&#39;s terrified of going bad; Rincewind runs (literally) on self-preservation; Carrot <i>knows</i> that people are basically good if given the chance; Vetinari <i>knows</i> that people are selfish, stupid animals. It&#39;s those inner things and how they express them that are the most important to a good character, not what they look like or what shiny things they possess or what quirky little habits they might have.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Okay, that&#39;s quite the list of points to address.<br><br>Some of them are quite valid, some of them we&#39;ve thought through and haven&#39;t addressed yet, and some of them are mostly having a bit of fun, which was the whole number one point of the story.<br><br>So:<br><br>1. There&#39;re four of us and at least three of us are native English speakers, so any spelling\grammar mistakes that made it through are a collective failure on our parts that we&#39;ll see about correcting.<br><br>2. That&#39;s a fair point and something I try to keep in mind when I&#39;m writing and something we&#39;re all practicing. Clearly we haven&#39;t quite got the style yet, so that&#39;s something we&#39;ll keep working on.<br><br>3. Before we even started writing the chapters, we drew up the characters. A lot of the things you put as &#39;Just Because&#39; there we have thought through.<br>We might not have explained them right then and there, but that&#39;s because we have an endgame we&#39;re working towards or it&#39;s just something to work with in terms of character development.<br><br>Also, you might have noticed the story has a certain vibe of a pen-and-paper RPG in the scenes dealing with the Gods,  which is intentional and also accounts for the density of eyebrow raising characters. It&#39;s a subtle joke on our part, though.<br><br>The witch we definitely have an endgame for her appearance, the dwarf is supposed to be a travelling merchant and something of a misfit and the Golem...Well, we&#39;re&#39;s the harm in having a bit of fun with a minor detail like that?<br><br>4. Something of an ironic jab at the source material, glad someone finally decided to mention it.<br><br>5. Patientia is a Fae dragon from the Flight Rising pet game. Hardly unique. She was included as a set up for a joke regarding the comparative size difference and Faes are really fun to write, given their monotone speech and expressing emotion purely through body language.<br><br>6. This was a concern of ours we asked clarification on in that chapter, so that&#39;s good to have that cleared up, so thank you for that.<br><br>7. This is a problem not unique to our story and something that can probably do with a closer look at on the edit, though one of the principle reasons it occurred that way so far as I can see is having multiple authors and this is our first time working together on a project.<br> We talk a lot, but this was a project I asked Rustic94, artark and LoverofGames to help me with because I wanted to write this story but wasn&#39;t certain of my skills to do it by myself.<br><br>A beta would probably help, true and character development is something we&#39;re trying to do as we go on.<br><br>The core principle we&#39;re writing this on is to have fun and hopefully our audience will as well.<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to look through, there were definitely points there we can pay heed to and a few points are explainable as this not quite being a 100% serious story and having some aspect of parody to it and some parts are set ups for things we plan to address in later chapters.<br><br>This is a work in progress, after all.<br><br>I think that&#39;s the vast majority of what you raised covered, so once again: Thank you for having a look, thank you giving some honest critical feedback and I hope you enjoy reading on if we haven&#39;t offended your sensibilities too badly. ;)</p>

            <p>Just wanna respond to this one point, since it&#39;s sort of what the PPC is all about:<br><br><i>Well, we&#39;re&#39;s the harm in having a bit of fun with a minor detail like that?</i><br><br>The harm is that the minor details are what make up the big, complex worlds we know and love. Changing just one little thing may not be a big deal, especially if you have a reason that is properly explained and justified in the narrative of your story, but start changing a <i>bunch</i> of minor details, and the world starts to look less and less like the one I want to read about. Your story claims to have something to do with the Discworld, but if the dragons aren&#39;t swamp dragons and the witches don&#39;t act like witches and the golems don&#39;t act like golems and it&#39;s all just because y&#39;all were entertaining yourselves, then it ain&#39;t the Discworld, and I ain&#39;t interested.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s fine to write a crack story with your friends for snorts and chuckles, but if that&#39;s what it is, then maybe consider keeping it just between your friends?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I can see where you&#39;re coming from. While I&#39;m slightly annoyed (a past experience or two of dealing with people that shut down beta reading for a AU I had planned without giving it much chance, that left me a bit cynical and sour about some criticisms (one of used the term &#39;true fan&#39;), I&#39;ve to admit your criticisms is helping improve the re-edits that I&#39;m currently doing for characters like Thumper, Alice and Alfie. Which makes me all the more happier.<br><br>And trust me, I know where you&#39;re coming from. There&#39;s been several adaptations or fanfics of my favourite stories that it feels like people put little thought and effort despite having sources through the internet  to help out. Though my excuse for the handling of canon is to see how far I can bend the rules without breaking them (sometimes it works, sometimes I accident snapped them due to lack of information or forgetfulness). Unfortunately feedback is rare and on fanfiction.net they might not be quite helpful. </p>

            <p>It also contains shots at some of the more common conceits and noisome plots that the Inheritance Cycle fandom write fanfic about:<br><br>Surviving Dragon Riders, Galbatorix having a daughter, Murtagh being portrayed as an emo who thoroughly hates his situation.<br><br>That and some of the bigger eyebrow raisers in the actual canon, like Nasuada being highly undiplomatic and using siege weapons on an open battlefield against a force of infantry and cavalry.<br><br>Alice&#39;s (over) use of magic is something we felt out of character and intend to adjust.<br>Thumper&#39;s love of cake we have a punchline for.

            <p>I took a quick look over the first chapter/prologue (in my capacity as Administrator of OFUDisc), and the story seems... relatively solid. Specifically, the <i>feel</i> of the Discworld was pretty good: I didn&#39;t stare at things and yell &#39;that&#39;s not right!&#39;. Equally, the canon characters who showed up were... decently in-character. I disagree with the characterisation of Fate, but it&#39;s been a <i>long</i> time since I read TCoM.<br><br>I have some problems with their punctuation - missing commas, and some very weird dashphen use. I also... how to put this? The OCs, from what little I saw in the prologue, feel like RP characters; they have some pretty exaggerated traits. One sees people sunbathing (in Ankh? Yeah, but then again, Ankh has a railway system these days), and immediately freaks out about &#39;nudity&#39; (y&#39;know, underclothes), and thinks about how she has to take baths with her eyes closed. Another has a pet swamp dragon (which doesn&#39;t seem at risk of exploding).<br><br>Put together, this feels like people who&#39;ve put a lot of effort into their story - but aren&#39;t sure how well <i>their</i> characters (and plot) hold up. So, both confidence and concrit.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You would be correct Mister Huinesoron. Most of us - myself as an exception - feel confident about the fanfic and do wish to improve upon it anyway possible.<br><br>Admitly I made an OC dragon with the thought in mind that it is not a common dragon and from a undocumented species that lives underground. I&#39;m hoping it isn&#39;t a major issue. The witch on the other hand I had in mind having gymnophobia, not sure if it is the accurate depiction of it but I&#39;m hoping it is okay enough.<br><br>And thank you Neshomeh for the welcome. We&#39;re for the most part looking for critical feedback and I imagine most of us are both confident of our work and enjoy writing the fanfic for the fun. That and writing anything I imagine is a gamble as to rather people like it or not, we don&#39;t get enough feedback to tell if we&#39;re hitting the marks right or not. Therefore we welcome any that helps out.</p>

            <p>Do any of you have access to <i>The Last Hero</i>? I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a double-page spread of dragon breeds in there somewhere.

            <p>I&#39;m afraid I might have slipped up in that regard (along with the golem&#39;s speech which is suppose to capital first letter at the start of each word).<br><br>Not sure if I can correct Alfie&#39;s appearance now... I could state later in the story that it is more of a subterranean lizard than a dragon which can make a chemical reaction in its mouth that&#39;s similar to breathing fire but more like a brief few sounds of fire that one would think it was a firecracker.<br><br>It would get rid of the dragon issue but create a new problem as well I guess.</p>

            <p>Okay, just went and reread the original description Rustic had for Alphie and given the rule &#39;don&#39;t introduce something unless you intend to use it&#39; and the skit we have in mind, this would be a case where going with what we have would work better.<br><br>Without giving too much away, it involves a Wish.<br><br>Here&#39;s the full description Rust had originally, which in retrospect we probably should&#39;ve worked in to begin with:<br><br>&quot;Richard’s dragon is a highly debated issue among his fellow watchmen and even among people who’ve met him and his ‘supposed dragon’. All can agree is that it looks nothing like your usual swamp dragon. Too sleek looking and nimble moving to be a dragon, no wings and looks more like a scaly mink the size of a man’s leg.&quot;<br><br>That ought to narrow it down in case we actually can come to a compromise with canon, which given this is a relatively minor point, it might be best to just let lie, considering how early on this story is at present.<br><br>We do have plans for everything we&#39;ve added so far, it&#39;s just a matter of seeing them all through and getting back to posting on a semi-regular basis.</p>

            <p>The OCs were developed using somewhat of a RP character sheet, so there&#39;s a reason for the RP vibe you are getting.<br><br>Hopefully we can iron out the kinks as we go along in writing the story. We probably might break some rules but we&#39;re avoiding as many pitfalls as we can and cushion the blow of breaking the said rules.<br><br>And I know that looking to the PPC is probably not a wise decision for confidence but Blood made this comment:<br><br>&quot;Sooo...<br><br>Do you think GoG would come under fire from the PPC?<br><br>Because I&#39;d be cool with it getting Sporked, if only because of the entertainment value.&quot;<br><br>Sorry for repeating some stuff over again, this like talking to the SCP Foundation all over again.</p>

            <p>My personal rule of OCs is &#39;one coincidence per main character&#39;. In this case, all your characters have been selected to play in the Game. They should then have <i>no more than one</i> plot-relevant attribute that&#39;s independent from that selection. It&#39;s a bit tricky in this case, given that they could well have been selected <i>for</i> their attributes, but it&#39;s still a good starting place.<br><br>And... hrm. Tell you what. If you give me a few days, I can send Agents Kaitlyn and Selene on an information-gathering run through the Prologue, see what <i>they</i> think. Interested?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Sure, constructive criticism was what we were hoping for with soliciting reviews here.<br><br>Can&#39;t say for sure whether all our OCs follow it, but most do off the top of my head.<br><br>We&#39;ve currently got two chapter sitting ninety percent finished with a third in progress as well and regarding The Last Hero, no, I don&#39;t think any of us have a copy.<br>The closest I got was a digital copy someone linked once, but the thread is long gone by now.<br><br>And Anonymous reviews are allowed, so feel free to give the bullet points version down the bottom when you&#39;re done.</p>

            <p>To be fair, the sorts of arguments like the one I expect you&#39;re referencing (the return of zdimensia) are very much <i>not</i> the norm around here. Yes, we have disagreements, some of which go farther than others; but just about everything tends to be resolved quickly, people can generally figure out when to take a step back on their own or at others&#39; urging, and--I stress this--it practically <i>never</i> goes as far as that particular argument. We do get some ugliness, but generally that&#39;s, I don&#39;t know, once every few years? Maybe hS has the figures; I certainly don&#39;t, beyond what I&#39;ve seen and bits of what I&#39;ve heard.<br><br>Essentially, in my experience, most of the people we attract as a community are people who can either function well as part of the community or, occasionally, who decide on their own to take a step back (sometimes in the form of a break) until they can. I can&#39;t tell you exactly how rare a case like zdimensia&#39;s is; but I <i>can</i> tell you that, in a little over two years, that&#39;s the only official ban I&#39;ve ever seen handed down (and thus, the only one I&#39;ve ever seen broken.) As for blocking, I think the only other blocks I&#39;ve seen have been for things like spambots.<br><br>So, hunky-dory? No, not always, but that&#39;s people for you. Fortunately, however, we tend to be able to handle the non-hunky-dory moments in a relatively mature manner, on the Board and hopefully off of it as well.<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: Although, you may have a slight point: &#39;speak of the drama, and it shall appear&#39;? :D<br><br>...well, great.

            <p>But Tungsten_Monk&#39;s responses to it were amazing.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>A dissertation on trolls: part II<br><br>Hmmm.<br><br>Let&#39;s all play Troll Analysis, shall we?<br><br>Line one: &quot;you&#39;re all rather happily missing the point, are you not?&quot;<br>Comment: WHAT point? In your last post, you said one thing: &#39;ppc sucks.&#39; That&#39;s not a point. To make a point, you have to have at least a viable argument, and viable arguments are based on fact. You, my yellow winkie friend, had an opinion, not a fact. Therefore, if we&#39;re all happily missing a point, then it&#39;s a point you didn&#39;t mention. Do you expect us to be psychic?<br><br>Line two: &quot;oh dear oh dear&quot;<br>Comment: &quot;Oh dear&quot; is an old device of faux mockery. It&#39;s applied sarcastically as the mocker fakes an innocent manner, thus implying that the mockee&#39;s conduct is shocking enough to put off a sweet, kindly, innocent person. It&#39;s also weak, weak, weak. You don&#39;t turn up to mock a board full of grammar freaks and post something utterly lacking in capitalization and punctuation. By doing so, you inadvertantly make yourself into a figure of fun, not of terror or anger.<br><br>Line three: &quot;soon it will all crumble from the inside&quot;<br>Comment: Logically flawed. Crumbling, at least in physical structures, is caused by the wear and tear of weathering, water and wind erosion, and so forth. Because such erosion hits the outside of a structure, not the inside, a physical object cannot crumble from the inside.<br><br>Granted, you&#39;re probably being metaphorical. In that case, let&#39;s look at this logically: crumbling begins with a single fault point, a flaw, which grows into a large breakage over time. This is true of both physical objects and of organizations such as the PPC. Therefore, there must be a flaw in the PPC. What flaw? Is this whatever point we&#39;re supposedly missing? It would seem so. Maybe your computer&#39;s mucked up, winkie, but we&#39;re only getting about 1/3 of your total message. Try checking your hard drive.<br><br>Line four: &quot;just wait and see, ppc people&quot;<br>Comment: Once again, you&#39;re still not making sense. A well-reasoned, clarified argument with a legitimate grievance might actually cause some consternation among the PPC; however, once again you resort to melodrama to get your point across . . . and there&#39;s still no point to be seen. If you&#39;re going to make a threat- such as your ubiquitous &#39;just wait and see&#39;- it&#39;s a good idea to actually include the threat in the threatening statement. You don&#39;t say &quot;And if you don&#39;t obey me, I&#39;ll kill you&quot; and leave out the &quot;I&#39;ll kill you,&quot; would you? Doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br>Line five: &quot;wait and see&quot;<br>Comment: Lord preserve us from winkies who think they know how to be mysterious. You&#39;re attempting to be ominous and failing miserably. Wait and see for what? Once again you threaten without an actual threat.<br><br>Go back to the land of the West, winkie. You&#39;re nothing but a laughingstock here.<br><br><hr>

            <p>And, BTW, they do break the theme naming - all characters in MGLN aside from a couple that are leftovers from its progenitor, Triangle Hearts, are either directly named after cars (Subaru, obvs, the Ferrari Testarossa, etc) or after Japanese pronunciation of said cars (Yuuno is named after the  Mazda Eunos). Neither &#39;Chrysae&#39; nor &#39;Aeda&#39; fit either.

            <p>This is for the Tenth Walker badfic I&#39;m doing. I thought maybe she could be challenged to single combat, but then there&#39;s the problem that, being a Sue, the Fellowship won&#39;t want her out of their sights. And at the point in the badfic I&#39;m at, she hasn&#39;t shown her Warrior!Sue side yet. She&#39;s demonstrated the sides of Angst!, Speshul-Relative!, Chosen One!, Prodigy!, Magical!, and Nice!Sue. Right now, the Fellowship just left Rivendell, but they are out in some faraway forest, a Generic one.</p>

            <p>If in the fic the Fellowship goes through Moria, I have an idea.  You could use your Khajiit (I forget his name at this point).  Khajiit have always been masters of stealth.  So you could have him hide in a dark corner wait until the Fellowship passes, snatch the Sue then retreat into on of the darker recesses of Moria.  Alternatively any sufficiently dark area could also work.</p>

            <p>Does she go off to angst or something at any point? Could you carry the mission that far?<br><br>Failing that, I think the single combat idea could work. The Fellowship would likely respect a request to keep out of it, especially if the Sue herself makes it while they&#39;re still under her control. Of course, the agents could have a bit of peril once they kill the Sue if the characters don&#39;t snap back into character immediately. That could be fun. OTOH, there&#39;s no real reason killing the Sue shouldn&#39;t allow the canons to return to their proper characterizations in a Mary Sue mission, so you could avoid it if that&#39;s better for the story.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>An important question is, does she at any point in the badfic, demonstrate any fighting skills? Because some Sues will boast about their proficiency with a blade/bow/whatever but never actually show said skills. Which means you can take it all as being a lie; they have no idea how to handle a weapon and will be an easy kill.<br><br>As for how you get her away from the others, my agents usually just open a portal underneath the Sue and let her fall through into wherever they want her.

            <p>I know you wanted a few more months to calm down enough that you wouldn&#39;t pitch a toddler temper tantrum every time I failed to read your mind, but you&#39;ve used up your quota of talking me into doing things that I don&#39;t want to do.  My mistake was in trying to please the unpleasable.<br><br>Walking on eggshells not to upset someone is a symptom of abuse.  Feeling like your feelings and opinions are rarely validated is also a symptom.  Feeling like you&#39;re unable to discuss problems is also a sign.  Every time I tried to politely open a conversation about the problems I was having, you either ignored or attacked me.<br><br>I&#39;m using up the last shred of respect I have for you, (and a promise not to let things fester,) to warn you that by next fall, your abuse may be irredeemable.  You may still choose to wait until then to have a civilized discussion about what you did wrong.  I encourage you to take a full week to think about it.<br></p>

            <p>Usually, we use it to sniff out bad writers. However, it also works to see how the bad writers handle rejection. If they are a bad writer who is trying to improve, they will take the rejection for what it is, look over why they did not make it, and try to improve. If they are a toxic member of the community, however, they will show themselves as such. They will whine, complain, and blame the system for their failure. Truth be told, it is really easy to get permission. You just have to show you can write well. Not brilliant, you&#39;re not submitting a story for a Hugo award. Just, decent, and with some humor.<br><br>Is our system perfect? Maybe not, there is almost always room for improvement. But is it hideously broken? Absolutely not. It is a far sight better then what we used to have, that&#39;s for sure. Used to have almost no structure, just send in a story, and hope the Permission Giver who reads it likes it. So much nicer to have a guideline and prompt to work with. <br><br>So, I am glad to see our filtration system has worked. Goodbye, and as far as I am concerned, good riddance. This community was clearly not for you.<br><br><img src="http://fuuu.us/20.png" alt="http://fuuu.us/20.png"> </p>

            <p>If your goal is to parody fanfiction, the PPC isn&#39;t the only way to go about it.  There are other &quot;Sue hunter&quot; groups you can look into, you can write MSTs, do a webcomic, even just compose essays critiquing negative fanfiction tropes.

            <p>(And I&#39;m genuinely curious about this; not trying to be disrespectful in any way.)<br>If you were so upset with us last time, why did you come back?<br>I seem to recall that we already had a civilised discussion when you left/got banned last time. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I wasn&#39;t involved that much. And as Tira pointed out, it&#39;s been 10 months in which we literally haven&#39;t done anything to attack you.

            <p>Hypocrite time...<br><br>7. If someone says something that seems offensive, but you’re not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. Astonishingly enough, most people aren’t out to offend anyone. (If they are being deliberately insulting, believe me, you’ll have a lot of backup.)

            <p>You throw out an insult, <i>just</i> twisty enough to be deniable, and then get offended when someone calls you on it. Good times! Makes whoever you&#39;re talking to look like a jerk (at a glance, anyway), as well as frustrating them, making it harder to stay calm in the discussion.<br><br>In this case, you said, <i>about the permission process</i>, which you first refer to as &quot;hazing,&quot; &quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&quot;<br><br>Now, because you established the subject in the previous sentence to be the permission process, there&#39;s only one way to read this: you first thought it was hazing (and thus, malicious), but then, uh… decided it was in fact merely stupidity on our part.<br><br>Iximaz, a permission giver themselves if I recall, took offense to this, and you backtracked by pretending they were misreading you (and therefore violating the Constitution).<br><br>The problem with this, of course, is that as pointed out, and <i>especially</i> given your long, long track record of calling PPC conventions, processes, and members stupid (or malicious), your meaning is <i>quite</i> clear. I remember you doing this nigh-on constantly in the old threads, and it being exhausting to try and stay polite and reasonable with someone who twisted not only your words, but their own. <br><br>Regardless, I make this point here not to try and sway you - that is clearly far beyond any of our efforts - but to hammer home the point, for anyone who&#39;s watching this without context, and at a glance, may think Iximaz is being too hard on you. I have seen this happen <i>many</i> times with aggressive, malicious people who thrive on taking offense after their insults are interpreted. There is no mistake here. <i>You</i> attacked people on this &#39;Board, <i>you</i> slung insults at members and all sundry, and this &quot;walking on eggshells&quot; excuse does not convince anyone who saw the argument that you are, or were, a victim.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s no reason for your agents to not be in-character in permission prompts.  Your prompts should essentially be a snapshot of how you plan on having your characters interact, either in a mission or in an interval.  The only thing you can&#39;t do is have them missioning an actual badfic.  You can even invent a fictional badfic for them if you - heck, I did that for one of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kjA9yd6H01pqdSctFRLKvrAh1sSc_slDVXptC_DvzdY/pub">my Permission prompts</a>.<br><br>If you can&#39;t write them in-character for your Permission prompt, then you probably aren&#39;t familiar enough for them.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s no reason why it could not occasionally happen. Minis come from misspellings and they&#39;re usually powerful but non-unique monsters from the continuum or occasionally small versions of the characters. Many minis have their personalities influenced by which name they&#39;re misspelled from.<br><br>The precedent that has been set is that the vast majority of minis are of the standard type, but a very few could be different. If you do this, try to have a reason for it--if the sentence that creates the mini includes a hint that it could be something other than standard. Say a Harry Potter mini is given a description that sounds like it should be a snake--you could have a mini-basilisk named Foldemort or something.</p>

            <p>The difference between writing original fiction and fanfiction is that, in one way, fanfiction is easier, because fanfiction writers can use what already has been created and don’t need to think up everything themselves, but in another way, original fiction is easier, because fanfiction writers must work with what is already there and cannot make up whatever seems convenient.<br><br>The same should be true for PPCing. Once the mini for a continuum is defined, it is part of the PPC canon and we should work with it, not come up with new varieties, not even in very rare cases (which actually translates to: whenever the writer really wants it to happen). <br><br>To use your example, &quot;Foldemort&quot; conveniently spawning as a mini-Basilisk would probably look like lazy writing to me, as if the writer could not think of a way to show that a mini-Aragog got Voldemort’s personality, but wanted to make a connection and thus went with &quot;they both have snakelike features&quot;.  It may not appear to be lazy if it is really well written, but even then I would prefer to see the same amount of effort put into writing a mini-Acromantula with some snakelike traits.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Why not have both? An alternate mini would already be pretty rare, but it would also usually have some characteristics of a regular mini.<br><br>Let&#39;s use a mini-Warg as a basis for this. His name is Olifant, and he was spawned when some Suethor misspelled Oliphaunt.<br><br>When one such creature does appear, there is a 50/50 chance that Olifant will be either a normal mini-warg or have features similar to a balrogs-being shrouded in flames, demonic horns, bat like wings, etc. However, Olifant could also have other odd features. Being spawned from a misspelling of Oliphaunt, he could have large tusks or leathery skin similar to an elephant&#39;s. This way, not only can we have alternate minis, we also have far more legroom to make each mini unique.</p>

            <p>The truth of the matter is, Tolkien lacked one important thing from his copy of the Red Book of Westmarch: he didn&#39;t have a <i>map</i>. All the maps drawn later were his reconstructions from the information in the text - and what the Professor never realised is that the Red Book was <i>not</i> written in the lands that became Europe.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Middle-earthNewPerspective.jpg"><br><br>Yes, that&#39;s right: Middle-earth was North America, and Aman was the entirety of Eurasafrica. The truth of this is obvious, when you think about it: where did civilisation first arise? In the Middle-east (where we can assume the Two Trees once grew - yes, it&#39;s rather further from the coast than we&#39;re accustomed to thinking, but the Eldar would think nothing of taking a two-year trip to visit them), and in China (ie, the vicinity of Tirion and Alqualonde).<br><br>The elves obviously awoke around the Great Lakes; this matches nicely with Latter-day Saint/Mormon folklore, and indicates that Joseph Smith (who <s>all</s> <s>many</s> some know was prone to translating ancient documents) had at some point a copy of the Red Book. Men first arose somewhere east of the Orocarni (the Appalachians), and journeyed west over the Misty Mountains (the southern Rockies) and the Blue Mountains (northern Rockies and everything west of the Utah valley) to reach Beleriand (now sadly sunken into the Pacific due to the actions of the San Andreas fault).<br><br>Numenor once stood in the middle of the Pacific/Belegaer, though only the central mountain and some scattered islands now remain (as Hawai&#39;i). The Gondorian claim that after the world was made round they found &#39;new lands&#39; on the other side, and sailed all the way round, is patently false: they had only nine Numenorean ships, and given the general decay of their technology, clearly didn&#39;t retain the art of shipbuilding. The Eldar simply kept quiet about the fact that Valinor was just as accessible as ever.<br><br>Japan is of course Tol Eressea, the Lonely Isle: resettled by the Eldar on their return from North America. You know how DNA evidence draws a link between eastern Asia and North America? Across the Bering Straits? Yeah, that was the Noldor.<br><br>There have been some changes in the geography of Middle-earth, though not nearly as extensive as you might think if you only know Tolkien&#39;s maps. Mordor has been submerged into the combined seas of Rhun and Nurn, which have in turn joined up with the eastern ocean. Possibly at the same time, Arnor and the Shire became a desert - Utah, Nevada, and so forth. It&#39;s a sad end for the poor hobbits, but it&#39;s possibly they survived and escaped to Canada.<br><br>The Eldar have long since faded - note that the Chinese and Japanese do not have significantly longer lifespans than Native Americans (though they do retain knowledge of the healing magics they can no longer perform...), but remain in their ancient lands. And mortal men...<br><br>Well, mortal men have had it pretty bad. You see, the only logical conclusion from all of this is that Europe - the land of pale-skinned, pale-haired, pale-eyed folk - is the Halls of Mandos. We Europeans, and those of European extraction, <i>are actually the spirits of dead elves</i>. And we&#39;ve spent the past few centuries invading every land we can get to. The race of mortal men - Native Americans - is subjugated under the hand of the incarnate spectres of the Firstborn Children of Iluvatar.<br><br>Australia is Avathar, where Ungoliant once lived and her children still do. Tolkien at one point mentioned the idea that mortal men wandered in Avathar after their deaths, so it may well be that Australian Aboriginals are similarly-incarnated former Men (ie, Native Americans). And Africa?<br><br>Well, there&#39;s only one people left to add, isn&#39;t there? Africa is clearly the home of the Maiar.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Middle-earth archaeology community is split over whether the Rio Grande or the Colorado River is the ancient Anduin. Supporters of the Rio Grande theory highlight the matching of Gondorian cities to archaeological sites, and general overall geography; supporters of the Colorado pin their theory on the smaller scale required - more closely matching the Red Book.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ColoradoAnduin.png"><br><br>The main flaw cited in the Colorado theory is the artificiality of the &#39;White Mountains&#39;; they are simply a continuation of the Blue Mountains. The position of Rohan also has to be somewhat stretched, actually incorporating a sea-coast under some interpretations.<br><br>Nevertheless, it has its supporters, and the Colorado version does allow Moria (here identified with Mt. Timpanogos, Utah) to be placed west of Anduin, instead of north of it.<br><br>However, it does <i>not</i> allow this image...<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Mastodons_1.png"><br><br>... and is therefore strictly inferior.<br><br>hS, drawing on similar debate about the Book of Mormon</p>

            <p>Definitely the last one, at any rate. ^_^<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Mexicondor.png"><br><br>The difficulty with pinning down the precise geography of Gondor is that Anduin the Great (AKA the Rio Grande) no longer flows in to Belegaer; when Mordor was broken, it was diverted to feed into what we now call the Gulf of Mexico. So while I&#39;ve sketched in its course to pass through the lowest point on the map, it&#39;s entirely possible that it used turn west further up the White Mountains. Actually, Acapulco looks like a good spot for Dol Amroth; the fall of Mordor must have raised the White Mountains somewhat. So this map is already wrong!<br><br>Precisely where the cities of Gondor lay is open for debate; Mexico City was probably either Osgiliath or Minas Tirith itself, but without the course of Anduin pinned down, we can&#39;t say for sure.<br><br>hS, having fun</p>

            <p>Through Tolkien&#39;s colour symbolism, if nothing else - and I realise that&#39;s rather a loaded statement. It was the fair-haired and fair-skinned bastions of civilization against the swarthier, darker peoples of Mordor, Rhun, and Harad. Or at least, that is the most popular reading; if you know better, do let me know.<br><br>Also, Mesoamerican cloud cities make for a much more evocative image than bog-standard Swan King castles.

            <p>Not only did he not have access to a map - he was working far outside his competence area.

            <p>That... can that possibly <i>not</i> mean &#39;White Mountain&#39;? Yep, I&#39;m won over.<br><br>Unfortunately, we&#39;ve run into a bit of a chronology problem. The Third Age ended 6000 years ago, but the earliest attested Mesoamerican culture, the Olmecs, were barely <i>four</i> thousand years ago. Which...<br><br>Wait, maybe it&#39;s not so bad. Tolkien thought we were just entering the Seventh Age, right? So:<br><br>Third Age: ends 4000 BC.<br>Fourth Age: 4000 BC - 2000 BC. Ends with the sinking of Mordor. Destroys utterly all major cities in <s>the Americas</s> Middle-earth. Society regresses to pre-civilised status.<br>Fifth Age: 2000 BC - AD 33 (because of course). The remnants of mortal society rebuild, starting with the Olmec and running down the list. Some old cities are rebuilt, including Minas Tirith/Monte Alban. The peoples of Middle-earth continue building step-pyramids, just like they learned from the Numenoreans (Hawaiians, remember).<br>Sixth Age: AD 33 to AD 1945. The Sixth Age starts with the &#39;Old Hope&#39; - the incarnation of Iluvatar in the world. Towards its end, it becomes the tale of Elvish ghosts invading and conquering the lands of men. It ends with the Second German War, and the collapse of the last ghostish empires.<br>Seventh Age: AD 1945 - present. As with every other age-turnover, the Seventh starts with environmental upheaval... ;)<br><br>(So why is Christianity in this? Well, because it&#39;s in Middle-earth! But Jesus under this conception is... pretty different to the version you&#39;re thinking of. Remember, he&#39;s born in <i>Valinor</i> - and goes about preaching &#39;resurrection to eternal life&#39; to a people who <b>were once immortal</b>. Whole new angle, right there.)<br><br>All we need to do now is find some natural disasters taking place round about 2000 BC, and we can pin a specific date on the sinking of Mordor. Maybe we can tie it into the Biblical Flood, too, that&#39;d be fun(ny). ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There have been some interesting tidbits from my trawling through the internet. One, which may or may not be correct, is that A Great Big Something Happened around 2200 BCE. The weird part is that the data from this period doesn&#39;t really look like it came from a volcanic eruption. I&#39;ll link you to the (quite dry and written by a Finnish EFL speaker) article <a href="http://personal.eunet.fi/pp/tilmari/tilmari2.htm#siscamb">here</a>.<br><br>Basically, for the purposes of this thought experiment, I am choosing to believe means Mordor sank as a result of a meteor crashing into the Halls of Mandos, or whatever central Anatolia constitutes in this discussion. Again, while this is ever so slightly dubious, it&#39;s such an awesome image that I can&#39;t ignore it. =]<br><br>Also: this thing takes the Sixth Age as the rise of the Late Classical Mesoamerican civilizations, right? So, while it might not be entirely germane, we at least have, in Tenochtitlan...<br><br><img src="http://www.vivamexico.info/Peintures/Autre/Plan-de-Tenochtitlan.jpg"><br><br>Laketown.<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>Also also: Harad is supposed to be far to the south, right? Sort of on the top edge of South America, if Mordor is currently the damp bit between Florida and everywhere else. Now, an interesting point about the etymology of the term &quot;desert&quot; is that it was <i>also</i> used to describe places modern observers would call &quot;jungle&quot;...<br><br>Implying that Harad? Not a big sandy desert in this timeline. Actually, it lines up with what&#39;s now the northern coast of Venezuela and the islands off it. What&#39;s also worth noting is that there were several species of megafauna endemic to that part of the world, primarily toxodonts - big, shaggy-looking things that resemble hornless rhinos. They also had giant ground sloths and the frankly adorable glyptodonts. And these were definitely around during the Third Age of our timeline - we&#39;ve got finds dating from up to 1000 BCE, far outstripping the sinking of Mordor.<br><br>I am therefore choosing to believe that Mumakil and Oliphaunts are in fact shaggy rhino-looking things and/or overgrown armadillos.<br><br>And I&#39;m perfectly bloody fine with that. =]</p>

            <p>Also - Rohan is <i>weird</i> in this timeline. Did all the horses die or something? Because - and this is probably where I&#39;ve missed something - horses arrived in the Americas courtesy of Europeans. This implies that either the Rohirrim were just <i>really</i> fast runners, or that...<br><br>Well, the fossil record of Nevada (which is where you plonked Isengard) is an interesting one, and they&#39;ve dug up a lot of stuff - including mastodons. This implies that the Horse Lords rode no horses. Instead, they rode mastodons. I LOVE THIS SO MUCH YOU DON&#39;T EVEN KNOW.<br><br>This implies that the famous stables of the Second and First Ages and the Mearas in general? Also mastodons.<br><br>((while there&#39;s evidence of prehistoric horses in nevada i dont care i want the rohirrim to ride mastodons u cant stop me))</p>

            <p>I forgot that you&#39;d sort of put Rohan around northern Texas, with Edoras roughly where Dallas is now. What&#39;s interesting is that there&#39;s quite a lot of evidence that prehistoric horses were around in Texas until ca. 11000 years ago, but I&#39;d like to counter-argue that mastodons are cool so I want Theoden riding a mastodon provide me with this immediately.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>This is an amendment originally proposed last year. No-one was against its inclusion, but I decided not to add it due to only having six supporters.<br><br>It replaces Section 1 of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the PPC Constitution</a> entirely, and creates a new Section 2 at the end of it (pushing the current Section 2 down to 3, and so forth). I&#39;ve nicknamed it the <b>Dispute Resolution Amendment</b>.<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>Section One: On The Capacity To Engage In Mature Conversation</b><br><br>1. Discrimination and persecution of any kind will not be tolerated, especially on the basis of sexism, racism, ableism, nationalism, homophobia, transphobia, or religion. We will not tolerate individual people or groups who intentionally oppress, persecute, abuse, other, use or otherwise attack others in any way, shape or form, for any reason. [Unchanged, I think]<br><br>1.5. This includes ‘joking’ about such subjects. If people are discriminated against or persecuted because of something, making jokes about it is Not Funny. Equally, jokes about rape, murder, abuse, and mental health issues are Not Funny - nor is anything which causes genuine suffering. ‘It was just a joke’ is not an excuse - it’s self-incrimination. [Partly taken from old Article 3; the first two sentences are new]<br><br>2. Do Not Flame. You are allowed to disagree with people, but Do Not Flame. There is a distinct difference between &#39;I don&#39;t agree with your opinion and I think that your theory is factually wrong&#39; and &#39;You&#39;re an idiot and your opinion is built on lies and stupidity&#39;. If you find that you&#39;re hurling insults around, just stop. This even (or perhaps especially) applies if you consider yourself to have been wronged by another community member. If it’s a misunderstanding, a flame is an unwarranted attack. And if they’re deliberately trying to provoke you, attacking them is exactly what they want - and damages the community as a whole. [First half as Article 2; second half is new]<br><br>3. Respect is key to getting along with the community. Everyone in the PPC Community should be respected as people, regardless of who they are. The opinions of a newbie are just as valid and wanted as those of someone here for ten years. Opinions should be treated with respect - and, equally, should be respectful opinions. An opinion that attacks, insults, demeans, or discriminates against others (see Article 1) is not respectful, and is not welcome - and someone who shows themself to be unashamedly disrespectful, or repeatedly posts disrespectful opinions, has forfeited their right to respect. However, not warranting respect does not mean they do not warrant politeness. This means you are not allowed to descend into flaming and insulting them, but instead should follow Article 7. [Mostly Articles 6 and 5, in that order]<br><br>4. We encourage respectful, friendly debates here. Should a debate escalate into an argument for any reason, everyone involved should step back and calm down before continuing. If this cannot be done, it may be best to abandon the conversation entirely. [The rest of Article 5]<br><br>5. If someone says something that seems offensive, but you’re not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. Astonishingly enough, most people aren’t out to offend anyone. (If they are being deliberately insulting, believe me, you’ll have a lot of backup.) Don&#39;t be afraid to ask what someone meant - it isn&#39;t silly to want the full facts. Equally, if there has been an honest misunderstanding, accept the mistake and move on. Apologies for making a mistake, and for being unclear, are recommended, but should not be demanded. [Article 7, with an addition of two sentences at the end]<br><br>6. All discovered mimes will be thrown into a pit, which may or may not be filled with various objects such as scorpions upon their availability. [Per Article 10]<br><br>6.5. There will be no clemency for these mimes until they learn the words. [Per Article 10.5]<br><br><b>Section Two: On Making Reparations</b><br><br>7. Everyone deserves an honest second chance - which means, initially, a chance to stop, explain, and/or apologise. This means that, if you believe that someone is engaged in any violation of the Constitution, but particularly Articles 1-3, it is critical to make sure they understand what they are doing wrong, so that they can make amends. Explain it to them yourself, or ask a third party to do so - but the key word is explain. Telling someone to shut up because their opinion is unwanted does not constitute a chance. [Rewrite of Article 4]<br><br>8. Wilful ignorance is not an excuse. If someone is ignoring the Constitution and claiming that they’re not really doing anything wrong - despite explanations to the contrary - that may constitute using up their chance. However, wilful ignorance on the part of the accuser is also not an excuse. If someone clarifies a genuine misunderstanding, continuing to push for an apology may count as persecution on your part. [New article]<br><br>9. If you find it impossible to get along with another member of the PPC, you can take it up in private e-mail. However, the rules of civility and respect do not disappear outside PPC community spaces, or while talking about someone. Don’t engage in bullying behaviour, and don’t say anything about another PPCer you wouldn’t say to their face. Harassing others by private means is just as serious as harassing them in public, if not more so, and will be treated as such - which means that if you find yourself being harassed or bullied by another PPCer, please make the community aware! We cannot help with a situation if we don’t know it exists. [Rewrite of Article 8. Hieronymus asked last time if we can clarify how to make the community aware - I&#39;d like to suggest adding a parenthetical &#39;(emailling an uninvolved member of the community is a good way to do this)&#39;.]<br><br>10. The PPC as a community is responsible for upholding the Constitution. If following Article 7 doesn&#39;t resolve a situation, any and all uninvolved community members have a responsibility to back up the person who is in the right, or to defuse an unclear situation. It is never wrong to ask a third party to comment on a dispute - but try to find someone uninvolved; you want an honest comment, not just someone to say you’re right. [Reworking of Article 9. I asked if the last clause could do with rephrasing, since I think it&#39;s a bit blunt]<br><br>10.5. If discussion is unable to resolve a situation, persistent rule-breakers can be shunned or told to leave the PPC community. We don’t want to do this - so if you&#39;re being accused of breaking a rule, take a step back and, if you are in the wrong, stop, apologise, and move on. Grudges are no fun! [From Article 9]<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So: any thoughts? Any rewrites? Any supporters or, um, un-supporters? Anyone got any other Amendments they want to put forward?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, to start off with, the main reason for the inclusion of &#39;nationalism&#39; was due to remembering the issue with OrangeDream, who thought country of birth and country of residence were perfectly fine targets to use to utter bile in regards to.<br><br>...But instead of demonstrating thus, I will use some handpuppets instead!<br><br>*pulls out two handpuppets.

Moxie promptly informs Lacksy that Saturland is a third world country and would best be taken over by a neighboring country for the good of its people, and that Saturlandians are taking all the jobs, at which point Lacksy would probably be highly offended.<br><br><i>That</i> would not be okay. <br><br>A disccusion between Lacksy and Moxie of the employment issues in Saturland would be okay. Even political talk!<br><br>But the point at which Moxie begins to assert and treat Moxie like her country is intrinsicly inferior to Lacksy&#39;s and that it is a problem to be dealt with by a more advanced or strong nature, that is not okay.</p>

            <p>Most of these look pretty good, and I like the idea behind the Dispute Resolution Amendment.

            <p>I, however, do have a slight problem with the language of Article 4.  I do not like &quot;Should debate escalate into an argument for any reason...&quot;  At least to me, I feel like it is a bit over broad.  Arguments, to me anyways, are not necessarily the heated fights you are trying prevent.  An argument, as I understand it, is essentially a point one is trying to make with adequate support.  I think it might be better written as:<br><br>4.  We encourage respectful, friendly debates here.

            <p>What do you all think about maybe a list of words that are prohibited?  I was thinking back to a certain event that arose from a misunderstanding.  Because of the high level of diversity of the community, misunderstandings are bound to occur, and these can often times lead to visceral, emotional responses.    To offset this risk, a list of certain prohibited words might go a long way.  Just a thought.</p>

            <p>All swear words. The only word that may be considered for inclusion is the one you are referring to. And, ironic it may be, due to my position when that little kerfuffle happened, I support never using it. It has clearly hurt a lot of people, and is a sore subject for many others. However, due to the ambiguous nature of the word, a simple reminder in case it is used should be enough. Nothing like beating them over the head or even a harsh reprehend for using it, just inform them that the word they thought was safe is actually highly offensive to many other cultures.<br><br>For the purposes of those who may not be aware, the word in question is spastic. If you are not from America, you probably cringed. However, if you are from America, you are likely confused. Basically, we have two different  definitions of the word. In America, it is erratic clumsiness. A hyperactive ADD kid would likely be called a spaz in the US. No real serious insult, nobody I have ever met in the States has ever taken any offence to that word.  In Europe however, the UK especially, it is one of the most ablest slurs you can say, just short of or equal to retard. It is quite literally a fighting word for many people. As in, you say it, they will fight you. If you want to know more, read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Spastic">this.</a><br><br>Now, unless you are furthering the notion that we should make a list of words to never use (which I am against, as it is silly, and likely to cause more drama then it is worth) this conversation is <i><b>over.</b></i></p>

<li>The PPC community will not tolerate any individual or group who intentionally discriminates against, abuses, persecutes, or otherwise attacks others in any way, shape, or form, for any reason. This includes but is not limited to sexism, racism, ableism, nationalism, homophobia, transphobia, and religious discrimination.<br><br>1.5. These subjects, and others which cause genuine suffering (such as rape, murder, abuse, and mental health issues) should be discussed with sensitivity. The use of language which evokes any form of discrimination or persecution should not be tolerated.

<br><br>I&#39;ve tried to tighten up the language a little on 1, and reworked 1.5 to start a little more positively (&#39;be sensitive&#39;, not yet another &#39;don&#39;t&#39;), but also to cover language. Does &#39;evokes&#39; work in there?<br><br>hS</li>

            <p>I was just more so thinking of trying to avoid someone accidentally stirring up a hornet&#39;s nest.  I do not like nationalism&#39;s inclusion though.  Like World-Jumper suggests it does seem over broad to me.  Because while it does cover clearly offensive stereotypes it also could theoretically prohibit someone from saying &quot;my country is better at [insert sport] than yours&quot; which does not seem to fit in with the rest of the provision.<br><br>I think that changing it to something like: This includes, but is not limited to <b>discrimination on the basis of sex, race, ability, national origin, sexual orientation, and religion. </b><br><br>I would also possibly put some reference to insulting political affiliation as well.  Just so we have all the basis covered.</p>

It has of late, at least in my area, very easy to basically say &quot;You are a Republican?  So you are a racist, sexist, etc.,&quot;  Which is not true, and politics is something that we should be able to discuss, but has the ability to descend into flaming, fighting, and everything these amendments are trying to prevent.

If you look at that list and think &#39;man, Republicans totally have it worse than all those people!&#39;... um, just no.<br><br>More to the point: we don&#39;t <i>need</i> it. The article already says we won&#39;t tolerate discrimination for any reason. It also says we won&#39;t tolerate any group which intentionally discriminates.

In all our history. I know very sparingly, but just how sparing is it? No, spambots do not count. Not unless you want to make that a separate statistic.)</p>

            <p>The thing to remember is that we didn&#39;t <i>have</i> it until 2008 - that&#39;s when Dann claimed admin access to the Board from the long-departed <a href="mailto:P@L">P@L</a>.<br><br>I seem to recall... oh, yes. Waaaaay back in 2004, red wolf was annoying enough that Bast emailled P@L to get it blocked. It left by itself before she did so, though.<br><br>And... well, the whole question is a little vague anyway. As I said when we banned zdimensia and Ammo Guy, the IP block is just a technical enforcement of a community-delivered decision. So does DoctorHello, who was emphatically told to leave, count? He was never IP banned. What about people who weren&#39;t told to leave, but were just made emphatically unwelcome?<br><br>PPC bans are from the community, not from any admin team. That makes them a lot harder to quantify. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What exactly do you mean by &quot;nationalism?&quot; I get what you are trying to prevent: Pollacks are idiots, Germans are Nazis, ect. However, due to the very clear, &quot;in any way, shape, or form, for any reason&quot; I want to be sure. Are gentle pokes, such like I made with Sergio over the &quot;our pizza is superior&quot; thing, or light ribbing during the World Cup, acceptable? Or do we want to avoid all of those things? I would hope not, national pride and minor competition is fun and healthy. But if that is the way the board wants to roll, so be it.</p>

            <p>That whole phrase was added as part of the First Amendment, which was back in 2012.

And probably should be wary of such groups.</i><br><br>hS: I&#39;m not writing the wording. So it&#39;s up to someone else to decide whether to list everyone who can&#39;t be discriminated against, list everyone who can be discriminated against, or say something really clever that covers both.<br><br><i>July: An attempt. A) Discrimination and persecution on the basis of sexism, racism, ableism, nationalism, homophobia, and transphobia are not going to be tolerated- this means we will not tolerate individual people or groups with the distinct goal of opppressing, persecuting, othering or otherwise using others.</i><br><br><hr>

            <p>Just a quick question: why don&#39;t you guys use the Sarlacc more often? It&#39;s the perfect Sue disposal system: nobody&#39;s stupid enough to go Sarlacc stomach-diving, it digests its prey far too slowly to need to worry about it getting fat, and the male sarlacc is a parasite on the female, feeding on her nutrients, so the limit of Sues we can feed to the female (It&#39;s the one you see in the films-the male&#39;s deep underground) is even higher!<br><br>Also, sorry for posting so much.

            <p>Aside from the problems already mentioned, there&#39;s a few reasons why the Sarlacc would be a bad disposal method. The reasons for disposal post-mortem have already been mentioned, so I&#39;ll stick to live disposal.<br><br>First off, the slow digestion of a Sarlacc means survival and escape are possible. Second, the Sarlacc is sentient. It feeds off of and learns from the things it is digesting. And if a Sue is being digested... well, a possessed Sarlacc won&#39;t exactly be easy to exorcise, and will be a greater threat to the agent than most Sues.<br><br>Plus, slow digestion could count as torture. A death of a thousand years...</p>

            <p>Also I imagine a reason to not do it, is that in previous canon, before the Disney Reset, Boba Fett actually survived the Sarlaac, so there is some precedence for failure.  Of course I just realized you probably mean disposal of the body, meaning the Sue is already dead, and for that go back to the reasons previously mentioned.</p>

            <p>In general, it&#39;s preferred that the Sue be disposed of within the continuum she invaded in the first place, or somewhere neutral like HQ. No need to risk spreading the contamination around. Plus, we try to keep things fresh as much as possible. Reusing the same disposal method over and over would get dull, especially in a universe as large as the SW universe. There are practically endless options to choose from, so why limit yourself?<br><br>Also, yes, kindly do slow down.

            <p>Anyway, we don&#39;t use the sarlaac more often because 1) Even with her high disposal rate, canon monsters can get fat from too many Sues, 2) We like to see variety and creativity in the disposal methods, and 3) Cross-canon executions/disposal is generally discouraged and we don&#39;t have too many <i>Star Wars</i> missions.</p>

            <p>... and realized what this actually is, or rather could be, is a <i>hyperbole</i> contest. In which case it wouldn&#39;t by definition have to be insulting toward moms, people with weight issues, people who aren&#39;t conventionally attractive, etc. Which would be perfectly fine.

            <p>Different people have different senses of humour.

            <p>White jokes are hilarious. American jokes are hilarious. Straight jokes can be a riot (which is a shame there are so few of them out there) as can wealthy jokes, hipster jokes, and almost any other joke you can think of.<br><br>However, what makes those funny? Two things: exaggeration and recognition. Otherwise known as: STEREOTYPES! Stereotypes can be super funny, no matter who it is aimed at. Why? Because we recognize the extreme aspect of the stereotype, and laugh at how outlandish it is. Is every American a fat, dumb hick from Texas, who eats hamburgers and has six guns on them at all times? Of course not! We carry twelve.<br><br>Did you chuckle? I bet you did. Now, what makes this so different from &quot;minority&quot; stereotypes? Because white, rich Americans are &quot;privileged?&quot; Everybody has problems Everybody is harmed by negative stereotypes, even the ones aimed at the &quot;privileged.&quot; Does this mean we should ban all stereotypical humor? But you yourself said you wanted us to &quot;punch up&quot; rather then &quot;punch down.&quot; There is no such thing as &quot;punching up&quot; or &quot;punching down.&quot; There is only punching. But slapstick is one of the oldest and most loved forms of comedy, so clearly punching can be super funny!<br><br>That said, I do see where you are coming from. There are jokes that do hurt others more then they should. However, the answer to this problem is not shaming everybody into thinking your way. They probably already do. They just see the humor in taking shots at anybody, rather then just the privileged. And if they are enjoying racist or sexist humor because they themselves are racist or sexist, then that is their problem they have to overcome. Address those actions, the truly harmful ones, rather then their choice in entertainment. <br><br>Awareness is the answer, and funnily enough, humor is often the way to do it. Those jokes highlight the worst of each other, making us see what is wrong with the extreme ends of society, no mater what your personal privilege score is. Every community can be improved, and it only can be by showing what the problem is. And if laughing at it is one way of it, I see no harm.<br><br>Oh, and if some forms of humor offends you, you always have the option of ignoring the comedian who makes it. I have a ton of comedians whose humor I only find crass and cruel. So, because of that, I don&#39;t support their humor by not listening to it. I do not think any less of the people who do find it funny, nor the people who make it. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll take your example:<br><br><i>Is every American a fat, dumb hick from Texas, who eats hamburgers and has six guns on them at all times? Of course not! We carry twelve.</i><br><br>That isn&#39;t a joke at the expense of Americans. It&#39;s obviously a stereotype, so you don&#39;t actually assume it&#39;s about all Americans. Equally, people aren&#39;t going to look at the topic of this thread and say &#39;how can you say such things about mothers?&#39;.<br><br>What it <i>is</i> is a joke at the expense of people who can be described as:<br><br>-Fat<br>-Dumb<br>-Hick<br>-From Texas<br>-Eats hamburgers<br>-Likes guns<br><br>You&#39;re doing the equivalent of saying &#39;Frodo&#39;s so stupid, he could be a dwarf!&#39; and then protesting that it&#39;s funny because everyone knows Frodo&#39;s not as stupid as a dwarf. Yeah, great - but it&#39;s not <i>Frodo</i> who&#39;s going to get upset. It&#39;s the dwarves you&#39;re casting as archetypically dumb.<br><br>Another way of saying it: laughing at your stereotype of &#39;Americans = fat&#39; carries with it a requirement that you agree &#39;fat = bad&#39;.<br><br>(If I haven&#39;t made my point clear, please check what I&#39;m trying to say; I&#39;m not sure how well it&#39;s come across.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Break it down, and my analogy does fall apart. I am sorry.<br><br>However, how about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK_u7yWTd3U">this,</a> an comedy sketch outlining the decline of America as we see it, taking us down a peg.

Do the rich like being attacked as uncaring, money-grubbing old men, who want to hoard as much wealth as they can? There are many, many problems the wealthy have. Why do you think so many of them take up drugs and alcohol? Pure recreation? Not likely. And even if it started that way, why do you think they keep doing it? They have to resources to clean themselves, to break the harmful cycles. Why don;t so many of them? Because they feel the need to resort to chemical alteration to have any form of joy in their lives, of cut-thought business and a loathing public.<br><br>Is any of that going to make you stop laughing at jokes about the wealthy living lives too opulent for their own good, so aloof to the problems of the very people they hire? Of course not! Nor should you. That is my point with there is no punching up, nor punching down. Only punching.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s bugging me. I only have limited time, so I must be brief, but a couple points:<br><br>1. Humor can be used to reinforce the status quo or to challenge it. When the status quo is something ugly, like &quot;it&#39;s okay to make fun of fat people&quot; or &quot;black men are criminals,&quot; isn&#39;t it far, <i>far</i> better to use humor to challenge it rather than just to have a good yuk about it?<br><br>2. Being rich means having more power and options in your life than people who are less rich. It means never having to worry about where your next meal is coming from and whether it will even be good for you, or whether you can fix the leak in your roof, or get to work regularly, or dress appropriately, or a million other things that people worse off than me have to struggle with every day. Power may be stressful, but so is living on minimum wage—and that&#39;s not getting into being poor while also having the gall not to be white. If poor people can choose not to do drugs and go into a cycle of self-destruction, so can rich people. You&#39;re not going to make me feel sorry for people who make bad choices when they have all the power and opportunity in the world to make good ones.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>However, I do not think I, nor anybody else, has a right to dictate what people can or cannot find funny. That is all I am really trying to say.<br><br>No, I am not fond of fat shaming, nor blatant racism. When I hear the harsher comedy, I usually cringe. I much prefer when society is challenged. However, sometimes, the occasional racially charged joke can be hilarious, for many reasons. Heck, South Park is probably the best thing I can point to. They make fun of <i>everybody,</i> while in the end promoting, on the whole, positive social change. If we just say, &quot;you cannot make racially charged humor, ever,&quot; that harms not only the freedom of speech, but also social progress. Can it be ugly? Yes. Can it hurt? Yes. But we have no right to tell people they cannot ever make that kind of humor, nor that they cannot enjoy it. Instead, we promote the entertainers that we do enjoy, to spread more good humor and laughs. We do not shame people for laughing.<br><br><br>As for point two, <i>that&#39;s the point!,</i> They have all the resources in the world! All the support they could ever want? Why then are they in the throws of such abuse? Am I saying we should start a movement or something? Feel more empathy then for those without the resources to heal? No. However, clearly they are facing serious problems, serious ones that, while they may not be as important as the poor old Mexican woman who can barely feed herself and her eight kids, is no less harmful for the individual. That is the point I am making. If you don&#39;t want to be sorry for them, fine. I don&#39;t either, really. Indeed, I hold a lot of resentment towards them myself, the money grubbing bastards. The only point I was trying to make is that everybody has problems, things that hurt them immensely. And if we feel OK about ignoring those when we make jokes towards them, can we really blame others for ignoring the problems other groups face?<br><br>The freedom of speech is important. That, in the end, is what I am really defending. &quot;I do not agree with what you have to say, but I&#39;ll defend to the death your right to say it.&quot; -Evelyn Beatrice Hall (commonly misattributed to Voltaire)</p>

            <p>The difference, it seems, is that I believe it certainly does extend to telling people that they should be ashamed when they hurt others, i.e. laughing at overweight people or being racist. Shame is how we learn what not to do to each other. It&#39;s very important to feel it when appropriate.<br><br>Mind you, you can laugh at whatever you want in the privacy of your own home, no one can stop you, but that doesn&#39;t make it right in public (or at all).<br><br><i>South Park</i>, as you mentioned, uses its comedy to draw attention to things that are wrong in the world. This is the humor that challenges the status quo I was talking about. For the most part, if they invoke a stereotype, it&#39;s to point out how stupid it is. That&#39;s different from just laughing about it. Humor is based in truth, so you can&#39;t laugh about something where you see no truth.<br><br>~Neshomeh, typing too much on a phone screen.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll also be honest, as much as I have been defending people&#39;s right to what they want to say and see, there have been times I have questioned people why they enjoyed certain forms of humor, not based on quality, but on how full of hatred they were. This is usually when it crosses the line from humor to hate speech. Where I draw that line seems to be far more forgiving than yours, but rest assured there is one. Most times, they reveal that it is because of the absurdity of it all. <br><br>Not all humor is based on truth. Some find insane caricatures of people hilarious. Take the worst possible aspects of stereotype, throw it at a wall and mock the heck out of it. Do I find it funny? No, but my cousins seem to, and one of them works in improving the living conditions of the poor. They say, if anything, what makes them laugh is how wrong it is, both morally and depiction wise. I don&#39;t get it, but I do not shame them for it. I have learned to be more forgiving towards what people find entertaining. If they are of a truly prejudiced mind, that will reveal itself in other ways, which I can call them out on with no shame.<br><br>Anyway, I think that is all I have to say on the subject.  This was an interesting debate, and has given me a lot to think about. I stand by everything I said, but I understand where you and others are coming from. Really, I do. I am pleased to see you care passionately about this subject, even if we disagree on some parts. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently rewatching them, and I had a thought.<br><br>The entire plot would not have occurred if Governor Swann hadn&#39;t gotten Elizabeth a corset.<br><br>Other than that, a long time ago, I had an idea for a fic. It&#39;s not my type of fic, though, so I thought I&#39;d post it on here for other people to write/play with/twist/whatever else. <br><br>So, when Port Royal is attacked by the Black Pearl under Barbossa, and the governor&#39;s mansion is invaded, the butler is killed. Not much attention is payed to this— Pintel says a single line, Elizabeth screams, the butler falls and is never mentioned again. That&#39;s all.<br><br>But what about when Elizabeth was growing up? It&#39;s entirely possible that the butler came with the Swanns from England, and that Elizabeth grew up with him as a fixture in the household. That adds a whole new dimension to his death. After all, he could have been anything from Elizabeth&#39;s tutor to an uncle figure to one of her closest friends. <br><br>My idea is rather shadowy- snapshots of Elizabeth&#39;s childhood, perhaps mixed with her thoughts and feelings as the butler dies. Anywho, anyone who wants can noodle with it, though I wouldn&#39;t mind credit for the idea, or being linked to the fic. :)</p>

At least he didn’t make me hit you with the bricks that are known as <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> or <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i>.<br><br>Des, you cannot help yourself to non-generic food while you watch the sorting ceremony. As has been shown in three books, the canonical food appears only after the sorting and Dumbledore’s short welcome speech.<br><br>Also, if I had betaed, I would have questioned your mocking of the &quot;Oh, I&#39;m half muggle-born and half pureblood&quot; line. People who care about these things (so not me) classify Harry as a half-blood although both his parents had the magical talent. Saying that he is half Muggle-born (one parent) and half Pureblood (the other parent) is actually a more accurate description, but Harry doesn’t care anyway.<br><br>What irks <b>me</b> there is that Alannah sounds like a Pureblood Supremacist who doesn’t dare to claim her supremacy, because she cannot deliver the certificate of magical ancestry, but still insists that she is better than those other half-bloods who actually have a Muggle parent. Considering that everything else is so condensed, and Harry in the canonical scene didn’t bother explaining his ancestry to anybody, I have to wonder why this detail is so important here. I don’t remember much from watching the <i>Thunderbirds</i> movie ages ago, so I have to ask: Would Jeff Tracy teach his adoptive daughter being a racist bastard, or where else may this come from?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Seriously, the 2004 is torrid and terrible and horrible and bad and augh. But, no, Jeff Tracy won&#39;t have taught his kids to be racist jerks - he taught them to be heroes that save people, remember?<br>Anyway, got the food.<br>And, lastly: it&#39;s not the fact that Harry&#39;s half-blood that I&#39;m mocking, it&#39;s the fact that Alannah&#39;s &#39;half-Pureblood&#39;. You can&#39;t be a half-pure-something, since being a pure-something means you don&#39;t have anything else inside you, so to speak; it&#39;s like saying a kettle is half-fully black when you&#39;re looking for &#39;half black and half grey&#39; or something similar.</p>

            <p>In this show, there isn&#39;t generally much in the way of violence. It&#39;s short on fights and long on heroics. You do the right thing because you have the power to do so, and you don&#39;t do it through the medium of punching someone until their turds have fillings. That&#39;s an INCREDIBLE moral to give to children. It&#39;s exciting and beautifully crafted and the characters are wonderful and I love it, I just love it.

            <p>Yes, it&#39;s very CGI-heavy, but almost everything is these days, and they still use modelmakers on set and blend physical stuff in with the computer effects.

            <p>I still love Virgil, though. He was always my favourite. I had a Tracy Island playset when I was very young and I still remember flying a diecast Thunderbird 2 through the mountain entrance with the palm trees leaning out of the way and it was SO AWESOME. Virgil showing up to save the day by dropping a giant green shed on the problem just felt awesome to me.<br><br>Also the fact that FAB 1 looks like it&#39;s supposed to now because this isn&#39;t entirely funded by bloody Ford; you may recall from That Film that her Ladyship didn&#39;t have a Rolls, so they gave her a tricked-out Ford Thunderbird instead. Geddit? Because, like the other machines in the film, it&#39;s a goddamned abomination? Yeah, that thing was a vibrator with badly-affixed wheels, where as this one... well, here&#39;s the concept art:<br><br><img src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/thunderbirds/images/6/63/Concept_Art.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150429152208"><br><br>I have this as my wallpaper.<br><br>Also, thinking about it, Epic Rap Battles of History should definitely do Lady Penelope vs. Penelope Pitstop.

            <p>The other time canon fought back, by the way, was a reference to the Cupcakes mission in My Little Pony, right?

            <p>I really hope Rina doesn&#39;t regenerate.  I feel like her last one was still fairly recent, and if it happens again, it might feel a little repetitive.  Plus, I feel like Rina&#39;s barely got a hold on her current identity.  Rina Two, if I can call her that, is just starting to solidify as a separate person from Rina One, and I think introducing Rina Three so quickly would be shortchanging her character arc.<br><br>Of course, that&#39;s just my personal opinion.  In the end, it&#39;s Iximaz&#39;s story to tell, and I&#39;m excited to see where she takes it.</p>

            <p>So I have been working on a character for a teenage mutant ninja turtles RP and I would like CC on what I have so far. The basic idea is that he was a human infant found by Splinter around the same as he and the turtles were exposed to the mutagen. My character was named after a Renaissance artist named Giovanni Bellini and uses the nickname &quot;Vinni.&quot; I haven&#39;t thought about a hair color yet but was thinking strawberry blond with blue or green eyes. I do know though that he uses shiurkens as his main weapon and doesn&#39;t really melee outside his ninja training. Relying on his brothers to help him. I also know that i want him to be trained to blend in with the crowd hiding in plain sight as ninjas actually did in feudal japan. As for weaknesses because he isn&#39;t mutated like his brothers he tends to be fragile and take longer to heal because of this he wears a special &quot;turtle suit&quot; designed by Donatello when he is out on patrol or a mission. And I was also thinking he would tend to be somewhat aloof around others unless he knows them mostly because he wants to act as plain and forgettable as possible. If anyone has ideas for any other flaws or skills let me know.</p>

            <p>...is much lower than that of the people around him. But you&#39;ve given him a &quot;turtle suit&quot; to make up for this.<br><br>It seems a bit odd that you would do this, because it sort of defeats the purpose of having a non-super in a group of supers. You&#39;ve given him tech-based powers, essentially making him just one more Turtle. The suit simply doesn&#39;t fit with the stealth theme, either. It&#39;s too flashy. If I were you, I&#39;d drop it. <br><br>Shurikens are another problem. Yes, they fit the Turtle theme, but they&#39;re entirely too obvious. If he&#39;s going to blend into a crowd, becoming a near-invisible stealth/scout type, he needs to have weapons that aren&#39;t so obviously unique to him. Knowing how to throw shurikens accurately makes sense, considering his adopted family; but his using them regularly in the field does not.<br><br>He&#39;s a human among mutant animals. Being human, his biggest asset is his intelligence. Don&#39;t make him utterly gifted, but give him the ability to strategize and plan. Make him Splinter&#39;s apprentice--Splinter is the strategist of he group, and he&#39;d have the most to teach this (I&#39;m assuming teenage) kid.<br><br>Lastly, you have a power set here, but you don&#39;t have much of a personality. Technically, you don&#39;t have a character yet. Ask yourself: What is it like growing up as a human among non-humans? Does he envy normal humans, or is he confused by them, or does he identify with them? How well can he blend in; does his odd upbringing give him trouble? What does he like to eat? What does he do with his free time? Does he have a favorite author, a favorite musician? <br><br>For that matter, how did he learn how to read? Did he go to school? Unlike the Turtles, his normal appearance would have allowed it. If not, how did he learn about the world around him? Does he have a role model? Has he ever fallen in love? What does he want to be when he grows up? Does he have talents for something other than martial arts? Hobbies?<br><br>Does he wonder who his birth parents are, or does he think of his adoptive family as his real family to the point that his birth parents aren&#39;t really something he cares about much? Does he have a false identity that will let him pass among humans? What would happen if he had to have a cavity filled or his appendix taken out? <br><br>This is an interesting idea for an OC, but it needs more work to keep it away from Studom. You don&#39;t want yet another Turtle, albeit in a human suit; the existing Turtles fill that role just fine. Instead, give him his own path, his own story to tell.</p>

            <p>Dexterity. Human hands.<br><br>Of course his adoptive family have opposable thumbs and the ability to use technology, but your character has more fingers and his brain is wired to use them very precisely. He&#39;s young, so he&#39;s not going to be an engineering genius, but make him a craftsman, a builder or a repairman maybe. Maybe he likes gadgets. On the other hand, maybe he&#39;s an artist--sculptor, painter, maybe; or if you want something portable, sketching.<br><br>Again, he&#39;s young, so he&#39;s not going to be an expert, but if he spends a lot of time practicing, he&#39;ll be competent by his teen years, perhaps competent enough to use his artistic ability to draw out the territory he&#39;s been scouting. If he can draw well, he doesn&#39;t need to covertly take pictures; he can bring the landscape back in his head and take that map straight to tactics and planning. </p>

            <p>The year is 2038 and Headquarters is a battlefield. Two major factions are fighting over what&#39;s left: the Sub Rosa&#39;s Loyalists (who support the old ways of the PPC) and the Departments of Author Correction and Efficiency (who favour a... <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndOn.htm">different</a> <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndHence.htm">way</a> of running the Canon Protection Initiative).<br><br>Both factions need <i>you</i>-- or more specifically your agents!

            <p>Happy to volunteer the Fisherman and Evie if it&#39;s not too late to join in the fun. This will be an alternate timeline for my two, as I have other... plans for them.<br><br><strong>The Fisherman</strong><br>Age: By 2038, probably somewhere north of 300.<br>Faction: Loyalist (in spirit, at least)<br>Fate: Left the PPC after the schism became irreparable and his partner, Evie, threw in with the Efficients. Would probably wander the multiverse doing entirely inadvisable things unless he happened across something relating to the war - if so, he&#39;d support the Loyalists if he could be of use. Evie &#39;going to the dark side&#39; would play on his mind, and he&#39;d probably regret not staying and trying to convince her to change her mind.<br><br><br><strong>Evie</strong><br>Age: Around 50, visually still mid-twenties. (Cyborgs are a poor target market for anti-ageing products! :P)<br>Faction: Efficients, <em>initially...</em><br>Fate: Given her cybernetic heritage and general desire for efficiency, Evie was only too happy to support the DoE. Even her <s>long-suffering</s> long-time partner couldn&#39;t convince her that what they were planning was a Bad Idea. However, once things developed and she became more aware of how they worked, she regretted this decision. &#39;Efficiency just isn&#39;t any <em>fun</em>,&#39; I can imagine her thinking. I somehow imagine her hacking the DoE&#39;s systems and causing a little chaos before defecting, but that&#39;s just my personal head-canon (that said, use it if you want!). She&#39;d be rather disappointed that Fish was still &#39;wandering&#39;...<br><br><br>So yes, both of them in a situation they&#39;d rather not be due to the wonders of poor communication. Feel free to adapt and tweak as you see fit - as I said this&#39;ll be an AU. :)</p>

            <p>Cadmar<br>Age: 47<br>Faction: Loyalist<br>Notes: She is firmly against having the somewhat escapist life become some uniform job, she also would be quite aware of her fragility compared to her vampire and immortal partners. While she’d have no problem with the brutality of the conflict, she’d really just prefer some nice life.<br><br>Maria Nightingale:<br>Age: 52 <br>Faction: Loyalist<br>Notes: Would fight tooth and nail, literally, for keeping the usual structure of things. She prefers the freedom to fool around, even if they get in trouble. While initially vehement to the cause, prolonged fighting over the years, with no end in sight, would wear her out. <br><br><br>Mark Sienna<br>Age: 157<br>Faction: Loyalist. <br>Notes: While he prefers Efficiency’s methods on missions, he would much rather just up sticks and leave altogether, though he’d stick with Maria and Cadmar. While he isn’t in much danger of dying, he’s paranoid enough about capture or things worse that he would always be trying to convince the other two to simply disappear into the Word Worlds somewhere.<br><br>For their fates, I’ll leave it ultimately up to you. I&#39;ve left info on how far they are willing to go for the cause, and how they all rather prefer how lax it was before. I figured this would be interesting enough, focusing on some agents who are half-hearted on the issue. <br><br>Doom/Gloom<br>Age: 33<br>Faction: N/A<br>Notes: With nowhere she would feel more at home, she would stay in the PPC despite the war. Due to the fact she is a non-corporeal ghost, she can’t fight, or be killed off (minus magic, or exorcism, I suppose). She would most likely remain neutral in the matter, neither minding a more efficient way of doing thing, nor disliking the current way things are. She would simply wander (or haunt~) the halls, and try to lead help to any injured she finds. Preferably to their own faction, of course. Any little thing she can do to help people counts, after all. <br></p>

            <p>Carry Onin<br>Age: around 50 (origin Rohan)<br>Faction: N/A<br>Notes: Carry is a follower by nature. He is also very, very loyal to his partners. By 2038, they will have been together for a long time, so Gloom&#39;s neutrality will affect him greatly, probably more than his loyalty to the actual PPC. He is extremely fond and protective of children, so I imagine he might do something like take it upon himself to set up protection detail of the Nursery to ensure the safety and neutrality of the children&#39;s areas or something along those lines.  There is an outside chance that someone like Miah might be able to talk him into joining the side of the loyalists by appealing to his loyalty to his other friends and desire to protect them. One of them getting hurt might be enough to pull him into the fighting.<br><br>Miah<br>Age: 60<br>Faction: Loyalist<br>Notes: Agent Miah has a history of trying to take things too far, railing against the rules preventing her from going after the author, so it might be surprising that she would be vehemently Loyalist, but especially as she has gotten older, she has acknowledged that she enjoys having the framework of the rules that keep her from going too far, keep her more violent tendencies from truly causing harm. She sees a longer game and would argue that the old ways protect the integrity of the agents and that that is of vital importance. Enough importance to fight for it. In practical terms of fighting, though, she is a 60 year old human that has lived in the PPC for almost 30 years, so...sneakiness, creativity, probably not a lot of hand to hand. She has always been fond of feeding the troops, though.<br><br>Cali<br>Age: 44<br>Faction: Loyalist<br>Notes: Cali is loyal to Cadmar, Miah, and then the PPC. He still has the mindset of being a superhero, but has mellowed as he has gotten older. He too, is basically human, and has no healing factors or such to keep him from dying, and if he&#39;s still alive after nearly 30 years in the PPC, then he is very aware of that. His adopted kids would be in age from 28 to 37, so it is entirely possible he has grandkids. I don&#39;t know how that would affect his actions or how those kids turned out or which side they might be on. It&#39;s possible some of them would be against. If Cadmar disappeared into the word worlds, Cali would go with her, probably trying to take Miah with him (she wouldn&#39;t go).<br><br>Kelok<br>Age: either 10,038 or 38 (Stargate Atlantis Wraith)<br>Faction: up to you<br>Notes: Kelok could have gone in two directions from his last appearance. He could have gotten more stable and would be an asset to the Loyalists. He could have continued to destabilize and is either dead, forced out by FicPsych or could have been twisted into a fighter for the DACA. <br><br>Unger<br>Age: around 50 (half-elf, so still fairly young)<br>Faction: <br>Notes: Unger would be greatly affected by Kelok&#39;s fate. If Kelok was taken out by death or FicPsych, fairly early on, Unger would have left the PPC. If Kelok is still loyal, then so is Unger. If Kelok is DACA, then so is Unger. I doubt he would have calmed down much, but he is able to read, and probably better at setting fires in appropriate places.<br><br>For their fates, it is up to you. I&#39;ll take this as an AU for them, so kill them, keep them, use them, don&#39;t use them, it&#39;s all good with me as long as they are within the framework of their personalities. </p>

            <p>Some of their fates have been left vague. Feel free to play with those if you like.<br><br><b>Danny Richardson</b><br>Age: 53<br>Faction: None. <br>Fate: His wounds combined with mental stress drove him to retire the PPC many years before. After hearing about the conflict, he goes into hiding.<br><br><b>Laura Dukes</b><br>Age: 50<br>Faction: Loyalist, but barely. While she has no love for Sues, she likes authoritarian murderers even less. Her methods are brutal enough to give her peers pause, however, and could eventually mean trouble. It should be noted that by this point that she has become more obviously cybernetic: robotic legs, two electronic eyes, glowing spots/lines under her artificial skin, and so on.<br>Fate: Still fighting. Will likely keep fighting until the very end.<br><br><b>James Pittman</b><br>Age: 63<br>Faction: Efficiency. He was always a strong believer in law and order. Seeing his home canon (<i>XCOM</i>) lost to mind-controlling monsters only hardened his outlook. Despite his age, he continues to take to the field with his sniper rifle.<br>Fate: Uncertain. He&#39;d likely keep fighting unless killed or defeat was certain. At that point, he&#39;d vanish into the Word Worlds and go MIA.<br><br><b>Xericka</b><br>Age: Appears to be in her late twenties, apart from a streak of grey in her hair.<br>Faction: Loyalist. She considered joining Efficiency, but her loyalty to Gremlin and her children well outstrips any she has towards faction politics. She and Gremlin would also be married at this point, although it might be different in this universe. She does not work on the front lines.<br>Fate: She would likely survive. Should anything happen to Gremlin or her kids, then she will attempt to make the survivors leave before abandoning the effort altogether and vanishing into the shadows.<br><br><b>Gremlin</b><br>Age: 45<br>Faction: Loyalist. She&#39;s not a fan of wanton murder or strict control. Gremlin is definitely more action-oriented in this future. She uses her power like in the old, gang-member days: breaking, entering, and hacking. <br>Fate: She might survive, but her role could potentially put her in the line of danger more than once. Call it 60-40 in favor of her living.<br><br><b>Aiden Nil</b><br>Age: 27<br>Faction: Loyalist, but barely. The conflict is wearing the young firebender ragged. He only stays out of loyalty to his sister, Emma.<br>Fate: He would likely survive, but it wouldn’t take all that much for Aiden to desert the PPC altogether.<br><br><b>Emma Nil</b><br>Age: 21<br>Faction: Loyalist. Emma has a bit of a hero complex. She sees the Efficiency’s actions as monstrous and is looking to take them down.<br>Fate: Could go either way. She could survive, but her recklessness and stubbornness could just as easily get her killed.<br>Notes: Emma has not had any appearances yet. She is a rescuee from a <i>Kim Possible</i> pregnancy badfic. She has auburn hair and can generate green energy blasts from her hands.<br><br><b>Rachel Calendar</b><br>Age: 43<br>Faction: None.<br>Fate: Rachel and much of the DIAU went MIA as tensions began to rise. No one knows where they went or what they are doing.</p>

            <p>ESAS would be on the Loyalist side.

            <p>The way I see it, everyone writes their own timeline of the PPC and simply decide to integrate certain parts of others&#39; work (as in acknowledging the existence of some agents and HQ events that appear in other spinoffs) into their own.

            <p>I&#39;m a bit of a sucker for cameos. ^<em>^; So:<br><br><b>Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill</b><br>Faction: Loyalist.

They won him over with cunning arguments and he never got the chance to go back.<br>Age: 60, or would be if he hadn&#39;t been...<br>Fate: Killed in action. Nume&#39;s not a fighter. He&#39;d never make it in a pitched battle. He might&#39;ve tried to defect once things started getting nasty, too, and then the DoE might&#39;ve had something <i>harsh</i> to say about it. Up to you, really.<br><br><b>Derik</b><br>Faction: Loyalist. The Efficients&#39; clear-cut rules and order would appeal to him, but he&#39;s change his tune pretty quickly once the torture and killing started. Sues get killed because they&#39;re parasites, not people.<br>Age: ~70, give or take. Gettin&#39; on, but dragonriders tend to be healthy and long-lived. He&#39;s not slowing down yet, even if he is going gray.<br>Fate: Surviving, assuming he hasn&#39;t done something suicidally heroic (or just dumb) and gotten himself killed yet.<br><br><b>Gall Knutson</b><br>Faction: Loyalist, but for the opposite reasons as her partner. She wouldn&#39;t care about the torturing and killing, but anybody messing with her personal autonomy is asking for trouble. <br>Age: 46 and starting to feel it, but nonetheless a force to be reckoned with.<br>Fate: Surviving, probably. She might even have kids, in which case god help anyone who tries to mess with them. Derik may or may not be the father. Sorta depends on whether or not she ever convinces him to see her that way and whether or not it lasts. Since it&#39;s AU, totally up to you. ^</em>^<br><br><b>Jennifer Robinson</b><br>Faction: Nope. Nuh-uh. Forget it.<br>Age: 55, physically. Otherwise, same as ever.<br>Fate: Surviving on the sidelines, trying to keep Henry and friends on both sides out of trouble. I have a feeling the Efficients wouldn&#39;t want someone like her around, so she would&#39;ve had to go underground pretty early on in their takeover. She wouldn&#39;t leave altogether while she still has people to care for, though.<br><br><b>Henry Robinson</b><br>Faction: Efficient, possibly a double-agent for the Loyalists, if only because I&#39;m tantalized by the notion of him falling into a Snape-esque role due to inherited narrativium. Unfortunately, the Harry Potter in him means he&#39;s far less subtle than Snape.<br>Age: 29.<br>Fate: Surviving. Jenni will do almost anything to make sure he lives to see 30. Unfortunately, his temper makes this rather difficult. He could get into serious trouble, even killed.<br><br>... And that&#39;s enough. ^_^; Don&#39;t feel compelled to use all of them, or any of them, of course. Feel free to pull in any of my FicPsych nurses if you feel like it, though. They&#39;d most likely all be Loyalists, since I can&#39;t really see FicPsych being much use to the Efficients. They might make for good cannon fodder.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well, Marvin and Printworthy are likely retired at that point. If they were still active, they would be loyalist. Printworthy would contemplate joining the other side, but in the end will stick with Marvin and not harassing Authors. If they served, Printworthy would be injured, and the two of them desert to Equestria.<br><br>Now, as for the other two agents who I have never introduced, but talked about a lot...<br><br>Oh, what the heck. Once this next week is up, I will push to get a short out with Jumper and Sarah to introduce them. However, for now, I&#39;ll do some bare bones explanation.<br><br>Jumper is a man who can travel between worlds. Not however, word worlds. I&#39;ll get into that later, but if you are really curious, I have talked about him before on the board. Just search Jumper. You should find some tidbits. Anyway, he is very much loyalist. He finds the idea of rushing missions horrifying, and the harassment of Authors more so. He uses his ability to travel to non Word Worlds to keep the Loyalists supplied, without the threat of interception by the enemy. Unfortunately, because his ability takes a lot out of him, these supplies do not come as often as needed.<br><br>Sarah, United States Marine (from the Half-Life universe) and Jumper&#39;s partner, is very much a member of the Department of Efficiency. Even before the reforms, she took Sue hunting professionally. Be quick, be efficient, be ruthless. The sooner the mission is over, the more monsters she can take out. While Jumper had managed the impossible, and got her to loosen up, when she heard of a movement to do things the way she wanted all along, she joined without hesitation. She has no mercy for Loyalists, who want to stay with the ways that let monsters live for longer then they deserved. Well, with the possible exception of one Loyalist...<br><br>Ultimate fates? Sarah will fight for a long time, but eventually be found MIA. Jumper will head out to make another supply delivery, and never come back.<br><br>Why yes, I have been wanting to write their roles in this conflict for a while, why do you ask?</p>

            <p>...the only agent of mine who would definitely still be around by 2038 would be Cupid, for obvious reasons. Rashida would probably retire and return to her home continuum after a few years, and I&#39;m not sure what&#39;ll become of all the others but I doubt they&#39;d be around for that long. As for my other agents... I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;d rather not risk it. So yeah, just Cupid. For now, anyway.<br><br>As for where he&#39;d end up, I can see him being part of the Loyalist faction, since they were the ones who gave him a home and a reason to exist in the first place. Being an angel and the like, he&#39;d still be 13 biologically but he&#39;d be a lot more experienced mentally. There WAS a 25-year gap between the original Kid Icarus game and Uprising, after all.

            <p>I think Whitney and Backslash would probably stick around as well. Both Loyalists, both still on duty, both still tearing down Sues like it&#39;s business as usual.<br><br>Whitney, of course, would be akin to a military commander in a yoga outfit, and she&#39;d probably invest in firearms once she gets her budget balanced out in a decade since her introduction. I could almost see her cocking a machine gun dramatically to announce her presence lol.<br><br>Backslash would be an engineer, though of course he&#39;d still dabble in missions so he&#39;d probably be still in the DMS and not the DoSAT. And he&#39;d obviously be an Aegislash, too.</p>

            <p>Algernon Wymbourne: a rear-echelon support guy in the Loyalists on account of his magic favouring a less combat-oriented role.

Surviving... thus far.<br><br>Agamemnon, 8th Earl Wymbourne: a keen follower in his father&#39;s footsteps, Agamemnon is much more adept at combat magic than the 7th Earl ever was. He&#39;s survived thus far. He&#39;s also much less eager to use it, unless you hurt his partner...<br><br>Kay Shiokara: Agamemnon&#39;s partner is an Inkling and a natural-born gunner, favouring her old Splattershot and similar short-ranged weapons. She has a tendency to charge in all guns blazing, which can be a bit of a problem.

            <p>Okay, I admittedly have a personal ulterior motive for this, but I don&#39;t personally recall many of these having happened in the past, so let&#39;s see what everyone can bring to the <s>Board</s> table as far as book recs go!<br><br>(For those of you wondering &#39;but what about goodfic recs?&#39; don&#39;t you worry; incidentally, there&#39;s also a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Rec_Center">Rec Center</a> on the wiki for creating and maintaining your own goodfic rec list for others to check out!)<br><br>Basically, don&#39;t feel worried about making off the wall suggestions or such, as long as you think it&#39;s a genuinely <i>enjoyable</i> book, or even series. If someone posts something you were going to suggest as well, chime in with why it&#39;s enjoyable! Or more about it!<br><br>I&#39;ll start off with a suggestion:<br><br>My suggestion (which I&#39;ve been telling everyone who&#39;s willing to listen) is <i>Tooth and Claw</i> by Jo Walton.<br><br>It&#39;s about dragons.<br><br>Not only is it about dragons, it&#39;s about dragons in Regency-Victorian era equivalent culture.<br><br>Basically, it is Pride &amp; Prejudice, but with dragons. In the place of people. Everyone is a dragon. Sheep are muttons. The story is great, Jo Walton hits all the right beats and copies the feel and tempo without making it feel like a poorly done mimicry of Austen. If you like dragons or Austen, or even both? You really ought read it.</p>

            <p>But I refuse to not participate, even though we&#39;re on the second page now!<br><br><b>Fiction</b><br><br><i>Wuthering Heights</i> by Emily Brontë: This is fun because in spite of being grouped with all those stodgy old English stories, WH is filled with surprisingly cruel and rude attitudes, which makes it feel a lot more modern.<br><br><i>Stories of Hawai&#39;i</i> by Jack London: A group of short stories based on London&#39;s time spent in Hawai&#39;i.  Interesting for its time period in that native Polynesians and Asian immigrants are by and large the protagonists, while white folks are ignorant tourists at best and malevolent abusers at worst.  An interesting historical look at early twentieth century Hawai&#39;i, but also entertaining stories.<br><br><i>Boy&#39;s Life</i> by Robert R. McCammon:  It&#39;s been years since I read this novel, but the story is still fresh in my memory, it&#39;s so exciting and complex.  It&#39;s a little hard to explain without giving away the plot, but it&#39;s essentially different events a boy experiences in his home town after witnessing someone drown.  The drowning mystery is the backbone, but the novel has many other stories going on, too.  Some of it is fantastical, some of it is mundane, but they all feel real enough to have happened.  Just generally well-written.<br><br><i>Deprivers</i> by Steven-Elliot Altman: Sort of an <i>X-Men</i>ish world, but where all the powers involve influencing the senses of those the deprivers interact with.  The world-building is good enough to ignore the &quot;another superhero world&quot;iness of it.  Been trying to design a depriver as a PPC agent, but no luck yet.<br><br><i>God&#39;s Country</i> by Percival Everett: A Western about a black man&#39;s and a young girl&#39;s journeys, but told through the narration of an awful man who doesn&#39;t deserve their company.  I honestly don&#39;t remember the plot too well, but the writing is powerful.<br><br><i>Catch-22</i> by Joseph Heller: Yeah, one of the generic &quot;classics,&quot; but it really is that good.  It&#39;s written in a hilarious way, but still shows the futility of war and the hypocrisy of the politics behind them.<br><br><i>The Mouse That Roared</i> by Leonard Wibberley: Pretty much the same as above, but much less manic in its humor.<br><br><i>Skin</i> by Ted Dekker: A &quot;stranded in remote location&quot; murder mystery, but it&#39;s a lot more complex than that.  There&#39;s a twist that is delightful in it&#39;s sheer, glorious, out-of-nowhere, never-guess-that-in-a-million-years-ness.  I forget the meaning behind the title, but I&#39;m pretty sure there weren&#39;t any sex scenes.<br><br><i>Blasphemy</i> by Douglas Preston: Scientists working on a supercollider fall under siege by a religious group.  The overall plot isn&#39;t quite that cut-and-dry; there&#39;s also a murderer among the staff, and they&#39;re worried they really have accidentally discovered something of spiritual significance, but are afraid to admit it to the outside world.  Probably the weakest suggestion on this list, but I feel the very last page makes reading the rest worth it.<br><br><i>From a Buick 8</i> by Stephen King: One of the King&#39;s lesser known novels, I think it&#39;s his best I&#39;ve read so far.  I won&#39;t even describe the plot or antagonist, because the story is really about how the protagonists react psychologically to what&#39;s happening.  It also contains some of King&#39;s best descriptive passages of bizarre things.  &quot;Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.&quot;<br><br><b>Non-Fiction</b><br><br><i>The Professor and the Madman</i> by Simon Winchester: The history of the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary, but better than it sounds.  Aside from giving  fun trivia about different words, it describes the lives of the teacher who headed the project and the single greatest contributor of definitions, who resided as a permanent resident of a mental institution.<br><br><i>Revolutionary Characters</i> by Gordon S. Wood: An interesting series of short essays about the U.S. &quot;founding fathers,&quot; describing them as people, and explaining their political views in an easy-to-understand way.</p>

            <p>If not, I&#39;d like to throw in my lot and suggest the works of Erin Hunter, but most of all her <i>Warriors</i> series. (There&#39;s a Wiki page for that, and a mission, but I haven&#39;t looked into that too much). I&#39;ve gotten only halfway through &quot;The Prophecies Begin&quot; story arc (the first one), but I really enjoyed it, &quot;Said Bookism&quot; notwithstanding (though to be fair, they characters are cats, and I don&#39;t recall cats saying much).<br><br>Basically, it&#39;s cats. A lot of cats. Cats in four clans that conflict with each other. Cats that experience treachery and the occasional civil war from within their own clan. Cats that deal with a racism of sorts (i.e. &quot;kittypets&quot; running wild and feral) and its social implications. CATS THAT EXPERIENCE LEGITIMATELY HUMAN EXPERIENCES AND EMOTIONS. CATS. <b>CATS.</b><br><br>I am seriously considering <strike>becoming a cat person</strike> doing a <i>Warriors</i> mission in light of my newfound interest in this series...</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been reading ever since I was a little kid.<br><br>Some things I recommend are The Sands of Time, for Redwall fans (it&#39;s more modern than Redwall, but it&#39;s got the same mouse-world premise), A Song of Ice and Fire (because my god it&#39;s amazing), Neil Gaiman&#39;s Neverwhere, and one or a thousand more I&#39;m forgetting.<br><br>If you want to stretch the definition of &quot;book&quot; a bit, I&#39;ve also got nonfiction and manga recs. For nonfiction, Ben Thompson&#39;s Badass books and the Cracked De-Textbook are both hilarious and informative. For manga, I always recommend Monster Musume (yes it&#39;s a harem series, but there&#39;s a lot more to it than that), but some more I suggest are The Enigma of Amigara Fault (for your horror fix), Nurse Hitomi&#39;s Monster Infirmary (for if you want monster girls without the ecchi fanservice), the works of Kiyohiko Azuma (for your feel-good needs) and Shaman King (this one&#39;s nostalgic; it got me into manga).<br><br>Sorry if I got a bit wordy here.</p>

            <p>How about a little thought experiment. What kind of book would you get if you managed, through some peculiar contrivance, to have Dickens, Austen, and Defoe seated around a writing desk and had them knock together an urban fantasy novel based on their own contemporary lives?<br><br><i>Jonathan Strange and Mister Norrell</i> is that book exactly. It combines the wonderful Austenian comedies of manners with an almost Pratchettian gift for the superbly weird throwaway joke. For example, in a short passage concerning the ability of magicians to talk to trees, mention is made of Wulfric the Tartar, who enjoyed playing chess against mushrooms and lived a long and happy married life with a signpost, and whose son managed to acquire the good favour and hand of his beloved by removing her husband&#39;s entrails with a sponge, a process that is not detailed at all but reputedly took the gentleman seventeen years. And that&#39;s the thing about this book. Magic is actually bloody <i>magical</i>.<br><br>There&#39;s a fairly common trope in fantasy called <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">The Magic Goes Away</a> (Link to a TV Tropes page; you have been warned) in which, well, the magic goes away. At the end of the story, the magic drains off somewhere else, and the wonder leaves the world. JS&amp;MN poses the question: what happens when the magic comes back?<br><br>The answer is that England once more has magic, and magic is strange and sometimes terrifying and sometimes uncontrollable and always, always a thing of unparalleled wonder.<br><br>I love how... magical the book feels. I can&#39;t not love it. And given your own recommendation, I think you will too. =]</p>

<li> <i>House:  The Only Way Out is In </i>.  Good suspense, good pacing, intriguing.  I don&#39;t really have anything bad to say about this novel. It was written by Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker.<br><br>2.  <i>Les Miserables</i>  I understand it is a classic and everyone is familiar with it, but it still is one of my favorite novels of all time.<br><br>3.  <i>Dracula</i>  Same as above<br><br>4.  <i>The Last Patriot</i> By Brad Thor, an interesting Military-Political Thriller<br><br>And to close it out...<br><br>5. <i>Ah! My Goddess</i> by Kōsuke Fujishima.  This manga series ran 26 years, and has a little bit of everything in it.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable read.  <br><br>6.  <i>Hellsing</i>  by Kouta Hirano.  This was another entertaining read.  It does get a bit graphic at times and is very much a Pay Evil unto Evil type of story.  It makes Vampires genuinely terrifying again, and they don&#39;t Sparkle.<br></li>

            <p>Well, recently I picked up <i>Pennyroyal Academy</i>, by M.A. Larson. I have not gotten too far into it (redoing my roof has taken up almost all my time) but so far, I am enjoying it. Penyroyal Acadamy is a school for young men and women to become knights and princesses. These princesses are not however, to dress in poofy dresses and balance books on their head. hey are battle-princesses, ready to help the knights slay dragons and witches. Or just slay them themselves. Whatever.<br><br>Second, a book I have read many times, is Feed by M.T. Anderson. Have you ever wanted to have a computer chip in your head, where you could access the internet in you mind? This book shows you what would happen if that was done, with all of it&#39;s hilarious, and horrid, side effects. Now, it is loaded with swearing, and immature brats being immature brats. But that is the point. I can see why many would not like it, but I loved it. If you do pick it up, I would actually recommend the audiobook before reading it. I don&#39;t want to spoil it, but some of the effects the book was going for works much better in audio. You&#39;ll see.</p>

            <p>I wrote a long review advocating his work, but then my Internet derped and all of it was deleted, so...<br><br>He&#39;s known for great magic systems and world building. I would recommend the <i>Mistborn</i> trilogy first; it&#39;ll give you a good idea of what he&#39;s like. It follows the adventures of Vin, a street girl, learning how to use her Allomancy and attempting to overthrow the immortal Lord Ruler. It has a great plot and, of course, a beautiful magic system. He also has a knack for taking old things and making them work in new and fresh ways, which makes his works feel like they&#39;ve never been done before.<br><br>My personal favorite is the <i>Stormlight Archive,</i> which has two books so far, each a thousand pages. Again, great magic system and world building, with a large cast of memorable characters and a beautiful, huge world to explore. <br><br>Anyway, heartily recommend him, go check him out!</p>

            <p>The first, the best, the only! An octalogy (eight books saga), the pride of my country, and a series which inspired three video games, with the last one released a month ago.<br><br>I&#39;ve mentioned it somewhere before, but I&#39;ll do it again because this series deserves it.<br><br><i>The Witcher</i> is a fantasy series of short stories and novels about Geralt of Rivia, the titular &#39;witcher&#39;. In Sapkowski&#39;s books, &quot;Witchers&quot; are monster hunters who (through special training, mutation, and body modification) develop supernatural abilities at a young age in order to battle deadly monsters roaming the Continent.<br><br>In my opinion, the author brought back the spirit of Slavic tradition in these books. Many monsters (such as a drowner, a water hag, or a leshen) were inspired by actual beliefs of Slavic tribes, and the locations are taken from old Polish legends, and even some wildly known fairy tales (i.e. princess-turned-bandit lived with her group of seven gnomes... Snow White anyone?).</p>

            <p>The games are more like an un-official sequel. Although the author of the saga did not disowned the games (like he did with a terrible, terrible movie from 2001), I don&#39;t think he claims the games to be canon - which is a shame, if you ask me.<br>A legend, hmm? I guess, I&#39;ll tell you the most famous one - <b>The Dragon of Wawel</b> (pronounced Vavel). It comes from the XII century:<br><br>During the reigns of great king Krakus, a dragon made its lair was in a cave at the foot of Wawel Hill on the bank of the Vistula River. Each day the dragon would beat a path of destruction across the countryside, killing the civilians, pillaging their homes and devouring their livestock. The King certainly wanted to put a stop to the dragon, but his bravest knights fell to its fiery breath. In desperation, the King promised his beautiful daughter&#39;s hand in marriage to anyone who could defeat the dragon. Great warriors from near and far fought for the prize and failed. One day a poor cobbler&#39;s apprentice named Skuba accepted the challenge. He stuffed a lamb with sulphur, nightshade, wolfsbane, and fool&#39;s parsley, and set it outside the dragon&#39;s cave. The dragon ate it and soon became incredibly thirsty. He turned to the Vistula River for relief and drank and drank. But no amount of water could quench his aching stomach, and after swelling up from drinking half the Vistula river, he exploded. Skuba married the King&#39;s daughter as promised, and they lived happily ever after.</p>

            <p>Never knew it was Polish. Well, the more you know.<br><br>As promised, one Alaska Native tale. Athabaskan, to be precise.<br><br>This is how Raven stole the Sun and Moon.<br><br>A long time ago, when the world was younger, there was Raven. Raven was smart, a clever mischief maker, who has watched over the world since he remade it from the great flood. <br><br>In the early days of the new world, there was no Sun, nor Moon, as they had been washed away by the great waves. The people were thankful, but could not survive without the light. They could not hunt, nor fish. When they went out to find wood to burn in their fires, they had to crawl around in the forest feeling with their hands until they found something which might be wood. Then they would bite it to make certain that it was indeed firewood.<br><br>Raven saw how the people lived, and promised them he would bring back the Sun and Moon. For you see, as he was so clever, he knew where they had gone. They were swept into the sea, and now held by a great sea chief. This chieftain found the light they gave to be beautiful, and so hung them in his great house. He also had a single daughter, young and beautiful, his pride and joy. Raven knew he would do anything for her. So, he devised a plan, should simply asking fail.<br><br>He went to the great sea chief, and asked for the Sun and Moon. The chieftain refused. &quot;They fell into my sea! They belong to me!&quot; Again Raven asked, pleading for the people of the land, yet still, the chieftain refused. Raven left, knowing he had no choice but to follow his other plan.<br><br>Raven watched how the sea chieftain&#39;s daughter would leave the sea for a small stream to collect fresh water every morning. Raven watched, until he knew where she would always travel, and when. At last, when ready, Raven turned himself into a small fish, and fell into the water. So small was he, the girl did not see him, and so consumed him when she drank the water. When inside, he turned himself into a baby, and made the girl pregnant.<br><br>Soon after, the sea chieftain&#39;s daughter gave birth to a beautiful child, who was truly Raven. The child aged rapidly, far faster then any human child. The chieftain was proud of his grandson, and would do anything he asked.<br><br>One day, the boy asked the chieftain, &quot;May I play with those?&quot; pointing towards the Sun and Moon.<br><br>The chieftain, who would do anything to please his grandson, smiled and said, &quot;Of course! Just be careful, for they are fragile, and can easily break.&quot; The chieftain then handed the child the Sun and Moon.<br><br>As soon as he had the Sun and Moon in his hands, the boy turned back into Raven, who laughed as he flew to the sky. The chieftain screamed, as he watched his prized possessions fly away, and cursed Raven for his trickery.<br><br>Raven was pleased with how he tricked the sea chief. However, in his haste to fly away, the Sun was held lightly in Raven&#39;s beak, and eventually fell to the ground. Raven cried in dismay, as the Sun shattered into many pieces. He was relieved to see most of the Sun remained intact, and put the largest and brightest piece into the sky. The smaller pieces, Raven swept into his wings and scattered across the sky, making the stars. The people cheered, as light was brought back into the world. They promised forever, that they would never kill ravens, because of what Raven did for them.<br><br>However, Raven felt sorry for his trick he pulled on the sea chief and his daughter. In apology, Raven made it so the Sun and Moon would return to the sea once a day, though not at the same time, so there would always be light for the people on the land. <br><br>And so, that was how Raven stole the Sun and Moon.<br><br><img src="http://img12.deviantart.net/e810/i/2006/276/0/b/raven_stealing_the_sun_tattoo_by_pikeface.jpg" alt="http://img12.deviantart.net/e810/i/2006/276/0/b/raven_stealing_the_sun_tattoo_by_pikeface.jpg"> <br><br>((If you have heard this story before, you may remember it differently. This was the version I was told as a child, by a native storyteller in school. I may have misremembered details, but the core story is there.))</p>

            <p>She&#39;s possibly my favorite author, and definitely the one that&#39;s had the most influence on my personal writing style.  If you like J. K. Rowling, Neil Gaiman, or Terry Pratchett, you&#39;ll probably enjoy her books.  Her best-known series are the Chrestomanci books and <i>Howl&#39;s Moving Castle</i>, but I would really recommend that you look at some of her less-famous books.  My personal favorites are <i>Dark Lord of Derkholm</i>, a deconstruction of the typical fantasy setting; its sequel, <i>Year of the Griffin</i>, which should speak to a lot of college students; and my personal favorite, <i>Deep Secret</i>, which is set at a sci-fi convention.<br><br>As for other writers, if you like the Victorian era, mysteries, or Egyptology, Elizabeth Peter&#39;s Amelia Peabody books are also brilliant; they&#39;re funny, tense, and expertly researched, with a memorable heroine.  <br><br>Personally, I like the <i>Dresden Files</i> books by Jim Butcher; Harry can be a little irritating sometimes, but I like the noir flair the books have, and the world-building is really interesting.  <br><br>And if you like horror stories, I enjoyed <i>Another</i>, by Yukito Ayatsuji.  Given that it was originally written in Japanese, the writing style might not appeal to everyone, but the story itself is great.</p>

            <p>Overall, the licensed Pathfinder novels are very high-quality and well-written.  My favorites are the ones by Dave Gross, <i>Prince of Wolves</i> and its sequels.  The main characters, Radovan and Varian, have a great friendship, with almost a Holmes and Watson vibe.  (Though sadly, the internet has yet to turn up any slash fic about them.)  The <i>Death&#39;s Heretic</i> series is also pretty cool, and does a good job of going into the different Planes, a part of the setting that I think frequently goes unexplored.</p>

            <p>One: I am not Wobbles The Clown, the Notary (for which we can all be grateful, I&#39;d wager), Field Commander McCandless, the 7th Earl of Wymbourne, his heir, his wife, or a small pink pufferfish playing a sousaphone in a way almost but <i>not quite</i> completely unconnected with conventional musical theory - or, for that matter, conventional depictions of reality. Similarly, you are not your hypothetical agent. If you were, then the message would not apply - or, if you subscribe to determinist views of philosophy, it might apply all the more.<br><br>Two: I think the PPC needs a little more music in its life. The power you talk about, used sparingly, would be extremely helpful for finding the victims of canon replacement. The keyword is <i>sparingly</i>. Playing the theme of a boss battle might be useful for having a great big horrible monster jump up and down upon ones adversary until it resembles nothing so much as glitter glue might be good for a laugh, but it&#39;s bad practice overall; the more knowledge canons have of the PPC, the more likely a Sue is to rip it out of their heads and plot an invasion. And those things are a <i>pain</i>. =]</p>

            <p>So long as you don&#39;t force it to happen to the entire PPC, nor change the status quo, you can write whatever you like, really. You can write AUs if you want to write a what-if story, or you could set your story in the past, during one of the established emergencies.<br><br>We do like our sporkings of bad fanfic, and that&#39;s what we write most of all, but there are interludes fleshing out HQ and its inhabitants, and Ten Years Hence set in the future.<br><br>A sneaky raid on a Mary Sue factory, that doesn&#39;t change what&#39;s happening at HQ too much nor force anyone into the story that doesn&#39;t want to be in it, could be a fun thing to write.<br><br>Danger is fine; even killing off your agents is fine, if you wanted to do it. Just don&#39;t take over anybody else&#39;s and don&#39;t do anything that dictates how other people get to tell their own stories. I think it was Makes-Things&#39;s death that annoyed people the most, because M-T is a community character who&#39;s been around since the original series. (He&#39;s not actually dead, by the way. He survived--somehow. Mostly because we are Authors and we wanted him to survive, but I think there are plans to write about exactly how.)<br><br>And keep it light. After all, this is supposed to be satirical metafiction, even if it gets serious sometimes. We&#39;re writing about characters who police fanfiction and occasionally lose it because Legolas has been turned into a wilting violet by a fanbrat who thinks he&#39;s &quot;hott&quot;. It&#39;s commentary on fanfiction, on characterization, on writing in general. Have you ever read the &quot;Thursday Next&quot; series? The author does a very good job with a rather similar organization policing (mostly published) fiction, and despite the danger his characters get into, there&#39;s always tongue-in-cheek humor too. Highly recommended.<br><br>Anyway, don&#39;t create an Emergency, don&#39;t force characters to experience what their authors haven&#39;t decided they should, and don&#39;t mess with HQ, and you&#39;ll be fine.</p>

They also have a profound love for incestuous sexual pairings and frequently defend incestuous relationships with &quot;but we can&#39;t make babies so it&#39;s okay&quot;.

            <p>Basically, in HTML, the characters &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; are (usually) special. The browser interprets them as part of the &quot;markup&quot;, which is instructions for how the text of the page should be displayed or what it means. For example, if you put some words between &lt;b&amp;gt and &lt;/b&gt;, they become <b>bold</b> because the &lt;b&gt; stuff gets read as tags that mean &quot;the things between these are bold&quot;.<br><br>This system is nice because it lets you put things like bold or links into otherwise ordinary text, but it has the problem of making it seemingly impossibly to write about the tags, since, if you just put them in your document, the browser will interpret them and not show them to the person reading the page. If there wasn&#39;t a way around this, it would be impossible to write an HTML tutorial in HTML.<br><br>Fortunately, the creators of HTML have given us an escape hatch. It works like this: the string &amp;[stuff]; is also special. It doesn&#39;t get displayed as-is either. Instead, the [stuff] between the &amp; and the ; is used to find out which otherwise-special character you were trying to put in your page. Then, he escape is replaced by the character it represents when the page is presented to the user. (Escapes are also used to deal with encoding issues, but that&#39;s another story).<br><br>The three most useful escapes are:<br><ul>
<br><li>&amp;lt;, which represents a &lt;</li>
<br><li>&amp;gt;, which represents a &gt;</li>
<br><li>&amp;amp;, which represents an &amp;</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br>(Note that, in order for me to tell you the escapes, I had to escape them. So, to show &amp;amp;, I had to write &amp;amp;amp;, and so on. Isn&#39;t recursion fun!)<br><br>This is actually not the most common strategy for dealing with special characters. Many other computery things, like regular expressions, pick a particular character (almost always ) to mean &quot;flip the specialness of the next character&quot;. If you put a \ in front of a normally special character, it becomes non-special, and if you put one in front of (some) normal characters, they represent some different, special thing.</p>

            <p>I like how Za’kiir turned the Sue’s story against her.<br><br>There are some points Ixi, Des and Dawn missed (or they may have been newly created when you edited the doc):<br><br><i>“I’ll bet you fifty gold pieces that it turns <b>that out</b> she isn’t an Elf.”</i><br>The word order looks wrong to me. Shouldn’t it be &quot;turns out that she isn’t an elf&quot; or just &quot;turns out she isn’t an elf&quot;? Also I wonder whether the negation is intentional or whether Natalie actually intended to bet that it turns out that the Sue <b>is</b> an elf.<br><br><i>Three days later, Natalie was ready to play her tenth round of Solo Solitaire using flowers when a portal appeared in thin air.</i><br>Isn’t the usual phrase &quot;out of thin air&quot;? Since I’m not a native speaker, I may be wrong here.<br><br>Also, I wonder whether <i>making the journey from the Shire to Bree take only three days</i> is a legitimate charge. The journey from Bag’s End to Bree only took nearly a week because the Hobbits didn’t follow the main road, rested one day in Tom Bombadil’s house and lost many hours in the Old Forest and in the Barrow Downs. In the second-to-last chapter, they went from Bree to the Brandywine (east end of the Shire) in one day and from there to Bag’s End in a bit more than two days. I couldn’t find the badfic, so I don’t know whether the Sue followed the main road and where in the Shire (or <i>a few feet away from the Shire</i> her journey began; if it wasn’t near the western border of the Shire three days to Bree doesn’t look too short to me.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p><u>Things we enjoyed:</u><br><br>-the bit about the agents having to get used to their new Hobbit heights.<br><br>-the exchange about not taking the bet — “the amount is too low” — is pretty funny.<br><br>-“For those who have never experienced tense changes, imagine being on a roller-coaster, feeling like you’re about to throw up, and being dunked in icy cold water and scalding hot water at the same time for good measure.” Fantastic line.<br><br>-the bit with the Orc disguises.<br><br>-the Sue’s execution is well-written and plays well on the Sue’s tendency to tell, not show. The use of logic to cut her down was also pretty fun.<br><br><br><u>Things we spotted</u><br>(<b>Betas</b>, please take note of this and the next section as well. We <b>don’t</b> mean to embarrass you; we would, however, like you to grow as betas, and so we ask that you please have a look at what we found. It should give you a better idea of what to look for while betaing):<br><br>-LotR should be credited to Tolkien in the disclaimer.<br><br>-we adapted this straight from the chat:<br>“How are they cuddling mini-Balrogs without mittens, though?”<br>“...very painfully, I expect, Des.”<br>I think that speaks for itself.<br><br>-the plural of continuum is continua, although this does appear in dialogue and can be inferred to be the speaker’s mistake.<br><br>-Aura of Smoothness should be <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Aura_of_Smooth">Aura of Smooth</a> <br><br>-Butterbeer is a tasty drink from the Potterverse. Barliman <i>Butterbur</i> is the owner of the Prancing Pony. Frodo should be talking to the latter in the mission narration.<br><br>-“Khajiit hate to stop this, but we must continue the mission, yes?” Hate should be hates.<br><br>-urple is not a proper noun, and should not be capitalized except at the beginning of a sentence.<br><br>-the agents falling through plotholes and time warps is a bit odd — generally, agents are dragged along by the story. The plotholes especially is a little odd. Falling through a time warp sounds fine to at least one of us as a spin-off-specific thing (assuming there was, in fact, a time warp/distortion there).<br><br>-speaking of time warps, why is “Time-Warping” capitalized and hyphenated? At the very least, it should be lower-case. Same with time warp, unless you’re talking about the song (which is “Time Warp”, no hyphen), which you don’t seem to be.<br><br>-“Soon the two agents found a nearby bedroom in which they could rest. The two agents agreed on night shifts so that they wouldn’t miss the company’s departure, and then bid each other goodnight.” Using ‘the two agents’ twice here is repetitive.<br><br>-“...he had met in Skyrim acknowledged the gods there, and hailed at least one from time to time.” Hailed looks pretty odd in that context — to quote DawnFire from the chat: “&#39;hailed at least one from time to time&#39; to me looks like &#39;occasionally stood at some distance away, waved their arms, and called, &quot;Hallo over there! Well met!”’”<br>Much like that “ ‘ “ combination at the end of the above sentence, it looks pretty strange. However, unlike the combination, it’s also not quite right — gods are neither taxis nor people one meets at random. The word you probably want is ‘worshipped’, ‘swore by,’ or maybe ‘prayed to’.<br><br>-crash dummies generally go into the fic before the agents do, unless the agents want to be Sued (or forgot, cue the comedy!) In this case, since the dummy immediately begins to take on the Sue’s characteristics, the agents should’ve tossed it in first — otherwise, one or both of them should be starting to look like a Sue before they inflate it.<br><br>-on the subject of crash dummies: “Natalie inflated the crash dummy, which gained black hair and green eyes (though not elven ears, for some reason)” The ‘for some reason’ looks a little strange to some of us (read: Des and Ix), since it seems to imply that you are sure that Tolkienverse Elves ought to have special ears — accepted canon (read: some other people and our own hS) is generally that they’re leaf-shaped. Movieverse more or less supports this. If this is a comment on the Sue deliberately saying she’s an Elf but either ignoring the ears or stating that she has rounded ones, that should be made clearer (or else just take off ‘for some reason’, which also rather implies that maybe there’s a problem with the dummy.)<br><br>-further notes on the subject of crash dummies: “To use a crash dummy, shove the dummy into the fic first, so that the Sue inhabits the dummy instead of an agent. Crash dummies can be <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Assassination">assassinated</a> just like normal Sues; upon death, they turn back into crash dummies and can be folded back into a cube” (<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Crash_Dummy">from the wiki</a>) Unless this is a new breed of crash dummy, it shouldn’t be re-cubing on its own.<br><br>-from Iximaz: “I rode a draft horse named Bear when I was ten. Seventeen hands, he was a monster. So why is the unicorn being ‘big as a draft horse’ a charge?”<br><br>-Natalie calls Gandalf “the Gray Wizard”, but he’s never called that in-canon; the closest is ‘the Grey Pilgrim’. While this isn’t too much of a stretch, especially considering the Blue Wizards are a Thing, it’s a bit irksome, especially the gray/grey confusion.<br><br>-time compression ran rampant on the agents&#39; end. They slept, what, three times in this? We didn&#39;t get the sense they were in the fic for very long.<br><br>-there was a lot of Talking Heads Syndrome in the mission — we don&#39;t really see the agents hiding behind things, or where they are in relation to the scene. We’d advise writing in a bit more of their actions — looking at each other, glaring at the fic, writing down charges, rolling their eyes, eating Bleeproducts, ducking behind trees… that sort of thing. <br><br>-why did the Za’kiir take three days to kill the unicorn? If it was because he wanted the chance to hunt something, fine, but we aren’t told why he’d want to waste time killing a CAF when there was work to be done killing the Sue. Conversely, if the CAF was just that good at evading him, perhaps that should be mentioned more clearly.<br><br>-“This one is a Mary-Sue!” He punctuated the words with a thrust that she barely managed to block, as his speech fell back into the half-used third person Khajiiti used for those who were not close friends.” Khajiiti is a mini-Cliffracer; the correct plural is Khajiit.<br><br><br><u>The inconsistency section:</u><br><br>-Plothole and plot hole — each has been used once. Please pick one (plothole is the usual one) and stick to it.<br><br>-Your capitalization of remote activator is inconsistent. Generally, people go with lowercase; however, you’ve used ‘Remote Activator’ twice, and ‘remote activator’ twice more. At the very least, please choose one and stick with it.<br><br>-‘Hobbits’ is also inconsistent in capitalization. You’ve used both ‘Hobbits’ and ‘hobbits’ in dialogue and narration. It should be ‘hobbits’, say we, after looking in the source material. ‘Generic Hobbits’, however, is probably fine, as Generic anything tends to take a capital IIRC.<br><br>-Please be consistent in your use of em-dashes or their equivalents (in this case, the equivalents). Generally, you’ve used a single hyphen with spaces around it, except at the end of a sentence, where you’ve used a single hyphen with no spaces. However, several times you use a double hyphen (generally at the end of a sentence which is being cut off — where you’ve previously used a single hyphen without spaces). We find that em-dashes are easier to read than hyphens with two spaces around them (or even single hyphens without spaces), but with whatever you want to use — consistency is key.<br><br>-You’re also inconsistent with Mary-Sue versus Mary Sue. Either one is acceptable — but using both in one story without a good reason isn’t.<br><br>-The word ‘Elf’ takes a capital in Tolkienverse, although ‘elven’ and ‘elvish’ do not. Therefore, ‘Elf-wizard hybrid’ should have the capital e. You also have one instance of ‘Elf’ not being capitalized. In addition, you’ve used ‘elvish’ with a capital letter.<br><br>-Response center is inconsistently capitalized. Spin-offs use either Response Center or response center— but Response center in the middle of a sentence is definitely incorrect.<br><br><br><u>Some concluding thoughts:</u><br><br>Overall, we think this is okay for a first mission. The story is mostly solid, and it certainly has its amusing moments, but as it currently is — it needs a major clean-up. The characters themselves seem to be coming along nicely — we expect that they’ll end up being pretty good as they gain screen time and character development. However, the sheer number of errors — enough to fill three and a bit pages in a GDoc — detracted greatly from the story and made it, well, subpar at best.<br><br>Betas — please be sure that, when you beta, you’re checking mechanics as well as character and canon references. (You’ll notice that, while we’ve had a lot to say about the mechanics and some things to say about the canons, we’ve said very little about the characters themselves.) Please, if you feel that your knowledge of PPC canon is lacking, or even if you’re just unsure of things — a) try the Wiki or, if it’s a specialised question, the Board, and b) let the author know. There’s no shame in informing someone that they might need a beta with knowledge or skills that you can’t provide. We promise.<br><br>—Ix, Des, and DF<br></p>

            <p>Page 3: &quot;For those who have never experienced tense changes, imagine being on a roller-coaster, feeling like you’re about to throw up, and being dunked in icy cold water and scalding hot water at the same time for good measure.&quot;  I don&#39;t think the sudden stylistic shift of having the narrator directly address the reader works particularly well here.  It would be easier to say &quot;It felt like being on a roller coaster, about to throw up, etc.&quot;  That way, you get the same image, but don&#39;t suddenly switch to second person.<br><br><br>Page 6: There&#39;s a sentence that&#39;s just &quot;Za’kiir&quot; and then the paragraph ends.  Probably you just forgot to remove it in editing.<br><br>I liked the way you had Za&#39;kiir defeat the Sue in combat by taking advantage of the fact that she didn&#39;t have the fighting skill she claimed to.  </p>

            <p>Don’t worry, no actual damage done. I just felt uncomfortable reading this, because it reminds me too much of younger me. Which actually means that it is very well done.

            <p>I&#39;d argue that the Monologue is just that-- &quot;almost a little too much&quot;. Not quite enough to turn you into a complete mess (most of the time) but just enough to interfere with your day-to-day activity with a: <br><br>(✿◕ ‿ ◕) Friendly reminder that you&#39;re not worth it!</p>

            <p>So, I have asked Ixi about this, and she suggested I post it here and get you guys to voice your opinion.<br><br>Here&#39;s the deal: as we know, the agents operate from inside their Response Centres. Also, that&#39;s where they spend most of their time. The only exception are Time Lords agents, who can also make RC inside their own TARDIS and occasionally visit the HQ.<br><br>Now comes my part - one of my agents is a character replacement for John Constantine, an occult detective, a magician, and professional a-hole. In the new re-launch of DC Comics, Constantine owns an enchanted mansion called The House of Mystery. It is basically a sentient mension, filled with enchantments, curses and exisiting simultaniously in a dimensional rift and in the real world. The House also appeared in multiple DC universes, therefore is known to travel through space and time.<br><br>Since Gavin (my agent) is Constantine&#39;s replacement, should he have an access to the House and make his RC there? I do plan to explain it in a bio, and &quot;nerf&quot; the House a bit, disabling some of his powers (explaining this, being just a parallel copy of the original House).<br><br>What do you think, my brothers and sisters? Yay, or nay?</p>

            <p>First of all, Constantine no longer owns it, the current owner is  Zatanna.<br><br>Second, it is quite more likely that DOGA would have burned the house as a Geographical Aberration, instead of just allowing it to exist, because well, it is a house, it exists in a determinate place (across the road from the House of Secrets).<br><br>Third, why would the house allow itself to be used as a RC? The House is sentient, you know.<br><br>And fourth, why would <i>The Flowers</i> allow the Agent to use a <i>sentient magical house that exists in multiple dimensions at once</i> as a RC?</p>
