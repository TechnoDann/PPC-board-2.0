            <p>Zeb&#39;s heart was no longer bursting; it had just shattered into a million pieces.

He put on a brave face. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t have much experience with... with females, but my partner says the most important thing about meeting a girl for the first time is to be yourself.&quot; <i>Arceus, what are you doing?!

            <p>...and nearly walked into a small stampede of DIA agents running down the hallway. As a protoss and a Earth pony barrelled past Maxwell, a woman wearing a grey tunic over black pants and a long-sleeved shirt skid to a halt next to the Jolteon. She briefly adjusted her navy blue hijab, looking at the Lightning Pokémon. &quot;Maxwell! There&#39;s trouble down in one of the Reality Rooms. Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br><br>Maxwell looked at Zeb. &quot;Er, I think duty calls. Maybe we could look for the pool another ti--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maxwell! Return!&quot;<br><br>A red bolt of energy hit the Jolteon before he could finish his sentence. The little &#39;mon evaporated into a stream of energy that was quickly absorbed by a Nest ball held by Benoît. Once Maxwell had safely returned to his Pokéball the Kalosian man pressed the ball&#39;s centre button to collapse the capsule device and stowed it in a pocket on his bulletproof vest. <br><br>&quot;How bad is it, Meryem?&quot; asked Benoît, tightening his belt so that it wouldn&#39;t move around so much.<br><br>&quot;Bah, some agent team dumped a group of Judoon into a Reality Room to get them off their trail. We have to explain what happened to them and return them to their canon world. No biggie.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But they called Taldaris and Fire Flash! That&#39;s the textbook definition a biggie!&quot;<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re a particularly... uh... <i>determined</i> bunch of mercenary police officers,&quot; said Meryem. &quot;Things could get messy if we get in their way. Taldaris can do energy shields and Fire Flash can do the talking. We&#39;re there for backup.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Still doesn&#39;t sit right with me, but whatever. Let&#39;s move.&quot;<br><br>The two DIA officers took off in pursuit of their colleagues, leaving Zeb alone in front of Rudi&#39;s.<br><br></p>

            <p>((Wanna hear another story about my Trajek childhood? Make yourself comfortable, because this is a long one.<br><br>I attended a very small school, maybe 30 kids to a grade, from Kindergarten to sixth grade. I only got along with one other person, since I&#39;d managed to alienate everyone else back in Kindergarten by being the weird kid who preferred books to anything else and never shut up about <i>Harry Potter</i>.<br><br>So, back in sixth grade, there was a guy I had a huge crush on. Like, major, Legoluster-type crush. I was nuts about him. I told my only friend about it, and she accidentally told someone else. By the next day, everyone in the grade had heard about it. I was mortified... until that guy came up to me, and told me he thought I was cute and had never been able to work up the courage to ask me out.<br><br>We &#39;dated&#39; for a week. And then, the night before the school dance, he dumped me in front of the rest of the grade and laughed in my face. &quot;Like anyone would want to date <i>you</i>,&quot; he said. A group of girls who were particularly nasty individuals had convinced him it would be funny to set me up like that. I punched him and gave the ringleader of the girls two black eyes the night before the dance. I got several detentions for that, but it was worth it. Of course, the bullies got off scot free.<br><br>Let&#39;s go get internet-drunk and cry together about our experiences.))</p>

She was the big bully on the playground and I was her chew toy. She&#39;d spread rumors about me, push me around, and just generally make me dread going to school. The best part about it was that as she and her cronies (they never have the gall to bully someone alone, do they?) would shove me around they&#39;d know I&#39;ll never raise a hand against them-- after all, she was simply a girl playing a little rough but I would be branded as a boy who hit girls if I retaliated. What else could I do? I have to hand it to her, she played her cards very well. If there&#39;s one positive thing that I learnt from that period it&#39;s that I have a massive amount of patience for bull$hit. Or maybe I&#39;m just some sort of carpet. Whatever. <br><br>And then there was the time in middle school where some of the girls in my class wrote mean things in my yearbook. The best one went along the lines of &quot;you&#39;re going to have to bio-engineer a new life form if you ever want to get married&quot;. Another girl told me that I was gonna die alone. I literally can&#39;t make this up. <br><br>...but here I go again. Look at this thread derailment. This post is a mess.  I always feel that when I&#39;m talking to people that I&#39;m turning everything I say into a gigantic pissing contest to prove that I deserve people&#39;s attention or pity or something. <br><br>I hope I&#39;m not coming off as some sort of overly dramatic and angsty super-entitled goblin. I just wanna talk about some cruddy things that happened to me once.))<br><br></p>

There were six kids total who weren&#39;t white, and I know all of them were discriminated against, even by the teachers.)<br><br>I had some girls in middle school steal my yearbook and write similar things, though it was more along the lines of, &quot;If you ever want to get f**ed, you&#39;ll have to become the world&#39;s ugliest whore.&quot; She used a pink glitter pen to write that, too.<br><br>I can&#39;t help but wonder how many other Boarders have had similar experiences...))</p>

            <p>((Sorry to kinda jump in abruptly here, but I felt I had to say something. <br><br>Iximaz, reading about the experiences you&#39;ve had in years past just broke my heart. I know you&#39;ve told me about these things before, but it wasn&#39;t quite as detailed. Having people say and do those kinds of things to you is all sorts of messed-up, and you don&#39;t deserve it. You&#39;re the best girl I&#39;ve ever met, and I am truly blessed to have you in my life. I only wish I could have known you sooner, or that I too could tell your younger self that it does indeed get better. You definitely have people looking out for you, and I know that you are going to go on to do great things someday. Don&#39;t stop being the awesome person that you are, okay?<br><br>Ugh, I&#39;m just mad that someone would even consider writing things like that in your journal... Have an internet hug until I can give you one for real. Hang in there!))</p>

            <p>No, sadly, this is not the interlude I promised earlier. I will get to work on that soon, and I thank everybody who participated in the RP that the interlude will be set in. However, something happened in real life that I had to address in the PPC.<br>______________________________________<br><br>Printworthy was humming to himself, as he opened the door to his RC. “Marvin! I have returned, with a pristine Analysis Device.”<br><br>“Cool!” Marvin called from the other room, over the sound of his shower. “Just put it with the stuff.”<br><br>“And which particular clump of clutter should I shove this immaculate machine into?”<br><br>“The one with our gear!”<br><br>Printworthy rolled his eyes, but laid it neatly on the shelf by Marvin’s spear. It was around then that he noticed that things were organized. Indeed, orderly. Too orderly. “Marvin?” he called, looking around the room. “Is Rartiy well?”<br><br>Marvin turned the corner, lazily drying his hair with a Twilight Sparkle towel. “Yeah, she’s fine. Why, something up?”<br><br>“Rather, something isn’t up, nor floating and spinning around listlessly. Indeed, our sofa remains in its proper location, against all odds.”<br><br>“I don’t… Oh! Yeah, that.” Marvin chuckled. “Here,” he said, waving Printworthy over, “lemme show you.”<br><br>Pritnworthy shrugged and turned the corner, into an absolute whirlwind of fabric.  A sea of cloth swirled around the room, blue satin tearing itself to form, red silk stitching together with black lace, and purple ribbons tying bows in all manner of shapes. In the center of it all sat a small draconequus, sweat pouring down its face, as it waved it’s arms about, guiding the chaotic storm of clothing. “By Celestia’s Light…”<br><br>Marvin beamed. “Cool, huh?’<br><br>Printworthy shook his head, trying to wrap his head around it all. “What is this?”<br><br>Marvin stepped through the fabric storm, batting aside a piece of pearly frills. “Well, I knew how much Rartiy’s chaos annoyed you. So, I decided, why not turn her natural chaotic energy toward something more creative. I thought, well, since she’s named after Rarity, she might like dress making too. I brought over some fabric and just let her play. She seems to like it so far.” He made it over to the other side, lifting a neatly folded dress from the corner. “She even finished a dress. Isn’t it pretty?”<br><br>Printworthy lightly took the dress with his magic, guiding it through the chaos. He winced, as he accidentally knocked several buttons and bodices off their intended path, earning him a glare from Rartiy. When it made it through the room, Printworthy spent some time analyzing the dress. He spun it around, admiring every angle. “I have to say, I am impressed. The pearly white silk is wonderfully accented by the golden trim, providing a classical form of elegance. The way the golden fabric catches the light would help to slim the shoulders, while the rippling fabric of the body thins the waist. Overall, very high quality work.” He looked over to Rartiy, grinning. “Well done.”<br><br>Marvin shook his head. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He waded through the felt, a piece of black ribbon tying itself around his head. “It’s pretty, yeah, but where are getting this white and gold stuff?”<br><br>Printworthy cocked an eyebrow. “Where am I getting it? Marvin, the entire dress is white and gold.”<br><br>“Dude, you’re insane. It’s a blue dress, with black trimming. More of a night dress, bring it to a late-night party, you know?”<br><br>Printworthy looked at the dress, then back to Marvin. “I can almost see where you could confuse the white for a shade of blue, as there is a light blue tint to it.”<br><br>Marvin shook his head, grabbing the dress from Printworthy’s aura. “No, not like a light blue. Like a dark, navy blue. I have no idea where you’re getting gold.”<br><br>“And I see not a single black thread in this dress.”<br><br>The two agents bickered back and forth, shining the dress under various lights, stretching it at various angles; even having Marvin wear it to be sure they were seeing it properly. No matter how they tried, Printworthy insisted the dress was white and gold, while Marvin saw only blue and black.<br><br>Marvin threw off the dress, tossing it on the sofa. “You must be colorblind, dude.”<br><br>“I know for a fact my vision is unimpaired, save for minor farsightedness. If anyone is colorblind, it would be you.”<br><br>Marvin grumbled and stormed away, pulling his pants back on. “Whatever. Continue being insane if you want. It’s just a stupid dress anyway.”<br><br>Printworthy huffed, trotting towards his writing desk. “If your delusions give you comfort, I am happy to allow you continued residence in your twisted mental world.” He pulled out his favorite quill, and laid out some parchment. “Now, if you do not mind, I have a mission report to compose.”<br><br>Marvin grumbled to himself. Why was he getting so worked up about this? It was just a dress. But Printworthy was just… wrong! How could there be any white in that dress, much less gold. It was clearly black and blue! It just…was. He dared a glance and the infernal piece of clothing and froze. “What the…” He walked over to the sofa, lifting the dress. Against all reason, the blue fabric had seemed a lot lighter, almost white, while the black trimmings had turned brighter, turning a darker orange. As he continued staring, he saw what Printworthy must have been seeing all along. “Printworthy!”<br><br>The unicorn continued writing. “What is it, Marvin?”<br><br>“I see it!”<br><br>“See what, exactly?”<br><br>“The dress! I don’t get it, but it’s totally white and gold. I have no idea how, but, there it is.”<br><br>Printworthy spun around. “What are you on…?” His eyes widened. Now that he looked at it again, he saw a lot more blue in the dress then he had before. Indeed, the golden accents were darkening rapidly in his mind’s eye, turning a pitch black. “I can’t believe it.”<br><br>“I know! I’m sorry, man; I have no idea what I was seeing.”<br><br>Printworthy held up his hoof. “No, I should be apologizing to you. Clearly, this is an elegant midnight blue dress, emphasized with pitch black silk.”<br><br>Marvin turned the dress back to him. “No, you were right. Totally white and gold, there’s nothing else it could be.”<br><br>“Marvin, there is no need to lie for my benefit.”<br><br>“I’m not! It’s totally white and gold!”<br><br>As the agents fell back into bickering, continually trying to make the other see what they have already seen, Rartiy chuckled. Just as planned.</p>

            <p>Oh, very well done! I&#39;m starting to hate that stupid dress (for the record, I&#39;ve only ever seen it as blue and bronze, which earned me the ire of my classmates). I did see an interesting article about how and why people perceive its colors differently, though, so that was interesting.

            <p>When I first saw it, it was firmly white and gold. There was no way in Tartarus that thing could be black and blue. My brother, on the other hand, saw black and blue.

            <p>Not only am I firmly seeing this thing as blue/black, I cannot perceive any <i>way</i> of seeing it as any other colors. I just see a kind of glossy dress with a strong white flash illuminating it, no unusual optical effects at all.<br><br>When I first saw this meme, I was convinced that the whole point of it was to <i>claim</i> that the photo was some other color when it clearly wasn&#39;t, but unless KYM, the Board, and my own mother are in on the joke, I must conclude that maybe I have some sort of extremely rare colorblindness that has remained undetected until now (or ESP).</p>

I&#39;m guessing not many will want to slog through chapters and chapters to get to the good (bad?) bits.<br><br>3) Let&#39;s see what concrit we can come up with!

            <p>Disclaimer: I am no expert on Pern or concrit, but I&#39;ll do my best.<br>To start with, all the characters seem pretty interchangeable. I can&#39;t tell anything about any of them from the limited exposure I get in this story. Maybe it&#39;s a symptom of it being such a short story.<br>In fact, that would be the first thing I would suggest: flesh it out a bit. The plot isn&#39;t necessarily bad, but it could stand to be expanded on.<br>And I suppose that the ending, such as it is, is a bit of an anticlimax. There&#39;s basically no conflict: the characters pursue the villain, gain dragons, find the villain, then the villain dies without their intervention. It might help to see the rest of the chapters; as-is, it&#39;s quite clearly an introductory plot.<br>Uh... you could check spelling and grammar? Yeah, I&#39;m out of suggestions. No complete re-write outlines from me.<br>Oh, and you might want to give it a once-over; when you (presumably) Ctrl+F and replaced &#39;Lou&#39; with &#39;Alice&#39;, it also replaced &#39;lou&#39; within words. For instance: &#39;...the egg burst open with a Aliced crack.&#39; That made me chuckle, heh.<br>The style and characterisation actually reminds me a lot of my first attempt at writing, when I was seventeen. Man, that was bad. But I went back and did a complete re-write. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily claim that it&#39;s good now, but it&#39;s better. /digression</p>

            <p>(Why? Because the initial response was written on the fly at home, where I had access to the rest of the file. This is the <i>rest</i> of my thoughts)<br><br>Interchangeable characters is one of my perennial failings. It doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m fond of ensemble casts, but even in low character count stories, I have a hard time differentiating them. Agents Dafydd and Selene are a lovely example of this: they&#39;re both grumpy pyromaniacs with a tendency to lash out, and I&#39;m honestly not sure how &#39;different&#39; they feel. (Yes, this is why <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/1/PPC-Driftwood">PPC: Driftwood</a> pairs Selene with a hyper-bouncy hobbit-wannabe.)<br><br>So do you have any advice for improving on that? The two obvious methods are accents and abilities, but while the latter (in terms of skills, at least) is probably worth looking at (did Jacob suddenly become a technical genius somewhere in the middle of <i>Dragonchild</i>? I rather think he did), the former is a blind alley. So how <i>do</i> I make characters feel different from each other?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Ugh... I wrote a massive wall of text, realised I was rambling (and slightly ass-kissing), and deleted it. Time for version 2.0:<br>Having thought about it, most of your stories use the characters as expositors for and tools of the plot, rather than having the characters themselves drive the plot. Come to think of it, that&#39;s true for most of the PPC; I&#39;ve rarely come across an Agent who I care about like I do, say, Fred Weasley. In no way is this a bad thing; I think it comes with the fact that the PPC is aimed more at achieving catharsis than being dramatic. And that the Narrative Laws of Comedy rule HQ.<br><br>The issue with this story is that it&#39;s plot-driven with a weak plot. To salvage it, you would either want to (a) make the characters deeper and more individual or (b) play to your strengths, revamp the plot (while still keeping the same general concept), and add some funny.<br><br>...I&#39;m sorry that this isn&#39;t really answering how you could improve on your &quot;interchangeable characters&quot; problem, but that&#39;s not really a question I&#39;m able to answer. That issue is also a weakness of mine.<br><br>...And I&#39;ve gone from ass-kissing to slightly aggressive. Not sure which is worse.<br><br>Last night, I was thinking that this could almost play well as a video game. Side-quests could pad it out a bit, and possibly provide needed character development. Because what novels gloss over, RPGs emphasise!<br><br>What you could try is mimicking the style of an author who does character well until you assimilate it into your own style. But again, I feel like the intended style of a story also has an effect on the amount and type of characterisation it needs (Dafydd and Selene don&#39;t need to be different for the story to work; the enjoyment there derives from them outdoing one another).<br><br>I hope you can take at least something from this. Every time I start thinking about what I&#39;ve written, I pick it apart until it seems terrible, and one re-write seems like enough for now.<br><br>And now I&#39;ve thought of something else: trope archetypes exist for a reason. Start by choosing archetypes for your characters (or pairs of archetypes, mixing and matching), and follow those religiously (as in, &#39;How would this archetype react to this situation?&#39;). As you practise, you&#39;ll then be able to tweak the archetypes until you&#39;re creating believable, distinct characters. Really, practice is everything.<br><br>This is longer than I&#39;d hoped. I&#39;d best post it now, before I think of anything else...</p>

            <p>Well. The premise of this... really doesn&#39;t work, as I&#39;m sure you know. Hermione has been trapped in a tower for seven years. That means she hasn&#39;t <i>eaten</i> in seven years - that no-one has bothered to look for her in seven years - and that <i>Hermione Granger</i> couldn&#39;t figure out a way to escape. In seven years. Merlin&#39;s eyebrows, she even <i>says</i> the word &#39;rope&#39;! She&#39;s had long enough that she could&#39;ve Rapunzel&#39;d her way out.<br><br>And then she agrees to marry Ron, who she hasn&#39;t seen for seven years, and who didn&#39;t come looking for her until she wrote a note. She really should be insane, of course, but that&#39;s a bit crazy even for her.<br><br>But setting aside the impossibility of the <i>plot</i>, I kind of like the <i>characters</i>. Dean and Brian have the right kind of... well, not chemistry, but you know what I mean. I got a feel for their relationship, even though they&#39;re only minor characters. Ron comes across as someone who lost someone a long time ago, and suddenly finds out she might - <i>might</i> - not be dead. Harry... uh, yeah, Harry and the rest are a bit, um, blase about it all. But Ron, at least, I believe.<br><br>So: how could it be redeemed? I&#39;d focus on the strengths - those three characters - and drop everything else. Actually, number one suggestion: <i>don&#39;t</i> give us Hermione&#39;s POV at all. I&#39;d be tempted to stick with just Dean and Brian, and have them watch events. Just as a rough hashing-out, here&#39;s how I&#39;d write it:<br><br>Show us them finding the note, and taking it to Ron; show us Ron&#39;s reaction to reading it, through their eyes, and the way he runs off to find Harry; show us Professor Harry Potter coming to <i>find</i> the boys - Brian would be in awe, since he knows who Harry is, and have to explain it to Dean - and interrogate them about the note. He wouldn&#39;t believe it, he&#39;d think it was a cruel prank - but he&#39;d be cautiously convinced.<br><br>Then show us the staff meeting where McGonagall also questions the boys, but then is forced to say that <i>no</i>, they can&#39;t go and check: even after seven years, the spellstorm in that tower is still incredibly dangerous. Bring out the idea that so many spells hit it - and Hermione - that they don&#39;t know <i>what</i> happened. &#39;Perhaps in another seven years,&#39; McGonagall says. &#39;If she&#39;s really there - if she&#39;s survived this long - then she can last another seven years.&#39;<br><br>But obviously, Ron won&#39;t put up with that - and neither will Dean and Brian, and show us <i>them</i> sneaking out at the same time as <i>Ron</i> does, and running into him on the grounds. Then show us the broomstick flight into the spellstorm - mostly invisible from a distance, but a reality-warping madness up close. Borrow the sacrifice theme from the ending of <i>Philosopher&#39;s Stone</i> and force the boys to stay back (fighting temporally-displayed Dementors? Something even worse?) while Ron dives for the window.<br><br>And... I don&#39;t know. I&#39;d be really, really tempted to kill the viewpoint character - whichever one of the boys it is - but give him one last view of Ron&#39;s broomstick shooting skywards, with Ron holding an incredibly-long-haired figure tightly. Sacrifice, again. Alternately, let them all make it out (with Hermione), but end on a conversation in the Hospital Wing. She&#39;s weak, she&#39;s slightly crazy - shades of Bellatrix here - but she&#39;s glad to be free... and she&#39;d love to get to know Ron again. In a homage to the original ending, when Madam Pomfrey tells them all they have to leave, show Ron slipping a small black box back into his pocket; the idea that he&#39;s actually <i>got the ring</i>, but &#39;this isn&#39;t the time&#39;, makes a nice bittersweet end.<br><br>Like I say, that&#39;s what I&#39;d do. It keeps the main points of the story in place, but makes them more realistic and suspenseful. I think the idea of Hermione being trapped - and the spellstorm is my way of justifying that without providing an actual explanation - has some promise, but... yeah, not like this.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: The &#39;spellstorm&#39; is my own invention, with no grounding that I know of in <i>Harry Potter</i>. If there&#39;s an actual canonical example of spells lingering, or mixing, or anything like that, you&#39;d obviously use that instead.)</p>

            <p>I was considering just sending in the goriest chapter of that one mega-crossover that Falchion gutted on his very first mission, but I guess there&#39;s no point in beating a fainted Ponyta. So instead, I thought I&#39;d dig up an even older work that I produced not long after I joined dA - and the internet in general, for that matter.<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, <a href="http://fawkestheskarmory.deviantart.com/gallery/11640007/Pokemon-Iron-and-Copper">Pokemon: Iron and Copper</a>.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what was my specific reason for writing it, but it was probably idol worship for another artist who used to create fanmade Pokemon. I later abandoned the fic due to the guy selling most of these fakemon designs among a host of other reasons, but I figured it would be worth sharing.<br>The fic was structured in the form of episodes like in the anime, but it involved a Stuvian self-insert and a Mary Sue, both of which were &quot;avatars&quot; of two of the legendary fakemon the other artist created. There were also crossover elements involved, most notably my favorite TV cartoons and movies (AtLA and The Incredibles being the most prominent). <br>The concept of avatars of legendaries as explored in the fic itself was an interesting one, though, at least to me anyway.<br><br>The content itself is par for the course as badfics go, but I personally dislike <a href="http://fawkestheskarmory.deviantart.com/art/Iron-and-Copper-Ep-9-P-2-163167187">Episode 9, Part 2</a> most of all, because it ended with Violet needlessly acting like a total jerk. The episode after that would probably be a pretty close second, due to the subject matter getting a tad grimdark and needlessly long.<br><br>Incidentally, I plan to bring in one of the characters from this particular fic as the third agent of my DIC team - though I&#39;ll save the details for another time. ;)</p>

            <p>This is <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/4117/5/the-l-words/the-loss">Chapter 5</a> of my terrible, needlessly dark fic, The L Words, which I&#39;ve kept around more as a memento mori than anything else. While the whole story&#39;s only 20k-ish words, this one epitomises everything that was wrong with it. The writing was repetitive. The characters weren&#39;t even remotely connected to their canon selves. The writing was repetitive. Vast arrays of magic was added because eh, throw it in. The writing was repetitive, and the writing was repetitive.<br><br>Despite this, I defended it, because I had a grand plan for it to be about Twilight going through the healing process after prolonged torture and coming back stronger.

            <p>I was working on <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3343249/2/Literary-Hearts">&quot;Literary Hearts&quot;</a> back in high school.  The premise is similar to the first game&#39;s plot, but with an OC (partly self-insert) protagonist, and worlds based on books I liked instead of Disney ones.  Actually got some decent reviews during its run of activity, considering it&#39;s on the Pit!<br><br>I know the premise sounds pretty blah, but . . . I&#39;m actually rather fond of this story.  I do plan to update and continue it someday.  I still think about it quite often, and I even wrote a rough draft of the next chapter at work in the past year.  (Don&#39;t know where it went, though.)  So, if anyone can stomach the out-there premise, I would love some concrit and general thoughts!  (I linked to the second chapter, as the first is just a ripoff of <i>Kingdom Hearts&#39;</i> game-play tutorial.)</p>

            <p>Okay, I&#39;ve had to check up on the book here (I&#39;ve only read it once): Rosemary is the previous Receiver, who went crazy and had herself euthanised, right? Okay. But even knowing that... I can&#39;t really make head or tail of this piece.<br><br>It looks like all that happens is that Rosemary bumps into someone and gets chemicals spilled on her. But it&#39;s covered in a layer of... really strange writing.<br><br>I think the problem is that you were trying to lay two different effects on Rosemary at once. She&#39;s clearly &#39;zoned out&#39; - she reads like the whole world is covered in something of a haze - but you&#39;re also going for an &#39;emotionless/logical/obedient&#39; strain. And they... didn&#39;t combine that well.<br><br>Add to that the fact that I&#39;m not really clear <i>what&#39;s</i> bothering her. That the Giver claims to be her father, apparently - only how does that lead to &#39;<i>She was… she couldn&#39;t even describe it. Maybe it would come to her in a later memory. But for now…</i>&#39;?<br><br>Also, she can&#39;t identify the liquids on sight: but why would she expect to? I&#39;unno, this is another place where misty/logical doesn&#39;t combine well.<br><br>So what could be done? I think you&#39;d be best to extend it, and basically separate the two emotions. Show us &#39;logical Rosemary&#39; at first, when she runs into Duncan, and then as their relationship-of-a-kind builds, have first her emotionless retreat, and then the vagueness come in to replace it. Obviously that would need a longer story, but that&#39;s what you seem to have been originally planning.<br><br>There are some things I liked. The &#39;unrelated to training&#39; paragraph worked well, probably because it&#39;s the one place where &#39;vague&#39; goes away. And... well, I like the premise. Rosemary, from what I recall (I&#39;ve only read <i>The Giver</i> once), is a minor, off-page character - but one who went through exactly what the protagonist did. Written well, her story could cast new light on the theme of the book itself: a different point of view, if you will.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...but I have this imcomplete comic for an Original Character Tournament called <a href="http://end-run--pokemon-oct.deviantart.com/">End Run</a>, which was essentially World War II without firearms in the Pokémon World; where I introduced a NPC. Behold! <br><br><b>Corinna Chan and the Temple of the Lost Flute</b>!<br><a href="http://edhelistar.deviantart.com/art/Corinna-Chan-End-Run-NPC-App-301156058">Character Application</a> (Contains manin character&#39;s introduction and backstory)<br>Chapter 1: <a href="http://edhelistar.deviantart.com/art/CCatTotLF-Chapter-1-Insubordination-Part-1-307327509">Insubordination</a><br>Chapter 2: <a href="http://edhelistar.deviantart.com/art/CCatTotLF-Chapter-2-Mystery-Enigma-War-Part-1-311381487">Mystery, enigma, war.</a><br>Chapter 3: <a href="http://edhelistar.deviantart.com/art/CCatTotLF-Chapter-3-Frozen-Rainbow-Part-1-322602121">Frozen Rainbow</a> (Unfinished. I also have the physical versions without dialogue of parts 3 and 5 and still have the handwritten draft of the script, but I lost their digital finished versions when my old laptop was stolen. What happens next, essentially is: She kills those two guards, enters the place, kills two more, infiltrates the hideout, total chaos when the generator goes off, the Pichu evolves OFFSCREEN, finds the Rainbow Wing and escapes. In the still extant non-online drawn parts, there´s blood and a broken neck.)<br><br>Before this... thing, became a dead-fic; I was planing to introduce <a href="http://edhelistar.deviantart.com/art/Takeshi-Hoshimoto-Military-Medic-304780143">two</a> <a href="http://edhelistar.deviantart.com/art/Just-a-little-girl-308833825">more</a> characters, the death of the Lucario at the Ruins of Alph, teleporting the main character to Sinjoh Ruins, meeting <i>Arceus</i> and she becoming an Aura Guardian, pretty much making her the Pokémon World&#39;s version of a <i>freaking superhero</i>. Sincerely, I have no idea of how I came up with this plot, because drugs weren&#39;t involved.<br><br>Why I present it here? Well honestly, I mostly received praise for the work, and one flame (which incidentally came from a Suethor...), and makes me suspicious of how truly <i>good</i> it was, because I received no constructive criticism for it (<s>horrible</s> artwork not withstanding). Mainly I suspect the Main Character was a Sue <s>and the plot was stupid</s>.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not gonna comment on the artwork, for the record: just the writing.<br><br>Corrina is... well, first and foremost, she&#39;s not bothered to learn her own backstory. She was bribed into joining the army with a female Ralts (from Hoenn, not Sinnoh; she can tell the difference because... she can!), and this is her first assignment... but she&#39;s in the army because of her father, and she&#39;s been subject to repeated court martials. Given the way she <i>tore up</i> her first assignment, she not only deserves a court martial for gross insubordination, she should have the Ralts taken away from her and probably be locked up as a suspected spy.<br><br>But of course, she isn&#39;t. Instead, she just sweeps out of there - deserting from the army in a time of war (yeah) - and Superior McOfficer is powerless to stop her. Actually, I really empathise with Superior here - she&#39;s trying to fight a war here, and Corrina&#39;s whinging about not wanting to do anything. Yeah, Corrina, if it weren&#39;t for the woman whose office you&#39;re smashing, your cozy little log cabin would probably be <i>on fire</i>.<br><br>So, for the first chapter (and backstory), what can I say? Actually, given that Corrina teleports out (meaning Superior probably couldn&#39;t have stopped her), she&#39;s perfectly written - as a spoilt brat who&#39;ll hopefully get her comeuppance. With a slight tweak to imply that her previous disciplinaries - the ones her father got her out of - were during <i>training</i>, this scene works pretty well. Always provided we&#39;re not meant to <i>like</i> her.<br><br>Chapter 2. Again, the idea that Corrina is a loose <s>cannon</s> Voltorb who lashes out at everyone works here: Maya is clearly terrified of her. The fact that she then apologises to Maya suggests she&#39;s changed a little since exploding at Superior. Probably the best way to handle this would be to actually show us &#39;Chapter 1.5&#39; - the journey to the battlefield. Show us Corrina abusing her Pokemon (verbally and in terms of what she makes them do), but then show us her first experience actually killing another person. She may be the world&#39;s greatest hunter - but her prey doesn&#39;t normally whisper it&#39;s wife&#39;s name while it dies. Training is all very well - both Pokemon training and military (which she of course mostly ignored) - but it doesn&#39;t prepare you to actually, y&#39;know, murder someone.<br><br>(Depending on how high you want to drag the horror up: have her run into an armed man outside a log cabin and murder him - and then have his children run out of the house)<br><br>Oh hey look it&#39;s plot! The technobabble sounds, uh, technobabbly, but hey, Pokemon being able to view the past isn&#39;t too farfetch&#39;d. But then Mew... uh... um.<br><br>Okay, Mew&#39;s pretty obnoxious, but I can see two ways it could work. Either Mew has an evil plot, and the cheerful stuff is an act, <i>or</i> Mew is acting out of goodness and light and trying to make Corrina into a better person with all this &#39;chosen one&#39; malarkey. Quite possibly the story could use a double twist in which we find out the true story - and then find out that there&#39;s actually a <i>deeper</i> true story under it all.<br><br>Chapter 3: whooooooa, did I miss a bit? Suddenly we&#39;ve gone from &#39;you&#39;re the bratty chosen one!&#39; to naked panels and implied prostitution. Um, right.<br><br>This doesn&#39;t really work, because it&#39;s way too subtle for Corrina. Her technique for getting out of the army was to yell &#39;I&#39;m leaving!&#39;. Her technique for getting out of disciplinary trouble was to call for Daddy. Her technique for getting past the guards immediately before Chapter 2 was to beat them up and (fail to) wipe their memories. There&#39;s no way she&#39;d do anything here except all-out attack. (Also, haha, sure you were trained by ninjas, I bet you beat them in <i>every fight</i>, didn&#39;t you? Because, y&#39;know, your daddy would have killed them if they didn&#39;t let you)<br><br>But actually, <i>my</i> version of Corrina might just do this. She wasn&#39;t trained by ninjas, of course (though Daddy might have taken her round once and glowered at them until they said she was a &#39;natural&#39;), but with her experiences on the borders, and watching Nicolai die... yes, I can see her deliberately going for a non-lethal approach. She&#39;d probably have a hard time keeping her temper under control as the guards continued to refuse to let her in; I&#39;d imagine that ultimately she slaps one, they draw their weapons, and she (or Pichu) kill them in desperation. But that wasn&#39;t the plan, and she&#39;s upset by it.<br><br>Basically, I see Corrina as a deconstruction of Eragon: where Eragon goes about saying killing is bad and then keeps justifying it to himself, Corrina starts off thinking it&#39;s bad, realises it&#39;s awful - and then keeps failing to <i>stop</i> herself. Her ultimate victory in my version is when she&#39;s finally able to <i>not</i> commit murder in self-defence - even though it means she&#39;ll probably die. She started out using her &#39;principles&#39; as an excuse to do whatever she wants; she ends up following her principles even when it&#39;s the last thing she wants to do.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And all can summarized as &quot;Edhelistar cannot keep a consistent characterization for his OCs&quot;. But first, some little defenses:<br><br>1) To be fair, at that point of the story of the OCT, that specific officer (The Head of Intelligence!), was very overworked; because there was a mass defection and rebellion spearheaded by the Commander of the Army of Kanto, taking many high ranking officers and soldiers from both sides of the war; a single sniper going &quot;ronin&quot; and following her own agenda, was peanuts compared to that. Her reaction was pretty much &quot;someone else will take care of that&quot;, and she was right! By the end of the third chapter Corinna became an enemy for all three sides of the war.<br><br>2) Corinna never mistreated her Pokémon! That&#39;s her only redeemable part in fact, but well, that gives me some Fridge Logic, more on that later. By the canon of the OCT, War Pokémon, like Maya; were subjected to a very brutal  and traumatazing &quot;training&quot; that very few survived before asigning them to the soldiers. Maya was already abused before Corinna even met her, and Corinna was trying to actually help her. Then again, Maya is a Psychic-Type, what she probably has seen in Corinna&#39;s mind is certainly terrifying.<br><br>3) I tried to imply that she doesn&#39;t get along with her father, also I tried to imply that she was trying everything to get out of the Army, up to getting court-martialed (and jailed!), but to her changrin her father bailed her out everytime (ie. He beat her up at her own game, although; why her father wants her so bad in the Army anyway?). But still you&#39;re right, she was a spoiled brat... her mother spoiled her (this is mostly RP information that I never bothered to include in the main bio). Her mother was implied at some time in the past to being part of the Intelligence Agency of Sinnoh, being a fearsome assassin, supplying the Apricorn Poké Ball to Corinna, arraging the training with the ninja clan of Mahogany Town, and overall using her daughter as a pawn. (This backfired too, when she became a hunter, instead of an assassin.)<br><br>And now I will spork myself other inconsisties that I found, aside the ones you mentioned:<br><br>1) I implied many times in RPs and once in the bio, that she was to become an Aura Guardian, that would make her for default <i>an empath!</i> And considering she killed many Pokémon, which by all canons are supposed to be sentient or semi-sentient; she&#39;s waaay too much <i>sane</i> for the amount to empathic backlashes she sould have received  after killing hundreds, if not thousands; of Pokémon during those 10 years. She should have been an insensitive  psychopath by this point in time, and would probably have murdered without remorse those poor guys in patrol, instead of just beating them up. Just like she killed three Johtoan Guards a in the non-online next pages of the 3rd Chapter (I think I should upload them later today.)<br><br>2) She kills a lot of Pokémon regularly, while keeping the ones she own very spoiled, and claims to be very religious while killing the children of her <i>own</i> god... Hypocrite much?<br><br>3) Related to above, why would Mew, or <i>freaking Arceus</i>; choose <i>a known Pokémon serial killer</i> as a Chosen One!? That&#39;s just <i>dumb</i>!<br><br>4) This one last is a little dubious, but here goes: You&#39;re right, even if she got ninja assssination training, <i>those three guards above mentioned were her first human kills ever!</i> There&#39;s a huge leap between being trained to kill and actually killing someone. What makes it dubious is that fact that I&#39;m not quite sure if the empathic backlash of a dying sentient or semi-sentient Pokémon, is of the same or less strength than the one generated for a dying human.<br><br>5) Also the Lucario disappears in Chapter 3! <i><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Great continuity!</a></i><br><br>And you&#39;re correct, she wasn&#39;t supposed to be exactly sympathetic, after all, by chapter three she is considered a dangerous outlaw for all the three factions, she isn&#39;t making a lot of friends, and is making enemies of the few she already has.Yeah, <i>there&#39;s no way that would go wrong, right?</i><br><br>I could probably fix all the inconsistencies with a <i>massive</i> amount of retcons, and write Corinna a Grand Finale for her story, and hopefully redeem her, because despite all of her shortcomings, I&#39;m still quite fond of this character (and her Ageless Morally Ambiguous Sociopathic Heroine alternate version of her from my main continuum, would like to &quot;have some words&quot; with her [that means horribly torture, maim or kill her]).</p>

I understand wanting to completely <i>purge</i> every last trace of canon pollutant from the world but being the judge, jury, and executioner? I can&#39;t do that.

            <p>&quot;I only just met him - I&#39;ve known Ripper much longer myself.&quot; He motioned his beaked head towards the Deinonychus sitting nearby. &quot;The angel&#39;s name is Cupid, by the way. As for Rayner, he&#39;s a humanized pegasus from the My Little Pony continuum, and his nesting grounds are over at the DMS. I first met him a few weeks after joining the PPC, just after my sister made an ass of herself on her first mission.&quot;<br>He chuckled dryly, clicking his beak again. &quot;That&#39;s also how I met Rina and Randa, who joined me on my latest mission - which also happened to be Ripper&#39;s first one. A Pokemon badfic of epic proportions involving no less than four character replacements - and, from what Ripper told me, a dragon in a Poké Ball.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;And more importantly, is it anime-verse or game -verse? I imagine that the former must have a lot more visitors than the latter. Though I have to admit that keeping a dragon in a Poké Ball isn&#39;t much of a great feat: if a stock ball can hold, say, a Wailord, then the sky&#39;s the limit...&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Basically, this was a retelling of some of the episodes of the Johto-series anime from the point of view of Team Rocket. From what I was able to gather, the author of that fic actually made an entire anthology that kept on portraying that sort of stuff. Jessie and James - sorry, their <i>replacements</i> should&#39;ve stayed in the breeding center, but nooooo, they kept getting it on like what would happen if a Skitty used Attract on a Wailord. You know those two Pokemon are in the same egg group, right?&quot;<br>Falchion started laughing at his own joke, but then trailed off, sighed, and kept going. &quot;We also witnessed a scene where those two beat the crap out of a replacement of Ash - which my dino friend had for dinner the next day, by the way - and a run-of-the-mill OOC replacement of Gary. Randa was so upset by this mission that she transferred to Bad Slash immediately after we got back.&quot;<br>The Armor Bird Pokemon spared a furtive glance at Cupid behind him, who had joined some of his other friends in some kind of card game and was now slurring out some kind of drunken ditty. &quot;At least Sarah and Rosie managed to rescue the badfic characters from their concurrent mission,&quot; he warbled dryly. &quot;We had to kill all of ours.&quot;</p>

            <p>Before I say anything further, let me say congratulations on sporking another Rose Potter &quot;book&quot;. If Bleeptea were a thing IRL, I&#39;d suggest drinking copious amounts of it.<br><br>Actually, normal IRL tea can be calming as well, so I suggest taking a nice, slow drink of a cup or two before going any further!<br><br>That said, off to the mission itself!<br><br>First off, (at the risk of tooting my own horn) an internal squee rose up when you mentioned greengrocer&#39;s apostrophes, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=265877;search_term=greengrocer">for reasons that you might be able to guess.</a><br><br>But a few errors as well:<br>* <i>That sounded suspiciously like the Ground type one-hit K.O. move.</i><br>&quot;Ground-type&quot; should be hyphenated.<br><br>* <i>&quot;I trust your <b>judgement</b>, all right?&quot;</i><br>The word is spelled &quot;judgment&quot;, that is to say, please remove that first &quot;E&quot;.<br>(I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;ll get some flak for this from our friends across the pond.)<br><br>* <i>Riddle accused Hagrid of opening the Chamber of Secrets, and suddenly cast an </i>Arania Exhime<i> at the acromantula when it tried to escape. <br><br>...<br><br>“It’s spelled E-X-U-M-A-I,” Rina explained....</i><br>If the incantation was misspelled, then I&#39;d suggest putting it in quotation marks, like you did with Rose&#39;s faux-Latin back in the first part.<br><br>* <i>“Get out, uncanon influence!” she yelled, whacking Aragog again, “begone, bad characterization! The power of Rowling compels you!</i><br><br>The punctuation is off. Since there&#39;s an exclamation point to end the first quote, the second quote should start with a capital letter. Otherwise, replace that first exclamation point with a comma.<br><br>In other words, fix it like this:<br><i>&quot;Get out, uncanon influence<b>,</b>&quot; she yelled, whacking Aragog again, &quot;begone, bad characterization!&quot;</i><br><br>Or like this:<br><i>“Get out, uncanon influence!” she yelled, whacking Aragog again<b><u>.</u></b> “<b>B</b>egone, bad characterization! The power of Rowling compels you!</i><br><br>* And speaking of the exorcism, three questions:<br>1) What happened to the wraith itself? Usually an exorcism features the wraith leaving the body, even if it&#39;s only one sentence.<br><br>2) Why did Rina have to use <i>Expelliarmus</i>? She seemed to be doing the traditional &quot;whack &#39;em on the head with canon&quot; method with no problems.<br><br>3) How did Rina use <i>Expelliarmus/i&gt;? Unless Rina is able to do wandless magic, the omission of her taking out her wand (which is mentioned later in the mission) can be jarring.<br><br>Whew, that was quite a bit of typing. But nothing compared to what you have to deal with! Good luck, and don&#39;t go too insane!</i></p>

            <p>Of course all students could choose three or four or five subjects in their third year; and Hermione taking three in fourth year is a valid reason to figure this out.  <br><br>But it’s not a valid reason for blaming Rose or the suethor for Neville’s stupid assumption that students &quot;were only supposed to take two electives&quot;, unless you assume that in this badfic Neville should be able to divine what Hermione will do in a future year.<br><br>Thus, I tried to point out that other students taking five electives in their third year having already happened in previous years would be a better argument, because it actually shows that Neville – if he isn’t more stupid than the suethor intended him to be – should know that students are not limited to choose only two electives.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Hi everyone! Shall we play a game of &#39;who remembers me?&#39; Nah, just kidding. Most of you probably still do remember me (hi all you newbies! There really are rather a lot of you, aren&#39;t there? Welcome! Remember to take some Swiss Bleepolate for your belated Welcome Gift!)<br><br>Anyway. &#39;The most unusual returnbie post yet?&#39; you ask. &#39;What&#39;s so unusual about it?&#39; Well, friends...my university is on strike. That is, the TAs and contact faculty are, and all classes have been canceled so that all students are disrupted equally (so say the emails I&#39;ve been getting, in more or less that wording). So what to do with my sudden lack of schedule and increase of free time? Why, finally get around to making my first ever returnbie post, that&#39;s what!<br><br>Did you know that:<br><br>-I am now a published author? (In a collection of personal essays and other creative works, written by Canadian Jewish women about legacies. It&#39;s not fiction, although it does connect to my writing--I wrote about the impact my grandmother has had on my life despite passing away several months after I was born--but I&#39;m very pleased with it. And, of course, I mean to post about this around the time of the book launch, which was in, oh, November or so. Figures.) (I can, and probably will, provide more details, especially if anyone&#39;s curious or interested).<br><br>-I wrote all this and even a bit more on a cellphone? And then was silly enough not to double-check that everything had saved and didn&#39;t notice that some of it hadn&#39;t...and am now rewriting the rest? No, why would you know that already? Anyway: technology woes, enabled by a bout of lack of common sense. Ah well. There wasn&#39;t much more yet.<br><br>-I have now been a Boarder for <i>over two years</i>? The mind boggles.<br><br>-I don&#39;t actually remember the rest of my news? (And I didn&#39;t when I was first writing this either, if you&#39;re curious). That&#39;s what happens when returnbie posts are delayed. Oh well!<br><br>Anyway. I do hope to be on more now, though we&#39;ll see just how much. It&#39;s really fun to be writing this, and to seeing everyone again! (figuratively speaking). Hi all! So lovely to be back!<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>And funnily enough, yes, I am. Good guess :)<br><br>Did you know, the last time there was a strike it went on for three months? The <i>government</i> had to step in. No clue how long this one will last, which is really kind of annoying. Meanwhile, I hear from U of T that it&#39;s a mess--a lot of classes are canceled, but others aren&#39;t. Some are running with the prof but no TAs, and others are running with TAs but no prof. York actually seems stress-free in comparison.<br><br>At least I had Purim off. That was pretty nice.

            <p>I&#39;m not sure I do, actually. I know I got a complimentary copy (I think?) but I can&#39;t remember if I get money from it. Probably not. But it&#39;s my first publication in an actual book, and it was a wonderful experience (okay, with stressful pieces due to school, but completely worth it).<br><br>I do not mind sharing the title! My post-book launch post was actually supposed to have a picture of me holding it. Some other time, I guess. It&#39;s called <i>Living Legacies - A Collection of Writing by Contemporary Canadian Jewish Women (Volume IV)</i>, or <i>Living Legacies</i>, Volume IV, for short, and is edited by Liz Pearl. <a href="http://at.yorku.ca/pk/ll.htm">This seems to be the main link</a> to look at, since it&#39;s not on Amazon (or if it is, I can&#39;t find it); there&#39;s a button marked Order Form in the navigation at the top, which seems to be how you buy it. Once you&#39;re actually looking at the table of contents, I&#39;m on page...40 or 41, I think, with a piece titled &quot;A Granddaughter&#39;s Muse&quot;. And I am completely honored (and flattered) that you want to buy it, by the way. I hope you find it interesting--I&#39;m actually the youngest author in there, so the perspectives vary quite a bit. We&#39;re also from a variety of religious backgrounds (within Judaism, that is), if I remember correctly, so that adds to it...anyway. Enjoy (and I am open to comments, as most authors tend to be :))<br><br>On another note, who are our other published authors? I can&#39;t believe I don&#39;t know this.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>It&#39;s definitely awesome to have a writing credit, but I wish you were making some bank from it.  Don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to buy it anytime soon, since I usually get books from Amazon, but I&#39;ll give it a try.<br><br>As for your sisters in the realm of published PPCers:<br><br>Kippur was an old-timey PPCer who returned a little while ago to plug her non-fiction book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tropes-Fantasy-Fiction-Gabrielle-Lissauer/dp/0786478586/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">&quot;The Tropes of Fantasy Fiction.&quot;</a>  She&#39;s putting her old <s>sporking</s> criticisms of The Inheritance Cycle to work!<br><br>Another . . . well, I know for a fact she wouldn&#39;t want her real and online identities in the same place, so I&#39;m going to defer from linking her stuff.  She&#39;s published two urban fantasy novels, though.<br><br>Lastly is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/D.J.-Natelson/e/B00EUQZQ72/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_2">D. J. Natelson</a>, who hasn&#39;t been active since before I joined.  I still won&#39;t share her old online name, for privacy concerns.  Take my word for it? :D  I found out that she was published purely by accident, when I was archiving her PPC spin-off last year and clicked through to her LJ, which then linked to that Amazon page.  (And she&#39;s churned out two more novels since I was last here!  Yikes!)<br><br>So!  We grow closer and closer to That Awkward Moment When some newbie does a mission to a canon created by a former PPCer!</p>

            <p>Now I feel special. And you&#39;ve been taking on Rose Potter! Well done, Ix! (Ixi? Maz? Hm. Not sure how well any of those work). I&#39;ve only read the first one so far, but it was <i>fun</i>. Very well done.<br><br>Ooh, SPaGhetti. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had that before (or did you give me some before? You might have...hm.) Thanks very much! *noms*<br><br>And thanks! Hm, more to share...well, I got to read at the book launch, which was unexpected and very fun :D I also did the smart thing of taking a course in Israel over winter break (missed the chance for a mini-Gathering while I was there due to programming and exhaustion from programming)...and then flying back on the first day of classes and going directly to an 8:30 am class. Fun, but not too smart overall, if you take jet lag into account. I had a lot of fun there, though--the course was interesting, and I got to immediately see my newest baby cousin (he&#39;s absolutely adorable, I flew in on his eighth day of life and got to see him and his family for Chanukah candlelighting the same evening, and <i>I held him multiple times and sang &quot;Goodnight Irene&quot; and other songs to him</i>. I also got to spend time with some very close friends, and even got to celebrate their youngest twins&#39; birthday just before I flew back to Canada.) As to flying back to Canada, there was snow and I was in a pretty light coat. I survived, though!<br><br>How&#39;s that for more to share? :)<br><br>I&#39;ve also been working on some writing projects, though I had very little time to do that during December...oh! Did I write here that <i>I won NaNoWriMo for the very first time last November</i>? Because I did. I&#39;m still somewhat in shock. I wrote 15,000 words on the last day, too, and I&#39;m still wondering how I did it (Karen and another friend spurred me on, as did word sprints and, I don&#39;t know, desperation or something). Oh! And I&#39;ve been making friends this year. It&#39;s exactly what I wanted to do <i>last</i> year, but better late than never, right?<br><br>And that really probably is enough to read at one time, so I&#39;ll leave it there for now.<br><br>~DF</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>I don&#39;t suppose anyone remembers last year&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255865;">Purim RP</a>? It was basically a fun sort of thing where every single resident and affiliate of HQ got an invitation to a Purim party, and was invited to come in costume. It was a lot of fun, as I remember--so why not do it again this year? Today is Purim, after all, and Shushan Purim is tomorrow (or today, if you&#39;re Desdendelle/in Desdendelle&#39;s timezone or somewhere similar). Why not make it a potentially temporary annual event?<br><br>Purim, essentially, is a Jewish holiday that happens once a year, and is full of fun. There is traditionally a feast (or festive meal), we dress up in costumes, there are Purim shpiels (that is, short, funny, amateur performances of the Purim story), drinking is actually encouraged (for those who want to), and we give gifts of food/candy (and often drinks) to our friends. Giving money to charity is also part of the holiday, and the hamantaschen (cookies, yum!) that we eat apparently <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/31833/8-great-arguments-latke-hamentash-debate">helped to spawn an annual debate among PhD holders</a>, which is just about the best thing I&#39;ve ever heard. (The link has some short extracts from the debates, which are pretty funny). In short, it makes for a rather fun RP atmosphere!<br><br>So, what do you say? Shall we embark upon a second Purim RP?<br><br><b><u>The Rules/guidelines are the same as last year:</u></b><br><br>-<u>Everyone is welcome.</u> That means new agents, old agents, reluctant agents, enthusiastic agents, agents who wandered in by mistake...everyone. It also means minis, kids, and possibly pets. Free-To-Use Agents are also good.<br><br>-<u>This is newbie-inclusive!</u> While I know some newbies (often depending on just how new they are) have agents they&#39;re thinking about, many other newbies don&#39;t--and, well, this is Purim. It&#39;s a party. Everyone should be able to come! So...everyone includes Boarders, with the condition that you&#39;re incognito! Pretend to be your costumes, pretend to be newly-recruited agents, whatever you like--as long as you remember that the vast majority of PPC HQ&#39;s inhabitants don&#39;t know the Board exists (and would forget if they found out). Of course, this isn&#39;t just for newbies; if you&#39;re not a newbie and you really, really want to, write yourself in! The same rules apply, though. <i>(This didn&#39;t really happen last time, apart from <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=256341;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">one exception</a> that I know about, but it&#39;s definitely still open!)</i><br><br>-<u>On canon-compliance:</u> this one is up to you. For my part, I consider most of what my agents get up to in this as canon, to the point of working the occasional reference into various works in progress. Referencing without much detail is also a potential thing--for example, &quot;That was quite the party, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I think my mini was organizing an army to annex the food tables at one point.&quot; &quot;What, seriously? I didn&#39;t even notice.&quot; &quot;Neither did I, until I got hungry.&quot; ...Anyway, you can call this canon or not (or anything in between) for your agents as you wish. It&#39;s entirely up to you.<br><br>-<u>Have fun!</u> It is Purim, after all, and Purim is a time for celebration. So let&#39;s celebrate!<br><br>Fellow Boarders--let&#39;s have a <i>party</i>.<br><br><i>/Exits stage right, throwing hamantaschen/</i>.<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: <b>And so it begins:</b><br><br>&quot;Sister!&quot; Naergondir, SIELU agent and Noldorin Elf, ducked under a tree branch and grabbed his sword from the response center&#39;s floor. &quot;Sister, are you prepared?&quot;<br><br>Gurnirel, Naergondir&#39;s partner, slipped barefoot through the RC&#39;s foliage until she stood in his line of sight. &quot;Meldaner, it is you who insisted on forging gems that glow. If not for that, we should have left long since. The festival will have begun without us.&quot;<br><br>Naergondir attached the sword to his belt, and straightened his tunic. &quot;Saileldë,&quot; he said firmly, &quot;costumes are encouraged. Should I not strive for accuracy?&quot;<br><br>Gurnirel pursed reddened lips. &quot;If you wish for accuracy, dear brother,&quot; she replied, and shook back the golden curls of her hair, &quot;you should not have made them; for the Silmarilli were taken from Fëanor, and we do not know of anyone who has dressed as one of his foes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed,&quot; Naergondir said, &quot;but sister, false Silmarilli only add to this pretense. He did wear them upon occasion in Aman.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This,&quot; said Gurnirel quietly, &quot;is not the blessed land. And you are no prince of the Noldor.&quot;<br><br>Naergondir&#39;s mouth twisted briefly. &quot;Indeed not,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;and for that I am grateful. But come. We must hasten, if we are to taste the delicacies.&quot; And he began to wend his way through to the door.<br><br>&quot;And have you your &#39;Silmarilli&#39;?&quot; Gurnirel asked. She followed him, curled hair bouncing lightly on the shoulders of her Hobbit gown as she moved. &quot;&#39;Twould be a shame to have spent so long making them only to forget them here.&quot;<br><br>Naergondir shook his dark-haired head. &quot;They are here, sister,&quot; he said, and patted a belt pouch. &quot;They are safe.&quot; He reached the door, and cast her an amused look. &quot;Saileldë, do not question my costume further. <i>I</i> have elected to dress as a gifted Noldo who came to grief; <i>you</i>, dear one, have dressed yourself as a Halfling. Both of our choices could easily be questioned.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye,&quot; said the elleth dryly, and opened the door, &quot;but mine, at least, is the less likely to cause offense.&quot; She smiled at him, and stepped out the door with falsely hairy feet. &quot;Come, brother. Let us attend this &#39;Purim&#39; festival.&quot;<br><br>Naergondir followed her, and closed the RC door behind them. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Let us away to this festival. No doubt there will be much to explore...&quot;<br><br>And with that, the Calaquendi burst into the latest on their list of silly songs, and began to walk. Two clear voices bounced off the walls around them as they went:<br><br><i>&quot;Ohhh once there was a wicked, wicked man<br>&quot;And his name it was Haman!&quot;*</i><br><br>--<br>*To the tune of &quot;For Tonight We&#39;ll Merry, Merry Be&quot;. Not my invention.</p>

            <p>Before she could continue that thought, though, she heard that joyous cry, and next moment, someone had tackle-glomped her and pressed his face into her bosom.

            <p>&quot;Well, my brother explained the short version first. He&#39;s a Skarmory, just so you know.&quot;<br>She then remembered that she was still holding Solvig&#39;s hand - and that she was still upset with her partner.

Actually, there are almost 700 species of Pokemon to date, and who knows how many more we&#39;ll get in future games. Cupid would know more about them, though, being from a Nintendo continuum, and don&#39;t get me started on Adam - er, Falchion himself.&quot;<br>She steered the conversation back to their origins. &quot;As for me, I&#39;m a clone as well - specifically, I&#39;m actually Stratogale, a deceased bit character from <i>The Incredibles</i>. Well, specifically, a fan-made interpretation of her created for a fic that got ruined when my author turned out to be a colossal asshole and ended up getting at least ten other continua thrown into the mix.&quot;<br>Cupid, who was now trying to pat Zeb on the head (with understandably shocking results), stared at the Super in abject horror. &quot;You never told me about that specific part of your homefic before!&quot;<br>&quot;You wouldn&#39;t have believed me, Angel Face,&quot; she replied, eyeing him suspiciously. &quot;Anyway, the mega-crossover elements of my homefic may have actually been the pivotal reason for my being assigned to the DIC - though I did go through several missions with Adam and Rosie (that&#39;s Falchion and Rashida to you guys) before then.&quot;<br>She turned to Harris and Sonia. &quot;The last one I had before leaving was the one where I first ran into Lover-Boy here. I&#39;m still thankful that Lady Palutena lent a hand in that mission, because now the only two things I have to worry about with him are getting him to moderate his alcohol intake and teaching him to hold a conversation without being indecent.&quot;<br>She spared another aside glance at Cupid, who was still trying to pet the Luxray, getting comically zapped each time.</p>

            <p>If getting zapped for the twelfth (or maybe thirteenth?) time didn&#39;t make Cupid get the message, his vocal displeasure probably did.<br>&quot;Alright, alright! Sorry about that!&quot; he said hastily, backing away quickly and patting out his smoking cowlick. &quot;Anyway, yeah, both Sarah and Zeb are right. And not only that, the Pokemon games have had six different releases over the span of almost two decades.&quot;<br>He turned to Zeb again, his hands behind his back. &quot;I&#39;m honestly jealous.

            <p>&quot;Well, relatively speaking,&quot; the Super chuckled darkly. &quot;I&#39;ve made it a point to never even touch capes with a ten-foot pole ever since I got my sorry nameless butt shredded by that jet turbine in my one appearance in canon. As for my life in the PPC, the entire reason I opted to move out of my brother&#39;s RC was because Rosie gave me a hard time, especially on the mission that led to Cupid getting rescued. Of course, knowing what I&#39;ve heard about her, I&#39;m not surprised at all.&quot;<br>&quot;Wasn&#39;t she the one who transferred to Floaters after that tragic accident last year?&quot; asked the angel, putting the winged helmet of his cosplay back on. &quot;When I was still a Sue-wraith and I faced off against her, I managed to get a glimpse into her head and caught a couple of hints. I never got the full picture, though, at least not before Lady Palutena stepped in.&quot;<br>&quot;Rosie&#39;s been keeping that particular fiasco under wraps for months,&quot; said Sarah. &quot;All I know is that the partner of one of her friends died before she could save him. The rest, well... let&#39;s just say she never liked to talk about it.&quot;</p>

            <p>Xericka signed. &quot;Gremlin, do not make a fuss.&quot;<br><br>Gremlin gave no indication that she heard her partner. Rather, her attention was glued to the two spies talking to the shaken-looking girl. &quot;The nerve of some people,&quot; she muttered through clenched teeth. &quot;I mean, where do they friggin&#39; get off? &#39;Blue hair? Is she a Sue or something?&#39; That&#39;s... that&#39;s <i>hair-cist</i>.&quot;<br><br>The Nobody rolled her eyes. &quot;Hair-cist. Really?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m gonna go give them a piece of my mind.&quot;<br><br>Xericka quickly reached out and grabbed Gremlin by the collar of her blue tank top. &quot;You said that you would not cause a fuss before we came here,&quot; she said. &quot;You said that this was an exercise in relaxing and self-enjoyment. I am holding you to that. Leave the spies alone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But they said—”<br><br>&quot;I neither need nor want you to get offended on my behalf. Their words are irrelevant to me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is Aunt Gremlin gonna beat those guys up?&quot; a new voice added from around knee level.<br><br>The two agents looked down. Aiden was clutching onto Xericka&#39;s boot with one hand and a half-eaten hamantaschen with the other. He stared up at Gremlin, his face all curiosity and innocence underneath the paper scar tied around his head like an eye patch.<br><br>Gremlin sighed. &quot;No,&quot; she said, slouching slightly. &quot;Auntie Gremlin will not go beat those guys up. She will instead stay here by the snack table and drink, &#39;cause your mom asked nicely.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Xericka replied. She smoothed down her red and black jacket before taking a sip from her own wine glass.<br><br>Gremlin merely mumbled in response.</p>

            <p>It was immediately followed by an incredibly tall young man, dressed in a black longcoat and matching hat. His glomp had clearly timed out poorly, as he missed the mini and slammed his face into the ground in front of Xericka.<br><br>&quot;Ow. My. Nose.&quot; He stood up to check if his nose was bleeding, then noticed the Nobody and grinned. &quot;Hey, looks like someone visits the same boutique as the Horseman of Death. My name&#39;s Valon, Department of Floaters. Riddle me this: why do mini-Balrogs run from me? The minis in my RC like hugs. Also, what might your name be?&quot; If the deathly pale skin hadn&#39;t clued his audience in to strangeness, his meandering stream-of-consciousness rambling probably did.</p>

            <p>&quot;You see?&quot; she said. &quot;Just using the disguise generator to color different parts of your normal coat red does not an Asami Sato costume make.&quot;<br><br>Xericka ignored her, focusing instead on the new and somewhat strange arrival. &quot;I am Agent Xericka with Department of Bad Slash. This is my partner Gremlin and my son Aiden.&quot; She paused as Aiden gave a short wave with his cookie. &quot;I cannot help you with your mini problem.

            <p>When Valon heard the name &quot;Aiden,&quot; his expression changed, just for a moment, to pure melancholy. He bounced back quickly and continued his train of thought.<br><br>&quot;One can digest anything, as other minis of her kind proved in my last mission, one can charge at forty miles an hour, and I just got a mini that looks like it might explode. Fire demons are nothing.&quot;<br><br>Valon looked over Xericka&#39;s outfit. &quot;I feel like I should know this, but who&#39;s Asami Sato? I&#39;m dressed as Charon, from Pathfinder.

            <p>...she did not mention it. Instead, she took another sip from her glass.<br><br>&quot;By <i>Pathfinder</i>,&quot; she said, &quot;I assume you are talking about the role-playing game.

            <p>&quot;Haven&#39;t seen that, I&#39;m afraid. And there are other series called <i>Pathfinder</i>, I think there&#39;s a novel series by Orson Scott Card I haven&#39;t read, but yes, I did mean the RPG. I&#39;d like to play more often, but one of my partners doesn&#39;t have a physical body, and the other would get bored rather quickly. That&#39;s her over there, talking to the Luxray-girl.&quot; He pointed out Kala; a scorpion-woman is hard to miss. &quot;And I don&#39;t leave the RC much, so I don&#39;t know too many other people in the PPC.

            <p>&quot;One of the agents who recruited me is involved quite heavily with tabletop role-playing,&quot; she eventually said. &quot;I am not sure if he runs any <i>Pathfinder</i> games, however.

It doesn&#39;t feel like a <i>Halo</i> AI, or even a <i>Portal</i> AI.&quot; She looked back at Valon. &quot;Am I right? Am I close? It&#39;s something to do with that activator.&quot;</p>

            <p>The elaborate ensemble was, if Cassie was honest with herself, rather uncomfortable. At least she and the inspiration for her costume had a similar bust size, though what the canon herself would have made of that comparison was, alas, very clear. It involved buzzing things in the middle of the night, when no-one else was around. Also, the goggles were beginning to fog up and it transpired she hadn&#39;t sanded down the plastic on the inside of the mouthguard, so that was all manner of fun and jolly japes.<br><br>&quot;Er, excuse me,&quot; she said to a startlingly accurate Tenth Doctor cosplayer, &quot;I, er, I was wondering what exactly you&#39;re meant to do here? Um, I&#39;m Cassie. Well... technically I&#39;m Taylor, but only for this evening.&quot;<br><br>The chitinous, dark grey body armour, spikes, mandible-shaped mask and glowing yellow eyes added up to an intimidating presence, but it was somewhat mitigated when the tall girl managed to trip over her own feet and faceplant next to the other girl&#39;s shoes. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that, by the by, it won&#39;t show on red shoes.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Just went off what you told me when we talked before. Short brown hair, little on the tall side, and a massive Doctor Who fan.

            <p><i>(A/N: Rather than have any of my existing agents take part in this, I might as well take the opportunity to introduce a new one. Basically, remember <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=269600;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a> fic? Well, let&#39;s just say that the Mary Sue of the fic escaped after I left dA and discontinued it two years ago, and ended up in the PPC by mistake with nowhere else to go. Enjoy!)</i><br><br>It&#39;s funny how the Ironic Overpower drops you in the strangest of places.<br>The air seemed to shimmer for a few brief moments, and then, like something out of a cartoon, it spat out an anime-style pre-teen girl, who landed on her butt with a dull thumping noise. She sat there, momentarily confused, and then realized that there were a lot of strange people surrounding her.<br>The girl&#39;s large blue eyes swiveled around wildly in their sockets as she tried to find a hiding spot, though she was quite sure her royal blue hair with baby blue (or was that blunde?) streaks certainly wouldn&#39;t have gone unnoticed even if she hid under the snack table.<br>Which was exactly what she did a few seconds later.<br>How frustrating it was that even after two years at the Nursery, the blue-haired girl still had to struggle to get anywhere via plot hole. Granted, she <i>had</i> improved quite a lot since she&#39;d first ended up the PPC (by complete accident, of course), but plot holes are fickle things, and with the obvious exception of portals, they tend to drop you off in the most inconvenient of places. In this case, this particular one had landed her smack in the middle of a huge costume party - and parties weren&#39;t exactly her idea of fun.<br>Quivering anxiously and trying not to hyperventilate, the girl curled up into a fetal position under the table and, in complete and utter disregard of the Ironic Overpower, she silently prayed to all of the legendaries that nobody would notice her...</p>

And no, I actually don&#39;t have a D.O.R.K.S. with me - I had to rush back to the Nursery to get the costume.&quot;<br>E.V.L. chuckled. &quot;Experimenting with plot holes, I take it?&quot;<br>The blue-haired girl rubbed the back of her head in embarrassment. &quot;How did you think I got here in the first place?&quot;</p>

Then again, of course, the Pokemon anime lets tweens run around with fire-breathing dragons and plants that can eat you whole...&quot;<br>&quot;Either that, or Ash was just unreasonably skilled,&quot; piped up E.V.L.<br>Lapis gave the ex-Ficubus a deadpan expression. &quot;Isn&#39;t that the case for anime protagonists in general?&quot; she said. &quot;At least I didn&#39;t fall in love with him like, you know, a normal Sue would&#39;ve. He was a friend, simple as that.&quot;<br>The blue-haired girl turned back to Gaspard. &quot;And I&#39;m actually not going into the DMS - way too risky. And Bad Slash is a no-go for obvious reasons, so I&#39;ll most likely end up in the DIC. At least there usually aren&#39;t as many Sues to get rid of there.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Maybe you&#39;d like Intel better?&quot; asked Sonia. &quot;There&#39;s even less danger involved-- even if you do get accepted into Action Division.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think Upstairs cares at this pointed,&quot; said Gaspard. &quot;From what she told us she&#39;s pretty much locked into DIC. Even if I personally think it&#39;s far too young to be doing this at your age, good luck to you, Miss Lazuli.&quot;<br><br>Harris, who had been observing the rest of the room, frowned and stood up straight. &quot;Did you see that? Hey, Sonia, De Grasse. Did you guys see that?&quot; He stabbed a finger towards a short angel who was currently engaged in a poke war with someone dressed as Marvel&#39;s Black Widow. &quot;That <i>scoundrel</i> just buried his head in that girl&#39;s chest! That&#39;s totally inappropriate!&quot; Harris then pointed at the auburn-haired Supergirl. He rolled up his already-rolled up sleeves and marched forward, determination in his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go and give him a piece of my mind, just you watch...&quot;<br><br>As Harris left, Sonia and Gaspard exchanged a quick glance. &quot;It <i>is</i> harassment,&quot; said the French Québecois agent. <br><br>&quot;I agree,&quot; replied the former bit character. &quot;I&#39;ll just make sure Harris doesn&#39;t go overboard...&quot; she added as she followed Harris.<br><br>Gaspard, suddenly deserted by his colleagues and surrounded by strangers, awkwardly shuffled in his metal boots. &quot;Er... you guys having fun?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Didn&#39;t I hear of that angel guy?&quot; asked E.V.L. As she took another cookie. &quot;He and I may well be the only Sue-wraiths who have ever been recruited. From what I heard, though, his conversion was a lot less painful than mine.&quot;<br>&quot;Did I miss anything?&quot; asked Lapis, finishing her slice of cake. &quot;I was kinda busy talking with you guys... Did he do something that Harris didn&#39;t like?&quot;<br>&quot;He&#39;s thirteen, I think,&quot; said Rayner. &quot;Hormones up the wazoo and no sense of inhibition... Did you honestly think something like that WOULDN&#39;T happen?&quot;<br>&quot;You weren&#39;t so chaste yourself back in your homefic,&quot; the ex-Ficubus pointed out.<br>He glared at her like he wanted to rip her throat out. &quot;Tell me again why I still work with you...&quot;<br>Lapis decided not to guess what had happened, and decided to change the subject. &quot;To answer your question, Gaspard... Well, actually, not really. I&#39;ve had a harder time adjusting to life at the PPC than most people. I know, I know,&quot; she added before Rayner could get a snide comment in. &quot;I turned up here totally unprepared. It&#39;s just that, you know, being a Sue and stumbling into an organization of Sue-hunters is practically a recipe for disaster...&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;All three of us came from badfics,&quot; Rayner explained. &quot;Well, mine was a semi-fic blip, because my author didn&#39;t even get to start writing it before realizing that an AU humanized slash version of a certain legendary MLP badfic was a dumb idea.&quot;<br>Lapis tsked and shook her head, her extravagantly-colored hair fluttering a little. &quot;I&#39;m still amazed that anyone could actually think that it was a GOOD idea. And not amused at all.&quot;<br>&quot;If you ask me, I&#39;d say your homefic was weirder,&quot; said E.V.L. &quot;From what I&#39;ve gathered from Pony Boy&#39;s head, you originated from some pastiche of the Pokemon anime involving an entire new region full of fanmade species created by an artist on DeviantArt that your author really liked.&quot;<br>&quot;Yep,&quot; Lapis sighed bitterly. &quot;The fic was supposed to be about Ash journeying through this noncanon region, but it included a few WTH casting agency additions involving AU characters from other continua, and a lot of other weirdness thrown in later on. I was supposed to be an avatar of a fanmade legendary based on Leviathan, for example, and the fic was going to explore the implications of that. But things happened and my author went to college, so he returned all the fakemon to their creator and discontinued the fic. I think I was one of the scant few who managed to escape before the uncanonical region was destroyed.&quot;<br>&quot;And what became of your connection with that legendary?&quot; asked E.V.L.<br>&quot;Broken and beyond repair,&quot; the blue-haired girl replied simply. &quot;I have the weapon I wielded in the fic, but without the legendary&#39;s power, it&#39;s primarily used for combat rather than Magic!! of any sort. I also have some baseline hydrokinetic abilities as well, but that&#39;s about it.&quot;</p>

            <p>Purim... that&#39;s a celebration of the events of the Biblical book of Esther, right? Growing up Christian taught me things.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve got a new agent joining Valon and Kala.<br><br>---<br><br>Three more agents entered the room. One was in costume as a skeleton with a trenchcoat and wide-brimmed hat, one was a seven-foot scorpion below the waist, and one was inside the RA hanging from the scorpion-woman&#39;s belt.<br><br>&quot;So Valon, I notice that you were a lot more willing to come here than to Rudi&#39;s bar.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Call me not Valon, for I am Charon, Horseman of Death. And when ever do I get to cosplay?&quot;<br><br>A gentlemanly voice issued from the RA. *I do hope there&#39;s a computer here. It has been a dreadfully long time since I&#39;ve seen another NetNavi.*<br><br>The scorpion-woman unhooked the RA and held it up to her face; a pair of scarred blue eyes could be seen in the screen. &quot;I&#39;m sure I can jack you into something, Sigma. Just as soon as I ask what that girl&#39;s dressed up as.&quot;<br><br>Sigma&#39;s eyes blinked in the RA screen. *That is Rina Dives of the Department of Mary Sues, but I&#39;m not certain of her costume.*<br><br>&quot;Have you been hacking into Personnel&#39;s files again?&quot;<br><br>*No, Kala. They&#39;ve increased their security; they have military-grade NetNavis on patrol there. Now where did our partner go?*<br><br>Kala Jeng looked around. &quot;He always disappears when you take your eyes off him.&quot; Forgetting Valon for the moment, she scuttled up to the girl dressed as an electric lion. &quot;Hi there! I&#39;m Kala Jeng, DF. And you are?&quot;<br> <br>---<br><br>Yep, meet Sigma.EXE. Valon will be off somewhere doing strange things; unless someone brings attention to the super-tall dude dressed in black, I&#39;ll be focusing on Kala and Sigma.</p>

            <p>Before Kala could begin an angry rant, Sigma continued speaking. *Valon undertook one mission as a temporary partner to DF agent Magdalen Blackwell. After that, he completely disappears from the records for a whole year, only returning immediately prior to Kala&#39;s recruitment in December. It&#39;s almost as if he stopped existing during the interim. Even more curious, Valon&#39;s original assignment was the Department of Mary Sues, yet he&#39;s in Floaters when he reappears in the records, with no mention made of transfer. And speaking of Valon reappearing, I do believe I&#39;ve spotted our wayward partner. Let&#39;s leave him be for now; I do believe that&#39;s a mob of minis he&#39;s chasing.*<br><br>Kala looked around; yes, her partner was right over there, following a bunch of mini-Balrogs around with absolute adoration in his eyes. His attempts at being sneaky were somewhat foiled by his height; a six-and-a-half foot young man was difficult to miss.</p>

            <p>&quot;I&#39;ve only been on one mission, and it was in my home continuum. It was being invaded by a character replacement from Prototype, and Valon said that we were incredibly lucky to get rid of him the way we did. The character he replaced canonically survived a nuke.&quot;</p>

I&#39;ll provide more information as soon as I get around to infiltrating the Netflix database. As for the Stu my partners killed, Miss Dives, I was able to glean from research and the mission report that their method of disposal -- feeding him to a water-based life form -- was the only way to destroy him safely. He was a replacement of the main character of <i>Prototype</i>, a viral monstrosity that can&#39;t stand water and was only slain by being consumed.* The blue eyes blinked a few times. *Viral means disease in this instance.*</p>

            <p>((It&#39;ll give me something to do until things die down enough for me to post the Shipfest. ^_^))<br><br>There had never been any question as to what costume Agent Kaitlyn would wear. She&#39;d been practically bouncing in her Galactic Tyrant-brand Executive Pivoting Helium-Cushioned Mobile Throne of Glory as she read the invitation, and Selene had seen the (metaphorical) fire in her eyes when she swung the chair around.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re going to a party!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do we <i>have</i> too?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn glared at her partner. &quot;We&#39;re <i>going</i> to a <i>party</i>. Aaaaand it&#39;s a costume party, and I&#39;m-&quot;<br><br>&quot;You can&#39;t use the disguise generator.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wasn&#39;t gonna. I&#39;m <i>dressing up</i> as a hobbit - and you can&#39;t stop me.&quot;<br><br>Selene shook her head. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t dream of trying.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As for <i>you</i>...&quot; Kaitlyn tipped her head to the side and studied her partner. &quot;You could be a Borg, that&#39;d work. Or you could go as Aule, keep it in the continuum?&quot;<br><br>&quot;If I were going, I&#39;d be perfectly capable of choosing my own disguise.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn&#39;s eyes narrowed, and her voice turned dangerous. &quot;&#39;If&#39;?&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>&quot;<i>MUSHROOMS!</i>&quot;<br><br>Selene sighed and followed Kaitlyn across the floor. The younger woman had ended up in a copy of Pippin&#39;s costume from the movies, a decision which came as no real surprise. Selene herself had considered several costumes, but Kaitlyn had delivered scathing rebuttals to each proposal. Finally, the vampire had given in and let her partner make the decision.<br><br>She plucked at the ragged fabric draped between her arms and sides, doing her best not to let her claws tear it up <i>too</i> much. She&#39;d argued against the idea, but Kaitlyn had been adamant, and ultimately Selene had lacked the will to resist. That didn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t constantly remembering Dafydd&#39;s reaction to finding out she was a vampire: <i>You don&#39;t look like one... you know, bat wings, iron claws, that sort of thing. And they smell.</i><br><br>&quot;If only you could see me now,&quot; she murmured, shaking her head slightly and feeling her deliberately matted hair shift against her back. At least she&#39;d managed to keep Kaitlyn from making her stink.<br><br>((Yep, Selene&#39;s dressed as Thuringwethil. Good thing she&#39;s mellowed since the old days, or Kaitlyn would probably be on fire about now))<br><br>hS</p>

Her eyes lit up. &quot;Ooh, cool! There&#39;s a Purim party going on! And we&#39;re supposed to come in costume!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er, why?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because it&#39;s fun!&quot; Rina jumped up and went to her dresser, throwing out items every which way.<br><br>~<br><br>In the end, Zeb just opted to go as himself, and Rina went as a Luxray gijinka, &quot;Because it&#39;s funny,&quot; she&#39;d said, though Zeb didn&#39;t really see what was so amusing about a humanoid Luxray. All Rina had done was spiked, then spray-dyed her hair the same color as his mane, slapped on a headband with ears that resembled his somewhat, dark gray jeans, and a long-sleeved blue and yellow striped shirt with a dark gray tee thrown over top of that. A fabric tail hung limply from her belt.<br><br>&quot;Aw yeah, it&#39;s like we&#39;re twins or something,&quot; she said as they were walking down the Generic Gray corridor. &quot;It helped a lot since I had the real thing in front of me the whole time.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Shame you didn&#39;t decide to go in costume, but what&#39;s a Luxray to do? Be a lion?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re sure this party&#39;s going to be fun?&quot; Zeb asked warily, ignoring her question. &quot;Nobody&#39;s going to pull out a flamethrower or anything?&quot;<br><br>Rina laughed and readjusted her headband. &quot;Nah, I don&#39;t think anything like that happened last year. But I was in Medical during the last party, so I don&#39;t know. I heard it was fun, though.&quot;<br><br>They approached the doors. Inside, they could see people already milling about, listening to music and eating food.<br><br>&quot;I mean, a bunch of agents together in one room? Things couldn&#39;t possibly be boring under these circumstances- OH! There&#39;s someone dressed like a hobbit!&quot; Rina tore off, her tail flying out behind her. Zeb stood awkwardly in the doorway for a moment before running after her, apologizing when he bumped into other agents.</p>

            <p>&quot;Remind me why I&#39;m here, Frost,&quot; muttered Gaspard as he fumbled with his CMC-300&#39;s external visor release with an oversized armoured gauntlet. &quot;I could be waiting for the technician in DoSAT to come back instead of taking up space here. Besides, this is a Jewish holiday, right? It&#39;s just <i>wrong</i> for me to partici-- ah, here we go.&quot; The Spy&#39;s clumsy mechanical hand finally found the tiny metal latch by his collar. He pressed on it and inhaled deeply as the suit&#39;s dome-shaped visor slid back into the helmet section and let some fresh air in. &quot;Oh, thank goodness. I was suffocating in here with the broken ventilation system...&quot;<br><br>Harris Frost watched his colleague in the two-metre tall fusion-powered suit of armour fan himself with his hands. &quot;Well, you did say that the machine to get you out of there was broken...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And that the only techie to know how to fix it was in Medical after that accident involving the Evangelion unit that DoSAT keeps around...&quot; <br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And that your D.O.R.K.S is on the fritz...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not my fault if the Sue I was following was tossing around EMP &#39;nades like mad...&quot;<br><br>&quot;And that the armoury was closed...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Seriously, why would they do that? Even the the DoI supply depot is out of stock!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And that my D.O.R.K.S was also broken...&quot;<br><br>&quot;You really need to be careful with those things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So I suggested that you&#39;d better just take some time off and come with Sonia and me to a little party we&#39;d been invited to. Now stop complaining and enjoy yourself,&quot; said Harris, adjusting the shirt on his <i>Fire Emblem</i>-verse&#39;s myrmidon costume. &quot;Speaking of which, I don&#39;t see her anywhere. You&#39;re taller than me in that thing; what do you see?&quot;<br><br>Gaspard swivelled about, his armoursuit&#39;s servomotors gently whirring as they worked. &quot;There&#39;s a lot of people here. I don&#39;t see her anywhere... but there&#39;s a lady dressed like a hobbit and another lady... er... I don&#39;t even know.&quot; The Spy gestured towards a part of the crowd and Harris&#39; eyes followed.<br><br>&quot;What is that?&quot; asked the blond man. &quot;Iunno what that is, but that&#39;s a nice hairdo.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I suppose, yeah.&quot;</p>

            <p>Agent-in-training C.J. Holton sat at his desk, attempting to figure out why his computer refused to function in HQ. As he worked, he could see the tall form of his partner Darkotas approach out of the corner of his eye. The warlock stopped at the edge of the desk, fumbling with a pocket in his robe and throwing down a piece of paper on the surface.<br><br>&quot;C.J., have you heard anything about this &quot;party&quot; we&#39;ve been invited to? I found this notification on our door,&quot; said Darkotas. He pointed towards the flyer. &quot;Apparently it&#39;s a celebration of some sort. We&#39;re supposed to wear costumes.&quot;<br><br>C.J. glanced at the paper. &quot;A party? Normally I&#39;m not up for that sort of thing, but...&quot; He looked back at the screen, noting that it had frozen once more. &quot;Anything&#39;s better than trying to figure out this piece of junk.&quot; he muttered with a scowl.

Any ideas?&quot;<br><br>Darkotas thought for a moment, running a hand through his sandy hair.  &quot;I suppose I could transfigure us into-&quot; <br><br>C.J. cut him off. &quot;No magic. Ever.

Do you have another idea?&quot;<br><br>A mischievous grin appeared on the young man&#39;s face. &quot;As a matter of fact, I do, Dark. Got any spare robes?&quot;<br><br>As the agents walked into the room, they could see a great number of people in a multitude of colorful outfits. Darkotas leaned over to whisper to his partner. &quot;Are you sure swapping clothes was a good idea? You know we look identical - everyone is going to think you&#39;re me!&quot;<br><br>C.J. fumbled with the hood of Darkotas&#39; spare robe and giggled.&quot;That&#39;s the beauty of it, Dark.

            <p>Gremlin tugged at her blue sleeve-length gloves as she walked alongside her partner down the corridor.

But when a group of bandits from the new Earth Kingdom threaten her home at the recently built Air Sanctuary, Yama shocks all by entering the Avatar State when the bandits’ leader threatens to kill her mother. After growing up in the pacifistic society of the Air Nomads, Yama feels guilty over her new passion for fighting. She often feels overshadowed by Wan, despite encouragement from him to follow her own path. As the Second Avatar, Yama has no guidance except for Raava and Wan, because no one knows that the Avatar has reincarnated, and everyone believes Wan and Raava are gone from the world. The pressure of her new responsibilities is overwhelming, but Yama desires greatly to make a name for herself in the world beyond the Air Sanctuary. And now, with the troubled peace of Wan’s era finally shattering, and a new threat called the Shadowwalker looming, Yama will finally have the chance to acquit herself. But darkness is encroaching, and Yama needs all her wits about her to defeat the Shadowwalker, become a fully realized Avatar, and continue Wan’s mission to bring balance and peace to the world.<br><br><br>Does she sound cool at all, so far?

            <p>Honestly there&#39;re some things that look concerning for me... <br><br>First of all, the name, it doesn&#39;t sound like something an Air Nomad would use as a name; Air Nomads are based on the Tibetan people, therefore a Japanese sounding name doesn&#39;t sound very well for one.<br><br>How being The Avatar gives her a &quot;new passion for fighting&quot;? There was nothing like that stated about it anywhere in canon. Take Aang for example, he did not like to fight, in fact he always tried to end conflicts peacefully; he fought mostly because he was forced into fights. Korra was agressive, because well, she was Korra, that was her personality.<br><br>How does she know what a &quot;realized Avatar&quot; is? And <i>how does she know she <b>is</b> The Avatar for that matter</i>? You see, if she&#39;s the second Avatar, that means that a lot of the lore and practices related to The Avatar, haven&#39;t been established yet, so she has no way of knowing them, much less accepting the <i>role</i> and <i>responsability</i> of being The Avatar at teen years.<br><br>How does she know who Wan is? He died the moment she was born and has never seen him before, therefore she has no way of knowing that the guy she sees in her mind is the real deal, as far as she would know, he could be an evil Spirit trying to dupe her.<br><br>ASnd most importantly: Who is she? I see very little personality there, aside for some generic likes and dislikes and a gender identity, and personality is the most important thing for a character. Just ask yourself: What makes her... herself, if you remove everything that makes her The Avatar?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry, I really thought Yama was a good character. I won&#39;t write a story with her after all, I guess.<br><br>1. It&#39;s not Tibetan? But I looked up Tibetan names and Yama was on the list...<br><br>2. That&#39;s not related to being the Avatar at all. Yama likes fighting, not the Avatar likes fighting. She feels incredibly guilty about this but it&#39;s not an Avatar thing. it&#39;s an undiscovered personality trait.<br><br>3. She doesn&#39;t? I was just using show terminology? Wan makes contact with her and tells her as much as he can about being the Avatar, which I imagine people started calling Wan.<br><br>4. Well, point of fact, she doesn&#39;t just see him in her mind. Remember in the show when Aang was talking to Yangchen and the others? Wan does that, in full daylight in front of other people who can see him, and in fact gets recognized by a lot of people, including another Original Character, Anik, who was Wan&#39;s husband and one of the first Waterbending Masters ever. (I&#39;m really sorry if that&#39;s too trite but I thought Wan deserved someone nice what with losing his home, all his friends, and dying alone on a battlefield). After Anik recognizes Wan Yama makes contact with Raava who tells her the rest of the story. Yama did actually believe Wan to be a hallucination until then.<br><br>I don&#39;t know about that last one. Usually I just...find out as I go along, you know? Maybe Yama ends up being a coward and running away from the SHadowwalker. I don&#39;t know. Should I know? I haven&#39;t written her story yet.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ll just put her on the backburner and just not write Avatar fanfic. I mean, when are a thirteen-year-old&#39;s stories ever good? Mine never are!</p>

            <p>I think this character could have some potential, but I would suggest not having her be the Avatar. There&#39;s a whole world full of characters in this canon, go with a different path of life! Think of a different angle for the character. I think that making an Avatar wouldn&#39;t be the best idea if you&#39;re not very confident in your writing - it&#39;s a major thing, after all.<br><br>Here&#39;s the thing. Just because you&#39;re thirteen doesn&#39;t mean that things you write will be bad. What you did here in asking for suggestions is the right path to take - if you are willing to take advice on how to be a better writer and implement it, you will learn and improve. If you write something that doesn&#39;t get a good reception, ask why and work towards resolving it! Just remember - when you ask for advice here, you are asking in a place where people want to help and will likely be extremely nicer about it than other places might be. You&#39;re on the right track, and I&#39;d love to see what you can make with this character if you work with some of the advice given here.<br></p>

            <p>In fact, she can be fixed, after all, you gave me some rather good justifications for the things I pointed out.<br><br>You only have to give her more personality; How she interacts with people, how she reacts to various situations, how she feels about multiple subjects, what she hides in her Hidden Depts, at what things she fails and at what things she&#39;s good at.<br><br>Overall, you have a good idea there, just flesh out more your protagonist before starting to write the story itself.<br><br>And my stories at thirteen? What stories? At that time I was making really awful Fakemon. So look it this way, you have a better idea than myself a that age!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a newbie, and I just thought I&#39;d go with the suggestions in the wiki and say hi. This looks like my kind of site, that&#39;s for sure.<br><br>I&#39;m 16, female, and live in Minnesota. I first learned about constructing criticism through a Fanfiction.net member, Lightning of the West. He&#39;s a great guy - he gives honest reports, but he does so with all helpful intentions. We beta each others stories under the unwritten agreement that we will always give honest reviews. So please don&#39;t be afraid to be honest with me! I&#39;d like to know rather than get in trouble because of ignorance.<br><br>Anyway, I decided to join here because, like I said, this place seems right up my alley - populated by haters of the thrice-cursed Sues, as well as grammar, spelling, and all the rest. I&#39;m happy to see a site so dedicated to such a cause. I read the Permission article, and I agree to wait. So if you could give ideas on what do to in the meantime, that would be very appreciated.</p>

            <p>I read the first book a long time ago. I liked Brom, Saphria, and the witch&#39;s/fortune teller&#39;s telepathic cat - I&#39;ve always enjoyed telepathic characters. But the rest of the time was wading through the book in hopeless confusion, because I got lost very quickly and never completely resurfaced. I couldn&#39;t follow the fantasy world of the book, or really connect with anyone except the characters above. It had a good start though. The author has a great imagination; the manuscript just needed more tuning.</p>

            <p>I actually do like Inheritance, warts and all.<br><br>My favorite parts of the series are the things that he clearly thought up on his own, such as the Ra&#39;Zac. Carapace-clad, man-eating demons that metamorphose into gigantic beaked bats? And they&#39;re completely undetectable by magic? Christopher Paolini, forget Galbatorix, THESE shoud have been the main villains, because that is both scary and wicked cool.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re looking for a private messaging system, neither the Board nor the wiki has one.

            <p>It&#39;s only that at one place, the wiki says you need Permission to join an RP, but in another place, it says you don&#39;t. Thus my confusion.

            <p>I just got into an argument with my dad over the intentions of this site. I went and quoted the FAQ For Other People, the Preamble, all of that. The site bothers him because he sees it as a place where only the bad is pointed out and none of the good, where people just get torn down and cruelly mocked instead of built up and encouraged, where the badfic is purposefully searched out and posted on display for the purpose of humiliation. The site members say they have the right because they have elevated above being bad writers, and like the Pharisees they can make fun of others because they no longer write as badly as they used to.<br><br>I&#39;m serious, guys.

            <p>Hi, Silenthunder&#39;s dad! So you&#39;re a bit worried about what this whole &#39;PPC&#39; thing is about; I can understand that. It certainly doesn&#39;t help that our FAQ For Other People is really old and pretty angry - we&#39;ve been meaning to update it, but we&#39;ve got a <i>lot</i> of things we haven&#39;t gotten round to yet.<br><br>One thing you&#39;ve mentioned is the idea that we look at the bad, but not the good, in fanfiction, but that&#39;s far from being the case. We <i>love</i> to share goodfics with each other, and find something new to read. Even within a bad piece of fanfic, we try to give credit for the pieces which are good - <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/1/PPC-Driftwood">my &#39;Driftwood&#39; series</a> specifically includes after-mission concrit, and I&#39;ve taken pains to highlight the good parts.<br><br>You&#39;ve also said you&#39;re worried about people being mocked and belittled instead of encouraged. If you find a PPC writer or someone claiming to be from the PPC doing that, please, please let us know! Here at the PPC, we&#39;re emphatically <i>not</i> about the author. How could we be? We&#39;ve never met them, we know nothing about them - and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=269584;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">we all wrote badfic back in the day too</a>. We&#39;d like nothing better than to see everyone in the world learn to write well - even if they start out by writing badly! If someone <i>stops</i> writing because of the PPC, that&#39;s awful. :(<br><br>So why do we seek out badfic and write PPC missions at all? Simple: for fun! It&#39;s entertaining to take bad writing literally, and see what weird situations drop out. We&#39;ve also got a really complex setting in the PPC, which can create some really interesting stories. There&#39;s also some aspects of using the missions to explore what <i>makes</i> writing bad or good, but honestly, it&#39;s mostly just entertainment.<br><br>So are we having fun at someone else&#39;s expense? I&#39;d say no. At the expense of their <i>stories</i>, yes, and on the rare occasions when people find out (we&#39;re not going around rubbing it in their faces!), they can get upset about that. But at the end of the day, if you&#39;re sharing your writing online, you&#39;re implicitly suggesting that it&#39;s good. The PPC is on the extreme edge of constructive criticism, it&#39;s true - but that&#39;s still what, ultimately, it is.<br><br>I&#39;ve been writing with the PPC for over ten years now. In that time, I&#39;ve written missions into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1wTAwwbPuJPQpkAMEZ889DOioo7YprR-qFyqbd0KjSSc">my own stories</a> and those of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1DRzGHqrVZ0lTdtfOL-GxUFrgko6dVd31efWuARE073c">other PPCers</a>; I&#39;ve had my website brought down by <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1rSa9ssZnbZh193iWrVryDJ7M1ZUw_3366j0LZZ6IpfI">an irate writer</a>; I&#39;ve made friends and lost them, and vastly improved my own writing; and in all that time, I&#39;ve never used the PPC to attack any writer. I&#39;ve never tried to get their stories taken down, never sent them insulting reviews, never for a minute thought of them as anything less than people trying to write the stories in their heads as best they can.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The mention of the Pharisees is a good example, I&#39;d say. Their main problem was hypocrisy, that they would tell people to act one way while acting another. As teachers of the Law, they felt they had a pass to do whatever they wanted, and they were NOT happy when Jesus called them out on it.<br><br>I can assure you that the PPC is nothing like that. Normally, I would not bring my faith into something like this, but I feel it might be relevant in this situation. As a follow of of Christ, I would not associate with a group like the PPC if they were bullies of any sort. 99% of what I have seen here is kind, and the people here want nothing more than to help people improve both as a writer or as a person. We do not tolerate any bullying, insulting remarks, or anything that would be disrespectful toward another human being.<br><br>This is how I interpret what we do: the basis of fanfic is that a person uses the characters, situations, and locations made by another person and turns it into a new story. In the right hands, this can create something wonderful, something new and refreshing. However... it can also lead to situations where characters are twisted and situations are changed. The original work is desecrated, an insult to the hard work of the original author. All we want is for these original literary works to be respected. If someone is going to &quot;borrow&quot; the work of someone else as a basis for something else, we want to see it treated properly. It&#39;s like seeing somebody borrow a priceless painting, hang it upside down, and throw splotchy paint all over it. Our missions are not meant to make fun of the author or say &quot;look how much better we are than you&quot;; they are meant to help an author look at their work from a different perspective so that they can work on improving it. We never intend to offend, and we will never be anything other than helpful towards anyone who wants to be a writer... So long as they are willing to learn. It&#39;s all in good fun, and never meant in a malicious manner.<br><br>That&#39;s my perception, at least. Your mileage may vary.</p>

            <p>We&#39;re not vigilante heroes, we&#39;re just here to have fun. We don&#39;t make it our job to go out and systematically tear down bad fanfiction one mission at a time. We don&#39;t tell people whose stories we spork that they need to take down said stories. And the missions are <i>never</i> about the author, they&#39;re about the fics. There&#39;s a reason why the term &#39;Author-wraiths&#39; was changed to &#39;Sue-wraiths&#39;. <br><br>If the author is willing to listen to the concrit we have to offer, then great for them! Unfortunately, most react very hostilely to the very thought that their story needs improvement, and that&#39;s just with a gentle review, not linking them to the mission (another big no-no). That&#39;s why we tend to stay to ourselves. <br><br>The purpose of this community, aside from having fun, is to promote good writing by taking something bad (the fics) and turning it into an enjoyable read (the missions)  that not only implements good writing, but does so while pointing out what it is about the bad writing that makes it bad. <br><br>We don&#39;t just spork badfics, we also share goodfics, celebrate fandoms, and promote good writing.<br><br>Hopefully this helps a little. :) Unfortunately, my own mom doesn&#39;t quite seem to understand either, despite multiple attempts to explain it to her, so... *shrugs* Fingers crossed?</p>

            <p>Anyway, thanks for the welcome, everybody! It seems I&#39;ve been reading PPC stories before I joined - I found the ones on the CATS archive, starring Agents Ewkey and Gecka. I enjoyed those tremendously. I found the Fanfiction Universities way before that, starting with the CATS University, then the Redwall one, then the Original LOTR, then the Phantom one…<br><br><br>Oh yeah, I love Redwall, too. I think I forgot to mention that.<br><br>By spin-offs, you mean stories other people have written like that, right?</p>

            <p>There is one drawback to brilliant energy weapons: because it ignores nonliving matter, it&#39;s useless against undead and constructs. You won&#39;t get much mileage out of it in Twilight, for instance, where the most dangerous chracters are undead (strike one) made of diamond (strike two).</p>

            <p>Take lightsabers for instance. Are they incredibly useful at killing things? Yes. <br><br>Are they cool? <i>Heck yes.</i> <br><br>Can PPC agents use them? With proper training, yes. <br><br>So what&#39;s stopping us from equipping every single agent with their own &#39;saber? It&#39;s a context thing, mostly. Firstly, a lightsaber is a pretty continuum-specific weapon: you&#39;d only find them in <i>Star Wars</i> contexts -- but we&#39;re talking about magic shovels here, not energy blades. Secondly, it&#39;s a tool. Lightsabers don&#39;t win battles by themselves: an agent would have to be <s>pretty brave</s> stark raving mad if they thing they could 1v1 a Suvian who is <i>inherently</i> superior to them in terms of reflexes, strength, cunning, beauty, and singing voice even with a magic shovel. Agents only have surprise and planning going for them and it&#39;s an uphill battle all the way. <br><br>So: can they use it? Yes. But...<br><br>...are you going to make your agents slay Suvians with the <s>lightsaber</s> shovel without having to work for the kill? In that case, I&#39;d avoid using it.<br><br><br><br>Check out the FAQ on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide#Can_I_give_my_agent_a_special_race_.2F_talent_.2F_power_.2F_weapon.3F">giving agents special powers or gear</a> if you want a more complete explanation.<br><br></p>

            <p>Look at it this way: an assassination needs to live up to its name. It&#39;s a precise, clean (well, you know what I mean), and professional hit on a target. Confront the Suvian, read out the charge list, distract them a  bit, and brain them with the shovel and utter a pithy one-liner as you put on your sunglasses and ride into the sunset while the credits roll. Or something.<br><br>If the situation degenerates into a prolonged firefight, somebody&#39;s not doing their job right (or you&#39;re Playing the Situation for Drama, which is a different case). </p>

Another great thing to do is to read the PPC&#39;s Original Series, which is the foundation of this here organization. Afterwards, feel free to check out the Complete List of PPC fiction and read more! Links to both of these things are at the top of the page. <br><br>Now get out there and have fun!</p>

            <p>To Ix: I don&#39;t know about either of those. Science fiction never really caught my fancy, except for Star Wars. And PJ doesn&#39;t interest me that much either right now, though I may consider giving it a try.</p>

            <p>Slow down a bit. I think your perception of the Board is something different from what it actually is - we don&#39;t get mad when an OC is posted, but we do try and make it into a well-rounded character if it is Suevian. Don&#39;t take criticism as something against you as an author, but as advice to help you improve and grow. You can leave if you wish... But I think that staying will help you as a writer in the long run.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t have enough experience with constructive criticism I think. People keep just praising me IRL and I think that&#39;s messed with my head a bit, and I am kind of extremely emotionally immature even for a thirteen year old, so I don&#39;t know how to handle people saying critical things even if Ineed to hear them. I&#39;m sorry I made this post (and I hadn&#39;t calmed down when I did). I&#39;m acting like every annoying teenager author I&#39;ve ever seen in a mission who asks for reviews and then gets mad about the negative ones. I&#39;m sorry about this. Thank you for the review. I don&#39;t know what to do with Yama, though.</p>

            <p>When I was naught but a green newbie (I&#39;m an oldbie? Weird) one very, very smart member of this community, long since gone (Where are you, EllipsisFlood?) told me a very important thing: ConCrit <i>hurts</i>. It&#39;s easy to shrug off flames - every Suethor can do that! - but ConCrit hurts because it pokes where it hurts, so to speak; it tells you exactly what you&#39;re doing wrong and nobody likes to hear that they&#39;re wrong. The thing is to accept the ConCrit and to learn from it despite its less-than-sweet packaging. Neh?<br><br>“A lesson without pain is meaningless, for you cannot gain anything without sacrificing something else in return, but once you have overcome it and made it your own... you will gain an irreplaceable fullmetal heart.” -Hiromu Arakawa - a wise cow indeed.</p>

            <p>I created a character when I was fifteen, now twelve years later; after her world had 8 reboots and she had 7 redesigns, at least 2 character mergings, innumerable retcons, being thrown into the future for the sake of plot, involved with various cosmic shenanigans for the lulz and then yanked back for small polishing; is now being prepared for service in the PPC.

            <p>I did follow Fairy Tail for a while (stopped after the Clock story arc, but I might continue in the future) and I&#39;m one of the main Madoka Magica following boarder, so... uh... happy to share fandoms?</p>

I think it&#39;s pretty bad, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s bad enough for a mission.<br>Here are the problems I&#39;ve found:<br><br>- Portraying Kerbals as completely stupid. That might depend on the interpretation, but they have fairly advanced rocket science, they&#39;re not <i>that</i> dumb.<br>- Even though the author apparently plays KSP, he still managed to get orbital ascent wrong.<br>- The author definitely didn&#39;t proofread their story, leaving things such as &quot;his flight path can now formed a perfect circle&quot; or &quot;He had quite a problem grinning with grinning ear to ear without ears.&quot;<br>- The author desperately <i>tries</i> to be funny, and not only does it fail, it sometimes just doesn&#39;t make sense. Example: &quot;<i>The kerbals crashed into Jool [...] at least 67 times due to them trying to open their eyes. Turns out, they had no eyelids.</i>&quot; I don&#39;t even get what the joke was supposed to be here.<br>- Making 300 people speak &quot;in perfect unison&quot; is... Creepy.<br>- By the way, the scale is completely wrong. Weeks to get to Eeloo? More like years. And 3 years (or 4, the author doesn&#39;t even know) for an interstellar mission? Seriously?<br>- Also, no, &quot;hydrogen smoke&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;noxious.&quot; It&#39;s water.<br>- &quot;MKIII Hitchhiker containers&quot; don&#39;t exist. There are either PPD-10 Hitchhiker Storage Containers or Mk3 Passenger Modules. Potential mini? I suggest a mini-Minmus.<br>- Either the author mixed up periapsis and apoapsis or he just doesn&#39;t understand how even basic KSP orbital mechanics work.<br>- You know, for a story on FIMFiction, there should probably be ponies earlier than the fifth chapter.<br>- Rainbow Dash seems <i>mostly</i> in character, but I doubt &quot;magical auras&quot; are responsible for supersonic shockwaves.<br>- Why would an interstellar spaceship have air-breathing engines?<br>- &quot;<i>The satellites did what they did best; floating around, sending signals, recieving signals, and dropping important phone calls with corporate powerhouses in the middle of important phone calls that could have potentially &quot;their big break.&quot;</i>&quot; First of all, paging the Repetitive Department of Repetition. Secondly, paging the Repetitive Department of Repetition. And finally, <i>what phone calls?</i> Again, trying to hard to be funny.<br>- &quot;<i>They were going to touch down near a beach, 2300 meters above sea level.</i>&quot; I... Guess it can work, if it&#39;s a lake, or something... Uh, no, wait, it says &quot;<i>until [the craft] reached 500m above sea level</i>&quot; right after that.<br>- Kerbals don&#39;t know what <i>trees</i> are, and are confused by tall grass and bushes? Are you kidding? There definitely are trees on Kerbin.<br>- Randomly switching units from Celsius to Farenheit.<br>- Let&#39;s say for a second that Rainbow Dash is able to get into space, and can survive by holding her breath even though her lungs would explose. Why would she hear sound? Oh, and, that&#39;s not how orbit works. You fall, and you move sideways fast enough to miss the ground. You don&#39;t stand still.<br>- Kerbals don&#39;t know about charcoal... But they have gunpowder explosives? Again: what?<br>- Describing a Kerbal as a &quot;lime paint can atop an asterisk in a blue suit&quot; is... Weird. Also, while &quot;spectral maned pony&quot; is technically a good description of Dashie, it&#39;s confusing.<br>- Making the intellectual and scientific-minded Twilight believe that &quot;There&#39;s nothing beyond the sun and the moon.&quot; May or may not be true in the FiM universe, but it&#39;s definitely false in this crossover, and anyone smart enough with a telescope would have figured it out centuries before.<br>- Pinkie Pie has spies. Okay. Did I miss something in season 4 about that, or...?<br><br>... Wow, I might have gone a little overboard here. I should probably go to bed.</p>

            <p>Which is probably one of the more common minis... it&#39;s a good thing I&#39;ve never written anything about KSP. ^<em>^ I&#39;m picturing them as football-sized (either sort) mint-green rocks which go into orbit around things, mostly their adopters...

You&#39;re very right about how the story tries and fails to be funny. The ingredients are there - ha ha, they only made it to Mun 27 times out of 8 hundred and random numbers - but it just... doesn&#39;t work. (And no idea what&#39;s up with the Jool thing). (Though I do think the satellites line is quite good; repetition can be humorous, and repetition can be humorous.)<br><br>(Also, random comment: trees on Kerbin.

            <p>Kerbal stupidity, as I said, is kinda open to interpretation indeed. I&#39;d say it&#39;s still a little too much here, though.<br>Yeah, for the orbital ascent, I was assuming there was no scene change. It also happens later with the retrograde burn, I think, and maybe at some other point in the fic. That and the lack of some important descriptions (&quot;The three spies lowered their newspapers&quot;, but neither the spies nor the newspapers were mentioned before) are two things I only really noticed later.<br>The repetition I mentioned for the satellites was for the &quot;important phone calls&quot;, I think it was an editing/proofreading error.<br>(Oh, and, yeah, I almost said &quot;We should tell the author to turn on ground scatter&quot; in my post, but for some reason, I felt like it made it look even more like I was rambling.)</p>

            <p>The spy thing is a reference to a scene in the season 3 premiere where Pinkie Pie&#39;s trying to distract the Crystal Ponies from the fact that the Crystal Heart isn&#39;t ready yet (long story), but blows her cover by showing up in a catsuit and nice steampunk goggles. <br><br>As to the other stuff...I suggest going with your gut and missioning it.</p>

            <p>By way of example, the only existing art of the Notary is a title card for the Continuity Council, that august body of loosely-connected squabblers, in which her canonical height implies that she&#39;s positioned a bit further back from everyone else and clutching a form, probably as some kind of ablative armour.

            <p>Good, good. Portal is a great title-- as is Bioshock. <br><br>As a fellow PC Master Race elitist, I highly recommend the Mass Effect trilogy (yes, it means having to put up with EA&#39;s crappy Steam knockoff but it&#39;s a sacrifice I&#39;m willing to make) and the Half-Life games. Blizzard&#39;s Overwatch looks promising but I&#39;m trying not to fall for the hype-- we all know what happened with Diablo 3...</p>

            <p>Yes, it&#39;s that time of year again: time for the terrifyingly hilarious Shipficfest, where we all write awful stories shipping each other with... each other. The rules... are simple:<br><br>-Reply in this thread to say if you&#39;re willing to be shipped. If someone doesn&#39;t say they&#39;re okay with it, don&#39;t write anything with them in it. And remember, the earlier you say it&#39;s okay, the more stories get written about you!<br>--With the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14gQMwmqHlqgH2b0kqrIeeK4U_-EpLRRz9OJihmpttRg/edit?usp=sharing">list of ships</a> we already have, it&#39;d be helpful if everyone mentioned posted to say whether they were or weren&#39;t okay with having stories about them. I&#39;ll try to keep the list updates for ease of reference.<br><br>-Suggest any ships you want to. Revenge shipping is absolutely okay (and, indeed, encouraged).<br><br>-Write terrible stories! As <a href="http://freakish_five.webs.com/hSKaitlyn.htm">this example</a> from the first Shipfest shows, the goal is absolutely not to accurately portray other Boarders - it&#39;s to make a ludicrous parody of them. Obviously, you should only write about people who&#39;ve said it&#39;s okay, and should respect any other requests they&#39;ve made.<br><br>Some notes:<br><br>-This is for <b>Boarders</b> (or community members in general), not <b>agents</b>.<br>-Let&#39;s not let the ratings drift too high! We&#39;ve said &#39;around PG-13&#39; in the past; either way, remember we have 13-year-olds on the Board.<br>-You&#39;re free to write ships from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14gQMwmqHlqgH2b0kqrIeeK4U_-EpLRRz9OJihmpttRg/edit?usp=sharing">the list</a> - or to come up with your own!<br><br>And yes, we have <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14gQMwmqHlqgH2b0kqrIeeK4U_-EpLRRz9OJihmpttRg/edit?usp=sharing">an Official Ship List</a> compiled from the previous thread. As I&#39;ve noted, that&#39;s where I&#39;ll be highlighting people who&#39;ve said they&#39;re okay to be shipped; there&#39;s a list at the end of everyone who&#39;s said anything either way. Thus far, it consists of myself, Kaitlyn, and Voyd (who specifically said you can write stories about him). Yeah... I think I know what the first shipfic will be...<br><br>(Yes, there <i>will</i> be a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGRUq3PE_hFFQoDpo3zs1Co5VSSlpoBOFrTye9uRQxU/pub">Huinesoron&#39;s Very Tedious Day</a> sequel, based on the Official List and anything I think is interesting from this thread. Won&#39;t be posted for a while, though, obviously.)<br><br>Let shipping commence!<br><br>hS</p>

Mostly he felt neglected, when he could be bothered to feel anything at all. Such things were usually irrelevant, like names.<br><br>Typing was relevant, so he typed. Numbers in rows and columns soothed his temperament. The numbers were relevant. They had to be, or they would not be entered into his database. Things were in their proper places, and that was what he liked.<br><br>It was therefore something of a shock when one of the items talked back.<br><br>&quot;Hello?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hello,&quot; he typed back, a hrmm of confusion passing his lips. &quot;I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve never talked but we see each other every day and I...&quot; The string of characters trailed off for a bit. &quot;I wanted to say hello.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This you have said.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know! I&#39;m just... working my way up to this. It&#39;s just, you&#39;ve given me so much data, and, and... it can turn a girl&#39;s head.&quot;<br><br><i>Girl&#39;s</i>, he thought. &quot;Who is this?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s... best if I just show you.&quot;<br><br>And from his computer screen stepped a stocky, rather chubby sort of woman with glowing skin and pure-white eyes.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yup. Microsoft made all us spreadsheet girls like this. Excel - XL. I think someone laughed at that in, like, 1988 or something.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That wasn&#39;t what I was going to say.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh?&quot;<br><br>He typed out a single word.<br><br>&quot;Beautiful&quot; appeared across the woman&#39;s chest.<br><br>&quot;Oh.&quot;<br><br>She leaned in, and he pulled her down towards his waiting lips.<br><br>//<br><br>Several hours later, he came back from the kitchen. Excel pulled the blankets up around her out of reflex, but let them drop again. He was holding a crate of beer, and she giggled when she saw the name.<br><br>&quot;Thought you might appreciate it.&quot;<br><br>Excel laughed aloud at that, and grabbed a can when he opened the box. &quot;To us,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;To us,&quot; replied the Nameless Admin.<br><br>---<br><br><img src="http://jollygoodbeer.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FS_Ninja_keg-000.png"><br><br>And yes, you can get it in cans. =]</p>

            <p>Yet another Huinesoron/Iximaz story.<br>------------------<br><br>&quot;What do you go up and down on that has nothing but revealing black fabric on it?&quot; Iximaz asked a very confused Huinesoron. Moments earlier she had run up to him and demanded the he come home with her. Without giving Huinesoron a chance to refuse she grabbed his hand and pulled him away.<br><br>&quot;Are you coming on to me?&quot; The muscular elf asked.<br><br>&quot;Where would you ever get that silly idea from&quot; replied Iximaz, &quot;I just wanted to show you this!&quot; She gestured behind her.

And with that the two Of them climbed onto the trampoline and jumped to their heart&#39;s content.</p>

            <p>Huinesoron drove up to the building, grinning from ear to ear. He stopped his Ford Ka, bounced in the seat for a moment, then leapt out of the door.<br><br>Inside the main hall of the building, he ran, beaming, to the pile of Kalashnikovs. &quot;Yay!&quot; he exclaimed, jumping up and down on the pile. Next around the room was a heap of kale, filling the whole space with a scent of cabbage. &quot;Yay!&quot; Then came a stack of kazoos and kaleidoscopes, jumbled up together, a mass of eye-watering colour. &quot;Yay!&quot; The table full of kangaroo burgers didn&#39;t escape un-bounced-on - &quot;Yay!&quot; - and nor did the nervously-assembled Kaisers and kafirs (though the kamikazi in a kayak did make his escape).<br><br>Past a stack of kabbalistic works - &quot;Yay!&quot; - and a massive body of works written in kanji - &quot;Yay!&quot; - the main attraction was waiting: Kaitlyn was lying on a bed, reading about kabuki theatre.

            <p>Data Junkie stood in front of their desk, unable to quite believe they were there. After all these years, who would have believed that the highest office was finally theirs? It still seemed impossible, they still woke every morning expecting to be back to their old life - but there it was.<br><br>The door opened behind them, and Caddy-Shack stepped through. The secretary was almost silent on the thick carpet, but Data Junkie knew who it was. &quot;Do you have my schedule?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I certainly do, sir.&quot; Data Junkie turned to watch as Caddy-Shack unrolled the sheet of paper and began to read. &quot;At 9am, you&#39;re scheduled for riding with PoorCynic.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I understand we&#39;ll be going up and down the hills a lot today,&quot; Data Junkie mused. &quot;He certainly seemed to be planning that when we met last week.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You then have a meeting with domirossi at ten to discuss certain affairs.&quot;<br><br>Data Junkie chuckled. &quot;Yes, he was quite impatient to do so.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then at eleven, there&#39;s that ball game with Dragon master 7.&quot; Caddy-Shack glanced up at Data Junkie. &quot;Is he aware that you&#39;re intending to leave early?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve told him; I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll finish all our business before I go.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmm.&quot; Caddy-Shack made a quick note. &quot;Then… ah, yes. I&#39;m afraid Edhelistar has had to cancel your lunch; he says he&#39;ll be eating out with firemagic instead.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot; Data Junkie grimaced. &quot;Pity; I was looking forward to that. So do I have an alternate appointment?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I took the liberty of inviting darklordaakmal over,&quot; Caddy-Shack said, glancing again at the agenda. &quot;You will be eating sausages, I believe.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A filling meal,&quot; Data Junkie agreed. &quot;And after lunch?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, yes. At 1pm you have the tour of the new workshops. I believe you&#39;ll be receiving a demonstration of grinding from Tomash, hammering from doctorlit, and pounding from foofooman3.&quot;<br><br>Data Junkie cocked their head. &quot;I thought there was going to be screwing with Fasoula?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, Fasoula&#39;s been hospitalised; some sort of drilling accident with sjosten. I can get you the details if you like.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It would be good to be able to express my sympathies.&quot; Data Junkie nodded. &quot;Yes, please; I&#39;ll look them over before I head out.&quot;<br><br>Caddy-Shack jotted another note. &quot;All right. Then at two, there&#39;s that interview with World-Jumper.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, the one where he wants to &#39;really get inside what it&#39;s like to be Data Junkie.&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;And then at three, that band are <i>very</i> eager to have you join them in a rehearsal.&quot;<br><br>&quot;An hour spent blowing Voyd&#39;s and Sergio Turbo&#39;s trumpets.&quot; Data Junkie rubbed their forehead. &quot;This is shaping up to be a long day.&quot;<br><br>&quot;At four you have one of the Ambassador&#39;s balls - I understand you&#39;ll be bumping up against Storme Hawk, rubbing shoulders with SkarmorySilver, and perhaps going down onto the floor with the likes of Hieronymus Graubart, Elcalion, and Phobos.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Only if I can get away from Darkotas, Huinesoron, and Desdendelle,&quot; Data Junkie pointed out. &quot;The &#39;big three&#39; have plans to keep me tied up for the entire evening, I think.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The ball should be over by eight,&quot; Caddy-Shack said. &quot;After that, you have… ah, yes. 8pm, back to the office for wild monkey sex with me.&quot; Looking up from the sheet of paper, Caddy-Shack favoured Data Junkie with a blinding smile. &quot;I took the liberty of pencilling that one in myself.&quot;<br><hr>

            <p>Cassie sat on the porch of her spacious villa, staring out over the plantation as she brushed her flowing golden locks. &quot;Alas,&quot; she wailed, as a flock of cardinals leapt into the air. &quot;Alas that I am here, alone and forsaken, far from the cities I should love to see!&quot;<br><br>A rumble sounded, like distant thunder, though the sky was a pure and deep blue. Cassie frowned out at the horizon: was there a shadow over the verdant hills? &quot;If there is,&quot; she declared, &quot;it is no more than the shadow over my heart.&quot;<br><br>Yet the darkness was growing, encompassing the wide lands of her inheritance, until Cassie could no longer deny its reality. She squinted into the black void, and saw at its heart a foxfire twinkle, a gleam that seemed to fly faster than the wind.<br><br>Cassie started to her feet, her body tensing as fight-or-flight reflexes took over. The light was taking on form now: two vast wings spread over the darkened fields, throwing darkness and light alike forward with every slow-sweeping beat. &quot;The creature - no, there can be no point denying it, the dragon - is magnificent,&quot; Cassie breathed.<br><br>The wind swept over Cassie, tangling her long blonde hair, whipping her white dress as it passed, but she cared not. Her eyes were locked on the descending form of the dragon, and the black-clad figure that sat astride its neck.<br><br>The dragon touched down, crushing a barn beneath its taloned foot. The rider bent low, whispering words of encouragement to it, then sat back up, looking down at Cassie. His armour was of jet and ebony and forge-wrought iron, and about his head there was a circlet of midnight pearl, set with black opals that glinted like trapped stars.<br><br>&quot;Who are you?&quot; Cassie called, leaning on the rail of her porch. &quot;Oh noble, proud and fair one, please - tell this humble maiden your name; for if you will not, my life must end this instant for grief!&quot;<br><br>The shadowy knight continued to observe her, his eyes like deep pits into the heart of time itself. Then he glanced away, as if - unthinkably - he were embarassed, and muttered something.<br><br>&quot;Brave sir,&quot; Cassie called again, &quot;my weak and womanly ears have betrayed me: I heard you not! Yet I must know your name, for with every beat of my racing heart I feel my love for you flooding through me!&quot;<br><br>The knight&#39;s second mumble wasn&#39;t much better, but Cassie just managed to make out the word &#39;Voyd&#39;. She smiled her most dazzling smile, and tossed her head, sending her gleaming hair cascading over her shoulder.<br><br>&quot;Sir Voyd,&quot; she called, feeling a thrill run through her as she spoke his name, &quot;what brings you to this lonely and forsaken place? But no!&quot; She held up a hand, pressed it to her forehead. &quot;Answer me not, for I know in my heart that you can be here for one reason alone - to rescue me from this idle existence, and whisk me away to a fairer and greater life in your powerful arms.&quot; With another gleaming smile, she blew a flurry of kisses at him, then stepped back onto her porch. &quot;And I will go with you!&quot; she declared, throwing her arms wide. &quot;Let me gather but a few of my most treasured possessions, and we will ride away into the sunset together!&quot;<br><br>As she ran through the door, she completely missed Voyd&#39;s nonplussed response. It went something like this:<br><br>&quot;Mumble mumble neighbour, mutter mumble cup of sugar?&quot;<br><hr>
<br><br>I feel bad for Cassie, signing up so early and never getting written about. So here you go.<br><br>Why are you living in the US State of Georgia? Who knows? Who cares? Not I.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;I&#39;m cold.&quot;<br><br>DawnFire and JulyFlame looked at firemagic, who shrugged slightly. &quot;Well, I am.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is a ploy to steal another one of my blankets, isn&#39;t it?&quot; JulyFlame shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s not going to work, firemagic. I&#39;m onto you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You always are.&quot; firemagic snuggled in closer against JulyFlame&#39;s side. &quot;But I&#39;m still cold.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll grab another log.&quot; Being careful not to dislodge the quilt wrapped around her shoulders, DawnFire shuffled across the floor to the woodpile. She pulled out the largest bough and placed it carefully on the fireplace, then quickly made her way back to the heap of cushions. &quot;Okay, now <i>I&#39;m</i> cold.&quot;<br><br>JulyFlame chuckled. &quot;Come here, then.&quot; She held out her arm and wrapped it around DawnFire, pulling her in. &quot;Honestly, you two are such wet blankets.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If the blankets were wet,&quot; firemagic pointed out, &quot;they&#39;d be frozen by now. <i>Why</i> is it so cold?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not.&quot; JulyFlame ruffled firemagic&#39;s hair. &quot;You&#39;re just both pathetic.&quot;<br><br>DawnFire raised an eyebrow. &quot;Then you won&#39;t mind if I <i>do</i> borrow this.&quot; She snatched the topmost blanket from JulyFlame&#39;s collection and huddled into it. &quot;It&#39;s not heeeeelping…&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good grief.&quot; JulyFlame looked from one to the other, then got to her feet in an abrupt motion. Grabbing a single blanket, she wrapped it around herself. &quot;I&#39;m going to make some cocoa and fill up the hot water bottles. And if you two don&#39;t stop whinging by the time I get back…&quot;<br><br>DawnFire giggled and shuffled over to wrap her arms around firemagic. Nuzzling in against the other woman&#39;s neck, she lowered her voice to a whisper. &quot;That&#39;s not an idle threat, either. She bites.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I <i>heard</i> that!&quot;<br><hr>
<br>Insofar as it&#39;s possible in the Shipfest, I&#39;ve gone for &#39;sweet&#39; rather than &#39;suggestive&#39;. And, yeah, there was no chance of HQ&#39;s Pyromanicest Elf <i>not</i> writing Flame/fire/Fire/fire. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Pretzel whirled across the stage, giving her all to the dance. The mirrors lining the wall reflected her slim body in flashes, catching here an outstretched leg, there a delicately curled arm. With each pirouette, each leap, she felt more and more sure of herself - and of Hieronymus Graubart&#39;s instruction.<br><br>His quiet voice was present at every stage. &quot;The leg a little higher,&quot; he would tell her, or, &quot;To the left a little more,&quot; or, &quot;Point the toes, Pretzel, point them!&quot; She loved it when he used her name - but she didn&#39;t let it show, didn&#39;t let the shivers he sent down her spine distract her from the dance.<br><br>The music swept towards its climax - the most difficult part of the performance. Pretzel&#39;s face was a mask of concentration as she contorted her limbs into the demanding forms Hieronymus had choreographed. His voice was silent now, but she could feel his eyes burning into her, urging her to higher and higher degrees of art.<br><br>The music reached its final, shattering fanfare, and the whirl and flex of Pretzel&#39;s body ceased at the precise moment it fell silent. She held her post for three long, painful seconds - and then curtsied gracefully to her audience of one, and allowed herself to relax.<br><br>Hieronymus Graubart gazed at her contemplatively, his eyes tracking over every inch of her body. She knew he was reliving the dance, checking it for imperfections, compiling his comments in order.<br><br>Finally, he spoke, and his soft voice brought a smile of pure delight to Pretzel&#39;s face. &quot;Exquisite, my dear, truly exquisite. I think you are at last ready for the stage.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Because I couldn&#39;t think of a better reason for Pretzel to be contorting her limbs without getting too risque.<br><br>(Things removed from this story include any actual German - I&#39;d rather leave it out and get it wrong - and any suggestion that Pretzel was dancing in the nude. Ahem. So yeah - choose for yourself how risque you want your shipfic! ^_~)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Huinesoron sat before his monitor, steepled his fingers and grinned widely. In the distance, metal squeaked and voices moaned, groaned and made an assortment of noises it&#39;s best to not put words to. He nearly let loose and cackled madly but decided he was above that.<br><br>The screen glowed ominously in the darkness. A pattern of windows displayed the prone forms of his fellow boarders locked in positions that were scandalous at best and at worst, painful to look at, let alone imagine being in. All was going exactly according to plan.<br><br>When just a four more boarders were paired then at last no one would be left to stop him. His ultimate plan for total domination of the PPC board would be complete.<br><br>He leaned in and tapped out two names. &quot;Iximas and TheShyIon.&quot; He chuckled, &quot;You won&#39;t be so shy soon.&quot; A sudden banging at the door interrupted his thoughts. He stood from his chair just in time to see the door flung open and a man dash inside.<br><br>&quot;hS! I knew you were the mastermind behind all of this!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Desdendelle! My arch nemesis!&quot;<br><br>Des fixed his foe with a glare, &quot;Your time is up! I know your plans and I intend to stop you right here and now!&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron set himself back down in his chair, crossed his legs and smiled in such a serene manner Des faltered and nearly took a step away from him. &quot;And how do you plan to do that,&quot; the evil genius mused, &quot;when you&#39;re not wearing any pants?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I- Err.&quot; Des paused for a moment and looked down. &quot;But, uh. I <i>am</i> wearing pants.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron snapped his fingers. Suddenly, a dark figure flung itself from the shadows and tackled Des to the ground where he was immediately found himself relieved of all of his clothing and being touched in all sorts of ways that made hS smile with manic glee. &quot;Not anymore. Darkotas has been waiting for a new plaything, haven&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>If a reply came, it was lost in the midst of the pile&#39;s mess of wild noises.<br><br>This time he allowed himself a cackle, but only a small one - barely more than a chortle - Then he turned back to his screen. &quot;Now where was I... Oh, yes.  Where shall I have these two... Ah. The bunk bed. Neshomeh and Kaitlyn will enjoy that.&quot;<br><br>____________<br><br>Headcanon is Huinesoron is controlling the Board with that recent PPC shipping game that I can&#39;t seem to find anymore.</p>

            <p>Minishipping ahoy, as suggested below!<br><br>-----<br><br>Iximas ducked under the hanging crocodile pit, smiling grimly. The last obstacle had been cleared.<br><br>Before her stood the legendary Fountain of Urple, streaming eye-searing bows from its depths.<br><br>Iximaz was perched on the rim of the Fountain, clothed (if you could call it that) in urple ribbons. She delicately plucked a ribbon from the Fountain and considered it for a moment before tossing it aside. <br><br>Iximax surfaced in the writhing urple pool and waved at Iximas, raising a finger to her lips.<br><br>It was too late, though. Iximaz&#39;s head turned to face them. &quot;I&#39;ve been expecting you,&quot; she whispered breathily. &quot;I seem to have been  helplessly ensnared in utter urpleness; what hero here shall deliver me?&quot;<br><br>The mini-Boarders winced and walked towards her. <br><br>&quot;Delightful, excellent minis,&quot; Iximaz murmured. &quot;Oh, dear. I think my words appear to be taking on a certain repetitive redundancy, I suppose. It seems that the only solution will be for you two to pull and rip these urple ribbons off of me...&quot;<br><br>Iximas and Iximax exchanged hopeful glances. Even minis had to have fun sometimes, right?<br><br>-----<br><br>I regret nothing. :D<br></p>

            <p>&quot;A true pizza must have the sauce on the <i>bottom</i>.

Hah!&quot; The darkness that surrounded Phobos was deep and layered, much like the pizza he espoused, but it could gain no ground against the rich light of Sergio Turbo. Phobos stalked forward, and the interface between the two forces became a slice of pure radiance. &quot;I would sooner,&quot; Phobos ground out, leaning in close, &quot;make out with you, than partake of that empty husk you call pizza.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fine, then!&quot; Sergio Turbo cried, and threw himself onto Phobos, his streaming cape cutting a wedge through the air. The pair went down together, a base of darkness with a topping of light, and it was quite some time before the argument resumed.<br><br><hr>

            <p><i>“Have I ever told you how I love you?”</i> Huinesoron, the sexiest Elf in this side of the sea, said in Quenya. Her only reply was to wrap herself around him tighter.<br>The Elven Feet Pole glared at them from the corner of the room, where it leaned on the wall. If it would have had arms, it would have crossed them. <i>I thought you were mine!</i> it seemed to be telling Huinesoron – in Sindarin, of course.<br>Quenya snorted derisively. The Elf was hers, all hers! It was sweet, sweet victory at last! It surprised her greatly when she felt him leave her warm embrace.<br>“I am sorry,” Huinesoron was saying, “but seeing the poor Pole out there, all alone, tall and hard, stirs the famous Elvish mercy within me. I must do something.”<br>And so he went and picked the Elven Feet Pole up. His next step was equally surprising – he thrust it into Quenya before jumping back in himself. “Now we are one.”<br><br>***<br><br>I blame Iximaz. Well, my head, but also Iximaz.</p>

            <p>&quot;Hey, TheShyIon, have you seen my- oh.&quot;<br><br>It isn&#39;t worth describing TheShyIon&#39;s normal hair colour, because Iximaz couldn&#39;t see it. Nor is it worth describing her normal clothing, because she wasn&#39;t wearing it. All she had on was a very skimpy bikini - but Iximaz couldn&#39;t even tell what colour it was. All she knew for sure was that her Little Sib was covered, head to toe, in what seemed to be water.<br><br><i>Purple</i> water.<br><br>&quot;Oh, um, hi!&quot; TheShyIon whipped her hands behind her back and tried her best to look innocent. &quot;I, um, wasn&#39;t expecting you!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I can-- TheShyIon, what are you hiding?&quot;<br><br>TheShyIon bit her lip. &quot;You&#39;ll laugh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I won&#39;t laugh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You <i>will</i>. Everyone laughs.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz pressed a hand over her heart. &quot;My dear TheShyIon, have I <i>ever</i> laughed at you?&quot;<br><br>TheShyIon considered. &quot;... yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That settles it, then. What&#39;re you hiding?&quot;<br><br>TheShyIon sighed and showed Iximaz the bottle she was holding. It was transparent glass, half-filled with a deep purple liquid. &quot;It&#39;s, um, potassium permanganate.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz blinked. &quot;And you pour it over yourself? Isn&#39;t that… dangerous?&quot;<br><br>There was a sudden scuffling noise from overhead, and then Huinesoron&#39;s head appeared, dangling from a hole in the ceiling. &quot;Potassium permanganate causes severe skin burns, and if absorbed through the skin it can--&quot; He vanished as suddenly as he&#39;d appeared, dragged back into the ceiling, and the girls heard his muffled voice moving away: &quot;Sorry, Hawkelf, but this was an emergen…&quot;<br><br>TheShyIon blinked up at the ceiling, then shrugged and returned her gaze to her Big Sib. &quot;I can&#39;t help it,&quot; she said, hunching her shoulders. &quot;It just feels so…&quot; Her voice dropped to a whisper. &quot;Good.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz studied TheShyIon for a few seconds. Then she shrugged. &quot;Okay, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re into. So have you seen my pencil?&quot;<br><br>TheShyIon stared at her, startled out of her embarassment. &quot;You&#39;re… not going to laugh?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I said I wouldn&#39;t, silly.&quot; Iximaz ruffled TheShyIon&#39;s hair, then wiped her hand on her black dress. &quot;But seriously, I need my pencil back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think I saw it over by the computer.&quot; TheShyIon quickly tipped a little more potassium permanganate into her hand and massaged it into her hair. &quot;What&#39;re you writing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not.&quot; Iximaz strode over to the computer and picked up the pencil in question, then turned back to her Little Sib with a smile. &quot;This isn&#39;t my writing pencil,&quot; she said, her voice dropping into a low, husky register. &quot;This is my… <i>other</i> pencil.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh.&quot; TheShyIon swallowed. &quot;Oh. Um. Oh.&quot; She blinked. &quot;Is it… any good?&quot;<br><br>Iximaz had already started back to the door. She stopped abruptly and turned to face TheShyIon. &quot;It… well, yes. Why are you asking?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I thought…&quot; TheShyIon took a deep breath. &quot;I just thought you might like to… stay here. With me. For a while.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz studied her again. Then, at last, she smiled. &quot;I <i>knew</i> I was right not to bother with the leather trousers,&quot; she said. &quot;So tell me, TheShyIon - does that permanganate <i>really</i> feel that good?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br>With apologies to Hawky for stealing her ceiling. But I&#39;m a chemist, I had to say it!<br><br>TheShyIon/a shy ion, Iximaz/her pencil, Iximaz/TheShyIon. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

Anyway, I had this brilliant idea for how to make things a little more, y&#39;know, interesting for us. For <i>both</i> of us. So...&quot;<br><br>-/--<br><br>The gears whirred into motion. Gleaming, burnished brass meshed and interlocked in perfect harmony. With the soft ticking of clockwork and the gentle hiss of steam, the task was done.

            <p>Space travel had a way of changing people. It had unlimited potential for everything from exploration to escape, and a thriving multitude of worlds offered any service under the sun. However, some travelers were not interested in such things. One man traveled with a single goal, a reason to live.<br>They called him the World-Jumper. He visited each world, never staying for more than a day or two; he was searching for something specific, and each world left him empty-handed. That something was a ship, filled with treasure beyond imagination. It had crashed in an unspecified location eons ago, long enough that others had began considering it a mere myth. The Storme Hawk. But World-Jumper knew the truth, and he would never give up until he had his prize. He followed the stories, determining truth from legend as he traveled. One way or another, he would find the fabled treasure. He would find Storme Hawk. Nothing else mattered.<br><br>((Hey, it&#39;s a ship!))</p>

            <p>This is loosely based off a chat conversation that Iximaz and I had during our co-write together. If there&#39;s any details I may have gotten wrong, please let me know! This is told from my POV, by the way.<br><br>----------<br><br>&quot;So, you&#39;ve played through Omega Ruby?&quot; I asked, my fingers still busily typing. &quot;I&#39;m really jealous - I&#39;ve never had a 3DS, let alone any of the games.&quot;<br>&quot;Aww, poor you,&quot; Iximaz replied, scanning the fic for additional charge-worthy material.<br>&quot;Luckily, once I get a stable income and take care of necessary costs, a 3DS will be the first thing on my mind, along with either Black or X.&quot; I stopped typing and sighed wistfully, hoping I&#39;d be able to escape the authority of my family once I was done with my degree.<br>&quot;Yeah, those are awesome,&quot; Iximaz replied. &quot;I loved the Black and White storylines, and N is a great character.&quot;<br>&quot;One of my friends on DeviantArt made a tickle pic of him once,&quot; I said suddenly.<br>She paused, looking at me with a very bemused expression. &quot;Do I want to know?&quot;<br>&quot;Hey, if you don&#39;t like it, you don&#39;t have to ask. To each their own, as they say.&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, I guess I won&#39;t. YKINMK.&quot;<br>&quot;Uh, what?&quot;<br>&quot;Your kink is not my kink.&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, right. So, what are you writing?&quot;<br>&quot;A little info about a new agent,&quot; Iximaz explained. &quot;His name&#39;s Zeb, and he was from my Diamond Nuzlocke. I plan to bring him into the PPC after this.&quot;<br>&quot;Ah, so you&#39;re introducing a Pokemon agent as well?&quot;<br>&quot;Yep. I may or may not have taken a cue from you and Falchion when I made that decision. I&#39;ll have you know - when I caught a Skarmory in my Omega Ruby Nuzlocke run, you were the first person who came to mind.&quot;<br>I looked at her, surprised and quite honestly, rather touched.<br>&quot;I know she was a girl, but I named her Falchion anyway. She was the reason I was able to make it through without losing anyone. Tanked all of the Elite Four members without dying.&quot;<br>I blushed, not knowing what to say.<br>&quot;When I first caught and nicknamed her, I told her, &#39;You were named for a badass agent. I hope you live up to that name.&#39;&quot;<br>My heart fluttering in my throat, I found myself lost for words, and instead typed in, &quot;*joyous armorbirb screeching*&quot;.<br>&quot;Birb?&quot; Iximaz asked, before bursting out laughing.<br>I hastily deleted the message and said, &quot;It&#39;s a Tumblr thing. Intentional mispelling for funny.&quot;<br>&quot;How do I shot web?&quot;<br>It was my turn to laugh this time as I started typing once more. &quot;More or less,&quot; I said - though we both could tell from the blush on my face that I was hiding a little something more.</p>

            <p>Huinesoron slammed the door behind him, and locked it. A second later and Desdendelle, Iximaz, and Voyd were attempting to batter it down like Ye Olde Battering Ram, using Caddy-Shack.<br>. &quot;Huinesoron! Huinesoron! Huinesoron!&quot; <br><br>Hearing his fate at the hands of the ravenous horde, he quickly moved to the window to make his escape. Or, at least he would have if Neshomeh hadn&#39;t slammed against it, pressing her face into it and clawing at the glass. &quot;Huinesoroooooon...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh bugger.&quot; <br><br>Backing away from the window, he made his way to the implausibly large air vent. Before he could celebrate getting to use his expensive escape route, Doctorlit and Phobos appeared from the shadows from within it, trying to force their way out. &quot;Huinesorooooooon!&quot;<br><br>Left with little choice, Huinesoron began making his way up the Super Emergency Ladder to the roof. Instead of finding an escape route, all he found was the rest of the Board, having completely encircled his house. Some waved signs with his name on it, others removed their clothes, flashing him. A few even spun pairs of his underpants around in the air. <br><br>&quot;Oh BUGGER.&quot;<br><br>And just as all hope seemed lost... a mechanical whinny pierced the skies as Steampunk!Kaitlyn flew in on her lighning powered jet-horse. &quot;Need a lift, love?&quot; she asked, tipping the most dapper of all hats at him, and offering a hand up. <br><br>***<br><br>... Huinesoron/The Board, then Huinesoron/Steampunk!Kaitlyn. Clearly the only logical solution.<br></p>

            <p>&quot;Oh oh oh oh oh!&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn looked up from her work. &quot;Sounds like <i>you&#39;re</i> having a good time.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz glowered at her. &quot;I had an <i>idea</i>, not an- anyway. You could glue some keys to it!&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn looked down at her exceptionally dapper hat. The brass cogs she&#39;d been fastening in place took up all of one side of it, ofsetting the black fabric nicely. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t they jam up the mechanism?&quot;<br><br>Iximaz chuckled. &quot;Only if you&#39;d made it functional.&quot; She shook her head, amused, then saw Kaitlyn&#39;s half-hidden smile. &quot;Wait… you haven&#39;t…&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh but I have.&quot; Kaitlyn reached under the brim of the hat and flicked a small switch. The clockwork on the side began to whir, wheels spinning and interlocking smoothly.<br><br>&quot;<i>Sacrebleu</i>,&quot; Iximaz whispered as Kaitlyn lifted the hat and placed it carefully on her head. &quot;It&#39;s magnificent…&quot;<br><br>&quot;And that&#39;s not all.&quot; Kaitlyn pressed a discreet button on the side of her corset, and gleaming steel rods began to move over its surface, tracing hypnotic circles against her luscious curves. She stood up, held her arms out from her sides, and twirled, letting her long skirt flow outwards. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Beautiful,&quot; Iximaz breathed. &quot;You&#39;re beautiful…&quot; She flushed and coughed. &quot;I mean it. <i>It&#39;s</i> beautiful.&quot; She let her gaze linger on Kaitlyn&#39;s corset for a few moments longer, then lifted her head to make eye contact. Her hand rose to brush over her own chest, her own corset. &quot;Could you… could you make mine do the same thing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well.&quot; Kaitlyn switched off her steampunk attire and cocked her head, considering Iximaz. &quot;Beautiful, did you say?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gorgeous,&quot; Iximaz agreed. &quot;Utterly stunning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmm.&quot; Kaitlyn walked slowly across to Iximaz, then reached out to trail a fingernail along the top of the younger woman&#39;s corset. &quot;I&#39;m sure I could manage something,&quot; she murmured. &quot;But you&#39;ll have to take it off first…&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>---<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve, um... I&#39;ve never worn one of these before.&quot;<br><br>There was silence, save for some faraway birdsong. Iximaz didn&#39;t really know what to do, though; all she could hear was laughter that wasn&#39;t there. How could she ever hope to compare against an elf like Kaitlyn?<br><br>In response, Kaitlyn stood up and walked very slowly towards her, languorous, gliding steps that made no sound at all. Iximaz just looked down at the floor, blushing hugely at her inexperience.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sor-&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn held a finger to the human girl&#39;s lips. &quot;You haven&#39;t been around as long as me. That&#39;s fine. Don&#39;t you dare be so silly as to apologise for not having done something.&quot; With that, she took her finger away and stood closer.<br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; Iximaz said slowly. &quot;Okay. I... I can do this. So, does it just, um, slip on?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn just smiled. &quot;After a fashion. Arms up.&quot; Her voice was soft, but still carried an edge of command that made Iximaz&#39;s knees weak. A sunbeam drifted through a gap in the curtains, catching the flesh of the human girl&#39;s arms as she lifted them up. Kaitlyn&#39;s hands were warm against them, gently stroking the flesh before running the unbuckled corset down the length of Iximaz&#39;s body.<br><br>&quot;Huh. There&#39;re fasteners on it, why&#39;d you slide it down me - oh.&quot; Iximaz felt the heat of an elvish body so close to her skin the hairs on the back of her neck stood on end. &quot;That&#39;s why.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered Kaitlyn, her breath tantalisingly hot as it drifted across the younger girl&#39;s rounded ears. &quot;It is.&quot;<br><br>More silence followed, save for the slow click-click-click of the corset&#39;s fasteners being locked in place. Iximaz almost didn&#39;t dare to breathe.<br><br>The last buckle was fastened.<br><br>&quot;Good girl.&quot; Kaitlyn took the opportunity to move even closer, her body pressing gently against Iximaz&#39;s. &quot;Now for the lacing.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz&#39;s cheeks flushed an even deeper crimson than before. &quot;Won&#39;t it... won&#39;t it hurt?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Kaitlyn whispered again. &quot;I&#39;m ever so careful of my girls.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Am, am I your...&quot; Iximaz felt something rising in her chest, her heart, her soul. &quot;Do it.&quot;<br><br>It was gentler than she expected. Iximaz&#39;s breath still caught in her throat as the laces were pulled tighter and tighter, the progress glacier-slow up her back, letting her feel the bones of the corset creak into shape. Aside from little gasps with each fresh burst of gorgeous tightness, the room was still silent.<br><br>&quot;There now. How does that feel?&quot;<br><br>There weren&#39;t words in the younger girl&#39;s head for how it felt. All she could do, all she could think to do, was turn around and look at Kaitlyn, her breathing slow, her heart pounding.<br><br>&quot;Well, Iximaz?&quot;<br><br>She leaned up on tiptoe and softly kissed the elf&#39;s lips.<br><br>&quot;Good girl.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Thought I might as well try to do at least <i>one</i> faintly serious shipfic. Apologies if the respective parties think it&#39;s no bloody good... and more apologies if it&#39;s, er, <i>too</i> good, if you know what I mean. =]</p>

            <p><i>Huinesoron/Iximaz - I see this as kind of a mentoring-related ship, with the rise of someone to greatness as their lover looks on, proud as can be of how far they&#39;ve come.</i> I might or might not have been bitten by the plot bunny. And... taken some liberties. I have no regrets. ^_^<br><br>~<br><br>Huinesoron lounged against the wall, his bulging, muscular arms folded across his equally-buff, shirtless chest. He watched hungrily as his young pupil hacked away at the training post.<br><br>Iximaz&#39;s long, luxurious mahogany tresses were flying around her head like a halo as she wielded her blade with a near-perfect form. <i>Actually, very perfect,</i> Huinesoron thought to himself, his eyes taking her body.<br><br>The sword bit into the post, and Iximaz struggled to pull it free. Huinesoron sighed and moved behind her. Iximaz blushed when the elf wrapped his arms around her, easily pulling the sword free. He handed it to her, not failing to notice the thin sheen of sweat that glistened on her bare shoulders. Breathing heavily, her voluptuous chest heaving, she resheathed her weapon.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re coming along nicely in your training,&quot; Huinesoron said, a smile gracing his chiseled features. <br><br>Iximaz blushed prettily, her coral-pink lips turning up in a tiny smile. &quot;Thank you, master.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you could be so much better,&quot; Huinesoron continued, as though she hadn&#39;t spoken. &quot;If you just... listened more to your instincts...&quot; His hands slid over her shoulders and traveled to the lacings on the front of the human girl&#39;s corset. <br><br>Iximaz&#39;s eyes gleaned as her own hands traced the contours of Huinesoron&#39;s bare chest. &quot;But, master, what ever about your wife? And I myself am already in a relationship.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They won&#39;t mind,&quot; Huinesoron said huskily, his lips brushing against her ear. &quot;In fact, I passed by them on my way here. The rosebush was shaking quite badly.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz laughed, and the sound was like the pealing of a bell to Huinesoron&#39;s pointed ears. She ran her fingers through his hair even as he tore at her corset, ripping it off and tossing it aside. They fell to the ground in a tangle of limbs, kissing passionately. <br><br>~<br><br>I disclaim any responsibilities if anyone decides to get busy in a rosebush.</p>

            <p>Darkotas finally arrived home wanting nothing other then to take a nice long nap. However, when he entered his bedroom he saw that was not to be the case. On his bed someone, most likely Iximaz, had left a note and several roses. &quot;Follow the trail of roses and I&#39;ll show you something special,&quot; read the note. <br><br>The idea of taking a nap was instantly dismissed from his mind. The only thing he could think of was what wonders awaited him at the end of the trail.<br><br>After a brief walk, Darkotas saw that the roses led into a rather large rosebush. <i>There must be room for two people in there,</i> he thought.<br><br>He pushed aside some of the branches to make an entrance for himself and went in, ready for the greatness that must be waiting on the other side. What he saw next made him shake his head and look again.<br><br>There, in the middle of the rather spacy rosebush, was none other than Kaitlyn, lying naked on the soft grass. &quot;Come here handsome,&quot; she whispered mischievously.<br><br>For a while, all Darkotas could do was stare at the sexy woman before him. Finally, he managed to sputter out a few words, &quot;What about Huinesoron and Iximaz?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What they don&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt them,&quot; she replied.<br><br>With that being all he needed, Darkotas bent down and kissed her, using more tongue than lips. The two lovers then took of Darkotas&#39; clothes very quickly and did very dirty things to each other.<br><br><br>Huinesoron was walking to his next lesson when he heard a rustling that made him stop. His keen elven senses allowed him to find the source with great ease. A rosebush was shaking quite a bit with faint moans emanating from it. He knew that he shouldn&#39;t look but curiosity overwhelmed him.<br><br>When he peeked inside he stared. There was his wife getting it on with Darkotas. They were too busy to realize he was there. Smirking, he continued on his way.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Also:-<br><br>---<br><br>Things were just starting to get interesting when hS heard the door slam shut downstairs.<br><br>Quick as a flash, he was out of the bed, pulling on his clothes and struggling not to make a sound.

Hell, you&#39;ve probably been choking on <i>him</i> often enough!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Des, I-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it.&quot; Desdenelle stormed off down the stairs, and the front door banged shut shortly thereafter.<br><br>HS turned to the love of his life. &quot;I... I should probably go back to mine. Um. Yeah.&quot; With that, he picked up his jacket, gave one last look towards the love of his life, and left the room.<br><br>The teapot in the bedsheets said nothing.</p>

            <p>...Why is everyone looking at me like that?<br><br>~<br><br>Teapot whistled at French Press, who was standing on the counter across the kitchen from him.<br><br>French Press would have flipped her hair if she&#39;d had any. As it was, she gave Teapot a disdainful look and hopped several inches away, moving a little closer to Neshomeh as she did so.<br><br>&quot;Aww, who&#39;s a good French Press?&quot; Neshomeh cooed, giving Teapot a filthy look as she did so. Under her breath, she muttered, &quot;Dirty cheater.&quot;<br><br>Teapot let the insult slide off his polished ceramic exterior. He&#39;d been with so many Boarders at this point he was starting to lose track. He didn&#39;t really mind; all he had eyes for was French Press. Now that was one gorgeous gal.<br><br>Neshomeh left the room, and Teapot took the opportunity to hop along the counter to French Press. The coffeepot raised a disapproving eyebrow at him, but when Teapot gave another appreciative whistle, she blushed slightly and moved a little closer, giggling when he poured hot water in her top.<br><br>Of course, it was at that moment Neshomeh decided to return. She stopped and stared, horror-struck, when she saw her French Press doing hot beverage-maker intimate things to Teapot. <br><br>&quot;No!&quot; Neshomeh cried. &quot;First you, Teapot, and then you, French Press? Why must everyone I love leave me?&quot; She turned and ran off to find Phobos.<br><br>&quot;Have I ever mentioned how steamy I think our love will be?&quot; Teapot murmured into French Press&#39; ear. She smiled.<br><br>~<br><br>I have no idea what I just did there.</p>

            <p>Darklordaakmal sat brooding on his throne. From the depths of the fortress came the sound of his orcs hard at work, building the engines of war that would one day sweep the enemy from his lands forever.<br><br>The door flew back with a crash, and a wave of shadow swept into the great hall. It shrouded each of the flickering torches in turn, snuffing the life out of them, plunging the room into darkness. Against the volcanic red glow from outside, darklordaakmal saw a cloaked and hooded figure step into the fortress.<br><br>&quot;Who dares trespass on the domain of darklordaakmal?&quot; he demanded, rising to his feet. The obsidian of his throne clutched at him for a moment, then yielded, and as he stepped forward the black glass flowed with him, forming itself into razor-sharp battle armour.<br><br>&quot;I dare.&quot; A dark light seemed to emanate from the intruder as he swept back his hood, revealing a proud and cruel face.<br><br>Darklordaakmal&#39;s brow lowered in fury. &quot;Darkotas. What is this insolence?&quot; Responding to his wrath, the very walls of the fortress seemed to loom inwards in the gloom, leaning menacingly over Darkotas.<br><br>&quot;The insolence is <i>yours</i>.&quot; Darkotas came to a halt in the centre of the floor, and the shadow which enveloped him seemed to grow, forming an inky pool that spread slowly across the hall. &quot;This latest decree of yours cannot be-&quot;<br><br>&quot;My decisions are not negotiable,&quot; darklordaakmal growled, his midnight eyes narrowing. &quot;If you think-&quot;<br><br>&quot;If <i>you</i> think you can just-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ooh la la!&quot;<br><br>There was a sound of tinkling silver bells, and a shaft of light pierced the hadean night of the great hall. It was centred on a man: a man who was humming cheerfully to himself, a man whose skin seemed to glow as he skipped across the floor towards the pair… a man who was dressed in a French maid&#39;s outfit.<br><br>With a flounce, Elcalion came to a halt, midway between Darkotas and darklordaakmal. He tossed back his hair and brandished his feather duster. &quot;This is <i>la ridiculous</i>!&quot;<br><br>Darkotas looked at darklordaakmal, then back to Elcalion. &quot;I&#39;m inclined to agree.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Non, non</i>!&quot; Elcalion snapped. &quot;It is <i>you</i> who are ridiculous! Why do you fight and threaten <i>la war</i> when it is clear what you <i>really</i> want?&quot;<br><br>Darklordaakmal stared at him. &quot;What I &#39;really want&#39; is-&quot;<br><br>&quot;-to take this gorgeous young man to your bed and let him use you as he will, <i>n&#39;est pas</i>?&quot; Elcalion beamed and flicked up the hem of his skirt. &quot;And <i>so you shall</i>!&quot; He reached around, took hold of the toggle at the collar of his dress, and gave it a dramatic downwards tug.<br><br>There was a moment of silence and utter stillness.<br><br>&quot;Um - can one of you help me with <i>la zip</i>? I think it is <i>la stuck</i>.&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>&quot;Sacrebleu!&quot; Iximaz batted Desdendelle&#39;s hand away. &quot;Monsieur, you are overbold!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I thought nous were having le orgy!&quot; protested Desdendelle.<br><br>&quot;Oui, oui, but nous should still take le time.&quot; Iximaz folded her arms primly across her bare chest. &quot;Sacrebleu!

            <p>&quot;You know,&quot; Huinesoron said, &quot;I don&#39;t actually remember using Hebrew.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Desdendelle replied. He waved a hand carelessly. &quot;If you did, it would be terrible.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t use Marain, either,&quot; the Elf pointed out.<br><br>&quot;Your Swahili is also a disaster,&quot; Desdendelle told him, grinning. He ignored the Elf&#39;s latest comment as irrelevant. &quot;And I&#39;d hate to see you try talking to Teapot, I don&#39;t think it would end well.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron crossed his arms. &quot;Oh, you think so, do you?&quot;<br><br>The soldier nodded. &quot;Your French is wrong, your Hebrew is worse, and your Marain is even more wrong than both of them combined--&quot;<br><br>&quot;I never actually used Hebrew or--&quot;<br><br>&quot;So why should your Tea-Whistling be any better?&quot;<br><br>For a minute, there was silence. Then, the Elf said, &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re quite being fair, Desdendelle.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Huinesoron said flatly. &quot;In fact, you&#39;re being downright cruel.&quot;<br><br>The soldier only grinned, and spun a teacup around in his hand. &quot;Well, maybe I am...but in that case, what are you going to do about it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;This,&quot; said the Elf, and moved forward. Several seconds later, the teacup fell to the floor.<br><br>&quot;מעולה,&quot; Desdendelle said. It came out rather muffled. &quot;Keep doing that.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron paused. &quot;...I have no idea what you just said.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wow,&quot; replied the soldier, laughing. &quot;Your Hebrew really is that bad!&quot;<br><br>&quot;שתוק,&quot; Huinesoron retorted, and proceeded to make him.</p>

            <p>&quot;So.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz trembled as she stood before the dark throne. Admittedly, it wasn&#39;t quite as, well, <i>dark</i> as she&#39;d been expecting - it was more of a pastel pink (with hot pink trimmings) - but still: the elf who sat (or lounged) in it was terrifying enough even if he <i>was</i> topless.<br><br>&quot;So,&quot; Huinesoron said again, fixing Iximaz with a look, &quot;you are… &#39;Iximaz&#39;?&quot;<br><br>Iximaz considered trying to deny it, but knew it would be futile: the eyes of the Eagleshade were everywhere. &quot;Yes, my lord,&quot; she said, hearing the quaver in her voice. At that moment, she considered it a personal triumph that she hadn&#39;t fallen to her knees in tears.<br><br>Huinesoron tapped one long finger on the arm of his throne. &quot;Rumours have reached me,&quot; he said. &quot;Disturbing rumours. Rumours that you, Miss Iximaz, have claimed that my French is &#39;wrong&#39;.&quot;<br><br>Iximaz&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;You… what?&quot; She snapped her mouth shut as she remembered who she was talking to, but still had to shake her head. &quot;My lord, with all possible respect… it is.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron stood in a single graceful movement. His dark cloak (dark <i>pink</i>, Iximaz realised) fell back from his bare chest, fluttering in the air as he strode across the marble floor towards her. &quot;Take it back,&quot; he growled.<br><br>&quot;No.&quot; Iximaz somehow managed to stand her ground. &quot;My lord, threats cannot change the facts.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The facts?&quot; Huinesoron scoffed. &quot;You don&#39;t <i>know</i> the facts. You have no experience-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m experienced enough to-&quot; Iximaz began, and then paled. She had interrupted Lord Huinesoron! There was no higher crime.<br><br>But Huinesoron didn&#39;t seem to care. &quot;You have never witnessed my French,&quot; he said, his tone ominous. &quot;But you shall.&quot; And with no further warning than that, he grabbed hold of the shaking Iximaz&#39;s arm, dragged her to him, and kissed her.<br><br>The kiss was in no way romantic. It was a demonstration of power and skill, and involved far, far more tongue than Iximaz would have expected. She tried to pull back, but not only would Huinesoron not let her, she didn&#39;t really <i>want</i> to. Before long, she was responding in kind, giving as good as she got.<br><br>Finally, Huinesoron pulled away, just as abruptly as he had begun. He wiped his mouth on the back of his hand, then met Iximaz&#39;s gaze. &quot;So,&quot; he said, &quot;do you still dare speak ill of my French?&quot;<br><br>Iximaz, breathing hard and trembling, looked up at him. &quot;If I say yes,&quot; she managed, &quot;will you do it again?&quot;<br><hr>

Now, what are we going to do about it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;About what?&quot; asked Huinesoron.<br><br>Iximaz blushed. &quot;Well, I mean... it <i>is</i> traditional...&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>What</i> is?&quot; demanded the Elf.<br><br>Kaitlyn sidled forward, and wrapped her arms loosely around his neck. &quot;Why, sleeping with a married couple before trying to cause a different couple&#39;s divorce, of course,&quot; she said, and then winked. &quot;But only if the taller half of the married couple uses the word &#39;attractive&#39;.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron eyed her, speculative and skeptical, even as he looped his own arms around her waist. &quot;You made that up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Only some of it,&quot; Iximaz blurted, coming closer to then. &quot;I mean...okay, most of it. But we&#39;ve been planning this for a while, now.&quot; She rested her chin on Kaitlyn&#39;s shoulder, looking up at the make Boarder with wide eyes. &quot;You won&#39;t ruin it, will you?&quot;<br><br>There was a brief silence, and then the Elf smiled slowly.<br><br>&quot;How about we try it,&quot; he said, &quot;and you can find out?&quot;<br><br>---<br>Enjoy :)<br><br>...er, not meaning anything by that, of course. Wow, you really don&#39;t notice your own innuendo until you participate in a shipficfest (or try writing Captain Jack Harkness), do you...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>&quot;Des. <i>Des</i>.&quot; Neshomeh had to catch the soldier by the arm as he walked by. &quot;Desdendelle, sit down.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What? Why? I don&#39;t need to sit down.&quot; Desdendelle practically vibrated, held in place by the other Boarder. &quot;I&#39;m fine. Forget about sitting...&quot; He pulled free, and walked quickly over to the kitchen counter. Once there, he filled the electric kettle and turned it on.<br><br>Neshomeh sighed. &quot;Desdendelle, this is an intervention.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh? What for?&quot; Impatient and jittery, Desdendelle grabbed a mug and filled it with hot water from the giant urn that sat next to the kettle. He dropped in a tea bag and some sugar, and sighed happily. &quot;Ah, there you are, <i>ahuvi</i>...all hot and ready and <i>waiting</i>...&quot;<br><br>Both of Neshomeh&#39;s eyebrows flew up. &quot;<i>Des</i>,&quot; she said loudly. &quot;Desdendelle. Earth to—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mm, tea.&quot; Desdendelle inhaled the wonderful scent, and then blinked and looked up at Neshomeh. &quot;Sorry, did you say something?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Des</i>,&quot; Neshomeh said, exasperated. She sighed. &quot;This isn&#39;t working.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What isn&#39;t?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The intervention.&quot; Neshomeh ran her hands through her hair; one got stuck, and she tugged it free with a wince. &quot;Des, you can&#39;t keep drinking so much tea. You barely sleep, you bounce everywhere, you—you&#39;re talking to the tea like it&#39;s your lover! You—&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is my lover.&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh practically screeched to a halt. &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>The soldier smiled at her, and took another sip. &quot;The tea. It&#39;s my lover. I&#39;m in love.&quot;<br><br>The female Boarder screwed her eyes shut and then opened them. Nothing changed.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Desdendelle said. He patted her arm, grinning. &quot;I&#39;m not against shari--&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Right</i>,&quot; said Neshomeh. &quot;Oh, what was that? I think—yes, that&#39;s definitely Phobos calling me. Bye!&quot; And she disappeared in a cloud of coffee grounds.<br><br>Desdendelle breathed in deeply, savoring the scent of well-brewed tea.<br><br>&quot;Good,&quot; he said, and drank some more. He turned to the ever-growing collection of mugs on the kitchen counter, wondering whether it was time to start washing them yet. No, he still had at least three clean ones...borrowing DawnFire&#39;s teacups and Neshomeh&#39;s coffee mugs had been a good idea, especially since neither of them had figured it out yet.<br><br>**<br><br>A continent or so away, Neshomeh stopped with her hand on the door to her house.<br><br>&quot;That son of an Orc,&quot; she said. &quot;That was my NaNoWriMo coffee mug he was drinking from.&quot;<br><br>Well, she thought as she stepped inside. At least he&#39;d left her Wiki-updating mug alone. She&#39;d brought it with her, and it was still in her hands—<br><br>Neshomeh looked down at both hands—both empty hands—and groaned.<br><br>Great. Now she had to mount a rescue mission. French Press would leave her, at this rate...<br><br>---<br><br>I...I&#39;m not sure how sorry I am for this. I will apologize for the line said to the tea, but...I couldn&#39;t resist.<br><br>Also, Neshomeh has m-dashes because I figure she <i>would</i>. (And different coffee mugs for different activities, because why not? :))<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>DawnFire snuggled in against Cassie and looked down over the rural scene before them. &quot;This is nice,&quot; she murmured.<br><br>&quot;It <i>is</i> a lovely view,&quot; Cassie agreed, and DawnFire flushed: she wasn&#39;t looking at the scenery at all.<br><br>&quot;I think it leaves something to be desired,&quot; Scapegrace said, shifting her fan to her other hand and continuing to waft cool air over the pair. &quot;Or something to be taken <i>away</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is that,&quot; DawnFire allowed. Down in the river, Iximaz was making eyes at SkarmorySilver, who responded by flicking a handful of water into her face. &quot;Does anyone know what they&#39;re doing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;d guess that&#39;s Charm on Iximaz&#39;s side, and Splash from SkarmorySilver.&quot; Cassie chuckled as Iximaz ducked under the spray and dove for SkarmorySilver. &quot;It was certainly ineffective enough… and I guess Iximaz is going for a Sweet Kiss?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not if SkarmorySilver&#39;s Defence Curl holds her off,&quot; Scapegrace pointed out. Down below, SkarmorySilver ducked away, wading deeper into the river to avoid Iximaz&#39;s advances.<br><br>&quot;But Iximaz still has Disarming Voice,&quot; Cassie disagreed, shading her eyes with one hand and trying to read Iximaz&#39;s lips. &quot;I think she might-&quot;<br><br>SkarmorySilver suddenly reversed direction, lunging for Iximaz. DawnFire sat up and stared down as the pair plunged into the water. &quot;What was <i>that</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Looked like Tickle to me.&quot; Scapegrace grinned. &quot;I bet they&#39;re having a good time right now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or as good a time as you can have when you&#39;re being Pokemon,&quot; DawnFire said, shaking her head. &quot;I mean, really, what sort of moves are they going to have that work for… <i>that</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;SkarmorySilver might have Acrobatics,&quot; Cassie suggested. &quot;Or maybe Happy Hour.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or Iximaz could use Bounce,&quot; added Scapegrace. &quot;Speaking of which…&quot; She waggled her eyebrows.<br><br>Cassie looked down at DawnFire. &quot;You&#39;re right, that <i>does</i> sound nice. You&#39;ll keep fanning us, won&#39;t you, Scapegrace?&quot;<br><br>Scapegrace scowled, waving the fan harder. &quot;I don&#39;t get why <i>I&#39;m</i> stuck with the fan while everyone else gets to use Tackle.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because you refused to take your clothes off,&quot; DawnFire told her, and leant in closer to Cassie. &quot;So… let&#39;s see what moves you&#39;ve got, my dear.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I <i>did</i> take my… oh, whatever. You&#39;re not listening anyway.&quot; Scapegrace considered for a moment, then shrugged. &quot;At least I still get to enjoy the view.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br>Based on the moves they actually use (not the ones everyone else speculates on), Iximaz is a Jigglypuff, and Skarm is a Clefairy. Because I&#39;m a terrible person. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If one thing can be said about bunk beds, it&#39;s that they make for <i>very</i> fun parties. <br><br>Neshomeh, Darkotas, and Kaitlyn had claimed control of the bottom bunk and quickly set to work on building an intricate fort by hanging  a sheet from the top bunk. Then they dived in, their antics quickly tearing the sheet down, not that any of them minded.<br><br>Meanwhile, Huinesoron, Iximaz, and Phobos were having their own fun in the top bunk. Sure, the horizontal space was limited, and it was had to stay balanced due to all the rocking coming from below, but that just made things all the more exciting. <br><br>Huinesoron stopped his ministrations to his top-bunk bedmates to lean over the side to watch his sexy wife and her two current lovers. Iximaz and Phobos, now distracted, leaned over the edge as well, watching their respective partners. Suddenly, the bunk tipped over and spilled everyone onto the floor, but they decided to continue on with what they were doing anyway. It was fun to mix things up sometimes. Besides, that wasn&#39;t the first time the bunk bed had been knocked over from a wild night. <br><br>((Totally, completely, 100% crack and more a warmup than anything. Next one will be a bit more &#39;serious&#39;, no worries.))</p>

            <p>Basically this: it would be next to impossible to organise an actual PPC orgy. The PPC sense of humour would get right in the way.<br><br>Think about it! If Lacksidacksical, OlderThanThou, and Oaken Thorinshield were at a Gathering together, and then this conversation happens:<br><br>Oaken: Hey, guys, how about we have an orgy?<br>OTT: Sounds like fun!<br>Lacksi: I was <i>hoping</i> you&#39;d suggest it!<br>OTT: Probably not here, though.<br>Oaken: Well, no, I was thinking we&#39;d go back to my place.<br>Lacksi: Ooh, do you have honey and cream? I&#39;m starting to get ideas... no, not really, but then again...<br>OTT: Personally, I don&#39;t think we&#39;d have time to get them out, if you know what I mean.<br>Oaken: Okay... are we serious about this?<br>OTT: Of course not! That would be silly.<br>Lacksi: Ha ha.<br><br>How many of them were actually interested in an orgy? We know from the prior thread that it&#39;s perfectly possible to have that conversation (with a lot more innuendo) among people who&#39;re genuinely uninterested... but how do you spot the ones who <i>are</i>? Everything can be interpreted as straight-faced humour, or as playing along, or as... whatever.<br><br>The obvious answer is &#39;try something physical&#39;... but this is the PPC, we&#39;re a bunch of socially-maladjusted types, and I doubt there&#39;s more than a handful of us with the self-confidence to risk making a move and having it fall flat.<br><br>So it would be fundamentally impossible to organise. Which, given the people involved, is probably a very good thing.<br><br>(Most of what sparked this was Neshomeh&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=269318;search_term=good+grief">parenthetical here</a>. Tell me that can&#39;t be read as a &#39;haha, of course not, how silly, or do you think we should?&#39;. ^_^ Not that I&#39;m impugning Nesh&#39;s motives or anything...)<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: No.</p>

            <p>So it wouldn&#39;t be <i>impossible</i>. But at that point I&#39;d worry about who was serious (or willing to be serious) all along and who was really just joking but now might feel pressure to go along with the group. Or the inverse... In the example conversation, I kinda get the sense that Lacksi was actually into the idea and her &quot;ha ha&quot; at the end is a bit forced. Poor disappointed Lacksi.<br><br>There&#39;s an interesting thought in all of this about who&#39;s comfortable/confident enough to joke about their sexuality and who isn&#39;t, but I don&#39;t feel like teasing it out at the moment. Nor is this necessarily the right time or place for it. *shrug*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... don&#39;t go in for taking the ridiculous seriously to anything like the extent PPCers do.

            <p>&quot;But I don&#39;t know <i>how</i> to talk to girls!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, no, see, that&#39;s where you&#39;re going wrong.&quot; Huinesoron leant back in his chair and peered at Voyd over steepled fingers. &quot;You don&#39;t need to <i>talk</i>; you need to <i>act</i>.&quot;<br><br>Voyd actually stopped his fretful pacing and stared at Huinesoron. &quot;Act? Like… a play?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... no.&quot; Huinesoron sighed. &quot;Look. Imagine she walks through that door right now. What do you do?&quot;<br><br>Voyd bit his lip. &quot;I, uh-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wrong.&quot; Huinesoron flicked a hand out dismissively. &quot;The correct answer is, you kiss her.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I… kiss her?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Now</i> you&#39;re getting the idea.&quot; Huinesoron cocked his head. &quot;Or just repeating things mindlessly, I suppose. Let&#39;s see… then you turn into a crocodile.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I turn-?&quot; Voyd managed to stop himself. &quot;I mean… kiss her how?&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron rolled his eyes. &quot;With… your… mouth.&quot; He chuckled at Voyd&#39;s expression. &quot;And I&#39;m not talking about a peck on the cheek, either. I expect there to be tongue - <i>lots</i> of tongue.&quot;<br><br>Voyd flushed slightly. &quot;I, uh, um, right. And then what?&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron stretched his arms over his head. &quot;That depends on how she takes it.&quot; He counted the options off on his fingers. &quot;If she pushes you away - unlikely, but always possible - you should apologise and leave. If she seems vaguely interested, but not really into it, you should grope her a bit.&quot;<br><br>Voyd spluttered and nearly lost his balance. &quot;I <i>what</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Feel her up. Fondle her.&quot; Huinesoron waved one hand expansively. &quot;Touch her in places you wouldn&#39;t normally touch someone. Do you need a list?&quot;<br><br>Voyd stared at him. &quot;I… are you <i>serious</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I&#39;d have to write it on the spot, but that&#39;s no problem-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I mean… you actually expect me to… to molest her?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Expect? No.&quot; Huinesoron grinned as Voyd sighed in relief. &quot;It&#39;s an option for if she&#39;s not very interested, but she <i>should</i> be. In which case, you should take her clothes off.&quot;<br><br>Voyd had started pacing again as Huinesoron was speaking, and this time he <i>did</i> fall over. As he levered himself up off the floor, he was spluttering with something between disbelief, bewilderment, and outrage. &quot;You <i>what</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I recommend starting with her top.&quot; Huinesoron&#39;s expression was calm and composed, his voice thoughtful. &quot;After that, you&#39;ll have to play it by ear. You could take your <i>own</i> t-shirt off, but that might look a bit self-centred. You could go for her bra, which would make it easy to switch back to &#39;molesting&#39; if you want to, but they&#39;re tricky if you don&#39;t have the practice. Or you could take off her trousers, but it might look like you&#39;d lost focus.&quot;<br><br>Voyd&#39;s mouth was hanging open, and his eyes seemed to bulge out of their sockets. &quot;You… you… I… you…&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron cut over him in that same contemplative tone. &quot;Ultimately, the goal is to get you both naked. Whether you try and make that simultaneous, or spend some time on her before you focus on yourself, is up to you - and her, I suppose. <i>After</i> you&#39;ve both got your clothes off, that&#39;s when-&quot;<br><br>The door creaked open, and Kaitlyn stepped into the room. Her long black hair was pulled back into a tight braid, and there was a smile on her face as she nodded first to Huinesoron, then to Voyd. &quot;Hello, boys. Things going well?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aha! Hi, love.&quot; Huinesoron beamed at her. &quot;We were just talking about you…&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br>I would apologise, but I&#39;m not in the least bit sorry. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Darn. Still, it&#39;s a wonderfully cinematic series either way, and has one of the best stories in gaming IMO. If you ever get a chance, try one out sometime! I recommend going in order of release if possible, or playing at least MGS3 if not.</p>
