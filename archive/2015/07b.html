            <p>I know, I know, these are way overdone and most of them are badfics. But I was really wondering if it could be done correctly. And if they could, how would you make one into at least a decent fix?<br>I wouldn&#39;t do one personally (or at least yet), I just want to know the possibility of making one that would be worthwhile.<br>I do know the basics of making a good character so no need to go into over detail on that.<br><br>And if any of you guys have read a decent or better school AU fic I would really like it if you could mention it to me.<br><br>Thanks!

            <p>It&#39;s no good trying any kind of AU if your story is literally &#39;wouldn&#39;t it be weird if [they were at high school/Boromir was an elf/Kirk had wings]?!&#39;. You need a story.<br><br>The High School AU has the effect of placing all the characters on the same level. In <i>Les Miserables</i>, most of the characters never meet each other; several of them are dead while the others are still children. Many of the others connect in ways defined rigorously by their social status. So if you wanted to explore how Enjolras and Javert would get on if there wasn&#39;t a revolution on... well, you can&#39;t. Javert&#39;s a policeman, he doesn&#39;t talk to radical students.<br><br>But if you transpose it to a high school? Maybe Javert is some kind of prefect or something, and Enjolras is head of the Young Communists Society - but <i>now</i> they have to share classes, and have lunch in the same place, and get the bus in together. You can force two people who would never associate in canon into close proximity, simply by rewriting the entire background. ^<em>^<br><br>(They would get on like a house on fire, of course - in the Pratchett sense. Flames, people screaming... ^</em>~)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a very, very long time coming, but it&#39;s finally <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1siYYTOpjVGzmfqubAvNY-SzV-isUb3J_75sEZnui_TI/pub">complete</a>. Prior works in my spin-off can be found <a href="http://agent-july.dreamwidth.org/">here</a>, which is where I&#39;m currently working on putting everything I&#39;ve written. I wanted to finish this before I put everything else there.<br><br>This mission has been in the works since March 2008, and as a result is quite old! I owe many thanks to the various people who&#39;ve beta read it for me, including but not limited to FractalDawn, Makari, Neshomeh, and now Desdendelle. <br><br>As a very short recap, Agent Library goes on a mission into the HP universe with her usual partner Agent July&#39;s avatar- known as JF- who was found in a badfic which July had made a couple years before joining the PPC herself. This mission is set in 2008.<br><br>Constructive criticism is much appreciated, as are any errors anyone manages to find. I also realize that this mission might come off on the dated side, which I only <i>slightly</i> apologize for, considering how old it is!<br><br>-July</p>

            <p>First off, it&#39;s good to see both you and your agents out and about again, so to speak. I&#39;ve enjoyed your spinoff in the past and your characters have traditionally been very solid.<br><br>That being said, this story felt a little uneven to me. I thought the conclusion was quite good, but the bulk of the mission itself felt a bit lacking. I feel like part of that was due to long stretches of the story being very MST-like in structure. Badfic line, agent quip, badfic line, agent quip, and so on. As Nesh said in one of her posts, seeing inside their heads or getting a bit more description would have been good. I also wasn&#39;t crazy about the lack of significant interaction between Library and JF, but I can rationalize it as they&#39;re still getting used to one another in-universe.<br><br>I won&#39;t really get into the formatting stuff. Other people have already touched upon what I would have mentioned (the blending of badfic quotes with mission text and so on). I&#39;m curious to see what it looks like on the Dreamwidth site.<br><br>The conclusion was pretty solid though, as I mentioned before. I feel like the story starts picking up once the agents start bumping off the various Sues. The level of interaction between the agents and the canonical characters feels good; I particularly enjoyed the bit where Ron says &quot;Damn right!&quot; after Library brings up the repeated bashing of him. The final scene following the mission felt a bit insubstantial in comparison. I personally would&#39;t have minded if the story had ended when they all portalled back to HQ.<br><br>I would say that I enjoyed this story, unevenness notwithstanding. I would argue that it could do with some tightening, but it definitely had its moments.</p>

            <p>Yeaaah, I&#39;m going to say &#39;thank you&#39; as far as your thoughts on the conclusion went, since it was the newest part and also thankfully the part given the least concrit. <br><br>My older stuff certainly suffered more from Talking Head syndrome and this one isn&#39;t excused from it, despite being finished this month. (If I could ever fit in the time, I&#39;d go with editing everything I&#39;ve written from the very beginning- and I&#39;ve talked about it before, with Nesh!- but that&#39;ll likely never happen.) <br><br>The lack of interaction between Library and JF was on purpose, that said; as characters they don&#39;t mesh at all, and the lack is pretty much supposed to be a sharp contrast to the usual dynamic of Library and July, who foil each other well and even play off each other to allow for more interaction.  <br><br>JF is me poking at the &#39;impulsive one&#39; side of one of the usual agent pairing types and then cranking it up to eleven and breaking the knob off to see what happens when you let the &#39;id&#39; go free and don&#39;t tone it down and make the other agent have to actually deal with it. <br><br>The formatting errors will certainly be fixed in this doc for when it gets posted on the Dreamwidth journal for posterity.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you actually ended up liking the conclusion! I had one major break in writing this: I got stuck for actual years <i>right</i> before the scene changed to follow Remus and the Counts. Everything after that came together pretty much at once.<br><br>I&#39;m also happy you enjoyed the interaction between agents and canons! I don&#39;t know if this has changed recently (due to being Out of It) but I know that involving and interacting with Canons is usually made a big deal and they&#39;re kept out of the loop even when it&#39;s happening in front of them, but Ron and Harry were for the most part IC beyond dealing and absolutely tolerating the Sues and I couldn&#39;t see those two <i>not</i> getting involved in the charge scene or not commenting on it while it was happening- especially Ron, since he&#39;s partial to himself, for some reason. <br><br>I am sorry that the final scene in HQ felt insubstantial to you; something I like doing with this spin-off is bookending by beginning in HQ and ending in HQ, not so much as a stopping point but because it gives me a way to set the characters up and then reset them for what comes next. <br><br>I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it despite the problems you and Nesh noticed.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed reading your other missions back when I found the PPC, so I’m happy to see more of Library and JF. Specifically I liked the understated way the fairy was disposed of; and the charging of Patience and Lydia was glorious. <br><br>Alas, although the scene with Remus and the Counts was very well written, it felt wrong to me, because I couldn’t see anything other than a replacement in this Remus. His condition is heritable, he fursplodes when he is angry, he and his half-werewolve daughter eat raw meat, he leaves for America with an American half-vampire and her father – come on, he is obviously from <i>Twilight</i>! <br><br>Typos not already found by SMF:<br><br><i>JF‘s sneakers squeaked as she desperately tried <b>once</b> last time to stay out of the bathroom. </i><br>You probably meant &quot;one last time&quot;.<br><br><i>She thought for a moment that Remus was going to attack her, but his grip on his <b>land</b> loosened,<br>and she felt relief flood when he asked, “How can I help?”</i><br>The grip was probably &quot;on his wand&quot;.<br>Also, I feel like something may be missing in &quot;she felt relief flood when he asked&quot;.<br><br><i>For this, the two <b>for</b> you are sentenced to death.“</i><br>You probably meant &quot;the two of you&quot;.<br><br><i>Before Lydia was able to launch herself at Library, she was hit solidly in the chest by a large fireball and soon burned to a crisp. <b>She</b> twisted to look back.</i><br>I’m sure that you didn’t intend to say that Lydia &quot;twisted to look back&quot;, but she <b>was</b> the last female person mentioned, and assuming that the previous &quot;she&quot; referred to Library only makes things worse.<br><br><i>Library left with Phillip, giving him a slightly less condensed run-down of the PPC before they arrived at the door to Personnel, where she left him, and then to the coffee place she had learned about from Denny.</i><br>Again, I feel like something may be missing in the last part of this sentence.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>To be honest, I was anticipating with some concern what you&#39;d have to say, because I&#39;ve read the reviews you&#39;ve given to other missions, and by and large they&#39;re truly excellent (and thorough when it comes to finding mistakes)! That said, I&#39;m surprised you had read mine before and enjoyed them. I&#39;m happy you enjoyed those two particular scenes; I had a clear idea of what to do with the fairy at the time, and once I figured out exactly what to do with the charging scene to not make the charge list be a giant paragraph I rolled with it.<br><br>I could have gone with that route regarding Remus (and Sirius as well, for that matter), but I had decided early on that all the characters given as canon characters were going to stay that way in the treatment of the fic in the mission because while they- Remus and Sirius especially!- were subject to being terribly OOC when the Sues were present, the fic was very determined to stay on track for OotP despite the presence of the Sues, especially whenever they weren&#39;t around. <br><br>And thank you for pointing those out! I&#39;ve prodded at the document to fix those, which should be reflected in the published version shortly (and will be on the DW archive when I update that). </p>

            <p>&#39;Blast&#39; is moderately literal here: I made the mistake/commendable decision of reading through all of Library&#39;s <i>previous</i> missions to get her and July back in my head. Might&#39;ve been a bad choice - it kind of burned me out before I reached the new one.<br><br>I went into this with a vague feeling I&#39;d seen it before; I&#39;d swear I remember a Library-JF mission. But this swiftly confirmed that I hadn&#39;t. ^_^ I liked the... I guess <i>lack</i> of interplay between JF and Library: JF in particular let everything Library said bounce right off her. I really felt for Library in that last line: &quot;JF is <i>terrible</i>, and I truly mean <i>terrible</i>... er, when it comes to water.&quot; ;)<br><br>Not a whole lot to say, really; my head isn&#39;t in a very mission-reading place right now, but given the historic nature of this one, I couldn&#39;t let it pass without reading and commenting.

            <p>Burnout&#39;s never good.

I&#39;m glad you liked that aspect, by the way! A lack of interacting on the same level is as distinctive as actual interaction, and since I started working on this way back when I&#39;ve been worried about if JF would come off as far too annoying to the reader, due to JF being, well, JF, and Library being the POV character for the majority of the mission.<br><br>And I truly appreciate you taking the time to read it!<br><br>(Pettigrew- because out of all of the lot to have offspring a different age in this fic, of course it makes sense for it to be Peter Pettigrew to have a child who&#39;d&#39;ve had to have been either conceived or born while they were all still at Hogwarts.)</p>

            <p>Concrit-wise, I feel like there was a lot of badfic and what the agents were doing was just kinda sketched in. Also... er, I think you missed a target. The Counts got burned up, and Library shot Patience, and Lydia was both shot and burned... but what happened to Sevena (which is an incredibly dumb and annoying name)?

            <p>I think it probably has something to do with the way the quotes are often blended into your writing. My brain reads a single sentence or paragraph and doesn&#39;t distinguish which parts were in italics, so it seems like there&#39;s more badfic than there actually is.<br><br>As for sketching in, it&#39;s a couple of things. One, it seems like you let the badfic do a lot of the description for you, especially when it comes to the setting. Or maybe there just isn&#39;t much description, period. Meaning, I know the setting is Grimmauld Place, and sometimes there are curtains, and sometimes there&#39;s a table or a bed, and if the fic goes to a corridor there&#39;s a corridor, but that&#39;s about it. ... Which sounds dumb when I write it out, because it&#39;s not like I expect elaborate detail about everyday objects like a table. It&#39;s a table, it&#39;s got four legs and a top, there are chair legs and feet around the sides. But, when the agents are hiding behind the drapes, for instance, they spend some time there, and it might be good to know more about them. Are they black drapes? Are they heavy and ornate, or thin and filmy? Are there holes in them? Do they smell of mildew, mothballs, dust, something else? How well can the agents actually see out, or at all, for that matter? Is there a window behind them, or just the wall that Library smacks the Doxy into?<br><br>Two, there are long stretches of &quot;couple lines of badfic - couple lines of agents reacting - line of badfic - line of agents reacting,&quot; etc. Most of what we get about the agents in those stretches is dialogue. There ARE points where you describe how they&#39;re positioned relative to each other and the setting, and interacting with each, which is good, but in general I had trouble connecting with them as physical beings in a physical environment. Which goes back to point one, I guess.<br><br>Also, we don&#39;t really get inside their heads much. Taking the drapes sequence as an example again, I know Library is annoyed and possibly in pain when the Doxy bites her because I see her teeth grinding and her eye twitching, but I guess I&#39;d like to know more about what she&#39;s thinking in that moment. Also, I don&#39;t remember the effects of a Doxy bite and I&#39;m assuming people who aren&#39;t Iximaz might not, either, so filling in the pain and whatever other effects she&#39;s experiencing would be a good way to flesh out that passage more. You don&#39;t say where she was bitten, either, which leaves a big blank spot in my mental image of the story.<br><br>Another thing missing from early in the mission is their disguises. JF complains that they&#39;re not students, and Library comments that the students wear Muggle clothes during the holidays, but you don&#39;t say how they&#39;re actually disguised. Did they use disguises at all, even?<br><br>So, all in all, there&#39;s not too much badfic, really—just not enough of what I&#39;d like to know about the agents and what&#39;s happening to them.<br><br>Formatting errors:<br><br>1. &quot;You can stop sounding off, we’ll go on the mission as soon as she’s clean and dressed. ” <br>2. Missing line break between the paragraphs beginning &quot;I don‘t know why we couldn‘t be disguised as students&quot; and &quot;This ‘story’ doesn‘t take place anywhere near Hogwarts.&quot; There&#39;s also three backwards single-quotes in there. (This is why I don&#39;t use so-called smart quotes.)<br><br>3. Speaking of which: &quot;considering the &#39;artist&#39;&#39;s attention span&quot; <br>4. Missing line break between “Yes.” and “Also the half-vampire isn’t stupid because she’s an American, but because she’s a half-vampire so can I charge for that too?” (Also, you want commas around &quot;so can I charge for that&quot;.)<br><br>5. This may not actually be in error, but I noticed that some badfic passages only have single line-breaks between paragraphs?<br><br>6. Hyphens where there should be em dashes throughout. (You can teach Gdocs how to make em dashes from double hyphens by adding to its autocorrect, FYI.)<br><br>7. The following passages have extra first-line indentation:<br><br> “Yeah, I cou- hey, wait!”<br><br>The older agent suppressed a smile. 
<br>...<br><br> “Uh, I can cook a mean one?”<br><br>        Library sighed. “Stakes, not steak.”<br><br>        “Ohhh. ...Can I use fire instead?”<br><br>        “I suppose.” 
<br>...<br><br> Snape asked her to at least try, [etc.]<br><br>        He accepted, and the two left. [etc.] 
<br>...<br><br> Patience and her also uncanonical mother had a dramatic scene [etc.] 
<br>...<br><br> Library sighed, kicked out her leg, and was soon rewarded with an ‘Ow!’ when her heel met JF’s shoulder. “Stay there.”<br><br>        “But but but but Snape just used a judo throw on her! And I wanna kill her!” 
<br>...<br><br>The entire post-mission sequence after the horizontal rule <i>except</i> these lines:<br><br> “Stay here and don’t set anything on fire.” She wasn’t entirely sure that JF would be able to manage even that, though.<br><br>“Fine,” and with that, JF immediately slouched into a chair. 
<br>... I think that&#39;s it.<br><br>I hope that&#39;s all helpful and not just upsetting. I do agree with the good things other people have said, btw, and above and beyond anything else, it&#39;s really nice to have you back in action. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I was doing the blending to try and make the difference between mission and fic not quite as jarring, since the fic and everything going on within <i>are</i> taking place and is the location. As for the descriptions, I do get what you mean; I was mostly taking my cues from the badfic itself there for how much to go on, since that information wasn&#39;t there either, so that&#39;s certainly on me.<br><br>For the Talking Heads point: Again, duly noted. <br><br>Regarding the disguises: They didn&#39;t use disguises since the fic was set during the summer hols, which gave leeway. I apologise for not pointing that out.<br><br>I&#39;ll keep the noted formatting bits in mind for when I can access the document again. That&#39;s going to be in a few weeks, though.<br><br>And finally:<br><br>I will admit, that between yours and PC&#39;s (who I am going to respond to hopefully today as well) especially, it rather does sting; while I did ask for concrit I wasn&#39;t actually expecting to get taken apart to this extent. <br><br>On the other hand, more than half of this fic was written in 2008 itself, and it was finished with the aim of finishing it, rather than rewriting it to be as good as I <i>could</i> make it. (Which I realize isn&#39;t the greatest of things to do, but again, the goal was to just complete it so it&#39;d be available and officially part of my spinoff&#39;s timeline.)  I know I&#39;ve grown plenty as both a writer and reader, and that was the main reason I had wanted to edit all my old stuff to try and bring it up to par. (Because after this, I&#39;d be reluctant to see what would be said for concrit for the stuff that was 100% written in 2007 and 2008! Yikes!)<br><br>That said, I&#39;m going to take the (mostly relative) comparative lack of criticism from the scene involving Remus onwards to heart (while using the rest to fix the technical issues) because everything from that point on was actually written this year. <br><br>-July, more than lightly singed</p>

            <p>Neshomeh probably means the double-indentation of single-line paragraphs following other single-line paragraphs. Look at the parts of the mission <br>between &quot;That is a terrible insult,&quot; and &quot;Tut, tut, cousin,&quot;<br>and between &quot;How good are you with stakes?&quot; and &quot;They left behind a small glittery dusting&quot; <br>and between &quot;I&#39;m not going!&quot; and &quot;Snape told his uncanonical sister to leave&quot;<br>and then again in the post-mission part.<br><br>HG<br></p>

            <p>I love the moments when it drops into JF&#39;s thought processes.  It&#39;s like she sees the world in surreal pretentious badfic-o-vision, I love it!<br><br>I&#39;m also rather glad we got a son-of-P* agent out of this mission.

            <p>Thank you.<br><br>JF is all impulse and in the moment and not one for thinking beyond that (or before, for that matter). And she did come from a not-so-well thought out fic herself, so I figured it made sense.<br><br>And given how many of them were swarming around, and the fact that he was the most relatively innocuous, I figured on snatching him in. I&#39;m sure by now he&#39;s usable as a veteran agent. :P<br><br>And I&#39;m glad you felt that way! I was trying to illustrate it, but wasn&#39;t sure how well I got it across, considering I didn&#39;t have much time to work with without making it too long- the parts with Lupin and then again right before the charge scene were what took the longest- years, without joking. </p>

            <p>Hoom, hoom.<br><br><b>Activity:</b> I know you, no knee-jerk reactions, you&#39;ve been around. <br><br><b>PPC knowledge:</b> Your agent profiles are problematic in this respect.<br><br>James&#39; recruitment story makes no sense. First of all, if an agent can&#39;t find a plothole a canon character&#39;s been shoved into, they have no business being out in the field doing solo missions. Any decent agent would not have told a bit about the PPC, much less made a deal with them, unless they planned on recruiting them, are on the verge of charging and killing them, or will neuralyze them afterwards. Since you say Emma meant to &#39;pacify&#39; him, I assume she was going to kill him, which means she should have never accepted his deal on the first place, and if she was planning on killing him, it means his character was bad enough to not be recruited in the first place.<br><br><b>Fic to spork:</b> Yeah, that&#39;s a doozy, aright.<br><br><b>Writing ability (creative):</b> Um... your prompts are fine. I didn&#39;t find them particularly interesting, but that might be because I had a bad day at the army. Your agent profiles aren&#39;t. The Sue&#39;s behaviour in James&#39; backstory doesn&#39;t make sense — I haven&#39;t seen lots of Sues that let bits upstage them like that; I&#39;ve already mentioned the recruitment process; and Emma&#39;s background seems borderline Sue-ish to me (mainly because recruiting a random someone off the Internet is a very stupid thing for a secret society to do).<br><br><b>Writing ability (technical):</b> much better than the previous attempt, and you obviously got your pieces beta&#39;d for SPaG. You do have a couple problems (I spotted at least one tense shift, and there&#39;s stuff like &quot;into the PPC Headquarters&quot; — the &#39;the&#39; shouldn&#39;t be there), so maybe another beta is warranted.<br><br>That said...<br>Rina Dives appears in your control prompt. This, in and of itself, is good — I like intertextuality! What <i>is</i> bad is that she is OOC. Furthermore, I have it from Iximaz that you did not let her see the final product before publishing it. This is a <i>faux pas</i> — if you borrow other people&#39;s characters, you are <u>obliged</u> to let them check for OOC and the like.<br><br>So: Permission Denied. Your characters need more work, your SPaG and/or beta&#39;ing process should be touched up, and that last issue bothers me immensely. While you have made progress, you are still not ready, methinks.</p>

            <p>I read on to chapter ten. She officially got me mad when she claimed to have been cut by a shard of Gimli&#39;s axe so badly that she passed out from blood loss, and yet neither of the trained healers she talked to beforehand noticed the heavy, probably arterial bleeding until it was too late. And then despite such a serious wound, they still let her go on the quest and it&#39;s like it never happened. Not to mention the fact that getting hit with the shard in the first place is enough to make her cry, despite aforementioned 500 years of torture.<br><br>Not to mention the Boromir-bashing and casting Elrond as some sort of rules tyrant.

            <p>I made my way down into the vaults beneath Dol Guldur, hurrying as much as I could but dawdling as much as I dared.  My Master&#39;s summons had been urgent yet ominous.  If he were planning to take full control of my mind again, robbing me of what little free will he had recently gifted me, then I was in no rush.  At the same time, I feared angering him into taking such a decision.<br><br>Fortunately, my fears were for naught.  My Master was intently studying some papers on his desk and didn&#39;t notice my arrival.  I waited just in the chamber entrance, uncertain of whether to cough or speak to draw his attention.  I even glanced down to make sure I was wearing my robes, though he of all people was able to see us without them.<br><br>After what seemed an age, he raised his head.  Although his helmet concealed his face, as usual, there was something about his movement that suggested his brow was creased with worry.  &quot;Do you have any idea how much it costs to run an army?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, my liege.&quot;  I stepped forward into the room.<br><br>&quot;A lot.&quot;  He paused.  &quot;More than I can afford, it seems?&quot;<br><br>&quot;But what about the pillaging, sire?  Doesn&#39;t the army pay for itself after a while?&quot;  No sooner had the words slipped from my mouth than I wanted to bite my tongue.  Who was I to question my Master?<br><br>Thankfully it must have amused him to tolerate my rash words.  &quot;Oh, it will pay, eventually, once the war starts in earnest.  But until then, my funds are in short supply.  What I believe the humans call a &#39;cash-flow problem&#39;.&quot;  He pronounced the unfamiliar words with undisguised contempt, then paused and sighed before continuing.  &quot;I&#39;ve even been forced to start a second job as a Necromancer to raise a bit of extra money.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A wise move, my liege,&quot; I said hoping to make up for my earlier words.<br><br>&quot;No.  It was a bloody stupid move.  I totally misunderstood the &#39;target consumer base demographic&#39;.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sire?&quot;  I tilted my head, trying to read the papers on the desk, hoping they might explain the strange jargon.<br><br>&quot;Look at where we are.  To one side is Mirkwood, and the other is Lothlórien.  We&#39;re surrounded by Elves.  Immortal Elves.  The one people who have no use for any Necromancy!&quot;  He slammed his gauntleted fist down on the desk.  &quot;What was I thinking?&quot;<br><br>Uncertain of what to say, I made a vague shrugging gesture, and waited for him to continue.<br><br>&quot;However, I have a new plan.&quot;  He rose from his seat and started to pace the chamber.  &quot;Elves breed rarely, and when they do the children grow slowly.  This means that the parents need to give them care for many more years than parents of other races, and that they hardly ever have the experience needed to provide such care.&quot;<br><br>&quot;True, sire, but I fail to see...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Simple.  My latest business venture is an exclusive, upmarket boarding school for children of Elven nobility.  We&#39;ll charge a top-whack, premium fee to look after their little brats all the way from birth to adulthood.&quot;  Pride filled his voice, and he stood, hands on hips looking at me.  &quot;Our first pupil is due to arrive later today - Nyssa or Nessa or something like that - and there are more to follow.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How are you proposing to raise these children, my liege?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Me?  I&#39;m not planning to have anything to do with them at all, if I can help it.  I&#39;m heading back to Barad-dûr, putting as much distance between myself and them as possible.&quot;  He extended one arm towards me.  &quot;That&#39;s why I sent for you, Khamûl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;M-m-me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, I&#39;m promoting you.  Congratulations.  You&#39;re the new lieutenant of Dol Guldur, in charge of running this place in my absence.  Good luck.&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>My prose style is a clunky, clumsy mess.<br><br>Let&#39;s take the sentence I hated the most:  <i>&quot;If he were planning to take full control of my mind again, robbing me of what little free will he had recently gifted me, then I was in no rush.&quot;</i><br><br>Even I can see that&#39;s really, really bad prose.

            <p>So I was thinking, we have a fair few agents recruited from various continua right?  Lets say that A is from universe X, X is narrowly defined continua, what would happen if A gets a mission to X and were to meet themselves?  Something kind of similar to what happened during &quot;Father&#39;s Day&quot; with the Ninth Doctor.<br><br>I imagine that something bad would happen, but what that something is, I do not know.  I am wondering what you all think?  Hypothetically if it did happen, what would be the result?  </p>

            <p>I&#39;m actually part way through an interlude that sort of touches on your question.

            <p>Or what would happen if a paradox was created.  I was thinking that it would create something akin to Reapers from as seen in &quot;Father&#39;s Day&quot;, of course that is slightly tied to a character arc.

And I was trying to devise a situation where the Time Lord would find the need to open the fob watch, and a temporal paradox came to mind.<br><br> </p>

            <p>Sadly, it will have failed its objective. See, when it was launched, the idea was for it to &#39;explore the only unexplored planet in the solar system&#39; - yup, when the mission was launched, Pluto was still a planet.* I wonder if anyone bothered to tell the probe that it&#39;s not going to be looking at a planet anymore?<br><br>If <i>I&#39;d</i> spent 9 years getting somewhere to look at a planet, I&#39;d feel pretty silly if I got there only to discover that there weren&#39;t any planets nearby.

            <p>We&#39;re not in a &#39;passenger liners to the planets&#39; setting; the Deep Space Network doesn&#39;t go out past Jupiter, for instance. So while there&#39;s a few science colonies in the Jovian system, there&#39;s no massive community to allow for &#39;in the area&#39;. And besides, they&#39;d surely have joined us for the Io landings!<br><br>But... with a tweak, it could work. Posting the Io Report could have got new PPC converts in the Jovian area - it&#39;d presumably be fairly big news, since tourists don&#39;t normally go and wander through volcanoes! And given the sort of person who joins the PPC (slightly awkward geeky nerds ^_~), it&#39;s not unreasonable to postulate a few <i>former</i> PPCers who get nostalgic over the Report and decide to tag along for the next trip.<br><br>So that works.

            <p>I&#39;ll admit, the Orion drive is kinda cool. But is it really the best ship to use in this case? Quoting from the very page that you yourself linked: <i>The sad little secret about Orion is that the mission it is best suited for is boosting heavy payloads into orbit. Which is exactly the mission that the enviromentalist and the nuclear test ban treaty will prevent. Orion has excellent thrust, which is what you need for lift-off and landing. Unfortunately its exhaust velocity is pretty average, which is what you need for efficient orbit-to-orbit maneuvers.</i><br><br>And you are talking about an orbit-to-orbit transfer. <br><br>Finally, I couldn&#39;t let any conversation involving project rho go by without a link to my favourite page: <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/usefultables.php#id--The_Boom_Table">the Boom Table</a> :)<br><br>Because what could be more useful than a comparative list showing the destructive potential of a bunch of real life, theoretically possible and definitely impossible weapons?<br><br>- Irish  </p>

            <p>Because I&#39;ve got a nice set of pictures of it. ^<em>^ Seriously, you&#39;re right - Orion is a pretty terrible design, efficiency-wise. But this ain&#39;t a hard sci-fi novel. ^</em>~<br><br>In fact, it&#39;s probably viewed as inefficient even in the setting - they&#39;re willing to hire one out to a bunch of geeks who decided to go to Pluto on a whim! I think I described it as &#39;left-over&#39; (though whether that&#39;s from a war or a construction operation, I don&#39;t know), and I think that&#39;s accurate. We&#39;re not taking an Orion because we wanted an Orion - we&#39;re taking one because it&#39;s what was available.<br><br>The Boom Table is fantastic, and I can&#39;t believe I missed it before. ^_^ Thank you!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I mean, it&#39;s a report on us riding a wave of nuclear bombs to <i>Pluto</i>; discussing the state of affairs back in England is probably quite a long way from our thoughts (unless something seriously dramatic happens, but that&#39;d leave me in an Eleven PPCers Lost In Space scenario, which isn&#39;t what this is about).<br><br>But yeah, I can probably mention people who&#39;ve explicitly said they <i>aren&#39;t</i> there; the question is whether to name anyone who <i>is</i>.

            <p>I&#39;m still editing my first mission after the list of what needed to be fixed was presented. But there&#39;s at least one thing on that list I don&#39;t understand. As it was written:<br><br>&quot;the agents falling through plotholes and time warps is a bit odd — generally, agents are dragged along by the story. The plotholes especially is a little odd. Falling through a time warp sounds fine to at least one of us as a spin-off-specific thing (assuming there was, in fact, a time warp/distortion there).&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t understand the problem with them falling through plot holes, because in a few stories I&#39;ve seen instances where an agent <i>would</i> fall through a plot hole. I can&#39;t remember which exact ones, but I do remember reading that this happened.<br><br>Also, since there was a concern on this:<br><br>&quot;time compression ran rampant on the agents&#39; end. They slept, what, three times in this? We didn&#39;t get the sense they were in the fic for very long.&quot;<br><br>…does anyone have any tips on how to combat this, and get out of the Talking Head Syndrome? Tips to give them more to do, and how to make that smooth?</p>

            <p>A plothole is... well, a hole in the plot! Sometimes they&#39;re literal holes, which missing characters fall down. Sometimes they&#39;re temporal distortions (&#39;time warps&#39;), such as a story which suggests you can fly from Coruscant to Tatooine in five minutes. Sometimes they&#39;re geographical aberrations, such as the ever-popular magical forest which shouldn&#39;t exist, or a spatial distortion (which is just a different way of naming a temporal distortion - indeed, I usually go for &#39;temporal-spatial&#39;). Sometimes they&#39;re less physical: a Suvian with hair made of literal fire is clearly using a plothole to keep from, uh, burning, but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a literal hole somewhere.<br><br>What they <i>aren&#39;t</i> is a manifestation of a scene change, which I guess is what you were using them as. Scene-changes aren&#39;t holes/problems with the plot - they&#39;re a natural part of writing. Very few stories don&#39;t have any skips at all.<br><br>PPC agents usually move along through the story by one of... three or four methods.<br><br>1/ They have to travel everywhere on foot. So if the fic says &#39;ten days later&#39;, the agents follow the characters for ten days.<br><br>2/ They get dragged through scene changes. &#39;Ten days later&#39; throws them forward ten days.<br><br>3/ They portal to avoid (1).<br><br>4/ When the story produces a temporal-spatial distortion, they hitch a ride on it. So if the Fellowship claims to reach Moria in a day from Rivendell, the agents follow closely in order to ride on that effect, rather than walking the actual distance.<br><br>(4) is the only one that can really be called &#39;falling through a plothole&#39;, and from your/their description, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you were doing.<br><br>Does that help?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Not all plot holes are temporal-spatial distortions, of course.<br><br>I remember in the Original Series, after the assassination of Arwen!Sue, the real one was found in a plot hole in Elrond&#39;s liquor cabinet; the plot hole, of course, is that Elrond is not in fact a raging drunk.<br><br>Plot holes happen through logical inconsistencies, either between the canon and the fic, within the fic itself, or--occasionally--naturally in the canon (stable, canonical plot holes? Hmm.)<br><br>And of course the portal generator works on plot hole technology, with the plot holes made visible for safety and convenience&#39;s sake. A natural plot hole looks more like a heat shimmer or a minor distortion.<br><br>The impression I get is that most plot holes don&#39;t lead much of anywhere. Most seem to produce a small pocket universe. Some lead to the opposite end of a time or space anomaly. Most may be small and unremarkable enough to be unusable for travel. And it&#39;s likely that minis arrive through plot holes of their own, created by their misspellings--unstable plot holes that collapse after creating the mini, since the canon with the mini is more stable than the canon with the plot hole.<br><br>(I assume that canons seek stability because of the way MLP reacts to DAVD-type horror fic, and how many characters resist influence. Maybe the minis are manifestations of the canon&#39;s attempt to seek stability by creating a &quot;character&quot; to match the misspelling; and of course this character is usually a monster, because the canon is a bit pissed at being mistreated.)<br><br>Which makes me wonder... could the portal generator be used to create a pocket-universe-style plot hole? I suppose it could, but maybe that would just destabilize the continuum further. Better to portal to a hidden location and leave the portal open to look through it.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s based on whichever canon the name comes from. The only reason hybrids come about is if a crossover can&#39;t tell which canon the name came from, because it&#39;s the same or similar. There was a mini-Baragog once.</p>

            <p>But I don&#39;t think Silenthunder was having them trip into canon-holding plotholes? I can&#39;t see any reason someone would raise that as a problem, either - though it wouldn&#39;t do much to progress the story.<br><br>Given the way the portal generator works (by literally writing a snippet of dodgy story and projecting it into the world), I suppose it <i>could</i> be used for universe generation: &#39;the generator whirred, and by altering the movement of the fish in a fishtank far away opened a gateway to a magical pocket universe&#39;. But you&#39;d have to hack the console to get that to happen - the Remote Activator seems to just allow you to input coordinates.<br><br>Also, Makes-Things might get very upset. And nobody wants to see him cry, do they? :(<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Otherwise I would&#39;ve said something in my first post, neh? ^_~<br><br>I don&#39;t think &#39;fill up time&#39; is what you really need to do; that sounds too much like padding, which is a bad thing (PPC missions don&#39;t need to be longer than they already usually are!). What you need to do is <i>convey the passage of time better</i>. If they&#39;re sleeping three times, that means they&#39;re spending four days in the fic, with a day between each sleep cycle. If that &#39;day&#39; just consists of &#39;let&#39;s watch this scene and gripe about it&#39;, it feels weird.<br><br>So have them walk places. Have them wander off and look around while the fic does something long-winded and boring (&#39;Arabethel had a relaxing three-hour bath&#39;). Have them forced to sit in one place for hours on end to keep track of things. It doesn&#39;t need much writing, just... y&#39;know, the passage of time.<br><br>Ultimately, it&#39;s about picturing what your agents would be physically doing, and then making sure that a) is realistic, and b) is conveyed on the page.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So then.<br><br>Most of you are aware that I come up with crazy ideas. Most of you are also aware that they&#39;re terrible ones.

            <p>My advice would be to put the ideas somewhere you&#39;ll remember them. I just tuck them in a spare corner of my brain, but writing it down might work for other people. Revisit them later. If they&#39;re still seeming irredeemably terrible later, then discard them if you like. <br><br>I understand your need for validation, and I&#39;m not saying that in a &quot;but now I&#39;m going to dismiss it&quot; way. I understand it pretty viscerally. It might be a spectrum thing, it might not, but I always feel this pressure to be *helpful* to people in some way. I know my writing depends on me talking ideas over with people, because that&#39;s how I refine ideas. Yours might as well.<br><br>I *know* the urge to do something new and exciting. Brains jump around. Most of my ideas aren&#39;t that great either.  I can&#39;t help you with it, but it sounds like you need to have a talk with your brain and figure out whether you want new or whether it wants new. <br><br>And sometimes &quot;oh no, my writing is awful&quot; is just the curse of writing, but it does still hurt. :/</p>

            <p>New and crazy doesn&#39;t <i>have</i> to automatically mean bad - but it doesn&#39;t automatically mean good, either.  You seem to come up with a lot of ideas and just run with them.  Maybe it would be better to focus on really exploring and fleshing out an idea, rather than just throwing it out there?<br><br>Also, new ideas are good, but you seem to want to do something that&#39;ll leave an impact.  Which I think you should focus on doing through good writing and memorable characters, not wild ideas.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve given up on the whole &quot;leaving an impact&quot; thing. I&#39;ve kinda resigned myself to the fact that I&#39;m probably not going to.<br><br>And sometimes I have an idea that I just can&#39;t work with. For instance, I&#39;ve had this Time Lord idea continually resurface in my head. I get rid of it every time it pops up, because I&#39;m no Doctor Who expert. If I don&#39;t know the canon, I can&#39;t expect to write someone native to it.<br><br>And all of my crazy ideas <i>have</i> been bad ones.

            <p>No one can truly determine in advance whether or not they&#39;ll leave an impact.  For me, at least, you already have.<br><br>Well, maybe just try writing them out and see how you like them?  You don&#39;t have to use everything you write out - like I&#39;m probably going to end up cutting most of my semi-obscure Fate references - but just do it for the personal experience to get the idea out.  Plus, then you can use the parts you do like for other things.  For example, I think you could have just cut the &quot;Shades of Rose&quot; thing from the one mission and used the rest.</p>

            <p>So, today I was messaging my friend and they stated they hate the Minions. Being the weird person I am I jokingly responded with: <br>&#39;//sighs// Okay then. How about the dinosaurs from Jurassic World crossover with the Minions and then eat them.&#39;<br><br>Now I&#39;m writing a fanficiton about said crossover and I don&#39;t know how that even happened.

            <p>I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re keeping up with it. This has happened in my sphere of consciousness before, and when it does, the party on what I will for lack of a better term call your side tend to find something that doesn&#39;t make sense to them (or is outdated research), cry &quot;Aha! All evolutionary theory is without merit!&quot;, and go on as before, having learned nothing save some facts, which as learning goes is minor. The important thing about good science is that it teaches you how to think critically about things - and you can apply it to Biblical literature as well.<br><br>As an aside, Biblical literalism is very much an American phenomenon, and I&#39;m not entirely certain why. One wagers it&#39;s down to the Baptists - a Southern acquaintance of mine described Baptist teaching as &quot;If that&#39;s what the preacher man said, that&#39;s what the Bible done said.&quot; Though he may have been taking the mickey a little bit. =]</p>

Well, I currently attend a Baptist church, but I don&#39;t consider myself a Baptist. They&#39;re a bunch of very nice people, and they punch above their weight in helping the community as a whole. It is, however, an unfortunate trend in the church for people to simply believe what they&#39;re told about the Bible, and not actually read it themselves. I wish I could change it. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s a more modern thing, though; go back a few decades and the Bible was read fairly regularly. And the trend might not be present in all churches. I&#39;ve only regularly attended two denominations, Nazarene and Baptist, so I can&#39;t speak for the others. Even within those, I haven&#39;t asked anyone, &quot;Hey, how often did you read your Bible this week?&quot; <br><br>Really, don&#39;t quote me on this; it&#39;s far from hard fact.

            <p>Specifically, to the <i>innumerable</i> wars fought between Christians and, well, everyone else.

            <p>I&#39;ll look into them.

            <p>A good place to start would be <i>The Map That Changed the World </i>by Simon Winchester.  It&#39;s not directly about evolution as such, but explains what the cutting edge, state-of-the art of Victorian science was just before Darwin published his work.  It&#39;s also just a great book, and well worth reading for its own sake.<br><br>IMHO one of the best books about evolution is <i>Wonderful Life </i>by Stephen Jay Gould.  It was written in the 1990s so one or two specific details are a little bit out of date (especially about the Punctuated Equilibrium version of evolution) but it gives a wide overview of the whole picture.  And there are lots and lots of examples of how scientists worked out exactly where different fossils fit into the tree of life.<br><br>If you really feel you have to read a Richard Dawkins, make it <i>The Blind Watchmaker</i>, one of his very early books when he was still writing proper science and not just indulging in gratuitous religion bashing.<br><br>And after Dawkins, you&#39;ll definitely need something from the religious evolutionists&#39; perspective.  Although its not a book, <a href="https://letterstocreationists.wordpress.com/2015/07/09/exposing-the-roots-of-young-earth-creationism/">this webpage</a> is a history of the split between creationism and religious evolutionism.  (Warning: it&#39;s a very, very long page, and just when you think you&#39;ve reached the end, you realise you&#39;ve just started a new section.)<br><br>Hope those are useful.<br></p>

            <p>So, I&#39;m a fan of Renaissance Fairs and the like, and I decided my next costume would be Lady Iximaz&#39;s Baronial Council dress. After four days of cutting, pinning, re-pinning, yelling at the sleeves (oh gods above those sleeves were a nightmare), and stitching, my mom and I managed to finish it. Well, mostly. It still needs to be hemmed to the proper length, but other than that, it is done. :D<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jHUrjzU.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/jHUrjzU.png"> <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/knOOyTG.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/knOOyTG.png"> <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PaVaVmB.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/PaVaVmB.png"> <br><br>And yes, it really is as hot and heavy as it looks.</p>

            <p>I like how this outfit looks simple but when you look at it a little closer, it&#39;s got lots of details (the trim, the pattern of the green fabric, and yes, THOSE SLEEVES) and you seem to find something new each time you look at it again.<br><br>Say, may I ask how long it took to make the costume? I could use a frame of reference if I ever make Skaer&#39;morys&#39;s outfit in the future! XD</p>

            <p>Of course, there&#39;s other factors to take into account, because mom and I worked from pretty much ten in the morning to ten at night (we brought snacks upstairs and nibbled while we worked), then there&#39;s going to be differences in the complexity of the pattern, et cetera.</p>

            <p>Baron Huinesoron has <b>never</b> tried to extend the borders of his barony. He&#39;s never tried to claim, invent, or exert the least authority over anything outside those borders. The only expansion he tried to undertake was of Ozerbord, to encompass the &#39;tax havens&#39;. He&#39;s pretty much let Thanasius do his own thing down in Skypcht, despite the theoretical authority of the Protectorship, too.<br><br>He may <b>sound</b> like he thinks he knows best and wants to rule everything (heh, wonder who he gets <i>that</i> from... ^<em>~), but if you listen to what he&#39;s actually <i>saying</i>, he&#39;s pretty much resigned himself to sitting in a draughty, empty castle and trying to prod people into doing his job for him. The Riding exists to make it easier for other people to go to war; the recent election (if he actually had anything to do with it) exists to get other people to actually do stuff at the Baronial Council.<br><br>So while he may occasionally suffer bursts of optimism and dress up, I&#39;m pretty sure he spends most of his time sulking in his chair in whatever clothes were to hand. ^</em>~<br><br>(Within an hour of me first mentioning it, she emailled me and pre-emptively refused. ^_^)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Excluding magic, I guess Lady Iximaz will fight best in tall grass or heavily wooded area. If I may critique her armament, at least in fic, having a wooden buckler may help her stand multiple opponents or defeat a Marizu without actually killing them, if she wanted. Shields were often used to knock people off as much as it is used for blocking. But a steel buckler shines, and may give her position away if she is trying to ambush on a sunny day.<br><br>By the way, you actually stitch all these yourself? I am impressed.

            <p>*claps hands*<br>Can I get your attention, please?<br><br>A community decision is required about the nature of the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Assassination_Methods">Assassination Methods</a> page in the wiki.<br>There was a... disagreement as to whether some assassination methods should be on the page or not. What we need is a clear guideline for adding methods to the page. I propose the following:<br><br>What we want here is things like:<br>-&#39;stabs of fear and jealousy&#39; used to impale a Sue<br>-Sue being portal&#39;ed to a ship before it gets blown up by giant magical lasers<br>-Drinking from a false Grail<br><br>In other words,<br>-special stuff;<br>-ironic stuff (being fed to the mini the Sue used as a shoe, the Sues being tarred and feathered and given to the mob after proclaiming that they&#39;re pirates);<br>-TOS stuff;<br>-rare things (being fed to Fenrir Greyback).<br><br>What we don&#39;t want is the everyday, banal methods: pointy objects, guns, pushing Sues off tall places, snapping their necks, etc. Furthermore, we do not want countless entries of the same methods — we want the notable ones.<br><br>Is this a good guideline? Are there better ones? What should we do with the page?<br></p>

            <p>My only issue with the methods page is people putting mundane things on it. There doesn&#39;t need to be a whole big &quot;whoo let&#39;s vote to see if this makes it on&quot; stink every time someone wants to add.

            <p>Just a regular disagreement, really.<br><br>But, anyway.

            <p>Honestly, I say just let the page contain whatever people want to add.  It&#39;s one of the least informational pages on the Wiki: it&#39;s just for fun, so let people add their shove-off-mountains and stab-in-faces and shoot-in-foots, if they&#39;re proud of them.<br><br>Frankly, I think we have enough pages throughout the Wiki that &quot;need&quot; to be maintained as new missions come out, and I don&#39;t fancy this one being added to that list.  (I didn&#39;t even know I had my own assassination on this page until I saw it on there just now.)  Let&#39;s leave this one as a silly, informal &quot;throw it on, if it please ya&quot; page, and not create a need for regular debates about whether an assassination is or isn&#39;t notable.</p>

            <p>I agree with the listed terms. Assassinations happen in a majority of missions, and attempting to list every method is simply unfeasible and more hassle than it would ever be worth. If an assassination is listed on the page, it needs to be due to unique circumstances, a notable target, or extraordinary creativity from the agents.</p>

            <p>One of &quot;notable&quot; assassination methods (the current page) and a catalog of all assassinations. Briefly described, of course. That way we have a compilation of interesting methods, and a handy reference list that&#39;ll give all sorts of cool data, like the most common method of assassination in different continua. It will help keep us original, and think of new ways to assassinate Sues. <br><br>That being said, making the new list would be pretty hard. Someone would have to go through all of the missions and record the Sues&#39; demise, and in a certain order. If such a page were made, I would suggest that a post be made asking all authors to make a list of their killed Sues and the ways they died. That would hopefully eliminate a fair share of active Boarders, leaving the inactive and those who simply didn&#39;t see the post. Do we have an up-to-date list of all PPCers? </p>

            <p>Because if we get rid of the boring and mundane, then it really is not an Assassination Methods Page, it would instead be a Cool and Unusual Method Page.  And having a general catalog is not a terrible idea.  <br><br>I am thinking of it as a kind of record, of all successfully accomplished missions.  So something like Name of Sue, Name of Agent, Death by X.  Just my two cents.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been struggling with the Board in recent weeks and I&#39;m curious to see if anyone&#39;s encountered the same problems. First off, overall loading times are completely shot. It typically takes ten to fifteen seconds for a page on the Board to load regardless of whether its a typical click through, opened in a new tab, or even just reloading. Even at its best, I&#39;m typically waiting for five seconds. At worst? Up to a minute. This is not a problem with my Internet connection. I&#39;ve checked it, it&#39;s fine.<br><br>Ads have also become more obtrusive. I&#39;ve noticed that the site is using more side scroll-in ads that cover a good chunk of the links. They can also sometimes repeatedly layer themselves, meaning that there is still an ad there even if you click the &quot;hide&quot; tab. I had eight copies of the same ad layered on top of themselves at one point. Relatedly, sometimes the site runs ads that will automatically redirect me to the App Store if I&#39;m browsing via iOS. I&#39;m sure someone will suggest that I use some sort of Ad Blocker, but making stuff for YouTube has made me dislike those programs on principle.<br><br>Has anyone else been noticing this stuff, or is it just me?</p>

When I hit the back button, the popup saying that my phone &#39;has a risk&#39; disappears, but the thing underneath remains and some sort of loading bar fills up. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m clicking on it, so I don&#39;t know where it leads. When I hit the back button again, I don&#39;t end up on the page I was trying to view (which often loads fine right before the ad comes): I&#39;m at least one page back, and have to navigate back to the page--going forward generally just brings the ad back&quot;.<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279853;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">DawnFire 1</a>]</sup><br><br>(2) &quot;Just got that full page malware/antivirus ad twice in a bloody row while trying to see Nesh&#39;s post above. Exactly the same as what I described in the first post, but twice instead of thrice. [...] antivirus ad again just now. It definitely dropped me back a page when I hit the back button. This is... a pretty high concentration, actually. Normally it doesn&#39;t happen so many times in a row... Or maybe I just get annoyed and take a break from using the Board faster.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279856;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">DawnFire 2</a>]</sup><br><br>(3) &quot;Antivirus ad again just now.

When there is and X, it just takes me to the ad&#39;s main site.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279847;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Iximaz 1</a>]</sup><br><br>(5) &quot;Ads have also become more obtrusive. I&#39;ve noticed that the site is using more side scroll-in ads that cover a good chunk of the links. They can also sometimes repeatedly layer themselves, meaning that there is still an ad there even if you click the &quot;hide&quot; tab. I had eight copies of the same ad layered on top of themselves at one point.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279832;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">PoorCynic 1</a>]</sup><br><br>(6) &quot;On both [Windows 7 and Android phone], there&#39;s also a half page ad that looks like it&#39;s for Facebook. It&#39;s annoying on mobile, because when you move down, it flickers out of sight and then comes back until you x it. On the laptop, it stays constant until xed, and is a banner at the bottom of the page. The x doesn&#39;t redirect in either case.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279853;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">DawnFire 1</a>]</sup><br><br>(7) &quot;Loading times aren&#39;t that bad, but ads are killer. To the point where I stopped using my computer to read the &#39;Board - there was just too much risk, I either had to have NoScript and Adblock, and even then I worried. So on my phone (iPhone), about 1/3 of the time, I get an ad that covers the entire screen, and can only be removed by refreshing the page and hoping it doesn&#39;t pop up next time.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279871;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">VixenMage 1</a>]</sup><br><br>(8) &quot;And now my laptop&#39;s being flooded. Seven identical ads all stacked on top of one another in one go kicked it off, and now every time I go to the main Board, I get a side-scrolling ad (or several) to deal with.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279903;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Iximaz 2</a>]</sup><br><br><hr>
<br><br>*<u>Automatic redirects</u>, which mostly seem to be seen on phones:<br><br>(9) &quot;I avoid checking the Board on my phone whenever I can because I get ad redirects or the App Store randomly opens, and it&#39;s probably the most frustrating thing I&#39;ve had the displeasure of encountering.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279847;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Iximaz 1</a>]</sup><br><br>(10) &quot;Relatedly, sometimes the site runs ads that will automatically redirect me to the App Store if I&#39;m browsing via iOS.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279832;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">PoorCynic 1</a>]</sup><br><br>(11) &quot;Moto G running Android 4.4.4.

I didn&#39;t click on anything besides Irish&#39;s post, but a redirect page (just a URL) came up and then I was redirected to the Google Play app. Now, I will give you that I watched a clip of &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; on YouTube either yesterday or the day before; that&#39;s the only connection I know of, and it seems pretty random otherwise. When I hit the back button, I ended up first back at the redirect page (which didn&#39;t redirect me again) and then on Irish&#39;s post when I hit it again. Of course, I was promptly redirected in the same way twice more from his post until I hit the reply button.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279855;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">DawnFire 3</a>]</sup><br><br>(13) &quot;I can confirm that there most certainly are auto-redirects, at least on the iPhone.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279902;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">TheShyIon 1</a>]</sup><br><br>(14) &quot;(iPhone) 1/3 of the time, I get redirected and the App Store opens.

<br><br>*The problems appear to be <u>worst on phones</u>:<br><br>(15) &quot;For whatever reason, it is significantly worse when browsing on my phone or tablet. My computer gets the pop-ups or redirects occasionally, but mobile devices seem to get them a lot - I&#39;ve basically given up reading the Board on my tablet. I&#39;ve also had the problem of some ads filling the whole screen and not having an option to close them, but only on my tablet.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279851;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the Irish Samurai 1</a>]</sup><br><br>(16) &quot;I use my phone to check the board fairly often when I&#39;m on my break, and these redirects occur, I&#39;d say, at least a third of the time when I click on a post. At worst, though, they appear at double that rate and make it nearly impossible to navigate the board since the redirects create a queue of at least three blank web pages before sending me back to the page before the one I was trying to view.&quot;<sup>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279860;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Fasoula 1</a>, with confirmation by <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279861;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Iximaz</a> and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279862;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Pippa&#39;s Ghost</a>]</sup><br><br><hr>

<br><br>The full-screen adverts may be intended to be there, I don&#39;t know, but I suspect they&#39;re supposed to always have an X button. I&#39;m nearly certain the X button isn&#39;t supposed to act as if you&#39;d clicked the advert, though that may be linked to it being on a phone. Based on what Tamara said <a href="https://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=1;article=41678;title=DiscussionApp%20Forum">here</a>, I&#39;m pretty sure the auto-redirects aren&#39;t supposed to be there.<br><br>As I said, I know that some advertising is an essential part of keeping YourWebApps free, but I&#39;m almost certain some of this behaviour is <b>not</b> what you intend to be happening.

So, whenever I’m redirected and there is no way to go back and continue what I intended to do, I report the URL, explaining in the comment that this site obviously wants to force me to do something silly no reasonable person should do, like clicking its okay-button.<br><br>This doesn’t make it go away, but it certainly undermines the ad’s purpose, because in Firefox and probably also in other browsers, the ad is replaced by a message saying that this site is not save.<br><br>Over the last twelve months, such redirects occurred less and less frequently for me. Apparently, aggressive advertisers are able to learn from experience what is acceptable and what is too annoying to work. (And apparently they are doing their aggressive advertising in the USA rather than in Germany now.) <br><br>Concerning long loading times, I don’t believe that it’s related to the new server.

            <p>To the point where I stopped using my computer to read the &#39;Board - there was just too much risk, I either had to have NoScript and Adblock, and even then I worried. So on my phone (iPhone), about 1/3 of the time, I get an ad that covers the entire screen, and can only be removed by refreshing the page and hoping it doesn&#39;t pop up next time. 1/3 of the time, I get redirected and the App Store opens. What I usually do to combat this is as soon as the content of the page loads, hit the &quot;stop loading&quot; button on the URL bar. Not always, but usually, this stops the ad from loading. <br><br>I mean, I still read the posts that interest me, but the subject lines have to clear a pretty high bar of interest for obvious reasons. :P This has been the case for about… I dunno, at least the past few months. Several months probably. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t get those problems with my computer, but I avoid checking the Board on my phone whenever I can because I get ad redirects or the App Store randomly opens, and it&#39;s probably the most frustrating thing I&#39;ve had the displeasure of encountering.<br><br>What&#39;s also frustrating is on the phone, adds randomly appear (and yes, I supposedly have them blocked), and they&#39;re so huge they fill the entire screen, and for some reason there&#39;s often no X to click, forcing me to reload the page. When there <i>is</i> and X, it just takes me to the ad&#39;s main site.<br><br>I know Darkotas has had these problems as well, which is partially why he&#39;s been asking me to relay posts while he&#39;s at camp: too much reloading involved eating up his data.</p>

            <p>Just got redirected *three times* to the Google Play Store, for a &#39;Wizard of Oz Free Slots Casino&#39; app. Not even kidding. I didn&#39;t click on anything besides Irish&#39;s post, but a redirect page (just a URL) came up and then I was redirected to the Google Play app. Now, I will give you that I watched a clip of &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot; on YouTube either yesterday or the day before; that&#39;s the only connection I know of, and it seems pretty random otherwise. When I hit the back button, I ended up first back at the redirect page (which didn&#39;t redirect me again) and then on Irish&#39;s post when I hit it again. Of course, I was promptly redirected in the same way twice more from his post until I hit the reply button. I took screenshots--same notation as my previous post.<br><br>Speaking of the previous post: that set of adx3 showed up while I was in the Plort costume thread. There&#39;s generally nothing to link the post with the ad.<br><br>Another type of annoying ad, which mainly appears on the laptop, is that random words will be hyperlinked, I think with some sort of search thing. There are also random tags at the bottom of posts, which will get little temporary popups if you hover over them. I use Chrome.<br><br>And I think that&#39;s all for now.

            <p>Interestingly, I get a similar redirect for another generic gambling app called &quot;Big Fish Casino&quot;. I know I have not watched or searched anything involving gambling, fish or the Wizard of Oz recently, so I think these are not targeted ads.<br><br>I use my phone to check the board fairly often when I&#39;m on my break, and these redirects occur, I&#39;d say, at least a third of the time when I click on a post.

            <p>I just got a full page ad (I&#39;m on mobile) three times in a row. There is no x. It&#39;s for some kind of antivirus thing, supposedly. When I hit the back button, the popup saying that my phone &#39;has a risk&#39; disappears, but the thing underneath remains and some sort of loading bar fills up. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m clicking on it, so I don&#39;t know where it leads. When I hit the back button again, I don&#39;t end up on the page I was trying to view (which often loads fine right before the ad comes): I&#39;m at least one page back, and have to navigate back to the page--going forward generally just brings the ad back. (And yes, I&#39;ve seen this one often enough now that I can say what generally happens). I&#39;ve got screenshots from it this time, and can try to get them from my phone to the Board or to an email; I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s possible.<br><br>Some more notes: on both my phone and my computer (I have Android on my phone and Windows 7 on my laptop), pages do occasionally load slowly. Sometimes it&#39;s just a delay of several more seconds than usual; other times, the page takes so long about loading that I end up closing it and trying again. A simple reload doesn&#39;t usually work.<br><br>More on ads: on my computer, there is generally an x to click, which doesn&#39;t tend to redirect me. Some of the ads I get are for shopping of some sort--I&#39;ll keep an eye out, I haven&#39;t been paying too much attention. The shopping ad sometimes pops up on my phone, and I think it can be xed out of without a redirect. On both, there&#39;s also a half page ad that looks like it&#39;s for Facebook. It&#39;s annoying on mobile, because when you move down, it flickers out of sight and then comes back until you x it. On the laptop, it stays constant until xed, and is a banner at the bottom of the page. The x doesn&#39;t redirect in either case.<br><br>There&#39;s another ad, the contents of which I don&#39;t remember right now, that sort of pops up in the middle of the screen and moves around with you, but... I&#39;m not completely sure that&#39;s actually on the Board. It may well be on one of the mission-hosting sites.<br><br>One thing is good, though--I&#39;ve never had an ad pop up on the reply page! :)<br><br>Also: this isn&#39;t constant, the ads. There are always the ones in the place designated for them--sometimes these are really large and can distort the page layout--but the majority of the time, I&#39;m able to use the Board without seeing the full-page ads. Maybe even 8 or 9 times out of 10. (I think. I&#39;ll start keeping an eye out--it may be more frequent and I&#39;m just used to ignoring it now. I&#39;ll let you know if it turns out to be more prevalent than I currently think).<br><br>Hope that helps,<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>...just trying to get to the main page of the Board. I double checked that going forward brings me straight back to the ad; I tried closing the tab and opening a new one--same thing. It&#39;s pretty bad this morning.<br><br>I have managed to view a couple of posts without ads, and I had seen a number of them without ads earlier.

            <p>It definitely dropped me back a page when I hit the back button. This is... a pretty high concentration, actually. Normally it doesn&#39;t happen so many times in a row...

            <p><a href="https://disc.yourwebapps.com/disc-maint.cgi?id=199610">On June 29th,</a>, they apparently migrated disc.yourwebapps to a new server. That probably explains the load times. (Previously we&#39;ve had problems with loading the Board&#39;s css, because it was hosted on Freewebs; since I moved it to Google, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s come up).<br><br>The cover-everything ads are annoying, I agree, though I&#39;ve not seen them layered. There seems to be no way to turn them off without paying $92 per month for premium access, though.<br><br>I&#39;ll mention your observations about loading times over on the support forum - I&#39;ve noticed it a bit as well.

            <p>While I haven&#39;t read the fic itself (and would definitely prefer to avoid doing so), I did just read the TVTropes page on it (which is extremely informative), and while I agree with the Legendary status...I don&#39;t think this is quite right for PPCing.<br><br>You&#39;ve said that the a/ns are the part about religion, but the Tropes page says it&#39;s got Author Tract, the (or a?) main character &quot;attempting to convert the Clans to Christianity&quot;, a version of the Ten Commandments playing a role in the story, Starkit (I assume this is the kit who becomes StarGleam) <i>actually being called, in-fic, the cats&#39; &#39;savor&#39; and Jesus, I am not kidding</i>--look, just <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/StarkitsProphecy">take a look through the Tropes page.</a> It&#39;s very informative, and has a lot of quotes. I&#39;d say it&#39;s probably giving a very good idea of what the fic is like; TVTropes pages on badfics tend to, and this one looks pretty thorough to me.<br><br>What does the PPC say about this? <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide#What_about_religious_fic.3F">Well, let&#39;s take a look</a>:<br><br><i><u>What about religious fic?</u><br>As noted in the Guide to the PPC, we consider fanfiction based on religious texts to be in poor taste, and since a mission is a form of fanfic, we&#39;d be hypocrites to PPC such fics. It happened once, but after that we agreed as a community not to go there again.<br><br><b>Then there&#39;s fanfic that has overt religious themes while not strictly being a religious-text-fic. Sporking religious fanfic is tricky – so tricky that it&#39;s best just to leave it alone.</b> We&#39;ve seen those fics where Harry Potter converts to Christianity, and <b>we find them just as mind-boggling as you do, but we prefer not to run the risk of offending or hurting our fellow Boarders by accidentally bashing someone&#39;s religion while sporking a story.</b><br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t PPC <u>any</u> fic that so much as mentions a religion or contains a religious character, but please exercise extreme caution and remember that everyone has a right to their own beliefs, even if you don&#39;t agree with them.</i><br><br>Personally, I think that this looks like exactly the sort of badfic we do <i>not</i> take on. Religion seems to play a pretty big part in it--particularly religion of the Author Tract!Missionary sort, which, er, is pretty out of place in the <i>Warriors</i>-verse, I&#39;ll give you that--and by &#39;it&#39; I mean both the a/ns and the story itself. It looks like it&#39;d be really difficult to PPC without offending people, and, quite honestly, it doesn&#39;t look like the kind of fic we spork. <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2015/literarytravesty.wordpress.com">Library of the Damned</a> would do it--they did Prayer Warriors, after all, and it went pretty well--but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not for us.<br><br>So: as horrible as it is, as horrible as even the non-religious elements are...I&#39;d recommend leaving it alone. PPCing it looks like a horrible idea to me, and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not the only one with that opinion.<br><br>(Legendary status, though? I&#39;m on board with that. Very much so. Unless Legendary status is limited to non-religious-element badfics?)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Scape could have definitely been less sarcastic. But her opinion – &quot;not another show that is too confusing for its own good&quot; – is perfectly legit.

            <p>So, my brother, who is hard at work at earning his reputation among his friends as master of all things western animated, has introduced me to this Stephen Universe thing. I have to admit, at first, I did not really get it. However, over time, the show grew on me, and I&#39;m finding myself looking for more and more things Stephen.<br><br>The third Stephen Bomb just ended, so I thought now would be as good a time as any to talk about this new fandom I find myself in. Any thoughts on the show? Favorite characters? Any particular ways you want to see Jasper disintegrated? I am willing to talk all things Stephen.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve wanted to binge-watch all the episodes, but I only made it as far as &quot;Steven&#39;s Lion&quot; before I had my laptop taken from me. It’s all over my Tumblr dash, though, so I know about more than a few things about that show. Pearl is best gem, btw :D<br><br>I think one of my agents may pick up on the show as well pretty soon, since I want to do a Steven Universe mission sometime. Probably Lapis, since she already shares a name with one of the canons... XD</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve adored Steven Universe since the Mirror/Ocean Gem episodes; though to be fair, that was when I finally discovered the series. And to say the least, anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it yet SHOULD. It&#39;s the best thing to come out of Cartoon Network in a very long time!<br><br>In fact, I will go so far as to say it can go toe to toe with the likes of Gravity Falls and Samurai Jack as one of the all-time best animated shows of the late 20th/21st centuries.<br><br>I myself am partial to Garnet, with Steven himself not too far behind. And while I myself don&#39;t like Jasper due to her douchebaggery, I hate Peridot even more. Why? Because by all accounts, she shouldn&#39;t be a threat. Allow me to explain:<br><br>When I first saw her, I laughed her off as a joke; I mean, I don&#39;t underestimate any Gem I see on the show but...really? I was supposed to be intimidated by her? She looks like the illegitimate lovechild of a Linux and some hardware goggles! She has no place being some all-powerful being.</p>

            <p>In fact you&#39;re not supposed to be intimidated by her. She&#39;s the Homeworld&#39;s tech support who somehow ended up stranded on an alien planet. She has no idea how half her weapons work (just look at her expressions in Friend Ship) and she is almost certainly the Gem equivalent of a kid. She&#39;s supposed to be funny because of how in over her head and how ridiculous she is. In fact I&#39;m pretty sure that Peridot was actually literally based on Invader Zim, who is barely intimidating under perfect circumstances. </p>

She&#39;s probably one of the strongest characters on the show, physically and mentally, for goodness&#39; sake! <br><br>I cannot wait to find out more about the backstory.

            <p>Still don&#39;t know what I should call Jasper. I know Gems have no gender (what with being, you know, gemstones) and usually use female pronouns, but Jasper is trying so hard to be male, deepening the voice, changing appearance... I think &quot;dead meat&quot; or &quot;glitter dust&quot; will do. Seems the least offensive route.<br><br>I adore Pearl. She is, bar none, my favorite Gem. I mean, Garnet is great, especially later in the series, but Pearl has a special place in my heart. Her motherly actions, her grace, her inner thoughts of worthlesness (Spoilers:<font color="FFFFFF">since Rose died</font>) all moves me so.<br><br>And no, this will not become a &quot;best Gem&quot; thread. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. <s>even the wrong ones</s><br><br>Just a question, how far have you gotten in the series? I don&#39;t want to spoil anything, as there are some very big events that come later that I want you to see for yourself. A good check is, what do you think when I say &quot;Gem kindergarten.&quot;</p>

            <p>At least, she&#39;s referred to as a she by every other character. And how exactly is she &#39;trying so hard to be male&#39;? Women are entirely capable of having deep voices and being aggressive. Also &#39;changing appearances&#39; to what are you referring to? Malachite?

            <p>There is one thing of being a muscular woman, and having the body of a man. Now, calm down, I know physical sex does not equate gender, however, Gems can alter their appearance in ny way they like, save color. Jasper chose this form. Also, glitterdust is definitely lowering their pitch down. Looked a lot like a trans gem, if there is such a thing.<br><br>...I get the feeling I am somehow being offencive. Gender is difficult enough to wrap my head around as is, forget trying to pin it to a species that for all intents and purposes has no gender. All I was trying to do was note that I never once heard glitterdust referred to by any pronoun, and chose to appear male. If I was wrong, I was wrong. Now I&#39;m just going to call Jasper glitterdust out of spite.</p>

            <p>Second, Why do you think she&#39;s male? Because she&#39;s tall and buff? Such women can exist while <i>still being women</i>.

            <p>I was able to follow it all right, but I would have liked a little more character interaction, not that there was necessarily room for it in the mission.  Also, I didn&#39;t really understand the Warframe stuff, not that it was really necessary to follow the mission.</p>

Apparently the estate has clamped down on the <i>Discworld</i> intellectual property. There is apparently no chance of Treefrog regaining it, either.<br><br>This means:<br><br>-The third game they were working on will never be made.<br>-(More seriously) They no longer have the right to produce more copies.<br><br>If you have been thinking of getting either of these games - or if you hadn&#39;t heard of them and think you&#39;d like to - <b>they are going to run out pretty fast</b>. Board games aren&#39;t something people keep thousands of in stock.<br><br>I got <i>Ankh-Morpork</i> for Christmas. I&#39;ve played it two or three times. It&#39;s quite long, and moderately complicated, but it is fun. On the strength of that, I&#39;ve just gone and bought <i>The Witches</i> with no idea of how it actually plays. I&#39;m not an impulse buyer - but this seems worth it.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying you have to buy it (though as OFUDisc Administrator, obviously I&#39;d be delighted if you did!).

            <p>So. In about six and a half months, I&#39;ve apparently done something very, <i>very</i> right with writing Valon and Kala. They&#39;ve received overall positive reception, and (and this is the reason for my question) they&#39;re tied for second place in the Department of Floaters, as far as mission count goes. As soon as Skar and I can find the time to finish our blasted cowrite, Valon and Kala will have twelve missions to their names.<br><br>So, the question is: Should they be added to the main page for the Department of Floaters?<br><br>I don&#39;t know what determines whether agents get added to the Department pages, and I don&#39;t know if Valon and Kala have quite that level of respect from the community.</p>

            <p>Because basically it&#39;s just been me making the decisions so far, since I&#39;ve been the one putting in the time and effort to rewrite the department pages to make them actually useful.<br><br>Anyway, criteria:<br><br>1. Were they the first/only agents in the department or a division in the department?<br><br>2. Do they have the highest mission count in the department? (That&#39;s actual missions; I don&#39;t count interludes for this purpose.) Second- or third-highest also works.<br><br>2.5 If it&#39;s a really small department, do they have <i>any</i> published missions at all? (This does not apply to the DF, obviously.)<br><br>3. Have they been demonstrably active in the department a long time? (I&#39;m thinking of agents like Nume, whose service record is backed up by my own presence in the community. I hesitate to count agents whose writers create them as having been around forever; I kinda feel like that&#39;s cheating.)<br><br>4. Did they take on a Legendary or some other famous badfic?<br><br>5. Are they well-known for some other reason, like being a PPC Lust Object or, e.g., Luxury?<br><br>So, if you&#39;ve hit second-place for mission count, then yes, you meet the criteria. Go for it!<br><br>~Neshomeh, who fully believes in transparency (if anyone bothers to ask).</p>

            <p>That&#39;s just for the Action departments. Infrastructure is a little different, since all the agents in an Infrastructure department pretty much stay in one place, so if you&#39;re gonna write about it, it&#39;s a good idea to know who <i>everyone</i> is that your characters might run into. Therefore, I plan to list <i>all</i> agents in the department on the Infrastructure pages, or else have something like the FicPsych Personnel page to list everybody and link to that from the department page.<br><br>Just, y&#39;know, in case anyone wanted to know that for any reason.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

<br><li>
<i>It took a moment for Michael to realize what she met </i>— should be &quot;meant&quot;.</li>

<i>Mia was already at the console, looking at the words. </i>— So why is it Michael who tells her the Sue is a Mermaid, not the other way round?</li>

            <p>Something I recommend you do, that might be helpful, before dismissing an idea, find someone to bounce it off of first.  That&#39;s kind of what you are doing here, but you are being too hard on yourself.  Everyone has ideas that are hit and miss, and it kind of reminds me of a quote from Thomas Edison, paraphrased since I cannot remember the exact one.  When asked about failing multiple times before succeeding with his light bulb, he responded along the lines of I did not fail 99 times, but discovered 99 ways not to build a light bulb.<br><br>Really what I am trying to say is, just because the first attempt at an idea did not work the way you wanted, do not dismiss it as bad.  With this idea now, it has potential, but it is too skeletal to really know for certain.  It needs more to determine how it would work.  If you are hesitant to go too much further in depth with the character, because you think it will be a &quot;bad idea&quot; and you want to work on it still, you can hit me via e-mail and you can run it by me.  Of course, my ability to respond will be severely hampered over the next two weeks, but you can still try.<br><br>If you do want to use me to further work out this idea or others, my e-mail is border name without brackets at Google.  And that actually goes for anyone else interested in hashing out further ideas.  I spent about two years in various workshops, so I would be happen to listen to any ideas and provide input.  </p>

            <p>While designing her character, her appearance and her abilities, I drew on all my knowledge of cephalopods (not just squid, but also octopi and cuttlefish). For instance, Stephanie can change her color at will, and her control is astounding considering she&#39;s, you know, totally colorblind (which is true of cuttlefish). It&#39;s like she has psychic knowledge of what color she needs to be.<br><br>Of course, with other elements, my mind went to some awful places...<br><br><font color="FFFFFF">This white text is NSFW.<br><br>She still has breasts, but she doesn&#39;t have a reason since she&#39;s not a mammal... or does she?

            <p>...just badly implemented ones.<br><br>So, according to that Monster Girl Encyclopedia, the whole reason for a kraken&#39;s existence is to kidnap male humans and basically hold them prisoner, raping them for the rest of the man&#39;s life. <i><b> Gulp! </b></i> Now that could cause a lot of juicy, interesting conflict, especially considering the PPC&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Rape">official policy on rape</a> as something agents just plain aren&#39;t supposed to do.<br><br>So maybe Medical and FicPsych have got Stephanie permanently pumped full of libido-suppressing drugs, but there are still going to be a lot of males who won&#39;t feel comfortable near her just in case the drugs wear off.

            <p>Stephanie would be from the <i>Monster Musume</i> universe, not the MGE universe. I&#39;m not comfortable with writing anything that&#39;s actually from the MGEverse because there are a lot of elements that creep me out, such as forced physical and mental transformation.<br><br>Most of the sexual aspects would be toned down by necessity, because that&#39;s what Okayado does for MonMusu. Stephanie wouldn&#39;t be a sex drive on tentacles, she&#39;d be an industrial-sized Norwegian girl who happens to have tentacles instead of legs.</p>

            <p>To be honest, I don&#39;t see the point of the whole &quot;tentacles instead of legs&quot; thing.  Why not just make her an industrial-sized Norwegian girl with ordinary legs?  What do the tentacles add to the story, apart from satisfying your fetish?<br><br>And, just so you know I&#39;m not judging you:  One of my sexual fantasies is being headless.  (There&#39;s something strangely empowering about the thought of being so in control of myself and of my own body that not even losing my head can stop me!)<br><br>But despite that, animal people tend to fall right into the uncanny valley for me.  Whether anthro or half-and-half, they just creep me out in the same way that headlessness creeps other people out.  So there needs to be a reason to justify the gimmick for people who don&#39;t share the fetish.<br><br>In Stephanie&#39;s case, maybe you could lampshade that.  Make part her character arc.  Go in totally the opposite direction you did with Kala.  Give her a partner who is secretly grossed out by her tentacles but he&#39;s trying to be polite, not let it show, not upset her or let her suspect how he feels.<br><br>Maybe he was shown a head and shoulders photo of her when he&#39;s assigned as her partner, and thinks she&#39;s just a gorgeous Norwegian girl.  So it&#39;s quite a shock to see that she&#39;s a ... a horrible, slimy <b><i>thing </i></b>from the waist down.  He wants to keep looking away from her tentacles but knows that might seem rude, but if he forces him to look at them, it would seem like he&#39;s staring at them which is equally rude.<br><br>Maybe he even tries to look up about krakens online, and finds that MGE entry.  That&#39;ll really freak him out!<br><br>Meanwhile how does she Stephanie feel about this?  Does she suspect how he feels?  Is she used to it, resigned to it being inevitable?  Has she lost lots of partners over time, because they couldn&#39;t get used to her tentacles?  (If she mentions this to him it could make him even more uncomfortable.)<br><br>Or is she new to both the PPC and to our world, and surprised and puzzled that people could feel that way about her?  Or maybe it works both ways and she&#39;s secretly grossed out at the thought of humans walking on two solid legs like ... like some kind of deformed featherless bird with a kraken&#39;s upper half!<br><br>Over time, the partners slowly get to know each other.  Slowly, very slowly, without even realising it, her partner finds himself thinking about about her tentacles less and less.  (If Stephanie ever had any problem about legs, she&#39;ll get used to them a lot quicker just because so many people in HQ have them.)<br><br>But, just as everything looks as if everything&#39;s going sommthly, Stephanie comes across something her partner wrote after he first met her, or overhears some old gossip about something he once told a friend about he.<br><br>She doesn&#39;t know that his feelings are changing (not surprising, since neither does he, yet) and she&#39;s shocked to find that he feels this way, especially since she thought she liked him.  She wonders how long their partnership is going to last, and whether it would be best for both of them if she asks the flowers for a new partner.<br><br>But then, on a mission, the DORKS breaks, causing them to revert to their normal forms.  The warrior!Sue spots the kraken and attacks.  But Stephanie&#39;s partner reacts instantly and saves her life by grabbing a couple of tentacles and pulling her to safety!  Even after the fight is over, he&#39;s just concerned that he might have hurt her by pulling too hard.  They&#39;re bot surprised that he wasn&#39;t bothered by touching her tentacles at all!<br><br>When their mission&#39;s finally over, they head back through the portal, one of her tentacles wrapped gently around his arm ans if it&#39;s the most natural thing in the world for both of them.  Even if they never become lovers like Valon and Kala, at least they new feel comfortable in each other&#39;s company.<br><br>(Yeah, yeah, I know, as it stands, it&#39;s not the greatest of story arcs.  In fact it&#39;s just one tired old cliche after another.  But it&#39;s a starting point.  Right?)<br></p>

            <p>Also, fun fact: monster girls are <i>not</i> my fetish. Even reading the MGE, I&#39;m rarely interested in that way.<br><br>Valon&#39;s not into Kala because she&#39;s a monster; he&#39;s into her because she&#39;s a girl, and she&#39;s a friend. I only made Kala a girtablilu because I wanted a character from that universe, and I originally planned for the 211 team to <i>never</i> get together. I thought that wish-fulfillment was an automatically bad thing at the time, and that Valon (AKA my author avatar) getting into a relationship would make him Stuish.<br><br>Wanna know something? Kala&#39;s human half isn&#39;t even my ideal woman! The women I&#39;m interested in almost always have long, dark hair, and they&#39;re usually average height. Kala has fairly short blonde hair, and she&#39;s incredibly short herself (four-foot-nine, even in disguise).<br><br>I am serious when I say that I could not give less of a crap about the fanservice in MonMusu. I actually <i>do</i> care more about the story than the sex appeal. Okayado&#39;s world is fascinating to me, and with characters like Kala Jeng, Stephanie Podd, and the as-yet-unreleased Betty Borea (who&#39;s a yeti), I&#39;m just trying to fill the gaps.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see anything bad about the idea you have right now, other than the fact that it&#39;s very small. Here&#39;s my suggestion: flesh Stephanie out some more. Give her a personality, a life, some quirks, some hobbies, and some flaws. Think of a character arc for her, with ways for her to grow. Then, I suggest a test drive. Try one of the 46 (I believe) Permission Prompts-- select one at random or just pick one. Take Stephanie out for a whirl and see how you like her. <br><br>You say that 90% of your ideas are bad, but I disagree. I think you&#39;re second guessing yourself too much. You said you cut off a thought immediately, because you thought it <i>might</i> be bad, and you&#39;re extremely uncertain about it at a very early stage. The thing is, right now you only have a tiny idea, like a little seedling. You can&#39;t know what it will grow to be, but you&#39;re already worried about it. So that&#39;s my advice-- nurture the seed a little. Let it grow up enough to see what it&#39;s really like, and <i>then</i> make a careful, thoughtful judgement on what you want to do. <br><br>And here&#39;s another little piece of advice, one I&#39;m still struggling to adhere to myself. Don&#39;t throw away your ideas: write them down. Keep a little folder on your computer for the ideas you have. Jot them down whenever you have them, then look at them every so often. Even if you don&#39;t think they&#39;ll work now, later on down the road you might like them. <br><br>Keep your chin up, Voyd-- I like your writing, and a few bad ideas aren&#39;t always... well, bad. They teach you what will work, and what won&#39;t. And because you&#39;ve been open about your problem (which isn&#39;t the easiest to do) we can help you. <br><br>Remember: &quot;Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.&quot;</p>

            <p>My knowledge of Doctor Who is pretty cursory - just the kind of stuff you pick up from watching the show mostly to ogle David Tennant.  This makes me want to really dig into the history of the setting, so I can understand all the subtle nuances going on right now.  Because I am absolutely certain they are incredibly and fascinating, but I think I&#39;m missing out on a lot of them.<br><br>One weird thing I noticed - on page eleven, there are a couple of references to the Notary as being male.  Either she regenerated and I didn&#39;t notice, or you might want to go back and edit that.</p>

            <p>Have you ever wondered what some of our esteemed oldbies were doing when the Board was young(er)? What they were talking about?

This was a Big Announcement. Look how few people (relatively) responded to the post. Does it fascinate you? It does me.<br><br>How about PPC based news, like a mission release?

            <p>Simply Baron, if one is feeling humble?<br><br>I found it so fascinating how the LoTR movies, which I see as classic cinema, and do an annual viewing of all three extended editions, were spoke of as absolute dreck that <i>ruined</i> the books with <i>broken</i> logic. Not that I am saying they weren&#39;t different from the books, nor that there were not changes that were made that should not have, but it was like the trilogy was <i>Eragon</i> or <i>Percy Jackson</i> or something. (Yes, I know. The Percy Jackson movies came out later. My point still stands.) Of course, knowing how the <i>Hobbit</i> movies went... Yeah, maybe there was some cause for hesitation.<br><br>It may well be the original wording, but I brought the original page! So ha!

            <p>And if it was, for instance, the <i>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</i> adaptation, I could see the reason for the changes. They did some stuff to tighten up the storyline to fit it into seven hours, and some to shift the focus onto the women more. So they monkeyed with the timeline, for instance, to give Emma Pole some interactions with the Arabella Strange plotline. In the book, they have, what, one on-page meeting?<br><br>But LotR-M changed things <i>just for the heck of it</i>. Why make Frodo useless at the ford? It wasn&#39;t to establish Arwen&#39;s character as Super Awesome for later use - they <i>didn&#39;t</i> use the super-awesome part. Were they trying to make Frodo look weaker so his perseverance later was more impressive? Did they just have some spare fake drool on hand? Who knows! I doubt PJ&amp;co do.<br><br>As for Faramir: it&#39;s not even so much the &#39;I&#39;ll abduct him&#39;, though the fact that <b>not</b> going after the Ring pretty much defined his entire character makes that hurt a lot (and the fact that they <i>used his actual line to justify the abduction</i> is just terrible). It&#39;s the fact that, in the interests of &#39;adding tension&#39;, they put a <b>Ringwraith</b> in front of <b>Frodo</b>. You know, the ones who&#39;ve been established time and time again as sensing the Ring whenever it&#39;s nearby? And, what, the Nazgul in question just... didn&#39;t feel like reporting it? &#39;Eh, I&#39;m sure the boss already knows.

            <p>You may, for instance, recall that one of the Nine was foiled by the &quot;thrown object in the undergrowth&quot; trick from every PoW movie ever. Sensing the Ring or not, these are the actions of someone who is, er... let&#39;s call them &quot;differently bright&quot;. I would not put it past the relevant Nazgul to have completely forgotten about it, or be distracted by someone jangling a set of keys over its face or an interesting blob of Fell Beast snot.

            <p>The Ringwraith in question was distracted from being able to <i>catch</i> the Ringbearer - <b>not</b> from knowing the Ring was in the general area.

            <p>...in my honest opinion, the restoration pictured below is, uhm, disappointing:<br><br><img src="http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/9202/production/_84287373_zhenyuanlongbyzhaochuang.jpg" alt="http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/9202/production/_84287373_zhenyuanlongbyzhaochuang.jpg"> <br><br>I mean, sure, there isn&#39;t any denying that <i>Zhenyuanlong</i> has feathers, but my main issue is the <i>way</i> the plumage is depicted, among a few other things. To explain, here&#39;s a dissection of the above picture, as taken from <a href="http://featheryraptor.tumblr.com/post/124570058586/complaining-about-official-reconstructions-1">this Tumblr post</a> on the matter:<br><br><img src="http://36.media.tumblr.com/89c993dbc4482241c97018b72f7e1c03/tumblr_inline_nrrlyrMsrs1sfoqcy_540.png" alt="http://36.media.tumblr.com/89c993dbc4482241c97018b72f7e1c03/tumblr_inline_nrrlyrMsrs1sfoqcy_540.png"> <br><br>The list of issues pointed out by the source post are as follows, in quote:<br><br><i>1.) Wing Structure. Whilst Zhenyuanlong had a complicated arrangement of primaries, secondaries, coverts, and retrices, here the feathers on the arm are represented as a simple fan.<br><br>2.) Pronation. Even though this isn’t Jurassic Park Velociraptor-like full on bendy wrist pronation, this posture is still unlikely and will cause wrist breakage.<br><br>3.) Leg Feathers. Here Zhenyuanlong is depicted with vestigial Microraptor-like hindlimb feathers, whereas the actual fossil lacks any feathers around the hindlimbs. This may be a taphonomic artifact, but speculation isn’t a good way to go for a reconstruction.<br><br>4.) Shrinkwrapping. It may be a matter of texturing, but the feet of Zhenyuanlong are horrendously wrinkled in this reconstruction. This is not that major a problem for the rest of the body.<br><br>5.) Posture. The right leg is bent at a crude, almost painful angle. This certainly calls into question how the hips of this thing even work.<br><br>6.) Coloration. Having this flashy coloration may not necessarily be the best choice for an active predator. On the other hand, this may be intended to be for display. In either case, however, the colour is not what we would expect for this animal.</i><br><br>To add to some specific points, and in concurrence to all of them:<br>* Like modern birds, deinonychosaurs had primary feathers attached to the second finger (look at the fossil of <i>Microraptor</i>, for example). Either the artist behind the restoration did not research the fossil find or I need new glasses, because <i>I don&#39;t see any primaries on the second finger.</i> The primaries are now common knowledge for a significant number of palaeo-artists on the Internet, as <a href="http://ewilloughby.deviantart.com/art/How-Raptors-Lost-Their-Primaries-287545900">this comic</a> wittily demonstrates. More seriously, the notion of large primary wing feathers and their supposed interference with forelimb function is discussed in depth <a href="http://albertonykus.blogspot.com/2011/06/maniraptor-feathers-part-vi-lizard.html">here</a>.<br>* Apparently, the shrink-wrapping as described in the Tumblr post applies only to the feet; in modern birds, the foot musculature is pretty minimal (I had fried chicken feet in Indonesia once, and they didn&#39;t have that much meat on them). I did notice that there isn&#39;t much padding in the right foot, however, so maybe that&#39;s why the feet look so awkward. A <strike>Dr. Scholl&#39;s</strike> sole cushion would&#39;ve likely been necessary for a ground-dweller to support its weight, like in the feet of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Strau%C3%9Fenfu%C3%9F.jpg">ostriches</a>, for example.<br>* Regarding the feather colors: I think the paleo-art circles have an inside-joke term for color schemes like this: <a href="http://babbletrish.deviantart.com/art/PSA-Addendum-177783393">Sparkleraptors</a>. From what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s often garishly colored dinos like these that turn people off from the notion of feathered dinosaurs in the first place. As noted, it&#39;s also not a new thing, either - Archaeopteryx is always depicted as being colored like a tropical bird in old dinosaur books (which is especially jarring when all the other dinosaurs are elephant-gray, mud-brown, moss-green, etc.). Most meat-eating dinosaurs would likely go with more subdued color schemes as in modern predatory mammals, and vivid colors like a bird of paradise would probably be a seasonal thing for the sake of showing off to mates and such. For the technically minded, <a href="http://dinogoss.blogspot.com/2010/10/guide-to-feather-colors.html">here&#39;s</a> a detailed explanation on dinosaur feather colors, which should be helpful for portraying plausible color schemes for at least the feathered ones. (Note that Ripper&#39;s blood-red plumage is actually quite reasonable according to the article, since carnivores like him have only structural colors and melanin to work with.)<br><br>All that being said, the artwork itself is gorgeous once you get past the technical flaws (though I had to struggle to do that, being the palaeo-nerd I am). JP notwithstanding of course, feathered dinosaurs NEED to be a thing in modern prehistory media. And to those who say feathered dinos look stupid, go anger a goose and then we&#39;ll talk. XD</p>

            <p>You have no idea how much I LOVE Emily&#39;s work! She makes the best feathered dinos ever, and nothing will convince me otherwise! :D<br><br>And as a bit of a tangential plug, I&#39;d also like to take the opportunity to promote one of my favorite dinosaur-related original fiction works: <a href="http://tyrannotitan333.deviantart.com/gallery/37549017/Palae-oh-no">Palae Oh No</a>. Basically, all the problems of human-era dinosaur media, retold with civilized, science-accurate dinosaurs and media about Permian synapsids instead. Palaeontology fans should definitely give it a read sometime!</p>

            <p>Well, they may be wrong about the colouration - unless I&#39;m colourblinding at it, the only bright colour is that crest, which could well be for display. That&#39;s not a full-on Sparkleraptor by any stretch.<br><br>But they&#39;re not wrong about the rest; that left foot in particular is just scary. And... I see it only has Microraptor feathers on <i>one</i> leg? Perhaps it IS diseased...<br><br>I do actually disagree about the quality of the art itself, though. It&#39;s... not all that good.<br><br>-The <i>Zhenyuanlong suni</i> doesn&#39;t seem to be part of the background.<br>-It&#39;s got its mouth open in that &#39;I am unlike any other predator ever because I roar all the time&#39; post dinosaurs love to take (I love <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3X-exI0BaX0/VYv3UDm6ZpI/AAAAAAAABv0/WNWwYCSRFF0/s1600/Ode%2Bto%2Bfeathers%2BWitton%2B2015%2Blow%2Bres.jpg">this image</a>, which shows both predator and prey with their mouths <b>shut</b>, because running is more useful than screaming!

Do birds really have gaps between the ends of every feather? It seems pretty unlikely to me. And look at that throat - it&#39;s a mess! It&#39;s more of a mess than an urban pigeon, and that&#39;s saying something.<br>-The pose is pretty silly, with the wings stretching forward like that. It brings to mind a toddler racing across the room with her arms out to cuddle my leg (which is awkward when I&#39;m trying to walk, but hardly fearsome).<br><br>I&#39;m just... not all that impressed.<br><br>But I would dearly love to see a new <i>Walking With Dinosaurs</i>-style show featuring modern reconstructions. Feathered maniraptors, and bristly ceratopsians, and marvellously weird <i>Deinocheirus</i> and <i>Spinosaurus</i>, and superpredatory azhdarchids, and ridiculously wide-necked <i>Apatosaurus</i> and <i>Brontosaurus</i>, and... all the bizarre things that make the Mesozoic both stranger and more familiar than we ever imagined.<br><br>hS, whose only adventure in paleoart has been Celtic-knotted archosaur sketches</p>

            <p>And we can do some art critiquing, too. The BBC is blocked at work, so I checked around the web, and found two different illustrations.<br><br>1/ <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/14/national/tyrannosaur-teeth-unearthed-nagasaki/#.Va4lEvlVhHw">Japan Times</a><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/TyrantDuel.png"><br><br>This picture is designed to show of tyrannosaurs in general, not the new one in particular. It&#39;s immediately apparent that it&#39;s a compromise - one has fuss, the other has scales (heck, it practically has osteoderms). The fuzzy one has alarmingly-pronated wrists, and even the pebbly looks like she might have broken one. And, er, how many toes do tyrannosaurs have? Pebbly seems to have one less (the little one inside the ankle); is that meant to be present or not?<br><br>I also note with alarm that fuzzy&#39;s teeth are all the same, and that the two seem to have differently-facing eyes. And the colour schemes are a bit drab...<br><br>Basically, these are your bog-standard, jobbing-illustrator tyrannosaurs. They highlight the main features, repeat a few common mistakes, and then you forget about them.<br><br>2/ <a href="http://2newthings.com/2015/07/teeth-from-nagasaki-show-new-tyrannosaur-was-big-in-japan/">2NewThings</a><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/EasternTyrant.png"><br><br>This, on the other hand... this is what paleoart should be like.<br><br>The head is too large and misshapen, the legs are too skinny, the tail must be broken to do that, and <i>none of it matters</i> because the piece elegantly achieves its purpose:<br><br>-It shows the new tyrant as a Japanese creature, not a generic one.<br>-It shows that it was (almost certainly) feathered.<br>-It makes it look like a <i>living creature</i>, not micro-Godzilla.<br>-It&#39;s gorgeous and eye-catching.<br><br>Look at it! It <b>doesn&#39;t even show the teeth</b>, which are the only thing they found, and it&#39;s <i>still</i> a far better illustration of the story than the Generic Tyrants. Gorgeous.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>--~*~--<br><br>There is war in Plort.<br><br>The Green Ads, relatives of the vile trolls but far more insidious, have blockaded the city of Borrd. They do not have the numbers to bar all access to the city, but their ships and raiding parties are a constant threat. One intrepid traveller might pass without injury, while another is confronted with seven or eight of their warriors, and forced to retreat. Some reach the safety of their houses, only to find hours later that the Green Ads are within, watching and waiting.<br><br>Worse still, there are rumours of citizens of the Union being siezed by the Green Ads and borne away to a distant land whose name is whispered as Apstor. Far too often, these are the most mobile of Plort&#39;s inhabitants - those very knights and civilians who might expect to escape the threat.<br><br>The barons of Plort are in turmoil. Baron VixenMage has closed the doors of Castle Medyantur, venturing out only in direst need. Lady Iximaz and Baron PC rail against the invaders, but their every assault is rebuffed. From the west, rumours fly that the Pass of the Five is barricaded by the Green Ads, leaving Ozerbord entirely cut off; Baron Huinesoron is said to have fled the Refuge, holing up in the fortress of Otik until the crisis passes.<br><br>Under the shadow of the Green Ads, the good people of Borrd cry out in appeal to the great gods Kanun Syorn and Spelin Tam-Ara, but the mighty ones are indifferent to their pleas. Before the gates of Otik, a crowd is growing, of protesters from every walk of life. Soon, a great meeting will be held, and the future of the Protectorate of Borrd will be decided.<br><br>Some argue for patience and restraint: &quot;The Green Ads are but an inconvenience; let us carry on as we ever have, and their efforts will fade in time. Let Spelin Tam-Ara have her chance, and she will liberate us from them.&quot; Among there number are some who urge all the folk of Plort to take up weapons imbued with the power of Brawzer-Ahdunn or Ad-Blawk, though others claim that even these enchanted blades have no effect.<br><br>Others propose a great sacrifice to the Gods of Plort. &quot;If we pledge to give to the mighty ones a grand tribute each month, they will surely protect us from the Green Ads, and any other scourge which might come upon us. Our libraries would be safe; we could guard against dire magics; some say we might even shroud Konti-Nyuum entirely in the mists of invisibility, that none might ever assail our shores again.&quot;<br><br>Many claim that the only solution is to raze the city of Borrd entirely and build it anew. &quot;Let the cities of Probard&#39;s design be our guide! Their wide avenues and well-planned parks are more beautious by far than the tangles of Borrd, ancient and beloved though they be; and with high walls we could limit the depredations of the Green Ads.&quot; Oft is the argument heard that with a new Borrd and a new start, the Ops of the Republic of Iric might be brought into Borrd, and that with such Muds the Protectorate&#39;s borders would at last be secured.<br><br>And then there is Sir Tomash. Though he does not stir from his home in Iric, rumours of his work have spread across the lands of Plort. &quot;Let him re-work the wards of protection!&quot; his advocates cry. &quot;You feared cataclysm, yet what disaster could be worse than this? Let Teebor be taken up and brought upon the capital, and our security ensured for all time!&quot; Yet in the grand plans of Tomash and Baron Dann there is a grave flaw, for they have not the arcane strength to lay the new enchantments and bring the new capital to its foundations. Some propose a propriation of mysterious gods to grant their power to Plort; others suggest an alliance with the distant Guggle; still others claim that Tomash&#39;s power is greater than any yet know, and that the spells can be laid unaided.<br><br>What will be the future of the Protectorate of Borrd, and of the Union of Plort in which it stands? The crowds are gathered before the gates of Otik, and soon, the debate will begin…<br><br>--~*~--<br><br>Or, in other words:<br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279832;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">We have an advert problem on the Board</a>. Multiple people have reported increasingly-obnoxious adverts, including unblockable redirects and what seem to be viruses. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279907;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">My breakdown of the evidence is here.</a><br><br>So… what do we do? I think there are four options, which I&#39;ve said in Plort-speak above, and will break down here:<br><br><b>1/</b> Nothing. Continue to ask the YourWebApps team (Sean and Tamara) to do something about it (so far, they haven&#39;t approved the post in which I tried to lay out the problem - you can watch for it to show up <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/Indices/1.html">here</a>). Install AdBlock if you have a serious problem, otherwise just treat it as an inconvenience - the price of doing business. This is the simplest (and default) option. The downside is that it doesn&#39;t actually change anything.<br><br><b>2/</b> Pay YourWebApps for a premium account. The benefits they list are:<br><i>*No ads for any of your visitors<br>*Unlimited messages (you are currently allowed a maximum of 25,000)<br>*Ability to block users from viewing your DiscApp<br>*Hide your visitors&#39; IP addresses from public view<br>*Disable bad word blocking</i><br>The downside of this is that the quote is hovering around $90 per month (it&#39;s based on traffic), so we&#39;d either need a wealthy benefactor or some means of raising funds. If we stopped paying, of course, the Board would drop back to free mode.<br><br><b>3/</b> Move to a forum-style Board. I&#39;ve suggested Proboards because I know it works (as a forum), and have <a href="http://ppcboard.boards.net/">made a simple mockup here</a>. It would get rid of the advertising problem - but the downside is that we would be forced to totally change the structure of the Board. I can&#39;t find any other providers who do free boards laid out like The Board, so we&#39;d end up in forum mode, and there&#39;s always been strong feelings against that. (Like me, for instance.)<br><br><b>4/</b> Tomash and Techno-Dann. They created a prototype New Board (aka T-Board) back in summer 2012, which was exhaustively tested by me and others in &#39;13. It <a href="http://ppc-posting-board-2-proto.herokuapp.com/">seems to still be available here</a>; if you can&#39;t get to that, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/dGymO">this is what it looks like</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JRhhkT7sdzsU7tel4jphqlKB5k0BtCKn4sTkC1e-GxI/pub">this</a> is a slightly-outdated draft release announcement by Tomash. The really big positive is that it&#39;s Just Like The Board But Better (no ads, and some weird tagging functions). It&#39;s versatile and easy to control, since the person who made it is, like, right here. The <b>downside</b> is hosting: the current server (Dann&#39;s, I think?) is crawlingly slow, and webhosting costs money. I&#39;ve suggested it might be possible to run it on Google Drive, but I honestly don&#39;t know how feasible that is. (The other problem is that Tomash doesn&#39;t seem to be around this week, but that&#39;s a temporary thing.)<br><br>My own preference is for 1 or 4, which I think is pretty clear from the descriptions, but Huinesoron Is Not A God<sup>TM</sup>; it&#39;s not up to me. So I&#39;m opening up The Perennial Discussion.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: This is not a vote right now. It&#39;s a discussion to draw out pros, cons, and other ideas. If we don&#39;t magically end up with a clear consensus, there&#39;ll be a poll or something.)<br><br>(PPS: Please don&#39;t respond with Plort politics solution. Yes, I know, everybody has swords, but unless you can come up with a way to literally stab banner ads to death, that&#39;s not terribly helpful.)<br><br>(PPPS: I apologise insincerely for the French-language pun in the Green Ads.)</p>

            <p>*puts on blast shield*<br><br>I can&#39;t possibly guess what&#39;s going on on mobile. However, since some people are reporting really nasty ads on their (presumably Windows) laptops, while others aren&#39;t. I think it&#39;s <i>possible</i> that some portion of the people who are getting annoying full-screen stuff on their laptops have some kind of malware. This is just a friendly reminder from your local know-it-all nerd that it can&#39;t hurt to check for viruses etc. when ads are suddenly more annoying. For true paranoia, download a virus scanner (such as Malwarebytes) on a different computer, save it on a flash drive with an unusual name, and run the program from safe mode. </p>

            <p>Like I said previously, I can&#39;t access the Board on mobile without being redirected and I have to hit the back button pretty much all the time. And my guess is that Option #1 won&#39;t work out so well if the mods don&#39;t have the time or resources to fix the problem. My experience on forums is enough to tell me that a PPC Forum thingy won&#39;t work, though. I like a single wall of notifications, thanks.<br><br>Probably the best alternative for me would be #4, with #2 being a close second. #4 being the best because if we can get a server that can handle all the data, then we have an ad-free Board. #2 would allow us to keep and fix the current Board, meaning everyone&#39;s a winner, though it&#39;s not my favorite option ATM because I&#39;m not employed yet and don&#39;t have a cent to spend. :(</p>

            <p>Actually, option one would work for me. I haven’t seen any of those intrusive ads that try to make me download viruses in months, and I don’t even use ad-blockers.

            <p>Starting with a slightly off-topic one: I enjoyed reading the Plort story at the beginning :)<br><br>Back on topic, regarding the proposed courses of action:<br><br>1) Not really much to say about this, as it&#39;s basically what we&#39;re doing at the moment anyway. On the upside, it&#39;s very easy to implement. On the downside, as you noted, it doesn&#39;t actually seem to offer a solution.<br><br>2) I don&#39;t think much of this option - it just seems very expensive for what we&#39;d get out of it. And I&#39;m not even sure it would solve our current problems. <br><br>Yes, it says that we won&#39;t get any ads, but I don&#39;t have a problem with the ads that appear at the top each page. What I&#39;ve got a problem with is the pop-ups, and the auto-redirects that are almost certainly trying to get you to download viruses. I don&#39;t think that these are part of the intended function of the Board, and if they aren&#39;t meant to be part of the Board, then I&#39;m not convinced that upgrading will make them go away. Personally, I would expect webapps to protect users from malicious content, regardless of whether they&#39;re paid members or not. If it turns out that the only way to get protection is to pay a (high) monthly subscription... I&#39;m thinking maybe it&#39;s time we jumped ship?  <br><br>3) From what I&#39;ve seen of others, I dislike the forum style. I much prefer the current thread system, where it&#39;s nice and easy to follow multiple diverging tracks of a conversation (which tends to happen a lot). The forum style only really seems to work, for me, if you get an initial post and then a series of replies just to that post. When you get replies to the replies, and chains of conversation evolving, it just seems to become very disjointed if you&#39;re trying to read through it all - like trying to read a Choose Your Own Adventure novel as a normal book. I know that last time this was discussed, there were many proponents of a forum style Board, but I am not one of them.  <br><br>4) I remember being very impressed with T-Board when it was brought up before, particularly how easy it was to jump around within a conversation thread, and the way you can expand long replies without having to load up a new page. That made it a lot easier to use on phones. <br><br>If I remember rightly, it was also possible to view it in different ways (some sort of preference settings or something?) so that it could look either like the current Board, or a forum. Which hopefully will be able to keep everyone happy with the layout. <br><br><br>In general, I&#39;d still rather that the Board was a free service. I can just see introducing a need to pay being a hassle - if we work on donations, what do we do if we come up short? If we start charging a subscription, who has to pay? What if people can&#39;t afford it for any reason*, or if they&#39;re young enough that they&#39;d need their parents&#39; permission, who think it&#39;s a waste? If we do end up going with something that costs money, we really need to shop around as much possible to get the best possible rate, and then try and come up with a fair system for actually getting that cash. <br><br>I also haven&#39;t had any problems with ads for the past couple of days, and I was using the Board from my tablet quite a bit last night. Is this just random good luck on my part, or is everyone else noticing an improvement too?<br><br>If it turns out that things have cleared up, I&#39;m content to go with 1), if we do decide to go somewhere else, I think 4) is our best bet. <br><br>- Irish<br><br>* I&#39;m pretty sure that last time this conversation came up I&#39;d been recently made unemployed. I can assure you that if I&#39;d been expected to pay <i>any</i> amount of money at that point, I&#39;d have just walked away. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll have to find some analytics code to put in to T-Board.

Currently, the name change indicator is rather heavy-handed (it puts the real username right on the page). However, I already have a &quot;user profile&quot; page (lists your email, must be signed in to view). I could just change the code to link the author name to the poster&#39;s profile. That way, different-name posts won&#39;t be glaringly obvious, but you&#39;ll still be able to tell who wrote something if you really want to know.</p>

            <p>Phobos and I know a guy who does custom t-shirts. We might be able to work out some sort of deal with him, if there&#39;s interest in that sort of thing. I don&#39;t know what he charges, if there are discounts for larger orders, etc., but we could find all that out pretty easily.<br><br>I could theoretically make some designs to give him without too much trouble, too, though I say theoretically because my actual motivation toward art has been pretty slim lately. Also, I am not, in fact, a digital artist, which might make the transition from design to product more difficult and less quality; I don&#39;t know. OTOH, I want a PPC shirt or two myself, so there&#39;s that.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

<li>I do use ad-blocker on my desktop.  It&#39;s a computer safety thing; sorry, PoorCynic and other YouTubers!  I do check the Board on and off at work, depending on how close to the end of my family&#39;s data cycle we are, and how much data is spare.  The ads are cyclical on my phone.  Sometimes, they&#39;re rare (like now), and I use the data plan freely.  Other times, the ads hit hard, in which case I keep off the internet browser entirely for a while, waiting for it to die down.  (Interestingly, the Board is always fine when I check it on wifi networks; the ads are only a problem when the data plan is turned on.)<br><br>So the ads are an occasional issue for me, and since they seem to be an even worse issue for others, I&#39;m not a fan of &quot;wait and see.&quot;  In fairness, we should still hold on and see how Tamara and Sean respond, assuming they do in a timely fashion.<br><br>2. $90 per month x 12 months per year = $1080 per year.  The U.S. government officially lists me as &quot;working poor&quot;—I could probably chip in about $20-$30 of that per year, and even then, I would miss it most miserly.  If the community, as a whole, is able to afford this . . . ugh.  It still feels like such a money sink, even if we can (says the guy who buys food that Safeway puts on clearance).<br><br>3. Honestly, I don&#39;t hold the same reservations about a forum-style Board as some others seem to.  I think we would get used to it pretty quickly.  I mean, I really only see a few topics we would even have (Permission-related posts, badfic/mission reports, OT discussion, RPs/Board games . . . heh heh, &quot;Board games&quot;), so I don&#39;t think it will be that hard to get through them all in a fairly short space of time.  (If you think about it, we already have an entire separate board used almost solely for role play.  I&#39;d say we might actually get more happening if we had them both at &quot;home base.&quot;)  So, I guess I&#39;m saying that it makes little difference to me whether we stay on the current style of Board or the Proboards variety.<br><br>4. I just read what Tomash and Dann were saying about this before I started this post, and I have already forgotten it, because I do not speak electronics.  I think it would be an easy transition from the current Board to the T-Board(&#39;s successor), so I would be fine with doing so, even more fine than with moving to a forum board, perhaps.  Again, my contribution to a fund would be limited to twenty-fivish dollars a year.  (And also, we would need to go to some kind of rigmarole to keep my parents from seeing a mysterious charge on my finances their son refuses to explain.  Like, someone else pays my part directly, and I send them cash in the mail as reimbursement.<br><br>—doctorlit sounds so cute, talking like he knows all these computer words</li>

            <p><b>Hosting:</b> T-Board is <b><i>not</i></b> hosted on Dann&#39;s server. It&#39;s hosted on the free plan of a cloud service called Heroku. This plan would be unsuitable for hosting the Board since it imposes a 10k row limit on the database, which we will outgrow quickly.<br><br>Dann may or may not have a server available. I don&#39;t know anything about that server, so I can&#39;t comment on it. If there is a machine, we can probably host there, and we&#39;ll be good until Dann gets hit by a bus or some other such catastrophe. Cost in that scenario is between $0 and about $10/year, depending on whether we want a domain name or not. We might consider having some kind of money stash for new hosting around anyway if that works out.<br><br>If Dann is unavailable, reliable servers can be had for on the order of $5 ($10 if I&#39;m misestimating resource usage) a month. Again, we&#39;d have to pay for a domain if we wanted a *.com (or .org etc.) If we don&#39;t want to do that, we can probably leech of the dynamic dns services, which hand out things like ppc.nodns.com.<br><br><b>Software:</b> The code has some minor bitrot, mostly because the web framework I&#39;m using has released several new versions since the last time I touched T-Board, and Dann or I would have to update the code to work with the new framework. This is a day or two of work tops (*), but could take a few weekends, since I have an internship at WhatsApp this summer.<br><br>Last time I showed off T-Board, there were concerns about the lack of anonymous posting. T-Board is structured so that everyone that posts needs an account. You can put anything you want in the Author field, but if you post under something other than your username, it will show as &quot;<a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2015/posted%20by%20%5Busername%5D">Author text</a>&quot;. This is sort-of the case now (IP addresses), but T-Board will make it more explicit. This would be a somewhat major change (your posts in RPs and things like the shipfests will be attributable to you), we should discuss. If we decide that we want anon posting back, I&#39;ll have to figure out how to integrate that with the registration library I&#39;m using.<br><br>Since Reddit wasn&#39;t tossed off the table, I can try to explain how moving there might work out for us in another post.</p>

            <p>While the citizens of Plort debated about what should be done to end the scourge of the Green Ads, they bade Sir Tomash go to Baron Dann and ready his arcane spells so that a new capital could quickly be raised. Tomash went out to his tower and began to rework his spells, as the alignment of the stars had changed greatly since he had meddled with the deep magics of Waeb.<br><br>While he was researching in the famed overflowing library of Stack, Tomash learned, to his dismay, that he had made a grave mistake in his previous work by failing to make the correct offerings to Post-Gress, the god of memory. His mistake would have doomed all who lingered in his new city to great difficulty in remembering what they had said before. Thankfully, Post-Gress has been placated by ritual offerings and the chanting of an ancient prayer during darkest night. <br><br>Now, Tomash must change his spells to match the position of the fickle Framing Stars. He must also prepare to raise a new island from the oceans of Weab, for the land in which he weaves his spells, Hero&#39;ku, has begun to reject his magic. If the many citizens of Borrd move to the new island, they will need to make small offerings to the sea-gods, lest their land collapse under them. The barons know this, but generally believe that the gods can be easily kept content with a small portion of the many goods produced in Plort.<br><hr>
<br>Ok. Non-Plort version.<br><br>There are two main causes of the slowness that people are feeling on T-Board. The first is that, whenever the board doesn&#39;t get any traffic for ~15 minutes, the host shuts it down to save on resources. When someone tries to visit later, it takes several seconds for everything no load before the code can start running. This won&#39;t be an issue on real hosting.<br><br>The second problem is that I actually did fail to speak the correct magic incantations. Basically, you can tell the database &quot;Hey, I&#39;m going to use this column to search for stuff, please make an index&quot;. In our case, we&#39;d often need to search using the list of parents of a post to see what posts were in a thread. This was done by looking for lists that started with a certain sequence of characters. To make those searches fast, you have to tell the database to create its index in a special way, which I just learned about yesterday. That issue has been fixed, and the time it takes to get a list of all the posts in a thread (in order) is down from ~120ms to ~2ms, which drops page rendering from 8-10s to 1-2s.<br><br>Heroku (where I&#39;m hosting this demo T-Board) had announced some changes to its hosting plans a while back. One of them is that free apps will soon only be able to run 18 hours a day, which obviously won&#39;t work for us. (Heroku wasn&#39;t a good solution anyway, since they wanted an arm and a leg to run the search engine T-Board uses). <br><br>T-Board is kind of somewhat ready for migration now. However, many of the libraries T-Board uses (like our web framework) have undergone some pretty significant updates since the last time I&#39;ve worked heavily with the code. In order to keep getting nice things (like security updates), I need to go back and modernize T-Board a bit. That&#39;ll take opti-realistically a man-weekend or two to do that, so I&#39;m pretty confident I&#39;ll have this done near the beginning of next semester. (Programming estimates are hard.) This gives us a bunch of time to decide on certain, erm, <i>logistical difficulties</i>. (The hosts I mentioned below can be pre-paid via PayPal, which is nice)<br><br>hS, you asked about maintainability. I personally feel that my code is around 7/10 maintainable by someone else if I get hit by a bus. T-Board is actually a relatively small program that rests on a bunch of libraries that do the hard stuff (like user account management) for us. If anyone wants a look at the guts, <a href="https://github.com/TechnoDann/PPC-board-2.0">all the code is here</a></p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure why we&#39;d need a paid-for domain name - look at the one we&#39;re currently using! I think people can remember to stick a .nodns/whatever in there, and saving money is always good.<br><br>Now the awkward question: long-term prospects. I see from my records (I love having records ^<em>^) that you&#39;ve been around since 2011 or so, which is a pretty long time for the Internet. But... the <i>PPC</i> has been around nine years more than that, and I for one fully intend for it to be around at least a decade more. So: in the event that you leave, how maintainable is the code for people who are not you? I&#39;ll assume you&#39;ve handed the server over to them fully (and also that they know how to code ^</em>~).<br><br>As for anon posts... I still think requiring sign-ins is a bad idea. Ignoring all other concerns, I know people have said in the past that their phones refuse to sign in...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t mind them, either, but I&#39;m not sure they&#39;d be very reliable. That No-IP thing mentioned earlier apparently isn&#39;t guaranteed to work 100% of the time unless you pay for it, and pretty much all of them put on additional ads (and sometimes apparently try to download adware, as with co.vu), which is pretty much what we&#39;re trying to avoid. Besides, if we have to pay for a server, a domain name doesn&#39;t add much to the price per month.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m assuming that when you say people have had trouble signing in from their phones, you&#39;re talking about this current Board, and not T-Board?

            <p>I have a Raspberry Pi that is currently running a test page. I never found the effort to put anything else up.

            <p>Because of how simple they are, these things can run stuff that wouldn&#39;t be readily apparent as something they could. It tends to be really hit-or-miss, though. And as for the data corruption, it is possible to store all the data on my router, due to its network-wide backup system. That would relegate the Pi to a strictly computational role.

And while, as pointed out by others we have some minor fragmenting it is not as pronounced as it could be on a more traditional forum.

And I have tried a Forum Based RP, and it just did not feel entertaining.  It could work, but this would be probably my third choice at this point.  I have seen a few places that they have adds that are just as intrusive as the ones here.  Though, I cannot confirm that.<br><br>The T-Board.  This is an intriguing idea.  It would theoretically solve the problem, but there are costs associated with it.  It would eliminate our problems, but you need bandwidth, domain names, and the like.  It would cost a monthly fee.

This seems like the best option all around to me.<br><br>Sub-Reddit, well I do not use Reddit so I do not know how effective it would be.  I do know, however, that Reddit has a few internal problems going on right now.  Further they seem to be closing down on quite a few sub-Reddits.  Now most of those are things we would other wise ban ourselves, but the problem I see is that, in just a few weeks they went from a policy of keeping things largely open and allowing a great many things, to shutting it all down.  This seems a bit arbitrary to me.  Who knows, maybe a future head will find all sporkings offensive and decide to shut us down.  I would prefer to avoid them.<br><br>And for Google Groups, I do not know enough to have one opinion or another.   <br><br>But I think the real question is, do we have enough active members to warrant moving to paid hosting?</p>

            <p>One is basically unworkable (we can&#39;t expect everyone to use AdBlock like I do, especially newbyes who don&#39;t know that there is this problem), and paying the premium account is really an extortion more than a premium account (Want to get rid of those ads that make your site unworkable?

            <p>I&#39;d vote option 4.  Examining the T-Board, it solves almost all the problems I have with the current Board, and a few minor issues that don&#39;t bother me in particular as well.

            <p>As such, it has dark places, but only if you want those dark places to show up for you. A subreddit is a subsection of the site specifically made for one topic or another. If we were to have the PPC there, we would not have to worry about a flood of NSFW things, because that is not what we are there for. We set the rules, tell Automod to block all NSFW things, make it clear what our rules are, and move on. Reddit is only a platform. The site itself (rarely) moderates itself. That is up to the individual moderators of the subreddit. The site respects the right of subreddits to make their own rules, however strict or loose they can be.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4oljFEvsiI">Here</a> is part one of a video series that explains what Reddit is and how to use it.

            <p>Honestly, I have been thinking about it for a while. It&#39;s not that hard to get a handle of, and we could even make it look closer to the Board if we wanted.

            <p>If they won&#39;t try and change the ads to make the board useable, I&#39;m not inclined to want to pay for it- especially not that much a month!

            <p>First of all, the Board isn&#39;t a security problem if you take steps to protect yourself, such as AdBlock (which you can enable ONLY FOR THE BOARD if you really want to, I promise, it doesn&#39;t automatically make you an unethical jerk) and a decent anti-malware program or two. It&#39;s harder to do that on mobile devices, granted, but who likes writing posts on their phones? I only do it if I don&#39;t have a choice and really feel strongly about posting right this minute anyway. If your mobile device is all you&#39;ve got... I dunno. How many people are actually using the Internet primarily or exclusively on a phone?<br><br>That said, I&#39;d be fine with adopting the T-Board if we can find a way to make it work. I&#39;d propose that we might be able to work out a way to spread out the costs of hosting among those of us with both stable jobs and a stable presence here (e.g. me and Phobos), so it wouldn&#39;t be too onerous for any one person. Plus maybe a PayPal account or something that other folks could use to chip in as/when they&#39;re able—could maybe serve as an emergency fund in case someone can&#39;t make their payment that month for some reason. And we could all sign something that says we agree that even though we&#39;re paying for server space we don&#39;t own the Board and won&#39;t get all weird about it, if that&#39;s a concern. We&#39;ve traditionally been rather queasy about Actual Authorities.<br><br>Above discussion of money could also apply to simply taking the current Board premium, too, if it turns out that would cost less.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty firmly against moving to a ProBoards-style forum. They&#39;re so chunky, and I like being able to see everything that&#39;s going on just by scrolling. And of course there&#39;s the concern that people will form sub-forum cliques, and never venture out to see what people are talking about elsewhere, thus diminishing the community spirit.<br><br>That&#39;s my two cents.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

In my eyes the benefits far outweigh the negatives-- all of which are security hazards for our computers.</p>

            <p>-I disagree fairly vehemently with the idea that a &#39;conventional&#39; style would be better for the PPC. My three arguments have always been:<br><br><u>1: Division</u><br><br>Splitting different types of thread into different forums reduces interaction between the people in them. I&#39;ve got new data on this - because I do it myself! Specifically, I routinely avoid the &#39;General Discussion&#39; or &#39;Chat&#39; areas of forums - I&#39;m there for a specific fandom or whatever, after all, why would I go into the place where they <i>don&#39;t</i> talk about that subject?<br><br>I don&#39;t want the PPC to fragment that way. This Board exists for <i>all</i> the fans of the PPC to get to know each other - not to create several groups who barely interact. Plus, it would run headlong into the Permission process, which requires newbies to, y&#39;know, interact while the PGs are around. ;)<br><br><u>2: Off-Topic</u><br><br>The PPC is <i>all about</i> going off-topic! How often have we seen mission plugs lead to a discussion of tea? Badfic threads which turn into mini RPs? Science geekery which becomes plans for a Gathering? There&#39;s no reasonable way to split things up, because we <i>don&#39;t</i> - and <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> - divide our threads that way. And without threads which can be conveniently sorted - what&#39;s the point of sub-forums at all, except to make me click more times to see everything?<br><br><u>3: Threading</u><br><br>Let&#39;s take Iximaz&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279792;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">dress thread</a> as an example. If you wanted to read the discussion of her raiding gear on a forum-style Board, you&#39;d have to skim over the entire thread to find the bits scattered around (hopefully identified by quotes, but you just know that Lacksidacksical can&#39;t get the hang of the quote function, and Summertide has one of her weird ideological problems with it). Here? You just read it, straight down the page. I&#39;ve never understood the idea that the Board&#39;s threads are confusing - I find them the most logical way to have conversations on the Internet!<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Security. Well, obviously I agree about the adverts - that was the whole reason this thread exists! But IP addresses are an incredibly useful tool for spotting trolls. Could you explain what the security risk is in having them up there? I&#39;m not familiar with it, so.)</p>

            <p>I will write a full post on what options I think would be best in the thread in just a moment. I wanted to respond to something these first.<br><br><u>1: Division</u><br><br>I would argue that there is already fragmentation in the PPC; it&#39;s just easier to ignore because of the structure of the board. Wait long enough, everything vanishes. Going my my observations, fans of different properties tend to flock together regardless of how things are put together. If a <i>LOTR</i> thread pops up, the <i>LOTR</i> fans have a little powwow. Missions in continuums that don&#39;t have a lot of followers on the board tend not to get read as much as something from <i>Harry Potter</i>.<br><br>Even despite that, I&#39;m still not particularly concerned about a drastic breaking apart of the community for two reasons. First off, the PPC is not exactly huge. It&#39;s currently what… about 25 to 35 regular posters, just as a guess? It&#39;s hard to make disparate groups when numbers are low. If it were at least doubled, then I would be a bit more wary.<br><br>Secondly, while it is true that people tend to rally around their own fandoms, you need to remember that we are all here for one fandom in particular: the PPC itself. I would like to believe that the members of this community have enough of an interest in this world to actually interact with their peers. If the idea of a &quot;general discussion&quot; area bothers you that much, it doesn&#39;t need to be included here.<br><br><u>2: Off-Topic</u><br><br>I don&#39;t really have an opinion on this one; it strikes me as part of being that &quot;creativity in chaos&quot; idea that&#39;s been talked about on the Board before. I don&#39;t hold with that concept, but to each their own. I will say, however,  that having to &quot;click more times to see everything&quot; is not really all that great of an excuse.<br><br><u>3: Threading</u><br><br>Like SeaTurtle said, I prefer one topic with one chain. The layout of the Board has always struck me as an ugly, confusing mess. Trying to find anything specific is near impossible without searching for keywords. And if it&#39;s fallen off the front page? Forget it.</p>

<li>True, people are always going to have people they&#39;re more friendly with than others based on shared interests and such. But supposing you&#39;re a fan of LotR <i>and</i> some really obscure fandom. Here, you can easily keep an eye on both conversations at once. It&#39;s easy to move between groups—and if it looks like some group you&#39;re not as familiar with are having a really great time chatting about their fandom, maybe you&#39;ll decide to see what all the fuss is about and go read the books, watch the show, etc., and join in. I&#39;ve personally looked into a bunch of fandoms my fellow PPCers were into over the years. It&#39;s nice to be in the know.<br><br>On a segmented forum, though, how often are you even going to look at a subforum about something you&#39;re not already familiar with?<br><br>2 and 3. Personally, even with quoting I find it tedious to keep track of who&#39;s replying to what in a single-chain system. It can be done, sure, but it can be done here, too. The Board puts everything in chronological order, and if the conversation goes in a new direction, so does the thread. It&#39;s perfectly intuitive to me.<br><br>What really worries me about one-topic, one-thread, though, is what happens when the conversation digresses. Does someone have to be the jerk who tells them to either take it to a more appropriate subforum or drop it, or do we just tolerate it and thus ruin the point of putting conversations in boxes in the first place? I don&#39;t much like it either way.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>Typing in the words <i>calling huinesoron</i> gives me two responses: this post, and that one. On the flip side, typing <i>the and</i> only throws up a handful of responses that include that exact string (sometimes as part of &#39;the Anduin&#39;).

No, it&#39;s a question <i>about</i> Permission, so I&#39;d probably better point out they&#39;re in the wrong section-<br><br>&quot;What are you doing?

            <p>Replying to this separately, since I missed your PS.<br><br>With them being <i>publically</i> available, not just viewable by mods, I can simply go to <a href="http://www.ip-adress.com/ip_tracer/">this website</a>, copy in the IP address, and figure out roughly where you live.  While this may seem like a nifty feature that allows you to figure out where your friends are, a stalker could quite easily exploit it.  You don&#39;t even have to be logged in to see this information - if someone uses their pen name on multiple websites, a quick Google search might turn up the Board.  And if one of those pen names has their real name, but not their location connected to it, a stalker might be able to combine the two, and turn up even more personal information.  I know that&#39;s a worst-case scenario, but it&#39;s still a risk.<br><br>As far as troll-spotting goes, there&#39;s little the average user can do about them anyways, aside from ignore them.  And then, I think the contents of the post should be enough to solve that issue without checking IPs.  A moderator should still be able to see IP addresses on other boards, or at least I&#39;ve seen mods on other boards track down IPs for users that were suspected to be trolls/sockpuppets.</p>

            <p>With respect to your arguments:<br><br>1. That is a good argument. I really don&#39;t have to say anything against this; one of the strengths of the current Board is to regroup anything and everything under one roof. That being said, I&#39;m a fan of organization and I like having all of my topics neatly categorized.<br><br>2. Ibid. <br><br>3. Once again tying into my preference of having one topic, one chain. I like being able to open something and scroll down and see everything in a neat, chronological order. <br><br>With regards to security: someone having an IP address is like giving them your home address. With that sequence of numbers someone can attempt to directly attack your computer and the general area you live in. Yes, an IP address is no big secret and yes, one can find it with enough work but I&#39;d rather not have it in the open just like that. </p>

            <p>That and an Adblocker would greatly improve security in my mind.
