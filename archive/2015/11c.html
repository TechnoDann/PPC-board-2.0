            <p>-First, Librarian/Aviator shipping is no more a trolllship? These cowrites with Des will surely be interesting... (and a sonic which does wood?

            <p>Exactly what it says on the tin. There are loads of good ideas for crossovers - but there are also heaps of insane, bewildering, and downright bonkers ones. Some of them you just want to set fire to, but others you kind of want to see, just to know how they end.<br><br>So this is where you get to share those ideas. &gt;:D<br><br>A request: if you&#39;re going to give an idea (and please do), write a bit of it! That&#39;s much more fun than just listing a massive heap of fandoms without context. And, hey, we&#39;re supposed to be a fanfic community, right?<br><br><hr>
<br><br><u>The Lord of the Union: The Fellowship of the South</u> (<i>Lord of the Rings</i>/US politics)<br><br>Governor Elrond of Louisiana stood with his back to the window, hands clasped behind his back. Before him, the two Texans - Congressman Frodo and Second Sub-Assistant Undersecretary Samwise - looked small, almost insignificant. Only the tightly-rolled paper clasped in Frodo&#39;s right hand hinted at their true importance.<br><br>&quot;President Sauron wishes to subjugate all America to his Democrat ideals,&quot; the Governor said. &quot;Only that treaty can prevent him - and only if it is brought before Congress ere his plans are full-wrought. And you, Frodo, have agreed to present it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will present the treaty,&quot; Congressman Frodo said firmly, &quot;though I do not know the protocol.&quot;<br><br>Governor Elrond smiled. &quot;There you will have help,&quot; he assured the young Congressman. &quot;Your faithful second sub-assistant undersecretary will accompany you; and as your guide through the murk of Washington politics…&quot; He gestured towards the figure who has just that moment entered the room.<br><br>Congressman Frodo gasped. &quot;Gandalf!&quot;<br><br>Senator Gandalf (Republican, Mississippi) smiled. &quot;Yes, Congressman,&quot; he said. &quot;I will accompany you, if you will have me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As for the rest,&quot; said the Governor, &quot;I have in mind a company, a fellowship, if you will: nine of those who have come to this meeting will travel together, and the nine representatives of good will stand against the nine Supreme Court Justices of evil.&quot; He paused, and bent forward slightly. &quot;Although,&quot; he added in an undertone, &quot;I hear rumours that three or perhaps even four of them would stand with us if they could. Of course, the majority will always direct the Supreme Court&#39;s actions, but if one more could be swayed…&quot; He shook his head, as if casting out the idea. &quot;It is a fantasy,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;And yet stranger things have come to pass,&quot; Senator Gandalf mused.<br><br>Governor Elrond nodded slowly. &quot;But we must attend the business at hand,&quot; he said. &quot;The members of the fellowship should represent the strong Republican states of the South. From South Carolina, Lieutenant Governor Boromir will travel with you…&quot;<br><br>~<br><br><i>Why are the Fellowship Republicans? Because, ultimately, they&#39;re about conservatism - keeping things the way they are, rather than letting Sauron change them.<br><br>Expect dramatic filibustering, foreign ambassadors standing in for elves, and a curious reluctance to refer to the Democrat President Sauron as the <b>Dark</b> Lord…</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br><u>Fallout: Sodor</u> (<i>Fallout</i> series/<i>Thomas the Tank Engine</i>)<br><br>Only one wagon of coal remained.<br><br>The tunnels of the Blue Mountain Quarry - the last stronghold of the true engines of Sodor - were dark these days, with no fuel to light them. Only a few of the engines lit their lamps at any one time, so as Gordon took the podium, he was lit mostly by the soft glow of carefully-banked boilers.<br><br>&quot;Since the Fat Controller was taken from us,&quot; the big blue engine puffed, &quot;you have trusted me to lead you through these dark times. As your leader, then, there is only one thing I can say: we must send an expedition out of the mountain, to find more coal.&quot;<br><br>Percy <i>wheeshed</i> in alarm, then hastily muffled the sound - there was no steam to waste, now. &quot;But there&#39;s diesels out there!&quot; he cried.<br><br>The assembled engines muttered amongst themselves, rocking back and forth on their tracks. The whispers grew louder and more agitated, until at last Gordon&#39;s whistle broke through them: <i>Poop! Poop!</i><br><br>&quot;I know the dangers,&quot; Gordon said, his brow furrowing in irritation. &quot;Do you think I would propose this if there was any other choice? Hmph.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We haven&#39;t been down into the very deepest mines,&quot; said Rheneas, one of the narrow-gauge engines. &quot;They still aren&#39;t safe, but… perhaps I could…&quot;<br><br>&quot;We can&#39;t risk it,&quot; Edward said firmly. &quot;Since James&#39; party was scrapped by the diesels, we don&#39;t have enough-&quot;<br><br>&quot;We <i>don&#39;t</i> know they were scrapped!&quot; Henry spluttered. &quot;They could still be out there-&quot;<br><br>&quot;And if they are, it&#39;s because they can&#39;t get back!&quot; Duck exclaimed. &quot;The diesels know where we are: it&#39;s much too dangerous to send <i>anyone</i> out!&quot;<br><br>Gordon whistled again, shaking the cave. &quot;We all knew this was coming,&quot; he said, &quot;and we have been preparing for it. Months ago, a brave volunteer came forward; we have been upgrading him, outfitting him with every weapon we could scrape together.&quot; He chuffed backward, yielding the spotlight. &quot;Thomas: come out.&quot;<br><br>A light blazed suddenly in the mining tunnel behind him. The engines gasped, rolling back, as Thomas the tank engine steamed into view. His blue paintwork was marred by armour plating and weapon mounts: cannons and energy weapons, railguns and flails. Under the scarring left by the first days of the diesels&#39; attack, his face held only grim determination.<br><br>The cavern was silent. Then Toby gave a low whistle of appreciation. &quot;Now <i>that</i>,&quot; he murmured, &quot;is a <i>Really</i> Useful Engine.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br><i>Steam engines: taking linear gameplay to a whole new level. The Island of Sodor is now either a post-apocalyptic hellscape (with mysteriously-intact railways everywhere)... or just a perfectly normal diesel/electric railway, completely unaware that vengeful, obsolete steam trains are just waiting to pounce.</i><br><br><hr>
<br><br><u>Percy Jackson and the Tyrant King</u> (<i>Percy Jackson</i>/<i>Jurassic World</i>)<br><br>Percy and Annabeth clung to each other as the <i>Velociraptor</i> stalked around their gyrosphere. It leant in towards the side panel, sniffed - and then uncurled its clawed fingers and entered a deft series of commands.<br><br>The pod slid open, spilling its demigod occupants onto the loamy flood. Percy scrabbled for Riptide, simultaneously reaching out to summon any water in the area - then froze as the raptor opened its mouth and let out a very human laugh.<br><br>&quot;Really, Percy Jackson,&quot; it hissed, bobbing its head in amusement, &quot;you think you can fight <i>me</i>? Has Camp Half-Blood taught you nothing?&quot;<br><br>Percy just stared, but at his side, Annabeth frowned in concentration. &quot;<i>Velociraptor</i>,&quot; she murmured, &quot;hunter, on an all-female island… Artemis?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very good, daughter of Athena.&quot; The <i>Velociraptor</i> seemed to settle slightly, resting its weight more firmly on its feet. &quot;And what do you think of my new form?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Percy said, his voice shaking. &quot;Why are you here? And, uh, why do you look like that?&quot;<br><br>Artemis laughed again. &quot;Why <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> we be here?&quot; she asked. &quot;This island is the pinnacle of Western civilisation - the height of your human science, your creativity, your hubris. Where else would the Gods of Olympus be found?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re <i>all</i> here?&quot; Annabeth shook her head. &quot;My mother would never-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your mother,&quot; Artemis said smugly, &quot;was the first to come. She makes a very handsome <i>Troodon</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, wait.&quot; Percy waved his hand in the air. &quot;I still don&#39;t understand.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s a surprise,&quot; Annabeth murmured.<br><br>&quot;<i>Why</i> are you here?&quot; Percy asked again, ignoring her. &quot;I thought you were… well, <i>our</i> gods. Human gods. Not… creepy murder-reptiles.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Humans,&quot; Artemis hissed, flexing her sickle claws. &quot;So self-centred… but I&#39;m afraid these dinosaurs are better than you in, oh, every way. My raptors are stronger, smarter, more loyal…&quot; She sniffed the air, rose up onto her toes, her body tensing. &quot;And better hunters,&quot; she added. &quot;And they are nearly here… I suggest you run.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br><i>Zeus is a </i>T. rex<i>, Poseidon is a </i>Mosasaurus<i>, and Hades is doubtless stuck as something like a </i>Stygiomoloch<i>, with its &#39;Head-Dome of Darkness&#39;. Since we&#39;ve already done the Titanomacy and the Gigantomachy, I guess we&#39;ll either do Hera&#39;s attempt to incite a revolt against Zeus (with her as the </i>I. rex<i>, naturally), or the Trojan War and the divine infighting that occurred then.</i><br><br><hr>

So very, very wrong. We should have known that Mother Nature would take offense at our meddling, but her revenge came in ways that we could never have expected.<br><br>Some Vault-Tec officials in Central America found DNA from all manner of extinct creatures, combining them with the genetic material of modern-day animals to fill the gaps left in the genes. There was even talk of a few being specially bred for military use.<br>It didn&#39;t go well.<br>Details on what happened are scarce, but the resulting creatures looked very different from what were supposed to have been exact replicas of the original creatures. Stronger... smarter... with more teeth. They escaped their containment, wreaking havoc. Now, it is no longer mammals who rule the continent of South America. Instead, monstrous hybrids stalk the land, ruling over a twisted parody of the ancient world.<br><br>On an island off the coast of Asia, Vault-Tec found another source of extinct life: an entire ecosystem of animals that had seemingly been plucked from the reaches of time and space and placed here to evolve. Specimens were quickly taken off the island for study, but one creature became particularly notorious: an ape of unprecedented size and strength, worshipped as a god by native cultures. With such primal power at their fingertips, Vault-Tec immediately began to clone the creature for some kind of military program, as well as an extinct creature that was said to be some sort of demon that the ape&#39;s kind had killed off centuries ago. But Vault-Tec had no time for legends when there was science to be done.<br>They should have listened.<br>Whatever the Vault-Tec scientists had done to the creatures of that island, they were unable to get the creatures to submit to human control. In the bloodbath that ensued, the creatures of that lost world escaped. As if we needed more goddamn dinosaurs.<br>But the island had one last secret waiting to be taken. Hidden at the center of the island was a site housing technology beyond anything humanity has ever devised. Vault-Tec was naturally all over it, but the biggest breakthrough came from what must have been holding facilities inside the ship, most of which contained lifeforms like nothing on Earth held in what appeared to be a form of stasis. Unable to resist the allure of examining alien life, the scientists opened the cells, eager to unlock whatever secrets the aliens had within them.<br>The second those damned monsters were released, it was game over.<br><br>Seemingly to rub in even further the fact that we were screwed, another one of Vault-Tec&#39;s experiments was looking into the possibilities of alternate dimensions and time travel. What they found was not too happy at being disturbed. Monsters from the past, the future, and from some hellish dimension poured out of the lab, fleeing into the countryside.<br><br>Diseases suddenly began to mutate into new, horrifying diseases: a mind-controlling worm, an honest-to-goodness zombie virus, and some kind of mutator that killed humans but had incredible effects on apes, making them smarter, more human-like... more hostile.<br><br>The atomic bombs just made it worse. Animals began to evolve to defend themselves against these new threats-cattle as large as elephants with bulletproof hides, giant sea serpent lizards, even carnivorous rabbits, of all things.<br><br>But these horrors were far from the worst things to come.<br>After the bombs were dropped, creatures of sizes previously thought to be unimaginable began to arise, either from their eons-long slumber or mutated by nuclear fallout. Mantises the size of planes, supersonic pterosaurs, birds as big as battleships... but one stood above the rest, figuratively and literally. An ancient alpha predator, at the very top of its primordial ecosystem.<br>We call him Godzilla, King of the Monsters.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<i>Well, here&#39;s my clusterhump of Biblical proportions. I&#39;ve already got a way to avoid having to characterize anything as well: don&#39;t have characters. This beauty would have a kind of bestiary format, going over the various monstrosities that have developed in this hellscape. With all of these franchises to go over, it would be an enormous undertaking.<br>I imagine that the nuclear fallout would also affect these introduced creatures as well, maybe create some Chaos Effect-style hybrids. With this story, the world after it ended is a whole lot more dangerous.</i></p>

            <p>Nanoha&#39;s family moved to the UK before she was born for whatever reasons (probably to flee from Shiro&#39;s enemies) so that her name ends up registered in Hogwarts at birth. Hayate probably would also have to be relocated, though not necessary in the same timeframe And you would also have to move everything in Nanoha canon in time by several years. (Hey, it&#39;s supposed to be a crack crossover, right?)  <br><br>So Nanoha then ends up going to Hogwarts, where she may or may not have serious problems because her magic is probably not compatible with HP spells. Then she while she is in her first year, the Jewel Seed incident happens right there and that is also where Yuuno and Fate arrive. <br><br> <br> </p>

No bite marks! He came in, but he didn&#39;t bite her - yet!&quot;<br><br>Alfred crossed himself and took out a crucifix, pointing it in the four directions of the compass to ward off the evil of the vampire count.

He&#39;s a Time Lord, after all, and tools such as he has would not be welcome - especially considering that what Abronsious and Alfred did in the village wasn&#39;t taken well, and they were humans trying to stop the real alpha vampire of a real gigantic vampire flock.

A green-pocalypse, if you will.&quot;<br><br>Myra did her best to ignore him as she drove.

            <p>Long ago, I had a plotbunny for a <i>Harry Potter</i> x <i>Jekyll &amp; Hyde</i> crossover. Basically, the premise is that Jekyll&#39;s formula went wrong because some magical ingredients were dumped in a Muggle chemist&#39;s shop by a wizard on the run from Magical Law Enforcement for possession of said ingredients. At the end of his story, Jekyll doesn&#39;t die; instead, he finds his way into the Wizarding World and becomes a Hogwarts professor—DADA or Potions, I dunno.<br><br>Unfortunately, I have no idea what the rest of the story is. Unless I were to make it a modern spin on the Jekyll &amp; Hyde story, it would have to be set in the late 1800s, which means I&#39;d have to make up pretty much the entire cast. Dumbledore might be around somewhere, but I think he was probably busy with Grindelwald at the time. Point being, aside from Jekyll, the whole cast would be OCs, and that&#39;s a lot of work—not to mention the research involved in putting together a picture of what Hogwarts and the Wizarding World were like back then. Hence why I never wrote it.<br><br>If anyone wants to adopt the plotbunny and give it a good home, though, feel free. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Did Jekyll know about Hyde in the original story? Because if not, I can imagine the plot centering around a group of students trying to track the monster roaming Hogwarts, with the enthusiastic help of their Potions Master... &gt;:D<br><br><i>[The] Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i> was published in 1886; Albus Dumbledore was born in summer 1881, apparently. So how about setting the story in 1892/3, and having Albus as a first-year student? :D<br><br>Actually, that assumes that Hogwarts used a 21st century British school age breakdown in the 19th century, which is... actually more solid than I thought. Per <a href="http://www.victorianschool.co.uk/schoolday.html">a random Google search</a>, from 1870 children had to go to school from 5-10, which was raised to 11 in 1893; presumably, the Wizarding World let its children be taught to read etc at Muggle schools, then took over when they left. (This would explain why Hogwarts utterly fails to teach any of the standard subjects, such as, y&#39;know, maths - its system comes from an age before there was <i>any</i> schooling after 11.)<br><br>So set it in 1893 - the year that Albus Dumbledore is a first-year student <i>for the second year running</i>, since he came in at 10 in &#39;92 (which assumes a late summer birthday) and is now 11... which has just become the youngest age. :D That gives you internal conflict for the characters, a sense that they need to &#39;prove themselves&#39; in some undefined fashion... and right on time, they hear rumours of a monster known only as <i>the Hide</i>.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Wow, and Dumbledore&#39;s family makes for prime drama. A loose-cannon sister (now all of eight years old) held effectively prisoner by his mother, a father in Azkaban for assaulting Muggles, a brother who&#39;s just been told he can&#39;t go to Hogwarts next year but will have to keep mingling with Muggles until the year after... shards and shells, this is prime story material. (No, I refuse to take it myself. Not my fandom.)</p>

            <p>Molly had mentioned that her penpal was from Japan, so I was pretty surprised when a clearly Caucasian girl answered the door to their hotel room.  She looked like nothing so much as Murphy&#39;s kid sister - cute, petite, blonde, and probably capable of kicking my ass five ways to Sunday.  &quot;You are Molly Carpenter and Harry Dresden, correct?&quot; she said in a calm, serious voice that gave me vaguely Vulcan vibes.  Her accent was some variant of British; I&#39;m not exactly up on my BBC, so anything more precise than that is beyond me.<br><br>Molly looked a little awkward, but not too surprised.  &quot;That&#39;s us.  You&#39;re Saber, right?  Rin&#39;s told me a lot about you.&quot;<br><br>Saber nodded, and gave Molly a reassuring smile.  &quot;It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.&quot;  She shook hands with me, crossing the rather hastily-erected ward on the room in the process, and I got a feel of her...aura, I suppose.  The amount of power coming off her was incredible.  It wasn&#39;t so much that she had a massive amount of magical energy; it felt more like she was completely composed of it.  From the Padawan&#39;s wide-eyed expression, she&#39;d gotten the same thing.  &quot;Rin and Shirou are still preparing themselves,&quot; the girl continued, &quot;although I believe it would be more accurate to say they are both preparing Shirou.  Please, come inside.&quot;<br><br>We followed her into the main room of their suite.  Molly and I took seats on the couch, and Saber excused herself to go get the others.  &quot;Who&#39;s Shirou?&quot; I whispered to Molly, once we were alone.<br><br>&quot;Rin&#39;s boyfriend,&quot; she said, barely paying attention to the question.<br><br>&quot;And Saber, or whatever she&#39;s called?&quot;<br><br>Molly looked troubled.  &quot;...Based on the sense I got from her letters, Rin&#39;s girlfriend.  But she didn&#39;t mention anything about... <i>that</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;d imagine that&#39;s not the kind of thing you casually mention... wait, what?&quot;  Okay, so it was probably a lot less relevant to the situation than everything else going on, but there are certain things a man isn&#39;t allowed to overlook.<br><br>Molly shrugged.  &quot;It sounded complicated.  I didn&#39;t poke too hard.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Molly?&quot; called an unfamiliar female voice.  The speaker this time looked slightly more like what I&#39;d pictured in my head, an Asian girl around the same age as Molly.  Though I hadn&#39;t expected the short skirt and thigh-high socks to exist outside of it.<br><br>Molly broke into a grin.  &quot;Rin!&quot; She stood up and hugged the other girl, who returned it with rather less enthusiasm.<br><br>&quot;Ah, and you&#39;re Mr. Dresden, right?&quot; she said to me in accented but clear English.<br><br>&quot;Yeah.  Nice to meet a friend of Molly&#39;s.&quot;<br><br>She smiled politely and shook my hand. &quot;I could say the same thing about you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oi, Tohsaka.  Is this them?&quot;  A boy of about the same age as Rin came out of their room, wearing a dress shirt and a slightly grumpy expression.  He might have looked pretty average, but I got the sense that he was a lot tougher than you&#39;d think at first glance.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he could hold out for a few minutes against the Summer or Winter Knight.<br><br>The blonde girl they&#39;d called Saber... I&#39;d be surprised if one of the Knights could hold out for a few minutes against her.<br><br>Which raised the question of how exactly Molly&#39;s penpal got involved with someone that high on the scale of powerful magical beings.  And what kind of problem they had that would require us to help out with.<br><br>***<br><br>Okay, so the various setting mechanics (not to mention timelines) probably mean that such a crossover wouldn&#39;t work very well, but I just want to see the characters interact.  I&#39;m not sure what the actual plot would be; probably something involving the Knights of the Cross, since it&#39;s a good excuse to bring in Shirou&#39;s <s>sword fetish</s> specific talents.  Mandatory is a bit where the female characters all commiserate on exactly what sort of idiocy they have to put up with on a daily basis from Shirou and Harry.</p>

            <p><u>REALLY?</u> (<i>The Secret World of Alex Mack</i> X <i>Worm</i>)<br><br>I stared at her. She stared back.<br><br>As powers went, she had it pretty much made. It was a really unconventional Trump mix (insofar as you got conventional Trump mixes); lightning bolts, a transformation into goop, and telekinesis that didn&#39;t have a Manton limit that we&#39;d been able to find. I really didn&#39;t know why she hadn&#39;t gone into the cape game with powers like that. Hell, any Wards team worth their salt would be climbing over each other to get her on the team. But nope, here she was, staring me down in a van in San Francisco, the last place I could run.<br><br>Crushed as I was between Bitch&#39;s slowly deflating dogs, and as much as I was really not okay with small metal spaces like the van we&#39;d hired, today had been a good day. Tattletale was sat next to me, Regent had somehow managed to lounge in the back of a speeding van, we&#39;d beaten up a local gang of street thugs and we had a lot of their loot as working capital for the next few days. Everything had gone off completely without a hitch. And then there was the new girl, in a makeshift costume and a frankly godawful hat (Regent kept calling it the condom cap), but she&#39;d proved really useful in a fight. It turned out that people were much easier for Regent to control if she gave them a quick jolt first, which was very useful for us, and that her goop state was semi-invulnerable.<br><br>&quot;So,&quot; she said, &quot;how&#39;d you get your powers?&quot;<br><br>I winced. I could remember having this exact same lack-of-conversation with the other Undersiders back in the day. Tattletale opened her mouth and then, in the shock of the year, closed it again. Then she spoke.<br><br>&quot;How&#39;d you get yours, newbie?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh. Funny story, actually. I was just going to school and I got soaked in this stuff called GC-161 when a truck hit me. The local factory was--&quot;<br><br>&quot;REALLY?&quot; Tattletale all but screamed. Grue slammed on the brakes and we all rattled around inside the van for a bit. &quot;[Censored for the Board]ing REALLY? A [see previous censorship]ing <i>diet pill</i>?&quot;<br><br>I couldn&#39;t help it. I echoed Tattletale&#39;s thoughts.<br><br>Parallel universes had <i>all</i> the luck.</p>

            <p>Yep PL vs PW was  a crossover I loved to see become a reality. Even if I don&#39;t have it myself.  <br><br>As for other crossovers I&#39;d love to see but can&#39;t write about very well on an iPad they are really just silly ones. <br>I want to see a good Assissans Creed crossover with Hamilton the Broadway show. Or even Assissans Creed meets Liberty Kids just to see how&#39;d it would turn out.  Assissans Creed with any history based series would be nice.  Anything Layton Brothers Mystery room related would be cool too. <br><br>If you are serious about the Lord of the rings crossover with southern politics I have a book about some Rebels&#39; journey to Mexico where they attempted to create a second US south that could be interesting to see.<br><br></p>

            <p>As someone who watched the Liberty&#39;s Kids series when they were young, I can safely say that a crossover with Assassin&#39;s Creed would be amazing, although it would be awesome seeing the Magic School Bus go all over time and meeting all of the various assassins. Bonus points if the guy whose genetic memories we&#39;ve been going over for the whole series tags along.</p>

            <p>Obviously, given the events of the <i>Jurassic World</i> film, the park will be shut down... right? I mean, all those guests saw the nasty vicious meat-eating dinosaurs escape and kill everyone, right?<br><br>Well, actually... no. Thinking back on it, <i>the only escape the visitors saw was the aviary</i>. They never knew about the <i>I. rex</i>, or the raptors loose in the field. They were all gone long before the final battle, so they have no idea about that, either. With the exception of the main cast (who can be silenced pretty easily if necessary) and the staff of the park/InGen personnel (ditto), all anyone knows - or needs to know - is this:<br><br>-The owner of the park, Simon Masrani, took up a park helicopter without his trainer, even though he wasn&#39;t a qualified pilot.<br><br>-On that flight, he managed to lose control and crash into the aviary, breaking some of the panels.<br><br>-This allowed the <i>Pteranodon</i> and <i>Dimorphodon</i> to escape and flock to the visitors&#39; area.<br><br>Yes, there were casualties. If Masrani had survived, he would definitely be facing criminal prosecution (say the park&#39;s new administrators). It isn&#39;t the pterosaurs&#39; fault, of course - they&#39;re just wild animals - but they have been a concern since the original park, and this incident proves that they simply aren&#39;t fit to be used as an attraction. Jurassic World will therefore be relocating the entire flock to a secondary site, to live out their lives in humane conditions. The aviary site will be used for a thrilling new attraction: a rollercoaster-slash-monorail through the domain of the feathered, flying dinosaurs, <i>Microraptor</i> and <i>Archaeopteryx</i>! (These dinosaurs are far too small to attack humans, and anyway, the aviary will be reinforced and designated an absolute no-fly zone.)<br><br>Any rumours you may have heard of <i>Godzilla</i>-like murderous hybrids are exactly what they sound like - sensationalist sci-fi nonsense made up by the gutter press to sell papers. As for that purported &#39;footage&#39; - really? My kid can make CG better than that on his iPhone, and he&#39;s 11 (says the PR rep, trying for a laugh from the reporters).<br><br>We will be using the down-time to undertake a full review of <i>all</i> our security precautions, despite the fact that - I must stress again - not a single one of them failed during the recent incident. And let me tell you about some of the great new ideas our techies have come up with! Do you wanna see <i>T. rex</i> hunting its goats on the open plain? Yeah, I just bet you do...<br><br><i>This concludes the statement from the Jurassic World marketing board. The park administration has refused to answer further questions about the presence of armed forces on Isla Nublar, or the unexplained death toll among park employees during the cleanup following the incident...</i><br><br>(Sadly, I doubt they&#39;ll be re-opening the park for the next film - it&#39;s a story we&#39;ve just told, so there would be very little point. But I can&#39;t see a fundamental reason they <i>couldn&#39;t...</i> can you?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Why not create a trio of dinosaurs that generally haven&#39;t been popular in the media: Deinocheirus, Therizinosaurus, and Gigantoraptor. The names of these guys alone would definitely draw guests in, and the sheer weirdness of them will also contribute to their &quot;wow&quot; factor.<br><br>As for the monorail, why stop there? Throw in the bat-winged miniature dragon, Yi qi, and the tiny flying theropod Rahonavis! Heck, why not add the ancestor of Triceratops, Psittacosaurus, the feathered titan Beipaiosaurus, and the platypus of the dinosaur world, Chilesaurus?<br><br>Miss the idea of the old park? Don&#39;t worry! As of now, Brachiosaurus and Sauroposeidon are roaming the Gyrosphere Plain! (Temporary name; the idea of gyrospheres is now being scrapped in favor of a monorail system for additional security. The absence of the Apatosaurus can be explained away as a disease outbreak and/or replaced by new ones.) Furthermore, we&#39;ll be adding several more herbivorous dinosaurs: the titans Shantungasaurus, and Charonosaurus, the peaceful Corythosaurus, the lords of horns, Coahuilaceratops and Rubeosaurus, and the hippo of dinosaurs, Lurdusaurus!<br><br>We haven&#39;t forgotten those looking for a dash of danger: our new Crocodile Swamp features the three largest crocodilians to ever live: Deinosuchus, Purussaurus, and Sarcosuchus!<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;m going all-out, if you can&#39;t tell.</p>

            <p>Though I see you&#39;ve spent a bit of time in the Triassic here, with <i>Yi Qi</i> and... er... okay, I was guessing the crocodilians were Triassic, but apparently not. Hrm. I actually know very little about the Triassic - pretty much &#39;what showed up on that one episode of <i>Walking With Dinosaurs</i> (aka <i>Procompsognathus</i>-or-something, <i>Plateosaurus</i>, cynodonts, a crocodilian, and... some lumpen things which existed to show how fast dinosaurs are). But I&#39;m <a href="http://markwitton-com.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/the-lifestyle-of-tanystropheus-part-1.html">starting to get the impression</a> it was a pretty bonkers period. I mean, it had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longisquama"><i>Longisquama</i></a>, that&#39;s pretty mad.<br><br>I do wonder if InGen even <i>can</i> clone Triassic beasties, though. We know they get some of their DNA from bones - it&#39;s mentioned in the original book - but there&#39;s a massive difference between 66 and 200+ Ma. Has anyone put together a temporal map of the species in the JP films, to see if there&#39;s any pattern? (I&#39;m guessing there isn&#39;t, but am willing to be surprised).<br><br>Actually, low availability of DNA might explain the &#39;let&#39;s make a toothosaurus&#39; plan. It&#39;s all very well saying &#39;just breed a <i>Concavenator</i>!&#39;, but if they&#39;ve only got the (hang on, let me check <a href="http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Triceratops">the wiki</a>) twenty species seen in the films (plus some fragments for <i>I. rex</i>), then they don&#39;t have that many options... and it&#39;s a good way to make use of those chunks of <i>Gigantosaurus</i> and <i>Therazinosaurus</i> DNA they&#39;ve got that they can&#39;t make viable animals out of.<br><br>In fact, given that (other than the <i>T. rex</i> baseline and <i>Velociraptor</i> for intelligence) none of the species listed as <a href="http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Indominus_rex">used for the <i>I. rex</i></a> are seen in the park, I think that&#39;s a really good theory.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: The &#39;dinosaurs&#39; seen in the films, according to the wiki, are - brachiosaurus, dilophosaurus, gallimimus, parasaurolophus, triceratops, t. rex, velociraptor, compsognathus, corythosaurus, edmontosaurus, mamenchisaurus, pachycephalosaurus, pteranodon, stegosaurus, ankylosaurus, ceratosaurus, spinosaurus, apatosaurus, dimorphodon, mosasaurus.

            <p>The Triassic was NUTS. Giant tyrannosaur-sized bipedal land-crocs, a flying reptile with wings for legs, zipper-jawed sea reptiles: basically, it&#39;s like evolution got drunk. (Also, Yi qi is from the Jurassic.)<br><br>Concerning the DNA, there is another option: recreating the species either with creatures they already have or with modern animals. Tanystropheus, for instance, could probably be made with snake and lizard DNA, with just a hint of Mosasaurus.<br><br>Concerning the DNA problem, they have several more samples than that: another mosasaur, Metriacanthosaurus, Baryonyx, Microceratus, Suchomimus, Herrerasaurus, and Troodon. While they aren&#39;t in any of the films, official sites and games have them.<br><br>You have a point, but it&#39;s already pretty clear that Ingen is capable of manipulating DNA to do whatever with it. Need a Therizinosaurus and don&#39;t have the DNA? Just take a Gallimimus and alter its genetics-they do have at least a bit of Therizinosaurus, because the I-rex has been confirmed to have its DNA to make the arms. But even if they don&#39;t do that, they definitely have the funds to find more genetic material-the fake website Universal made even hints that they have mammoth DNA.</p>

            <p>Well, colour me surprised. (It&#39;s a sort of orangey shade of purple, I think.) I figured it was a Triassic weirdo for sure.<br><br>I kind of wonder whether a lot of InGen&#39;s critters aren&#39;t hybrids anyway. Can you honestly tell me <i>Velociraptor baldandtallis</i> isn&#39;t a hybrid of <i>V. mongoliensis</i> and some larger therapod, maybe even <i>T. rex</i> itself? But on the flip side... how much of their work is planned, and how much is just &#39;throwing science at the wall to see what sticks&#39;? In the second book, someone (Malcolm?) says that most InGen dinosaur eggs don&#39;t actually produce viable creatures - the hatchery sequence in the first book/film was carefully stage-managed, using the few viable eggs produced on Site B. So was <i>I. rex</i> just the first toothy hybrid that survived to grow up? I can imagine the conversation now:<br><br>MASRANI: So, Dr. Wu, how&#39;s the work going on that fake <i>Therizinosaurus</i> you promised us? Let me tell you, our investors are <i>eager</i> to know what you&#39;ve got lined up.<br><br>WU: There have been... a few small problems.<br><br>MASRANI: Problems, Henry? You said you&#39;d have a new dinosaur for me by the end of this quarter; am I going to have to tell our investors we can&#39;t deliver?<br><br>WU: Not at all! You may simply have to... adjust their expectations a little.<br><br>MASRANI: ... go on.<br><br>WU: The <i>Gallimimus</i> and <i>Therizinosaurus</i> DNA did not... combine well. We had to look for a new base material.<br><br>MASRANI: But we don&#39;t <i>have</i> any other-<br><br>WU: We used <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>.<br><br>MASRANI: ... okay.<br><br>WU: And <i>Velociraptor</i>. We needed to increase the stability of the beta-oriented-<br><br>MASRANI: Sure, sure.<br><br>WU: There were a few other components as well.<br><br>MASRANI: But Henry... did it <i>work</i>?<br><br>WU: If by that you mean, did we make a therizinosaur? No.<br><br>MASRANI: Henry, Henry... what am I going to tell the investors?<br><br>WU: That we have something better. Something special. Something never before seen on Earth.<br><br>[Dr. Wu pushes aside the curtain, revealing a man-sized white therapod with giant claws and spines, tearing ravenously at a hunk of cow.]<br><br>WU: I call her... <i>Indominus rex</i>.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure that contradicts the film canon, but I had fun writing it, so who cares? :P<br><br>(Also, the various mutant hybrids in Dr. Wu&#39;s lab suggest that he&#39;s still learning to control the process properly.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If you want a weird Triassic flier, look up Sharovipteryx.<br><br>Concerning the raptors, I think the same way: my bet is that the raptors were made from incomplete Velociraptor DNA that was also contaminated with Gallimimus and Achillobator genes, so Deinonychus genes were used to fill in the gaps, with some Utahraptor accidentally being thrown in as well. T-rex is also likely to have been thrown in, but maybe some Dakotaraptor genetics were introduced as well by complete accident.<br><br>Which reminds me: in the early days of their being known to science, both Therizinosaurus and Deinocheirus were believed to be large theropods with some of the most terrifying arms in existance. Maybe Wu was partially inspired by them when he made the Indominus?<br><br>(As a note, I think that having two theropods like that would make an awesome movie, especially if they worked as a team.)</p>

            <p>... is that <i>Velociraptor brokenwristor</i> consists of up to seven feathered species, somehow <i>still</i> producing an unfeathered critter. From a Real World perspective, Henry Wu is <i>terrible</i> at his job. ^_^ (No, we didn&#39;t know that any of those were feathered when JP was written/made - but the bones knew, as it were.

            <p>There is the frog DNA, and most likely some crocodile and monitor lizard as well: in one of the deleted scenes for the kitchen scene in the first film, one of the raptors had a snakelike tongue, so I&#39;m guessing that there&#39;s some squamate DNA in there.<br><br>Personally, I liked the Ornithomimid Ground Sloth version of it-although granted, it was also the only one I was ever really exposed to growing up. However, there is another giant ornithomimid that&#39;s a bit more conservative in its appearance-it&#39;s called <i>Beishanlong</i>, and it&#39;s only a little bit smaller than Deinocheirus.<br><br>Wait, the London NHM has a pair?! So does the American Museum of Natural History in New York! I practically grew up in that museum, and I remember always bringing people to those arms and being smug when they couldn&#39;t guess what it was. Considering that they&#39;re the guys who were behind the expedition that found it, it&#39;s not that surprising, but I guess that it makes snese that it hasn&#39;t changed on my side of the ocean: the Museum only has so much space in the dinosaur hall. Another <i>T. rex</i>-sized animal definitely wouldn&#39;t be able to fit, although there is going to be an expansion soon that&#39;s gonna be big enough for a full-sized <i>Dreadnoughtus</i> skeleton, so maybe we&#39;ll see a restoration of the real-life Crocoduck as well.<br><br>Note: Is is weird that I take an abnormal amount of joy in the fact that there are now three different extinct animals that could be called Crocoducks? (<i>Sigilmassasaurus/Spinosaurus, Deinocheirus, Anatosuchus</i>) Suck it, Ray Comfort!</p>

            <p>is that it depicted two species that are strongly suspected to be fish-snatchers and specialized small animal-eaters, respectively, and had them go full horror movie mode on a huge, screaming crowd of animals roughly their own size.  Imagine modern condors escaping a zoo enclosure and bull rushing a huge crowd instead of being frightened by the noise and size of the &quot;herd&quot; and running away.  (I know condors are more scavenger than predator, but I also know from seeing certain zookeepers with big gashes down their arms that at least my zoo&#39;s Andean condor isn&#39;t afraid of a one-on-one fight with an equalish sized animal.  I still don&#39;t think he would take on a group of thousands, especially if he had just found himself in new, unfamiliar territory.)  Animals try to <i>avoid</i> fights, because injuries don&#39;t lend themselves well to procreating.  Self-preservation is a number one instinct!<br><br>Plus, (I&#39;ll admit, depending on their senses of smell and hearing), the <i>Pterandon</i> in particular would have been far more likely to head north towards the sea, where the tasty fishes, precious, would be found, rather than charge down the mainland towards an increasingly noisy and intimidating crowd of humans.  And that&#39;s to say nothing about the fact that both flocks of both species all went the same direction.  Wouldn&#39;t they spread out and search for nesting sites?<br><br>As to your theory, I&#39;m sure InGen will try it.  I don&#39;t know that they can keep it covered up very long, though.  Out of all the families of all the employees killed by <i>Velociraptor</i> or the <i>Indominus Rex</i>, at least some will demand to see the bodies, and it doesn&#39;t take a fifth grader to tell the difference between beak bites and six foot jaw bites.  Plus, let&#39;s not forget the two biggest sources of leakage: two teenage boys.  Older Boy in particular, with his wandering eyes, will tell pretty much any girl he&#39;s trying to impress about what happened.  The facts will escape, eventually.<br><br>—doctorlit realizes Older Boy probably has a name, but only seems to remember dinosaur names.  Oh well.</p>

            <p>And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimorphodon"><i>Dimorphodon</i></a> doesn&#39;t have a <i>Velociraptor jurassicparkus</i> skull, either. I think it&#39;s abundantly clear that Dr. Wu has engaged in genetic manipulation on a far greater scale than he admits. Probably half the creatures in Jurassic World are hybrids - the mosacroc, the pteroraptors, the raptorgators themselves...<br><br>The main theory I&#39;ve seen about the &#39;pterosaur KILL&#39; thing is that they were stressed and panicking, which causes animals to lash out. Which doesn&#39;t exactly explain flying long-distance to the visitors&#39; centre... and doesn&#39;t ring terribly true regardless. Perhaps the wind was blowing the scent of burgers from the south?<br><br>[Puts on InGen/Masrati hat] Our deepest sympathies are with the families of those employees whose lives were lost during the recent incident. While the possibility of fatal injury was included in their contracts, none of us ever expected such a terrible loss of life. Unfortunately, many of the bodies were severely damaged while attempting to contain the incident inside the aviary itself - falling glass, pterosaur feeding habits, one regrettable firearms accident, and the generally untamed nature of the area all contributing - and to avoid alarming the loved ones of our employees, it was deemed best to cremate the bodies on-site.<br><br>[Alternately, some waffle about tropical/pterosaur diseases could be constructed, provided it can be done in such a way as not to make the visitors think <i>they</i> could be infected.]<br><br>We have all heard the stories spread by two relatives of the disgraced former assistant director, Redhead Highheels. While we are sure Zack and Notzack were deeply traumatised by their unauthorised excursion into prohibited areas of the park, the sad fact is that that is exactly what they were doing. It is entirely natural that they should wish to spin the tale into something &#39;larger than life&#39;, as it were - why talk about the majestic <i>Ankylosaurus</i> when you can claim to have met <i>Indominus rex</i> - or, to hear them talk, <i>Diabolus godzillex</i>! [Pause for laughter] But what can I say - boys will be boys, eh?<br><br>In entirely unrelated news, the opening of <i>Verizon presents Indominus rex</i> has been postponed until after the results of the security review have been thoroughly processed. [Because &#39;indefinite postponement&#39; is far easier to swing than &#39;cancelled&#39;.]<br><br>Then you get your CG team to mock up some fake videos of about six different, mutually-contradictory &#39;REAL Jurassic World incident&#39;s, plus a few &#39;eyewitness accounts&#39; which disagree with them all, and leak them through untraceable assets, so that any evidence of the original gets subsumed under the tide of viral nonsense. ^_^<br><br>hS, expecting the letter from InGen any day now...</p>

            <p>Seriously, the questions cover so many different topics that I wouldn&#39;t be able to put them all in the subject line. But first, that RP that I started last month and still haven&#39;t given a conclusion to! *grins awkwardly* I apologize; lots of stuff happened, but I should have gotten back to that by now. I will be posting the closing remarks <b>Sunday</b> (I don&#39;t want to do it on Thanksgiving). <br><br>Now, so many different questions! <br><br>First: I know there is some reason why no one can spork &quot;My Immortal,&quot; but is there something we as a community could do about it? Seriously, that thing needs dealing with (she says as she, in improper grammatical form, ends a sentence with a preposition).<br><br>Second: Is anyone on here a bow hunter? My AU 10th Walker (that fic I asked for advice on in my very first post; it&#39;s coming along nicely!) has taken a dramatic shift, and now participates in the sport. But I hardly know anything about it: I&#39;m already looking into resources. For now, any advice on any aspect of the subject would be appreciated. <br><br>Third: Said 10th Walker is also claiming to be a Seer, using her vague-ish memories of the book to pass as one. I actually have three questions with this: <br><br>a) Will her &quot;prophecies&quot; be viewed as less trustworthy since she has claimed that they came in a dream? Most of the major prophecies (Malbeth, Glorfindel, even Aragorn&#39;s mini-foresight before Moria) are all just spoken. The only dreams I can think of off the top of my head are Boromir and Faramir&#39;s shared dream-message about going to Rivendell. <br><br>b) How might Glorfindel, who seems a fairly logical interviewer given his one earlier foresight, approach someone who claims foresight? (Keeping in mind that Amy is a weirdo from Bree with no obvious ties to Numenor or Elves, and was also brought to Middle-earth by Sauron for the express purpose of messing stuff up: not that she knows that.) <br><br>c) Whilst trolling on the internet for these answers, I found an article on a LotR wiki (A role-playing wiki, actually) that claimed that the Numenoreans had mortal wizards who used alchemy and astrology to divine the future: I don&#39;t remember anything like that, but my memory of Numenor is roughly equivalent to the size of a kumquat compared to a BMW. <br><br>Fourth (and now for something totally different): How&#39;re everyone&#39;s Nanovels coming along?<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Before anyone goes and declares that they&#39;re taking on &quot;My Immortal,&quot; I would invite them to stop and think about something: why do you want to spork this story? Can you make something entertaining out of it, or are you doing it for other reasons?<br><br>Stories should not be sporked because they need &quot;dealing with.&quot; Nor should stories be sporked simply because of how infamous they are. The PPC (as in we the writers, not the fictional organization) should neither be a sort of fanfiction police nor a cadre of badfic big game hunters. I feel like both of those paths have been in vogue recently, and honestly? It&#39;s resulted in what I feel are a large number of mediocre missions. There have been standouts, to be sure, but they feel far and few between.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t claim it. If you think you can make a good mission out of it, by all means do.

            <p>Considering that this was the first fanfiction I ever read and I&#39;ve spent spent many a sleepover reading it with friends and laughing at it, I&#39;ve got a rather odd sort of fondness for the story and do think I&#39;d be able to give it the mission it deserves, especially since I&#39;ve been considering gags for said mission for over a year now. It was just wistful thinking on my part, but now that it looks like the fic&#39;s opening up for sporking, maybe not...<br><br>My only hesitation is that I&#39;ve already tackled two other Legendaries already and don&#39;t know it would be fair to claim a third.

            <p>I think, barring a few cases where I lack sufficient data for an opinion, most people here could if they were giving it all they had.

            <p>While Iximaz and hS stepped in to clarify what I meant (and many thanks to them for doing so), I feel I should say something too. I wasn&#39;t saying people shouldn&#39;t spork &quot;My Immortal&quot; because it&#39;s already funny. For one thing, I also don&#39;t find it funny. I was warning people against sporking it <b>just</b> because it is &quot;legendary&quot; or big. Nor should people write a mission <b>just</b> because a badfic &quot;deserves&quot; to be sporked.

            <p>I stand by my argument, though. I don&#39;t think that because <i>My Immortal</i> is funny bad means we can&#39;t get a good mission out of it. However, I shouldn&#39;t have been patronising towards PC, and for that I apologise.</p>

            <p>... you&#39;re also getting PC and Alleb tangled up in your head (I did the same thing, which is why I noticed). PoorCynic basically said &#39;don&#39;t claim it because you want to spork something big, claim it because you&#39;ve come up with a good way to make it funny/tell a story&#39;. I think that&#39;s really good advice; I followed it with <i>C<em>l</em>br__n</i> (to cap off Dafydd&#39;s tale), but I&#39;m not sure I did with <i>legolas by laura</i>; yes, it <i>was</i> a funny mission (I hope?), but I think - eleven years on - I probably wrote it because it was a big story.<br><br>Alleb then agreed with that (summing it up with the quite pithy &#39;it&#39;s about making goodfic out of bad, not who can kill the biggest bad&#39;), and added the point about it being funny already. Which is also a fairly accurate point, though not fully drawn-out - there have been missions in the past which consist of little more than pointing at the things everyone reading had already noticed. I don&#39;t know whether <i>legolas</i> falls into that, but I wouldn&#39;t be terribly surprised - the stupid-funny is so obvious, it&#39;d be hard not to just point and laugh.<br><br>However, you&#39;re absolutely right that it&#39;s perfectly possible to make a good mission out of even a massive shambles like <i>My Immortal</i>. Of course it is! You can make a mission out of anything (though if the badfic literally consists of a full stop, it&#39;ll be quite a <i>short</i> mission).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But yeah, you&#39;re probably right about that too.

            <p>As far as I know, <i>My Immortal</i> is off-limits because someone&#39;s claimed it. That&#39;s what the wiki page says... but I can&#39;t find anything by some quick searching. Eh.<br><br>Anyway! On to interesting stuff, and Question the Third:<br><br>a) Dreams, dreams, dreams... a claimed dream-warning will be treated with both more reverence and more suspicion. Dreams are the favoured prophetic method of the Valar; Ulmo sent dream-messages to Finrod and Turgon (leading to the founding of Nargothrond and Gondolin), for instance. But... the Valar don&#39;t get involved much these days, and Amy has never been anywhere near the Two Trees (which might help make her easier to communicate with for Lorien or whoever). That said, note that Frodo dreamt of Gandalf in Bombadil&#39;s house - the dream was late, according to Gandalf, but it&#39;s still a dream-vision (and Gandalf never doubted it).<br><br>b) Glorfindel is actually a perfect choice - not only is he a <i>de facto</i> Seer in his own right, he&#39;s also spent time around at least four others: Malbeth (this is an assumption, but I think a solid one), plus Turgon, Idril, and Tuor, all of whom had visions or other messages involving Gondolin. If there&#39;s a pattern in how those messages were presented (and it&#39;s very hard to say, since the only two we have details for are Turgon and Tuor), he&#39;d look for that pattern to be repeated. If not... &#39;feel&#39;, probably.<br><br>c) Uh... not that I know of? ^_^ I&#39;m pretty sure alchemy isn&#39;t mentioned by Tolkien; looking at the stars might be, I honestly don&#39;t know. I <i>do</i> know that early descriptions of Numenor imply it reached an Industrial Revolution stage of technology: <i>Our ships go now without the wind, and many are made of metal that sheareth rocks, and they sink not in calm or storm; but they are no longer fair to look upon. But our shields are impenetrable, our swords cannot be withstood, our darts are like thunder and pass over leagues unerring.</i> But I don&#39;t know anything about prophecy.<br><br>Actually, that&#39;s a lie: the Druedain (aka the Wild Men met by the Rohirrim on the way to Minas Tirith) lived on Numenor, and left centuries before the Downfall, since (they claimed) the island felt unstable. So there&#39;s that.<br><br>hS, rambling.</p>

            <p>Hmm... this gives me some stuff to think about. Thanks!<br><br>Man, I really need to reread Silm. For now, I&#39;ll look over all of the other prophecies and see if I can spot any links or patterns.

            <p>I think it&#39;s in <i>The Lost Road</i>, which would&#39;ve been the story of Elendil and Isildur&#39;s final days in Numenor if - the eternal refrain! - he&#39;d actually finished it. So far as I know, the Silm never implies they had anything more than Third Age Gondor does.<br><br>Regarding prophecy, there&#39;s an article <a href="http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2012/11/26/the-middle-earth-prophecies/">here</a>, which I haven&#39;t (yet!) read, but which looks promising. It notes that <i>True prophecy occurs in a few places, but it is overshadowed by foresight. If we can distinguish between, we must conclude that foresight only intuitively acknowledges that something may or will happen.</i> I think it&#39;s a bit dubious that he puts Malbeth down as foresight - dude wrote a <i>poem</i>, that&#39;s not an intuitive feel - but maybe the full article explains it better.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The wiki says that &quot;My Immortal&quot; is claimed and a mission was forthcoming, but there&#39;s no trace of that in the Claimed Badfic page. A look in the history reveals that it was claimed back in <i>2008</i>, so I would hazard a guess and say that the claimant either gave up or is long-gone. I see no reason why we cannot mission it.</p>

            <p>Yep. Just want to ask about that.<br><br>I mean, when characters were reasonably In Character or just slightly OOC at a point in the fanfic......<br><br>Suddenly the author made them say something that boost the OOC level from &quot;Not that close to canon but okay&quot; to &quot;What the [DATA EXPUNGED] did he/she/it just say?! I NEED BLEEPRINS!&quot;<br><br><br>I just got badly squicked by one quote from a badfic:<br><br>&quot;How do you humans say it? Ah. Yes. I want to feel your body squirm around my tight hot c**k.&quot;<br><br>It might be okay if said character is like that in canon AND a human being. But not an SCP.<br><br>Yes, I get this quote from an SCP yaoi slashfic about a certain Plague Doctor doing unspeakable things to a D-class. That quote along make me loss all faith in humanity.<br><br>I wonder if you guys had encountered more squicky OOC quotes before. Please tell me, I am going to scrub my brain with bleach or something in the mean time.      </p>

            <p>From <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5233819/1/Betrayal">Betrayal</a>, a horrible Harmony badfic that bashes Ron to the Veil, where Harry and Hermione only loved Ron and Ginny, respectively, because Ron gave them a horrible, horrible brand of love potion, come this indirect quote delivered by Shacklebolt after he conducted an interrogation about the crime: <br><br>&quot; Ron said he got Ginny involved so he could if anyone ever found out about it... He said that she was always a brat when she was little and always got her way because she was the youngest and the only girl in the family so he figured everyone would believe it was her idea because she was never one to take no for an answer. He also said that while he never intended to get caught, if happened, he would take peversed pleasure in seeing her get her heart broken when Harry tells her he hates her before before she&#39;s locked up for the rest of her life. As far he was concerned, she was nothing but a &#39;boy who lived&#39; groupie who followed Harry around and was willing to do whatever he asked of her. She wasn&#39;t even good enough to get him to notice her because she had no idea how little Harry thought of her. She was pathetic and he hated her for it. &quot; <br><br>Then when he is confronted about it: <br><br>&quot; I should have let the troll kill you both in our first year &quot;, he said coldly &quot; You&#39;ve been way more trouble than you&#39;re worth &quot; <br><br>...&quot; Because of you I was in danger and nearly died several times. Oh you saved me but I wonder if was out of friendship or for another heroic chapter in the story of the &#39;boy who lived&#39;. I suspect it was the latter because despite denying you wanted fame and attention, you always managed to get more than your share  and never gave your best friend any of it! And as of you,&quot; He said turning to Hermione. &quot; You were nothing but a pushy know-it-all. You were truly insufferable. Always nagging us about the rules or doing our homework. I had a mother Hermione and the best part of going to Hogwarts was getting from her nagging but you made up for absence and then some. You know I never really wanted to be your friend, don&#39;t you? None of us did but you nagged us into it like you did with our homework. Helping us with it was about about all you were good for, you know? You certain weren&#39;t pretty enough for for anyone to want anything else from you &quot; ...  <br><br>... &quot; It wasn&#39;t because I loved you, &quot; He replied in same cold tone he&#39;d been using &quot; It was so our beloved hero over here- &quot; He said pointing to Harry &quot; Could see what it was like to be me. All these years, he&#39;s had everything handed to him; fame, money and popularity while I had nothing. For once I wanted to have something  and let him feel what it&#39;s like to go without!&quot; <br><br>And of course, then we have Filicidal!Serena from my first and only mission. While she was never really IC from the very paragraph, I really became excruciatingly painful once I got these lines: (Warning: This section is absolutely NSFW and NSFB)   <br><br> &quot;Me? Oh, I&#39;m just getting revenge.&quot; There was an unnatural gleam in Serena&#39;s eyes. &quot;Revenge on all those times you bothered me. Revenge for all the times you got between me and Darien. Revenge for all those times you tried to steal my beloved away!&quot; With that last remark she slapped Rini, leaving a red hand mark across the young girls right cheek.&quot; <br><br>... &quot; Serena took hold of one of Rini&#39;s flailing hands and laid it flat against the table, the palm facing upwards. She placed the teeth of the saw against the base of the pinky. She smirked before growling &quot;This is for daring to touch my Darien-chan.&quot; ... <br><br>... &quot; &quot;Only one more thing.&quot; Serena murmured. &quot;Now there is only the task of taking out the heart that dared to think it could love my soul mate, my one true love, my Darien! &quot;  <br><br>Now excuse while I got drowned myself in a huge bowl of Hot Bleepolate. <br>       <br><br></p>

            <p>So who else has any fictional currency?<br><br>I have a bag of <a href="http://www.discworldemporium.com/DiscworldCoins">Ankh-Morpork half-dollars</a> (I believe my bag is blue, not white, and might have more than five?); I also have the short-lived Ankh-Morpork cheque book - the Internet seems to suggest it was given away by Borders or Waterstones with <i>Making Money</i>. I&#39;ve got a fair number of the <a href="http://www.discworldemporium.com/discworld-stamps">Discworld stamps</a>, too, which are used as currency by some people in Morpork.<br><br>Somewhere, I have the <a href="http://www.theforce.net/swtc/Pix/given/rb/swcoins.jpg">three <i>Star Wars</i> 1000 credit coins</a> (Alderaan, Bespin, and Ord Mantell for some reason) that came with the Star Wars Monopoly computer game on CD. And right now I&#39;m dangerously close to donating $60 through Kickstarter for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1717678842/licensed-coins-from-the-lord-of-the-rings-tm-and-t/description">a set of Middle-earth coins,</a> including at that level a bag of 8 Shire pennies. Because sweet Aule, those things are pretty.<br><br>And the Shire Post, who&#39;re doing those, mint a lot of other fictional currency. I love the look of the <a href="http://www.shirepost.com/wp/#!/The-Kingkiller-Chronicle%C2%99/c/11090117/offset=0&amp;sort=normal">Kingkiller Chronicle</a> ones especially, but they do a lot of stuff (including the <i>Wheel of Time</i> books, which I know were popular around here once). And... well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other fictional coinage out there. I would be frankly shocked if there weren&#39;t any Harry Potter stuff available.<br><br>So what else is out there?

            <p>While poking through my stuff in search of the <i>Star Wars</i> coins (which I didn&#39;t find), I ran across these: <a href="http://darylscollections.info/stamps_coins/jurassic_park_coin_set.jpg">Jurassic Park: The Lost World coins</a>. I have the <i>Stegosaurus</i>, <i>Pteranodon</i>, and two <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> (all loose; their display packets are long gone). These were given away (?) with Tetley tea back in 1997.<br><br>I also have something that sort of qualifies: a set featuring a farthing, ha&#39;penny, penny, and thuppenny bit. Fair enough, you say - but these were minted in around 1990 for <a href="http://www.llechwedd-slate-caverns.co.uk/">Llechwedd</a>, which at the time (and maybe still) had a historic Victorian village street where you could exchange your modern money for Victorian coins and buy things with them. I&#39;ve no idea what my set came to (it was just &#39;bought&#39; at the exchange ~2000, and got me very strange looks from the cashier), but it was a fair amount. Worth it, though.<br><br>I also have a replica Roman coin of some description from Dover, but that one&#39;s less interesting.<br><br>Oh, and yes: I went for the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1717678842/licensed-coins-from-the-lord-of-the-rings-tm-and-t">Shire Post Middle-earth coins Kickstarter</a>.

            <p>Well, we probably never see anyone eating on Gallifrey because in <i>The Invasion of Time</i>, Rodan explained to Leela that they used freeze-dried pills instead of food. (Maybe that&#39;s why Rassilon is so cranky all the time...?) The EU probably has more information on other shops and things, so it&#39;s a shame its canon is questionable at best. *cough<i>Lungbarrow</i>cough*<br><br>I just think it&#39;s a shame we don&#39;t have more information on the day to day lives of Time Lords; we know a lot about the politicians, but not the normal people. And that makes me sad. :(<br><br>As for <i>The Long Game</i>, we know that the humans there use credit sticks as some sort of system, and that the door-in-the-brain surgery cost 10k credits. *shrugs* <br><br>And let&#39;s not forget in <i>Rings of Akhaten</i>, where the currency was &#39;something of personal significance&#39;, like Clara&#39;s mother&#39;s ring or that leaf.</p>

            <p>Can we guesstimate that to be roughly equivalent to a generic brain surgery, which apparently costs <a href="http://health.costhelper.com/brain-surgery.html">around $50,000</a> in America these days?

            <p>So... how easy is it to convert between these currencies?<br><br>The most difficult one will probably be LotR: the only value information we know is that Bill the pony was bought for 12 silver pennies, which was at least three times his value. Uh, good luck converting <i>that</i>! But actually, I bet there&#39;s a modern fantasy series (<i>Kingkiller Chronicles</i> or <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> seem like possibilities) which gives the price of a horse. If someone can find that... Scapegrace, as our resident pseudomedievalist, any ideas on the comparative prices of horses and scratty ponies?<br><br>On the flip side, the Ankh-Morpork dollar is easy: we know from the price of stamps that it&#39;s roughly on a par with English currency in the Victorian era (backed up by the fact that new Watchmen make ~ AM$1 per day, which equates to about eight shillings... sounds pretty reasonable.) And I bet there&#39;s a price for a pint somewhere in the <i>Discworld</i> canon (and if not, we can figure out what it was in Victorian England!)... alcohol sounds like a good benchmark for buying power. Does <i>Harry Potter</i> mention the cost of a butterbeer? Can we calculate from there?<br><br>And what else is there? It might be hard to make the leap into sci-fi - how many comparable prices are there going to be between Middle-earth and Coruscant - but again, alcohol might be the key...<br><br>If you&#39;re imagining I want to end up with a table of comparisons that lets us describe the exact handful of assorted coins needed to buy something in the PPC General Store... you&#39;d be right. ;) It&#39;s frivolous fun.<br><br>So who&#39;s up for it?<br><br>hS</p>

This should be fun.<br><br><b>Latinum, Trekverse</b><br><br>Gold-pressed latinum comes in denominations of slips, strips, bars, and bricks; there are 100 slips to a strip and 20 strips to a bar; the conversion from bars to bricks is unknown. Here&#39;s what we know that might be useful for establishing exchange rates:<br><br>Quark charged 10 slips for a crate of root beer. Knowing Quark, this is probably more than it&#39;s actually worth.<br><br>5 strips gets you a Starfleet cadet&#39;s uniform, while 20-25 gets you a fine tailor-made dress from Garak&#39;s shop on DS9. (Meanwhile, a Pernese Weavercraft mark gets you a plain shirt or a child&#39;s frock, and a Tannercraft mark gets you a plain leather belt with bronze buckle or a pair of moccasins.)<br><br>During the Cardassian occupation of DS9, Quark paid his employees 1 slip per day. Later, their wages were 14 strips in a pay cycle. We don&#39;t know what this cycle is, but I&#39;d guess two weeks, giving one strip per day.<br><br>Quark bought the wreckage of a ship for three bars. By comparison, he reckoned he could get five Nausicaan bodyguards, a fast ship, and few questions asked for five.<br><br><b>Credits, <i>Star Wars</i></b><br><br>There isn&#39;t a whole lot of useful stuff listed in this book, but there are a couple things:<br><br>A regular melee knife goes for 25 credits.<br><br>A medpac costs 100 credits. (We can probably compare this to the cost of similar items in <i>Fallout</i>, etc.)<br><br>The cheapest blaster (&quot;Hold-out blaster: Q2&quot;) costs 275 credits.<br><br>A Corellian Corvette (which seems to compare to Quark&#39;s fast ship plus bodyguards) goes for 3.5 million credits new or 1.5 million used.<br><br><b>Gold, D&amp;D 3.5</b><br><br>Returning to fantasyland, we&#39;ve got good old copper, silver, and gold. It&#39;s 10 copper to a silver, 10 silver to a gold, and 10 gold to a platinum piece, should we need to go that high. Easy-peasy.<br><br>Right off the bat, there&#39;s a nice chart of trade goods that gives us the following useful data:<br><br>one pound of flour or one chicken - 2 cp<br>one sheep - 2 gp<br>one cow - 10 gp<br><br>In the equipment and goods category:<br><br>a dagger - 2 gp<br><br>a mug of ale - 4 cp<br>a gallon of ale or a pitcher (2.7 liters) of common wine - 2 sp<br>a bottle of fine wine - 10 gp (good lord, that seems steep... maybe they meant 10 sp? Or maybe it&#39;s because a glass winebottle goes for 2 gp all by itself?)<br><br>meals/day in a good inn - 5 sp<br>in a common inn - 3 sp<br>in a poor inn - 1 sp<br>a half-pound (8 oz.) chunk of meat - 3 sp<br><br>a donkey or mule - 8 gp<br>a pony - 30 gp<br>a light horse - 75 gp<br><br>a peasant&#39;s outfit - 1 sp<br>a traveler or artisan&#39;s outfit - 1 gp<br>a monk, scholar, or cleric&#39;s outfit - 5 gp<br>an explorer&#39;s outfit - 10 gp<br>a courtier&#39;s outfit - 30 gp<br><br>Wages are a little tricky to figure out, but we&#39;re told that untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 sp per day. PCs with ranks in the Profession skill get (1d20+[# of ranks])/2 gp per week. I guess the average for a first-level character would be (10+4)/2 = 7 gp per week. That&#39;s 70 silver per day.<br><br>Methinks this system is a bit wonky.<br><br><b>Gold, <i>Dragonlance</i></b><br><br>This is easy: the sourcebook flat-out tells us that a D&amp;D gold piece is equal to 1 Krynn steel piece.<br><br>Lesser denominations are copper (100 to a steel), gold (40 to a steel), silver (20 to a steel), and iron/bronze (2 to a steel).<br><br><b>Dollars, <i>Discworld</i></b><br><br>This book uses the GURPS system, so these are not Ankh-Morpork dollars, but (I guess) GURPS dollars.<br><br>The monthly income for a watchman is given as $700 ($600 plus $100 living-out allowance for those who don&#39;t sleep in their watch-house). This is listed in a table with other Average Jobs (as opposed to Poor, Struggling, Comfortable, or Wealthy Jobs).<br><br>From tables of weapons and equipment:<br><br>small knife - $30<br>large knife - $40<br><br>donkey or small mule - $1,000<br>pony - $1,500<br>saddle horse - $1,200 (less than a pony? okay...)<br>racehorse or light warhorse - $4,000 (more if the racehorse is really really fast)<br><br>A meal and a drink at various inns/bars:<br><br>Classy - $5+ - $0.50+<br>Comfortable - $3 - $0.10<br>Ordinary - $1 - $0.05<br>Seedy - $0.25 - $0.02<br><br>They class the Drum as a Seedy or perhaps even Ordinary pub, though they note that &quot;ordinary&quot; doesn&#39;t quite seem the right word.<br><br>I&#39;ll let those of you with better heads for numbers figure out all the conversions.

            <p>How could I have forgotten gold-pressed latinum? Endless house of playing <i>Star Trek: Armada</i> and hearing &#39;Insufficient -- Latinum&#39; have all come rushing back. :D<br><br>I think the best comparison might be either the root beer or the pay. We can&#39;t use the clothes, unfortunately, because making clothes on Pern is <i>way</i> harder than in space. So... how big is a crate? 12 bottles? 24? We&#39;re charging a couple of Sickles for butterbeer, so it looks like approximately 1/2 to 1/4 slips to the Sickle. That would make a slip around, ehm, £0.60 - £1.20.<br><br>How does that stack up with the pay scale? 1 strip per day (I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s the non-Cardassian, Federation-approved pay?) makes the strip precisely equal in value to the AM$ (assuming Sam Vimes gives fair pay, which... well, it&#39;s <i>Sam Vimes</i>). At 100 strips to the slip, a slip is thus worth £0.40. Oh, hey, look, a near match. Neither number jiggles well (the pay number will tend to wander down, while the drink one can only really go up), so let&#39;s just split the difference and say £0.50.<br><br>(So how about that ship? Five bars is equivalent to, I&#39;d say the used Corvette - <i>Star Wars</i> ships are larger, after all. A credit is worth £0.65 on the booze standard, so the Corvette costs... £975,000. That&#39;s less than some <i>cars</i>, suggesting that either spaceships are dead easy to make, or it&#39;s marked down for RP purposes.<br><br>But okay, five bars makes a touch under a million pounds. Five bars is only 10,000 slips - that would make a slip worth £100! Yeah, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s viable.)<br><br>Now, onto D&amp;D. Let&#39;s compare it to Pernese marks, because we have a lot of the same information.<br><br>Fowl: 2 cp = 1/4 mark.<br>Cow/bovine: 10 gp = 8 mark.<br>Peasant clothes: 1 sp = 1 mark.<br>And by drinkonomics: 4 cp = 1/8 mark.<br><br>Those give us conversion rates of 8cp/mark, 120 cp/mark, 10 cp/mark, and 32 cp/mark, respectively. Okay, real-world sanity check time! Those values will get you a pint down at the pub for: £7.50 (yikes!), £1.00 (yum!), £12 (yerk!) or £3.75. I&#39;m pretty confident of the Pernese 1/8 mark drink, because that&#39;s about the cost of two loaves of bread, which sounds right. So, yeah, I&#39;m going to say 30 cp/mark, which makes a cp worth a nice £1. That gives £4 for a drink, £100 for a decent set of clothes, £800 for a donkey (okay, that&#39;s a bit steep), £1000 for an expensive wine (that&#39;s <i>just</i> about doable), and £200 for a quality weapon. All of those ballpark as okay for me, so I&#39;m happy with that. (They also turn out to be exactly equal to the GURPS dollar; go figure.)<br><br>And of course, <i>Dragonlance</i> is lovely and simple. ^<em>^<br><br>Now to use D&amp;D to check on Bill&#39;s price... a decent pony would be 3000 cp, but poor Bill is half-dead. Call him 10 gp (which means his master&#39;s &#39;overcharge&#39; was essentially claiming he was the best pony in the world), or £1000. That makes our silver penny worth... hrm, £250, some five times the value deduced from Pern (£65). Which one makes more sense?<br><br>Luckily, we can deduce that. ^</em>^ There are two known coin names in Middle earth, the castar and the tharni - and &#39;tharni&#39; translates as &#39;farthing&#39; or &#39;quarter&#39;. That means it&#39;s reasonable to think there&#39;s a 1/4 penny coin. Furthermore, silver clearly isn&#39;t the base unit of currency - otherwise Butterbur&#39;s paying out of 30 silver would be small change. Copper is a common lower-denomination metal.<br><br>In this sort of setting, coins are valued based on their metal content. I looked it up, and did you know that copper is worth about 1/12th the value of silver? Given that a shilling is twelve pence, the two coins being roughly the same size and made of silver and copper respectively... yeah, that surprised me. ^<em>^ But it means there&#39;s probably a copper penny in Middle-earth, and a copper farthing too.<br><br>That farthing is worth (1/12 /4 =) 1/50th of the value of the silver penny, and is probably one of the lowest denomination coins. Is it more likely to be worth ~ £1 or £5 in modern money? Yeah, I&#39;m going to stick with the lower value.<br><br>~<br><br>Phew, that was lots of words. Here, have a picture to make up for it!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/RudisSpecials.png"><br><br>I&#39;ve had to invent descriptions/symbols for some currencies. The Middle-earth currencies use the first letters of <i>castar</i> and <i>tharni</i>, with copper unmodified, and silver pre-or-post-fixed with a c for silver (<i>celeb</i> in Sindarin, <i>kibil</i> in Khuzdul). Orens get the letter &#39;O&#39; in the Glagolitic alphabet, <i>Dragon Age</i> currency gets its nicknames (copper bits, silver crowns), <i>Game of Thrones</i> gets initials, and <i>Elder Scrolls</i> gets &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Septim">http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Septim</a></em>(Coin)&quot;&gt;the dragon from the back of the coin</a>.<br><br>And since I haven&#39;t linked it for a while: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mzkG-ImZWhzOdFJLYEmga_zNjOMu-qdu0yMLNZ2phik/edit?usp=sharing">The Booze Standard</a> spreadsheet.<br><br>hS<br><br>(The highest-value coin listed on there is the Westeros Gold Dragon, worth over £7000. The next ones down are the D&amp;D platinum piece and the bar of gold-pressed latinum, at a mere £1000 each. Though, come to think of it, the 100-mark piece sneaks in at £3000...)</p>

            <p>The 3 copper stars for a piece bread value is from the end of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, the first book in the series. But since then, the War of Five Kings happened and the value of Westerosi currency plunged <i>hard</i>. After that, six copper stars only bough you a single melon and a Gold Dragon only bought either a side of beef or six skinny piglets. So it&#39;s very likely that it isn&#39;t worth over £7000 anymore. </p>

            <p>That&#39;s the trouble with using purchasing power - it varies a lot. The Galactic Standard Credit was apparently long-term stable... but only until the rise of Palpatine, at which time inflation kicked in. The Pernese mark varies randomly over time and between locations... it&#39;s kind of a mess.<br><br>Also, uh-oh moment: is it 3 copper <i>stars</i>, or 3 copper <i>pennies</i>? The GoT wiki just says &#39;Coppers&#39;, and doesn&#39;t mention stars; the Wiki of Ice and Fire (has an amazing name and) says the star is eight pennies, but doesn&#39;t mention prices - except the melon thing, which it again just says &#39;coppers&#39;. Helpful, guys!<br><br>Anyway, if they&#39;re confirmed to be stars, please let me know so I can chop the Dragon down to under a thousand (and laugh maniacally).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But I should probably mention that the Iron Throne is currently in debt of at least nearly 4 <i>million</i> Gold Dragons, so it probably can&#39;t be worth as much as over 7000 pounds anyway.</p>

            <p>But a Gold Dragon is worth 210 silver stags, which are worth 56 copper pennies each. That means that each Dragon is worth over 10,000 pennies. Unless the value of a penny is really, really low - which it isn&#39;t, unless bread is super-duper cheap - a Dragon has a very high value.<br><br>My guess is that the &#39;210&#39; figure came in at a different time to the various values, so he never realised how expensive they&#39;d have to be.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The internet <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Little_Whinging">thinks</a> that Little Whinging might be in the vicinity of Staines, about 25 miles (by road) from King&#39;s Cross. You can&#39;t really list a &#39;price per mile&#39; for buses, but if you could, that would be about 2 1/4 Sickles/mile.<br><br>The Gray Sisters think the far end of Long Island is out of their service area, so let&#39;s assume they usually serve only New York City itself.

The value varies somewhat between crafthalls, and as per supply and demand, naturally, but here&#39;s a nice little selection, starting with our booze standard.<br><br>1 Winecraft mark - 1 keg of ale or 2 bottles of &quot;undistinguished&quot; wine (I suppose this means average quality, not great, not awful)<br><br>1 Bakercraft mark - 1 full sack of fine-milled pastry flour, or 16 small (1-pound) loaves of bread, or half a sack of sweetener, or 192 bubbly pies<br><br>1 Smithcraft mark - 1 small knife<br><br>1 Minecraft mark - 2 sacks of coal, or 1 whetstone, or 1 agate or quartz graduated-bead necklace (I have no idea why a whetstone is so valuable... are they hard to get or something? Coal seems cheap, too, but I suppose it&#39;s that necessary.)<br><br>1 Beastcraft mark - 1 young ovine or 4 fowl (the accompanying article also notes that runnerbeasts go for 9 marks and up)<br><br>1 Keroon Hold mark - 1/8th of a bovine herdbeast<br><br>1 Harpercraft mark - An apprentice-made pipe (the article notes that musical instruments, presumably of journeyman quality or higher, go for 2 marks and up)<br><br>Marks come in denominations of 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 5, 10, and a few 100-pieces.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Currency">Apparently</a> a loaf of bread costs 3 copper pennies, whereas on Pern it would cost 1/16 marks (bakercraft, but I&#39;m forced to assume rough equivalence). That translates as £1.80 for a loaf, which is a bit high, but sure; it means we&#39;re looking at about £0.60 to the copper penny.<br><br>Which, at 56 pennies to the silver stag and 210 stags to the gold dragon, means the base unit of <i>Game of Thrones</i> currency is worth £7350.<br><br>Speaking of which: I know <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> is quarantined.

            <p>I know for sure that a Gather baker wanted 1/32 mark for six pies in <i>Dragonsinger</i> (and then Piemur haggled him down to 1/32 for nine, since he had Menolly and Camo with him). My only guess is that he was charging low because it was a Gather and he expected to do more business that way, but knowing how expensive things get at fairs in the Real World, that doesn&#39;t really track for me.<br><br>I don&#39;t know where the information about flour and sugar comes from. Probably Word of God, but that doesn&#39;t make it make any more sense.<br><br>Incidentally, my instinct says that 9 marks probably gets you a decent runner, good for light riding around your fields or whatever, but with no particular pedigree. Price goes up if the animal comes from a prime bloodline, if it&#39;s prime breeding stock, if it&#39;s won races, if it&#39;s a giant draft animal, etc. The price probably goes down if it&#39;s in poor health and/or has serious conformation flaws.<br><br>By way of comparison, you can apparently get a whole cow for eating for 8 marks. That would have to pay not just for the meat, but for the herder&#39;s time and effort spent raising the thing to a proper weight, probably 1-2 Turns. I figure a bull for breeding or a cow for milking would be more, since you&#39;d get many more Turns of use out of it and potentially a profit on the calves/milk.<br><br>Oh, and the fowl are probably chickens or geese. Ducks are rare and turkeys didn&#39;t make it, and they&#39;ve got wherry as a turkey substitute anyway.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Ahem. Sorry about that, nothing to see here.<br><br>... no, that&#39;s a lie. SQUEE!<br><br>The alcohol is (as you guessed) the best way to bring Pern onto the Booze Standard: it&#39;s half a Winecraft mark for a bottle of okay wine. Per <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=286768;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board%22">PoorCynic</a>, wine is... very variable! We could make the half-mark equivalent to 10 bottle caps - about five times the price of a bottle of beer. That would mean we&#39;re talking about a £15 bottle of wine, which feels about right for &#39;undistinguished&#39;, and would give us a conversion rate of 1 Wine-mark = £30.<br><br>That&#39;s on a par with the AM$, and lets us draw another comparison: fowl. One fowl (do I remember them being turkeys?) is 1/4 Beastcraft marks on Pern; on the Disc, a chicken varies from $1 (in the city) to 10p (in the countryside). So what does our £30 mark give? It means we&#39;re spending £7.50 on a single fowl, while on the Disc they range from £4 to £40. That, I think, makes sense.<br><br>And one last comparison: CMOT Dibbler sells his pies, according to the Compleat Ankh-Morpork, for (from random memory) 20p, or a bit more than a curry. That comes out as about £8 - a bit steep, but no doubt he&#39;ll cut his own throat and make it cheaper.<br><br>In contrast, a hot bubbly pie will set you back 1/192 Bakercraft marks - all of 15 pence.<br><br>... I know which I&#39;d rather have.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><b>BUBBLY PIES</b><br><br>Every Hold has its own special method for making bubbly pies. The traditional fruit used in this special dessert is Terran blueberries, though any berry can be substituted. This recipe makes half a dozen dessert-sized tarts or a dozen hand-sized Gather-pies.<br><br><b>Crust:</b><br><br>1/2 cup butter or margarine<br>2 Tbsp granulated sweetener (sugar)<br>2&amp;half; cups flour<br>1/2 tsp salt<br>1/2 cup ice water<br><br>Cut the butter into chunks. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl. Work the butter gently into the dry mixture with a fork until pieces the size of peas form. Sprinkle the water over and work it in. (Do not overwork the dough.) Form the dough into a ball.<br><br><b>Filling:</b><br><br>5 cups blueberries (or 20 oz frozen)<br>1 cup granulated sweetener<br>1/4 tsp klah bark (cinnamon)<br>2 tsp citrus juice (I&#39;m guessing lemon; it doesn&#39;t say)<br>1-2 Tbsp butter or margarine<br><br>Gently toss berries with sweetening and klah bark in a large bowl. Sprinkle citrus juice over mixture. Spoon berries into crust and dot with butter.<br><br><b>For Six Tarts:</b><br><br>1 crust recipe<br>1 filling recipe<br><br>Divide the ball into two pieces. Work with one at a time. Form each into a ball and press out into a circle. Divide each circle into six. Roll each piece into a ball. Flatten to 1/8-inch, cut into 5-inch circles, and fit six into tart pans. Fill with berry mixture. Moisten the edge of each tart and top with second circle of dough. Seal and flute the edges. Cut slits in the top of each tart with a knife. Cover edge of each tart with foil.<br><br>Bake at 375° for ten minutes. Remove foil. Bake for 8-12 minutes more, or until crust is golden. Serve hot.<br><br><b>For Twelve Gather-Pies:</b><br><br>1 crust recipe<br>1/2 filling recipe<br>1 beaten egg<br><br>Roll out dough on a floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut out 24 circles. Lay out 12 on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Divide filling among circles, spooning approximately 2-3 Tbsp into the center of each, leaving a 1/4-inch border.<br><br>Brush the border with egg. Lay the second circle on top of each pie, and press edges together with a fork all the way around. (Stretch the top crust gently to if necessary.) If desired, mix together 1/4 cup water with 1&amp;half; Tbsp sweetening; brush top of each pie with mixture for a sugary glaze. With a knife, cut three or four short slits in the top of each pie.<br><br>Bake at 400° for 20-25 minutes, until crust is golden. Slide gently off cookie sheet with spatula. Serve hot.<br><br>---<br><br>Have fun!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>&#39;Cause dark cocoa powder is extremely bitter in a suck-all-the-moisture-out-of-your-mouth kind of way, and that&#39;s the bulk of the official recipe. The narrative makes fun of F&#39;lar&#39;s sweet tooth, but three generous spoons of sugar is about what it takes to make it palatable, IMO. Since you&#39;re a fellow non-coffee-drinker, I&#39;m guessing your palate is probably similar to mine. {= )<br><br>The hard part of making marks would be coming up with the tools to cut out circles and imprint them with numbers and your Hall or Hold emblem(s) of choice, unless you wanted to spend a lot of time hand-crafting them individually.

Geek culture is practically mainstream these days, so there&#39;s enough of a market to support people who happen to be blacksmiths or have access to a wood shop to expand their business into fandom, but maybe that wasn&#39;t the case back in the day, even in a big fandom like Pern. And now the Pern fandom, while still large, isn&#39;t exactly in its prime anymore. Maybe we missed a crucial intersection of some sort. {= /<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Those look really tasty. Like, <i>really</i> tasty. Is that going to be plain flour? I bet I could make those this weekend...<br><br>About the <i>Dragonlover&#39;s Guide</i> - how good is it, really? I can see from Amazon that it&#39;s not a terribly pretty book (seriously, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Dragon-Lovers-Guide-Pern/dp/0345412745">that dragon is terrifying</a>), but how&#39;s the inside? It looks like the most recent edition was &#39;97, which means it doesn&#39;t include telekinesis (oh no teh horrar) or any of Todd&#39;s Third Pass stuff (that probably is a shame), but does cover everything else.<br><br>The reason I&#39;m asking is that my mother is a) a huge Pern fan and b) impossible to buy Christmas presents for.

            <p>It was indispensable to me back when I was running Pern RPs on Neopets, and it&#39;s good to have around even now. It&#39;s not 100% perfect—the feet vs. meters controversy springs to mind; for some reason a floor plan of what I know to be the main Harper Hall is located across the page from a paragraph about a secondary one on Ista; and there&#39;s a truly horrifying illustration of Menolly on page 164—but for the most part, it&#39;s quite informative and easy on the eyes. MOST of the illustrations are nice, and the maps and things, too. Plus the occasional recipe to try. {= )<br><br>You&#39;re correct that it&#39;s only current as far as, I think, <i>Dolphins of Pern</i>. It is a shame there&#39;s not much about watch-whers, but I&#39;ve happily done without any reference to dragon telekinesis and weird <i>Redwall</i>-esque time shenanigans. {= P<br><br>So, yeah, I&#39;d say go for it. Especially if you can find a nice used one for three pounds!<br><br>And yeah, definitely use plain old all-purpose flour for the pie crust. You want the agglutination the higher protein content gives you (just not too much of it, hence the note about not overworking the dough). The only reason to use cake flour is for, well, cakes.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who watches a lot of cooking shows.</p>

I&#39;ve just run into an article about Galactic Standard Credits (<i>Star Wars</i>), <a href="http://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?t=442915">which concludes</a> that 1 credit is worth about £0.40 - by discussing the price of burgers. ^_^ That pricing makes Luke Skywalker&#39;s old, battered landspeeder worth about £800, which is about what you&#39;d pay for a car parked on the side of the road with a &#39;For Sale&#39; sign in the window. (Though we have to allow for planetary differences... the burgers are from the heart of Coruscant, while the landspeeder&#39;s on Tatooine. But it&#39;s approximately right).<br><br>So, the Galactic Standard Credit has roughly the buying power of... a Sickle and a half from <i>Harry Potter</i>. I guess that explains why they make 1000+ credit coins...<br><br>hS</p>

Doesn&#39;t really measure purchasing power, though.<br>-1 <i>Star Wars</i> Galactic credit = £0.65, based on calculations from the burger menu again. ^_^<br>-1 <i>Fallout</i> bottle cap = £0.87. That&#39;s based on the value of gold, which makes it <b>not</b> a measure of purchasing power.<br>-1 <i>Sims</i> Simoleon = £0.32, based on wages, so not purchasing power.<br>-1 <i>Skyrim</i> Septim = £1.47, based on &#39;an ounce of gold will buy you a fine suit&#39;. Er, I guess?<br>-1 <i>Harry Potter</i> Galleon = £5, per Word of God. That&#39;s purchasing power.<br>-1 <i>Game of Thrones</i> Gold Dragon = £10800 (!!!), based on the price of wine. Purchasing power, but may well be an understatement (!!!!!) since I think they&#39;ve assumed fine wine is as readily available in Westeros as it is in 21st century America. (Also, sweet mercy, that&#39;s closing on £100,000 for a barrel of wine! Maybe I&#39;m wrong about the timeframe they used?)<br>-1 <i>Discworld</i> Ankh-Morpork dollar = £18, about half our previous estimate. They&#39;re basing that on the price of a stamp, but since the AM$ has smaller coins available than the UK£ back in 1840, I think I prefer the higher value.<br>-1 <i>Red Dwarf</i> dollarpound = £1.28, based on... keeping the prices the same. Kinda works.<br>-1 <i>Judge Dredd</i> cred = £0.50, based on the price of an undefined ice cream that they decided to define arbitrarily. Hmm.<br><br>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of new information there - the <i>Game of Thrones</i> stuff, maybe (and we can use that as an in to the fine wines market) - but there it is.<br><br>hS</p>

And, actually, I&#39;m amazed that the two values match up - you got 1 septim = £1.55, they said £1.47. Your bottle caps are twice the value of theirs, which suggests that gold is worth more in <i>Fallout</i> than they estimated - probably because a lot of it is radioactive these days!<br><br>So based on all this information - and you all knew it was coming - I&#39;m working up <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mzkG-ImZWhzOdFJLYEmga_zNjOMu-qdu0yMLNZ2phik/edit?usp=sharing">a spreadsheet</a>. ^_^ Have I left off anything that&#39;s been discussed in detail?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;d feel remiss not adding it. <i>Fallout</i>&#39;s famous Nuka-Cola (yes, I&#39;ve been playing <i>Fallout 4</i> a lot; does it show?) goes for 20 caps per bottle. I assume the price is so high compared to beer because it&#39;s a pre-war luxury. Brewing beer at home is likely much easier than creating a soft drink. Sunset Sarsaparilla from <i>Fallout: New Vegas</i> goes for a much more reasonable three caps; this difference may be due to both comparative scarcity and the fact that Sunset Sarsaparilla can be made with basic ingredients.</p>

            <p>Didn&#39;t you say beer was 2 caps? I think that makes <i>Fallout</i> the only place where soft drinks are confirmed more expensive than hard ones.<br><br>Which is probably because fermentation kills the germs, while adding sugar or whatnot doesn&#39;t (I think). You need clean water to make Sunset Sarsaparilla (even though you don&#39;t in-game), while you can get away with moderately-clean water for beer. Drives the price up.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s wrong, MatPat came to some pretty good conclusions. But as a lore nut, I was somewhat irked at the little details. Like, the timeline split. We don&#39;t need to go off songs played on the radio or whatever. That&#39;s culture, that doesn&#39;t tell us anything. The exact same songs could have been made by one eyed one horned flying purple people eaters. We know the exact date of the timeline split from our universe to Fallout&#39;s: December 23, 1947. The day the transistor was invented. Well, more appropriately, demonstrated to the public, but the point still stands. The transistor was made far, far later in Fallout&#39;s timeline then our own, instead, focusing on atomic power and how to harness the atom in other ways. That is where the split is, not when some dude decided not to write a song.<br><br>Other then that, it was a fair analysis. Reasonable, and lightly informative. Just messed up on some lore fronts, is all. </p>

            <p>...while on vacations, or when we eat out.

            <p>I&#39;ve been mulling this over for far longer than I&#39;d care to admit. A good source for prices would probably be tabletop RPG sourcebooks, as everything is standardized and listed for the convenience of players and GMs alike. Some video games could be good for this as well, particularly RPGs again. I believe there is a <i>LotR</i> tabletop game. That could definitely help in some regards.<br><br>The major issue that I can see with using pints as a universal standard is related to measurements. By that, I mostly mean the difference between Imperial pints and U.S. liquid pints. According to Wikipedia, there are about 1.2009499255 U.S. liquid pints to every Imperial pint. Not even converting to fluid ounces helps due to, again, differences in measurements between the U.S. and U.K. And don&#39;t even get me started on trying to convert from beer bottles to pints.<br><br>Wine bottles could be a slightly more accurate standard (provided we assume that every bottle is the standard 750 milliliters). But then you have to take quality into account. For example:<br>— In the <i>Dragon Age</i> universe, wine varies from 20 copper pieces for the cheap stuff to 3 silver for a high quality vintage.<br>— Wine has a value of 10 bottle caps in the Capital and Mojave Wastelands (varying up or down depending on who&#39;s buying or selling). Quality is irrelevant, presumably because of the nuclear apocalypse.<br>— In <i>Skyrim</i>, spiced wine goes for 7 Septims (aka gold pieces). The most expensive, Firebrand wine, is valued at a whopping 179 gold.<br><br>How helpful that is may be up for debate.<br><br>Now where&#39;s that old <i>Serenity</i> sourcebook I had...</p>

            <p>They tend to price things based on what the player needs, not what it would actually cost. To leap genres a <s>bit</s> lot, you can buy cars in <i>The Sims</i> 2 &amp; 3 that cost less than most items of furniture.<br><br>But I suppose for things like RPG sourcebooks, they might have balanced the obvious items (so you&#39;re not paying more for a loaf of bread than for a pony, for instance); I don&#39;t know.<br><br>I take your point about wine - though in some settings it&#39;s sold by the skin, of course - except that... well, writers are less likely to have given the price of a bottle of wine than a mug of ale! While the &#39;mug&#39; isn&#39;t a decent standard unit, it works as an <i>approximate</i> price.<br><br>There&#39;s a Wikibook on the <i>Harry Potter</i> currency, and <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Magic/Money">apparently JKR was a bit inconsistent</a>. Hrm... actually, the only thing inconsistent is the price of the <i>Daily Prophet</i>; everything else matches roughly with £5 to the Galleon. I think we can use that (particularly since it&#39;s Word Of God), and assume the 2 Sickle/£0.60 butterbeer is equivalent to a small bottle of Pepsi (which are currently hovering around £1).<br><br>Similarly, <a href="http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Cost_of_Living_in_Ankh-Morpork">this L-space article</a> looks at wages and the price of a curry in Ankh-Morpork, and concludes that AM$1 is worth about UK£40. Which would mean AM$1 = ʛ8. (Yes, there&#39;s a symbol for Galleons).<br><br>Which means a wand (7 galleons) costs about one AM dollar, or roughly 3 days rent in a cheap apartment in Ankh. Does that sound reasonable? Depends how expensive you think wands should be, I guess...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Games like <i>The Sims</i> can throw everything out of wack. Pizza delivery for §40 is more than a little ridiculous. (I can see a big list of banned currencies on the wall of the PPC General Store, with simoleons near the top.) RPGs are slightly more balanced, and tabletop versions moreso. <br><br>I can see your point about beer as an approximate measure. I suppose specifics can be left to the mathematically inclined. Going by that, then, in <i>Dragon Age</i> a pint of ale is 10 copper (according to the tabletop game). There are 100 copper pieces in every silver piece, and 100 silver in every gold piece.<br><br>Beer by the bottle in the Capital and Mojave Wastelands is valued at two bottle caps; the price goes up to five in the Commonwealth. Two bottle caps is also equivalent to 5 NCR dollars. Caesar&#39;s Legion uses silver and gold coins, worth 4 and 100 caps respectively.<br><br>In <i>Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</i>, a bottle of beer costs two Septim, whereas in <i>Skyrim</i> a bottle of ale is five. That basically makes the Septim equal to the bottlecap. It makes sense from a meta standpoint (Bethesda makes both games), but it&#39;s still a little strange to me.<br><br>Now for some conversion. If we assume the lowest cost possible, then 1 bottlecap = 1 Septim = 5 <i>Dragon Age</i> copper pieces. That means there are 2,000 caps/Septims per gold piece. The price of a typical beer at a U.S. bar varies, but according to averagebeerprices.com the mean is $4.65. So (values are rounded):<br>$1 = £0.66 = .43 caps/Septims = 2.15 copper pieces<br>1 cap/Septim = 5 copper = $2.33 = £1.55<br>1 gold piece = 2,000 caps/Septims = $4,660 = £3,093.62<br><br>I think. If someone wants to check my math, I would be more than grateful. We are well out of my field of study.</p>

            <p>I feel that the crafting system is fantastic, but the characters have somewhat generic reactions and don&#39;t feel as fleshed out as they had in previous games. Fallout 2 had arguably the best written dialogue, and New Vegas had arguably one of the best stories. Fallout 4 is...fun, but I don&#39;t find it as engaging as 2 or New Vegas. </p>

            <p>I think it may have been the most popular Fallout game of all time. Not surprising, considering just how awesome that game was. Buggy, but fun. 4 feels more like Skyrim than Fallout. Hopefully, we&#39;ll get some awesome mods that&#39;ll make 4 a much better Fallout game. It&#39;s a great game, but it just doesn&#39;t seem quite like a Fallout game, if you know what I mean.</p>

            <p>(Do forgive me if this sounds more like a review. Mostly Spoiler free; you&#39;re good if you&#39;ve gotten half-way through the main quest.)<br><br>First up, stuff which is either nitpicky or good:<br><br>Once I got up to level 25, enemies just stopped mattering. I&#39;ve got almost 200 stimpaks, and I&#39;m worried I just might cause an integer overflow with all the (Useless .38) ammo I have. I&#39;m assuming this is just because I&#39;m doing tons of sidequests, some of which I got in the early game, so I can&#39;t expect those to be challenging to anyone above level 10 or so. Not that rampaging around a raider-filled store isn&#39;t fun, mind you, it just gets old after a while.<br><br>One thing I dislike about the new gameplay is the fact that useless ammo is really common, while stuff that I actually need is incredibly rare. Sometimes justified, sometimes not, but either way it would have been nice to craft your own. It has allowed me to roleplay as an Ork, though, using pipe weapons, so that&#39;s good, I guess. Just never aim down the sights, and make sure to use a drum mag. It&#39;s really fun, trust me.<br><br>I love the new cast of companions, as well as the factions. The Institute enemies are quite fun, seeing as how I&#39;m essentially hacking apart T-600 Terminators with a machete. Gunners are fun, but I think we&#39;ve all seen enough &#39;generic evil mercs&#39; to last us a while. The Minutemen are quite likable in that they provide amazing contrast to the Enclave. One represents evil, pre-war America, the other shows us what America could have been without the evil and corruption. I have mixed feelings about the Brotherhood of Steel, but they&#39;ve given me a metric ton of fanfic fuel.<br><br>The companions I&#39;ve unlocked so far are all unique, but seem to share a common theme (except for Dogmeat). Not sharing what it is, for the sake of spoilers, but it&#39;s easy to figure out after a while. I loved Blade Runner, so nick Valentine is who I&#39;ve stuck with for quite a while, but I&#39;m planning on using Curie once I&#39;ve done Valentine&#39;s quest. Not sure what her carry limit is, but I hope it&#39;s really high.<br><br>I also love the new crafting system, especially it&#39;s reverence of dakka. It&#39;s like Skyrim and New Vegas had a baby, which was then raised by Orks. By that, I mean you can add an automatic receiver to almost anything, which is awesome. You can also make drugs out of antifreeze and detergent, which is funny in it&#39;s own way. The crafting system, while quirky, is most certainly the best seen so far.<br><br>Now for the bad:<br><br>Glitches galore. I had a Deathclaw rush me a while back, and I accidentally backed off a cliff. The Deathclaw followed... but wound up simply running off the edge and into the air like a Loony Toons character. While funny, it does show me that Bethesda really doesn&#39;t seem to think very highly of quality control. This isn&#39;t the only noticeable glitch I&#39;ve seen, either. During a firefight, Nick Valentine&#39;s dismissal menu popped up for no reason whatsoever, so I tabbed out, thinking it was just a small glitch. But, then he decides to dismiss himself back to the Red Rocket Truck Stop, and for some reason, his disposition dropped like a ton of bricks on Jupiter. Fortunately, I had an earlier save, plus the Debug Console, but this is getting ridiculous.<br><br>The performance is not nearly as good as I&#39;d expect, either. Mad Max had graphics that were about on-par with Fallout 4&#39;s, and my computer, for all it&#39;s faults, is quite powerful. So, imagine my surprise when I can&#39;t even get a steady 40-FPS on &#39;ultra&#39; settings. And this is after digging through the game&#39;s files and optimizing everything I could. Even with some of the settings on high, I still get &gt;20 in some areas, none of which have obvious sources of performance loss. I&#39;m talking about getting 60 FPS looking at the glorious HD world from the top of a city shop, but a five-foot patch of nondescript dirt lowers my performance down to twenty.<br><br>Finally, I feel that the new radiation system does not work very well at all. If they were trying to be more realistic, it isn&#39;t, and I&#39;m not entirely sure why they&#39;d want it to be more realistic, given that Fallout runs on pure SCIENCE! It&#39;s really quite annoying to run little damage calculations in your head now, because every rad you take makes you need to recalculate everything, as opposed to every level of radiation sickness or so. And that&#39;s without getting into contaminated food. I can&#39;t tell you how much food I&#39;ve wasted simply because radiation deals percent-based damage, while food heals a fixed number. For me at least, this new system takes a lot out of the game, due to rendering found food items nearly useless to me.<br><br>And now, we tackle the ugly:<br><br>Power armour. Almost everything about it, this time around. While I like the return to the &#39;walking tank&#39; portrayal it originally had, the almost-certainly game balance induced need for fusion cores sucks. There, I said it. It sucks. I have never before needed a glorified battery to run my power armour, so why now? This is a world where forearm-mounted computers can run for 200 years on an internal nuclear power source, and now you&#39;re telling me that I can&#39;t even get a day&#39;s worth of charge out of my armour? How did they manage to effectively deploy it during Anchorage? More importantly, how does the BOS manage to not run through their entire supply in one day? I can handle reasonable, well-used retcons, but this just breaks canon in so many ways. They should have gone with a Powered Power Armour-like system (It&#39;s an awesome mod for New Vegas). I fought a legendary raider wearing X-01 armour. Didn&#39;t even need a stimpak. So, no, game balance is no excuse for nerfing something in this manner, given how broken the game balance already is, and especially given just how many other ways exist to balance the armour.<br><br>Ultimately, I give it a 6 on a scale of one-to-ten, for being fun while also being glitchy as hell, having non-existent game balance, breaking its own canon, and using the English language. I think we need to wait a while for some patches before I truly write a review, though. Also, if it seems like I complain a lot or just savaged the game, that&#39;s pretty much normal for me.</p>

Ah well.<br><br>How is it anyway? I&#39;ve heard overall good things about it, though most of those were from people who have some format of financial stake in Blizzard (such as an e-sports team) behooving them to see the game in a more positive light.

            <p>Single-player is nice and varied and really fun to play. Story-wise, SC2 follows from the first trilogy (which you should play if your computer allows it; the game is so old now that it&#39;s incompatible with some systems) and is rather enjoyable. <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk7LcSPb0kM">Wings of Liberty</a></i>, the first instalment, features rather weak writing but <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVbeoSPqRs4">Heart of the Swarm</a></i> does improve on it though, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_XwzBMTJaM"><i>Legacy of the Void</i></a> is actually quite interesting. <br><br>Just keep in mind that the<i> StarCraft</i> universe is inherently cheesy so don&#39;t expect a John le Carré super-complex plot out of it. A lot of nostalgia fanboys have rose-tinted goggles welded over their eyes and try to pretend SC1 was a masterpiece of writing but don&#39;t give them too much cred. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-00uQzXyujI">Then again, there were some pretty cool cinematics for 1998</a>.<br><br><br>...oh yeah, and multiplayer is like 50% of the game. It&#39;s stressful but highly enjoyable-- and it&#39;s really fun to <a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/video/streams/">watch the pros play</a> too. I&#39;m a big fan of Polt (Terran) and HuK (protoss).</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t have the game right now, because of its price, not helped by the fact I had to replace my laptop, but I watched several campaign let&#39;s play and some multiplayer replays, and played with the precedent games.<br><br>This third game looks interesting, and the new coop modes are worth looking for, but I must admit I&#39;m especially attracted by the campaign, and the opportunity to play with the protoss as a whole race seems really great, replaying the missions with different units would be interesting in my opinion. <br><br>However, I cannot talk for the multiplayer at large, since I&#39;m not a pro, and it&#39;s sadly an obligation for this aspect of the game, if I get the comments about it right.<br><br>Find some videos too, it could help you to forg an opinion.</p>

            <p>Hey guys, I kind of dropped off the face of the earth for a bit thanks to college, but with the fall semester ending, I should be able to come back. If I&#39;m particularly lucky, I might even finish that first mission I&#39;ve been working on for a year and a half. So, hello again everyone! </p>

            <p>100%, the only moment when you can say that you&#39;ve really finished a game. If you want more suggestions about games, why not playing the <i>Devil Survivor</i> games? The combat system isn&#39;t to different from FE, the difficulty is there if you don&#39;t grind like mad, there is several paths in order to finish the game ... giving them a try is worth it (though you also would have to look for some path guides too. Guide Dang It moments are the worst in any game).</p>

            <p>Of course, with Xenoblade X coming out in *checks date* nine days, I probably won&#39;t need anything else for a while.<br><br>100% completion never really seemed too important (perhaps because Pokémon has gone into &quot;you want 100% completion? lol no. Enjoy completing the Pokédex in seven different languages&quot; mode). Mostly I just complete the storyline. But something about Awakening just kept dragging me back. Maybe it was Tharja&#39;s hexes?</p>

            <p>Since it was their last chance, you  can bet they asked er to curse the games so the pllayers would always come back to them. When I said 100% completion, must admit I was more thinking about the storyline and anything linked about it. <br><br>Besides, if a game has got multiple endings, I always want to reach the best endings, whence my suggeston about guides.</p>

            <p>I tried playing Lunatic once. It didn&#39;t end well. Who is your favourite character, by the way?<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for game suggestions, I recommend picking up <i>Bravely Default</i>.

            <p>I actually already have Bravely Default. I got about four hours in when it came out, then got distracted, and I&#39;ve been meaning to go back to it for some time.<br><br>My favourite character is Henry, easily. He&#39;s the funniest character in the game. ^_^ For combat, though, I prefer Laurent and Morgan, who were my endgame gods of annihilation in both of my Luna+ runs.<br><br>Ah, Lunatic. When I did Lunatic, I was a complete noob. I did Frederick Emblem then full-grind. Lunatic+ has a habit of killing Frederick in five seconds flat, though, so I had to get smarter for that. Maybe I should play through it again, just for the lulz. I mean, nine cleared files clearly isn&#39;t enough, right?</p>

            <p>PAPER: Numerology 101 Pop Quiz. That&#39;s a very uninformative title - Lord Elrond does these every other day - but it&#39;s all they&#39;ve given me.<br><br>STUDENT: &#39;Hieronymus Graubart&#39;. Can&#39;t decide whether this is more or less imaginative than the usual &#39;Fancytail Fairypants&#39; pSuedonyms.<br><br>MARKER: External assessor Huinesoron (Admin, OFUDisc). For my sins (and a bit more cash than the OFU can afford).<br><br>1. <br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: 1700ml<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: 1460ml<br>COMMENTS: Student has provided the emergency ration (intended to be one per scout party) twice, once for each scout. If H.G. was in charge of Rivendell&#39;s supplies, Lord Elrond would not be able to have a quiet drink at the end of the day. I don&#39;t imagine he&#39;ll be pleased by this.<br><br>2.<br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: 6.<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: 13.<br>COMMENTS: The student has adopted the unorthodox method of stationing the marchwardens off the riverbank. It&#39;s unclear how Lord Celeborn will take this suggestion, but I have to applaud the ingenuity.<br><br>3.<br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: &#39;Too many&#39;.<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: 10.<br>COMMENTS: The student observes that Erkenbrand&#39;s riders will be slain before the enemy war-party is halved. This is a grievous slight on the Marshal of the West-mark, and he will doubtless be visiting H.G. to avenge his honour.<br><br>4.<br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: 125<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: 125<br>COMMENTS: The first &#39;correct&#39; answer. The student proceeds to nitpick Lord Elrond&#39;s cartography, which - while entirely correct - is somewhat rude when addressed to a veteran of the Battle of Dagorlad.<br><br>5.<br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: 2554<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: 1554<br>COMMENTS: Alas, the student makes a simple arithmatic error here. He does, however, redeem himself somewhat with a pithy comment on the nature of orcs.<br><br>6.<br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: &#39;Don&#39;t bother&#39;.<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: 84.<br>COMMENTS: H.G. adds Lord Denethor and Prince Imrahil, among other lords of Southern Gondor, to the list of those he has offended. To imply that the folk of the south would fail in their duty over the threat of invasion from Umbar is a grievous slight.<br><br>7.<br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: 42.<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: 42.<br>COMMENTS: Another correct answer, though the student forgets that <i>lembas</i> might only be cooked by the queens of the Eldar, who are notably lacking in the Greenwood.<br><br>8.<br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: 70<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: 70<br>COMMENTS: As H.G. had no comment, nor do I.<br><br>9.<br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: 8h 15m<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: 8h 15m<br>COMMENTS: It seems that H.G.&#39;s expertise lies mostly with short people, judging by his performance in the last two questions.<br><br>10.<br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: 37.44<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: 37.44<br>COMMENTS: Perhaps I should use this space to invent the first line of a bestselling children&#39;s novel. Let me think... &#39;It was a dark and stormy once upon a time...&#39;<br><br>11.<br>STUDENT&#39;S ANSWER: 10<br>PROVIDED ANSWER: (9. <b>9</b>. <i><b><u>9</u></b></i>!!!<br>COMMENTS: Oh dear.<br><br>TOTAL SCORE: 5/11<br>TOTAL OFUM STAFF MORTALLY OFFENDED: 4+.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Thank you for doing this.

            <p>I love all the different groups and settings you managed to work into the OFUM test, and the variety of question setups you used in the OFUU one.

            <p>OFUU is an interesting case: it kind of exists <i>in potentia</i>. Kaitlyn got permission from Miss Cam to write a <i>Labyrinth</i> OFU, but never did; a couple of years later, Fou Fou wrote her version.<br><br>As you can imagine, this has left Miss Kaye and her staff royally ticked off.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Miss Kaye lent heavily on her desk and glowered at the intruder. &quot;You&#39;ve found a <i>what</i>?&quot;<br><br>Unfortunately, the intruder in question was named Sarah, and having fought her way through the Labyrinth to rescue her baby brother, was not particularly intimidated by a frizzy-haired girl who thought corset-print t-shirts were the height of fashion. &quot;Another Labyrinth OFU,&quot; she repeated. &quot;They call themselves the Labyrinth Academy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmph. They can&#39;t be much good,&quot; Miss Kaye sniffed. &quot;They must have, what, a staff entirely made up of goblins and those weird pixie things that move floor tiles around?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nope.&quot; Sarah paused, smiling slightly. &quot;They&#39;ve got the full staff. My... <i>contact</i> says their Goblin King gets stampeded regularly by fangirls and has a feud going with Hoggle.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What.&quot; Miss Kaye grabbed a random sheet of paper off her desk, crumpled it up savagely in one hand, and threw it at the wall. As it bounced unheeded to the floor (to be collected by a small goblin who thought it the best toy she&#39;d ever seen), the Course Coordinator stood up and strode out from behind the desk. &quot;So Jareth is moonlighting, is he? I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised; but <i>Hoggle</i>?&quot; She shook her head. &quot;So where are they hiding out? It&#39;s the oubliette, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s always the oubliette.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re in the castle beyond the goblin city,&quot; Sarah said airily. &quot;You&#39;re not <i>getting</i> it, Miss Kaye. They&#39;re in an alternate Labyrinth - another Word World, if I&#39;m remembering what those PPC agents called it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; Now Miss Kaye looked bewildered. &quot;I thought you meant... but we&#39;re official! Miss Cam herself gave me this role! What right have they to start there own OFU?&quot;<br><br>There was a sound from the door - the sound of an incredibly suave ego-on-legs arriving. &quot;It&#39;s hardly surprising,&quot; the Goblin King said, leaning against the doorframe and rolling a crystal across his knuckles. &quot;It isn&#39;t as though our university ever <i>opened...</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re getting there!&quot; Miss Kaye snapped, then swallowed hard. &quot;I mean... we&#39;re getting there, your majesty,&quot; she said in a much more controlled voice. &quot;There are organisational-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thirteen years,&quot; the Goblin King cut in, the crystal vanishing from his fingertips. &quot;Thirteen years you have been &#39;getting there&#39;. I don&#39;t usually allow visitors more than thirteen <i>hours</i>. My patience is... wearing thin.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I understand that,&quot; Miss Kaye said, her voice subdued. &quot;I... I&#39;ll speed things up, I promise.&quot;<br><br>&quot;See that you do.&quot; The Goblin King straightened up, and his gaze latched on to Sarah. &quot;Well, Sarah?&quot; he said. &quot;Shall we take our leave?&quot;<br><br>Sarah didn&#39;t move for a moment. Then she nodded at Miss Kaye, turned, and hurried out of the door - the <i>other</i> door.<br><br>&quot;Hm.&quot; The Goblin King looked at his fingers, as if expecting to see something there. &quot;Well. Carry on, Miss Kaye.&quot; And, crossing the stone floor, he headed off after Sarah.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>That snippet probably isn&#39;t canon, but it showcases how I&#39;m likely to treat OFUU if I ever feel like writing it: a Coordinator who&#39;s utterly intimidated by her staff, characters holding tightly to their movie personalities, nothing from <i>outside</i> the movies (no &#39;Williams&#39; surname for Sarah, no romance between them beyond what&#39;s suggested by the film, and Jareth - who isn&#39;t usually called by name - is <i>not</i> a nice person)... yeah.<br><br>But odds are Miss Kaye will show up long before her OFU does.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s as close to canon as makes no difference - it&#39;s in the <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/script.txt">initial script</a> (which also reveals that Sarah&#39;s mother was an actress). I have no problems at all with it being her canonical surname - but for OFUU, if it&#39;s not in the film as shown, it&#39;s not used. Same goes for the extended Firey sequence and the actual meaning of &#39;sometimes the way forward is also the way back&#39; from <a href="http://www.crazyattic.com/tgl/n/completenovel.htm">the novelisation</a>.<br><br>Jareth/Sarah shipping... well, the potential is there. Jareth either feels something or wants Sarah to believe he does (see: <i>Within You</i>), and Sarah... hard to say. Her performance at the beginning of the film suggests someone who <i>wants</i> to fall in love with the Goblin King, but then she grows up...<br><br>Come to think of it, Jareth&#39;s &#39;affection&#39; seems to grow over the course of the film. I think there&#39;s a plot-nuzgul in &#39;as his desire for her grows, she grows beyond desiring a fairytale&#39;; it certainly fits the &#39;mirror&#39; theme of the film.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>representative of the fact that Sarah had become so attached to the fairy tale stuff, that she wasn&#39;t allowing herself to emotionally mature beyond it.  So Jareth&#39;s regard for her is in the form of an unhealthy relationship that&#39;s all in service to the fantasy world, through its ruler, and not actually good for Sarah herself; hence, why she has to learn to reject it.<br><br>—doctorlit may be too little awake for this to make sense, hopes it isn&#39;t flat-out gibberish.</p>

            <p>...not to make your docs available for public view. Crowdsourcing for betas is not a good idea. Just say that you want someone to beta your work with a brief description, and send a PM with a link to anyone who&#39;s willing to help.<br><br>I&#39;m honestly touched that you wish to take after my style of mission writing, but please be aware that I may not necessarily be the best source of inspiration, especially since I feel that my missions began to drag quite a bit this past summer. The stress that began sinking in caused my prose to plod a lot more than I feel it should, which is an example I wouldn&#39;t want others to follow. You can use my earlier ones as a reference - now THOSE were a lot of fun - but I would kindly advise working towards your own unique style of writing once you get the hang of things. Imitation may be the most sincere form of flattery, but it can only get you so far, especially when it comes to writing.<br><br>I think I can beta read your stuff tonight... if RL doesn&#39;t get to me first.</p>

            <p>So I&#39;ve been checking out the board history in my spare time. I&#39;ve noticed there hasn&#39;t(or there was but I didn&#39;t notice) been a thread about Gary stus and Mary sues and whatever the nonbinary term for them would be on youtube. I was expecting to see more threads about it with how many are on there. So I&#39;ve made this thread so we can talk about them and share a few that we have found. <br><br>Two I want to mention right off the bat:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZzUIMsIYmgw_hwZLbZxeMkkDi4SLdsC4"> Blood Raining Night</a>: Warning for Blood,violence,nakedness,loud noises,poorly censored sex,sex with a dog demon,NSFB, and NSFW. Yes this fanime is based on the still ongoing fanfic that was missioned by Agent Supernumerary,agent Ilraen,and Nurse Jennifer Robinson.  The theme song is an Elfen Lied song with poorly done lyrics and naked sue. It actually deviates from the fanfic and things are changed and attempts to fill plot points,but it&#39;s still about as good as the fanfic.  Everything was drawn or had a based used,which you have to admit it&#39;s nice to know the creator is above tracing or just drawing her oc on offical images,which is better than the next guy. <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq8_DDydsnc6gVFWU8NB3HBhUVpnNrUE7">Elthibar&#39;s Adventures of Brave</a> is the completed youtube story of a person&#39;s gary stu self insert who is paired with Merida. And he draws his oc into offical movie screenshots and video clips. Or he puts his oc against a white background while supposedly talking to canons. I&#39;ve only started the first episode so I don&#39;t know the warnings for the series. However the creator of it has a DA account where he claims Christians are being banned off of DA because one person got banned for block evading,is homophobic,transphobic,and super pro-life to the point <a href="http://lordelthibar.deviantart.com/art/Princess-Anna-of-Arendelle-448216852"> he writes pro-life phrases on Disney princess dresses.</a> So similar things might appear in the series. <br><br>Got any other series about a Gary stu or Mary sue? Got any options on these? I&#39;d love to hear what you guys think. </p>

            <p>Since Aiko, one of my agents, lived in the Nursery for about six years, she will tend to make frequent visits there to help out the staff and spend time with old friends. <br><br>I will write this kind of scene in the pre-mission part of my next mission and in a few interludes. I will obviously come up with a few child characters of my own to populate these writings, but I would also like to ask permission from a few of you to use your child characters in those stories, specially from those of you who have a character who has been there for a few years.</p>

            <p>I will have to plan plenty of these interludes and scenes in the Nursery, it seems. <br><br>I think I will accept you offer. I would love have to have a child character of my own to write. Of course, I probably will have at least two more of them after my next planned mission, where Aiko and Henry will have to rescue at least two child bit-characters from a really irresponsible orphanage.

            <p>I&#39;m glad he&#39;ll have someone to officially look after him—it&#39;d be nice to see him get adopted in-universe, too, but until that happens he&#39;s got Agent Ilraen and Nurse Robinson looking in on him occasionally in an unofficial capacity; Ilraen because he feels somewhat responsible for him as the agent who brought him in, and Jenni because he&#39;s about the same age as Henry and thus they are friends. As such, he appears with them in the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=2956;">Trick or Treat 2013 RP</a>.

            <p>I&#39;ll take very good care of him. As for in-universe adopton, as you know, my agents are still quite young and probably not able to become anyone&#39;s legal guardian yet. But maybe that could be arranged once I retcon the agents who rescued Aiko and Anju into existence. They were their legal guardians while they were still at the Nursery.  It wouldn&#39;t be much stretch fo them to become Ian&#39;s. But until that happens and even after, I will definitely take Ilraen and Nurse Robinson into account. Maybe we could arrange for a few  interlude co-writes involving both my characters and yours visiting the Nursey at the same time. <br><br>Thanks for the RP link. That will certainly help me quite a bit. Specially considering that it seems that is the same RP Dawn was talking about earlier in this thread. <br><br>Didn&#39;t know if you had seen that reply. Thank you. Aside from that minor  mistake, the IDs for both of them are quite awesome! :D</p>

            <p>Again, sorry it took so long. In addition to being busy, I was hoping Silenthunder would reply with the info for her agents&#39; IDs, so I could work on them all together, but I dunno what happened there. Anyway, all done now, and I&#39;m glad you like them. ^<em>^<br><br>I&#39;d love to get a co-write in somewhere.

Basically, my idea is that I want Ilraen to get sex-educated, and I thought he could sit in on a Bad Slash achievement badge activity with some of the older kids, with many funny looks and much hilarity abounding.

            <p>Yeah, it probably wouldn&#39;t work out very well indeed. Clowns can be indeed very creepy, specially if your home continuum has something like <a href="http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Piedmon">Piedmon</a> in it. By Azulongmon, that guy still gives the creeps just from looking at his DigiWiki page! * shudders * <br><br>Still, the PPC is mostly about comedy and a lot of comedy can come from uncomfortable situations. I probably won&#39;t do it if I&#39;m writing a scene where Aiko is going to Nursery to cheer herself up and have fun after a particularly bad mission, such as the one I am going to do now, but for the sake of a scene that was done mostly just to be hilarious?

            <p>I will have to keep that In mind if I ever decide to use her. Aiko is probably too nice of a person to say outright say anything that would trigger that berserk button though.

            <p>And they&#39;ve been there since mid to late 2011, though they were a six month old and two fetuses at that point. They should be, um, roughly three and four by now? All three are badfic rescues (Torchwood canon, historical mission still in the works--Karen and I want to rewrite what we have, and are both kind of busy with school right now); two are on the wiki, under Seren Sato and Owain Sato, because they appeared in a TYH interlude as well as an rp. Their older sister, Ruby, doesn&#39;t have her own page.<br><br>Unfortunately, I&#39;m not sure the RP link works anymore. Hopefully, it&#39;s archived. I can give you descriptions of personality and so on if you want to use them (which would be pretty cool :) ), but I&#39;d prefer to be able to look over their appearance(s) before you post. Depending on the piece and what&#39;s going on IRL at that point, I can act as a general beta as well, if you like. But yeah, the Satos making an appearance sounds like a lot of fun. I&#39;m in with the condition of looking them over :)<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: If you&#39;ve read the interlude--Davey isn&#39;t around yet, and probably won&#39;t be for a while yet, assuming he does make it into canon. It&#39;s just Ruby, Seren, and Owain for now.</p>

            <p>They are badfic refugees AND they are also non-canon children of two canons (or at least Seren and Owain are. Would I right to assume that Ruby is also one?), which Aiko has a particular soft spot for because she also is a non-canon daughter of two canons. And if they have been there for the last 4 years she would be quite familiar with them, so that should make for some very nice scenes. :D <br><br>It should go without saying that you can look over whatever appearances they make.

            <p>And wonderful. I just wanted to be sure that came across, since it wasn&#39;t mentioned and I didn&#39;t want one of us to think it was implied and the other not. As for descriptions...essentially, Owain is given to pouting and having fun, Seren is pretty stubborn, and Ruby can get very charming, but is also, well, tiny. Beyond that, what I know about them is kind of mixed up with how they get when they&#39;re older (in terms of interests, looks, and further personality). I&#39;ll see what I can dig up for scenes with them--I think I might actually have a chunk of the rp saved, come to think of it. Lemme go search &#39;green slime&#39; :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I am *very* pleased to announce that I&#39;ve found the scenes in question, archived in the 2014...Archive spreadsheet thing. Basically: Tomash and hS (and anyone else who&#39;s involved) are the absolute best ever, and I will be transferring the scenes to a doc of some sort.<br><br>And here we go. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kMEDfvHmR1JYlQZMdfAXG5BHto-DqeUigilQRtWnJtE/edit?usp=sharing">This</a> is the relevant scene. It&#39;s set about a year and a half ago, pretty much; they&#39;ll have changed somewhat, and Ruby unfortunately didn&#39;t make it in, but that&#39;s the scene I was citing on the Wiki page. I&#39;ll add it in there now, and eventually probably make a copy of the full thread (to put that scene in context and because it was awesome). I&#39;ll also take a look to see if I have any scenes with Ruby in them that aren&#39;t major spoilers...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>That is a quite hilarous scene and it does sound like it was an awesome rp, so please do make a full copy of it. <br><br>And it also helps me quite a bit. If you do find any spoiler-free scenes containing Ruby, I think I will be all set to write the scene.  <br><br>I try to use them in the prelude part of my next mission. They should make for a quite cute and funny scene, which should work out nicely since Aiko needs some serious cheering up after her last mission.

            <p>I will definitely search for it hS&#39; site. And don&#39;t worry, you can as much time as you need to send me the scene with Ruby. I&#39;m certainly in no rush. The fic I am missioning this time is 12 chapters long, so it will probably take me a few months to write the thing. <br><br>And awesome :D I&#39;m also sure they will be quite able to cheer her up, even if they don&#39;t quite (or more likely, at all) get what is going on. Plus, it is likely that she will have to come right back to the Nursery to bring in at least 3 child characters they would have rescued from the badfic, so it&#39;s also likely that they might just get a bit more of screen time, so yay for that! :D </p>

            <p>If the mission was set 18 months ago, then she should be a toddler by now, which should work out nicely.

            <p>Real life&#39;s been ridiculously busy. I haven&#39;t thought of any other details, after all she was only and infant when she was picked up. But her mother was of Latin American ancestry, however badly written, so that will probably be reflected in the way she looks.</p>

            <p>That certainly helps me a bit, at least in the description aspect. But even if you hadn&#39;t though about any other details before, she&#39;s still your character and I assume that at some point you will want use her in your own writing. This really should go without saying, but when I end up using her in one of my stories, I will send it to you first to see if you agree with whatever details I have decided to use.</p>

Where there is fiction, fanfiction follows. <br><br>So, since the Word Worlds are considered their own independent universes in their own rights... does that mean there are separate branches of the PPC for, or at least agents specialized in, these subcontinua? <br><br>Obviously, we&#39;d never be able to do missions into these series because we don&#39;t have access to any of this theoretical fanfiction for them (never mind canon to judge against), but people in the PPC ostensibly would.<br><br>So, what do you guys think? Do missions into the <i>Martin Miggs</i> universe and various other fictional series happen, and we just never see them? Or not?</p>

Both propose three levels of reality:<br><br>-Atomic world(s)<br>-Canon worlds<br>-Fanfiction<br><br>Agents can read the Words in fanfic, but not often in canon - though Flowers can read canon words with ease. No agent or Flower has ever read the Words of World One, so it is assumed to be a real, Atomic world.<br><br>The difference is that ACE says there is one atomic world (World One), where authors create canons. The Compromise Theory says that there are many atomic worlds, and authors create canons by drawing from those. So there is a real Middle-earth, which Tolkien drew on to create at least two Word Worlds - the &#39;canon&#39; version, and the <i>Book of Lost Tales</i>. Fanfic then draws on those Word Worlds to create its own, subsidiary Word Worlds.<br><br>Under pure ACE, it&#39;s entirely possible that only atomic people can create Word Worlds. Under the Compromise Theory, there are atomic people behind the word-based inhabitants of canon, who can write as much as they want.<br><br>This may mean that, as with so many things in HQ, the existence of those parts of the PPC depends on your point of view.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve mentioned before how I believe all &quot;fiction&quot; to be real somewhere in this big, old reality of ours.  I&#39;m sure the PPC is much larger in scope than we realize, limited by what we experience of our world&#39;s fiction.  They must be dealing with fanfiction from most continua that exist.  So Martin Miggs is resident to some world, possibly close to the Potterverse world in having Muggles, possibly even our world! (with the Potterverse artist not realizing the character they dreamed of came from a world where &quot;Muggle&quot; has no meaning), and Potterverse people right fanfictions about that, and the PPC surely deals with them.<br><br>Of course, in my version of the model, the PPC wouldn&#39;t need separate departments/divisions to deal with those, since they wouldn&#39;t differentiate between one word world or another, but I know not everyone here shares my insanity, so.<br><br>—doctorlit has thought on doing a fully fabricated mission of that sort.

            <p>I just remembered SeaTurtle&#39;s writing who&#39;s the prologue for this story. It was pretty interesting and it shows that Floaters really do <i>anything</i>. HQ is can be more interesting that badfic sometimes.<br><br>( And Librarian really needs to break this Tablet/Riddle addiction, though. One day the IO will remember he exists and ... well, judging the way he has gone pretty much unscathed without doing anything during missions, it will bite him really hard.)</p>

            <p>I have a question again.<br><br>What exactly is the standard for recruiting an PPC agent?<br><br>I mean, apart from some of the obvious requirements like not being a Sue/Stu or a fanbrat, having good writing skills, able to handle explicit badfics.......<br><br>But is there a requirement for minimum ages?<br><br>Yep, having underage kids sent into potentially dangerous continnums and expecting them to kill Sues/Stus are probably too much even for the standard of Flowers, but I just wonder if there is actually a minimum age requirement.<br><br>Like, if an recruit is only fourteen or fifteen, is it totally impossible for them to become an PPC agent, or do they have to show qualities or abilities of a certain standard?  </p>

            <p>...but, yes, there are standards. (I don&#39;t know, are there?)<br><br>The requirements are essentially: Able to serve some purpose within the PPC, willingness to not burn the Flowers, and willingness to get horribly killed in some fashion (For the action departments, at least). I doubt the PPC would put a six/seven year old in the literal line of fire, but if they happen to be a math genius or something, well, there&#39;s always room in finance!<br><br>So, no, I would not say there is an age requirement for joining the PPC proper, considering that virtually every department is short-staffed. Look at WWII, the US started recruiting little kids to collect scrap and do other odd jobs. Unless you count tetanus, it&#39;s a non-dangerous job. I doubt the PPC would reject volunteer help, even from a child (Depending on the job, of course.)<br><br>This actually ties into another discussion I saw once, about the minimum drinking age in HQ. The general consensus (Last I checked) was that anyone old enough to fight is old enough to drink.</p>

            <p>How would such age requirements apply to children from the Nursery? I know that there are quite a few accounts of Nursery-raised children going on to become full-fledged agents, but most of them seem to be somewhat unclear/contradictory about the exact age are they generally allowed to start interning/working in the field, so I&#39;m quite curious.</p>

            <p>...most writers specify what their agent&#39;s human-age-equivalence is; one of my agents, for example, is a Pokémon who only recently turned three, but he&#39;s got the mentality of a human teenager (something like 18-19).<br><br>So it&#39;s not so much what their physical age is as it is their mental age; the Flowers want to make sure they&#39;re mature enough to cope with badfic or not.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t remember if I said before, but I did read it, and it was awesome. ^_^ I really love the fact that, despite me not remembering the canon sequence at all, I can construct the story of what&#39;s happening in the DoM purely from the trace - at the same time as Ms. Hopkirk is. The amount of story inherent in some of your simple phrases - &#39;Something was banished, something was summoned, and something was split&#39; - is just chilling. And the way the tension ramps up until the very end - it&#39;s really very good.<br><br>But I&#39;m not here to (re?)review the story (which I couldn&#39;t resist rereading, as you may be able to tell); I&#39;m here to talk about the cover art. I really like the explosion, with the pieces of paper flying out; it looks extremely realistic. And even though Ms. Hopkirk&#39;s expression looks fairly neutral, there&#39;s something about it... the set of her jaw conveys determination, but something about her eyes also conveys the bewilderment she feels all the way through the story.<br><br>(Also, her buttons match the emblem on her door. Character profile in a button, how&#39;s that for nifty?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Awkward newbie here. It is 1:39 in the morning, I&#39;m one paragraph away from finishing an essay due at 9 am, and I finally have the sleep deprivation/lack of self consciousness necessary to post here. <br>So, hi! I&#39;m emythos, I used to read PPC stuff all the time as a bitty middle schooler/early high schooler, got out of it and figured too much had happened for me to get back into it. Recently, it was mentioned on a different forum I&#39;m on, I had a nostalgia attack and figured I&#39;d reread some, assuming it had probably gone defunct or something. Then I got here and realized no, it hadn&#39;t. And that I might as well FINALLY TRY TO TALK TO PEOPLE, instead of being a shy dork who can&#39;t even talk to people over the internet.<br>So, yeah. </p>

            <p>Ah, hello there, fellow newbie! *offers coffee cup* Sorry about the late welcome - I just got back to the Board after a short time away, and felt it would be rude not to greet you, so here I am!<br><br>I myself first got into the PPC around the same age you did (and, like you, also fell away from it for a time before finally deciding to come back and join the community properly), so I can very much relate to you on that one. They&#39;re a very pleasant bunch around here though, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll feel right at home.<br><br>Just watch out for the potted Wilver ferns in the corner.

            <p>I definitely know what it feels like to be too nervous to make a post here. It took me a long time between discovering about the PPC and this very Board and actually introducing myself. You&#39;re definitely not alone in that regard. And I think you will find that is the just about the friendliest and the most welcoming community out there. People here are very warm and understanding. Just by simply making this post, You&#39;ve already become a part of this community and it won&#39;t very long before you feel like it. <br><br>As for your welcoming gift, have a Bag of Holding, so that you are able to store the truckload of gifts you are getting.  </p>

            <p>For once. Sorry this is pretty late, I had early classes and decided to pay attention.<br>I&#39;m always so happy to meet people who&#39;ve even heard of The Dresden Files, let alone have read them! The only reason my irl friends know about them is because I keep throwing my copies at them, trying to convince them to read. The only person I&#39;ve really gotten hooked so far is my boyfriend, who&#39;s just gotten through Death Masks.<br>So, spinoffs I&#39;ve read! Right now I&#39;m working through Rina + Randa, earlier on I read Suicide+Diocletian, Laburnum+Foxglove, hmm. I read a bunch, but that was a few years back and now I&#39;m stuck trying to remember. Uh, Xericka? And then I remember reading a mission for Katekyo Hitman Reborn, but I&#39;m not sure who&#39;s it was. Argh, now I feel stupid. <br>I&#39;m watching the Jessica Jones show right now, and that&#39;s really good. Did you see that or Daredevil? I really like Tamora Pierce&#39;s books, especially The Immortals. I like Agatha Christie mysteries (especially Tommy and Tuppence), but those don&#39;t really get fanfic. Same goes for Dorothy L. Sayers. I just started reading One Punch Man, after much harrassing from friends. Harry Potter, like pretty much everyone. I&#39;m probably going to just keep thinking of more and more. XD </p>

            <p>As I told emythos, I&#39;m terribly bad at explaining why I like something, and since I don&#39;t know <i>The Mortal Instruments</i> or <i>Elder Scrolls</i>, I may not even have the right words to talk about William and Za&#39;kiir.  Anyway, I liked this very much and want to see more of them both.<br><br>Now to less pleasant things. You know this always happens when I comment.<br><br><i>“Drinking is normal,” he said, letting his paw move <b>back its</b> original position by his side.</i><br> Missing word &quot;to&quot;?<br><br><i>So, <b>one one</b> hand you want to keep bad memories, and forget them on the other.</i><br>Should be &quot;on one&quot;.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m not sure whether it is possible to see a <i>patch of sky through the open door.</i> I got the impression that Rudi&#39;s is somewhere in the endless corridors of PPC HQ, not in the New Caledonian PPC city. <br><br><i>Natalie, who was sitting <b>before</b> the console on a revolving chair, turned at the cautious knocking sound.</i><br>Gerrman/Polish habit again? But isn&#39;t this Silenthunder&#39;s part? My dictionary keeps telling me that &quot;before&quot; relates to time and order of events, while the same German word referring to position relative to an object would be translated to &quot;in front of&quot; or simply &quot;at&quot;, although the latter may imply that Natalie is actually doing something at the console rather than just sitting there.<br><br>And there are one or two typos in &quot;Sugar Spell&quot;:<br><br><i>And even if that is not the same heavenly gift, <b>it it</b> still a good substitute.</i><br>Should be &quot;it is&quot;.<br><br><i>He would make amends to Natalie as soon as <b>she</b> came back ...</i><br>I think this should be &quot;he&quot;. As far as I&#39;m aware, Natalie didn&#39;t leave and thus won&#39;t come back. But Za&#39;kiir left and comes back to her at the end of &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot;.<br> <br>HG</p>
