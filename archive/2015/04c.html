            <p>Nothing I did made it make any more sense. They&#39;re not really &quot;bad&quot; so much as just really strange. Some of them, at least. And one of my friends may know some more about them, though the reliability of her info is somewhat lacking. Were you wondering because you&#39;ve read some of these things, or was it something else? I&#39;m just curious.</p>

            <p>Let me let you all in on why I hid the suggestions and suggestion makers last time. I wanted to be able to filter out any bad suggestions without hurting anybody&#39;s feelings. It&#39;s difficult sometimes to make good <i>Whose Line</i> suggestions, especially for Scenes from a Hat. Well, that and I could slip in whatever I want without anybody yelling at me that I pulled the topic from a... different source. For this game though, that&#39;s not as vital. Just put a situation, place, or thing to make horrible innuendos about. Actually, since I&#39;m talking about this:<br><br>The suggestions do not need to be directly correlated to the PPC. They can be absolutely anything, from Real Life, to fandom, what have you. Just, avoid specific people, please. That is against the spirit of the game, and really, really creepy. Here, let me show you with the next topic.</p>

            <p>&quot;I understand your anger. The broker herself has said that the Rose Potter series was a job for the Special Operations Division. There is an overwhelming chance that this was simply a mistake. Even then Madam frequently receives requests to release the identity of spies who have assigned particularly nasty missions to various agent teams. She always refuses: we are simply doing our job. However...&quot; Tacitus readjusted his bite on his pencil. &quot;Madam may investigate the agent in question and <i>strongly</i> encourage DoI&#39;s administrative corps to conduct an audit of that agent&#39;s performance if they have been derelict in their duty. Said agent will most likely be disciplined by the Sub Rosa herself.&quot;<br><br>Tacitus looked at Zeb. &quot;But for Madam to do work on your behalf, she needs to be paid. As one of her official intermediaries I can present your case to Madam if you want.&quot;</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a slightly archaic British term for people who abuse their power and are unpleasant to deal with. While it has been superseded by the considerably more mild (and more focused on bureaucracy) &quot;jobsworth&quot;, as in &quot;it&#39;s more than my job&#39;s worth to do X, Y, and Z&quot;, the original term was &quot;little Hitler&quot;. The Guardsman is someone whose personal politics I find deeply unpleasant. Owen, well, let&#39;s just say I&#39;m in full agreement with you. Any organization that has a place in its ranks for people like them is in dire need of drastic reform.</p>

            <p>Very heavy on the law&#39;n&#39;order, very militaristic. I&#39;m extremely left-wing politically, so it rubs me up the wrong way.<br><br>And now we get to the more important part of this post:-<br><br>I&#39;m sorry I insulted you. When I&#39;m arguing about something, I tend to look at it as a battle you have to win, which is stupid. I then tend to try and browbeat the opposition into submission with high-handed insults, which is even more stupid. I won&#39;t say I didn&#39;t mean any offence because that&#39;d be disingenuous, but I will definitely try to moderate my tone in future.<br><br>I&#39;m an extremely angry person. It&#39;s a reason for a lot of my behaviour, not - and I wish to make this clear - even close to an excuse. There&#39;s this bubbling cauldron of frustration below the surface <i>all the time</i> and I can&#39;t always stop myself from boiling over, so a lot of the time I don&#39;t try. This is a stupid course of action, because it means I get into vicious circles that end up in apoplexy and loneliness.<br><br>Mostly, though, I think I lay into people a lot because I can&#39;t do it to myself. That and I have very little emotional intelligence.<br><br>Again, the important part: I&#39;m sorry for what I said. It was stupid of me to say it and you deserve to be treated better than you have been by me.</p>

            <p>Genuinely, why bother trying to fix something that broken? My experiences with therapy have ranged from the useless to the actively harmful because I deflect and lie through my teeth and tell the poor sods trying to psychoanalyze me what I think they want to hear. You need to know when to cut your losses and focus on the stuff you <i>can</i> deal with.

            <p>But I read a line like that and I get concerned.  Now I do not know your situation, and I do not like to pry.  People keep a degree of anonymity online for a reason.  But from what I have read of the preceding conversation, I will say this.<br><br>First, as I do not know the specifics of your situation I cannot say exactly, but those emotions, attitudes, I have been down that road before, I was able to get through it.  It took me nearly a decade to do it, but I managed.  And I wish I had someone then to tell me some of what I learned now.  It would have made things easier.  But you do not have to do it alone.  Trust me, I know, I tried for nearly a decade to work through the issues on my own.      It did not work.  Now I am not saying you need to see a psychologist or anything like that, but having anyone to talk to or with helps immensely.  <br><br>Second, if it really is just about the pent up anger, what I did was I redirected it, in a controlled situation.  I know that is pretty pithy advice, but without prying that&#39;s the most I can.  But remember you do not need to work through it alone.<br><br>If this came off as preachy, I am sorry, I did not intend to do that.  And I mean no offense by what I have said.</p>

            <p>Zeb&#39;s tail flicked in agitation. &quot;I suppose you wouldn&#39;t be willing to not use that, either? Never mind, I already know the answer.&quot; He mentally cursed the fact that his old trainer had never taught him Fire Fang. Perhaps, assuming Owen wouldn&#39;t outspeed him, he could use Thunder Wave and paralyze him, then move in with Discharge? Lucario weren&#39;t known for their Special Defense... But then again, Luxray weren&#39;t that great with Special Attack...<br><br>He couldn&#39;t back down without looking like he&#39;d just been bragging.

            <p>&quot;Let&#39;s move away from the rest of the group: no need to start tearing up their picnic, right?&quot; said Owen as he moved away from the picnic area. He took a deep breath and focused on Zeb&#39;s Aura, looking for information on his opponent. <i>Interesting</i>, thought Owen as he sifted though the memories in the Luxray&#39;s Aura. <br><br><i>Very Electric-based attack setup. Thunder Fang, Shock Wave, Thunder Wave, Discharge, and the obvious Bite. He&#39;ll obviously try to paralyze me first and take advantage of my reduced speed. Zebby-zeb is probably going to try and spook me with his Intimidate too... Thunder Fang is going to hurt like no tomorrow... But what if I hit him with Earthquake right off the bat and dash away with Extreme Speed? He&#39;ll be disoriented and then I&#39;ll finish him off with another Earthquake from a distance, no sweat. Failing that... just power through the paralysis. I&#39;m faster than Zebby-zeb anyways so I&#39;ll land the first hit. Sounds good.</i><br><br>He looked around. He was standing in the middle of a relatively flat plain with grass that came up to his knees. There were no rocks or trees or shrubs that could offer cover or obstacles to either fighter. &quot;This looks like a good spot, doesn&#39;t it? Well then, I shall take this side and you&#39;ll go there. I&#39;ll even be a nice guy and let you make the  opening move... if I don&#39;t outspeed you, that is.&quot;<br><br> - - -<br><br>Serious Lucario (Inner Focus): 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe <br>Earthquake / Aura Sphere / Extreme Speed / Close Combat<br><br>Timid Luxray (Intimidate): 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe<br>Discharge / Thunder Fang / Shock Wave / Bite<br><br>Smogon&#39;s damage calculator predicts an intimidated Lucario winning with a 2HKO using Earthquake. Zeb has a chance of winning if Owen is immobilized for two consecutive turns-- which only has a 1/16 chance of happening. How do you want this fight to go?</p>

            <p>Shame and embarrassment welled up in the defeated Lucario&#39;s mind. <i>You couldn&#39;t even move,</i> he thought. <i>You are weak. Worthless. Full of Tauros dung. Disgusting. If this were an actual situation you would&#39;ve failed your team. Idiot. You failed. You have every reason to hate yourself. Failure. You weren&#39;t raised to be some easily-beaten Magikarp.

What are you doing here?&quot;<br><br>The Skiddo, who had been napping on the ground, yawned without opening his eyes. &quot;You know... resting,&quot; mumbled Buck.

            <p>Buck looked nervously around at the still-giggling Luxray, the rather irritated Time Lady, and Owen who looked like he was repressing a primal urge to tear his own heart out with his bare paws. He was pretty sure he missed something important during his nap. Maybe he should actually try the Chesto berry diet that Benoît was trying to feed him instead of grazing and napping in the Courtyard every day. <br><br>Trying to change the topic, he said: &quot;Did... um.

            <p>I&#39;ve run into a stumbling-block in a story I&#39;m working on, and I need some help...<br><br>Does anyone else remember the claims that Peter Jackson had altered the timeline of Middle-earth in the movieverse? I <i>think</i> it centred around the fact that Frodo&#39;s 17 years as <i>the</i> Baggins of Bag-End were cut out - but I also have a vague recollection that there was a bit of supporting evidence somewhere. Someone&#39;s age was changed, or a date was altered, or... something.<br><br>The <i>Hobbit</i> trilogy backs this up, of course, with Legolas being told about a &#39;young Ranger&#39; named Strider - at least, I <i>hope</i> Aragorn wasn&#39;t out a&#39;Ranging at his canonical age of ten (Encyclopedia of Arda also suggests Legolas was told to meet Arathorn - a bit of a trick, since he&#39;s eight years dead and buried!). The fact that Aragorn gives his age <i>correctly</i> to Eowyn as 87 means we pretty much have to have a time compression of some sort - but does anyone know, remember, or be-able-to-reconstruct the details?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...is that somewhere, possibly on cards or something, Legolas&#39; age was given as Aragorn&#39;s birth year (2934, I think?)<br><br>You can probably track down a timeline somewhere if you google, maybe on a wiki...most fandoms seem to have them (which can be very useful!)<br><br>If Aragorn was a &#39;young Ranger&#39; at the age of ten, I expect it&#39;s just him roleplaying with Elladan and Elrohir humoring him because they either think it&#39;s fun or will be good training. Legolas probably just ignored the fact that he was being told about this young Ranger with a lot of smirking and hidden grins...<br><br>There&#39;s also the bit where book!Frodo is the oldest of the Hobbits and book!Pippin is the youngest, but it&#39;s actually reversed with the actors. I don&#39;t think that was really addressed in the movies, though; Pippin is certainly still called &#39;young&#39;, and I think I remember Merry saying something about his younger cousin or somesuch...that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.<br><br>I think probably looking for a timeline is your best bet.

            <p>I have turned up one article - literally just now - which addresses the whole field:<br><br><a href="http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2015/03/31/97631-a-speculative-history-of-aragorn-ii-in-peter-jacksons-middle-earth/">This piece</a> notes the following:<br><br><i>In the commentary track with Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, the director and writers discuss the shortened time-frame of the film, suggesting that as little as a few months pass before Frodo and Sam leave Bag End for Rivendell rather than the seventeen years indicated by Tolkien.</i><br><br>They speculate that the timelapse was about a year, meaning sixteen years have been chopped out of the middle. That makes Aragorn older at the time of the B5A, and Frodo younger at the time of the War of the Ring. It means that only sixty-one years pass between the two events, rather than the canonical 77.<br><br>Which means that it&#39;s (just) possible for a normal mortal human to witness both. That&#39;s something close to what I&#39;m doing, but not quite.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve seen lots and lots of that archetype since I read lots of fantasy. If you&#39;re willing to throw yourself headfirst into a new continuum, I&#39;d recommend familiarising yourself with <i>Dragonlance</i>, then thinking about a <a href="http://dragonlancenexus.com/lexicon/index.php?title=Bozak_Draconian">Bozak Draconian</a> - but only if you can be very careful, as the Bozaks&#39; large amount of power requires careful management in order to avoid making your character a Sue or Stu.</p>

            <p>Of those three, I think that the Dresden Files one would be good. It&#39;s very expansive and has a lot of different niches for a character to fit in while still being well-defined and limited in a way that wouldn&#39;t make your characters Sueish.<br><br>However, it does tend to mess with technology, so a Dresden Files wizard would probably need special accommodations built into all their tech, and that&#39;s something that would need to be considered.</p>

            <p>My main advice is to pick a continuum you know really well.  Magic rules are frequently complex, and a poor grasp on them (especially their limitations) can make a character come off as Sueish, or just poorly developed.  Another thing to keep in mind is that unless they&#39;re doing a mission in their home continuum, your character probably won&#39;t be able to access their powers.  This can make for some interesting characterization moments.<br><br>I can&#39;t really comment on the other two you mentioned, but if you want a Dresdenverse wizard, I&#39;d recommend checking out the RPG.  It&#39;s got a lot of good setting information, as well as rules for creating a balanced character.  Remember, the majority of magic-users in the setting aren&#39;t good enough to qualify as wizards; if you don&#39;t want to get into the techbane aspects, lesser talents generally don&#39;t have them so much.  Also, don&#39;t just make your character a Harry clone (unless, of course, that&#39;s literally what he is!).<br><br>Other continuums to look at: <br><br>RPGs in general are a good choice because they typically feature a large range of options.  Pathfinder, in particular has some interesting variants that could make for a good agent - I can see a lot of interaction between a Haunted Oracle and the Laws of Narrative Comedy, for instance.  Either Mage: the Ascension or Mage: the Awakening has some interesting thematic parallels with the PPC, but remember, their partner will probably count as a Sleeper.<br><br>Personally, I&#39;m a Fate/Stay Night fan, and a Nasuverse magus would be an interesting character, but the setting in general tends to be very complicated.  I&#39;d only go for it if you feel very comfortable with it, but if you are, it&#39;d be a good choice.  Or maybe I just think Waver would make a good agent...</p>

            <p>I think you might be thinking about this in the wrong order. It seems like you&#39;re looking at the combat effectiveness of your agents first, rather than who they actually are. You&#39;ll have a much more well-rounded character if you figure out who they are and what they stand for before thinking about how they&#39;ll fare against a Sue. Remember, agents typically aren&#39;t warriors; they&#39;re normal people put into abnormal conditions and given a difficult task.</p>

            <p>My apologies if that came off as harsh. So... you&#39;d like a character to be a magic user? That&#39;s cool - we can work with that! So, first step is to figure what the continua - you&#39;ve named a few, which is great. I&#39;m not too familiar with the ones you&#39;ve named, so unfortunately I can&#39;t really help with that. However, I can help with making the character itself. Here&#39;s some questions to answer about the potential character:<br><br>- What level of mastery in magic has this person attained? How and where did they gain their expertise? Do they have a specialty?<br>- What kind of person are they? What are their strengths and shortcomings? Do they have any issues?<br>- How did they get to the PPC, and how would they react to things like technology?<br>- Morality. Are they willing to or have they already taken a life before? DMS agents in particular will be doing quite a lot of that.<br>- Backstory. Do they have any family or friends to go back to? Being a part of the PPC would mean that they effectively disappeared to those back home. What would happen because of that?<br><br>These are just a few aspects to look at. Remember, discover who they are, then build off of that!</p>

            <p>I am not familiar with the specific continua you mentioned, so my advice will also be a bit more general.  But one thing that has been mentioned a few times, I will mention again.  RPG&#39;s are great for using as a base.  By their nature they typically have fairly clear and well defined rules on magic.  If you do not want to go that route, here are some of my recommended approaches to the magic in general.<br><br>1.  Fullmetal Alchemist.  The alchemy is, in my opinion, a grey semi-magic-science thing.  But Arakawa (the mangaka) leaves the basics of alchemy pretty basic to understand.  There are some interesting facets with alchemy that would make it interesting to work with.<br><br>2.  Dragon Age:  Clear rules, that are fairly easy to understand, also has some interesting story lines you could work with.<br><br>3.  Based on you fandoms you mentioned in your introduction, you might also want to consider Bleach.  You would need to restrain them a bit, but that is beside the point for now.  But you could consider Kido, though I do not recall how well Kubo actually explains the inner workings of it.<br><br>Just my two cents.</p>

            <p>Yes, I am quite familiar with FMA, and using their Alchemy could be an interesting challenge. I have never played any <i>Dragon Age</i> games, so this would require a lot more research from me.<br><br>If I remember correctly, all you need to perform Kido is an incantation and enough amount of Spirit Energy. Anyway, I do have some experience in creating magic users, so I can give you a short description about the continua I&#39;ve mentioned:<br><br>Warlocks from <i>The Mortal Instruments</i> are usually the offspring of a mortal and a demon from Hell. They are not the only magic users in their continuum (the other species practicing magic openly are faeries), but they are probably the most numerous. They have characteristic markings on their body, which indicates their heritage (usually something connecting them to their demon parent - additional finger, horns, different skin colour, etc.). Warlocks are also immortal - but NOT unkillable. At a certain point, they just stop aging. There can be born warlocks with no magic powers (similar to Squibs from HP). The only problem with their magic is, it is too versatile - the Author didn&#39;t explain it enough, nor focused on its limitations. <br><br>Magic in <i>The Secrets of Immortal Nicolas Flamel</i> comes from an energy source called Aura - every human has a certain amount of it, in their bodies. The Aura can be activated through the ritual known as the Awakening - it can only be done by a selected few member of the Elder race (sort of god-like figures of the continuum). After the Awakening (which doesn&#39;t always work), the human is capable of learning magic. The most basic form is the Elemental Manipulation, which divides into well-known RPG categories: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth Magic. More advanced techniques involve Necromancy, Scrying, Shapeshifting, or - in extreme cases - Time Magic. The weakness I see here: Aura is used quite quickly, and there is a variety of creatures immune to it, or able to absorb it. Replenishing the Aura also takes quite some time, usually one day.<br><br>So, yeah - that&#39;s as far as I can tell you on spot. Which one seems better?</p>

            <p>I think the Nicolas Flamel is the better way to go.  The Warlocks seem like it is a bit too powerful, not saying it cannot be done, I would be wary of going that route.  Flamel seems like it can get a good balanced character, and especially if Aura is limited, it will allow a character that is defined by more than just their ability.  That&#39;s why I like the FMA approach, it is clearly defined, there are clear limits, and typical restrictions.  And I see a lot of interesting stories.  And that&#39;s the crux of it.  Ultimately it comes down to what ever will make the best story.  The only thing I will say is that the Warlocks look like they could be easily turned into a Sue, and Soul Reaper/Kido fall in the same place.<br><br>Ultimately go with whatever you think will make the most interesting character.  Or what ever you, as the author, want.</p>

            <p>A plothole <i>is</i> a deus ex machina. That is its function in PPC Origin Tales - an otherworldly device with no relevance other than to further the plot. Because origin/intro stories tend to be written without much more of a goal than introducing a new character to the PPC HQ, that&#39;s not usually a problem. But personally, I rather dislike them, on account of I&#39;m a curmudgeon who thinks we could stand to be more creative in our recruitment stories. There have been agents who filled out job applications; yours could stumble into an arcane website, a la Miss Cam, or accidentally interrupt a team of assassins on the hunt, or make their way into L-space while working on a last-minute book report, or any number of methods. <br><br>You don&#39;t <i>need</i> a Deus ex Machina.

            <p>That&#39;s pretty much how I ended up in HQ as well. Though in my case the plot hole was caused by a logical inconsistency (Skarmory weren&#39;t native to Unova, my region of birth, before Black 2 and White 2).<br><br>Alternatively, you could also have the character be bit in a badfic who was found by some agents and recruited.

            <p>You know, when I see bad stuff in fanfiction or even original works, I usually just cringe at the worst parts, chuckle at some of the (unintentionally) funny bits, and sometimes make snarky comments to myself regarding some awkwardly worded things...<br>But for the <i>really</i> bad writing, it&#39;s pretty much always the same reaction. Eyes wide open, gaping mouth, and sometimes even very faint screaming. For that fic... Well, try picturing me doing that while laughing. Because this is just ridiculous. 120% mission material for me, and if anyone thinks they and their agents can possibly stand PPCing that, go ahead, I&#39;m eager to read it!<br><br>(Also. While the &quot;blood test&quot; might stand on its own amongst the worst stuff I&#39;ve ever read in Harry Potter fanfiction (Disclaimer: I don&#39;t really read much Harry Potter fanfiction), the &quot;1 third Veela, 1 third Vampyre, 1 third Wizard&quot; bit... I mean, how does that even work? The <i>only</i> other time I&#39;ve seen that kind of stuff is in the Epic of Gilgamesh, and they didn&#39;t know anything about genetics back then.)</p>

            <p>If your eight great-grandparents consist of three Veela, three Vampyres, and two Wizards, and you can&#39;t be bothered quoting it in eighths, you could round them to &#39;thirds&#39;. (The simplest way this would work would be for three of your grandparents to be Veela/Vampyre half-breeds, and one to be a Wizard.

            <p>To: Headquarters &lt;PPC-HEADQUARTERS&gt;<br>From: The Board of Flowers &lt;sunflowerofficial.console.112358he132134an5589.rcA.DMS&gt;<br>Subject: Attn! Weapons Ban, Effective Immediately.<br><br>For the attention of all agents:<br><br>Greetings. It has come to the Board&#39;s attention that too many of you have gotten sloppy. There have been reports of gunpowder residue and shell casings in Middle-earth, bodies full of stab wounds surfacing in peaceful sea-side resorts, horrifically bloated canonical monsters everywhere, and a whole host of other complaints.<br><br>Therefore, we have no choice but to ban ALL WEAPONS. That&#39;s right, all of them. You heard us. Stop that whining right now.<br><br>You may use whatever assets you can get your hands on within a given continuum, but you are not to carry ANY into the field with you. That&#39;s final.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The Sunflower Official<br>Board of Flowers<br>April 1, 2015 HST </p>

<p><br>The agent hit &quot;Send&quot; and made a dash for the corridor. Her partner-in-crime was in full swing, waving her mace and shouting something about immoral and destructive no-fly zones. She could see Security Dandelions just rounding the corner.<br><br>&quot;Gall, it&#39;s done! Let&#39;s beat it!&quot;<br><br>Needing no further urging, the Viking dropped the act, and the pair of them took off away from the Dandelions, leaving a bewildered Sunflower Official behind.<br><br>&quot;&#39;Bout freaking time, Gremlin! I thought you were good with this electric stuff!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but it had to sound right, didn&#39;t it? Hacking is one thing; composing is another!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whatever.&quot; She dropped it and broke into a grin. &quot;Think they&#39;ll buy it?&quot;<br><br>Gremlin grinned back. &quot;I think I can hear the screams already.&quot;<br><br>The two shared a quick high-five and kept running until they found a safe place to hide from the riots.<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s an awesome bit. I also really like this narrative that keeps popping up of Gremlin and Gall hitting it off and being a couple of crude, fun-loving troublemakers. I am totally behind the idea of that being canon.</p>

            <p>A DOGA mission is received:<br><br><br>Abaddon frowned at the console. &quot;Er. T&#39;Zar?&quot;<br><br>The Vulcan looked up from the granola bar she was examining. &quot;Yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er,&quot; said the younger agent. He pointed at the console. &quot;We&#39;re... we&#39;re being called in.&quot;<br><br>T&#39;Zar put down the granola bar. &quot;What is our mission?&quot;<br><br>Abaddon grimaced. &quot;It&#39;s probably a mistake, really. We should lodge a complaint, or maybe just pass it on--&quot;<br><br>T&#39;Zar raised an eyebrow. &quot;For what reason?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; Abaddon said, and grimaced again. (It was mainly just wrinkling his nose, a move which his mother would have said was cute and which he would have described as perfectly adult and reasonable). &quot;It... well, our mission is to take down a Harry Potter Stu. And he&#39;s not a forest or anything, either.&quot;<br><br>T&#39;Zar raised her other eyebrow, and walked over to examine the console readout.<br><br>&quot;This is illogical,&quot; she said, once she had read it. &quot;We are agents of the Department of Geographical Aberrations, not the Department of Mary Sues.&quot; She straightened and turned towards Abaddon again. &quot;You are correct: we should lodge a complaint...&quot;<br><br>*<br>The Assassins react:<br><br><br>&quot;They can&#39;t <i>do</i> this to us!&quot; Brenda insisted. She had both hands clenched tight around her bow, as if someone might be about to take it away from her. &quot;We need weapons. We&#39;re<i>Assassins</i>!&quot;<br><br>Charlie made halfhearted soothing motions. &quot;Maybe--maybe it&#39;s a joke.&quot;<br><br>Brenda glared at her. &quot;Flowers don&#39;t joke. Which means that we&#39;re seriously going to have to go into a mission with <i>no weapons</i>. None. At all. Nothing but--&quot; she leaned in to read aloud from the message on their console &quot;--&#39;clothes, CADs, RAs, and a pen and paper&#39;.&quot; She shuddered, and gathered her quiver into what looked like a rather uncomfortable hug.<br><br>Charlie made a face, looking dubiously at the message. &quot;They--they do know we&#39;re not Agent Coulson, right? He might be able to take out robbers with some flour and hand-to-hand, but we&#39;re, well, not highly trained SHIELD agents.&quot;<br><br>Brenda scoffed. &quot;What training?&quot; She eyed the weapons in her arms, and then looked up, her expression growing more determined. &quot;Well, that settles it. You&#39;re right--we&#39;re not Agent Coulson. And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re going to march to the Flowers with, just as soon as we get together a mob...&quot;<br><br>---<br>So yeah. That&#39;s what happens: DOGA gets confused and lodges a complaint; and the Assassins rebel and decide to get up a mob, because they are not Agent Coulson and would generally have trouble taking out Sues by being very creative. (I mean, I&#39;m sure they could manage it, especially if the realize they can probably borrow canonical weapons or else raid a canonical armory, but I can&#39;t see them taking well to the change...)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>But after a while, the agents would logically figure out a recurring source of weaponry for a specific canon, and it would turn into to just saying &quot;Alice stole Legolas&#39; bow again and...&quot;  Even if you use a different source every time, it&#39;s hard to come up with a completely different way to write what&#39;s essentially the same thing.  Sure, missions tend to be formulaic by default, but that doesn&#39;t mean they need to be even more so.<br><br>And that&#39;s assuming a canon with ready access to weapons in interesting situations (i.e., belonging to a canon character).  Sure, there&#39;s <i>probably</i> somewhere armed police officers in that slice-of-life anime, but a scene where the agents portal in and steal a gun isn&#39;t going to fit neatly into the story.  That&#39;s without getting into more complex situations, like Potterverse stuff - can agents properly use a wand if they just nick it off the owner?  Do they have to wrestle them for it?  And how do they get ownership to transfer back to the canon character afterwards?<br><br>Plus, I&#39;m not entirely sure agents <i>would</i> steal canon weapons.  Personally, if weapons were banned, I&#39;d just have my characters do a little more Thinking With Portals.<br><br>It&#39;d be interesting to see an agent cope without their weapons, but there are a variety of ways to engineer that situation that don&#39;t involve massively altering the workings of the PPC.</p>

            <p>I sure hope my DIC missions haven&#39;t become boring and formulaic just because my characters don&#39;t have an arsenal at their disposal and often have to think on their feet when there are Suvians involved.

            <p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with not having your characters use weapons!  Nor is having them use weapons necessarily original.  That wasn&#39;t the point.

            <p>Your detanglers don&#39;t use weapons a whole lot because their job is to get continua, well, detangled. If a Sue happens to pop up, they deal with it to the best of their ability. Same as with bad slashers.<br><br>For Floaters and assassins, though, you&#39;d (hopefully) want them to at least have a weapon at their disposal because they have the most Sues to kill. But I like to have my agents use weapons either a)when nothing appropriately ironic presents itself for an assassination or b)when I want to make a particularly anticlimactic death, which can be just as funny in its own right. <br><br>Basically, though, if you&#39;re planning on killing stuff, you don&#39;t go in without the means to do so.</p>

            <p>Why the &quot;much rejoicing&quot;, you ask? I&#39;d tell you, but it&#39;ll spoil the fun. Let&#39;s just say that I haven&#39;t put Falchion&#39;s team to use in a good long while, and this was something I&#39;ve been meaning to do for a <i>very</i> long time. What is it, you may ask? Well, find out for yourselves in...<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IxBxWurMG1m0Z_dzkeronH-kMej81s4Qvq32dSz38M/edit?usp=sharing">&quot;Don&#39;t Fear the Reaper&quot;</a><br><br>And just so I don&#39;t bump off threads from the front page,  and in light of a certain event from this latest mission, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask a little something. We have <i>SO</i> many characters recruited from missions and such, so I was thinking... Would it be worth making an Adoptables page on the Wiki so people who browse it can claim them? Some of the characters I&#39;ve seen agents pick up seem to be too good to go to waste, and if anyone wants to see more of them, they could pick up these characters and write them for themselves.<br><br>IDK, this idea may be a side-effect of me recruiting a lot of characters, but I think it could work out pretty well if we can manage it right. Your thoughts, guys?</p>

            <p>To be fair, TV Tropes DOES label it as a troll fic. I can&#39;t be sure of that either, though, since I get the sense that the content would&#39;ve needed to be even more inflammatory if that was the case. Either way, well, Dark is dead now, so I can&#39;t possibly care less. XD<br></p>

            <p>Short answer: who knows?<br><br>Long answer: Who knows? Bowers don&#39;t fossilise, and don&#39;t require particular evolutionary traits. <i>Velociraptor</i> was basically a murderchicken, so it was birdlike enough to have <i>possibly</i> built one. I don&#39;t know that being a predator would impact that either way - does hunting animals somehow make you less liable to construction work than hunting fruit?<br><br>On the other hand: bowerbirds are, according to Wikipedia, pretty unique. They&#39;re isolated to one geographical area. It is <i>not</i> a common trait among modern dinosaurs - so it&#39;s unlikely it was among Mesozoic dinosaurs, either.<br><br>On the third hand: I seem to recall that <a href="http://irregularbooks.co/">All Your Yesterdays</a>, the free, online sequel to the stunning paleoart book <i>All Yesterdays</i>, includes a picture called &#39;bower tyrants&#39;, presumably of bower-building tyrannosaurs. So there&#39;s that. ^_^ (AYY is the third entry on the page; AY itself is the second, and you can google up a lot of pictures from it. I know nothing about <i>Cryptozoologicon</i>.)<br><br>hS </p>

            <p>Yeah, the bower was a speculative thing. I always figured it would be less sophisticated than a specific pattern of objects, though. I think the &quot;bower&quot; would be more akin to a hunter&#39;s trophy wall than an interior designer&#39;s exhibition like what a modern bowerbird would make. The more prey remains are on display, the more successful the owner is at hunting, and therefore the more fit he is for breeding.<br><br>If only I had a stable income, All Yesterdays would be really high on the list of books I&#39;d buy. From what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s an amazing collection of speculative palaeo-art, and the restorations of modern animals using the outdated trends of dinosaur media are also hilariously disturbing.<br><br>P.S. Ripper&#39;s a <i>Deinonychus</i>, by the way. Just FYI. XD</p>

            <p>Buck moved around the Aura Pokémon, who turned on the spot to hide his face from the probing Skiddo. &quot;Did Zeb actually knock some <i>humility</i> into you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not humility,&quot; growled Owen, suppressing the urge to shout. &quot;Stop prying.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh. What is it then? Humiliation? Respect for others? Something that might make you less of an ass?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Final warning. Stop prying.&quot; bolts of Aura crackled around Owen&#39;s paws. Oblivious or unintimidated, Buck continued.<br><br>&quot;Go on,&quot; said Buck, getting into a ready position in preparation for what was coming next. &quot;Tell me that he took you down a notch or two. You needed that, you pompous bullying turd--&quot;<br><br>Owen howled and swung an arm at Buck, who ducked under the blow and headbutted the Lucario right under his chest spike. Owen was knocked to the ground, wheezing, and Buck retreated a few paces back. The pair silently stared at each other in silence for a few seconds before dashing forward and colliding again-- again, Owen was sent flying back. He landed hard on his back but pushed himself up as quickly as he could just in time to be body slammed by Buck. <br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve gone soft!&quot; said Buck as he disengaged. &quot;Did Zeb <i>break</i> you or something?&quot;<br><br>Owen howled again and sprinted forward, this time managing to land a solid kick on Buck&#39;s flank. Something <i>cracked</i> in the Skiddo&#39;s chest area. The winded Skiddo stumbled around and Owen took advantage of the opening to blast Buck with an Aura Sphere. Buck was sent flying back a couple of metres backwards, landed hard, and rolled to a stop in the grass. Before Owen could cross the distance between him and his partner a dark blur leapt out of the grass and clawed at his him, hissing savagely. The Lucario yelled in surprise and grabbed Tacitus with both paws, spun, and threw the Zorua away in one fluid motion. &quot;Stay out of this! This isn&#39;t your fight!&quot; yelled Owen. <br><br>Meanwhile, Buck had found his footing again and faced Owen. He pawed the ground with a hoof, ready to charge. &quot;It&#39;s about time somebody taught you a lesson, Owen,&quot; said Buck. &quot;You became absolutely insufferable ever since we came here. I don&#39;t remember you being this unpleasant in Kalos. What happened?&quot;<br><br>Owen adopted a ready stance. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t understand, Buck.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Try me. You think I&#39;m stupid, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, you certainly look the part.&quot;<br><br>Buck yelled incoherently and charged. Owen dashed forward to meet him.<br><br>* * * <br><br>Meryem was dragged out of her conversation with the strange woman by the sound of fighting. She looked around and saw Buck toss Owen into the air with a powerful headbutt.<br><br>&quot;Oh, what the hell.&quot;</p>

It&#39;s totally my fault and I shouldn&#39;t have let them out of my sight.&quot;<br><br>A portal opened nearby, letting through a Gardevoir, a Jolteon, and a tall brown-haired man with glasses. The trio approached Meryem, who promptly handed over Buck and Owen to the man. &quot;I don&#39;t know what happened. One minute they were fine, the next they were beating the tar out of each other.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you, Meryem,&quot; said Benoît. &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s go and find out what happened. Victoria, Maxwell, can you question these two?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; said Maxwell and Victoria as their human colleagues walked off to the side. Victoria presented the Assassins with a badge pulled out of the bulletproof vest she wore. &quot;Officers Victoria and Maxwell, DIA Patrol. We&#39;d like to know what happened here.&quot; </p>

            <p>&quot;So... you mauled him to a KO while he couldn&#39;t move?&quot; The Gardevoir shifted uncomfortably in her bulletproof vest. &quot;I bet he took his kevlar off, too. What an idiot...&quot; She rubbed her eyes. &quot;It&#39;s... difficult to describe what happened to Owen. He became very, very different when we started woking here. More... aggressive. Snappy. I used to be his confidant, you know. And now he hardly ever speaks to me anymore.&quot; She looked over her shoulder, where Meryem and Benoît had let Buck out of his Poké Ball and were talking to him. &quot;Did either of them get hurt?

He bowed his head as a greeting and wrote a message for the Jolteon.<br><br>&quot;Ever heard of narcissism?

            <p>&quot;Um, if you&#39;re not going to see the people that can help you, then how are you going to get better? I don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s like breaking a leg but, like, not wanting to see the doctor because you don&#39;t trust them,&quot; said the Jolteon. &quot;And then your leg is still busted and it might <i>look</i> healed on the outside but inside it&#39;s too weak to let you walk and then you stumble around everywhere and you avoid doing anything physical because of your gimp leg and then you develop this weird lifestyle where everything is based on avoiding stress on your leg and you can&#39;t live without thinking about your leg because it&#39;s just taken over your entire life and--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Enough, Maxwell. She understands,&quot; said Victoria. &quot;But...&quot; The Gardevoir turned to Rina. &quot;He has a point. You won&#39;t get better on your own.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;It&#39;s not that I can&#39;t,&quot; she whispered, drawing her knees to her chest. &quot;I won&#39;t. I won&#39;t go back.

You can&#39;t make me!&quot; <br><br>&quot;That&#39;s it.&quot; Zeb sat down on his haunches and swatted Rina around the head with his tail. &quot;You won&#39;t listen to me, and you aren&#39;t listening to them.

Please!&quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>((Your broken leg analogy is wonderful, and I just wish more people saw mental illness like that. I think part of the reason I resisted therapy for so long when I was younger was because I didn&#39;t want the stigma attached to it. And it&#39;s why people don&#39;t get the help they need. I just hope this attitude toward mental illnesses can be changed.<br><br>And yeah. Rina&#39;s been on the edge of snapping for a while, and Rose just pushed her a little bit closer. One more thing like that could send her over. Thing is, though? At the point in her life where her experiences and mine diverged, we hadn&#39;t yet realized therapy is a good thing. I learned it.

Please ask Madam to compile a list of FicPsych&#39;s best for Agent Dives&#39; perusal. We&#39;re going to give her all the tools and encouragement she needs-- but the choice is hers.

Pretty please?&quot; He said as he used Baby-Doll Eyes on Rina.<br><br>- - - <br><br>((I actually based it off a girl I knew who broke a leg in 11th grade. She had a cast and crutches and everything and was instructed to not put any weight on her foot for many, many months. She decided that she didn&#39;t need to listen to the doctor&#39;s advice and stopped coming to school with crutches after a month. Towards the end of the year she didn&#39;t need the cast anymore-- but her leg didn&#39;t seem to have healed properly and she walked with a limp. Permanent damage caused by poor decision making-- don&#39;t fall for it, guys.))</p>

            <p>There was definitely something off about Rina but the Gardevoir couldn&#39;t put her finger on it. She went &quot;hm&quot; and looked at Tacitus, who had repositioned himself behind Rina. He quickly wrote &quot;Honest?&quot; on his notepad and showed it to Victoria.

Basically, he has blue pants, a red shirt with a yellow circle on the front and a random space helmet. Even HE has no clue why he has it.

If you want our feedback, the actual description straightaway.<br><br>As for the details you&#39;ve presented, I&#39;m not particularly enthused so far. &quot;Random&quot; is a questionable character trait at best; whenever I&#39;ve seen it used in the past, it&#39;s been in an attempt to justify &quot;LOL so wacky&quot; actions that are less comedic and more annoying. &quot;Easily bored&quot; and &quot;gets mad when fandoms are messed with&quot; are better, but could be used to describe a plethora of currently active agents.<br><br>I&#39;m also confused about his being from &quot;modded <i>Minecraft</i>.&quot; I&#39;m not sure where exactly mods fit into the mythos of the PPC (a phrase which I&#39;m sure some people will groan at). Is every mod for every game supposed to be its own little sub-universe? Are mods supposed to be treated like fics? There&#39;s also the issue that <i>Minecraft</i> doesn&#39;t really have any characters besides the player (Steve?/Alex?). Where did this person come from? Were they something that occurred in the world (like a villager or an Enderman - we have one of those already) or explicitly from a badfic/goodfic, I would have an easier time buying the premise. But a mod? I don&#39;t know.<br><br>To sum up, nothing about this character is really leaving much of an impression on me. I&#39;d recommend putting some more work into him. Come up with another version.</p>

            <p>I do not think you need to exactly start that way, it obviously makes it easier starting with a personality, but in my opinion even a name is a sufficient place to start.  Every writer&#39;s process is a little bit different, if the writer wants to start with just a physical description and a vague backstory, that is their right to do so.  Now it is hard to give an opinion on a character if that is all you have.</p>

            <p>Lemme disagree with both what I&#39;ve said earlier and what you say.<br>It&#39;s OK not to start with the personality, but the personality is the make-or-break part of the character. Let&#39;s take Agent Navare for an example: he&#39;s a bit military officer rescued from a bleepfic. That means he had a couple of things already set in stone, so to speak, before I came around and decided to expand the character - he&#39;s an officer, he&#39;s a Nanohaverse mage, he can hold his own in battle (but not more than that). However, the thing that will decide whether he&#39;s an interesting character, a good character, or a cardboard-flat Gary Stu (and with people with power sets like his - the Nanohaverse is up there on the block-destroying power levels end of the scale - it&#39;s very easy) is his personality, not his powers, or his status as a mage, or whatnot.<br><br>(I hope this is clear because it looks a bit ramble-y to me.)</p>

            <p>Personality, though I think you might be a bit broad in your definition of it, is what ultimately fills out a character.  All I was saying is one need not start with it, but every character needs to develop a personality or else they just aren&#39;t worth reading.  But in my opinion, when creating/drafting a character that is not the only way to begin a character.  </p>

            <p>Here&#39;s a quick rundown of the story. Simply put, the tale goes that there&#39;s a fantasy world called Pantheonia, where there live the Lords and Ladies of Nature, who keep the world in balance. But greed for power overcomes the Lord of the Dead, who demands sacrifices to double his power. Why sacrifices and not outright killings? Well sacrificing is kind of like an express delivery system for souls to the gods. Sacrificing doesn&#39;t happen often prior to this, but when it happens, it&#39;s usually one at a time.<br><br>Anyways, it&#39;s up to six heroes: Embros the Fierce, Tonya Strong, Gnarl the Toothful, Buzzard of Meredith, Bailey &quot;The Billy&quot; Bob and our main character Percy Plymouth to stop the lord of the dead from overthrowing the other Lords and Ladies.</p>

            <p>Are both banned from Balanced Hackmons. When I use one, I use a Rock Head one with Head Smash, Wood Hammer, Flare Blitz, and Volt Tackle. Other options include a Parental Bond set with Diamond Storm, Sacred Fire, Icicle Crash, and Bolt Strike, and a Contrary set with V-Create, Superpower, Stone Edge, and Hyperspace Fury. That last one&#39;s a very useful move, since it boosts your Defence AND ignores Protect, Detect, and similar moves.</p>

            <p>Fantastic job with the dialogue, by the way. The pseudo-German was absolutely hilarious,and the Doktor&#39;s commentary combined with Gabrielle&#39;s &quot;I-don&#39;t-know-what&#39;s-going-on-but guess-I&#39;ll-try&quot; thing really tied it all together. Great work! </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been going to my hometown con, Emerald City Comic Con, pretty much every year. It&#39;s a good show!<br><br>Best story: A couple of years ago, they had many voice actor guests... and so they did a late-night panel reading of the Empire Strikes Back script... with each actor reading parts with character voices. We had Darth Pinkie Pie sassing with... dangit, I&#39;ve forgotten who played Leia for that scene. Bender was hilarious, and swore like a sailor (as you know he has always wanted to.)<br><br>Other best story: Gender. Neutral.

            <p>I&#39;ve only been to one convention (the same one Iximaz mentioned, incidentally enough!) and it was a blast. I went with my sister and her husband, and we had just enough time to make some basic costumes. I went as Inspector Gadget, my sister went as Carmen Sandiego, and my brother-in-law was Waldo. As it turns out, Insepctor Gadget had a MUCH larger fan base than I expected, and people kept wanting to hug me or take pictures every few feet or so. We were able to get into the Karen Gillian panel just before it filled up, so that was pretty cool as well. The whole thing was tiring, but in a good way! I would love to go to another one sometime.</p>

            <p>I have yet to go to a convention and be bored (other than standing in line to get into a panel, but even that&#39;s fun because you can turn to literally any random stranger and find something in common to talk about).<br><br>The most recent one I went to was last year, I think, when Matt Smith and Karen Gillan were in Louisville. Smith even did the drunken giraffe dance in his panel, t&#39;was awesome. <br><br>The con just got better when it came time for the costume contest: the three best were definitely a one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater, Ruby Rose from RWBY (giant scythe and all), and a Dalek that was built around a motorized wheelchair so it actually rolled places. The best part is that one of the judges looked straight-up like David Tennant (and was cosplaying Ten for the whole con, nice guy) and the Dalek flipped out when it saw him, screaming &quot;DOC-TOR! DOC-TOR! EX-TERM-INATE!&quot;<br><br>I always, always cosplay Harry Potter on Saturday, but Friday and Sunday alternate between Fluttershy and steampunk. None of my costumes are impressive enough to win any contests, though I&#39;m very pleased with my Potter costume. My mother, on the other hand, is nearly done with her fiberglass-and-paper Iron Man suit; all that&#39;s left is wiring the electronics. She&#39;s even more excited for our next con than I am, and that&#39;s saying a lot!</p>

Mind you, I don&#39;t agree that slaughtering a bunch of people is the solution—and that being the case, I find it rather confusing that the good guys solve <i>their</i> problem by, uh, slaughtering a bunch of people. However, I really don&#39;t like that they ridiculed the whole issue throughout the film, and I also really don&#39;t like the fact that Valentine was portrayed as a silly, lisping fop.

            <p>Chose to portray Valentine like that.  From what I remember, he felt that certain groups, I believe he used handicapped in his interview, needed to show that they could actually be brilliant Bond Villain types, so he chose the Lisp to demonstrate that.  Regardless, I think it worked.  It just added to the sense of absurdity that the entire film was.  Everything was so over the top in the film, that I found it all hilarious.  </p>

            <p>My problem isn&#39;t that he&#39;s a weak villain-character. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. My problem is that the bad guy is assigned the following traits:<br><br>- Eccentric<br>- Black<br>- Lisping<br>- Squeamish<br>- Environmentalist<br><br>Because he&#39;s the bad guy, these things are cast as Other, Outsider, Not Good.<br><br>Meanwhile, the good guys we&#39;re supposed to root for and identify with have these contrasting traits:<br><br>- Polite society<br>- White<br>- Well-spoken<br>- Fearless<br>- Didn&#39;t they refer to that one environmental scientist as a crackpot or something? And apparently Obama-analogue and a whole bunch of other people deserved to have their heads blown off, and we were supposed to laugh and cheer about it? <i>What?</i><br><br>Also, I have no idea how I&#39;m supposed to feel about Colin Firth murdering all those conservative/fundamentalist Christians in their church. Was I supposed to be okay with that because they were horrible people and Colin Firth is a badass and it wasn&#39;t really his fault, or was I <i>not</i> supposed to be okay with it because killing is wrong and/or killing Christians who hate gays is even more wrong?

            <p>Are you saying that all villains are always going to be as you said, Other, Outsider, and Not Good?  Therefore any traits said villain have are those same?  If that&#39;s the case it seems then you would have a problem with any minority villain then.  <br><br>As to the other point, the head blowing off, in my opinion is one of those instances where it crosses the line twice.  Campy music and all.  And if you do not like the result, if anything it goes back to the old Hays Code of the 30&#39;s.  Basically part of it was that villains would get what was coming to them.  And for a group of people that thought getting the vast majority of the world&#39;s population to kill each other, that seems acceptable.  And the Environmentalist, they were referring to the one scientist who believed that Humans were a virus and Global Warming was the Earth&#39;s way of taking care of it.  Not all environmentalists.  But I won&#39;t even get into that.<br><br>As to the Church, well (trying to be polite here) was absolutely vile.  Now does that mean its acceptable to kill them, of course not.  But it almost seems you have the problem with the violence itself.  And there really isn&#39;t much I can say about that.  Except it happens.<br><br>Now correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that your problems are with the following.<br><br>1.  Black Villain<br>2.  Upper-class White Hero<br>3.  Violence<br><br>And really I cannot say much without sounding offensive, so I will do exactly what you expect.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ugebzq3juE"> It&#39;s just a movie </a>.  And frankly I think you are reading far too much into it.  If anything I see it as the film makers and the writer saying the following.<br><br>1.  Environmentalists who think that killing the majority of the World&#39;s Population is the way to stop climate change are both idiotic and bad.<br><br>2.  James Bond like spies are cool, and generally save the day, though sometimes not in nice ways.<br><br>3.  Things that are Hate Groups masquerading as churches are vile things.<br><br>Just a question, would you find it as problematic if it was a White Villain with the same motives, a non-white hero, and the KKK or Nazis instead of the church?  I am just trying to see what the route problem you have with the film is.</p>

            <p>Re. Valentine, the problem is that there&#39;s a <i>large trend</i> in film for villains to be assigned traits such as the ones I mentioned. By itself it might not mean anything, but looking at it in the broader context of film and society, it&#39;s part of a problem. I hoped the Sissy Villain TV Tropes article would explain this—did you read it?<br><br>Re. the church, that scene was really what took me out of the movie, IIRC. I had to stop and ask myself whose side I was supposed to be on. On the one hand, killing people is horrible, and so is forcing people to kill each other; point to the Kingsmen. On the other hand, that church was really horrible, too, and Valentine, it seems, represents the sort of progressive liberal viewpoint I&#39;d normally identify with, sans the whole &quot;kill them all&quot; thing. But Valentine wasn&#39;t always a villain... he was pushed over the edge by all the people like those churchfolk who refuse to bloody listen because science is the devil, not to mention corrupt world governments who can&#39;t or won&#39;t do anything because big business won&#39;t let them. Point to Valentine.<br><br>So, basically, my main problem is that ideologically/politically, I&#39;m on Valentine&#39;s side, and I even sympathize with the frustration that pushed him to his extreme actions—just look at how this very film paints environmentalists as extremist nutjobs and you telling me how silly I am for letting it bother me. That&#39;s the kind of bullshit we&#39;re up against in the real world, why achieving real, impactful change is like pulling teeth. My only reservation is that I can&#39;t support a &quot;kill them all&quot; approach. And then the &quot;good guys&quot; go and do exactly that, too, which leaves me high and dry with no one to root for. {= /<br><br>I was trying not to make this about politics, but it is.

            <p>I did not think so much that it painted all environmentalists as lunatics, just the one who thought the solution was to kill &#39;em all.  And as for the trend, I have not noticed it.  Though I do not watch a great many movies.  I think part of what the problem is, in the source all of Valentine&#39;s Villain traits were folded into Dr. Arnold.  For the film they split that off and created a new character.<br><br>And I do not know about your area, but in mine environmentalists as a whole (excepting Greenpeace) have made substantial gains.  IF your problem really was about politics, then I will not say anymore.  I never meant to offend if I did.    </p>

            <p>And sorry if I&#39;m a bit jumpy. When people have strong feelings about things, as I do about this, that tends to summon as if by magic other people with strong feelings to argue their side, and then the fur flies.<br><br>The general feeling about environmentalists and climate change here in the US, or at least what I hear the most, tends to be along the lines of &quot;OMG, you stupid liberal hippie tree-huggers, how dare you try to tell people how to live their lives and stop businesses from making money as is their right? Do you hate freedom or something? Actually, let&#39;s not even use the words &#39;global warming&#39; or &#39;climate change&#39; anymore.

            <p>Where in the US are you?  I am in Oil and Gas Country, and we see the risks of it.  And acknowledge that certain things need to change.  Now in my neck of the woods it is usually switch to natural gas and get rid of coal.  Heck even Oil and Gas Companies are diversifying.  As for the Windmill problem, NIMBY is a huge problem world wide.  </p>

            <p>To be honest, I don&#39;t know much about what&#39;s going on locally. I do see some buildings with solar panels and little wind turbines, which is awesome, and there&#39;s the public transit system and bikers, and in recent years we were approached by a company providing green(er) energy to offset the usual sources used by ComEd. It&#39;s not <i>all</i> bad.<br><br>At the same time, though, there&#39;s still a ridiculous number of people who drive in the city, and the huge consumption of electricity which is powered by not-so-green sources, and the general apathy of your average person, plus the national political climate. My building doesn&#39;t even have recycling. {= / And, living near the Great Lakes most of my life, I hear about what bottled water is up to and constant attempts by drier states to build pipelines and siphon them off.<br><br>... Maybe my real problem is that I don&#39;t have the courage to become an activist, so I&#39;m not in touch with whatever progress is happening. The news likes to fixate on the negative, so that&#39;s what I hear the most. I just try to do the little things I can in my daily life, and it feels pretty hopeless that way.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who sure can talk a lot, sheesh.</p>

            <p>There is substantial resistance in Coal Country, particularly Eastern Coal Country like Illinois (the coal has a higher sulfur content and is worse for the environment).  It is not surprising then, because the one thing agreed upon, is that Coal needs to be drastically cut, if not phased out all together.  So now I understand why that view prevails in your area.  Basically in order to make substantial gains against global warming etc., the Coal industry needs to basically cease to exist.<br><br>And I know for a fact that the State of Illinois has pushed back hard against the Federal Government for trying to change to Rocky Mountain Coal, so now I understand.  From what I understand nationwide though, that tends to be the minority view.  And it creates some strange bedfellows.  Big Oil and Gas Companies agreeing with Environmentalists for example.  That&#39;s part of what I am seeing in Louisiana/Texas Region.  The big rhetoric here is basically Coal is bad, and we should switch to Natural Gas until renewable sources are more efficient.  Then again those companies plan on using Natural Gas indefinitely.<br><br>If it is not clear, my own views are hybridized.  I see climate change as a real problem, though I personally think that harms are overstated.  I think Coal is the largest offender.  Technology marches forward so vehicle emissions are not as severe as a problem as the 80 year old Coal Plants, which have predominately been grandfathered into the Clean Air Act Regime with basically the same highly polluting technology.  Frankly I am all for Nuclear Power, I think the rare accidents get too much focus.  See now when they get brought up you will hear, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima, etc.  and they fail to realize that these incidents are incredibly rare, and with the exception of Chernobyl relatively minor.  A Natural Gas plant going up would cause the same damage.  Chernobyl is the exception, but that is largely because the Soviets just wanted to cover it up, so it kept leaking for longer than it ever should have.<br><br>Then you get into NIMBY issues, and that really hamstrings the industry.  Radioactive waste just sits there, because Nevada refused to let the Yucca Mountain plan go into effect.  Then Reid and the Senate killed the program dead just a year or two ago.  Then you have Maine who did not want to put offshore wind platforms because it made the view worse.  And then you have things like States just not wanting Nuclear Power (Vermont/New York) and basically close plants down forcing at least heavy temporary reliance on Coal (and more likely than not Eastern Coal, due to efficiency), which actually makes the problem worse.  That does not even take into account efficiency issues with Solar and Wind Power.  <br><br>But the political climate itself, it isn&#39;t that they are not resistant to change, its just many of the Republicans are looking for softer measures, like Cap and Trade, where many of the Democrats seem to want to do something like what Germany is doing now.  Quit Cold Turkey.  Now the polarization further complicates issues.  The President does not really want to negotiate with Republicans, they do not really want to negotiate with him either.  Then that does not include the fact that Senators Reid and McConnell really only talk at the 11th Hour.  Then there is also the fact that right now the Tea Party has either forced out or paralyzed the Moderate Republicans, so the House cannot even work in their own party.  No side really wants to compromise, but to be fair, part of that problem was related what then Minority Republicans saw as abuse of power, so Congress did exactly what it was designed to do in those instances, it became Gridlocked.  And unfortunately we are now in the stage where no one really wants to give.  Which is why, if anything gets done it&#39;s at the 11th Hour.  And now the problem is the relationship between the President and Republicans in Congress is so sour, that the odds of anything of significance getting done is next to zero until there is a new President is elected, but if it ends up being Ms. Clinton, the gridlock will probably continue until the next Congressional Elections.  The bottom line the relationship between current Republican and current Democratic leadership is terrible, and not likely to change anytime soon.<br><br>This wound up being far longer than I expected.  So the TLDR version is basically:<br><br>The situation is a mess, I personally though do not think it is quite as severe a problem as is implied.  Coal Country  is very resistant to any Green House Gas regulation because it will basically obliterate an important industry that traditionally has been protected by those States, and the country is moving (albeit slowly) towards cleaner fuel, though the technology is not quite there yet.  One last point, always treat US News sources with skepticism.  All of them are biased.  Ones like Fox are clearly biased, but even CNN, MSNBC, and the like do have substantial biases, they are just a lot more subtle than Fox is.  <br><br>~[EvilAI]UBEROverlord, who can talk quite a bit more, and is probably clearly preparing for an Environmental Law Final and an Energy Regulation Final, but is glad he did not start citing cases, because then this would have gone on for another 30 pages.  And also does not intend to offend anyone. </p>

            <p>Which implied that the more established (i.e. big) baronies worked under a manorial system, i.e. peasants everywhere, tied to the land, the local minor nobles and knights keeping them safe from bandit depredations and occasionally mustering them for raids upon the Marizu. Y&#39;know, boggo late-medieval economic structure.<br><br>However, because the barony Iximaz has is very land-poor, and she&#39;s got raids to conduct, all that money&#39;s gotta come from somewhere. What we&#39;re seeing is rapid urbanization around Critta-Kalthin as peasants flock to her banner - because why wouldn&#39;t they? She&#39;s a war hero, and wealthy with it. CK&#39;s the place for a young man to seek his fortune, joining the new guilds of merchants and becoming a seafarer, or hell, even becoming one of her privateers and raiding Marizu vessels to protect the trade coming in through the great port. So there are less peasants about the borders, which makes life harder for the remaining peasants, which means more of them leave, which means the local nobles start hoovering up peasants, which means more can see the riches of CK, which means more leave, and here we are again. Urbanization. It happens. Critta-Kalthin&#39;s not been around long and it&#39;s already a major trading port, easily the equal of Venice or Amsterdam in scope. And that finances the Baroness&#39;s wars, so she has a vested interest in improving her cash flow.<br><br>Actually, the more I think about it, the more the Amsterdam comparison makes sense. It&#39;s a tiny, soggy, coastal outpost of a much larger empire (Borrd itself being analogous to Spain in this regard, though Phobos might be a better comparison), recently independent, land poor, dependent on wealth from afar and its trade fleets to survive. Add in someone being assassinated with an early pistol and you&#39;ve basically got the Netherlands under William the Silent.<br><br>I&#39;m just waiting for Critta to start bodging together some polders and big up the tulip trade. =]</p>

            <p>Actually, the main assumption is that the big baronies count as &#39;more established&#39;. ;) Barony hS is practically empty, Barony Phobos has no population centres other than the remnants of Odolotos, Barony Araeph is mostly sheep, and Barony Cassie is mostly cows.<br><br>But yes, you&#39;re probably along the right lines, at least in Borrd - including the influence of CK. Wechi... is probably along the same lines, except (due to being a Commonwealth) rather kinder to the peasants. The Republic of Iric is... mostly just La Wunj (and I have a massive proposal for when June comes round), so is basically living off trade. Ozerbord, again, is probably along the same rough lines, with the twin quirks that the population is really low, and the whole place has a bit of a military bent.<br><br>(Also, Iximaz has privateers now?

            <p>France has an extraordinarily low population density and survived on a similar system until 1789, during which certain events took place with which you may be familiar. =]<br><br>You&#39;re looking at this from a modern economic perspective, and that&#39;s... not the way to do it, frankly. You don&#39;t need a lot of population centres to work under manorial economics, just villages interspersed with market towns. Big cities around a palace take a lot of money, so of course there&#39;s going to be trade. Also, don&#39;t knock cattle and sheep. Livestock&#39;s one of the biggest and most powerful trade exports in medieval Europe, which I admit to basing this off. As for sheep, well, the history of the Woolsack should be enough reason why they&#39;re important, but England wasn&#39;t the only place where this was true; broadcloth trade was huge in medieval Europe, centred around Flanders and Leiden. Sheep are also good because they can be grazed in places where arable farming ain&#39;t viable, which is why rural Wales has a, er, <i>reputation</i> in that regard.<br><br>(also fyi in 1938 they rebuilt the woolsack with wool from all over the commonwealth and brushed under the carpet the fact that previously it&#39;d been stuffed with horsehair and avoid a national scandal)<br><br>Also, Commonwealth or not, Wechi&#39;s still more than likely going to be operating on a manorial basis, simply because they&#39;re land rich. Mei&#39;n Payj is probably going to support some trade, but a lot of it? Farmable. Hence the manorial system.<br><br>Iric, well, again, look at France. Vast tracts of land, haha, and most of it good for farming, especially near La Wunj. River landscapes often are. France is a good analogy, actually, because La Wunj is like Paris - wide rivers suitable for trade barges and it&#39;s on the Nechsiv route to the sea. If there was a better port at the mouth of the Nechsiv, it&#39;d be the main city, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s obvious that La Wunj, while possibly a little faded, is still an incredibly wealthy city with trade effectively by appointment. Therefore, it&#39;s being supported by the rest of the Barony Dann and other bits in the Republic.<br><br>Ozerborrd, I can&#39;t really tell that much about except that if Skypcht wasn&#39;t a thing, you&#39;d be a lot poorer than everyone else in Konti-nyuum. Hill farming&#39;s the order of the day here, which means more sheep, but you don&#39;t have any water links to the rest of the island, which means no river trade for you - and that means you have to rely on mountain passes for trade, which must be a barrel of laughs.<br><br>I accept that this is total conjecture on my part, but it&#39;s at least reasonably informed conjecture. And you still get urbanization in areas where there&#39;s a low population density - look at Paris. Last time, I promise. The surrounding countryside is, er, countryside. French peasant folk, their livestock, and, er, not much of anything else. You&#39;ve got the land. You&#39;ve got people working it. You&#39;ve got towns and villages and hamlets and everything else you covered in Geography class. Yes, they&#39;re probably small, but they&#39;re there, and they deserve more than just being to be ignored while the nobles plot their latest raid.<br><br>I also admit that I&#39;m basing this on the real world, and you&#39;ve got a clockpunk Laputa hanging over Des&#39;s little enclave, so I might be barking up the wrong tree a bit. =]</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;d be great if you&#39;d write up Cyclopaedia articles on the economics of Plort, actually - having the system at least sketched out in concrete form would be brilliant.<br><br>Some purely random comments:<br><br>-By &#39;mostly cows&#39; (Barony Cassie) I meant it literally. The only knight to set up shop in the area was Sir Ekyl, and he&#39;s rarely in his castle; there&#39;s very, very few people in the area. Sheep, though, absolutely, and Barony Araeph is doing well with them.<br><br>-My comments on Wechi and Iric are more to do with politics/ideology than economics. They&#39;re both democracies who&#39;ve enshrined the idea of (apparently) universal sufferage: Iric votes for its Ops and Dars, while Wechi is a democracy on the Greek style: everyone (can) vote on everything.<br><br>And yes, I know that neither of those political systems would hold up in a rural/agricultural/medieval society - but this is an adaptation of the PPC community, where they certainly <i>do</i>. ;) The economics has to fit around the politics in this case.<br><br>-Also, remember that magic exists. ^_^<br><br>-I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right that Ozerbord is cripplingly poor. The Pass of the Five is a horrible route, and the tunnel (yes, it&#39;s a tunnel) in the south is at minimum far our of the way. On the positive side, our population is also terrifyingly low - no-one really lived there until the entire population of Konti-Nyuum fled there during the invasion. There used to be trade up the Copperway from what&#39;s now Barony PC (because both routes out involve mountain passes, but the Iron Highway used to be illegal), but that&#39;s dying down now. Um... don&#39;t ask where I got the money to start Critta-Kalthin from. ;)<br><br>-Scale! For some reason that I can&#39;t quite remember - oh, yes, arbitrarily scaling Weab to match Australia - Konti-Nyuum is only 80 miles long. That means a lot of the distances may be shorter than you think; you can easily see Vaekew from Borrd, for instance. (With that in mind, I&#39;d be fascinated to see a population estimate for the island as a whole...)<br><br>You&#39;re right that there&#39;s a whole bunch of people in Plort who aren&#39;t being mentioned - and should be! Everyone is officially either a Knight or a Civilian (or a Baron, I guess), and <i>officially</i> there&#39;s no distinction between the two except militarily... but all that means is that you can have &#39;peasant knights&#39;, not that everyone is fabulously wealthy.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>A robust economic simulation wasn&#39;t really on my mind when I invented Plort; I was too busy coming up with all the puns, and didn&#39;t really expect it to be, well, this popular. If people are actually role-playing in it, then I think it&#39;s a darned good idea to have the most realistic interpretation possible. It&#39;s the ultimate in applied history: given these starting conditions (the geography, ideologies, and so on), what is the best model for a sustainable society?<br><br>(Also: how many &#39;nobles&#39; can the population support?

            <p>(And spin it like this: you&#39;re a job creator for the elderly or otherwise infirm, providing a living in a hard time for the Barony and doing what you can for your people. No promises on it working, though.)<br><br>As a baron, your most important member of staff is your <b>butler</b>. He&#39;s in charge below stairs and sees to it that the quality of life you expect and deserve as a leader of the people is delivered to you without too many problems. Since this is a M/EM setting, you&#39;ll probably require a <b>squire</b> as well, who&#39;d basically be your personal man and fulfill the role of a valet during times of peace - which is going to be most of the time, since yo ass 2 broke to wage war or raid people.<br><br>General <b>cleaning staff</b> are the order of the day as well, though you can probably scare up some skivvies from among the local villagers if you need to get the castle in order before a major social event, so that&#39;s one less expense. You can probably make do with two on a permanent basis.<br><br>The largest amount of personnel are in the kitchen, though. The <b>cook</b> rules the kitchen, and she will have her own subordinates - sous-chefs, in modern parlance - though probably just a few. Again, big social events will require more hands on deck, so you can dredge a few up from the villages if you&#39;re hosting people. And you will be.<br><br>The last major expense is in your stables, which you have because it&#39;s like a garage. You&#39;re going to need a <b>coachmaster</b> (a generic title for the poor unfortunate in charge of the place) and sufficient <b>stable-hands</b> to make sure your horses are in prime condition. Usually, they&#39;ll also be working as your gardeners and suchlike, so that&#39;s another thing for you to save money on.<br><br>If you&#39;re wondering why I keep bringing up social events, well, you&#39;re a major political figure. Balls and so forth are a way for you to directly influence your fellow barons outside of the baronial council, and to do so when they&#39;re more amenable to your presence. Feast days also help your standing with the people under your command - it makes them feel closer to you, and you to them. You are a power-broker, and your home is where you broker it. =]</p>

(Yeah, I totally am, though.)<br><br>And thanks for the info! I&#39;ll go talk to my agents and see who wants which job. ^_^ Note that I also already have a pair of messengers (who may double-up as stable-hands), a hunter (because Ozerbord is lacking in population, so being able to at least partly supply the castle = good), and a warden... whatever that means! (One of real!Kaitlyn&#39;s ancestors was Warden of Oxford Castle under William the Conqueror, is why I have one.) I think she&#39;s probably filling the &#39;squire&#39; position, since she&#39;s acting something like a secretary. Given my usual style of warfare is to sneak in alone, rather than joining one of the crusade-like expeditions, she&#39;s probably in charge of the castle when I&#39;m away.<br><br>So... I need someone to buttle, someone to cook, and someone to run the stables. The rest I can probably create on the fly. Hmm... I shall ponder this.<br><br>hS</p>

The Scholars&#39; Empire is made of canons/fandoms (and paired with the Marizu League of badfic writers), and the Federation of Academia is made of university subjects; the other areas should probably be similarly document-based. Well, they&#39;re there if anyone needs them.<br><br>-The Mistwall separates Weab etc from countries based on the Real World. Ydyff, Nusantara, Arell are all up there. I&#39;ve left it unmapped for now. Whether the Mistwall is a magical route to another world, or simply an annoying navigational hazard, is currently undefined. It would not be inappropriate to map the lands north of it if they become relevant, but for now, I haven&#39;t (and they mostly <i>aren&#39;t</i> relevant).<br><br>-The feel I get from this map is that either the Mistwall is on the equator and we&#39;re all south of it, or the equator is somewhere around the bottom of the map... or there is no equator, and the world is flat.

            <p>... the map has had arrows pointing to the North-East Continent and the Original Homeland of SSM for a while now, and both of them point northish. The Mistwall has been arrowed directly north, too, and Autor of course has been sitting north of KN for a while. So a lot of stuff is sitting to the north of us (mostly because Weab is south, so, y&#39;know, it kind of gets in the way).<br><br>But that scale... 6000 miles isn&#39;t very big, really.

            <p>... Thanasius has two-way communication with Ydyff, implying routes through the Mistwall are reversible.

            <p>WARNING: LONG-WINDED FIRE EMBLEM SHIPPING INCOMING<br>Well, a couple of the kids have similar traits to some of the possible parents, so my headcanon pairs those up.<br>Inigo&#39;s a womaniser, for instance? Hello, Virion! Taciturn lone wolf Gerome? Lon&#39;qu sound familiar? Nah&#39;s fairly sensible, and a bit lacking in the sense-of-humour department. Next thing you know she&#39;ll be telling people to pick a god and pray...<br>Of course, some kids don&#39;t match up quite so well, like Laurent. His character traits come mostly from his mother, so I have no strong preference for his father. I like Sully/Stahl and Ricken/Maribelle pretty much on principle. And who better to pair with the Avatar of Destruction than the Random Number Goddess herself?<br>So, to summarise:<br>Chrom/Sumia<br>Virion/Olivia<br>Lon&#39;qu/Cherche<br>Frederick/Nowi<br>Stahl/Sully<br>Ricken/Maribelle<br>Robin/Anna<br>Henry/Lissa (there&#39;s a blood theme going on with Owain)<br>Gaius/Panne (Yarne&#39;s a coward, like a thief...? OK, a bit of a stretch)<br>Vaike/Tharja (I want to see him suffer. :-p)<br>Gregor/Cordelia (the only first-gen male mercenary)<br>Libra/Miriel (because only Libra would have the patience to put up with Miriel&#39;s eccentricities)<br>And I have no preference for second-gen pairings, though I will throw out the pairs that got me through Apotheosis:<br>Cynthia/Gerome<br>Brady/Lucina<br>Morgan/Owain<br>Severa/Inigo<br>Plus I used Laurent/Lucina to finish Lunatic+, so that&#39;s another option...</p>

            <p>Oh man, this is my jam.<br><br><u>First generation characters</u><br><br>Chrom / Sumia : it&#39;s canon, okay? Galeforce / Rightful King works with Aether super well on both Lucina and Cynthia. Plus, Cynthia&#39;s Chrom recruit lines are hilarious. <br><br>Kellam / Sully : enjoy your unkillable Kjelle. Aegis and Pavise OP.<br><br>Henry / Tharja : the two lovable maniacs, together forever. Vengeance Lifetaker Noire 2 stronk.<br><br>Virion / Olivia : for the sole purpose of justifying Inigo&#39;s behaviour. Also, Inigo&#39;s hair.<br><br>Donnel / Nowi : makes manakete!Nah absolutely monstrous with incredible growth potential.<br><br>Lissa / Lon&#39;qu : it&#39;s so cute! Perfect for Owen&#39;s growth stats, too.<br><br>Miriel / Libra : makes Laurent a little less squishy with 30% HP recovery at the start of every turn. <br><br>Maribelle / Ricken : To give Brady as much magical potential and to give him a recovery option in Lifetaker or Renewal. <br><br>Stahl / Cherche : another really cute pairing. Also, <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/df/20/f2/df20f210c98f7acc5a28c00cd602130b.jpg">this</a>.<br><br>Gregor / Panne : gives quite a bit of durability to Yarne and gives him quite a lot of good class options.<br><br>Cordelia / Gaius : the knight and the scoundrel. Makes Severa a highly versatile and mobile unit with Galeforce and Assassinate. <br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbg2M642BR0">Male!Avatar / Spoiler </a>: follow the link to reveal the spoiler. Gives birth to a monstrously good magic-focused Morgan. All together now: awww...<br><br>Female!Avatar / Kellam : the only ending which ends up in the history books remembering Kellam&#39;s name.<br><br><br><u>Second generation pairings</u><br><br>Lucina / Male!Morgan : let&#39;s face it, Lucina needs a cheerful presence in her life after all the crap she&#39;s been though. Morgan does just that.<br><br>Laurent / Cynthia : hilarious support between the straightest of straight men and the most <s>airy</s> heroic of pegasus knights.

            <p>&quot;One. This is the PPC. We defend the multiverse from Mary Sues and their ilk, who are spawned by people writing bad stories about said multiverse. Two. We have many departments, each specializing in their way of dealing with the Suvians: I&#39;ll give you the rundown of the most important ones. DMS deals with Suvians themselves. DBS handles badly-handled slash pairings-- more on that later. DI...angles multiverses which are smooshed together by badfic. DoI scouts for badfic. Personnel handles agent recruitment and such, DIA and DES handle internal and external security respectively, and Finance does nothing. Three. The job is dehumanizing-- good thing we&#39;re not human-- the pay is awful, most of us end up insane, and the Cafeteria food tries to eat you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>And you wonder why we face a manpower shortage. If only we had better PR.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can it, Taldaris. I&#39;m giving Nine a chance to escape.&quot;</p>

            <p>... and be a modern-day Vestal Virgin. I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be willing to adopt her worshippers - she seems the sort.<br><br>In fact, that&#39;s probably the best option for Hestia, as well. Athen<s>e</s>a creates children through intellect because she&#39;s a wisdom goddess. Artemis gets &#39;children&#39; by them joining the Hunt, because she&#39;s a huntress. Hestia is the goddess of hearth and home - she&#39;d absolutely adopt people as her children.<br><br>To continue the wild speculation: Hestial adoptees would be ordinary mortals. She&#39;s the one who gave up a throne on Olympus, who tends the fires in every Greek house - I think she&#39;d be far more inclined to care for mortals than demigods, in general. And Hestial adoption would bring... virtually no benefits. No immortality like the Hunters, no magical powers over fire. In fact, it would be a <i>working</i> adoption: you&#39;d take up the responsibility to tend for the human race, and in return, Hestia would help you out at need.<br><br>Oh, and on the Roman side, they&#39;re required to be virgins. ;) Not so much on the Greek side.<br><br>I think that&#39;s a workable concept for &#39;children of Hestia&#39;. It has no basis in canon, of course, other than the general framework; but I don&#39;t think a reasonable PPCer would kill you for it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Instead, I&#39;m going to talk about something that isn&#39;t seen so much: other religious systems. White people aren&#39;t the only ones with complex pantheons, thank you very much. =]<br><br>What might be interesting is the kind of divine summer camp setup you&#39;d get after the African Diaspora. Voodoo and Cajun Creole syncretic belief systems, after all, derive heavily from traditional Yoruba beliefs. That&#39;s what syncretic <i>means</i>. So... maybe a child of Olokun?<br><br>The Yoruba faith that made its way to Nawlins and other places around the Southern United States is based on the orisha; powerful beings that are aspects of a single god (and his three manifestations; now, where have we seen that before?). There&#39;s four hundred of &#39;em, so there&#39;s bound to be at least a few kids knocking about. Big families. Whatcha gonna do?<br><br>Now, Olokun&#39;s a sea god - the name means &quot;owner of oceans&quot; - but he also works with rivers and streams and so forth. He&#39;d also probably have a complex or seventy billion about the Maafa, since his worshippers were abducted over his oceans to live as slaves far from home. I&#39;d think that him and his would be working constantly to help slaves escape over that period, but there&#39;s a limit to how much they can do. Perhaps the syncretic nature of belief means they don&#39;t have the same power that they used to. Perhaps their connection to the spirit realm, Orun, is dwindling. Perhaps Olorun is merely unable to send as many irunmole to Aiye, the physical world, as he would like. No matter, what we have is what we have.<br><br>A child of Olokun, raised in the poorer areas of New Orleans, ravaged as it is by broken levees and uncaring right-wing politicians, poorly educated (and without the tickets for charter schools), sucked into a miserable life over which they feel they have no control... well, there&#39;d be a lot of anger there. Especially after some dickhead in a weird costume shows up and tells them they&#39;re actually the offspring of someone they&#39;ve never even heard of and surprise, you get to go to some manky bloody campsite in the middle of nowhere. I mean, <i>woohoo</i>, right? Your father&#39;s a literal god and the first thing you ever hear from him and his is that you&#39;ve got to go to his private bloody Jonestown? I should cocoa. So you run. You run and you run and you run, and you can&#39;t stop for fear of turning back...<br><br>And then, by accident or plothole or the sheer unimaginable eeeevil of &quot;uncanonical&quot; deities having their own campsite, you wind up in a maze of grey corridors with a sunflower for a boss and, Iunno, an <i>X-Men</i> badfic refugee for a partner.<br><br>A child of Olokun, done like this, could make for an interesting counterpoint to Percy Jackson himself. Good kid, mad city, as the album title (almost) goes. An angry young person who hasn&#39;t asked for much out of life and still didn&#39;t get it, resentful of their heritage, suckered into a job working out their anger on Mary Sues and Gary Stus.

            <p>... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovegrove">James Lovegrove&#39;s</a> &#39;Age of...&#39;/Pantheon not-quite series? Bunch of books that are probably best classed as Military Science Fantasy, each on the theme of &#39;gods from a given mythology are active in the world today&#39;. He started out with the Big Three, of course, but more recently he&#39;s done Voodoo, Hinduism, and of all things the Aztecs (plus a trio of shorts which includes &#39;Age of Anansi&#39;. African spider-themed trickster god... yeah.<br><br>I&#39;ve actually read all of them at this point, mostly for the worldbuilding; I can&#39;t vouch for the quality of the writing after first read, I&#39;m afraid. But the setups are all different - some books the gods are real, others they&#39;re not, others it&#39;s ambiguous. Might interest you.<br><br>As for your Olokun idea, I like how well thought out it is. The main issue I take is that you&#39;ve stuck with the &#39;child of&#39; theme from PJO. So why&#39;s that an issue? Comparative religion, of course! ^<em>^<br><br>The Greek myths are all about close relatives. Zeus defeats his father, his wife squabbles with him, his illegitimate children beat things up. So the Greek Riordan books are about children of the gods.<br><br>The Romans as a society were obsessed with lineages. The emperors claimed descent from Venus, and actually, a large portion of their social structure was based around &#39;was one of your ancestors one of the first senators?&#39;. So the Riordan Romans break up the direct families, and expand out to include descendants of other demigods.<br><br>Egyption mythology doesn&#39;t really have &#39;children of the gods&#39;, but has a lot of magical rituals, and the idea of the Pharoah <i>being</i> a god. So the Riordan Egyptians have... well, you get the picture.<br><br>Does the Yoruba mythology have a focus on children of the gods? The impression I get is &#39;probably not&#39;. I don&#39;t know what they <i>do</i> have as the primary theme tying gods to humans, but that&#39;s what you&#39;d want to focus on for your &#39;Nawlins Waif and the Gods of the Yoruba&#39; story, not copying from the Greeks. And if you did <i>that</i>, it could be a very interesting read (hey, you probably don&#39;t even have to change the story you&#39;ve hashed out - which, in case I didn&#39;t say, sounds very interesting).<br><br>(Also, what does this imply Riordan&#39;s going to do with the Norse? Heck if I know. The Norse gods were basically the weather: human interactions with them were limited to &#39;go party with them when you die&#39; and &#39;stay out of their way&#39;.)<br><br>hS<br><br>((PS: Egyptians aren&#39;t white people. ^</em>~))</p>

            <p>((Not heard of James Lovegrove until you told me about his work. I&#39;ll check him out! I&#39;ll be interested to see what he did with the Nahua faith. =] ))<br><br>---<br><br>The touchstone of the Yoruba faith is <i>ase</i>, the spark of life. It&#39;s basically humanity&#39;s ability for self-determination and it comes from Olorun. Directly. Which is... an interesting paradox. An <i>alaase</i> is someone who, through training and meditation and all that good stuff, is able to directly, consciously affect the life force of others, which would be an unusual powerset for a protagonist, especially one affiliated with Olokun.<br><br>Among the Yoruba, which patron orisha you get is up to your lineage - and it can be either maternal or paternal. The imori ceremony, or &quot;knowing the head&quot;, is generally performed right after you&#39;re born, over which a diviner determines what lineage you have, whether it be your mother&#39;s, your father&#39;s, or directly traceable to an orisha. For the purposes of this story, we can... delay it a bit. After all, it&#39;s not like our protagonist would have been in a position to have it performed on them, what with growing up in a dirt-poor part of New Orleans. In any case, if you&#39;re part of a divine family tree, you undergo an initiation rite upon reaching adulthood, in which your thoughts are made the spiritual vessel for the ase of the relevant orisha.<br><br>That, I think, is the link between gods and mortals in the Yoruba pantheon - a direct connection, this spark of life that makes a human more than just a sack of offal and bones. That, I think, should be the source of the power of a Riordanesque protagonist. Becoming an <i>alaase</i>, finding yourself, working in harmony with the quintessence of the god that lies within... it&#39;s a powerful image. At least, it is to me. Dunno about anyone else. =]<br><br>Also, another thought; the Yoruba creation myth states that the world was originally a watery, marshy wasteland, before Olorun - who connected the Invisible World to the physical one by a great chain - summoned land into being atop it. Which is also how you build, say, Venice.<br><br>Or New Orleans.<br><br>---<br><br>((And I&#39;d totally forgotten about the Egyptian pantheon being a thing in Riordan&#39;s books. That objection is withdrawn. =] ))</p>

            <p>The description you&#39;ve just given sounds very different to the sort of system that would produce &#39;hey, kid, you&#39;re the son of INSERT GOD HERE who was boinking your mother!&#39;. You&#39;ve used terms like &#39;affiliated with&#39; and &#39;patron&#39;, and the imori/ase/alaase setup you&#39;ve described would translate well into the &#39;Kids Who Know Gods&#39; setting of the Riordanverse. If anything, it&#39;s <i>too</i> good - none of the other pantheons simply drop a Real World practice directly in! It would be like having a series which goes &#39;Perky Jackman, you are a chosen servant of God! Now go join a monastery.&#39; ^_~ (Obviously not in terms of the plot, but in terms of realism).<br><br>So you probably <i>would</i> need to invent a support structure analogous to the camps, simply to make something of your own in there. Mm... a distributed network might be interesting, tapping into the slavery history. Can&#39;t go to Camp Africa-Blood if you&#39;re working on the plantation eighteen hours a day, can you? But if the gods/orisha can carry messages, you could have a &#39;go to this street; someone will help you&#39;.<br><br>That &#39;working in harmony&#39; notion sparks off an idea: maybe it takes time to learn to understand what you&#39;re being told. So it becomes a story of hunches and impulses, and Nawlins Waif not even being sure it&#39;s real - but on the other hand, with everything that&#39;s been happening...<br><br>hS</p>

And also, not only do the orisha of Yoruba religion have the ability to carry messages, they&#39;ve also got a dedicated chap for the job: Eshu, the god of chance, of unpredictability, of the nail for whose want a kingdom was lost.

            <p>Unclear description on my part: whether or not you can be (purportedly ^_^) related to an orisha, I didn&#39;t think - and was correct - that it was the <i>focus</i> of their interactions with their deities. To the Greeks, being a son of Zeus was pretty much the first, last, and only qualification needed to be a Hero (TM). To Romans, who your ancestors were was the be-all and end-all of your life. To the Yoruba, it&#39;s not the mere fact of your relationship - it&#39;s what you do with it.<br><br>So, I like this. When&#39;re you going to write it?

            <p>I mean, I <i>want</i> to, don&#39;t get me wrong, but...<br><br>I have no idea where to start. I mean, I could start with Shaniqua watching the man who wouldn&#39;t drown... not drowning, probably during Hurricane Katrina, but here&#39;s the thing: I went into this without knowing one single Goddamn thing about New Orleans, and the more I learn, the sadder I get. I want to show her walking through a landscape that&#39;s almost post-apocalyptic in tone, because that&#39;s how New Orleans felt to me during what little research I&#39;ve done so far on it - that after Katrina, Rome fell, and only now is it starting to bounce back, solely to the benefit of the rich white folks who lived there. The poor people? Sucks to be you guys, y&#39;all get underfunded, overcrowded public schools an inch from privatization to be run by whichever collection of delusional twerps is willing to stump up the cash, regardless of what they actually intend to teach.<br><br>The relief efforts focused on getting the rich districts back to normal first. It was a travesty, and a tragedy, and New Orleans isn&#39;t being cleaned up - it&#39;s being sanitised. The poor people are just another problem for whom the solution is being forced elsewhere, because, as Bill Bryson once put it, &quot;Americans don&#39;t know they want something until it&#39;s gone forever&quot;. That&#39;s how Mardi Gras feels in this Nawlins; an imitation of its former self, every edge filed off, krewes sponsored by McDonalds and American Apparel, with the thrown doubloons redeemable in branches of Starbucks for a gasometer of coffee that tastes like the literal personification of the Photoshop airbrush tool.<br><br>It used to be a party. Now it&#39;s a parade.<br><br>No, that ain&#39;t quite right. Now it&#39;s some ethnic festivities for rich white spring-breakers to gawp at brainlessly before going back to college on Daddy&#39;s money and write breathlessly inane blogs about what an <i>experience</i> it all was. You want a real Nawlins experience, blondie? You can&#39;t get it. &#39;Cause it means being poor and being black and being hopeless. It means being woke up every day at Too Damn Early o&#39;clock by the smell of wet rot, goin&#39; to a school where the kids have more knives than the cafeteria, watchin&#39; your friends disappear into drugs and gangs and the pages of the paper when their luck runs out. You had a party. <i>We</i> are the people who gotta clean it up for the next damn white people on the next damn bus-<br><br>...<br><br>Wow, um, Shaniqua? I&#39;m not sure who you are yet, and I&#39;m not sure you are either, but you are angry and you are afraid of getting lost in a country that doesn&#39;t care about you one bit, and I am sort of very slightly in love.</p>

Out of the corner of her eyes she could see Benoît and Meryem about thirty metres away, busy haranguing Owen. Benoît seemed to be particularly agitated, waving his arms and holding his head as he talked. Meryem simply stood there, one hand cupping her chin. She looked at Benoît and said something. The aspiring Ranger straightened himself, looked at his partner, and nodded. He held out a hand towards the Lucario. Victoria breathed in a sigh of relief. <i>Oh, good. They&#39;ve made peace.</i> <br><br>Owen removed his kevlar vest, handed it to Benoît, and allowed himself to be escorted by Meryem through a portal that she had opened. Benoît followed the pair, raising a hand to his personal radio. As the portal closed, Maxwell and Victoria&#39;s radios crackled to life. <br><br>&quot;Benoît here. Wrap up your business in the Courtyard and meet us at DIA Central. Meryem and I have decided to suspend Owen.&quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>((Still going to continue to participate but with only Tacitus.

            <p>Tacitus flipped though his notebook, scribbling dialog on a detached sheet of paper as he consulted his notes. &quot;My notes tell me that you&#39;ve been in frequent contact with one Emiranlanoamar, aka the Guardsman from DIA. He talked weapons with you-- something about a high-powered staser rifle if I recall correctly. With something like that at your side I imagine that you would sleep quite soundly at night. I&#39;m going to offer this bit of information for free since we&#39;re friends and all. An Assassin has two mark sevens for sale, dirt cheap.

Then again, it seemed like he&#39;d just find out anyway, and it would be nice to at least know <i>what</i> sort of information he&#39;d be getting, since it would come straight from them...

            <p>&quot;Are you going to let yourself be bullied by her until the end of time? Besides, there are witnesses at Rudi&#39;s who have already sold tidbits of information about Lola to Madam... but like I said: we don&#39;t have the full picture.&quot; The Zorua scribbled a note to himself in the margin and wrote another message for Rina. &quot;What you&#39;ll write next will be absolutely confidential: we don&#39;t sell everything that comes to us. The Notary will never know. Besides, you already owe us a favour.&quot; Tacitus nodded towards Zeb. &quot;Benoît&#39;s team retrieved multiple feathers from Cresselia for Madam. She saw fit to send you one as a gift. We just hope that you might return the favour.&quot;<br><br>The Zorua pushed his notebook and pencil towards Rina and cocked his head to the side, watching her carefully.</p>

            <p>&quot;Do you think Owen is the type of person willing to admit that he is owes his life to a near-complete stranger?&quot; wrote the Zorua. &quot;Acquiring the feathers was his way of settling the debt. Madam sees great potential in both of your careers in the PPC. She would like to consider you as...&quot; Tacitus thought about his wording for a moment. &quot;...friends.

            <p>He then shook his head harder. A D.O.R.K.S disguised as a spare notepad fell out of the dense tuft of hair on Tacitus&#39; head and clattered to the ground. Leaving Zeb to manipulate the Kostume System by himself the DoI operative continued following Rina, staying outside of her peripherals by sticking to dooraways and ducking behind the occasional passerby. <br><br>Tacitus frowned. It wasn&#39;t like him to meddle in the affairs of other people outside of Madam&#39;s work. Come to think of it, why was he concerned with this girl&#39;s plight? Her story was exactly like countless others in the PPC. She was nothing special compared to the rest. Perhaps it was his need for a thrill that prompted the hunt. Arceus knows how difficult it was to hold back from eliminating a Suvian at the end of an intel run. There was no kill here-- just like in any normal intel run-- but the excitement was there: the danger of being caught and the swiftness of the case. Tacitus felt alive. </p>

            <p>One of the main draws of the PPC, in my opinion, is the sheer variety that we get with the agents. Some are personal avatars, like Valon Vance is for me. But more often, we have characters that reflect the things we like, like my three other agents.<br><br>So what do you think of just a sort of forum game where we get each other to create new agent ideas, even if we won&#39;t use them ourselves?

            <p>Alright, let&#39;s get started, because I&#39;ve had way too many ideas for these guys.<br><br>1: A Jaeger, from Girl Genius, in a non-action department. Because I thought it would be funny to have a tall, angry, green German constantly complaining about wanting to get into fights.<br><br>2: One of the plethora of OCs for Sugar Rush that were made after Wreck-It Ralph came out. The sheer volume of characters that were cut from this cloth indicate that at least one of them would end up at the PPC. If possible, I would want to pair him/her up with an Agent from a different videogame, because the Sugar Rush Racers all know beforehand that they&#39;re just characters, which I thought could set up an interesting dynamic with a partner who didn&#39;t already know that.<br><br>3: Generic goblin/henchman/low level baddie, from practically any game ever. There are just so many ways someone could take this, it would be fascinating. Does he stay as some chaotic evil, dumb enough to charge adventurers screwball? Does he end up terrified of anything even remotely resembling a hero? Does he still think attacking things much more powerful than himself is a good idea?<br><br>4: A Draken scientist, from Wildstar, preferably in DMSE&amp;R. Yeah, I know I had the Jaeger up at the beginning of this post, but Wildstar lets you make a big, scary, vicious monster that actually wants to analyze and experiment. Plus, with all the lunacy and tech lying around in that canon, there are far more entertaining ways to get to the PPC than by falling through a convenient plothole.<br><br>5: A Department of Intelligence Agent. We seem to have very few of them, and I thought it would be entertaining to try writing an Agent that has to put up with all the same idiocy of badfics without being able to kill the &#39;Sues at the end. </p>

            <p>Specifically, a new agent team that I&#39;ve been planning to do for a while (I know I&#39;ve got three teams already, but I plan to rotate between them periodically so they don&#39;t get too dry. Kinda like crop rotation or something.)<br><br>1.) My mom owned a copy of Wii Fit once, but we lost it when we cleaned up the house a few years ago. So what would happen if the female Wii Fit Trainer from that game ended up in the PPC? She&#39;d be a mild-mannered, nurturing figure who looks out for the health and safety of her partner and basically everyone else she cares about. She could&#39;ve worked for the Nursery, caring for the children there, but she was recruited at the worst possible time, when Mary Sues began overcrowding the multiverse, so she had to go into Sue-slaying to help the PPC keep up. I can see her working in the DMS: Video Games division along with her partner, which leads me to the next concept.<br><br>2.) This one was inspired by <a href="http://magsuoka.tumblr.com/post/113051413001/saber-chan-shulk-would-make-a-great-honedge-he">this</a>. A walking crossover of <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i> and <i>Pokemon</i>, this guy was once a character replacement of Shulk with characteristics of the Honedge family. He&#39;s the eager one of the pair, and to reiterate an over-used joke, he&#39;s really feeling the plot continuum, all day, every day. Like Florestan, he&#39;d go off on angry rants about anything and everything wrong with a continuity error stated or caused by a badfic, and if his favorite characters are made OOC, he gets even angrier. He&#39;s highly intelligent as far as canon knowledge is concerned, and picks up on new continua surprisingly quickly for a humanized living sword. He also inherits Shulk&#39;s mechanical expertise, and he could&#39;ve gone into the DoSAT if it weren&#39;t for the fact that the PPC needed more assassins to keep up with the recent Sue influx.<br><br>And just for fun, how &#39;bout two nonhuman agents?<br><br>3.) A Chinese Dragon. Yeah, I know, there are dragon agents, but most if not all of them are of the Western variety. Naturally, he&#39;d have powerful magic abilities, so he&#39;d end up being in the DIA. He could even be Rashida&#39;s former partner. In contrast to her, he&#39;s really collected and cultured, and he speaks using long words and is almost always mild-mannered. He&#39;s also reluctant to use his abilities unless he has to neutralize an attacking Sue, and pursues mundane interests like painting, tea, and stargazing.<br><br>4.) A <i>T. rex</i>. Yeah, you heard me right. A Mother. Flocking. <i>T. rex</i>. Specifically, one from one of my favorite anime films, <i>You Are Umasou</i>. This one would be a female, and she&#39;d be a fiercely protective sort, but like Heart (the protagonist of that movie), she&#39;s also got a sensitive side. The biggest problem I see with her is that she&#39;d be a bit too big for the halls of HQ, but then again, we have a Triceratops agent and she can use disguises to avoid bonking her head on the ceiling, so maybe the same could go for the &#39;rex. Her power and bite force would lend really well to the DIA, because Sues relying on beam fights are annoying and I&#39;d rather have someone take them out physically, like how Indiana Jones just shot that swordsman.</p>

            <p>Creating a good agent can be hard, especially if it will be your first. There are examples all over the place of authors using one character or agent as a basis to create a new character from. Jay and Acacia are, of course, the best example to use of this - they were the first, and thus every agent after is going to have some aspects of them present, even if it&#39;s not readily apparent.<br><br>So why the sudden trend?<br><br>I think the answer is because making an agent from a canon never used before is even more difficult. There won&#39;t be an example to draw from, because the agent itself will act as the basis for others. In addition, how well the agent is written will influence whether or not people want to base something new off of the concept later. If it does well, you&#39;ll start seeing them all over as new authors are inspired. If it flops, people will try to forget that agent was a thing. I believe there are a few main criteria that a new concept must meet in order to be successful:<br>1. It must be explained well enough that someone who has never seen the source canon material will be able to understand what it is, what it does, and what may influence it.<br>2. It must be within the realm of possibility within the standards of the PPC. This can be quite broad, but an agent with too many weird things going on probably won&#39;t be received very well.<br>3. The agent must follow the rules established by their source canon; after all, they&#39;ve spent their whole life within that canon. Why would they suddenly change their natures and way of life just because they fell through a plothole?<br><br>I actually have some examples of the process. When Iximaz was thinking of bringing in what eventually became Zeb, we were discussing what a Pokèmon agent might have to deal with. Some of the questions asked were things like &quot;what species would be best?&quot; or &quot;how would typing affect personality or fears?&quot; and &quot;how would a Pokèmon react to being told to attack a human?&quot;. After all, Pokèmon live in a world of relative peace. In the games, you don&#39;t see many direct examples of a human being seriously hurt or killed by one, and it would likely have an adverse psychological effect on the creature. In terms of typing, something that is weak to, say, Psychic might distrust the Flowers due to their telepathic speak, or something like a Charizard would have a crippling fear of water due to the flame on their tail being tied to life force. In my opinion, she did an absolutely phenomenal job of introducing a Pokèmon agent and fulfilling these criteria, and the recent influx of &#39;mon agents can attest to that.<br><br>My theory is that these trends happen as a direct result of the difficulty required to make a new agent from an unused canon. Once the barrier is broken and an example is made, agents will pop up all over the place. All it takes is a good start to gain inspiration from.</p>

            <p>It might be worth noting that my own Falchion predated Zeb by quite a significant margin, so that would make him the first true Pokemon agent to show up in recent years (everyone else was either a trainer or a Pokemon gijinka). Falchion&#39;s Steel-type and high defenses make him quite complacent and laid-back, and his Impish nature lends well to wisecracks and snap decisions that his uppity partner may not like. Rashida herself likewise has to live with the prospect of a feline body adapting to a human-tailored PPC environment, though it&#39;s her power and quick temper I&#39;m often more worried about.<br><br>As for general cases, nonhuman agents do seem to be showing increasing prominence, if the fact that I have at least three of them active is any indicator. Anthropomorphic agents are different because they already have human-like behavior ingrained into their personalities, but agents that are truly animalistic and sapient at the same time would have different morals and patterns of activity which can be harder to work with than human characters.​ It may be that Falchion unwittingly kickstarted the trend, unless examples of non-anthropomorphic human agents are known from before he first turned up!<br><br>Also, what Darkotas was implying goes double for agents whose species is normally hostile to humans in their home continuum. For example, how would Ripper, who is derived from the <i>Velociraptor</i>s from <i>Jurassic Park</i> (despite being more scientifically accurate), cope with an environment populated by people, whom the raptors kill on a regular basis? I did take some inspiration from Marsha when considering the possibility of him becoming an agent, but she certainly isn&#39;t a meat-eater; I can&#39;t find Trask&#39;s spinoff to save my life either so I pretty much went in blind in that regard. I think the biggest factor in his favor is that neither of his partners are 100% human, and Falchion is technically the PPC persona of his author and a maniraptor as well, so it would be easier for Ripper to work with him than with a pure human agent.<br><br>(Then again, of course, the trailers for <i>Jurassic World</i> do show tamed raptors, so it&#39;s not like Ripper can&#39;t call a truce with humans at all. That and, well, Rina and Randa obviously didn&#39;t get mauled to death during my collab with Iximaz! XD)</p>

            <p>There are two major problems with non-human(oid) agents, IMO:<br><br>1. They&#39;re going to spend most of their on-screen time in disguise, so what&#39;s the point to making them look different?<br><br>2. Without a certain amount of intelligence and outlook in common with World One humans, it gets difficult to answer the question of why they should give a damn about badfic. You can get around it with badfic recruits, because they&#39;ve seen the problem firsthand, but the average dinosaur or Pokémon in its natural environment isn&#39;t exactly sapient, and even if they were, how do you convince them to care about something they have no way to relate to?<br><br>&quot;So there&#39;s these fictional beings—&quot;<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s fiction?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, so there&#39;s these stories—&quot;<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s a story?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um.

            <p>There are at least several examples throughout the entire universe of certain mons that just hate humans.  That could provide kind of all the motivation needed.  Take Mewtwo from the original movie for example.  Up until that very second when Ash did his sacrifice turn to stone pseudo-death thing, Mewtwo would have been very content to attack humans.  If that wouldn&#39;t cause so many problems I think a Mewtwo agent might be kind of cool.</p>

            <p>Mewtwo is a unique creation - only one is in existence. A Mewtwo agent would have to be a clone or replacement, since the canon Mewtwo could not be utilized. Seeing how Mewtwo already suffers from Cloning Blues... another clone or replacement might be a bit too off the deep end to function. But hey, the PPC practically runs off of bottled crazy anyway!</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right about not being able to use that specific Mewtwo (then again, he did fly off into the night after Mewtwo Returns, never to be seen again...), but, from a PPC perspective, Mewtwo is hardly unique. As EvilAI mentioned, the latest games basically state that each game (if not <i>save file</i>) is its own parallel universe, so there are potentially millions of Mewtwo out there.<br>Meanwhile, according to the journals in Pokémon Mansion, Mewtwo isn&#39;t an artificial clone of Mew; Mew gave birth to it. No human intervention was involved. The Pokédex contradicts this, of course, but the Pokédex routinely contradicts the laws of physics, so I tend not to pay much attention to it. (Also, &quot;years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments&quot;? Mew was discovered in July, and Mewtwo was born in February. Yeah, that&#39;s &quot;years&quot;...)<br>My personal theory is that, in times of stress, Mew can recombine its own genes to produce a Mewtwo child. It makes sense, since Mew isn&#39;t exactly a big fighter. Of course, that&#39;s just headcanon, but it explains the Mewtwo in Pokémon Ranger 3 and Pokémon Conquest better than there being only one Mewtwo.<br>I guess it all boils down to which parts of canon you choose to believe. I don&#39;t know whether headcanon is acceptable in Agent backgrounds, but that&#39;s how I&#39;d get around the problem. And if that doesn&#39;t satisfy you, again, there&#39;s plenty of canon that can be used to achieve the same end.<br>Then again, maybe this is all moot, because the original topic was finding a Pokémon that would attack humans, and any alternative Mewtwo wouldn&#39;t necessarily share the animé!Mewtwo&#39;s misanthropy.</p>

            <p>Though I think the argument can be made that in the anime verse there are at least two Mewtwos.  You have the one from the first movie, then you also have Mewtwo from the Genesect film.  It appeared to have a female characterization and actor rather the male from the first film.  Also there was no indication that that Mewtwo recognized Ash.  So you might be able to argue that two separate groups of scientists tried to clone Mew.<br><br>Now if you were to go to the game universe, things are a bit different.  While there is only one per game, you could theoretically have Red Mewtwo, Blue Mewtwo, Green Mewtwo, Yellow Mewtwo, FireRed Mewtwo, LeafGreen Mewtwo, HeartGold Mewtwo, SoulSilver Mewtwo, X Mewtwo and Y Mewtwo.  You could also use the excuse that it arrived via a game glitch that erased all save data.  But then again a super off the deep end Mewtwo would basically be your Godzilla Threshold.  It could be fun to write.</p>

            <p>With Falchion, there really wasn&#39;t any other way to go about his character. I literally could NOT be a PPCer without a Skarmory agent to honor my Boarder name, and I&#39;ve had a Skarmory persona for years without knowing what to do with him anyway. The fact that my very first mission involved the one badfic I actually completed as a Suethor only compounded this further, as I felt that the only way to properly deal with it was with my own PPC persona.<br><br>Likewise, I had plans to rescue Ripper since day one, because I always thought his character wasn&#39;t as blatantly offensive as the other three Suvian characters of his homefic, which was what made it possible for me to actually feel sorry for him when missioning the fic. Writing him certainly didn&#39;t leave as bad of an aftertaste as Terrordactyl (or Arceus forbid, not!Ludlow), and I always wondered what a dinosaur agent would be like, especially one from the JP continuum in which all the meat-eating dinos want to kill you.<br><br>One trend I&#39;d like to see in the near-distant future, IMHO, is agents who were formerly Sue-wraiths. As of this writing, there are only two known instances of those, both of my own creation, and one only barely so because she was an OC I had in the works for several years prior. This leaves Cupid as the only known instance of an actual purified/rescued Sue-wraith with salvageable personality traits (just not ones that would be consistent with the character they possessed). I will concede that his case was exceptional, given the circumstances, but I&#39;d honestly like to see more characters based on the concept, because I personally believe that it offers a pretty unique perspective and a fresh avenue for character development compared to all the former character replacements running around HQ already.</p>

            <p>A lot of these are not fully fleshed out enough to really count as a full agent concept; they&#39;re just some ideas that I think would make for cool characters.  <br><br>1 - A Haunted Oracle from <i>Pathfinder</i>.  Oracles are divine spellcaster who have had power &quot;thrust upon them,&quot; so to speak, and have to deal with a curse of some kind as a side effect.  Haunted Oracles, in particular, are followed around by spirits of some kind that allow them to access specific spells, but have a tendency to mess with their stuff; it takes longer to retrieve an object from your bag, and if you drop something, it flies ten feet away from you.  It&#39;d be cool to see an Oracle actually interact with the haunting and could lead to some good jokes.<br><br>2 - Kind of similarly, a Summoner/Eidolon team, also from <i>Pathfinder</i>.  It&#39;d give the team a very different vibe from the usual one we see, but it could still play off some of the same tropes, especially if they&#39;re new to each other.  Moreover, I think it would be really interesting to explore the psychology of an eidolon.  Most of the time, they&#39;re either comic relief figures or walking class features, so it&#39;d be neat to see one get equal development.<br><br>3 - And continuing my theme of &quot;TRPG character linked to supernatural being(s),&quot; a Sin-Eater from <i>Geist: the Sin-Eater</i>, one of the nWoD games.  More specifically, a non-WoD agent who was fatally wounded in that continuum.  As they were dying, a Geist offered to join with them.  Now the agent has to deal with sharing their head with a strange, ghostly being, as well as all the other Sin-Eater baggage.  A similar option would be a dying agent that Awakens as a Moros, though I don&#39;t think becoming a Mage would be quite as much of a paradigm shift for an agent.<br><br>The last one is an idea I&#39;ve been considering using myself, actually.  The first two are absolutely free-to-use, but I&#39;d like someone who&#39;s thinking of using the third one to ask first.</p>

            <p>1/ The mild-mannered azhdarchid from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFddeA6xDGWo5vJxDvOUep_LPJIzrmgZ5EwUUzFj8jg/pub">#42 in &#39;Getting Some Exorcise&#39;</a>. Sandra and Freckles think he might not have been a canon character, and given that there are exactly two talking azhdarchids in fiction that I can see (a <i>Quetzalcoatlus</i> in one of the &#39;Land Before Time&#39; movies, and a Skybax in one of the &#39;Dinotopia&#39; books), they&#39;re probably right.<br><br>I see this character as a sort of reverse Indiana Jones. Where Indy was a professor who&#39;d rather be out adventuring, this azhdarchid is a field agent who&#39;d much rather be researching. He&#39;s good at his job, and does it without complaining - but his heart is elsewhere.<br><br>2/ An ordinary human being from World One is somehow <i>required</i> to take a job at the PPC. This is a character with a very clear story arc - over the course of, say, six missions, she learns to cope with the frankly bizarre world she&#39;s ended up in. She&#39;s a realistic viewpoint on what it would be like to fall into the PPC: not the usual &#39;hey, magic, cool&#39;, but how someone would <i>actually respond</i> to having flora for bosses, horrendous working conditions, magic technology, and a job which occasionally involves cold-blooded murder.<br><br>3/ A World One human... from a very long time ago. Let&#39;s say Ancient Rome. She&#39;s someone who not only doesn&#39;t understand PPC technology, she literally doesn&#39;t have the framework to <i>come</i> to understand. And, significantly, she doesn&#39;t care. She has the idol that summons the magic doorway, she knows it must be provided by one of the gods, and those people who witter on about &#39;remote activators&#39; are to be ignored. For best results, written in first person, and keeping the theme all the way through.<br><br>From that, you can tell that she&#39;s very confident in her worldview - y&#39;know, sort of like most people are. ^<em>~ I don&#39;t picture her as trying to persuade the others, though. It could be that she was a Roman slave, accustomed to holding opinions without showing them; I&#39;m not sure. But I think she&#39;d be fascinating.<br><br>She&#39;s basically a reaction to all those agents who are from places without tech, and <i>get it instantly</i>. Seriously, how? (Actually, come to think of it: she&#39;s Leela, isn&#39;t she?)<br><br>4/ and 5/ An agent team. Our first agent is one of the Greenwitches from &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The</a></em>Dark<em>Is</em>Rising_Sequence#Greenwitch&quot;&gt;Greenwitch</a>: basically a magic-powered woman made of sticks. There&#39;s a new one made every year, so she&#39;s not quite a canon character. Like the Greenwitch from the book, she&#39;s selfish, petty, quick to anger: all that good stuff.<br><br>But... she lives off the Wild Magic, and that&#39;s in short supply at HQ. When she runs low, she literally comes apart - she bursts into a storm of twigs and rage and fear.<br><br>That&#39;s where her partner comes in: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9998481/9/Tenth-Walkers">Saranésë</a>. He&#39;s a Tolkienian nature spirit in the mold of Bombadil, and he&#39;s basically an incarnation of the Wild Magic. Like Tom, he invokes it through singing - which means he spends a <i>lot</i> of time singing to his partner to &#39;pull herself together&#39; (har har). Being an incarnation of the landscape, he&#39;s pretty calm, but also playful - again, see Bombadil.<br><br>In the original version of this idea, he was a singing Green Man, but I can&#39;t remember... uh, why. He could still be, if someone can come up with a decent rationale.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I want all of these up for adoption, actually. 2/ and 3/, definitely, but 1/ and 4-5/, I think I&#39;ll keep for myself. I might still do something with them.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Why not create a chassis or framework for people to build on? A few details, with the author filling in the rest.<br><br>For instance, I could say &quot;a fairy from <i>Touhou</i>, maybe with plant-based abilities.&quot; While obviously this would require a bit of Touhou research, just saying that give people enough to build ideas from, but not enough that they&#39;re just using someone else&#39;s character.<br><br>... okay, full disclosure time.<br><br>Mainly, I suggested this because there are lots of continua that I&#39;d love to see agents from, and how they&#39;d interact with badfic. In Touhou, for instance, you could completely shut down a Sue with the Spell Card Rules. Since they&#39;re designed to put everyone on a level playing field, and they have to be feasible, a Sue couldn&#39;t just make an impossible bullet pattern and have done with it; they just wouldn&#39;t be able to attack.<br><br>I also don&#39;t want to spread myself too thin, though. Two teams with two agents each is probably the limit of my PPC writing abilities. With a forum game like this, I could channel basic frameworks and other writers could pick them up and build their own characters.</p>

            <p>What Scapegrace is saying is that yeah, this idea could work for newbies coming up with agents, and I&#39;d be excited for it! But you&#39;d have to tailor it such that people create their own agents rather than adopting them, because it gives the creator a lot more flexibility. Besides, adoption is extremely rare, and the only three instances I know of where a Boarder has adopted a character from someone else&#39;s mission are TheShyIon&#39;s Ginger-Wise, eatpraylove&#39;s Violet, and my own Brenda (whom I have plans for in the near future, don&#39;t worry c;)<br><br>This creative flexibility is why I for one have the somewhat questionable habit of adopting basically everyone I recruit in my own missions. That and, well, I just wanna write certain characters. It&#39;s part of the reason for Cupid&#39;s existence, for example, and in general, all of my agents are either recruited from actual missions or refugees from my old or WIP story ideas, the one exception being Falchion who was once my self insert and was never involved in any stories at all.<br><br>...though I may or may not be planning to introduce a team that could change that status quo, hehehe... *rubs wings evilly*</p>

            <p>The idea, in and of itself, isn&#39;t bad - it could be a nice exercise - but people coming up with their own characters to use as agents is pretty important, so just creating agents for other people seems wrong to me.</p>

            <p>And I don&#39;t mean a silly, Edwardian-like one. I mean an agent who used to be an actual vampire.

            <p>Once a year, there is an Official Plort Thread. This is where the Baronial Council semi-RP happens. It&#39;s also the only place I&#39;ll offer open services in making heraldic devices; I&#39;ve always preferred to keep that in one place/time.<br><br>That thread will include people telling the story of their characters. No doubt it will also include people playing small RPs on the side; that&#39;s kind of a given for the PPC.<br><br>There&#39;s no grand, all-encompassing RP, though. In fact, I&#39;m not sure how there <i>could</i> be - the place is an island 240 miles long, for Kanun&#39;s sake! There&#39;s no excuse for dragging everyone together that wouldn&#39;t remove a lot of the fun from things.<br><br>What Plort is, ultimately, is a <i>setting</i>. RPs spring up from time to time - apparently Iximaz and her <s>peons</s> <s>cohort</s> <i>friends</i> have been doing quite a few in their spare time - but there&#39;s no Grand RP.<br><br>(Honestly, given how weirdly popular the whole thing has been, the annual thread thing could be a non-starter; I might have to give in to inevitability and just open the whole thing up for year-round editing. But that&#39;s wooooork...)<br><br>Anyway: if you&#39;d like me to check over your incarnation for &#39;canon&#39; trouble, I can do so - huinesoron at hotmail dot com is probably the best address.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Great work on the Tale. In particular, I liked the world-building aspects of the different forms of magic, and seeing interaction between two new leaders stepping into their roles while defending the realm was quite interesting. <br><br>I&#39;m a big fan of Thanasius now - while he may be a hypocrite at times when it comes to self-sacrifice, that same spirit of service to keep others from harm makes him a very noble leader indeed. I look forward to seeing more of Plort in the future!</p>

            <p>(As for titles, how about &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;?

            <p>-Do a grammar/style/consistency/clarity check on Part 5.

If nothing outside of the ones established in that scene ever shows up, I think it would be unjustified to turn it into a major part of the story.
