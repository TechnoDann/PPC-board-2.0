            <p>I&#39;m not sure when I last posted here, I think it&#39;s been several months at least. It feels way past due for me to start hanging around here again, at any rate. <br><br>For those of you that don&#39;t know me, or have just forgotten, I read mostly fantasy and sci-fi, watch a lot of anime, and I&#39;ve dabbled with writing original fiction (none of which I&#39;ve ever actually finished). My writing projects in recent years, aside from the few PPC bits I&#39;ve done, have mostly been for homebrew RPGs - both the setting/background and the actual game system. These have been... interesting little exercises in frustration. <br><br>I know that when I was last here I was involved in some co-write projects with some of you guys, which you won&#39;t have heard anything from me on for a <i>looooong</i> time, so I apologise for that. I&#39;ll try and e-mail you guys about them - despite appearances, I would be interested in finishing them. <br><br>How are you all doing?</p>

            <p>Off hand, I can&#39;t really think of anything notable that I&#39;ve done during my absence. Which... isn&#39;t really a good thing.<br><br>Part of what triggered my returning here was the realisation a few weeks ago that my free time had basically devolved to just playing Star Wars: The Old Republic. Now, it&#39;s a fun game, and I enjoy it a lot - but I probably didn&#39;t need to be spending every waking moment playing it. <br><br>With that realisation came the thought that I used to do a lot of other fun stuff, such as hanging out here and writing, and that I should probably try for a bit more variety with my free time.<br><br>I did come up with some ideas for an original sci-fi universe. Not the first time I&#39;ve thought about that - thinking about sci-fi tech is one of my favourite hobbies. But this time I&#39;ve decided to learn from my past mistakes and write a series of short stories set in the universe. That way, I might actually <i>finish</i> something. </p>

            <p>(Putting it in the subject to grab attention. ^_^)<br><br>Looking over the recent World of PPC thread, I think we&#39;ve only got one new Briton (Baroom). Most of the rest of us are still occasionally around - Storme, Cassie, me and Kaitlyn, and Scapegrace-who-was-Wobbles.<br><br>We also have at least - wow - six Europeans: Matt Cipher (Poland), Sergio Turbo (Italy), EileenAlphabet (Denmark), Hieronymus Graubart (Germany), QuintusFabiusPictor (Netherlands), domirossi (Corsica)... and I suppose by some counts Desdendelle (Israel), though I think the Middle East is usually filed under Asia?

            <p>My class visited Canterbury back in 2009, and I definitely got a tube of some kind of weird chewy candy <s>and then pawned a bunch of it off on my classmates so I could be done with it</s>. The cathedral is pretty awesome. There were repairs or something going on at the time, though, and it would be nice to see it without all the scaffolding and whatnot. And, y&#39;know, explore more of the city than just the little bit that was on our agenda. We also stopped at the Pilgrim&#39;s Hospital and Greyfriars Guest House, though. The latter has a beautiful garden.<br><br>(Out of curiosity, are you counting the 2009 Bath Gathering as ending up in a pub?

(tm).<br><br>Personal favourites on the pub front include The Foundry (great food, brew their own beer on site), The New Inn (has a library AND an accordion), and The Bottleshop (which I accept is dubious but it&#39;s in a lovely indoor farmer&#39;s market and I get a discount).

            <p>Not gone for good, just an extended hiatus - that is not yet gone which can eternal procrastinate... or however that saying goes. <br><br>As for the Gathering report, I think I was meant to be writing most of that, so I think I dropped a bigger ball... or dropped it from higher up, or something. I might need to do some fishing too. The Gathering report was certainly one of the unfinished projects that I was thinking of. <br><br>I&#39;m glad you were able to find a new job, hopefully the better hours is balancing out the not-as-goodness. Yup, I have your interlude and mission open in other tabs (Happy Birthday by the way, even if I am a couple of weeks late saying it) and have already read Phobos&#39;s Catastrophe Theory piece. I&#39;ll have a review for him soon. <br><br>More reading material certainly doesn&#39;t hurt, but mostly what drew me back was remembering how cool the community was (wow, that sounded far less sappy/cheesy in my head - ah well). <br><br>I&#39;m good, and yes, work is keeping me busy. But the good kind of busy, rather than manic busy. Manic busy was earlier in the year. Still doing quite a bit of travelling for it too, which is cool. I&#39;m getting a lift in to work with a friend these days, so I think I&#39;ve actually done more mileage in hire cars in foreign countries than I have done in my own car, which is a little weird. But now that I&#39;m out of the manic busy stuff (fingers crossed that lasts) I should be able to start doing some writing again.<br><br>-Irish </p>

            <p>A lot of fanfic recommendation, from the members&#39; here to TV tropes have a lot more examples of the best being in the &#39;Pit&#39;.<br><br>To be honest, fanfiction is like mainstream media.

            <p>So then.<br><br>I&#39;ve been making Plans revolving my characters. The main reason for their existence is because I feel like the characters <i>have</i> to have something big in their history, or else they&#39;ll be forgotten.<br><br>However, SeaTurtle and Ix (both of whom are in-the-know about my Plans) say that&#39;s not quite the case.<br><br>And honestly, I&#39;m confused. Most of the agents I remember have had big, attention-grabbing events in their careers and those events are how they stick in my mind. This means characters like Rina, Supernumerary, Dafydd, Suicide, Laburnum, and Cadmar.<br><br>A lot of other agents? They blend together in my mind, because they all follow the stock PPC formula. And this is exactly what I don&#39;t want to happen to my agents.<br><br>They&#39;re likable, well-written characters, but honestly? I personally feel like that doesn&#39;t matter if they don&#39;t accomplish anything, which they really haven&#39;t. Without accomplishments, they&#39;re generic PPC agents.<br><br>Without something dramatic to shake up the narrative, I don&#39;t know how I can further develop my characters, and to me the PPC <i>is</i> about the characters. Focusing on the badfic can lead to boring missions with talking-head syndrome. I see badfic as an opportunity to expand my characters, but if I just follow the same formula every time, there won&#39;t be much to develop.<br><br>The final problem I have is that I&#39;ve been making these Plans for months. If I just scrap these ideas, I feel like all that time and effort was wasted.<br><br>All in all, I&#39;m just confused about what to do here. My mind is telling me that drama and surprise is necessary, but my friends are saying they&#39;re not.</p>

            <p>The plug has been pulled on my Plans. They&#39;re going to the same resurrection-proof section of the Idea Graveyard that I put Sigma.EXE.<br><br>For those not in the know, my Plans were to kill Valon, and transform him into a Victim Ghost from Silent Hill 4.<br><br>I ran the idea through five people, all of whom thought it was a great idea, or kept their reservations to themselves. The sixth PPCer to get the idea started raising all sorts of questions, that I just couldn&#39;t find good answers to. Then one of the first five admitted concerns she had, and got me to start seriously rethinking this. Another of the first five suggested I post this topic on the Board.<br><br>So, I guess you can all thank SeaTurtle, Iximaz and SkarmorySilver for knocking some sense into my skull, and saving Valon.</p>

            <p>So I can&#39;t really comment on that.  I think you should look more at your motivations for having big plans as opposed to focusing on the plans themselves.</p>

            <p>First off, your motivations seem a little... off to me.  You seem to be mostly concerned with what other people think about your agents.  While I understand that it&#39;s good to get feedback on your characters and hear positive things about them, I think you should put creating a good story over being famous within the PPC.  So if you think your Plans are going to make for an interesting story and you want to write it, then go ahead.  But if your only motivation is because you feel like it&#39;s required in order to get them in some kind of nebulous Hall of Fame... then maybe you shouldn&#39;t.  Poorly written Sue-fics get lots of favorites and comments, but that doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s what you should aspire for.<br><br>Secondly, I think it&#39;s better to focus on personal drama than big, HQ-rocking drama.  Some things, like what happened to Rina, are likely to have wide-spread effects; other things aren&#39;t likely to ever really be heard of outside their RA. But that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t have an impact on the people it happened to. If your characters cross a line on one of their missions and end up in trouble, it might make the news or it might not.  But that doesn&#39;t matter to the people it happens to.  What matters is the way that it changes things for them.  Even something little that might not seem significant at all to outsiders can have a major influence on the people it happened to.  Look at Derik in Neshomeh&#39;s most recent mission.  Even if he and Gall never tell anyone else about what happened, it&#39;s clearly shaken him a lot.<br><br>And on a final note, I feel like you&#39;re being a little unfair to some of the other PPC writers.  Just because a character doesn&#39;t stick out to you doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re bad or unorignal, it&#39;s just a matter of personal taste.  I&#39;m not saying all PPC stories are perfect and it&#39;s wrong to criticize them, but it kind of comes off a little as &quot;if I don&#39;t remember them, then they&#39;re worthless.&quot;</p>

            <p>Big events? Don&#39;t accomplish anything.<br><br>Drama for the sake of drama? Is boring.<br><br>Shaking up the narrative just to say you did? Quite frankly, is trite.<br><br>For a long period of time as part of the PPC, I read every single findable and published mission. We&#39;re talking /years/ worths of spin-offs, and dozens and dozens. <br><br>The ones I can talk about in casual conversation or discussion and bring up easily with other boarders? <br><br>It isn&#39;t because they were attached to big attention-grabbing events. Quite frankly, I barely recall the whole list of agents that were volunteers for the Alumia emergency back in 2008- and that was quite a Sue!<br><br>As for the characters you listed: What do you really remember about them?<br><br>Unfortuantely I can&#39;t say anything about Rina, because I haven&#39;t read those spin-offs (My apologies!), but for the rest?<br><br>I remember Nume because Nesh&#39;s missions are clever, and she has interplay and continuing growth between Nume and Ilraen.<br><br>Dafydd? Thanks to hS&#39; missions featuring Dafydd, I know way more than enough about Silmarillion and the Feanoreans than I would otherwise. hS builds history and background information into his missions <i>without</i> making it feel forced. It isn&#39;t just about the big events, it&#39;s about what leads up to it and what happens after- the causes and results. <br><br>Suicide? Let&#39;s start with the base stock- Suicide&#39;s creation and entry into being a PPC agent is truly unique, as far as any goes, and the fact he&#39;s stayed himself- rather than being adapted into acting like a modern age agent?- well worth remembering!<br><br>Laburnum? Oh, I certainly remember that spin-off, and not only because of those big attention grabing events you cite.<br><br>Cadmar? Shark teef. &#39;Nough said.<br><br>If you&#39;re taking the attitude that it is all about big events making waves and attention grabbing to make a character unique and not &#39;stock&#39;, you&#39;re dead wrong- and it&#39;s an attitude that won&#39;t serve you well as far as making your <i>own</i> characters develop.  You don&#39;t have to focus only on the badfic; aside from that, the stock formula is stock for a reason- or are you suggesting that TOS is forgettable and generic, by these standards of yours? Besides, the main component of hS&#39; mission based spinoffs and and Neshomeh&#39;s? Stock. It&#39;s not what happens that makes them memorable, it&#39;s the writing and care behind them. Quality, rather than quantity or explosiveness. <br><br>While my own spin-off&#39;s mostly faded into the distance with time, I still used the stock formula, and altered where I needed to do what I wanted with my own characters&#39; personal story arcs. I mixed it up by using plenty of interludes between missions- in fact, I was one of the first to start that practice!- and by having a leadup and cooldown both before and after the mission itself in each story. <br><br>Sometimes you have to dump plans you&#39;ve made for months- it&#39;s not a waste of time or effort. As a writer, your first and foremost goal is to write something that&#39;s <i>enjoyable</i> and works well as a whole. If you&#39;re crafting it to match some sort of formula for expected success, you might find it, but you&#39;ll not enjoy it as much as you will otherwise. <br><br>There&#39;s nothing wrong with stock, if you know what to do with it. It&#39;s just the broth. What you do with it and what you put into it results in an actual soup.</p>

            <p>Namely this: <i>As a writer, your first and foremost goal is to write something that&#39;s enjoyable and works well as a whole. </i><br><br>I think first and foremost as a writer your goal is to write something that you enjoy writing.  If other people find it enjoyable, then I consider that gravy.  If Voyd wants to write some big event that does not impact the PPC canon as a whole, I say give it a shot.  Now if the reason for doing it is to be memorable, then I am inclined to agree with you.  Because again, as I said, I firmly believe that one should write for themselves.  If others remember it, fantastic, if not, so be it.  Same with whether or not others enjoy it.  <br><br>Now turning to the original concerns Voyd voiced, here is what I have to say.  Do <b>you</b> like what plans you have made up to this point?  Do <b>you</b> think that it needs some drama or surprise?  Then write it out.  Draft it.  Then see how you feel about it.  You should not bind yourself to what other people want, unless it is something technical (Sues, spelling, grammar, etc).  <br><br>As far as plot is concerned your first and, in my opinion, only real concern is <b>Do You Like It?</b>  Now that is my general opinion on writing.  With something like the PPC, just like other forms of Fanfiction, there are conventions you have to follow, i.e., not disrupting canon.  The only caveat goes to being part of a shared universe, it could theoretically be outvoted by the community at large, but I say write it, see if you like, and then submit it to the community and go from there.  </p>

            <p>It seemed to me that it was more about making it enjoyable for the reader.  For me, it is the process itself that should be enjoyable.  If I misunderstood your words, then forgive me.  <br><br>I was mostly trying to get at the point, that you should write what you want first and foremost.  If you want Drama, go for it.  If you want a sappy love story, make it so.  If you want to put your characters through a living hell, that is your right.  So, what I am really trying to say is if Voyd has some long term arc planned, I say go for it, so long as it fits the medium.  Fanfiction obviously has different rules than original fiction.  </p>

            <p>Congratulations on breaking the TOS number- very few people actually manage that one. Despite the fact that there are really, well and truly hundreds and hundreds of spinoffs by now, the number that have surpassed TOS in number of missions is... I would say there are between 30 and 50? Highballing, really. Nesh, you got any more accurate estimates, there?<br><br>Also, you would be surprised at what I&#39;ve got time for (at least if the pace is decently maintained and your missions are not actually novellas in and of themselves).<br><br>(Just not right,due to the fact that in the middle of the ocean is not the best of times to be trying to read a spin-off right off the computer.)  </p>

            <p>Eight if you count the mission six diptych as two, though it&#39;s constructed as one story. The others are three interludes and Ilraen&#39;s intro story.<br><br>If you add in Derik&#39;s four missions and the one Agent Neshomeh went on, though, I&#39;ve written or co-written twelve (or thirteen).

            <p>I think I started writing FtPs in 2004, so that brings the average up to about 2.75 per year.<br><br>OTOH, I started writing my DIC spin-off in 2006 (though nothing actually got published until 2007).

            <p>Dafydd and Selene have all of six recorded missions together (ie, the same number as Kaitlyn and Selene). Dafydd <i>officially partnered with Selene</i> has 18 stories, of which five are non-missions (the other seven are three each with Vemi and Constance, and one with Neshomeh and Alec).<br><br>The total count of missions written by me, including the two Intelligence reports, seems to be... 37?

            <p>Or Suicide, or Cadmar?<br><br>If you&#39;re thinking of &quot;Subjugation,&quot; I must point out that the mission never actually got done, and Nume wasn&#39;t even originally supposed to be involved—he and Cameo were retconned in after Shae and Jo&#39;s author dropped out of the project. He&#39;s not even mentioned in the little bit that did get written.

            <p>I happen to agree with you there. {= ) The question I&#39;d pose to you, though, is why they stand out from the rest of the spin-off. BRN has the advantage of being a pretty well-known badfic (though my mission has yet to attract anyone to the PPC on that basis that I&#39;m aware of, le sigh), but &quot;Ring Child&quot; doesn&#39;t, so let&#39;s look at that one to avoid distraction. More specifically, what choices did Tungsten and I make as writers that made that mission more than just your standard broth with the usual chicken, noodles, and maybe a few vegetables, to borrow July&#39;s analogy? What choices could we have made instead that would&#39;ve made it just another mission?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

<li>Character interaction. I&#39;d say this is a staple of all good PPC missions. So what made these interactions stand out? How can you apply those principles to your own writing?<br><br>2 and 3. Putting these together because I think they&#39;re both examples of the same thing, which is the mission writer(s) choosing which bits of badfic to mention and then <i>making</i> something of them. I&#39;ll give you this one for free: It&#39;s not enough just to point at the mistakes and go &quot;Oh, that&#39;s so bad!&quot; That&#39;s how you get talking heads. Instead, take what the badfic is doing wrong and then really rack your brain for the best way to show it. Always push the envelope a little farther.<br><br>4. Heh. You know why we did that? &#39;Cause we didn&#39;t want to write our agents killing a child-shaped thing. We had to make it monstrous so we wouldn&#39;t feel like monsters. After the fact, it made sense—and we went back and highlighted a clue here and there—but that&#39;s the whole reason for it. The assassination of something that looked like a three-year-old was simply not the story we wanted to write. So what does that tell you?<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>Because to me, it felt like it had all the hallmarks of a mediocre or bad fanfic. From whitewashing Maleficent to demonising and bastardising the King and fairies. The movie felt like it could&#39;ve been a great morally grey movie (where both sides had their flaws and understandable reasons) if it chose to stay away from the black and white routine (by just switching the roles). </p>

            <p>Remember Hollywood is a business, so it might be that their focus testing has determined that the public do not really want new ideas, and would prefer to see the same things.  Take for example this:<br><br><i>Ex Machina</i> a very good, new, experimental film dealing with artificial intelligence, and what makes a human, human. It took about $ 36 Million world wide.   Now lets compare this to <i>Jurassic World</i>, which is a sequel to Jurassic Park.  Not a bad film, but no where near as good as the original.  It has been out less than two weeks and has grossed over $1 billion dollars.  Lets also look at the other top grossing films this year.  <i>Furious 7</i> and <i>Age of Ultron</i>.  Both sequels.  It seems that that is currently what the people want.</p>

            <p>I hadn&#39;t thought of it before, but yeah, it does have an awful lot in common with a certain subset of bad fanfics.<br>I didn&#39;t think it was a very good movie. I got a sense of what it was trying to do and it was very admirable, but I thought it was very poorly executed. Good ideas killed by sloppy and messy writing.</p>

            <p>But I think Maleficent has more to do with the recent obsession with retelling the villains to be more sympathetic. I guess it&#39;s due to value dissonance between what was collected back in 19th century and how Disney wants to portray all characters as rich in detail and have every reason for their evil.</p>

            <p>Some of the best villains ever were complex characters which you can despise for their actions but understand why the way they are. <br><br>I guess it all depends on how the tools of writing are used. The movie&#39;s attempt at humanising Maleficent isn&#39;t the worst, it&#39;s just that it came at the expenses of other characters&#39; personalities. <br><br>But there&#39;s nothing wrong with villains who have no sympathetic reasons for their actions. Joker and Disney&#39;s version of Claude Frollo are examples of such. The first has such a mysterious background it is hard to tell if he a poor guy who went insane one day or a monster who only got worse one day while the second is frighteningly realistic like Huns from Frozen and  Mother Gothel and there&#39;s hardly any reasons that excuse his actions.<br><br>Ands I hope the trend doesn&#39;t go like the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s obsession with anti-heroes, and darker and edgier in comics (most tried pulling off Watchmen without understanding that the darkness and edginess was the by product of a compelling and well thought out story, and not that dark and edgy made the story work).</p>

The original was the one that had her condemn to death until one of the fairies changed it. <br><br>I made an error in the last post in that I should have said that the King was demonised while the fairies were bastardised... still doesn&#39;t stop them from being irresponsible, unfunny and annoying characters that somehow can&#39;t pay attention enough to notice when a child takes tumble off a cliff because they&#39;re slapping each other.<br><br>Still feels like a fanfic that had a good idea but only pulled it off decently at best and missed the mark by a yard at worst, at least to me. Then again, talking about the movie is like bringing up the Hobbit movies for both book and movie fans, the new Mass Effect for fans or Metroid: Other M for Metroid fans; lot&#39;s and lot&#39;s of debating and arguing ensues.</p>

            <p>Mass Effect Andromeda or Mass Effect 3?  From what I have seen Mass Effect Andromeda seems to have pretty solid expectations all around, ME3 was polarizing for a lot of people, but really only for the last 30 minutes or so.  That&#39;s what people argue over, well usually, or if you are me then you argue over Vega.  But from comments I have seen since its release, most people really have issue only with the last bit, now for some it ruined the entire game, others not so much.  <br><br>Then again I am also not including the whole DLC Ending/Regular Ending.

            <p>Twenty two. You know, according to some people*, the years that are double (11 22, 33, ext.) are lucky years for you. So, clearly we need to start off this lucky year with a little celebration! Yes kids, it&#39;s that time again! I give you a <b>Fanon Pinkie Pie Party!</b>(tm)<br><br>What is a Fanon Pinkie Pie Party you may ask? What makes it any different from a regular Pinkie Pie Party? Well, I&#39;ll tell you!<br><br>As you probably know, the My Little Pony brand is made primarily for little girls. Unfortunately, this means Hasbro forces canon to mostly restrict Pinkie&#39;s parties to those suitable for a five year old little girl. (Although it seems we are getting through to them somewhat!) While this is all well and good for said five year olds, those much older then that can only find so much enjoyment from them that is not based on pure nostalgia.<br><br>Enter the Fanon Package, where we use a dash of Fanon and a drop of OOC to break the shackles enforced by corporate onto our favorite Party Pony. Now she can be the Super Duper Party Pony she was meant to be, and throw you the BEST PARTY EVER! Music, drinks, lights, snacks, party games, and quite simply the most delicious cake you will ever taste!<br><br>BUT WAIT, there&#39;s more! Pinkie Pie uses a mixture of her fourth-wall breaking abilities and a Remote Activator we managed to acquire to bring in ANY CANONS YOU WANT! Just choose your prefered location, provide a list of your favorite fandoms, and we provide the rest! Party with Pokemon, tango with a T-Rex, even get to hug without consequence!<br><br>By the end of the party, specially programed robots with Neuralyzers will sort out all of the canon mess left behind, so don&#39;t worry your little head over any damage to the continua. They will even neuralyze you, making the party seem like it never happened and that all you were doing was reading about this fantastic party!** The robots even have time travel abilities, due to being based off of the T-1000, so you won&#39;t even notice the time difference! This is quite simply the best party you will never remember!<br><br>The next time you have a special event to celebrate, just remember: <i>There Ain&#39;t No Party Like a Pinkie Pie Party!</i><br><br>*Me, mostly.<br>**Should you have memories of said party, even vague ones, we recommend writing down, in detail, what you remember. Perhaps in story format. This will help in the healing process from the neuralisation.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been trying to write a series of short fics that take place in Star Trek. My issue is with the technobabble. Some pieces of it are used consistently enough that it&#39;d be canon defilement to get it wrong. And I&#39;m not just talking about things like the Warp Core. Stuff like that is obvious.<br><br>And now, on to the problem, which is to say, I can&#39;t remember the stuff like: Tetryon particles! These things are used all the time, but not regularly enough that I can remember them very well. And I don&#39;t want to re-watch the whole franchise just to get one piece of technobabble right. <br><br>My knowledge of engineering is also getting in the way, as I&#39;m finding myself using real and theoretical tech in these fics, because I just cannot come up with technobabble! It doesn&#39;t just sound like gibberish to me, because I know the Terminology, so it sounds wrong instead. Nucleogenic particles do not cause rain. The closest thing I&#39;ve heard of to Theta Radiation is Cherenkov Radiation, which is not a byproduct of antimatter/matter reactions. Explosions are, though. Star Trek was correct there, at least some of the time.<br><br>I don&#39;t dislike technobabble, I dislike using it, for the above reasons. I would just skip the technobabble, and design the starship as I went, but the most advanced spacecraft I could come up with is just a Space Shuttle, which Starfleet doesn&#39;t use.<br><br>Does anyone else have these issues, or a way to fix them? Even something like a technobabble generator would work, as long as the fans don&#39;t rip me limb from limb for using &quot;Quantum&quot; when I should have used &quot;Ionic&quot; or something else. If the fans aren&#39;t as rabid as I remember, I might be fine, I just want to avoid accidentally making badfic due to misused terminology.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not compulsory. No, really. You can store it via a weak measurement thing that allows you to monitor it safely without causing it to annihilate matter. How do I know this?

            <p>The only Trek episode I deem unworthy of even being capitalized. I know it is possible to store antimatter and study it, but in threshold, they used antimatter injections to (spoiler alert) cure Tom Paris&#39;s and captain Janeway&#39;s sever case of amphibiosis. That&#39;s my nickname for what happens to you when you go beyond warp ten. It also has the dubious honour of being the only Trek episode not considered canon. Coincidence? You decide!</p>

            <p>Memory Alpha is probably going to be your best bet, or if you do not want to re-watch the entire series, you could maybe do a film or two.  Less time, still get a large portion.  the TNG films have a good deal of that kind of stuff and how it works from what I recall.  If I recall, <i>First Contact</i> might be a good place to start.  I think they cover most of the common technobable.<br><br>Though I might be wrong, and am just recommending it to be watch. It is probably my favorite Trek Film.  </p>

            <p>I know that the Jurassic Park section on Fanfiction.net has a nasty common trend that involves bestiality and raptor. Also know that the Harry Potter section is infamous for demonising characters and whitewashing (enough to make two tropes named after two common ones (seriously, how didn&#39;t the two have a name before?) and that the LOTR fanfics being a wee bit too obsessed with Legolas and Aragorn (Tolkien&#39;s stuff I wouldn&#39;t even dare touch out of respect for the fact his work revolutionise the fantasy genre.

            <p>Most fandoms have badfic outweigh the good. Look at MLP, my personal #1 fandom. It has a lot of garbage fic out there. Like, a lot, a lot of garbage. Like. Dang. Still, it is known as having some of the best fanfic writers out there. Why? Because we have a lot of really good ones. Dangerous Buisness, Past Sins, Fallout: Equestria, and on and on. We have more badfic, yes, but there is so much exceptional goodfic and plenty of general good or ok fic, it balances out.<br><br>Sonic, on the other hand, has no exceptional fic. Nothing that makes you say, &quot;Wow. This was professional quality writing. I might even pay some money for this!&quot; The best Sonic fanfic is just good. Nothing that really stands out. Just, OK. And that is why it has such a bad reputation; because without the brilliant, the horrid stands out all the more.</p>

            <p>Sonic as a franchise isn&#39;t exactly the easiest to make a really great story out of but I think the divided fanbase arguing over which canon is best makes it worse.<br><br>Seems like it can go to two extremes; some so dead serious about canon that deviating from it slightly or choosing the wrong one at the wrong place and time might get your head bitten off verbally, and others are so loose that ya can&#39;t even tell what canon it belongs to or if it is a Sonic story at all.<br><br>Though I think the Metroid fanbase has the weirdest ideas for shipping.

            <p>Well, two, but the other one has almost nothing, just the description.<br><br>One fic idea was following a kid who has never been chosen by their divine parent, watching as all these others get quests and gifts, and mostly, a sense of belonging. Then, one day, they are called before the Oracle. They have a quest to embark on. And yet, still no parentage. This is a journey not only across America, but of self discovery.<br><br>Neat, but, that is all I have.<br><br>As for the other... well, one day Scapegrace mentioned a Fallout crossover. And that got me thinking. How would Fallout go, where the Greek gods still around? I wrote up a <i>war never changes</i> thing for it, but I&#39;m on mobile, so I can&#39;t get it. I&#39;ll post it when I get the chance. Suffice to say, I think it works out terrifyingly well.</p>

            <p>Everything you just said, plus the Skulduggery Pleasant fandom. I have only found about 10 decent fics  there. And don&#39;t even get me started on Fairy Tail. I love the series to death, but would it kill the fanfic writers to at least make something halfway decent?<br>Reccomendations for both fandoms would be appreciated.</p>

There&#39;s &quot;explicit&quot; and then there&#39;s &quot;Samus Aran gives a blowjob to a nerdy but buff dude at a gaming convention despite finding him a little pathetic, and he can&#39;t even handle it to the point where he blurts out &#39;Fraggle Rock&#39; instead of &#39;....&#39;&quot; To say I am not hooked by this opening is an understatement, but my mouse cursor is crawling its way to the close button as though time has slowed to a near-stop and I will experience the few seconds it takes to get out of this window as several decades.&quot;<br><br>It has an interesting idea to what the planned premise but... seriously?! A sex scene with Fraggle rock as a organism shout is your introduction to a serious story! That and the fanfic blatantly ignores the fact that Samus lived on a high gravity world so she would not be light at all (especially since estimated that she can carry a 46 tonnes object on earth with no suit). I&#39;m pretty sure that she&#39;d accidently kill a sex partner by her own strength alone.</p>

            <p>So I&#39;m trying to name characters for a game of Demon: the Descent.  Part of the premise is that the characters were once servants of the God Machine, known as angels, who have rebelled and Fallen, becoming demons.  They possess both a fake human identity to fit into the world and an angelic identity that is their true form.  Most of them have &quot;angelic&quot; names in Hebrew that end in &quot;-iel.&quot;  <br><br>My character&#39;s human name is Reiko Kamino, which is Japanese for &quot;zero child of God.&quot;  (I know that usually Rei doesn&#39;t mean zero when it&#39;s used as a name, but Reiko specifically spells it that way.)  She also has an NPC &quot;brother&quot; named Ichirou Kamino (&quot;first son of God&quot;), who is still an angel.  I&#39;d like their angelic names to have the same meaning as their human names.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know any Hebrew, and none of the online translators give pronunciation guides for the Hebrew script.  I.e., Google Translate says zero is &quot;אפס&quot; in Hebrew, but I don&#39;t know how to pronounce it.<br><br>Sorry if this is a strange request.  I&#39;d really appreciate it if someone could give me hand with this.</p>

            <p>You have two Hebrew speakers on Board! DawnFire and me, to be precise. <br>Anyway, on to your request: the &#39;x-iel&#39; suffix actually means &#39;my x is god&#39;; for example, &#39;malkiel&#39; - &#39;malki&#39; my king + el = my king is god (I won&#39;t bother you with the exact grammar here). <br>Onwards. אפס is pronounced &#39;EH-phes&#39; and it indeed means &#39;zero&#39;. So if you want to use that as a basis, you get Ephesiel, which roughly means &#39;my zero is god&#39;. If you want the literal meaning, you get something very unlike an angel&#39;s name or, indeed, a name at all.<br>&#39;Firstborn&#39; is בכור bkhor, so that&#39;s a tad easier - בכורהאל Bkhor&#39;ha&#39;el is literally &#39;God&#39;s Firstborn&#39;.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help!  Maybe I&#39;ll just use Ephes as her name?  Demons sometimes drop the reference to God after they Fall...

            <p>Ephes&#39;ha&#39;el is what gives you, literally and kind of amusingly, &#39;the zero of God&#39;. You need the &#39;h&#39; sound there, even though it would probably get a bit slurred in speech, because otherwise all you&#39;ve really done is... Well, made &#39;ephes&#39; feminine, in a weird way that shouldn&#39;t apply to the word (as far as I know, it has no feminine form, because it doesn&#39;t generally need it. To that end, calling your character Ephes works fine).<br><br>Also, on another note, Ephesiel is just about the funniest thing I&#39;ve seen today.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>The plot is nice and clear, at any rate:<br><br>The magician Saul (well, he does summon the dead...!) bargains with David, taking him on as his fairy servant. David defeats Saul&#39;s enemies for him and secures his place as king - but Saul should&#39;ve known better than to trust a fairy. Before too many more years have passed, David has befriended Saul&#39;s favourite son - and managed to get himself declared Saul&#39;s heir. When Saul and his sons all die in the same battle (which isn&#39;t suspicious at <i>all</i>), the fairy servant becomes king over Israel.<br><br>Which probably explains why, a few generations later, most of the country schisms away... would <i>you</i> want to live on under a fairy dynasty?<br><br>(All in silly fun, I hope.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Because in the book, it&#39;s mentioned that a few people were actually magicians before the time of the Aureates (the Golden Age of English magic, during the first reign of the Raven King). One of them was Joseph of Arimathea, who in the books had a chat with the Glastonbury Thorn in addition to planting it. =]<br><br>And since fairies in JS&amp;MN generally look to humans to figure out what to do (the show makes the Gentleman with Thistle-Down Hair a lot more overtly villainous than he is in the book), humans tend to remain in charge even in fairy brughs - which is probably where the Raven King got so much of his power from. Most, if not all, of the Aureate magicians had at least a few fairy-servants. Some had more. Lots more. Fairies are just better at magic than humans are, because they can talk to the landscape properly while humans don&#39;t think it&#39;s really possible.<br><br>Now, another interesting crossover would be JS&amp;MN/Harry Potter. I&#39;d be interested to see how well English magic can fare against Death Eaters, considering its long and storied history. But then, would the Raven King not have tried to squash Tom Riddle flat the moment he started trying to kill his subjects? Remember that during the Aureate period (roughly 1066-14XX) the north of England was basically a separate country with the Raven King&#39;s capital at Newcastle...<br><br>Hm. This needs further thought. =]</p>

            <p>But about my main genre, car racing games, I guess it is the <u>critically acclaimed</u> Need For Speed Shift (and its sequel).<br><br>I wonder if the &quot;racing drivers&quot; who reviewd the game as being a realistic simulation have ever driven a car in their life.<br>Long story short, handling is <i>terrible</i>. A full race-spec car on slick tyres handles like a brick on soap wheels. Steering is incredibly inconsistent too - cars will either refuse to steer or go on a full four-wheel drift. No mid way in between. I initally thought it was due to me using a keyboard, but after hooking up my steering wheel to the PC results were the same.<br><br>Tuning is pretty inconsistent either - I can swap a fully tuned 800 horsepower Toyota Supra engine on a &quot;works&quot; (full race tuned) Toyota Corolla GT-S (basically a Super GT GT300 class car), and yet I can&#39;t set the top speed any higher than the non-swapped Trueno&#39;s 264 kph... meaning that the engine is stuck with the wrong gearing and the car is actually SLOWER.<br><br>A stock-bodied (so basically no aerodinamics aside a small optional spoiler with... 20 kilograms or so of downforce) Toyota Sprinter Trueno (Japanese Domestic Market equivalent of the Corolla GT-S) tuned to 240 horsepower in Gran Turismo will consistently set faster lap times on the Nurburgring Nordshleife than the GT300 wide bodied, full aero, 350 horsepower full-on race car Shift offers.<br><br>This:<br><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/LwcMQ7PfhNI/hqdefault.jpg" alt="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/LwcMQ7PfhNI/hqdefault.jpg"> <br><br>Is faster than this:<br><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JWSZoyKBmIU/SqzBz-b3sWI/AAAAAAAACaU/lWQ0vHRkKkw/s1600/SS1517+6.jpg" alt="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JWSZoyKBmIU/SqzBz-b3sWI/AAAAAAAACaU/lWQ0vHRkKkw/s1600/SS1517+6.jpg"> <br><br>That&#39;s all.</p>

            <p>If you liked Oregon Trail, there&#39;s this game on Steam that&#39;s basically Oregon Trail as a side scrolling game with a plot written by a hyper imaginative 8-year-old. (Which actually works surprisingly well)<br><br>While I don&#39;t really have one in particular, my two worst games have got to be Guise of the Wolf and Zoo Race. The first has shitty graphics, horrible scenery coding, a crappy attempt at a jumpscare, sound effects that actually loop over each other, and a stupidly difficult first freaking level that includes several instant-death traps right behind a surprisingly difficult maneuvering puzzle that&#39;s made even harder by clumsy controls and hitboxes for obstacles that don&#39;t even work properly. But that&#39;s not the worst thing about this &#39;game,&#39; oh no. The worst thing is that the developers of the game actually *threatened to sue a critic who gave it a bad review, essentially trying to quell dissenters, dictator-style.* Given that the critic in question, TotalBiscuit, not only has access to that lawyers of Polaris, a company owned by mother...ing Disney, but has a degree in law. That&#39;s basically like trying to fight a battleship with nothing but a slingshot and a claim that you&#39;re invincible.<br><br>The second is another Bible game centered around Noah&#39;s Ark, but you actually don&#39;t even get to see the ark. No, no, no: you play as one of four people transformed into badly textured animals by God himself to reenact animal races that Noah had in Biblical times. Note: the game never actually tells you this. I had to figure that out myself from the terribly animated and voice-acted cutscene. I found a review for it online by Jontron, which goes over this piece of shit&#39;s problems far better than I can: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2av978FgLI"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2av978FgLI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2av978FgLI</a></a></p>

            <p>Tolkien would never have written men-who-sleep-with-men or women-who-sleep-with-women. He was a Victorian-minded Catholic, of course he wouldn&#39;t! The Tolkienian friendships that people tend to project homosexuality onto - Frodo and Sam, Maedhros and Fingon, etc - are <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Theory5.htm">reflecting a very different dynamic</a>. As Alleb said, the <i>Laws and Customs of the Eldar</i> text specifically negates homosexuality in Elves.<br><br>But that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t fit into his world. Tolkien would never have written about Minas Tirith&#39;s sewage arrangements, either, but it must have had them!<br><br>As Alleb also said, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11184632/1/Intransitives">I&#39;ve written a story about this very subject</a>. I have another one in the works building a whole theory on the subject. Remember, the <i>Laws and Customs</i> is an in-universe document - it can be wrong, or limited in scope, or simply concealing information.<br><br>So no, Tolkien wouldn&#39;t have written it, but no, that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t be well-done and canon-friendly.<br><br>hS, &#39;do not go to the elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes...&#39;</p>

            <p>But I&#39;ll throw in my two cents. <br><br>No, I don&#39;t think he would, or did. In fact, in <i>Morgoth&#39;s Ring</i> (if I&#39;m remembering correctly) he makes it pretty clear that Elves are never homosexual. Huinesoron will definitely be able to answer this better; actually, I think he made a fic about it. He goes by his Boarder name on the Pit, so you can find it there. I&#39;ll leave him to give a more in-depth answer. </p>

            <p>I know this might sound like whining but I&#39;m curious as to why ye don&#39;t do Mission in which ye show how a good fanfic can be done or how a bad fanfic can be turned around into a good one.<br><br>After all, bashing a bad stories is fun to read, it doesn&#39;t exactly help to know what makes a good fanfic since ye are only demonstrating how to bash bad ones instead of trying to make a demonstration of how to make them good or better.

            <p>I think there&#39;s something somewhere that says something to the effect of &quot;by writing missions, we&#39;re creating more goodfic and thus increasing the average quality of fanfic,&quot; but that&#39;s not really why we do it. We do it because it&#39;s fun and makes us feel better about the existence of badfic. Those of us who actually want to help a particular fic or author improve give concrit. (And no, it doesn&#39;t often work.)<br><br>Also, &quot;bash&quot; is a strong word. These days we strictly do not bash the authors or even talk about them at all if we can avoid it, and as DawnFire said, we do try to use our missions as a form of critique to point out what doesn&#39;t work in a particular story <i>and explain why</i>, though again, the success of this varies. And you&#39;re mistaken if you think it&#39;s for the badfic author&#39;s education. We actually prefer that the authors never find out we sporked their stories. However, we learn from each other, and other people who read PPC missions can learn things from them, too. So that&#39;s another way we indirectly improve the quality of fanfiction, and fiction in general.<br><br>Have we mentioned that several PPCers have gone on to be published authors, and one that I know of is a professional editor? I recently did some freelance proofreading work myself, as a matter of fact. Dunno if the book will be published yet, but I&#39;d like to think it stands a better chance now. The PPC helped me learn to see what&#39;s actually on the page rather than what I expect to be there.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That is our means for providing constructive criticism, and how we show how some fanfics did it right. Well, that and offer up badfic for the killing by another group, but tbe that as it may.<br><br>I also think that a mission, when done right, should be a humorous dissection into what made a particular fic not work. It&#39;s not just poking fun, it is pulling apart the worst of the worst bit by bit to show exactly what the shortcomings were, and possibly how to fix them. Now, not everybody shares this same goal, and that&#39;s fine. But when you see one of my missions (you know, some time next year) know that is what I am trying to do.</p>

            <p>hS&#39; Driftwood, which I think you&#39;ve been linked to before, Rustic, includes a section at the end of each mission called &#39;Agent Kaitlyn&#39;s&#39;...bother.

            <p>I can&#39;t quite comment on the content of the first one; I know even less about prehistoric Mesoamerica than I do Lord of the Rings.  But at the very least, you&#39;ve done an excellent job of reflecting the type of forum discussion you see some places.  It&#39;s so funny precisely because it&#39;s so true.  The play was also very funny, though I was slightly disappointed that Thanasius didn&#39;t get a chance to do any Shakespearian snarking.</p>

If we accept the Sundering of Numenor as analogous to the mysterious disappearance of Mu, then it makes sense to have the Hawaiian islands as Numenorean.<br><br>Also also, where do the Pacific Islanders and Melanesians fit into all this?

            <p>Sneakily, you&#39;ve got a name which can be translated twice - by literal meaning, and by idiomatic meaning (yes, I <i>did</i> have to look it up).<br><br>&#39;Scape-grace&#39;, &#39;one who escapes from grace&#39;, can be rendered directly into Quenya as Usilissл, &#39;escaping (sweetness &gt;) grace&#39; (or more technically <i>Usilissello</i>, to get the &#39;from&#39; in there, but that&#39;s way too long). It&#39;s probably dual-meaning - both &#39;escaping from grace&#39; and &#39;grace escapes from&#39;. ;)<br><br>Sindarin doesn&#39;t have words directly glossed &#39;escape&#39; or &#39;grace&#39;. I went with &#39;bliss&#39;, which cross-references to &#39;fortune == final bliss&#39;. So you end up as Drevanadh, &#39;flees from fate&#39;. Sounds like a name for Turin. ^<em>^<br><br>Adunaic I&#39;ve decided to go with a less-literal translation, simply because of how poetic it is: <i>Ayaddazыlada</i>, &#39;went eastward&#39; (ie, away from Numenor and Aman). Seriously, say that a few times out loud - a-YAD-da-zu-LAD-da.<br><br>As for the Black Speech: Sauron loves to switch things around. So instead of escaping from grace, you would instead run <i>to</i> the Shadow: <i>Uburzum</i>, &#39;to darkness&#39;.<br><br>(Because I&#39;m always willing to trade for more languages. ^</em>^)<br><br>The theory/setting/whatnot is entirely up for interpretation: the only fact asserted in it is &#39;Middle-earth was in the Americas&#39;. I carefully wrote two sensible-sounding viewpoints in the &#39;threads&#39;, so people wouldn&#39;t read Word-Of-God into it.<br><br>The fact that Numenor was the mythical sunken continent is pretty inevitable - it was also Atlantis (just look at the words!), but its location was misunderstood by the elf zombies of Greece.<br><br>Pacific Islanders I&#39;d have to look into the timelines. I know Hawai&#39;i/the Meneltarma was resettled about AD 1, but I think the others are fairly archaic? That would imply that they&#39;re either lost Numenorean colonies, or elves - possibly from the Twilit Isles. It&#39;s all up for interpretation. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The best word I can come up with for &#39;rascal&#39; in Quenya is <i>Yaiwл</i>, &#39;mockery&#39; or &#39;scorn&#39;. It works okay as a standalone name. It also has a direct Sindarin cognate, <i>Iaew</i>, but I don&#39;t think that works as a name. Hкniaew or Iaewchen (both &#39;scorn-child&#39;) would kind of work, though they don&#39;t taste terribly nice. It might be best to concede to cliche and take Iaewen, &#39;scorn-maiden&#39;.<br><br>For Adunaic, you can have a nice short one: &#39;Nыph&#39; simply means &#39;fool&#39;. In the Black Speech, I know what name <i>others</i> would call a scape-grace: <i>Skai</i> is simply an unglossed insult.<br><br>And I forgot Valarin! :O That&#39;s unforgivable. The literal translation is <i>Akaљвnduљamanырвn</i>, &#39;the Law marred&#39;. The colloquial... hmm, how about Ruљurulu, &#39;fire-water&#39;, implying a contradiction? Or you could have Uruљebeth/Igaљebeth, &#39;fire/heat-air&#39; - which is to say, someone who speaks a lot of it!<br><br>(Valarin is always the hardest one, simply because the corpus is so tiny. Though actually, I can come up with at least three ways to call someone an idiot in Valarin, so maybe not...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Tau is... awkward, as far as conlangs go. There aren&#39;t that many words, and because GW is and continues to be GW, the construction and even vocabulary are somewhat inconsistent. That said, I was able to make a stab at it. Now, Tau naming conventions work thus: you get your caste, your planet of origin, and then a personal name. The closest I could find to a bird of <i>any</i> description is y&#39;eldi, a nickname given to skilled pilots that means &quot;winged one&quot;, and Shaserra is a personal name translating to Shadowsun, so I went with the longer part of the name as the bit meaning shadow. May I now present:<br><br><b>Gue&#39;por&#39;vre Fio&#39;gue Y&#39;eldiserra</b><br><i>(Human-Magister of Earth Shadow-of-winged-ones)</i><br><br>Now, because you did so many:<br><br>In the tongue of the Eldar, which has a bit more flesh on its (wraith)bones, I can cobble together a descriptor which you might care to use as a name. It is this:<br><br><b>Fhaisorr Amon</b><br><i>(Shadow-eagle, which sounds like it could well be an Aspect of Khaine)</i><br><br>And that&#39;s... pretty much it. Sorry I can&#39;t do more. =]</p>

            <p>I&#39;m guessing the whole name wouldn&#39;t be used every time!

            <p>The thread below sparked my interest, but when I clicked on it, it was about something else entirely to what I had thought it was.<br>So!<br><br>Have you guys considered doing missions in something different to just prose? <br>If someone&#39;s good at drawing, PPC comics could be a thing. And I briefly toyed with the idea of doing a radio play thing with my brother before he shot that down.

An epic PPC ballad detailing the tracking down and killing of a Sue! An interactive choose-your-own-adventure type thing! <br>Possibly a mission that&#39;s written in reverse chronological order because of a time-travel accident at the end (or beginning, depending on your point of view). <br><br>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>They weren&#39;t missions, but:<br><br>There are recorded Radio Plays of two of the three play scripts that hS wrote ages back. He may well still have them on a computer, or one of the people who went to one of the UK Gatherings after around that time will as well.

Not so sure anymore, since that&#39;s several computers ago.<br><br>I even made a Choose Your Own Adventure set in HQ that&#39;s ages old at this point (that I really need to find someway to get published again) that was eventually supposed to have a sequel indeed put in during a mission.<br><br>However, said CYOA was written and published way back in 2008 so it may well be some time before that ever happens, if it does...<br><br><br>-July, apparently as bad as hS</p>

            <p>I was just curious as why ye don&#39;t seem to experiment around with doing missions or something.<br><br>Like have an agent try to educate a Mary Sue (not sure which types of sues would fit the idea, probably the ocs) on how to fit better into canon and get annoyed at the sue&#39;s failures at doing so until they get it right or are so stubborn that they stop trying. It could plenty of heart-warming moments with a dash of comedy, and the Mary Sue can be punished like those in those University pieces ye are connected with for getting things badly wrong. <br><br>As I said, it is just a suggestion. The whole idea can still run on the rule of fun and funny. I&#39;d just like to see ye think outside the box and try experimenting with what you usually do around here.</p>

            <p>I like to see how much writers or any in a creative profession can experiment. As the Nostalgia Critic&#39;s version of Tim Burton put, and I paraphrase here, some risky ideas work, some don&#39;t, what counts is that you keep trying (which disappointing when I look at Sakamoto&#39;s case, in which he decided to give up on Metroid instead doing a reboot/remake of Other M or figuring out someway to fix the mistakes he made in its story) and folks will remember the better stuff than the worse stuff.<br><br>... unless you get really unlucky like M.

            <p>First, we don&#39;t write missions to every single badfic in existence.  That would be impossible.  Typically, people only choose badfic that makes for a good mission.  Maybe it makes them laugh, maybe it makes them angry, maybe it gives them an idea for a good plot point.  But it should be one that inspires you to write something good in some way.  <br><br>Second, and this is more a matter of opinion than Official PPC Policy (TM), but typically I only consider something to be badfic if it does whatever it&#39;s trying to do <i>poorly</i>.  It&#39;s why we have the Department of Bad Slash, not just the Department of Slash.  Even the DMS could theoretically be re-titled the Department of Bad OCs.  So if something breaks canon but does it in an interesting, well-written way, it&#39;s not necessarily badfic.<br><br>Third, most of the well-written fanfics that bend canon acknowledge that that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing and label it an AU (or a re-write, or an alternate interpretation, or a what-if scenario, or so on).  While that&#39;s not a magical &quot;Get-Out-of-Criticism-Free&quot; button, it also means that you need to accept the premise they&#39;re starting from.  <br><br>And finally, Twilight isn&#39;t exactly a very well-liked continuum, which is why there aren&#39;t a lot of missions to it despite its massive popularity, and the vast majority of them are crossovers.  So not a lot of people are necessarily going to be interested in doing a mission to a Twific in the first place.</p>

            <p>Or at least, I&#39;m not. But our sole province in terms of missions is badfic; what would be the point of trying to kill off goodfic for minor canon violations? It&#39;s not doing any harm, and if anything, it&#39;s helping to counterbalance the badfic influence everywhere. The PPC wants to <i>protect</i> the Plot Continuum, not shove it in a museum so nobody can touch it ever.<br><br>A few inaccuracies here and there in the service of an interesting, well-told story are completely acceptable. Since this original thread concerned Twilight, look at Luminosity by Alicorn. It&#39;s a much more intriguing look at Bella&#39;s inner workings than we got from her canonical self, who was (and let&#39;s be charitable) a total drip. It makes the canonical powers of the Volturi both more interesting and more threatening, always handy when writing villains. And lastly, what OCs are introduced are well-written and engaging with rounded, interesting characters and flaws that are actual flaws. It&#39;s a good time. But Bella is rather different in approach and sentiments to her canonical self, the Volturi are equally OOC even if their motivations are similar, and OCs generate plot holes when they pop up. So why hasn&#39;t anyone missioned it?<br><br>Because Luminosity is <i>good</i>. And that, in the end, is what we care about. =]</p>

            <p>Since the PPC is not a hivemind. (Nope. Not at all. Why are you even asking? Move along. Nothing to see here.)<br><br>Fics that don&#39;t just flesh out underdeveloped characters or add background, but actively change the characters, are guilty of breaking canon and, what&#39;s more, they do it knowingly in an attempt to &quot;fix&quot; the canon, which is disrespectful to the creator of the original work. Yes, even if said work is universally acknowledged to be bad, it is still the vision of its author and anyway, if people think it is so awful that it need &quot;fixing&quot; why are they reading it and writing about it in the first place? (Humorous parodies and/or reviews being the exception.) The &quot;fan&quot; in &quot;fanfic&quot; is there for a reason.<br><br>Okay, rant over.<br><br>However, if what comes out of it actually is a good story, we do not mission it. Why should we? For every fanfic that goes against canon and ends up being good, there are a boatload of others that do the same and end up atrocious. Since the PPC has limited resources both in-universe and IRL, they can&#39;t police everything and their time is much better spent killing fics that are both canon-breaking and awful.</p>

            <p>Great mission.  I&#39;ve never heard of Black Butler before.  But if it&#39;s got Inspector Abbeline in it, I&#39;ll have to check it out.<br><br>One small nitpicking point... When the CAD said &quot;Earl Ciel Phantomhive&quot;, that was wrong.  The correct name for an Earl would be &quot;Earl of Phantomhive&quot;, &quot;Lord of Phantomhive&quot;, or just &quot;Lord Phantomhive&quot;.  That&#39;s assuming Phantomhive is the name of his Earldom.  If it&#39;s his personal surname, you can call him something like &quot;Ciel, Earl Phantomhive of [wherever]&quot; but that&#39;s a bit of a mouthful so don&#39;t bother!<br><br>Anwyay, the important thing is, never get the name of his Earldom mixed up with his personal names.<br><br>But apart from that, it was a brilliant story.  Loved the cats, and the idea the POVs are minis.  And you made the setting clear enough that I could follow everything without knowing anything about the canon.<br></p>

            <p>Some thoughts:<br><br>---<br><br><i>&quot;Do you know how many non-working-class Black people lived in London back then?&quot;</i><br><br>Yes. Not many. However, there were a LOT of black servants around, generally freed slaves or their descendants. Which means Miguel could quite easily be wearing a suit, if a slightly lower-quality one. Makes him look like the help for Vi and Chris.<br><br>---<br><br><i>&quot;Also, the royal palace looked off, probably because the Sue had called it a castle.&quot;</i><br><br>I assume that&#39;s Buck House you&#39;re talking about? Because there&#39;s quite a lot of royal palaces in London, and none of them look like castles. Indeed, there&#39;s a perfectly serviceable fortress in there. It&#39;s got a big ol&#39; tower in it and it&#39;s in London. Hm. If only I could remember the blasted name... =]<br><br>(EDIT: Yes it is.)<br><br>---<br><br><i>Hayato POV</i><br><br>POVs are about half as big again as their lowercase counterpart, the pov. Instead of going &quot;snrf?&quot; they go &quot;Grnf.&quot; Additionally, rather than using the pov&#39;s method of scuttling up a character&#39;s back to perch on their head, the POV inflates itself with a lighter-than-air gas, presumably helium, and floats onto the character&#39;s head. Its frequent squeaky Grnfs are as a result of the gas leaking out, and its scuttly bits flail wildly in order to steer it in mid-air.<br><br>I am not a biologist.<br><br>I don&#39;t care.<br><br>Gimme the POV.<br><br>---<br><br><i>&quot;The cat—Ciel POV—looked Chris in the eye and swished his tail once.&quot;</i><br><br>So POVs are just minis?<br><br><img src="http://memecrunch.com/meme/PGRN/hsegi/image.jpg?w=400&amp;c=1"><br><br>---<br><br><i>&quot;She got her eye replaced!

            <p>First off, I&#39;m not familiar with Black Butler, so no commentary on that aspect of the story.  You did a good job explaining it to someone who only read a few chapters of it.<br><br>Typically mini-Sues are, like mini-Agents, tiny versions of the Sues.  I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m in favor of them being glittery versions of normal minis; while I like the idea of a Sue&#39;d  mini-Aragog or mini-Balrog, I&#39;m not entirely comfortable with the idea of hurting or killing glittery cats.  I am a little oversensitive about violence towards cute animals, especially cats, but that bothered me a bit.<br><br>I found this exchange kind of confusing: <br><i>“Wait, what? He was in character before!” Violet said in surprise. “Why the sudden spike?”<br><br>“For one thing, the plot said so,” Chris replied. “For another, Sues generally know the rules exist, but think they’re stupid-ass rules and elect to ignore them. As you should know.”</i><br>I think, after looking it over, that you meant Violet to be asking &quot;Why did the story have him act out of character?&quot; which is the question Chris is answering.  However, at first I thought she meant &quot;What did he do that made him suddenly become so OOC?&quot; making Chris&#39;s response kind of a non-sequitur.<br><br>I don&#39;t know the characters, so maybe I&#39;m not in a position to comment, but I think Ciel and Sebastian&#39;s responses to the agents killing Hayato seemed a little blasй.  I think most people would at least consider the possibility that the people attacking their ally were also a threat to them. <br><br>Other than those things, it was a good mission, and lots of fun to read.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your opinion! I went with the &quot;pink, glittery mini&quot; route for Hayato POV and Hayato Ansastu because the Sue never really described herself (or anything else, really) anywhere that I saw. (I have a real talent for finding beige-prose fics, don&#39;t I?)<br><br>Yeah, I guess Ciel and Sebastian would&#39;ve been a little more suspicious. That was what I was going for with his not-a-question about whether Miguel was fully human. (Honestly, to them, violence is a fact of life. My agents weren&#39;t angry with the nobility in general, either.) I&#39;ll keep your point in mind the next time something like this comes up on a mission.</p>

            <p>This is where you express interest in coming to Canterbury to meet PPCers. Canterbury is a smallish city in south-east England whose population is made up almost entirely of day-tripping French schoolchildren. There are Many Things To Do in Canterbury, all of them fun, some of them alcoholic.<br><br>To get to Canterbury from London, you want the trains out of Platform 11-13 at St Pancras International. Select the blue trains (High Speed 1) if you wish to get there in time for this year&#39;s Gathering; select the white trains if you wish to get there in time for next year&#39;s Gathering. There will be fun and frolics and Roman underfloor heating and possibly a museum dedicated to Rupert Bear if I can remember where the blasted thing is. Also a big stone shed full of Jeebus.<br><br>That&#39;s <i>basically</i> what a cathedral is, right?</p>

            <p>I-or-we should be able to make it, though which it is depends on the date.<br><br>So, in no particular order:<br><br>-What are Sunday opening hours like in Canterbury? Sunday would make it easier for me to drag Kaitlyn along.<br><br>-If we&#39;re doing August, the last two weekends would be our best options: I can get my parents to look after the children.

Kaitlyn might/should be free (at least for the afternoon), and the lack of school holidays might even make it possible to breathe in Canterbury.<br><br>Obviously in the last case, we&#39;d need to move quickly on the planning.

            <p>But then it would, living locally. =]<br><br>Where I planned to have everyone gather for the Gathering is at <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Canterbury+West/@51.28427,1.07533,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x74d4a56ca0064a0a">Canterbury West station</a>.

Part of the problem I have is that weekends are the busiest times for me because of all the little darlings running around kicking lumps out of my vintage arcades and having tantrums because they&#39;re not very good at it and trying to pull the machines over in groups of ten burn them burn them BURN THEM ALL, so yeah. August is probably going to be completely nuts for me. September less so, because back at school and theme parks are seasonal, but still.<br><br>Hopefully that&#39;s reasonably comprehensive. =]</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve just confirmed my other plans for that weekend, and they are for the 12th, so yeah, the Saturday works for me.<br><br>Given the distance involved I&#39;ll probably take the train.

I&#39;d like a brief snippet on the personality of your fanwriter alter-ego, if ya don&#39;t mind, with pertinent info such as your Disney LO and your favorite Prince, Princess, and Villain. In fact, even if you don&#39;t want to sign up, I would love a quick poll of favorite characters in the Disneyverse. Thanks! <br><br>-Miss <s>Tai&#39;shar</s> Alleb</p>

The Hiccup-Merida-Jack Frost-Elsa-Rapunzel all at Hogwarts, kind of thing. She&#39;s well meaning, but has a tendency to sucker onto an idea, write a bit of it, and then drop it for a new variation. As such, she rarely sticks with a project long enough to learn from it. <br>Appearance: Short, somewhat curly red-brown hair, grey eyes, and fair skin. She&#39;s also rather a beanpole in terms of body type.<br><br>LO: Esmerelda (not technically a Princess, but still!)<br>Favorite Prince: Hans - he&#39;s not a hero, but at least he has a character and is kind of a fun villain<br>Favorite Princess: Merida or Elsa<br>Favorite Villain: Maleficent, especially after the new adaptation.<br><br>(As for me, I am having some trouble thinking of an LO in the Disney canon, my favorite princess might be Mulan, I can&#39;t really think of a prince because they are rather dull, and Ursula is just so very fun as a villain.)</p>

The truth is that she&#39;s still a huge fan, but she feels like she&#39;s supposed to be too old for them.  She complains that the stories as-are are &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;dumb,&quot; and the female characters &quot;suck&quot; because they don&#39;t do any fighting.  She also has an unfortunate tendency to act superior and ignore anyone who corrects her.  Nick&#39;s stories are technically fine and feature decent action scenes, but generally take the form of thinly-veiled diatribes about how the movies would be so much better if they went exactly the way she wanted them to.<br><br>Also, if you&#39;re just doing Disney Princesses, you might want to indicate that somewhere in the title of your OFU?</p>

Light gray eyes. <br>Common Mannerisms: Bites nails, occasional hand-flapping.<br>Lust Object: (This is a hard one. Elsa or New!Maleficent?) Let&#39;s go with Elsa.<br>Favorite Princess: Does a queen count? If so, Elsa. If not, Anna.<br>Favorite Prince: Hans. (She dislikes the &#39;nice&#39; princes.)<br>Favorite Villain: Maleficent.<br>Personality: Cracks under pressure easily -- probably one of the first to break down crying and apologizing. Embarrasses easily. Very friendly. Finds it extremely hard to lie. Probably would see this as an opportunity if she wasn&#39;t so horribly embarrassed about having to attend. Drools all over the female villains (though not quite as much as with Elsa, of course.) Over-explains. <br>Likely Crimes Against Canon: Has a decent grasp of grammar, surprisingly -- the crimes would probably be heinously OOC femslash villain-shipping and having self-inserts go after Elsa. Probably after Villain!Elsa. Terrible at description. Shoving bizarre headcanons where they don&#39;t fit.<br><br>(Yes, I used to be a fanbrat. No, this isn&#39;t exactly how I was -- more a mix of how I was then and how I am now, with all the writing-improvement removed. I was *always* a fangirl for villains, though. Still am.

            <p>Ellie really doesn&#39;t like using contractions and abbreviations, and they only come out in times of extreme stress. She&#39;s... not exactly snobbish, per se? But she&#39;s very self-conscious, and the way she combats it is through speaking in a rather stilted, overly-literal manner, which can easily be confused for snobbery. She&#39;s very much a self-insert writer, with very little regard for canon - but the difference is, again, that it&#39;s deliberate. They&#39;re wish-fulfillment stories that allow her to cope with her &quot;demons&quot;, they only exist to carry out that one particular purpose, so frankly what could it possibly <i>matter</i> if they details aren&#39;t exactly right? It defeats the object of the exercise as she sees it.<br><br>I used to be like that. I kid myself into thinking I&#39;m better now. =]<br><br>Also, given that Elsa is one of the bloody X-Men, I think that she&#39;d probably find work as campus security or its analogue.

            <p>Dylan wouldn&#39;t be much for actually writing fanfic; he wrote one once for a different universe (coughmdnightgreengahack), and after it turned out really bad, he kinda swore off of it.<br><br>It&#39;d probably take some effort to convince him that he could conceivably write goodfic.</p>

            <p>Yeah... based on what happened yesterday?

He&#39;s a hyperactive motormouth that never stops talking about stuff he likes, specially if it&#39;s about robots or other technological stuff, which annoys mostly everyone. He never stays put, even when sleeping, in fact he moves a lot in his sleep and occasionally sleepwalks. He seems to believe that magic is real, and claims to have seen it in work, though that might be due to his hiperactive imagination.  He&#39;s also quite unfamiliar with social cues and social interaction, he says it&#39;s because he rarely got out of home when he was youger and never liked to socialize with kids at school.  Nobody really knows why he&#39;s in the DOFA, it&#39;s said he arrived here when one of the stories he wrote, had a plothole too much...</p>

            <p>I noticed that the Borg have armour plating on their bodies, that, according to Memory Alpha, allows them to survive in space. Is it supposed to protect them from vacuum, however? I can&#39;t imagine it does, because in First Contact we see several drones on the outside of the Enterprise, without EVA suits. However, their eyes were completely intact! They weren&#39;t even wearing helmets.<br><br>I know this must seem trivial, but it&#39;s important to the backstory of a character in one of my fanfics, and I don&#39;t have time to do proper research.</p>

            <p>Which is to say, mass pushing against mass. After all, Picard guns down two of them in a holodeck with the safeties off. And I mean they had about a hundred rounds pumped into them, not just one or two shots, so they would have had plenty of time to adapt. I&#39;ll probably just attribute it to nanoprobes, like they did with all of Seven&#39;s stuff.

            <p>And not completely incorrect on the first one. It was Worf who had a couple of phaser rifle augmentations, but the first one was good for only twelve shots(Likely distributed throughout the team), and the second was good for a whopping-single shot. On that note, do you think it would be a good idea to use various sharp and blunt objects against the Borg, like batons or machetes? Again, this is for the fic I&#39;m writing, and it&#39;s good to have a Trek fan who can take things seriously. (You should see the people I normally ask stuff like this.

            <p>Generally I would say sharp over blunt - Worf&#39;s mek&#39;leth was effective in First Contact, and I&#39;d imagine a blunt item would simply bounce off the exoplating unless the wielder was very strong indeed.<br><br>Also, in Star Trek Online, anything that deals physical or kinetic damage they cannot adapt to. The only problem is if you choose to use a sword or similar melee weapon against the Borg... you&#39;re in melee range of the Borg, which means assimilation range.<br><br>Now if one used something like a crossbow or longbow, that might be very effective.</p>

            <p>So, this one is about the Left Behind series of &quot;Christian&quot; fiction (I use quotes because the LB god is literally worse than satan). Basically it&#39;s a chronicle of the Rapture and Tribulation written by and for people who believe that it will actually happen Any Day Now.<br><br>As you probably know, Fred Clark from Slacktivist has been doing a sporking of the series for more than 10 years.

This has, among other things, caused me to read the New Testament front to back... in Latin.<br><br>Turns out that yes, there are loopholes. The result of my efforts have been turned into a RPG setting, rather than a linear story, and may be found at <a href="http://emlia.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Tripocalypse.Tripocalypse"><a href="http://emlia.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Tripocalypse.Tripocalypse">http://emlia.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Tripocalypse.Tripocalypse</a></a><br><br>There are a few games in progress, which I&#39;d be happy to narrate.<br><br>Please let me know if I did it right!<br><br></p>

            <p>Which saddens me, because I love dystopian stuff in general and I&#39;m a Christian, so it would be right up my alley... But I&#39;ve read plenty and I&#39;ve never seen it done right.<br><br>You&#39;d think it would be really easy. It&#39;s certainly tempting. Revelation has the plot right there for you--good guys, bad guys, monsters, natural disasters, and even a relatively happy ending. But that&#39;s also part of the problem. Depending on how literally you take it, now you have to try to tell a story that&#39;s already been written, in ancient poetic language, but tell it in the modern or future era in realistic writing.<br><br>The result seems to be a narrative completely overrun by plot holes as the authors assume that just because it fits into the Revelation narrative, they can declare that it happens in the modern world and they don&#39;t have to justify its causes or effects. Everything becomes one gigantic deus ex machina, and in the conversion God becomes so inconsistent, capricious, and downright insane that you could mistake him for a three-year-old stomping on a sand castle. People become statistics, the heroes become incorruptible and the villains irredeemable. It&#39;s generally a huge mess.<br><br>The best apocalyptic fiction I&#39;ve seen haven&#39;t been sweeping whole-world narratives; they&#39;ve been short stories, snapshots of what a world in such turmoil might look like, focused in on individual people just trying to survive and do the right thing in the middle of an apocalypse that&#39;s as much human-caused as anything else.<br><br>But those are few and far between. I&#39;ve given up on it, mostly. People seem to think that just because something&#39;s religious, you don&#39;t have to write well.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that&#39;s really a problem with a lot of Christian work... people think that just because it&#39;s got a Jesus fish on it, it has a market, so quality is not necessary. Just look at Christian videogames!<br><br>As for my RPG setting, I&#39;m trying to make it clear that the Christian Remnant are not the bad guys; arguably TurboJesus is the bad guy, in that he wanted to destroy the earth, but he&#39;s been contained so that&#39;s not a problem -- what I wanted to do was generate a post-apocalyptic setting that is, at least tentatively, on the way to recovery; it&#39;s intended to be an optimistic setting that leaves room for players to do all sort of things (help with the reconstruction, go monster hunting, carve their own little city-state out of the ruins, go sailing and fight Kaiju, et cetera).<br><br>Could you give me a hand in making sure it&#39;s understood that Christian Remannt are just another group, and not evil?</p>

            <p>The whole &quot;Left Behind&quot; series has Christians acting in a very unrealistically callous way toward suffering people. Seems to me that the Remnant would, like any other group of human beings, want to help each other. Some of them might even start to compare TurboJesus to the actual Jesus of the Bible and see the very real differences between the two. <br><br>Sooner or later, someone will conclude that they&#39;re not the same person, and there&#39;ll probably be a schism. People will start saying; &quot;He can&#39;t be God; he&#39;s obviously not omnipotent if they can trap him!&quot;, and, &quot;This is not the same person who preached the Sermon on the Mount&quot;. Amidst all that, there&#39;ll be decent, everyday Christians going on with their lives, following love-your-neighbor as a guiding principle because that was part of what attracted them to Christianity to begin with. And now they have to deal with the reality of a world that can be changed basically by thinking hard enough at it... </p>

            <p>They just kind of sit around and support each other, instead of helping the suffering people. There&#39;s no effort to do anything but proselytize. Like, they just kind of treat the chaos and horribleness as an obstacle they have to survive.

            <p>Here in Ohio, most people will do things like help each other dig their cars out of snowbanks, because that&#39;s just what you *do*; the snow is a common enemy when everyone is trying to get somewhere.<br><br>And when there&#39;s a disaster, that tendency is magnified. When threatened, people want to help each other so instinctively that it feels completely natural to help a perfect stranger. The more obvious the problem is, the more you feel responsible for helping (especially if you are the only one there), and the more easily you can think of a way to help, the more likely you are to do something useful.<br><br>If Buck were a real person rather than a badly-written character, he absolutely would help out. Depending on his training, he could help administer first aid, commandeer a baggage cart as an ad hoc ambulance for those too hurt to walk, or simply grab the nearest struggling individual and help them to the terminal. And it would make for a great story afterwards, too.<br><br>When a crisis is huge and right in your face, people don&#39;t generally just walk away. They might not act at first; if they don&#39;t know what to do, they may stand there staring indecisively until someone figures things out and starts doing something or giving orders. At worst, they get confused and do stupid things trying to help, sometimes adding to the casualties. At best, they work together as though they&#39;d been practicing for years. But they don&#39;t just walk away.</p>

            <p>At the same time, I&#39;m going to go with that only the &quot;Trib Force&quot; folk are sociopathic -- Rayford Steele makes a good villain, especially if his narrative causality makes NPCs automatically think he&#39;s as handsome, smart, etc. as he thinks he is -- but my experience with evangelical Christians is that they may believe strange things about biology or astronomy, but they&#39;re good people, by and large.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s an odd culture, to be sure; I didn&#39;t realize exactly how odd until I had left it. They still believe things like dinosaurs dying in Noah&#39;s flood or being able to dig straight down and hit Hell. They&#39;re more likely to be dogmatic and rigid in their beliefs. But as far as their basic humanity goes, you may expect them to be just as decent as any other group of people. They often struggle with guilt and feel persecuted, and can be quite out of touch with the culture around them. Some are fundamentalists because it is so reassuring to them to have every question answered and everything in black and white. All of that is just plain human nature, however unusually it&#39;s expressed.</p>

            <p>... I&#39;ve once read a MLP:FiM apocalyptic fanfiction. Yes, that was the Christian apocalypse, on Earth. Well, except for the fact that the Christian God was replaced by dragon gods straight out of the author&#39;s own UPG pantheon. Oh, and Discord is the Antichrist, and the Mane 6 get to Earth, and the author&#39;s self-insert character (well, based on his &quot;spirit animal&quot;) is a shaman coyote who has spent 21 years on Earth unnoticed (and gets an eyepatch later due to a raptor attack)...<br><br>... It was actually somewhat less bad than you&#39;d expect. I think. I read it a while ago, and I found it awesome, but I had terrible taste in fanfic and I don&#39;t really have the time to read it again now.<br><a href="https://mlpfictions.com/story/366/discors-consentus">Here&#39;s a link</a>, but it&#39;s in French.</p>

            <p>That looks delightfully random... and I can actually see Discord as the Antichrist, if you depict the Antichrist as someone who is trying to derail prophecy (and thus save the world).<br><br>Derailing prophecy is exactly the right job for the embodiment of chaos.</p>

            <p>It sounds simple, but it still gets overlooked. <br><br>The classic &#39;tenth walker&#39;-style Sue will join up with the canon characters and go through their adventures, because that&#39;s what the plot of the canon was. And the canon characters will allow them to do this because that&#39;s what the fanfic plot requires. Regardless of whether allowing a stranger to tag along is a good idea, and sometime even with the stranger having no real motivation to join up with them. Motivation is an important part of characterisation. <br><br>Sues have previously been described here as &#39;unintentionally flat&#39; characters.  I.e. characters with no depth beyond a bare minimum. Some Sues have a tendency to be nothing more than physical descriptions with a collection of powers/abilities. Flat characters aren&#39;t necessarily a Bad Thing - they can be useful in certain contexts: the faceless masses in the background, the NPCs populating game towns so that they don&#39;t look deserted, etc. <br><br>If your characters are in a bar, and they mention the barman, that&#39;s probably enough detail and characterisation for him (as long as he exists just to serve the other characters their drinks). A physical description could add a bit of flavour to the scene, but isn&#39;t always necessary. You can get away introducing background characters just with the role they are playing in the story - you can&#39;t get away with introducing someone as &#39;the/a protagonist&#39; and expecting your readers to take your word for it.  <br><br>They need a reason for what they do, and they need to react believably to the things that happen to them, and the people they encounter. Also, the people that they encounter should react believably to <i>them</i> (when they don&#39;t, PPC agents start talking about people being thrown out of character). <br><br>It&#39;s hard to have a decent character without having characterisation. Think about their likes and dislikes, their hope and fears. And think about why they do what they do.  <br><br>If their reactions to story events are dictated by the requirements of the future plot (or in the case of tenth walker style stories, the requirements of <i>someone else&#39;s</i> future plot), then those characters are pretty weak (in narrative terms, nothing to do with physical strength). If, on the other hand, their reactions are dictated by their personality - they do those actions / make those choices because that is what they would do, then you&#39;ve got yourself much better characters. <br><br>Exactly what makes a Sue is a very complex topic, so avoiding Sues is a fairly complex task. And there are plenty of other things to consider outside of the stuff that I&#39;ve just talked about, but giving a character a proper personality is a damn good starting point for ensuring they don&#39;t end up a Sue. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>Honestly, this is the kind of question that doesn&#39;t have a single answer.  While extremely obvious Sues are fairly easy to avoid - don&#39;t make your character the best swordsman ever or so beautiful it&#39;s a curse - these are in the end the symptoms, not the cause.  <br><br>A few random tips:<br><ul>
<li>Let your characters be hurt by their flaws.  Frequently Sues will have flaws that make them appear &quot;cool,&quot; such as a bad temper or a tendency to mouth off, but they&#39;ll never get unjustifiably angry or insult the wrong person.<br>
</li>
<li>Don&#39;t be afraid to let bad things happen to your characters or have them make mistakes.  Coddling can easily turn a well-written character into a Sue.<br>
</li>
<li>Try not to take any criticism of your character personally.  This can be especially hard if your character tends towards self-insertion, as it can sometimes feel like a personal slam.  But getting indignant on your character&#39;s behalf will only hurt your ability to develop them.<br>

            <p>Let me just use Valon as an example.

His acrophobia shows up in Of Stus Gone By, and he&#39;s completely incapacitated until he&#39;s both on solid ground and has taken Bleeprin.<br><br>With his impulsivity, look no further than Of Slashy Stus. He fails to think through the fact that a dragon might, just <i>might</i>, be immune to fire.<br><br>As for his CHS, well, my Plans originally involved it getting him killed.

            <p>Now, we can start to move on from this topic. I mean, we have a few years, but son we can start to move on to actually important things, like how we are going to encourage manufacturing here in America, or how we are going to handle the intelligence gathering we have been doing, rather than if two consenting adults want to live together and be recognised for it!<br><br>I know it seems like I am dismissing how important this is for many people. I am not. I am thrilled for my homosexual brothers and sisters. I just thought the answer was so obvious, we would have been able to move on by now.<br><br>Now, as for the discussion we are having below... I&#39;ll get to that later on.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll chip in my two cents on the issue.  I think it was the right result and I also think that the legal reasoning is adequate.  I am a little disappointed that Chief Justice Roberts did not join the majority.  As a 5-4 decision, they are always subject to attack, a 6-3 would have been more authoritative.    I am also disappointed that it took this long.  A few years ago the Court faced the same issue in <i>Windsor</i>, but they kept their holding narrow.  The fact is that all of the law that Justice Kennedy cited existed at the time of <i>Windsor</i> and had not changed.<br><br>I will say though, that from a jurisprudential standpoint, the dissent was not wrong at least with regard to that this decision was taken out of the hands of the public.  Scalia was not wrong when he said that this decision had the Court acting as a Super-Legislature.  Though I do not think the situation is as dire as the dissent makes out.  The Court has acted in that way since its inception, so I think it is over stating the risk.<br><br>Then last comment on this, I am disappointed in Chief Justice Roberts&#39; dissent.  The first problem was he cited to the <i>Dred Scott</i> case.  Which was superseded by Constitutional Amendment, namely the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments.  You do yourself no favors when you cite to the case that found slavery constitutional.  And then he brought up the slippery-slope argument.  These are just bad legal arguments to make.  Because it means that neither the facts, nor the law is on your side.    </p>

            <p>I&#39;m genuinely curious.<br><br>If your objections are politically motivated, and your concern is that federal government doing what federal government is supposed to do, then I can&#39;t help you. Small-government, corporatist conservatism is anathema to my own beliefs, and anything I say on the subject is biased in favour of those beliefs. I will say, however, that the economics of scarcity that fuel right-wing capitalist ideology are by their very nature finite; these economic structures, and by extension the corporations whose existence they prop up, will eventually go away - and with them will go a lot of the impetus behind social conservatism, because there simply will not be the same level of vested interest in maintaining an unequal status quo.<br><br>If it&#39;s religious, I&#39;m rather more sanguine about things. The old order of churches is, as far as I&#39;m concerned, just getting in the way at this point. While I of course respect the rights of the religious to practice their faith however they choose, I do draw the line at them getting to dictate secular government policy. Not everyone shares your Christian faith. Hell, not all <i>Christians</i> share your Christian faith. I daresay if you met a Leveller or Cathar you&#39;d find their beliefs and politics entirely antithetical to your own, and don&#39;t get me started on the spat between mono- and diphysitism. Equality means people being equal, and that means the queer community getting the same rights and privileges as the religious one. That means marriage. That means legislation against discrimination. That means, in short, treating all the citizens of the world as equal.<br><br>Let me make something absolutely clear: LGBT* marriage equality is a <i>start</i>. Social progressivism doesn&#39;t win until we stop talking about white men who shoot up black churches as &quot;troubled loners&quot; who had &quot;lots of black friends&quot; in high school, until the suicide rates among teens is equal regardless of trans status, until there are no more martyrs. That&#39;s what this is a part of. No more people dying for things they cannot avoid.<br><br>Except gingers. Man, screw gingers. =] </p>

            <p>Yes, it is for religious reasons, and yes, I understand that there is divisions among Christians on this issue. But I view same-sex marriage as wrong, believing that marriage should be between man and woman only as Biblically ordained. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m going to hate and despise homosexuals.

            <p>To put this succinctly without saying what I think is wrong with religion (because a) that&#39;s a can of worms I don&#39;t want to open, b) it&#39;ll take a lot of time and c) nothing good will come out of it), you&#39;ve a right to believe whatever you want. You don&#39;t have a right to force that belief on others any more than others have a right to force their beliefs on you. Therefore, you can think it&#39;s wrong if that&#39;s what you believe, you can hate gays if that&#39;s what gives you your kicks, but you cannot prevent them from marrying. Think about it this way: what would you do if the boot was on the other foot, so to speak, and it was religious marriage that the SCOTUS ruled to legalise after years of discrimination, and someone would have said they&#39;re horrified?</p>

According to Leviticus, you&#39;re nothing but a slave for making babies, to be broken and thrown away at leisure. You have a house? Get rid of it; women aren&#39;t supposed to own land. Helping your husband fight off a home invader? Better learn to cook one-handed; you&#39;re getting a hand cut off. Have sex before marriage, even if you were freaking <i>raped!?</i> It&#39;s your fault and you&#39;re being put to death.<br><br>Isn&#39;t that horrifying? That&#39;s all from the Book of Leviticus. <i>God was telling people to do this.</i><br><br>He obviously mellowed out by the New Testament; Jesus taught us to love everyone, women got their own rights, and everyone agreed that the victim shouldn&#39;t be punished for rape.<br><br>And yet people still think that homosexuality is an abomination.<br><br>You can&#39;t pick and choose here. Either you follow all of Leviticus&#39; strictures, or you follow none of them.<br><br>There&#39;s a reason I left the church.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry if this seems unnecessarily angry and hostile, but this is a subject that just really gets me going.</p>

            <p>A lot of things get me going, and I rant with a vengeance. <br><br>However, the Bible also talks about homosexuality in the New Testament. Romans One and Corinthians Six. I would recommend using a newer translation for the latter, though, because the word in the KJV is &quot;effeminate.&quot; Newer translations have a different wording to avoid confusion. <br><br>Also, the line about rape is not valid, as far as I know. One of King David&#39;s sons raped his half-sister, which started a war, but as far as I know the only thing that happened to the poor girl was that she wore different clothes. The war was actually one of David&#39;s consequences for his polygamy, if I&#39;m remembering correctly. <br></p>

            <p>Most current translations have him repeatedly talk about homosexuality as a sin, but some argue that it might have been about paedophilia or more generic sexual perversion.<br>I&#39;m personally not convinced, and think he was indeed talking about homosexuality in at least some parts of his writing.

            <p>... so I&#39;m relying on others scholarship here rather than my own, but if I recall correctly, the particular words that Paul uses in his various lists of sins are used nowhere else in the Bible and are not the &#39;usual&#39; words used at the time to describe men having sex with men. (I deliberately don&#39;t use the term &#39;homosexuality&#39; because it&#39;s really a modern-ish concept of orientation as opposed to behaviour).<br><br>One possible interpretation of them is as a catch-all reference to all same-sex behavior, however it&#39;s also possible that the reference is to more specific situations.

            <p>&quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; is a term used mainly by Christians. It&#39;s a common idea in modern (and American) Christian society that Jews are basically... uh... Christians without the whole &quot;Jesus&quot; bit. That Jews are just sitting around waiting for a Messiah, because they don&#39;t realize he already came. That&#39;s actually not even remotely how it is, though, and it&#39;s a pretty insulting view of the Judaic religion and culture.<br><br>The Christian idea of what Judaism is is <i>radically</i> different from what Judaism actually is - as Desdendelle (or Maslab, if he was still around), I&#39;m sure, could tell you far better than I could. I highly recommend you do some research of your own by talking to actual rabbis, rather than taking Christians&#39; word for what another religion is all about.</p>

            <p>So. You obviously don&#39;t subscribe to it yourself, but a lot of Christians think that gay people should be exterminated.<br><br>While that&#39;s horrible on a general level, I can understand it a bit more deeply, because people like me were sometimes treated similarly not two hundred years ago.<br><br>I&#39;m autistic.

            <p>So I understand completely. I went through the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. I would have died in WW2 as well, since I was born early = disabled. Also, look to my argument where God teaches people in stages. It takes a long time for people to change traditions, and God is patient enough, knowing we&#39;re His stubborn kids. Just because I&#39;m a Christian does not mean I&#39;m using the &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; standing. We sin even after becoming Christians, and it&#39;s better to acknowledge that and learn from the past.</p>

            <p>If you do not mind, I would like to pose a question to you.  It is similar to one that was posed to me a few years back, at a time when I thought similarly.<br><br>So you obviously see marriage as fundamentally religious then.  But why?  Look at it from a historical perspective marriage was primarily (and in some places still is) arranged and made for political or personal gain.  Daughters were little more than tools.  So is it really religious in nature?<br><br>Now to take is a step further, marriage itself, is essentially a government benefit.  It is economic in nature.  It provides tax breaks, certain support rights, and other gains provided by the government or by operation of law.  So again I ask is it really religious?  Or is it an institution created by governments?<br><br>You do not have to answer if you do not want to, and I certainly am not trying to change your mind.  It is just something to think about.</p>

            <p>Granted, the <i>motivations</i> for marriage may have differed over the centuries (e.g., for love, for political gain, etc), however, the <i>nature</i> of marriage has not: one man joining one woman and creating a new family unit that is distinct (albeit not totally separate) from the ones that the spouses came from.<br><br>That said, the question of whether marriage is religious or secular takes on a whole new meaning.<br><br>We social conservatives (among whom are conservative Christians) view marriage thus: it is an institution that predates even the concept of the State. The state did not create the institution of marriage, its functions <i>vis-а-vis</i> marriage are in <i>recognition</i> of the institution: it recognizes marriages and helps enforce its concomitant rights and responsibilities. (This explains, for example, why the State historically required grounds for divorce.) As marriage predates the State, and was not created by it, the State has no power to redefine what a marriage is.<br><br>However, since social liberals (among whom are not a few atheists) see the State as the be-all and end-all, it only makes sense that they believe that marriage is a creation of the state. From that foundation, of course the State can redefine marriage if &quot;progress&quot; so requires!</p>

            <p>In many pre-Roman cultures in the Western world, (including several mythic figures mentioned in the Old Testament), one man married to multiple wives was pretty much the standard.<br><br>The American Indian* concept of marriage varies from culture group to culture group, but I can&#39;t recall a single group that saw marriage the way you&#39;re defining it here. Many groups (especially those with a strong agricultural tradition) had the concept of matrilineal descent - in marriages that were heterosexual, the children did <i>not</i> go to the father&#39;s clan, but to the mother&#39;s - they were raised mainly by their mother&#39;s family, brothers, sisters, and grandparents. Gender was not seen as a binary, mutually exclusive concept; there are several cases of women who were warriors and hunters taking wives.<br><br>What&#39;s really frustrating about the idea that marriage hasn&#39;t changed in centuries is that historically, it hasn&#39;t even stayed the same in America. The 17th and 18th century were notorious for marriage being a fairly fluid concept (as in, lots of divorce and moving in/out, lots of different marriages was kind of the norm), and in some of the communes that came out of the First and Second Great Awakenings, marriage was a community sort of affair - or abolished outright. Marriage has changed over and over and over again in the course of human history - even a cursory look at history will demonstrate that.<br><br>You are correct that marriage predates the American state. We see it as a religious institution <i>that is recognized by the state</i>. Therefore, the state <i>absolutely</i> gets to decide what kind of marriage to recognize. Just like churches get to decide what kind of marriages to recognize.</p>

Nowhere in my post did I say that the Christian God created marriage (though that is what I, as a Christian, believe): I said that marriage predates the state. And though the concept is easier to believe if you are religious, one does not specifically have to be a Christian to believe it.<br><br>In fact, your very own words help to lend credence to <i>me</i>: one could go to Japan or Rome, and even though the words or the motivations may be different, the concepts of &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife&quot; were universal. How could it be that this institution could be so universally understood unless its roots went deeper than even the divisions between ethnic groups? So it does not matter whether you believe that the first married couple was Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden or some couple of cavepeople that hit the hay one day and decided to live together thenceforth (а la modern-day &quot;common-law marriage&quot;).<br><br>Unless I am missing some context, I believe that I just answered your first paragraph and voided the second.</p>

            <p>Let me get specifically at this universal definition.  There has been in several indigenous cultures this concept of a &quot;Twin Soul&quot;, I think it was it loosely translates to, where it was a recognized same-sex union.  Not to mention in Greece, how it was specifically encouraged (particularly among the Spartans).  There really has not been one universal definition.  Marriage was not marriage until the State gave some credence for it.  It was the legal definitions that conveyed certain benefits, and made it marriage.  <br><br>Prehistory it was no different than how other animals view relationships, or in other words it was not a relationship.  It was a means to an end.  It was the rise of civilization that created this thing marriage as an institution. It was the State deciding this union had some value, namely inheritance is easier, child legitimacy is easier to determine, better tax revenues, etc.  The only reason it was really defined by the State originally as Man-Woman was because of very rigidly designed and defined gender roles.  Remember for many of these cultures women were there to basically do housework and pump out babies.  Further if you look to more women dominated cultures, for many of them there was no real marriage as it is understood by contemporaries.  </p>

            <p>Because frankly, I am tired of discussing it.  Maya, Aztec, Olmec, Inca, and Illiniwek, all have some variation of it.

            <p>It is important to distinguish between incestuous relationships prior to God commanding against them (Leviticus 18:6-18) and incest that occurred after God’s commands had been revealed. Until God commanded against it, it was not incest. It was just marrying a close relative. It is undeniable that God allowed incest in the early centuries of humanity. If Adam and Eve were indeed the only two human beings God created, their sons and daughters would have had no other choice but to marry and reproduce with their siblings and close relatives. The second generation would have had to marry their cousins, just as after the flood the grandchildren of Noah would have had to intermarry amongst their cousins. The reason incest is so strongly discouraged in the world today is the understanding that reproduction between closely related individuals has a much higher risk of causing genetic abnormalities. In the early days of humanity, though, this was not a risk due to the fact that the human genetic code was relatively free of defects.<br><br>Read more: <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/incest-in-the-Bible.html#ixzz3eJDTziIu"><a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/incest-in-the-Bible.html#ixzz3eJDTziIu">http://www.gotquestions.org/incest-in-the-Bible.html#ixzz3eJDTziIu</a></a></p>

            <p>but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true. I mean, I could argue evolution until the cows come home, honestly. But Genesis tells what God did, and (with the exception of Revelations) it&#39;s fairly clear when the Bible is being literal and when it&#39;s using figurative language. The Genesis account is meant to be literal, to the extent of my knowledge, and the knowledge of many heads much wiser than mine. </p>

            <p>Doesn&#39;t Genesis contain two separate creation accounts?  Both are at least partially inconsistent?  Also keep in mind, from a religious standpoint, Pope Francis is the head of Roman Catholic Church.<br><br>But then going on to the actual science part of it, as SeaTurtle below points out, there is a huge amount of scientific evidence that supports evolution.</p>

            <p>There is overwhelming proof of the mechanism behind evolution and it&#39;s prominently featured in natural history museums all over the world. Scientists have rigouroulsly fact-checked each other&#39;s work and made sure that they&#39;re publishing the most accurate information possible. Why is only one 2000+ year old book all the evidence you need to discredit volumes upon volumes of data collected using the cutting edge of technology?<br><br>Speaking of which, who peer reviewed the Bible?</p>

            <p>Stopping now? I&#39;ve been in a lot of similar debates, and they never get anywhere. The religious person basically says, &quot;God wrote the Bible and He cannot err, therefore what the Bible says is fact&quot;, and arguing with such an argument is pointless; it&#39;s a disagreement about postulates, not anything you can apply logic and/or reason to.  </p>

            <p>Since he can do that better than me. What I will do is say a couple things about the Bible itself:<br><br>The Bible is in no way coherent. There are two Creation stories, two accounts of the Ten Commandments, and that&#39;s just for starters. That&#39;s about as coherent as saying &quot;I love you&quot; while stabbing someone&#39;s face. <br><br>It also doesn&#39;t meet criteria for reliable historical documents like cross-referencing — bits and pieces of it do, but other parts, not so much. <br><br>Also, as an aside, whatever English translation you&#39;re bound to be using is going to be choke-full of mistranslations and other goofs. Let&#39;s take your own ASV and look at Isaiah 7:14. It reads, &quot;Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.&quot;<br>That&#39;s blarney. The Hebrew text says,<br><p dir="rtl">לָכֵן יִתֵּן אֲדֹנָי הוּא, לָכֶם--אוֹת:  הִנֵּה הָעַלְמָה, הָרָה וְיֹלֶדֶת בֵּן, וְקָרָאת שְׁמוֹ, עִמָּנוּ אֵל. </p>
<br>One important difference: הָעַלְמָה means &#39;young woman&#39;, not virgin. <br>Therefore, saying that the Bible — especially the Bible you&#39;re going by — is a &quot;completely sound&quot; book is false.<br><br>Now I&#39;ll shut up and go hit my head on the wall because debating religion with religious people is a stupid idea.</p>

            <p>Seriously? You haven&#39;t read the Bible as closely as you think. <br>The first Creation story can be found in Genesis 1-2:1-3. The second comes immediately afterwards, from Genesis 2:4 till, roughly, Genesis 2:23.<br>The first account of the Ten Commandments can be found in Exodus 20:8-14. The second account can be found in Deuteronomy 5:6-18.<br>Those accounts aren&#39;t even identical!<br><br>As to translation issues, if the Bible was just another book, they wouldn&#39;t have been such a big deal, but since it&#39;s purportedly the Word of God, you cannot dismiss them as &quot;dynamic equivalence&quot;, especially when plainly wrong translations are involved.<br><br>Last but not least: saying that &quot;it&#39;s true and I know so&quot; means that arguing with you is a waste of time; it means you won&#39;t change your opinion, no matter what; you&#39;re blind to whatever&#39;s out there.<br><br>Oh, also: I don&#39;t actually hurt myself, no more than a person who goes to punch his pillow does. </p>

            <p>I was trying to make a joke. <br><br>Yeah, just looked at a Bible, you were right. Two accounts, you were right. It&#39;s been a while since I read Genesis. In addition, why do we have four Gospels? Each shows a different perspective. <br><br>Again, you&#39;re right. That was a very not-good idea of mine to say that.

            <p>They&#39;re different accounts that show different aspects of what made Jesus both God and man.<br><br>Matthew: Represented by a lion, Matthew&#39;s story portrays <b>Jesus as King</b>. If memory serves, he&#39;s a lot more authoritative in this one.<br><br>Mark: Represented by a bull, this is supposed to be <b>Jesus as Servant</b>. This one tells more of the things that he did for other people.<br><br>Luke: Represented by a worshipper, Luke&#39;s account is <b>Jesus as Man</b>. Luke was a doctor, and he naturally wanted a full account of Jesus&#39; human life.<br><br>John: Represented by an eagle, John&#39;s tale is <b>Jesus as God</b>.

            <p>There is a unique trait in dental orientation, exclusive to mammals (if I am not mistaken, thought it might be primates), that can first be found in the Therapsid Reptiles.  Anthropologists have been able to trace this dental orientation.  After that, someone with far more knowledge in the field can fill in.  <br><br>I am a bit clearer when tracing back.  The proper classification of humans is (at this point I believe) is <i>Homo sapiens sapiens</i>.  Now I am sure you are familiar with Neanderthals.  These hominid species is properly classified as <i>Homo sapiens neaderthalensis</i>  They were a very closely related species, in fact humans were capable of interbreeding with them.  That means they shared genetic traits, otherwise interbreeding would not have worked.  This means there needed to be a common ancestor.  This was <i>Homo heidelbergensis</i>.  Its fossils were first discovered in 1907 (after Darwin had died).  The fossil record also supports that H. heidelbergensis came from H. ergaster and H. erectus.  Both were discovered after Darwin&#39;s death.  Those were predated by H. habilis (also post Darwin) then there is also the Australipithicines.  The later part of human evolution is well documented.   </p>

            <p>The fact that you can&#39;t just show me a crazy amount of evidence is telling. Really, though, Des is right. I extended an invitation of off-Board discussion to SeaTurtle on the subject of the Bible, but I don&#39;t think a debate on evolution alone will do much. <br><br>I will say, however, that evolution was disproved in a court of law by William Jennings Bryan.

            <p>Saying that evolution was disproved in a court of law, specifically an American one, is a) Americanocentric and b) completely irrelevant, because whether evolution is right or not is not a legal question. It&#39;s a scientific or philosophical one.</p>

            <p>You are referring to the Scopes trial.  The result of the that trial was that the Court found Scopes violated the Tennessee Statute which stated that teaching evolution was a crime.  The trial ended because Scopes was no longer employed by the State and thus no longer subject to the law at issue.  So the court dismissed as moot.<br><br>Now, subsequently there was a case <i>Epperson v. Arkansas</i>.  There the Court specifically held that a statute to ban the teaching of evolution was unconstitutional.  And later in <i>Edwards v. Aguillard</i> the Court effectively said that evolution is the appropriate theory, any use of creation theory in public schools violates the establishment clause.  But at no point did any court actually say the theory was disproved.  The closest they ever came was in the Aguillard dissent, where the stated that Evolution was a theory, just like creation and as such requiring both theories did not violate the establishment clause    </p>

            <p>This is one of the anti-evolution arguments that annoys me the most, so I&#39;d just like to take a moment to set something straight:<br><br><i>The scientific definition of a &quot;theory&quot; is not the same as the colloquial meaning of the term.</i><br><br>What most people mean when they say they have a theory is more like a scientific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis">hypothesis</a>, which is basically an educated guess. Once enough experiments have been conducted that back up the hypothesis—or more accurately don&#39;t disprove it, because the point of a proper scientific experiment is actually to disprove its hypothesis—then it may graduate into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory">scientific theory</a>, which means it is recognized by scientific consensus as fact. Unless, of course, something comes along to disprove it. It&#39;s always possible. But once an idea is recognized as a scientific theory, that means the vast majority of evidence supports it, so it&#39;s really not very likely to be disproved.<br><br>Note that a scientific theory is <b>not</b> a step below a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law">scientific law</a>. They can <b>both</b> be referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_fact">scientific fact</a>—they just describe different things. Gravity is a good example of scientific law: if you jump off a bridge into an abyss, you will fall due to the effects of gravity. It is what happens, and you can&#39;t disprove that. Now, how gravity <i>works</i>, that&#39;s covered by scientific theory, which can be modified or even disproved with enough evidence. Laws are <i>what</i> happens, theories are <i>how</i> they happen. Evolution, therefore, is both a law (changes to a species happen due to various factors over time) and a theory (adaptation, natural selection, genetic mutations, etc.).<br><br>So please, if you must argue against science, whatever you do, at least don&#39;t make THAT mistake. It&#39;s annoying, and it makes you look stupid.<br><br>(Not YOU, [Evil AI], just in case that needed saying. I know you were just stating what the argument said. I just wanted to explain why it&#39;s a bad argument. {= ) )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Interesting fact, I actually used to think that way about 10-15 years ago.  I had a &quot;science teacher&quot;, though I use that term very, very loosely, seeing as said teach argued against evolution, and turned a discussion on the Scopes Trial into a mock trial were we (the students) found that creation was the appropriate theory and that evolution was wrong.  Of course a year or two later I was confronted with evidence to the contrary, and I realized that my former position was untenable at best. </p>

            <p>Which is why you can&#39;t rely on stuff that&#39;s just been handed to you. If you want to be smarter, you have to check these things for yourself. You can&#39;t just go on what other people tell you, whether they lived now or several thousand years ago. This is why science is structured in the way that it is; it&#39;s based on being able to check everything that someone claims so that we can be sure it&#39;s actually happening and not just something someone made up for whatever reason.<br><br>Rationalism and piety can and do coexist; there&#39;s no reason why one should disavow the other. You can believe in whatever you wish, and you should, if you&#39;re of the opinion it helps you do the least harm (there&#39;s that phrase again!), but treating the Bible as the only source of truth is like treating the writings of Pliny the Elder as the only source of which animals exist in the world.</p>

            <p>And I used to think that the Scopes Trial said the same, then I finally decided to read it.  The best explanation is this:<br><br>&quot;The Court is informed that the plaintiff in error is no longer in the service of the State. We see nothing to be gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case. On the contrary, we think the peace and dignity of the State, which all criminal prosecutions are brought to redress, will be better conserved by the entry of a nolle prosequi herein. Such a course is suggested to the Attorney-General&quot;  Tennessee&#39;s Chief Justice Green and his order.  <br><br>The whole thing was a bad example of US Law.  I think at one point the defense ended up calling the prosecutor as a witness, the whole thing was a mess.<br><br>And that is an easy misconception to make.  The law which forbade the teaching of evolution was upheld.  Though it was on a technicality, and the State never brought an action under that law again.

            <p>I was homeschooled by very conservative Christian parents,  and given only creationist textbooks for most of my education. The claims in those books all held together really well until I encountered evidence-based science and discovered that the creationist textbooks had lied to me and misrepresented the scientific position about . . . yeah, pretty much everything. It was a hard lesson to learn, but it has taught me to check and check and check. So maybe the experience wasn&#39;t wasted? Hopefully not, anyway.</p>

            <p>Personally, I think the reason the religious have such a problem with science is that religion is, by it&#39;s very nature, unscientific. It isn&#39;t overly concerned with finding out new things - indeed, down that path lies heresy and setting fire to people, and it&#39;s a pain to get the burn marks out of the carpet. Instead, it is concerned with one single, massive book, which is True, made up of smaller books, which are also True. Everything in the Book is True, and by extension everything in the smaller books is True, except the bits that Aren&#39;t True that over the years have been discarded. Science&#39;s constant peer-review process and refining the knowledge, to the extremely religious, is therefore akin to writing more of the Bible and must subsequently be viewed with at best confusion and at worst outright vitriol.<br><br>At least, that&#39;s my take on it from experiences with my own local God addicts. They scare me and repeatedly tell me that I&#39;m going to spend eternity in torment for something I can&#39;t help, so, er, yeah, my conversations with them tend to be a little on the brief side.</p>

            <p>When a child undergoes puberty, do they go to sleep one night and emerge as a teenager the next morning? Of course not-- the process is far too subtle for that. But if we were to track the aging process by means of a photograph taken every year on that child&#39;s birthday, we would see a definite gradual change from 13 to 25 years old. If we were to say &quot;aha! Missing link!&quot; at any point in the process... Well, no. It doesn&#39;t work that way. It&#39;s a continuous process, like driving up a slope. It is not like climbing rungs of a ladder. <br><br>The Bible is undeniably a historical document, yes. It is categorically not a scientific text, however. As such, we cannot base our understanding of the origins of life on this text. Besides, there are plenty of other modern religious texts that flat-out contradict the Bible&#39;s version of the creation of the world. What makes them less valid than the Christian verion of events? What about all of the old religions? Did they have a valid point anywhere in their teachings? Did they have the correct interpretation of events? Why not? </p>

            <p>While it may be a gut reaction to homosexuality, there is another possible reaction.  This is a really heavy handed decision by the Court.  There are I think legitimate concerns about the Federal-State relationship.  Marriage rights had traditionally been governed under State Law, but between <i>Windsor</i> and the recent decision, it is forcing a Federal Standard on the States.  So this is arguably a violation of the 10th Amendment, of course these arguments were made during the desegregation era and they failed, but that still has a basis for concern.<br><br>Further there is also a Federal Separation of Powers issue as well.  This is essentially the Court Legislating, which is beyond their power.  Then of course there is, what I am certain is the Scalia/Thomas argument, that this is basically the Court amending the Constitution without actually going through the Amendment process.  Of course that has never stopped the Court before mind you, but it does add another precedent for them to reach a bit further.  It could theoretically get to the point where the Court decides that they have enough precedents where they can wholesale amend the Constitution at will.  <br><br>And that is something that could horrify people.  Because it gives far too much power to one branch of the Government.  Of course I do not think this decision has that effect.  Frankly I think this should have been decided quite some time ago.  After <i>Loving v. Virginia</i> in the 50s the Court found a fundamental right to marriage.  And it is virtually indistinguishable.  Really the only difference was in <i>Loving</i> it was interracial marriages rather than same-sex marriages.</p>

            <p>A few years back, the act that forcibly disallowed military benefits to be given to anything but a heterosexual couple was removed. As was Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell and the general set up where homosexuals in military service would be discharged upon their status being discovered.<br><br>In further support of service members who wished to marry, shortly after both of these items were taken care of, the US military allowed its service members to take an amount of &#39;free&#39; (as in, not counted against them) leave so that they could go to states where same-sex marriage was legal to be able to marry. <br><br>The military is, of course, a federal level institution. </p>

            <p>I do not see this decision as upsetting either the balance between Congress and the Court or between States and the Federal Government, but I do see that as an argument that can be made.  And it was an argument that was made before the Court, and though I have not read the opinion yet, I suspect that Justices Scalia and Thomas both accepted that argument.<br><br>But to the argument I was making, there is no Federalism issue with regards to the military, because (as you said) it is a Federal Institution, though the military does complicate things because it has its own law.  But the Uniform Code of Military Justice is sort of corollary to main Federal Law, not unlike the Federal Rules of Evidence or Civil Procedure.<br><br>But again there is still an argument to be made that it violates principles of Federalism or Separation of Powers.  But if it is not clear, I do not think any of those arguments are going to be successful.  And the Court did not think they were either.</p>

            <p>Someone can still be opposed to the decision without it being because of religious reasons or homophobia.  For example they could be opposed on Federalism Grounds.  Which is a fair stance to have.  One could also have trouble with this decision on Separation of Powers Grounds as well.  It is essentially the Court Legislating, which they are not supposed to do (though they&#39;ve been doing it since 1791).<br><br>But one can still be opposed to the decision without it being for hateful reasons.</p>

            <p>But that wouldn&#39;t really be a case for saying point blank that you&#39;re &#39;horrified&#39;. That implies that you not only think the decision was badly-made (legality-wise), but also that you think the <i>outcome</i> is a negative.

            <p>At least not in my perspective.  I have seen cases where I have liked the result, but he legal reasoning was so bad, that I would have rather the Court come out the other way.  Would I use &quot;horrified&quot; to describe it, probably not, but others might.  <br><br>Though now that I think about it, I agree with a lot of the Court&#39;s Establishment Clause Decisions, but I am horrified by the legal reasoning behind it.

            <p>To be honest, I thought my response was fairly clear in... well, literally everything I&#39;ve said in this thread. But sure, let&#39;s talk.<br><br>I&#39;m going to skip over first to your apology.<br><br><i>I honestly did not know that it was a sore spot: I thought that you were just being unclear in some kind of an attempt to put the spotlight on homosexuality without any reference to the person that I am talking to. I acted in ignorance, and I apologize.</i><br><br>I&#39;m truly not trying to be ungracious, but I feel uncomfortable accepting this. The fact is, you start off &quot;Finally, a clear answer,&quot; to which my response is: <i>I gave you a clear answer from the very start</i>. I&#39;m not going to go hunt down the emails we exchanged, but &quot;I don&#39;t want to answer that,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m neither male nor female&quot; WAS a clear answer. It was a clear, definite answer that you refused to accept.<br><br>Second - God, I hate to do this, as it undermines the assumption of trust we tend to make in this community, but my point stands. &quot;My gender is neither&quot; <i>is</i> an adequate answer, and the fact is, you still have no idea if I&#39;m telling the truth or not. I am, as it happens, but again, what does that actually mean? No one I meet in person knows what my biological sex is unless I tell them, either. My sex - and literally everyone&#39;s sex - is <i>their own business</i> and nobody else&#39;s. So in that respect, I WAS trying to make a point. Not a point about homosexuality, but a point about gender. The point was &quot;My sex doesn&#39;t matter, any more for me than anybody, lay off.&quot; I could&#39;ve told you right away, and again, in a way I did, but really, my point stands: it&#39;s none of your business whether anyone&#39;s sex matches their gender.<br><br>I&#39;m aware this is going to sound rude, but let me be perfectly clear: is it any more rude than a politely-worded request for someone to inform you what their genitals look like? It doesn&#39;t matter that I&#39;m intersex: if I&#39;d come out and said I was biologically male or female, or trans and didn&#39;t want to disclose, it would still be <i>none of your business</i>.<br><br>Now. Your other two points.<br><br><i>I am not saying &quot;you don&#39;t have the right to celerate the ruling&quot;; it&#39;s just that I personally do not see the ruling as something to celebrate. So we&#39;re just putting it out there: not everyone is in accord that Obergefell v. Hodges is the greatest thing since sliced bread.</i><br><br>See, I might really dislike one of the faculty in my department, right? I&#39;m still not going to show up to their retirement or tenure party and remind them that I&#39;m not happy about the celebration. When the College Republicans on campus are having a party to celebrate something that went their way, I don&#39;t show up and tell them I disagree; I choose a time and place that&#39;s appropriate, rather than walking in and telling them &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just putting it out there, but I really wish the open-carry law hadn&#39;t passed.&quot;<br><br>I think Huinesoron answered your other point very well, but I&#39;ll throw in my two cents as well.<br><br><i>And anyone at the front lines of this knows that the assertion &quot;It won&#39;t affect you&quot; is false. Even you hint at the real issue in your first paragraph: &quot;it&#39;s just one more step towards acceptance.&quot; That&#39;s the core issue here: whether we, as a society, are going to say that homosexuality is as equally valid, morally, as heterosexuality.</i><br><br>And... again, how does that affect you? Yes. We are one more step towards full acceptance. I&#39;ll say it again: <i>how does this affect you</i>? You are presumably not gay. You are perfectly welcome to continue being not gay, and attending a church, and voting for politicians, who agree with you. You can wear a shirt every day that says &quot;Love the sinner, hate the sin,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m Straight and the rest of you are going to hell,&quot; or whatever you like. You can go to non-gay bars. You can stand in front of gay bars with signs that say &quot;I wish this place didn&#39;t exist&quot; or, again, <i>whatever you please</i>. Yes, you&#39;re going to have to deal with the fact that the majority of society disagrees with you. So? The majority of society disagrees with me on a lot of issues; for example, the fact that non-gender-binary people exist. As a general rule, I sort of continue existing, and <i>it does not effect me in the slightest</i>*. Another example: my religious beliefs fall into a sort of weird place between religions. I disagree with the majority of society about things like the nature of God, etc. <i>It doesn&#39;t effect me</i>. <br><br><i>And when placed in those terms, the reason we Christian conservatives are fighting tooth and nail is as clear as crystal. And I am not speaking in hypotheticals here, it is clear from Europe and even here in the United States as well that wherever gay marriage goes, forced acceptance thereof follows. We are all but told the words of the Borg: &quot;Resistance is futile.&quot; Either assent to the prevailing orthodoxy, or the will of the state will force you to, religion be damned.</i><br><br>No. It really isn&#39;t clear as crystal. What are you fighting? That people <i>who aren&#39;t you and don&#39;t agree with your beliefs</i> will... uh, continue to not be you and not agree with your beliefs? You&#39;re fighting for the laws and moral codes of your specific sect of your specific religion to apply to everyone. Including, I might add, the people who lived here for tens of thousands of years before any Christian set foot on these shores - gender and marriage and sex and sexuality are seen from a completely different worldview by the Plains, Coast Salish, Plateau, Basin, Southwest, Southeast, and Northeast tribes. (The Arctic are the only place I know where marriage... kinda sorta resembles European tradition.)<br><br>&quot;Either assent to the prevailing orthodoxy, or the will of the state will force you to,&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ll say it again - force you to WHAT? Not throw people who are gay in jail? Not stone women who get divorces? Not stone men who lie with men as with women? What are you worried about being forced to do? The majority of the population still identifies as straight, dude. Nobody&#39;s going to force you to do a single thing.<br><br><br><br>*that&#39;s actually a blatant lie - it effing sucks, getting a dirty look no matter what bathroom you use, having to explain to people every other day when they ask what you are, like, biologically, though, getting passed up by the bus because the driver didn&#39;t like what he saw, wondering whether that guy who&#39;s been giving you dirty looks in the bar all night is going to follow you out and go after you, etc.</p>

            <p>What is it, exactly, to be &quot;male&quot;? I mean, I know I identify as a cisgender heterosexual male, but while the first two words in that descriptor are pretty clear to me, the last isn&#39;t. Does it mean that I desire girls? If so, lesbians and bisexuals are males, too, and I don&#39;t that is the case. Does it mean I do male-ish things? What are those? What does that say about tomboy-ish girls? <br>So, yeah, now I&#39;m confused.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s actually a really exciting subject to get into! When you think about it, every single society and culture has expressed gender completely differently from one another, so our concept of what is &quot;masculine&quot; and what is &quot;feminine&quot; are completely formed by our culture, and that changes so quickly. That&#39;s one of my favorite things about studying history - you see things change so much, so quickly. There&#39;s this book I read a while back - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HUNTING-AMERICAN-IMAGINATION-Daniel-Justin/dp/B007K4YQOK">Hunting and the American Imagination</a> that explores JUST the concept of hunting in American history. We think of it as a masculine part of history that goes all the way back, but was it really? It&#39;s so much more complicated than we realize!<br><br>Colonial (ie, pre-revolution) history especially you see it in - there are so many primary source documents from missionaries who are <i>agonizing</i> over the gender expression of the tribes they&#39;re trying to convert! Often their concern seems to be FIRST to &quot;fix&quot; their gender roles, then the rest - religion, etc. - will follow. So the big one I remember is the Wampanoag, Algonquin, Mohican, Pequot, etc. in the Northeast. Women owned land, rather then men; men had rights to the hunting grounds (it&#39;s notable that by &quot;women&quot; and &quot;men&quot; I mean those who identified as women and men - it was tied to gender, not sex, for them). This drove the early Pilgrims <i>up the wall</i>, because when men were in camp, they didn&#39;t farm - because to them, it was unmanly to do so! But the Pilgrims saw it as a lacking work ethic, and were horrified that the women didn&#39;t sit around cleaning, but worked in the fields. Yet this is how they&#39;d been doing it for years - they saw it as the Pilgrims having weird, messed-up gender roles.<br><br>Another one I learned about very recently was the history of Tokyo before the Meiji Restoration - the idea of &quot;Edo Manners,&quot; or business manners. Historically, homosexuality and bisexuality were completely accepted in the city of Edo - and because the city was centered on <i>business</i> ideals, that&#39;s where the gender roles were centered, too: women were seen as &quot;naturally&quot; better at management, while men were seen as likewise &quot;naturally&quot; better at sales.<br><br>The more you study history, the more you realize that what gender <i>means</i> is completely relative to the culture, and it&#39;s not even remotely inherent.</p>

            <p>Specifically, I&#39;ve been wondering where in the Bible God actually says that men have to wear pants and go to work and women have to wear skirts and stay home and cook or whatever. I went so far as to read Genesis up until Adam and Eve get kicked out of Eden, and I noticed something interesting:<br><br>He doesn&#39;t. Not until after the Fall, anyway.<br><br>Before the Fall, all it says is that Woman was to be Man&#39;s complement and helper. Nowhere does it say that Man has a penis and Woman has boobs, and anyway, Adam was made in God&#39;s image, and I can&#39;t see God having much use for mammalian genitalia. AFTER the Fall, though, that&#39;s when God curses Man to painful labor in the field and Woman to painful labor in childbirth and makes &quot;long garments&quot; for them, whatever that means, and THEN they have sex. Oh, and body shame was only a thing after eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge. So basically, as far as I&#39;m concerned, gender roles were tacked on after the fact as a punishment for Adam&#39;s sin of disobedience. Adam and Eve were supposedly perfect before the Fall, so it seems to me that if we&#39;re striving for a more perfect society, we ought to strive to do away with strict gender roles.<br><br>As for &quot;male and female He created them,&quot; that&#39;s plainly overlooking all the species that reproduce asexually or are self-fertilizing or use parthenogenesis or change sex for one reason or another or have the males bear/rear the young or are otherwise incredibly much more diverse and fascinating than most people realize. It&#39;s clear to me that the humans who penned the Bible only had their own experience to go on, whether they were divinely inspired or not; they couldn&#39;t have written &quot;male and female and etc.&quot; if they didn&#39;t know about the etc. But maybe they would have if they did.<br><br>Oh, and BTW, biologically speaking, &quot;female&quot; is the default setting for humans. Maleness is an optional add-on.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>PS. Okay, sex-determination is more complicated than that, but it&#39;s <i>basically</i> true, and it was nice and pithy. {; P</p>

            <p>&quot;I realise I really upset you when I bullied you into revealing something deeply personal, but you haven&#39;t responded to the other things I said!&quot; That&#39;s... really what you&#39;re going with?<br><br>Anyway, if you really want a response: I think this is an appalling statement.<br><br><i>And anyone at the front lines of this knows that the assertion &quot;It won&#39;t affect you&quot; is false.

What, like... the people who were fighting &#39;tooth and nail&#39; to <i>be allowed to marry the people they love?</i> No? You mean the people who were fighting to control other people&#39;s lives?<br><br>As to the rest of your premise: yes, that&#39;s the core issue. Whether you can accept that an attribute or stance you don&#39;t share is just as valid as your own, or whether you will continue to claim that &#39;anything I don&#39;t do is inherently evil&#39;.

            <p>That said, please allow me to address the last thing first, as I dare not take an invocation of the PPC Constitution lightly.<br><br>I admit that I can be very blunt in the way I word things. In VixenMage&#39;s specific case, I see that I have been offensive.  However, I honestly do not think that I have been attacking anyone in this thread. All I have been doing since the second I entered into this conversation is respond to opinions and give my stance, unpopular though it may be. If I have attacked anyone, please make it clear and I will unqualifiedly apologize.<br><br>That said, please allow me to contradict something in your  post:<br><i>&quot;I realise I really upset you when I bullied you into revealing something deeply personal,&quot;</i><br>I must object to your characterization of what I did. I specifically said in my post: &quot;However, I am risking being insensitive with those last two clauses, so for respect&#39;s sake, <b>I will refrain from pushing the topic any further,</b> and I apologize if I have offended you, VM.&quot;<br>Granted, in hindsight, I could have been clearer, but I had intended to mean that I was <i>not</i> pushing VM to answer and that I was <i>not</i> expecting VM to answer. And when VM did and revealed that it was a sore topic, I apologized for the hurt I caused.<br>Granted, in hindsight I should have just given an apology with nothing else. Therefore, I apologize again: I&#39;m sorry, VixenMage.<br><br><hr>
<br>Those things said, please allow me to counter your arguments, hS. I&#39;ll work backwards:<br><i>Hi! I live in Europe! I have never been forced to go to a gay wedding; I have never been forced to have gay sex; I have never been forced to observe gay sex; I have never been forced to write articles in favour of gay people; I have never been forced to do <b>literally anything</b> except for not try to impose my own view of the world on people who don&#39;t share it.</i><br><br>I am not arguing that anyone would be forced to do any of the things that you mentioned, nor am I (or any conservative, as far as I know) trying to argue that all those things are or will be the case. But I still believe that my original point still stands: my right to believe as my faith dictates, live according to that belief, and share that belief with others (without trying to impose it on anyone or shove it down anyone&#39;s throat, of course) stands in stark contradistinction with what has now been declared a federal right. Would a Catholic charity, for example, be forced to allow adoptions to gay couples? Litigation is on the horizon, and I fear what it may portend...<br><br><i>&#39;Anyone at the front lines&#39;? What, like... the people who were fighting &#39;tooth and nail&#39; </i>to be allowed to marry the people they love?<i> No?</i><br>I will not belabor the point, as <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279307;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">I have already stated my thoughts elsewhere on this thread</a>, but to summarize: You see it as &quot;being allowed to marry the people you love,&quot; I see it as &quot;redefining marriage, and foisting that redefinition upon a divided populace by judicial fiat.&quot; But since both <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279313;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">[EvilAI]UBEROverlord</a> and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=279418;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">VixenMage</a> bring up possible counterarguments to my &quot;redefinition&quot; argument, I do not want to speak any further on that point until I know a bit more about it. Perhaps I am indeed wrong. But I do not want to say anything further here without looking further into the matter.<br><br><i>You mean the people who were fighting to control other people&#39;s lives?</i><br>I honestly do not know what you are getting at here. No one is trying to control any homosexual&#39;s life. No one is trying to make the government force gay people back &quot;into the closet,&quot; so to speak. No one is trying to persecute them by force of law.<br>Before the ruling, conservatives and liberals theoretically stood on equal footing, competing for acceptance in the marketplace of ideas. But now one worldview has taken the fore, not because their cause has gained ascendancy in popular opinion, but because it has gained ascendancy in the minds of five out of a panel of nine judges.<br><br>That said, as I mentioned to [EvilAI]UBEROverlord, if you want to continue this conversation, please feel free to e-mail me. I would not want to further lengthen this thread, especially since it will drop off the front page before long.<br><br>Of course, please reply if you have anything further to say regarding the PPC Constitution or my alleged bullying. I like being a part of the PPC community, and I want to continue being a respectful, productive member of this Board. I certainly do not want to do anything to endanger that.</p>

            <p>But the right not to be discriminated against is much more important than your right to discriminate against someone on a religious basis. <br>In all such matters you must ask yourself &quot;what would I do if the boot was on the other foot?&quot; which, in this case, means &quot;would I be horrified if SCOTUS decided to finally legalise religious marriage after years of discrimination against religious people?&quot;<br>Because, frankly, if you don&#39;t want to be discriminated against when you&#39;re the minority, you mustn&#39;t discriminate against other groups that are now minorities; otherwise, you&#39;re a selfish hypocrite and no more.</p>

            <p>But I have no idea why you desire to advertise to the Board that you desire to dictate whether two consenting, non-related adults can get married based only on their genitals. You are free to feel that way, but it&#39;s rather not the time. I *do* wonder how y&#39;all think you&#39;re going to get a Constitutional amendment through? No one is gonna force you to get married to someone of the same sex. No one is going to hold you down and paint rainbows on you. <br><br>My girlfriend (who I hope to pull into the PPC someday, mwa-ha-ha) and I will just be over here, being all rainbow-y ourselves, I guess? Not that we&#39;re planning on getting married any time soon, of course, but it&#39;s nice to know we&#39;d be *able* to, ya know? Being acknowledged as a person with the same rights as other people is nice. :P<br><br>Our vision of marriage is the same vision of marriage. Only the wrappings are different. The love is the same.</p>

            <p>I consider myself politically conservative (gasp!).<br><br>Which means that I support the ability for people to marry others of the same sex. (I&#39;m sure at this point there are many people going &#39;wait, what?)<br><br>See, to begin with, Roberts (and Scalia as well) have made statements and have written dissents in the past that indicate that while they hide themsides behind Originality (which, as AIUO has stated, is taking the view of following the original intent of the Constitution&#39;s writers and then ignoring all changes in social and modern structure since then) is indicative that they&#39;re using their own prejudices against such. They&#39;ve done this in the past, and will do so in the future.<br><br>You are confusing political conservatism with moral (namely: religious) conservatism. <br><br>There is nothing wrong with moral conservatism- orthodoxy serves well as having some kind of baseline- but morals should never be confused and mixed up with ethics. Is it religiously moral for members of the same sex to enter sexual relationships with each other? According to several religions, no, it is not, no more than it is for two members of the opposite sex to have sexual relationships outside of marriage.<br><br>Is it ethical to prevent two, consenting persons from entering what is in this day and age largely a <i>civil</i> contract of law, through which many benefits are obtained, in the name of moral conservation? No, it is not.<br><br>Additionally, the United States of America was- and still is, despite the attempts by many- founded on the basis of Freedom Of And From Religion and the Separation of State From Religion. Religious views should not impact on the governance and laws of the state.<br><br>This decision does not force churches to marry same sex couples against the will of the priests.<br><br>It does not force anyone, against their will, to enter a same sex (civil) marriage.<br><br>Real political conservatism is when the state does its best to limit its impact and intrusion upon the rights of the people. Real political conservatism is not when the state&#39;s laws are used to oppress and otherwise limit the rights of people. Passing laws against gay marriage and claiming it in the name of political conservatism is (quite frankly) a farce. <br><br>While I can appreciate that you&#39;re personally uncomfortable with the thought of gays marrying legally in our United States of America, please don&#39;t confuse it with being actually politically conservative. Just admit it for what it is: moral conservitude or quiet homophobia. </p>

            <p>it&#39;s interesting you bring that up. As long as what they ask doesn&#39;t directly contradict Scripture, then I&#39;m to obey. I&#39;d go to the lion&#39;s den. Whatever the penalty was for not performing the sacrifice, I&#39;d suffer it. No law in the Bible says I can&#39;t <i>not</i> prepare food on Saturday. As for the last one, they&#39;d probably just kill me, or force me to pay extortion money. <br><br>But, in regards to America, the Founding Fathers were all either Christian or had a deep respect for Christianity, and intended America to be a Christian nation.

            <p>And yeah, that was a sentiment that was widely echoed by the other founders.  Off the top of my head, there is Jefferson&#39;s Letter to the Danbury Baptists, which created the separation of church and state language.  Another one is Madison&#39;s Letter to William Bradford Jr. 1774, Madison&#39;s Letter to James Monroe, 1785.  Parts of Madison&#39;s Journal of the Constitutional Convention also talk heavily about it.<br><br>Frankly though, ultimately it does not matter if the founders were Deist, Christian, Agnostic, or whatever, the Constitution itself was a document of the Enlightenment.  It was heavily grounded in reason.  It was heavily inspired by John Locke&#39;s Social Contract (in fact some parts are copied directly from it).  Religion was only there in the background as a right they wanted to protect.  They specifically were opposed to any kind of establishment, their writings make that clear.  I think that leads to the interesting question of how secular the government must be.  And that is were I diverge from the Court.  Personally I think they overused the Establishment Clause and underused the Free Exercise Clause.  But that is a discussion for another time perhaps.<br> </p>

            <p>I am not even an American. But there <i>isn&#39;t</i> a question of how secular a government must be, because the answer, whatever the state, is &quot;completely&quot;. We live in a multicultural age, and all cultures - and therefore all religions - must be treated equally in the eyes of the law if you are to claim the status of civilised society. Picking one religion over another? That naturally engenders a system that benefits one set of people to the detriment of another, which is not what a government should do.<br><br>At least, in my opinion.

            <p>I just do not like the reasoning.  I fully believe in Separation of Church and State, but in my view the Court overused the Establishment Clause and created a highly subjective test that leads to wildly inconsistent results.  Like prayer before starting a school day violates the Constitution, but prayer before a city council meeting does not.  Or how a non-denominational invocation by a rabbi at a graduation ceremony violates the Constitution, but a prayer at the start of legislative session does not.<br><br>I think the better approach would have been to use the free exercise clause.  I think most of the same results would have been achieved with less inconsistency.  I agree that government should be secular, but I think the problem is, the way the US Courts have used the Establishment Clause, it has been insanely over-broad and has led to inconsistent, and even dangerous results.  A good example comes from a few years back.  There was a site, that was on Federal Land, and the government wanted to build a highway through it.  It would have destroyed the land.  That site had been a holy site for several Native American Tribes for centuries, and only came into the possession of the Federal Government during, well not one of our finest moments (forced migration of Native Americans).  But even after the Government took control, it was still used by these tribes, and had been for years.  <br><br>The Court held, that the government could pave the holy site over, basically committing cultural genocide.  Congress stepped in and made it a national park, preventing any development on it, so it worked out, but it almost did not.  If the Court over the years had been using Free Exercise rather than Establishment, that case would have had a different result, one that I think is the right result.  That is why I do not like the way the Court has used the Establishment Clause.<br><br>That&#39;s why I imply there might be a sliding scale of secularism.  Congress should never have had to intervene in that case.  But the Court too often forgets the rights of Free Exercise.  </p>

            <p>There were two clauses that were supposed to work together to protect religious freedom in the United States.  For a time they did, but around the start of the 20th Century the Court changed, and started to broadly interpret the Establishment Clause, but it lead to two effects, that I have some issue with.  The first is a highly subjective test that can lead to inconsistent results.  Again school prayer being a violation, but legislative (you know an actual governmental function) prayer being proper.  I do not know about you, but I do not think that makes a whole lot of sense.  The second result, was because of how broadly the Court interpreted the Establishment Clause, they basically abandoned the Free Exercise Clause.  And ultimately it came to a single case, that I think was a wrong result.<br><br>Which was of course, the Native American Case I mentioned above.  It was land that the Government illegally acquired when they forced the Native Americans off of it.   It was an incredibly holy site for several Native Americans that they had used long before the US even existed.  They continued to use it even after the government took it, such that if a party could take ownership through Adverse Possession against the government they would have.  The government decided to destroy that site by building a road through it.  The Court let them do it.  I do find that as a problem.  I think that is a flagrant violation of the Free Exercise Clause.  Congress intervened, however, made the land a national park and prevented any development, thus preserving the site.  So the right result managed to be reached, but by the wrong methods.  <br><br>What I am saying is that through all of the decisions the Court has made on the topic, had they used the Free Exercise Clause in concert with the Establishment Clause, they would have reached the same results, but on better legal grounds.  The Free Exercise Clause was supposed to be the main tool when dealing with questions regarding Freedom of Religion, and the Establishment Clause was supposed to be a fine scalpel designed for surgical excisions to cover the gaps Free Exercise did not.  Instead the Court turned it into a meat clever to hack away blindly, which led to the inconsistent results.  <br><br>Or with another metaphor, imagine a religious freedom question as being a dead leaf on a tree.  Prior to recent developments the Establishment Clause would be used as a pair garden sheers to cut off that single dead leaf.  But the Court has broadened it to such a point were it is now a chainsaw.  So now you cut down the entire tree.  Yeah, it gets you the same/right result (getting rid of the dead leaf), but is it really the best way to do it?    </p>

            <p>I am for Separation of Church and State, I think using the Free Exercise Clause as the starting point (it would have required a broadening of it, but not as much as they had to broaden the Establishment Clause) would have lead to the same results in most cases.  The ones it would not have, would then be able to be reached with a narrower Establishment Clause.  Instead we have a highly subjective test that is ultimately decided by what five attorneys think an &quot;excessive entanglement with religion&quot; is.  It leads to inconsistent and bizarre results.<br><br>As I said, a prayer in a public school violates it (which I agree with), but a prayer before an actual governmental function (legislating) does not.  Frankly I think that is a nonsensical result.  I mean seriously, if you ban it for the lesser (School) you should ban it for the greater (legislation).  </p>

            <p>If one were to look at some of the correspondences between the founders, particularly Madison and Jefferson, you will see that they believed that they way Great Britain was operating, with the Church of England, was problematic.  They saw religion as a vessel that could act as an oppressive force, where a majority could destroy the rights of a minority (of course a bit hypocritical if you look at some other provisions).  But this idea of protecting minority rights was firmly ingrained in the minds of the founders.<br><br>Basically what I am saying here, is that the founders, Madison and Jefferson in particular, saw religion as something that could oppress the minorities.  That is why the Establishment Clause was created.  They also so the risk of interfering with individual practice rights, hence the Free Exercise Clause.   Madison was more concerned with actual establishment, his writings specifically talk about the risks of the Church of England, but Jefferson took it a step further.  Jefferson in a famous letter brought up the idea of a &quot;Wall of separation between Church and State&quot;.  <br><br>As history has shown, the Court has adopted Jefferson&#39;s understanding.  But really the bottom line is if religion is connected to the State then you run the risk of an easy vessel for the oppression of minority rights.  I am not saying that it would, but the risk is there.</p>

            <p>No, wait, you&#39;re trying to assert your own moral superiority. Forgot you&#39;d already said that. Let me break my opinion on this business down, then:-<br><br>Suffering is anathema to human existence. It is not enough to do good; morality involves doing the <i>least harm</i>. And while hurting someone is actively harmful, the denial of rights to people and their treatment as second-class citizens for <i>whatever</i> reason is passively harmful. It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not you go out to shoot black people or firebomb abortion clinics or any other form of active harm; you are not opposing a system that treats these crimes in an unequal way, and you are therefore not doing the least harm. You passively benefit from an unequal system, whether or not you directly engage with it to keep it going; that is not doing the least harm.<br><br>If it is to call itself such, an enlightened, civilised society must be compassionate and egalitarian, and that does <i>not</i> mean according special privileges to straight, cisgender white people who believe in a particular holy book. It means actual equality of gender and race and sexuality and gender identity. It means that the fundamental dignity of <i>all</i> human beings is protected, and not just the dignity of of straight cismale WASPs. Only then can society be equal. Only then can society move forward.<br><br>And frankly, if I may say so, your right to be discriminatory is lesser than my right to not be discriminated against. Much, <i>much</i> lesser. So show a little Christian charity and forgive my lack of tolerance for those who do me active harm. As for those who only contrive to hurt me passively, though, well... I&#39;d like to quote from your book, if I may:<br><br>&quot;Lord, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&quot;</p>

Oh, um, sort of on the subject that this thread was started about, would you mind answering a question for me? It&#39;s sort of involved. I keep hearing a lot of terms get thrown around about the topic of gender identity, and most of them confuse me. I have the barest basics— gay, lesbian, transsexual, and bisexual. But then I hear all of these OTHER words get tossed out and I have absolutely no idea what anyone is talking about, like, from your own post, &quot;cisgender.&quot; I can guess at what it means, but I don&#39;t know. Would you mind giving me a rundown? I&#39;m thinking that I could coverse a lot better about the topic, and with less chance of hurting someone&#39;s feelings, if I had my terms straight. </p>

            <p>First off, &quot;transsexual&quot;? It&#39;s not a word that&#39;s really used any more. The proper term is &quot;transgender&quot; because nonbinary people exist. Nonbinary, for reference, is a catchall term refers to people outside of the conventional gender binary; there are subdivisions like agender and genderfluid, but I primarily want to cover the basics.<br><br>Transgender people identify as a different gender (not necessarily the opposite gender - there&#39;s that nonbinary thing again) to the one they were born as. Cisgender people identify purely as the gender they were born as.<br><br>Basically, people are generally raised to believe that gender is like a light switch. This is not the case. It&#39;s more like a dimmer switch. You&#39;ve got to find the right light for you.<br><br>I hope this gives you a little insight.</p>

            <p>This sort of thing is part of what I mean when I&#39;m talking about doing the least harm.

            <p>That&#39;s exactly what I did. I read things on this board. I was under the impression that that&#39;s what the board was for. Nobody had given quite the answer that <i>I</i> would have given, which covered multiple salient points about my personal morality from a socialist perspective. Which is why I posted it. My opening remarks were overly derogatory, I admit (you&#39;ll note I apologised for my vehemence elsewhere), but I stand by the spirit in which they were made; Alleb&#39;s use of an appeal to morality was something I held to be disingenuous and I felt obliged to respond with a clear, full description of my personal morality in the context of her original question - which, lest we forget, was &quot;Is oppression actually wrong, though?&quot;.<br><br>As for point two, that was a preemptive defence of my position against people accusing me of first-world problems. This probably backfired. While I personally hold extreme pacifist views, I accept at times there really is no other resort and I have the deepest respect for the sacrifices of service personnel. I did not express this clearly and apologise for causing you offence; it was not my intent to slander your profession.</p>

            <p>First it is important to note that morals and law are not the same.  The law does not regulate morals and morals do not inform the law.  At least that is how it is supposed to be, how successful that is, is up for debate.  I am not, nor have I been making a moral argument.  I have, however, been making a contextual historical legal argument, based upon the history of the law in question, namely the Constitution.<br><br>It is clear from the writings of the founders, from the minutes of the record, and from the Federalist Papers, that one of the biggest issues that concerned the founders was oppression.  Keep in mind they had just fought a costly war because they felt they were being oppressed, and they were concerned about it happening again.  That is why the Articles of Confederation were born.  They were worried that they were substituting, (to borrow from <i>The Patriot</i>) &quot;One tyrant 3000 miles away for 3000 tyrants one mile away&quot;.<br><br>When the Articles began to fail, the founders decided they needed the current system we have now, but they were well aware that there could be risks, and that people might not want to support such a strong Federal Government.  That is why all the checks and balances were put in place.  It was to ensure no one branch had sufficient power to oppress the people.<br><br>This idea continued well after the Constitution as well.  It is seen again clearly with the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments.  Their purpose was to both prevent the States from oppressing the rights of the citizens, and to attempt to reenfranchise an entire class of people.  Of course those Amendments had no teeth at the time and so it was difficult for any enforcement to occur, but the intent was there.  It was seen again with the 19th Amendment, to prevent further oppression of a group.  <br><br>There is also the 22nd Amendment, which was a response to FDR&#39;s incredibly long tenure as president, the concern was that it had become an abuse of power.<br><br>Now there is also the entire Civil Rights Movement, brought because the people felt that they were being oppressed by their governments.  And perhaps more importantly the Civil Rights Act, which finally gave teeth to the Reconstruction Amendments.  That really solidified a new approach, which was to find more protected rights.  That eventually gave rise to the decisions like Loving (fundamental right to marriage), Griswold (fundamental right to privacy), Batson (prevent race-based juries), Miranda (required warnings to all criminal suspects),  Widsor (grant same-sex couples same tax benefits) and now yesterday&#39;s decision.<br><br>The fact of the matter is, under US Law, oppression is wrong.<br><br>As to your question.  Yes I do believe oppression is morally wrong, but as I said I am not making a moral argument.  If you want me to, I suppose I could, but morality is too squishy.</p>

            <p>Many Christians don&#39;t really agree on what &quot;God&quot; means, and I <i>strongly</i> suspect the same is true of every other religion, including Islam.<br><br>The last church I attended, the priest talked often about how God was not essentially a &quot;being,&quot; or a definable person, but a Presence in all living things, impossible to define. This lines up with several other religions&#39; take - for example, teachers of many spiritual traditions within Native American religion (guardian spirit, medewin, etc.) will often say the same, that not only can a &quot;God&quot; not be defined or pinned down, but that it&#39;s sacrilegious to even <i>try</i>.<br><br>So to say that [the Christian] God, rather than conscience, is the basis of morality - when not everyone is a Christian, and those who are don&#39;t even agree with one another on the definition of God <i>or</i> conscience, is kind of a tough argument to make.</p>

            <p>I used that definition to avoid contention, and in doing so I walked right into it. <br><br>It&#39;s rather hard to pin down how far one can get from the Bible before you aren&#39;t really a Christian anymore, just using the name. I think the bare bones of it is that you believe that God came down as man, died on the cross for our sins, and rose again three days later. That&#39;s the most important part. A lot of people might disagree on the particulars, though, so that&#39;s basically a personal opinion. <br><br>Grab a ASV, and that&#39;s what we&#39;ll use. The Judaic laws aren&#39;t essential-- Paul talks about new believers not having to be taught the old traditions. Whatever is mentioned again in the New Testament as binding is, well, binding. The parts that contradict each other can all be explained, but I really don&#39;t think we want to go through all that, because it&#39;s not central to the discussion and might take a while. And, to be totally honest, I don&#39;t think I could face absolutely every detail. A Bible scholar could, I&#39;m sure, but I&#39;m not one of those. <br><br>Well, I see where you&#39;re coming from, but at the same time, I don&#39;t. I grew up reading the Bible, and I&#39;ve always had that as a base for what I&#39;m doing. The thought of not having a firmly defined foundation from a power greater than human feeling troubles me, and it&#39;s hard for me to imagine <i>not</i> being troubled by it. <br><br>That being said, the Granny Weatherwax morality seems sort of shaky to me. Is it always wrong to hurt people, no matter what, ever? What if I get caught down a dark alley with a man who, shall we say, doesn&#39;t have my best interests at heart? I&#39;m fighting him with all I&#39;ve got. And what about people with addictions? It&#39;ll hurt to get them off of those drugs, but it&#39;s necessary. </p>

            <p>First off, before anything else can be said, you need to define your terms. What exactly do you mean by &quot;religion being connected to state&quot;?<br><br>If what you mean is that the church should be able to set policy merely by virtue of being the church, i.e., a country run as a theocracy, then the problem is obvious: anyone not of the religion in power is in danger of persecution.<br><br>If what you mean is that policy may be influenced by the ethical and religious beliefs of the policymaker, there is generally nothing amiss with that. A lot of codified laws have parallels to, if not roots in, religious beliefs. The prototypical example: We have laws against murder, which parallel the ancient command &quot;Thou shalt not kill.&quot;<br><br>When an American says &quot;separation of church and state,&quot; both a conservative and a liberal will agree that the phrase covers the first definition. We do not want Congress setting up a national religion, nor do we want institutionalized persecution.<br><br>Where JulyFlame and I might disagree, however, is in the second definition: To what extent should moral, ethical, and religious considerations factor into what the positive law should be? That, of course, is a debate that any democratic society should have.<br><br>My personal worry (and that of many a religious conservative) is that a social liberal may <i>mis<i>use &quot;separation of church and state&quot; as a means to silence any opinion that may have a religious basis--a position that is clearly untenable. Though something should not be a law simply because some religious figure said &quot;Thus saith the Lord/Allah/Buddha/whoever,&quot; that does not mean that his voice should automatically be silenced either.</i></i></p>

            <p>Essentially, my guess is because we don&#39;t live in a theocracy - and so every person of religious minority should be guaranteed certain rights, regardless of how other religions (even majorities) feel about it. I mentioned this below, in the other thread, but it&#39;s been an ongoing debate for 300+ years. Should we allow sale and consumption of alcohol, when the majority of America were Protestants who (at that time) had a sort-of thing against drinking? Should we allow integration of transit and communities, when the majority of Americans (at that time) believed interracial marriage was a sin? Should we allow people to work on Sunday, when the majority of Americans believe it&#39;s a sin?<br><br>Every single one of these was <i>hotly</i> debated at the time. But not allowing people to marry in the civil courts because one&#39;s religion forbids it is a decision befitting a theocracy, not a free and secular government.</p>

            <p>It was a 5-4 decision, so the Court did not fully agree.  A slim majority won out, like most of the other large decisions recently.  I am concerned that it was not a 6-3 decision.  5-4 makes it very easy to attack.  I see no reason why it would be overturned, but it may well be very similar to <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, highly unlikely to be overturned, but far from immune from attack.</p>

            <p>I guess this is where I ought to point out that in my hometown of El Paso, which is located in Texas, there were rulings on the books that were purposefully set up to allow for same sex partners (since they couldn&#39;t get married) to share their significant other&#39;s benefits if they were an employee of the city, and when they tried to remove said rulings, the explicit reasoning used wasn&#39;t to exclude said same sex partners, but there was a great deal of activism by local LGBT groups to try and prevent it from being removed?<br><br>Or that Texas in general does have a great degree of activism and proponents for LGBT rights in general, contrary to general stereotype, which is largely found in the older generations, like nearly everywhere else?<br><br>And that many of the larger cities in Texas do in fact have thriving LGBT groups and even events and areas? <br><br>And that the state in question is not in fact made up largely of hicks who are actively for the oppression and misery of others, even as a nominally &#39;Republican&#39; state? <br><br>And that perhaps you need to fact check better, prior to making such roundabout derogatory insults?   </p>

            <p>We don&#39;t really have nationwide referendums, only local ones, for reasons that are complicated but have a lot to do with this specific subject. It goes back to the days of Prohibition (and sabbath laws, prohibiting work on Sunday) when there was a lot of debate over whether the majority could or should decide laws that mainly impacted a minority of any size (Catholics and liquor-store owners, since the majority Protestants at that point were forbidden to drink) and those who believed the sabbath was a Saturday (Jews, Seventh-Day Adventists). Local referendums can only do so much in America - the biggest question is usually who they get elected, who then gets to decide policies (and appoint Supreme Court justices, at the presidential level).<br><br>…<br><br>/gets off historian soapbox</p>

            <p>Provided this does not require churches to officiate same-sex marriage ceremonies, which if it does then there is a real big First Amendment Issue, I think the only real opposition this is going to get is going to be from groups like the Westboro Baptist Church.<br><br>Most religious people I know are going to be fine with this ruling provided it does not force them to officiate the marriages.

            <p>I think some (perhaps many) will be against the ruling, but I don&#39;t know if anyone will actually do anything. Eventually, it&#39;s quite probable that such officiatons will be forced upon them, following in the footsteps of private businesses. In fact, some churches that host weddings have already been forced to either accommodate same-sex weddings or stop offering their building to the public. All of this, of course, is unconstitutional-- we do not have a right to goods and services. </p>

            <p>If I were marrying another girl, I wouldn&#39;t want a homophobic pastor marrying us. It would just spoil things to force somebody to do it who didn&#39;t think our being married was legit. That would be as bad as inviting your high school bully to your graduation party and asking them to give a speech.<br><br>So... I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be a huge issue. There will probably be test cases and it&#39;ll be decided one way or another; but there&#39;s no reason pastors should have to officiate at a wedding if they don&#39;t want to, since people can get married by a judge and have a ceremony outside a church, or say their vows to each other, or find a church that&#39;s gay-friendly, or not have a wedding at all.<br><br>But yeah, I think that if a pastor seriously doesn&#39;t want to marry a gay couple, then there probably aren&#39;t too many gay couples who&#39;d want that pastor at their wedding.</p>

            <p>With Catholicism, the sacrament of marriage is still defined as being between one man and one woman. It&#39;s very unlikely that that will change any time in the near (or not so near) future, especially since we don&#39;t yet have any women priests and even <i>that</i> is unlikely to change anytime soon. </p>

            <p>Really the bigger issue is going to be if the government forces Churches to preside over the weddings, then it is a severe violate of Freedom of Religion.<br><br>I do not think they will, because under <i>Lemon v. Kurtzman</i> in order to avoid running afoul of the Establishment Clause, there cannot be &quot;excessive entanglements with Religion&quot;.  And forcing churches to do something would be an excessive entanglement.  Of course, the Establishment Clause is never used in that way, and Lemon is an Establishment Clause case...<br><br>But even so, forcing a church to to officiate same-sex marriage, does pose an even greater risk with regards to the Free Exercise Clause.  Though it is tough to say what the Court would rule, its Establishment and Free Exercise Jurisprudence have been all over the place over the years.  <br><br>As to no right to goods and services, your statement is over-broad.  By holding the Affordable Care Act as Constitutional the Court is basically saying there is a right to the healthcare provided under it.  Then there is also the Right to have an abortion (<i>Roe v. Wade</i>).  Further Police and Fire services are also services that there is an absolute right to.  Further you have the <i>Brown v. Boar of Ed.</i> which required total desegregation.  As a result, schools, private businesses, etc.  had to integrate.   <br><br>Further things like Power and Water are also something people have a right to.  Between the Federal Power Commission and all the State Regulatory Organizations, anyone is allowed access to the power grid, if they do not have it.  Then there is also distributive power, which says that there is a right to have a private power company buy excess power that you produce.  <br><br>A more correct statement would be, there is no right for Person A to get product B from supplier C, but even then there are limits to that, (see desegregation, distributive power).  That also reminds me of the entire doctrine of Specific Performance which can force a seller to sell a certain object to a buyer.  (Of Course it is usually only Real Estate).  </p>

            <p>I know it has not been proposed, but I do know that that is probably going to be one of the arguments made in the coming months.  So from an analytical stand point, if either a State or the Federal Government were to require that, then there would be a very large fight.  Very similar to the fights that occurred during desegregation.  Though the main difference between the two is which part of the First Amendment at issue.<br><br>During desegregation it was generally the right to association at issue.  This would, and has been, largely be about Free Exercise and Establishment.  And the Court&#39;s Jurisprudence on those topics is a complete mess, riddled with inconsistencies.  <br><br>The more interesting question will not be forcing a minister from church A to preside over the ceremony, but whether the actual structure itself could be used.  That will be a more interesting question.  That I think under what trend the jurisprudence has developed, that it might be a case of, if you let different sex marriages in the building then you should let same-sex.  But nothing is certain, because as I said, this field is a mess.<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Constitutional law is not always black-and-white, but you&#39;ll recall that in the 1960s, many restaurants wouldn&#39;t serve black customers. One of the protests was &quot;sit-in&quot;s, and, for the record &quot;miscegenation,&quot; or &quot;race-mixing&quot; was cited as a religious concern for some churches who were honestly arguing that it was against Biblical standards to allow interracial marriage (or integration, period), and that therefore it was their constitutional right to refuse service to black customers. (This is called &quot;the children of Ham&quot; argument, if you care to research further.)<br><br>Of course, now it is illegal, regardless of one&#39;s religious belief about race mixing, to deny service to a customer based on their race. And that is not seen as unconstitutional. </p>

            <p>It varies by jurisdiction, but in some States, depending on the circumstances, a Court could require it.  <br><br>Take this for an example, A orders a Cake from Boudin Bakers, their designs are unique, everyone in the State of Freemont knows it.  They are the greatest bakers in the state.  Chef Bob has started work on A&#39;s wedding cake, and has nearly completed it, he just needs to put a few finishing touches on the cake when he realizes that this wedding cake is for the wedding of Adam and Jim.  Chef Bob realizes that this is for a same-sex marriage.  He is vigorously opposed to it, and he refuses to finish the cake.  A brings a suit, seeking specific performance, or in other words an order from the Court requiring Chef Bob to finish the Cake.  <br><br>In this situation, some States might allow A specific performance.  This is not an Unconstitutional Remedy.  Now the general common law would probably not allow this, but general common law highly disfavors specific performance.  But some States do allow this.  Also if it was Unconstitutional, then the RFRA like statutes at issue in Kentucky and Arkansas (among others) would not have been needed.  It is though an unsettled area, what the effects will be is still unclear.</p>

            <p>To say a corporation (whether it is for-profit or not) does have rights.  They are not the same as a natural person, but they do have them.  One need look no further than <i>Citizens United v. FEC</i>.  Court held that corporations have the right to engage in political speech.  There was also <i>Dartmouth College v. Woodward</i> an 1819 case that extended the Contracts Clause to Juridical Persons (corporations).  There are a host of others, though the citations escape me at the moment that extend varying levels of speech protection for a corporation.  Corporations are also able to own property.<br><br>In short, corporations do have rights.  They are not in the same bundle of rights that a natural person owns, but they still have rights.<br><br>Now on to the original question about Free Association, this argument has been made during desegregation.

            <p>I just don&#39;t have the cites off the top of my head.  Because same-sex couples are considered a suspect class (i.e., meaning that they are a group whose rights have been violated in the past), there will need to be some non-discriminatory reason to prevent service.  Like not wearing shoes when the entered the premises with a clearly identifiable &quot;No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service&quot; Sign.<br><br>That being said, it seems that Alleb is saying that in their opinion it should be Unconstitutional to force Chef Bob to bake that cake, then that is a bit different.    And you are right, under the strict construction interpretive scheme, you are not wrong.  But the Court has abandoned textualism over the years, and those arguments rarely succeed.  I cannot remember a recent case were Constitutional Textualism (strict construction) actually succeeded.  <br><br>But now because I&#39;m on this topic, I&#39;ll go ahead and toss  this in.  Historically there have been really three main kinds of Constitutional Interpretation.<br><br>1)  Textualism:  Which is about strict construction, plain meaning, and the like.  This is not real common now, but before the 20th Century this was in many cases the main approach.<br><br>2)  Originalism:  This is a dying interpretation.  Basically it means you look back at the founder&#39;s intent.  Justices Scalia and Thomas are best known for using this.  In most cases this is usually going fail.      <br><br>3)  Living Constitution:  This is the main one that the Court tends to use at this point.  It is all about bringing the Constitution into the current age.  This is by far the most commonly used scheme by the Court.  <br><br>4)  Federal Common Law:  I am including this one, because it is occasionally used.  Generally when the Court mentions Federal Common Law, it means they are about to make something up.  It is not used often, but when it is, it is usually entertaining.  </p>

            <p>There might be a law in the future that would require churches to host same-sex marriages, and the argument that will be made is that it violates First Amendment Religious Protections.  I think with regards to the building, it will probably be a loosing argument.  The minister on the other hand will be a much more complicated issue.  That will depend on which of two main tests the Court uses.  If the Court applies <i>Lemon</i> then it probably is also a loosing argument. <br><br>If the Court instead applies a modified <i>Reynolds</i> (which focuses on whether belief is actually sincere or not, and if it is actually a religion) then it could go either way.</p>

            <p>Though to be fair, I did just get two law degrees, so I should hope that I have a good understanding of the law.<br><br>As for the fine, the answer is really unsettled.  It depends on how the law is actually written, it also depends on what the State Constitution says.  It would really though come down to whether the law is sufficiently narrowly tailored.  Without the law at issue in front of me I cannot be certain, but often times with something like this, the Supreme Court will look at it as<br><br>1)  Is there a substantial government interest?<br>2)  Does the law serve that interest?<br>3)  Is this the least restrictive means?<br><br>Though to be fair that analysis is usually reserved for Dormant Commerce Clause issues.

            <p>But you are essentially correct.  You have the ability to have those things, but the government is not required to provide it.  And the general rule is that most retailers can chose to not serve certain individuals (assuming said retailer/provider is a private individual), however there are restrictions.  After <i>Brown</i> and its progeny even private individuals are not allowed to segregate.<br><br>So using your Ferrari example a better statement would be, I have the right to own a Ferrari, provided I can afford it.  I also have a right to drive it, provided I meet the requirements (driver&#39;s license, insurance, and the vehicle itself is street legal).  But I do not have a default right to the Red 2011 Ferrari Enzo from Bob&#39;s Imports.  Bob can choose to decline to sell to me, but as I indicated there are restrictions.  This can change in certain circumstances.  In my post above I mention Specific Performance.<br><br>I also realize I did not really explain it well, so here it is.  If something is unique, or one party to a contract (the buyer here) has made it clear that they are only interested in that particular object (the 2011 Ferrari Enzo sold by Bob).  If Bob and I agree that I will purchase that 2011 Ferrari Enzo, and if Bob does not deliver the Ferrari after I have paid the price, then that creates a right to that particular Ferrari.  And I can go to a Court and in most States (not all) the Court would order Bob to sell that Ferrari.<br><br>Now taking it out of the abstract and putting it into the practical, practically you are also correct, a merchant will not refuse to sell a good if you can afford it and have tendered payment.<br><br>Now on to the other part of this, which I did not address above, but it warrants some discussion, on the practice of religion, the law is a bit more complicated.  As I mention above, the Court&#39;s Jurisprudence with regard to religion is...murky at best. <br><br>A big issue involved here is from <i>Employment Division v. Smith</i>  This was a case from 1990. Oregon had a law criminalizing the use of Peyote, two individuals were members of the Native American Religion (that&#39;s how it was identified), and as part of their practice they used Peyote for certain rituals.  They were arrested and discharged from their jobs.  They brought suit alleging a violation of their right to Free Exercise of Religion.  The Court held here that because the law applied generally it was valid, and as such the law criminalizing Peyote use even as applied to Smith was Constitutional.  This generally applicability is a key rule that we will see show up again in the coming months, and this is why individuals might still be obligated to provide certain services for same-sex marriages.<br><br>The next key development was that immediately after <i>Smith</i> Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).  It stated that among other things, interests in religious freedom were to be protected.  In 1997 the Supreme Court held in <i>City of Boerne v. Flores</i> that the law was Unconstitutional with regards to the States.  It could not force states to add more protection for religious freedom.  The issue here is there have been several laws recently that are very similar to the RFRA.  The one that comes to mind is Arkansas, where the law basically states that a business can choose not to sell to same-sex couple on the basis of religious belief or obligation.  In other words, its is basically RFRA with a slightly different goal.  The problem is the Court has already found RFRA Unconstitutional, but that was from the Federal side.  As of now it is unsettled, but I am certain that these provisions will be invalided on a similar basis that segregation was disallowed.  <br><br>I hope that answers your question. </p>

            <p>There are only two ways that it could be overturned at this point.  The Court could indeed overrule itself, but that is unlikely to happen, even with a change in the Court.  The Court, though they often claim otherwise, still follows public opinion and the overwhelming majority of Americans support this result.  And one of things that I noticed, close to about 1/2 of Conservatives also support this result.  In other words, popular opinion will prevent future Courts from changing its decision.<br><br>Now without having read the decision yet, there is one other guaranteed way that it could be overturned.  And it is as Calista rightly stated, a Constitutional Amendment.    And they are very difficult to get passed.  And an Amendment that would prevent same-sex marriage would never have the popular support to survive.<br><br>However, if the Court did not actually say that the Constitution required the recognition of the right, then Congress could legislate it, but from what I have read it was a Constitutional Decision, and the Court is the final say on the Constitution.  And the only way to change that is either the Court overruling a previous decision, see <i>Brown v. Board of Ed.</i> (holding that <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>&#39;s Separate, But Equal Doctrine was Unconstitutional) or it would need to superseded by Constitutional Amendment, see <i>Chisholm v. Georgia</i> (holding States did not have Sovereign Immunity), which was immediately superseded by the 11th Amendment.<br><br>And for clarification, when it comes to Constitutional Issues, the Supreme Court actually does have the last word, see <i>Marbury v. Madison</i> (&quot;It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.  Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that<br>rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.&quot;  Or perhaps more simply Marbury establishes Judicial Review)  Which for those that do no know what Judicial Review is, it is one of the most important duties of the Supreme Court of the United States.  It means that they have the right to declare a law Unconstitutional, which if that is done then the law must be stricken and is unenforceable.  The only way that this can be changed is either through Amendment or a subsequent Judicial Opinion overruling the previous one.  Both are very rare.  <br><br><i>Brown</i> was basically the exception.  If any if any length of time passes it becomes very hard for the Court to overrule itself, because lower courts rely on the decisions, and especially something like this, where not only lower courts, but State Governments will have relied upon it.  The reason <i>Brown</i> came out the way it did, was frankly, that&#39;s how the wind was blowing.  And that&#39;s the same thing here.  This decision will not be overruled.<br><br>So the only way for the decision to no longer stand, again assuming it is based on Constitutional Grounds (which I am certain it is, seeing as several of the laws that were invalidated were State Constitutions, generally the only way a provision in a State Constitution can be invalidated is if the Court finds a Fundamental Constitutional Right (under the Federal Constitution)), then the only way to supersede it is to pass an Amendment.  But, in order to do that you need popular support and it will not exist for an Amendment that allows States to ban same-sex marriage.  Though I suspect someone will probably have already introduced such an Amendment, it will never pass.<br><br>The TL;DR version:  It is possible, but so unlikely that for all intents and purposes, this decision cannot be overruled.<br>    </p>

            <p>Today is a special day, dear brethren. It was on this day, June 26th, eighteen years ago <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone</i> hit the British bookshelves. But... do you know why this day is special in 2015, aside from the obvious anniversary? <br><br><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_iBwZKM-bO8/VY0iwPPrJEI/AAAAAAAAGDc/Cc8i_HRqZwE/s640/timthumb.png" alt="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_iBwZKM-bO8/VY0iwPPrJEI/AAAAAAAAGDc/Cc8i_HRqZwE/s640/timthumb.png"> <br><br>THIS is the title of a theatre play inspired by Her Majesty Rowling&#39;s stories AND in cooperation with her. Originally, when it was speculated in 2013, it was supposed to be a story following Harry&#39;s life before Hogwarts.<br><br>But today, J.K. Rowling revealed, the play will portray the world BEFORE Voldemort killing Lily and James Potter. I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll get to see infant Harry, but it will still be nice to see. Also, this is NOT a prequel to the series.</p>

            <p>With a title like that and it having been stated that this isn&#39;t a direct prequel, I think it&#39;ll focus more on the politics of the Order of the Phoenix during or soon after the Prophecy is told. It just seems to fit, is all. =]</p>

            <p>Pirates of the Caribbean is one of those continua that everyone has to go into at least once. What really struck me about this one was the casual mixing of modern and old-time mores, actions, and speech. It&#39;s as though the writer hadn&#39;t a clue that back then women didn&#39;t become pirates (well, usually), nor did gentlemen address young ladies by their first names, nor did young ladies call on each other in their bedrooms rather than their parlors.<br><br>If you are going to write a period piece, doesn&#39;t it behoove you to actually read about the time period in question? <br><br>Ah... fanbrats.<br><br>Nice job, dear.

            <p>But it still baffles me how a species that more than likely dealt with emotional species and are supposedly geniuses couldn&#39;t understand what they were doing wrong. That and the fact that they save the environment of the worlds they visit but steal sapient species&#39; bodies and erase their minds from existence sounds very exploitive as they get to have the worlds all to themselves (that&#39;s my interpretation and it really doesn&#39;t match how they act, so it is more or less where the problem is for me). Everything about the Souls screams self-righteous, pretentious, stupid, greedy, sociopathic and hypocritical. <br><br>I consider them worse than the Chaos Gods and Nyarlathotep, or Joffery and Umbridge (and yes, I know what I mean when I say those characters names and claim the Souls are worse than them).    <br><br>I would recommend better sci-fi from Dune, Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, Star Trek, Firefly and Star Wars over The Host any day.</p>

            <p>... I can&#39;t tell if Meyer&#39;s actually started to get better at story writing or simply got lucky now that you pointed that out (though humanity is not a species that follows one personality, most of the time).<br><br>Have to admit the idea is good but it&#39;s sacrificed for the romance and love triangle (again).<br><br>Which is really weird and sad because some of Meyer&#39;s ideax are not bad and Dracula could stand in the sunlight in the original novel but was weakened by it. Her main problem though is that the good ideas are tossed off of the boat for the &#39;romantic plot tumours&#39; which quite frankly horribly done and plain uninteresting.</p>

            <p>(Her name is Stephenie Meyer, by the way; I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve gotten her name right yet.)<br><br>Anyway: Steph likes happy endings, to the extent that she&#39;ll force them onto her characters. Jacob imprints on Stupidname because it lets him get over Bella. Wanda survives because her dying would be sad. Bella is able to have babies after turning into a vampire despite the fact that vampires can&#39;t have babies because she&#39;d be happier if she had babies.<br><br>It&#39;s bad writing, absolutely. Though she&#39;s hardly the only one to do it... writers like their characters to make sacrifices, but they <i>really</i> don&#39;t like them to live with the consequences. I prefer the Tolkien-Duane-Butcher method, in which sacrifices &#39;stick&#39; - they don&#39;t just get magically fixed - but the characters are able to pull through the consequences and find a <i>different</i> happy ending. Yes, it&#39;s often bittersweet - but it beats &#39;nooooo how can this happen oh nevermind it&#39;s all better now&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I know how it feels to try and put a rather harsh painful consequence on characters. The problem is that you get emotionally attach to them as the readers would.<br><br>And I&#39;d have to agree on the Tolkien-Daune-Butcher method. It gives the characters some development and it&#39;s more impressive when they get their happy ending.<br><br>Unfortunately, the recent trend of Spider-man comics starting from One More Day shows there&#39;s a difference between a fair lose and having them crawl on their hands and knees with a mountain on their back... only to find themselves having gone around in a circle.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s 150 years old and written by a Victorian clergyman; I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d dare! It&#39;s probably quite poetic in places (I know the final paragraph is a classic), but it&#39;s also probably fairly dense and rambling. And it&#39;s not like scripture - Darwin&#39;s work has been built on, corrected, turned upside down and shaken to see what falls out, all that. (For one thing, he lived before anyone had ever heard of DNA; for another, when he was writing, the word &#39;dinosaur&#39; was less than twenty years old!) I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to learn about evolution, any more than I&#39;d recommend <i>On the Revolutions</i> to learn about the solar system, or the <i>Principa</i> to learn about gravity.<br><br>As for what I <i>would</i> recommend: well, I already said <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_evolution">this Wikipedia article</a>, but other than that: do you read Terry Pratchett&#39;s <i>Discworld</i>? If so, the first <i>Science of Discworld</i> book is something of a trip through the history of life on Earth; it&#39;s well-written and informative without being overly technical. (<i>SciDisc3</i> is technically the evolution volume, but it&#39;s not nearly as good).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Not strictly about evolutionary theory, but rather about how science and religion actually need each other and should really shake hands and learn to work together to make the world a better place:<br><br><a href="http://thankgodforevolution.com/book"><i>Thank God for Evolution</i> by Michael Dowd</a><br><br>I bought this book after hearing the author speak at my mom&#39;s UU church in Minneapolis.

            <p>I do not see that act of killing another human being as inherently wrong.  I do not see things in black or white, I am a moral relativist.  <br><br>Take for example this hypothetical, A kills B for monetary gain.  Is this wrong?  I would say as a general rule as yes.  But now lets change it up a bit.  A kills B, but but was about to kill C.  Is this wrong?  I do not think so.  Or taking it further.  A kills B, but B is an enemy combatant during a war.  Is that wrong?  No.  <br><br>For me the reason I see murder, which I will chose to define as the unjustified killing of another, as wrong is because of its overall effect on society.  I very much subscribe to Thomas Hobbes&#39; State of Nature theory, &quot;during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called warre; and such a warre as is of every man against every man&quot;<br><br>Or put another way, I believe humans really are just animals.  But animals with the capacity for something greater.  But I think we do need civilization to keep our baser instincts in check.  Just look at what happens during times of great chaos:  looting, killing, other acts of violence.  In those times when civilization fails, I think we see what humans really are.  So I think that murder, as I defined it above, is wrong because it harms civilization as a whole, and brings humanity closer to their natural state.  <br><br>Of course, evolution and my personal religion are not inconsistent, but I do not need someone in a fancy hat to tell me the unjustified killing of another is wrong.  It is because it harms society and civilization as a whole.</p>

            <p>Man, I wish I hadn&#39;t missed this thread.<br>EvilAI, your second case can get even more subtle: what if A didn&#39;t kill B because B was going to kill C, but for reasons unrelated?

            <p>I used to see things as very absolute, but now I see it as very relative (of course I still see certain things as absolute, because I see no possible justification for it), but with something like killing, whether or not it is morally wrong, is relative.  I see the need to focus on the actor and why the actor acted in such a way.  As to your quote, it is a philosophical debate that has no real answer.   <br></p>

            <p>I actually find this very interesting to think about. For a bit of context, I am a spiritual person, and my spirituality involves a great awe and wonder at all of existence. I personally find it <i>more</i> wondrous if it happened on its own rather than at the hand of some creator, because just think of everything that had to go right! It&#39;s amazing! It makes me so grateful to be alive and healthy, because I know there are thousands, maybe millions of ways it can all go wrong. The revelations of science are therefore a spiritual matter for me.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say science is my <i>religion</i>, though. My religion is Unitarian Universalism, and what makes me a UU is basically how I behave and relate in society. I try to follow the <a href="http://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/principles">seven principles</a>, the first of which is that every person has inherent worth and dignity (and should be treated as such). That right there makes murder wrong.<br><br>But why? Where does morality come from, if there is no supreme authority such as God (which I think is really what Alleb means here)?<br><br>Well, I think it comes from us, together. We humans are unique in that we can choose, consciously, how to behave. We are uniquely capable of introspection, self-reflection, and recognizing that what we might <i>want</i> to do is not always what is <i>best</i> to do. Somehow, when a bunch of human beings get together, all of that comes together in recognition of the fact that letting people kill people whenever they feel like it is not what is best. If nothing else, if we let the killer murder <i>that</i> person, what&#39;s to stop them from killing me? And further, we have empathy (once our brains finish cooking at about the age of 25-30, anyway). We recognize the suffering that a person&#39;s death causes their friends and family, and we understand that should someone kill our friend or family, we would suffer, too. We don&#39;t want to suffer because it feels bad, and we don&#39;t want others to suffer because we recognize that they would feel bad, too.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how much sense I&#39;m making, but it&#39;s really a difficult question. I think ultimately I feel the same way about morality that I do about other aspects of existence, though: it is a far, far greater thing if we do it because we recognize the good in it for ourselves, rather than only doing it because some god tells us we have to or else.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>A little while back I went to my first UU service. It was very cool and actually way exciting! My friends have been teasing me for a while about how I&#39;m destined to wind up a pagan in the UU ranks (as is my girlfriend), but even having heard you and Phobos talk about it, I was unprepared for how... I don&#39;t know, how <i>open</i> it was. The reason I&#39;d been taking a break from the Episcopal church was I&#39;d started to feel there was really no place for me in their service. I was so unprepared for a thoroughly non-theistic-centered approach to religion! It was an <i>awesome</i> experience, though.<br><br>Anyway - the point is, my girlfriend is currently at the General Assembly in Portland, and has been texting me all weekend about hearing talks on Sufiism, and how getting to hear Dr. Cornel West speak has been one of the greatest experiences of her life. It&#39;s been really awesome hearing about it, and I&#39;ve been meaning to tell you for a while that I have been slowly sliding into the UU community here in town.</p>

            <p>Yeah, the only way to really get what we&#39;re all about is to go to a service or ten, possibly at a couple different churches/fellowships/whatever the congregation calls their building, and maybe a couple cons and/or GA or something, and of course talk to a whole bunch of us. {= )<br><br>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re liking it!

            <p>I went through this, and it <i>hurt</i>, a lot. Questioning everything, wondering why anything means anything to you anymore, etc. I&#39;m sorry for your stress and heartache, and I hope you come out of this okay.<br><br>Here&#39;s my answer: what you feel, and what you see in others, is what matters. How we got here as humans, how long we&#39;ve been here, who came from where, none of those answers should make you feel less loved. Or less loving. The existence and/or nature of God does not change the physical world and its science, and knowing the marvels of living things that were born and died milennia before any human does not change how grateful I am for the experience of being born, living, loving, and dying.<br><br>Think very seriously about this - if you will never, ever be seen, by anyone, God or man or beast, would you kill someone you loved? Of course not. Murder is wrong because to harm others is wrong. Whether you believe that God wrote that into your conscience or not, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it <i>is</i> written on your conscious.<br><br>Whatever answer you come out with, <i>that&#39;s</i> what is important. The fact that you or I came to be here through a series of tics in the genetic code does not change the experiences we have today.</p>

            <p>1/ If 2+2 = 4, then why is murder wrong? If gravity pulls down, then why is murder wrong? If America owns Alaska, then why is murder wrong? Evolutionary science, like virtually everything in the entire world, has no bearing on morality.<br><br>2/ If you were implying &#39;because surely murder is an evolutionary tactic to ensure your genetic supremacy&#39; (or words to that effect, I doubt you&#39;d be that blunt about it), then the equivalent question is: if the germ theory of disease is correct, then why is medicine okay?<br><br>The answer is: because science isn&#39;t about making sure natural laws &#39;fulfil their potential&#39; or somesuch. It&#39;s about figuring out <i>how the world works</i>, not <i>what we should do about it</i>.<br><br>The universe doesn&#39;t care if we do our level best to prevent the evolution-by-murder of humanity. Why would it? It&#39;s a universe! But <b>we</b> care. As all the various discussions of empathy tried to explain - people care about people. And we&#39;re willing to fight against gravity (with aeroplanes), natural resource limits (with agriculture), microbes (with medicine), and evolution (with legal systems) to protect and uplift each other.<br><br>And I for one think that&#39;s wonderful.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: If you&#39;re still reading! I highly recommend you <i>actually</i> study the matter, instead of simply looking up <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=279182">&#39;the proper defences&#39;</a>. In this and any other discussion of verifiable (or falsifiable) facts: find out what the facts are! Find out what the evidence is! Then decide <i>for yourself</i> whether you agree with it, based on any collection of evidence that you choose.<br><br>You may conclude that there&#39;s strong evidence for evolutionary science. You may conclude that it&#39;s only weak. You may conclude that it agrees with the Bible, or contradicts it (and should be thrown out), or contradicts it (and the Bible must be wrong). You may conclude that the whole thing is a conspiracy - or a practical joke by God - or a well-supported field of science. I don&#39;t <i>know</i> what you&#39;ll conclude, but I really hope you find your own conclusions, rather than just taking someone else&#39;s.<br><br>In this as in anything: read what supporters say. Read what opponents say. See what adds up and what doesn&#39;t. And draw your own conclusions.<br><br>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_evolution">Wikipedia has an article</a> called &#39;Introduction to evolution&#39;. It&#39;s apparently written to be non-technical, and does have an &#39;Evidence for evolution&#39; section. If you want to actually look into the topic, rather than just compiling a list of counterarguments, that&#39;s probably a good place to start.)<br><br>hS<br><br>PPS: Why is my postscript longer than my script? hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s still considered wrong to kill people. After all, if everyone was killing everyone else, then obviously the human race wouldn&#39;t last very long. Morality is partly about survival.<br><br>And to be perfectly honest? I&#39;m not a Christian, I&#39;m not religious.<br><br>I have a hard time accepting evolution myself.<br><br>There are people out there that believe that the &quot;seven days&quot; thing isn&#39;t literal; that hundreds, if not thousands, if not <i>millions</i> of years were put into God&#39;s creation of the earth.<br><br>And honestly, that makes sense. If you were an eternal, omnipotent artist (which I believe God is, at His most basic level), would you want to rush your work? Or would you spend time perfecting the world you so desire to create?<br><br>Even if God is omnipotent, He probably wanted to make that extra bit sure that His world was, to Him, perfect. He had forever; He took advantage of His eternal nature to ensure that the world was created <i>right</i>.<br><br>Now, I personally believe that once God brought humans into the picture, He decided to take a step back and let us decide our course.

            <p>Religion and science are not mutually exclusive. I&#39;ve heard someone describe it as &quot;God is an artist; science is like the user manual for his tools. It&#39;s the discovery of God&#39;s processes.&quot;<br><br>Honestly? Science is the <i>reason</i> that I believe that God exists. The fact that there is so much order in the universe, and that it can be definitively proven, can only be indicative of intelligent design.<br><br>Now as for morality... as other people have mentioned, it doesn&#39;t exclusively come from God. If it did, everyone who&#39;s not Muslim, Christian or Jewish would be a psychopathic savage, when that&#39;s manifestly not the case. People that don&#39;t follow God can still be moral paragons; conversely, religious people have been known to do absolutely monstrous things. These false Christians/Muslims/Jews believe that their religion gives them a free pass to do whatever horrible things they want to people that don&#39;t follow their beliefs.<br><br>Evolution ≠ murder being okay. Science has <i>nothing</i> to do with morality.</p>

            <p>A Holy Grail War, a la Fate franchise, of course! If someone could add more to my idea, it&#39;s very welcome. I am not very sure where this is going either. Oh, and Fate/Stay Night spoilers abound.<br><br>Darth Sidious and Lord Voldemort are both capable Casters, as their attacks are based on magic. But as Lord Voldemort doesn&#39;t have the capability to employ melee weapons, Darth Sidious are to fall under another class, perhaps as Saber. Fits with him fighting with a sword.<br><br>What measures the power of Heroic Spirits, should both have the right to stay in the Throne of Heroes, are fame, as defined by their popularity amongst the people in the world, and Mystery, defined by how mysterious their skill, magic, or weapons are.<br><br>Darth Sidious is rather talented when employing the Force, and also fights very well with his lightsaber. Having high charisma allows him to employ politics to his gain, allowing to control the Republic for decades, then rule as Emperor. His unfulfilled wish is to... well I have no idea, but it will be important in determining his actions. His Fame stretches many planetary systems, and lasted for millennia, seeing that we have a movie in his dishonour. His Mystery also is great, since we humans could not grasp the concept of The Force and manipulate it to our will.<br><br>Voldemort has split his soul to eight, seven stored in vessels, and one remains in his body. He inspires fear and have managed to escape death, both physically and metaphorically by inspiring fear. However he is defeated by a hero, and his unfulfilled wish is simple vengeance and total control of the world of wizardry. His Fame is short, but not to be underestimated, despite knowledge of him and his actions are censored to the Muggles by the Minstry&#39;s efforts. His Mystery is also less, as his magic is understood by many and his campaign is known by all magicians.<br><br>Darth Sidious may be dismayed if he knows the Fuyuki Holy Grail is tainted will Angra Mainyu. Why would he want to destroy? Siths want to rule, and wish machines that interprets all wishes destructively is useless to them. But Voldemort will find it useful, since he will just ask that all who are not pureblood magicians and mages killed. Straightforward enough.<br><br>I believe Darth Sidious and Lord Voldemort will have equal footing in this arena. Darth Sidious&#39; ability with his sword will massively increase, but so does Lord Voldemort&#39;s magecraft. It&#39;s up to their masters and their skills to carry the day.<br><br>I say canon thrown aside, as the oldest hero is Gilgamesh, no Heroic Spirits has been chosen since early 19th century, only Counter Guardians, and a host of other things that run counter to the three canons.<br><br>Thus, this is my half-cent.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t imagine Voldy and Palpy have just been dropped into an arena together with an unbreakable compulsion to fight each other, so how do they even meet?<br><br>Someone, somewhere, referred to the most recent <i>Star Trek</i> movie as <i>Star Wars: Into Darkness</i>, claiming it was set on the planet Urth in the <i>Star Wars</i> galaxy. Ha ha, funny review, but let&#39;s take that and run with it. The <i>Harry Potter</i> series actually takes place on a planet in the Unknown Regions, shortly after the rise of the Galactic Empire.<br><br>An Imperial scout ship happens upon the planet, and by total fluke lands in England, right next to Voldemort&#39;s hideout. This is Voldemort at the height of his regained power, I guess - somewhere in Book Six? I don&#39;t know, I never read that far.<br><br>So what would Voldemort do about the human-form high-tech alien who&#39;s just landed near him? Um... short out his shuttle due to ambient magical fields, probably! Then I guess probably kill him on general principles.<br><br>But what&#39;s this? Another total fluke, and Palpatine was paying special attention to that scout (it was an envoy to contact Mitth&#39;raw&#39;nuruodo of the Chiss Ascendancy, since you insist on knowing), and noticed it had gone missing, and where. He sends down a probe droid, which also fails - but not before capturing long-distance footage of the grounded shuttle and Voldemort&#39;s base.<br><br>Now, this anti-technology field is something Palpatine can get behind. Imagine building a giant space station to project it onto a planet - a sort of &#39;Stone Age Cannon&#39; if you will (Sidious&#39; note to self: have to think of more awesome name). The inhabitants would be either rendered defenceless, or adequately punished for a minor transgression, at much less expense than dropping a fleet of Star Destroyers on them. So Palpy sets a high-altitude watch over Urth, and specifically over England, to see how Voldemort is making it.<br><br>The observations reveal that Voldemort is clearly employing some kind of Force technique, albeit one not mentioned in Sith records; he is also manifestly a Dark Side user, which makes him both a potential ally and a potential threat. Hmm.<br><br>Palpatine is regrettably unable to use Vader in this endeavor (technology, you know), so he instead slips one of his Hands onto Urth. Let&#39;s make it Mara Jade. She&#39;s tasked with getting close enough to Voldemort to figure out which category he falls into: ally or threat.<br><br>How does she do? That depends on a few questions I don&#39;t have the answer to:<br><br>1/ Are there magical &#39;wards&#39; and alarm spells in <i>Harry Potter</i>? If so, Mara can&#39;t spot them (since they aren&#39;t <i>actually</i> based on the Force - that&#39;s just Sidious&#39; interpretation), and gets caught when she tries to sneak in. Since she&#39;s never been noted for the strength of her Force abilities, unless she can sneak back out again she probably gets AK&#39;d.<br><br>2/ If she succeeds in sneaking in, Mara will need to draw a conclusion about Voldemort&#39;s stability. How likely would he be to accept an alliance? Palpatine has previously &#39;allied&#39; with indigenous Force users (such as the Nightsisters), and ensured they never leave their planet. But... Voldemort&#39;s never struck me as the most stable type. I think Mara would classify him as &#39;just wants to watch the world burn&#39;. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br><br>In the event that Mara either dies, or tells Sidious an alliance is impossible, Sidious probably decides to wipe the slate clean. Is there a spell to counter orbital bombardment? Mmm... probably not. Sidious wins.<br><br>If Mara proposes an alliance, she&#39;ll probably be in charge of negotiating with Voldemort (since she&#39;s already on the ground, has the defensive skills to keep her safe, and has the added help of possibly reading his mind). That alliance will consist of the Empire sending  non-technological supplies to Voldemort (armour? Spice? Money?), while Voldemort sends someone up to the orbiting ship to teach Palpatine about their form of &#39;magic&#39;.<br><br>No, says Sidious, I wouldn&#39;t dream of asking you to come yourself - you&#39;re much too busy in your exceptionally worthwhile war against Dumblewarts.<br><br>Which may lead to a temporary victory for Voldemort, if he sees through Palpatine&#39;s plan to keep him on Urth forever and sends, for instance, Bellatrix Lestrange. If she can act sane for long enough to reach Sidious&#39; presence, she could probably hit him with an AK before he can react, killing him. It&#39;s a suicide mission, but it should work.<br><br>But that <i>is</i> a temporary victory. Let&#39;s be generous and assume that Palpy&#39;s death causes the destruction of his ship (he&#39;s a load-bearing Sith Lord), so there&#39;s no immediate retribution. But... Palpatine has clones waiting to take his spirit. Unless Voldemort can get away from Urth before the Emperor comes back, he and his entire planet are toast.<br><br>(And could he? That depends on the precise effect of magic on technology. I suppose with some delicate use of the Imperius Curse Voldy could claim an Imperial supply shuttle and its crew... but why would he bother? He <i>doesn&#39;t know that Palpatine can come back.</i>)<br><br>In the end, Darth Sidious wins. He either nukes Voldemort from orbit, locks him into an alliance which never lets him get off Urth, or dies, comes back, and <i>then</i> nukes Voldemort from orbit.<br><br>Sith Lords don&#39;t fight fair. And they don&#39;t fight hand-to-hand if they can possibly help it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Wait, though. Voldemort gets his named underlings with lesser, but still powerful abilities, while Sidious gets Generic Guards? I dunno.

While Voldemort would have no compunction about killing, Sidious has shown he is perfectly capable of destroying entire planets.  So on killer instinct, I have to give Sidious.<br><br>Now close combat.  The only evidence of Voldemort fighting in close quarters that I recall is his duel against Dumbledore in OtP.  Two individuals known for spell casting going up in close combat.  Sidious in Star Wars Canon was shown taking down three members of the Jedi Council in very short order.  He then stalemated (or held back depending on your view) Mace Windu.  The second if not best swordsman in the Jedi Order.  Then we see Sidious effectively defeating Yoda (the best or second best swordsman and strongest force user in the order).  So close combat ability goes to Sidious without question.<br><br>Ranged abilities.  Both have lethal abilities at range, and both have been shown effectively demonstrating both of them.  So I will give this one a wash.  Even for both.<br><br>X-Factors:<br><br>Allied Forces:  Voldemort has his Death Eaters, all are very significant, nasty individuals quite willing to kill for their master.  But Sidious has at a minimum the entire Clone Army (and subsequent Imperial Military) at his disposal.  Ultimately I think Sidious could just through enough soldiers at the Death Eaters to eventually overcome them.  Further Sidious has his apprentices, Darth Maul, Count Dooku, Darth Vader (depending when in Sidious&#39; rise to power this takes place).  That also does not even include things like The Emperor&#39;s Hand.  Sidious also has his elite Imperial Guards with Echani Training (insane fighting ability).  I have to give this to Sidious as well.<br><br>Machinations:  The simple issue here is Voldemort did take power in the UK.  And he was able to work in the shadows for quite some time, remaining unnoticed.  But at the time everyone thought he was dead, and he remained in hiding.  Sidious managed to conquer the Galaxy.  His true nature was never revealed until the very end.  And he managed to maneuver himself into absolute power, while being an incredibly public figure.  The Jedi, who were looking for him, never found out until it was too late.  Sidious gets the win easy here.<br><br>Immortality:  Neither is a true immortality.  Voldemort might have an early edge with the Horcruxes, but if it came down to it, Sidious could have either his apprentice or entire army hunt them down and destroy them.  Voldemort would need to find the clone bodies, destroy them, and fight whatever defenses were in place.  He does not have the numbers that Sidious does, Sidious would be able to destroy them quicker.  Edge Sidious.<br><br>So Final Count:<br><br>Killer Instinct:  Edge Sidious<br>Close Combat:  Edge Sidious<br>Ranged Combat:  Even<br>Allied Forces:  Edge Sidious<br>Machinations:  Edge Sidious<br>Immortality:  Edge Sidious<br><br>Ultimate Answer:  Darth Sidious wins.<br> </a></p>

            <p>First off, does each combatant have their methods of immortality intact? If so, Voldemort wins the first time, and then Sidious has a better chance each time he comes back in a clone body (though his sanity will dwindle). I think it really hinges on whether the Force can be blocked by magic, or spells can be blocked by a lightsaber or the Force. Otherwise, the first AK or Lightning/Choke to hit decides the battle, assuming Voldemort avoids getting close enough to be dismembered by a lightsaber.</p>

            <p>If it&#39;s written, then it&#39;s literature. Another option would be to make a blanket &quot;Web Original&quot; thing to put stuff from the internet in. But, given that I see Homestuck under &quot;Comics,&quot; I&#39;d just stick with the sections we already have. No need to move everything else that we&#39;ve found on the web.<br><br>I&#39;m not a wiki expert, so if someone says something different, you should probably listen to them.</p>

            <p>(Because why the hell not, and I might find new stuff to listen to!)<br>I propose a game as follows: One person posts a piece of music, and the next person posts the piece it makes them think of. So, for example, I post <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd2v8kqjYwc">Hatikva</a>, someone might post <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdtLuyWuPDs">Mб Vlast Moldau</a> (with good reason, too; listen about a minute in).<br><br>Let me start with, hm, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4lPIHihwNE">IDF Marches</a>, which as the name suggests is one of the IDF&#39;s not-oft-used marches.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not often we see outright trollfics on the Board, it&#39;s rare that we see badfics so lazy they&#39;re literally one paragraph long, and still rarer that we see Admiral Pansy.

            <p>I quite liked this! Both agents are very enjoyable, with Trollenfisch being particularly notable. Their reactions to the piece were most understandable. The dramatic turn at the end, however, felt out of place. Maybe I need to go back and more closely read their other mission (which I most definitely will do now).<br><br>I will say that the actual mission part of this (as short as it was) fell prey to the issue of sounding more like a MST than an actual mission. Their responses were almost all dialogue. It would have been nice to see some actual physicality beyond the little that was shown.<br><br>There&#39;s also a sizable PPC continuity error in this piece. Admiral Pansy has been previously written with an exaggerated accent (as seen <a href="http://vgdivision.dreamwidth.org/2599.html">here</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G7CvxuwBvOkHi6_soXCz4YSZOxgioUx2Ah98n0atVPc/pub">here</a>), which is completely missing in this appearance. This was also stated on his wiki page, which is why it always pays to check those first before writing up one of the PPC shared characters.<br><br>So yes! Very nice! Hope to see more with these two in the future.</p>

            <p>Who&#39;d be mean to Gabrielle? Competitive players, basically.<br><br>Flareon is, in terms of competitive play? Preeeeeeeeetty much garbage. Indeed, it is valued less than Garbodor, who is quite litterally (hahaha) a pile of discarded refuse. Flareon&#39;s cute an&#39; all, but it doesn&#39;t have the bulk (or typing) necessary to use Guts effectively and Flash Fire&#39;s completely useless on a physical attacker. Flareon is classified as PU-tier on Showdown, which is the tier <i>below</i> Never Used. They&#39;re rubbish.<br><br>So a new competitive player in need of a Fire-type winds up with a Flareon... and chucks it in the box to rot as soon as they get something better, which is basically <i>anything</i>.<br><br>And that&#39;s how you get Gabrielle&#39;s horrifying self-esteem issues.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s more the trainer. If you think that you&#39;re only ever going to win if you have the Bestest Best Pokйmon Ever, that says a lot more about you as a trainer than it does about your team. I got to the final with a team that&#39;s entirely Rarely Used- and Never Used-tier; you build your team around synergies and core competencies. Tempest, Gabrielle&#39;s trainer, didn&#39;t really understand that. So he waited until he got Uber Fire-types like Ho-Oh and went from there.<br><br>Simply put, Tempest is the kind of person who doesn&#39;t like lower tiers because the mons are bad and you can&#39;t brute force your way to victory. =]<br><br>((Longtime viewers may find it weird that I got 6-0d by Alex in the final. The answer is rather prosaic. Trust me. =] ))</p>
