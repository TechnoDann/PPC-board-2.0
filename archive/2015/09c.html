            <p>It&#39;s gonna be that time of the year starting tomorrow, and in light of that, I thought of a brilliant idea for a contest RP/event thing a little while ago! Basically, from 2013, Tumblr has a habit of circulating tons of skeleton GIFs and pictures in a period dubbed The <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/skeleton-war">&quot;Skeleton War&quot;</a>. In particular, the skeletons are pitted against an enemy faction known as &quot;f***boys&quot; (not unlike Resistance vs. Enlightenment in Ingress). This got me thinking... Why don&#39;t we have an actual PPC Skeleton War, in the form of a series of competitive events as part of a Halloween festival?<br><br>This of course would mean we&#39;d have to set up a variety of games and tournaments for agents to play. This would probably mean I&#39;d have to get a number of other Boarders to help, especially because I was thinking that each of the games would be moderated by a different person and an agent of their choice. I&#39;m not sure how many games there would be, but I imagine at least five would provide something for everyone. Possible events could include a corn maze escape, pumpkin curling, a spooky scavenger hunt, a &quot;last man standing&quot; survival event in a haunted house, and maybe even a poker tournament with tarot cards (yes, <a href="http://thecuria.com/tarotply.html">they have those</a>).<br><br>Of course, this means that Boarders who are willing to volunteer can choose whether to moderate a game or not, as well as propose which game to host if they do. And all of these games will be compiled into GDocs format in the end. Who knows, maybe we can even have opening and closing ceremonies like in conventions!<br><br>The game I&#39;m definitely moderating would probably be the grand finale: the Skeleton War itself, a nonlethal combat tournament between the two respective factions participating in the festival. These factions are &quot;Skeletons&quot; (duh) and &quot;Bratboys&quot; (a watered-down variant of the original term, which is much more appropriate IMO). All agents participating must choose from one of these factions at the start of the festival, but not all of them need to participate in the final battle. They&#39;re more than welcome to spectate and cheer for those who do, though!<br><br>Also, there&#39;d be candy and costumes. Because Halloween.<br><br>If I get enough positive feedback from you guys, I&#39;ll start laying down some rules tomorrow at the earliest, and start the festival proper sometime in mid-October. So, with that in mind, what do you think of this idea?</p>

            <p>The idea of a scavenger hunt through PPC HQ sounds rather entertaining, especially how difficult it is to navigate around the halls at the best of times. I definitely think my agents would be up for that. Of course the real question is just how many agents will we wind up losing just to the halls themselves?</p>

            <p>Actually, delaying the Badfic Games until a more suitable time (same month next year, if necessary) would be fine with me. Since the preferred epilogue for the &quot;Department of Inaccuracies Trilogy&quot; depends on an event that apparently has not happened yet, I’m not really eager to post part three soon.

            <p>For whatever it may be worth, my thoughts are with you. <br><br>As for the Games themselves, it&#39;d definitely be a lot of fun to write some terrible fanfiction, but if you&#39;re not up to it you&#39;re not up to it and I&#39;ll respect your decision.</p>

            <p>...is basically a Halloween festival held within the PPC HQ (or in New Caledonia, if outside is better). Participants are divided into two teams which compete against each other in various games throughout the festival, and the team with the most wins among its individual agents claims the overall victory.<br><br>So, kinda like the New Year&#39;s Gift Exchange, but with multiple games instead of just the one.</p>

            <p>I think you picked a good first badfic. Also, according to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">the wiki</a>, Permission prompts should be about 400-800 words long, and agent bios should be about 200-400 words. They link to a document that describes the kinds of things you can write about, and agent recruitment is among them.<br><br>Sorry about the late reply; I blame college.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I looked at the doc that contains the prompts earlier and I don&#39;t know how I missed the given lengths.

            <p>Anyway, we have round about three inches of snow on the ground. This is super early. Usually, it&#39;s around Halloween when the snow sticks like this. This is unusual, to say the least. But! We can use this to have some fun! Since we have plenty of snow to go around, why don&#39;t we have a...<br><br>SNOWBALL FIGHT!!</p>

            <p>I hoped, sipped, and jumped, as snowballs whistled through the skies, desperately attempting to avoid the barrage of unexpected snowfire. Which aptly explained why I managed to be absolutely covered head to toe in snow. &quot;Oh, come on guys! Let of a little, will ya!?&quot;<br><br>My answer splattered all across my face. &quot;Oh, just you wait! You&#39;ll get yours! Just you- OW!&quot;<br><br>I looked to my right. Good, the fort still stood. I rushed for the old snow fort, taking a few more hits for the team. &quot;Hey! That one had ice it it!&quot; Thankfully, the door to the fort was mere inches away. I busted through the door, a break from the unrelenting flurry of balls. I wiped the dribbling snow of my brow. Now, to plan, until reinforcements arrive. As I took another step, I stumbled over a rope. &quot;Why was...?&quot;<br><br>SPLAT!<br><br>&quot;...&quot;<br><br>&quot;This. Is. War.&quot;</p>

            <p>Well, I think my actual, nice, usable computer has finally bought it. I&#39;ve got some serious issues going on with it, as in, I think I need a new hard drive.

            <p>Okay, I know I&#39;ve popped in a couple of times in the past couple of years with proclamations of a return that nobody wants, but this time I actually mean it.  I&#39;ve finally gotten around to setting pen to paper, or I suppose fingers to keyboard is slightly more realistic, and picked up my agents stories.<br><br>I do however have one general question.  Do people actually still use the IRC chat?  I&#39;ve tried to log onto it a couple of times in the past few days and it&#39;s constantly empty.  Or has it just moved? </p>

            <p>It&#39;s the one who makes one of my favorite spin-offs!  Glad to have you back once more, and I can&#39;t wait to see what happens with your characters!<br><br>The chat just doesn&#39;t see much activity anymore.  Most of the oldbies have grown up and gotten jobs, so we don&#39;t see much time to sit around talking anymore.  But it&#39;s not, like, officially closed, or anything.<br><br>Re the babysitting question: Doc would claim he had too much canon research (aka, reading) to do, and that having a kid around would disrupt his concentration.  Vania . . . would probably volunteer for it, to be honest, so if you&#39;re wanting negative responses, Doc would be the one to use.</p>

            <p>I have no problem with you adding the minor characters to the glossary in the slightest, in fact I thank you for it. The story I&#39;m finishing now has three of my old rookies as agents so I&#39;m planning on updating the bios for them soon, or adding in the case of Wallis. <br><br>Also I&#39;m a tad overwhelmed by the fact it was one of your favourite spinoffs, thank you most kindly. As soon as I&#39;ve found some new recruits the training sessions will resume. Have we rescued any young people from badfics lately that may need training.</p>

            <p>It is a well known established fact, that whenever a huge enemy appears, it will ALWAYS have a glaringly obvious weak point that is very shootable.<br><br>Alternatively, just open a huge portal to a Daemon World, in Warhammer 40k. No sue is going to be able to last more than a few minutes, tops, on one of those. I don&#39;t care what kind of mecha you&#39;re driving, several billion daemons, coupled with the laws of physics (or lack thereof) will annihilate anything. Best part is that, as long as the agents keep their heads down, their SEP fields will keep them alive (Maybe) long enough to make sure.<br><br>Upstairs might not like it, but until they get the PPC some mecha-killing weapons, they should just be glad there&#39;s a way to dispose of sues like this at all.</p>

            <p>I think that, in theory, an APD division specialising in a mecha continuum such as Gundam would be equipped with the proper tech (However, there is no such APD division — yet). Otherwise, Floaters&#39; <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Special_Operations_Division">Special Operations Division</a> or the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/ESAS">Eclectic Subdivision of Advanced Species</a> spring to mind.<br><br>That said (and like what VM said): I reckon the agents would just take the Sue out <i>before</i> she got into her Mecha.

            <p>However, I&#39;d be careful assuming that just because the Sue is in a mecha, the agents would need to be in one as well - an agent specializing in such a &#39;verse would be just as likely, I think, to bypass the Epic Mecha Battle and make handy use of a blowtorch and a wrench to disarm the Sue before dispatching them. </p>

            <p>As so often occurs in puzzles, you find yourself shipwrecked on an island. The population of this island can be partitioned into two groups: knights and knaves. Knights answer all questions truthfully; knaves always lie. While wandering, you come upon a building with two doors, each guarded by one native islander. You know that one of the doors leads to a pile of treasure, and the other leads to a hungry, man-eating lion. You may ask a single yes/no question to one of the guards. Then you must select a door, and meet your fortune/death.<br><br>Challenge: If you know nothing about the distribution of the two islanders (maybe two knights, maybe two knaves, maybe one of each), what question do you ask?<br><br>Hard challenge: The island also contains some residents who reply at random. You happen upon three islanders, and know that there is one of each type (Knave, Knight, Random). You may ask three yes/no questions. (Each question can be addressed to only one of the islanders.)

            <p>The fact that I&#39;m still wandering this island (rather than visiting the harbour and getting a ship home) indicates that this isn&#39;t a sci-fi setting or anything else with decent construction standards. So I climb up onto the roof of the building and peel back some of the thatch, or pull off a couple of tiles, or whatever, to see what&#39;s inside each section.<br><br>Then, since the knights are clearly a bunch of sadists (they let the knaves wander around lying about everything, rather than instituting some kind of legal system), I pop the &#39;lion&#39; door from above and let it eat them.<br><br>Then I leave. I don&#39;t take the treasure. I&#39;m trapped on an island, what am I going to do with treasure?<br><br>To while away the time until a ship passes, I write up a treatise on the bizarre social system which has led to lying being acceptable to the population of the island, to some people literally never lying, and to huts with lions and treasure in them being &#39;guarded&#39; by people who will happily let you be eaten by lions.<br><br>Because seriously.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>After you leave the building, how are you planning to avoid being eaten by the lion?  Since fighting it would defeat the point of your solution and the whole puzzle, and hiding in the building would likely delay rescue and be inconvenient to survival.<br><br>I&#39;m just curious about this; I liked both your response and the puzzle.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s take an example from last time we did this. There was a puzzle wherein you were stuck in a room where the door was only unlocked for one minute every hour, trying to turn the handle any other time would electrocute you, and all you had was a match and a rope that takes two hours to burn. Something along those lines.<br><br>The <i>logic puzzle</i> is &#39;how can you use a 2-hour rope to measure 1 hour?&#39;. In that situation, there&#39;s not very many solutions (though it occurs to me that you might be able to make a pendulum...). But:<br><br><i>That wasn&#39;t the goal we were given.</i> The goal was &#39;escape with only these things&#39;. Following the unspoken rules (you must escape by timing one hour) is... silly.<br><br>You, the puzzle creator, get to set the stage. You say what the building is like. You say what the guards will or won&#39;t do. You say how many questions we&#39;re allowed to ask. And a solution like &#39;I repeatedly ask the guards the same question until they crack and answer it anyway&#39; would go against the spirit of the puzzle, absolutely.<br><br>But doing something that the puzzler didn&#39;t account for? That&#39;s fair game, as far as I&#39;m concerned.<br><br>~<br><br>Since this is supposed to be a practical thread, not just a theory one: here, have a puzzle.<br><br><i>You are on a classic desert island - a small &#39;hill&#39; of sand surrounded entirely by deep water, clear out to the horizon. A single coconut palm grows on the island. You have nothing else except the clothes you were wearing when you came there. There is no ship in sight (nor the wreckage of one), but you know that ships can appear briefly on the horizon at irregular intervals.<br><br>Escape.</i><br><br>I have a solution in mind. I won&#39;t tell you yours is wrong, though. ;)<br><br></p>

            <p>Well, it occurs to me that you need two pieces of information.  1) Which guard is the Knave/Knight 2) Which door has the treasure.<br><br>Asking either guard which door has the treasure is not going to do it.  What if that guard is the Knave?  You die.  Wouldn&#39;t want that to happen.  So, the only way to ensure that you know the truth is to guarantee that you are being lied to.<br><br>Asking Guard 1 what guard 2 would say works because if Guard 1 is the Knave then he will lie about the Knight&#39;s response (which would have been a truthful answer.  Likewise, if Guard 1 is the Knight, he will tell you the truth about Guard 2&#39;s response (which would have been a lie).  Either way, you are being lied to, making the actual identities of the guards irrelevant.  That being the case, take the door they say is certain death.<br><br><br>The hard challenge is much more interesting.  Now you only need one set of information, but the sources of said information are less reliable.<br><br>So, let&#39;s try talking it through.  Label the islanders A, B, and C for simplicity (we&#39;ll need as much of that as we can get).  <br><br>Question 1:<br>Ask A, &quot;Would B say he is certain he could predict C&#39;s answer, if B knew what I was going to ask C?&quot;  Complicated, but a Yes/No question none the less.<br><br>What does A answer?  If Yes, then you are either talking to the Random and B could be either of the others or you are talking to the Knave/Knight and B is the other non-Random.  We really don&#39;t know a whole lot here, just that B is not Random.  Worst case scenario.  We&#39;ll come back to this in a moment.<br><br>If No, then you are talking to the Random.  Neither Knight nor Knave will ever answer this question with a No.  Proceed to ask B &quot;Would C say you are the Knave?&quot; This guarantees you are being lied to, just like the first challenge.  Just switch the answers and use your last question to find out if there&#39;s a nice place to get a drink nearby.<br><br>If anything else, you are talking to either the Knave/Knight and B is the Random.  Neither the Knight nor the Knave can answer this question with a yes or no, because they don&#39;t know if they would be lying or telling the truth.  In that case, guarantee you are being lied to and go enjoy that drink.<br><br>Worst case scenario Question 2:  We know B is non-Random in this scenario, so who better to ask?  Let&#39;s try that same trick again.  &quot;Would A say he is certain he could predict C&#39;s answer, if A knew what I was going to ask C?&quot;<br><br>What does B answer?  If yes, then both A and B are non-Random.  Use your last question to guarantee you are being lied to.<br><br>If no, then you did something very wrong.  This should not be a possible answer.<br><br>If anything else, then A is the Random.  Ask B about C for the Phobos Guarantee and go home.<br><br>Convoluted?  You bet.  Effective, though.<br><br><br>As for the third riddle, word play is less my thing.  I prefer the logic puzzles.  I might take a look at it later, though.<br><br><br>-Phobos, master strategist and professional Knave</p>

It seems you are really good with these logic puzzles. In that case, let&#39;s try this one for good measure: <br><br>You are on an island populated by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth; knaves always lie. You meet a inhabitant of the island who you know is holding up either 1, 2, or 3 fingers behind his back. You don’t know if this inhabitant is a knight or a knave. By asking two yes-or-no questions, determine how many fingers the inhabitant has behind his back.</p>

            <p>So, considering that I wasn&#39;t here for the Emergencies, I may not be the best person to say this (But I will anyway, because it&#39;s important.) But has anyone every written a non-canon Emergency-substitute? Like, a non-canon zombie apocalypse, or something? I feel that the PPC canon is a little stagnant, and that by writing non-canon stuff like this, we would get the best of all worlds (A good status quo, and an evolving canon... as little sense as that makes.) I feel that, based on my research, the Emergencies were a good theory, but were not put into practice in a good way. Because it&#39;s not canon, you wouldn&#39;t need to drag everyone else into your story, just get permission to use stuff in the non-canon spin-off.<br><br>Because, I mean, drama can be just as entertaining as comedy, and you can even use these things for comedy. I also think I am terrible at getting my point across, so if anyone decides to ask further, I would appreciate that. Also, please don&#39;t lynch me for posting this. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Over the past year I have received MANY messages saying that &#39;your Catastrophe Theory is wrong, it&#39;s been proven wrong, it&#39;s three years after your proposed &#39;DOOM&#39;, there are no more Emergencies in HQ&#39;.<br><br>Well, I beg to differ.<br><br>FIRST: Catastrophe Theory is not &#39;mine&#39;; it is a proven FACT.

            <p>What war? How does you getting turned into a girl or a living slime creature count as an emergency? (I&#39;m sorry those happened, of course, but...) How could your &quot;date of doom&quot; have possibly been 2002 when like half the agents around here joined after that date, including me, my partners, Falchion and company, Rina and her partners, that Desdendelle guy I keep hearing about, and Printworthy (among many others)? <br><br>And besides that, we&#39;ve killed five legendary badfics just this year. FIVE. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a sign of doom.<br><br>Last of all, since you asked: A scientific theory is a hypothesis with enough evidence to support it. It is not a fact; it&#39;s the scientists&#39; explanation and interpretation of the facts. (<a href="http://www.livescience.com/21491-what-is-a-scientific-theory-definition-of-theory.html">Source here.</a>) Therefore, your Catastrophe Theory is not a fact, and it&#39;s socially acceptable for me to say that I don&#39;t believe it.

            <p>(Yes, he&#39;s one of mine.)<br><br>There was no such thing as an &#39;Emergency&#39; before they were clamped down on. In fact, unless someone remembers differently, the only &#39;Emergencies&#39; that got anyone upset were Tawaki&#39;s Macrovirus epidemic, and the Mary-Sue Invasion that followed immediately on its heels. The &#39;moratorium&#39; was never intended to be permanent - it was a temporary thing to stop people trying to do more &#39;I can top that&#39; things.<br><br>The definition Sambar is using is &#39;incident which seriously impacted the performance of the PPC or any individual department&#39; (the latter is just there to catch Jay and Acy&#39;s &#39;Tangled Webs&#39; mention). Yes, yes, July&#39;s body-swap RP is &#39;strictly voluntary&#39; - but it still clearly hit most people, and it impacts the ones it didn&#39;t, by taking out Intelligence, FicPsych, the Board of Flowers... That same (lack of) difference applies to the Blackout (which was in <i>exactly</i> the same mold as the Invasion in &#39;08) and, well, most things.<br><br>Yes, you can argue some of them away - but that&#39;s true of the ones before &#39;08, too. There are also other things you could arguably <i>add</i> - Morgan&#39;s little meltdown, the Robecca(?) and Alumia exorcisms, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a bunch of stuff I&#39;ve forgotten about.<br><br>(Oh, and what happened in &#39;02?

            <p>But yeah. The moratorium had to do with people getting burnt out on everything turning into massive drama, like people has to go out of their way to be even More Dramatic and PPC-Changing.<br><br>The bodyswap definitely had potential to go that way which is why I checked for interest, emphasized it being for fun and crack and asked people to not get dark with it. <br><br>Of course it isn&#39;t perfect, but it helps.<br><br>(I like Ypurstorm, by the by.

Here&#39;s an example of the final product:<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/PPC/Agent%20IDs/Nume-ID-front.png"><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/Neshomeh/PPC/Agent%20IDs/Nume-ID-back.png"><br><br>You can see more examples, including some variations from &quot;standard,&quot; <a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/user/Neshomeh/library/PPC/Agent%20IDs">here</a>. If you like what you see, I&#39;ll be happy to make them for your agents, too. I&#39;ll just need the following:<br><br><b>Front</b><br><br>- Agent name<br>- Species &amp; home continuum<br>- RC number<br>- An image at least 100x130, preferably a mugshot. I really, really, especially need this from you.<br><br>- Age (if in doubt, use years of existence, even if this does not equate to their biological or mental age)<br>- Height (in feet and inches)<br>- Eye color<br><br>- Sex<br>- Build<br>- Hair color (or fur color/other identifying feature for non-humans)<br><br>- Department<br>- Division (if applicable)<br>- HoD<br><br><b>Back</b><br><br>- Psych Eval number as generated <a href="https://www.random.org/bytes/">here</a>. Make sure to select 8 bytes, hexadecimal.<br><br>- Blood Type (if non-human, I&#39;ll use X for Xenos)<br>- Organ Donor (Yes/No)<br>- Partner(s)<br>- LO(s) (If your agent has a lot of LOs, please only give the top three. There&#39;s only so much space to work with.)<br><br>- Special Status (if any), such as a special license, restriction, watch status, etc.<br><br>- (Optional) Your choice of font for your agent&#39;s signature. I&#39;ll be happy to download and use anything from DaFont.com, if you want something custom. I recommend looking in the <a href="http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=603&amp;sort=alpha">Script &gt; Handwritten</a> section.<br><br>I&#39;ll also generate a custom QR code with their name and department abbreviation <a href="https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/">here</a>. This adds a fun interactive element to the card, since the QR code can actually be read back out by submitting the image URL <a href="https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx">here</a>. Really—give it a try! And thank hS for suggesting this bit of niftiness. <sup>_<sup><br><br>So,</sup></sup> anyone interested?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It was originally a massive crossover, but at some point I and the other writers started removing canon characters and stuff (the main characters, both good and evil, were all OCs so the story could very well work as an original. In fact, it probably woul&#39;dve been much better as one)... however, we lost interest in writing it before the &quot;transition&quot; from crossover-with-OCs to original was fully done.<br><br>So the only way I came up with identifying it was the CIC I made up for plot reasons in Blank Sprite.<br><br>If you prefer, you can use the story&#39;s name - Mai Dire Fine - but can you make it look like it has been heavily scratched? Agent!Sergio isn&#39;t quite proud  about being from there, and would&#39;ve surely have &quot;accidentally&quot; damaged the ID card just there...</p>

            <p>Hello!  I&#39;m Quihi, a newbie to the PPC.  I actually discovered the PPC about 2 years ago and posted once or twice on the board as Quiet Hiker before discovering I was really too busy to ever visit the Board.  Now I&#39;ve been looking at the wiki and the Board regularly for about a month, and I&#39;m hoping to actually stick around this time.  I&#39;m not sure how often I&#39;ll actually be able to post, but I feel awkward just stalking the PPC.<br><br>My favorite fandoms are pretty basic: Lord of the Rings, some Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, and Percy Jackson along with some smaller ones like The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Secret Series.<br><br>I have indeed read the Constitution and some of the FAQs, and the Original Series (and saved that to to my iPod so I can reread it again, for that matter).<br><br>I can&#39;t think if I&#39;m missing anything, so hello!</p>

On Cloyster, it works quite well, because you can switch into one and get a free boost before you Shell Smash and sweep 4 daze. =]</p>

            <p>PPC always needs more sentient pieces of tech, they can be so funny and crazy. You&#39;re a genius, creating all these characters, all of them being unique in their own twisted way.

            <p>Let&#39;s try something that combines the PPC and sharing music at the same time!<br><br>Here&#39;s how it goes.<br><br>Share one (or a few) songs. Ideally with a link to Youtube or something.<br>Someone (not you) replies with who (or what) they think that song should be uses for, PPC wise. Then they offer a couple songs as well for others to pin on.<br>However! Several people can reply about the same song!<br><br>For instance, say someone who is most definitely not a July links <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKOlBZJ7Izs">The Phoenix</a> by Fall Out Boy.<br><br>July comes along and says &quot;I think this should be used for Dafydd.&quot; Perhaps a July cites a lyric as evidence!<br><br>Another person, who is not July in a most excellent hat comes along and says, about the same song &quot;How about the Aviator, too.&quot; This person who is still definitely not July also cites a lyric! <br><br>Both of them offer songs in return, and other people come along and do the same thing.<br><br>There&#39;s only one rule, though! You <i>cannot</i> give your own characters for a song! <br><br>Makes sense?<br><br>Anyways, to start off with, here are a couple songs:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKOlBZJ7Izs">The Phoenix</a> by Fall Out Boy, because I already had the html there.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvEqMBEF1rc"> The Pretender</a> by Foo Fighters. <br><br>And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d7EbtLb8ok">How Far We&#39;ve Come</a> by Matchbox 20.  <br><br><br></p>

            <p>&quot;Almost Human&quot; - This sounds like Diablos to me!  He&#39;s barely on the Wiki; I&#39;ll have to fix that.  But anyway, Diablos is an AU version of the DIA&#39;s Irvine who wound up in the PPC one day.  He tried to insert himself into the lives of our Irvine and his acquaintances, but his origins* and rather villainous demeanor set everyone off their ease.  He eventually became a danger to the group, all while acting like he was the victimized one.  Hence:<br><br><i>What did I ever do to you<br>That you should treat me this way?<br>Is it really such a crime <br>For an angel to speak his mind?<br>. . .<br>What did I ever do so wrong<br>That you should cast me from grace<br>Though I love to rule in Hell here<br>How I miss the taste of Heaven</i><br><br>And of course, the repetition of &quot;I&#39;m just like you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mr. Pinstripe Suit&quot; - I&#39;m guessing this is the obvious one you were alluding to.  This is the Mysterious Somebody: Voodoo = the Force, and the way Mr. Pinstripe Suit strolling into town all swag-ly matches the MS&#39;s rise to power in HQ.  Plus, the MS was keeping all kinds of secrets from the PPC—he&#39;s &quot;got the answers we all wanna know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Red Like Roses Part II&quot; - Ugh, first I need to go listen to Part I.  *Is reminded he&#39;s multiple seasons behind in <i>Red Vs. Blue</i>*<br><br>Anyway.  Since these seem to be canon characters singing to each other, it&#39;s a little tricky assigning the lyrics a PPC meaning.  It&#39;s mostly calling to mind the relationship between the Reader and the Aviator, from what I&#39;ve read about it.  Haven&#39;t been keeping up with modern PPC stuff while I work on the archive, so my info may be off.<br><br>&quot;Halfman&#39;s Song&quot; - I <i>would</i> say this was a bit of an anthem for Mary Sues, but I think it&#39;s just a little too self-aware of the narrator&#39;s faults.  (<i>There are some who are born distinguished/There are some who are raised in praise/But me I was always the last in line</i>)  It&#39;s definitely got the themes of envy for canon and manipulative tactics down, though.<br><br><i>Beware, beware of the words I twist<br>I am small but my reach is long<br>. . .<br>The land is a blooming orchard<br>With fruits so juicy and ripe<br>With a clink of a coin loose the lion’s loin<br>. . .<br>Molding puppets from their minds of clay<br><br>I’m no man of honor<br>Myself is my true king</i><br><br>&quot;La Bo—seriously?  You&#39;re just being mean, now.  This is literally a song about dancing.  Oh, wait, no.  This is &quot;Bomba,&quot; not &quot;Bamba.&quot;  Huh.<br><br>Haven&#39;t kept up on my Spanish, but this first stanza is mostly familiar.  A drink that changes your life, something drives you madly delighted . . . &quot;smile water?&quot;  Blah blah blah, it&#39;s Bleepka, obviously.<br><br>BLEEEEEEPKAAAAAA<br><br>—doctorlit tiene una poca de gracia por йl y por ti.<br><br>*Considering our Irvine is a copy of the <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i> canon, and Diablos is literally just an evil version of him/them, do you suppose he hails from the Mirror Multiverse?  If he&#39;s a copy of an evil Irvine Kinneas, aka an FFVIII where Squall&#39;s group are the antagonists, that seems to match what we know of <i>Master Who</i>, where the Daleks were protagonists.</p>

            <p>I personally feel like The Pheonix (love FOB by the way, ahhh) is pretty indicative of the PPC as a whole; it&#39;s super pumped-up-y, perfect Sue Slayage Jams. . .the lyrics translate to the PPC really well, too. For example,  &quot;we can take the world back from a heart attack&quot; thing really hits a chord with me regarding the whole saving the word world thing. :P<br><br>My own music recs:<br><br><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=clZelkHSdug">Broken Bells&#39; new single &quot;It&#39;s That Talk Again&quot;</a> <br>Choice lyrics: &quot;Another chance for me to learn<br>Another bridge will have to burn<br>It&#39;s not about an eye for an eye<br>Because the normal rules, they don&#39;t apply&quot;<br><br>And in the same vein, one of my favorite Danger Mouse songs (he&#39;s half of the Broken Bells duo) <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lF_C7BvAf_A">&quot;Two Against One&quot;</a><br>Choice lyrics: &quot;Make no mistake I don&#39;t do anything for free and<br>I keep my enemies closer than my mirror ever gets to me&quot;<br>&quot;And if your foot soldiers, syncophants and yes man<br>For them to break into the middle of this little plan<br>Then they should plan to hear me say that I wont play around<br>But wait anyway I planned a plan to drown them&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;It&#39;s That Talk Again&quot; - To my mind, this calls up chronic FicPsych patients (Jeanine Guiles, Chelsea Miller, etc.)  The early lines are the psychiatrist trying to nurse the agent&#39;s mental health back, with the agent resisting:<br><br><i>I never meant for this to last<br>We turn around, a year has passed<br>And now you&#39;ve got these thoughts in your head<br>You never heard a word I said<br>It&#39;s that talk again</i><br><br>The chorus is the patient fighting treatment, afraid to face whatever sent them there:<br><br><i>When all I have to say<br>Would fill your heart with pain<br>So let&#39;s just walk away</i><br><br>The last verse is the former partner visiting with their friends/current partner, being supportive of the patient&#39;s recovery.<br><br><i>I see you in the crowd with your friends again<br>...<br>It never really ends<br>I might have a girl on my arm again<br>Then you&#39;ll want to weave and pretend we never met<br>But don&#39;t do it, don&#39;t do it<br>It&#39;s that talk again</i><br><br><br>&quot;Two Against One&quot; - A lot of the lines here remind me of the &quot;clashing mindsets&quot; dynamic the Flowers like to use in partnering people.<br><br><i>I keep my enemies closer than my mirror ever gets to me<br>And if you think that there is shelter in this attitude<br>Wait til you feel the warmth of my gratitude</i><br><br>—doctorlit means to sign his posts from now on, but keeps forgetting.</p>

            <p>Have a snippet thing. :)<br><br>***<br><br>Zeb yawned and opened his eyes to be met with a world of whiteness. After a bit of flailing, he managed to extract himself from under his sheet, and he sat up, yawning again. The smell of something delicious hit his nose and his eyes snapped open to see the Aviator standing by his bed, holding a giant platter of freshly-baked Sweet Poffins. The top three each had an unlit candle stuck in them.<br><br>“Happy birthday, Zeb,” the Aviator said, smiling softly.<br><br>“Huh?” he said blankly.<br><br>“September 26th, right?” The Aviator held out the platter. “Thought I’d do something to celebrate; it&#39;s not every day you turn three. I hope this is alright.”<br><br>Zeb blinked several times. “Oh yeah, it’s my birthday!” A huge grin spread across his face and he jumped out of bed, bounding over to the Aviator and almost knocking her over in his attempt to hug her. She yelped, but somehow managed to keep the Poffins from falling to the floor.<br><br>“Careful!” she said, holding the platter out of the way while bending down to return his hug. “But yeah. I thought you’d like the surprise.” She paused and looked down at the Poffins. “Um, you still like Sweet Poffins, right?”<br><br>“Still my favorite,” Zeb said, grinning broadly (and showing off an impressive set of fangs in the process). “Thank you so much!”<br><br>“You’re welcome.” The Aviator headed over to the coffee table and set the platter down before sitting on the sofa. Zeb jumped up into the spot next to her while she fished a cigarette lighter from her pockets. With the candles lit, she began to sing.<br><br>Zeb waited until she was finished before leaning forward and blowing them out. He looked up at her. “You want to share?”<br><br>The Aviator hesitated. “Are you sure? I made them just for you.”<br><br>“I’m sure.” Zeb used his teeth to delicately pluck one of the candles out of a Poffin before grabbing the pastry in his mouth. “Go on,” he said around the food in his mouth. He nudged her shoulder. <br><br>The Aviator shrugged and picked up one of the Poffins and bit into it. “Later, we could go to Rudi’s if you like,” she suggested. “Drinks or whatever you want will be on me.”<br><br>Zeb swallowed and grinned. “That would be awesome.”</p>

            <p>After a hard day of scrying the various badfic worlds (with a break for tea at four; one had to have <i>some</i> standards), he was content to kick back, relax, and engage another wonder of the modern world. His favourite chair was still his favourite chair, the enormous red leather wingback still tinged with Generic Fabric courtesy of its previous home in his billiard room, but the clanking Suetech steam-powered La-Z-Boy was a close second. For one thing, its mildly ferocious riser-recliner action could, with diligent preparation and the application of trigonometry, catapult a smallish coconut or similar object the entire length of the corridor, though he&#39;d had to stop his experiments into optimal flight paths when that poor Time Lord woman with the irascible demeanour had been taken amidships with a ballistic grapefruit.<br><br>He cast his gaze at the perpetual calendar on the wall, filled with postcards and wishes of good luck from the garrison of his partner&#39;s old base under Cheyenne Mountain (what was left of it, anyway), taking a slurp of his tea, then stared at the date while making a noise like a poorly-maintained tugboat engine.<br><br>&quot;Drowning again, are we, your Lordship?&quot; Lola McCandless&#39; mild tone belied the enormous grin she was wearing.<br><br>&quot;N-no!&quot; Algie replied after some effort. &quot;It&#39;s the twenty-sixth!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, cob. All day - wait. Didn&#39;t you say you had something on?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed I do! Oh, d*mn it all, Commander, I was so wrapped up in my work it completely escaped my memory. We must make haste to RC 3-Apple-14 immediately!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Algie,&quot; she said, worry creeping into her voice at the edges as the Earl bustled about and laboured with a large blue-and-grey box, &quot;if the next words out of your mouth are &#39;I recommend we travel by chair&#39;, I will be very-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I recommend we travel by chair!&quot;<br><br>&quot;-unsurprised. Totally unsurprised. God, you&#39;re like a kid with a new toy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This will make a very interesting test, though! We should be concentrating so much on <i>screaming</i> that we arrive at our destination in moments!&quot; Algie cranked a few brass levers on the back of the chair and prodded its firebox with a letter opener. &quot;It&#39;s glowing blue. Should it be? Can we get it to do it again? Oh, what fun! Would you please be so good as to help me manoeuvre this contraption into the corridor?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re insane,&quot; Lola said as she grappled with the La-Z-Boy.<br><br>&quot;I cannot help but notice, Commander,&quot; Algie replied with a glint in his eye, &quot;that you are still helping me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, that&#39;s because I&#39;m insane too. Used to fight space invaders for a living, cob, and before that I used to - well, never you mind about that.&quot;<br><br>After a few minutes of shoving and the Earl fussing with a protractor, he pronounced them ready for takeoff and started feeding yet more coal into the chair, which began vibrating in odd ways. Lola sat down and made herself as comfortable as she could, wishing she&#39;d thought to requisition her armour.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m going to switch it to full power!&quot; Algie shouted over the rattletrap clatter of Suvian gears as he took a seat beside the Commander. &quot;Never done that before! Exciting, wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are you sure this will work?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not even remotely!&quot;<br><br><i>Well,</i> thought Lola as the riser-recliner creaked into position, <i>I have technically heard worse last words.</i><br><br>But before she could respond, there was a terrible, ghastly-<br><br><small>creeeeeeak<br><br>&quot;... Huh. Was that i-&quot;<br><br>KA-CHOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOINNNNNNNG!<br><br>Over the next few seconds, which Lola was convinced were going to be her final few seconds, she still clung onto the large birthday present. As they landed, though, she had to let go before hurtling face first into the door of an RC.<br><br>Only a moment later, she got up, with the help of her three partners. &quot;Ow,&quot; she said, eloquently.<br><br>&quot;Commander, are you quite well?&quot; The various Algies coalesced into a single, worried-looking form. &quot;I failed to calculate for our differences in weight -- arcs of trajectory and so on -- and arrived in time to hear the most appalling crash.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ow,&quot; she repeated, shaking the stars out of her vision. &quot;The, the thing-&quot;<br><br>&quot;The package is secure, as I believe the modern expression has it. Come now, lie still.&quot; Algie grabbed a couple of small splinters of Generic Surface from the Commander&#39;s crater, picked one, took a small stick from his pocket, tied them together with a single hair from Lola&#39;s head (eliciting another brief &quot;Ow&quot; when she remembered to notice), and began to chant, placing the makeshift cross upon her brow. Almost immediately, the wounds began to close, and when Algie completed the spell and keeled over backwards, she was there to catch him.<br><br>&quot;You know how to take a lady to a party, you know?&quot; She was smiling when she said it, but then Lola smiled a lot in general.<br><br>&quot;I think... I think a chartered ship for the Grand Tour next year, don&#39;t you?&quot; Algie struggled to his feet and dusted himself off. &quot;Now then, we await only friend Zeb and dear Miss Aviator. I believe you knocked already.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Har har. You&#39;re so smart, how do we get back?&quot;<br><br>Algie&#39;s expression trickled from satisfaction to horror. The door took the opportunity to open, and the two spun to face it, looked at each other, and said &quot;Happy birthday!&quot; in perfect unison.<br><br>They were just kind of like that.</small></p>

            <p>It was actually the Summy Company then Warner/Chappell (Part of the Warner Brother&#39;s Conglomerate) claimed that had the copyright, not Disney.

But it is very important to note that this was only at the District Court level.  Warner/Chappell has at least one appeal of right and possibly more (rehearing en banc and SCOTUS).  Importantly it is very likely that Warner/Chappell appeals and there is a non-zero chance the decision will be overruled, thus validating the copyright.  </p>

            <p>Okay, so on a happier note, as far as I know our local version is not copyrighted, so allow me to share it with you to cheer things up, since I was the one who introduced this topic anyway. <br><br> Here is our Happy Birthday song:<br><br>Portuguese English<br><br>Parabйns pra vocк = Congratulations to you<br><br>Nesta data querida= On this dear date<br><br>Muita felicidade =Much happiness<br><br>Muitos anos de vida =Many years of life<br><br>At the end of the song, there are variations to add joy and excitement to the celebration. For example, let’s say that it is Mariana’s birthday. At the end of the birthday song, the group will sing:<br><br>Й pique, й pique Й pique, й pique, й pique Й hora, й hora Й hora, й hora, й hora Rб Tim Bum Mariana, Mariana, Mariana<br><br>Let’s see if I can explain what this means:<br><br>Pique = enthusiasm, peak momentum<br><br>Й hora = it is time<br><br>Rб Tim Bum = a play with the sound of drums playing<br><br>(Translation and explanation copied from <a href="http://streetsmartbrazil.com/birthday-vocabulary-and-brazilian-birthday-song-video/%20/">this helpful Portuguese as a second language blog.</a>)</p>

            <p>…be written logically?<br><br>My main problem is how one would explain the Doctor ending up in a time-stream where he&#39;s so popular. All I can come up with is a parallel universe, which are impossible to travel between, except via TARDIS <i>once</i>, and then there&#39;s those time-warping medallions, which the Doctor doesn&#39;t like because of what they do to the fabric of space. Also because as the show keeps doing more episodes in the present, the show does not have a fandom in-universe there either.<br><br>So… Any other ideas? Because it&#39;s not something you can handwave. The audience, not to mention the Doctor, will certainly want to know how he got to such a place in time.<br><br>Or is it impossible?</p>

            <p>Remember the Doctor&#39;s words in <i>Rise of the Cybermen</i>: &quot;It used to be easy. When the Time Lords kept their eye on everything, you could hop between realities, home in time for tea. Then they died, and took it all with them. The walls of reality closed, the worlds were sealed. Everything became that bit less kind.&quot;<br><br>If travel between universes is getting easier again, it could be a sign that Gallifrey is returning.<br><br>(A variation on this would be a pre-Time War Doctor travelling to our reality, and meeting a NuWho fangirl who refuses to believe this idiot in a long scarf is really the Doctor until she sees Sarah Jane with him.)<br><br>Or...<br><br>Perhaps the TARDIS has been sent to this universe by someone who doesn&#39;t care what this does to the fabric of space.<br><br>Missy and/or Davros (depending on which, if either, is alive at the end of tonight&#39;s episode) sets a trap for the Doctor.  Detecting the approach of the TARDIS, and unable to destroy it, they open a wormhole in its path, sending it to our reality.  Then they close the wormhole behind, trapping it and the Doctor here.<br><br>(You could begin by showing this, then pulling back to reveal that it&#39;s the cliffhanger ending of an episode the fangirl protagonist is watching.)<br></p>

            <p>Which, FYI, in such matters? It&#39;s the back end of nowhere (and no, no Netflix here).

            <p>Very few reviewers ever bat an eye about the issues I&#39;ve raised about a certain HP badfic that I have discussed at lenght in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=282122;search_term=question+about+charges">this thread of mine</a>. <br><br>Even worse is the sister fic of the one above, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5598955/1/Positive">called Positive</a>, which basically is a rehash of Breaking Dawn in the Potterverse, only somehow it is probably worse. No one bats an eye when the Suethor just declares that the Weasleys simply don&#39;t exist in the story, for no apparent reason, or when Dumbledore threatens to force Hermione to either  have an abortion or completely isolate herself until she has her child, only to give up said child to Muggles &quot;for the Greater Good&quot; (The child in question is the Sue herself, but still...) No one bats a Glaurunging eye when Harry can suddenly speak telepathically with his unborn daughter or when said baby reaches just about every single important developmental milestone impossibly early.</p>

And it squandered genuine promise. What could and should have been a frank discussion of mental health and its stigmas in two very different cultures turned into stupid, rambling garbage involving ninjas, gun-toting doctors, vile bashing, and DRACULA for some damned reason or another. Oh, and Harry is even more The Special than normal because of some genuinely insane segments involving Merlin&#39;s tutor and his dog.

            <p>...one of the questions asks for a preference of various activities, with one of the answers indicating a love for books and reading (which counts as a point for Ravenclaw). Considering that the source material is a book series and that fans of said books will be taking the Pottermore quiz, chances are the grand majority of them will like books and thus give that answer. Because of this, Ravenclaw is by nature of the quiz going to have an advantage. (This is just me spitballing, though - feel free to tell me I&#39;m wrong! <sup>_<sup>)</sup></sup></p>

            <p>Merlin was in Slytherin, but most Ravenclaws are going to put the book of merlin as the first item they would save because, well, it&#39;s Merlin, duh! Also, you are more likely to get Slytherin if you choose the river in the forest vs river question. This is most likely because Slytherin&#39;s common room is under the lake. The point is, most Slytherin-like answers are the ones a Ravenclaw would naturally choose.</p>

The Gryffindors all stayed, of course: but she says that their bravery is, in some sense, fool-hardy and show-offish. Most of the Ravenclaws leave, interested in their own skins, and a few stay. The Slytherins, of course, all leave. But Hufflepuff.  Hufflepuff stays almost to a man, and for all the right reasons. They&#39;re fighting for their school, for their families, for their friends. They&#39;re fighting for loyalty. That&#39;s the opposite of boring and run of the mill.<br><br>Hufflepuffs are awesome, and I shan&#39;t let you forget it. =]<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never been overly-impressed with the Sorting Hat quizzes, if only because I think they place too much emphasis on &#39;liking to read&#39; as a Ravenclaw trait. *coughs and looks at Hermione* <br><br>I think I&#39;m actually a Gryffindor, but only because I don&#39;t really fit any of the other Houses. I&#39;m not particularly drawn to schoolwork or learning (don&#39;t get me wrong, I like learning new things, but I don&#39;t go &#39;hmm, what should I learn about today?&#39;), I&#39;m not patient and I&#39;m definitely not hardworking, and I&#39;m very much not cunning or ambitious.

            <p>I questioned the legitimacy of that Sorting at first. I spent most of the quiz trying to figure out how the quiz worked. That seemed a bit cheaty to me at the time, but upon completion and further consideration, it only serves to support the Sorting. Learning is most prized by the Ravenclaws after all.<br><br>In Pottermore proper I was sorted into Gryffindor. It is rather interesting to see how that decision changes over time.</p>

            <p>I suppose it&#39;s only inevitable that I am entrusted to a House that is the sole preserve of those children in the school&#39;s care who are evil. Of course, this is not the true nature of ambition, cunning, and manipulation. It is merely what that House descended into via a spiral of radicalization and militant fascism, which is the <i>best</i> way to raise a child.<br><br>A Slytherin ought not to be the villain. A Slytherin worthy of the name is not even in the story. Whether the hero or the villain of that story triumphs, the Slytherin uses that triumph to further their own goals. A Slytherin does not even necessarily rule. To be the one in charge is to attract attention that may not, in fact, be desired. The true Slytherin tempers ambition with carefulness, calculation, and a meritocratic attitude. To the true Slytherin, the idea of a blood-based hierarchy is there only to be used for personal advantage. Since young Slytherins rely on the patronage of older, more experienced players of the game, however, it is necessary for the true Slytherin to show gratitude, magnanimity, and generosity of spirit to those less fortunate than themselves - unless they are a threat, of course. The key colour of Slytherin is not the green of poisons, potions, and curses, but the muted silver - the silver of our tongues, the colour that fades into the background. Let the products of other houses bicker and squabble amongst themselves, jockeying for position loudly and proclaiming victories with fanfare and bluster. These triumphs are temporary. For the master Slytherin, all triumphs are one&#39;s own, and in this, our victory is inevitable and eternal.</p>

            <p>This month, Thursday is the only day I don&#39;t have a day shift; only a night shift at 5:30.  (No, I haven&#39;t had a full day off all month.  We&#39;re understaffed, okay?)  I&#39;m going to spend the day keeping a friend company, so I&#39;ve been getting ready to go since I woke up.  I just made dinner for my night shift (cheese melted between two tortillas), and once that cools, I&#39;ll pack it in my lunch box.  I&#39;m about to shave.

            <p>For one thing, most Agents will decide on their own who to recruit or kill. Agents generally don&#39;t get a &#39;kill this absolutely dead&#39; order, and there&#39;s a lot of expectation to use your best judgement on a mission. So an Agent who killed a fic without sufficient charges just because it had gotten sent to them would be something of an outlier!<br><br>In addition, I think a lot of the rules don&#39;t apply to both goodfic and badfic. Like, badfic warps the Word World while goodfic makes its own copy-world to play in. Also, I&#39;m not sure that the protection-from-view thing would work in a goodfic? The World messes with the canon characters to make them not notice Agents in order to protect the Agents so they can get the invading Sue out, and that wouldn&#39;t happen in goodfic. <br><br>Disciplinary actions... Probably some visits to FicPsych to see why they wanted to do that? If they&#39;ve just snapped, then, well, such things happen, and help can be given. If they were infiltrators the entire time then things get more complex.</p>

However, I have come to realize that I need some serious practice telling people my opinions without making it a &quot;right vs wrong, good vs evil&quot; sort of deal, which should never happen in a discussion thread. Especially among people I consider to be friends.<br><br>In short, if I have said something mean to anyone here on the Board, please post it in a reply to this thread, and I&#39;ll apologize to each of you individually sometime in the near future (because I&#39;m getting loopy from my cold medicine right now). <br><br>So, does anybody want to get this started?</p>

            <p>Okay, so obviously, I&#39;m a socialist, <s>hermaphrodite</s> intersex, genderfluid, bisexual, polyamorous heathen, and I don&#39;t know you very well, so I&#39;m probably not one of the friends you&#39;re concerned about offending (that&#39;s okay!). I was not happy with your insults of Huinesoron, and other learned Christians who disagreed with you, but … well, I&#39;m glad this went down when it did. Like, incredibly grateful, for all the wrong reasons. <br><br>My dear friend, a priest in the Episcopal Church, very gay and the first person I&#39;d ever heard extend a literally universal welcome to the Communion altar, died yesterday morning. He was going into the hospital with pneumonia and an as-yet undetermined lung disease when all this nonsense got started, and since I frankly don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s latter-most tail-piece what people think of my sexuality or religion, debating you and others was a relatively relaxing, nonchalant distraction from being scared and worried for him, and caring for his dog. <br><br>So, in an indirect fashion, thank you for being kind of a jerk about issues we disagree on. I don&#39;t think you owe me any kind of apology. You just worry about finding a center of some kind, spiritually, so you don&#39;t get so angry. That&#39;s what Vern would have said. (You should still probably apologize to the people who you did hurt, though.)</p>

            <p>Kidding! Well . . .  mostly. I had meant to explain this, because I think there&#39;s a fundamental disconnect missing, and as someone raised in a background very similar to yours, I, perhaps arrogantly, think I might be able to clear it up.<br><br>But first - don&#39;t worry about that part, it doesn&#39;t matter all that much.<br><br>Second - thank you.<br><br>Last: his sermons focused on two things more than anything: the all-importance, over and above everything, of love. And the way one must meditate and pray without ceasing on the Bible, especially Jesus&#39; parables, in order to allow them to touch your spirit - because they must be taken as literature, poetry, and that requires thought. (He was a professor of Russian literature for many years, and it never quite left him.)<br><br>So, on the disconnect! I think the issue many people have with your position (I&#39;m going to leave out the tone issues now, they&#39;re irrelevant to a discussion of rhetoric) can be broken down into the three categories of response. This is more or less applicable to every issue discussed (<i>maybe</i> except Israel).<br><br>The first, I think you are probably <i>very</i> accustomed to. It goes something like this: <br><br><b>Amen, brother! Love the sinner, hate the sin. It&#39;s sad, but if they&#39;d only come back to God we&#39;d welcome them. I pray for their souls every day.</b><br><br>You&#39;re on the same page, you may disagree about particulars, but more or less you agree.<br><br>The second, goes more like this:<br><br><b>Well, your position may have some internal logic if you are [insert sect here], but your Holy Book/Sacred Scriptures mean nothing to me, I don&#39;t believe in your Messiah/Deity, and so I wish you&#39;d stop talking about the Bible/Apostles and use a form of reason that&#39;s applicable to both of us for your arguments.</b><br><br>This person disagrees entirely with something you believe to be not only true, but <i>the foundation of reality</i>, given to us by the Creator of aforesaid reality Himself. That&#39;s obviously very, very difficult to wrap your head around. You&#39;re more or less trying to argue about the nature of something neither of you has seen - one has touched, and the other heard. You <i>cannot</i> have rational discourse unless you both have the same frame of reference. You mentioned, at one point, that all of <s>Western civilization</s>* American culture has been heavily influenced by Christian thought. You are absolutely correct about this! Very, very correct. And I&#39;m glad you know this, since many atheists often argue traditionally conservative Christian positions with no good reason whatsoever, save their cultural bias, which they are maddeningly blind to - but I digress. The point is, just because American culture is steeped in conservative Protestant values, does NOT mean that everyone agrees with conservative Christianity. They&#39;re still missing the agreement with you, that everything in the Bible is true. This, you have to understand, is a position not held by the majority of Christians, let alone the majority of Americans or Europeans. <br><br>So you literally cannot make an argument they&#39;ll agree with without converting them to your specific worldview, which is unlikely. You really need to either go a different route, arguing by some other principle, or let the matter drop. I recall you tried this with the &quot;gay gene&quot; studies, but I think you&#39;d read them, or had them read to you, with a predisposition to see the article as a negative, and there was no textual support for that, so it failed. But that was the closest I saw you come to a frame of reference both people can understand. Similar efforts usually go &quot;but humans are made for reproduction, and gay couples can&#39;t reproduce,&quot; which implies that love = reproduction, i.e. sterile, elderly, etc. people cannot love - but you understand, it relies on something other than quotes from Scripture. I really hope this is making sense.<br><br>The third position is, essentially, this:<br><br><b>Yes, I&#39;m familiar with that passage/book/chapter/verse, but I disagree with your interpretation of it.</b><br><br>This is the one that seemed to confuse you the most. I understand why. Your entire life, if I guess correctly, you have been taught that the Bible says this specific thing, and the passages&#39; contexts support it, and to you it is so <i>obvious</i> that you don&#39;t understand how someone can read the Bible, and not see the same thing in it that you see, and that your pastor sees, and that your family sees, and that your professors and classmates see. What you have to understand is that everyone you&#39;re talking to does <i>not</i> see it that way. Everyone experiences things they read differently, and that&#39;s no less true of the Bible than any other written word. These stories are thousands of years old, from a world that bears almost no resemblance to the one in which we live. That&#39;s their context. Then they were collected into one volume or another by different people. Argued over. After Christ, and then after the Apostles, people argued over who to include, which of their letters mattered enough, etc. <br><br>If you believe those arguing over who to include were divinely inspired in their final choice, that&#39;s okay. But don&#39;t be naive about your decision to do so - always bear in mind, and you can <i>tell</i> by reading Paul - that even the disciples, even the Apostles, disagreed with one another <s>constantly</s> from time to time. Anyway, the Council of Nicea was put together to make all the sects stop their interminable disagreeing over the nature of scripture. Then other councils after that decided what mattered enough to keep and what didn&#39;t. More and more, until King James, which for some reason is the version Baptists stuck with. But everyone who&#39;s read that book since it was written has had a different interpretation, and many, many of them are <i>absolutely certain</i> that theirs is the correct one.<br><br>To either of the people with the second or third responses, you saying &quot;But this is correct because the Bible, read <i>correctly</i>, says it!&quot; about gay marriage, abortion, etc., sounds exactly the same as someone saying &quot;But this is correct because the Bible, read <i>correctly</i>, says it!&quot; about interracial marriage, or whatever else. To you, there&#39;s a world of difference. But in order to communicate with others who disagree, you have to think very carefully about their perspective, and stop thinking in your own worldview. Otherwise, no one in the world outside of your college and church are going to ever make any sense to you.<br><br>Ugh. Obviously this got away from me. But it was bothering me, because you&#39;re obviously quite intelligent, and you seemed interminably frustrated - as did your opponents - by an inability to communicate. It&#39;s differences in worldview. That&#39;s pretty much all it is. You and an atheist from Scandinavia or an Anglican**-turned-CLDS from England aren&#39;t even going to be able to disagree properly unless you start taking into account the vastly different interpretations of the Bible, or the world including the Bible.<br><br><br><br>*You said Western Civ - I disagree, as the entirety of the European sphere of influence cannot be so generally categorized. But since American culture is so influential, and what you&#39;re coming from as are many, if not most, of the &#39;Board, I think the substitution works.<br>**I&#39;m assuming Anglican, I may be wrong</p>

            <p>Would it be OK to spork things from there?<br><br>For those of you not in the know, Fantendo is a Wikia specializing in fictional games that are <i>supposed</i> to expand on a Nintendo series, but usually just end up being not-very-good. It&#39;s all text-based, so it shouldn&#39;t be very hard. If this is allowed, would sporkings from other fanon sites be allowed as well? Because I believe I found a Pikmin one at the age of 8. Or something.</p>

            <p>Hi. I&#39;m a friend of Matt. I was invited through DeviantArt. I have read two stories so far, those he sent me. I think this sounds like a very good idea?<br><br>I was told to introduce myself on this messaging board, but I do not really know what to say. <br>My name is Marie. I am from New Brunswick, Canada. I used to run a blog with my twin brother critiquing Percy Jackson OCs, but it got too much to handle, and real life issues got in the way.<br><br>I like to draw, but I have not in a while. I like to read. I would like to try writing at some point MAYBE. My English vocabulary has been out of practice though. My favourite colour is blue... Um, is this enough?<br><br>I was told this board updates on a daily basis and I cannot do that, but I will try to check in as often as I can.</p>

            <p>No joke, I have met Presidential Candidate Ben Carson. He was scheduled for a speaking event here at my College, and I got to meet him. It was awesome.<br><br>Say what you will about the man, but as a Political Science student, this was an amazing opportunity for me. And there are certain issues I disagree with him on, but he is a very approachable man. He seems to be reasonably humble, and his life story embodies the American dream. <br><br>Not saying whether or not I&#39;ll vote for the guy. In fact, the only reason I am mentioning this is because I wanted to provide an explanation for why my return was delayed. In upcoming days, in fact, I have a lot of homework and assignments to take care of. So I may be down for the next few days as well.<br><br>Does anyone else have any unique experiences to report from the previous week? Please share.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll issue an apology, if everyone tries to understand what I was trying to say, and admittedly, doing a horrible, horrible job at saying it.<br><br>To be clear, I was not saying that I hate gay people, nor do I consider them to be subhuman, or second-class, or anything like that. As a matter of fact, the Bible specifically says that we are supposed to be kind to everyone, regardless of who they are, or what they believe, or what they have done, or anything. <br><br>I will admit that I put out what sounded like the exact opposite, and to that, I will apologize, contingent on everyone understanding what I was TRYING to say.<br><br>What I was trying to say is that there are a select minority in the gay community that are, for political reasons, trying to impose gay marriage on people who have religious objections to it. These individuals give homosexuals a bad name, and they cause a lot of grief for people like me, who are, I would like to point out, perfectly within the law to deny service based on our religious beliefs. Now, any actual, real, genuine Christian will understand that this doesn&#39;t mean that we should be (insert expletive here) to them. In fact, it&#39;s actually a good business move to point these people in the direction of other businesses who will work for them. Anybody who doesn&#39;t do that, and instead grabs the torches and pitchforks, ought to be locked away for trying to deprive citizens of America of their lives, or limb, or whatever. <br><br>I am not an advocate of hatred in any way, merely one of many millions of conscientious objectors to the interpretation of a certain law. <br><br>That some people would try (and appear to be succeeding at) turn people against us is an unaddressed part of this travesty of the gay marriage debate. (Why can&#39;t it be just that anymore? A debate. If things can go back to the point when we could discuss things like gay marriage like mature human beings and not blast each other for being politically incorrect or for being Christians, that would make many people happier, I think. We can be free to disagree and discuss these things like adults, and come to some compromise, like we&#39;re supposed to.) <br><br>If nothing else, I think we can all agree on two things. First of all, people ought to be free to live their lives however they see fit. People should be able to make their own decisions, like whether to be part of a gay marriage or a straight marriage, or not. Secondly, I think we can all agree that it is not right to try and force people to do something that they, by Constitutional right, they should have to be allowed to decide whether or not they want to participate in something. For example, it has been said that America is a Judeo-Christian nation, but the most appealing part of the United States is that nobody is forcing the citizens to be Jewish or Christian. Likewise, you&#39;re allowed to practice whatever religion you want to, and everything that entails. <br><br>If we can all agree on these two points, then I will issue an official apology to then entire Board. <br><br>Deal? </p>

            <p>That sort of thing tends to happens when someone joins and they turn to be a member of a fandom that doesn&#39;t have that much a presence here on the Board. When I joined, I was the fourth Nanoha fan and also as previously noted, probably the second CCS one. I can&#39;t imagine how much excited I could possibly get if someday a Boarder joins and they turn out to be a Kana Little Sister fan too, for example. <br><br>I saw the Portuguese dubbed version quite a long time ago, back when I was in elementary school. A few years ago I watched the subbed version and the movies and read the manga. <br><br>Oh boy, Tsubasa... I won&#39;t get into spoilers here because I don&#39;t know how far you are into it, but by Clow, that series can really screw your mind when it wants to. Did you know that things got so confusing in there that even the writers have admited that they will need to go back and read it because even they are confused sometimes?</p>

            <p>I mean, Clamp wanted connect every single one of their worlds here, they used temporal loops if I understood this right,  so no wonder it&#39;s a complicated story. Don&#39;t worry about spoilers, I found the whole series in a public library.</p>

            <p>Complicated doesn&#39;t even begin to cover it. Oh, the temporal loops... that part got so complicated that Clamp sometimes broke the rules of their own time travel system.<br><br>This is the kind of stuff that the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey Wimey Ball trope</a> was made for.

Because if you aren&#39;t even past the first half yet, I would rather not spoil WHY it is so complicated.

Attack them now!&#39; I found this odd as well, so I watched the transformation scene many times. And what I noticed is, when the Pretty Cures yell &#39;Dual Aurora Wave!&#39; and transform, a rainbow-colored column of light shoots up from the ground, going BOOM! And then the Pretty Cures levitate, and go up into the air. Based on this, I believe the protagonists of Pretty Cure are being <b>held up in the air by the power of light.</b><br>&quot;When we think of light, we usually think it heats up things or lights up things. But in reality, light has the power to hold up things as well. When the sun is beating down on us in the summer, the human body is being pressed downwards by the sun beams with a force of <b>2/100,000g.</b> But this is only about a one-hundred of the weight of a mosquito, so no matter how hot it is, we don’t feel that sunlight is heavy.<br>&quot;So that means the light holding them up must be extremely strong. If we assume that the two Pretty Cures each weigh about 45kg and do some calculations... It means the light during the transformation must have the energy of <b>2,100,000,000kW per 1m2.</b> While the entirety of power that Japan is capable of generating is only 100,000,000kW. So they’re using <b>21 TIMES</b> the amount of energy the whole of Japan can generate.<br>&quot;So what would happen if a bad guy jumped in to try to sabotage their transformation? He would EVAPORATE INSTANTLY.<br><b>&quot;DEATH AWAITS ANYONE WHO DARES TO DISRUPT A PRETTY CURE TRANSFORMATION.&quot;</b></i><br><br><s>Am I the only one who thinks a Tuxedo-Mask-esque Falchion who doesn&#39;t actually do anything to contribute would be hilarious, btw?</s></p>

            <p>I don&#39;t remember much of the details, but I think instead of a charge list there was a Sailor Moon-style [snappy summary of what the Sue did] followed by &quot;In the name of canon, we shall exorcise you/kill you!&quot; or something, and there were purifying attacks instead of exorcisms. Also I think the Flowers were fairy princesses and CADs/Consoles/What-have-you were cutesy mascots.</p>

            <p>Specifically, the 2012 archive. <br><br>It looks like you wrote 2 chapters in the tale of the Magical Plot Protectors (the archive seems to have done something funny to the formatting, so I&#39;ve tried to correct it quickly).<br><br>First up:<br><br><i>Well, I&#39;ve always been a fan of the Magical Girl genre, so...<br><br>Magical Plot Protector Agents Anne and Emma~<br><br>Anne was sleeping in her and her partner&#39;s shared room at the Protector&#39;s Garden, an interdimensional fortress that served as the hub of the Organisation, run by the Flower Princesses. She rolled over and had just gotten comfortable when...<br>&quot;DI-IIIIIIIIIING!&quot; squeaked out the small, furry animal sitting on the desk.<br>Anne moaned and turned to face it, when it spoke in an annoyingly high-pitched voice. &quot;Protectors! There&#39;s a disturbance in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha! A Sue-wraith&#39;s possessed Momoko Takamachi and made her a magic-phobic abusive mother!&quot;<br>Emma frowned. &quot;Oh, for crying out loud. Anne, get out of bed,&quot; Anne growled and stood up. &quot;You really should be nicer to CAD. Without him, we wouldn&#39;t be able to find out where the Stus were, or teleport, or anything!&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, thanks for the exposition, Emms. I just wish that the Princesses had thought to make them a little less annoying. How&#39;d you even figure out it&#39;s name, anyways?&quot;<br>&quot;CAD--Canonical Assistance Doodad. Where&#39;re the transformation thingies?&quot; asked Emma. Anne grabbed a pair of small, black discs, each with a green cactus engraved on the front, and tossed one of them to Emma. The two girls said in unison, &quot;Magical Guardians, Canon Protection Powers, Set Up!&quot; In a flash of light, the two were dressed in black, frilly dresses. The black discs were now on chokers, and the two girls looked, well, like stereotypical Mahou Shoujo whose outfits had been dipped in black paint. The large gun and sword that Anne and Emma (respectively) were holding looked somewhat less stereotypical. Emma grinned. &quot;OK, CAD! Open the portal!&quot; <br>&quot;Why do you have to be so cheerful about this?&quot; muttered Anne.<br>CAD started to glow brightly, and within moments the glow had expanded into a bright-blue circle, with a slightly darker spot in the middle where the animal floated. Anne and Emma held their weapons carefully, and walked into the fic.</i><br><br>And secondly:<br><br><i>The two Magical Girls hid behind a couch while Emma recorded charges. &quot;OK, we&#39;re ready to go! CAD, set up the Wraith Extraction Spell!&quot; she chirped. <br>CAD nodded in assent, and opnede its mouth, reciting at high speed:<br>&quot;MynameisTakamachiNanohaIwassupposedtobeanordinarythirdgraderbutasmallincidenthappened--&quot; <br>As CAD recited the opening narration of the anime, glowing words began to flow out of his mouth. They quickly formed a net around the two canons, though Nanoha&#39;s was considerably more comfortable-looking than Momoko&#39;s bonds. <br>The two girls jumped up and yelled, &quot;Sue-wraith! For the crimes of cruelty against the English language, messing up the relationships between Canon Characters, and almost replacing Momoko Takamachi, in the name of the Protectors, we will exorcise you!&quot; <br>They struck poses in front the two canons. Momoko had just enough time to look confused before the canon recitation forced the Wraith out of her. &quot;i dont get it shouldnt I be mahou shoujo themed t--&quot; \*BANG!\* <br>Anne blew the smoke away from her gun. &quot;I don&#39;t get why they think that we&#39;ll let them monologue--we don&#39;t really care why they&#39;re doing this.&quot; Emma shrugged as Momoko and Nanoha woke up. <br>&quot;Ugh--what happened?&quot; asked Momoko.<br>Emma looked at CAD. &quot;Would you mind?&quot; The small animal nodded and floated over to the two canons. Its eyes glowed for a moment, before flashing brightly. <br>&quot;All done!&quot; it squeaked. <br>Anne sighed. &quot;Fi-nally. That took entirely too long. Just open the portal.&quot; CAD looked less than happy about her appreciation of it, but quickly opened the portal again. As they stepped back into their room, Emma turned back to the still-floating animal. <br>&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to come down?&quot; she asked. CAD seemed to give the impression of a smirk towards Anne, before squeaking:<br>&quot;DI-IIIIIIIIIIIIIING! Protectors! There&#39;s a disturbance in Puella Magi Madoka Magica! A Gary Stu is trying to set himself up as a love interest for Mami!&quot;<br>Anne groaned and buried her face in her pillow.</i><br><br><br>We also have what is possibly the only example of PPC AU Crossover fic, with this little piece that references both the Magical Plot Protectors and the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Transfictional_Canonical_Defence_Authority">TCDA</a>:<br><br><i>&quot;Princesses being the Big Goods is a well-established Magical Girl Trope!&quot; yelled Anne, dodging the gunshots from the TCDA. &quot;Just look at Pretty Cure!&quot;<br>&quot;Likely story!&quot; called an Agent. &quot;I&#39;ve seen way too many Princess!Sues to believe something as fake as that!&quot;</i><br><br>There may well have been other stuff too, but this is what I could find easily. <br><br>- Irish<br></p>

            <p>Both versions of the Pokйmon OFU (the one by Warrior of Many Faces and the Official Fanfiction University of Kanto) have been inactive for a few years now. My third mission is going to bring home a small horde of mini-Missingno, and I need someplace productive to use them. Plus, there are plenty of terribad Pokйmon fanfics around, so clearly we need a Pokйmon OFU.<br><br>How might I go about &quot;rebooting&quot; an inactive OFU? Do I contact the original authors and ask their permission (or for help) first? If they&#39;ve vanished from the Internet (as I assume at least the author of OFUK has), would anyone be willing to assist me in writing a new Pokйmon OFU?</p>

            <p>Or closest equivalent. I&#39;m not sure how compatible PPC tech is with other stuff, so DOSAT might need to create an android, or something. But, I don&#39;t see any explicit rule against it, and besides, having a sentient console trying to take (very petty) revenge on their newfound partner for all those times it was smashed could be very funny indeed. I&#39;d say go for it.</p>
