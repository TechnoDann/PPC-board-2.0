            <p>So, you&#39;re Iximaz&#39;s little brother? Nice to meet you. I&#39;m World-Jumper, the guy who has been <s>slacking off</s> working on that crossover mission with her. Nice too meet you!<br><br>I am afraid I did not see your introductory post before, so I don&#39;t know your fandoms. However, I am assuming you like MLP too, because I like assuming things. So, for your gift, I shall give you a small crystal stature of your favorite character from MLP:FiM. There may be an enchantment on it based on their character. Just, try and keep it safe. Shadow kings may rise from the dead and try to take your CRYSTAAAAL!</p>

            <p><s>That&#39;s not how you spell Twilight Sparkle</s><br><br>Ah, Pinkie Pie! An interesting statue this one. As you hold it, you seem to feel laughter bubbling up inside you. You know, now that you think about it, the world is pretty funny, isn&#39;t it? So many weird things that people do all the time for no reason! Why, you bet people don&#39;t even realize half of the things going on in the world! If they did, everybody would go through life with a laugh in their chest, and a smile on their lips! As another side effect, you seem to be somewhat more observant. You just notice the strangest things around you now! Nothing paranormal, mind you, perfectly normal things. Just, unnoticed. How funny, right?<br><br>Pinkie Pie gives you laughter and awareness. On the bottom is carved: &quot;It was under E!&quot;</p>

            <p>Also, yeah, er, that massively predates A:tLA. That&#39;s where mescaline comes from (a.k.a. peyote after the cactus in question, a.k.a. the stuff Hunter S. Thompson puts on his breakfast cereal). It&#39;s a nice idea, but I&#39;m not totally certain having your staff tanked up on powerful hallucinogens will help them; that said, it could work for agents allergic to Bleeprin and Bleeprin by-products... I just don&#39;t quite know how well, and whether they&#39;d be any good as agents until the walls stopped speaking in purple.<br><br>Still, I&#39;m convinced that a biological supply of Bleeprin has merit, if nothing else to give patients in FicPsych some occupational therapy. =]</p>

            <p>&quot;Hmm.&quot;<br><br>Rosalind looked over at her colleague curiously. &quot;That&#39;s unusual,&quot; she said, &quot;by which I mean that it&#39;s perculiar, or even simply odd, that you, Agent Haar of the Department of Redundancy Department, should make any noise at all, particularly one which is interrogative, speculative, or otherwise thoughtful, such as the one which you did in fact just make.&quot;<br><br>Haar reverted to type, simply staring at Rosalind. Above his eye, a green light flickered blue for a moment, then settled on a shade of pink that was alarmingly close to urple.<br><br>Rosalind coughed. &quot;So,&quot; she said, &quot;might I ask or inquire as to what you were commenting on, or speculating on as it may be?&quot;<br><br>Haar held her gaze, and a string of red lights down the side of his face came on in sequence. He held out a sheaf of paper, fresh from the printer. &quot;This.&quot;<br><br>Rosalind took the papers and leafed through them (three times, naturally). &quot;Ah, Agent Rina Dives of the Department of Mary-Sues, and her partner, Agent Randa Roan of the Department of Mary-Sues, have sent us several messages or communications from their current mission.&quot; She checked the notes a fourth time. &quot;Yes, quite a few letters, emails, and informative communiques.&quot;<br><br>Haar, naturally, said nothing.<br><br>&quot;Well, come along, Haar,&quot; Rosalind said, putting the papers firmly on the desk. &quot;We are needed and required in an unaccustomed manner, one which we have seldom been asked to operate - we are, in point of fact, needed in the field.&quot;<br><br>Haar usually stared at her, but this time the stare seemed more incredulous than usual. An array of green lights on his forehead seemed to flicker out a hundred games of tic tac toe before he finally said, &quot;... what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;With a case or mission as serious and over-the-top redundant as this, the one Agents Rina and Randa have sent us,&quot; Rosalind said, &quot;there is the potential for possible redundancy-related catastrophe and disaster! Why, one time, on one mission one day, Agent Starwind Rohana found herself duplicated not once, not twice, but three times, so that there were four of her, all identical, and her partner, Agent Estelnar Celebduin, who works with her, was trapped and stuck in a thirty-second half-minute temporal time loop which kept replaying for thirty seconds! All of which,&quot; she concluded, &quot;could have been avoided if Agents Starwind Rohana and Estelnar Celebduin had bothered and remembered to inform us, the Department of Redundancy Department, of the redundancy which plagued their mission and cause all the problems which I have explained to you.&quot;<br><br>Haar continued to stare at her. Then he pulled another sheet of paper out of the printer and handed it to Rosalind. &quot;No.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No? What is the meaning which you intend by-?&quot; Rosalind read the sheet, which was a standard notification that Agents Rina and Randa had successfully killed their target and returned to HQ. &quot;Oh. Well... oh.&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Being a latecomer to this whole world of fanfic, I had no idea how bad <i>My Inner Life</i> was. But seeing your mission, it&#39;s clear that even if you believed that fic was a transcript of an actual series of lucid dreams (thus forgiving the Sueishness and the OOC behavior), there&#39;s enough horrible writing that the DTE would be able to do something!  <br>Also, allow me to second Huinesoron&#39;s comment that you&#39;ve done well in ensuring that the mission didn&#39;t devolve into an MST.<br>I must admit, I did find the death-by-punctuation to be a bit anticlimactic, but it was nonetheless funny, as was the mission in general.<br>All in all, a pretty enjoyable mission.<br><br>But of course, it&#39;s not an SOH176 mission comment without the usual SPaG comments, so...<br><br>1) <i>&quot;Be good!&quot; She called before closing the portal.</i><br>The &quot;S&quot; in &quot;She&quot; needs to be lowercase.<br><br>2) <i>&quot;Oh, Faore!&quot;</i><br>That&#39;s a mini-Gohma.

            <p>I loved that. I&#39;m not a fan of the Zelda games, but I read <i>My Inner Life</i> way back when and I thought it&#39;d never get missioned simply due to how bad it was. You have missioned it, and in fine, fine style.

            <p>I enjoyed the mission, and what with this thing apparently being a badfic classic, I kinda want to see the famous bad parts addressed. ^<em>^;<br><br>Also, did you know &lt;a href=&quot;ppc.wikia.com/wiki/LJ</em>Silverblade&quot;&gt;Link Jr. is an agent</a>? I didn&#39;t, but I vaguely recalled knowing the name Jenna Silverblade from somewhere, so I searched it, and lo and behold, there he was. It gives me an idea... suppose Jenna didn&#39;t quite die under all that punctuation, and managed to revive and continue the story? I dunno if Rina and Randa could stand to go back, at least not on their own, but if you could somehow rope Agent Phobos into it, he would be very useful to have along. He knows <i>Ocarina of Time</i> and isn&#39;t bothered by M-rated things.<br><br>... Not that I&#39;m telling you to actually do this, unless you want to. It might be a good story, but not if you simply want nothing more to do with the fic, and who could blame you? Anyway, I wouldn&#39;t want to do it the honor of devoting any more of our time to it than necessary.<br><br>Anyway, good work!<br><br><i>Meanwhile, in FicPsych...</i><br><br>&quot;Ah, Link, you&#39;re awake!

            <p>I would have done the whole thing, or close to it. From what I&#39;ve seen, that seems to be the unspoken rule. (I was <i>this</i> close to going all the way to that stupid Bonding Ceremony, at the very least.)<br><br>But hmm... you bring up an interesting idea. Unfortunately (and I don&#39;t feel bad about saying this, it&#39;s been coming for a while), Randa&#39;s last missions are going to be in the crossovers with World-Jumper and SkarmorySilver. And with Randa being the LoZ expert, Rina would only end up going back if she was partnered with someone who knows the continuum (and her next partner won&#39;t know LoZ, since I really and truly know nothing about the canon except bits and pieces).<br><br>I&#39;ll think about it for a bit, but Randa was pretty much done when we got to chapter two and refused to go any further. So... yeah. No promises. &gt;_&gt;<br><br>And by the way, thank you so much again for letting me borrow Jenni!</p>

            <p>Those four were <i>the</i> Legendary Badfics; you could say the title, and anyone in the Canon Protection Initiative (PPC, GAFF, OFUM... probably a couple of others, but that&#39;s the big three communities) would know what you meant.<br><br>Honestly, I have no idea what the difference is supposed to be between &#39;Bleepfic&#39; and &#39;Legendary Badfic&#39;. I think that was made up when people said &#39;you can&#39;t call that Legendary, I haven&#39;t heard of it&#39;. To my mind, it&#39;s Legendary if it&#39;s... well, legendary.

            <p>As far as I can tell, the difference between Legendary Badfic and Bleepfic is that the former is &quot;infamously bad fanfiction&quot; and the latter is &quot;badfic so bad you wish to rinse your brains with bleach&quot;. TSAB DOWNFALL is bleepfic (still makes me shudder even two years or so after missioning it) while C*l*br**n is Legendary Badfic.</p>

            <p>... I don&#39;t get why we have a list of &#39;Bleepfic&#39;.<br><br>I mean, Legendary Badfic, yes. It&#39;s legendary. There&#39;s not a whole lot of it, either - you can recite the list off the top of your head (which is halfway to being the definition). But, really bad fanfiction? There&#39;s, uh... there&#39;s a lot of that. And any given person&#39;s opinion on what counts is going to vary. So why is there a list, rather than just a term which people can apply to stories they see - &#39;hey, guys, I&#39;ve got a real Bleepfic here&#39;.<br><br>Actually, that&#39;s a lie, I know exactly why. I even vaguely remember the conversation when someone said &#39;hey, this story from [fandom nobody&#39;s heard of] is totally legendary badfic!&#39;, and someone suggested the Bleepfic designation (&amp; list) as a compromise...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s take DOWNFALL as an example again. It&#39;s <i>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</i> x <i>Halo</i>, which means it&#39;ll never reach Legendary Badfic status (<i>Nanoha</i> is a small fandom; even here we have what, three Nanoha fans?) and, in fact, someone out of the fandom concerned might not see why it&#39;s so soul-crushingly bad. Therefore, Bleepfic.<br>Also, it can be added that while the term &#39;Legendary Badfic&#39; is objective (wide renown), &#39;Bleepfic&#39; is much less so (brain-scarringly bad).</p>

            <p>I will admit, I was wondering why it wasn&#39;t considered Legendary since even I had heard of it long before discovering the PPC, and I&#39;m not a LoZ fan. Actually, all of the <i>Zelda</i> fans I&#39;ve talked to have at least heard of it, which is both hilarious and sad, considering it was first published back in, what, the Nineties?<br><br>And, well, it does make sense to have Bleepfics be classified in the same badness level as Legendaries; the only difference is that, like you said, Bleeps aren&#39;t as well-known. I&#39;m planning on taking on that <i>Percy Jackson</i> fic that is basically <i>My Immortal</i> rewritten, but the only place I can find any reference to it is the Pit, where it&#39;s posted. It&#39;s still atrocious, just not very popular.</p>

            <p>What do you think of OCs whose authors desperately tried (and possibly failed) to not make them Sues? I ask mainly because I think I once wrote such a character. Look up Midnight Green on TV Tropes or fimfiction.net. If you&#39;re wondering why there&#39;s no link, it&#39;s because I&#39;m on my Kindle.<br><br>Personally, I think they would have a subconscious aversion to Sueish behavior. Whether they live up to it is another matter entirely.<br><br>I wrote this particular character back when I still liked MLP. He&#39;s not terribly powerful, he just looks like it because his magical talent is messing with light and sound (read: illusion). He had a mild crush on Pinkie Pie, but I stalwartly refused to let him actually do anything about it.<br><br>If he were confronted and sentenced by the PPC, I think that he&#39;d just resign himself to the fact that he failed his author (me) and accept death.</p>

            <p>I one of that kind of authors, whether I succeded or failed, I have no idea, as I have yet to write a fic. Also most of my OC are for a Original Continuum, and that just makes it harder.<br><br>And regarding your fic, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad, but is not that good either, Midnight is a quite good character, but is hampered down by the near-Sueness of his alter ego, also the story doesn&#39;t quite live up to the &quot;comedy&quot; part of its classification, because while the Prologue was very funny, after that, the hilarity gets reduced with each passing chapter.<br><br>All in all, I found it to be an average fic, definitively not bad enough to be killed; actually I think Midnight should be recruited instead, because at least he has personality and does not warp beyond recongnition the canon parts of the story. <br><br>(Coming to think about it, the idea of a pony agent is <i>hilarious</i> by itself)</p>

            <p>I agree; Midnight Green should be recruited. It&#39;s the Zebra Mask that needs to die. He&#39;s some bizarre form of Sue-wraith that attacks OCs instead of canons.<br><br>If anyone decides to beat me to writing that mission, feel free to include Valon. Why? Well, I figured something like this: What if, say, Tolkien himself touched a possessed Legolas? I think that the sheer concentrated canon of being the bleeding author would completey evaporate the wraith&#39;s influence.<br><br>Valon is an exaggerated stand-in for myself, so what do you imagine might happen to a wraith exorcized from his own creation? Let&#39;s play Harry Potter for a bit; you&#39;ll be Professor Quirrell, and I&#39;ll be Harry&#39;s facepalm of doom.<br><br>I&#39;d write the mission myself... but unfortunately, my nine-year-old MacBook has finally breathed its last.

            <p>Why? Because while you created Midnight Green, you <i>also</i> created Zebra Mask, Valon would need to something else too, besides just touching. Also simple exorcism would not cut it, because Midnight is not canon. Gosh, we just got an adversary worthy of <i>Doctor Fate</i>.</p>

            <p>The main character in Midnight Green has an alter-ego named the Zebra Mask, a costumed trickster.

            <p>Surely it would be better for the character to own up to his Stuish past, learn from it, and strive not to make the same mistakes in the future, rather than conveniently foisting all his problems off on some outside influence? If, say, he makes a deliberate choice to stop being Zebra Mask because he doesn&#39;t like himself that way, that&#39;s a lot more meaningful and powerful than him going &quot;It&#39;s not <i>my</i> fault! The Mask <i>made</i> me do it! You can&#39;t blame <i>me</i> for that stuff! I&#39;m perfect just the way I am!&quot; ... See how that&#39;s problematic?<br><br>By the same token, as Edhelistar pointed out, you wrote both the character and his alter ego, so you&#39;d be owning up to <i>your</i> mistakes and striving to improve at the same time. This is a good thing.<br><br>Also, seriously, this notion of Sue-wraiths going after OCs is redundant and silly. An original character that acts like a Sue is a Sue, period. It can only stop being a Sue if it stops acting like one.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I understand why you did this in the RP, and I understand why Iximaz didn&#39;t see the problem and respond to it immediately. But this doesn&#39;t mean that you can just skip the opportunity to fix it when you make an interlude based on the RP.<br><br>&quot;Time is wonky between worlds anyway.&quot; Yeah, that&#39;s the explanation and I tend to forget this. Still, it would be nice to see Rina confused and worried when she realizes that she obviously is no longer in sync with Vania and Doc - and with Randa. From what she can see at this moment, Vania may be visiting Doc, who has already been in the hospital for a day or more. <br><br>Possible solution: Rina asks &quot;How long - &quot; and Vania assures her that she is only a few minutes late.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I initially was thinking of going a different direction, but the RP turned out too lighthearted to use that idea.  (And also, it would have referenced a short story that I&#39;m confident no one but me has heard of, so what would have been the fun for anyone else?)  I wound up just keeping the location, since it still worked for the &quot;cold enough to be dangerous, but with a large and active population to require neuralyzation&quot; angle.</p>

            <p>My work week doesn&#39;t leave much time between shifts for composing long replies.<br><br>The fic is a very weird one, with rather stupid time travel shenanigans on the <i>Pokémon</i> end, and a plot by Dogbert to send Dilbert, Wally and Alice on a giant office building-shaped space ship to start trading with the Pokémon world for PROFIT on the &quot;Dilbert&quot; end.  Which . . . is actually in character for Dogbert, I guess?  But the dialogue for the &quot;Dilbert&quot; characters is so awfully bland, it kind of ruins it.  The actual &quot;Dilbert&quot; part starts with <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183764/92/Universe-Reflections-and-Quantum-Mirrors">chapter 92</a>.  (Sorry for the weird link on the Claimed page, you guys; I think I must have been reading the last chapter at the time before I added it to the list, and forgot to go back to the first chapter before grabbing the link.)<br><br>Anyway, seeing that that fic has nearly doubled in length since I claimed it, I don&#39;t know that it necessarily makes for a good mission anymore.  Even as short as the chapters are, that&#39;s a whole lot of badfic to sit through.<br><br>What do you think, Pretzel?  Are the &quot;Dilbert&quot; canons OOC enough to be a charge?  Is the length worth tackling?  One thing we could try is having our respective agents tackling separate sections of the story, not realizing they both got assigned the fic, and have them meet somewhere in the middle before teaming up to take it out.</p>

            <p>The <i>Dilbert</i> canons don&#39;t seem particularly OOC, save for one thing: they&#39;re all supposed to be engineers of some kind, right? That&#39;s the whole premise of the strip. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d be as blase as they are regarding the fact that, y&#39;know, their office building is now a giant spaceship. I have yet to see any of them geek out and/or freak out about that. Like you said, the dialogue is very bland for them, so I&#39;d say that it&#39;s more of a displacement coupled with an Aura of Smooth or something similar-- perhaps in all the coffee they&#39;ve been drinking? Anyways, I&#39;d suggest a neuralyzation for them all and send them on their way.<br><br>And I have yet to see any mention of cubicle forts. How dare they.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m gonna cut to the chase: <b>Permission Granted!</b> I enjoyed the prompts, especially the first one, and I think the agents will be fun to read about. I don&#39;t note any serious flaws in your writing, even with the formatting issues you mentioned. (May I suggest getting around the indentation issues by not trying? Double line breaks between paragraphs is just fine.) You&#39;ve been around a while, I&#39;ve interacted with you, and you seem nice. So, there you go. {= )<br><br>The only thing I really question is the logic behind Kayt&#39;s name-change. Sure, it&#39;s an odd spelling, but that&#39;s easily fixed—there&#39;s nothing wrong with Kate or Katie, depending on how it&#39;s pronounced. Why the leap all the way to Alloy, and why let Ginger-Wise get away with slapping a new name on her without her input?<br><br>That&#39;s about it for critique, though. Nice work!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Berries grow in specific bush types, and they&#39;re generally leafy-looking things like a cabbage on a stick - not something you&#39;d expect to be possessed of the spikes described in the Pokemon X Dex entry. We also know that there&#39;s foodstuffs other than Pokemon in that universe, otherwise it&#39;d be a bit weird; indeed, Pokeflesh is seen as something of a delicacy (cf. Slowpoke tails). Besides, since a Pokemon can only hold one Bluk Berry at a time, it&#39;d be a bit of a measly shower, but since a Skarmory is a fairly sizeable cove, it can probably scrounge up a few more to use as delicious confetti.<br><br>(in which scape did research for the first time in yonks [=)</p>

            <p>I actually do have an explanation for both of those.<br><br>The whole &quot;why Alloy&quot; thing is because of Ginger-Wise&#39;s own origin.

            <p>There are some things you may want to correct before a Permission Giver sees them.<br><br><i>&quot;... Let&#39;s see if I can actually charge you this time,&quot; <b>Ann</b> growled, shooting <b>Ann</b> a look.</i><br>I’m not sure who is speaking and who is shot a look, but I’m quite sure they are not the same person.<br><br><i>&quot;Stay cool, Ginger-Wise,&quot; she whispered.</i> <br>This looks like a clumsy way to introduce the redhead’s name. You seem to acknowledge that she wouldn’t say this as loud as she spoke before. But if Redhead just whispers to herself, Kayt is not meant to hear her. Thus we get a sudden shift in POV, which then immediately switches back to Kayt. Better let Ginger-Wise tell her name to somebody, or let Kayt reference to her by a spontaneously created nickname. (Thinking of her as “Ginger” and then finding out that she is actually called “Ginger-Wise” may work.)<br> <br><i>They were here, and Kayt hadn&#39;t responded.</i><br>This again looks weird to me. We know that Kayt still didn’t respond to the Marquis suggesting to change her name, and why would she think about &quot;them&quot; – whoever they may be, she doesn’t know – being here?  It may be sufficient to say <i> &quot;I need a new name?&quot; <i>Kayt</i> asked, belatedly.</i> (You probably don’t want to avoid the impression that there is some confusion with several people speaking nearly at the same time.)<br><br>Other than that, it’s quite good. I especially like the door that only &quot;almost always&quot; leads to the bathroom. We don’t often see the PPC’s weirdness spilling over from the corridors into an RC.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Your agents seem interesting, and while the fugees thing has been done a fair bit (hell, one of my agents is just as guilty - actually, that raises the question of whether or not Alloy went through FicPsych, which might make an interesting interlude if you get Permission), you make it work. It&#39;s pretty cool to see an agent who&#39;s been properly messed about with by a Sue in a physiological sense. Ginger-Wise... eh, fits the theme.

            <p>A recruit from World One was my original plan; I only found Ginger-Wise because I beta&#39;d for the mission she was recruited from.

            <p>How would you go about writing a mission if the in-universe canon expert is incapacitated in some way?<br><br>Basically, I have this idea: At the start of a mission, Valon (the canon expert of my team) finds himself on a skyscraper or something and has a full-blown acrophobic panic attack. Since Valon is too terrified to do anything but cling to the nearest structure and gibber like a pack of shoggoths, Kala is left without her guide.<br><br>How could Kala deal with this situation? My first guess is &quot;call for help,&quot; but since neither of my agents has any contacts in the PPC, I can&#39;t think of an in-universe way to justify that.</p>

            <p>Maybe you could blindfold Valon and have him hang onto Kala as she moves about and tells him what&#39;s going on? If that doesn&#39;t jive then I suggest having another canon specialist replace him. If it&#39;s the start of the mission, Kala can guide her partner back to the RC (she stays in the fic so that his replacement can portal to her location) where he can send a Department-wide request for backup via ICEP. He doesn&#39;t need a contact: a general call will suffice. <br><br>Personally, I&#39;ve always been fond of the idea that the Department of Intelligence sends some of its operatives along with Action Department agents if there is a gap in canon knowledge. It&#39;s also like some sort of foreshadowing for hS&#39; post-Sundering PPC where Rangers assist the Paladins during the mission. If you wanna run with that, then go ahead. </p>

            <p>The main PPC timeline got pushed away from the original Sundering timeline by the events of the <i>Door to the Future</i> RP, and more directly by the story <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndTrousers.htm">End of the Beginning: Trousers of Time</a>.

It&#39;s entirely possible the whole &#39;Spies taking an active role in missions&#39; thing was in place before the Sundering, and carried over after; since it may not have been a result of the specific events of that timeline, it could just be the way the PPC is headed.<br><br>And heck, in some sense, it <i>is</i>. All these cowrites, no? Agent Huinesoron isn&#39;t a Spy, but he <i>is</i> a specialist whose only role is to take on joint missions with non-DOGA agents.

            <p>Have you seen Valon&#39;s other appearances? He&#39;s not comfortable being in physical contact with people, especially women (mostly due to his fear of his own sexuality).<br><br>And I feel like after being very far away from solid ground, Valon would mostly shut down, with his mouth on autopilot (the stuttering gibberish of the panicked). My backup idea was tape a note to Nuking Manhatten (a mini-Brawler from Prototype) and send him into HQ to get help (Brawlers are fast).<br><br>Regardless, a mission with this scenario would necessarily be a collab, because I don&#39;t feel like wrestling another character concept out of my brain for just one mission.</p>

            <p>(Man, you Oldbies are getting a lot of attention recently, aren&#39;t you?)<br><br><b>WARNING: SPOILERS FOR <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/182859/its-a-dangerous-business-going-out-your-door">It&#39;s a Dangerous Business, Going Out Your Door</a> AHEAD! UNLESS YOU&#39;RE hS, READ ON AT YOUR OWN RISK!</b><br><br>So, hS, as you might have surmised, I&#39;m going through the MLP fanfic &quot;It&#39;s a Dangerous Business, Going Out Your Door&quot;. So at this point, you may be asking yourself why I specifically sought you out. The answer is that I have a question that requires your extensive Tolkienverse knowledge.<br><br>Here&#39;s the thing: In Chapter 15, Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash run across the deer civilization, and unless I&#39;m misreading things, the fic&#39;s making it very clear that the deer here are expies of Tolkienverse elves: their ruler has the gift of foresight (à la Galadriel), their greeting is <i>Mae govannen</i> (that&#39;s Sindarin, right?), and they live in the woods (so I&#39;m guessing the Shimmerwood is this fic-verse&#39;s version of Lothlórien).<br><br>In the chapter, the author expounds a bit on the deer civilization. My question is this: Is the following based off of the history of Tolkien&#39;s elves?<br><br><i>The deer were a truly ancient folk.  Thousands of years before ponies could write or speak, the various deer species had filled much of the world with civilization, forging great kingdoms and building magnificent cities of crystal and precious gems, their shared culture fueled by their strange and powerful magics.  Unlike ponydom, where complex magical skill was restricted to unicorns, every deer could use magic; moreover, the average deer was far more powerful than the average unicorn, their pair of many-tined antlers able to channel and conduct much more magical energy than a unicorn&#39;s single horn.  Because of this, they had not left many technological achievements behind, save their unparalleled ability to shape crystal and gemstone.  Their cultural achievements were great, however: the deerfolk&#39;s languages had formed the foundations of many modern languages, not just in Equestria but across the world.  Much of common law and accepted interspecies customs had been laid down first by the deerfolk.  Their artistic achievements were magnificent, ancient deer art and sculpture renowned for its elegance.  Deer had also invented the performing arts, with a particular love for the theater.…<br><br>Yet taken together, these were but echoes of the past, and faint ones at that.  There was much about the ancient deer that most ponies did not know, due largely to the one thing everypony did know about them.  One day, for reasons nopony fully understood, the deer had gone to war with each other.  It had been a terrible conflict, spreading across the Earth, lasting decade after decade, unleashing ever more powerful destructive magic.  When it was over, the whole world had lain in ruins, and most of the deer had wiped themselves out.  Those who had survived had withdrawn deep into the world&#39;s forests, and in this age they were rarely seen.</i><br><br>Thanks in advance.<br>SOH176</p>

            <p>In fact, since the sensible way to do this is MST-style, I&#39;m going to invite Agent Huinesoron to cover this one for me. ^<em>^<br><br><i>The deer were a truly ancient folk.</i><br><br>True. We predate humanity by millennia.<br><br><i>Thousands of years before ponies could write or speak,</i><br><br>Or even existed.<br><br><i>the various deer species</i><br><br>Clearly an analogue for the Three Tribes, though &#39;species&#39; implies we couldn&#39;t interbreed - which would make me a biological impossibility.<br><br><i>had filled much of the world with civilization, forging great kingdoms</i><br><br>Now that <i>isn&#39;t</i> true. Before humanity awoke, we were all living in Valinor; most of the world was empty. No, actually, I take that back: the Avari and the Sindar were still there, and I suppose their lands count as &#39;civilisation&#39;. Just about.<br><br><i>and building magnificent cities of crystal and precious gems,</i><br><br>That&#39;s mostly true in Valinor. Unless you count caves with those things set into the walls, in which case Menegroth probably counts as well. (And Nargothrond, naturally, but we built that after the coming of the Sun.)<br><br><i>their shared culture fueled by their strange and powerful magics.</i><br><br>Now that&#39;s just nonsense. I mean, we had our arts, sure, but &#39;magic&#39;? No. Working a mail-coat so that it doesn&#39;t catch the light isn&#39;t sorcery - it&#39;s just a skill.<br><br><i>Unlike ponydom, where complex magical skill was restricted to unicorns,</i><br><br>Or humanity, who are frankly rubbish at anything they&#39;d call &#39;magic&#39;; look at the Numenoreans, who tried to rip off our metalwork. Fingolfin&#39;s sword wounded Morgoth seven times, while a Numenorean knife dissolved after striking the Witch-King just once. Pathetic.<br><br><i>every deer could use magic;</i><br><br>Every elf could learn certain skills, yes. That&#39;s how skills work.<br><br><i>moreover, the average deer was far more powerful than the average unicorn, their pair of many-tined antlers able to channel and conduct much more magical energy than a unicorn&#39;s single horn.</i><br><br>Uh. Only if you interpret &#39;antlers&#39; as a metaphor for our very nature.<br><br>(hS note: but I do love that idea. It&#39;s logical!)<br><br><i>Because of this, they had not left many technological achievements behind,</i><br><br>Nonsense! Swords, stonework, the great shipworks of the Grey Havens - it&#39;s not our fault mortals wander on the outskirts of Mirkwood or Lorien and go &#39;oh, all elves live in trees, eating leaves and drinking dew&#39;.<br><br><i>save their unparalleled ability to shape crystal and gemstone.</i><br><br>Reference to Feanor, or to Celebrimbor? Either way, that only really applies to the Noldor; the other tribes either ignored such things (the Vanyar), or preferred to leave them in natural form (the Teleri).<br><br><i>Their cultural achievements were great, however: the deerfolk&#39;s languages had formed the foundations of many modern languages, not just in Equestria but across the world.</i><br><br>That&#39;s true. The main exception is the Dwarven tongue - and I suppose the rumoured original tongue of mortals, though I don&#39;t believe it ever existed.<br><br><i>Much of common law</i><br><br>We <i>did</i> shape a lot of that. The Edain were pretty primitive, legally speaking, when they reached Beleriand; things got much better when they started adopting our laws.<br><br><i>and accepted interspecies customs had been laid down first by the deerfolk.</i><br><br>I&#39;m not sure what that means. That we didn&#39;t kill the dwarves and mortals when we first met them, so they didn&#39;t kill each other either? I guess. We&#39;re pretty cool that way.<br><br><i>Their artistic achievements were magnificent, ancient deer art and sculpture renowned for its elegance.</i><br><br>^</em>^ Why thank you.<br><br><i>Deer had also invented the performing arts, with a particular love for the theater.…</i><br><br>Is that a backhanded complement? It feels like one, but I&#39;m not sure how. Either way, technically &#39;the performing arts&#39; were invented by Vana and Nessa when they invented dancing, and dance and music were always our favourites; though if you don&#39;t know about the Valar, I suppose you could attribute it to us.<br><br><i>Yet taken together, these were but echoes of the past, and faint ones at that. There was much about the ancient deer that most ponies did not know,</i><br><br>You should hear some of the nonsense they said about us. &#39;So there is a witch in the Golden Wood&#39; - about the Lady Artanis! Really, I ask you!<br><br><i>due largely to the one thing everypony did know about them. One day, for reasons nopony fully understood, the deer had gone to war with each other.</i><br><br>What? No, we didn&#39;t.<br><br><i>It had been a terrible conflict, spreading across the Earth,</i><br><br>No it didn&#39;t!<br><br><i>lasting decade after decade,</i><br><br>Like that&#39;s even a long time - but no, it didn&#39;t!<br><br><i>unleashing ever more powerful destructive magic.</i><br><br>No, we didn&#39;t! Why would we do that?<br><br><i>When it was over, the whole world had lain in ruins,</i><br><br>Now that... okay, I think I see where this is coming from. This story has conflated us with the Valar - and included Morgoth in that number. So yes, I suppose &#39;the pre-human people&#39; went to war with &#39;themselves&#39; and laid a large portion of the world to ruin with terrible forces - but that was us versus Morgoth, not a mass Kinslaying.<br><br>Though... I suppose there&#39;s the argument that orcs are elves, and that we were technically all kinslayers all along... but somehow I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what they&#39;re going for.<br><br><i>and most of the deer had wiped themselves out.</i><br><br>Unfair! We were slaughtered by Morgoth, and later Sauron, not by &#39;ourselves&#39;. Well, I guess the disaster of the Nirnaeth could count as suicide - but not the rest of it!<br><br><i>Those who had survived had withdrawn deep into the world&#39;s forests, and in this age they were rarely seen.</i><br><br>What, the vast forests of Rivendell? The deep woods of the Grey Havens? The reclusive massive trade network of Mirkwood?<br><br>Yes, we &#39;withdrew&#39; - in the same way that mortals &#39;withdrew&#39;. When the world is filled with orcs, trolls, spiders and other horrors, you don&#39;t go larking about in open countryside; you build walled cities, or deep caverns, or hidden refuges. The cities of Gondor had high walls; the people of the Shire never left their country, and were guarded by the Dunedain; and we tended to stay in our own settlements. But not &#39;deep in the forests&#39;; neither of the two forest realms were particularly &#39;deep&#39;.<br><br>In general, it&#39;s clearly inspired by our history - but I think it&#39;s more inspired by general D&amp;D-type elves. &#39;Ooooh, powerful magic &amp; no technology &amp; destructive war &amp; now they all live in trees&#39; - it&#39;s us in the broadest outlines, but the details are from somewhere else.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I think he&#39;s regressing a bit - he&#39;s not meant to be that condescending any more. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

Now comes the time to cast our votes and determine which of them will receive the PG Hat. There can be only <s>one</s> <s>two</s> er, as many as you like, actually. ^<em>^<br><br>Every member of the PPC community can vote, even if you&#39;ve only been here five minutes. You can cast as many votes as you want - as Techno-Dann said last time we did this, we&#39;re looking for good PGs, not the single most popular person. After the voting dies down, I&#39;ll tally things up and announce the results. (Which, barring one far-ahead-of-the-others candidate, will probably be at least two of them, and potentially all three; I&#39;ll be allowing a little leeway between 2nd and 3rd place, in case the vote gets close)<br><br>Post your votes in this thread - or, if you don&#39;t feel comfortable doing so publically, you can email me at huinesoron at-sign hotmail full-stop com.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I&#39;d also like to suggest an extra-ordinary appointment of a Permission Giver, not as part of the above voting. As many of you know, <b>Kaitlyn</b> is our longest-standing member. She read the Original Series when it was still on Fanfiction.net, and has been on the Board longer than any of us. She doesn&#39;t post very much, and she wouldn&#39;t use it if she had it - but I think it&#39;s frankly silly that the Oldest PPCer <i>isn&#39;t</i> a Permission Giver.<br><br>So, in addition to the main vote, if you&#39;ve got an opinion on this side-issue, please cast a vote as to whether or not Kaitlyn should be made a PG. In this case I&#39;ll be going with a simply majority (which, to make this perfectly clear, will have no impact on the main voting - hence, extra-ordinary). Feel free also to <i>not</i> vote on this one, if you simply don&#39;t care. ^</em>^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Also, welcome back, good to see you, even though you probably don&#39;t remember me.<br><br>I like the idea of permission giver emeritus status. Given my absurd inactivity and relatively short period of preceding ...non-inactivity, I doubt I qualify. :P But something like that we could throw at Kaitlyn? After all, though she hasn&#39;t made permission calls as such, she is often a major voice of guidance in big community decisions.</p>

            <p>Let me tell you something, sonny - back in the autumn of aught 2 when I first came to these shores, we didn&#39;t have any of these newfangled permission givers! In those days Jay &amp; Acacia still roamed the land, and a handful of us built this here forum from the ground up with our blood sweat and tears, uphill both ways in ten feet of snow without any shoes! We still had to wait for The Two Towers to hit theatres and George W. Bush was in his first term, we had no iPads, iPhones, or iWhatsits, Livejournal was invite-only - now you young whippersnappers says, &quot;What&#39;s Livejournal?!&quot; That&#39;s right, imagine a world without Facebook, a world without Tumblr, a world without the 5th-7th Harry Potter books - tremble as you imagine a PPC without Huinesoron, because by gum that was the state of things! </p>

            <p>Oh, I&#39;ve just been lurking. I still check the Board most days, although I have very little to say. It has been a case of other things and general real life stuff, but I might return to mission-writing eventually (after all, I did leave the plot on a bit of an ellipsis). If I do, I might want to try and make things a little less formulaic, maybe longer arcs than just each mission (although there was some interlinking previously) and more non-badfic-oriented stories, like interludes or hypothetical events. I doubt it will be for a while yet, though - I have a whole mire of sorting out still ahead of me. Sorry.<br><br>It&#39;s nice to see I&#39;m still remembered around here though!</p>

            <p>And it&#39;s nothing to do with not trusting Kaitlyn&#39;s judgement. I&#39;m a little uncomfortable with sneaking her in outside the usual nomination process, though, and also, if we start handing out honorary PG hats (which is what it amounts to even if you didn&#39;t use those words), where do we stop? I mean, I trust AW&#39;s judgement, too—he&#39;s been seen in living memory—so does he get one? Or Hellga, who I recall participated in some discussions about the <i>Hobbit</i> films? Or Kippur, who showed up quite recently to announce the publication of her book(!); or Nenya, who I&#39;ve talked to within the last couple of years even if no one else has?<br><br>Granted, Nenya&#39;s already a PG, but the point is that if she weren&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t suggest making her one, nor anyone else who isn&#39;t really active in the community at this time. Not because I don&#39;t respect the hell out of them, cuz I do, but I don&#39;t think PG status is the way to show it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That puts her at 9/9, with four possible Yeses on top of that.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>And... eh, might as well throw this up here. How would you feel about the creation of a &#39;deactivated PG&#39; status? I&#39;m thinking it would apply to those PGs who were created long enough ago that they wouldn&#39;t be at all familiar with the current Permission setup (so... oh, anyone who left before 2008, say?), though probably excluding the original three, since they <i>were</i> directly created by J&amp;A. It would mean that, in order to start giving Permission again, they&#39;d need to be active in the community for a certain time period - I&#39;m thinking three months, though I&#39;ve also considered making it 1 or 6.<br><br>In the event that Kaitlyn&#39;s score doesn&#39;t move away from evens (by which I mean, more than +/- 1 either way), I&#39;d suggest making her an immediate deactivated PG, since a fair few of the &#39;No&#39;s have been based not on lack of trust in her judgement, but on the simply fact that she&#39;s not currently active. And, bear in mind, eight people who aren&#39;t me have said she should get a hat; there <i>is</i> a significant viewpoint that it&#39;s appropriate.<br><br>(And, y&#39;know, for the record, I&#39;d be totally fine with making AW, Hellga, and Kips PGs. ^_~)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It gives a title, and some recognition by the community, while also sending a message of, &quot;If you want you use this, you have to become active in the community again.&quot; I am not opposed to this.<br><br>I would say that 6 months should be sufficient. If 6 months is what we want those looking for permission to wait for, 6 should be good for permission givers as well. It is a solid, we know you are serious about staying, number. Besides, 6 months is really not all that long.</p>

            <p>Wait, you helped make that mod? Cool! While I don&#39;t play Vietnam at all (I&#39;m more of a Rome man, myself), I do quite like that civ. Any other mods you worked on, or would just recommend? I am always on the hunt for more mods.</p>

            <p>Ah, Australia. You know, I never gave that civ much attention. It seems I should. The video made him seem interesting.<br><br>While I have been a fan of the Colonialist Legacies series (the Inuit civ being a favorite of mine, for obvious reasons), I have never heard of those other two civs before.

            <p>The reason is, I like more historical mods for Civ V. I did try the Elder Scrolls mod, but I was not a huge fan of that. Better to just play the map with the vanilla civs that inspired the fantasy ones, rather then the new civs. Expecially the Empire. All war-focused, just a bad civ on the whole.<br><br>That said, I did play as Equestria for a while. She lends well to a Scientific or Diplomatic victory, and is very, very poor at war. Which is good, don&#39;t mean to say she should be a war-monger, I&#39;m just saying. Rather OP, but on the whole, fun to play as. New Lunar Republic is interesting, as an alternative to England as a naval superpower, but I prefer Equestria. That said, if I find the New Lunar Republic, I do all in my power to make sure we stay the best of friends. We are practically a single nation with two rulers, by the time I&#39;m done.<br><br>As for any other pony civs... Nah. Just not interested. I will take a look at the model-replacer, it seems very interesting. Thanks for the sugestions!<br><br>(You know, I don&#39;t think I could ever trade Horse while playing as Equestria. I would be a slave trader! D:)</p>

            <p>I agree that recognition of such a long membership is absolutely deserved, but I wonder if a PG hat is the way to go with that.  As you said, being a PG is not an honor, but a job.  Maybe there should be an honorary title/hat/gift that we could give, as a community, to people who deserve recognition.  We do something similar where I work.  If someone does something worthy of recognition, we give them a S.U.P.E.R.S.T.A.R. award (all of that means something that is too long and ridiculous to remember).  It is just a certificate that says you got the award and a small section in the quarterly newsletter.  Just a little thing to say &quot;We appreciate what you do/have done.&quot;<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>In a way, you&#39;re right and it makes sense. On the other hand, what other people said <i>also</i> makes sense and there is little point in making Kaitlyn a PG if she&#39;s not gonna do any (or do very little) PGing.</p>

            <p>That was a pretty good interlude. Good character development all around, and you&#39;ve even mentioned other characters&#39; missions! That&#39;s definitely a plus.<br><br>Of course, a few issues. I mentioned before that in your post, you have the timeline off. You said that this takes place before the Indiana Jones trollfic, while in the interlude itself, it is as clear as crystal that the trollfic mission already happened. Of course, alas! Board posts cannot be edited once posted.<br><br>In addition, a few other errors:<br><br>1)<i>Rina had elbowed her partner in the ribs.<br><br>“About a year,” she said calmly. She turned to Randa and hissed, “That mission took two days, stop going on about it!”<br></i><br><br>It becomes clear in context that Rina is both the actor in the first paragraph and the speaker in the second, but at first, one is confused as to the antecedent of &quot;she&quot;. Either replacing the &quot;she&quot; with &quot;Rina&quot; or removing the paragraph break (i.e., making the two one paragraph) would remove the confusion.<br><br><br>2) <i>the black converse had glittery stains</i><br><br>I&#39;ll defer to someone who&#39;s more knowledgable than I, but isn&#39;t Converse a brand name--hence requiring capitalization here?<br><br><br>3) <i>with the September 11 World Trade Center bombing be involved</i><br><br>Either delete the &quot;be&quot; or change it to &quot;being&quot;.<br><br><br>4)<i>Falchion chirped a quiet laugh as he watched the girls leave. Then he turned to rejoin Rayner, but not before clicking his rear talons at his accomplishment. It felt so good to make some friends around here.<br><br>“Well, I guess the cats and the roosters have finally split up,” the humanized pegasus said with a dry smirk a few minutes later as they walked down another corridor </i>en route<i> to the DF.</i><br><br>First, I think that a scene break is necessary between these two paragraphs.<br>Second, even though &quot;en route&quot; is a French loanword, I don&#39;t think that it needs to be italicized, due to it being so common in English.</p>

            <p>This takes place after the second mission, actually. Falchion was sent to Medical at the end of that mission, as was Sarah, but the former got lost while the latter made it back to the RC and got into trouble.</p>

            <p>The other three &quot;original&quot; Legendary Badfics that hS named each have a page on the wiki.

            <p>It&#39;s a bit more complicated to get through, but if you right click on the page, click on &#39;view page source&#39; that&#39;ll open up in a new tab, scroll down to somewhere around line 300 and that&#39;s where the chapter starts, you can copy from the text from here all you like. The one problem with this is that it shows all the code used on the page, which can make scrolling through it quite confusing, especially as it doesn&#39;t have line breaks or paragraphs (which also makes it slightly unreliable for straight copy-pasting into missions, you&#39;ll need to check how its formatted in the fanfic first. You can also get to there by typing &#39;view-source:link&#39; where link is the url into your search bar thing at the top of the page. <br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>It seems that the author is transplanting the Pevensies to USA despite them being British.

But calling a Japanese Jap is rather American to me.<br><br>Also, Peter gets himself recruited during WW2, and the Pevensies are staying with their uncle and aunt.

            <p>While we&#39;re on this topic, I might as well announce my first claim for DIC:<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8751185/1/Criminal-MindsSSBB-Reckoning">Criminal MindsSSBB: Reckoning</a> by <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3966416/SkyleafAlchemist19">SkyleafAlchemist19</a><br>After an attack on the Smashers, Pit finds himself trapped on Earth, in the care of the BAU team. A series of public attacks points to the same obscure group, who seem to have a vendetta against Earth and the Multiverse. With the Smashers on the run and the team unable to trust their superiors, both groups struggle to unite against an army that threatens them all.<br>Rated: Fiction T - English - Adventure/Suspense - Pit, Marth, Jennifer J./JJ, S. Reid - Chapters: 7 - Words: 21,981 - Reviews: 19 - Favs: 13 - Follows: 19 - Updated: Sep 12, 2013 - Published: Nov 30, 2012 - id: 8751185<br><br>My comment: I honestly have mixed feelings about this thing. On the one hand, the characterization is actually pretty good - most of the time, anyway - for such a... <i>strange</i> mashup. But on the other, you&#39;ve got people angsting because they think Pit is dead, an idiot ball on Zelda&#39;s part, uncanonical locations, an uncanonical main antagonist faction, and the Smash Bros. multiverse somehow including the Earth that the Criminal Minds continuum takes place in as an &quot;off-limits&quot; zone. And the fic itself has been left hanging since 2013.<br><br>Considering that my upcoming DIC team is gonna include that Not!Pit guy I&#39;m recruiting from my Kid Icarus mission, the one tackling <i>this</i> fic will be... interesting, to say the least.</p>

What does this mean? Well, apparently it&#39;s her destiny to have lots of hot sex with Haldir and also become the &quot;Bard of All Earth&quot; or something like that, storing up all the history of Middle-earth in her head for thousands of years... so she can psychically dictate it to none other than J.R.R. Tolkien, who is implied to be one of her descendents. I cannot make an emoticon with a deep enough scowl to properly express my indignation at this.<br><br>Along the way, she discovers the power to make music play in the air around her, subjecting the poor Galadhrim to a lot of 80s rock. Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with 80s rock, mind you, but I can&#39;t imagine that the Elves appreciate it, and it certainly wasn&#39;t written for the lute.<br><br>Enter, if you dare, and marvel at the illogic, the disrespect for canon, the defamation of the Valar, and the random insertion of things like Smut the Dragon and the speshul wolves that become the companions of Bronwyn, Haldir, and their speshul spawn. Not to mention a scene in chapter 22 where Haldir assures her she&#39;s not a Mary Sue, completely not getting what a Mary Sue actually is. {X D<br><br>I also suspect there&#39;s some butchery of Elven languages going on, but I have not the wisdom to confirm it (yet).<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It appears that Powell is actually a fixed surname that came into use in Wales after the patronymic naming system started to disappear, being a shortened form of &#39;ap Hywel&#39;, so essentially the husband&#39;s name is Ramsey son of son of Hywel, which is obviously incorrect. <br>I suppose, however if such a surname were to exist, with the current naming system, someone could take it as there surname, although where the double barreled bit would come in I&#39;m not sure. I can&#39;t currently find too much on what happened in the old Welsh system about what happened when women married, but I think the kept their surname of &#39;ferch &quot;father&quot;&#39;, but I&#39;m no sure that helps in this case.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br></p>
