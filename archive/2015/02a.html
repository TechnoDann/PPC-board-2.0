            <p>After marathoning Peaky Blinders this weekend I was wondering do any of you guys watch the show? I absolutely love it, but I&#39;ll love nearly anything if it is a show about criminal activities or a show that is set in history (which peaky blinders is both).</p>

            <p>As I type, we have started the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl. Despite living in Alaska, I hate Seattle with a passion, so the Patriots are disappointing me so far. Anybody else watching? Want to spend a few moments geeking out over sports for a while?<br><br>Speaking about geeking out: PONIES WERE IN A SUPERBOWL COMMERCIAL! NATIONAL BROADCAST PONIES!!! <b>AHHHH!!!!</b> It was for the post-Superbowl rally, whatever that is. Still! Ponies were considered popular enough to include along Britney Spears, Lego Movie, and many others! This is going to make EQD EXPLODE.<br><br>Anyway, enough pony, more sports! Tom had better pick up his game, and fast.</p>

            <p>And other than &#39;eee so cool (if scientifically inaccurate)&#39;, I have two thoughts:<br><br>1/ Raptor trainers. Yesssss.<br><br>2/ So... what makes the New Dinosaur so much scarier than the old ones? That it keeps trying to kill you, just like <i>T. rex</i> and the now-inaccurate Spinosaurus? That it&#39;s apparently intelligent, just like the <s>raptors</s> <s>deinonychosaurs</s> <b>Maniraptorans</b> - heck, didn&#39;t the spinosaur track Grant and company across half an island, and the tyrannosaurs in II the same? That it&#39;s big, again like <i>T. rex</i> and Spinosaurus? That it&#39;s all three?<br><br>I&#39;unno, maybe it, like, breathes fire, or is immune to electric fences, or something. But I honestly don&#39;t know why they (the filmmakers <i>or</i> the park) wanted a new dinosaur when there&#39;s no real... advantage.<br><br>(Of course, the scariest JP dinosaur has to be <i>Carnotaurus</i> from the <i>Lost World</i> novel. Ambush predator with the ability to camouflage itself against anything, up to and including a <b>chain link fence</b>? Yeah, I&#39;d run from that.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Why the dinosaurs are scientifically inaccurate. It is because the dino DNA was mixed with frog DNA. One side-effect was the ability for dinosaurs to change genders, but another was the loss of feathers. It was not obvious to the scientists at first, because at the time of the first Jurassic Park, they looked exactly as the scientists thought they should look. Only later, after the study of more fossils, did they realize that the dinosaurs were more then a little off. By that time, however, the frog process had been refined and perfected, so it was not worth the energy to try and mix something else, such as birds, to give them feathers.<br><br>But hey, that&#39;s just a theory.

            <p>It draws on pre-existing aspects of the canon - in contrast to the &#39;oh, they just made them like that because they wanted to&#39;, which comes out of nowhere. And mixing warm-blooded proto-bird with cold-blooded amphibian <i>would</i> create some pretty strange interactions - assuming you could get it to work in the first place.<br><br>Which is where I recall the discussion in the book of <i>The Lost World</i> about how the scene with the Hatchery in the first film was total showmanship - most eggs failed to hatch, or produced horrible mutants which had to be put down.

            <p><i>Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme<br>Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine<br>Come lift up your voices, all grief to refrain<br>For we may or might never all meet here again<br><br>Here&#39;s a health to the company and one to my lass<br>Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass<br>Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain<br>For we may or might never all meet here again</i><br><br>It&#39;s been a tense Permission Giver election. A total of 38 PPCers cast their votes; to put that in context, only 65 people posted to the Board last month total, and a fair few of those only made one or two posts.<br><br>And the voting was tight, all the way through. There was always the chance that one of our three candidates could pull out a lead - at various times, each of them was ahead - or fall behind. So how did they do?<br><br><i>Our ship lies at harbour, she&#39;s ready to dock <br>I hope she&#39;s safe landed without any shock <br>If ever we should meet again by land or by sea <br>I will always remember your kindness to me</i><br><br>The lines are closed, the votes have been counted and verified, and I can now reveal <s>that this Big Brother parody has gone too far already</s> the results. In alphabetical order:<br><br>Desdendelle: 29<br>Iximaz: 29<br>PoorCynic: 30<br><br>Yes, despite my transparent attempts to build tension, the votes stayed close all the way through. And that means it is with great pleasure I can hand out Permission Giver Hats to <b>Desdendelle</b>, <b>Iximax</b>, and <b>PoorCynic</b>. Congratulations, guys - and remember, though the work may be hard, if you stick with it, one day you too may... uh... end up with a bunch of new PPCers thinking you&#39;re the most ancient thing since sliced bread. Motivation! ^_^<br><br><i>My footsteps may falter, my wit might fail <br>My course may be challenged by the worst of the gale <br>Ere fortune shall prove to be friend or be foe <br>You will always be with me wherever I go</i><br><br>And of course there was a fourth candidate: Kaitlyn, the Oldest Boarder. This was the genuinely tense part of the election for me: she swung back and forward between &#39;yes&#39; and &#39;no&#39; the whole way. And the final results?<br><br>Yes: 15 (at least)<br>No: 12 (at most)<br><br>So with the greatest pleasure, I hand out a fourth PG hat, with accompanying congratulations, to <b>Kaitlyn</b>. In accordance with the discussion, she&#39;s probably going straight to &#39;Permission Giver Emeritus&#39; status - so you may not see her handing out Permission any time soon, depending on how the discussion goes.<br><br>So there we are. Four new Permission Givers, ladies, gentlemen and starfish. Can we get three cheers?<br><br><i>Here&#39;s a health to the company and one to my lass<br>Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass<br>Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain<br>For we may or might never all meet here again</i><br><br>[To keep the main thread for what it should be - congratulations to our new PGs - I&#39;ll be creating sub-threads for the discussion of what PG Emeritus status should consist of, and for all the Protectorate of Plort/Barons stuff. Try to keep those confined where they belong, please]<br><br>[If you like Celtic folk-songs of the kind used to provide the soundtrack to this post, I highly recommend <a href="https://heatherdale.com/">Heather Dale&#39;s</a> recent album &#39;My Celtic Heart&#39;, which is where I learnt this one. Her store has samples for all her songs, and you should also be able to find her free album &#39;Perpetual Gift&#39;, if you want to get a proper feel for her style]<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been suggested several times during the PG election that we ought to have some kind of &#39;PG Emeritus&#39; status - something that says someone is still a Permission Giver, but isn&#39;t currently entitled to give Permission. This is the sub-thread to discuss exactly how that should work. I&#39;m hoping for a consensus, not a vote, so let&#39;s aim for that.<br><br>The questions, as I see them, are basically two: how does PG Emeritus status get activated, and how does it get removed?<br><br>Options I can think of for flipping to Emeritus:<br><br>-Don&#39;t post or visit the IRC at all for a given period of time.<br>-Don&#39;t meet a minimum level of activity for a given period.<br>-Be inactive, and have been made a PG a certain amount of time ago.<br>-Be inactive, and have been made a PG before a certain date.<br><br>My thought is that we should probably be looking at &#39;zero activity&#39; as the benchmark; Techno-Dann, VixenMage and Araeph would all probably fail to meet any kind of &#39;minimum activity&#39; line, but I can&#39;t imagine anyone wants to deactivate them. So how long do you have to be &#39;gone&#39; for? Personally I&#39;d suggest a year, solely because it&#39;s a nice round number.<br><br>The other option is to make it so that &#39;old PGs&#39; are deactivated, even if they pop in occasionally. In that case, I&#39;d probably set the benchmark at the introduction of Permission 3.0 - the &#39;writing samples from the table&#39; model. If you haven&#39;t been active since then, you probably won&#39;t know how to do it, and you giving Permission will just confuse things.<br><br>(Either way, note that Kaitlyn will drop straight to Emeritus status; she&#39;s fine with that, and at least two of her &#39;no&#39; votes have said they&#39;d accept that option)<br><br>(Other note: I think it would be extraordinarily rude to &#39;deactivate&#39; any of the first five PGs: Jay, Acacia, Miss Cam, GreyLadyBast, or Thalia Weaver. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be any argument for the Originals, but feel free to debate the other three if you want)<br><br>Options I can think of for returning to Active:<br><br>-Post at all.<br>-Make a certain number of posts.<br>-Be active (either posting at all, or at a certain activity level) for a given period.<br>-Specifically request activation.<br><br>My preference would probably be &#39;active for a given period&#39;. I&#39;d define active as something like 5-10 posts a month - which, according to my records, is what PoorCynic is averaging, and we just voted him in - and say you have to meet it for three months. That&#39;s midway between the line for requesting Permission, and the arbitrary benchmark I imposed this time for becoming a Permission Giver.<br><br>So: discussion open. I don&#39;t think this needs to be a PGs-only decision, though I would like all our active PGs to chime in if they&#39;re interested.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... I&#39;m inclined to go with a less formal way of handling this. I&#39;ll work up an &#39;FAQ for Returnbies&#39;, which will include something like this:<br><br><i><b>Q. Can I give out [[Permission]]?</b><br><br>A. Were you ever a Permission Giver? If not, we&#39;re afraid not! If you were, it&#39;d be a good idea to familiarise yourself with the current system - it might have changed quite a bit since you were last here. It&#39;s also recommended that you take an active role in the community for a while before you start granting Permission - that way you know who everyone is, and everyone knows you.</i><br><br>That gets the gist of &#39;Emeritus&#39; across, without formalising it into a title (and leading to Hieronymus&#39; dilemma of who updated the Wiki).

            <p>Looking on the Wiki’s list of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission_Giver"> Permission Givers</a>, the First Five (Jay and Acacia, and GreyLadyBast, Miss Cam and Thalia Weaver) cannot be affected by community decisions. Should they have “permanent” appended to their names?<br><br>Everybody else who is not also currently a <b>voting</b> member of Plort’s Baronical Council (BeautyID, Bjam, Doc Filth, DML, JulyFlame, Kaitlyn, Laburnum, Leto Haven, NenyaQuende, Rohirric Monkey, Sedri, Tough Cookie, Trojie and TZA), is by default considered to have been seen only very occasionally at best for a long time, and will get “inactive” appended to their names. Any objections? July?<br><br>Supposing that “zero activity” for at least one year will be the consensus, at any time (or only at a specific occasion, like the annual Baronial Council?), somebody suspecting that a PG may have left without notice may ask whether PG Insert-Name-Here has been seen posting on the Board, chatting in the IRC or editing the Wiki during the last year. If nobody speaks up within a reasonable span of time, somebody may then edit the Wiki to append “inactive” to PG Insert-Name-Here. (This will probably be Makari’s fate in the near future, leaving us with ten active Permission Givers.)<br> <br>But I don’t see how automatic reactivation after three months of sufficient activity should work.

            <p>I think the &#39;zero activity for a year&#39; benchmark is a sound one. If a PG Emeritus returns and wants to have said status removed, they should demonstrate a reasonable level of activity on the board for at least a month.

            <p>I like the ideas you set forth (inactive for at least a year is probably a good length of time) and if the PG has been inactive since before the new system was implemented, then it&#39;s probably safe to move them to Emeritus as well.<br><br>I was under the impression that VixenMage, Techno-Dann, and Araeph were chronic lurkers, so they&#39;d be up to speed with the new system...

Not really much else to say on that.<br><br>But, erm, since when has the wait for Permission been six months?

            <p>Well, by those rules I&#39;d go straight to Emeritus... I know I post very rarely any more, though I lurk a lot. And I&#39;m fine with that on a personal level.<br><br>But on a broader view, it seems to me what you&#39;re suggesting is basically &quot;if you&#39;re not <i>these particular people</i>, you have to meet a certain (arbitrary?) standard or lose certain abilities until you specifically ask for them back&quot;.

            <p>As in, I listed various options to be considered, with the intent of a decision between them.

            <p>Barons, Knights, and Civilians of the Union of Plort, I beg your indulgence for a few small matters of consequence before we commence our celebration of the founding of Castle Harpwire.<br><br>First, due to her continued absence from these shores, the barony of Makari is being deactivated, and divided between Barony Dann and Barony VixenMage. As ever, should Baron Makari return, she will be entitled to reclaim her barony from those who now watch over it. [Because I don&#39;t want to straight-up erase her, but equally, my maps will get messy if I just keep inactive PGs on there indefinitely.]<br><br>Secondly, the Refuge of Ozerbord would like to confirm the wording of our constitution: that the office of Protector in Ozerbord rests on the person of Baron Huinesoron, <i>not</i> on his position as the sole baron in Ozerbord. While military administration is divided along baronial lines, the civilian government of Ozerbord is solely the province of Baron Huinesoron. [Basically because I&#39;m the only person with admin powers over the Other Board, which in accordance with the &#39;reflection of reality&#39; nature of Plort, means I must be the head of government. ^<em>^]<br><br>Thirdly, Baron Huinesoron has paid out of his own pocket to fund the construction of roads between every current baronial seat and its nearest population centre; by this measure it is hoped that the travel of our barons to the Baronial Council this summer will be significantly eased. Regretfully, however, the isolated and forested position of Tegnoh has meant that it is unable to be connected. [That&#39;s Baronies Araeph, Huinesoron, and Cassie, plus any rural castles that crop up in the next post; basically this is to make my maps make more sense.]<br><br>Fourthly, it gives me great pleasure to announce the creation of <b>four new baronies</b>. The Baronial Council has discussed the candidates extensively, and surveyed the feelings of the populace, and we are pleased to confer the rights, privileges, and duties of a Baron of Plort upon:<br><br><b>Lady Iximaz,</b> the Far-Travelled<br><b>Lady Kaitlyn,</b> the Knight Who Goes ^</em>^<br><b>Sir PC,</b> the Poor Cynick<br><b>Thanasius Ampelius,</b> the Warrior Monk<br><br>In accordance with the Edict of Bast, the domains of these barons will be decided based on their lands of residence. I therefore call upon them to declare before this company which of the nations of Konti-Nyuum they will take under their protection, that their borders may be set and confirmed.<br><br>[Okay, basically, please name one or more of the four nations, based on your interests in the PPC. If you spend a lot of time in the chat, that&#39;s Iric; if you&#39;re on the Wiki a lot, that&#39;s Wechi; if you get into a lot of RPs, that&#39;s Ozerbord, and if you&#39;re on the Board, that&#39;s, uh, Borrd. You <b>can</b> choose multiple, up to three - but you can&#39;t hold land in both Iric and Ozerbord, since they don&#39;t border each other. One or two countries is best. Any special requests, such as coast towns, cities, or even specific areas of land, will be considered; basically I aim to leave everyone their castle, and keep borders to geographical features; beyond that, I&#39;m willing to shift everything around]<br><br>[The map of Konti-Nyuum can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2BqT7Icn8igVFFUUGlnZ2F1dGc/edit">here</a>, if you need it.]<br><br>~~~~~~~~~<br><br>&quot;I got you something.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn (Lady of Ozerbord, Knight Who Goes ^_^, secret Duchess-in-Exile of El-Jheycom) looked up from her desk to see her husband holding a sheet of paper. &quot;From the capital?&quot; she asked. &quot;New reports from the Marizu League?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not exactly.&quot; Baron Huinesoron put on his best &#39;serious&#39; face. &quot;&#39;Lady Kaitlyn-&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t I merit a &#39;sir&#39;?&quot; Kaitlyn asked. &quot;I thought after all these years... never mind. So is this about the hospital?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shh.&quot; Baron Huinesoron cleared his throat. &quot;&#39;Lady Kaitlyn: in recognition of your long service in the lands of Konti-Nyuum, and your honourable aquittal of the duties which you have assumed-&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sweet Kanun, tell me they&#39;re not throwing a ball in my honour,&quot; Kaitlyn groaned. &quot;Can you imagine how-?&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;<i>We, the Baronial Council of the Union of Plort,</i>&#39;&quot; Huinesoron continued over her protests, &quot;&#39;do hereby confer upon you the rights, privileges, and duties of a Baron of Plort-&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>What?!</i>&quot; Kaitlyn leapt to her feet. &quot;Is this a joke? Because I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s not funny-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No joke,&quot; Huinesoron assured her. &quot;I&#39;ve got a map of your new domain, too. It runs from, let me see... from the banks of the Karaktar to the Larninkurv Mountains, and along the curve of the Lhawgin Heights.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;El-Jheycom,&quot; she breathed. &quot;Huinesoron, how--?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Edict of Bast lays a heavy emphasis on historical association,&quot; Huinesoron said. &quot;The fact that you&#39;re currently living in another baron&#39;s castle means your <i>present</i> residence can&#39;t be considered, so...&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn let out a sound that could best be described as a &#39;squee&#39;, and threw herself into her husband&#39;s arms. &quot;I don&#39;t know how you managed this,&quot; she said, &quot;but thank you, thank you, <i>thank you</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not all good news,&quot; Huinesoron told her, holding her close. &quot;The Baronial Council was split on the issue of your appointment, so we had to make a few... compromises. Specifically, since you&#39;re not actually living in your-- in Barony Kaitlyn, you&#39;ve been created a &#39;non-administrative baron&#39;.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn leant back and quirked an eyebrow at him. &quot;Which means?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t have a vote in the Baronial Council, or the Council of Borrd,&quot; Huinesoron said. &quot;You have full baronial powers, but nothing above that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... which means we won&#39;t be declaring independence any time soon,&quot; Kaitlyn concluded. &quot;A clever move. But just give us time. El-Jheycom&#39;s sun will rise again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sure it will,&quot; Huinesoron said. &quot;And you, Baron Kaitlyn, will be there to see it.&quot;<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/BaronyKaitlyn.png"><br><br><i>Here&#39;s a health to the dear lass that I love so well<br>Her style and her beauty, sure none can excel<br>There&#39;s a smile upon her countenance as she sits upon my knee<br>There is no-one in this wide world as happy as me<br><br>Here&#39;s a health to the company and one to my lass<br>Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass<br>Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain<br>For we may or might never all meet here again</i><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Keep De&#39;endee&#39;s construction was nearly complete, thanks to the extensive use of magic. Lady Iximaz smiled to herself as she looked around the recently-built great hall, though the smile quickly disappeared when she remembered the veritable mountain of paperwork awaiting her.<br><br>The newly-appointed Baroness rubbed her temples, grudgingly deciding it would be best to not delay in answering the other Barons&#39; missives. Newness to the position aside, she was also the youngest Baron now serving on the Council, and she couldn&#39;t give anyone a reason to doubt her ability. <br><br>She made her way back to her chambers, her boots falling heavily on the flagstones. Inside, her desk was nearly hidden beneath all the scrolls; it looked like several more letters had been delivered during the day. She groaned and reached for the scroll bearing the mark of Baron Huinesoron.<br><br>After reading through it, Iximaz groaned again and let her head fall on the desk, accidentally crushing several scrolls.<br><br>&quot;Well, this is just perfect,&quot; she muttered, balling up the letter and throwing it over her shoulder. &quot;Of all the bad timing— ugh!&quot; She reache into her desk and pulled out a fresh piece of parchment, failing to notice that it was stuck to the letter from Knight Jumper. Iximaz penned a brief letter to Baron Huinesoron expressing her regrets, but she had already announced her intentions to throw a banquet of her own in honor of he knights who were moving to her barony.<br><br>&quot;And what a foolish decision <i>that</i> was,&quot; she said aloud, scratching her signature at the bottom of the letter and blowing on the ink. She seemed to be talking to herself a lot as of late.<br><br>It was true, though. She was already in far over her head than she&#39;d anticipated, learning the niceties of running a barony such as setting and collecting taxes, settling trade agreements, forming tentative relationships with the other barons— and then she&#39;d gone and decided to throw a banquet, of all things!<br><br>Jaikaiar willing, things would soon settle down and she would be able to resume her fight against the Marizu. But until then, she would have to wait.</p>

            <p>Construction of the Arpying Road was still ongoing as Baron Huinesoron rode along it. Fortunately, the clifftops of Barony Iximaz were grassy and level, so even the stretch between the road reaching out from Critta-Kalthin and the one rising to meet it from De&#39;endee was an easy journey. As Keep De&#39;endee came into sight, the baron turned to his companion.<br><br>&quot;Impressive,&quot; he said, gesturing at the castle. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have thought she could raise a castle so quickly.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Lady Iximaz has had a lot of help,&quot; Freckles pointed out. &quot;Sandra tells me the Knight Ion has joined her barony - at this rate, Critta-Kalthin will be larger than Ozerbord before the year is out.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not that that&#39;s saying much,&quot; Baron Huinesoron chuckled. &quot;Our little capital isn&#39;t terribly impressive, is it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah - no, my lord,&quot; Freckles agreed. &quot;But still...&quot;<br><br>&quot;But still.&quot; Huinesoron looked at Keep De&#39;endee again. &quot;Well. With all these new vassals and allys, she should be eager to accept my proposal.&quot;<br><br>The two rode along in silence for a few minutes. Then Freckles tilted her head. &quot;Uh, my lord...&quot;<br><br>&quot;You know that&#39;s not how I meant it,&quot; Huinesoron said. &quot;Stop smirking.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, my lord.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And don&#39;t you dare tell my wife.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>The pounding on the door of De&#39;endee would have been loud enough to wake the dead, except that Lady Iximaz would already have had them up and about helping to set up her barony. When the door was opened, it revealed Baron Huinesoron, decked out in rough travelling clothes.<br><br>The baron stepped into De&#39;endee and looked around thoughtfully. &quot;Impressive acoustics,&quot; he remarked, his voice echoing back from the far side of the Great Hall. &quot;But I am not here to comment on the architecture. Please conduct me to Lady Iximaz.&quot;<br><br>Baron Huinesoron&#39;s proposal, once he laid it out for the resident baron, was simple. Ozerbord had need of sand, he explained - the fine sand that was found on the beaches around Critta-Kalthin. They would be willing to pay well for it - in currency, in food, in trade agreements, or in the still-secret end product of Barony Huinesoron&#39;s planned new industry. But, given the currently free-falling state of Barony Huinesoron&#39;s economy, he would need it soon. As in, &#39;how soon can you start digging?&#39;.<br><br>hS<br><br>[Trade agreements! ... stars, have I just turned Plort into <i>The Phantom Menace</i>? &#39;Wars? Pfeh. Magic? Blah. What this setting really needs is POLITICS AND NEGOTIATIONS.&#39;]<br><br>[Nah, don&#39;t worry. Things will get exciting again once I have my trade routes in place.]</p>

            <p>What on Earth could he want sand for? Did he intend to produce glass? Use it in construction?<br><br>&quot;Well, my lo- er, Baron,&quot; she said, mentally chastising herself for the slip, &quot;if it is sand you wish to trade for, I see no objections.&quot; <br><br>She requested that, in exchange for her barony&#39;s sand, the trade restrictions currently in place would be lessened. After all, she reasoned, once Huinesoron&#39;s final product was revealed, it would likely be possible for her own craftsmen to replicate it; Baron Huinesoron had said nothing about the final product being under his sole control.<br><br>[Yeesh, I&#39;m not good at this politicking schtick.

            <p>Dark Civilian Aakmal has just arrived at the outskirts of Keep De&#39;endee with his retinue, caravans, supplies including living livestock, and gold, meaning to supply for a feast and finally paying taxes to one liege. Having two Barons squabbling over his town&#39;s loyalty is a landmine; one misstep and Critta&#39; will burn to ash. And not paying any taxes to both lieges causes some disastrous losses, as his traders&#39; boats has been confiscated by one liege or another.<br><br>But now that the people of Kalthin has joined his town, and recent news that Lady Iximaz is offered Baronship and has taken Critta&#39;-Kalthin as one of his vassal, is something to be celebrated. His entourage closes in to the keep, but stops at arrow&#39;s shot. An orc swings the banner left and right to catch attention.<br><br>&quot;Datu, there isn&#39;t a sound. Looks like the keep&#39;s empty.&quot; The orc says to Aakmal.<br><br>&quot;Impossible, even during noon there should be some scouts...&quot;<br><br>From the east, suddenly a group of riders gallops their horses to Aakmal&#39;s entourage. A short, stout man leads the riders, and his horse trops forward a few steps after the other riders has stopped a few feet back. <br><br>&quot;Greetings, who is Dark Civilian Aakmal? I am  the herald of Lady Iximaz, and I shall escort him to the gates.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am Dark Civilian Aakmal, but I do not know Her Ladyship is expecting me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She hasn&#39;t yet, but I will send one man to notify her.&quot; He signals one rider, and he nods. Soon the horse is already galloping, carrying its rider to De&#39;endee.<br><br>After half an hour, Dark Civilian Aakmal is brought through the front gates. The castle is busy with workers working their materials and magicians forming spells unto the structures. His entourage unloads the baggage into middle of the ward. A few men sets up tents to shield the supplies and the retinue and their leader from the sun. Now Aakmal sits crosslegged on the ground, waiting for the invitation to enter the hall.<br></p>

            <p>Darkotas stood in the courtyard, planning out meticulous details of seating and decoration. The young man motioned to a group of men, watching as they lifted an enormous table to carry it to a predetermined area. With a nod, he dismissed the workers and made a note on the placement. Hearing his name called out, he turned to see Lady Iximaz and a stranger approaching. He cleared his throat and stepped forward to address the pair.<br>&quot;Hello, my Lady!

Is there anything you require?&quot;<br><br>((I&#39;m still very new to this, so feel free to take this wherever you&#39;d like, Iximaz.

            <p>&quot;Greetings, Darkatos. I am Dark Civilian Aakmal, just call ke Aakmal. First off, may we be pointed to the storeroom for foodstuffs and the pens for livestock? I have brought more supplies  for the feast. Secondly, I&#39;d like to  offer my workers to help you prepare for the feast. Thirdly, perhaps some biscuits and tea for us after loading the supplies into the storage?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Welcome, Aakmal. The storeroom is just down the hallway on your left; it should be the third door on the right. The pens are not yet complete, but we have a temporary enclosure on the west side. I appreciate the aid as well; at the moment, my men are constructing the barracks and could use a few more hands. Alternatively, our chefs could use assistance if your men are so inclined. If you take a seat, I will prepare your refreshments momentarily.&quot;</p>

            <p>Aakmal points his thumb to a tall, dark man. &quot;Saiful, get back to our supplies and your company guard the gold. I intend to offer it formally to Lady Iximaz in a ceremony. Await my further orders.&quot; Saiful immediately jogs away.<br><br>Then he points to a shorter man wearing Norse clothing. &quot;David, you are in charge of supplies, bring them to the storeroom. Dasgiz&#39;s company are to help you.&quot; David nods and leaves.<br><br>Now Aakmal orders the orc wearing a broad-brimmed hat. &quot;Tulgash, you are in charge of livestock, bring them to the enclosure. Ensure the animals are well-fed and watered.&quot; Tulgash tips his hat, and walks swiftly away.<br><br>&quot;Now, Darkotas, Lady Iximaz. According to the customs of the land where I came from, when a lord throws a feast, everyone including the workers and slaves are automatically invited. Of course the nobles and guests of honour are seated further away from the rabbles. Thus I have brought 400 chickens, 50 cows, 200 goats, 400 quails, half a ton of spices, half a ton of onions, shallots, ginger, and garlic, half a ton of sugar, a quarter ton of salt, five tons of rice, five tons of wheat flour, three tons of firewood, a few tons of carrots, cabbages, brinjals, turnips, and long cabbages.<br><br>&quot;Darkotas, according to the customs too, I am supposed to provide some meals to my labourers. So if you would kindly extend the tea and biscuits to my workers, with permission from Lady Iximaz,&quot; Aakmal pauses as he nods to her, &quot;I would be most glad. However, if you can&#39;t, I understand.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will arrange for volunteers for your chefs and construction workers. They will begin work tomorrow, as we are still weary from the journey. Thus I also ask for permission to set up more tents.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lady Iximaz,&quot; now Dark Civilian Aakmal bows, &quot;I would like to give you some of the gold I have brought as payment for the delayed tax that I could not pay, as Baron Huinesoron and Baron Neshomeh had quarreled over the jurisdiction of my town. I couldn&#39;t pay a Baron over the other, in fear of escalating the tension. But I would also like a ceremony to officiate our relationship, me as vassal and you as liege. So that no one may contest the overlordship of my town, if you would be so kind.&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>In the deep shadows and warm places of the new barony, the Scapegrace watched and wondered. There was work here, work for her people - the people of the road, the nameless and the nothing-bearers, the Lurking-Kind. She saw, and it was good.<br><br>The baronial castle of Lady Iximaz was shaping up to be a fine thing indeed, crouched atop a hillock like a fat toad waiting for the flies. And flies would come, and filth, and gold; a town would spring up around the castle to trade along the river, and the people would need things, and the nothing-bearers would be moved on, again. Unless, unless...<br><br>&quot;Lady Iximaz. A good title, and earned.&quot; Scapegrace grinned, showing teeth that ought not to be shown in public where children might see. &quot;I too will pay my taxes. Here.&quot; She fished in a pocket and produced a few coppers, flipping them into a chest. &quot;My service is yours. The ones who wait and see are yours as well. I would curtsy, but my bones are aching of a winter&#39;s travel. Beggars an&#39; health are swiftly parted.&quot;<br><br>She withdrew something else from her tattered parody of finery - a thin, steel thing, pitted with rust but still dangerous-looking, a burnt-orange line in the air, it seemed. &quot;I&#39;ve no blade to offer save this. No knight am I. No fine sword an&#39; horse an&#39; servants to make obsequies at me all day. Some fights, though, a good and noble knight,&quot; she almost spat the words, thought that might have been a rattling cough talking, &quot;cannot fight, nor can gentle folk carry every day. &#39;Tis enough, though, oh yes... &#39;tis enough, in the proper place. For is that not the business of a fine and noble lady?&quot;<br><br>There was a blur. A turnip was skewered, ripped from its sealed crate by the bony hag, who secreted it about her person along with the metal and a few of the more valuable looking splinters. &quot;The knowin&#39; of proper places.&quot;</p>

            <p>The transformation had been a rapid one. In a few days, what had been a relatively open stretch of low, rolling hills near the Iron Highway had turned into a teeming sea of tents and carts. The entire area was alive with activity: soldiers training, children at play, merchants hawking their wares, cutpurses plying their trade, and grey-haired scholars giving lectures to whomever would listen. Had the buildings not been made of canvas, it might have passed for almost any other town in the protectorate.<br><br>Baron PC, the Poor Cynick, arched one eyebrow as he looked over the makeshift community from a nearby hill. It was both astonishing and gratifying, how the people had flocked out to the site where -- Mike and Joel willing -- the fortress of Worhkshap would soon arise. The first time he had emerged from his own tent and seen the others rising nearby was when the truth of his appointment became anchored in his mind. A missive was one thing, but this? Hundreds of people sheltered under his banner? That was more than any gesture from the Baronial Council.<br><br>He let his eyes trail back down to the various documents on the table in front of him. There were engineering analyses about the stability of the land, architectural plans for Worhkshap itself, guard reports on incidents in the tent city, and a dozen other things that needed his attention. But what he was most interested in now was a map.<br><br>&quot;You are certain this is the most recent map?&quot; he asked a nearby page. &quot;I recall there being some confusion before about where the borders of Barony Thanasius Ampelius fell.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, my lord,&quot; the page replied. &quot;A messenger brought it directly from Borrd itself.&quot;<br><br>PC traced one finger along the newly delineated lines. &quot;It seems I came out of this quite well. The other new barons have rather less expansive domains.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Perhaps it was a reward for your service, my lord,&quot; the page replied.<br><br>PC was silent for a moment. &quot;That may be,&quot; he finally said, the doubt heavy in his voice. &quot;Or perhaps there is something else at play, especially considering that the major mines fall under my dominion.&quot; The baron leaned back in his chair and tapped his fingers together. &quot;The Council is ever so fond of their games of intrigue. I cannot help but feel that I am either being tested or being used.&quot;<br><br>He looked up at the page and allowed a faint smile to come to his face. &quot;In any event,&quot; he continued, &quot;it should prove to be interesting. Perhaps it would behoove me to test the waters, so to speak.&quot;<br><br>The page straightened up as PC rose to his feet. &quot;What would you have me do, my lord?&quot; she asked.<br><br>&quot;I want messages sent to the other barons thanking them for their support. Have gifts sent to those whose lands are now under my dominion. Nothing outlandish, but enough to demonstrate my gratitude for their reasonableness.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Anything else?&quot;<br><br>PC paused again. He glanced down at the map. &quot;Organize a scouting team. I want to see if there&#39;s a pass through the Mountains of Reverence that might support a road. Having an easier way north would be of great benefit.&quot;<br><br>The page nodded. &quot;Understood, my lord.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excellent.&quot; He picked up a missive from the reeve of Risersh. &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have new duties with which to acquaint myself.&quot;<br><br>[Thought I&#39;d get a little bit more into the role-playing aspect.]</p>

            <p>The last standing tower of the ruined castle More Owls rose high above the treetops of the Umor Woods. Perched on the very top of its wall, Baron Huinesoron looked at his companion with a disgruntled expression. &quot;I&#39;m supposed to be on my way to Weab,&quot; he said, &quot;and <i>you&#39;re</i> supposed to be letting my wife know. Would you care to explain why you&#39;ve dragged me all the way out here?&quot;<br><br>Freckles the messenger handed her lord a spyglass and pointed at the distant Mountains of Reverence. &quot;Just below Kenzlaya peak,&quot; she said quietly.<br><br>Huinesoron squinted through the glass. &quot;I see people,&quot; he said. &quot;About five of them. Some sort of scouting party?&quot;<br><br>&quot;From Baron PC,&quot; Freckles confirmed. &quot;They&#39;re searching for a pass through the mountains - a new trade route to the north.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron frowned, and shifted the glass downwards. The line of the Lhawjeck river was just visible as a gap in the expanse of trees. &quot;Is the Barnacle Way still navigable?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mostly,&quot; Freckles confirmed. &quot;It&#39;ll take him a while to clear out the undergrowth, but if he can find the pass and the road, it would be worth the investment.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We should have brought down the pass as soon as we took it over,&quot; Huinesoron grumbled. &quot;This was inevitable as soon as we lost control of the mines.&quot;<br><br>Freckles looked sideways at her lord. &quot;We still could,&quot; she pointed out. &quot;They haven&#39;t found it yet. Sandra and I could get in there and bring half the mountain down if we need to.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron turned to look at his messenger-stroke-spy-stroke-saboteur. &quot;That,&quot; he said, &quot;would be an act of war.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Only if Baron PC found out,&quot; Freckles replied. &quot;He would never have to know - and we&#39;d keep the Copperway trade. You could say that trying to cut us off is economic warfare, anyway.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Baron Huinesoron agreed softly, &quot;I could.&quot; He raised the glass again, studying the distant scouting party. &quot;And with our port and shipwrights both taken from us, Barony Huinesoron is going to be <i>very</i> low on funds in the near future. But still... war...&quot;<br><br>He tracked his view sideways, to the pass that Baron BeautyID had cleared years before to provide access to Baron Bjam&#39;s holdings - the pass that he had meticulously disguised and erased when he took control of the region. It wouldn&#39;t take long for Baron PC&#39;s scouts to find it, and with all the equipment and manpower now available to him, clearing the road would be simple.<br><br>&quot;All right,&quot; the baron said at last, &quot;I have a plan. Let&#39;s get down to ground level again. Then... we need to find out just how navigable the Barnacle Way is.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>To say that Baron PC&#39;s scouts were surprised to find the Lord Protector of Ozerbord hailing them from the slopes below would be an understatement. After a brief debate over whether this technically qualified as a military incursion, and whether it was appropriate to tie the baron up as a prisoner, they yielded to his request and led him down the south face of Mount Kenzlaya, and all the way to the construction site that was Worhkshap.<br><br>Huinesoron thus became the first baron to pay an official visit to Baron PC. When the requisite pleasantries had been exchanged, he got straight down to business.<br><br>&quot;There is a pass through the Reverences,&quot; Huinesoron said, &quot;and a road on the far side, following the line of the Lhawjeck. My messenger here will lead your scouts to it, if you wish.<br><br>&quot;And once you have a route to the Umor Woods open, I wish to make a trade agreement with you. I have... a plan, to sustain the economy of Ozerbord; but in order to carry it out, I will have need of a great deal of lumber. You already have the infrastructure in place from the mines; cutting wood is, I assume, a plan that has already crossed your mind. I would like to purchase it.<br><br>&quot;What do you say?&quot;<br><br>hS<br><br>[What, you didn&#39;t really think I was going to declare war, did you? ;)]</p>

            <p>&quot;The scouts have returned, my lord,&quot;<br><br>&quot;That was much faster than I expected,&quot; PC said as he looked up from a proposed design for what would become Worhkshap&#39;s library. His eyes narrowed slightly at the uncomfortable expression on the page&#39;s face. &quot;I take it there has been some unforeseen complication.&quot;<br><br>The page withered slightly under the baron&#39;s inquisitive stare. &quot;They, ah...

Then inform the knights and my seneschal of this development. Quietly, if you please.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>&quot;What do you say?&quot;<br><br>PC stroked his beard as he leaned back slightly in his chair. As soon as he had seen the proclamation from the Council outlining his domain, he knew that the other barons would eventually approach him for trading rights. He just didn&#39;t expect the &quot;eventually&quot; to be quite so soon.<br><br>&quot;An interesting proposal,&quot; he said. &quot;Certainly one I would not be opposed to, provided I knew a bit more about this plan you have for Ozerboard&#39;s economy. I have no objections if you wish to keep the details to yourself, of course, but more specific information may help... smooth out negotiations, as it were.&quot;</p>

            <p>[... I can confirm that all the mountain ranges of Konti-Nyuum are theoretically crossable. The exception is the Wattufs, which have only one navigable pass - the Pass of the Five. The crossing of the Copperway into Ozerbord is by way of a tunnel built by Baron BeautyID to provide trade (the Iron Highway was at that point still a smuggling route - actually, we only legalised it last year!) and access to Baron Bjam&#39;s holdings - by way, in fact, of the pass your scouts are looking for. That was before the Umor Woods got out of control.]<br><br>[Of course, &#39;theoretically&#39; doesn&#39;t mean &#39;easily&#39;; the pass can be as simple or as arduous as you like. Or it may be unfindable - thus far, there&#39;s no known route over the central Larninkurvs, though Sir Ekyl of Godreve is hunting for one.]<br><br>[Also: Baron Huinesoron will have an RP response to what he views as an act of economic warfare - though it&#39;ll have to wait for tomorrow for me to write it.]<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Baron Huinesoron stepped out into the central court of castle Kwenaya and smiled as the wintry air washed over him. Across the level ground, beneath the branches of the great tree that rose from Kwenaya&#39;s heart, two of the castle staff were deep in conversation. As the baron approached, he hailed them: &quot;Rosalind! Terri! A fine morning, is it not?&quot;<br><br>The two women made their greetings - Rosalind with an awkward curtsey, Terri with a small bow. &quot;The weather is very nice,&quot; Rosalind said, &quot;though it&#39;s also nice that it&#39;s warmed a little - otherwise the Font of Bulapka would still be frozen, and that wouldn&#39;t be nice.&quot;<br><br>Baron Huinesoron noted the harpoon she was holding, and nodded in satisfaction. &quot;Your catch will be the centrepiece of our banquet,&quot; he told the castle&#39;s fisher. &quot;I trust everything is nearly prepared?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah,&quot; Rosalind said, and glanced at Terri. &quot;Well. That is to say.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron raised an eyebrow. &quot;I&#39;m waiting.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... I have fish to catch?&quot; Rosalind offered. She gave another curtsey - still clumsy, but holding a spear as long as yourself will do that - and fled. The Baron watched her go, then turned to Terri.<br><br>&quot;Is she having difficulty catching enough fish?&quot; he asked. &quot;I know winter is hardly the time for it, especially in the Font.&quot;<br><br>Terri looked faintly uncomfortable. &quot;It isn&#39;t that, milord,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s... we&#39;ve had some replies from your... guests.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah!&quot; Huinesoron beamed. &quot;The new barons! Which of them have sent word?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... all of them,&quot; Terri said. &quot;But the word is... perhaps not what you would wish.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron frowned. &quot;It will be rather difficult to change the date at this juncture,&quot; he said. &quot;Perhaps if we simply extended the festivities to cover a second day... I can help Rosalind out with the provisions myself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh.&quot; Terri&#39;s discomfort was clearly growing. She pulled out a letter and held it up. &quot;Baron PC sends his apologies,&quot; she said. &quot;His new barony will require some time to set to rights, so he will not be able to attend.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron chuckled. &quot;A pity,&quot; he said, &quot;but fair enough. Baron Phobos spent little time in the south - I can only imagine how disorganised the mines are. But what of Ba- I mean, Lady Iximaz? Critta-Kalthin, at least, can need little restructuring, after all the work we&#39;ve put into it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, milord,&quot; Terri said, switching to a second sheet. &quot;But she has announced her own feast, to celebrate the arrival of Sir Storme of Hauk and the Knight Jumper in her barony. Ah, Dark Civilian Aakmal will be providing the food.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That seems... fair,&quot; Baron Huinesoron said. &quot;Could we send a message to her, offering to combine the two feasts? We could hold a festival in Ozerbord, in celebration of the new barons.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um.&quot; Terri turned the sheet of paper over. &quot;She... appears to have reused a page from the Knight Jumper&#39;s letter to her. He is... somewhat uncomplementary about yourself and your lady wife. I... rather doubt he would attend.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see.&quot; Huinesoron pinched the bridge of his nose. &quot;Then it will be Thanasius Ampelius alone. Very well: let the invitation be extended to all who dwell in the Monastery of Spectacle, in celebration of my former knight&#39;s elevation. It shall be a banquet to-- you&#39;re giving me that look again. What did he say?&quot;<br><br>Terri opened the final sheet of paper. &quot;Machinations, conspiracy, schemes... basically, it seems he&#39;s accusing you of promoting his cause before the Council for the sole purpose of ensuring Lady Kaitlyn&#39;s appointment.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmm.&quot; Baron Huinesoron looked up at the great tree, to the pale blue sky above. &quot;Well, then, you may as well tell Rosalind she can relax; we won&#39;t be needing that fish after all. And... are our messengers in residence?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I believe so, milord,&quot; Terri said. &quot;Do you wish them sent out?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. Please send Sandra to Ofum to inform Captain mal Orn that I will be requiring the use of <i>Aberration</i>. And send Freckles to El-J-- to Barony Kaitlyn. My wife is surveying the site for her hospital; let her know that I am heading to the Marizu League, and that her companionship in arms would be greatly appreciated.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I... yes, milord.&quot; Terri hesitated a moment, then asked, &quot;Milord... what will you do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What I am best at,&quot; Baron Huinesoron said, turning on his heel. &quot;Kill the Marizu.&quot; And he stalked off towards the armoury.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>“Now this is ridiculous,” Thanasius Ampelius said, looking at his two compatriots (plus Kagemusha) and slapping the scroll on the table so it unrolled. “Barons, Knight, and civilians of Plort, yada yada, old people no longer being here, boring council stuff… ah, here it is. Fourthly, it gives me great pleasure to announce the creation of four new baronies. The Baronial Council has discussed the candidates extensively, and surveyed the feelings of the populace, and we are pleased to confer the rights, privileges, and duties of a Baron of Plort upon,” he paused and took a breath. Death Dendle chuckled under his breath. “Lady Iximaz — have we heard of her? Lady Kaitlyn — more of Eagleshadow’s politicking… Sir PC — makes sense, he’s one of the greatest men of our age… and one Thanasius Ampelius, the Warrior Monk.”<br>Thanasius got up, shot the scroll a disbelieving look, and started to pace around.<br>“Don’t tell me ambition did not stir in you when you heard that,” the body double offered from his dark corner. “I know for a fact you were busy acquiring new weapons recently.”<br>“Well yes!” Thanasius stopped in one place for a moment. “That crossbow needed repairing! Even though we found it in that despicable Marizu’s camp, it could still be used for good! And did you actually expect me to turn down a gift from Agog? That’s my home, you know!”<br>“Besides, if owning weapons correlated to political ambitions, I’d probably be spending more time in the cities,” noted Karrin the Blue, tapping her fingers against her swords.<br>“In your case, I’d check whether there’s a magpie in your family tree,” Death Dendle retorted. “You gather swords the same way Thanasius here gathers books or a magpie gathers shiny baubles.”<br>“Well, perhaps I’ll change my crest’s hummingbird to one, then,” Karrin replied drily. “In any case, we’ve gotten somewhat off topic.”<br>“True,” agreed Thanasius, who continued his pacing. “Now I’m supposed to claim a piece of land, no? And assume responsibilities… and sit in the thrice-accursed council! Look at that letter! Even July of Castle Flayme approves! I thought she didn’t think of me very highly after that argument!”<br>“Perhaps this is her revenge, then?” suggested Karrin. <br>“She didn&#39;t strike me as the underhanded type,” Death Dendle said. “In fact, quite the opposite: she’s blunt. I mean, she set sail to lands unknown some time after he left for Ydyff.” He nodded toward his master.<br>Karrin blinked. “I was joking. Did — did I not make that clear?”<br>“Apparently not,” Thanasius gave his body double a withering look. “Anyway… no, this is probably Baron Huinesoron’s doing. It’s not written in that” — he pointed at the scroll, which rolled up again — “but the rest of the missive said that his wife doesn’t actually have any voting power… just, y’know, territory. And guess where? El-Jheycom.” <br>Karrin raised an eyebrow. “Than, you do remember that I have as little knowledge of the politics of this land as a desert rabbit does of sailing, don’t you?”<br>“It’s simple, really. That was her old land… they declared independence, if I remember what I read correctly, but were absorbed back into Borrd after a while,” Thanasius said. “Anyway, my point is this: he probably wanted to throw suspicion off that move. What’s bothering me, though, is that so many people agreed… there were signatures in that other scroll — knights, citizens, the like; Skaer&#39;morys the Silver, Knight Jumper, Lady Iximaz...” he sighed and massaged his brows. “Nevermind that; it’s just my inner conspiracy theorist. Let’s see what we can do about this.”<br>Karrin peered at the missive and walked over to one of the shelves, pulling out a map and setting it on top of the table. “Hmm... The law only requires that you have lands and a castle, correct?”<br>“And council participation, but yes, that’s about it.” The monk peered at the map. “Honestly, there’s no place I’d like more than this one.” He looked up, toward the high ceiling of the central hall of Castle Spectacle. “This place has been a home to me for a long time. The valley, while small, is fertile. There are deer in the woods; there’s that little stream...”<br>“Well, it’s certainly a better idea than leaving. We’ve just gotten the libraries in order, too,” noted Karrin with a smile.<br>Death Dendle left his corner to take a look at the map. “Look at this town,” he said, pointing to a town, situated on the coast, so small that the map didn’t even have its name. “It’s pretty close, and you need a port. It could use some hustle and bustle and maybe some help. As things are, they are vulnerable to being raided by the Marizu, and the closest place they could get help from is Risersh, which is quite a distance away.”<br>Karrin the Blue examined the map. “Skypcht? It’s rather small, so you wouldn’t have to worry about too much bureaucracy. The shipping industry there’s not large, but it’s fairly resilient... I’m still surprised at how quickly they rebuilt after those storms two autumns ago.”<br>“They are good people,” the Fast Seneschal, silent until now, said. “I remember setting a forge up there after the storms hit. They are a diligent people; they started rebuilding right away.”<br>“My sort of people, then,” Thanasius decided. “I shall send the Council a reply.”<br>He picked a quill and a (mostly) empty scroll out of the general mess that covered the table. He started writing on it, muttering under his breath. “To the Council, yada yada, honorifics, blah blah, the Baron Thanasius requests the lands at the southernmost tip of Ozerbord, those surrounding the vale of the Monastery of Spectacle, and the nearby town of Skypcht,  as territory. Yada yada, officialiasms, signed, Thanasius Ampelius, Baron.” The monk paused and showed the scroll to the others. “What do you think?”<br>Karrin nodded. “It certainly looks official.” She smiled slightly. “Hm... As the Seneschal and myself live here, should we swear allegiance or somesuch?”<br>“That would probably help later down the road,” Thanasius said. “Plus, I’d need someone to tell me when I’m doing stupid things, no? You two helped me a lot, and I’d hate to be forced to evict you because of some stupid bureaucratic rule.”<br>“Well, I’d hate to be evicted, so that works.” Karrin picked out another scroll and began to write. “Hm-de-hm, officially swear fealty and allegiance to the Baron Thanasius, blah-blah will pay taxes and reside in territories, signed Karrin the Blue, Mage.” She blew on the ink carefully. <br>The Seneschal took the scroll Death Dendle was trying to hit his head with and quickly scribbled something on it, spreading sand on it to dry the ink. Thanasius took a look above his shoulder and <i>hmm</i>ed.<br>“That’ll do. I hope the vultures at the Council won’t eat us alive for the slightly informal phrasing.” The monk rolled the scrolls up and looked at his Kagemusha. “You’ll be the messenger.”<br>“I hear and obey.”<br></p>

            <p>[If you&#39;re confused over the timeline - Baron Me was originally <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=268099;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">heading to Ofum</a>. Then Freckles caught him and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=268155;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">diverted him to Barony PC</a>. Then he <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=268156;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">returned home by way of Barony Iximaz</a>. And now he&#39;s riding south to Barony Thanasius Ampelius.]<br><br>The Copperway was quiet as Baron Huinesoron and his secretary rode south. &quot;This is a taste of things to come,&quot; Huinesoron mused.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not that bad, milord,&quot; Terri said. &quot;Baron PC will get the trade network started up again in no time, and the Copperway is still the best route to the western baronies.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But not to Borrd,&quot; Huinesoron said. &quot;We&#39;ve been suffering since the opening of the Iron Highway to legitimate travel; now we&#39;ll lose even more traffic to the Barnacle Way. And the people of Ozerbord will suffer, mark my word - unless we can pull this off.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes...&quot; Terri looked across at the baron. &quot;Milord... I would feel much more comfortable if you&#39;d brought Freckles with you. Baron Thanasius Ampelius may not be... feeling kindly disposed towards you, and I am no warrior.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I needed Freckles to bring Sandra and Kaitlyn home,&quot; Huinesoron explained. &quot;Besides, despite his elevation, Baron Ampelius is still a citizen of Ozerbord; he will not lightly attack the Lord Protector.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, it&#39;s not like that would grant him <i>de facto</i> independence or anything,&quot; Terri muttered, but she knew better than to pursue the argument. Once the baron&#39;s mind was set, it was set.<br><br>~<br><br>When Thanasius Ampelius found him, Baron Huinesoron was standing on the outskirts of Skypcht, looking up at the newest sky-ship the town had completed. &quot;They are truly remarkable,&quot; Huinesoron said, not looking round. &quot;The magics which keep them aloft are beyond my understanding, but I can tell that you&#39;ve already seen their potential far more clearly than I ever did.&quot;<br><br>The baron shook himself and gestured to his secretary, then looked at Thanasius. &quot;But if I have been lacking in vision,&quot; he said, &quot;at least my hindsight is excellent. As is my economics advice - I know, for instance, that these ships are highly expensive to construct and run. The magics involved, the relatively large size needed to get everything to work - or fit, for that matter! - the requirement for a mage to be on every crew... please don&#39;t think I&#39;m slighting them, they are truly magnificent, but they are hardly suited for short-range, high-frequency transport.<br><br>&quot;And so, for the good of Ozerbord and both our baronies, I propose an... alliance, I suppose, or agreement.&quot; Huinesoron gestured north, towards the distant Batveg Mountains. &quot;In the north, on the Spalchik Lowlands, I am expanding the town of Emaille. There, I intend to construct my own flying ships - not the magic-powered variety you are working on, but lighter-than-air ships. They are slower, and more prone to being thrown off-course by the wind - but they are also far cheaper, and far quicker to construct.<br><br>&quot;You could, of course, try to compete with me. You might even manage to claim the entire trade - the Skypcht industry is established, while Emaille&#39;s is new. But all that will achieve is to reduce the income Ozerbord can receive. If, instead, we work together, letting our two styles of sky-ship complement, not confront, each other... everyone will end up richer, and the rest of Konti-Nyuum will receive a better service.<br><br>&quot;So, Baron Thanasius Ampelius - what do you say?&quot;<br><br>hS<br><br>[Of course, it&#39;s a bit silly that Skype is sending messages long before Email - but we can allow a bit of timeline trickery in the service of plot, or of Plort. ;)]</p>

            <p>The new baron&#39;s cowled head moved hither and thither as he observed the town. A commoner, bearing the stylised skyship symbol of Skypcht on a small armband, arrived and brought him a scroll, then retreated to allow the barons to converse privately.<br>Thanasius opened the scroll, read it, and wordlessly presented it to Huinesoron. It was an offer of alliance, signed by the King of Ydyff.<br>“Rumours travel fast, it would seem.” Slowly, the monk removed his cowl, revealing a bald head whose features slightly resembled those of a raven – there was something in the shining eyes, long nose and curious expression. His hands, too, somewhat resembled a raven&#39;s claws. He turned and glared at Huinesoron. “I will be frank.” A small pause. “I dislike your politicking. I dislike your methods. What&#39;s more, I dislike uninvited visitors – one could say that this is an act of spying, and Protector you may be, but this is not a matter of... national security, shall we say?”<br>Thanasius looked back toward the town. “However, I have a responsibility to those people. Would cut-throat competition help them? Maybe. Maybe not. Would cooperation – a cartel, in essence – help them? In the short run, certainly. In the long run, I am not so sure.”<br>The monk put his cowl back up. “This is not something I can answer right away. Despite your... lack of manners, showing up like that, I will not spit on my people&#39;s sacred traditions. Come with me to Spectacle, so we may dine in peace. I will talk with my friends, consult the relevant tomes, and you may take a break from your journeying.”<br>Inwardly, the monk smiled bitterly. How would the Baron answer that – would he, figuratively speaking, enter the lion&#39;s den, or would he risk offending Thanasius, who no doubt had a force of magi nearby, and was rumoured to be quite the warrior himself?<br><br>[And the politicking thickens!]</p>

            <p>&quot;Hm.&quot; Baron Huinesoron looked over his shoulder. &quot;Terri? The Constitution, if you please.&quot;<br><br>Wordlessly, the secretary pulled a scroll out of its case and handed it to the baron. Unfurling it, Baron Huinesoron held it up for Thanasius to see.<br><br>&quot;You appear to be under certain misapprehensions as to the nature of your position,&quot; Huinesoron said, his voice level and clear. &quot;You are a Baron of the Union of Plort - a military leader. You have the authority to lead the people of your barony in the war against the Marizu however you see fit, and the responsibility to defend them from attack by our enemies in Weab. You have the right and duty to collect taxes and tribute in the name of the Baronial Council, and of your own barony, and to dispose of them as you see fit. All these things, Baron Thanasius Ampelius, you appear to be doing admirably, and I commend you.<br><br>&quot;What you are not is a ruler, or governor, or any manner of civilian administrator. You have no right to conclude alliances. You have no authority over the people of Ozerbord except in terms of the war. And you do <i>not</i>,&quot; he finished, fixing the monk with a glare, &quot;have the authority to declare the Lord Protector of Ozerbord a spy, nor to say what is or is not his concern. For the protection of Ozerbord against famine, against sickness, and against all internal threats, <i>I rule this land</i>.<br><br>&quot;The Refuge of Ozerbord is of far greater import than your pride - it is the bastion of Plort, our last stronghold in the event of a Marizu invasion. The Marizu <i>will</i> assault us again; you may count on that. And when they do, the Wattufs will once again stand as a wall between the people of Konti-Nyuum and the urple hordes.&quot;<br><br>Baron Huinesoron looked up at the ships overhead, swinging through their graceful orbits over Skypcht. &quot;You may build your ships,&quot; he said, &quot;and dispose of them as you see fit; despite your <i>dislike</i> of my policies, the Refuge has never restricted free trade or the movement of goods. But if your actions bring harm to the people of Ozerbord, know this, Baron: I take my title <i>very</i> seriously. I <i>will</i> protect them - you have my word.&quot;<br><br>With that, the Lord Protector turned on his heel and, with Terri hurrying to keep up, strode off towards his grazing horse.<br><br>~~~~~<br><br>[Baron Huinesoron has never been very comfortable with politicking. ^_^ And <i>Lord Protector</i> Huinesoron doesn&#39;t take kindly to people usurping his authority.]<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>“Baron Huinesoron, apparently,” noted the cowled monk, “cannot read. Excuse me – I need to catch up with him before he does something rash.”<br>Thanasius Ampelius took a running start and leapt, covering the ground between him and the departing Baron in a single bound. Oddly enough, for a moment – when he was at the apex of his leap – he seemed to briefly become like a giant raven; that might just have been his cloak, though.<br>“Baron.” The black-clad monk barred Huinesoron&#39;s way. “You insult me and King Gantz of Ydyff with your hasty action. Read the scroll again.” He shoved it into his hands. “<i>I</i> did not send that scroll. It bears the Royal Seal of Ydyff, not the Raven Volant. Furthermore” – his eyes narrowed – “you insult me by rejecting my hospitality and by implying that I would let the people here come to harm. Being the Lord Protector does not grant you the right to treat the Knights of the land as though they are common serfs.”</p>

            <p>&quot;But <i>I will not.</i>&quot; Huinesoron shook his head. &quot;If we are to speak of insults - you insult my intelligence by attempting to... <i>imply</i> that you were not suggesting you were considering such an alliance. As for the rest - an attempt to set yourself above the authority of the duly appointed governor of the realm, as you have done by asserting that I was <i>spying</i>, will most definitely harm the people of your barony - and all of Plort.&quot;<br><br>Baron Huinesoron swept out his arm, taking in the heights of the Wattufs that towered over them, and all the lands beyond. &quot;Ours is a land under threat. The Marizu plot endlessly to bring us to ruin. We <i>cannot</i> afford the kind of internal discord you seem intent on provoking - the Union is not strong enough to withstand it.<br><br>&quot;You are a Baron of Plort, over a realm you have yourself selected.&quot; Huinesoron drew a deep breath, and fought down the urge to continue with &#39;For Kanun&#39;s sake, act like one&#39;. Fanning the flames was not the way to go. &quot;You are... correct that you deserve the respect due your office. Therefore, out of... respect for the pressures that must be on you as you work to establish your barony, I will remove the person of the Lord Protector from your domains.&quot; He flashed the briefest possible smile. &quot;No-one wants the management breathing down their necks, I am sure. And if, when your <i>rightful</i> authority,&quot; he placed the slightest stress on the word, &quot;has been fully recognised among the people of your charge, you wish to extend your hospitality to the Lord Protector or to Baron Huinesoron, I - wearing whichever hat is appropriate - will be happy to accept.&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Thanasius grabbed his forehead. “I hate politics,” he mumbled to himself, then straightened. “Och, time to cut the knot.” He smiled – a crooked affair that didn&#39;t quite reach his eyes. “I know the Marizu are out there.”<br>The monk lifted his hand, letting the heavy sleeve of his robes fall down and reveal a bony arm. Roughly halfway between the elbow and the hand the pale flesh was covered in scar tissue. “This would remind me, if I would forget. My friends&#39; pain would. The broken shards of my axe would.”<br>He looked back toward Skypcht. “Those people would; they have suffered many a raid.” He sighed like an old man many years his senior would. “I would never <i>dream</i> about doing anything that would strengthen the Marizu. Have I considered that alliance? Yes, I&#39;d be a liar if I&#39;d have said otherwise. Would have I acted on my own? Yechnagoth, no. I might dislike visitors” – a brief glare – “but despite what you might think, I&#39;m not dense. I know the rules as well as the next man. Though, frankly, there is much to gain from that alliance and little to lose. Have you ever seen a Ydyffan warrior-poet in battle? I have, and they are magnificent.”<br>A wistful look crossed Thanasius&#39; face. “I remember the King&#39;s standard flying proud over the advance of the Ciforrae, signifying that none may stand in their way and live to tell the tale.”</p>

            <p>One hand on his horse&#39;s bridle, Baron Huinesoron half-turned. He held Thanasius&#39; gaze for a long time, his eyes betraying nothing. Then, at last, he nodded slightly.<br><br>&quot;I believe you,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;You will serve Konti-Nyuum well.&quot; And with no more farewell than that, he swung himself up onto his horse and rode off towards the north.<br><br>~<br><br>Ye merciful gods above, I hate the feudal system.<br><br>Politics in Plort is a complicated subject. In Borrd, the barons are the government, by way of the Baronial Council. In Wechi, she&#39;s completely separate, though an influential voice. In Iric, it&#39;s a similar situation, though at least one baron is also a member of the government.<br><br>In Ozerbord, though? Up until this week, the only baron was also the head of government; all civilian and military power was in one set of hands. That means Ozerbord never really bothered to notice the difference between the Baron and the Protector; in fact, that&#39;s the reason for the former tax havens, where Borrd law and Ozerbord clashed.<br><br>Now, at least, the havens are mostly gone. But there are now two barons in Ozerbord - a place where the people are used to thinking of the baron as the government.<br><br>So it&#39;s a feudal system of sorts: a setup where the baron (that&#39;s Thanasius) tries to claim as much authority as he can get away with, while the Protector (Huinesoron) tries to keep hold of it. Which way the balance will swing on any given day depends on the people of Barony Thanasius Ampelius, for the most part.<br><br>And one weapon in that political war is stating your case over-strongly. I have no clear idea where the line between baron and Protector lies in the structure of Ozerbord - and I suspect Baron Me doesn&#39;t, either. He&#39;s making claims, and if he can get them to stick, they&#39;ll become the foundation of Ozerbord&#39;s future political system.<br><br>Yeah. I hate the feudal system. And politics. Especially politics.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>To the Baroness Iximaz,<br><br>Great congratulations on your appointment as Baron. While I was in training at the time of my initial support for your selection, I have come now to pledge my fealty and tax to you, as well as, of course, my assistance in any raids you would wish to carry out against the Marizu. As this finds you, I am probably already en route to the newly established Keep De&#39;endee, so a letter back would likely not find me, but I will of course leave again if you want me to do so.<br><br>I hope this finds you well,<br><br>Knight Ion<br><br><br><br>[Agents can be items other than weapons, right? Because I&#39;m getting the feeling Ginger would be a horse.]</p>

            <p>was gently rolled up and placed on the table. Lady Iximaz smiled to herself. She had overseen part of the new knight&#39;s training herself, and the girl showed promise.<br><br>Of course, that meant yet another person she would have to add to the list of banquet guests, which was growing at an alarming rate. Overseeing the preparations was much more stressful than she&#39;d anticipated.<br><br>&quot;And I suppose this is easy, compared to all the other duties I will have to learn,&quot; she muttered to herself. She put her head in her hands. <i>If only Baron Huinesoron&#39;s invitation came a day earlier,</i> she thought. <i>Then all I would have to worry about would be traveling to his castle...</i> She sighed and headed down to the kitchens to inform the cooks to plan for another guest.</p>

            <p>His lord was sitting at the tavern&#39;s table, grumbling over his ale. While this was a rather common occurrence, the fact it was several hours before noon was unusual. &quot;Ser?&quot; he asked, cautiously stepping towards the knight. &quot;Are you well?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Blargh.&quot; The knight sloshed his drink in the general direction of the boy. &quot;Weeks. Weeks spent in this Six-forsaken city, waiting for some word from those barons!&quot; He grumbled, as he took another swig of ale. &quot;Here I am, giving words, supporting Iximaz and the Cynic, and waiting for something, and they just leave me here. I have work to do! I have...have swords to sharpen, shields to hammer, ships to carve...mead to drink.&quot;<br><br>Tristram sighed. &quot;I thought you liked Plort?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I do!&quot; Jumper grumbled. &quot;I just like the open fields more. All of these... Bricks. It&#39;s unnatural.&quot;<br><br>Tristram was about to object, when a messenger came in to the tavern. &quot;Is the knight Jumper here?&quot;<br><br>Jumper did not look at the new person, but pointed his mug toward the voice. &quot;&#39;ere. What do you want?&quot;<br><br>The messenger slipped a piece of parchment in front of the knight. &quot;From the Barons.&quot; Without another word, the messenger turned to leave.<br><br>Jumper stared at the parchment. &quot;About time,&quot; he mumbled, as he read the message. &quot;Barons, keeps...Blah, where&#39;s the news...Ah! Here! &#39;Fourthly, it gives me great pleasure to announce the creation of four new baronies.&#39;&quot; Jumper sat up, pouring all of his attention to the announcement. &quot;All four? Truly?&quot;<br><br>Tristram edged over, reading over it himself. &quot;Seems so. Din&#39;t you speak &#39;gainst Kaitlyn?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That I did. And yet, she has her barony anyways.&quot; He growled. &quot;Lockes herself in Huinesoron&#39;s castle these last few years, doing nothing for the people, and now she has her own vote in the council.&quot; He snarled. &quot;I have no doubt Huinesoron managed it. He has the other barons under his thumb. With her in there, now, his power is even greater. Hmph.&quot;<br><br>Tristram read closer. &quot;Look &#39;ere!&quot; he cried, pointing at a later passage. &quot;Sais &#39;ere she can&#39;t vote. She ain&#39;t a proper baron.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmmm... So it is. Perhaps there is some sense in the barons after all.&quot; Jumper stood, tossing some bits out of his purse towards the barman. &quot;Well, boy, it seems we have some work to do.&quot;<br><br>Tristram scrambled to attention, ready for his lord&#39;s new orders. &quot;What do we need to do, ser?&quot;<br><br>&quot;First, I must write to the lady Iximaz. She has her lands now, and I swore to assist in settling them. I need to see where my new castle will be anyway.&quot; He turned to the boy. &quot;You, gather the horses promised to the Cynic, and deliver them for me. Stay with him until I send word to you. Can you manage that?&quot;<br><br>Tristram nodded vigorously. &quot;Yes ser! I&#39;ll be right onnit, ser!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good! Now, off with you!&quot; As the boy scampered off, Jumper glanced out the windows towards the sea. He could imagine the herds of horses running in the fields far, far from the tavern, with Bronne riders alongside, singing the Hymns of the Six. No longer would those feilds be his life. He would have to be serious about his duties as a knight, as a citizen of Plort. &quot;A keep,&quot; he muttered, thinking to himself. &quot;I shall need a keep. And stables.&quot; He slunk back down on his stool, tossing more bits on the counter. &quot;I need a cider first.&quot;<br><br>[Basically, Jumper&#39;s moving to Iximaz&#39;s lands as well. She should be expecting him. He brings everything he had overseas with him, save the horses he promised to PC. I will deside on the keep&#39;s name later.]</p>

            <p>Hear now, the tale of Lady Iximaz, wanderer of Weab, protector of Plort, and champion of Jaikaiar.<br><br>For many years, Iximaz was but a simple citizen of Fanvik-Neht, unconcerned with the rumors of the growing threat of the Marizu. She was content to pass her days listening to tales of exotic lands, and though she often wondered what it would be like to travel, she had no need to leave.<br><br>One day, however, it came to pass that a stranger to whom she had given refuge revealed herself to be a Marizu when she destroyed Iximaz&#39;s hometown. Iximaz fled Fanvik-Neht in shame, leaving behind her home and causing her to question all she thought she knew. <br><br>Forced into the wild and unforgiving lands of Weab, Iximaz learned to fight for her survival. She traveled the continent, occasionally finding refuge among the people of Bronee or the Potters&#39; Moore.<br><br>After many months, Iximaz found herself in the land of Tivit. Here, she first heard the tales of the land of Plort and the brave knights who fought the Marizu. Inspired by these stories, she traveled to the island, where she was welcomed like a long-lost friend. She made a new home in the shining city of Borrd and made an effort to learn their laws and customs.<br><br>As she became familiar with the city, she found herself going to the knights and asking to hear more tales of their triumphs, and her desire to join their ranks grew ever stronger. At last, she steeled her courage and went to the Barons of Plort and asked to train as another warrior.<br><br>Baron Huinesoron pondered her request. &quot;Though it is still too early to be certain,&quot; he said, &quot;from what I can tell, you show promise. I shall grant you permission to train as a knight.&quot; And thus, he bestowed upon her the title of Lady.<br><br>Her weapons in her early years as a knight were simple, a sword named Randa and a bow named Rina. Why she chose these names is unknown; rumors abound as to their origins. Some say Rina is Lady Iximaz&#39;s true name; others say that Randa was named after a very dear friend. Regardless of how the weapons were named, the sword Randa was unfortunately lost in battle, and for a brief time, Lady Iximaz halted her crusades against the Marizu while she searched for a suitable replacement. At long last, she found one: Zeb, a sword forged in the distant land of Pokhemmon, imbued with magic so that it crackled with lightning. Satisfied with her new blade, she resumed her fight once more.<br><br>It was near this time that she was appointed Baroness, and she built her castle De&#39;endee on the northern coast of Borrd, high on a cliff overlooking the sea. It was small, as castles go, really more of a keep, but it served as a safe haven for all who requested asylum, and it contained a vast library devoted entirely to the ancient art of Arpying. While not away fighting Marizu, there she resided, managing her barony to the best of her ability.<br><br>For years to come, Lady Iximaz rode forth, her banner held high, spreading the teachings of Jaikaiar and driving away the menaces of the Marizu.</p>

            <p>My agents hardly know the meaning of the word. However...<br><br><b>Gall</b> might choose Pandora for the opportunity for some serious high-flying action. Fellrazer would come too, of course, disguised as a Banshee. She might try to convince whoever&#39;s providing the disguises to make him a Great Leonopteryx, but since she&#39;s dragging <b>Derik</b> along, he&#39;ll make sure that doesn&#39;t happen. It would attract too much attention.<br><br><b>Jenni</b> might take Henry to visit the Wizarding World, but they&#39;d probably have to stay away from Hogwarts itself. There&#39;s no explaining the presence of a six-year-old there, and she wouldn&#39;t have him disguised as anything else since he&#39;s so young. Still, there&#39;s always Diagon Alley.<br><br><b>Ilraen</b> would be happy to go anywhere with open grasslands. He might choose Narnia and try being one of those centaurs that people are always comparing him to. He might enjoy studying astronomy with them, too.<br><br><b>Nume</b> would choose Gallifrey. Then he would gank a TARDIS and go wherever and whenever the hell he wants to. Psych! ... But he&#39;d probably just go looking for lost texts to read. Library of Alexandria, anyone?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Doc - Narnia.  Like me, Doc has a interesting soft spot for Narnia as an especially pure and moral world.  (Even though we only read the series in high school, believe it or not.)<br><br>Dream choice: The nameless club at 249B East Thirty-Fifth Street from &quot;A Winter&#39;s Tale: The Breathing Method.&quot; (A.k.a, the one novella from <i>Different Seasons</i> not turned into a movie yet.)  It&#39;s a club where people meet to tell stories, but it&#39;s also said to have many &quot;rooms and corridors . . . <i>entrances and exits</i>.&quot;  Sounds like a great place to get lost!<br><br>Vania - Probably Asgard, out of these choices.  Games and musicals are Vania&#39;s thing, so none of these would leap out at her, but Asgard&#39;s interesting blended science/magic would be intriguing to her.<br><br>Dream choice: Right now, probably Twilight Town, to try some sea salt ice cream.  Maybe she would try some of the odd jobs that appeared as mini games in <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>.  And finally find out what that beach looks like!  Later on in my spin-off, Vania will get introduced to <i>Lost</i>, which will probably become her dream vacation.<br><br>Yoof - Definitely the Hogwarts kitchens.<br><br>Dream choice: Probably that diner in <i>Spaceballs</i>, in hopes of meeting Barf in person (while scoring a meal).<br><br>Sйverine - She would probably go to somewhere Elf-inhabited in Middle-earth and try to learn to make proper lembas.<br><br>Millie and Olsen/Mollie and Ollie - Hm.  None of these places are Disney (no, Narnia and Asgard do not count).  I could see them going to Hogwarts in a (doomed) attempt to learn magic to replace the kind Millie has lost without her brush.</p>

            <p>The Chinese woman looked at Angus from across the Cafeteria table they shared. &quot;It&#39;s a PPC travel brochure that I managed to find under some mouldy paperwork in Personnel,&quot; she said as she handed the document to her coworker. &quot;I think it&#39;s supposed to convince the newbies that maybe, just <i>maybe</i> this place isn&#39;t a total pit of despair.&quot;<br><br>Beside her, Nasir sighed and rolled his eyes. &quot;Given the fact that you found this by digging under some abandoned crud... well, I don&#39;t think this thing lasted very long.&quot;<br><br>Penny shrugged. &quot;Iunno, but it&#39;s still pretty to look at.&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, Angus was examining the brochure. &quot;Well, let&#39;s see... oh, the Hogwarts one looks nice. If the trip also included Hogsmeade I&#39;d take Sophie to Honeydukes and buy her some candy...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ooh, sounds lovely,&quot; said Penny. &quot;There&#39;s nothing on this list that really grabs my attention-- I&#39;m not part of any of these fandoms-- but I wouldn&#39;t mind a trip to Middle-earth. Shire, here I come!&quot;<br><br>Nasir pointed at the brochure. &quot;Hey Angus, may I have a look at that?&quot;<br><br>The blond man passed the travel guide to his Arabic coworker. &quot;Yeah, no problem man. Actually,&quot; he turned to Penny, &quot;a trip to Gallifrey wouldn&#39;t be so bad.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s got to get unstuck from that pocket dimension first, though,&quot; sighed Penny. &quot;Hah! To think that ten-ish years ago we could actually go there. It&#39;s funny how things change, eh?&quot;<br><br>Both of her coworkers muttered sounds of agreement. Nasir looked up from the brochure and asked: &quot;Where is Panem? It looks like some American city but... I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, I think it&#39;s a nation in the <i>Hunger Games</i> &#39;verse if I remember correctly,&quot; said Angus, scratching his chin. &quot;Y&#39;know, the young-adult-dystopian-future-kill-people-for-sport novel?&quot;<br><br>Penny arched an eyebrow. &quot;Another <i>Battle Royale</i> copycat? What is it with all of these authors and shoving teens into an arena to fight to the death? Did they never grow out of their gladiator phase or something?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a thing?&quot; said Nasir.<br><br>The Chinese agent made a vague waving gesture with her hand. &quot;Whatever. You know what I mean. So! Where do <i>you</i> want to go?&quot;<br><br>Nasir looked at the brochure again. &quot;Hm... I&#39;ve always had a thing for floating islands and stuff. I&#39;ll take Pandora: those airborne landmasses are like a poor man&#39;s Sanctaphrax but oh well.&quot;<br><br>Angus checked his watch. &quot;Fifteen minutes of break time left, guys. Shall we?&quot;<br><br>Penny and Nasir gathered their trays of food and stood up. &quot;Let&#39;s roll,&quot; said Penny. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to go and read some more badfic while surrounded by a bunch of weeping, sleep-deprived adults!&quot;<br><br>&quot;If only I shared your enthusiasm,&quot; said Nasir as the group left the table.</p>

            <p>I think Xericka and Gremlin would visit either Asgard or Gallifrey.

            <p>Are you going somewhere with this, or is it just for fun?<br><br>That being said, my agents are probably sick of Hogwarts by this point, and will be sick of Olympus and possibly Gallifrey and Narnia by the time I&#39;m through with them. And Panem just sounds dangerous.<br><br>So I&#39;ll go with Middle-earth. I&#39;m sorry to say that, even though I&#39;ve read the books a few times, I don&#39;t know the continuum well enough to do a mission in there, so my agents won&#39;t be going there anytime soon. And since I&#39;m rereading the series now, I&#39;m feeling hobbitish today. Off to the Shire! Wait, scratch that— off to OFUM!</p>

            <p>Agent Miah and Cali would go to Asgard. Kelok and Unger to Gallifrey, and Carry Onin to Pandora. All of them chosen because those have some similarity to either their origin or where they work a lot, but is not where they originated or work a lot.<br><br>(Also, Asgard would be my top choice!)</p>

We&#39;ve got a recruit!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t think any more kids were turning four for a couple of months,&quot; Dagger said, tapping at the console to pull up the latest list from the Nursery. &quot;Did they pull a kid out of a badfic somewhere?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not <i>that</i>, silly sausage,&quot; Maly said. &quot;A <b>recruit.</b> To the <b>department</b>.&quot;<br><br>Dagger swung around in her chair and stared at her partner. &quot;To <i>Out-of-Character Hobbits</i>?&quot; she demanded.<br><br>&quot;Mm-yep!&quot; Maly beamed. &quot;The Authoritative Elanor called me in to say that some chick called Math-thrower or something is moving in with us, due to &#39;the increased demand caused by the release of the new movies&#39;.

She&#39;s moving <i>in</i> with <i>us</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... you have got to be kidding.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nope!&quot; There was a knock on the door, and Maly bounced over to it. &quot;What do you reckon - is that her, or is it her new bed?

I have to ask, because I&#39;m not a native speaker, and I&#39;m trying to learn grammar and punctuation. To me, <i>Gloom watched him retreat, and shut the bathroom door</i> looks like Gloom watched Carry retreat, and than she shut the bathroom door.

I know it isn&#39;t a good name for someone who was supposed to be from Rohan, but their entire region was uncanon, and they actually knew very little about the real Rohan. <br><br>Carry treats Nico as a son, although he was described as a brother in the mission. There&#39;ll be more backstory on how they got from badfic rescues to Agent living with child in future stories. <br><br>Maethrowen was originally Glбclya from that fic.

            <p>And your source wasn&#39;t exactly wrong, but wasn&#39;t right either; the Noldorin <i>maeth</i>, refers more to a fight or a small brawl between a small amount of people, rather than an actual &quot;battle&quot;; not exactly the word someone would use for name, and even <b>if</b> was used, the name would be <i>&quot;Maethwen&quot;</i><br><br><i>Authwen</i> (&quot;War/Battle Maiden&quot;) and <i>Dagrwen</i> (&quot;Battle Maiden&quot;), although not exactly names an <i>elleth</i> would use; are closer to that meaning, if your were seeking for a name with that meaning.</p>

            <p><i>Maethor</i> is Sindarin (presumably Noldorin, but Ardalambion doesn&#39;t specify well) for &#39;warrior&#39;. So <i>Maethorwen</i> is a perfectly good name meaning &#39;Warrior Woman&#39;. Not a terribly creative name for a child, but then again, neither is &#39;Man-Woman&#39; (hi, Galadriel!), or &#39;Elf-Man&#39; (hi, Elladan!).<br><br>Maedhwen would definitely fit the character, who&#39;s described like this:<br><br><i>A young elf, probably a few years, as in a hundred or so, older that her walked up.

Eva couldn&#39;t even take her eyes off her.</i><br><br>But she also gets quite violent, so Maethorwen would work, too. Hmm... since I&#39;ve adopted her, I&#39;ll have to read her origin mission and find out who she is. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Glacyla, as she was then known:<br><br>-5&#39;9&#39;&#39;, which means she&#39;s <i>not</i> Noldorin, and probably not Vanyarin either; she&#39;s a Teler of some description.<br>-Blonde, which might suggest she&#39;s related to Thranduil in some way (though not closely), or Haldir (ditto).<br>-Green eyes. <i>Emerald</i> green eyes, which is unfortunate. Put that down to her being a badfic character.<br>-Looks about 120... but she&#39;s an elf, and I doubt Eva has any skill in judging these things. It&#39;s not like she was looking into her eyes or anything.<br>-Has &#39;cold&#39; eyes.<br>-Has a violent streak.<br>-Is quite clearly under the influence of the Voice of Saruman. That implies... what? Saruman never became openly evil, so he&#39;s not going about kidnapping elves. Perhaps she was a member of his staff, before he turned to Sauron, and never got a chance to leave.<br><br>Did Isengard <i>have</i> a household staff? It&#39;s hard to imagine Saruman cooking his own meals, bleaching his own robes, running his own forges and the like, and we know he wouldn&#39;t have been using orcs before the War of the Ring (because he&#39;s not thick). So perhaps, yes, he had elves on the staff. I can&#39;t really imagine him trusting Men, though he certainly <i>used</i> them.<br><br>And what sort of elf would he want to... employ, for want of a better word? One from Eregion, who might know something about ring-lore. Yet Glawhatsit was being used as a housemaid, which means she <i>didn&#39;t</i> know about rings.<br><br>Okay, then. She was born in Eregion to parents out of either Lorien or Doriath (in both cases, having come to Eregion with Galadriel and Celeborn). Her blonde hair and unusual light eyes got her named <i>Maedhwen</i>, &#39;the pale maiden&#39;. When she grew up, she became a warrior, and chose the name <i>Maethorwen</i> - because it sounds like her original name, so she was sure she&#39;d respond to it.<br><br>She fought against Sauron&#39;s forces during the fall of Eregion, and was one of the survivors who managed to retreat to Imladris. When Numenorean aid drove Sauron back, she moved to Lindon - she wanted to live somewhere with a decent population (ie, not Imladris), and <i>didn&#39;t</i> want to live under tree cover (ie, not Lorien).<br><br>She fought in the War of the Last Alliance in Gil-Galad&#39;s host, and acquitted herself well. When the Noldor began to quit Middle-earth, she remained in Mithlond, and (when not guarding the city) became an adequate shipbuilder under Cirdan.<br><br>She was present in the city when Saruman&#39;s ship arrived, and despite not knowing who or what he was - he just looked like an elderly mortal - she sensed something in him: a power and skill of Craft which she hadn&#39;t seen since the glory days of Eregion. Of course, Saruman was heading east, so she could do little but watch him go.<br><br>Over a thousand years later, he returned: still looking old and worn, but with his inner power if possible even stronger. Maethorwen accompanied Cirdan to the formation of the White Council, though of course she wasn&#39;t privy to its discussions; but afterwards she offered her service to Saruman. He, already coming up with his own plans, accepted; and when, 300 years later, he took possession of Isengard, Maethorwen went with him.<br><br>From Saruman&#39;s perspective, she was something of an experiment: he was annoyed that the Eldar didn&#39;t succumb to his manipulations and his voice very easily, so he used Maethorwen to test the long-term effects of it. As it turned out, this was a reasonable success - by a combination of flattery, demeaning comments, and magic, Maethorwen ended up doing whatever Saruman wanted, though not always very happily. She mostly hid her anger and disappointment, coming across as emotionless and cold. But when she let it get out, she was still a force to be reckoned with.<br><br>I think that&#39;s a decent backstory to account for her presence in the badfic, and means she doesn&#39;t have to be yet another &#39;hey, pick a name for yourself&#39; character. Good! Welcome to the DOOCH, Maedhwen Maethorwen.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That is, as I understand it, Tolkien originally intended Sindarin to be the language spoken by the Noldor, so he calls it Noldorin in earlier texts.

            <p>The problem is that Tolkien kept developing his languages, so Noldorin and Sindarin are different - despite being the &#39;same&#39; language in terms of the Legendarium. Similarly, Quenya and the older Qenya are the &#39;same&#39; language - but they&#39;re completely incompatible.<br><br>And of course, the same applies <i>within</i> the languages. &#39;Quenya&#39; - even Quenya post-dating LotR - kept changing as Tolkien came up with new ideas or tweaked old ones. Any consistent Eldarin language is a construct, taking old words and structures and splicing them into new ones, tweaking them to fit.<br><br>(And just for fun: I understand &#39;Sindar&#39; is a Quenya word. ^_^ Figure that one out.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Marvin would be flustered. He would probably try to back out of the situation, as he would not quite know how to handle it. Then again, if the lover was persistent, he would eventually cave and try to treat her as best as he can.<br><br>For Printworthy, it would depend on if she was an equine or not. If she was a pony, he would return the compliment, and offer her a nice night out, to try and know her better. If she was not, however, he would be courteous and thankful for their admiration, but respectfully deny any shared feelings towards them. He is a pony, see, and just does not think of other creatures in that way. Non-pony equines would be on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>Jumper would just laugh, perhaps flirt a little, then offer to take them on an adventure.

            <p>Doc pretty much wouldn&#39;t notice for a long time.

Urm.  I still don&#39;t have a very clear idea of her sexuality or romantic nature.  I think it&#39;s because I lack those things, that I&#39;m having difficulty picking up on hers.  Nothing feels right so far, so I don&#39;t really have an answer for her.  Maybe I&#39;ll figure it out as I write her more.<br><br>Carline&#39;s thing is that she lusts after obscure characters.  Not totally sure how that would apply to PPC characters.  She either would have no interest for anyone from HQ, or she would only be interested in folks from the less common divisions and departments, like the DOOCH or Finance.  Being a Sue at heart, her lust is reserved fro canon characters.</p>

Crooked nose, cystic acne and scars all over his face and shoulders, mixed-race, long history of being kicked/punched/robbed/swirlied at school, and hates himself with the intensity of a billion exploding O-class stars. He&#39;s decided that he&#39;s better off not bothering anybody-- and besides, if someone <i>was</i> into him by now she&#39;d have <a href="http://xkcd.com/642/">shown interest</a> or something.

Couldn&#39;t understand if a woman was flirting with him, no matter how hard she&#39;d try. Did she compliment his looks? Why yes, he is having a pretty good hair day today. Did she just give him a box of chocolates and her RC number? Oh, that&#39;s nice: she just wants a chat. Did she grab him by the collar and yell out a confession of love to him? She must be tired and stressed out: take a nap, he says. You&#39;ll feel better. Repeat ad nauseam.<br><br>Penny: She&#39;d be extremely flattered but would have to turn her would-be suitor down because she&#39;s already in a stable long-term relationship with...<br><br>Nasir: ...who would very bluntly say no to anybody who&#39;d approach him because he&#39;s with Penny.<br><br>Yakov: He&#39;d jump right into romance-mode.

            <p>Well, Cali is in a long term relationship with Cadmar (written by Caddy-shack), and Cali was the one who first had the interest. If it was anyone else, he would blush and stammer and not know what to do. He still does a lot of that with Cadmar (at least as of the last time they appeared in 2012). They are totally still dating in 2015, though.<br><br>Agent Miah...I really don&#39;t know. She&#39;s not particularly interested in sex or relationships, so it would maybe depend on the person.<br><br>Kelok is asexual and still deals with trauma from his fic of origin, so he would be immensely uncomfortable and try to escape as soon as possible, and then probably avoid the person and any place he expected them to be.<br><br>Unger is kind of a kid, and an immature one at that, so he generally comes across as more mascot material or cute (with a side of arson) than as seriously a potential mate.<br><br>Carry on the other hand, is 100% comfortable with sex as a biological imperative and is pretty likely to take them up on the offer, if he thought the other agent was serious with it and that they are also looking at it as a biological imperative. He&#39;s not particularly interested in romance and long-term emotional relationships.<br></p>

            <p>I think it was called &quot;Bring Me All Your Elderly&quot; or something like that. Basically, the ATLA cartoon characters go into the movie to tell their counterparts how to better portay them. Toph comes along and whips the Pebbledancers into shape, Zuko has no idea he&#39;s part of a cartoon, and the forth wall might as well not exist. In fact, at one point, Mai spectacularly vaporizes it to atoms. And then vaporizes the atoms.</p>

            <p>... then you should probably listen to Nesh, here! For I am about to tell you about a BAD one.<br><br>Lord of the Rings: The Third Age. Released for X-Box/Ps2, and Gamecube, I think. I got this when I was a wee caddy (13ish?) because I love RPGs, I liked Lord of the Rings, and there was only 1 gamestore in the town. <br><br>I was very disapointed. Later, I read some interesting articles on why it was bad,which add more to the tale. See, they never got more then the movie license, or something to that degree, thus they could not put stuff in that wasn&#39;t in the films. So, while you got to play people /technically/ in the movie canon, and /technically/ were taking part in everything, you have no real impact (and any you do is nonsensical). <br><br>You play a generic Gondor soldier, Captain of the Citadel Guard. Promoted for his adherence to heroic archetype, no doubt. You&#39;re going to Rivendell to find Boromir, because his dad wants him back. Or maybe he forgot his lunch, frankly it doesn&#39;t matter much after this point. You are equipped about as well as a hobbit, and Nazgul are your first opponents. Naturally, you win an- oh wait, they stab you and you get saved by a mysterious Elven female. <br><br>Turns out she is Sherlock Holmes, as the sight of Crebain makes her realize Saruman is a traitor, and is attacking a convoy of elves right that instant. You go and help, because the plot says o, and then go look for survivors on Caradhras, of all places. You then encounter a Dunedain Ranger(Rare? Pfft, not at all!) who is looking for his dwarf friend. You manage to track him down in Moria. As it turns ou the Watcher reopens the entrance, trying to get the Fellowship, and you get to run in, then hunt down and kill it. <br><br>Then you run around making noise, and killing goblins, and chase after the Fellowship more. Yakkity Sax ensues. Oh, and then you jump in to help Gandalf fight the Balrog on the tiny bridge. Hmm, I don&#39;t recall that scene... After you help him win (but he still falls) you follow the Fellowship out, learn Boromir is dead, and you&#39;ve been wasting time. Both the characters and player. <br><br>You then follow their trail to Rohan, where Gandalf gives you the job or finding all of Eomer&#39;s men. Then you fight in Helm&#39;s Deep, where it turns out Saruman can contorl you to fight several cave trolls at once. I forgot the part where the Uruk-hai had cave trolls. Then it turns out that that Idreal (forgive me for not posting names unless relevent, the characters are shallow and 2-d)the female Elf was sent by Gandalf and Galadriel, who knew Saruman could control you, and was to stop you from taking the ring to him. She&#39;s also a love interest. <br><br>You then get to fight in Osgiliath,where you fight and beat Goth Mog, and the Witch King (killing neither, naturally, and go to Minas Tirith for soem more excitement. A few dozen fights leter you are fighting two Mumakil at once. On foot. And killing them.  And after the ghost army wins the battle? Suddenly you are fighting the Eye of Sauron. On top of his tower. No explanation is given. I never beat him, and never went back to the game.<br><br>The characters are all shallow, and they barely evolve past stereotypes. They barely have any downtime talk, to get to know eachother, or really explain why they bother doing what they are doing. The fights are tedious because, as said way above, they reuse the same enemies over and over. <br><br>Naturally, the most fleshed out party member is the lead, Berethor. We learn he fled from battle long ago because he was stabbed by a Nazgul stab (before the game, mind. so he was stabbed twice, technically.) So he was banished to Rohan. He fell in love in Rohan with a Shieldmaiden, then Saruman used a spell to make him chase after Boromir to steal the ring and take it to him. Said Shieldmaiden is also in the party. So... like Cloud from FF7, maybe?<br><br>Sorry for rambling, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve posted. Point is, LotR: The Third Age isn&#39;t very good in any sense. I have heard that Shadow of Mordooooooor has fun gameplay, and interestign mechanics. So if you can ignore the fanficesque story, i could be fun. But yeah, reading about OC Do Not Steal Ranger #35 and his best bud the Wraith taking control of orcs made me cringe.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t played the game or seen it played, though, so I don&#39;t know.<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for a <i>goodfic</i>-quality LotR game, though, check out <i>The Lord of the Rings: War in the North</i>. It takes place during LotR, but entirely separately from the main quest. There are one or two things that make me raise my eyebrows a little, but on the other hand, it&#39;s sensible about things like the Great Eagles and Radagast, and it wins a lot more points than it loses in my book. For the most part it slots in quite nicely as a story that could have happened in the world.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yes, story wise, it does not blend in well to LoTR. However, game play wise, it is <i>amazing.</i> The orc-control mechanic works very well, and the combat feels fluid. Honestly, the amount of detail they add to the orcs should make you interested at least. I would say, if you are willing to put aside pre-consived notions about the canon, it is a very fun game.</p>

            <p>However, Des seemed interested in if the game was worth his time. I would say yes, and so would many others. Just wanted to highlight some the positives of the game itself, as it is a wonderful game. It would be a shame to let it go because of some spotty connections to the books.</p>

            <p>My friend, who owns a computer that can run it, describes it as being like Batman: Arkham Asylum. What with the takedowns, and stealth and combat-y-ness. Since you&#39;re a ranger, then you can just mute the sounds, turn off subtitles, and play some music over the game and assume it&#39;s an agent going in after a Sue and all the ORc/baddies are un-canon and just HAVE to go. <br><br>Also the Wraith has to come along because we don&#39;t need more Not-Nazgul. </p>

They go to work to pay the bills just like the rest of us. Just because it involves sex doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re obsessed with it to a weird and creepy degree. So knock it off. {= |<br><br>Random question: how does Eris, Goddess of Discord, figure into the Percy Jackson universe? I dunno if Discord quite equates to Chaos, but if one were looking for a chaotic, female deity for a parent, one could do worse.<br><br>The assassination was brilliant. I completely agree, that target was far too perfect to pass up, and it was hilarious. I don&#39;t think it came too soon, either.<br><br>There were a few other moments that make me laugh aloud, and the two I recall specifically both involved Zeb being clueless. &quot;Hepatitis&quot; and &quot;fruitcake.&quot; ^_^ And hey, fresh, homemade fruitcake can be very good, so there!<br><br>Zeb is adorable. It might just be my cat-person&#39;s &quot;aw, kitty!&quot; instincts kicking in, cuz Luxrays look a bit feline, but I kinda want to cuddle him. And I&#39;m sure he&#39;d appreciate it about as much as the average cat, too. *rolls eyes*<br><br>Since Rina sent him to Jenni in the interlude, I now have a plotbunny where she sets him up to get some canon instruction/newbie training from Ilraen. He&#39;s a gentle, compassionate guy, and he knows what it&#39;s like to be totally clueless and have to learn the ropes in a hurry—at the hands of a far less forgiving partner, at that! I think they&#39;d get along, and the idea of them walking through the Courtyard having intellectual conversations about books or whatever is a nice picture, isn&#39;t it? (Also, I plan for Ilraen to become an agent trainer whenever he retires from the DIC, so whee setting up future character developments.)<br><br>... And I have just now remembered reading down-thread that Zeb is gay, and oh my god what would Ilraen even do with a Pokйmon flirting with him? I do not suggest this would, could, or should be a thing, but the thought of the sheer amount of awkwardness is making me laugh. {X D<br><br>I&#39;mma go to bed now, before I get any more bad ideas.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>All the slut-shaming in the fic just made me cringe. It was like the author had this severely twisted view of porn stars. I&#39;m not saying I have any idea what they&#39;re actually like, because I certainly don&#39;t... but when you know nothing about a subject and can still do a better job portraying it than the badfic, you know something&#39;s Not Right. <br><br>Eris did have some demigod children in PJO, but she didn&#39;t get her own cabin until after the first series was over and Percy made his deal with the gods. <br><br>Glad you liked the assassination! I couldn&#39;t stop laughing when I read that bit in the badfic... ^_^ It really was just too good to pass up. The Stu really should have known better- I mean, it seemed like the half of the camp that wasn&#39;t enamored with him wanted to kill him. *eyeroll*<br><br>Hepatitis actually came from a conversation I had with a friend: we were playing hangman and she blurted out hepatitis instead of Hephaestus. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve referred to him as anything else since. :P It&#39;s a miracle we haven&#39;t been smited. Smote?<br><br>Zeb&#39;s so adorkable. I&#39;m going to try and preserve his innocence as long as possible, &#39;cause it&#39;s just so much fun to write. (He&#39;d let you hug him if you asked first. Blowing up tends to make one twitchy.)<br><br>That would be so cool if Ilraen showed up! Zeb would appreciate the help- and I don&#39;t think Rina ever got to say thank you, so there&#39;s that. But <i>retire??</i> *curls up on the floor sobbing* NOOOOOOOOO<br><br>Zeb isn&#39;t really into anyone not a Pokйmon, but then again, who knows? Andalites are Cool. <s>No I totally don&#39;t have a crush on Aximili</s> I think Zeb would be more &quot;ask about ALL THE THINGS&quot; instead of flirting. He&#39;s kind of shy as it is, exploding aside. He might make an awkward pass. </p>

            <p>Granted, I don&#39;t know any porn stars either, but it stands to reason. Most people, by and large, are just people like other people. Switch out the hows and whys all you like, but we all pretty much want the same things: security, wellness, sense of place and purpose, etc. *shrug*<br><br>Jenni: *writes prescription* <i>RC 999. Ask for Ilraen. Ignore his partner.</i><br><br>*g* This can be a thing if you want. I dunno if there&#39;s enough story for an interlude, and I think we both have a lot of writing on our plates at the moment, but maybe a little journal RP, reply when you feel like it sort of deal?<br><br>Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not planning to retire Ilraen anytime soon. Anyway, he&#39;ll still be around, so it&#39;s not so bad. {= )<br><br>Andalites ARE cool, and Ax was my favorite character, too. My fangirl tendencies run more toward &quot;please let me bask in your awesome presence/take you away from all this pain,&quot; not so much crushing, but yeah.<br><br>Ilraen actually has a crush on Agent Cinderella (Andalites prefer blondes, this is my headcanon), but since Herr Wozzeck has vanished into the mists of RL, I dunno if anything&#39;s gonna come of that. Le sigh. I want him to get a girlfriend—or a boyfriend, even, but that would only end in disappointment when Ilraen figures out he likes girls. Preferably one who&#39;s willing to take the lead and be very patient, because Ilraen has no idea how to relationship. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>However, it seems that missions are getting shorter into the story before the charges are laid out. Either badfics gone worse and worse, or it&#39;s getting more taxing to write very long missions. I weep for the former, but as for the latter, it may be for the best.</p>

            <p>That was a skillful job of killing something that could&#39;ve been really NSFW-y in a way that was still readable. Nice!<br><br>And, &#39;son of Chaos&#39; - um, yeah, no. I&#39;m pretty sure I would&#39;ve noticed if <i>House of Hades</i> personified Chaos - particularly as a woman. Though I do wonder whether the writer was thinking of Nyx (does she spell it that way, or did Riordan go with Nix? I forget), and got tangled up.<br><br>Also: timeline craziness like whoa. If Percy isn&#39;t 16 yet, what&#39;s Nico even <i>doing</i> at Camp Half-Blood? He ran way after Bianca died, and didn&#39;t really come back... uh... ever. Not to mention he not only wasn&#39;t openly homosexual - he doesn&#39;t seem to have admitted it to <i>himself</i> at that point. (Also, pillar of flame. Wut, Nico. Just, wut.)<br><br>One thing I particularly liked: your characterisation of Clarisse just before and after the exorcism. You showed us what &#39;possessed&#39; looked like, and exactly how it&#39;s different from &#39;normal&#39; - without descending into overkill-levels for either.<br><br>(And... hey, if Chaos is &#39;GAPless&#39;, where exactly is Roxy supposed to have... y&#39;know... come out?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>If memory serves, it was Nyx. It... would not surprise me if the author mixed them up, considering everything else that happened.<br><br>Nico stayed at Camp for a few days after the final battle in <i>Last Olympian</i>, but then he left. I think by the end of the series, he&#39;d spent more time in Camp Jupiter than Camp Half-Blood. <br><br>Glad you liked how I handled Clarisse!

            <p>Just by the <i>mission</i>, I swear that this badfic has to be a troll! It just has to! Like, seriously, who seriously writes stuff like &quot;[the Stu,] <b>now only in his black-brief-and-printed-with-a-target-sign-in-the-butt undergarment, swayed a little in the air, dancing like some kind of whore-slut devoid of morals</b>&quot;? The author couldn&#39;t possibly be serious. I was positively eager for the Stu to die...and you did not disappoint.<br><br>Also, good work acclimating Zeb to the PPC. Pardon my slowness (I&#39;m sure you explained it before), but what&#39;s happening with Randa (both in-universe and IRL)?<br><br>Two issues, though:<br>First, it looks like you inadvertently made a mini:<br><i>She&#39;s a daughter of Ares who single-handedly took down a <b>drachon</b> all by herself</i><br>According to the Percy Jackson Wiki, the spelling is &quot;dra<b>k</b>on.&quot; Is it amiss?<br><br>Secondly, this line:<br><i>Zeb&#39;s eyes widened, then narrowed. &quot;That is completely unacceptable!&quot; he said, his voice trembling. &quot;Sexual orientation is nothing to be mocked!&quot;</i><br><br>Being native to the Pokemon universe, how would Zeb have such a liberal view of sexual orientation, much less be so incensed at homophobic slurs? Sexual orientation isn&#39;t mentioned at all in the anime, and given the Day-Care&#39;s workings, I doubt that homosexual pairings feature in the games either.</p>

Yeah, I don&#39;t know what I was thinking. ^^; Thank you again for pointing those out.<br><br>Secondly: I sure hope to the gods it was a troll. This fic... this whole fic... *shivers*<br><br>Thirdly: Randa. IRL, we still see each other at school, but very rarely, and I can&#39;t remember the last time we were able to hold a good conversation due to time constraints. Since we&#39;re most likely going to lose touch after we graduate high school, I decided to go ahead and bring in a new agent, even though she gave me the go-ahead to write agent!Randa. I don&#39;t feel totally comfortable writing what is basically her, so agent!Randa will be seen in two more missions (the already-started co-writes with SkarmorySilver and World-Jumper) and then I&#39;m putting her in Bad Slash.</p>

            <p>Yeah, the hydra that showed up in <i>The Sea of Monsters</i> book was much  closer to its mythological counterpart than ghe fire-breathing one in <i>The Lightning Thief</i> movie. Also, the movie basically took this awesome quest to stop Hades, save the world and Percy&#39;s mom, and retrieve the Master Bolt and turned it into a Fetch Quest for <s>Plot Coupons</s> <s>MacGuffins</s> pearls. I could rant all day about the movies, though, so I&#39;ll just stop now.<br><br>Ironically enough, Hades and Persephone had one of the better godly marriages, especially considering the circumstances surrounding the arrangement. If I ever came across a mention of either of them being unfaithful to the other, I can&#39;t think of it.<br><br>(Also, in TLT book, the kids could leave whenever they wanted and nobody tried to stop them. The only problem was, well, they didn&#39;t want to leave in the first place.) </p>

            <p>Did you ever come across a mention of Hades doing <i>anything</i> after his abduction of Persephone? Much like his fellow non-Olympian-child-of-Kronos (Hestia), he doesn&#39;t get a lot of mention in mythology.<br><br>Persephone, on the other hand, did - but mostly in a Mystery context, which we no longer have. I doubt they discussed her marriage very much, though.<br><br>While I&#39;m on the subject, and contradicting myself: did anyone else get the impression Persephone <i>wanted</i> to stay in the Underworld? I&#39;m looking at sentences like this:<br><br><i>But he on his part secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed Demeter.</i><br>(Homeric Hymn to Demeter, courtesy <a href="http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/HaidesPersephone1.html">Theoi</a>)<br><br>&#39;Secretly&#39;? That doesn&#39;t imply &#39;forced&#39;, and it doesn&#39;t imply &#39;without her knowing what it would mean&#39;. To me, it strongly suggests &#39;without her mother&#39;s knowledge&#39; - ie, it was a secret plan between Persephone and Hades. And that description of Demeter offers a reason, too - particularly since &#39;grave, dark-robed&#39; is more the way you&#39;d expect to see <i>Hades</i> described.<br><br>(And yeah, she later says he &#39;secretly&#39; put it in her mouth and &#39;forced her to taste&#39; - but she also doesn&#39;t mention this until Demeter specifically asks. I reckon she&#39;s just lying. ^_^)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hi, guys! I&#39;ve mentioned here and there that I&#39;ve been working on an idea, and I think I&#39;ve gotten about as far as I can with it on my own, so it&#39;s time to share. Basically, it&#39;s what it says in the subject: some sort of annual PPC Fic Awards ceremony.<br><br><b>Why?</b><br><br>Basically, two main reasons:<br><br>1. It could be fun! It&#39;s always nice to get recognition, and I&#39;d personally love to see stories get remembered and discussed beyond their publication announcement threads.<br><br>2. It could be a way to solve a problem that&#39;s gone unresolved for too long: How do we nominate new pages for a place in the Slain Mary Sues category on the wiki?<br><br><b>Why Not?</b><br><br>I foresee a few potential problems we&#39;ll need to sort out if/when we decide to do this:<br><br>1. Who&#39;s going to run it? I don&#39;t want to do it every year, so we&#39;ll have to figure out how to appoint a Master of Ceremonies or some such.<br><br>2. What if people try to shoehorn X thing(s) into their stories just to get nominated for X category/ies, or treat it as some sort of checklist? That would suck.<br><br>3. What if the same people get nominated all the time and the same people don&#39;t? That would also suck.<br><br><b>How?</b><br><br>Something like this would need a system of categories and rules for nomination. I have a few ideas:<br><br><u>Rules</u><br><br>1. It&#39;s an annual thing, so only fics posted in the last year can be nominated.<br><br>2. No one may nominate their own work.<br><br>3. A story may be nominated in more than one category.<br><br>4. Only one winner in each category. Second and third place in a category may be granted if there are enough nominees.<br><br>5. A story needs at least X nominations/seconds to qualify. (Three, maybe?) The first nominator must supply a link to the story and tell us why they nominated it. (We&#39;re looking for more than &quot;I just really like it,&quot; ideally.)<br><br>6. Once all qualifying nominations are in, a vote will be held to determine first, second, and third place. Probably on something like Google Surveys to keep it neat. (I&#39;m thinking the whole process should take maybe a week.)<br><br>7. Anything else?<br><br><u>Categories</u><br><br>* Best Newcomer - Best story by a PPCer who just got Permission in the last year.<br><br>* Best New Spin-off - Best first chapter in a spin-off established this year by someone who got Permission more than a year ago.<br><br>* Best New Episode - Best new chapter in a spin-off established more than a year ago.<br><br>* Best Mission (Action) - Best story concerning the adventures of action agents in the field.<br><br>* Best Mission (Infrastructure) - Best story concerning the adventures of infrastructure agents in their job.<br><br>* Best Interlude - Best story concerning any PPC agents/characters outside of work.<br><br>* Best AU - Best story set outside the main continuity, such as Ten Years Hence stories and Trans-Canonical Fictional Defence Agency stories. (All others are assumed to take place in the main timeline, past or present.)<br><br>* Best Assassination - The story with the most creative/funny/original/satisfying Mary Sue death.<br><br>* Best Exorcism - As above, for exorcisms.<br><br>* Best Takedown - As above, for missions not involving assassinations or exorcisms. (It happens, theoretically!)<br><br>* Most Memorable Suvian - For the story containing the Sue/Stu that still makes us laugh/cry/vomit the most. The winner or possibly the top three would get a page in the Slain Mary Sues category.<br><br>* Any others? Or are these too many or too redundant?<br><br><br>So... that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got. What do you all think? I&#39;ve pretty much already said my piece here, so I may not talk a whole lot more, especially since I don&#39;t want this to be My Thing. I have enough Things. I&#39;ll jump in if I have anything else worth saying, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re enjoying college! That&#39;s always a good thing. I can definitely sympathize with the many credits, though, as I&#39;m doing that too this year (I&#39;d tell you how many credits, but I expect we count credits a little differently at my school, so the number would probably horrify you). Crossovers going well also=a good thing.<br><br>Me, I&#39;ve been busy. So much so that I&#39;ve been away long enough to actually feel qualified to make a returnbie post /headdesk/.

            <p>Is it ever specified what type of gear DIA patrol officers carry with them? I&#39;d expect them to wear a kevlar vest (or better) and have flashlights, radios, cuffs, and a sidearm with them-- but is there a spinoff with a more detailed description?

            <p>DIA&#39;s patrol division is equivalent to a modern World One police force in a lot of ways, much like how special response is basically equivalent to a SWAT team. They&#39;re less militarised in a lot of respects, but HQ is a beat where everyone there is armed and knows how to use their weapons, plus when an agent snaps it usually gets really messy <i>really</i> quickly, so the DIA&#39;s patrol officers are armed and trained accordingly. By necessity, patrol and special response (who have more specialised training of course) officers need to be equipped to deal with any internal or external threat that may pop up, and proficient enough in a confrontation to resolve the incident with minimal harm to themselves or innocents (for lack of a better term, in HQ...).<br><br>As for equipment, I imagine there&#39;s some variance depending on the needs of the specific officer, and versatility is prized due to the sheer diversity of agents - your kit needs to work just as well on a Discworld troll or whatever as a human, though I imagine if something like a Saiyan or Kryptonian flips out and starts smashing heads patrol&#39;s orders are damage control and basically just distraction until special response and/or the Raiders get there. The general guideline is body armour (probably better stuff than kevlar but I never thought on specifics, I imagine this is somewhat up to the individual officer but there are guidelines to follow - it has to be subtle, fitting under the uniform or whatnot instead of DIA officers marching around looking like Imperial Stormtroopers, and strong enough to ward off stuff like sword blows and gunshots without harming the officer too much; super heavy armour is probably for when the DIA needs to crack down on a particularly big problem), the stuff you said (torch, radio, cuffs, etc), sidearm (something that can quickly incapacitate without killing is preferred - I imagine a lot of DIA patrolmen swear by Star Wars blasters or Star Trek phasers since those have stun functions as well as bigger deal functions for when stunning stops being an option, and HFA wands - or the real deal for any officers from Potterverse - would also be handy), and also a portal device so they can get around quickly. While DIA officers are probably trained to navigate HQ, they also need to be able to respond to a crisis within a moment&#39;s notice, so being able to zero in on some coordinates and portal right over would be a godsend. The DIA <i>probably</i> has access to at least one HQ map, too, it&#39;d just make sense, but I&#39;ve been divided on whether to have it just be one big one in DIA Central or to have officers walk around with a gadget that can call up a map hologram like a fancy, HQ-specific GPS. Of course, the map is a moot point for the New Caledonia officers, so they wouldn&#39;t have that gadget. Central has an armoury any officer can access, and some guidelines as to equipment standards, but as long as an officer can make it work - and of course, there&#39;s mandatory training time to ensure competency - Lieutenant Andretti and the Tiger Lily probably aren&#39;t too fussed about what&#39;s &quot;standard issue&quot; among Patrol Division. <br><br>These are just my first thoughts right off the top of my head, and of course DIAers who need to respond to a specific type of situation are likely to go back to Central and get what they need if they don&#39;t have it on hand right at that moment, but I hope it&#39;s helpful; I can elaborate further on stuff if you like. I&#39;ve put a good bit of thought into this stuff, the only reason I haven&#39;t written too much on the DIA is due to lack of time/ideas/having a bunch of other projects going. And if you want help bouncing stuff around, pretty sure you know my email; always glad to help out.</p>

            <p>Not an event, though. A straightforward RP is probably the easiest option - it&#39;s basically &#39;fire and forget&#39;, if you can come up with a premise.

            <p>It hurts even more considering that I would actually like it if Dumbledore were less evil, Harry were less overpowered and this magical car felt less unmagical, not to mention the Ron bashing and the Slytherin bashing that would apparently come up if this were continued.<br><br>Obviously I don&#39;t know enough about the <i>Culture</i> to see the uncanon there. <br><br>Is Fal &#39;Ngeestra a Referrer?

            <p>Yes. In fact, Fal &#39;Ngeestra is the Referrer that appears in <i>Consider Phlebas</i>.<br>Actually, normal ships can use Ultraspace (&quot;upper&quot; hyperspace). The Excession is special because it&#39;s connected to both Ultraspace and Infraspace (&quot;lower&quot; hyperspace) at the same time.<br>The point is that the Excession is really, really special, and making Harry one, then ignoring the consequences... let&#39;s say it made my mind melt.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m re-reading it now. It is a pile of dog eggs roughly the size of a GSV. The Potter stuff just does not mesh with the Culture stuff in the setup provided, and it&#39;s all bloody wrong anyway. Also, check the Author&#39;s Notes. Evidently they take about as well to criticism as a nipple to an angle grinder, and they admit to serious timeline violations for the benefit of their stupid, stupid, stupid, STUPID idea.<br><br>I get that Harry Potter being raised by the Culture is interesting. I like that bit. I like, upon the reread, almost nothing else. It&#39;s yet to give me my ultimate bugbear of manipulative!Dumbledore, but knowing my luck it was probably being foreshadowed.

            <p>I have mixed feelings on this. On one hand, Netflix has yet to disappoint on their new original series. On the other hand, the original cartoon&#39;s reputation will be quite difficult to overcome. This has a lot of potential, though - the article compared it to a family-friendly Game of Thrones, so perhaps we will get a glimpse of how Hylian politics truly work. Also, I&#39;m sad that the show has already lost a potential big name: Robin Williams. He was one of the biggest fans of LoZ in existence, and something like this would have been right up his alley. His daughter Zelda shared his love of the series, so perhaps she&#39;ll have some input after all - from what I&#39;ve heard, the both of them talked about potential roles with Nintendo frequently. Robin was the go-to guy to play Professor Oak if needed, for example.</p>

            <p>In all seriousness, though, I&#39;m a bit skeptical myself - but if this turns out to be true, and more importantly if they do it <i>well,</i> my armor bird screech of ecstasy will probably be heard for miles. Especially if Nintendo is helping to produce it, because that way you can be sure they&#39;ll be faithful to the franchise.<br><br>For my taste, I personally think it would be fun to see something like this introduce brand-spanking new characters, like they did with Lana from Hyrule Warriors.</p>

            <p>Sorry to annoy everyone with my questions about elves from Middle-Earth, but I truly don&#39;t want any major Canon Breaks in the fic that I&#39;m writing. Now I have some questions about their capabilities, that have been bugging me out for a while.<br><br>1.- What are the limits of their physical capabilities?<br><br>2.- How do their spiritual/magical/mental/supernatural abilities work?<br><br>3.- Could the transformations shown by Galadriel &amp; Thranduil in the Movieverse be related to those above mentioned abilities?<br><br>4.- Could any elf, from any kind, be able to use everything mentioned above? If not; which kind can use which abilities and which are unique to Ringbearers? <br><br>I think those questions cover all my concerns for the time being. Plausible hypothesis are accepted for answers, when canon ones are unavailable. And sorry again for being such pain with my hard questions. XD</p>

            <p>1/ As far as physical strength and endurance goes, the upper limit is probably Fingolfin&#39;s battle with Morgoth:<br><br><i>But at the last the King grew weary, and Morgoth bore down his shield upon him. Thrice he was crushed to his knees, and thrice arose again and bore up his broken shield and stricken helm. But the earth was all rent and pitted about him, and he stumbled and fell backward before the feet of Morgoth; and Morgoth set his left foot upon his neck, and the weight of it was like a fallen hill. Yet with his last and desperate stroke Fingolfic hewed the foot with Ringil, and the blood gushed forth black and smoking and filled the pits [left by] Grond.</i> (&#39;The Silmarillion&#39;, Chapter 18)<br><br>Morgoth, at this point, is huge - he&#39;s described as a like a tower, or a stormcloud. But Fingolfin not only survived - and got back up from - three blows from this giant - he also survived having Morgoth <i>step on his neck</i> long enough to cut his foot, and deeply. So that speaks well for both strength and endurance.<br><br>Switching to the Third Age, we find Legolas wanting to keep running in Rohan after a full day, when Gimli is exhausted (and ignore what the movies say: dwarves are quite clearly built for endurance). He was also the only one not borne down by the troubles on Caradhras - though that might have been more to do with being able to run on top of the snow.<br><br>Switching to another famous elven ability - sight - there&#39;s a <a href="http://greenbooks.theonering.net/guest/files/081503_02.html">lovely article</a> which goes into detail on that. Suffice to say that Legolas would be able to notice within under ten minutes the motion of Mars against the starfield - a human would have to wait ten <b>hours</b>.<br><br>2/ <i>&quot;... this is what your folk would call magic, I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel.&quot;</i> (LotR II, Chapter 7)<br><br>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not asking about <i>all</i> magic in Arda - that one&#39;s a really tricky subject. But as to the elves, there are... maybe five kinds of &#39;magic&#39;:<br><br>a) The Light of Valinor, as seen on Glorfindel in Fellowship. This is a byproduct of having lived under the light of the Trees, and is basically an &#39;inner light&#39;; in the Unseen realm, it manifests as an almost blinding glow, and is at minimum terrifying to Nazgul. Obviously, it&#39;s only present if you, uh, lived in Valinor before the Trees were murdered.<br><br>b) Foresight and Insight, or to give them their proper names, <i>apacen</i> and <i>tercen</i>. These are pretty much what the sound like - <i>apacen</i> is the kind of future vision Galadriel obtained through her Mirror, and <i>tercen</i> is her... semi mind-reading. She may or may not possess actual telepathy as well, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s made clear.<br><br>c) Craft. Elven-work is, um, better. ^<em>^ Ringil, the sword of Fingolfin, wounded Morgoth eight times, while a Numenorean blade dissolved after stabbing the Lord of the Nazgul just once. Furthermore, elven-craft can enhance the properties of objects above what is natural:<br><br><i>&quot;Are these magic cloaks?&quot; asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder.<br><br>&quot;I do not know what you mean by that,&quot; answered the leader of the Elves. &quot;They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this land. They are elvish robes, certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf and branch, water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of Lorien that we love; for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make...&quot;</i> (LotR II, Chapter 8)<br><br>A few pages on, we come across Galadriel&#39;s gifts: at a minimum, the Phial of Galadriel is enhanced, and quite possibly the earth in Sam&#39;s box as well. The boats, the ropes - even the <i>lembas</i> of the Galadhrim is &#39;magically&#39; enhanced.<br><br>But this enhancement isn&#39;t &#39;add any attribute you like&#39;; it seems to only make things <i>more themselves</i>. The cloaks, woven light and camoflaged, become extra light and super-camo. As to how this was done...<br><br>d) Song. Don&#39;t knock singing - it&#39;s the very method of the creation of Arda. And it&#39;s most definitely a tool of elvish magic:<br><br><i>And Luthien now was left alone.<br>A magic song to Men unknown<br>she sang...<br>... and all names of things<br>tallest and longest on earth she sings:<br>the locks of the Longbeard dwarves; the tail<br>of Draugluin the werewolf pale;<br>the body of Glaurung the great snake;<br>the vast upsoaring peaks that quake<br>above the fires in Angband&#39;s gloom...</i><br><br>Song is the medium by which Luthien enhances her craft - in this case, she&#39;s imbuing her own hair with the properties it already possesses: length, and darkness. When she&#39;s done, she has enough to weave a cloak and rope, and darkness/night enough to bring down sleep on anyone she chooses - up to and including Morgoth.<br><br>And music isn&#39;t just used in craft (or by half-Ainur): the most famous passage from the <i>Lay of Leithian</i> runs, in part, as follows:<br><br><i>He [Sauron] chanted a song of wizardry,<br>Of piercing, opening, of treachery,<br>Revealing, uncovering, betraying.<br>Then sudden Felagund there swaying<br>Sang in answer a song of staying,<br>Resisting, battling against power,<br>Of secrets kept, strength like a tower...</i><br><br>Here, both Sauron and Finrod (Felagund) are trying to enchant not an object, but a person - Finrod himself. Sauron uses &#39;the deceits of the Enemy&#39; - Finrod, in contrast, tries to enhance his own nature. He fills his song with resistance, with &#39;trust unbroken&#39;, and with &#39;all the magic and might... of Elvenesse&#39;.<br><br>Ultimately, he fails, because Sauron turns his own song against him: he twists Finrod&#39;s memories of &#39;the sighing of the Sea beyond/Beyond the western world, on sand/On sand of pearls in Elvenland&#39; with the reality of the murder of the Trees, and of Feanor&#39;s kinslaying.<br><br><i>The wolf howls. The ravens flee.<br>The ice mutters in the mouths of the Sea.<br>The captives sad in Angband mourn.<br>Thunder rumbles, the fires burn--<br>And Finrod fell before the throne.</i><br><br>But still - I&#39;d love to see a story about elven battle-song. ^</em>^<br><br>(All of which suggests a new spin on Galadriel&#39;s &#39;Namarie&#39;, which ends with her singing: &#39;May it be that thou [Frodo] shalt find Valimar!&#39; Poetry, a hope, a wish - or an enchantment and a spell? You decide.<br><br>e) Illusion. This one shows up mostly among people who knew Melian. She, of course, spun a web of illusion and magic around Doriath, to keep unfriendly creatures out. Later, Finrod used similar illusion - &#39;by the arts of Felagund their own forms and faces were changed into the likeness of Orcs&#39;. And waaaaay down in history, Thranduil (whose father was a member of Melian&#39;s court) apparently uses something related to spirit his feasts away from Thorin&#39;s company.<br><br>But all of these sort of fall under &#39;craft&#39;. Finrod had to outfit his party with Orcish gear and weapons, which he could draw on the essence of; Melian used the already-tangled woods of Doriath; Thranduil had Mirkwood to draw on. The idea that an elf could, say, create an illusion of an elephant, is unsupported by the Legendarium.<br><br>f) [Okay, I lied, there&#39;s six] The Rings. <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Theory11.htm">I&#39;ve discussed this on Netilardo</a>. The evidence suggests that the Three Rings were created to sustain the world, which is what Galadriel uses Nenya for. (We can ignore Gandalf&#39;s apparent use of Narya - he&#39;s a Maia, there&#39;s different interactions there). And apart from communicating with the wearer of the One Ring, that&#39;s all they&#39;re for: freezing time in place, so that the world of the Eldar doesn&#39;t pass away.<br><br>3/ Galadriel, Thranduil... yipes. Well. Galadriel <i>is</i> a warrior, so she could be enhancing her &#39;scary&#39; aspect... nah, sorry, I think the best explanation for that is &#39;PJ doesn&#39;t know what starlight looks like&#39;. The book describes starlight in the scene by the Mirror, and her &#39;Storm Queen&#39; scene in B5A would also make more sense with starlight (known for its evil-banishing properties). Actually, I&#39;d swear I saw her holding the Phial in that scene - I wonder if the Dark/Evil/Scary thing was added in post-production.<br><br>Thranduil is much easier: movie!Thranduil was supposedly scarred by a dragon, but we&#39;ve already established he could have access to &#39;enhancing&#39; illusions. The illusion of your own face being undamaged must be quite simple.<br><br>4/ I think most of this has been answered above. There&#39;s no fundamental differences between the tribes of the Quendi - the only determining factors are: whether they saw the Trees in their glory, whether they knew Melian, and whether they have a Ring. Galadriel, of course, fulfils all three - and she and Celebrimbor are the only people in history to have done so (and &#39;Brim may never have met Melian).<br><br>This has been your overly-long answer to a Tolkien trivia question of the week. ^_^ Well, you asked!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Frodo perceived Glorfindel as a great light, and my reading has always been that this a) was because he lived under Treeslight, and b) is what drove the Black Riders into the river, even though they were terrified of water.<br><br>To be honest, the Nazgul aren&#39;t that hard to scare off. Fire, running water, Caliquendi - you can pretty much send them running at a moment&#39;s notice. The trouble comes in three ways:<br><br>1/ Unlike wild animals, they don&#39;t just blindly run in fear. Sure, the Witch-King will back away from a torch - but when you turn to do the same to Khamul, you get a Morgul blade in the back.<br><br>2/ It only works if you can reach them. ^_^ Their winged steeds carry them nicely over water, and keep them out of range of fire, too - and the distance doesn&#39;t do anything to stop the effects of their cries.<br><br>3/ The Nazgul aren&#39;t front-line troops anyway - they&#39;re spies, assassins, and saboteurs. Think of Merry in Bree - he didn&#39;t know <i>what</i> hit him, but the Black Breath still knocked him right out. When we see the Ringwraiths, it&#39;s in exceptional circumstances, with everything on the line; their normal MO is closer to that tense, subtle pursuit of Frodo across the Shire.<br><br>Add in the fact that, while running water is a universal barrier (particularly for Khamul, as I recall), fire is apparently more of a panic reaction - certainly the Witch-King had no problems navigating the fire-filled trenches of the Pelennor, and actually held a magically-flaming sword when he encountered Gandalf - and you&#39;re left with a bunch of short-term solutions for a very long-term problem.<br><br>But for startling them long enough to get away, a Valinorian Elda revealing her innate power would probably work, yes.<br><br>(Which leaves me to wonder - what exactly were they scared of?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Really! All the time I was thinking that she should had be severly injured after all the clobberin&#39; that she received and I was utterly flabbergasted when at the end <i>she was still able to stand and apparently unharmed</i>; now I think that if something, she was heavily nerfed. <br><br>Also, I think that the info just killed the climax of my fic, those elves are just too hard to injure, and the climax hinged on the OC receiving enough severe injuries to keep the OC out of comission for <i>months</i>, something that is no longer feasible due to the way the story was structured. On the other hand, that gives me more leeway to punish the OC with slapstick comedy. BWAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br>Ahem, well going back to the supernatural abilities, seems like my OC will have a rather limited &quot;elven magic&quot; ability, because well, a) Is a <i>warrior</i>, b) The OC&#39;s ancestry haven&#39;t been purely Noldor in <i>4600 years</i> and is mostly Silvan, and c) Was born in the 2900 of the Third Age. So, no fancy magic stuff for the OC, except, perhaps; a little singing. (Don&#39;t expect much, I&#39;m a terrible lyricist)<br><br>Ok, I lied a little, there&#39;s another thing. A Lesser Power Ring. Pretty much the power of that ring can be summed up as: &quot;Slows the perception of the flow of time, as long as the bearer, conciously or unconciously; desires to do so and keeps focused on that desire.&quot; That means that the ring is quite unreliable, and I think its capabilites fit within the range being just a &quot;practice of the craft&quot;. Or what do  you think? <br><br>(Also, yes, the ring is out when the One is destroyed.)<br><br></p>

            <p>Yes, she should probably have been seriously injured. But you can fight on after being even fatally wounded - just, y&#39;know, not for very long.<br><br>W/r/t your abc:<br><br>a) Eldar aren&#39;t &#39;just&#39; warriors. They live for thousands of years, you don&#39;t specialise that extremely. Everyone, at minimum, is an artist. And there&#39;s no indication that &#39;magic&#39; is particularly difficult - look again at how blase the elves are about the Lorien cloaks.<br><br>b) There&#39;s no fundamental difference between the Noldor and the Lindar (ie, &#39;the third tribe, using their own name). They probably had less tercen and apacen, because of no Treeslight, but other than that...<br><br>c) Um. 2900 might be a bit late. The Eldar are noted to not tend to have children in times of war - and the Necromancer appeared in Dol Guldur in 2460, with the note that &#39;the Watchful Peace ends&#39;. That&#39;s about as late as any Third Age elves should be born.<br><br>(Also: singing doesn&#39;t require you to write the song)<br><br>The Lesser Ring: this is one of the rings described by Gandalf as mere essays in the craft. We know they could turn you invisible; we also know they couldn&#39;t extend your life like the One did to Bilbo, because that&#39;s what worried Gandalf to begin with. It&#39;s... yeah, it&#39;s plausible, since we know so little about how the Rings operated in the first place. It&#39;ll probably still have a corrupting effect, since Sauron got his grubby little mitts on it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Just because Fingolfin could take a beating like that doesn&#39;t mean just anyone can. Fingolfin was a very powerful lord of the Noldor who had seen the Light of the Trees. Also, bear in mind that <i>The Silmarillion</i> is, from an in-universe standpoint, a translation of the Elvish legends of the First Age. The tale may have been embellished for poetic or dramatic purposes—for example, he&#39;s crushed down three times, not one, two, or four. It could be accurate, or it could be that Morgoth crushed him like a bug the first time, he lashed out with his dying breath, and managed to land a lucky hit.

            <p>I kid. It could&#39;ve been read either way, though. You&#39;re too good at that Elven &quot;both yes and no&quot; thing. *g*<br><br>While we&#39;re talking Elves, I&#39;ve been making a little progress in fact-checking the names and language in a fic WM and I are sporking, and I&#39;d like to run what I&#39;ve got by you, see if I&#39;m on the right track. So far, I&#39;ve got a few names and a phrase:<br><br>1. <i>Lle naa vanima</i>, &quot;you are beautiful&quot; - This is Grelvish, isn&#39;t it? It seems to be Quenya-derived, but would the correct Quenya phrase be <i>nalye vanima</i>?<br><br>2. Ohtarie - This is a name given to a female Elf in Lothlуrien. <i>Ohtar</i> seems to be a legitimate Quenya word meaning &quot;warrior,&quot; but just slapping <i>-ie</i> on the end doesn&#39;t seem to make it a feminine name, but rather an adjective that would mean something like &quot;warriorness.&quot; Ohtar<i>ien</i> might work... if it weren&#39;t a bit silly for a Lуrien Elf to have a Quenya name.<br><br>3. Heridil - Another Quenya name stuck on a Lуrien Elf. This one apparently means &quot;Lady-friend.&quot; *snicker*<br><br>4. There&#39;s a dragon with the unfortunate name of Smut. I want to save him from a needlessly gruesome and insulting death and send him home to the First Age, and I&#39;ve attempted to devise a Quenya name for him: Soace, &quot;Little Filth.&quot; Does that work? Sindarin might be better, but Sindarin is hard. {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>1/ Yup, that&#39;s Grelvish. The clue is the horrifying double letters. (I <i>think</i> they put them in to avoid using accents - &#39;namбriл&#39; becomes &#39;namaarie&#39; - but it&#39;s still horrifying)<br><br>2/ -ie has three meanings: an infinitive/gerund, an abstract from an adjective (so yes, &#39;warriorness&#39; if you accept &#39;warrior&#39; as an adjective), and in certain outdated forms, &#39;is&#39; (ie, &#39;is a warrior&#39;). But the last is indeed outdated. Ohtarien (&#39;warrioress&#39;) or Ohtariel (&#39;warrior&#39;s daughter&#39;) would work just fine; my fine-tuned Eldarin ear says you&#39;re probably right to go with -n. But no, no way should it be Quenya; the Sindarin would be Maethoriel for &#39;daughter&#39;... and given the evidence of &#39;Luthien&#39;, I guess Maethorien would be allowable too, and again, probably preferred.<br><br>3/ Actually, &#39;Herindil&#39; would indeed mean &#39;lady&#39;s friend&#39;, but it&#39;s not a terribly nice-sounding word. It&#39;s normally masculine; the feminine would be &#39;Herindilme&#39;, which... still sounds horrible. The &#39;lady&#39; in there is the feminine of &#39;lord&#39;, rather than &#39;woman&#39; (which would give &#39;Nindil&#39;... honestly, I don&#39;t like the clashing &#39;i&#39; sounds in all of these). I&#39;m... well, you could alter the original to &#39;Herindur&#39; to make a decent masculine name - albeit one that still means &#39;friend of a noble lady&#39; (perhaps it&#39;s Varda?). In Sindarin it would be &#39;Heryn&#39; or &#39;Hiril&#39; for &#39;lady&#39;, and... uh... well, I can&#39;t find a &#39;friend&#39; suffix, but you could be more honest by affixing &#39;-dir&#39; (Heryndir, Hirildir) to mean &#39;watcher&#39;. Stalker name!<br><br>4/ It looks like the diminutive ending is indeed -ice, so &#39;Soace&#39; would work... except that it looks unpronouncable. I&#39;ve got a few Sindarin options for you, though:<br><br>Gwaurbоn - &#39;Little Soiled One&#39;<br>Lhоwbоn - &#39;Little Sickness&#39;<br>Lhоwdithen - &#39;Little Sickness&#39;<br>Pоndhelos - &#39;Little Loathing&#39;<br>Angosbоn - &#39;Little Horror&#39;<br>Tithengorth - &#39;Little Horror&#39;/&#39;Little Corpse&#39; (ah, homophones)<br>Pоngorth - as above<br>Gorgorbоn - &#39;Tiny, Extreme Horror&#39;<br><br>Some of those are incredibly fun to say. ^_^<br><br>If you don&#39;t like any of them, I can try to derive a better-sounding Quenya version, or look for more Sindarin words in the same general theme.<br><br>hS</p>

<li>So, <i>nalye vanima</i> Y/N? It may not matter, but I&#39;m curious.<br><br>2. Cool. We were also considering renaming her something with the sense of &quot;beautiful water,&quot; since we were giggling over the name sounding a bit like &quot;Ontario&quot; and that&#39;s apparently one possible translation. I got as far as <i>Bain</i> + <i>nen</i>, but I have no idea how to make that sound decent, or if it would need mutation or something. (I&#39;m having trouble wrapping my head around that stuff.)<br><br>3. Heridil is a guy, forgot to mention. The noble lady in question is the fic&#39;s Sue, naturally. Heridil teaches her archery.<br><br>4. So-AH-ke, right? I kinda like that it&#39;s a little sleazy-sounding. {= ) I&#39;ll think about a Sindarin option, though.<br><br>Oh, a couple other things that come up a lot:<br><br>5. <i>Baraer</i> and <i>Baraermin</i>, &quot;Fiery One&quot; and &quot;My Fiery One&quot; - Nicknames Haldir gives the Sue. <i>Bara</i> is apparently a Sindarin word meaning fire, but I don&#39;t like the sound of either one of these constructions. I&#39;m just having trouble pinning down the exact grammatical (il)logic. There&#39;s no evidence I can find of an <i>-er</i> suffix with this (or any) function. Maybe it&#39;s based on the Grelvish <i>lirimaer</i>, which also gets used of the Sue a fair bit.<br><br>Even allowing <i>baraer</i>, though, shouldn&#39;t the latter be <i>baraer nin</i>, a la <i>mellon nin</i>? Or have the movies gotten the wrong sounds in my head?<br><br>6. <i>Tithen aras</i>, &quot;Little dear&quot; - Wise and noble Elves occasionally refer to the Sue this way. But, <i>aras</i> apparently means &quot;deer,&quot; like the critter what we hunt for venison? *snicker*<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>1/ <i>Nalye vanima</i> looks like Quenya for &#39;you are beautiful&#39; to me. Is that what it&#39;s supposed to mean? I see that it is!<br><br>2/ I&#39;d probably reverse the order, and come up with <i>Nenvain</i>. That keeps the emphasis on the first syllable, where it belongs, and looks better than <i>Bainen</i>, which feels like half a word. And... well, it <i>sounds like</i> a name - NEN-vine. You can imagine an irate parent yelling it: &quot;Nenvain! NENvain! Come and tidy your <i>talan</i> this instant!&quot;<br><br>4/ So-AH-ke is right, and... yeah, actually I like that, now I say it. It&#39;s got that lovely clicky pause before the last syllable. It also reminds me of <i>Foalуcл</i>, one of the Quenya words for &#39;dragon&#39;. I take back what I said about Sindarin - keep that version.<br><br>5/ I&#39;m pretty sure turning a vowel into a dipthong is frowned on, yeah. &#39;-er&#39; appears to be based on Sindarin &#39;кr&#39;, the number one, which shows up in prefixes as Er-, &#39;lone&#39;. For that matter, I can&#39;t find any trace of &#39;bara&#39; in Ardalambion Sindarin, though it&#39;s closely related to <i>baran</i>, &#39;yellow-brown&#39;. It could also be a mutated version of <i>paran</i>, &#39;smooth&#39;. So yeah, I wouldn&#39;t allow either of those. &#39;My&#39; should indeed be &#39;nнn&#39;, though it could also appear as a suffix &#39;-en&#39;. This is Grelvish all the way.<br><br>6/ Ahahahahaha. Yep, you&#39;re right. Actually there is a Sindarin word glossed as &#39;dear&#39; - <i>mail</i> (or <i>mell</i> or <i>muin</i>) - but my guess is that it&#39;s &#39;Dear so-and-so&#39;, and taken from Tolkien&#39;s letters.<br><br>Basically: it&#39;s all Grelvish, and it makes my elvish heart cry. If you need a Grelvish expert to call up or bring in for a consult, I&#39;ll note here that Agent Huinesoron is fluent in it. One assumes SIELU also have specialists - but on the other hand, I&#39;m not sure any right-minded SIELU agent would want to learn it...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Disclaimer: my Sindarin is based on the <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">Ardalambion</a> model. If you have a different source, you may find some differences.<br><br><b>Tharellien:</b> &#39;Thar&#39; (as in &#39;Thargelion&#39;) is <i>beyond</i>, indeed, but I&#39;m not sure where &#39;ell&#39; came from? You might be thinking of &#39;el&#39;, <i>star</i>, but <i>heaven</i> is &#39;menel&#39;. That provides the name &#39;Tharvenel&#39;, but honestly I wouldn&#39;t use something that reminds me of an STD. <i>Beyond the Stars</i> would be &#39;Tharelin&#39; or &#39;Thariliath&#39; (though that latter is a bit dubious... depending on how you parse it, it may need to be &#39;Tharngiliath&#39;, but that&#39;s not a word any self-respecting elf would use).<br><br>A vowel-heavy ending on &#39;Tharelin&#39; wouldn&#39;t work too well... if you&#39;ll accept a singular star, you could have &#39;Tharelien&#39;, <i>One from Beyond a Star</i> - you could even keep the double-L, since it doesn&#39;t change the way it&#39;s said. There&#39;s also the word <i>gilwen</i>, which refers to the starry dome of the sky (it&#39;s Q. &#39;Ilmen&#39;), so &#39;Tharngilwen&#39; would work, is pronounceable, and even comes with a built-in feminine ending (so can actually translate back as &#39;Lady from Beyond a Star&#39;).<br><br><b>Gerfinneth:</b> &#39;ger&#39; seems to be a corruption of &#39;gaer&#39;, meaning <i>coppery</i> - but also meaning <i>sea</i> and <i>awe-inspiring</i>. Regrettably the other <i>coppery</i> word, &#39;ross&#39;, has its own homophones (<i>foam</i> and <i>glitter</i>(!)).<br><br>&#39;find&#39; is obviously our old friend <i>hair</i> (specifically a head of it); it would usually show up in compounds as &#39;fin&#39;, but the double &#39;n&#39; makes sense. &#39;f&#39; doesn&#39;t mutate, so that&#39;s a plus.<br><br>&#39;-eth&#39;... well, it shows up as &#39;out of&#39; before a th. I&#39;m not really sure where this suffix is coming from, but it seems like a reasonable contraction of &#39;elleth&#39; (and &#39;Gerfinelleth&#39; is too long, and &#39;Gerfilleth&#39; just doesn&#39;t look right). &#39;Gaerfinneth&#39; is the more correct spelling, but y&#39;know, vowels... so overall, I&#39;m inclined to give you this one. It looks better than &#39;Gerfineth&#39;, certainly.<br><br><b>Overall:</b> So she&#39;s using her mother-name and an after-name? Not a problem, but it sparks the question of <i>why</i> she has the after-name. It&#39;s fairly nondescript, even if it is a near cognate to &#39;Russandol&#39; (hi, Maedhros!). Usually when afternames are used they seem to be either:<br><br>-A nickname among friends, as indeed &#39;Russandol&#39; was.<br>-Highly personally or politically significant, as in Elu Thingol &#39;the Grey-Cloak&#39; (ie, Lord of the Sindar), Finrod Felagund &#39;the Hewer of Caves&#39;, or of course Luthien Tinuviel &#39;my husband gave me this name, and if you complain you&#39;ll find out exactly why the Powers of West and North alike bent to my will&#39;.<br>-The only name they use, as with... well, most of the Noldor, technically, but let&#39;s cite Galadriel and, uh, Maedhros again as examples.<br><br>So is &#39;Gerfinneth&#39; what her friends call her (&#39;Oy, Gingernut!&#39;)? Or is she somehow significant for her red hair (being a descendent of Mahtan would probably do that), or is she  normally Gerfinneth unless things are getting plotty?<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Actually, writing it over and over, &#39;Gerfinneth&#39; is starting to bother me. It&#39;s... I dunno, it just feels like it&#39;s too weak before that &#39;rf&#39; cluster there. Compare &#39;Glorfindel&#39;, where there&#39;s a nice solid &#39;Gl&#39; to start you off; here, it&#39;s just a bit weak.<br><br>Actually, &#39;Gerfindeth&#39; might make it a bit better; it places the emphasis clearly on &#39;find&#39; - ger-FIND-eth - which is where it should be. I&#39;d probably go with that.<br><br>(&#39;Gaerfindeth&#39; - no, that&#39;s clearly a Welsh castle. Stick with &#39;ger&#39;)</p>

            <p>(This is the model I used: <a href="http://www.realelvish.net/"><a href="http://www.realelvish.net/">http://www.realelvish.net/</a></a>)<br><br>1) I would indeed accept a singular star in <i>Tharelien</i>, that name keeps a similar idea to the one I look for and sounds practically the same.<br><br>2) I do indeed like more the sound of <i>Gerfindeth</i>, in fact, that was my original plan!<br><br>Actually she would be using her father-name, mother-name and an after-name, so her full name would be <i>Elanoriel Tharelien Gerfindeth</i> (I decided not give her a chosen-name because laziness). Which one will be used, depends on the point in time of the story; for example, the after-name will not be used during the earlier chapters, because she would not have received it yet. <br><br>And that brings me to the next point, has an after-name because all the three reasons! In all seriousness though, her after-name will be kind of a business-name for strangers and co-workers, kind of like Aragorn&#39;s <i>Strider</i>. How she gets it... Well that would be <i>[SPOILERS!]</i>, and I cannot say those here...<br></p>

            <p>I can barely think of a handful who even used <i>two</i> names. In fact, let&#39;s see:<br><br>Finrod Felagund (always top of my list ^_^)<br>Luthien Tinuviel<br>(Possibly) Aredhel Ar-Feiniel<br>Idril Celebrindal<br>Elrond Peredhil<br>(Ereinion) Gil-Galad<br>Arwen Undomiel<br>Um...<br>Legolas Thranduilion?<br>Elu Thingol (duh)<br>Oh! Beleg Cuthalion<br>And...<br>Um...<br>... yeah.<br><br>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve missed someone/s, but even so. That&#39;s ten characters; one of them&#39;s a &#39;son of Thranduil&#39;, one (Gil-Galad) <i>barely</i> qualifies, and one (Aredhel) we never see them written together. According to Middle-earth Statistics, there are <a href="http://lotrproject.com/statistics/">98 named elves</a> in the Legendarium.<br><br>Most commonly, the Eldar would take either their father- or mother-name (and there&#39;s no evidence they even had both outside Valinor, interestingly), and - when it was significant - would add an <i>epesse</i> of one kind or another. Stringing names together in a long line... wasn&#39;t really done. I mean, <i>yes,</i> the first son of Feanor and Nerdanel technically had the names &#39;Nelyafinwe Matimo Maedhros Russandol&#39; - but he only used the one.<br><br>As for the &#39;business name&#39; concept... as Aragorn points out in the book, he was <i>given</i> the name Strider by the folk of Bree. He doesn&#39;t use it by particular choice, though he grows quite fond of it when he keeps getting it from the hobbits. There&#39;s no indication that he regularly gave his name - or, if he did, that he gave it as anything other than <i>Aragorn</i>.<br><br>More generally, the only real reason people in Middle-earth hide their names is when they&#39;re... hiding them! Aragorn was <i>Thorongil</i>, &#39;the Eagle of the Star&#39;, in Gondor in his youth, because revealing himself to be Isildur&#39;s Heir in front of the Steward wouldn&#39;t exactly have been politic (and that &#39;Ar-&#39; prefix is very iconic of that family). Turin, famously, tried to hide his name everywhere he went - but it didn&#39;t work.<br><br>Luthien once claimed to be Thuringwethil, and Finrod claimed to be an orc - but that was disguise. In fact, the <i>only</i> elves I know of to have deliberately kept their names hidden... were Celegorm and Curufin, when they entrapped Luthien. They&#39;re... not a good role model.<br><br>And... well, see what I said about magic. When Luthien was enchanting her hair, she did it by <i>naming</i> the various things she was drawing on. If you try to disavow your own name - won&#39;t you become less &#39;yourself&#39;? And among the Eldar, quite literally the most grounded people in Arda, that&#39;s a terrifying idea. I&#39;d be willing to guess they told ghost stories about houseless spirits who had been wandering so long, they&#39;d forgotten their own names...<br><br>(Which also explains why Feanor made such a fuss over renaming Melkor as &#39;the Dark Enemy of the World&#39;. Is it significant that he was never able to assume a fair form after that point? Nah... can&#39;t be... right?)<br><br>((ALSO: &#39;you all thought I was merely Axabras, but in secret I am [DRAMATIC CHORD] Inuska!!!&#39; is a very Suvian scene which should be avoided at all costs. Remember how early we&#39;re given Aragorn&#39;s true name?))<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Actually, at no point of the story I planned to string the names like that, is only used for reference in notes outside the story. The names in-story would be used like this:<br><br>1) <i>Elanoriel</i> is the most used one, in fact is the one which she uses to present herself, and therefore those who know her will use this name for her.<br><br>2) Come to think about, she <i>never</i> uses <i>Tharelien</i>, in the one-and-a-half chapters I have written so far, the name is used exactly <i>once</i> (In comparison, the name above is used at least 20 times) and only her mother calls her like that. And her mother will stop appearing after Chapter II. (Coming to think about it, I could totally drop this name.) <br><br>3) <i>Gerfindeth</i> is a nickname she grew fond of, and thus &quot;adopted&quot;. Therefore, would be used by those who aren&#39;t well acquainted with her. This one has yet to appear in-story and wonґt appear until Chapter IV. <br><br>(Note 1: Thanks for reminding me that bit about Aragorn, it has been a while since I read the book, <i>like about 10 years</i>. I really should buy them, but I&#39;m poor. XD)<br><br>(Note 2: &quot;business-name&quot; was the first thing that came to my mind when I tried to explain myself and as I have discovered; wasnґt exactly the correct choice of words. Sorry, English is not my first language. =P)</p>

            <p><i>Elanoriel</i> bothers me. I can&#39;t really come up with an instance of that kind of naming in any Eldarin culture. More likely would be a name that has the same meaning, but not the same sound - &#39;Anorel&#39; would work by itself, or &#39;Anorelien&#39;. You could also switch to the alternate words for &#39;sun&#39; and &#39;star&#39;, which are Naur and Gоl. Gоlnoriel might work (yes, apparently &#39;naur&#39; becomes &#39;-nor&#39; in most compounds), or Narilien (though technically that should be &#39;Narngilien&#39;, which isn&#39;t very nice).<br><br>O&#39;course, I can&#39;t stop you either way, and this is all my opinion on what &#39;feels right&#39; - there&#39;s nothing technically flawed about &#39;Elanoriel&#39;. I just don&#39;t like it. ^_^<br><br>I&#39;d agree with dropping &#39;Tharelien&#39; entirely - there&#39;s no need to make a story extra-confusing Just Because, and insisting on using a name your child has chosen to let slide is a mark of pretty bad parenting - as in, Feanor did it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I chose that name because I was looking for some kind of flower-related name (apparently <i>elanor</i> is some kind of flower) and none of the compounds used for <i>loth</i> &quot;sound right&quot; for me.<br><br>And to be fair, her parents are very <i>bad</i> parents, and thereґs no way this could go wrong.

            <p>Specifically, the golden &#39;Star-Sun&#39;, or <i>elanor</i>, bloomed east of the Sea only in the land of Lorien. I believe they also grew in Numenor, back in the day. Sam Gamgee named his daughter after them (hobbits having a thing for flower names).<br><br>But... again, I can&#39;t come up with a canonical Elda named after... well, I don&#39;t even need to say &#39;a flower&#39;; how about &#39;a species&#39;? Or even &#39;a specific object&#39; (as opposed to a general one like &#39;star&#39;).<br><br>(This is technically untrue - Finduilas of Nargothrond was nicknamed &#39;Faelivrin&#39; by her fiance, which means &#39;sunlight on the pools of Ivrin&#39;. But that&#39;s an <i>epesse</i> <s>and Gwindor was an incurable romantic</s>, not a birth-name.<br><br>Like I say - there&#39;s nothing that says you can&#39;t be named after a type of flower. But it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever seen. (And leaving aside everything else, readers will assume you named her after Elanor Gamgee... ^_~)<br><br>Flower names, flower names... you&#39;ve said she&#39;s a Third Age character, so let&#39;s try for local colour.<br><br><u>Rivendell</u><br>I&#39;d love a compound based on <i>imloth</i>, &#39;flowering valley&#39;, here. Imlothiel might work well by itself, even, or Imlothwen. You could use the other variant of <i>loth</i> - <i>loss</i> - and pull out Imlossiel. Of the three, I think I like Imlothwen (&#39;maid from the flowering valley&#39;) most.<br><br><u>Lorien</u><br>I really wanted to go for &#39;secret blossom&#39; here, but unfortunately the words for &#39;secret&#39; are things like <i>dolen</i>, <i>hall</i>, <i>thurin</i>, which don&#39;t make very female-sounding names. So instead, let&#39;s draw on the defining feature of Lorien and go with Malhilith - &#39;silver gleam from gold&#39;. That encapsulates a <i>mallorn</i> well, I think.<br><br><u>Mirkwood</u><br>Obviously we need &#39;forest&#39; in here, and to avoid ripping off Tauriel, we need it as <i>-daur-</i>. I quite like Tuidaurwen, or Tuidauriel - &#39;forest bud maid&#39;. It&#39;d be said &#39;twi-DOW&#39;R-iel&#39;. I&#39;d probably go for the latter, purely because I can&#39;t get the w to actually come out in &#39;-daurwen&#39;.<br><br>For either of the forest realms, you could also have Calenloth, &#39;green blossom&#39;, giving overtones of &#39;unripe&#39;. The -th gives it a soft enough feel to work for a woman despite the o.<br><br><u>The Grey Havens</u><br>I really like the sound of Sireirin, &#39;daisies of the river&#39;, but unfortunately compounding them makes it look like &#39;sire&#39; (it&#39;s sir-eirin). Lirfalas, &#39;song of the shoreline&#39;, isn&#39;t flower-related at all, but I like it anyway. Actually, &#39;Lireirin&#39;, &#39;song of the daisies&#39;, might work - but again, that -re- cluster breaks the reading up too much. I can&#39;t pull a decent name out of this combination, I&#39;m afraid.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I meant to ask you about this a while ago, but how well would cannons work against something like Sauron in corporeal form? It&#39;s for the early-gunpowder-weaponry-in-Arda thing. I mean, you don&#39;t exactly have to worry about a cannonball dissolving, but case and canister would probably be ineffectual. Roundshot and rocket-fire all the way. =]</p>

            <p>I mean, Sauron showed repeatedly that he was vulnerable to disembodiment: Huan was able to threaten him with it, the fall of Numenor achieved it, and so did <i>Isildur</i>. It&#39;s not that hard to bump off Sauron&#39;s physical body.<br><br>The difficulty is making him stay that way. &#39;Involuntary separation from the One Ring&#39; is the tried-and-true method - the fall of Numenor was less effective because Sauron either left the Ring in Mordor, or wasn&#39;t actually separated from it.<br><br>So yeah - blow up his hand, and you can probably put Sauron down for a couple of thousand years, provided you (this is entirely speculative) claim the Ring and deprive him of his power source. Just remember that no cannon ever built can damage the One.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Canon Library was dark - of course it was. That was the way the Canon Librarian preferred it, and since he had managed to obtain absolute authority in his own domain, no-one was prepared to argue.<br><br>Admittedly, that was because they figured he&#39;d threatened, intimidated, or blackmailed the Flowers into letting him run the place his own way. If people knew that he&#39;d actually just sulked at them until they gave in, he probably wouldn&#39;t be quite so respected.<br><br>But it was dark - the kind of darkness that comes from spending your life in a perpetual inner gloom, and then having that magnified by certain supernatural events the Canon Librarian preferred not to think about. The sole denizen of the Library sat, peacefully reading, in what was halfway between a den and a nest. And then someone opened the door, and electric light burned in.<br><br>The Canon Librarian dropped his book in shock. Not at the fact that someone was intruding on his peaceful domain - <i>that</i> happened often enough - but at the twin facts that the agent was some sort of lion thing with sparks of electricity flying off its fur - and that it wasn&#39;t waiting at the door, but coming straight inside.<br><br>The Canon Librarian&#39;s usual technique was to snap, &#39;What?&#39;, but that didn&#39;t seem enough this time. Getting to his feet, he growled out, &quot;What exactly do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;<br><br>Or rather, he tried to growl; it came out as more of a squeak. Regardless, the creature looked into the shadows, blinked, and said, &quot;Uh, reading?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Reading.&quot; The Canon Librarian managed to get his voice under control. &quot;And what, exactly, makes you think that <i>this</i> is a place to read? Does this look like a library to you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh...&quot;<br><br>&quot;... shut up. Just. Shut up.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&#39;Hey, hS, I&#39;ve noticed you seem to be responding to a lot of stories with ficlets of late. What gives?&#39;<br><br>Well asked, dear reader. I was remembering the days of the DCPS, when case-workers would respond to missions featuring their charges, and I thought: hey, why can&#39;t the Infrastructure agents under my aegis do the same thing? I enjoy writing, PPCers in general enjoy reading - what&#39;s to lose? And thus, this happened.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Every couple of years, someone starts down this line of thinking, and pretty quickly ends up deciding that every deity, powered being, and generally likable character in their fandoms would know about the PPC, and probably also be OOC resistant and and and.<br><br>And then someone (not usually me, which clearly indicates there&#39;s something wrong with the universe) comes along and points out that 1/ that&#39;ll make for really boring missions, 2/ that&#39;ll require every writer to be aware of that, 3/ that&#39;ll cause calamity if/when they decide to visit HQ, 4/ shouldn&#39;t that be kept for really special characters, and 5/... well, there&#39;s probably a 5, and maybe more than that, too.<br><br>Personally, I&#39;m convinced by reason 1 alone: every mission in that continuum would be either rendered unnecessary (Character X knows about the badfic, and being nice, will deal with it) or ridiculously hazardous (Character Y knows about the badfic, and being nasty, will aid it). But throw in on top of that the fact that the canon <i>doesn&#39;t</i> notice badfic effects - otherwise every mission would consist of every single canon fighting against the effect, and running off the moment they&#39;re out of the plot. Which they don&#39;t. They accept the intrusion as &#39;part of the world&#39; - because at the time, it is.<br><br>So yeah, Character Z may well be able to see everything ever - but since she&#39;ll register Mary-Sue Z-Prime as being supposed to be there, that doesn&#39;t help any, and since she&#39;ll be subject to the same canon-cloaking as every other canon character, she won&#39;t notice the agents, either.<br><br>And then the badfic will be dealt with, and everything will revert, as it always has. ^_^<br><br>hS<br><br>(My favourite take on this, for the record, is the idea that Sherlock Holmes independently <i>deduces</i> the existence of the PPC... every single time he encounters it. Because of course he does)</p>

            <p>However, there is a slight difference here. In the case of Shaeogorath and Hermaeus Mora, they are Daedra. Basically demons. They either would not care about the presence of badfic, or actively try to aid it. Well, who knows with Shaeogorath. He is the Prince of Madness, after all. Luckily, he tends not to do much if not summoned. So, no fear of boring missions in that continuum. <i>Expecially</i> if Shaeogorath gets interested.<br><br>Now, in the case of the Aedra, it does not matter if they can sense badfic or not. Elder Scrolls gods have very limited power, due to it being spent keeping the world from being dissolved into Oblivion. They can grant blessings to mortals, but short of that... Not much. So, if they could sense the badfic, the most they could do is grant agents minor blessings. I agree that the Aedra probably should not be able to sense Mary Sues and badfic, but even if they could, it would not affect the mission all that much.</p>

            <p>I insinuated that Hermaeus Mora may actually get involved in the badfic. The thing with Mora is, he does not care about much of anything, except the acquisition of knowledge, spending his time looking through his books and finding particularly talented individuals with new knowledge. He just would not bother with badfics, even if they directly involve him. He has many aspects, one of them will handle it. <br><br>I am sure the PPC has made some sort of deal with him. Perhaps giving him various amounts of canon knowledge, so he would not be interested in harvesting the minds of agents while on mission. If he were interested in the study of Mary Sues and other Suevian characters, he would have killed one and observed it long ago. You have nothing to fear from Herma Mora. Well, unless you summon him... But then you know what you are signing up for.</p>

            <p>The Time Lord, with long tied dark brown hair and dressed with a green suit and a red tie; was checking the instruments in one of the Central Console’s panels, when he saw a small humanoid figure running under the Central Console. “Hmm...” he mused and scowled slightly, then reached under the Console to grab the small figure.  Once he managed to grab it, he raised the tiny human, pinching her clothes between his fingers,  while the 2-inch tall girl with short unruly brown hair,  who constantly swung a crowbar scaled to her size, shouting <i>“Let me go,”</i>  with a high pitched voice, fitting her size.<br><br>The Time Lord narrowed his eyes “Who or what are...” He started to ask, and then realization hit him, “Wait! You’re a mini!” His eyes opened at full. “Wait... Why I’m a Time Lord for that matter?” He shrugged “Eh, whatever.  Wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff.” He carefully placed the mini on the Console, and started moving controls and pushing buttons seemingly at random on the panels.  Once he finished, and returned to the starting panel, grabbed a lever and looked at the mini, “So, Tiny One, ready for a ride?” he said and then pushed the lever with a <i>“Yeehah!”</i><br> <br>Meanwhile Iximax was [insert action here] in [insert place here], when a large wooden box with a weird antenna flashing with red lights, materialized with a violet glow. Then the weird-looking guy above described, opened a door and stepped out of the box.  He looked at Iximax, took her hand and carefully placed the mini on her hand. “Here is the mini-Agent ‘Rina Davies’. Since that due to her size she is not able to use the batarang, I got to ask you that you should give said gadget to the Agent Sabrina Elizabeth ‘Rina’ Dives.” He clasped his hands at his back, “So, without any further adieu, I have other matters to attend to.”  He turned around and went back into the TARDIS, which then de-materialized with a violet glow, while Boarder and mini watched with a [insert reaction here] gaze.<br></p>

            <p>Considering that the Dragonborn/<i>Dovahkiin</i> is by him/herself a Canon Stu/Sue, and pretty much depends on player input for his/her personality, so he/she can be a softie, a jerk, or a downright psychopath, weeell the protagonist&#39;s personality is quite a non-issue here. Also, the NPC canons aren&#39;t that OOC (with one exception, see below).<br><br>On the other hand, in the few chapters that I read; her stupid name is an affront to all Nords, creates 2 minis (the second one a mini-Sue!), and to top it off, somehow she suddenly knows Savos Aren with no good explanation and throws him off OOC for good measure.<br><br>(Now that I put that way, it does sound quite bad, and somehow I get the feeling that later gets worse... But I&#39;m not reading those 50 chapters.)</p>

            <p>Is spawning a mini from not capitalizing a proper noun a relatively new thing, or has that always been since minis were first created? I feel like I&#39;ve been seeing that more and more recently. I&#39;m a little bothered by it, to tell the truth. It feels like an artificial way to create minis. Mini creations should be reserved for legitimate misspellings, like Boromire or Herminoe. I would argue that improper capitalization is more an error of punctuation.<br><br>Beyond my request for clarification, what are your thoughts on this? Am I just being weird about this?</p>

            <p>Yeah, I agree. For me it feels a bit silly to get minis from failing to capitalize. It nice to know I&#39;m not the only one who have had that thought.<br>I don&#39;t write minis who spawn that way. I either charge for not using proper capitalization or for general abuse of SPaG if there are other mistakes and leave it at that.<br><br>I feel the same way about minis created by using plural rather than possessive s. And minis created by missing commas. Long Table Elrond is a superfun creation and much more interesting than simply going &#39;and there&#39;s another mini&#39;.</p>

            <p>A lot of what happens on missions probably depends on perception, like Huinesoron suggested further down. If I ever get to writing missions, my agents will certainly not expect to see capitalization or punctuation minis, so they will probably never find any. But they will think very hard about which pieces of PPC technology are powered by phlebotinum or are at least sufficiently undefined to function at Hogwarts.<br><br>BTW, the Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies needs to talk to you.

            <p>I think it depends on the punctuation error. I did that in one mission that had horrible punctuation, but the reason was largely because I wanted to include a scene of dumping a pack of minis on the adoption center, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d do it again, because they make punctuating while writing about them difficult.  <br><br>How do you make a list of these: <br><br>Cane,Helen<br>Way;Helen<br>You,Helen<br>Gym;John<br>It,John<br><br>You really can&#39;t, especially since it was a mix of semi-colons and commas. <br><br>The one named John Dont (missing apostrophe, added capital) was a much better mini, I think, even though it was largely based on punctuation, too. Big Guys and Helens aren&#39;t too bad either, although those could have been taken as errors that created copies, none of which owned whatever it was the possessive was being used for in the story.<br><br>Anyway, my point is that like capitalization minis most punctuation minis end up causing headaches for the PPC writer trying to not begin a sentence with that non-capped mini-ever, or to punctuate a mini who has stray commas in its name. </p>

            <p>On the one hand, incorrect orthography is incorrect. I think we&#39;d certainly have a mini on our hands if someone messed up the capitalization in the middle of a name. For example, FrOdo would be a Frodo mini, and I&#39;d certainly consider D&#39;argo to be a D&#39;Argo mini.<br><br>On the other hand, I don&#39;t ever want to be in a position of having to weigh clearly referring to a mini vs. a real character against correctly capitalizing the first word of a sentence. Damn you, capitalization, and your ambiguous place in spelling/grammar.<br><br>Ultimately, I think I&#39;m with hS on this one.

            <p>It&#39;s been around for at least a few years now, but it <i>does</i> feel pretty silly. (Note that <a href="http://misssandman.com/LOTR/Minis.txt">Miss Cam doesn&#39;t list any</a>)<br><br>But... well, given that no-one&#39;s reading the original fic, I just ignore minis I don&#39;t want in my stories (big reveal, that ^_^). As long as people don&#39;t keep adding them just as word-drops, but actually <i>use</i> their minis, I think it&#39;s justifiable as artistic licence.<br><br>Or, and this is a personal theory, mini manifestation is linked to perception anyway. If someone thinks lowercase should make a mini, it does. If they think it shouldn&#39;t, it won&#39;t. And if they&#39;re not aware that minis form, they won&#39;t see them at all.

            <p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but not capitalizing &quot;house&quot; isn&#39;t uniformly wrong. I mean, yes, House Gryffindor, Slytherin House, etc., but Professor McGonagall helpfully covers a lot of contexts in which it&#39;s <i>not</i> capitalized: &quot;The four <b>houses</b> are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each <b>house</b> has its own noble history ... . While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your <b>house</b> points, while any rule-breaking will lose <b>house</b> points. At the end of the year, the <b>house</b> with the most points is awarded the <b>house</b> cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever <b>house</b> becomes yours&quot; (<i>Sorcerer&#39;s Stone</i>, Scholastic Press, 1998, p. 114, emphasis added).<br><br>It seems to be generally pretty inconsistent, in fact. Snape is &quot;Head of Slytherin House&quot; (135), but at the end of the book, Dumbledore says &quot;I award Gryffindor house fifty points&quot; (305) a few times.<br><br>Maybe they changed it in later books/editions, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got right in front of me in the first place I&#39;d choose to look.

            <p>First, and foremost, well done. I like your writing style, and your agents fascinate me so. I find it interesting how Rayner <i>hates</i> badfic characters with such a passion, while if Marvin and Printworthy were to find him in a fic, they would probably jump for the kill. A human male Rainbow Dash that eats meat? Sounds like a Stu to me! That said, he is very fun to read. You have definitely expanded his character beyond what I would expect from such Gary Stus. I look forward to reading more about him in the future. <br><br>As for E.V.(i)L? She is the near perfect opposite of Rayner, in almost every way. She is sympathetic to badfic characters, he wants to see them all hang; she is light and highly magical, he is bulky with minor magic; the obvious male, female; and other contradictions. This provides wonderful opportunities for conflict. However, they will have to learn to at least respect each other before all too long. Two agents that hate each other and will always hate each other gets old after a while. I&#39;m not saying they need to like each other in the next mission or anything, but do keep this in mind.<br><br>Now, mission itself. I already stated how I did not see how this mission should exist. The fic was bad, no question, and it was good to see it go. However, I am just not sure a PPC mission was the way to go about it. An MST? Particularly scathing review, ala Nostalgia Critic? I don&#39;t know. I do like the character exploration that goes on in this fic, however.<br><br>The minis are questionable, to say the least. I grumbled, but accepted that creepers should not be capitalized, and could make a mini. Fine. However, all of the others? They are not names. They are descriptions of enchantments. I may be wrong, but if somebody said something like <i>Wingardleiam Levyosa</i> in a badfic, it would not cause a mini. This is a grammar/spelling error, but not one that would cause minis. At least, in my view. How appropriate we have a topic discussing this very issue just a little further down on the page.<br><br>Now, onto more positive comments, as I do have a lot of them. First, I see you watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqKT5R2PXlw">Game Theory.</a> Creepers are plants that explode to spread seeds? Yeah, I know where you got that theory.<br><br>Salvo, now there is an interesting character. A creeper spy? We just have to make sure he does not feel threatened, or things could go real bad, real quick. I do like him though. Is it bad that I imagine him as dressed like a mob boss? Blocky cigar hanging out of his mouth, black suit, the works. Given his love for blue crystals, perhaps it would be best to keep him away from Breaking Bad badfic. Just saying... You know, all of the recruiting these two do will either give Rayner and E.V.L. all sorts of vacation time, or on the Sunflower Official&#39;s blacklist. We shall see.<br><br>Speaking of Salvo, I liked how E.V.L. was dead-set on recruiting him. You can just see her wanting to give these characters a second chance, not unlike herself. Oh, she may think she wants to kill them all, but deep down, she hopes she can be of use to somebody. ...Well, that or she is building an arly of badfic characters to take down the PPC. Either way, we will have to keep an eye on her.<br><br>Beyond that, I don&#39;t have much to say, other then well done. I like your style, and while Rayner may edge a little close on the Stu scale for my comfort, I look forward to reading more from these two.</p>

            <p>I am more sorry than I can tell you for not responding to this sooner - my graduate paper has been sticking its metaphorical foot so far up my ass that I have to clean its metaphorical toejam off my teeth every morning. It should be mostly done, though, with some final reviews, so that should give me more time to take care of certain other things.<br><br>Anyway, can I squee? Yes? All righty then, SQUEEEEEEEEE! THANK YOU SO MUCH! I was so worried about this agent pair when I started out, especially because Rayner was brought in specifically to flesh out that awful mission that led Rashida to transfer to Floaters, but I am happy to see that he&#39;s coming out quite nicely. Ditto with E.V.L., who is actually an OC in one of my original story projects whom I figured would be worth exploring a little more by bringing her in as well. I do think the two of them will come to an understanding eventually, though of course it&#39;ll take a little while - especially since they&#39;re working towards a common goal.<br><br>I&#39;ll concede that the enchantment mini-creepers may have been overdoing it <i>just</i> slightly, but then again this is the PPC&#39;s first Minecraft mission, so it&#39;s natural to set some rules here. I&#39;ll keep the whole enchantment deal in mind if I ever revisit this continuum again, though!<br><br>I don&#39;t actually watch Game Theory (again, my graduate paper is my schedule&#39;s worst enemy), but I do go on the Minecraft Wiki every once in a while - and when I read that Notch described the physical texture of creepers as being plant-like, that was the first thing that came to my head. Coincidence, I swear! XD<br><br>Funny thing - PPC!Salvo is actually a bit of a composite character, because I had a creeper OC named Salvo back in my DeviantArt days who was coincidentally a lot like Number One, but I never got around to using him before leaving that site. Number One being the leader of an underground society of sentient talking creepers (and wearing a diamond helmet besides) made me think of dA!Salvo almost immediately, and though it was again almost entirely coincidental, I liked the similarity enough to apply dA!Salvo&#39;s character to Number One - not that it would have been a very big step.<br><br>I think E.V.L.&#39;s logic in recruiting an arly - sorry, <b>army</b> - of badfic characters rather than killing them is a bit like fighting fire with fire. She knows what they&#39;re like and she knows that they can do better, so why not have them turn against the badfics that created them? Or the Sues/Stus of those fics, for that matter, due to these characters being created specifically because of their existence? That&#39;s actually my way of thinking as well - if there&#39;s enough of a personality for this bit character (or even this Sue) to be developed into a more well-rounded individual, then it would be a worthwhile investment to recruit him or her. I&#39;m probably going to have to stop trying to stock up on recruits after the next solo mission I&#39;m posting, though - I recruited no less than four characters from that badfic, more than in all of my previous solo missions put together.<br><br>Once again, thank you for the kind words as well as the constructive criticism - they&#39;re both really helpful for moving forward with my writing. And with that, I leave you with my celebratory squee of gratitude. SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~!</p>

            <p>I... eh. There&#39;s a few things about this mission which just bug me.<br><br>The first is absolutely not your fault, and is actually the reason the mission exists - the talking creepers. That&#39;s... pretty awful, and I&#39;d&#39;ve been tempted to just blow them all up.<br><br>The second thing is... sort of related to that: how exactly do you decide what the &#39;canon&#39; consists of? I mean, canonically, Steve can&#39;t talk, and nothing has any personality, and you make things by putting objects side-by-side on a table-top and then magic. Minecraft... really isn&#39;t a game with a &#39;canon&#39;, particularly given how many mods there are out there. And then some of the little solid information we have - the creeper biology diagram - you reject, for... no real reason?<br><br>And... yeah. That said, the agent interactions were fun - it&#39;s more the very concept of the mission that I can&#39;t get to grips with.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: On the offchance that VixenMage reads this - any chance of a quick reaction from Jof on meeting Salvo for the first time?</p>

            <p>Technically, missions are written to protect &quot;the canon&quot;, and that Minecraft doesn&#39;t have much canon. So what to do when we find a badfic in Minecraft?<br><br>All we know is this:<br>There&#39;s a world with widely spaced, low-tech villages whose inhabitants never leave. Magic exists, but only witches use it and then only to throw potions. Animals and monsters exist. There are ruined temples and mine shafts, implying that the tech level used to be higher than it is now. Two alternate dimensions exist. Except for horses, nothing has a gender. Physics works differently. The third wall is broken when the player kills the ender dragon, revealing that Minecraft is a multiverse with which Real World humans can interact.<br><br>And that&#39;s it, not much more to it than that. Everything else can be filled in with fan fiction. How did those ruined mineshafts get there if the villagers can&#39;t mine? Why are the jungle temples abandoned? Why do creepers blow up? Were the zombies and skeletons once alive? Who invented magic and built the strongholds? Is the blocky world an artifact of our interface, or is that really the way it looks to its inhabitants? Who are those two cosmic beings in the end poem, and what exactly are they smoking?<br><br>That&#39;s the beauty of a world where there&#39;s little canon--you can build your own. But it doesn&#39;t make such stories immune to critique. Fan fiction can be critiqued; original fiction can be critiqued. Fan fiction in a world where the canon is small, is halfway in between, and can be critiqued.<br><br>Just like any story, a story set in Minecraft needs to be well-written both in terms of mechanics and storytelling, logically consistent, with interesting characters. From the mission, this particular story wasn&#39;t actually horrible--but it was cliched, with characters that had very little personality. It&#39;s like something I might have written as a beginner; it&#39;s coherently written, but without much complexity. Everything happens in such a linear fashion that the entire plot can be predicted from the opening scenario. <br><br>When there&#39;s not much canon to defend, you can fall back on the universal rules of good writing. Here, they&#39;re rules like, &quot;Characters should be distinguishable by personality,&quot; and, &quot;Conflict should not be resolved without complications.&quot;<br><br>(A personal sticking point: &quot;Heroic sacrifices are not a silver bullet and do not solve everything.&quot; It&#39;s as though writers think that just being desperate enough to make a sacrifice will automatically and always solve whatever problem a character is facing. In reality, these situations are rare. It&#39;s much more interesting to write a character who can make a heroic sacrifice if it&#39;s needed--but the interesting part comes from writing about a person with that sort of intense, caring, dedicated, or driven personality. The actual sacrifice need never actually occur. For example: Aragorn never actually got himself killed fighting for Middle-Earth, but you knew he wouldn&#39;t hesitate if it were asked of him--especially after he decided that being king is a responsibility he was willing to shoulder. Writing about a character out-of-the-blue dying for something is only melodrama. Instead, try writing about a character who is willing to <i>live</i> for something.)<br><br>A badfic written in a world with little canon is still not immune to critique. If a story is badly written, it&#39;s badly written, and your agents might as well go in and fix it.</p>

            <p>Now, keep this in mind: I do not dislike this mission. It&#39;s rather good, for what it is. That said, I also have to wonder, why does this exist? Minecraft is a (purposefully) very open continuum. It is the most open sandbox game possible. There <i>is</i> no canon. So, why does it matter to protect it? Mini-creepers are cute, but not enough of a reason for the Flowers to waste resources fighting Sues in a world it does not affect.<br><br>Now, if you were to make the argument that allowing Sues to infest this world will allow them to spread en-mass to other worlds, I may be more inclined to accept that.<br><br>All of that aside, I do like the mission. Despite thinking it should not exist, I was very entertained. I will come back at a later time to give a more thorough review.</p>

            <p>To both of you, thanks! I had quite a bit of fun writing this one.<br><br>@Huinesoron: The bits about canonical info are rather flexible, and I&#39;ve just changed up a few things to help keep it consistent with the game (the creeper anatomy thing now being acknowledged, for example). As for why this mission exists, well, see my <strike>excuse</strike> explanation below.<br><br>@World-Jumper: That&#39;s actually a pretty good argument there - and given how much resources you can get from the Minecraft world, I&#39;ve decided that Sues that spawn or hide there could use it as a base of operations to invade other continua (I know of a number of mods that involve some of those being brought in unofficially). The fact that this world is so open may be a good excuse for them to roam and do things with impunity, and prepare for their own stupid stuff behind the backs of the PPC. I think the mini-creepers were just a side-effect of an exploratory mission involving the blandest badfic I&#39;ve read so far.<br>I&#39;ve edited the document accordingly. Thanks for the feedback, guys! :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been studying linguistics in my spare time, and I had the idea of trying to come up with a language history of Glome from the earliest reconstructable proto-language through the present day.<br><br>The canonical masculine suffixes are -in, -ia, and -om. The canonical feminine suffixes are -it, -ra, and -al. Whether this means three separate declensions, or fewer declensions with singulars and plurals (and maybe even a dual number), is not given. The neighboring kingdom of Essur also uses the -al suffix, as seen in the name Talapal.<br><br>As for where: Glome has mountains, and was in the Greek sphere of influence but not part of any of the Greek empires. That gives it a wide range of possibilities.<br><br>And how do I make sure FFN will recognize all the symbols? I figure most people&#39;s computers can display the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets, but some of the special characters needed for the IPA can get turned into boxes or question marks.<br><br>Lastly but most importantly, does FFN allow fictional articles?</p>

            <p>Welcome to the community! For your newbie gift, here&#39;s a Quantum Clown Car. It should be safe, but it doesn&#39;t really like mimes. Stay away from them and it shouldn&#39;t explode!</p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome aBoard! Take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti, and this chirping pocket manatee! If the urple bow around its neck becomes too much, feel free to remove it. ;) <br><br>There is, in fact, a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Troll_Division">Troll Division</a> of the Department of Bad Parody.<br><br>As for <i>Moon Daughter</i>, well... sorry to burst your bubble, but I&#39;ve already claimed it. You can see for yourself <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic#Percy_Jackson">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Thank you everybody! I&#39;m going to need at least 1 magical backpack to hold all the stuff!<br>Please don&#39;t glomp me. <br>I will definitely look into the Troll Division. <br>I didn&#39;t realize about Moon Daughter, I typed it into the wiki, and didn&#39;t get any hits, so I assumed it was free.<br>So, I just hang around here, be nice, and wait my turn, right?</p>

            <p>I assume you&#39;re talking about Permission? If you want to eventually get Permission, might I suggest checking out <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">this Wiki article</a>? It has pretty much everything you need to know. <br><br>But we&#39;re not all about missions here, you know! Just hang out, chat a bit, don&#39;t be afraid to jump in on a discussion. I promise we don&#39;t bite, so no need to be nervous. ;)  (Also, sorry about the glomping. I just love seeing newbies. *offers apology SPaGhetti*)</p>

            <p>Yeah, I&#39;m referring to Permission, I jump the gun a lot so... *accepts apology SPaGhetti* This stuff reminds me of SpagBol...I can never remember how to spell it.</p>
