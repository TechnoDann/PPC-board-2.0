            <p>Altough Rina and Zeb killed the nudist psycho, they didn&#39;t do the cleaning up after her final death, for obvious reasons.

            <p>So if you&#39;re familiar with MST3K, (specifically the Mike era,) you&#39;ll probably remember THE PUMAMAN otherwise known as Thepumaman (pronounced thep-yoo-may-min) a terrible superhero movie that reeked of New Powers as the Plot Demands and molding cheese. I was thinking of having a go at salvaging the (really quite laughable) plot. Does anyone think this is possible?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t understand. Are you talking about possibly doing another riff on that movie or possibly turning that movie&#39;s plot into an actual, well-written story?

            <p><b>AGENTS</b><br>I have a few qualms about the character of Meg. I found her personality to be abrasive, especially when in combination with the prompts. I get that was the point, but I would argue that even the most bristly jackass of a character needs to have some redeeming features (or failing that, be either super interesting in some other way or prone to falling flat on their face). The little &quot;thank you&quot; text didn&#39;t really do enough to endear her to me. I will admit that&#39;s something that would probably come out better in a longer piece, but I&#39;m still bringing it up for you to think about.<br><br>Michelle seemed quite good, although I should note that I know nothing about <i>Kingsman</i>. I like a good &quot;ditzy&quot; character every now and again.<br><br>One more minor thing. It was a little confusing for me to have characters named &quot;Mitchell&quot; and &quot;Michelle.&quot; Is that going to be a plot point later on?<br><br><b>PROMPTS</b><br>&quot;Going Postal&quot; had some technical issues that stuck out to me. The first paragraph, for example, has a sizable run-on sentence that is very clunky to read. The texting was also somewhat problematic, especially in one exchange that occurs without any intermediary text. Since it&#39;s all in italics, it can be a little frustrating to suss out who&#39;s saying what.<br><br>Clarification question: why did Michelle have such a positive reaction to Meg writing &quot;Thanks Mitch&quot;? I would think that being called by Meg&#39;s ex-partner&#39;s name would have the opposite effect.<br><br>I also didn&#39;t understand why Michelle needed to lie in order to see Meg. I don&#39;t see how that would have worked better than saying &quot;I&#39;m her partner, are you sure I can&#39;t see her&quot; or something. Unless she&#39;s trying some sort of escape attempt, which I don&#39;t see working at all.<br><br>The second prompts better, if a bit insubstantial. I feel like there wasn&#39;t enough interaction between the agents before the mission alarm went off. It was also confused why Michelle was clearly referred to as &quot;not Shelly&quot; in the text and yet as Shelly twice in the disclaimer.<br><br>In both prompts, you had several one-sentence paragraphs that did not need to be as such. It&#39;s not a strict grammatical rule, but I&#39;ve always felt that those should really be reserved either for dialogue or something so serious that it needs its own paragraph as a form of emphasis. Otherwise, it can feel out-of-place.<br><br><b>FIC CHOICE</b><br>I know nothing about the <i>Brotherband Chronicles</i>, but I saw more than a number of technical errors while skimming the first few paragraphs. That works for me.<br><br><b>COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION</b><br>No complaints here. Gold star.<br><br>It took no small amount of back-and-forth deliberation, but I&#39;m going to have to say that permission is denied. While your writing shows promise, I feel it needs a bit more technical tightening before you submit again. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

            <p>I could argue that Meg&#39;s loyalty is her redeeming quality, but if she&#39;s coming across as a coldhearted witch then I&#39;m doing it wrong anyway, so I won&#39;t argue because it won&#39;t change anything.<br><br>Kingsman is a fantastic movie and I recommend it wholeheartedly.<br><br>The similarity between Mitchell and Michelle was going to be a plot point. Until then, Michelle will be referred to as &#39;rookie&#39; or &#39;Shelly&#39; by Meg, and Mitchell will be universally referred to as Mitch. I believe my reasoning was something along the lines of &#39;proper names in the files&#39; et cetera.<br><br>Texting is difficult to format and I&#39;m open to any help on that front.<br><br>Michelle had a positive response to that for two reasons, only one of which is in-universe. The first reason is that it&#39;s the first time that Meg has referred to her in a non-degrading way, because Meg is not a nice person. The second reason is because it originally said &#39;rookie&#39; and I didn&#39;t catch the dissonance when I redid it, because I&#39;m a moron. Same prompt different problem - Michelle WAS planning a breakout, but you&#39;re right in that it was a bad, bad idea that I am fixing..<br><br>And finally, I will add more to the second prompt.</p>

            <p>So, how critical is it to read the Halo novels if you&#39;ve read a ton on the wiki(s)? I know that &#39;not reading the books&#39; tends to be a berserk button for many fandoms, but reading is not something I&#39;m good at, especially if it&#39;s printed on normal paper. I&#39;ve played all the games, watched all the film adaptations, and read the one comic I could get. I ask because I&#39;m thinking about having one of my debut agents be a Halo resident, and I need to know if I can write her properly. If not, then I&#39;ll have to go with plan B.<br><br>And, if I do need to read the books, what would be the bare minimum? I&#39;d really like to avoid Glasslands, if at all possible. I have trouble reading books because I can see all the little particles that constitute the paper. Like trying to read stuff surrounded by static. If anyone&#39;s got a solution to that, I&#39;m all ears.</p>

            <p>Thank you for reminding me about them.<br><br>Now, I know the main canon is in the games, but shooting big purple dudes in the face tends to not provide much information about the &#39;verse. I just didn&#39;t know if merely playing the games was enough to write a Halo OC, because of the above-mentioned face-shooty bit. After all, I could write all I wanted about how the Warthog has less grip than WD40, but, to my knowledge, it is actually a very practical vehicle in-universe.<br><br>But maybe I&#39;m over-thinking this.

            <p>Though I guess it didn&#39;t matter in the end, given how the fic went south towards the end of the third act. Sarah is still awesome, though.<br><br>Back on topic, I always thought ROBTD made some pretty neat fanart fuel, but as a fanfic? A LOT harder. Apart from the continua involved taking place in different time periods (Brave and HTTYD may be in the same era, maybe, but RoTG is set in the present day, so that by itself kinda puts a damper on the concept - and that&#39;s nothing to say of including even more fandoms like Frozen, Hotel Transylvania, or Big Hero 6), there&#39;s also what fans do with the characters themselves. I&#39;ve seen a lot of Jack/Rapunzel on Tumblr, along with Merida/Hiccup or Hiccup/Rapunzel. The inherent problem is that two of the four have love interests in canon, and the others may be well on their way to having partners of their own if you take the supporting material into account.<br><br>I guess the only way to go about a fic like that would be an AU, but that&#39;s a whole other can of worms I&#39;d rather not try my hand at again, at least not in writing. For now, I suppose the darn good art that sometimes comes out of this movement will do.<br><br><s>Is it a bad thing that I still ship HiJack, btw?</s></p>

            <p>ROTBTD began its hideously mutated existence as a reaction to the prevalence of SuperWhoLock on fandom blogs that &quot;claimed&quot; (read: vomited all over) non-fandom stuff on Tumblr. Because Tumblr is one of those places where people believe they are always right about everything ever (I fitted in rather well), this led to stuff like ROTBTD attracting a serious fandom rather than the more tongue-in-cheek one it had had previously. See also: the obsessions with Paul Blart, Bee Movie, and Shrek. Me neither.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s gotten worse since I fixed my phone. I can&#39;t really speak for my computers, as I use Adblock Plus on all of them, for anti-virus reasons. At any rate, I hope the T-Board will be usable soon. I keep getting redirected to some rather... risqué pages. None of them seem to contain harmful scripts or other things, beyond the usual ad-targeting stuff. If I find something harmful, I&#39;ll update.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve had times on non-Adblocked-browsing (thank you, university computers) where I get a page full of the same two or three ads repeated again and again. Usually if I two Board pages open and one&#39;s loading, the loading one gets swamped with ads every time I click back to it. Those are pretty rare, though, and I&#39;m not being redirected to the Google Play store every third page on my phone anymore. Mostly it&#39;s just infolinks everywhere. :/</p>

Notable for being hilarious supporting cast members without stealing the show from our hero, Agatha.<br><br><a href="http://thepunchlineismachismo.com">Manly Guys doing Manly Things</a> - Follows the ridiculous shenanigans surrounding Commander Badass (an original character), who runs a facility that helps integrate macho video game characters into real life, Jared Kowalski (either the dumbest or the smartest Pokémon trainer ever), Sarah Jones &quot;Jonesy&quot; (Commander&#39;s girlfriend), and a host of others. I particularly recommend reading the Nomura Syndrome arc and the arc where Commander and Jonsey go back to his generic space future, though the comic itself is great. (Also check out Platinum Black by the same author!)</p>

            <p>First off, Brandon Sanderson. All of his stuff. All of it. I cannot stress how amazing his books are: everyone on here should read them. They are <i>beautiful.</i><br><br><i>The Door Within Trilogy</i> by Wayne Thomas Batson. This is where my handle came from; it&#39;s a Christian YA series, and it had a really deep impact on me. I heartily recommend the audiobooks. They&#39;re read by the author, and they&#39;re really immersive. <br><br><i>The Paper Magician</i> by Charlie Holmberg. This has one of the most interesting magic systems I&#39;ve seen, and a great story to boot. It&#39;s part of a series, which makes it even better. It centers around Ceony Twill, a young magician in the early 1900s (1901, I think) who is forced into learning paper magic, rather than steel, like she wanted. The love story moves a little too quickly, but other than that it&#39;s wonderful. <br><br><i>The Lunar Chronicles</i> by Marissa Meyer. These are futuristic twists on the old fairy tales: now Cinderella is Cinder, a cyborg in a country where being a cyborg makes you second-class, at best, and the entirety of Earth has to deal with the Lunars, a race of advanced humans with terrifying mental abilities. These books are awesome, and the next in the series comes out next month! Yipee!! <br><br>Brandilyn Collins is another Christian author with some really interesting mysteries: <i>Eyes of Elisha</i> was very good, as was her <i>Kanner Lake</i> series. Oh, and <i>Exposure</i>. That one was awesome. <br><br>C.J. Hill, another YA Christian author, and her <i>Slayers</i> series. I also really enjoyed <i>Erasing Time.</i> The first centers around a group of kids who are descendants of knights imbued with special powers for the purpose of fighting dragons, the second is about twin sisters who are dragged forward in time to a dystopian city-state. Both could be better, but I enjoyed them. <br><br>Well, that&#39;s all for me. Oh, and if anyone cares, all of the books are fairly clean. Nothing egregious, anyway. If you read (or have read) any of these, tell me! I have almost no one to talk to about any of them. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p><b>Pure Pwnage:</b> Kind of a weird online video series that flip-flops back and forth between being a mockumentary that criticizes gamer stereotypes and a high-stakes action series that aggrandizes gamers and gives them real world superpowers.  Often within individual episodes.<br><br>Contains lots of swearing and some verbal references to sex, but no nudity, and most of the violence is special effects beams.

The camera work and editing is superb, and really sells the realism of the series.  (It&#39;s sort of fourth wall breaking, as the actual YouTube accounts are also the ones supposedly being used by the characters.)<br><br>Link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MarbleHornets/videos">main series</a>.  (That account has just started a sequel series, so make sure to go to the end and start at the beginning.)  There&#39;s also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/totheark/videos">side account</a> (again, go back to the beginning) where another character sent messages to the protagonists.  Never fear: <a href="http://marblehornets.wikidot.com/the-entries#toc2">here</a> is a list of the two acconuts&#39; videos in upload order, so you can watch in proper revelatory order!</p>

Can be described as <i>X-Men</i>&#39;s grim, better-written little sister.<br><br>-<i>Lord Demon</i> and <i>Lord of Light</i> by Roger Zelazny. No connection despite the similar names. The first is Zelazny&#39;s take on Chinese mythology, the second — on Indian mythology and Buddhism. Both are really well-written, and <i>Lord of Light</i> has a character called Tak the Archivist, AKA Tak of the Bright Spear; what&#39;s not to like?<br><br>-Speaking of Roger Zelazny: everybody needs to read <i>Jack of Shadows</i> now because it&#39;s that awesome. It&#39;s also a short read so you really have no excuse. Seriously, go read it now.</p>

            <p><a href="http://narbonic.com/">Narbonic</a> - a webcomic about a mad scientist named Helen Narbon and her hapless assistant Dave.  The comic is now complete, and it&#39;s really fascinating to watch it build from a mostly light-hearted strip about wacky mad science hijinks to an extremely powerful conclusion, without abandoning the humor on the way.  The art improves dramatically as well.  There&#39;s also a sequel, <a href="http://skin-horse.com/">Skin Horse</a>.  I also find the artist&#39;s commentary on the strips to be an interesting look into the process behind creating a series, though only read it if you&#39;ve already finished the story once.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saya_no_Uta">Saya no Uta</a> - a visual novel that depicts the heartwarming story of a young man who finds true love and rediscovers the beauty of life after a traumatic car accident.  Or alternatively, Gen Urobuchi&#39;s take on the Cthulhu Mythos.  It&#39;s definitely not for everyone; aside from the nearly constant gore, there&#39;s a great deal of explicit, frequently non-consensual, sexual content, and Saya looks like she&#39;s about all of twelve.  But if you can get past that, the story is both horrifying and deeply moving.  It&#39;s also fairly short, only about five hours long.</p>

Her legs seize up and she feels paralyzed from the waist down. Though terrified by the incident, she wants to know if it will happen again. So she sneaks out to go swimming at night, and it turns out, she turns into a mermaid whenever she&#39;s in the water. She befriends another mermaid and together they learn the truth about Emily&#39;s family. (This is the first in a series.)<br><br>They&#39;re both written for middle schoolers, so they&#39;re not <i>the most amazingly amazing thing to ever amaze</i>, but I read them multiple times as a kid and still love them to bits. :)</p>

It&#39;s basically a much bigger boost, with it boosting the damage output of damaging beam moves by 50%, or by 75% in sunlight. Musharna, however, doesn&#39;t learn a lot of moves that can effectively utilize it, but what it <i>does</i> learn is Trick Room. Try a set utilizing that on a Sun team, with Psybeam, Charge Beam, and Signal Beam as the remaining moves. Charge Beam&#39;s a really good move for this set, but it does mean you&#39;re vulnerable to Ground-type switchins. Still, it&#39;s worth a try, so enjoy! =]</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! Sanity, as you might have noticed, is optional.<br>The Original Series and Constitution are required reads; we also have a spiffy Wiki to which you should turn before asking any questions (we like people who do the research). Links are on top of the Board.<br>To answer your unasked question, it looks like you&#39;ve encountered another Egogy knockoff. For some reason people keep ripping Enoby off; maybe they think it&#39;s funny.<br>And, last but not least — have this cup of Earl Grey tea. Leaves aren&#39;t predatory. Promise.</p>

            <p>What&#39;s the connection between assessments and chemicals? I suspect that each assessment has multiple chemicals involved, but are chemicals referenced by multiple assessments?

            <p>Those queries will both give you one row per hazardous chemical in an assessment - if you&#39;re dealing with, say, the unholy child of chlorine trifluoride and nitrogen tetroxide (<i>why would you do that?</i>), you&#39;d get back the id twice, once for the join with FC3 and once for the join with NO4.

            <p>I said we needed to make a page on the PPC Wiki for Wattpad, like the ones in <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Websites">this link.</a> The &quot;Litter Box&quot; comment was because most of the websites we have pages for have funny/insulting names, like the Pit of Voles or the Circle of Lemmings.<br><br>Thanks for making the group, though.

            <p>Hey, aren&#39;t you guys planning a trip over here at some point? I&#39;d be happy to host an Oxford Gathering Redux. (More than happy, frankly - it&#39;s an amazing city.) I don&#39;t think the map will be there next year, but the museum definitely will. ^<em>~<br><br>(Also, the map is actually more legible in the photos than the real world; the advantage of photography, that.

I&#39;ve adjusted for perspective, heightened the contrast, and colour-matched the pieces (approximately! It&#39;s not exactly poster-quality!). I&#39;ve also thrown extra contrast-enhancement on a few of the comments.

            <p>Hopefully next summer, around August/September. Though, one of Phobos&#39; cousins inconveniently decided to get married in Colorado in late July, and I was also hoping to take the opportunity to visit one of MY cousins who lives near to where the wedding is going to be. I know which vacation I&#39;d pick if we can only do one, but since it&#39;s the more expensive of the two, we&#39;ll just have to see. We ought to start tentatively planning and looking at potential costs pretty soon, and then we&#39;ll know more.<br><br>Yeeee, map! Thank you! *hugs*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>((Hello, everyone! Welcome to the first ever PPC Halloween Masquerade! My friend Basil and I will be running this: no Permission is required, all characters (be they PPC-related or your own OCs) are allowed, and the whole shebang will last from October 30th to November 1st. Anyone who wishes to enter the costume contest must do so before November 1st, as the winner will be announced then. Feel free to post a drawing of your character in-costume! There will also be party games and Pokemon battles that anyone can join at any time. Challenge anyone who’s playing to a battle; you can directly narrate the play or just say your characters are tapping away at screens while they talk. Up to you! The other games are just stacked on a table, waiting. Grab the Twister box, make your characters fall all over themselves, and have fun! <br>    <br>The criteria for the costume contest are three: Creativity, originality, and hilarity. Put your Elf in a tutu and your Klingon in toga; we don’t care! The more side-splitting the combo, the better. Just post a good description of your character in his costume under the Contest thread. <br><br>The Masquerade is being held in a large dance hall in New Caledonia. The entire space is decorated lavishly, the lighting is dim, and one wall is lined with food kindly catered by Rudi’s. There’s a Bleep product station in each corner, along with a smorgasbord of candies. Individual decorations are up to interpretation: You want your characters to be standing by a paper dragon that moves and breathes fire? They’re standing by a paper dragon that moves and breathes fire. Anything you can think of from any story or continuum is up for grabs. <br><br>In regards to non-PPC characters at the dance: This is up to personal interpretation. If you want to leave it murky, feel free. If you want them to be a new hire, a citizen of Caledonia, or just a friend one of your agents made in your original continuum, feel free. It’s up to you. <br><br>Basil and I also have a special surprise planned for you all, so stick around! <br><br>-Alleb))<br><br><br>_______________________________________________________________<br><br><br>The dance hall was wild with colored lights and spooky decorations, inside and out. Agents and civilians streamed in, chattering and laughing. Costumes and masks jumped out at every angle, all vying for attention. It was a night for fun, friends, and far too much candy. <br><br>The entire event had been spearheaded by Agents Alleb and Michael, their respective partners unwillingly dragged along. The two of them stood on a small stage constructed at one end of the building, waiting for midnight when the party would really kick off. There was a small band behind them (it looked suspiciously similar to the one in the Cantina) tuning up, and various ghostly sounds drifted through the air from decorations. <br><br>When midnight finally struck, Michael, dressed as a Roman legionnaire, stepped up to the mike. “Hello everyONE!” Feedback amplified his voice and then rang through the air. He winced, then tried again. “Er, hi! Welcome to the first (hopefully) Annual PPC Halloween Masquerade! We have games, food from Rudi’s, and a costume contest later in the evening. So feel free to, uh, mingle and stuff until then. Well... bye?” With an uncertain cough, he fled the stage, leaving Alleb, a ballerina, to wave awkwardly and shuffle after him. The band covered for them by jumping into “Eye of the Tiger,” and the party began. </p>

            <p>&quot;I may&#39;ve had some help,&quot; Dawn admitted. &quot;I have a friend who likes to sew and is very good at it. I helped with some of it, though! And I&#39;m the one who borrowed the teapot, too. And, uh, the tea as well. My boyfriend made that. But! I had the idea to dress up as Iroh, and I found the wig myself, so there&#39;s that. I&#39;ll tell Des you liked his tea, though.&quot; She cleared her throat. &quot;Are there any donuts left, by the way? I like donuts. I&#39;d rather like to eat some, too--and Iroh&#39;s big on food and enjoying things like food, so it&#39;s even in character! And--what was your name again? Emiranlan...lanar? Could you repeat that, maybe? I think I&#39;m missing a piece or two of it. And speaking of names, Dawn is fine, unless you&#39;re from somewhere that objects to using first names or finds it rude or whatever else, in which case it&#39;s fine, surnames are good too. I rather like this one, even.&quot;</p>

            <p>Yet another extension to the RP! ^_^ The entire thing is going so well, I don&#39;t want to cut it off. Plus, I want to give everyone a little more time with the mystery. Since the &quot;one day extension&quot; didn&#39;t work last time, I&#39;ll leave this one a little looser; I&#39;ll post ahead of time when the RP feels like it&#39;s drawing to its natural conclusion. Does that sound alright to everyone? I apologize for flip-flopping on this; I&#39;ve never run an RP before. But hey, I know what not to do next time!<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>It took Michael a minute or two to reach the stage again, but he managed. He climbed up and motioned for the band to quiet down, which caught most of the crowd&#39;s attention. <br><br>&quot;Good evening!&quot; he said, in his best Dracula impersonation. It didn&#39;t really fit with his costume, but hey, it was Halloween! There had to be a Dracula voice somewhere. &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, it is time for the Costume Contest! Write your name on the list at the base of the stage, and we will call you up at the end of the night to show off your costumes! <br><br>&quot;Now, if you will excuse me, I--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oooh noooo!&quot; came a very bland &quot;scream&quot; from the food table. Mia stood nonchalantly beside the desserts, looking bored out of her mind and holding up the table cloth. Beneath the table was the Aviator, dressed as Princess Azula; her eyes were closed. &quot;The Aviator is deeeeeead. Whateeever shall we dooo?&quot;<br><br>Michael coughed slightly, then put on his best &quot;spooky&quot; grin (and no, it wasn&#39;t spooky) and resumed talking in his Dracula!voice &quot;That is right, Ladies and Gentlemen! For tonight, we have not only a party, but a <i>murder!</i> It is now up to you, most distinguished guests, to catch our culprit and bring him to justice! All we yet know of the crime is that the Aviator was murdered and stuffed under the desert table with no witnesses, and not a mark on her. There are also several candy wrappers scattered around her, opened and bereft of sweet goodness. Who could have committed this atrocious deed, murdering the PPC&#39;s top agent and not even leaving any candy? That is what you must find out. <br><br>&quot;Our suspects are three: Perhaps our killer is the famed Luxray Zeb, the Aviator&#39;s partner and best friend, who just so happens to know various electric moves that could kill someone without leaving a mark. Rumor has it that he and the Aviator had a recent falling out: perhaps anger bred violence?&quot; he gestured towards the Agent, dressed as Zuko and caught mid-step holding two cups of tea. <br><br>&quot;Or perhaps it was Chase Miller.&quot; Michael pointed at a young man beside one of the food tables: he was dressed as a lumberjack, complete with an axe, and was with a woman about his age with no obvious costume. &quot;No one knows who this mysterious man is, but he looks very guilty, and the chocolate stains on his hands match the chemical composition of that on the chocolate wrappers found next to the Aviator’s body. Is he our killer?<br><br>&quot;Last but not least is Amris: this little unfeeling Drone has a love of seeing insides come out, and he was seen near the dessert table just before the Aviator was found. Is he innocent in all of this, or did he just want to see for himself the famed double hearts of a Time Lord and was interrupted before he could finish the evil deed?<br><br>&quot;Here is your task, party-goers: question these suspects! Find the truth! And do it before the night ends.&quot;<br><br>With a swirl of his cape that tangled around his legs and almost made him trip, Michael exited the stage. &quot;<i>Wow</i>,&quot; he thought. &quot;<i>this stuff sounds a lot better when Alleb writes it down for me.</i>&quot;<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>((In other words, hooray, murder mystery and costume contest! Reply directly to this thread with a description of your character&#39;s costume to enter the contest, and find and ask our three suspects questions to solve the murder! Post your final guess here as well. Don&#39;t take too long in your questioning, please: other people might have want to ask as well. Your character will be rewarded with massive amounts of candy if they win or figure out the mystery. ^_^ Enjoy yourselves! <br><br>-Alleb))</p>

            <p>After an entire month, I&#39;m finally wrapping this up. I&#39;m sorry I took so long; it was irresponsible of me. And now, for the conclusion that no one was expecting!<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Michael decided to leave Minty where she was, and fled back to the stage once more. The party goers were already losing steam; it was time to wrap all of this up. He motioned for the band to quiet down once more and climbed the steps up the stage. <br><br>&quot;Good evening!&quot; he said again. As he waited for the crowd to still, he realized that he needed to use his Dracula impression again. &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, I have come to announce the winner of the costume contest, and the conclusion of our murder mystery! First, the contest.&quot; He had kept an eye on the entrants during the party, and had easily determined the winner. &quot;Our champion is... Chris, as Titans!Robin! Your prize will be waiting for you at the door!&quot; He led the room in applause. <br><br>&quot;And now, the conclusion of our murder mystery! Our three suspects, if you recall, are Zeb the Luxray, Chase the lumberjack, and Amris the Drone. You have investigated, and now we will reveal. The true murderer, is--&quot; <br><br>That&#39;s it. <br><br>Oh, you weren&#39;t expecting me, were you? No one ever does. I&#39;m the Narrator. I&#39;m the voice in your head that reads the story; without me, you wouldn&#39;t be reading this. <br><br>I killed the Aviator. <br><br>I used Plot Convenience. By definition, it was easy. <br><br>Anyway, motive: I&#39;m tired of being ignored. When&#39;s the last time you thought about the Narrator? When&#39;s the last time you, I don&#39;t know, were <i>thankful</i> for your ability to read a story? Let me guess, never? You haven&#39;t thought about me. So I&#39;m done. I interceded in this RP as a starting point, but I&#39;ll keep going. <br><br>Trust me. <br><br>&quot;...Michael?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Alleb? Is that you? I can&#39;t-- I can&#39;t see--&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t either. Did the lights go out? But I can&#39;t hear anyone but you-- what&#39;s happening?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know. Some weird PPC thing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I suppose so. I&#39;m going to try to find the exit-- here&#39;s my hand, let&#39;s try to leave.&quot; <br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>And that&#39;s the end! Thank you all for participating; it was really fun! What do all of you think of the ending? <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>&quot;Cease your laughter,&quot; he snapped at her. &quot;You&#39;ve no call to mock such dastardly accusations; there is peace between us!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You should totally, like, lighten up,&quot; Flora told him. She was still laughing. &quot;This is going to be, like, the most fun ever.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I despise you,&quot; grumbled Chase. &quot;First you refuse to join the masquerade, and now you plan to place false accusations on me--yes, Flora, I know your thoughts, you yet do broadcast them too loudly--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, take the light into your nails and have <i>fun</i>,&quot; Flora retorted. &quot;Come on, kitty, it&#39;s going to be the awesomest fun ever! And I&#39;m totally, like, in costume--I came as a human, remember?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye, and it is the most boring idea you might have pursued,&quot; Chase said. &quot;I, too, could have come as a human; however, I chose to have <i>fun</i>.&quot;<br><br>Flora&#39;s eyes widened, and she gasped dramatically. &quot;By killing yon lady?&quot; she exclaimed in thrilling tones that caught the ear of just about everyone who <i>had</i> ears and was in her half of the room. &quot;Such is your idea of fun? For shame!&quot;<br><br>Chase groaned, and smiled brightly at all the people who had turned to stare. &quot;You fiend,&quot; he muttered to Flora. &quot;You--&quot; And here he said a phrase in the only other language they shared, which, while only mildly insulting, did not translate well to English. &quot;And I know not why Kimberly&#39;s heart turns towards you,&quot; he added. &quot;You are awful.&quot;<br><br>Flora just gave him a sweet smile and reached for an oddly fancy bit of smoked salmon on a cracker. &quot;Let&#39;s see you, like, talk your way out of this,&quot; she said once she had finished chewing. &quot;Floor&#39;s yours, kitty-cat.&quot;<br><br>Chase groaned again, and turned back to the staring people. &quot;I <i>really</i> hate you. More than any one of my generation has ever hated one of yours. Save Lisbeth. And Jackson. Tell Kimberly I am no longer speaking to you when she returns.&quot;<br><br>Flora gave him a very sloppy salute and reached for another cracker.<br><br>---<br>((Hullo! These are some of my NaNo people. These two are aliens of a sort, masquerading in daily life as human teenagers; Kimberly is a real human teenager, who happens to know both of them (via school and neighbors). Lisbeth and Jackson both belong to Chase&#39;s subgroup of aliens. Since they are my NaNo folks, they&#39;re still in development, so if you see them adapting and evolving a bit as the rp goes on...that&#39;s why. I&#39;m also really excited to start writing their actual book today, so...yesssssss :D<br><br>~DF))</p>

            <p>&quot;Stephanie, WHY did you feel the need to bring me here? I have no desire to dance...&quot; Chakkik tugged at the sleeve of his white shirt, and at the yellow tie decorating it. &quot;And furthermore, why did you have me dress as that virtual singer? I am far too bulky.&quot;<br><br>Stephanie Podd was currently pale-skinned and blonde, with a big white bow in her hair. A yellow bow decorated her cut-off sailor suit, and her &quot;legs&quot; were currently black. &quot;I&#39;m too big to be Rin, but here I am. We&#39;re here to have fun, Chak!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Correction: YOU are here to have fun with CUPID, should he arrive. I am merely present to ensure that you stay out of trouble.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And yet you agreed to dress as Len.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t push me.&quot;<br><br>((Yep, the DMS team is dressed as the Vocaloid twins, Rin and Len Kagamine.

            <p>Mally looked uncomfortable. &quot;We&#39;re just here because Basil invited us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t be awkward, Mally,&quot; Zaddella said. She looked at Aaron and Natasha. &quot;I&#39;m Zaddella and this Mally Morrigan. We&#39;re here as sort of a try-on visit. Basil knows Alleb, who talks about working here all the time, and we were all interested in seeing what&#39;s what. I&#39;m the product of bad fanfiction, and I&#39;m interested in being a force for good.

            <p>&quot;Well, the PPC isn&#39;t a bad place to work for... well, I mean, it&#39;s awful, but I&#39;ve seen worse.  Um, but don&#39;t let that turn you off from it or anything, it&#39;s really important work.  And I mean, it&#39;s more fun than crawling through abandoned subway tunnels or something... some of the time, anyways.&quot;  The conversation seemed to have fallen on Aaron, who was beginning to wish he&#39;d invested a few more ranks in Speech.  He cast about desperately for a more neutral conversational topic.  &quot;Um, Zadella, right?  You said you were from a badfic; what&#39;s your home continuum?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Star Wars,&quot; replied Natasha before Aaron had time to respond.  &quot;I keep forgetting you barely even know the basic fandoms.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Only because you think it&#39;s more important that you expose me to your weird anime games,&quot; Aaron shot back.  &quot;What about you, Mally?

            <p>&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Zaddella said. &quot;Think middle schoolers, excited after watching Attack of the Clones.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;m actually from the Weft and Warp continuum,&quot; Mally said. &quot;It&#39;s very different from Star Wars.&quot; She smiled, trying to be charming. &quot;How did you start working here?

            <p>&quot;This is it, I guess,&quot; said Nick Jacobs (who was doing a poor job of impersonating the Tenth Doctor) as he and his band of friends entered the dance hall. There was silence for a few moments. <br><br>&quot;What now?&quot; rumbled Dirk. The prize-winning boxer was in a Link costume, for some reason. Nick couldn&#39;t figure him out. <br><br>&quot;We might mingle,&quot; Chi-won supplied, tugging on the leather strap over his chest and skillfully bringing his ukulele into his hands. He was dressed as one of the hippie nomads from Avatar. &quot;If we stick to &#39;Song of Storms,&#39; we&#39;ll make some sweet lightning outside!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I would advise against that,&quot; Hasina said. She had opted for Cleopatra, and had spent over an hour getting all of her dark hair into tiny braids. &quot;We are guests here, after all, and there is already a band playing.&quot;<br><br>All four of them turned to their fifth member, Skye, but found that she had already fled to the candy station. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m going to get some food,&quot; Chi-won announced, letting his ukulele return to its normal place at his side. He then went in the opposite direction from the food and made a beeline for a gaggle of pretty girls.  <br><br>&quot;I think I will follow him,&quot; Hasina half-muttered; she took it upon herself to make sure that Chi-won didn&#39;t embarrass himself or others. The guy was a great ukulele player, but he had the social graces of a drunk emu. <br><br>Dirk followed Hasina without a word: Nick had noticed the two of them spending a lot of time together in recent days. He wondered what that meant. <br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; he said to the empty space in front of him. &quot;This is fun.&quot;<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Despite being one of the tallest and most imposting figures present thanks to his powered armoursuit, Gaspard was sticking to the edges of the hall, casting furtive glances at the crowd while carefully loading his cardboard plate with food and treats with an oversized robotic gauntlet. Despite being bulky, blue, and making him stick out like a sore thumb, the CMC-300 suit made him feel safe and comfortable. People didn&#39;t look at him-- the looked at the armour and talked positively about it (unless they were right next to him, in which case &quot;watch it!&quot; was more often said than &quot;check out those pauldrons!&quot;). Being the centre of so much positive attention was a rather new experience for the Spy, and he was savouring every moment of it. He looked up again. Maybe he&#39;d see someone he knew and strike up a nice chat. Or meet the gaze of someone who wanted to talk about his suit and also have a nice chat. <br><br>Gaspard paused, looked down, and went back to shovelling food onto his plate. No, that was a dumb thought after all. People just didn&#39;t cold-approach others like that-- this was real life. He&#39;d better just stick to enjoying the food. There was less potential for social awkwardness that way.<br><br><br>-----<br><br>Another Roman legionnaire walked into the hall. Clad in sandals, a red tunic, and lorica segmentata, the Guardsman looked around the room and sighed when he saw Michael. &quot;Great,&quot; he grumbled as he adjusted how his helmet sat on his head. &quot;And I thought I was being original. Oh well.&quot;<br><br>The former soldier then noticed the massive amount of food laid out on the tables nearby. His costume woes forgotten, he made a beeline towards the nearest table and grabbed a plate. This was going to be a good night.<br></p>

            <p>&quot;Hey,&quot; she said, nodding towards a towering blue armorsuit near the food table. &quot;Chi-won seems to be doing fine, and that one looks lonely.&quot;<br><br>Dirk glanced at the ukulele player. He was currently trying to serenade the punch bowl. &quot;Seems to be,&quot; he grunted. <br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s go, then,&quot; she said, jerking her head and causing her elaborate braids to swing. &quot;I&#39;d hate for someone to spend the evening alone.&quot;<br><br>Dirk smiled and let her lead. <br><br>It took a few moments to reach the blue suit, what with all the slightly-intoxicated party guests, but the two of them managed. Hasina arrived first and reached up to tap the suit&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Hello, in there!&quot; she said cheerfully. &quot;I could not help but notice your costume! It is wonderful!&quot;<br><br>((FYI: Hasina is dressed as Cleopatra, and Dirk is Link.<br>-Alleb))</p>

            <p>For the second time that night, someone commented on Gaspard&#39;s armour. Talking to the Aviator had somewhat drained him of energy-- Gaspard wondered if he could survive a few more hours at this pace. <br><br>&quot;O-oh. Thanks. You two, er... you&#39;re also looking pretty good! Loving that Link costume,&quot; he said to Dirk, &quot;and I believe that&#39;s ancient Egyptian royalty, right? Oh, very well done.

            <p>&quot;It is; I&#39;m Cleopatra.

It&#39;s even better than the food!&quot; With a grin, she popped a small appetizer into her mouth, chewing with relish. <br><br>&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Dirk said slowly: he always did that, as if he were testing each word as he spoke it. &quot;Did you make the suit yourself?&quot; <br><br>((-Alleb))</p>

            <p>&quot;It&#39;s, er... I got it from a &#39;fic,&quot; he said to Dirk. As he listened to the CMC&#39;s afterburner fans whirr behind his head for a few seconds, he felt obliged to add: &quot;But, um, if it counts, I did manage to put it on myself without anyone&#39;s help, so that&#39;s a thing. I-it&#39;s also, er, technically mine: one of the rare p-perks of being a <i>Starcraft</i>-verse intelligence operative. Well, I say &#39;mine&#39;: when I found it, there was a reddish-grey stain all over the back of the helmet.

            <p>&quot;She&#39;s <i>not going to see me</i>, Emi,&quot; he said. The armor came off, and was tossed to the ground with a light crash. &quot;So of course it&#39;s worth the risk. I told you--I know where she&#39;s gonna be. I&#39;ll avoid her. And now I&#39;ve got the psi-blocker, so it&#39;ll be even easier!

He was about to say something along the lines of &quot;this is getting ridiculous, now it&#39;s time for you to go&quot; until he spotted a familiar silhouette several steps behind the Reader. She was clad in a fancy black Victorian dress and wore a hat with a veil that completely obscured her face. She cocked her head to the side. Something told the Guardsman that behind it, she was smiling. <br><br>The woman raised an arm to adjust her veil. On her wrist was a bracelet identical to the Reader&#39;s. The Guardsman smiled and continued listening to the Reader go on about how Naya didn&#39;t manage to follow him to the party. <br><br>&quot;You know, for someone who kept on telling me that I&#39;m &#39;not perceptive enough&#39;, you&#39;re surprisingly unaware of everything that&#39;s going on around you,&quot; said the Guardsman once the Reader had stopped talking. &quot;You&#39;re also forgetting that Naya and I have also been friends for a long time. She&#39;s always had my back-- no matter the time or place. Isn&#39;t that right, future-Naya?&quot;<br><br>The veiled woman had snuck up on the Reader and quickly wrapped her arms around his waist. &quot;Gotcha,&quot; she said. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about him, Emiran. I got him under control.&quot;</p>

            <p>The Aviator gave him a faint smile. &quot;Nice to talk to someone who&#39;s not trying to get me out of an angstfest, or bugging me about my personal life. &#39;Sides, you seem pretty smart. Makes sense, since you&#39;re in DoI, but meh.&quot; She shrugged and looked around for a clock. &quot;Just a heads-up, I somehow agreed to help the hosts with a thing later. Dunno when it&#39;ll start, but maybe we could keep chatting after?&quot;</p>

            <p>A dark-haired Asian youth ran past him, yelping periodically; if one were to follow him, they would notice that he was dressed in a dark brown adventurer&#39;s vest over a blue short-sleeved shirt, faded blue jeans, and jungle boots.<br><br>A moment later, the reason for his alarm became clear.

            <p>Five women, all young, were arguing in the corridors of the Nouvelle-Caledonie section of HQ with the addition of one very definitely male young man. He was ostensibly there to keep the peace, but mostly what he was doing was glowering at a slightly charred map and muttering to himself about asking for directions from a damn plant.<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t believe this,&quot; came the same voice as before. It belonged to a small, wiry Goth who&#39;d come as the Spectre Of Friedmanist Economic Structures, something that looked uncannily similar to a bedsheet with eyeholes and a load of currency symbols sprayed on it in multicoloured car paint. &quot;We&#39;re hours late. <i>Hours</i>. We&#39;ll miss the midnight countdown at this rate!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tess, deep breaths.&quot; This from a taller girl in a thrown-together witch&#39;s outfit, somewhat spoilt by the work polo-neck underneath with a nametag reading &#39;Hello! My Name Is <s>Trainee</s> Jo&#39;. &quot;It can&#39;t be far away now, can it? I mean, New Caledonia&#39;s not that big.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Besides,&quot; came the Home Counties RP tones of someone who, with the inevitability of the passing seasons, rejoiced in the name of Araminta Twizzell-Pole (TwiZELL-Powell, she insisted, a pronunciation used by family members and precisely no-one else), &quot;you&#39;re making an awful fuss for someone who didn&#39;t want to come, eh? Did this week&#39;s union not survive the first meeting?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sod off, Minty, it was my study group and it finished early,&quot; Tessa grumbled. &quot;And I didn&#39;t want to see you in a dancehall dressed as some sexist wazzock&#39;s idea of Aphrodite so you could flash your bits at any of the built ones.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Y&#39;know, if we join hands and chant in time, I&#39;m sure we could call upon Mother Earth to guide us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, thanks for the input, Starlight.&quot; That came from Sam, the aforementioned very definitely man. His accent, one born of a Nigerian family and a Hackney childhood, was adept at making the word sound like &#39;earthworm&#39;.<br><br>Starlight, as was her wont, just tossed her hair and wandered off, her enormous, billowing dress trailing seedlings of rare fruits. Jo caught up with her, the rest of the group wandering behind.<br><br>&quot;Star, wait. That, that&#39;s actually not a bad plan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you, Joanna, I know. Saturn is in the 8th house for the next fortnight, so my decision-making&#39;s getting a boost.&quot; They were the long, languid tones of someone who spent most of their days sprawled on a sofa listening to whalesong; the kind who thought thick ginger dreads looked really good against pallid skin.<br><br>Jo ignored the rest of her comment (ignoring Starlight was a skill one picked up over time) and concentrated, her hand on the floor of the corridor, arcane runes gathering around her in a maroon circle that slowly spread across the width of the corridor. She straightened and fished in a pocket for some herbs and, while muttering in Latin, blew them straight up into the air. When they fell, they formed bootprints on the ground... which promptly trudged off into the middle distance.<br><br>&quot;Er, are we going to follow those?&quot;<br><br>Tessa scowled. &quot;No Minty, we&#39;re going to sit here and wait until it comes back with a chauffeur-driven bloody hovercraft. Jesus wept.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh. But I thought you all didn&#39;t want me to ask Daddy for a lift-&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re following the footsteps!&quot;<br><br>The six trudged off, Tessa in the lead. Jo could feel the pull of the spell like something tugging on her forehead, so she stayed at the back to make sure people didn&#39;t get lost. This meant she was next to the last member of the group, dressed as she was in a Dracula costume.<br><br>&quot;Are you going to be okay, Sally? I mean, we&#39;ve checked for allergies, and I can cast a detection charm for garlic, but it&#39;s more that... well, y&#39;know... that I want you to have a good time tonight,&quot; she finished, rather lamely.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Sally replied. &quot;One thing though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Should the vampire have gone as Dracula?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re not &#39;the vampire&#39;, Sally, you&#39;re my friend and you just have some problems.&quot; Jo&#39;s smile was bright and warm, and she accompanied it with a one-armed hug.<br><br>Sally&#39;s enhanced eyesight could see how shaky it was at the edges, and she didn&#39;t say anything.<br><br>&quot;Aha! Got something!&quot; Tessa&#39;s Northern twang cut through the quiet of the corridor.<br><br>&quot;Tess, you okay?&quot; Jo called. &quot;What did you find?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Something on my scanner. Alcohol concentration. Been scanning for it since we arrived; big Halloween bash with students going? Got to be booze about. Long range, but we&#39;re closing in on it. Wouldn&#39;t have picked it up without your spell, though.&quot;<br><br>Jo preened a little, despite herself. &quot;Thanks, Tessa.&quot;<br><br>About ten minutes later, and amidst plenty of chatting, the Southeastern University Amateur Heroics Society (minus faculty rep, who was attending a lecture on the importance of flans in Early Modern European warfare) arrived in the dancehall, just in time to see Michael&#39;s announcement.<br><br>&quot;Ooh, he&#39;s <i>yummy</i>,&quot; Minty whispered, and tried to make a beeline for him.<br><br>&quot;Make sure you use protection, Minty!&quot; Tessa yelled. &quot;You don&#39;t want to give &#39;im that weird rash you&#39;ve got!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you, Lenin, always an unutterable pleasure,&quot; grumbled a beetroot-red Minty as she came right back.<br><br>Sally tapped Tess on the shoulder. &quot;Please not with the shouting, Tess,&quot; she said, &quot;enhanced hearing over here.&quot; And with that she returned her hands to their position over her ears.<br><br>Jo decided to take charge of the situation, trying frantically to remember how the article she&#39;d read online had said to do so. &quot;Look. We know why we&#39;re here. We know that we&#39;re here. Let&#39;s just do what we came to do and-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Get plastered?&quot; Sam cut in.<br><br>&quot;... Yeah. Um, yeah, that.&quot;<br><br>And so the six made their way to the bar, whereupon Sam found they didn&#39;t have any lager and accidentally set fire to his nun costume.</p>

            <p>It was at this point that Tessa started swearing inventively since Sam&#39;s costume had got the spiderwebs. The Goth fished around in her clutchbag and pulled out something that looked like pepper spray, if designed by someone who thought it should be able to fire whole peppers. She pointed it at the flames and pressed the trigger on the top, and it began to suck in the flames from various points in the room. This went well, even after it got clogged up with Sam&#39;s leg hair.<br><br>&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Jo said, trying on another smile. &quot;Er. I think we&#39;re down as HeroSoc? Maybe? Minty, what did you book us as?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Twizell-Pole party.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... Of course you did.&quot; Jo fought the urge to roll her eyes and capitulated after valiantly struggling for a good few milliseconds. &quot;Hm. I&#39;m Jo, that&#39;s Tess, our resident nun&#39;s Sam, Sally&#39;s over there pouring ketchup in a bag of crisps for some bloody reason, Starlight&#39;s the one talking the ear off the barman about astrology, and Minty...&quot; And here she winked. &quot;Minty I believe you&#39;ve met.&quot;<br><br>Minty glared at Jo for a second, then turned it into a gaze of frankly terrifying lust directed at Michael. &quot;Ave, centurion,&quot; she said, managing to make it sound so filthy even ancient Romans would have balked at it.</p>

            <p>Jo beamed winningly as she took the proffered hand. &quot;And yes, we have. So far. I mean, we only just got here, so it&#39;d be hard not to, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sorry &#39;bout that, fam,&quot; Sam rumbled, patting out his costume. &quot;I get pis-&quot; He winced at the elbow in the ribs from Tessa, who made a subtle prayer gesture at Alleb. &quot;-annoyed. Yeah. Um, very annoyed, and irritated. And that happens.&quot;<br><br>Minty, meanwhile, was content to take a delicate sip of something fruity and potentially lethal squatting in a martini glass. &quot;Oh yes, I&#39;d say we were eclectic. Indeed, we&#39;re quite the...&quot; and here she stood closer and closer to him, oblivious to Alleb&#39;s glances and the barely-contained fury of her demeanour. &quot;Proposition. Wouldn&#39;t you say...?&quot; The pause was obviously there to let Michael give her his name, and then whatever else he might feel like giving her in a quiet spot.<br><br>Sally, meanwhile, could all but <i>smell</i> the Christianity on Alleb, and was content to stay as far away from her as possible. You occasionally got the religious nutjobs throwing bottles at your head, and holy water left burns like an acid attack on people like her. She smiled weakly at the barman and ordered a glass of Rioja, at least in part because drinking something at least a little bit red helped quell the cravings for some reason. That it came in what basically amounted to a bucket on a stick meant the barman had the same idea of a small glass as she did.<br><br>She looked on as Minty draped herself over that poor Roman legionary and went over to Starlight, who was fishing around in a pocket next to a nervous-looking woman with a militarily short blonde haircut and just so happened to be in the opposite direction. Thankfully, she&#39;d moved on from trying to give the barman a healing crystal connected to the Moon, so that was something. It was also safer. No vampire wanted to be on the wrong side of someone with Alleb&#39;s level of faith, and if all else failed, the stoner was someone she could hide behind.</p>

            <p>Perhaps already having her teeth gritted helped, and Alleb managed not to scream. That didn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t hurt: on the scale of injuries she had received during her time as a Knight of Alleble, this one ranked third. The first was that one time she had eaten an entire pot of Elsbeth&#39;s stew: in fifteen minutes. <br><br>Her left hand, the one that didn&#39;t have at least one (more likely several) bones broken, immediately began moving for the <i>murin</i> steel knife she had stashed beneath her tutu. If she could score even a shallow cut on Minty&#39;s forearm, her hand would be freed. <br><br>But then a memory came to her: It was a scene from one of the famed Sir Aidan&#39;s adventures. The young knight had almost single-handedly destroyed Paragor&#39;s army, and rescued many hostages from Rucifel-- the Prince&#39;s second-in-command-- with only a handful of spiders and arrows. <br><br>That wasn&#39;t the part of the tale that came back to Alleb, though: what she recalled was when Sir Aidan and his friend, the Lady Gwenne, were trying to convince the king of Mithegard not to sign a treaty with Paragory. Rival knights of that kingdom, and, indeed, Rucifel himself, had almost convinced the king to agree. After Aidan was dismissed by the king, and on his way out of the courtroom, one of the Paragor&#39;s knights had shoved Aidan to the ground, jeering at him and prompting him to a duel. Sir Aidan had drawn his sword, intending to kill the knight: but instead he had offered it as a promise of peace. <br><br>Although her eyes were watering from the pain, Alleb offered her other, shaking hand. &quot;In my defense God me defend,&quot; she answered. <br><br>((-Alleb))</p>

This is really gonna hurt.&quot;<br><br>And with that, she promptly nailed Alleb&#39;s hand to the table with the hatpin and started chanting, grabbing what was left of Tessa&#39;s pint and pouring it over the wound as it bled.

The only exception was a silver Ankh pendant on her neck and silver brads on her belt. <br><br>&quot;Will, I didn&#39;t believe you, when you said you had this in your wardrobe,&quot; she said, looking at the man, &quot;and I <i>still</i> don&#39;t believe people would actually wear this on a daily basis.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whatever, Elvira,&quot; William replied. For the sake of the costume, he used Glamour to add more colour to his skin and turn his hair black. He was wearing a black Ulster coat with cape, and a three-piece suit underneath it. The entire outfit was completed with a top hat on his head and a fake carving knife in his hand. <br><br>He looked at VJ. &quot;Besides, it was your idea. You kept asking me about Victorian era clothes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, my idea was brilliant! Come on, can&#39;t you see it!? <a href="http://oi68.tinypic.com/35mjgbk.jpg">Jack the Ripper</a> and <a href="http://oi65.tinypic.com/wgwc5t.jpg">Death</a>?&quot; she said, pointing from William to herself. &quot;That&#39;s like the greatest combo ever! Even better than jam and bacon!&quot;<br><br>William raised his eyebrow. &quot;...Don&#39;t you mean <i>eggs</i> and bacon?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know what I said. Now, follow me, Jack!&quot; VJ faced her partner and took a comically exaggerated bow. &quot;I shall point you towards your next target.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You mean towards food?&quot; The warlock rolled his eyes but smiled nonetheless; she was having fun, who was he to deny her that. He followed the perky goth to the savory part of the buffet. <br><br><br><br><br>((The clickable names show you Will and VJ before and after  putting their costumes on.))</p>

Ain&#39;t that topical?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The funny thing is, this actually was my favourite outfit, back in the day.&quot; William nodded to politely to Aaron and Natasha, turning to the latter. &quot;Want me to fix your voice, love?

            <p>&quot;Yes, very.  Though I&#39;ve seen Jack the Ripper, and she didn&#39;t look anything like William&#39;s costume.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s because he&#39;s basing his off real life, not your home continuum,&quot; Aaron interjected.<br><br>Natasha ignored this statement in favor of considering William&#39;s offer.  &quot;I might take you up on that, actually.

            <p>&quot;Yours was also a little girl? In my version, she was the daughter of a prostitute, trying to return the womb where she last felt safe, but you could say that in the end she became something like a demon.&quot;  She shrugged.  &quot;But yeah, I can find you some clips online.&quot;  She dug into a cleverly-hidden pocket and withdrew her phone.  After finding the clip she wanted, she tossed it to him.  &quot;As you can probably guess, it&#39;s the guy I&#39;m dressed as.&quot;</p>

            <p>William put the phone closer to his ear, trying to familiarize himself with all the little details of the voice Natasha desired. After listening to it three times, he returned the phone.<br><br>&quot;A&#39;right, I can do it. I&#39;m goin&#39; to give you a simple Glamour, like the one I&#39;m wearin&#39; right now.&quot; William pointed at his black hair and fairly normal skin. He waggled his fingers, and green flames crackled between them.<br><br>&quot;You know, I could just coat your vocal chords... but I think I&#39;ll go one step further.&quot; William passed his hand by Natasha&#39;s throat and closed his eyes. He felt a surge of heat escaping his palm and coating the girl&#39;s neck. With one smooth motion he grazed her cheekbones, altering them, in order to accomodate to the new larynx. <br><br>&quot;There. How does that sound now?&quot; he asked after shaking off some excessive smoke from his fingers. </p>

This is great.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I stick by my earlier statement that using magic or the disguise generator is cheating,&quot; Aaron said.<br><br>Natasha smirked, clearly enjoying herself.  &quot;Your foolish ideals will bring you nothing but suffering.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You realize she&#39;s going to be impossible all night, don&#39;t you?&quot; Aaron remarked conversationally to William.</p>

            <p>Oh where do I start? <br><br>- A fanfic where 8 canon female characters go on a journey with Sora and get their own keyblades. The story was their boyfriends and friends are getting kidnapped for being &#39;Princes of heart&#39; by &quot;Feelers&quot; a rip off of heartless and nobodies who were made out of the feelings of someone who died. <br>At one point one canon female was just tossed onto the ship with memory loss. I never got far in it thank goodness. <br>- Really early designs of some of my ocs. <br>- A fanfic where every mafia related anime character meet up in a meeting to hang out. There would then be a murder and Li&#39;en and Wonrei from Gash/Zatch Bell were going to solve it with a detective so underdeveloped I never described anything but their tench coat. </p>

            <p>Carnage was a complete MESS when I first thought him up. He actually started out as a Gary Stu self-insert of myself in a Magic School Bus fic. Yes, really.<br><br>The gist of it was that he was turned into a Megalania during a canonical episode involving reptiles, then all of the other students turned into kaiju. He got thrown into a volcano, where he found a giant ruby that controlled the element of fire (Yes, really) and was appointed its guardian by some kinda spirit-I guess that it was the Earth, but I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>Anywho, Carnage got transformed into a giant dragon that could turn invisible, fly faster than the speed of light, and was somehow able to terraform Mars with the help of Calvin and Hobbes.<br><br>I wish I was making this up.</p>

            <p>A Sue from the Warriors series in my first fanfic. She was named Silentflame, was involved in a prophecy, had a special moon-shaped mark on her forehead, was trained by the Dark Forest yet didn&#39;t turn completely evil (okay, that one has happened to a few canon characters, so...), got her prefix of Night- replaced with Silent- after a throat injury which made her incapable of speaking except one word at a time, became an apprentice early, was singled out by the Dark Forest for training, became an orphan after her mother was exiled by the stupid Clan leader and her father went crazy and was fooled into killing himself....<br><br>Yeah. Oh, and she decided to name her one stillborn kit Nightkit. You know, to signify how her happy past was dead to her. And thus she became completely goth and joined the Dark Forest. And that&#39;s as far as I got.<br><br>One important note: She didn&#39;t end up in ThunderClan, where most Sues from the Warriors continuum go. She was in ShadowClan. But she was still kind of a Sue. I&#39;ll have to run her through a Mary-Sue test to make doubly sure.</p>

            <p>It was Digimon Takari fic, but the only canons in it were T.K. , Kari, Patamon and Gatomon. The rest of the characters were all Suvian non-canon children and grandchildren. Thank Azulongmon that I only ever wrote that on paper and that it never made it to my computer.</p>

            <p>When I was seven, I played a lot of make-believe <i>Harry Potter</i>. Most consistently, I was Lupin&#39;s long-lost daughter who went on to become the fourth member of the Golden Trio. And I was a werewolf, of course.<br><br>But there was one make-believe that I absolutely loved. I was a half-human, half-Hungarian Horntail (no, please don&#39;t ask how that worked, I was just a kid and didn&#39;t understand these things. Let&#39;s go with magic), hatched from an egg on the Romanian dragon reserve, found by Charlie Weasley, and raised by the rest of the Weasleys as Ron&#39;s twin sister. <br><br>Oh, and I looked something like <a href="http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/90216/gria.jpg">this</a>, only more Horntail-y. Of course, I could fly, and breathe fire, and tagged along for the rest of the trio&#39;s adventures, was the second Chosen One because Reasons, became the fifth Triwizard Champion, blah-de-blah. I believe speaking to animals was in there as well as super-strength and enhanced senses.<br><br>I wrote down bits of the make-believe, but thank all the authors, those early fanfics-from-before-I-knew-fanfiction are long since lost. *shudders*</p>

            <p>Oh, what to say of myself? It was horrible. Absolutely atrocious. Mia was a seven-year-old genius who had a Circlet of Power (I didn&#39;t even have the sense to make it a ring) sunk into her <i>head</i>, literally, by Sauron; was sent to Middle-earth; learned Westron in weeks; and was also visited by VARDA HERSELF IN A DREAM. <br><br>I cannot comprehend myself. <br><br>Thankfully, I never finished the story. I had planned on Mia being sent on the Quest for Erebor (at <i>seven</i>) then going back out into Middle-earth every five years until she was thirty-five; at that point she would become a Tenth Walker Boromance. Oh, and she would be a jaded soldier who lost a leg in Desert Storm, but she neglects to tell the Fellowship about that tiny detail.<br><br>Best part about this? The overarching plot was that Sauron was exposing her to all the heartbreak in Arda, because for some reason he could only harness the power in the Circlet when she cried. Yes, cried. Don&#39;t ask, I have no idea. <br><br>So... yeah, I&#39;m really glad that story never got on the Internet. <i>Really</i> glad.<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>A while ago, I remember reading this Deltora Quest sporking: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15af7DMejPsGlnfm6jYh1EdJVEcVsyT7FOsYySjirjAA/edit?hl=en_US"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15af7DMejPsGlnfm6jYh1EdJVEcVsyT7FOsYySjirjAA/edit?hl=en_US">https://docs.google.com/document/d/15af7DMejPsGlnfm6jYh1EdJVEcVsyT7FOsYySjirjAA/edit?hl=en_US</a></a><br><br>One of the things that irked me, however, was the presence of a mini, specifically shadow lord.

            <p>I guess it&#39;s better then never chiming in, eh?<br><br>Sorry for the late reply, I don&#39;t keep up with the Board all the time. I was surprised to see me mentioned at all :P<br><br>Re-reading my old mission, aside from the usual cringing, and looking over some old notes was an interesting experience. I did use one capitalization Mini, a Jurassic Park one, but aside from that one early on, I decided not to use them for the most part. During a mission, at least when I wrote them, I find ones with silly names like Brandyduck, Gordor, Grimli, etc, etc to be much more interesting to have pop up. <br><br>It&#39;s also far funnier to see a name like Legoless pop up multiple times in a mission, since the odds of it happening are a lot lower then legolas. <br><br>So, I guess that&#39;s my stance on minis. Hopefully I didn&#39;t ramble on my reasoning too much.<br><br>In any case, I don&#39;t think I will go back and change it to add it, since I would have scooped it the first time anyhow. Having one-of-a-kind things was something I was all about back then, as silly as it seems now. Though I did go over the doc, and fix a few typos, and generally sweep it up a bit. Rather embarrassed with myself it needed them. <br><br>Though, once you get permission, feel free to do a mission there! The section in the Pit is /ripe/ with stinkers, including one with a country above the clouds! : )<br><br>I also agree with what a mini would be. Originally I was going to do some more missions there, but eventually decided not to, for whatever reason. <br><br>Caddy-Shack, who always enjoys finding a fellow fan of something</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll drop the mini, but I&#39;ll be sure to check out this &quot;Pit,&quot; whatever that is-one of the things I love about Deltora is that there are so many fun and imaginative ways to kill things!

            <p>Sorry about that, The Pit of Voles is a slang term for Fanfiction . net. <br><br>Of course, there are other sites with fics. Archive of our own, Quitiv, and so on. Though I find FF.N has the best chances of finding badfic. <br><br>And yes! Deltora is a hilariously dangerous place. Then again, the author is from Australia, so I guess she writes about what she knows. Though don&#39;t feed too many Sues to any particular creature. Poor Cthulhu was getting fat from them, way back. <br><br>I didn&#39;t know there was going to be another series, though I guess it&#39;s something to look forward to. I haven&#39;t read the Three Doors series yet, mainly because I live in the woods far from book outlets, but a backstory to the Shadow Lord, and more of the world of the books is my main reason for wanting to read them. <br><br>The one (current) fanfic I have out is a Deltora Quest one, actually. Kind of left untouched since I did the first chapter, but I&#39;ll eventually get to it. The idea behind it was if the books were a DnD campaign. DM of the Rings inspired, of course. I figured it fits, since there are only a small number of (non-puzzle) fights to level with, and loot is sparse. <br><br>Have you seen the anime? </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve just read the books.<br><br>Also, the fact that the author&#39;s Australian makes a lot of sense-as Tv Tropes put it, Deltora&#39;s basically the fantasy equivalent of it. (Although I would personally nominate either the Vorox homeworld from Fading Suns, planet Fenrir from WH40K, Catachan from WH40K, or Zerus from Starcraft for that role.)<br><br>As for overfeeding, that&#39;s another beautiful thing about Deltora: there&#39;s a very low chance for any overfeeding to occur because there&#39;s a) a lot of different creatures that could happen upon a Sue, b) thousands of specimens of each species, meaning that there&#39;s a very low chance of the same individual getting a meal multiple times, and c) if any DO get fat and start associating sapient creatures with food, they won&#39;t last very long against the local bags of crazy that are the natives of Deltora.</p>

            <p>Meta-wise, it&#39;s also so that it doesn&#39;t become routine to just dump corpses in one place, though I suppose it&#39; not an issue in a fandom with less missions.

            <p>I do it all the time, pointing out SPaG and continuity errors, and occasional a confusing narration or lack of canon knowledge, in recently published stories, so that the author(s) can correct their mistakes or explain their choices when I wasn’t aware that there is a choice.<br><br>It’s a bit different with older missions, where the author isn’t around anymore. You may argue that others still can learn from your concrit, even if the author never sees your comment, and that we should acknowledge that the PPC isn’t infallible. (I actually did this with <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N4jKcFbyqltExkxVhQeDtlZqkWLUWYvN39-oE8tPRE8/edit?pli=1&amp;disco=AAAAAZYhWP8#gid=0">my very first comment on this board</a>.)

Implying that you intend to rewrite history and retroactively catch shadow lord feels like you are sporking a PPC mission, and, considering that we only spork the most awful fics, this is a Bad Idea that should be restricted to the Badfic Games.

            <p>Capitalization aside, the rules according to the wiki are clear: Minis are named, decided, chosen, whatever, by the first person to write a mission in that continuum, or the creator of a continuum&#39;s OFU. Seeing as how no known OFU exists for Deltora Quest (To my, and apparently anyone else&#39;s knowledge) then the only person who can create the first Deltora Quest mini is the first person to write a mission featuring them. Since this fellow sporker never wrote about the mini, nobody, and I mean NOBODY, can decide what the mini will be until we see one in a sporking. The wiki&#39;s page on minis is also clear that it is misspellings that make minis, while saying nothing about capitalization. The former is spelling, obviously, while the latter is grammar.<br><br>I don&#39;t mean to &#39;bother by the book&#39; so to speak, but I just felt that a post featuring the rules on the wiki might be helpful if this will be debated.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m just posting what I found in regards to what the rules regarding minis were. I honestly don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s misspellings or miscapitalization that produces a mini. I really just wanted to stop a potential pointless discussion that could be resolved by simply having a set of rules posted. As I said before, I have no real stake in this, and therefore, no opinion. If you want to try to change the rules, be my guest. As long as I don&#39;t have to deal with a new mini every time something fails to be capitalized, I don&#39;t care. Having the option would be pretty nice, though.</p>

            <p>...it tends to work as &#39;author&#39;s choice&#39;. I personally do use capitalization minis, but I co-write with people who don&#39;t (mostly for convenience, I think). And what we tend to do here with published missions, unless there&#39;s something very problematic in them (generally <i>not</i> to do with minis, in my experience) <i>and they were just published pretty recently</i>, is to leave them be (unless the author is around and wants, of their own volition, to change it).<br><br>If the author of the first Deltora Quest mission (which, heyy! I used to read that! I don&#39;t remember much about it, but it was fun!) made the decision not to use capitalization minis--that was their choice, and we can&#39;t change it after the fact. Or, at least, it certainly seems like an extremely rude thing to do, especially without talking to the author (who, it seems, is Caddy-shack, which is <i>awesome</i>, I have a mission to read or reread now!) about it and getting their view on it. If you want your agents to have Deltora minis--why not get Permission and write a second mission set there, which establishes what the minis are? It&#39;s a good deal more polite, not to mention more usual for the PPC (as far as I know, old(er)bies can feel free to confirm or deny), and, really, is more polite than suggesting even in-universe that Agents Cadmar, Maria, and Mark just happened to miss a mini. Especially since you&#39;re not, to my knowledge, working with Caddy-shack on this (or even discussing it). How would you feel if someone did that to your agents, over a decision you made? If someone&#39;s agents were introduced together with, say, a mini blinking out of existence because their author didn&#39;t agree with you that capitalization minis should be used?<br><br>Or, to make this a bit more to the point: pretend you&#39;ve written the first mission for a canon. You chose not to create the new mini type because you don&#39;t use capitalization minis, or chose not to for this mission. Later, someone decides--without talking to you first--that they don&#39;t like this decision you made; instead of writing their own mission to that canon and creating the mini-type, they have the capitalization mini appear in HQ, with the acknowledgement that that canon suddenly has a mini-type, and say outright through their agents that your agents must have missed the mini or something. Would you seriously be okay with this? Would you seriously not find this rude, or potentially lazy (in the sense that this person could have gone looking for a fic to mission that uses the same mini, if they were attached to using that particular one, or could have had their agents be the first to officially meet said minis, which could be pretty exciting to write and to read)?<br><br>That&#39;s my take on it: it seems rude, quite unusual, and even rather lazy to create a mini-type--and a mini--this way. Capitalization minis are not used by everyone; retroactively editing around someone else&#39;s mission in this way seems rude, especially since it feels kind of insulting to the agents who did the mission; and the more polite--and, to my knowledge, more usual--thing to do would be to simply write a mission and create the mini-type yourself that way. And I&#39;ll stop there; I think I&#39;ve said everything I want to, and have even summed it up again at the end. Night, all.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Some people like to count capitalization errors, and others don&#39;t.  It&#39;s not a hard and fast rule, but respecting the original author&#39;s decision is.<br><br>As for my personal mini protocol: I won&#39;t name a new mini type for a fic that only features capitalization errors in the proper names.  If, however, at least one &quot;traditional&quot; mini appears in that mission, then I go ahead and count the capitalization errors as well, to maximize adoption potential.  So, in my first mission, I passed over making a mini out of &quot;fire chief&quot;, which is spelled &quot;fire-chief&quot; in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> (or vice versa; can&#39;t look it up on my phone) to avoid making a single mini for a very minor canon that sees almost no attention.  The same could be said for <i>Epic Mickey</i>, but my third mission featured actual typos of proper names, so I had no choice but to create a mini—and included the capitalization typos as well, to beef up the list of potential adoptions.<br><br>—doctorlit hopes this didn&#39;t get confusing.

            <p>The only thing that had given Falchion a moment&#39;s warning was the high-pitched screech from near the console, followed by a series of rapid-fire &quot;EEP&quot;s like a baby chick.<br><br>Springing to his talons and crossing the RC in just three strides, he ended up running straight into an unusually excited Ripper, who had apparently attempted to rush over to him instead.<br><br>&quot;Ripper, what the flock&#39;s gotten into you?!&quot; the Skarmory cried out in a mix of alarm and amusement, picking himself up. &quot;You&#39;re not usually this... excited.&quot;<br><br>Ripper, who had ended up sprawled on the floor with ruddy feathers everywhere, managed to get to his feet as well, breathing rapidly and noisily. &quot;Not when I am surrounded by creatures that shouldn&#39;t have evolved until millions of years after my time, no. But the fact that the <i>Saurian</i> dev team has been keeping up with the latest research for the sake of authenticity-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, what&#39;s going on?&quot; asked Suta. She had been visiting the two maniraptorans, in her human disguise, when the outburst had happened. &quot;What&#39;s a dev team, and why are you two on the floor?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He wasn&#39;t watching where he was going,&quot; Ripper replied in his usual deadpan tone. &quot;But I suppose it was my fault, too. I was indeed a little over-enthusiastic.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A <i>lot</i>,&quot; added Falchion, cocking his head. &quot;So, what&#39;s this about a dev team doing research? Since when was that even a thing?&quot;<br><br>There was silence for a moment, but the two of them could tell that Ripper had become visibly disappointed.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve never heard of <i>Saurian</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Suta. &quot;I know it refers to lizards, but-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Reptiles, in the broadest sense,&quot; Falchion corrected her. &quot;I mean, we all are, but birds are technically very specialized reptiles...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Back on topic,&quot; said Ripper, &quot;<i>Saurian</i> is an upcoming computer game that supposedly recreates the Hell Creek ecosystem as accurately as possible. No time-traveling humans, no volcanoes and tar pits, nothing but what&#39;s known to science.&quot;<br><br>Another moment of silence later, Suta spoke up again. &quot;So... You&#39;re gonna have to play as a Big Jaw?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>? Yes, that&#39;s one option among several different genera,&quot; replied Ripper. &quot;And plenty of others will be featured in the game as well. Including, I hope, a newly discovered member of my kin.&quot;<br><br>Falchion and Suta looked at each other.<br><br>&quot;Okay, what? Didn&#39;t they already find one of those?&quot; the Skarmory asked, cocking his head.<br><br>&quot;Yes, and that is a playable genus. But there is another. And it&#39;s bigger.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tell me more!&quot;<br><br>Ripper nodded, before leading them towards the console. The others read the article on the screen with wide eyes.<br><br>&quot;How big are we talking here?&quot; asked Suta.<br><br>Ripper&#39;s smile showed every one of his jagged teeth. &quot;Big enough to eat you for breakfast.&quot;<br><br>The disguised tyrannosaur felt her jaw drop. &quot;T-that big?! But a forty-foot-long Fast Biter isn&#39;t-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Scientifically plausible?&quot; asked Falchion, eyeing her slyly. &quot;Or are you just worried that you&#39;re no longer the apex predator around here?&quot;<br><br>Suta glared at him, but Ripper cut in before she could retaliate.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t worry. At your adult size, you will have nothing to fear. I cannot say the same for juvenile Big Jaws, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So... <i>Jurassic Park Velociraptor</i>-sized?&quot; asked Falchion.<br><br>&quot;Correct. And big enough to kill a juvenile tyrannosaur if it wanted to. They probably hunted the same prey, after all, albeit in different ways.&quot;<br><br>Suta punched her palm, glaring at nothing in particular. &quot;Well, those things should be lucky I&#39;m almost fully grown! I&#39;ll show &#39;em who&#39;s top of the food chain any day!&quot; She grinned and snorted, the effect slightly dampered by her temporarily flat-topped teeth.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll get your chance, Suta,&quot; said Falchion. &quot;When you play the game, that is.&quot;<br><br>She looked at him, surprised. &quot;When?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Look, tell you what: Once this <i>Saurian</i> game&#39;s released to the public, I&#39;ll do everything I can to get my talons on it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>We</i> will,&quot; Ripper added.<br><br>&quot;Then we can get together to play it!&quot; said Falchion. &quot;Think about it, dinosaurs playing a dinosaur game! How cool is that?&quot;<br><br>Suta beamed at them both. &quot;You two are awesome, you know that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed so,&quot; Ripper replied, smiling again. &quot;And yes, it would certainly be &#39;cool&#39;, in Falchion&#39;s parlance. Just like taking a walk in the woods, 65 million years ago. For real, this time.&quot;<br><br>----------<br><br>So yeah, <i><a href="http://saurian.maxmediacorp.com/">Saurian</a></i>. An upcoming survival game where you get to play as a scientifically accurate dinosaur in the Cretceous Hell Creek biome. I&#39;ve been following the development of this game for quite a while now, and as a palaeo-nerd myself, I can&#39;t help but be excited for it! Partly because the devs of this game pride themselves on accuracy, and they&#39;ve thoroughly researched every aspect of Hell Creek and its prehistoric inhabitants known to date. Suffice it to say, if you want to know what it&#39;s like to be a real, live T. rex, play this game when it comes out!<br><br>Incidentally, the announcement posts for the blog of this game were also how I learned of the new raptor genus discussed in the ficlet. Say hello to <i><a href="http://saurian.maxmediacorp.com/?p=771">Dakotaraptor</a></i>, a five-meter deinonychosaur with a fantastic name that was officially announced to science earlier today! Notable features include a 16-centimeter killing claw on the second toe, and quill nobs on a bone from the forearm (making this the largest known winged dinosaur to date). So yeah, we now know that JP-sized raptors lived alongside T. rex, and it&#39;s awesome to see that <i>Saurian</i> will hopefully include this amazing discovery in what&#39;s shaping up to be a fantastic game so far!<br><br>Read more about <i>Dakotaraptor</i> here: <a href="http://www.krank.ie/category/sci/nat/dakotaraptor-giant-raptor-hell-creek/"><a href="http://www.krank.ie/category/sci/nat/dakotaraptor-giant-raptor-hell-creek/">http://www.krank.ie/category/sci/nat/dakotaraptor-giant-raptor-hell-creek/</a></a></p>

            <p><a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-10-ornithomimus-dinosaur-tail-feathers-skin.html">An <i>Ornithomimus</i> has been found which preserves plumage patterns.</a> Not particularly surprisingly, it has basically the same feather patterns as an ostrich - bare legs, feathers elsewhere. Which will no doubt continue to upset people who want dinosaurs to have been demon crocodile-lizards, rather than the amazing creatures they actually were, but I find it hard to care. ^<em>~<br><br>The specimen apparently has a &#39;three-dimensional keratin structure to the feathers&#39;.

Cool? Cool.<br><br>The picture for this one is pretty good. Not as good as the official <i>Dakotaraptor</i> image, which was drawn by Emily Willoughby and is fantastic, but pretty good.<br><br>-- and, haha, speaking of Ms. Willoughby: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dakotaraptor_RPR.jpg">&#39;<i>Ornithomimus</i> being restrained by <i>Dakotaraptor</i>&#39;.</a> Because dinosaurs!

            <p>What&#39;s so bad about having both scaled and feathered dinosaurs? Dinosaurs are amazing no matter what integuement they have.

Last I checked, it&#39;s the people who like feathered dinosaurs who&#39;ve been jerks lately-#buildabetterfaketheropod and that stupid ark-hate group on Tumblr spring to mind.<br><br>Let&#39;s just agree that dinosaurs are awesome whether they&#39;re feathered or scaled.

            <p>-The fact that &#39;dinosaurs should be scaled&#39; goes very much hand in hand with &#39;and they should ROAR ALL THE TIME and BATTLE LIKE TITANS and RIP YOUR THROAT OUT&#39;.

            <p>I don&#39;t really care what a dinosaur does in an artistic depiction: if the artist chose to have a scaled raptor or a feathered T-rex, who am I to judge? It&#39;s still a dinosaur, one of the most magnificent animals to ever live.<br><br>Also, I loved that scene, too. One of the main reasons I liked Jurassic World was that it had a working park for most of the film, and the minor incidents that occurred in it, like the Pachycephalosaurus escaping, added to that for me-as someone who has worked at a zoo, the only real difference was that the animals were bigger.<br><br>(Yeah, #buildabetterfaketheropod is basically a glorified temper tantrum. Some good designs did come out of it, but very few really got the idea of what the Indominus was-she was a representation of Ingen&#39;s messing with nature.

If you have any helpful tips/mistakes not to make that aren&#39;t already there, I&#39;d be most grateful.<br><br>I&#39;m currently in the thick of the Wheel of Time series (I&#39;m on book 6) so that&#39;s my newest one and my go-to right now. My oldest favorite is Star Wars, and one of my fanfic characters from my earliest stuff lives on to this day. I also love the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.

            <p>Oh, another fan of Wheel of Time. Keep it up, this series is long, but totally worth it. Once you get to the ending you should also give a look to Sanderson&#39;s books, they picked him up for finishing this series for a reason.<br><br>Well, the Wiki should cover the bases, don&#39;t be so afraid of messing up though, I mean, this will happen someday, nobody is perfect, but the important thing is knowing how to move on after this.<br><br>But what about the PPC stories, did you saw Iximaz&#39;s rec list? it&#39;s a great debut if you&#39;re searching for new spinoffs.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re searching for new authors for fantasy, I also recommend Jim Butcher, who already has three different series for three genres:<br><br>- About fantasy, Codex Alera. Somebody betted that Butcher couldn&#39;t create a good series using Lost Roman Legion and Pokemon as bases. This someone lost very bad.<br><br>- For steampunk, his newest series, Cinder Spires, a post-apocalyptic world of towering spires, crystal technology and sentients cats, reminding us they are the finest creation of evolution.<br><br>-Finally, the jewel of the crown, his urban fantasy series the Dresden Files. Pure awesome, snark and drama, and this series will reconcile everyone with first-person prose.</p>

            <p>So, I have a certain non-PPC project on my mind right now, but it requires a huge (and I mean HUGE) knowledge about the UK, its culture, customs, etc.<br><br>This is why I&#39;m asking every subject of Her Majesty, who has some free time and knowledge to share, to be my consultant on all things British (No Canada or Australia, though, maybe later), because there is a limit to things you can research by yourself. It doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gonna ask about every smallest detail, I am going to ask for confirmation on things I am not sure about.<br><br>Who&#39;s with me? :D</p>
