            <p>Altough Rina and Zeb killed the nudist psycho, they didn&#39;t do the cleaning up after her final death, for obvious reasons.

            <p>So if you&#39;re familiar with MST3K, (specifically the Mike era,) you&#39;ll probably remember THE PUMAMAN otherwise known as Thepumaman (pronounced thep-yoo-may-min) a terrible superhero movie that reeked of New Powers as the Plot Demands and molding cheese. I was thinking of having a go at salvaging the (really quite laughable) plot. Does anyone think this is possible?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t understand. Are you talking about possibly doing another riff on that movie or possibly turning that movie&#39;s plot into an actual, well-written story?

            <p><b>AGENTS</b><br>I have a few qualms about the character of Meg. I found her personality to be abrasive, especially when in combination with the prompts. I get that was the point, but I would argue that even the most bristly jackass of a character needs to have some redeeming features (or failing that, be either super interesting in some other way or prone to falling flat on their face). The little &quot;thank you&quot; text didn&#39;t really do enough to endear her to me. I will admit that&#39;s something that would probably come out better in a longer piece, but I&#39;m still bringing it up for you to think about.<br><br>Michelle seemed quite good, although I should note that I know nothing about <i>Kingsman</i>. I like a good &quot;ditzy&quot; character every now and again.<br><br>One more minor thing. It was a little confusing for me to have characters named &quot;Mitchell&quot; and &quot;Michelle.&quot; Is that going to be a plot point later on?<br><br><b>PROMPTS</b><br>&quot;Going Postal&quot; had some technical issues that stuck out to me. The first paragraph, for example, has a sizable run-on sentence that is very clunky to read. The texting was also somewhat problematic, especially in one exchange that occurs without any intermediary text. Since it&#39;s all in italics, it can be a little frustrating to suss out who&#39;s saying what.<br><br>Clarification question: why did Michelle have such a positive reaction to Meg writing &quot;Thanks Mitch&quot;? I would think that being called by Meg&#39;s ex-partner&#39;s name would have the opposite effect.<br><br>I also didn&#39;t understand why Michelle needed to lie in order to see Meg. I don&#39;t see how that would have worked better than saying &quot;I&#39;m her partner, are you sure I can&#39;t see her&quot; or something. Unless she&#39;s trying some sort of escape attempt, which I don&#39;t see working at all.<br><br>The second prompts better, if a bit insubstantial. I feel like there wasn&#39;t enough interaction between the agents before the mission alarm went off. It was also confused why Michelle was clearly referred to as &quot;not Shelly&quot; in the text and yet as Shelly twice in the disclaimer.<br><br>In both prompts, you had several one-sentence paragraphs that did not need to be as such. It&#39;s not a strict grammatical rule, but I&#39;ve always felt that those should really be reserved either for dialogue or something so serious that it needs its own paragraph as a form of emphasis. Otherwise, it can feel out-of-place.<br><br><b>FIC CHOICE</b><br>I know nothing about the <i>Brotherband Chronicles</i>, but I saw more than a number of technical errors while skimming the first few paragraphs. That works for me.<br><br><b>COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION</b><br>No complaints here. Gold star.<br><br>It took no small amount of back-and-forth deliberation, but I&#39;m going to have to say that permission is denied. While your writing shows promise, I feel it needs a bit more technical tightening before you submit again. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

            <p>I could argue that Meg&#39;s loyalty is her redeeming quality, but if she&#39;s coming across as a coldhearted witch then I&#39;m doing it wrong anyway, so I won&#39;t argue because it won&#39;t change anything.<br><br>Kingsman is a fantastic movie and I recommend it wholeheartedly.<br><br>The similarity between Mitchell and Michelle was going to be a plot point. Until then, Michelle will be referred to as &#39;rookie&#39; or &#39;Shelly&#39; by Meg, and Mitchell will be universally referred to as Mitch. I believe my reasoning was something along the lines of &#39;proper names in the files&#39; et cetera.<br><br>Texting is difficult to format and I&#39;m open to any help on that front.<br><br>Michelle had a positive response to that for two reasons, only one of which is in-universe. The first reason is that it&#39;s the first time that Meg has referred to her in a non-degrading way, because Meg is not a nice person. The second reason is because it originally said &#39;rookie&#39; and I didn&#39;t catch the dissonance when I redid it, because I&#39;m a moron. Same prompt different problem - Michelle WAS planning a breakout, but you&#39;re right in that it was a bad, bad idea that I am fixing..<br><br>And finally, I will add more to the second prompt.</p>

            <p>So, how critical is it to read the Halo novels if you&#39;ve read a ton on the wiki(s)? I know that &#39;not reading the books&#39; tends to be a berserk button for many fandoms, but reading is not something I&#39;m good at, especially if it&#39;s printed on normal paper. I&#39;ve played all the games, watched all the film adaptations, and read the one comic I could get. I ask because I&#39;m thinking about having one of my debut agents be a Halo resident, and I need to know if I can write her properly. If not, then I&#39;ll have to go with plan B.<br><br>And, if I do need to read the books, what would be the bare minimum? I&#39;d really like to avoid Glasslands, if at all possible. I have trouble reading books because I can see all the little particles that constitute the paper. Like trying to read stuff surrounded by static. If anyone&#39;s got a solution to that, I&#39;m all ears.</p>

            <p>Thank you for reminding me about them.<br><br>Now, I know the main canon is in the games, but shooting big purple dudes in the face tends to not provide much information about the &#39;verse. I just didn&#39;t know if merely playing the games was enough to write a Halo OC, because of the above-mentioned face-shooty bit. After all, I could write all I wanted about how the Warthog has less grip than WD40, but, to my knowledge, it is actually a very practical vehicle in-universe.<br><br>But maybe I&#39;m over-thinking this.

            <p>Though I guess it didn&#39;t matter in the end, given how the fic went south towards the end of the third act. Sarah is still awesome, though.<br><br>Back on topic, I always thought ROBTD made some pretty neat fanart fuel, but as a fanfic? A LOT harder. Apart from the continua involved taking place in different time periods (Brave and HTTYD may be in the same era, maybe, but RoTG is set in the present day, so that by itself kinda puts a damper on the concept - and that&#39;s nothing to say of including even more fandoms like Frozen, Hotel Transylvania, or Big Hero 6), there&#39;s also what fans do with the characters themselves. I&#39;ve seen a lot of Jack/Rapunzel on Tumblr, along with Merida/Hiccup or Hiccup/Rapunzel. The inherent problem is that two of the four have love interests in canon, and the others may be well on their way to having partners of their own if you take the supporting material into account.<br><br>I guess the only way to go about a fic like that would be an AU, but that&#39;s a whole other can of worms I&#39;d rather not try my hand at again, at least not in writing. For now, I suppose the darn good art that sometimes comes out of this movement will do.<br><br><s>Is it a bad thing that I still ship HiJack, btw?</s></p>

            <p>ROTBTD began its hideously mutated existence as a reaction to the prevalence of SuperWhoLock on fandom blogs that &quot;claimed&quot; (read: vomited all over) non-fandom stuff on Tumblr. Because Tumblr is one of those places where people believe they are always right about everything ever (I fitted in rather well), this led to stuff like ROTBTD attracting a serious fandom rather than the more tongue-in-cheek one it had had previously. See also: the obsessions with Paul Blart, Bee Movie, and Shrek. Me neither.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s gotten worse since I fixed my phone. I can&#39;t really speak for my computers, as I use Adblock Plus on all of them, for anti-virus reasons. At any rate, I hope the T-Board will be usable soon. I keep getting redirected to some rather... risquй pages. None of them seem to contain harmful scripts or other things, beyond the usual ad-targeting stuff. If I find something harmful, I&#39;ll update.</p>

The art&#39;s gorgeous and I love the slightly Gothic atmosphere.<br><br><a href="http://girlgeniusonline.com">Girl Genius</a> - Mad scientists rule Europe...with mixed results.

Also, the Jagermonsters. Notable for being hilarious supporting cast members without stealing the show from our hero, Agatha.<br><br><a href="http://thepunchlineismachismo.com">Manly Guys doing Manly Things</a> - Follows the ridiculous shenanigans surrounding Commander Badass (an original character), who runs a facility that helps integrate macho video game characters into real life, Jared Kowalski (either the dumbest or the smartest Pokйmon trainer ever), Sarah Jones &quot;Jonesy&quot; (Commander&#39;s girlfriend), and a host of others. I particularly recommend reading the Nomura Syndrome arc and the arc where Commander and Jonsey go back to his generic space future, though the comic itself is great. (Also check out Platinum Black by the same author!)</p>

While it&#39;s originally intended as a joke/parody of VNs, it actually has a pretty good plot and interesting (if, of course, somewhat clichйd) characters. The storylines can be funny, but also creepy and feels-inducing. And then, of course (hey, it&#39;s a parody of visual novels), there&#39;s the hidden &quot;true&quot; ending, but I don&#39;t want to say much about it because SPOILERS. Seriously, it&#39;s hard to explain why this game is good without spoiling half of the plot away, but I strongly recommend playing it.<br>(No, it&#39;s not <s>just</s> that I&#39;m obsessed with this game. I also found some badfic of it that I&#39;d like to spork if I ever get Permission, and it probably wouldn&#39;t be as funny if no one else is familiar with the game.)<br><br>As for another relativelty unknown work (well, it&#39;s kinda well-known, but not as much as most stuff we see here), there&#39;s <a href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/">Schlock Mercenary</a>, a comedic hard(ish) sci-fi webcomic.

            <p>First off, Brandon Sanderson. All of his stuff. All of it. I cannot stress how amazing his books are: everyone on here should read them. They are <i>beautiful.</i><br><br><i>The Door Within Trilogy</i> by Wayne Thomas Batson. This is where my handle came from; it&#39;s a Christian YA series, and it had a really deep impact on me. I heartily recommend the audiobooks. They&#39;re read by the author, and they&#39;re really immersive. <br><br><i>The Paper Magician</i> by Charlie Holmberg. This has one of the most interesting magic systems I&#39;ve seen, and a great story to boot. It&#39;s part of a series, which makes it even better. It centers around Ceony Twill, a young magician in the early 1900s (1901, I think) who is forced into learning paper magic, rather than steel, like she wanted. The love story moves a little too quickly, but other than that it&#39;s wonderful. <br><br><i>The Lunar Chronicles</i> by Marissa Meyer. These are futuristic twists on the old fairy tales: now Cinderella is Cinder, a cyborg in a country where being a cyborg makes you second-class, at best, and the entirety of Earth has to deal with the Lunars, a race of advanced humans with terrifying mental abilities. These books are awesome, and the next in the series comes out next month! Yipee!! <br><br>Brandilyn Collins is another Christian author with some really interesting mysteries: <i>Eyes of Elisha</i> was very good, as was her <i>Kanner Lake</i> series. Oh, and <i>Exposure</i>. That one was awesome. <br><br>C.J. Hill, another YA Christian author, and her <i>Slayers</i> series. I also really enjoyed <i>Erasing Time.</i> The first centers around a group of kids who are descendants of knights imbued with special powers for the purpose of fighting dragons, the second is about twin sisters who are dragged forward in time to a dystopian city-state. Both could be better, but I enjoyed them. <br><br>Well, that&#39;s all for me. Oh, and if anyone cares, all of the books are fairly clean. Nothing egregious, anyway. If you read (or have read) any of these, tell me! I have almost no one to talk to about any of them. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p><b>Pure Pwnage:</b> Kind of a weird online video series that flip-flops back and forth between being a mockumentary that criticizes gamer stereotypes and a high-stakes action series that aggrandizes gamers and gives them real world superpowers.  Often within individual episodes.<br><br>Contains lots of swearing and some verbal references to sex, but no nudity, and most of the violence is special effects beams.  Oh, but since this is the PPC, I should also warn that the main character, liek, talks liek this, liek, all th&#39;time, an&#39; stuff, lol.<br><br>The <a href="http://www.purepwnage.com">web series</a> (click the tab under the big video), which is unfortunately unfinished due to the death of one of the recurring actors.  Although, it&#39;s supposed to be continued in a movie soonish.<br><br>(There&#39;s also a TV spin-off <a href="http://www.hulu.com/pure-pwnage">on Hulu</a>, but I didn&#39;t find it as good, and it didn&#39;t feature any of the uber micro fantasy fighting of the web series.)<br><br><b>Marble Hornets:</b>  This is an amazingly well done horror series on YouTube that uses the Slender Man stories as background to an interesting psychological mystery.  The camera work and editing is superb, and really sells the realism of the series.  (It&#39;s sort of fourth wall breaking, as the actual YouTube accounts are also the ones supposedly being used by the characters.)<br><br>Link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MarbleHornets/videos">main series</a>.  (That account has just started a sequel series, so make sure to go to the end and start at the beginning.)  There&#39;s also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/totheark/videos">side account</a> (again, go back to the beginning) where another character sent messages to the protagonists.  Never fear: <a href="http://marblehornets.wikidot.com/the-entries#toc2">here</a> is a list of the two acconuts&#39; videos in upload order, so you can watch in proper revelatory order!</p>

            <p>-I dunno if <i><a href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/">Worm</a></i> counts as obscure, but I&#39;m going to plug it anyway. TW for basically everything under the sun — I can make a list, but I&#39;ll probably miss some — and incredibly grim, but superbly well-written. Can be described as <i>X-Men</i>&#39;s grim, better-written little sister.<br><br>-<i>Lord Demon</i> and <i>Lord of Light</i> by Roger Zelazny. No connection despite the similar names. The first is Zelazny&#39;s take on Chinese mythology, the second — on Indian mythology and Buddhism. Both are really well-written, and <i>Lord of Light</i> has a character called Tak the Archivist, AKA Tak of the Bright Spear; what&#39;s not to like?<br><br>-Speaking of Roger Zelazny: everybody needs to read <i>Jack of Shadows</i> now because it&#39;s that awesome. It&#39;s also a short read so you really have no excuse. Seriously, go read it now.</p>

            <p>This is partly because <i>Worm</i> is an absolutely amazing series - and long, so it works for people who read on the commute - but mostly because I don&#39;t want to suffer alone. Oil rigs will make your soul hurt, as will walk-in fridges and Godzilla movies. =]</p>

            <p><a href="http://narbonic.com/">Narbonic</a> - a webcomic about a mad scientist named Helen Narbon and her hapless assistant Dave.  The comic is now complete, and it&#39;s really fascinating to watch it build from a mostly light-hearted strip about wacky mad science hijinks to an extremely powerful conclusion, without abandoning the humor on the way.  The art improves dramatically as well.  There&#39;s also a sequel, <a href="http://skin-horse.com/">Skin Horse</a>.  I also find the artist&#39;s commentary on the strips to be an interesting look into the process behind creating a series, though only read it if you&#39;ve already finished the story once.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saya_no_Uta">Saya no Uta</a> - a visual novel that depicts the heartwarming story of a young man who finds true love and rediscovers the beauty of life after a traumatic car accident.  Or alternatively, Gen Urobuchi&#39;s take on the Cthulhu Mythos.  It&#39;s definitely not for everyone; aside from the nearly constant gore, there&#39;s a great deal of explicit, frequently non-consensual, sexual content, and Saya looks like she&#39;s about all of twelve.  But if you can get past that, the story is both horrifying and deeply moving.  It&#39;s also fairly short, only about five hours long.</p>

Her legs seize up and she feels paralyzed from the waist down. Though terrified by the incident, she wants to know if it will happen again. So she sneaks out to go swimming at night, and it turns out, she turns into a mermaid whenever she&#39;s in the water. She befriends another mermaid and together they learn the truth about Emily&#39;s family.

            <p>... What are you talking about? This is the best story <i>ever!</i> The plot is so original and captivating, with an incredible amount of worldbuilding, the characters are so realistic and deep, and the shocking revelation at the end of the last chapter was completely unexpected! Not to mention the incredibly well done formatting!<br>I just can&#39;t wait to see more of the adventures of... Huh, it&#39;s weird, whenever I try to remember her name, I keep coming up with &quot;Ebony Dark&#39;ness Dementia Raven Way.&quot; Ah, whatever.</p>

It&#39;s basically a much bigger boost, with it boosting the damage output of damaging beam moves by 50%, or by 75% in sunlight. Musharna, however, doesn&#39;t learn a lot of moves that can effectively utilize it, but what it <i>does</i> learn is Trick Room. Try a set utilizing that on a Sun team, with Psybeam, Charge Beam, and Signal Beam as the remaining moves. Charge Beam&#39;s a really good move for this set, but it does mean you&#39;re vulnerable to Ground-type switchins. Still, it&#39;s worth a try, so enjoy! =]</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! Sanity, as you might have noticed, is optional.<br>The Original Series and Constitution are required reads; we also have a spiffy Wiki to which you should turn before asking any questions (we like people who do the research). Links are on top of the Board.<br>To answer your unasked question, it looks like you&#39;ve encountered another Egogy knockoff. For some reason people keep ripping Enoby off; maybe they think it&#39;s funny.<br>And, last but not least — have this cup of Earl Grey tea. Leaves aren&#39;t predatory. Promise.</p>

            <p>What&#39;s the connection between assessments and chemicals? I suspect that each assessment has multiple chemicals involved, but are chemicals referenced by multiple assessments?

            <p>Those queries will both give you one row per hazardous chemical in an assessment - if you&#39;re dealing with, say, the unholy child of chlorine trifluoride and nitrogen tetroxide (<i>why would you do that?</i>), you&#39;d get back the id twice, once for the join with FC3 and once for the join with NO4.

            <p>You know, sometimes you just want to be Stephen Colbert.<br><br>Nah, but in all seriousness, EatPrayLove gave me an idea. He/She suggested that we do a group on Wattpad for the PPC. That said, I don&#39;t believe Wattpad has this functionality. However, as one often does in this kind of situation, I&#39;ve settled for the second... Third best thing. Yeah.<br><br>I made a group for the PPC on Fimfiction.net. If I&#39;m not mistaken, this website allows hosting for fiction (or non-fiction) that is not about ponies specifically, as long as it&#39;s not being posted. So, if anyone wants to host their stuff somewhere in case Google explodes, here&#39;s the link.<br><br><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/group/209173/the-litter-box"><a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/group/209173/the-litter-box">http://www.fimfiction.net/group/209173/the-litter-box</a></a><br><br></p>

            <p>I said we needed to make a page on the PPC Wiki for Wattpad, like the ones in <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Websites">this link.</a> The &quot;Litter Box&quot; comment was because most of the websites we have pages for have funny/insulting names, like the Pit of Voles or the Circle of Lemmings.<br><br>Thanks for making the group, though.

            <p>Hey, aren&#39;t you guys planning a trip over here at some point? I&#39;d be happy to host an Oxford Gathering Redux. (More than happy, frankly - it&#39;s an amazing city.) I don&#39;t think the map will be there next year, but the museum definitely will. ^<em>~<br><br>(Also, the map is actually more legible in the photos than the real world; the advantage of photography, that. Though it <i>was</i> pretty cool to stand right there with it.)<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ExprXkSDOUd0NYUmZvTENtalU/view?usp=sharing">Here, have a map</a>. I&#39;ve adjusted for perspective, heightened the contrast, and colour-matched the pieces (approximately! It&#39;s not exactly poster-quality!). I&#39;ve also thrown extra contrast-enhancement on a few of the comments. Google will only zoom up to ~40% of the original, but it&#39;s fully explorable.<br><br>So don&#39;t say I never do anything for you. ^</em>^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hopefully next summer, around August/September. Though, one of Phobos&#39; cousins inconveniently decided to get married in Colorado in late July, and I was also hoping to take the opportunity to visit one of MY cousins who lives near to where the wedding is going to be. I know which vacation I&#39;d pick if we can only do one, but since it&#39;s the more expensive of the two, we&#39;ll just have to see.

            <p>Oh where do I start? <br><br>- A fanfic where 8 canon female characters go on a journey with Sora and get their own keyblades. The story was their boyfriends and friends are getting kidnapped for being &#39;Princes of heart&#39; by &quot;Feelers&quot; a rip off of heartless and nobodies who were made out of the feelings of someone who died. <br>At one point one canon female was just tossed onto the ship with memory loss. I never got far in it thank goodness. <br>- Really early designs of some of my ocs. <br>- A fanfic where every mafia related anime character meet up in a meeting to hang out. There would then be a murder and Li&#39;en and Wonrei from Gash/Zatch Bell were going to solve it with a detective so underdeveloped I never described anything but their tench coat. </p>

            <p>Carnage was a complete MESS when I first thought him up. He actually started out as a Gary Stu self-insert of myself in a Magic School Bus fic. Yes, really.<br><br>The gist of it was that he was turned into a Megalania during a canonical episode involving reptiles, then all of the other students turned into kaiju. He got thrown into a volcano, where he found a giant ruby that controlled the element of fire (Yes, really) and was appointed its guardian by some kinda spirit-I guess that it was the Earth, but I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>Anywho, Carnage got transformed into a giant dragon that could turn invisible, fly faster than the speed of light, and was somehow able to terraform Mars with the help of Calvin and Hobbes.<br><br>I wish I was making this up.</p>

            <p>I also did a lot of Tenth Walker-type Sues, the ones who follow the hero through the story and are super special and all that, but don&#39;t change how things happen. However, I can&#39;t really remember most of them. The Yu-Gi-Oh Sue was the one I really remembered, and it was the worst, because I actually tried to make that card, as opposed to the others that I just kept in my imagination.</p>

            <p>A Sue from the Warriors series in my first fanfic. She was named Silentflame, was involved in a prophecy, had a special moon-shaped mark on her forehead, was trained by the Dark Forest yet didn&#39;t turn completely evil (okay, that one has happened to a few canon characters, so...), got her prefix of Night- replaced with Silent- after a throat injury which made her incapable of speaking except one word at a time, became an apprentice early, was singled out by the Dark Forest for training, became an orphan after her mother was exiled by the stupid Clan leader and her father went crazy and was fooled into killing himself....<br><br>Yeah. Oh, and she decided to name her one stillborn kit Nightkit. You know, to signify how her happy past was dead to her. And thus she became completely goth and joined the Dark Forest. And that&#39;s as far as I got.<br><br>One important note: She didn&#39;t end up in ThunderClan, where most Sues from the Warriors continuum go. She was in ShadowClan. But she was still kind of a Sue. I&#39;ll have to run her through a Mary-Sue test to make doubly sure.</p>

            <p>Oh, what to say of myself? It was horrible. Absolutely atrocious. Mia was a seven-year-old genius who had a Circlet of Power (I didn&#39;t even have the sense to make it a ring) sunk into her <i>head</i>, literally, by Sauron; was sent to Middle-earth; learned Westron in weeks; and was also visited by VARDA HERSELF IN A DREAM. <br><br>I cannot comprehend myself. <br><br>Thankfully, I never finished the story. I had planned on Mia being sent on the Quest for Erebor (at <i>seven</i>) then going back out into Middle-earth every five years until she was thirty-five; at that point she would become a Tenth Walker Boromance. Oh, and she would be a jaded soldier who lost a leg in Desert Storm, but she neglects to tell the Fellowship about that tiny detail.<br><br>Best part about this? The overarching plot was that Sauron was exposing her to all the heartbreak in Arda, because for some reason he could only harness the power in the Circlet when she cried. Yes, cried. Don&#39;t ask, I have no idea. <br><br>So... yeah, I&#39;m really glad that story never got on the Internet. <i>Really</i> glad.<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I guess it&#39;s better then never chiming in, eh?<br><br>Sorry for the late reply, I don&#39;t keep up with the Board all the time. I was surprised to see me mentioned at all :P<br><br>Re-reading my old mission, aside from the usual cringing, and looking over some old notes was an interesting experience. I did use one capitalization Mini, a Jurassic Park one, but aside from that one early on, I decided not to use them for the most part. During a mission, at least when I wrote them, I find ones with silly names like Brandyduck, Gordor, Grimli, etc, etc to be much more interesting to have pop up. <br><br>It&#39;s also far funnier to see a name like Legoless pop up multiple times in a mission, since the odds of it happening are a lot lower then legolas. <br><br>So, I guess that&#39;s my stance on minis. Hopefully I didn&#39;t ramble on my reasoning too much.<br><br>In any case, I don&#39;t think I will go back and change it to add it, since I would have scooped it the first time anyhow. Having one-of-a-kind things was something I was all about back then, as silly as it seems now. Though I did go over the doc, and fix a few typos, and generally sweep it up a bit. Rather embarrassed with myself it needed them. <br><br>Though, once you get permission, feel free to do a mission there! The section in the Pit is /ripe/ with stinkers, including one with a country above the clouds! : )<br><br>I also agree with what a mini would be. Originally I was going to do some more missions there, but eventually decided not to, for whatever reason. <br><br>Caddy-Shack, who always enjoys finding a fellow fan of something</p>

            <p>Sorry about that, The Pit of Voles is a slang term for Fanfiction . net. <br><br>Of course, there are other sites with fics. Archive of our own, Quitiv, and so on. Though I find FF.N has the best chances of finding badfic. <br><br>And yes! Deltora is a hilariously dangerous place. Then again, the author is from Australia, so I guess she writes about what she knows. Though don&#39;t feed too many Sues to any particular creature. Poor Cthulhu was getting fat from them, way back. <br><br>I didn&#39;t know there was going to be another series, though I guess it&#39;s something to look forward to. I haven&#39;t read the Three Doors series yet, mainly because I live in the woods far from book outlets, but a backstory to the Shadow Lord, and more of the world of the books is my main reason for wanting to read them. <br><br>The one (current) fanfic I have out is a Deltora Quest one, actually. Kind of left untouched since I did the first chapter, but I&#39;ll eventually get to it. The idea behind it was if the books were a DnD campaign. DM of the Rings inspired, of course. I figured it fits, since there are only a small number of (non-puzzle) fights to level with, and loot is sparse. <br><br>Have you seen the anime? </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve just read the books.<br><br>Also, the fact that the author&#39;s Australian makes a lot of sense-as Tv Tropes put it, Deltora&#39;s basically the fantasy equivalent of it. (Although I would personally nominate either the Vorox homeworld from Fading Suns, planet Fenrir from WH40K, Catachan from WH40K, or Zerus from Starcraft for that role.)<br><br>As for overfeeding, that&#39;s another beautiful thing about Deltora: there&#39;s a very low chance for any overfeeding to occur because there&#39;s a) a lot of different creatures that could happen upon a Sue, b) thousands of specimens of each species, meaning that there&#39;s a very low chance of the same individual getting a meal multiple times, and c) if any DO get fat and start associating sapient creatures with food, they won&#39;t last very long against the local bags of crazy that are the natives of Deltora.</p>

            <p>Meta-wise, it&#39;s also so that it doesn&#39;t become routine to just dump corpses in one place, though I suppose it&#39; not an issue in a fandom with less missions.

            <p>There&#39;s been debate in the past over whether capitalization minis even count; I know I&#39;ll usually skip them, because they&#39;re just boring.<br><br>But more than that: if a PPC author has chosen not to use a certain feature - such as minis - shouldn&#39;t you respect that decision, rather than making it for them? Would you also say &#39;seeing as OC #3 wasn&#39;t that bad, they should have been recruited, but it was never mentioned. As such, I am adopting them for myself&#39;? Or &#39;seeing as Agent #2 is a former Mary Sue, they should suffer from occasional regressions to their Suvian personality, but this was never mentioned.

            <p>I do it all the time, pointing out SPaG and continuity errors, and occasional a confusing narration or lack of canon knowledge, in recently published stories, so that the author(s) can correct their mistakes or explain their choices when I wasn’t aware that there is a choice.<br><br>It’s a bit different with older missions, where the author isn’t around anymore. You may argue that others still can learn from your concrit, even if the author never sees your comment, and that we should acknowledge that the PPC isn’t infallible.

            <p>Capitalization aside, the rules according to the wiki are clear: Minis are named, decided, chosen, whatever, by the first person to write a mission in that continuum, or the creator of a continuum&#39;s OFU. Seeing as how no known OFU exists for Deltora Quest (To my, and apparently anyone else&#39;s knowledge) then the only person who can create the first Deltora Quest mini is the first person to write a mission featuring them. Since this fellow sporker never wrote about the mini, nobody, and I mean NOBODY, can decide what the mini will be until we see one in a sporking. The wiki&#39;s page on minis is also clear that it is misspellings that make minis, while saying nothing about capitalization. The former is spelling, obviously, while the latter is grammar.<br><br>I don&#39;t mean to &#39;bother by the book&#39; so to speak, but I just felt that a post featuring the rules on the wiki might be helpful if this will be debated.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m just posting what I found in regards to what the rules regarding minis were. I honestly don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s misspellings or miscapitalization that produces a mini.

            <p>...it tends to work as &#39;author&#39;s choice&#39;. I personally do use capitalization minis, but I co-write with people who don&#39;t (mostly for convenience, I think). And what we tend to do here with published missions, unless there&#39;s something very problematic in them (generally <i>not</i> to do with minis, in my experience) <i>and they were just published pretty recently</i>, is to leave them be (unless the author is around and wants, of their own volition, to change it).<br><br>If the author of the first Deltora Quest mission (which, heyy! I used to read that! I don&#39;t remember much about it, but it was fun!) made the decision not to use capitalization minis--that was their choice, and we can&#39;t change it after the fact. Or, at least, it certainly seems like an extremely rude thing to do, especially without talking to the author (who, it seems, is Caddy-shack, which is <i>awesome</i>, I have a mission to read or reread now!) about it and getting their view on it. If you want your agents to have Deltora minis--why not get Permission and write a second mission set there, which establishes what the minis are? It&#39;s a good deal more polite, not to mention more usual for the PPC (as far as I know, old(er)bies can feel free to confirm or deny), and, really, is more polite than suggesting even in-universe that Agents Cadmar, Maria, and Mark just happened to miss a mini. Especially since you&#39;re not, to my knowledge, working with Caddy-shack on this (or even discussing it). How would you feel if someone did that to your agents, over a decision you made? If someone&#39;s agents were introduced together with, say, a mini blinking out of existence because their author didn&#39;t agree with you that capitalization minis should be used?<br><br>Or, to make this a bit more to the point: pretend you&#39;ve written the first mission for a canon. You chose not to create the new mini type because you don&#39;t use capitalization minis, or chose not to for this mission. Later, someone decides--without talking to you first--that they don&#39;t like this decision you made; instead of writing their own mission to that canon and creating the mini-type, they have the capitalization mini appear in HQ, with the acknowledgement that that canon suddenly has a mini-type, and say outright through their agents that your agents must have missed the mini or something. Would you seriously be okay with this? Would you seriously not find this rude, or potentially lazy (in the sense that this person could have gone looking for a fic to mission that uses the same mini, if they were attached to using that particular one, or could have had their agents be the first to officially meet said minis, which could be pretty exciting to write and to read)?<br><br>That&#39;s my take on it: it seems rude, quite unusual, and even rather lazy to create a mini-type--and a mini--this way. Capitalization minis are not used by everyone; retroactively editing around someone else&#39;s mission in this way seems rude, especially since it feels kind of insulting to the agents who did the mission; and the more polite--and, to my knowledge, more usual--thing to do would be to simply write a mission and create the mini-type yourself that way. And I&#39;ll stop there; I think I&#39;ve said everything I want to, and have even summed it up again at the end. Night, all.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Some people like to count capitalization errors, and others don&#39;t.  It&#39;s not a hard and fast rule, but respecting the original author&#39;s decision is.<br><br>As for my personal mini protocol: I won&#39;t name a new mini type for a fic that only features capitalization errors in the proper names.  If, however, at least one &quot;traditional&quot; mini appears in that mission, then I go ahead and count the capitalization errors as well, to maximize adoption potential.  So, in my first mission, I passed over making a mini out of &quot;fire chief&quot;, which is spelled &quot;fire-chief&quot; in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> (or vice versa; can&#39;t look it up on my phone) to avoid making a single mini for a very minor canon that sees almost no attention.  The same could be said for <i>Epic Mickey</i>, but my third mission featured actual typos of proper names, so I had no choice but to create a mini—and included the capitalization typos as well, to beef up the list of potential adoptions.<br><br>—doctorlit hopes this didn&#39;t get confusing.

            <p>The only thing that had given Falchion a moment&#39;s warning was the high-pitched screech from near the console, followed by a series of rapid-fire &quot;EEP&quot;s like a baby chick.<br><br>Springing to his talons and crossing the RC in just three strides, he ended up running straight into an unusually excited Ripper, who had apparently attempted to rush over to him instead.<br><br>&quot;Ripper, what the flock&#39;s gotten into you?!&quot; the Skarmory cried out in a mix of alarm and amusement, picking himself up. &quot;You&#39;re not usually this... excited.&quot;<br><br>Ripper, who had ended up sprawled on the floor with ruddy feathers everywhere, managed to get to his feet as well, breathing rapidly and noisily. &quot;Not when I am surrounded by creatures that shouldn&#39;t have evolved until millions of years after my time, no. But the fact that the <i>Saurian</i> dev team has been keeping up with the latest research for the sake of authenticity-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, what&#39;s going on?&quot; asked Suta. She had been visiting the two maniraptorans, in her human disguise, when the outburst had happened. &quot;What&#39;s a dev team, and why are you two on the floor?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He wasn&#39;t watching where he was going,&quot; Ripper replied in his usual deadpan tone. &quot;But I suppose it was my fault, too. I was indeed a little over-enthusiastic.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A <i>lot</i>,&quot; added Falchion, cocking his head. &quot;So, what&#39;s this about a dev team doing research? Since when was that even a thing?&quot;<br><br>There was silence for a moment, but the two of them could tell that Ripper had become visibly disappointed.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve never heard of <i>Saurian</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Suta. &quot;I know it refers to lizards, but-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Reptiles, in the broadest sense,&quot; Falchion corrected her. &quot;I mean, we all are, but birds are technically very specialized reptiles...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Back on topic,&quot; said Ripper, &quot;<i>Saurian</i> is an upcoming computer game that supposedly recreates the Hell Creek ecosystem as accurately as possible. No time-traveling humans, no volcanoes and tar pits, nothing but what&#39;s known to science.&quot;<br><br>Another moment of silence later, Suta spoke up again. &quot;So... You&#39;re gonna have to play as a Big Jaw?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>? Yes, that&#39;s one option among several different genera,&quot; replied Ripper. &quot;And plenty of others will be featured in the game as well. Including, I hope, a newly discovered member of my kin.&quot;<br><br>Falchion and Suta looked at each other.<br><br>&quot;Okay, what? Didn&#39;t they already find one of those?&quot; the Skarmory asked, cocking his head.<br><br>&quot;Yes, and that is a playable genus. But there is another. And it&#39;s bigger.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tell me more!&quot;<br><br>Ripper nodded, before leading them towards the console. The others read the article on the screen with wide eyes.<br><br>&quot;How big are we talking here?&quot; asked Suta.<br><br>Ripper&#39;s smile showed every one of his jagged teeth. &quot;Big enough to eat you for breakfast.&quot;<br><br>The disguised tyrannosaur felt her jaw drop. &quot;T-that big?! But a forty-foot-long Fast Biter isn&#39;t-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Scientifically plausible?&quot; asked Falchion, eyeing her slyly. &quot;Or are you just worried that you&#39;re no longer the apex predator around here?&quot;<br><br>Suta glared at him, but Ripper cut in before she could retaliate.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t worry. At your adult size, you will have nothing to fear. I cannot say the same for juvenile Big Jaws, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So... <i>Jurassic Park Velociraptor</i>-sized?&quot; asked Falchion.<br><br>&quot;Correct. And big enough to kill a juvenile tyrannosaur if it wanted to. They probably hunted the same prey, after all, albeit in different ways.&quot;<br><br>Suta punched her palm, glaring at nothing in particular. &quot;Well, those things should be lucky I&#39;m almost fully grown! I&#39;ll show &#39;em who&#39;s top of the food chain any day!&quot; She grinned and snorted, the effect slightly dampered by her temporarily flat-topped teeth.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll get your chance, Suta,&quot; said Falchion. &quot;When you play the game, that is.&quot;<br><br>She looked at him, surprised. &quot;When?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Look, tell you what: Once this <i>Saurian</i> game&#39;s released to the public, I&#39;ll do everything I can to get my talons on it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>We</i> will,&quot; Ripper added.<br><br>&quot;Then we can get together to play it!&quot; said Falchion. &quot;Think about it, dinosaurs playing a dinosaur game! How cool is that?&quot;<br><br>Suta beamed at them both. &quot;You two are awesome, you know that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed so,&quot; Ripper replied, smiling again. &quot;And yes, it would certainly be &#39;cool&#39;, in Falchion&#39;s parlance. Just like taking a walk in the woods, 65 million years ago. For real, this time.&quot;<br><br>----------<br><br>So yeah, <i><a href="http://saurian.maxmediacorp.com/">Saurian</a></i>. An upcoming survival game where you get to play as a scientifically accurate dinosaur in the Cretceous Hell Creek biome. I&#39;ve been following the development of this game for quite a while now, and as a palaeo-nerd myself, I can&#39;t help but be excited for it! Partly because the devs of this game pride themselves on accuracy, and they&#39;ve thoroughly researched every aspect of Hell Creek and its prehistoric inhabitants known to date. Suffice it to say, if you want to know what it&#39;s like to be a real, live T. rex, play this game when it comes out!<br><br>Incidentally, the announcement posts for the blog of this game were also how I learned of the new raptor genus discussed in the ficlet. Say hello to <i><a href="http://saurian.maxmediacorp.com/?p=771">Dakotaraptor</a></i>, a five-meter deinonychosaur with a fantastic name that was officially announced to science earlier today! Notable features include a 16-centimeter killing claw on the second toe, and quill nobs on a bone from the forearm (making this the largest known winged dinosaur to date). So yeah, we now know that JP-sized raptors lived alongside T. rex, and it&#39;s awesome to see that <i>Saurian</i> will hopefully include this amazing discovery in what&#39;s shaping up to be a fantastic game so far!<br><br>Read more about <i>Dakotaraptor</i> here: <a href="http://www.krank.ie/category/sci/nat/dakotaraptor-giant-raptor-hell-creek/"><a href="http://www.krank.ie/category/sci/nat/dakotaraptor-giant-raptor-hell-creek/">http://www.krank.ie/category/sci/nat/dakotaraptor-giant-raptor-hell-creek/</a></a></p>

            <p>I don&#39;t really care what a dinosaur does in an artistic depiction: if the artist chose to have a scaled raptor or a feathered T-rex, who am I to judge? It&#39;s still a dinosaur, one of the most magnificent animals to ever live.<br><br>Also, I loved that scene, too. One of the main reasons I liked Jurassic World was that it had a working park for most of the film, and the minor incidents that occurred in it, like the Pachycephalosaurus escaping, added to that for me-as someone who has worked at a zoo, the only real difference was that the animals were bigger.<br><br>(Yeah, #buildabetterfaketheropod is basically a glorified temper tantrum. Some good designs did come out of it, but very few really got the idea of what the Indominus was-she was a representation of Ingen&#39;s messing with nature.

            <p>The idea of being able to wander in a world where dinosaurs are allowed to be dinosaurs, rather than being forced to be movie monsters... yes, please. And I&#39;ve been really impressed with how hard they&#39;re working to make it accurate, too.<br><br>And, hey! Dinosaur discovery fills in gap in ecosystem, nice going, guys!

            <p>...but I follow a Let&#39;s Play of it on YouTube and it looks really fun, (in)accuracies aside.<br><br>Ripper probably would have more than a few issues with said inaccuracies, of course, but he wouldn&#39;t mind - as long as he gets to control a raptor army like in the old days.

            <p>Since Hardric already covered the usual questions, I will just give you your newbie gifts: A Bag of Holding, for the truckload of gifts you are about to get and a Rorschach Book, which can change into any written text in existence. Just close your eyes while holding it , think about what you wanna read and then blink three times.</p>

            <p>Thank you! I have read the OS and the Constitution (I was terrified I&#39;d mess something up or step on someone if I didn&#39;t), and I have wandered the trails of the Wiki. If you have any helpful tips/mistakes not to make that aren&#39;t already there, I&#39;d be most grateful.<br><br>I&#39;m currently in the thick of the Wheel of Time series (I&#39;m on book 6) so that&#39;s my newest one and my go-to right now. My oldest favorite is Star Wars, and one of my fanfic characters from my earliest stuff lives on to this day. I also love the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Right now a lot more of my writing is original stuff, though- it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve fanfic&#39;ed a good fanfic.<br><br></p>

            <p>Oh, another fan of Wheel of Time. Keep it up, this series is long, but totally worth it. Once you get to the ending you should also give a look to Sanderson&#39;s books, they picked him up for finishing this series for a reason.<br><br>Well, the Wiki should cover the bases, don&#39;t be so afraid of messing up though, I mean, this will happen someday, nobody is perfect, but the important thing is knowing how to move on after this.<br><br>But what about the PPC stories, did you saw Iximaz&#39;s rec list? it&#39;s a great debut if you&#39;re searching for new spinoffs.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re searching for new authors for fantasy, I also recommend Jim Butcher, who already has three different series for three genres:<br><br>- About fantasy, Codex Alera. Somebody betted that Butcher couldn&#39;t create a good series using Lost Roman Legion and Pokemon as bases. This someone lost very bad.<br><br>- For steampunk, his newest series, Cinder Spires, a post-apocalyptic world of towering spires, crystal technology and sentients cats, reminding us they are the finest creation of evolution.<br><br>-Finally, the jewel of the crown, his urban fantasy series the Dresden Files. Pure awesome, snark and drama, and this series will reconcile everyone with first-person prose.</p>

            <p>So, I have a certain non-PPC project on my mind right now, but it requires a huge (and I mean HUGE) knowledge about the UK, its culture, customs, etc.<br><br>This is why I&#39;m asking every subject of Her Majesty, who has some free time and knowledge to share, to be my consultant on all things British (No Canada or Australia, though, maybe later), because there is a limit to things you can research by yourself.
