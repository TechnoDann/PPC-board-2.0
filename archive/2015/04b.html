            <p>I&#39;ve seen several fics (mostly on Quotev) that advertise <i>yandere</i> versions of more-or-less stable canon characters, frequently targeting a reader-insert.  Why would anyone want to be in that situation?  It&#39;s not even like <i>Twilight</i>, where the creepy behavior is unacknowledged as such.  Maybe I&#39;m a hypocrite, since Yuno Gasai is one of my favorite characters, but it&#39;s not like I want to be Yukki, either.<br><br>On topic, you did a good job with this mission - I managed to follow it fine despite having no experience with the canon.  One thing you might want to do is mention that Tomoko and Mokocchi are the same person, as it took me a little bit to catch on to that.</p>

            <p>I know it may be unneccessary for me to say it becuase it&#39;s not related to anything, but...

            <p>I like you a lot. It usually takes me a while to warm up to new people, but you just seem so cheerful and friendly, and the way you talk about your sister is so heartwarming. Also, as a child of an alcoholic myself, you have my sympathies. Plus, you&#39;re Iximaz&#39;s fan, so you clearly have good taste, and she&#39;s my fan, so seeing her get fan-worshiped in her turn amuses me. ^_~ (I told her it would happen, too! Jokingly at the time, but still!)<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m glad to have you here, and I hope you stick around a long time. {= ) As a belated token of welcome, please accept this bumper sticker that reads &quot;Agents do it canonically.&quot;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>But I doubt the SPaG errors would get translated very well. That being said, I think it might not be much of a problem for most fics. I&#39;ve also thought about writing missions in French, but almost no one here would be able to read them. I <i>could</i> translate existing missions into French, though... I guess.</p>

            <p>Tell about the first time you saw a badfic. Most likely it happened before you even knew what a Mary-Sue was.<br><br>For me, my first was an LOTR fic. I don&#39;t remember much, but I do remember she sang &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; during the feast at Rivendell before the Council. She became a Walker and was singing a song from Michael Jackson as they left while Boromir and Aragorn argued over her worthiness. I thought it was odd that she was singing those songs in Middle Earth, all I could tell was that they seemed out of place.</p>

            <p>The only complaint about the mission I have is that it was a bit too MST-y, but seriously, how do you capture the sheer WTFness of the fic otherwise? (By the way, you created another mini: the J in J.K.

            <p>Though the fact that your missions are mostly short but sweet may have something to do with that.<br><br>This particular mission reminds me of the trollfic I myself killed on my second DF mission, though without the troll. Interesting how you had both replacements and a Sue-wraith, as it&#39;s usually a really powerful Suefluence that makes the canons act OOC. Though I guess that may be due to Harry being like... well, THAT from the get-go, while the replacements weren&#39;t brought in until a little later.</p>

            <p>and I liked how you told Lapis Lazuli’s back story, but the end is confusing. Where exactly did Rainbow-Hair and Fiery-Tail find the blue-haired girl?

            <p>Specifically, the plot hole ability was caused by her remembering that she traveled way too many miles over a few days - the area was supposed to correspond to coastal California, and starting from the equivalent to Los Angeles, they were about to end up in the southern tip of the state in a few weeks.<br><br>And I&#39;ve thrown in a little note in the ending that Lapis was found in the halls of the PPC HQ - the Wiki says that she fell straight into HQ after escaping her homefic, which is part of why she&#39;s so nervous all the time (the PPC specializes in killing Sues, after all).</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to pluck a random example of this from the place I was at when I decided to write. This isn&#39;t a specially-selected example, is what I&#39;m saying:<br><br><i>Lapis quivered in terror when Matt’s Dragonic Backlash sent Giga Bowser stumbling dangerously close to the group. The air shimmered around her again, but she stopped herself before she could escape through the plot hole. In the midst of the overly descriptive action, the disguised Pokémon trainer had begun to notice something.<br><br>“I’m a little disappointed that it took me this long to realize this, but… Did you guys hear something… off about the way the canons and the Stu were talking?”<br><br>“We were so focused on the scriptfic format we got ourselves into that we didn’t hear anything,” said Sarah. “At least I didn’t. I was too busy trying to reset the format.”<br><br>Cupid’s eyes widened a little, recalling how he’d gotten distracted while his partners were arguing. “While you ladies were squabbling and doing other stuff,” he mused aloud, “I noticed that all of the characters were saying their lines at the same time. It was a lot harder for me to notice who was saying what because of that, like so many voices at once.”<br><br>Sarah gasped. “I think I know why!” she cried. “The spoken lines were not given separate paragraphs!”</i><br><br>There&#39;s something really <i>off</i> about the way you write, and I&#39;m trying to pin down what it is. On the first hand, there&#39;s lines like this:<br><br><i>In the midst of the overly descriptive action, the disguised Pokémon trainer had begun to notice something.</i><br><br><i>Cupid’s eyes widened a little, recalling how he’d gotten distracted while his partners were arguing.</i><br><br>I get a really strange vibe off that sort of thing. I think it stems from the fact that the narrated &#39;actions&#39; are so... non-physical. You&#39;re telling us that Lapis noticed something, rather than showing us her reaction: did she raise an eyebrow? Was stopping herself a reaction to the noticing? Equally, you show us Cupid&#39;s action, then <i>explain</i> it. I don&#39;t think the explanation was necessary - I think it detracts from the narrative flow.<br><br>On the other hand, there&#39;s the dialogue. Example:<br><br><i>Sarah gasped. “I think I know why!” she cried. “The spoken lines were not given separate paragraphs!”</i><br><br>Imagine telling someone something, and hearing <i>that</i> as their reaction. It doesn&#39;t sound like speech; that&#39;s not how people talk. People talk more like this:<br><br><i>Sarah gaped. How had she <i>missed</i> that? Then her brow furrowed in thought. &quot;And I think I know why. It&#39;s the Words - the spoken lines didn&#39;t get separate paragraphs.&quot;</i><br><br>Your line reads as if Sarah had to wait for a dramatic flash of lightning to backlight her, and was expecting the scene to end immediately afterwards. &quot;We must enter the castle - and <i>destroy Dracula</i>!&quot; Drama like that isn&#39;t realistic.<br><br>And thirdly... how did they <i>not</i> notice that every single spoken line in the scene was said at exactly the same moment? It seems like something you&#39;d comment on at the time, not a mildly strange fact that you&#39;d pick up on later.<br><br>I dunno. Just... go read over that scenelet again, in isolation. Can you see what I mean about it sounding... strange?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Adverbs. Particularly adverbs attached to dialogue tags. And fancy dialogue tags, for that matter. You&#39;re really, really over using them.

It&#39;s just... distracting and unnecessary. Dialogue tags should be used to convey physical realities - mumbling, shouting, and yes, possibly grumbling - not details of tone; your dialogue should be covering that by itself.

            <p>Checking back on most of the narrative, I&#39;m pretty sure I used &quot;said&quot; a <i>lot</i> of times, but good call on the adverbs - I&#39;ve checked back and gotten rid of most of them. Likewise, the way I&#39;m explaining all the itty bits of the characters&#39; reactions along with the dialogue does sound a bit off-putting, though that may have been one of the side effects of me liking to write long textwalls and such. I may go over the interlude as well to see if I did the same thing - and I will do what I can to avoid doing that in future missions.<br><br>Regarding the &quot;every single line spoken at once&quot; thing, the agents didn&#39;t notice because they were paying attention to the fact that every line was in script format (which is also a very bad thing to do in a narrative fic), and they ended up scrambling to reset their own format when it got affected too.</p>

            <p>Well, Sarah <i>did</i> thank Captain Marvel that she wasn&#39;t  going to deal with sparkly vampires in &quot;Scarlet Disgrace&quot;.<br><br>This exact issue was actually brought up during the beta reviewing process - originally, Naraku WAS going to be a replacement, but said beta did not like the prospect of a character surviving after his canonical death being immediately branded as a replacement. Huinesoron did do one mission in which Boromir was brought back to life and ended up dying after the Sue was killed, for example. So the canonical Naraku being resurrected by the Stu specifically so he can kill him isn&#39;t an impossiblity; it&#39;s just that the agents had to kill him before the Stu did to successfully throw off the story.</p>

I&#39;m glad to meet you all (I&#39;ve been in chat a few times before, but not many of you were in there.), and I hope it&#39;s not too much to take another newbie on board.<br>  Some of my favorite canons include the Young Wizards series, Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs, Person of Interest, Generator Rex, the Discworld books, Steven Universe, and various original works.  <br>  I look up to all of you (especially the ones who&#39;ve published missions/other works recently - I have a blast reading your stuff!), and to a relatively large extent I&#39;m influenced by your opinions.  You mean a lot to me.  ^^<br>  So!  I hope you&#39;re doing well (and if not, I send Optional!Hugs and/or Good Vibes in your direction.), and that things go well here.</p>

            <p>Actually, speaking of Mamvish... I&#39;m wondering whether her Ordeal has certain parallels to Darryl&#39;s. Specifically, I&#39;m wondering whether the sum total of her &#39;Ordeal&#39; was in actually bringing herself to say the Oath.<br><br>I read Mamvish as being very... not quite self-centred, but definitely self-<i>confident</i>. I can&#39;t help but wonder if she used to be [even more?] arrogant and sure of herself - to the point where reciting an Oath which promises to help <i>everyone else</i>, rather than just doing what <i>she</i> thinks is right, might have been a serious challenge.<br><br>This is part of a wider musing, specifically: a lot of the Ordeals we know about seem to have one aspect of the wizard in question as both a challenge to overcome - and as the weapon they need to use. Kit is a loner who&#39;s more comfortable around machines - he has to learn to work with others (Nita, specifically), but also gets a lot of use out of inanimate objects. Dairine is... uh... enthusiastically naive, which gets her into heaps of trouble - but also lets her do &#39;the impossible&#39; simply because she refuses to admit that it <i>is</i> impossible.<br><br>I&#39;unno, maybe I&#39;m reading too much into it... but Diane <i>does</i> like to theme things like that. Even non-Ordeal things like Ponch in <i>War</i> fall into this pattern: he used his loyalty to Kit, but also had to overcome it.<br><br>By this theory, Mamvish&#39;s overconfidence in herself had to be overcome to actually read the Oath - but was also so powerful that the Lone Power bought it and &#39;had a headache&#39;. Like I say, it&#39;s just a theory - but it fits a lot of the facts.<br><br>(Which of course leads down the path of &#39;so what would MY weakness/strength be&#39;, but that way lies madness and/or utter thread derailment. Though the fact that there&#39;s canonically an instance of Middle-earth out there leads to some interesting notions...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I can just see him as a scruffy, irascible parrot... ^_~<br><br>I am left with the rather worrying thought that Middle-earth is like the Lone One&#39;s world in the very first book: a world mostly abandoned by the Powers. Seriously: from the moment they raised the Pelori, the Valar pretty much let Melkor and Sauron (both incarnations of the Lone Power, for my money - unless Melkor was just a patsy? That&#39;s possible, given that he&#39;s the one who kept getting captured...) have a free hand in the place.

            <p>I was thinking the Champion would be Manwe, but yeah, that does kinda suggest the PTBs gave up at some point.<br><br>On the other hand... Each race gets its own temptation, right? For the Elves, that would have to be the War of the Jewels, with Melkor being the incarnation of the Lone One. There could well have been wizards in play that we don&#39;t know about.<br><br>For Men, Numenor seems like a very good candidate—in which case they fail the test, even if the Lone One also suffers a setback—but Sauron continues to be active in the world. What if the real trial comes later, maybe sometime during the Fourth Age, when Men become the dominant race on the planet? In that case, there might well be wizards to make sure things don&#39;t go totally pear-shaped.<br><br>I have no idea if this makes any sense, or where it leaves the War of the Ring in the grand scheme of things... just throwing some thoughts out there.<br><br>And then, that raises the question of what happened with the Dwarves and Hobbits, or has it yet? ... And heck, how does the creation of the Dwarves fit in? Dairine created a new species (unless I am badly misremembering), so I don&#39;t see why one of the Powers couldn&#39;t, I guess.<br><br>(Our theory on Leof was that even the Lone One needs a break sometimes, especially when each of His incarnations is going through the rocky process of being redeemed. Infinity is a lot to keep track of. [Jenni got a dose of strong medicine on this subject later on.] Also, he was inspired by a couple fanfics: &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1487734/1/On-the-Care-and-Keeping-of-Shoulder-Angels">On the Care and Keeping of Shoulder Angels</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1514189/1/Welcome-to-Timeheart">Welcome to Timeheart</a>.&quot; They&#39;re what got me into the fandom, so they both have a special place in my heart.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I always had the impression that the Choice was close to the beginning of a race&#39;s lifespan. And we know that Tolkien wrote them in for both Elves and Men. The Eldar faced a Choice of whether to follow Orome or stay in the dark; Men...<br><br>Actually, I think I can meet you halfway. I don&#39;t think the Eldar had a single, unified Choice - Melkor never tried to tempt them at Cuivienen, and Orome showed up before he could. But we know the <i>Noldor</i> had a Choice - whether to listen to the counsel of the Valar, or to race off after Melkor. And, um... they call it the Fall of the Noldor for a reason. ;) So yes, I think the War of the Jewels was the Choice for the Eldar, spread across both halves of Middle-earth - and I think all the Elven races failed, one way or another.<br><br>The Noldor, obviously, went psychotic, with many of them actually <i>dealing</i> death to their own kin; House Feanor would definitely qualify as being under the Lone One&#39;s control. The Vanyar failed the other way - they stayed aloof from <i>everything</i>, just like the Valar were. There would never be a Vanyarin wizard, because the idea of interacting that much would be anathema.<br><br>The Teleri? They had a hard test, with the Kinslaying, and it&#39;s no <i>surprise</i> that they retreated into fear of death. But that was a victory for the Lone Power all the same (if not one for the Morgoth).<br><br>And the Sindar? I think the Girdle of Melian is their failure. They walled themselves off from the world out of fear, just like their cousins in Alqualonde.<br><br>And all of this happens <i>at the same time</i> - in the very short period between the death of the Trees and the First Battle (which was probably around the same time as the Kinslaying).<br><br>But what about Men? They didn&#39;t have long to wait. Andreth tells the story of how Men fell: by listening to the voice in the darkness, instead of the voice within. They learnt to fear death, to the point where they rejected the idea that they were born with it in place. In YW terms, what they rejected was the idea of Timeheart - the idea that there is a <i>good</i> reason to die out of the world. And except in a very few cases (early Numenor, and Aragorn), they never really remembered that.<br><br>I don&#39;t think Numenor or the War of the Ring were Choices, any more than the events of most YW books - dramatic though they are - were (though, come to think of it, Deep, High, and Holiday all are...). They were just the actions of the Lone Power in his majesty.<br><br>As to the other races: Hobbits are human, according to Tolkien, though I myself suspect some interbreeding with the Dwarves. And Dwarves... are very like Dairine&#39;s folk; they&#39;re made from rock, remember? They also have the look of a species which <i>didn&#39;t</i> particularly succumb to the Lone Power: they live a decently long time, and have at least rumours of reincarnation. I don&#39;t remember any of the dwarves we know particularly fearing death. Obviously they didn&#39;t pass with flying colours - that only happened once, we think - but they seem to have done pretty well.<br><br>And... oh, all right, one more:<br><br>Who can we peg as wizards among the Eldar? Elves who do their best to help everyone around them, to slow down the entropy of the universe, and are willing to give their own lives in order to continue that cause?<br><br>Well... I know, I know, it&#39;s me saying it... but that sounds a lot like Finrod. Y&#39;know, the guy who befriended every species he possibly could - who was <i>the</i> voice of reason in every confrontation between Elves which he could weigh in on - who expressed a deep interest in the details of the Fall of Man - and who, ultimately, gave up everything he had in order to free a Silmaril from the Lone Power&#39;s grasp.<br><br>And who died in the dungeons of <i>another</i> incarnation of the Lone One. Oh, I bet Sauron was <i>delighted</i> with that...<br><br>(Can you have two incarnations of the same Power in the same place? We know they can get as close as, say, Ireland and America - but can they actually meet? Can one aspect of the Lone Power follow the orders of another? I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a canon answer to that one...)<br><br>hS talks a LOT</p>

            <p>Wait, where are we on the Board? Yeah, still five threads under us - that&#39;s at least a day or two, even at current rates.<br><br>Another Ordeal: Ronan. What&#39;s his weakstrength? I&#39;m gonna go with &#39;unwillingness to surrender control&#39;. He spends a lot of time agonising about a certain passenger of his, and also gets very prickly when it looks like Nita&#39;s going to be running things in Ireland back in <i>Abroad</i>.<br><br>And on his Ordeal, we know he &#39;took in the sea&#39; to save the Roman invaders of Ireland. That was simultaneously using and overcoming his weakness: using, because the act itself was one of letting something vastly more powerful do something that really should have overwhelmed him, if he weren&#39;t so stubborn. Overcoming, because he <i>let the Romans land</i>, when he knew they could take over his country. For an Irish nationalist, that&#39;s a massive surrender of control, passing it off to other people - invaders.<br><br>See? The theory fits, or can be made to fit, which is close to the same thing.<br><br>As for myself, because self-inserts are fun... I&#39;d guess &#39;trivia&#39;. Because... well:<br><br>If you gave me magic powers, I would almost certainly transport myself into Middle-earth if I thought I possibly could. Not to stay or anything, but... just to see if it was <i>possible</i>. Which is very clearly the setup for an Ordeal - it occurs to me that except for Mamvish, all the Ordeals we know about take place away from their own world.<br><br>So there&#39;s me in Middle-earth, filled with trivia. I can easily come up with a bunch of scenarios that both make use of my trivia collection - both relating to Arda and relating to, y&#39;know, physics and such - and also drive home the point that a) I don&#39;t know everything, and b) just knowing isn&#39;t enough anyway.<br><br>If pressed for a plot... Numenor, in the last days, probably even after the Fleet has sailed to make war on Valinor. The Lone Power (Sauron) is physically present and, in fact, in absolute control of the island - except for a bunch of renegades who are about to flee, and Tar-Miriel, the dethroned Ruling Queen. We know, canonically, that Sauron lost his body in the Fall of Numenor, which was <i>not</i> his plan, and suggests possible wizardly intervention. We also know that Miriel died there - which lines her up neatly for the &#39;sacrifice&#39; theme of the story.<br><br>hS writes stories in his head, can you tell?</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s the thing...<br><br>I plan for one of me agents to be from &quot;The Secrets of Immortal Nicolas Flamel&quot; continuum.

            <p>Would it prevent Baba Yaga from eating sues if she does not know about the PPC? It would make a great assassination method, but I&#39;m with Neshomeh on this one. The fewer ordinary things that know about the PPC, the better. So, give Baba Yaga sues, but don&#39;t tell her what they are. By the way, I&#39;m not at all familiar with the continuum in question, so take my advice with a grain of salt.</p>

            <p>Probably not. It sounds like an okay idea for an execution method to me (and I know my friend Tungsten Monk would approve), but the trouble is that the PPC is a secret society, so people that know about it should be as few as possible. The agents could probably throw a Sue to Baba Yaga, but only if they neuralyze her afterwards.<br><br>BTW, a couple English language nitpicks:<br><br>1) the word &quot;my&quot; is possessive, not &quot;me,&quot; so you should have said &quot;I plan for one of <b>my</b> agents ...&quot; You got it right later in the post, though, so maybe it was a deliberate attempt to sound like a pirate? ^_~<br><br>2) When referring to a group in general, you don&#39;t need to use an article, so you can just say &quot;which created humanity&quot; and &quot;for killing Sues.&quot; If you&#39;re referring to a group of specific individuals, though, then you use an article (e.g. &quot;the Sues,&quot; these ones right here as opposed to any/all Sues). Also, watch out for group names that are always uncountable, like &quot;humanity.&quot; If you wanted to refer to specific members of humanity, you&#39;d have to say something like &quot;the people.&quot;<br><br>Hope that helps!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>. . .I&#39;ve always imagined that the Elders in the canon in question would be aware of the PPC, similar to how Aslan of Narnia is aware, due to their godlike and continuous nature.<br>Then again, there are a lot of Elders, and so there would a be a whole lot of characters who were aware, so maybe not. . .!</p>

            <p>In fact, most of them <i>shouldn&#39;t</i>. I think Aslan got in because he quote is unquote the Christian god; Iluvatar (Middle-earth) got in for the same reason. They&#39;re both theoretically omnipresent in their worlds, and suchlike.<br><br>It also helps that neither of them spend much time <i>intervening</i>.

Because that <i>should</i> happen.<br><br>Obviously, external viewpoint, the answer is &#39;because why would authors write that?&#39;.

If they did, and could apply that knowledge <i>next</i> time they saw their friends being controlled - do you really think they wouldn&#39;t take up arms against the Sue immediately? Since Gimli isn&#39;t prone to bashing in the heads of every Tenth Walker just outside Rivendell, we know that he <i>can&#39;t</i> be aware of what they are)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>On article creation, the caveat is that you shouldn&#39;t add new pages unless they&#39;re particularly relevant to the PPC. Good reasons to make a new continuum page are having an agent from and/or writing a mission in that &#39;verse. Otherwise, it&#39;s best not to. As I&#39;ve said before and will no doubt say again, it&#39;s PPC Wiki, not Random Stuff Our Members Like Wiki.

            <p>You&#39;ve heard of the Suvian Colour Spectrum, of course - urple, wilver, and so forth - but did you know there&#39;s also a <i>PPC</i> Colour Spectrum?<br><br><font color="Kaitlyn">Kaitlyn</font><br><font color="TechnoDann">TechnoDann</font><br><font color="Ca55ie">Ca55ie</font><br><font color="Desdendelle">Desdendelle</font><br><font color="Araeph">Araeph</font><br><font color="Phobos">Phobos</font><br><font color="Huinesoron">Huinesoron</font><br><font color="PoorCynic">PoorCynic</font><br><font color="VixenMage">VixenMage</font><br><font color="July Flame">July Flame</font><br><font color="Iximaz">Iximaz</font><br><font color="Neshomeh">Neshomeh</font><br><br>About a year ago - actually, right in the middle of the 2014 Shipfest - we <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255205;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">discussed at length</a> the technicalities of HTML&#39;s &#39;color&#39; coding. The HTML in question is [font color=&quot;word&quot;]Word[/font], with the []s obviously replaced by their pointy equivalent.<br><br>As it turns out, our PGs make a pretty decent spectrum. Phobos is a bit of an outlier - &#39;Phobos Black&#39; is technically a very dark green, but still looks like black. ;) I&#39;m quite taken by both Neshomeh Blue (the first of these colours <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255275;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">named</a>) and VixenMage Mint.<br><br>You&#39;ll note that I&#39;ve tweaked a couple of spellings - Cassie, Dann, and July all give colours too close to another (&#39;Cassie&#39; is very close to Kaitlyn Red, &#39;Techno-Dann&#39; is very close to Iximaz Blue, as is &#39;JulyFlame&#39;). You may <i>also</i> note that PoorCynic &#39;Green&#39; doesn&#39;t follow the rules - he ought to be only a smidgeon bright than Phobos, but something in the structure of the word changes him to, well, that.<br><br>So - where do <i>you</i> fall on the spectrum? We&#39;re totally missing the purples, and have very few mid-tones (because they need numbers in the hex codes, and most usernames lack those). Will you be the one to fill in the gaps?<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: All right, all right:<br><br><font color="Jay">Jay</font> is slightly darker than Phobos Black<br><font color="Acacia">Acacia</font> is a balanced orange with just a hint of blue</p>

            <p>Any letters other than abcdef just read as 0, so the only &#39;useful&#39; letter in TheShyIon is that &#39;e&#39; - which gets stripped out by the algorithm. Adding the spaces... uh... shouldn&#39;t change that, since the HTML should just read &#39;The Shy Ion&#39; as 00[e0] 00[00] 00[00], which is still black... but for <i>some reason</i> is using the sections in [here] instead.<br><br>Let&#39;s test this! (My method of figuring out the exact hex code is simple: take a magnified screenshot, read the numbers from MS Paint, then convert them to hex.)<br><br><font color="The She Ioe">The She Ioe</font> comes out as   e0 e0 e0, and confirms that the &#39;wrong half&#39; reading carries through the whole word. What about if we add some earlier valid letters?<br><br><font color="Tee She Ioe">Tee She Ioe</font> actually comes out as ee 0e 0e; so it&#39;s clearly counting <i>from the first valid letter</i>. Is it only doing that when the &#39;first letter&#39; falls in the first third of the string?<br><br><font color="Thy She Ioe">Thy She Ioe</font> is 00 e0 e0, meaning it&#39;s still dropping the &#39;first halves&#39; even when there&#39;s nothing weird in the red block. So <i>why</i> is this happening?<br><br><font color="00e 00e 00e">00e 00e 00e</font> is still e0 e0 e0, meaning it&#39;s nothing to do with the letters used.<br><br><font color="00e000e000e0">00e000e000e0</font>, still the same. Does it just not like 12-item strings? (Yes, &#39;The Shy Ion&#39; is 11, but it automatically adds one to make it a multiple of three).<br><br><font color="00e0000e0000e00">00e0000e0000e00</font> is the 15-letter equivalent, but is <i>still</i> grey. Maybe it&#39;s just the letter &#39;e&#39;?<br><br><font color="00c 00c 00c">00c 00c 00c</font> and <font color="009 009 009">009 009 009</font> are also grey, meaning they&#39;re also skipping the &#39;first halves&#39;.<br><br>Come to think of it, this is exactly what&#39;s going on with <font color="PoorCynic">PoorCynic</font> - the middle &#39;rCy&#39; cluster is forcing the HTML to start each cluster from the middle. PoorCynicGreen is 00 c0 0c, so it&#39;s definitely reading &#39;nic&#39; from the middle, too (to get that &#39;c&#39; in there). And those are <i>three</i>-letter sections.<br><br>New guess: if every &#39;block&#39; starts with a 0, those 0s are cut off and pruned back until one block finds a letter. So <font color="Neshomeh">Neshomeh</font> reads as nEs hom Eh0, and doesn&#39;t truncate (giving 0E 00 E0); <font color="Neshomuh">Neshomuh</font> is nEs hom uh0, so truncates to read as E0 00 00. Okay. That works.<br><br>But... what about <font color="TheShyIon">TheShyIon</font>, which appears as pure black despite having a non-fronting &#39;e&#39;? Well, actually... it doesn&#39;t. ^_^; The precise hex value of <font color="TheShyIon">TheShyIon</font> is 0e 00 00 (or a red value of 14 in Paint); it&#39;s very slightly red.<br><br>So to tighten up our theory: each third of the string is &#39;pruned&#39; from the front until the first letter of one isn&#39;t a 0 - <i>or until there are only two letters left in it</i>. &#39;<font color="TheShyIon">TheShyIon</font>&#39; can trim far enough to bring the &#39;e&#39; into the second position, but it&#39;s the last letter in its cluster; it can&#39;t become the <i>first</i> letter, because then it wouldn&#39;t have a second letter after it.<br><br>(Alternately, this could be consistent with the suggested mechanism for 3-letter strings: they take each letter as a hex value, then add a zero in front of it. So <font color="FFF">FFF</font> becomes 0f 0f 0f, and <font color="TheShyIon">TheShyIon</font> becomes <font color="eyn">eyn</font>, which becomes 0e 00 00. Consistency!)<br><br>... did I solve it? I think I solved it. Er, with rather too many words...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Because you&#39;re wrong. XD<br><br>Sorry, sorry. More precisely, your perception of colour disagrees with the raw data. The Librarian comes out at 0b a0 a0, which is slap bang between blue and green. That&#39;s a location I&#39;d label &#39;turquoise&#39;, or &#39;blue-green&#39;.

            <p>This is more going off the comment about science vs. magic, but there&#39;s a difference between Real World science and fictional science.  While alchemy may be powered by a real concept, it doesn&#39;t exist in reality, so it&#39;s not <i>just</i> the movement of the tectonic plates that makes alchemy work.  While that&#39;s the in-universe explanation, the out-of-universe (between-universe?) reason is that the Words are what makes it work.<br><br>That said, I&#39;d say that alchemy would possibly function in badfic, especially ones that have a tenuous grasp of their own continuum&#39;s mechanics.  Basically, the badfic weakens the solidity of the Words by creating contradictory elements, and the agents can bend it further to cheat a bit.  It&#39;s frowned upon, because they&#39;re making a bad thing worse, but in a sticky situation it might be the only way out.<br><br>To use a concrete example, I&#39;d say that alchemy wouldn&#39;t work at all in the canon Potterverse any more than it would in World One.  In a badfic that clings pretty close the mechanics of the original, it might be possible for an agent to make it work, but it would destabilize the continuum and exacerbate the issues caused by the badfic.  It would probably be less effective overall and require more effort, and the Flowers would be likely to be displeased if they found out.  On the other hand, in a badfic that makes major alterations to the Potterverse magic system, or is just so poorly structured that canon in general is being stretched to the braking point, a bit of alchemy would be a drop in the ocean, though a lot of alchemy might make things better, not worse.<br><br>In the case of a crossover, the agent would have to follow whatever rules were established by the fic, no matter how bad it is.  If it&#39;s specifically stated that Ed can&#39;t use alchemy at Hogwarts, neither can an agent, even if the logic used violates canon (or is just really, really stupid).<br><br>Finally, I don&#39;t think that an alchemist agent would be useless just because they can&#39;t use their powers.  After all, a lot of agents don&#39;t have any kind of powers whatsoever, and they contribute just as much.  Plus, a character used to relying on their abilities, especially ones as flexible as alchemy, having to cope without them would make for a good story.</p>

            <p>As for why, spoilers for anyone who hasn&#39;t seen the first anime.<br><br><br><br><br>Basically, in the first anime, Edward gets stuck in an alternate reality. Our reality, in fact. And his alchemy doesn&#39;t work. Admittedly, I haven&#39;t seen The Conqueror Of Shamballa, so I don&#39;t know if that was a temporary thing for Edward, but I&#39;m pretty sure it just doesn&#39;t work over here. And this is the first anime we&#39;re talking about, so it is sort of it&#39;s own continuum, but it is also the only adaptation to deal with alternate reality, so I would apply its rules to this situation. Of, course, I have no idea what would happen if an agent got their hands on a Philosopher&#39;s Stone, but it would be... interesting. Also, my memory is terrible, so correct me if I got anything wrong.</p>

            <p>You are right about Conqueror of Shambala from what I remember, but I was more so honing in on the Manga/Brotherhood Continuum.  I do consider the 2003 Anime a separate thing all together.<br><br>If the Alchemist was form the 2003 Anime Universe then I think you are right.  But I was more curious about the Manga/Brotherhood Universe.  Because, frankly if I were to use a character from the FMA Universe it would be Manga/Brotherhood not 2003 Anime.  Just because of personal tastes.<br><br>And an agent with a Philosopher&#39;s Stone, would be bad.  Just very bad.  I see a Kimbley-like character with that.  No one is going to be looking pretty with that.<br><br>But even if we were to hold the 2003 Anime as true as what would happen, which makes a certain degree of sense, except things end up substantially different, even in how certain things work (Like the homunculi).  Even some of the Alchemy rules seem different between the 2003 Anime and Brotherhood.<br><br>But now a follow up.  Do you think that even if it were not possible in this reality, what about a reality that clearly has magic?  Like the Tolkienverse for instance?  Would it still not work there?<br><br>So I suppose the real next question is, would it not work because of its Magic Nature?  Or because of the raw source?  Is there something inherently different about the tectonic movements of the FMA world than our own?   </p>

            <p>...Then screw it. It doesn&#39;t say that alchemy doesn&#39;t work in alternate realities, so do whatever allows you to provide a better experience for the reader. If you were considering an agent from that continuum, then they have to bring something to the table. Alchemy could be useful. I was only using the 2003 anime because it, conveniently enough, provided a less murky book of guidelines on how alchemy works. Although on the subject of the Philosopher&#39;s Stone, then it might be funny to have an agent trying to make a stone from sues. Especially if it doesn&#39;t work, or does work, but it just makes glitter objects. So, to summarize, if you can write a good alchemist, then do so. But I would just restrict them to magical continuums, if only for the sake of drama. You can&#39;t have a good fight if your agent just turns the sue&#39;s sword into cheese and then shanks them.</p>

            <p>It would only be used in very specific situations.  Namely Magical Continua or Sues/Possession Sues that normal tactics wouldn&#39;t work on.  Like someone mentioned an Alucard Possession Sue from Hellsing.  Or a Muto Sue from Godzilla.  Things were the &quot;Godzilla Threshold&quot; would have been crossed, wherein the agents could do no more real harm to the cannon than what the Sue would have done.  Military training on the other hand, is a different story.<br><br>And a Sue Philosopher Stone?  I feel like it would probably cause really nasty rebounds.<br><br>I do not even know if I plan on going that route anyways.  I would not necessarily restrict Alchemist Agent to those continua, but would restrict the use of Alchemy to those.  Or alternatively give him/her an Achilles Heel not unlike Mustang&#39;s ignition gloves and water.    </p>

            <p>Alchemy as a Godzilla threshold measure sounds very good to me. And you also mentioned a way to prevent them from being useless outside of those continua, which is to say, training. I would just be careful about skirting the boundary between &quot;Oh god why did we hire this guy, he&#39;s completely useless&quot; and &quot;Ok, this guy just blew up a sun with alchemy and litmus strips combust in his presence&quot; because it&#39;s a very fine line to walk. But I think you could probably walk it, and an agent who can use alchemy could be very useful indeed. If you do go this route, I would be quite fascinated to see where it goes!</p>

            <p>I am thinking of something similar to Mustang.  I.e., career officer who happens to be an alchemist.  I might use electricity as the type of alchemy, because it seems under represented in FMA as a whole, and it also would be useful as a tool, because of things like undervolting, etc., where it can be at different levels without breaking either the rules of Alchemy or Electricity.  It allows a greater degree of flexibility.<br><br>For example PPC Regulations might prevent him from using it (even if it would work) in a non-magic universe.  Then only up to a certain level in magic ones.  And if it were to be in either the FMA universe (either of them) or you hit that Godzilla Threshold, then all bets are off.  That way the theoretical agent would not upstage any cannon character.  Even in the FMA universe I only imagine the power comparable to Mustang pre-Promised Day.<br><br>But the way I see this character, he would not work well with the prospective agent I already have created.  Its more of a back-burner thing now.      </p>

            <p>But, what I am kind of getting at is the source is something that all continua have in common, i.e., tectonic movements.  Also in the FMA world it is science not magic.<br><br>So using what is known about the rules of Alchemy is that the power used comes from using the natural energy of the planet.  Now to be fair, I do not think Arakawa was particularly clear in explaining all the finer points of how Alchemy works.<br><br>But as I said I am just kind of looking for ideas on it.

            <p>It&#39;s a story inspired by a conversation on this very Board, specifically <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=271077;search_term=black+elves">AdmiralSakai&#39;s musings</a> about equality in fanfiction, and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=271079;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">my response</a>. The question that arose was: how far from Tolkien&#39;s cultural norms can you stray before you twist the canon out of alignment?<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11184632/1/Intransitives">Intransitives</a> is my answer, and the answer is: a very long way. None of my five main characters are the ones Tolkien would have written, but I&#39;ve tried very hard to fit them into his world. Along the way, I&#39;ve had to come up with names for Entwives, Dwarves, Hobbits, Sindar, and Gondorians (and honestly, I don&#39;t know which was hardest); I&#39;ve taken you everywhere from Second Age Eregion to Third Age Southern Gondor; I&#39;ve discovered that Tolkien invented a currency, and discoursed on the ritual of dwarven marriage.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11184632/1/Intransitives">Intransitives</a> is five chapters, and is complete (unless I get any really good new ideas). Each chapter is more of a character profile with a hint of story, rather than a complete tale - full-length stories wouldn&#39;t focus so heavily on what makes these characters different! Apart from that, if I&#39;ve written something that seems offensive, please point it out to me - I certainly wasn&#39;t trying to!<br><br>And in general, I&#39;d love to hear everyone&#39;s thoughts on the stories. Every writer loves reviews, no?<br><br>(<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11184632/1/Intransitives">Intransitives</a> is a spiritual sequel to <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9998481/1/Tenth-Walkers">Tenth Walkers</a>, wherein I proved that Tenth Walkers can make perfect sense. If you haven&#39;t already read that one, why not go back and do so now? ^_~)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, who doesn&#39;t love some fuzzy little hobbits? They&#39;re like rabbits - you adore them unless they&#39;re actually in the process of biting you. ;)<br><br>Seriously, though, I&#39;m kind of surprised there <i>aren&#39;t</i> more disabled hobbit kids in fanfic. The Shire has the tech level to make it not too much of an inconvenience for storytelling (Hal has a little cart pulled by a pony, for the record, though it didn&#39;t make it into the story), and if you&#39;re including hobbit children at <i>all</i>, you&#39;re doing it to tug heartstrings. ;) So it seems like an &#39;easy&#39; thing to write in (though not necessarily to write well).<br><br>On the other hand, there&#39;s not whole heaps of stories set purely in the Shire; maybe that&#39;s it. Or maybe they <i>do</i> exist, and I&#39;ve just never seen them.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>One thing I will do, since I got 2/3 of the way through it, is finish up the <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2BqT7Icn8igY251ZnRzYWJNRkU&amp;usp=sharing">Virtually Everything PPC On FFN Archive</a>. The only things I skipped were Indemaat&#39;s stuff (because, srsly) and my own (because I know I&#39;ve got those backed up). It&#39;s not HTML&#39;d, and I haven&#39;t gone over it with an editing hand, but it <i>is</i> a publically-accessible backup.<br><br>(I did discover, while doing it, that &#39;PPC&#39; is also used occasionally on FFN for &#39;Peter Pan Complex&#39; - but only in Spanish-language stories. Weird)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Or at least, that&#39;s the only way I can make sense of this.<br><br>In the final chapter of the <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1694572/8/Protectors-of-the-Plot-Continuum-GS-division">Golden Sun division&#39;s stories</a>, two new departments are introduced. The Department of (Lack of) Public Relations is fine - quite funny, actually, or would be if it did anything. We might want to grandfather it in. But the other one is... uh...<br><br>Okay, look: it&#39;s the Department of Author Correction. Yes, <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndHence.htm">the one that killed Daphne Illian</a>. They operate in exactly the same way - their description runs like this:<br><br><i>The job of the PR people was to make sure that no one knew of the existence of the PPC, and that no lasting harm was done. This meant rebuilding after disasters like this one, heavy neuralizer work, and nursing the &#39;clients&#39; from the Department of Author Correction back to health. This put them at odds with the Department of Author Correction, who were charged with making sure that the authors responsible for disasters like this one were in a lot of pain for a long time. In this business, sometimes you just had to hurt someone.</i><br><br>That&#39;s Author Correction, all right. Only...<br><br>-That was written in 2004.<br>-I didn&#39;t invent <i>my</i> DA...il 2008.<br>-The DAC doesn&#39;t come into <i>existence</i> in my timeline until 2025 at the earliest.<br><br>The only conclusion I can draw is that the GS division missions take place in the future - in fact, in the future of a timeline the main PPC history has diverged from. Which is... interesting? Scary? Both?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I stumbled across that at some point—even added both of those to the List of (Discontinued) Departments with the conclusions that the DAC was shut down for being yucky and the DPR was absorbed into the DIO, due to its secrecy-preserving function. I think I wanted to prevent anyone from reviving these concepts on the basis of precedent, especially the DAC. &gt;.<br>I like the idea of retroactively setting the Golden Sun Division in an alternate timeline, though, future or otherwise. It doesn&#39;t really follow the rules anyway, so that would make me feel better about it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Nobody knows about the DIO, so it&#39;s a very convenient dark hole in which to sweep any old dust we might not want floating around.

            <p>Just be yourself like most of us do. I did masquerade as a Skarmory back when I first joined (and I still do, to some extent), but not all of us pose as a specific character of our creation. That character usually becomes our first agent, as was the case with Agent!Desdendelle, Rina Dives, and my own agent, Falchion.<br><br>As for where you can upload missions, almost all of us use Google Docs (usually via writing the mission, getting it beta-read, sharing it publicly, and posting a link to the doc on the Board). Other sites tend to suffer from server problems, and quite a few oldbies who&#39;ve been here longer than I have can probably attest that FanFiction.net is total crap. XD</p>

            <p>It could even be one that you still love today.<br><br>Mine, you ask? &quot;The Whipping Boy&quot; by Sid Fleischman without a doubt, published in 1987. I still read it sometimes. It uses one true fact from medieval days and bases a whole story around it. Short, but still with a good plot, and not babyish. Certainly not for babies. More for ages nine/ten and up. But it&#39;s a great story to open the eyes to the wonders of reading at a young age. A story that can do that and not sound like it&#39;s only written for kids is a rare gem.</p>

            <p>This may cause some controversy, so sorry in advance. <br><br>I personally liked the stories of the Bible. The Old Testament, in particular, was what seems to me today like a very big story that runs off itself. Of course, I see it that way because my College requires that I study the Bible, but at the time of my childhood, I still loved it.<br><br>There&#39;s the story of the Garden of Eden, where the serpent lies to Adam and Eve about the fruit (which, as I learned, contrary to popular belief, was probably not an apple). And what&#39;s a good story without a good Curse?<br><br>Then there was the story of Cain and Able, who were most definitely not very good sibling role models. Well, Cain wasn&#39;t, but you could argue that a dead man isn&#39;t a good role model either.<br><br>After that was the story of Noah and the Ark. Whether you&#39;re a Christian or not, this story is a good example of how, in the words of my late grandfather, &quot;not to take no s*** from nobody.&quot;<br><br>There was the story of the Tower of Babel. I will never look at John Lennon&#39;s &quot;Imagine&quot; the same way ever again. (Hippie) Sorry, I just don&#39;t trust hippies very much. One stole my wallet.<br><br>After that was Abraham, who was ready to make the sacrifice of his own son, despite the fact that he was his only son, and despite the fact that God promised to make his line into a great nation. If you ever want to brush up on suspense, try the story of Abraham almost sacrificing his son Isaac. (Not that I&#39;m suggesting that EVERYONE read the Bible. I mean, you can if you want to, but I&#39;m not going to make anyone do anything.)<br><br>Then there was the story of the life of Jacob. Interestingly enough, &quot;Jacob&quot; or Ya&#39;aqov, in Hebrew, means, more or less, &quot;liar.&quot; That doesn&#39;t really sound politically correct, does it? That the father of the Twleve Tribes of Israel, and therefore the Jews, is named &quot;liar?&quot; I&#39;m not saying anything anti-Semitic at all, I swear. I&#39;m just stating the facts. (If this is an example of the Laws of Cosmic Irony, then it&#39;s a rather offensive one, to the culturally sensitive, sort of like myself, I guess.)<br><br>After that is the story of Joseph and the coat of many colors. Who knows? Maybe the coat was tie-dyed. (I still don&#39;t trust the hippie movement. *hides wallet*) Interestingly enough for the story of Moses, Joseph was the one who built what Moses wanted to break apart.<br><br>The story of Moses was an interesting one. To start with, Moses was a killer. He killed a man, &quot;with this thumb&quot;. (Reference!) Then he comes back to tell Pharaoh to screw off the Jews, despite the fact that Moses had a speech impediment of some kind. Then he did the Ten Plagues, and whupped Pharaoh&#39;s butt. Then after that, he had to deal with the whining people he had just saved. (You&#39;d think that God&#39;s chosen people would have been more appreciative, but I&#39;m saying this in hindsight, so...) Then Moses brought the Ten Commandments, and- And this is what most people don&#39;t know. Moses actually BROKE the Ten Commandments. By smashing the tablets in a fit of anger. Long day at work, I guess. <br><br>Then there was the story of Joshua. It&#39;s not just a story about walking around Jericho until it fell down. His story is a story about spies, and prostitutes (*insert Lil&#39; Jon &quot;YAYAH!&quot; here*), and freaking GIANTS, and the simultaneous circumsion of an entire arm- eh, never mind...<br><br>After that was the gruesome Book of Judges. People get gang raped, children get burned alive, and an entire army of Philistines get slaughtered by a single man with the jawbone of a donkey. In the last case, I&#39;m talking about Samson. A Canon Sue? I think he was. He was a jerk, he was uncouth, he was sexist, he was bitter, and he died seeking revenge. But if he were from the Lord of the Rings, Samson would have been on Jay and Acacia&#39;s hit list, no doubt about it.<br><br>Then there was the extremely depressing story of Job, but I won&#39;t go into that. We want happy thoughts here. (Despite what I have already brought to the table.)<br><br>Then comes a story that, even if you don&#39;t believe the Bible, is a very good story, if for no other reason than that it has a bad guy, a good guy who becomes what the bad guy should have been, and a freaking GIANT! David. Yeah, his is a great story, and it starts with King Saul. Saul was a great military leader, he was a hunk, and he was a political compromiser. He wanted everyone to feel happy. But he screwed up, so God decided that David should be king. David comes on the radar when he kills Goliath, a towering showoff who turns out was all show and no... No nothing, actually. He was beaten by a child who threw rocks at him. Come to think of it, Goliath kinda sucked. Anyway, David is the new superstar, and Saul feels threatened by this, and tries to have David killed. But David goes into hiding, and Saul is killed in battle with the Philistines. <br><br>David&#39;s son Solomon was an interesting character. He would probably not be on the list of Canon Sues of the Bible, despite his supposedly being one of the wisest men in history. (To all you ladies reading this, notice that I said &quot;wisest man&quot; in history. Gender equality, am I right?) Unfortunately for &quot;the wisest man in history,&quot; he made some very stupid mistakes. He had I think seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines! I know, right? Imagine the reality TV show that would create. (*shudder*) But Solomon then gets clinically depressed, and gets in real deep to theology and the philosophy of being happy, and lots and lots of existential stuff that it isn&#39;t my place to explain without stepping into &quot;I&#39;m preaching a sermon&quot; territory. And I have a responsibility not to do that here, because not everyone agrees with my views. This isn&#39;t about existential theology, it&#39;s about a good story. Or in my case, a lot of them.<br><br>Then came the Prophets. Oh boy, the Prophets. First of all, according to my Old Testament professor, these guys only showed up when people were screwing up pretty badly, so this is the point where stuff starts to get &quot;good,&quot; to use a subjective term in regards to storytelling.<br><br>The most famous of the Prophets among the children of the church is Jonah, who was, according to the story, eaten by a fish and spat back out at Nineveh when he tried to avoid going there to preach. (Cosmic Irony strikes again!) The smell was probably pretty bad, but hey! At least he got a free ride, right? But Jonah was kind of a whiner. <br>- Jonah: &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to Nineveh! I don&#39;t wanna go to Nineveh!&quot;<br>- God: &quot;Go to Nineveh.&quot;<br>- Jonah: &quot;I don&#39;t wanna eat my peas!&quot;<br>- God: &quot;Jonah, eat your peas.&quot;<br><br>Then came a lot of other prophets who had hard to pronounce names, but they worked in the time that led up to the split of Israel into Israel and Judah. <br><br>Oh, I forgot to mention my favorite prophet. <br><br>Nobody knows his real name. Nobody knows where he came from. He couldn&#39;t read. He couldn&#39;t write. He didn&#39;t bathe, and he never knew how to use a comb or a razor. He never lived in a house in his life, and he ate grasshoppers. He was called a mad man, and these claims weren&#39;t altogether unsubstantiated. He called himself Elijah. He challenged the King of Israel, who succumbed to the peer pressure of his wife Jezebel, and began worshipping Baal. Elijah challenged the Baal prophets to a game of sorts, and set the date and set the rules of the game. The Baal prophets would pray to Baal, and Elijah would pray to God. If Baal set his altar on fire, then he was real. If God set his altar on fire, then He was real. But instead of going at the same time, Elijah waited for the Baal prophets. He laughed at them, insulted them, and got all snarky and sarcastic with them. Eventually, the Baal prophets began cutting themselves to get Baal&#39;s attention. (By the way, if there are any cutters reading this, know that we are here for you.) Then it was Elijah&#39;s turn. He was so confident that he actually poured three large jars of water on his altar. According top the story, God not only managed to set it on fire, but he disintegrated it. Marvin the Martian wants that weapon, and he wants to point it at our planet.<br><br>Eventually, Israel and Judah both get carried away into captivity in Babylon and Assyria. This doesn&#39;t last though, and the Jews return home. But things aren&#39;t the same anymore, and the Old Testament ends.<br><br>Now, I want to reiterate something very important. I am NOT here to evangelize to anyone. I&#39;m not here to preach. All I&#39;m saying is that the Bible has a healthy variety of fascinating stories. As a child, I had to read these stories. And I enjoyed them. I didn&#39;t understand the existential theological and philosophical implications of the Bible, and I didn&#39;t understand some of the big words, but I understood that these were good stories. My personal favorites were the stories of Moses the killer-turned-leader, Elijah the madman prophet, and David the king. From story telling standpoints, these could all be used to make some very great variations, and I believe that even secular people would enjoy them. Just my opinion, but still... <br><br>Now, if I could find a Quran to read, I may say something similar about the stories I find in there. I don&#39;t know, because I have never read the Quran. I would try to say the same thing about an Atheist work of literature, but I&#39;m taking Biology here in college, and it&#39;s really not my favorite class. Okay, I&#39;ll admit that that may have been bad taste to say that about Atheists, because there are Atheists who are not Biologists. After all, Mark Twain was an Atheist. John Milton was an Atheist. Jason Aaron, a guy who wrote for Marvel Comics, was an Atheist. So I guess Marvel Comics could be a reasonable example of Atheist literature, and one that they can be proud of and be given credit for, even by us Christians. Credit where credit&#39;s due. Thank you, Atheists.<br><br>I&#39;m floundering here. Just trying to avoid controversy. I promise that I am not trying to offend anyone, and I&#39;m not trying to provoke a conversation about religion, or philosophy, or anything like that. That would be SERIOUS BUSINESS, and we don&#39;t like that here.<br><br>I&#39;m gonna shut up now before I make things worse for myself.<br><br>Thanks for listening and understanding what I&#39;m getting at here (hopefully).<br><br>Dark Brother 16  </p>

            <p>Honestly I loved all the Dragonlance books, but I started with War of the Lance when I was about six. When I was a little older, around ten, my dad let me read the Drizzt Do&#39;Urden books, and I really enjoyed those too.<br><br>Also when I was in first grade I read the Hobbit like five times, but I haven&#39;t read it since I was twelve so I wouldn&#39;t call it a favorite.

            <p>I loved learning. Still do, as it happens. Knowledge is power, guard it well. So educational books aimed at children that <i>don&#39;t suck</i>? Count me in. I have every single Horrible Histories book, every Horrible Science, every Horrible Geography, and even some of the weird off-brand versions like Dead Famous and The Knowledge. I used to just sit there, reading and learning, making my mind better because even then I knew my body was just... wrong, in a way I couldn&#39;t really articulate.<br><br>But since this isn&#39;t PBS, <i>Harry Potter</i> all the way.</p>

            <p>As I grew older, it was <i>Animorphs</i> and <i>Goosebumps</i>.  I still remember <i>Animorphs</i> extremely fondly, and consider it one of my main fandoms.<br><br><i>Goosebumps</i> I don&#39;t remember as well, and . . . Actually, for fun last year, I reread all the <i>Night of the Living Dummy</i> titles and it really didn&#39;t hold up.  The whole, &quot;the parents don&#39;t believe the children about the supernatural thing&quot; thing approaches the neglectful, and the way the siblings in some of the stories are so mean to each other feels really unrealistic now.  I would still recommend #10 of the original series, <i>The Ghost Next Door</i>.  It&#39;s very atypical of <i>Goosebumps</i>, and has a sweet little story.<br><br>And yes, I still have the full series of both, displayed on my bookshelves.  :)</p>

Wouldn&#39;t fancy sending any agents up against him. ^^;<br><br>And I never really got into <i>Captain Underpants</i> thanks to there being only one (The Attack of Professor P. P. Poopypants, if I remember correctly) in my school&#39;s library and my mom felt they were too crude for me to read. :/ Now I feel deprived.<br><br>Actually, most of my major fandoms I discovered when I was pretty young: <i>Animorphs</i>, <i>Percy Jackson</i>, <i>Ranger&#39;s Apprentice</i>, <i>Artemis Fowl</i>,  trilogy, <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i> and <i>Septimus Heap</i> were all discovered below the sixth grade year, though it doesn&#39;t seem like all that longbago to me.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been way too long since I read it. I can&#39;t even remember how I got it, but I carried it around with me constantly for years. If I remember correctly, they were going to make a movie out of it, weren&#39;t they?<br><br>I dunno if I&#39;d recommend reading Captain Underpants now. They are rather crude and silly and I don&#39;t remember actually how immature they were. You might not be missing out on that much. I found them a riot when I was a kid, though.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ve not read a lot of those series you listed (and I&#39;ve never even <i>heard</i> of Septimus Heap). I know one of my classes has a copy of the first Percy Jackson novel. I&#39;ve been considering picking it up, maybe after I&#39;m done with Fool Moon.</p>

            <p>Somehow, <i>The Divide</i> trilogy got cut from the list. :/<br><br>Anyway, <i>Septimus Heap</i> is pretty darn good. It involves a seventh son of a seventh son who&#39;s apprenticed to the high wizard (wizards can be both male and female, and witches are a different breed of Magyk users entirely— all of them except for one are female), but it also involves a princess who is his adopted sister, and a dragon he inadvertently hatches, a talking messenger rat, and a pretty cool plot involving time travel in one book. I don&#39;t want to spoil much in case you decide to read it.</p>

            <p>My &quot;childhood favorite&quot; would have to be the Temeraire series. I read a couple of them in second grade where they had the... kids who read well, I think? Anyway, they had a special reading thing and I read those and loved them a lot. After that would be the Harper Hall Pern stuff. The first three Young Wizards books, too. (I once attempted to take the Oath, in the hopes that it&#39;d work. Obviously, it didn&#39;t.)<br><br>Sadly, I found out my ebook set was of the version where the only (specifiedly) autistic character gets misrepresented and then &quot;cured&quot; at the end. Gah. Thankfully, Duane changed it. UNthankfully, the good version isn&#39;t on iBooks. (Sorry about dragging that in, but I just checked my copy of &quot;A Wizard Alone&quot; today.)</p>

            <p>So the &#39;new&#39; edition is really, <i>really</i> new: 2012, according to the comments. And as of 2013, was only available in e-book format.<br><br>I do agree that it sounds like the new version is better, though it also sounds like a major shift in Darryl&#39;s character. Given that he was a major character in the first part of the last book (which came out in 2010, so preceeds this), that might cause some problems. Unless, of course, the changes in how Darryl&#39;s autism is depicted mean that &#39;after thinking about it for a minute, Darryl decides to stay autistic&#39; does <i>not</i> render him virtually uncommunicative for the rest of the series. Which I&#39;m guessing is the case, because Diane Duane, she ain&#39;t stupid.<br><br>Also, I see that the New Millennium Editions exist for all the books, and have - gasp! - a consistent timeline. Yeeeeeeah, that&#39;s gonna break next book, betcha.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, relatively speaking. I don&#39;t have any major ones from my childhood in the pre-teen sense, but in terms of memorable literature from my past, there&#39;s quite a lot of popular book series, and then there&#39;s this one from completely out of left field.<br><br>Ladies and gents, I give you... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_Red"><i>Raptor Red</i></a>.<br><br>Basically, it&#39;s a 1995 American novel by paleontologist Robert T. Bakker, a third-person account of dinosaurs during the Cretaceous Period, told from the point of view of Raptor Red, a female <i>Utahraptor</i>. Though a bit dated for its time, it&#39;s one of the most accurate works of dinosaur media for its day, and it is amazing.<br><br>The first time I saw this book, when I was in my mid-teens, it was sold at a local Goodwill for around $3.00, I forget the price. But I still have it to this day, and I&#39;ve read it cover-to-cover way too many times to count. It&#39;s THAT good. Incidentally, most of Velociripper&#39;s mannerisms have been influenced extensively by it, which says a lot about how memorable Raptor Red&#39;s characterization is. Believable, relatable, and completely plausible in terms of animal behavior.</p>

            <p>Underdogs unexpectedly winning their matches seems to be a theme in this tournament, Scapegrace and me being prime examples.

            <p>I never really thought much of Sylveon until I decided to use one (only due to the sheer number of Dragons running around). I didn&#39;t really expect much from her until I started actually playing. After she oneshot a couple of &#39;mons with Hyper Voice, though, I decided to keep her around. :3<br><br>Fun fact: All the &#39;mons on my team were named after fallen Nuzlocke warriors except for Perseus and Eileen, who were named after a Vaporeon and Jolteon who both made it to the top and lived.

            <p>Use your STABmons or your pet trollfish to make a considerable dent in it. Vaporeon&#39;s the tough nut; Sylveon... not so much, especially against physical attackers. My primary source of physical damage 2HKOs both unboosted, though the problem (as ever) lies with the Protect spam. They have to break the chain to put on a status effect, so bait it the Toxic (Ix loves Toxic), switch to your Poison type to soak it up, switch <i>back</i> to your previous mon when it Protects to avoid the predicted reciprocal, and enjoy beating on it some more with Fake Out.<br><br>Also, Ix&#39;s Sylveon runs Pixilate-boosted Hyper Voice and her Vaporeon runs Scald, so you do run the risk of being hit quite hard or burned - always a problem on anything that&#39;s not a Guts abuser. Taunt works in that sense, but also means you have to deal with 30% burn chance spam, and nobody likes that. Also also, don&#39;t try and use status on her Umbreon or Espeon; they run Synchronize and Magic Bounce respectively, so it only works on the Umbreon, and even then only if you&#39;re trying to Toxic with a Poison-type, paralyse with an Electric-type, burn with a Fire-type, or use a Powder move with a Grass-type.<br><br>Ix, I&#39;ve been tutoring you a li&#39;l bit, it&#39;s only fair that the others know your classified information. =]</p>

            <p>Ooh, good idea. <br><br>Question: what&#39;s your opinion on Skarmory? Its Steel typing would suggest that it&#39;s good against Fairy types and also makes it immune to Toxic.

            <p>Skarmory&#39;s an excellent physical wall, and if Ix wasn&#39;t using her gimmick, I&#39;d recommend her put it in. Now, I don&#39;t tend to use it much, since I don&#39;t like playing in the higher tiers, but the following set is pretty much de rigeur. Or at least, so I am told.<br><br>---<br><br>Skarmory@Leftovers<br>Nature: Impish (+ Defence, - Special Attack)<br>Ability: Sturdy<br>EVs: 252 HP / 4 Defence / 252 Special Defence<br>Moveset:-<br><b>Roost</b><br>Roost is Skarmory&#39;s biggest niche - reliable recovery that slightly improves its defences in some ways by removing its Flying typing, which is kind of bad defensively. Steel does synergise well with it, though, which is nice for when it comes back just as your newly-switched-in opponent tries to unleash an Earth Power or something.<br><b>Taunt</b><br>People hate Taunt. People. <i>HATE</i>. Taunt. And it&#39;s brilliant on Skarmory. Skarm&#39;s role is hazard removal and kicking stuff in, whereas your lead is generally the one setting up traps for your opponent&#39;s Crippling Stealth Rock Weakness (take a drink!), so Taunt prevents people from setting it back up - and it also prevents the ubiquitous Defog from making an appearance, since nobody runs Rapid Spin any more.<br><b>Defog</b><br>Defog ties into the role as hazard removal, because it&#39;s your hazard removal. Duh. It allows you to get rid of entry hazards on your side of the field, which Skarmory&#39;s brilliant at since it&#39;s immune to almost all of them and only takes neutral damage from Stealth Rock. Which means your opponent has to stick all their hazards back up again, and leads tend to be a little bit on the fragile side.<br><b>Brave Bird</b><br>As you pointed out, Skarmory does have an okay Attack stat (though without EV investment it&#39;s not super great), so Brave Bird is there to aid your strengths. Skarmory tends to be on the receiving end of Taunt a lot, so I&#39;m reliably informed, so it seems obvious to run it so that you don&#39;t just sit there like a lemon if you get stuck with it. Brave Bird&#39;s a recoil move, which means you&#39;ll lose health if you use it. If only you had an extremely useful guaranteed recovery move...<br><br>---<br><br>Hopefully that&#39;s informative. =]</p>

            <p>I want everyone to have a fighting chance in this competition. Since I&#39;m basically crashing out in the first round because of Poor Life Decisions, I think it&#39;s important that everyone benefits from what knowledge I can impart from my travels in Showdown. They get a post. <i>You</i>, on the other hand, got one-to-one tuition. And since you&#39;re a hell of a lot better in a much shorter space of time than you were when you started, I think it&#39;s only fair that people get a little insight into your team, since yours is a gimmick that actually <i>works</i>.<br><br>Unlike mine, which is just &quot;hey, look at all these rubbish Pokemon, let&#39;s see what happens when I throw them at other teams!&quot; =]</p>

            <p>I recently acquired an Absol in Alpha Sapphire. Adamant nature, Pressure (Super Luck would&#39;ve been nice but whatevs). Her defences are really, really poor but I said &quot;eh, she&#39;ll be the squad&#39;s physical glass cannon&quot;. She proved herself to be more than that. Even without Super Luck she&#39;s absurdly lucky in the crits department, hits like Thor&#39;s mighty hammer if it was wielded by the Hulk (hypothetically speaking; only Thor can pick up Mjölnir, blah blah blah), and always finds a way to escape from certain-KO situations thanks to a Pokémon Amie-boosted dodge. Permanent squad material right there. <br><br>Then I found <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SfqnDKe.jpg">this</a> old exchange on 4chan. She&#39;s now the Mega squaddie. </p>

            <p>Des&#39;s Venusaur icon in Showdown seems to be light green with a red flower. The normal Venusaur icon is dark green with a red flower; the <i>shiny</i> icon is light green with a gold flower. Only it&#39;s worse than that, because the Showdown icon has off-colour highlights on the flower... and even worser, because the <i>in-game</i> Venusaur seems to be dark green.<br><br>Uhm. I think the Showdown icon might be using an older colour scheme: RSE Venusaur was lighter in colour, and had the gold flashes on its petals. DPPt kept the petals but darkened the skin, and by BW, the petals had changed too.<br><br>So I <b>think</b> I&#39;ve used the &#39;right&#39; icon. Maybe. Fingers crossed.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I play RU. A <i>lot</i>. And the team I submitted, minus the substitute who I only put in because Garbodor&#39;s adorable and you will never convince me otherwise, is the one I generally play with unless I&#39;m trying out something weird like a bulky Cryogonal/Gurdurr/Steelix-M core (spoilers: the above example did not go well). I know how it works, I know what it&#39;s supposed to do, and I know how to win with it. I <i>also</i> know its limitations, and going up against a team of much stronger &#39;mons is pretty much all of them. Doktor Grabbyhands can give people a good slap, and Doktor Fabulous is exceptionally hard to kill with a few boosts, but the rest of my team has a distinct disadvantage. It tends to move second. The average statlines aren&#39;t brilliant. The fast mons are fragile and the slow ones still aren&#39;t bulky enough to take that many hits. Focus Miss. Doktor Condom needs time to set up if he wants to properly cause havoc. Doktor Huggleston has problems tanking physical hits. There are weaknesses in the team that are largely self-inflicted, but I at least know how to use the team I&#39;ve got to maximum effect.<br><br>I&#39;m still going to lose to EAUO, but it&#39;ll be closer than it has any right to be. =]</p>

Some of those include:<br><br>- Mary Poppins (almost every single one of them)<br>- Fiddler on the Roof (see above)<br>- Rocky Horror Picture Show (Touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me~♪)<br><br>So, yeah... I may, or may not, be quoting a lot of songs in my missions :D</p>

            <p>Wizard rock. Basically, fan music about <i>Harry Potter</i>. (Yes, I&#39;m obsessed with the series.) Oliver Boyd and the Remembralls is my #1 favorite band, with &quot;Open at the Close&quot; being their best song in my opinion. It&#39;s very haunting and I dare you to listen to it and not cry.<br><br>Most of my other favorite songs come from <i>My Little Pony</i> (&quot;Winter Wrap-Up&quot;, &quot;This Day Aria&quot;) or <i>Phineas and Ferb</i> (&quot;Gitchee Gitchee Goo&quot;, &quot;There&#39;s a Platypus Controlling Me&quot;), or they&#39;re <i>Minecraft</i> remakes/ original songs (&quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;Take Back the Night&quot;), so you can really tell I&#39;m a nerd. XD<br><br>Other than that, though, I don&#39;t really listen to a whole lot of music outside of when I&#39;m driving, though I&#39;m a fan of Green Day and Three Doors Down (especially &quot;Kryptonite&quot;). Also Queen, The Black Eyed Peas, and REM.</p>

            <p>I like movie soundtracks too, in fact, their basically the only music I actively invest money in... But my music tastes are pretty varied. When it comes to music with vocals, I prefer faster songs or at least songs with a heavy beat. I can be pretty picky about what the vocalists sound like but I&#39;ve been working on not judging so much and trying to branch out. I listen to a lot of instrumental music, that&#39;s the only place that I can really stand slow songs. <br>But wow, band wise, I&#39;m really into Twenty One Pilots right now.<br>And that&#39;s it!</p>

            <p>The threat of merciless sporking is all that keeps badficcers from ignoring the Permission system. Well, that and just not knowing about us. But this may be changed by attempts to re-popularize the PPC on ff.net. <br><br>I’ve not been around so long, but I’m certain that there has been PPC badfic. The badfic games didn’t come out of the blue, parodying something that never existed.<br><br>The in-universe explanation for PPC badfic is obvious: Mary Sues and Gary Stus disguised as agents undercut PPC HQ (not in the big invasion emergency way), or assorted wraiths try to possess agents.

            <p>Jaycacia came into existence to answer the question of &#39;what if there was PPC badfic&#39;, not because any actually happened.<br><br>The DIO is a better angle to take, but even there... well. I never actually used them to kill a real story. There&#39;ve been a few which might have deserved it, but we didn&#39;t go that far.<br><br>And honestly, a lot of it is hindsight. We look back at some early stories and see how horrible they are - because they don&#39;t feel like what we think the PPC should, nowadays. But back in the day, our modern concept didn&#39;t exist; there&#39;s a lot of &#39;bad&#39; which is just &#39;different&#39;.<br><br>&#39;course, there&#39;s also a lot of bad which is <i>bad</i>. In fairness, we should probably be sporking half the PPC&#39;s early fics. Some of them throw spelling and grammar out the window; some turn the agents into ludicrous Sues; some directly attack authors. We&#39;ve got quote-talking Flowers, plagiarised agents, Lux&#39;s rapid descent from &#39;lustbunny in a steady relationship&#39; to &#39;sleeps with literally anything&#39; (oh wait, that one hung around)... yeah, it&#39;s been a rocky ride.<br><br>But the PPC canon is inclusive. Even the bad stories contributed things we still use today (such as, um, the Department of Floaters). Going back and attacking them would be... ungrateful.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Think about her TOS appearances.

            <p>...there have been portrayals of Luxury beyond &quot;walking sex joke&quot; in the modern PPC.

            <p>Luxury is special, but we shouldn’t believe all the rumors spread by people who probably think that three boyfriends in three years constitute promiscuity. Like Huinesoron suggested, she probably adapted to being serially monogamous, but her sex drive is still so overwhelming that she can’t keep any partner for an extended period of time.<br><br>BTW, she apparently is in a semi-stable relationship right now. Some (probably new) agents trying to find their RC met Lux (who had just a background cameo) and her current boyfriend in a mission or interlude that must have been published during the last six to nine months (obviously not by Voyd, Skarmory, Iximaz or TheShyIon, but who else might it have been?). I’m quite sure that I didn’t just dream this. Why, oh why didn’t I comment on Luxury’s cameo then? It would be so easy to find it now. <br><br>HG, ashamed</p>

            <p>I mean, it&#39;s squicky now, sure, but then again, Rose was 19 when she met the Doctor, who was, what, 900?

            <p>Unpopular opinion: I don&#39;t really like Rose. Something about her just rubs me the wrong way and it wasn&#39;t just the age difference. I can&#39;t really see her as anything else but &quot;the love interest who fawns over the Doctor&quot;. I&#39;m watching a TV show about this awesome time-travelling alien who goes on epic adventures 13 times per year, plus a Christmas special. IMO, Donna Noble was the perfect companion: snarky, capable, quick-witted, and just there for the thrill of the ride. Just get this romance mush out of my TV show, thank you very much. <br><br>...but that&#39;s besides the point. I tend to lean away from romance/relationship stuff in what I read and write so my opinions are rather half-baked in that department. The most I can say is &quot;be within the same age group&quot;. Of course we&#39;re dealing with interspecies romance in <i>Doctor Who</i>--- Rose is a young adult barely out of her teens and the Doctor is a man who&#39;s lived long enough (assisted by a time machine, yes, but you get the point) to see entire species rise and fall. In that case... maybe have both characters be full-fledged adults? Like I said, I&#39;m no romance expert or anything but this is what my gut tells me.<br><br> </p>

            <p>Of the 2005 Series, Donna was my least favorite.  She just was too abrasive in my opinion.  Very difficult to like.  I would say Amy or Rose were my favorites personally.  I will agree they probably should have kept her in Pete&#39;s World.  Though I did not think the times she came back were that bad.  They were basically for end of the universe type events.  The kinds of things the universe might bend its own rules to prevent.</p>

            <p>And if you want to wait until you&#39;ve finished the one with Lily, that&#39;s fine.

            <p>It&#39;s only a co-write towards the end, so we can get away with it.

            <p>I could see first person working—it would be interesting to see my characters from Agent!hS&#39;s perspective—but it could be tricky to write. I wouldn&#39;t feel confident attempting hS-voice myself, so that would probably end up being mostly you with me filling in what my guys are doing and saying.<br><br>How I usually tend to work these days is make a copy of the badfic (in Gdocs for co-writes), go through and make comments on the absurdities and potential plot points for future reference, find an intervention point, then write. For co-writing, there&#39;s also a discussion and planning step where we talk about what we want to get out of it for our characters, repeated as desired/necessary. It&#39;s helpful to write with both parties in the doc at the same time, sort of like an RP, so trading off can be done easily and naturally. But that could be difficult given time zone issues, especially when I get a new job. Which should hopefully be very soon. *side-eyes the universe, knocks on wood*<br><br>I&#39;unno, we&#39;ll figure it out. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think the idea of taking it in stages works quite well. So we GDoc a copy of the story, then each go through and... basically low-grade MST it: we each write in-character comments on every line we want our character to make a specific comment. That&#39;s your &#39;absurdities and plot points&#39; step, only slightly tweaked. Choosing an end point will probably happen pretty naturally in there.<br><br>Stage two is replies, and trimming out unnecessary lines. We&#39;re still basically in MST format at this point. If there&#39;s scenes with nothing really said, we designate them to be skipped.<br><br>Stage three thus starts with the dialogue basically complete. We then designate the actions, both in the gross sense - to move from the cave to the woods, the agents portal past the scene in the bog - and the small - hS scratches his head at that. Most of the latter probably came in during the first two stages, but this rounds them out.<br><br>Throughout, we can also run comments on the side, to help with making decisions on cutting, about things to remember, or any details that don&#39;t fall under the above (&#39;hS should be getting more and more worked up during this scene&#39; &#39;Derik&#39;s reaction IMMEDIATELY follows this event&#39;).<br><br>It&#39;s only in stage four that narrative gets written; at no point prior to this do both writers need to be on together. The narrative could be done entirely by one person, or by both jointly - or, which I tried and failed to suggest, by both <i>separately</i>, to produce two accounts of the same mission.<br><br>I know, it&#39;s a bit strange - but I think it&#39;ll drag the mission away from the MST-y style cowrites often slip into.

            <p>Who&#39;re you calling Chaotic? Ancalagon was a loyal servant of Morgoth; the northern dragons appear to have had a decent society going on; the dragons used to attack Gondolin were highly organised troop transports.<br><br>As for <i>evil</i>... well, according to their enemies, sure! Dragons are gigantic carnivores who sit at the top of the food chain; Elves, Men, and Dwarves are their prey. You might as well make noises about how &#39;evil&#39; the Free Peoples are - after all, <i>they</i> keep attacking the <i>dragons</i>, too. Ancalagon was only defending his home, for one.<br><br>What dragons &#39;always&#39; are is manipulative hoarding carnivores. They play with people as toys - Smaug with Bilbo, Glaurung with Turin&#39;s family. They adore gold - probably something to do with being made of metal themselves. And they eat people, because people are the best food. I bet deer see Elves much the same way - y&#39;know, the ones who steal all their land and food, then chase them down with bows and murder them.<br><br>Also... it&#39;s quite likely that dragons are incarnate Maiar. Which means that they are, one and all, demigods who decided &#39;that guy who&#39;s waging war against the One who created us is promising me a cool tank-body - I&#39;ll join him!&#39;. I don&#39;t think &#39;Always Chaotic Evil&#39; as a concept applies when they&#39;re <i>volunteers</i>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>On an unrelated note - it&#39;s interesting to see all the layers in Tolkien&#39;s mythology.  Tolkien&#39;s frequently seen as being the founder of the high fantasy genre, and I think an unfortunate side effect is that people tend to assume that, because LotR is the originator of several fantasy archetypes, that it works just like the pop culture version (or if you play tabletop RPGs, the D&amp;D version) of those archetypes.  But really, it&#39;s both more complex and more unique than you might think.</p>

            <p>He can <i>twist</i>, absolutely, but he can&#39;t create life; that lies solely in the power of the One. Remember it was Iluvatar who gave life to the dwarves - prior to that moment, they were Aule&#39;s puppets, and would freeze if he ignored them. Since all Melkor&#39;s creatures continued after he was cast out, we know that can&#39;t be how <i>they</i> worked.<br><br>So orcs were made by <i>torturing</i> elves (or animals, by some accounts) and twisting them through malevolent biology. Trolls... well, we don&#39;t have a lot of data there. The term seems to be rather broadly applied. And dragons... whatever they&#39;re mocking, it&#39;s not eagles. Glaurung the Golden, father of dragons, was <i>not</i> winged. (I really liked the theory that they were ultimately a mockery of the <i>dwarves</i>, actually).<br><br>But whereas orcs can conceivably be twisted from elves - what&#39;re you going to twist to create fire-breathing giant reptiles? And how do you then further twist it to add <i>wings</i> a few generations on? Add in the fact that the dragons in <i>The Fall of Gondolin</i> are very clearly living machines, and you&#39;re left with the conclusion that Morgoth (by that time) crafted metal bodies, and invited Maiar to live in them. Then he kept working on it in successive generations.<br><br>Are dragons therefore immortal? I certainly don&#39;t remember any mentions of them dying natural deaths... and we know <i>balrogs</i> are.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m learning so much today!<br><br>While on the subject of Arda dragons, I <i>loved</i> the depiction of Smaug in the Hobbit movies. Dragons are monsters; they are terrifying and frightful, yet awe-inspiring and glorious. To me, they captured that PERFECTLY with Smaug.<br><br>I really wish the Tolkien estate would allow Silmarillion movies, but alas.

            <p>... for being a tetrapod. ;) No front legs! Just wings!<br><br>I think Tolkien would have, if not necessarily approved, <i>appreciated</i> the change, as well. The dragons he drew were six-limbed, but also a long way from the Western norm; they were basically snakes with wings and feet. <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tolkienart25.jpg">This</a> lovely drawing sticks in my mind, for obvious reasons. So yes, I think Tolkien wouldn&#39;t have minded Smaug the Pterosaur.<br><br>Also he was cool. ;) Though I missed his jewelled waistcoat.<br><br>Ancalagon... I dunno, the idea of him being huge is very close to fanon. As far as I can tell, it comes solely from the fact that the towers of Thangorodrim (=volcano fortress mountain of DOOM, because Sauron was a plagiarist) crumbled beneath him when he fell. Which, okay, maybe - or maybe he was just a fairly ordinary-sized divine-powered dragon. Smaug smashed the whole of Lake-Town to bits when <i>he</i> fell, remember, and that was thousands of years later.<br><br>And... why would Morgoth have created a kaiju-sized dragon? What would he be <i>for</i>? Ancalagon was presumably in development from the moment Glaurung was proven a success, so his probable target was the hidden city of Gondolin - Morgoth knew it was in the mountains, but couldn&#39;t fly anything over to check because Eagles. A flying dragon would&#39;ve been perfect - unless it was so huge that it a) couldn&#39;t get off the ground, b) couldn&#39;t fit out the gate of Angband anyway, and c) couldn&#39;t land to <i>attack</i> Gondolin.<br><br>No, I don&#39;t think Ancalagon was particularly immense. That would make no sense as a weapon - and a weapon is what he was. What <i>I</i> think is that Tolkien had a liking for smashing mountains when things died - remember the balrog of Moria? Yeah. That wasn&#39;t very big, either.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...by the time the baronial council next meets, so what the heck? Might as well.<br><br><br><i>It was shortly after Lady Iximaz was appointed baroness that she learned of a powerful Marizu threat that none had yet dared to confront: a group dedicated to slandering the teachings of Jaikaiar and spreading their own messages of cruelty, malice, and wickedness. They called themselves the Cult of Six Roses.<br><br>Enraged by the cultists&#39; activity, Lady Iximaz set sail for Weab, intending to finally put a stop to the cultists&#39; activities on her own. She managed to infiltrate the cult by posing as an acolyte, and she bided her time, sabotaging the cult&#39;s plans and causing a small series of troublesome accidents to make their lives more difficult. And when the opportunity to kill the leaders presented itself, she struck.<br><br>One by one, she picked off each of the leaders with little difficulty, using a combination of stealth, guile, and dirty tactics in the form of long-ranged sniping. However, the sixth and eldest leader, having discovered the cause of the others&#39; deaths, took precautions against such an attack and forced Lady Iximaz to engage her in close combat. After a difficult fight, Lady Iximaz emerged the victor, bloody and beaten but alive. <br><br>Though devastated by the loss of her faithful bow, which had been broken in the struggle, she crafted a newer, more resilient one on her way back to Plort, where she returned triumphant. The tales of her deeds were already being spread throughout the land, and the Cult of Six Roses was soon nothing more than a distant memory.</i></p>

            <p>But I remember reading an article about Mary Sues throughout historical literature, and in the comments someone suggested that Ulysses was a Gary Stu.  Another commenter disagreed, and posted a summary of a decidedly NSFW Stufic version of the Odyssey.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d agree with the second commentator.  Ulysses is an exaggerated over-the-top hero figure, but in a world with lots of similar exaggerated over-the-top hero figures.  There&#39;s nothing unusually remarkable about him or his adventures compared to Jason, Hercules, etc.<br><br>And, unlike a typical Stu, he does have to face consequences for his actions.  That little business of upsetting Poseidon, for example.<br></p>

            <p>I do think that Sueishness is probably at least partially relative.  Also I do agree that he did face the consequences of his actions.  Also if you look through some of his other appearances he really starts to take on what almost looks like the prototypical Byronic Hero.  And I do not think those could really be seen as Sues.  Further if you look deeper, Odysseus is a deeply flawed individual.  In my opinion Homer creates a very good balance between the flaws and attributes.</p>

            <p>Simply put, I am going to reserve judgment on this. The trailers look really good, but then again, trailers are supposed to get you to want to watch the movie. And they do this by taking the absolute best shots from the movie and put them all together in a compilation to the best music from the movie. <br><br>I may just be prejudiced against this movie because I love Star Wars. I even liked the prequel trilogy (don&#39;t judge me). The reason I liked the prequel, I guess, was because its content was touched upon by the original trilogy. It was following the rules. The new trilogy they&#39;re working on now is exploring entirely unexplored territory. There are so many ways that this could be screwed up. <br><br>Based on what I have seen in the trailers so far, here are the things I hope to see here.<br><br>- I hope to see Luke Skywalker going insane due to his exposure to the Force, which few Jedi have ever had before him, I guess. I mean, think of it! He has disappeared at this point, right? And he probably has the charred remains of Dad&#39;s helmet with him, so what if he is wandering the Galaxy somewhere, muttering to the mask and exploring both the light side and dark side of the Force in order to accomplish some delusional mission of revitalization of the Jedi Order.<br><br>- One of the new characters is a Storm trooper. I would love to see the perspective that this would open up. I mean, look at everything from the Empire&#39;s point of view. They defeated the Separatists during the Clone War, and suddenly the Jedi try to overthrow the Supreme Chancellor because they feared that they were losing control of the Republic. (Keep in mind, this is from their perspective.) Everything is secure and prosperous after that, except for a disorganized band of terrorists and anarchists. Suddenly, this group of disorganized rebels begin striking a decisive blow. They begin losing, and the Emperor goes over to watch them die out. Suddenly, he&#39;s dead, and the Imperial pride is broken, there are riots in the streets, and the terrorists have taken over. Now it&#39;s a fight for survival, and this calls for brutality and determination. One day, one such individual who thinks this way is suddenly saved by the very people who did these things, and he gets confused, but never truly goes over to their side. I think this plot device would be epic! But it has to be handled correctly. Be careful, J. J. Abrams. Be careful.<br><br>- This big bad guy with the bastard-sword lightsaber. First of all, what&#39;s up with the design? It&#39;s a bold move, like the double-bladed lightsaber was back in its own day. I would have to see its practical uses before I judge whether or not I like this new lightsaber. But what about its wielder? Who is he? What does he want? Does it have something to do with the new characters, or what they find? Who does he work for? Personally, I hope that some of these questions are left unanswered. After all, they&#39;re going for a trilogy here. But they have to leave the questions unanswered in a skilled way. There are right ways to do it, and wrong ways to do it. To do it wrong would be to make it too obvious. <br><br>- These new guys who look like storm troopers in black armor. Was one using a lightsaber? Like they did in George Lucas&#39; original draft? These guys must be the certified bad***es here, right? I hope so, and I hope they don&#39;t rely on cheap tricks and stuff to kill people from the shadows or behind their backs, like cowards. <br><br>- The redesigns. I really do not care so much for the redesigns. I don&#39;t hate them, because they are still the iconic Star Wars stuff, but I don&#39;t really care how they redesign them that much.<br><br>- Also, I personally would like to see something here that makes the old rebellion (whoever they have become) morally blurry, like the Imperials. There&#39;s nothing more interesting than moral ambiguity in a story. It makes you ask questions and choose sides, strengthening your own sense of morality through the fires of adversity.  </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll agree that there were elements of the Prequels I liked, but I also hated parts. Jar Jar being one of those.  Revenge was actually pretty good, and might be second favorite Star Wars film, second only to Empire.<br><br>On to the lightsaber.  The biggest call of contention I think I have seen.  I like it, if it works the way I think it does.  I think that the sides are not blades.  I look at them as more of an exhaust vent.  If it works that way, I think it is brilliant.  The whole motif of awakening throughout the trailers lead me to believe that mystery Sith may be a reawakened ancient Sith.  And looking at the armor design, I get a real definite Darth Revan feel to him.  Which I think would be incredibly cool.  After all Revan is probably my three favorite characters from the EU.<br><br>Now the redesigns.  I like them.  They still keep the old feel of the originals, but look different, like things might after 30 years of conflict.<br><br>Other things I noticed.  The voice over of Luke.  &quot;You have that power too&quot;, this tacked on at the end of his speech leads me to believe that whoever he is speaking too is a member of the Skywalker bloodline.  Now I see really only one practical way to do that at this time, child of either Luke or Leia.  Only Leia had anything that looked like a relationship at the end of the original series, so more than likely I would guess it is her child.  And I think there is enough to support that Daisy Ridley&#39;s character is a Jaina Solo analogue.  Not sure where you got the Stormtroopers using lightsabers from.  The only lightsabers I saw were Luke&#39;s first/Anakin&#39;s and Kylo Ren (I think that&#39;s his name, the New Sith).  I look at the black armored Stormtrooper is probably akin to elite special forces.<br><br>And finally Han&#39;s last comment is great.  Heavily playing up the nostalgia factor.  Also interesting that he refers to Vader in the present tense.  I wonder if the ghost has a substantial role in the film. </p>

            <p>Oh, Jar Jar was insufferable! That was obviously supposed to be the point, but instead if the old awkward-loser-turned-leader trope, he just stays annoying. It&#39;s that voice. That&#39;s what it is, it&#39;s that voice. <br><br>If those are exhaust things, then he may consider a special protective glove, or something. He could easily burn himself with that thing. <br><br>I think the design of the new villain was meant to be more reminiscent of Darth Vader. It could be Revan, though. I can see that. We&#39;ll see who he is. Or, maybe we won&#39;t. We&#39;ll see.<br><br>I have no problem with the redesigning. It does get me into the whole touchy feely protective mood that hates anything different, but not everything that is different is a bad thing, so just let them innovate, right? Nothing to see here, except new storm troopers, new space ships, new droids, and other stuff like that. But other than that, yeah, nothing to see here.<br><br>I&#39;m going to reserve judgment for these new protagonists. I just can&#39;t get over the fact that they have a storm trooper, and I really don&#39;t want them to fail miserably with his character. He seems important, and he needs to be realistic, not just some random actor whose only qualification is that J. J. Abrams wanted to be Politically correct by including a black guy, like for a checklist or something. If he can portray his character, then he&#39;s golden. But hopefully they don&#39;t screw this movie up with political correctness, like they did with Noah, which seems to center on global warming. These characters need to be more than just some generic black guy and a strong feminist character in order for me to enjoy them. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there&#39;s nothing wrong with having those elements in these characters. I just want them to be realistic in that they&#39;re not just stereotyped symbols of a political message.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, was I rambling? Didn&#39;t mean to. It happens sometimes.<br><br>I saw the black armored storm trooper wielding a lightsaber in one of the trailers. I forget which one, and come to think of it, it may have been fake. But I&#39;ll keep an eye out for it.<br><br>Yeah, and I don&#39;t think Han will have to worry much about crashing the ship, based on his most recent crash, am I right?... Too soon? Sorry. Point being, he gets to work with his baby again, that&#39;s great. Hopefully it got outfitted with new equipment that he has no idea what to do with. Imagine the comedy gold that would throw out.<br><br>That&#39;s the thing about Vader, though. Was the voice real? Or was it all in Luke&#39;s head. He&#39;s been talking to ghosts before, and talking to too many ghosts can be unhealthy.<br><br>What?... Oh hi, Grandma... I&#39;m talking to people on the Internet... Star Wars... Number seven... Yeah, okay, I&#39;ll be right there...<br><br>Sorry, just talking to a ghost. Lol</p>

            <p>Because I&#39;m a huge nerd, I have to wonder, will the movie follow established &#39;verse-canon or will it replace the current canon or what? I&#39;m pretty sure within the extended universe, Luke Skywalker dies before rebuilding the Jedi Order and actually teaches his great-great grandson (or something) as a ghost.</p>

            <p>...that the EU will be relegated to this weird AU-but-not-quite status. The new movies will now dictate official canon but will integrate some EU aspects. Here&#39;s the official statement by Lucasfilm: <br><br><i>&quot;In order to give maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience, Star Wars Episodes VII-IX will not tell the same story told in the post-Return of the Jedi Expanded Universe. While the universe that readers knew is changing, it is not being discarded. Creators of new Star Wars entertainment have full access to the rich content of the Expanded Universe. For example, elements of the EU are included in Star Wars Rebels. The Inquisitor, the Imperial Security Bureau, and Sienar Fleet Systems are story elements in the new animated series, and all these ideas find their origins in role-playing game material published in the 1980s.<br><br>Demand for past tales of the Expanded Universe will keep them in print, presented under the new “Legends” banner.</i>&quot;<br><br>Very interesting. I&#39;m excited to see where this is going.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re talking about their canon names, I&#39;d look at the names used in foreign versions of the book.  Maybe try Italian?  There&#39;s always the standard method of sticking an -us on the end of everything, but it tends to look a little clumsy.  Some names, such as Hermione and Lupin, are of Greco-Roman origin, so there should already be methods of handling those structures.  Another option would be to translate the names into others with similar meanings, but that might make it hard to tell who&#39;s who - an issue that My Immortal does not need exacerbated.  There&#39;s probably research as to how Romans handled the issue of non-Latin based names; I&#39;d suggest trying to find some of that.  You also might want to take a look at ecclesiastic Latin, assuming you&#39;re working with a more classical source.<br><br>This, however, is My Immortal, which among other things, renames pretty much everything.  For characters whose names have actual meanings, I&#39;d translate it directly - i.e., B&#39;loody Mary becomes Maria S&#39;anguinea, Willow becomes Salix.  Ebony should probably just go to Ebonia, however, in order to maintain the many, many variations used.<br><br>That said, if this is your first project, you might want to start with something shorter and better spelled.  Figure out how you want to translate names, before you have to worry about things like malapropisms that are meaningless in other languages.</p>

            <p>I hadn&#39;t thought of italian.<br>for the malapropisms since we&#39;re writing primarily for an English speaking audience we&#39;ll likely do something like use a word that means sort of this word but doesn&#39;t actually mean this word (though I suppose we&#39;ll have to mourn masticating because I cannot think how we&#39;d pull that off)<br>for her name we right now haveHebena Tenebrae Dementia Corva Via as the translated name.<br>on an unrelated note I think I may have accidentally memorized part of the first chapter.</p>

            <p>My main thought was... why did she need killing? I think this is a case where we could benefit from seeing <i>more</i> of the badfic. The story as we readers get to see it is:<br><br>____ sneaks into the Mountain, just like Bilbo. She flatters Smaug, just like Bilbo. Smaug says he wants to keep her, which is admittedly weird. Smaug threatens her about dwarves, just like Bilbo. You tell us - but don&#39;t show - that ____ tells Smaug some stuff about the dwarves. Then Smaug decides to keep her.<br><br>I mean, okay, it&#39;s a bit on the weird side, but... I guess what I want to know is the details around the final quote. Did Smaug spend some time being convinced to like her? Did he flip straight from &#39;you stink of dwarf&#39; to &#39;snuggletime&#39;? Is there anything <i>after</i>?<br><br>I feel like I missed out on the story here.<br><br>hS<br><br>(Also, she seems to not have the Ring? Is that right? That would explain why Smaug didn&#39;t try to set her on fire - he knew she couldn&#39;t escape. Er... Bilbo <i>did</i> wear the Ring for the interview in the film, right? Please tell me he did.)</p>

            <p>However, <i>something</i> makes him take it off. It&#39;s not of his own volition; we get weird Sauron images, and then Bilbo&#39;s just as surprised as we are that the Ring isn&#39;t on his finger.<br><br>In the film, Smaug&#39;s sadistic curiosity is what keeps Bilbo alive. He wants to know where Bilbo came from, so he can burn it to the ground. And when Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, Smaug is tempted to let him take it just to see Thorin suffer. And Smaug&#39;s patience <i>does</i> run out; when he figures that playing with Bilbo is getting boring, he <i>immediately</i> goes for the kill.<br><br>Yeah, Smaug&#39;s an ass in the movie.<br><br>As for the fic? <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/3399602">It&#39;s here.</a> You don&#39;t really miss too much in the mission.</p>

            <p>Y&#39;know, I didn&#39;t like <i>The Desolation of Smaug</i> much when I first saw it. The fact that I can ask <i>one question</i> about it and have you explain how badly they mucked up... is a big part of why.<br><br>(Also the pair of theme park rides in it. Also <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDisY6ny1PXNIN6SpfY8NE5PA16E7BhWKeCPQHRIOho/pub">evil!Thranduil sneaking in</a>.

Smaug says &#39;treasure&#39; a few times, is all. I think you could&#39;ve done with quoting some of that, though; the line <i>&quot;You are worth as much as all this gold in these halls,&quot; Smaug flattered you.</i> is justification for PPC action all by itself, I think.

            <p>For the subjective interpretation of &quot;definitely better,&quot; mind you.<br><br>I would personally argue that the film versions of <i>Jaws</i>, <i>Jurassic Park</i>, <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i>, and several of the James Bond films are better than their literary precursors. Similarly, I would say that while <i>Apocalypse Now</i> is not necessarily better than <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, it is more meaningful given its updated setting. Other adaptations, such as <i>The Godfather</i>, I can&#39;t properly judge due to not having read the book.<br><br>Also, a fun fact I acquired while doing some searches on this topic. Did you know <i>Die Hard</i> is based on a book? It&#39;s called <i>Nothing Lasts Forever</i>, by Roderick Thorp. I seriously would have never guessed.</p>

            <p>I <i>hated</i> the book version of it, but absolutely adore the movies. Very entertaining films, with some of the best 3d animation I have seen to date, entertaining characters, and a plot that shares almost nothing with the books other then some names. And in this case, that is a blessing.</p>

            <p>If it doesn&#39;t have the same plot, the characters are changed if they&#39;re there at all, and it obviously has a different setting... it&#39;s a different canon. Whatever you think of the books, the movie can hardly be compared that way any more than you can compare any other pair of different canons. <br><br>Especially since the book&#39;s whole message got flipped. The book was about becoming a hero the hard way. In the movie, Hiccup was the only one with a dragon, and it was a Special Uncanon Dragon.<br><br>Basically, it&#39;s movie-form fanfic. With the parameters you&#39;re applying to the question, I could just as easily say &quot;Frozen&quot; and be in the same ballpark of adaptation-vs-separate canon.</p>

            <p><i>Star Wars</i> is a good bet. I&#39;m guessing there are <i>Star Trek</i> novelisations, too.<br><br>And... I mean, there&#39;s &#39;not as good as&#39;, and then there&#39;s &#39;gratuitously worse than&#39;.

I really doubt it. They chopped out moments of character development, not because they didn&#39;t have space left in the movie, but because they wanted to fill that space with gigantic ridiculous CG action sequences.<br><br>And, y&#39;know what? That&#39;s been the case for <i>every movie other than Fellowship</i>. The closest FotR has is the escape through Moria - but stack it up against Helm&#39;s Deep, the Mumakil, Goblin Town, barrels and gold statues, and about 2/3 of B5A... y&#39;know?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Is that they took three movies to do it.  Jackson did a fine job of condensing <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.  Was it perfect, no, but a very good adaptation in my opinion.  But look at it this way:<br><br><i>The Hobbit</i>:  320 Pages, Theatrical Runtime:  7 hours 54 Minutes<br><br><i>Lord of the Rings Saga</i> 1216 Pages, Theatrical Runtime: 9 hours 18 minutes.<br><br><i>The Hobbit</i> at nearly a quarter of the size of the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> is only an hour and 24 minutes shorter.  The bottom line, is that New Line and Jackson were just milking it at that point.  Three films for <i>The Hobbit</i> were unnecessary to tell the whole story.<br><br>And more directly to your point, the need to fill that excess space with something. </p>

            <p>Look at it this way, if someone was going about chasing after small cats with an axe, that signals a problem or two.  And there is clearly a problem if that same person is chasing after a human with that same axe.  Now instead of a small cat, that person is now chasing something that looks like a small version of a person.  That seems to be a big red flag from society at a whole.  Hence, why so many people are jumping on you for it.<br><br>Now further compounding that is your compounding the issue with your off hand comments about it.  Even the apology can come across as a bit disingenuous.  Your attitude just compounded the issue.<br><br>Now all that being said, I understand where everyone else is coming from, but I disagree with the approach.  This might well be your particular brand of humor, and I both see the merits of and occasionally enjoy  black comedy or gallows humor, but it is not for everyone.  And the fact remains that a community like this is subject to the standards of behavior the community chooses for that.  The community seems to have spoken about that particular behavior.<br><br>And now you know.  And so now, just a few closing words before we move on.<br><br>Icky-Icky-Icky-Icky-Kapang-ZooBoing.</p>

            <p>As I don&#39;t know anything about any of the continuities involved, I&#39;ve got no way of judging what - if anything - they&#39;re doing wrong.  From my point of view, it looks as if you&#39;re being pessimistic and assuming it&#39;s all going to go wrong without giving any reasons why it makes you feel that way.<br><br>OK, that&#39;s not quite fair.  You menyioned something about hybrids or something, but this is a crossover.  In story terms, is there any good reason why (for example) scientists from one universe couldn&#39;t use advanced techniques from all the different universes to create new, previously-unknown hybrids of creatures from another universe?  (OTOH if the hybrids just somehow magically exist, with no explanation, then yes, it is bad.  But until the story&#39;s written, there&#39;s no reason except pure pessimism for assuming that.)</p>

            <p>All I can say is, whoever made him is <i>really</i> bad at cloning.<br><br>Or maybe really good... I mean, cloning consists of taking adult DNA (Mew&#39;s) and putting it into a viable egg. (In mammals that&#39;s an egg cell, which also needs to be implanted into a surrogate, but Pokemon are egg-layers.) Since we know Mew can&#39;t breed, it can&#39;t have eggs (that whole &#39;laid an egg&#39; thing is clearly a misreading). So <b>where did they get the egg</b>?<br><br>The answer is obvious: Mewtwo is an inadvertent hybrid between Mew and another, yet-unidentified Pokemon. Comparison time!<br><br>Compared to Mew, Mewtwo has:<br><br>-A more pronounced tail/stomach.<br>-Longer and more round-ended fingers and toes.<br>-Shoulder armour.<br>-Squarer ears.<br>-More height and longer limbs.<br>-A more pronounced neck.<br>-A blockier head.<br><br>What Pokemon could be the source of those? Let&#39;s see, if we limit ourselves to Kanto... well, Clefable looks promising. It&#39;s got the ears, the tail, the fingers. But no neck. Let&#39;s keep looking... the Abra lineage would give the shoulder stuff, ears, height, neck... most of it, actually.<br><br>So there we have it. Mew&#39;s DNA was implanted into an Abra egg. Clearly, a ruthless scientist stole an Abra&#39;s egg (remember, no-one knew Pokemon <i>laid</i> eggs at this point), mucked about with it, and claimed it was Mew&#39;s; no-one picked up on the similarities to Kadabra/Alakazam because, well, Abra are annoying as heck to get hold of. They&#39;d never seen one.<br><br>^_^<br><br>hS</p>

Spelling/Grammar was not perfect, but not terrible either, but there are major breaches of canon.  The OC is a made up entity that has more power than the Almighty One.  Who in universe is God.  So very blatant Sue.  But the story has been discontinued.  So I am not certain if it is mission material then.  The breaches of canon are very bad though.</p>

            <p>Discontinued fics are perfectly acceptable as mission targets.  This one seems a bit short to me, but since I&#39;ve never actually written a mission, I don&#39;t have room to comment.<br><br>As far as quality goes, I&#39;m not familiar with the canon, but a recurring OC who shares traits with the writer is never a good sign, and the bit I read seems to have a drastically different tone than the actual series.</p>

            <p>Even in that short bit Hild is very OC.  Tone is drastically different.  Angels do not work that way in canon, the entire Hidden One is wrong, they do not exist in the canon.  The three sisters being on Earth like that is just wrong.  There are a few other breaches too.  I also think it makes light of both Survivor&#39;s Guilt and Depression.  And the OC is definitely a Stu.  Even at a minimum he would have more power than the three Goddesses and by the words probably more than the canon&#39;s equivalent of God.</p>

            <p>And, uh... if the theory is that &#39;Smaug is sexy because Cumberbatch&#39;, why the bizarre and explicit statement that his voice had changed? Surely that&#39;s the <i>last</i> thing you&#39;d want?<br><br>I still disagree about Ancalagon&#39;s size, but you probably knew that. The largest known creature in the &#39;final&#39; version of Middle-earth is... probably Smaug, actually. He and Glaurung were about the same size as each other. Ungoliant might have outscaled them, but only after she gorged herself on the Trees. Morgoth was tall, but not ludicrously oversized. Durin&#39;s Bane was about ten feet tall. Ents are no taller than trees, Carcharoth was huge but nowhere near that scale... the Eagles are big enough to carry people on their backs, I suppose.<br><br>What I&#39;m getting at is, you&#39;re claiming that Ancalagon is some <i>fifty times</i> the length of Morgoth&#39;s next-largest creature (Smaug); since dragons are three-dimensional, that&#39;s - sweet burning stars - over 100,000 times the volume (and therefore mass). I, uh... really can&#39;t accept that as feasible.<br><br>&quot;But it&#39;s magic--&quot; No, it&#39;s not. Flying creatures in Middle-earth fly using wings, not fairy dust. They have mass appropriate to their bodies. A mile-long dragon would way hundreds or thousands of tonnes. He&#39;d need wings the size of Doriath to get airborne - and muscles woven with <i>mithril</i>. (Which latter is actually plausible: I can see him as a <i>mithril</i>-cored nuclear-powered flier. But still not a mile long.)<br><br>hS, applying logic to fantasy universes since 2001</p>

            <p>We all see fantasy worlds in our own way. I like the idea of Ancalagon being made of mithril, though.<br><br>I felt slightly sacrilegious using a movie detail (the glowing chest preceding fiery doom), but that was one aspect of Film!Smaug&#39;s appearance that I liked. And I made note of one more thing regarding Ancalagon&#39;s breath; Gandalf said that his breath couldn&#39;t melt the One Ring. Gandalf chose this particular dragon to measure the One Ring&#39;s indestructibility, so I imagine that literally <i>nothing else</i> could withstand the big guy&#39;s breath.<br><br>Thus the Stu disintegration.</p>

            <p>... other than size. ;) And it&#39;s very clear that Ancalagon was Morgoth&#39;s superweapon - hottest breath, and flight. In fact, here&#39;s a worrying thought: Ancalagon was only sent out <i>at the last minute</i>. Er... what was Morgoth <i>waiting</i> for, exactly?<br><br>And then I remember that Glaurung&#39;s first outing was when he was half-grown, after which Morgoth held him in for another two hundred years. So... was Ancalagon held back because he wasn&#39;t ready? Did Morgoth only eventually send him out in desperation?<br><br>And if <i>that&#39;s</i> the case - what in Arda was he <b>for</b>??? There were no enemies left in Middle-earth who could possibly stand up to... heck, even to another Glaurung. Gondolin fell to crawling dragons; Doriath would have too, if it hadn&#39;t gone another way. What do you build a mountain-destroying flying dragon for?<br><br>Which really is another way of asking &#39;who was Morgoth&#39;s real enemy?&#39;. And the answer to that is both terrifying, and a possible justification for Ancalagon being gigantic:<br><br>Ancalagon was made to tear down the Mountains of Valinor. He was intended to cross the Sea and rend the Pelori to rubble to let Morgoth&#39;s armies cross. And his ultimate goal was to bring down Taniquetil itself.<br><br><i>A Vala&#39;s reach should exceed his grasp; else what&#39;s a dragon for?</i><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>In the beginning, Eru Iluvatar (&#39;the One&#39;) created the Ainur (&#39;angels&#39; or &#39;gods&#39;). The Ainur sang Arda into existence in a massive choir; Melkor is the one who chucked out the sheet music and decided to sing heavy metal instead, and got a bunch of others to join in with him.<br><br>The Ainur went down to Arda and became the Valar (&#39;gods&#39;) and Maiar (&#39;angels&#39; - Gandalf is one of these). Melkor was a Vala, as was Elbereth (mentioned in various Elven songs). They set about building mountains and planting trees on the mainland (Middle-earth), but Melkor&#39;s mucking about with the song - or Melkor&#39;s acts of vandalism, the distinction is pretty murky - kept making things go wrong.<br><br>After a few disasters, the Ainur picked up and moved to a western continent (Aman, or colloquially &#39;Valinor&#39;). They left Melkor behind to be evil by himself. They made the famous Two Trees to give light to Valinor - there was no sun or moon in those days. The highest of the Valar lived on Mount Taniquetil, the tallest mountain in the world.<br><br>Some time later, the Elves were born - in Middle-earth, where Melkor was busy being evil. The Valar asked them to come to Valinor; some said no and stayed behind, some said yes and went to Valinor, some said yes but gave up on the walk over. At the same time, the Valar waged war on Melkor and dragged him back to Valinor in chains.<br><br>Fast-forward. Melkor serves his sentence and is set free in Valinor. He meets up with Ungoliant the giant spider in the mountains, and together they murder the Two Trees. They then run away, and Melkor returns to his old fortress.<br><br>Along the way, Melkor killed a king of the Elves, and stole the Silmarils (jewels which contain the now-last light of the Trees). The prince who made the Silmarils (Feanor) decided that Wasn&#39;t On, and dragged his tribe into a chase after Melkor - who Feanor renamed Morgoth. They reached Middle-earth some time after him, and set up shop there for a few hundred years waging a fairly unsuccessful war.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Valar made the sun and moon to light the world, which Melkor didn&#39;t like too much. Melkor didn&#39;t like many things, but his main dislikes were:<br><br>1/ The Valar, who had taken him prisoner.<br>2/ Elves, who were the <i>reason</i> the Valar took him prisoner.<br><br>Baaaasically everything he did was to get back at one of those two.<br><br>So yes - Valinor is kind of &#39;Heaven on Earth&#39;; it&#39;s where the gods live, and Melkor wants to get them.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Between this and your last mission, all I have to say is: <i>Why</i> would a Tolkienverse Sue want to bang a freaking <i>dragon?!</i><br><br>I mean, I GET that The Frumious Banderdict Cumbersnatch(TM) is popular enough that everyone wants a piece of him (and I&#39;ve seen enough posts on Tumblr to verify it), but why not just bang Sherlock or something?<br><br>...Okay, that was a dumb question. ^^;<br><br>And I will be upfront when I say that I honestly didn&#39;t like Smaug&#39;s characterization in the actual movie. I liked how he looked, sure, but any adaptation of the Hobbit that botches his famous boast won&#39;t do me any favors. But no matter how badly the adaptations messed up his personality, one thing is clear. SMAUG. IS. NOT. BANG-ABLE! His armor is like tenfold shields, his teeth are swords, his claws are spears, the shock of his tail is a thunderbolt, his wings are a hurricane, and his breath death! WHY, for the love of Eru, would he NEED a humanoid form in light of all of that?! He is the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities, and he friggin&#39; reduced Dale to cinders! There is NO way he&#39;ll ever want or need a human consort. Period.<br><br>So... yeah. Nice job in both cases. The first mission was handled fairly well, what with the agents being quite efficient in the cleanup job, but this was even better. Especially the ending with Ancalagon and Gabby taking his picture. XD<br><br>Lastly, a proofreading thing:<br><br><i>Gabby looked at her partner, pity on her face.</i><br>IDK, this just sounds a tad... awkward to me. I&#39;d use &quot;an expression of pity on her face&quot; instead.</p>

            <p>I know it&#39;s not technically relevant to anything Tolkienverse, but in D&amp;D, dragons do have shapeshifting abilities, and there&#39;s a half-dragon template that you can apply to literally <i>anything</i>.  It&#39;s something of a running gag among players that dragons are bigger horndogs than the Greek gods - Zeus may have turned into a swan, but he never romanced a Gelatinous Cube.<br><br>Now, D&amp;D copies a lot of surface details from Tolkien, ranging from little things, like elves trancing instead of sleeping, to basically the entirety of the halfling race, which were actually called hobbits until the Tolkien estate threatened to sue.  Now, these similarities don&#39;t run particularly deep, and certainly don&#39;t apply to dragons, but badfic writers are unlikely to realize the difference.</p>

            <p>I reread the scene, and it doesn’t look purple to me, considering the nature of what’s described there.<br><br>But since you drew my attention to it, I realized that &quot;as black as oil&quot; doesn’t really work. There are all sorts of oil, like olive oil, rapeseed oil or soy bean oil, and even the oil I put into the engine of my car, although based on petroleum, isn’t black. Also, oil makes me think of the multicolor refraction effect of a thin oil film spread on water. I’m aware that you thought of crude oil in its native state, but you may want to find something more definitely black. Coal? Pitch? Tar? A starless night? I’m not a <i>Silmarillion</i> expert – was the long night still literally starless when the Valar and Maiar arrived on Arda? &quot;A starless night&quot; may be a bit too purple if it isn’t a cheeky reference.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I have never actually been in a Pokemon tournament before. However, I did build my team for just that and I&#39;m so glad it did so well. I lost quite a few battles outside of the tournament. The battles I won were thankfully the ones that counted.</p>

            <p>I threw in the last match. I threw hard. This is because A) I wanted Best Trophy, and B) I... really didn&#39;t feel comfortable winning this tourney. I&#39;m the only one who played competitive on anything close to a regular basis, so it felt like I was cheating a bit.</p>

            <p>Because overconfidence is what gets you killed. I&#39;ve been battling a hell of a lot with various people, and each time I expect to lose. Why? Because if I <i>expect</i> to lose, I turn my brain (what little of it there is) to thinking about situations in which I <i>don&#39;t</i> lose. I start really thinking about counters, about damage effectiveness, about what I can and cannot sacrifice, who I can and cannot let take some damage so that they can set up. It&#39;s all about tradeoffs and resource management, and if I think I&#39;m coming crashing down, I might learn how to fly. =]</p>

In any event, she thought about the other thing her partner had said involving her computer setup and a clog dance when the scent of fear filled her lungs - and Time Lord fear at that.<br><br>&quot;Dives,&quot; she said, her tone shooting for gracious and ending up in the familiar waters of condescension.</p>

            <p>The Notary turned a sneer on Chakkik. &quot;Though one does rather wonder what precisely you&#39;re doing here. Is hanging around your partner just a way you like to spend the time, or is there a more sordid element to proceedings?&quot; She gave him a more detailed inspection. &quot;I dread to think.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>((We basically don&#39;t interact outside of Showdown and I&#39;m not exactly eager to work with your agents. Either set. You&#39;re also on the record as genuinely despising the Notary, so why you want to <i>write</i> for her totally eludes me.

            <p>Bria, assumed the one called Chakkik meant the Jedi.  She scoffed at the thought.  &quot;Peacekeepers?  If you mean warriors using their abilities to wage a galaxy wide war, then yes.&quot;  When she had left her home the Jedi were at the forefront of the Republic&#39;s War Effort.  Then again the Sith were the drivers behind the Imperial War Effort.  Which was shame when she thought about it.  The Empire could be great, but for the arbitrary decisions of the Sith. </p>

            <p>Meryem walked along the tree-lined path, gazing at the trees. &quot;This is a whole lot better than winter. Ugh, I can&#39;t stand snow. Or the cold,&quot; she said to the Lucario next to her.<br><br>&quot;Really?&quot; said Owen. The Aura Pokémon stared at his human colleague, rubbing his chin. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m part Steel type or something. I know Buck hates it, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s because I&#39;m a pure Grass type,&quot; mumbled the Skiddo as he trailed behind the pair. &quot;Give me a nice patch of sunshine any day and I&#39;ll be happy. But snow? Not in a million years.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I feel you, bro,&quot; said Meryem, nodding. The DIA trio continued walking until they left the shady path and stepped out into the sunny plain that was most of the PPC Courtyard. To their left bubbled a wide and shallow river that cut the Courtyard in half. To their right stretched the plain, dotted by dense copses of trees like the one the DIA officers had just left. <br><br>Buck smiled and shook himself awake when he the sunlight reached him. &quot;Ooh, much better,&quot; he said. &quot;I wonder if these guys are enjoying the sun too.&quot;<br><br>Owen&#39;s ears perked up. &quot;Which peop-- oh, I feel them. Three humans, two o&#39;clock.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thanks, buddy,&quot; said Meryem, turning her attention to the area in question. &quot;Yep. Hey, let&#39;s go and say &#39;hi&#39;. A little positive police interaction is always a good thing here, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lead the way, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Owen, saluting. Buck simply nodded in agreement.<br><br>&quot;Well then, let&#39;s go,&quot; said Meryem. <br><br>When the trio drew near the assembled agents, Owen did a double take. &quot;Whaddya know, it&#39;s Zebby-zeb! The man sitting on the ground there. It&#39;s the Rookie!&quot; <br><br>&quot;Really?&quot; said Buck, squinting. &quot;So that&#39;s his human disguise. Meh, not bad.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excuse me, I&#39;ll just go ahead and talk to him,&quot; said Owen, double-timing it to the disguised Luxray. Once he drew close to Zeb, Owen waved. &quot;Ahoy there, Rookie! How&#39;s life?&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, Meryem and Buck approached the unknown woman and Rina. &quot;Good afternoon, agents! Out enjoying the weather?&quot; asked the Turkish woman.</p>

            <p>&quot;Corridors get a bit hectic every now and then but eh, we manage,&quot; said Owen as he kneeled beside Zeb. &quot;Congratulations again on that spectacular Legendary kill, Rookie. I knew you had it in you! You&#39;re gonna make a fine Assassin, I can feel it. Speaking of which, there&#39;s something the gang and I wanted to give you. We figured that you&#39;d have seen some pretty nasty things so...&quot;<br><br>Owen reached down and rummaged in one of the pouches on his tactical vest.

            <p>Zeb said, totally oblivious to the double meaning. &quot;Rina and I have bunk beds, see, which are narrow enough to begin with, and we probably wouldn&#39;t fit on one together very well.&quot; He twirled the feather between his fingers, looking thoughtful. &quot;Though Rina only needs... two hours of sleep now, I think, so she could go first, perhaps, and then let me have it.&quot;<br><br>He looked at Owen with a solemn expression. &quot;You think it&#39;s a bad thing I care about my partner, but I think you&#39;re wrong.

            <p>&quot;He&#39;s just trying to be edgy,&quot; said Buck, smiling. &quot;As much as he would like it, he&#39;s not the super-independent tough guy he thinks he is.

A Zorua appeared out of the tall grass, clothed in a tiny vest bearing the DoI&#39;s sage frond flash patch. He gazed at Buck and Owen&#39;s tussle, then at Zeb. He then shook himself like a wet dog, dislodging a notebook and pencil from his back. With great care, he opened the notebook to a blank page, took the pencil in his mouth and wrote: &quot;Why are they fighting again? I thought they were friends.&quot;</p>

            <p>Zeb sighed and sat back. &quot;I never really thought about doing anything else, really. I mean, the POC gave me a second chance; I figured I must&#39;ve been blown through that plothole for a reason. I intend to make the best of that chance.&quot; <br><br>He looked over at Rina, biting his lip. &quot;And... it&#39;s kind of my fault Rina&#39;s stuck the way she is.

            <p>&quot;Bleeding heart. You&#39;re such a bleeding heart. You fell though that plothole because of a freak accident, not because of fate or a &#39;reason&#39; or even being given a second chance. You just lucked out, Rookie! No need to rationalize it.&quot; <br><br>The Lucario reached into a large pouch hanging off his belt and pulled out a canteen. After taking a swig of water he said: &quot;And seriously-- you don&#39;t owe anything to her. If anything, she owes <i>you</i>. You saved her bacon, end of story. If she&#39;s got life problems, that&#39;s her business, not yours.&quot;<br><br>A rustling noise in the tall grass made Owen swivel around. He relaxed when a Fletchinder hopped out of the grass, looking around nervously. &quot;Ah, welcome back,&quot; said Owen. &quot;There&#39;s no way Bug types are going to mess with you now, eh? That&#39;s good. If you can cow someone into submission then it&#39;s a hundred times better than fighting. The wasps are gone now so you can drop your disguise if you want.&quot;<br><br>The bird cocked its head to the side and remained silent. It shook itself, producing a familiar pencil and notepad seemingly out of nowhere. It grabbed the pencil in its beak and wrote a note. &quot;I apologize for my brusque departure.

            <p>&quot;...I could take a peek into your mind to confirm your story,&quot; Rina offered, though her mouth was dry. Not only did it look like this Cipher-7 was, in fact, a spy, she was still unsure about her telepathic abilities. Sure, the Guardsman had been good on his word and shown her some things, but she had yet to try looking into the mind of a non-Time Lord. <br><br>Her hand drifted toward her pocket, feeling for a knife just in case.</p>

Well you will get nothing from me.&quot;  She lowered her hand to her own blaster as Rina reached for something.  &quot;This is a violation of the Treaty of Coruscant.&quot;  She said, ignoring the fact that by going after a target on Coruscant, she herself was violating the terms of the treaty.<br><br>Cipher-7 had found herself in a now win situation.

            <p>She thought that this was either the strangest interrogation she had ever taken part in, or perhaps this really was not a Republic Base.

At the moment there was no harm in playing along.<br><br>&quot;Occasionally.&quot;  She said, sighing.  This had to be handled extremely carefully.  &quot;It can be one of the perks of the job.

            <p>Darkotas blinked as his eyes adjusted to the bright sunlight of the courtyard. He scanned his surroundings for a quiet place to sit, then selected a nice stone bench. As he took out a clipboard and some paper, the Mage of Stormwind noticed a familiar-looking girl and a boy who seemed to be about the same age sitting nearby. They appeared to be having a picnic, and he briefly wondered if they were a couple. He looked back down, paused for a moment, and started to write.</p>

            <p>Strangely enough, even with her dislike of most non-humans, the hobgoblin actually put her a bit more at ease.  Cipher-7 had infiltrated at least a half-dozen SIS outposts, and that personality was just so fundamentally different from what she had experienced.  It was...refreshing she thought.<br><br>&quot;I am for the moment willing to believe that this is not an SIS outpost or even a Republic Facility.  So I am at least willing to talk a bit.&quot;  She did not necessarily trust them.  Or even believe them, but this was her best chance to figure out what was going on.</p>

            <p>Cipher-7 laughed a bit.  She certainly thought they were some kind of school club, after all they were not very good at their job.  &quot;SIS stands for Strategic Information Services.  They are an intelligence agency, though I use that term loosely. They are...&quot;, she thought a second. &quot;...a rival spy organization.  Though they really just blunder about without any idea what they are doing.&quot;</p>

He belonged to a very old race of creatures called the Duinuogwuin.&quot;  <br><br>She paused as her translator made a slight beep.  &quot;It apparently translates to Star Dragon in your language here.

            <p>Both franchises usually focus on a plucky band of misfit adventurers who follow some manner of royalty as they gallivant about saving the world in a fantasy setting, so it could theoretically work.</p>

            <p>... for slapping LotR/Middle-earth names into fantasy games, back in the days when all games were text. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband_%28video_game%29">Angband</a> is another example; you crawl through a dungeon and occasionally encounter Tolkien characters for... no apparent reason beyond name recognition. It dates back to 1990, so quite a bit more recent.<br><br>As to <i>Galadriel in Distress</i>... well, the solution on the website Pippa linked to suggests that you have to &#39;say Sesame&#39; to get into somewhere, rub a lamp, fly on a carpet... I&#39;m guessing not a whole lot to do with the books.<br><br>(Though I&#39;m now imagining sending an agent team into it... ehehe. Best idea: they go off-track and start wandering through Bizarro Arda.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, you can play it if you want... the game can be downloaded <a href="http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/profs/electron/cats/potter.html#Galadriel_In_Distress">here</a> (the tape version), and it works on the ElectrEm emulator <a href="http://www.stairwaytohell.com/emulators/index.html?page=homepage">here</a>.<br><br>At least, I think they call that &#39;working&#39;.
