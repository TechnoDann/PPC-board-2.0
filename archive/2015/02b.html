            <p>(Well, it is Wednesday, right?)<br><br>As of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=268405;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">a couple of days ago</a>, I&#39;ve adopted the character of Maethorwen from Miah and Caddy-Shack (written in their story as &#39;Maethrowen&#39;, but this version makes more sense). And then I wrote a backstory for her - and realised that I had no reason to ever reveal it in a story.<br><br>So I wrote a story just to do that. And since I couldn&#39;t resist picking on the Marquis de Sod a bit... well.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bUgRdn34uQIA3B43RhybSkMtxYEKW-JRVibONqeD9W4/pub#h.budlo668gyn2">Maethorwen&#39;s Recruitment</a><br><br>(Note that several other short stories are listed below it; they were previously posted on the Board as responses to people&#39;s missions, which is the purpose of this file)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you were able to write something for her. I&#39;d never have thought of a scene with the Marquis to be able to be that funny, haha. Admittedly I&#39;m not very knowledgeable on the lore of the elves, but I still found it plenty funny, so that&#39;s a plus!  It&#39;s good to see that not all bits and OC&#39;s  end up too obscure to use.</p>

            <p>That was so great! I knew I could never do justice to her character, and I hate seeing recruits forgotten about completely. Thank you for taking over her character.<br><br>I also love scenes with the Marquis. I think he&#39;s my favorite Flower. </p>

I can understand the bad grammar and stuff, but the constant use of centered formatting is just... blech. I like how you used it for whenever the badfic characters were talking, though, because it helps differentiate which characters are speaking. The part with the agents&#39; argument spilling over into the badfic was also pretty interesting - it&#39;s a reminder that if you aren&#39;t too careful, you may end up getting involved, and nobody wants that. Or was that the fic spilling over into the argument? I couldn&#39;t tell, and that really creeped me out - as it should&#39;ve.<br><br>The training montage was pretty interesting, especially the way you made Randa screw with Marvin. It really showcases the relationships among both agent pairs. The part where Marvin blamed Printworthy and the latter didn&#39;t rat out Randa for it made me lol. If only they&#39;d realized the truth. The transition to the next scene was a bit abrupt for my taste, though given the nature of badfic, I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised at all.<br><br>Marvin chewing out one of the Sues for her misguided cutie mark was a bit unexpected, but I liked it regardless. It not only demonstrates his knowledge of this continuum, but also that he and Rina behave differently when it comes to spazzing out in the face of an incorrect badfic detail. I half-expected the mission to just end off right then and there but when they mentioned the Stu, well, I suddenly understood why they left the Sue to her own devices after that. It&#39;s an interesting plot twist that kept me hooked.<br><br>The biggest surprise, though, was the stinger - I didn&#39;t know missions even had stingers! Mine don&#39;t... Anyway, Mr. Baker realizing that Lightning was an alicorn, his frantic demand for answers, the Matrix-like recruitment scene (Was that agent from the Matrix continuum? It would&#39;ve been even better if he was!), all of it was just the icing on the cake, no puns intended. I&#39;d have been tempted to put Mr. Baker in the Kitchen staff just because of his role in the world of the badfic, but I&#39;ll concede that it&#39;s really your call as to where he ends up.<br><br>All in all, congrats to both of you for finally completing this mission! *tosses Spikes again* ARCEUS-D@MN IT, WHYYYY?!</p>

            <p>Hey, watch it! I almost got impaled by one of those!<br>(Tried to makes a Spike joke, failed. Went with obvious answer.)<br><br>Thanks for taking the time to review the mission! This was an interesting one, to say the least. The use of center-formatting was very distracting. At times, combined with the bad spelling and grammar, it would actually physically hurt us. There are times center-formatting is appropriate,(usually for poems of the shorter variety) but this was not one of them.<br><br>The thing with the argument was this: there was a line in the fic that said Lightning and Midnight heard voices in the distance arguing with each other. We thought it would be funny if the Agents filled the role of the unidentified voices, so we set it up so those lines would fit for their situation. I think later in the fic Lightning and Midnight go back into the tunnel and there were murderers or something, but honestly, I did not care at that point.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you liked the training montage. Most people seem to, so that puts me at ease. I do somewhat agree that the transition was abrupt, but the idea that Marvin and Rina slam head-first into a wall was too good to pass up. Plus, the scene was just starting to go a little long, and we needed to move on.<br><br>Funny you should mention Marvin&#39;s knowledge of canon. That is going to be brought up in a later mission/interlude. No real spoilers, though. Anyway, as far as the ranting scene goes, I thought it would be interesting for Marvin to interrupt the Sue and rant a bit. There used to be a thing where Agents would mess with Sues before killing them. I just wanted to harken back to those days a bit. Keep in mind, Marvin does not do this kind of thing often. It&#39;s just that he had a major head injury a little while before and had it up to <i>here</i> with this Sue.<br><br>I&#39;m glad somebody brought up the stinger! That was (almost) all me! I was waiting for Iximaz one day, and I thought back to Mr. Baker. In the fic, he mentioned how there were only supposed to be two alicorns: Celestia and Luna. We contemplated recruiting him, but decided to let him assimilate into canon instead. I decided, while waiting, I was going to make a short stinger full of baking puns, because I could. Eventually, I decided to recruit him anyway, by having his memories unlock and he freaks out. Now I can make the announcement I wanted to make:<br><br>Mr. Baker is, indeed, going to join the cooking staff. I assign him over to whomever writes fics involving the cafeteria staff. I have no interest in keeping him, and unless Iximaz has had a change of heart, neither does she. So, there you have it. A new cook in HQ.<br><br>As for the DoI agent, <s>xe</s> it is absolutely anybody you want it to be. If SeaTurtle or anybody else wants to make a reference to some baker pony seeing them in the field, fine by me. I wanted it to be as ambiguous as possible. I doubt they were from the Matrix, though. Likely just making an elaborate reference.<br><br>I am glad you enjoyed our mission. I had a lot of fun writing this with Iximaz. Hopefully the next mission won&#39;t take a friggin year to complete.</p>

            <p>The Stinger was all Jumper&#39;s idea (and mostly all his writing, too). We discussed a &#39;traditional&#39; recruitment for Mr. Baker, but decided it would interrupt the story. <br><br>So Jumper tacked it on at the end, and I think it turned out very nicely. :)</p>

            <p>Why is there a holographic horse in my bathroom?<br><br>Oh, I beg your pardon, you&#39;re a &#39;pony&#39;. Because that&#39;s so different. Can we focus on the bathroom-related aspects of the situation?<br><br>... right, usually these reports get pushed under my door, not hand-delivered by alarming levels of technology. But fine. Message received. I&#39;ll read it after my shower.<br><br>... fine, before. Now get lost.<br><br>Mission: The Lost Land<br>Agents: Rina Dives, Randa Roan, Marvin Jones, Printworthy<br>Continuum: <i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i><br><br>I&#39;ll say one thing right out the door: these agents do an exceptional job of &#39;introducing&#39; themselves to the readers. Marvin&#39;s assumptions about &#39;the Assassins&#39; strike precisely the right note; it makes me almost nostalgic for the old days, when <i>everyone</i> assumed that the other departments were a bunch of psychopaths. The fact that his preconception survives his initial encounter with Rina and Randa only makes it more effective - his world-weary defence of his fandom being broken by the discovery that both Assassins are also MLP fans (I refuse to write the word... well, you know the word) is a perfect moment of characterisation. I hope he learnt as much from it as he seems to have.<br><br>Then the agents entered their fic, and in a storytelling moment that is perhaps too good to be entirely accurate, the roles are reversed: Rina and Randa are caught literally wrong-footed by their disguises, while Marvin plays the consummate expert. It&#39;s only Printworthy bringing him back down to earth that suggests there might be some factual reporting involved.<br><br>And... the report proceeds at a good clip, with the agents recording both relevant parts of the badfic (though they do sometimes go a little overboard with the multi-paragraph sections) and their own actions; I have to congratulate them there, since so many agents leave out one or (more usually) the other. The break for the magic and flying lessons comes in precisely the right place - suspiciously so; I suspect the hoof of Printworthy lies heavily on the pacing here - and the lessons themselves are both believable and revealing of the agents&#39; characters.<br><br>And then, of course, things start to go wrong; this wouldn&#39;t be the PPC if they didn&#39;t. Marvin&#39;s interruption, sudden grimdark, the argument spilling over; it all acts as a perfect setup for the final showdowns. And yes, the Duty is suitably dramatic, without being overwrought.<br><br>It&#39;s very rare that I write one of these reviews without finding something to complain about, but for once, I&#39;m forced to do exactly that. Except for that ridiculous holographic pony. If whoever is behind this tries something like that again, I swear I&#39;ll track you down and papercut you to death.<br><br>Now I&#39;m going for my shower.<br><br>(<a href="http://terrireviews.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/the-lost-land.html">Yes, it&#39;s on the blog</a>)<br><br><hr>

            <p>Thank you kindly! A lot of the stuff that Ripper provided was actually from his homefic and my very first mission (which was the one he first appeared in, incidentally). If I had to choose one of the four Suvian characters to rescue, it would most likely be him, because he had the most potential to become a more balanced character in his own right. I was worried that his return wouldn&#39;t go over as well as it did, but I&#39;m happy that it turned out okay.<br><br>Would &quot;Smaug in a Poke Ball&quot; make a good Creative Curse? &#39;Cuz I&#39;d definitely have Falchion use it...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t take Shining Horn, though.

The goal for this run: catch all 151 of the original &#39;mons in a modded version of Pokйmon Red. <br><br>For the uninitiated, TPP is essentially a game of Pokйmon Red run through an emulator and that accepts commands via Twitch.tv&#39;s chat system. For example, a user can type &quot;up&quot; and then move the character up. The idea is for the entire audience to simultaneously control the player character and try to win the game under these conditions. Naturally, <s>anarchy</s> <s>democracy</s> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iX98LPU.gif">chaos</a> ensues.<br><br>As I write this, the countdown is at T-minus four-ish hours.

            <p>Honestly, I think it&#39;s been becoming less and less interesting since gen 3... A good part of the fun was in the fandom, and there was way less popular following after Crystal.<br>Though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYb8ux67W2E">this song</a> is still being referenced in French web videos. But that&#39;s because France has the most awesome youtubers, and there&#39;s <i>nothing</i> you can say to change my mind.

            <p>I have no idea how twelve year-old me got through the books- I guess it was just how amazing they are when you look at them as a whole. If you look at individual scenes, though, they can go by rather slowly, but Tolkien has such an enchanting style I find it hard to stop reading. However, there&#39;s just so much to remember in the books, I&#39;m having a hard time keeping track of what&#39;s what, and it&#39;s why I&#39;ve been so hesitant to try a mission in LotR.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that this is a high school class, but that didn&#39;t seem to concern anyone when at least eight girls said they couldn&#39;t wait to see the movie.

            <p>I tend to agree with you, and for the same reason I don&#39;t like Twilight--it pretty much turns a woman into a passive object.<br><br>I&#39;ve read a little about the kinky whips-and-chains thing some people like (hey, I&#39;m asexual and I was curious), and the one thing I see all the time is people saying that the point of it is for everyone involved to enjoy it. It&#39;s pretend. No one&#39;s actually enslaved, or forced, or whatever. I don&#39;t want to go further than that because let&#39;s keep it PG-13, yeah? But this is a voluntary thing that people do because they like it.<br><br>But Fifty Shades of Gray seems to ignore all that in favor of... uh... basically romanticizing stockholm syndrome. Or near to it--at least, implying that it&#39;s romantic to actually be powerless, as opposed to pretending while you get it on with your partner. It&#39;s the same thing as Twilight.<br><br>If it were PWP, I don&#39;t think people would be so disgusted by it, but it apparently makes an attempt at characterization and story--and fails badly at both.</p>

            <p>There’s a reason why, for practitioners of BDSM, keeping every participant save is as important as having every participants informed consent.

            <p>Well, yeah, of course it&#39;s the same thing as Twilight in terms of its disgusting sexual politics. It&#39;s Twilight fanfic.

            <p>...or Pokйsister, whichever applies to you. Enjoy your adventure in Kalos!<br><br><br>Protip: there are Riolu in the grass on Route 22 (just east of the first gym!). They have a 5% chance of appearing during the day and range between levels 6 or 7. It&#39;s kinda hard to find one but having one on your team is a godsend.<br><br>Also: play with your &#39;mons in Amie. They get exp boost, land crits, dodge attacks, resist otherwise fatal injuries with 1 HP, and more at high affection levels.</p>

            <p>They know Counter, so if you&#39;re trying to capture them, they can dish out a lot of damage. They&#39;re also kind of fragile before evolving, which is a bit unfortunate.<br><br>Anyway, if you do Pokйmon-Amie (which I highly recommend because of what SeaTurtle said), the fastest way to get them to full affection is to play with them twice in Head It (Play on Unlimited and get to about 100 points since it goes faster and goes the second-best kind of Puffs), feed them with the best possible Pokй Puffs until they&#39;re full, and repeat. Don&#39;t bother with petting because it takes too long. It should take about fifteen minutes per Pokйmon to get them to max affection.</p>

I have this one Unfezant-- Fowler-- who was just meant to learn Fly and not be part of the main party. Well, it turns out that with with an adamant nature and massive IVs and EVs in attack, Fowler quickly became a physical monster that dealt insane amounts of damage from something even as simple as Quick Attack. With Giga Impact on him, it&#39;s GG as soon as he hits the field.

            <p>Interesting mission, though you may have to clear up what&#39;s going on with Carmine.<br><br>Let me see if I&#39;m understanding this correctly: Canon Pit was possessed by a Sue-wraith. The agents exorcised it. But given that the AU could have been plausible, Palutena basically removed the badfic portions of the wraith (e.g., the emo and wangst aspects), thus converting it into an AU doppelganger of Pit for you to recruit.<br><br>Am I correct?<br><br>A different query: Why is Sarah swearing by Steve Rogers? IIRC, Captain America is not part of the <i>Incredibles</i> universe.<br><br>That aside, the mission itself was pretty interesting, and the &quot;dark reprise&quot; was pretty creative.<br><br>There are some errors that I caught:<br><br>1) <i>Rashida’s glare could have burned through the Omnidroid. “…Or not,” Sarah said meekly.</i><br><br>This line should be two separate paragraphs, since there are two &quot;speakers,&quot; Rashida and Sarah.<br><br><br>2) <i>The two of them watched the scene with Pit confronting the group of gods replay from Viridi’s point of view.</i><br><br>This sentence <i>is</i> grammatically correct, and I could figure out what you were trying to say—on a second reading of the sentence. It&#39;s awkwardly worded. Please consider rewording it. How about this instead: &quot;The two of them watched a replay of the scene with Pit confronting the group of gods, thid time from Viridi’s point of view.&quot;<br><br><br>3) <i>&quot;Two people were beckoning her to come and talk to them from behind a tree.&quot;</i><br><br>Dangling modifier. (Are the <i>two people</i> behind a tree, or are they telling her to <i>talk to them</i> from behind a tree?). Rephrase to clarify what you intend to convey. Consider this: &quot;From behind a tree, two people were beckoning her  to come and talk to them.&quot;<br><br>Or perhaps this: &quot;Two people were beckoning her from behind a tree to come and talk to them.&quot;<br><br>Though in hindsight, it seems like my first suggestion is better.<br><br><br>3) <i>And that’s exactly what it wants too.</i><br>You need a comma before &quot;too&quot;.<br><br><br>4) <i>PSTD</i><br>You got the letters mixed up.

            <p>Like I said in the commentary, the backstory itself wasn&#39;t the worst thing about this fic, and I would have liked to see someone explore it in a proper way. The only real inconsistency I found with it was that Pit appeared as something like an 6- to 8-year-old in the original game, as opposed to him being a teenager the whole time. (Then again, Palutena could have changed his appearance at any time, based on the best ending of said game, so I&#39;m willing to bet even that could still be handled.)<br><br>Sarah actually didn&#39;t start swearing by Marvel superheroes (due to Marvel being brought by Disney) until after she joined the PPC (IIRC, she swore by Captain Marvel near the start of my Teen Titans mission). I should&#39;ve made that clear somewhere, maybe on the Wiki page.</p>

            <p>There WILL be a few such scenes in Cupid&#39;s first mission, just as an advance warning (and I&#39;m working to integrate them into the story as much as I can), but his second one (which is also in progress) won&#39;t have any to compensate.

            <p>First off, a possible typo - on pg. 16, Sarah calls Rashida a loin (and Rashida refers to it on pg. 18, using the same spelling).  I <i>think</i> you meant lion?  <br><br>If you did mean loin, I don&#39;t think it really works there.  It doesn&#39;t make much sense as a sanitized swearword, given the f-bombs that are dropped in the same scene, and as a reference (to Iximaz&#39;s Loin!Sue?) it&#39;s a little too obscure.  Even if it&#39;s not meant to be a typo, given Rashida&#39;s leonine nature, it <i>feels</i> like one.  If it&#39;s intentional, I&#39;d have the characters explain it in-text.<br><br>Also, the link to the badfic doesn&#39;t work and I can&#39;t find it on the author&#39;s page.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s been deleted or if I just don&#39;t understand Wattpad, but I figured you might want to know.<br><br>As for more general feedback, I really liked the conflict between Sarah and Rashida.  It felt like it developed naturally, and did a good job representing the tipping point between &quot;quarrelsome partners&quot; and &quot;negative relationship.&quot;  I would have liked to see a little more resolution to that argument, although it may be that that&#39;s coming at some point in the future.<br><br>Personally, though, I felt like you tried a little too hard to force the badfic into being something it wasn&#39;t in order to justify your treatment of it, if that makes sense.  I&#39;m probably not in the best position to comment on this, since I don&#39;t know the fandom and can&#39;t find the fic, but I didn&#39;t really understand why you felt V.R. was salvageable based on what you showed in your mission.  Especially based on the first passage you quote from the fic, she comes off like a very blatant Sue.  Even more, she&#39;s one of my least favorite variations, the Grimdark!Sue who turns canonically good characters into villains just so she can look badass by opposing them.  Within the mission, you try to excuse her by saying she genuinely wants to help Pit, but I don&#39;t buy it.  Lots of Sues claim that they want to help their targets.  Here, the fact that we learn of Pit&#39;s issues through Violet&#39;s PoV reinforces the idea that she&#39;s the one responsible for their existence.  And given her relationship with Pit, it feels like she&#39;s trying to reshape him from his canon characterization into the angsty rebel that she really lusts after.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that that&#39;s the only valid interpretation of the story.  However, I think it would make the mission as a whole seem stronger if you focused it a little more on V.R.&#39;s recruitment.  I know that the whole issue with Pit is fairly complicated and needs to be explored, but her recruitment is kind of just thrown in there, and it feels like an afterthought.  <br><br>Ironically, it also muddies the issue of Cupid&#39;s recruitment - by making him more responsible for the fic&#39;s flaws, it makes his suitability as a recruit seem more questionable.  If you&#39;d just made her the main perpetrator, I don&#39;t think I would have any issues with his recruitment.  In that sense, I think killing Violet and recruiting Cupid would have been the &quot;cleaner&quot; option, though maybe I&#39;m just being overly bloodthirsty, or prejudiced because I really dislike needlessly grimdark fics.<br><br>Sorry for focusing so much on the aspects of your mission that I didn&#39;t care for!  Overall, I though there was a lot of really good stuff in there, but I wanted to make sure you understood where I was coming from.  I also think that expanding on some of the stuff, such as through an intermission, would make a big difference.  There are some really interesting possibilities with your decisions, and it may be that I just need to wait for them to be explored.</p>

            <p>I checked back to the original link and holy balls, you&#39;re right! I did manage to save around half of the fic on a word document if anyone wants to read what I have; I just put it up on Google Docs with a summary of what else I was able to find and updated the mission accordingly. Lady Palutena, I can&#39;t believe how close to a complete disaster that mission was!...<br><br>Anyway, based on what I read and what I have on file, V.R. didn&#39;t actually do very much in the fic itself. Almost everything that happened to Pit was inflicted upon by himself, and she was actually trying to <i>prevent</i> him from becoming an angsty rebel. If she&#39;d wanted that sort of temperament, why not just hook up with Dark Pit? Also, I was banking on the idea that V.R. was an unreliable narrator, especially given that most of the fic took place from the point of view of different characters. Palutena was not openly antagonistic in any of her appearances, and she genuinely did try to help Pit as much as everyone else involved. I don&#39;t really see V.R. as being a problem so much as having a very ingrained misunderstanding of Palutena, but her knowledge of the canon is enough that it wasn&#39;t mangled, the made-up backstory notwithstanding.<br><br>The interlude after this mission was initially going to be just Sarah meeting Velociripper (from my previous mission) again, with all the irrational violence that it implies. Come to think of it, though, I think having V.R. show up in said interlude, talk to Ripper as well, and have him help her come to terms with her own status as a former Sue (and starting the whole mess in the first place besides) would be really helpful, because I honestly had no idea how the interlude would go down otherwise.<br><br>I&#39;ve promised to hand V.R. off to eatpraylove, but I can talk to her about this and we&#39;ll be able to think of something together. We&#39;ll see!</p>

            <p>Ah, okay.  I didn&#39;t really get the sense that her behavior and statements were necessarily contradicting the reality of the fic.  Maybe have a character mention that she&#39;s not doing much, or that Palutena is acting more or less in character despite what V.R. said?  I really like the idea of a Sue who isn&#39;t so much a reality warper as completely delusional.<br><br>I think my lack of familiarity with the continuum was also hampering my understanding of the situation.  To me, it read like the opening to a lot of &quot;Harry is being manipulated by Dumbledore&quot; fic, and I think my expectations of that kind of story was influencing my response to V.R.<br><br>I look forward to seeing the interlude!</p>

            <p>You picked a heck of a seventh mission, I&#39;ll say that much. Parts of it were painful to read even when we were still writing it! (But that might just be my sensitive stomach talking.)<br><br>The only thing that slightly bothers me is Angela/Panacea&#39;s recruitment. I get why you did it (she didn&#39;t do much wrong and the fic didn&#39;t need her anyway), but wouldn&#39;t it have been a little easier to let her assimilate back into canon? Skyworld having a nurse of some description is very plausible; after all, the ones from the first game would&#39;ve had to go somewhere. <br><br>Great to see how you tweaked the &quot;look through canon to check for Sue-wraiths&quot; idea to fit a 3DS! I hope more people pick up on that idea, cause it&#39;s a keeper.<br><br>Also, obligatory nitpicking:<br><i>&quot;And that,&quot; Rashida snarled. &quot;is why we are here.&quot;</i><br>The period after &quot;snarled&quot; should be a comma.<br><br><i>Rashida had seen the look on her partner’s face only once before, and that was just after the latter...&quot;</i><br>The &quot;and that was just&quot; is unnecessary, delete it. <br><br><i>“When Pit destroyed the Mirror of Truth, it created a copy that represented his true feelings,” said Rashida. “Usually, if a character is warped so completely, he or she splits off into a canon and a replacement. But what if the real Pit is acting so OOC because his AU ‘replacement’… is still inside him?”</i><br>Rashida&#39;s third line sounds like it should come from Sarah. But that&#39;s just me.<br><br>There might be more, but again, I have homework :(</p>

            <p>I&#39;m jealous of your ability to throw confetti. I only have Spikes on me most of the time...<br><br>I decided to recruit Panacea as opposed to putting her back because Kid Icarus is horribly underrepresented among the PPC character roster, even though it&#39;s theoretically supposed to encompass all continua. I can understand Cupid but I felt like adding in some variety by taking in a supporting role as well. Besides, she&#39;s good at what she does, and I&#39;m sure a lot of people would be grateful for that.<br><br>And turning the 3DS into a makeshift Silph Scope was a last-minute addition. I would have had Sarah just put the game card up to her eyelid, but I had no idea how that would work, so the 3DS was a bit of a cop-out on my part. Besides, Sarah&#39;s going to be seeing a <i>lot</i> more video-game continua when she transfers to the DIC in the interlude I have planned after this mission, so it would make sense for her to start somewhere.</p>

            <p>(Because I have someone there!)<br><br>&quot;Well, now, Mary, what&#39;s this? Is it new friends? It <i>is</i>!&quot; Mary Wentway stared blankly at her mother, her eyes seeming much too big for her face. Elanor chuckled and pushed her hair out of her eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, <i>ma chйrie</i>, you&#39;ll get it eventually. I suppose two weeks is a <i>bit</i> early to expect comprehension.&quot;<br><br>Since Mary wasn&#39;t actively crying (the ceiling had distracted her), Elanor turned her attention to the newcomers. &quot;Arman and Lucy,&quot; she murmured, looking down into their side-by-side bassinets. Lucy met her gaze with that same wide-eyed stare that all newborns seem to perfect: not so much disbelief as simple incomprehension of everything in front of her face.

Let me see what we have here.” Carry said as he stepped out of the bathroom.</i><br>Still-not-an-agent Hieronymus rubbed his eyes. &quot;Did Carry just step out of the bathroom twice?&quot; he wondered aloud. &quot;Also, I’m used to see a comma with the quotation mark when it’s followed by something like ‘Carry said’,” he continued. &quot;Although I admit that it would look weird with Carry saying two full sentences. Maybe this should be reworded?&quot;<br>Not-an-agent-yet Androia Avatar hit him over the head. &quot;PPCing the PPC is a bad idea,&quot; she scolded. &quot;We should restrict these shenanigans to the badfic games.&quot;<br><br><i>Carry opened the portal and stepped through into a classroom that was filled with beige outlines of generic people in a barely described classroom.</i><br>Hieronymus silently paged the Redundant Department of Redundancy while Androia looked the other way.

Androia wondered briefly whether <i>Madam Pomphrey</i> might be a Mini from the badfic. Hieronymus frowned when Carry <i> finally looked over <b>and</b> Gloom and gave her a tired smile</i> (&quot;Don’t know what to do with this.&quot;) and when Gloom stuttered ordering the canon characters <i><b>to to</b> go back where you were when Deathly Hallows started</i>. Then he had to page the Repetitive Department of Repetition because Carry <i>handed out wands <b>before</b> fumbling the RA out and opening a portal <b>before</b> shooing</i> the canons through.<br><br>Arriving at the Nursery, Androia had to chase another word gone astray from <i>The wall that been behind the portal</i>, but in the end she said, &quot;I am glad that this became so much better after the bad start. Otherwise, our author would still be typing next week. He is so terribly slow.&quot;<br><br>HG, being terribly sorry for this.</p>

            <p>(Pun retroactively intended.)<br>... But I have only <i>just</i> figured out where where Doom/Gloom is from and wow that is actually rather obvious in retrospect.

            <p>I am glad you like her. I had a bit of trouble over introducing that, since while a lot of agents are up for explaining where they are from, I doubt someone from there would really like to dwell on it. Admittedly, I only added in &#39;clues&#39; when something really obviously tied to the games happened, as I&#39;d like to think she had some therapy before duty, and could put it out of her mind.<br><br>Plus it&#39;s there for future conversations.

            <p>I’m tempted to send the Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies in to hit Makes-Things over the head with <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>. Since when does &quot;technology&quot; not work at Hogwarts? This fanon is apparently based on Hermione’s explanation why Rita &quot;The Bug&quot; Skeeter couldn’t bug Hogwarts. But Hermione talked only about electricity and some examples of electric or electronic devices, like microphones, recorders, radio etc.<br><br>Hagrid’s crossbow is technology. Harry’s watch is technology. Colin Creevey’s camera is technology. There’s no implication in canon that these devices are magical, and they work just fine at Hogwarts. <br><br>I&#39;m sure that the TCDA’s steampunk equivalents of PPC technology would work at Hogwarts. And there is no reason to assume that futuristic sci-fi-technology would not work at Hogwarts as long as we don’t assume that all technology from fictional future worlds will always be an application of electricity. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Agent Hieronymus sat in front of the console and glared at the screen. The screen glared back, displaying an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1WM_ntk4lDGTBbRWoNiCNdq7yUQ8PmueC0tmE87UQM58">article</a> that described all sorts of CADs and clearly said that wires and electronics where therein.  It also displayed, in a smaller window, two quotes from <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> (Chapter 28): &quot;Harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment ... &quot; and &quot;All those substitutes for magic Muggles use – electricity, and computers and radar, and all those things – they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there&#39;s too much magic in the air.&quot;<br><br>Androia shut the door with a bang. Hieronymus started and turned around. Androia’s robe was now decorated with a sticker saying &quot;Trust DoSAT – we make things work&quot; and, in much smaller letters, &quot;Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology&quot;.<br><br>&quot;You’ve been at DoSAT? What did you do there? Hit Makes-Things over the head?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I talked with him about our CAD not working at Hogwarts.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He said it should work, because it is shielded from the magic by some sort of field making it Somebody Else’s Problem.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But the description doesn’t say anything about a built-in SEP generator!&quot;<br><br>&quot;He also gave me some stickers; these are for you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If agents understand it, DoSAT doesn’t do it. Department of <i>Sufficiently Advanced</i> Technology. Yeah, that’s funny.&quot; Hieronymus hefted the sticker unto his wizard’s robe. Then he read the other one:<br><br>STOP BEING REASONABLE!<br><br>Hieronymus frowned. &quot;Makes-Things made a mistake,&quot; he said. &quot;You should wear this. &quot;<br><br>&quot;Why?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because I can’t see it while it is on <i>my</i> chest.&quot;<br><br>Androia looked puzzled for a moment, but then here face brightened. &quot;Now I understand why Make-Things said I should also wear this,&quot; she said, producing another sticker from here robe’s waist pocket.<br><br>DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!<br><br>------------------------------- <br><br>Author’s note: This is out of continuity for obvious reasons.

            <p>Okay, I didn&#39;t have a link, so you beat me to being better than me... anyhow. I was going to say it could be the canon-cloaking effect accepting such devices as &#39;native&#39; despite them not actually fitting in.

            <p>Actually, clockworks and steam engines and such technology work quite well at Hogwarts. Electricity and electronics are supposed to not work due to magical interference, but this may depend on whether you believe Hermione Granger. After all she is only mostly right. Anyway, PPC technology is probably powered by plot holes and applied phlebotinum and thus not affected by magical interference.<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Saxo_Cruore"> Saxo  Cruore</a> was recruited because Mittens and the Radioactive Moss Creature needed a wizard to <i>obliviate</i> everybody at Hogwarts. I assume their neuralyzer didn’t work because the Ironic Overpower could proactively take advantage of RMC remembering that something ripped off <i>Man in Black</i> should be powered by electricity. Like others already suggested, I assume that Rina and Randa’s neuralyzer worked because they never thought about it.<br><br>Basically, PPC technology works at Hogwarts as long as the agents don’t know how to change or recharge the battery. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>And since this is PPC technology we&#39;re talking about, there could be several answers:<br><br><br>- Maybe DoSAT&#39;s Sufficiently Advanced Technology really <i>is</i> indistinguishable from magic, even to magic itself.<br><br>- Maybe PPC tech uses a little bit of magic. Would enchanted technology work at Hogwarts? There was the flying Ford Anglia, but I&#39;m not sure if it counts.<br><br>- Maybe it has some kind of shielding against magical interferences, specifically made for continua where magic and technology can&#39;t work together.<br><br>- Maybe it really <i>isn&#39;t</i> supposed to work, and the badfic warps the continuum so badly that technology can (barely) work at Hogwarts. That theory would probably be disproved by trying to use a CAD or RA in a goodfic or the original continuum, though. Has anyone done this yet?<br><br>- Maybe it&#39;s some other stuff I didn&#39;t think of.<br><br><br>By the way, it raises another interesting question. Would PPC technology work in the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_%28novel%29">Orthogonal</a>&quot; continuum, where normal electronics can&#39;t work due to a change in the laws of physics? I mean, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s Orthogonal badfic, but it&#39;s still interesting to think about...</p>

            <p>He had non-3D+1 universes in another novel I read, I think it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_(novel)">Diaspora</a> - I distinctly remember discussions of orbits in non-3D+1 environments.<br><br>Speaking of altered laws of physics, there&#39;s also the universes of <a href="http://unicornjelly.com/">Unicorn Jelly</a>/<a href="http://pasteldefender.com/to%20save%20her%20archive.html">To Save Her</a> and <a href="http://pasteldefender.com/">Pastel Defender Heliotrope</a>, which are... really weird. That&#39;s both the stories and the universes which are weird - the latter feature different fundamental forces and particles of matter than our own universe.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the multiverse of <a href="http://qntm.org/structure">Fine Structure</a>, which is where I pulled the &#39;3D+1&#39; terminology from, and also goes into ridiculous numbers of dimensions... and has some kind of connection with UJ/TSH/PDH, since both of them use &#39;ana&#39; and &#39;kata&#39; as the names for fourth-spatial-dimension directions. They may both be drawing on the same source, though, I can&#39;t find a specific mention of it anywhere.<br><br>Heck, for that matter, <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/">Flatland</a>.

Looking at it, I explained how the notepad worked in 2D, but just glossed over the Remote Activator with &#39;I hope it still works&#39;.

            <p>Portals could be replaced with Portkeys and Apparation, though it would be way too much trouble for agents to drag Portkeys around (not to mention they activate at a certain time and take you to a predetermined location, and need a spell to be created), and Apparation is only possible for witches and wizards and can&#39;t be done within Hogwarts (or other similarly warded areas).<br><br>CADs could be replaced with the low-tech (though not as accurate) litmus strips... <br><br>I really hope I didn&#39;t just break all Potterverse missions. :P</p>

            <p>So... technology won&#39;t work, and magical solutions would be difficult at best.

I know magic hasn&#39;t been explained, but the PPC might be able to develop new spells to suit the purposes of agents (and since I&#39;m not familiar with the canon as much as I should be, please take anything I say with a grain of salt). It&#39;s possible the Department of Mysteries could assist, and it&#39;s not far fetched that they could have some knowledge of the PPC (again, just making theories here). Perhaps a magical enhancement to existing PPC tech would be the answer, something that acts as a sort of &quot;admin password&quot; for the wards to allow agents to move as needed.</p>

Characterisation is almost non-existent, the Stu shows up and is bestest at everything, I was able to point out canon flubs for a series I&#39;ve only read the first damned book of (which itself was like nine years ago Jesus I am twenty-two I should not feel old), and then the cast of sodding DragonBall Whatever shows up and it contrives to get even worse. The Stu is atrocious, his girlfriend&#39;s a Sue as well, and the needless author&#39;s notes are hurled about with such abandon I fear for the agents&#39; skulls.

            <p>Hello, I am the author of this fanfic. the reason there is almost no characterization is because the prequel has most of it. Duly noted though, i&#39;ll try to add it more. All of the author&#39;s notes are mainly because I don&#39;t like to leave people hanging. I just like to give a reason for why I haven&#39;t been updating. Thanks for this though, I&#39;ll try to do better :)</p>

            <p>Hello, I am the author of these fanfics. They do have a lot of crossovers, mainly because I am planning on making this a big series. The ANs are mainly updates as to why I haven&#39;t been able to post, or just general updates to the story; I would rather give a reason to why I left my readers hanging than just leaving it at that.

            <p>I think those are planned crossovers, since the only ones I was able to glean as definitely in place in the fic were Doctor Who and DragonBallZ, and the latter only show up in the last chapter of Athreiens. Well, the last proper chapter anyway; the author is bemoaning a variety of things over the course of the next four, which are entirely Author&#39;s Notes.<br><br>There&#39;s a lot of those in this.</p>

            <p>Um. Okay. Not gonna lie, I have no knowledge of, what was it,  <i>Young Justice</i>? So right from the get-go I&#39;ve been a bit confused. I keep picturing Violet from <i>The Boxcar Children</i> and Wally from <i>Pokйmon</i>. ^^;<br><br>Anyway, aside from the... Justice Team? being invited to participate in the Triwizard Tournament (seriously, wat? Why? Is either Beauxbatons or Durmstrang being left out in favor of the Justice Team?), the first major canon break I see is Wally claiming that Mrs. Weasley is his mother&#39;s sister. Nope— Mrs. Weasley had two brothers, Gideon and Fabian. That&#39;s it.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the sudden seemingly blatant disregard for the International. Statute of Secrecy. Usually the only acceptions made to this rule are for family members (how the Young Justice team is related, I don&#39;t know, so maybe it&#39;s not a charge).<br><br>I can only think of one instance where the twins referred to themselves as &#39;Gred and Forge&#39;, and that was as a joke in PS/SS. Hermione letting out little screams of horror seems OOC. And the twins seem very touchy-feely around Violet. I also have a hard time seeing them being friends with a Slytherin; they&#39;re a might biased. <br><br>And honestly, just because the most vocal Slytherins we see in the books hate Muggle-borns doesn&#39;t mean they all do. Don&#39;t you just love when fan writers take things to the extreme? Besides, she really doesn&#39;t act Slytherin-y, especially when she goes talking about her &#39;hero instincts&#39;. That&#39;s definitely a Gryffindor trait.<br><br>After that, it looks like Violet just worms her way into the narrative and is generally obnoxious, but I can&#39;t get past chapter four because she&#39;s making me mad. &quot;No shit Sherlock&quot; and &quot;Suck up&quot;, plus the fact she can speak ten languages, feels very much of Rose Potter. Bleagh.<br><br>Oh, and the twins never nearly jumped out of the box to impress the Veela. That was Harry and Ron. Then there was inserting of movie canon. <br><br>If you want me to take a closer look at this, I can... *grimaces and readies spork*</p>

But, hey! At least the Sue was not chosen...). Well, Wally&#39;s aunt, Iris; doesn&#39;t have another known sister either, besides Wally&#39;s mother. And Dick Grayson, Robin; has no older sister.<br><br>The International Statute of Secrecy is the reason about why the Team is there; in this continuum the Justice League sends the kids into the secret, undercover and borderline illegal missions that the League should not be seen doing (ie.<i>&quot;covert operations&quot;</i>). Also, that&#39;s why Doctor Fate is acting as a liason, he&#39;s the most powerful wizard in the DC Multiverse, (he&#39;s some kind of &quot;magical god&quot; using a mortal as a host to interact with the world) and an Agent of Order and Balance, is his job to deal with magical crises that &quot;muggles&quot; shouldn&#39;t know about.<br><br>Although I do spect a great deal of skill and high notes from someone under the tutelage of the <i>Goddamn Batman</i>, I also think that ten languages is a bit much. <br><br>Overall the <i>Young Justice</i> side seems to be less hit by Suefluence, since everyone is acting pretty much in-character and the events can easily placed within the canon, after the end of Season 1.<br><br>So, after reading the four last paragraphs:<br><br>So much for an attempt to recruit a badfic character, huh? (Yes! I had hope that there was the possibility to recruit Violet!) Don&#39;t worry about this fic for now, concentrate your efforts in <i>Rose Potter</i>. ;D If you want spork it, I could help you with the charges on the <i>Young Justice</i> side of the fic. <br><br>Though, this leaves me with a question: Is impossible for a heroic Slytherin to exist? </p>

            <p>I just want to put it out there that going after a fic primarily to steal the author&#39;s original character is <s>maybe</s> definitely a bit misguided. Firstly, if you want a superhero agent, why not make one up yourself? Use the same powers if that&#39;s what you want, but writing a mission just to recruit someone else&#39;s character seems like a lot of effort you could better spend coming up with your own.<br><br>Secondly, we should only spork the truly deserving, by which I mean so objectively terrible that even someone unfamiliar with the continuum/a should be able to spot problems with the writing. Two good reasons for this are 1) not picking on people for arbitrary reasons of taste, and 2) the fact that mediocre fics tend to make for mediocre missions.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>From what I read, it sounded like the <i>Young Justice</i> portions of the fic aren&#39;t that bad, so you were hoping the Potterverse bits would be so you could go in and recruit the character. Sorry if I misunderstood.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;ll take a look at the fic myself. I know HP and I&#39;ve seen <i>Young Justice</i>, though my memory of it is pretty craptastic. Too easy to mix it up with all the other animated DCU stuff I&#39;ve seen recently, and not all of it in the same continuity. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The misunderstanding was probably my fault, &#39;cuz I was busy having my mind blown over the Bat-Family-Costumed-Vigilante/HP-Witch combination, to express myself clearly over my intentions.<s>Though the character isn&#39;t exactly original, is just a genderbent, comicbook Dick Grayson with magic talent, named after Violet Parr from the Incredibles.</s><br><br>But anyway, you comment actually inspired me and made revise my Superhero OC Library and I found one that I haven&#39;t used in ages! A OC for a (Thank the gods!) never written badfic: A half-Kryptonian clone of Supergirl. Honestly the idea was dumb,the character was dumb and the continuum where the OC&#39;s stories where placed was dumb.<br><br>But regardless, I began to toy with the idea of a Kryptonian Agent, by rescuing that OC from Limbo and giving her some type of magical/otherwise unremovable power limiter/negator that will allow her partner/the Flowers/every single Eldar Agent to remove/give back her more exotic powers and reduce her physical might to human levels/recover her full Kryptonian might. By default, the settings would be no exotic powers/human-level might.</p>

            <p>Long answer: Effectively, Green Lanterns are chosen by the Rings upon the death or retirement of the previous one. Is astronomically rare (pun intended) that children of former Lanterns become Lanterns themselves, as our good friend Amon Sur can attest; with only two known cases, Arisia and Soranik Natu. And even rarer still, is an underage Lantern being chosen with the only known case being Arisia, again; being the physical and mental equivalent of twelve. Arisia is a double special case due to the customs of her native planet.<br><br>Also the chronologically youngest known Green Lantern, was Kyle Rayner, chosen at 18 years old (Arisia was 200!) and, like Arisia, was a very special case.</p>

Here is another good one. <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/948771">The Names Upon The Harp</a>  The summary and tags spoil the ending a bit, so if you scroll past them, it makes the first reading even better, but if you can&#39;t resist the story is still very good.

            <p>-Offers celebratory tea-<br>Some mechanical suggestions: <br>- Single line breaks between paragraphs are sufficient. Double line breaks are too much.<br>- &quot;Alloy flicked the switch and sat down in the room&#39;s singular chair&quot; - &#39;single&#39; works better here, IMO.<br>- &quot;Alloy checked the shoulders- she&#39;d been told that she needed to have a patch there-&quot; - Nesh would probably correct me, but I think those should be em dashes and have spaces before and after them. This is all over the text, so probably find-and-replace is your best friend, here.<br>-Inserting a fic quote in the middle of a sentence probably breaks some sort of rule, but even if doesn&#39;t, it <i>does</i> ruin the flow. <br>-It would seem that <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=268383;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">capitalisation minis are frowned upon?</a><br>- &quot;“oh okay” Ruby said.&quot; -is the badfic affecting her? Otherwise, you&#39;re missing a comma there.<br><br>That said, I liked the mission. It&#39;s funny, the fight scene at the end is good, and the book ends are nice. Well-written, very well-written indeed!<br><br>Oh, also, a question: did you have the services of a beta? I can guess Iximaz at least took a look because one of her agents appears in the mission, but was there anybody else? If so, it should be noted - betas deserve their credit! - and if not, you most definitely get one for your next missions. They catch the mistakes you don&#39;t and generally serve as another pair of eyes, as well as a general advisor.<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve just started reading the &#39;fic (inspired to do so by reading the mission), and... well, words fail me. Rose Potter is just the worst.<br>I did notice while reading that Neville was momentarily turned spherical (&#39;the round boy&#39;), which the Agents didn&#39;t pick up on. I guess there&#39;s enough chargeworthy stuff that a little thing like that doesn&#39;t matter.<br>And another thing... does Zeb have Intimidate? Because I think that might help lessen the impact of Rose&#39;s Sueper-strength.

            <p>...so it&#39;s debatable whether forcing her to switch out would do anything at all. I do think the Flame Orb/Guts plan is a good one (how else could a Heracross fight a Skarmory to a draw?), but since he&#39;s now confirmed to have Intimidate...<br>Dropping Rose&#39;s accuracy is probably a good bet, though.

            <p>...he also has the move Thunder Wave in his arsenal. 100% accuracy and causes paralysis, which cuts speed to 25% of normal and has a 25% chance to paralyze completely. Not to mention his ability will cut her physical attacks to half their power... hehehe.<br><br>Fun fact: Zeb was originally going to be a Lucario, but Rose Potter changed my mind (though his backstory was, in fact, based on an actual Luxray named Zeb who did indeed die on Iron Island to a kamikaze Graveler. I just wanted to have a Lucario agent, but decided against it in the end partially to make tough Sues like Rose easier if necessary, and partially because I wanted to honor that magnificent little bit of data.). I&#39;m actually glad I did; electricity is <i>fun</i> to play with. That, and writing someone non-bipedal/ non-humanoid. That&#39;s also fun. Gives me a wider range of description, like tails flicking in agitation or ears flattening to show embarrassment or anger.</p>

            <p>The really useful one out of the moves I cooked up is actually Trash Bolt. It&#39;s a much more potent ranged Knock Off, basically, and Rose accumulates a few powerful artifacts over the years so it&#39;s an easy, safer way of getting rid of a few in one go.

            <p>That&#39;s why I keep calling them Dubious Rectangles - their legality is questionable, especially in the light of the online version of the TCG knocking about at the moment. I may not know much about the anime, but I <i>do</i> know the games, to the point where I dabble in Smogon&#39;s Rarely Used tier because Gen VI RU has pretty much all my fave poglemens in it, so while I know the stuff listed is about as far away from legal in the games as it&#39;s possible to get without introducing the super-powerful Chaos typing (seriously the AMOUNT OF OTHERWISE TOLERABLE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS I SWEAR TO ARCEUS), it&#39;s at least reasonably balanced for use in an Agent&#39;s situation.<br><br>It&#39;d be interesting to showcase the differences between a TCG Poglemens agent and a video games Poglemens agent, both in battling style and in general characteristics. Would a TCGmon agent have access to all the moves, even the weird ones like Delta Kingdra&#39;s &quot;Heat Blast&quot; - a Fire-type move? How would the Energy system work? The Tool cards, Supporters and Trainers? The draw mechanics and milling the opponent? Hell, Prize Cards would be an interesting vulnerability! It&#39;s a really interesting thought.<br><br>For me, at least. YMMV and all that.<br><br>Also:-<br><br><img src="http://www.memecreator.org/static/images/memes/2093478.jpg"></p>

            <p>You would be amazed at the number of times it crops up, usually as a ludicrously powerful type. I love designing fakemon, so maybe I&#39;m exposed to this more than other people, but it seems to rear its ugly head everywhere I go. It can be done really well - see Pokemon Uranium for an example of how a Chaos typing might actually work - but most of the time it&#39;s used to demonstrate power you haven&#39;t had to work for.<br><br>tl;dr: basically the ultimate Stu typing.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know how versed with Pokйphemera you are, but that ability (Luxray&#39;s hidden one) is actually much more useful in context, both from a combat and thematic standpoint. If you have a way to inflict a burn on yourself, then you can&#39;t suffer another major status effect, and as long as you get topped up with heals every now and again you get a 50% attack boost for free. Which means Zeb needs something that&#39;ll guarantee a burn, since Rose Potter AFAIK cannot learn Knock Off. She might well <i>be</i> a knock-off, but she can&#39;t actually learn it.<br><br>So, what can do that in the games, hm?<br><br>Flame Orb.</p>

Does the amulet, after Hermione swore on it, allow Hermione to see through Rose’s clothes? This doesn’t match what I concluded from the scene where McGonagall explained the Travelling Aid amulet. Apparently it allows Rose to travel without much luggage, enabling her to summon or conjure all the clothes she wants to wear in a weird druidic ritual that requires undressing before the new clothes can be summoned? Did an attempt to avoid giving us too much information result in not giving us enough information about what this amulet really does? You should keep in mind that, although the badfic is legendary, somebody may read this unspoiled.<br><br>HG </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see it as very problematic for Neville to have a learning disability, actually.<br><br>A lot of his trouble definitely comes from lack of confidence, but that isn&#39;t incompatible with a learning disability.<br><br>Neville&#39;s got the typical jagged skill profile of someone with a specific learning disability--he&#39;s way better at some subjects than others, as you can see when you see Neville in Herbology vs. Charms, for example. That kind of skill gap is common for real-life people with things like dyslexia or dyscalculia.<br><br>Neville definitely blossoms by the end of his schooling, especially since he learns to concentrate on his strengths. It becomes obvious that he&#39;s not universally a slow learner; he has weaknesses that he has to work around, like his lack of confidence and the trouble he has with paying attention to details and keeping track of complex things in his mind. I don&#39;t think he would have a learning disability in a Muggle school; maybe he&#39;d lean toward inattentive-type ADHD, but that&#39;d be about it.<br><br>Anyways, that doesn&#39;t really justify the way this fic treats Neville. The writer gives Neville this old magical injury, an old curse that suppressed his magic and gave him this learning disability. And then, once Rose Potter is in the picture, she essentially cured him all at once, just like that. There&#39;s no personal growth for Neville learning how to cope with his problems and his lack of confidence. There&#39;s no working around weaknesses. They&#39;re just taken away. Neville with a disability is unacceptable to Rose Potter, so Rose Potter takes the disability away. Shy, clumsy Neville just isn&#39;t good enough for her, even though he was plenty good enough for Harry Potter. Unfortunate implications much?</p>

            <p>Keep in mind though, that a lot of Neville&#39;s problems seemed to be a combination of 1) Not having his own wand until book six, 2) His lack of confidence, first from his grandmother&#39;s always comparing him to his father, later all his relatives convinced he&#39;s a squib, and 3) Professor Snape&#39;s bullying. <br><br>After Dumbledore&#39;s Army, Neville finally started to become more confident in his abilities and was able to hold his own for a while in the Department of Mysteries, even though he was using a wand not suited for him.<br><br>I could see someone writing a good fic about Neville having a learning disability, but at one point, Rose uses the word &#39;retarded&#39; without a second thought.

            <p>Now I want to write a fic about an intellectually disabled Hogwarts student. I mean, why wouldn&#39;t wizards have that, same as Muggles do, right? So what happens when Hogwarts does have to arrange for special ed for someone who maybe still needs reading or basic math lessons, whose magic is just as strong as any other wizard&#39;s, but who&#39;s slower at learning? Maybe it&#39;s a new development because traditionally, disabled wizarding kids are kept at home. But if this kid is Muggle-born, or if their parents are fighting for them rather than ashamed of them, then why wouldn&#39;t they go to Hogwarts, same as any other student? That might be interesting to do. I&#39;d have to work out the character&#39;s personality and goals and such...</p>

            <p>Why couldn&#39;t a wheelchair user go to Hogwarts?<br><br>I mean, yes: Stairs. I get it; stairs are a problem. However, this is a culture that has broomsticks. As in: Things that can hover, ascend and descend, and that you can ride on--including safe versions that only hover a few feet above the ground, don&#39;t go fast, and are made as children&#39;s toys. What on earth is stopping wizards from building a hover chair for a wheelchair user, with which they could ascend and descend stairs as easily as though they had been riding a broomstick?<br><br>Actually, I&#39;m going to answer my own question here: Chances are, wizards have the same hang-ups about disability as Muggles do, and what&#39;s possible with the technology available isn&#39;t always what&#39;s actually being done with it. A person who needs a hoverchair might not be getting one simply because people think of broomsticks as sports equipment rather than assistive technology.<br><br>A wizarding school for disabled children would be rather interesting to write about. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;d be a tear-jerker in and of itself. Were you referring to &quot;I don&#39;t get to go to Hogwarts&quot;? because yeah, I can see a kid being sad about that. That&#39;s just the way things go when you have a disability and nobody bothers to make those small adjustments to the world, so you can live in it alongside your neighbors.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to ask you to take a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1wTAwwbPuJPQpkAMEZ889DOioo7YprR-qFyqbd0KjSSc">this mission</a>, which is into a badfic I wrote, or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1DRzGHqrVZ0lTdtfOL-GxUFrgko6dVd31efWuARE073c">this one</a>, which was written by a PPC Boarder (and PPC&#39;d on request), or for that matter <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Sj_VpYzdbYNcsfLA7C1ylDYRpbjh55Ii-PhEwifOg4/edit">SkarmorySilver&#39;s first mission</a>, into a story by himself.<br><br>&#39;Suethor&#39; isn&#39;t a word that tells you anything about a person, and I kind of regret not jumping up and down on it when it was first coined. All it tells you is that someone has written a bad piece of fanfiction - and there are three reasons people do that.<br><br>1/ They&#39;re trolling, or deliberately trying to provoke a reaction. That&#39;s really not as common as some Boarders think.<br><br>2/ They know it&#39;s bad and don&#39;t care. This seems to be how most Boarders think virtually <i>all</i> badfics are created, and I believe - I <i>have</i> to believe - it&#39;s why people use &#39;Suethor&#39; as an epithet. But they&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s very rare that someone literally doesn&#39;t care, and they&#39;re usually very obvious - they include comments like &#39;this is the WILD and CRAZY story me and my friends came up with on a sugar rush last night in which Legolas is our new maths teacher and he totally loves all of us!&#39;. Most badfics fall in category three:<br><br>3/ They write badly because they don&#39;t know how to write well. Look back at <i>Rings of Power</i>, my linked mission. I have a whole bunch of writing from about that time which consists of:<br><br>-Group of people encounter situation.<br>-Every single thing which happens in the area affects them.<br>-No-one can solve anything without their help.<br>-They get all the good stuff.<br><br>I did the research. I knew the layout of Lothlorien, and the timeline of the books. I didn&#39;t make up nonsensical, non-canonical stuff. But I hadn&#39;t learnt enough to let the protagonists operate <i>in</i> the world, rather than warping it around them. If they ran into trouble, it was specifically aimed at them - because that makes for added tension, right? R...right?<br><br>The vast majority of badfic writers are young, and still learning to write - heck, I was probably sixteen or seventeen when I wrote that, not even that &#39;young&#39;! But it&#39;s very rare that people can write really well without lots and lots of practice. No, reading a lot doesn&#39;t help: it takes practice to realise that you <i>are</i> doing it differently to Terry Pratchett, or J.K. Rowling, or what have you. And you won&#39;t notice by reading back your own story, either.<br><br>So yeah, we kill Mary-Sues, and exorcise Bad Slash, and break up Disturbing Acts of Violence, and all that other stuff - because it&#39;s fun, and because it lets us highlight what&#39;s wrong about it, and as catharsis on behalf of the canon characters. But we always, always need to remember that authors aren&#39;t out to get us. The vast majority of them just want to write, because they enjoy it, and they have a fountain of ideas in their heads which they need to get down. The only way for them to learn how to do that well... is to do it badly.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I define it as &quot;an author who&#39;s so much a beginner, or doesn&#39;t care enough, that they write Mary Sues&quot;. Most of us went through our own Suethor stage; I wrote an egregious, literally all-powerful Animorphs sue at one point.<br><br>When I read the phrase &quot;even for a Suethor&quot;, I understood it to mean, &quot;Even for someone who&#39;s not very good at writing (yet?).&quot; As in, Even if you aren&#39;t very good, wouldn&#39;t it still be boring to write like this? Wouldn&#39;t you still have the insight to see the problem?<br><br>I think that maybe this author just got started writing one way, and kept going by momentum. I remember that once I established my Sue, it was a lot easier to keep her Sueish than it would&#39;ve been to reform her. And I was too invested in my story to step back and think, even though I knew it wasn&#39;t perfect.<br><br>Speaking of, I don&#39;t know if any of you would like to try PPCing an Animorphs fic, but if you do, go ahead and give me a shout. They&#39;re future AUs set about five years after the series ends, and the Sue is a girl named Emily who finds out she&#39;s the Ellimist&#39;s daughter. Yes, really. :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;d love to send Nume and Ilraen into an <i>Animorphs</i> crossover. I just haven&#39;t been able to find one that reeks sufficiently for my taste.

            <p>I&#39;ll tell you if I find something. Andalite culture interests me, too--they seem so advanced in some ways, so backward in others, and just plain different. The author did very well inventing them as a species--them and the Hork-Bajir. Hork-Bajir are wonderful because of their unique method of concentrating intelligence in &quot;seers&quot;, which creates a community that&#39;s nothing like what we&#39;d see on Earth, where geniuses are more like the extreme end of normal than a group apart. What if we had a very few people with an IQ of around 140, while everyone else&#39;s hovered around the 40s and 50s; can you imagine how odd a society ours would be if that were the case?<br><br>Anyways, yes. Will keep my eyes out for &quot;good&quot; Andalite-bashing fics for you to torture Ilraen with. :)</p>

            <p>Just messing with Ax, Elfangor, or even Aldrea would work for me (though I can&#39;t imagine there are many fics that even mention Aldrea). I know lots of people like Ax and Elfangor, so you&#39;d think there&#39;d be plenty of Sues for them, and therefore a percentage of crossover Sues. I just haven&#39;t seen &#39;em.<br><br>But yeah, Andalite culture is interesting. I gotta wonder how they managed to turn society back from an urban system and return to a less concentrated sorta-rural one, but without giving up on their technological advances. I kinda wish we could do that here on Earth.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I even had a plan to write out my OC, and even had plans to create another timeline based on what a fifth Marauder would do to change the future.<br><br>It <i>sucked</i>.<br><br>I never bothered to spell check, convinced I was already doing it right; I didn&#39;t check how to spell names in the books, certain I knew it already; at one point, someone called Purebloods &#39;bigamists&#39; instead of &#39;bigots&#39; because I didn&#39;t realize my vocabulary wasn&#39;t as impressive as I thought (and couldn&#39;t be bothered to check if I was right). And the 200+ reviews raving about my fic didn&#39;t exactly help.<br><br>The only special power I&#39;d given my OC was necessary for the plot to happen! She was a half-blood without a Trajek Past, her parents were happily married and loved her, and she was good at Defense Against the Dark Arts, sucked in Charms, and was average in everything else. She helped James practice Chasing but never tried out for the team herself. She doesn&#39;t sound like a Sue from this description, but when you get into the story itself, you start to notice none of the characters seem to have a life outside of her. The entire world exists to serve.<br><br>But I never thought for a second that my character was a Sue. I never gave urple descriptions of her hair, or eyes, or wardrobe. I made sure she didn&#39;t have a Trajek Past. I refused to let her be the best at everything. She was only distantly related to a canon character.<br><br>And yet, she was still a Sue.<br><br>In retrospect, I learned a lot about it, and I would have loved to see someone, anyone, come in and give me conceit, even if it had been in the form of a mission. I don&#39;t know when I realized my character was a Sue, but I&#39;m glad I did. That story is really what gave me the practice I needed to realize what was good and what wasn&#39;t (though nobody ever stops learning). I just wish I&#39;d realized my mistakes sooner.</p>

            <p>(For writing, not reading)<br><br>Most people are really pleased with themselves when they come up with a way to fix a problem - particularly when someone who&#39;s theoretically &#39;better&#39; than them is the one having the problem. It&#39;s one reason people watch quiz shows: to feel smug when they get the answers the contestants miss.<br><br>So think of a book you&#39;ve read or a film you&#39;ve watched where the characters had difficulties which <i>you</i> could see an easy way out of. For a concrete (and relevant!) example: the correct solution to the final part of the Triwizard Tournament in the <i>Goblet of Fire</i> movie is, quite clearly, to wait at the entrance for the other contestants to get out of sight, then pull out your wand and say &#39;Accio Goblet of Fire&#39;. There&#39;s nothing in the movie that would prevent it (restrictions on spell use, limits on the spell, etc), so it&#39;s totally what Harry should have done.<br><br>But just realising that, while it feels pretty good, isn&#39;t really enough. I mean, you don&#39;t want to brag, but surely all those people who&#39;re just accepting the film at face value <i>should</i> have noticed it - and didn&#39;t. You&#39;ve picked up on something most people missed; it&#39;s practically your <i>duty</i> to tell them about it. But you don&#39;t want to just say it, because that <i>would</i> be bragging.<br><br>But a story is different. You can write it into a story, and people will be really impressed by how well you solved the problem. So you create a fifth contestant (because we <i>know</i> the other four didn&#39;t get it), let&#39;s call her Iris Granger, and you have her win the TWT by exactly that means. What&#39;sisname never dies (and probably gets together with Iris out of sheer gratitude, though for that to work she&#39;ll need to be able to see the future, so let&#39;s do that too), Harry doesn&#39;t have to fight Voldemort, everybody wins. Only, wait, didn&#39;t Voldy get injured or something in that fight? We don&#39;t want to disrupt the rest of the story, so maybe Voldy should teleport to confront Iris after she gets the cup. And actually, I&#39;ve just had a great idea about how to easily beat <i>him...</i><br><br>And after all that thinking you&#39;ve done, and all that intricate plotting, and all the things you put in so as not to break the story, some asterisks over at the PBC Bored or whatever claim Iris is a Mary-Sue. The nerve of some people!<br><br>(It was guns, by the way. Guns kill Voldemort. But why did Iris have a gun? Hey, she can see the future...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The OFUs are an entirely separate concern to the PPC. We&#39;re all in the Canon Protection Initiative, but there&#39;s no overlap of responsibility.

            <p><i>I&#39;ve attended numerous writing panels at conventions and read many articles in which writers are told not to use adverbs with dialogue tags, and to keep dialogue tags simply &#39;said&#39;. I have always resented that advice, because I used to think it made some dialogue seem flat. But your comment about making the dialogue do the work gave me a small epiphany. It&#39;s the dialogue&#39;s job to convey the emotion, not the job of the dialogue tags. If the dialogue is flat without adverbial tags, then that&#39;s the fault of the writer for not writing more colorful dialogue.</i><br><br>That, right there.

            <p>Mostly because if I realize I&#39;ve read &#39;said&#39; twenty times in a row, it jars me out of the story. Not saying it&#39;s true, but it gives the impression that the author either had a fit of laziness or just couldn&#39;t think of something better to use.<br><br>Then again, you find those stories where the author seems to be allergic to &#39;said&#39; and you find all sorts of random dialogue tags, even when they don&#39;t fit. I once wrote a parody where I refused to use &#39;said&#39; and I ended up with the weirdest dialogue tags.<br><br>Besides, sometimes you do need dialogue tags to convey a certain emotion. <br><br><i>&quot;Look out!&quot; Jack said.</i> Well, if it&#39;s so important to look out, why are you saying it? Sure, the exclamation point suggests he&#39;s yelling, but when you see &#39;said&#39;, it just doesn&#39;t seem to fit. (Of course, that might just be my opinion talking.)<br><br><i>&quot;Look out!&quot; Jack yelled.</i> Here, it sounds like he&#39;s actually urgent.<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s my brain vomit for today.</p>

            <p>Honestly, said sounds a lot better to me in that example. There&#39;s nothing about the word said that would negate the intensity of the dialogue. Said is like a blank slate, it just means to make an utterance. Which could mean making an utterance of any sort, from what I gather.<br><br><i>&quot;Look out!&quot; John yelled</i> seems redundant because the reader likely already figured out that the character is probably yelling, then the author tells them they&#39;re yelling. This might feel to the reader like the author didn&#39;t trust then to figure it out on their own, like the article said.<br><br>But, personally I feel like that would actually be the best time to use a gesture to support the dialogue rather than an attribution. John is probably not just standing stock still. Is he reaching out a hand to pull his companion out of danger? Ducking so he doesn&#39;t get smacked in the face by the whatsit he is warning them about? I feel like a gesture would paint a much clearer picture.<br><br>Just my two cents (which may have turned into something more like a dime. Oops.).</p>

Commanded, decreed, protested, and waffled are much less so, and should be conveyed through the dialogue.

            <p>It would seem that since he hasn&#39;t gotten permission (or should that be Permission?) from the Tolkien Estate to make it, he is not allowed to sell it.

They&#39;re probably most known on the Internet for their Minecraft and GTA videos, but they cover plenty of other titles. Their <i>Rainbow Six</i> videos are particularly amusing.<br><br><b>BurningDogFace</b>: He covers a lot of videos, has a nice laid-back attitude, and doesn&#39;t get nearly enough views. He also gets a special mention as being the first LPer I ever watched, back when I was just a wee sprog.<br><br><b>Jesse Cox</b>: What I like most about Jesse is his attitude. He&#39;s got a good laugh and he clearly loves games. His meltdowns can also be fun to watch at times.<br><br><b>Super Best Friends</b>: Formerly Two Best Friends. It&#39;s all about the interplay between the four members. I&#39;m not a fan of several of the big titles they&#39;ve covered, but their banter is so good I don&#39;t care.<br><br>I feel I should also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PoorCynic">plug myself</a> here. While I do primarily iOS game and application reviews, I also have a few LPs in the works. I&#39;ve fallen a bit behind on them due to technical issues and Real Life demands, but I&#39;m still working on them.</p>

            <p>Well, let&#39;s see. I like:<br><br>- Markiplier (one of the few &quot;screaming&quot; let&#39;s players I like. You know the type. He is just so sincere with his fans, I have to admire him for that.)<br><br>- Gopher (One of the best role-playing personalities I have seen. He also has an amazing accent. I would recomend his Lets Play Skyrim Again or his Fallout New Vegas videos. Warning, however. He is a modder, he makes and uses a lot of mods for most of his games. If you like vanilla content, he is not for you.)<br><br>- Jesse Cox (Dude is close to the screaming type, but is more the super-freaking-silly type. Plus, he&#39;s on the Co Optional Podcast. I have to like him for that at least!)<br><br>- The Sw1tcher, otherwise known as Two Best Friends Play! (Like Game Grumps, but funnier, and usually more interesting.)<br><br>- Yogscast, specifically Duncan, Sips and Sjin.<br><br>Outside of Let&#39;s Play, I also follow TotalBiscut and Angry Joe for reviews and opinions. Boggie2988 is also good, though I have not been watching him as much recently.<br><br>Guys I used to watch:<br><br>- Tobuscus (I, too, was once 14.)<br><br>- Yogscast, Lewis and Simon (I don&#39;t hate them, but I don&#39;t love them as much as I used to. I would much rather watch Sips then the main two.)<br><br>- Game Grumps (No, not because Jon left. I just found myself overall bored while watching. Do I watch highlights of them? Yes. But I don&#39;t really watch all too much of them outside.)<br><br>-PewDie-- Nope, stopping right there. Only playthrough I liked with this guy was Last of Us, and that is because he shut up and played the freaking game. He was not screaming as much, not being near as abnoxious as usual. If you like Pewds, fine. But I can&#39;t sit through almost anything he does.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t watch that many, to be honest, but I really like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Marbozir">Marbozir</a>. His Long War LP was fantastic, but his Civ V content is just wonderful - and he plays as modded Civs too!

            <p>I forgot my four other favourites.<br><br>Somehow.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Northernlion">Northernlion</a> is not just a Let&#39;s Player - with his Let&#39;s Look At series, he shines a light on interesting low-budget indie titles that might otherwise be lost to history and not get the audience they deserve. For this, and quite a lot else, I respect him immensely. That said, I mainly watch his content for <i>The Binding Of Isaac</i>, a series which (assuming you add in the Rebirth stuff) clocks in at... well, I&#39;ll let <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj0fl3-VXwQ">this cartoon</a> explain it. (tw: suicide ref)<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Bisnap">Bisnap</a> is moderately well-known, but I follow him for his adventures in roguelikes and rogue-lites. Another LPer for whom TBOI forms the bread and butter of their channel, he&#39;s much better versed in the mechanics and so forth than Northernlion is, but not in a showoff-ish sort of way - it comes across that this wanting to scour all the game&#39;s secrets and know everything about it comes from an obvious love for the game, and it&#39;s one I can get behind. He also streams regularly, is an occasional speedrunner, and is actually really cute. And I&#39;m almost, but not quite, a lesbian. Take note.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ShinyRawrquaza">Shiny Rawrquaza</a> is, despite the name, not really a Pokeymanz player - my favourite of those, btw, is TheKingNappy - but is instead an expert in roguelite action-platformer shooty-jumpy-sci-fi-Native-American-allegory-&#39;em-up <i>Risk of Rain</i>. Indeed, it was through watching his series on it that I went out and bought the game. GO AND BUY RISK OF RAIN. EVEN IF YOU DON&#39;T LIKE ROGUELITES. BUY THE GAME. THEN BUY THE SOUNDTRACK AND BERATE ME FOR NOT MENTIONING THE SOUNDTRACK FIRST.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shenryyr2">Shenryyr</a> is another grand strategy player, but while I watch Marbs for his Civ 5 content, I watch Shen for his EU IV stuff. It&#39;s for a similar reason, too. Not only does he have a bucketload of experience and knowledge of the game, he&#39;s an engaging presence and brings a serious love of the game. Even when Senor Francy-pants is being a douche. Again. Dammit France, you&#39;re so OP in EU IV.</p>

            <p>Markiplier: I&#39;m fairly certain he&#39;s the reason for the explosive popularity of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s.<br><br>PinkKittyRose: A somewhat unique Let&#39;s Player, her commentary is usually given through subtitles, as she prefers to let the game&#39;s audio speak for itself. She mostly does challenge runs of classic or classic-style games.<br><br>RoahmMythril: Also does challenge runs. His main attraction is the Perfect Run series, where he plays through the classic Mega Man series, while taking no damage and using only the basic weapon. Uniquely for a challenge runner, he shows his failed runs to give you an actual idea of the game&#39;s difficulty.</p>

            <p>I got the element of the zodiac wrong. Well, like Western Astrology, the interplay between the elements and the animals of the year, compared with the element and animals at your birth year is the key of determining your luck.<br><br>You are most lucky when the element and the animal is an exact match, when you are sixty. So by that time, conquer the world, champ.<br><br>In Malaysia, the Chinese celebrate it most festively. Every other races and tribes take a day off, since it&#39;s a public holiday, and fulfills the invitation of their Chinese friends.<br><br>In unrelated topic, Chinese Calendar moves through the Gregorian Year. It does have corrective systems to counter the year difference. Every seven years, a month is doubled according to their rank. When seventh month is doubled, the Chinese feels some more chill down their spine than usual, since it means that the Hungry Ghost Festival is to be done twice.<br><br>I am not that knowledgeable of Chinese Calendars and customs, so I may get some things wrong.</p>

Feels like I am between adulthood  and childhood. Strange.<br><br>Anyway, I will not just have my birthday be about people providing e-gifts and congratulations, no sir! Later today, I will be starting a minor RP session. Nothing major, just a chance for agents to eat, drink, and talk to each other. However, it may or may not be the background for an interlude I have been writing. And a minorly interesting thing will happen there. Well, interesting for my agents. Completely normal for anybody else. You&#39;ll see.</p>

            <p>I try to collect on those space-miles, but the Robot Council has denied my claim every year! They even told me that if I were to try and bother them about it again, they would see me banished to Chiron Beta Prime! Ugh.<br><br>Meanwhile, buddy who lives on Europa?

            <p>Congratulations to your continued survival for an additional revolution around the sun! For this accomplishment, you receive a very special gift! It&#39;s time for another FANON PINKIE PIE PARTY!<br><br>What is a Fanon Pinkie Pie Party you may ask? What makes it any different from a regular Pinkie Pie Party? Well, I&#39;ll tell you!<br><br>As you probably know, the My Little Pony brand is made primarily for little girls. Unfortunately, this means Hasbro forces canon to restrain Pinkie&#39;s parties to those suitable for a five year old little girl. While this is all well and good for said five year olds, those much older then that can only find so much enjoyment from them that is not based on pure nostalgia.<br><br>Enter the Fanon Package, where we use a dash of Fanon and a drop of OOC to break the shackles enforced by corporate onto our favorite Party Pony. Now she can be the Super Duper Party Pony she was meant to be, and throw you the BEST PARTY EVER! Music, lights, snacks, party games, and quite simply the most delicious cake you will ever taste!<br><br>BUT WAIT, there&#39;s more! Pinkie Pie uses a mixture of her fourth-wall breaking abilities and a Remote Activator we managed to acquire to bring in ANY CANONS YOU WANT! Just choose you location, provide a list of your favorite fandoms, and we provide the rest! Dance with the Doctor, shoot pinatas with Katniss Everdeen, even get to glomp without consequence!<br><br>By the end of the party, specially programed robots with Neuralyzers will sort out all of the canon mess left behind, so don&#39;t worry your little head over any damage to the continua. They will even neuralyze you, making the party seem like it never happened and that all you were doing was reading about this fantastic party! The robots even have time travel abilities, due to being based off of the T-1000, so you won&#39;t even notice the time difference! This is quite simply the best party you will never remember!<br><br><i>The next time you have a special event to celebrate, just remember: There Ain&#39;t No Party Like a Pinkie Pie Party!</i><br><br>[Man, this copy-pasta is working out brilliantly for me!]</p>

            <p>It&#39;s hard work, protecting the entirety of known reality. Sometimes, before you can get back to pushing back the Urple hordes, you need to take a moment for yourself and have a drink.<br><br>You find yourself with some free time, and have decided to spend it at Rudi&#39;s pub. The drink is flowing, the food served steaming hot, and various unofficial games are being played throughout the pub. How you chose to relax is your choice. It&#39;s <i>your</i> break, after all.<br><br>-------<br><br>Welcome to a very informal RP thread! No special events. No threat of Weeping Angles in HQ. Not a single Sue to be found (excepting reformed Sue agents, naturally). Just walk in, have a drink, and talk to your fellow agents. There are a few ground rules:<br><br><b>1. NO MAJOR EVENTS</b><br>This is an opportunity for agents to interact and relax after a long day of Sue Slaying. This means, no surprise Sues, no agents snapping and going Flamethrower Crazy, no bar fights. You should get the idea. This is a peaceful RP. If you want agents to organize a game of blackjack or a dance off or something, go for it. Just, nothing violent that would be overly distracting for the other patrons.<br><br><b>2. YOUR AGENTS CAN AND WILL BE REFERENCED</b><br>This RP is going to be the background for a Marvin and Printworthy interlude I am writing. By participating in this thread, you grant me permission to reference your agents and their activities in the interlude. They will not be directly used by me unless I have one of the characters in the interlude interact with you in the RP. Because of this...<br><br><b>3. FEEL FREE TO PARTICIPATE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION, JUST INFORM ME</b><br>In RPs, you are always allowed to have unofficial agents. Interludes, however, are another thing. <i>If you do not have Permission, please mark somewhere in your first post with the unofficial agents that you do not yet have permission.</i> All this means is that your agents will not be referenced in the interlude (though their actions might, depending). Otherwise, do whatever you want.<br><br><b>4. BE RESPECTFUL</b><br>This goes without saying. Respect your fellow PPCers, please. Agents can be insulting if they want, though. Just make sure its in character, fellas. ;)<br><br><b>5. HAVE SOME FUN!</b><br>This is a pub! Laugh, joke, make merry! Just have some fun, darn it!<br><br>That should be it for the rules. When the interlude is finished, I&#39;ll post it both on the board and here. After that, feel free to react in-character to the things that happen in the interlude.</p>

            <p>&quot;Not quite. The show, <i>Doctor Who</i>, is about a renegade Time Lord who travels in a TARDIS— Time And Relative Dimensions In Space, basically a time-traveling spaceship— that takes the shape of a blue police box. I really suggest you guys check it out.&quot; Rina readjusted her goggles. &quot;Anyway, Time Lords can do this thing where when they&#39;d normally die, they regenerate into a new body.

            <p>The older ghoul was obviously not happy with his sheepishly-grinning partner, who was wearing a tea cozy on his head...for some reason. <br><br>Gurgan rubbed his one good eye tiredly and desperately wished that he hadn&#39;t left his cigarettes back in the RC. <br><br>Sure, they hadn&#39;t done many - or any - missions for a while, but still Derwin managed to grey what little hair he had left. <br><br>Derwin took off his tea cozy and sat down at a booth. &quot;Um...where are we, boss?&quot; he asked, looking around. <br><br>Gurgan growled at his partner curtly and propped his boot-clad feet up onto the table, finally relaxing a bit. &quot;Bar. You got off your pills and started up the Mini Poker Tournament again. I shoved your pills down your throat and dragged you here.&quot; <br><br>Derwin nodded cheerfully. &quot;Oh!...How much did I win?&quot; he asked before starting to pick his very large, very shiny sharp teeth with a switchblade he takes out from his pockets. &quot;...And why is there a feather in my teeth?&quot;<br><br>Gurgan sighed. &quot;Trust me, you&#39;re better off not knowing.&quot; He turned his head to yell at the bartender. &quot;Hey, smoothskin!&quot; he barked. &quot;Scotch. And lots of it. For him, decaff coffee.&quot; He jerked his thumb at Derwin, who was still pulling feathers out of his razor-sharp, solid-steel dentures. </p>

Reminds me of Gotham,&quot; Shawn said, pretending to wipe a tear from his eye.<br><br>&quot;That somebody also took out Rose Potter, one of the biggest, meanest legendary badfics out there. And if we don&#39;t get back, they might assign us something just as bad,&quot; Jack said, grabbing one of the many copies of the Multiverse Monitor that had been left on the bar.<br><br>&quot;Neat. Whoever it is, we ought to send them a thank you card. Why don&#39;t I sit here, and think about what to write in it?&quot; Shawn said, turning back to the bar.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re not leaving, are you?&quot; Jack asked, sitting down next to Shawn.<br><br>&quot;To deal with whatever nasty thing they throw our way first? Not a chance,&quot; Shawn said, scavenging for an unattended drink.<br><br>&quot;Fine. I&#39;m going to need to be drunk to deal with whatever this brings on our heads,&quot; Jack said.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s the spirit! Speaking of spirits, I&#39;m going to find the barkeep.

You&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Before she could ask, he produced a small rectangular object wrapped in aluminum foil from his pocket. &quot;I remembered your chocolate. Here. Now don&#39;t just eat it - I brought you here to meet people.&quot;<br><br>Emma swallowed her mouthful of the chocolate, specially made so as to include Bleeeprin in the recipe. &quot;Thanks, Asher.

Though that might actually be related to the &quot;I&#39;ve seen things&quot; look on his face.<br><br>The spy sat at a nearby table, took a quick look at the menu, and ordered a &quot;I&#39;ll take a glass of Bleepolate milk with a straw, please.&quot; (Whoever made the menu assumed at least some of the Agents who needed that would be too traumatised to do anything but repeat what they were reading, and they decided it would be better if they were at least somewhat polite.)<br><br>Once his order had been taken, he silently stared into the distance while combing his hair with his fingers. A few hair strands fell on the ground, along with a small beige feather.</p>

            <p>Klingons normally didn&#39;t slump, but Kozar felt he was entitled to a bit of slumping after completing two missions in a row and arguing with his partner over methods. He was nursing a pint of something that looked vaguely like Romulan Ale and tasted annoyingly like raspberries. He never could understand why aliens flavored their drinks so strangely.<br><br>His thoughts turned back to the argument, and he scowled. Let the Reader go try to assimilate into canon again if she wanted to so badly. She&#39;d been talking about it more often than he&#39;d like, considering she was his partner. He&#39;d been getting used to her at last, and she wanted to leave? Well, then, <i>let her</i>. It wasn&#39;t like he cared what she did, so long as it included her job.<br><br>He missed Allison, was the problem. Why all his partners tended to be aliens, he had no idea, but Allison was the one he&#39;d grown closest to, had trusted and respected far more than he did the Reader--not to mention the one before Allison, who had gone behind his back to acquire a <i>parasite</i>.<br><br>He grimaced at the thought of the tribble. Like any Klingon, he detested the creatures. Living with one in his RC had been horrible; the only thing that had stopped him from poisoning the creature was that Dawn had actually seemed prepared to protect it with the flamethrower she kept in one of the RC&#39;s corners. A knife he could handle; a flamethrower, however, was far more difficult to redirect, and he didn&#39;t really have a strong desire to find out how good her aim was with it. Better safe than sorry, and wasn&#39;t that an odd thought for a Klingon?<br><br>He took another swig of the raspberry-Romulan(ish) Ale, and grimaced. Glancing up prompted another grimace; it seemed he was about to have company.<br><br>Fantastic, he thought, and put the pint down. What was he about to be subjected to?<br><br>Well, he continued, that would probably depend on who it was who wanted to talk to him...</p>

Why don&#39;t you find a table for us?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fine, but I&#39;m sitting on the table this time. Last time I sat in a chair, someone else decided to sit on me!&quot; And with that, Kalen took off, fluttering between patrons and finally finding a table that looked promising: the only occupant was a Klingon. Kalen liked Klingons; they knew how to fight. &quot;Hey, you there,&quot; he called, flying up in the Klingon&#39;s face so he could be heard over the babble of Rudi&#39;s. &quot;Mind if my partner and I sit here? She&#39;s the seven-foot, horned, blue babe over there,&quot; he said, jabbing a thumb at the agent in question.<br><br><br>((Decided to take these guys out for a test run before writing a mission with them!

            <p>It had been a long day. As C.J. sat and waited to place an order, his thoughts turned to recent events - namely, the demise of a Legendary Badfic.  This would normally be something to celebrate, but when C.J. heard the news and recognized the name of the injured agent, he felt he had to do something. He didn&#39;t know what, though - so he came to Rudi&#39;s in hope of inspiration. Perhaps he could find an answer or two at the bottom of a Wonka Fizzy Lifting Drink.</p>

            <p>&quot;Hello, Apollo and Kelly. I&#39;m C.J.,&quot; he said, turning his head to address each of them as he said their name. &quot;I couldn&#39;t help but notice you mentioned this was your normal booth. I did not realize that it was claimed. I&#39;d be happy to relocate, but as you can see...&quot; he explained as he gestured towards a rope connecting him to the seat, &quot;...I&#39;ve had to tie myself down to counteract the effects of these Lifting Drinks. Untying myself would cause me to float into the ceiling. Sorry for any inconvenience. Anyway, if you don&#39;t mind me asking, what brings you to Rudi&#39;s?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;It&#39;s no real problem, this is only our third time here&quot;<br>&quot;Second&quot; Apollo corrected, not that he had time to say much more before Kelly started off again. <br>&quot;Whatever, so last time we were here no-one else was in the booth, and no-one tried to claim it, and we were here for a long time.&quot;<br>&quot;Two hours, fifteen minutes and twenty three seconds&quot; Apollo interjected quietly.<br>&quot;Yeah, something like that.&quot; Kelly agreed, &quot;And that was right before our first mission, which we&#39;ve just come back from and is the reason we&#39;re here.&quot;<br>&quot;I apparantly &#39;stole&#39; her shot&quot; Apollo explained, &quot;We&#39;re both exceptional archers so the &#39;person who hits the bullseye with the least amount of arrows contest&#39; was a draw, so we decided on a more peaceful challenge, whoever does something stupid, sorry exceptionally stupid&quot; Apollo smirked at Kelly who glared at him as a reply &quot;under the influence of any of the drinks from here loses and has to apologise to the winner. And if neither of us &#39;lose&#39; then we should have calmed down by the time we exit here.&quot;<br>&quot;And probably have another mission waiting for us.&quot; Kelly interjected this time, before swiftly changing the topic of the conversation. &quot;So why are you here alone C.J. you out of a partner or something?&quot;</p>

            <p>C.J. gave a small smile. &quot;I&#39;ve always liked bows - very elegant, takes more skill than a gun. I prefer throwing weapons myself. Anyway, to answer your question...&quot; The smile faded from his face. &quot;No, it&#39;s not because I lack a partner. He&#39;s a warlock from Azeroth. You know, World of Warcraft? Technically he&#39;s me, but... never mind, it&#39;s a long story. I&#39;m here because I&#39;m trying to think of a way to reach out to someone I haven&#39;t seen in a long time. We knew each other back in World One, you see, and it turns out that we both arrived in HQ.&quot;<br>He took a moment to consider his words before continuing. &quot;Normally, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue. However... I&#39;ve just heard that this person was injured, very badly. You understand if I don&#39;t say who... I don&#39;t know what condition they&#39;re in and I don&#39;t want to have people trying to go ask questions. I&#39;m trying to figure out how to reach out without infringing privacy, y&#39;know?&quot;</p>

            <p>The only thing left in the place was the gentle hum of fridges with slightly dodgy wiring and the occasional flap of paper turning over. Why paper? Well, that was rather the fault of the woman in the corner, far away, where she felt she belonged. Out of sight, out of mind, and all that.<br><br>The Notary was very thorough with her work. Everything was laid out to fit the entirety of the table as if with a set of dividers and a slide rule, which (handily for a narrator) was exactly what had happened. The table itself had been covered with a tarpaulin that smelled faintly of soap, so that no spills could occur. There was a potted bonsai tree that occasionally emitted blasts of acrid grey smoke in the corner, and a picture of two women in an extremely expensive frame that was rather at odds with the cheap, faded, beaten-up photo inside it.<br><br>The Notary reached a conclusion, her fountain pen delicately tracing patterns of geometric circles that contained her reasoning. If other people didn&#39;t speak High Gallifreyan, that was their problem, as far as she was concerned. She reached for the tumbler of amasec by the side of her desk and frowned upon realising it was a tumbler of air and slightly smudged dark lipstick. With a sigh, she rose gracefully to her feet and glided across the floor to the bar. It took her a few minutes to get another glass, mostly because the Notary was only able to pay by sorting out and refiling the establishment&#39;s library of order forms, but she was soon sated. The entire thing had taken place in complete silence. And so she worked, far away, out of sight, out of mind.<br><br>The barman only remembered she <i>could</i> speak after a few hours more work, so quiet he had to strain to hear it, as if she didn&#39;t even realise she was doing.<br><br>&quot;I let you down,&quot; she said, punctuated with the occasional hitched breath. &quot;I... I let everybody down, in the end.&quot;<br><br><i>Wonderful</i>, thought the barman, <i>another bloody maudlin drunk. Sensational.</i> He prepared himself to use Mop #7 - for some reason it worked really well on tears.<br><br>&quot;They hate me and they&#39;re right to,&quot; the Notary continued. &quot;You probably do as well.&quot; She fished in her satchel for another file and tapped out something on an old-fashioned desktop calculator. &quot;You&#39;re right to.&quot; The calculator beeped, and she swapped her fountain pen for one in red ink. &quot;You&#39;re right to,&quot; she repeated, almost under her breath.<br><br>File. Drink. File. Drink. Cross-reference. File. Drink. Glide over to the bar like she&#39;s on castors and do a little more filing for the bar. Rinse and repeat. Stay in the background, like the aftermath of the Big Bang. Interference. Noise. Useless.<br><br>The barman had tried to engage her in conversation precisely once, and had received a look so venomous it had practically burned a hole in the wall behind his head. That was a lesson well learned.<br><br>It took several more iterations of the cycle before the Notary reached into her bag and found no more files, no more forms. The bar was still empty. She had run out of things to do. She folded the tarpaulin neatly into a perfect square (again with the aid of her slide rule), put the bonsai tree back in her bag, and went over to sit at the bar.<br><br>This was when the serious drinking started, as indicated by her just tapping the bar&#39;s order book as the barman put it on the square of blue tarp. Elaborate circles filled the book as it was reorganized to within an inch of its life, and as long as you could speak High Gallifreyan it really was more efficient. She drank, and drank, and kept going until she ran out of book. Then she turned to look blearily at the cheap old Polaroid in the beautiful white-gold frame.<br><br>She stared at it for some time, reaching out with a slightly tremulous finger to stroke one of the faces. Then she set the frame face down on the square, finished her drink, and took her stuff back over to the corner, whereupon she just seemed to shut down completely, like her off switch had been flipped.<br><br>In winter, it was staff policy to put a blanket on her. It was getting on for spring now, so the barman didn&#39;t risk it. Instead, he just sat behind the bar and waited for more normal people to come in.</p>

            <p>He nervously scanned his suspiciously silent surroundings. Rudi&#39;s was normally a little more animated than this, right? He took a hesitant step forward. Nothing happened, so he took another step towards the bar. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a lady staring off into space over at a table at the back of the room. She wasn&#39;t moving. Gaspard nervously fiddled with his bowtie. Should he do something? This <i>could</i> be someone who had suffered a very silent heart attack or something. Alternatively, it could be a very tired and irritated agent who had managed to get away from her overbearing partner and was enjoying her free time by spending it in a mini-coma at Rudi&#39;s. <br><br>Gaspard looked at the bar, then at the lady again. He was hungry and thirsty... and besides, leaving her alone wouldn&#39;t do any harm. Right?<br><br>He sighed and very carefully approached the figure, watching it for movements. Best-case scenario: this was actually a mini-coma and he would&#39;ve helped. Worst-case scenario: he&#39;d get yelled at. <i>Bah. Worth the risk,</i> he thought. The Spy stopped when he was about three metres away from the lady&#39;s table. &quot;Er... excuse me.&quot; He waved a hand, trying to get her attention. &quot;Madame? Are you all right? Can I help you?&quot; he asked softly.</p>

            <p>This had been an awfully long day. He&#39;d been pummelled, shot at, burnt, defenestrated, thrown, and spat on by no less than four different Suvians that had fallen into HQ during his shift. Medical managed to wipe away the injuries but the weariness in his body remained. The Time Lord rubbed his eyes and focused on the bar across the room. He smacked his lips in anticipation. He&#39;d order some Cointreau for himself-- the usual. Thank goodness for Agent Desdendelle: otherwise he&#39;d be missing out on a taste experience.<br><br>He was halfway to the bar when the smell hit him. Time Lord. His eyes snapped open as he wildly looked around. He found the source of the smell: the Notary, sitting in her corner. No, never mind. He wasn&#39;t <i>that</i> desperate for a talk with one of his kind. The former soldier fixed his eyes back towards the bar and continued to limp forward. He passed a corpse-like man with a scorpion-centaur-<i>thing</i> seated at a table. The Guardsman suppressed a shudder when he looked at Kala. She looked a little too much like one of the many things that he killed/killed him way back then. He looked away from her. No need to stir up the bad memories if he could help it. As he made his way past the two, he overheard the man say: &quot;It ain&#39;t torture if they can&#39;t feel it.&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman slowly turned around and looked at Valon. &quot;What,&quot; he said in an icy tone, &quot;the <i>hell</i> is that kind of logic? Go on. Explain it to me.&quot;<br><br>- - - <br>((Is  Valon trying to be edgy here? He&#39;s creeping me out.))</p>

            <p>&quot;Ouch. Thankfully, nobody&#39;s touching Kimihito Kurusu. Though Valon says that in Monster Musume badfic, he tends to get swapped with someone else.

            <p>Rina shrugged and nodded. &quot;Um, sure, I guess...&quot; She scooted over to make room, wondering why these people wanted to sit at this table when there were so many empty ones in the bar. &quot;Do you guys know each other?&quot;</p>

He turned back to Rina. &quot;Pleased to meet you, Miss Dives. I assume that you&#39;re still getting used to the new body, right? How&#39;s that time-sense working out for you?&quot;<br><br>Just then, the Notary made a show of striding past the Guardsman. He  ignored her presence up until the point where she tripped and was wombo-combo&#39;ed by a bar stool and the floor. &quot;Hang on a minute,&quot; he said to Rina and crouched next to his fellow Time Lord. When she didn&#39;t move, he leaned towards her face and snapped his fingers over her ear. &quot;Hey, Antrilovorasilendar. Are you still with us?&quot; He pinched her ear, looking for a reaction. &quot;Come on, don&#39;t tell me you broke your neck on the way down. That&#39;s a pretty dumb way to waste a regeneration and you know it. Talk to me.&quot;<br><br>- - - <br><br>((<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD_imYhNoQ4">HAPPY FEET</a>))</p>

It wasn&#39;t your fault that you blew up like an atomic bomb once the kaiju started talking like in a cheesy 50&#39;s TV show!&quot;<br>Lapis gave his wing pinions a painful yank, and said, &quot;Did you hear what I just said?!&quot;<br>Cupid stopped talking, but rolled his eyes at her.<br>&quot;I owe you and Sarah for what happened, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can rub it in my face,&quot; said Lapis, before returning to Zeb. &quot;Anyway, yeah. Two missions. I&#39;ve been here for two years, but I was in the Nursery until sometime last week.&quot;<br>&quot;Wait... Percy Jackson?&quot; asked Cupid. &quot;Isn&#39;t that the book series about Greek mythology in a modern-day setting?&quot;<br>&quot;Yeah, my author loved those books as a kid!&quot; Lapis smiled. &quot;So, Zeb, how did that particular mission go? Which demigods did you get to meet?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;The only non-replaced characters we got to meet were Grover and Clarisse, sorry. It involved some OC son of Chaos who was a... what was the word, porn star? He took off almost all of his clothes to show off his target-print undergarments and my partner shot him in the rear. And then the entire camp tried to kill us, so we had to run for it.&quot;<br><br>Zeb glanced back at Rina&#39;s table, which seemed to be extremely crowded, then back at his current table mates. &quot;We ended up blowing up the camp with greek fire,&quot; he concluded.</p>

The first noticeable difference with the previous one was his long blond hair, and his quilted jacket sporting a Department of Intelligence flash patch.<br><br>You&#39;d usually expect a spy to be sneaky and quiet. Dom Irossi, however, most definitely wasn&#39;t.<br>He was currently talking --or rather, shouting-- to someone on the phone. Most of those who were around were unable to understand him, however, as he was speaking French.<br>Those who either spoke that language or had an universal translator, could understand this:<br><br>&quot;I <i>know</i> that movie was terrible! But it&#39;s canon, and if you try to &#39;fix&#39; it, we&#39;ll have to send someone to-- You want to do WHAT?&quot;<br>Suddenly realising he had practically screamed the last word, he looked around with a worried look on his face, and said in a much more quiet voice:<br>&quot;Uh, I&#39;m getting weird looks here. I&#39;ll call you back later. No canon genocide in the mean time. Bye.&quot;<br><br>Dom hung up and put the phone back in his pocket. He then said in English:<br>&quot;Uh, sorry... That was my brother. He really wants to help, but... Ah, forget it, it&#39;s not important.&quot;<br><br>He waited until everyone had diverted their attention from him; he then sat at an unoccupied table and ordered some tea.</p>

            <p>Case in point: about five minutes after Dom Irossi’s tea arrived at his table, a young man — he wasn’t exactly a teenager, but certainly not an adult — wearing a shabby brown longcoat and sporting a red-brown goatee approached the table.<br>“Do you mind if I sit here?

So! Pale man person. You haven&#39;t told me your name yet. Where are you from? Judging by the fact that you&#39;re trying to escape the crowds you don&#39;t really want to be here so... is your partner around?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;What is this place, brother?&quot; Velociripper asked anxiously, stepping into the pub after Falchion.<br>&quot;Rudi&#39;s pub,&quot; the Skarmory replied. &quot;Rashida told me she visits this place every once in a while to unwind. I&#39;m not sure why she&#39;d come here, but I guess it&#39;s worth a try.&quot;<br>&quot;If they sell Sue flesh, I&#39;ll definitely consider it.&quot;<br>&quot;They don&#39;t, sadly. But I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;ll be happy to provide a hadrosaur steak or two if you ask politely.&quot;<br>The two of them were just about to look for a table when they noticed a brown-haired angel in a pink toga sitting at the bar. He was halfway through his goblet of dark red drink when he turned to see the two of them, his blue eyes widening in surprise.<br>&quot;<i>Shinseina tawagoto!</i> IT&#39;S A DINOSAUR!&quot; he cried, immediately bolting for Ripper. &quot;I&#39;M GONNA *hic* WRASSLE IT!!!&quot;<br>Before the <i>Deinonychus</i> could respond, he&#39;d grabbed him by the neck and suplexed him. Ripper managed to roll over and try to throw him off, but Falchion was quicker.<br>The angel yelped as he felt a sharp peck in the backside, and his grip loosened just enough for the Skarmory to yank him off the raptor agent with one of his taloned feet.<br>&quot;Sorry, kid, but we don&#39;t wrestle other agents around these parts,&quot; he clucked in a mixture of embarrassment and amusement.<br>&quot;Oh, he&#39;s an agent too?&quot; the angel half-slurred. &quot;Sorry, I *hic* didn&#39;t know!&quot;<br>&quot;You wouldn&#39;t have,&quot; Falchion warbled cheekily.<br>&quot;It appears that I&#39;m not the only newcomer around here,&quot; Ripper snorted, detecting the faint scent of glitter from the angel who had just glomped him. &quot;What is your name?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;m Cupid!&quot; the angel said cheerfully, before hiccuping yet again. &quot;I just got recruited a little while ago, so I thought I&#39;d make myself known!&quot;<br>&quot;Throwing another agent across the pub isn&#39;t exactly how I&#39;d make a name for myself, honestly,&quot; Falchion laughed. &quot;But y&#39;know, no pressure. Anyway, why don&#39;t you bring your drinks over here and hang out with us?&quot;<br>&quot;What was that you were just drinking, anyway?&quot; asked Ripper as the two paravian agents (the term coming from the group of dinosaurs more closely related to modern birds than <i>Oviraptor</i>) took a table and looked through the menu.<br>&quot;Bleeport,&quot; Cupid replied cheerfully, picking up his goblet and bottle before heading over to their table. &quot;Bleeprin-laced synthetic fortified wine!&quot;<br>Falchion took one look at the angel, and warbled another laugh. &quot;This explains <i>so</i> much...&quot;</p>

            <p>((this is canon, BTW))<br>Ami watched the rambunctious angel bemusedly. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you seriously thought that guy was Pit,&quot; she remarked to their guest.<br><br>&quot;He looked the same! I was just as much of a Sue back then!&quot; she said defensively. &quot;Give me a break!&quot;<br><br>Miguel laughed quietly. &quot;Maybe when you stop being an easy target, Vi.&quot; He dealt ten white cards each to Chris, Ami, and the girl, before taking ten for himself. &quot;All right, gang. Ten rounds, no stalling, no whining, no card trades. Let&#39;s play. The first black card is...&quot; He turned over a black card, looked at it, and snickered. &quot;&#39;A new study shows that blank helps you live longer.&#39;&quot;<br><br>Ami looked at her hand carefully. She must have drawn some <i>really</i> strange cards, because she promptly put her hand next to her (empty) teacup and buried her face in her hooves. <br><br>&quot;Offended already, Ami?&quot; Chris chuckled. He passed a random white card to Miguel. &quot;Maybe we should play Apples to Apples next time.&quot; <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not my fault if they thought it was funny to put weird creepy things in this game,&quot; the pony replied without looking up.<br><br>Vi passed the card on her far right to Miguel. &quot;You&#39;re supposed to pick whatever you think is funniest,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ami shrugged. She concentrated, and a card on the left side teleported out of her hand and in front of Miguel. (Face down, of course.)<br><br>Miguel smiled at the girls. &quot;What have we got here...?&quot; He turned over Chris&#39; card. &quot;&#39;The Force.&#39; Well, you&#39;re not wrong.&quot; Ami&#39;s card. &quot;&#39;Necrophilia&#39;...?&quot; He ate half a bar of Bleepolate before turning over Vi&#39;s card. &quot;And &#39;YouTube&#39;. Chris, you get this round&#39;s Awesome Point and are now the Card Czar.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excellent,&quot; Chris said in his best Mr. Burns voice. He drew a white card and passed another to Ami and Vi, respectively. &quot;The next black card is...&quot; He turned it over. &quot;&#39;Where <i>does</i> Batman get all those toys?&#39;&quot;</p>

            <p>...and recognized V.R.&#39;s blonde hair and white wings almost immediately.<br>&quot;Hiiii, V.R.~!&quot; he said, waving at her. &quot;I really missed you! How&#39;s life, huh? Have you been assigned to a department yet?&quot;<br>Ripper looked around as well, and sniffed at the female angel. &quot;Apparently, this one is new. It might be better to just leave her and her pack alone.&quot;<br>&quot;What? But she&#39;s my girlfriend! Well, <i>was,</i> before I got exorcised and all. But well, yeah! That&#39;s her!&quot;<br>Ripper shrugged and turned to Ami. &quot;Falchion told me about you and Chris, horned mammal. I see you and your pack are playing some kind of... game, is that the proper term?&quot;</p>

            <p>Vi giggled awkwardly and waved back. &quot;There&#39;s a sentence I never thought I&#39;d say. I haven&#39;t been assigned yet; the Floating Hyacinth said she&#39;ll decide once my Glitter level is below 100.&quot; She discreetly passed a white card to Chris.<br><br>&quot;Not that we mind, you understand,&quot; Ami piped up. &quot;It&#39;s actually quite nice, having an angel around. She&#39;s a really good listener, for one thing. And have you tried her chocolate curry rice? It shouldn&#39;t possibly work, but somehow it tastes amazing!&quot;<br><br>Chris nodded. &quot;Darn right. By the way, Ami, pass a white card or forfeit this round.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, right.&quot; The pony sheepishly passed a white card to Chris, as did Miguel. &quot;Also, to answer your question, sir, that is the right word.&quot; (She would later wonder how in all the worlds a dinosaur had gotten into the PPC, and how she&#39;d brought herself to talk to it instead of running away.)<br><br>Chris turned over Miguel&#39;s white card. &quot;&#39;An argument with Richard Dawkins&#39;, I have no clue who that is...&quot; Vi&#39;s card. &quot;&#39;Red velvet cake&#39;...&quot; Ami&#39;s card. &quot;And &#39;A rip in the space-time continuum&#39;. Ami, you get the Awesome Point and Card Czar privileges.&quot;<br><br>Ami hoof-bumped Vi and magically distributed new white cards (as well as taking the black card). &quot;OK, next question...&#39;I heard blank and blank are going to be on Broadway!&#39;&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;...unless, of course, you happen to be weak and unfit for survival, and I don&#39;t believe that to be the case. I am Velociripper, by the way. I hail from the <i>Jurassic Park</i> continuum, and like your angel packmate, I too am recovering from my past life as a Gary Stu, albeit an antagonistic one in my original homefic.&quot;<br>&quot;Oooh, is that Cards Against Humanity?&quot; Cupid interjected. &quot;I love that game! Got room for one more?&quot;<br>Ripper let out a rasping noise that sounded like a chuckle, shaking his head with a toothy smirk. &quot;You are still a wandering lone male, Cupid. I don&#39;t think challenging a member of an existing pack would be a smart idea.&quot;<br>&quot;Oh come on, it&#39;s just a game!&quot; the angel insisted. &quot;It&#39;s not like there&#39;s gonna be any fighting for dominance or stuff like that. Anyway, what are your names? Aside from V.R., I mean!...&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I loved that movie as a kid! I&#39;m Miguel, by the way, nice to meet you. My horned friend over here is Ami--&quot; she waved at Cupid and Ripper &quot;--and the guy in the red hat is Chris. Cupid, we&#39;ll deal you in after this round.&quot; He passed Ami two white cards.<br><br>&quot;Jurassic Park...?&quot; Vi said thoughtfully. &quot;Isn&#39;t that the one where they resurrect dinosaurs from, like, ancient mosquito blood and then everything goes kablooey?&quot;<br><br>Miguel nodded. &quot;I have to wonder, though; since dinosaurs are-slash-were so dangerous, why don&#39;t newly-resurrected fossil Pokemon go all &#39;Dinosaur SMASH&#39; on their trainers?&quot;<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re only level five when resurrected, if I remember right,&quot; Chris pointed out, passing two random white cards to Ami. &quot;Also, two of the successes are unevolved. That only leaves Aerodactyl as a potential threat. And while I won&#39;t deny that Aerodactyl are scary, let me repeat: Level <i>five</i>.&quot;<br><br>Violet frowned at her hand, picked two at random, and handed them to Ami. &quot;...I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about, but okay. I&#39;ll roll with it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s see what we&#39;ve chosen,&quot; said Ami. She turned over Chris&#39; cards. &quot;&#39;A literal Dragon&#39; and &#39;Pink elephants&#39;. Oh, good grief.&quot; Violet&#39;s cards. &quot;&#39;Michael Keaton&#39; and &#39;Insect-like aliens&#39;? That sounds hilarious!&quot; Miguel&#39;s cards. &quot;And &#39;Kazoo serenades&#39; and &#39;All the people.&#39; Miguel, the Awesome Point goes to you.&quot;<br><br>Miguel smiled. &quot;Thanks, but...we&#39;ll need to start the game over now that Cupid&#39;s in. It wouldn&#39;t be fair to him otherwise, you see. Ami, would you...?&quot;<br><br>Ami&#39;s horn gained a blue aura. &quot;No problem, buddy.&quot; She levitated every single white and black card back to their respective decks before shuffling them. <br><br>Chris moved his chair to the left. &quot;Pull up a chair and sit with us, Cupid. You&#39;ve eaten, right?&quot;</p>

            <p>...Cupid cheered, earning odd looks from the others. He picked up his drinks and headed over to the seat they&#39;d opened up for him.<br>&quot;...Are you sure you&#39;re in the proper state to play?&quot; Ripper asked dubiously. &quot;I don&#39;t think you can handle Bleeport as well as you think you do.&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, come on! It&#39;s a synthetic alcohol substitute! What can possibly go wrong?&quot;<br>He sat down and put his Bleeport and goblet in front of him. &quot;Wanna join us, dino boy?&quot;<br>&quot;No thanks,&quot; the raptor replied, his clawed wings seeming to shrug. &quot;I&#39;d rather observe how this plays out. Though given that you&#39;ve chosen unwisely with the Bleeport, I have a feeling it will be... <i>fascinating...</i>&quot;<br>Ripper turned to the others. &quot;And as for the matter of fossil Pokemon, I&#39;m afraid that the continuum in question was not among the long list of worlds included in my homefic. And since I joined the PPC, I have been familiar primarily with the anime and not the games. I did spend some time as an Archeops on my first mission, however, which was an interesting experience. It&#39;s a shame that Randa had to leave Rina&#39;s pack after we finished the job, though.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Not too bad, considering we&#39;ve only killed two Sues so for,&quot; Ami replied. &quot;The hardest part about them is training Miguel and Violet, I think. Chris and I have read a lot of mission reports over HQ internet, but it&#39;s not the same as actual experience.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king&#39;,&quot; Violet remarked sagely. She passed Ami a white card. <br><br>Chris rolled his eyes indulgently at the angel girl. &quot;Metaphorical sight is irrelevant when you have to fight replacement legendaries and a demon,&quot; he pointed out. &quot;Honestly, we&#39;re lucky we had Miguel with us both those times or things would&#39;ve gone pear-shaped fast. Black Butler demons are so overpowered it&#39;s not even funny.&quot;<br><br>Miguel smiled gratefully. &quot;Happy to help, Chris. And of course they&#39;re better than the rest of us, they&#39;re supernatural beings.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s not wrong, you know,&quot; said Ami.<br><br>&quot;Not helping.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, Vi, random question.&quot; Chris passed Ami a card on the far left of his hand. &quot;Do you think your Aquarius Blade would help keep the minis in line?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmm...I hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; she said. &quot;I guess it would treat them like any other monster, but hopefully without the killing part. I put all my favorite powers on it before the last mission for extra oomph. Hope those guys are vulnerable to paralysis!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait, how does a blade made of water paralyze something?&quot; Miguel wondered. <br><br>&quot;The <i>blade</i> doesn&#39;t. The <i>charge shots</i> do,&quot; Violet clarified.<br><br>Miguel shrugged and passed Ami a card from the middle of his hand. &quot;Fair enough.&quot;<br><br>((Belated note: This RP takes place after my yet-to-be-written-and-released second mission. Details about said mission will be vague so I don&#39;t end up contradicting myself.))</p>

            <p>&quot;You have an Aquarius Blade?&quot; asked Cupid eagerly, taking a card from his own hand and passing it to Ami. &quot;Awesome! I&#39;ve got an Angel Bow myself, along with some Guardian Orbitars and a Ninja Palm. Though that <i>may</i> be because my abilities are inspired by Pit&#39;s <i>Smash Bros.</i> moveset and allow for more than one weapon. So, what do our cards say, huh?&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;ll pretend I understood what you said,&quot; Ripper said dryly. &quot;Because I honestly don&#39;t. Anyway, I&#39;ve had only one mission myself. Falchion took me into a Pokemon badfic, accompanied by Rina and Randa, and we spent the day stalking some rather... passionate replacements of the Team Rocket duo along with a duplicate of Gary Oak. Additionally, I have already told V.R. shortly afterward that I dealt with a pretentious replacement of Ash.&quot;<br>&quot;You... dealt with him?&quot; asked Cupid skeptically.<br>Ripper licked his chops wistfully. &quot;Correct. He made the best meat on the bone I ever had the fortune to have - and I am sure that he won&#39;t be missed.&quot;<br>The brown-haired angel scooted his chair away from him slightly, realizing what the feathered hunter had meant almost immediately.</p>

            <p>The slightly horrified silence from the rest of the table was palpable.<br><br>&quot;...Good to know,&quot; said Ami, looking slightly pale. &quot;Let&#39;s see what you guys chose.&quot; She turned over Miguel&#39;s card. &quot;&#39;Space Invaders&#39;? That just sounds weird.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, don&#39;t knock it till you try it,&quot; Violet cut in. &quot;I saw the machine for it over in the arcade area.

            <p>&quot;Though I honestly have no idea how an eight-minute mile would play a major role in a Disney princess movie... Didn&#39;t they stop making those, anyway?&quot;<br>&quot;Trust me, humans will never stop licensing merchandise that proves to be popular,&quot; Ripper chimed in. &quot;And I am honestly confused as to how you would find that combination humorous as well.

            <p>&quot;Maybe whoever the next one is will run track to keep her lovely hourglass figure. Ooo! And then she could save the day by running an eight-minute mile to the bad guys&#39; hideout and disable their secret weapon!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I want another princess who fights, personally,&quot; Miguel commented. &quot;The Internet loves ass-kicking women. Mulan, Zelda, Gamora, Annabeth, Clair--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Clair is evil incarnate and you know it,&quot; said Chris hotly. &quot;Jasmine is <i>much</i> better. She&#39;s kind, she&#39;s a good sport, she actually runs her city...&quot;<br><br>&quot;All you need to beat Jasmine is a Typhlosion and a Water-type with Surf,&quot; Miguel countered. &quot;It&#39;s like she wants you to win, seriously.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You take that back!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s true! And Olivine Gym is boring!&quot;<br><br>&quot;At least it and its leader don&#39;t give trainers Beasts-forsaken nightmares for a week!&quot;<br><br>Ami created a megaphone for herself. &quot;Okay!&quot; she said clearly. &quot;That&#39;s enough fanboying for one night.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not a fanboy!&quot; Chris and Miguel protested.<br><br>&quot;Whatever you are, arguing about it can wait until later,&quot; Ami declared, sounding remarkably like their mothers. &quot;Anyway, in light of Cupid&#39;s current state, Violet will be Card Czar this round.&quot;<br><br>Violet blinked in surprise. &quot;Uh...is that allowed? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s allowed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Vi, he&#39;s drunk off his perpetually-teenage angelic ass,&quot; Miguel deadpanned, drawing a new card (as did Chris and Ami). &quot;Do you <i>want</i> a drunk Card Czar?&quot;<br><br>The angel girl shivered, then drew another white card. &quot;Good point. OK, next black card...&quot; She turned one over. &quot;&#39;Even today, some people insist that we never visited blank.&#39;&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;You said earlier that you didn&#39;t see why an eight-minute mile in a Disney Princess movie was funny, so you must know at least the basics of Cards Against Humanity,&quot; said Miguel suspiciously. &quot;How do you go from that to asking if it&#39;s like bridge? What <i>is</i> bridge, anyway?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Probably what my mom did all day while I was traveling Johto,&quot; Chris deadpanned. He passed Violet a card from the middle of his hand. &quot;Besides buy stuff for me with the prize money I sent her, I mean.&quot;<br><br>Ami, who had been humming &quot;Winter Wrap-Up&quot; to herself to block out Cupid&#39;s...enthusiastic singing, passed the card farthest to her right and smiled at Chris. &quot;You sent your mom money? That&#39;s really sweet. I hope you get to meet her again someday.&quot;<br><br>He took his hat off and looked at the floor. &quot;...me too,&quot; he whispered.</p>

            <p>&quot;...sounds like something I honestly do not understand. Though that may be due to my mentality being different than that of a human.&quot;<br>The Deinonychus scratched behind his ear with his killing claw, watching Cupid finish his drunken song.<br>&quot;I&#39;ve never had a mom,&quot; the angel admitted. &quot;Lady Palutena created me...&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#39;t think that was the case,&quot; Ripper replied. &quot;You were an author-wraith given a physical form, at least from what Rashida told me about you.&quot;<br>&quot;And you&#39;re a skinny dinosaur,&quot; the angel replied before hiccuping again. &quot;You don&#39;t plan to eat us, right?&quot;<br>&quot;The Flowers would have me executed if I dared,&quot; the raptor replied honestly. &quot;Getting back to your question about bridge, Miguel, it is a popular team-based card game in which each two-player team bids on a particular card arrangement in each turn. My handlers used to play that game when I was younger, but I haven&#39;t participated in it myself. I would like to, however.&quot;<br>Cupid picked a card. &quot;So, what do our cards say, huh?&quot; he asked. &quot;Oooh, and can Ripper play?&quot;<br>&quot;We&#39;d have to start over <i>again</i> if that was the case, apparently. In case you&#39;ve forgotten, that happened when you joined in.&quot;</p>

            <p>...a yellow blur, then something white and yellow slammed violently into one of the table&#39;s legs. There came another quick scuffling noise before a Jolteon wearing a K9-style ballistic vest propped himself up at table-level with its front paws, knocking away a stack of paper towels and the saltshaker. The Lighting Pokйmon locked eyes with the Luxray.<br><br>&quot;Hey!&quot; it squeaked though its collar-mounted Universal Translator. &quot;You&#39;re a Pokйmon! I&#39;m a Pokйmon too! There aren&#39;t many of us here! You should eat with us!&quot; It craned its head towards a table occupied by a man slumped over a bowl of soup and a Lucario daintily snacking on some Pokй puffs. A Skiddo laid by by the man&#39;s feet, sleepily munching on some salad. &quot;Wait... Where&#39;s Victoria? She was there a second ago,&quot; said the Jolteon. &quot;Let me call her. VICTORIAAAAAA--&quot;<br><br>Almost instantly after the  little yellow Pokйmon started yelling, a Gardevoir-- also clad in body armour-- appeared next to the Jolteon and yanked its away from the table by its armour&#39;s carrying handle. As she tried to hold back her overly-excited partner, she stuttered some excuses in the Pokйmon language while avoiding eye contact with the table&#39;s occupants. After a few moments of struggle, the Jolteon broke free from Victoria&#39;s grip and propped himself on the table again, this time closer to Zeb. &quot;Hey, so whaddya say? Wanna join the cool kids for lun--URK!&quot;<br><br>This time, the Jolteon had been pulled away by a human-- a tall bespectacled brown-haired man with green eyes. &quot;That&#39;s enough, Maxwell. Go back to the table now.&quot; <br><br>&quot;But Beeeeeeen... It&#39;s a real life Luxray!&quot; whined Maxwell. &quot;Maybe he wants to--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe he wants to eat in peace,&quot; replied the man. &quot;Now go.&quot;<br><br>The Jolteon harrumphed and skulked back towards the table occupied by the other Pokйmon. Meanwhile, the man turned back to the table. &quot;Hey guys, sorry about that. Er, Maxwell hasn&#39;t broken anything, right...? No? Oh, good. Uh... gosh this is awkward. Sorry again.&quot;<br><br><br></p>

            <p>...as he saw the Luxray approaching the table, followed by Victoria and her trainer. He dashed over to Zeb and started prancing around him. &quot;Hey! Hey! You made it! Yeah, this way to the cool kid&#39;s table! Over there we have Owen,&quot; Maxwell nodded towards the seated Lucario, who was now sizing up Zeb the same way a hunter would size up a deer in his crosshairs, &quot;do not make eye contact with him, thank you, and under here we have Buck. Say hi, Buck!&quot;<br><br>The Skiddo blearily opened its eyes, saw Maxwell, and closed his eyes again. &quot;Bккк.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Close enough. You&#39;ve already met Vicky,&quot; continued Maxwell as the Gardevoir regained her seat, &quot;and I&#39;m Maxwell. Oh yeah, and that&#39;s my trainer Ben. Say hi, Ben!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ben&quot; stopped in his tracks and scowled at Maxwell. &quot;Look Max, I know you&#39;re happy to see other &#39;mons here but you <i>have</i> to remember your manners.&quot; The man looked at the DMS agent and had out his hand. &quot;Sorry for the disturbance, Assassin. I&#39;ve been trying since forever to get his little hopped-up caffeine addict to sit still. I&#39;m Benoоt Proulx, Internal Affairs. I&#39;ve got a partner, Meryem, but she&#39;s filing a report at the office right now. So, uh... what&#39;s your name, mate?&quot;</p>

            <p>The Luxray bowed his head to the trainer. &quot;Pleasure to meet all of you. And I don&#39;t mind, really,&quot; he said, nodding at Maxwell. &quot;It&#39;s almost a relief to see some energy around here.&quot; He shifted nervously, looking everywhere but the Lucario. &quot;So...&quot; He cast about for a topic. &quot;Um...&quot; If he&#39;d been human, sweat would be beading on his brow. As it was, his thick mane suddenly felt very hot. &quot;How is everyone?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;It&#39;s been a rather long day, friend. Personally, I&#39;d rather not talk about it--&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s because he fell chest-first into a bear trap,&quot; whispered Maxwell to Zeb.<br><br>&quot;While shutting down an illegal Shaymin cloning-slash-breeding operation that was hidden in the Courtyard,&quot; continued the DIA officer, rubbing his eyes. &quot;But yeah. Owen and Victoria just had their Universal Translators fried by one of Maxwell&#39;s Thunder Waves--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Without which the bad guys would&#39;ve gotten away,&quot; added Maxwell again.<br><br>&quot;--so that means we have to either bring them to that crazy Time Lord the next time I see him or go to the DoSAT, whichever comes first. Oh yeah, and Meryem still needs to swing by the armoury and get her old SMG traded in for a newer one. Thanks for reminding me,&quot; said Benoоt as he pulled a notepad from his ballistic vest&#39;s pocket and scribbled down a note.<br><br>Owen finished his Pokй puff and stared at Zeb over steepled paws. &quot;So, how long have you been here, rookie?&quot; he asked in the Pokйmon language. &quot;And relax. Your Aura positively <i>reeks</i> of fear.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I— I&#39;ve only been here a few days,&quot; he mumbled, his ears flattening. Despite the Lucario&#39;s words, he felt anything but calm. &quot;It&#39;s been, uh, interesting.

            <p>Maxwell shook himself like a wet dog as his fur stood on end. &quot;Thanks for the amperage, Z-man. I needed the pick-me-up.&quot;<br><br>Benoоt and Owen, on the other hand, noticed Zeb&#39;s sudden recoiling motion. The Lucario sensed some memories through the Luxray&#39;s panic-tinged Aura: a flash of light, an almighty roar, and pain. Benoоt, as an aspiring Ranger, recognized a fearful &#39;mon when he saw one. The two shared a knowing look and turned to Zeb again. <br><br>&quot;Rookie, calm yourself. Ain&#39;t nobody gonna try and hurt you here,&quot; said Owen. <br><br>Benoоt slipped a hand into his Bag of Holding and withdrew a Lum berry.

            <p>&quot;Nah, not a problem. All four of these guys came with me when I fell into HQ about... a year ago? Yeah, that seems about right.&quot; The DIA officer pointed at Buck. &quot;This guy here. First on the team. He&#39;s a gift from my parents who are a Pokйmon Breeders back home. I knew him ever since he was a kid-- he still hasn&#39;t grown much, has he? Truth be told, he isn&#39;t much one for fighting-- Owen, Victoria, and Maxwell are sent out more often than he is.&quot;<br><br>Benoоt pointed at Owen next. &quot;Second to arrive. Buck and I used to go Pokйmon hunting just east of our hometown. I had managed to save up enough money to buy two Great Balls and I was going to find me a rare &#39;mon and catch it. I spent three days fighting hordes of Litleos until he showed up. It was a big fight: Buck nearly got knocked out and I had to use both of my Great Balls to catch him. Over time the three of us became great friends and Owen evolved into a Lucario.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I met Victoria north of my hometown during a family picnic. Of course she was a Ralts back then and she just kept on following us no matter where we moved our stuff! Owen didn&#39;t do anything to stop her and Buck actually fell asleep with her at his side so I pretty much let her follow us home. She allowed herself to be primed to a Pokйball and we&#39;ve been travelling together ever since.&quot;<br><br>Maxwell dashed over to Benoоt&#39;s lap and stared up at his trainer. &quot;Me! Me! I&#39;m next!&quot;<br><br>The DIA officer scratched behind his Jolteon&#39;s ears. &quot;Ha! Of course you are, mate. I met this guy on Route 10. I was actively hunting for Pokйmon and he was the first to turn up. I later found a thunderstone in the grass nearby and evolved him into a Jolteon. He may be the biggest fool you ever set eyes on but this guy is the definition of a clutch player: he&#39;s got luck, attitude, and won&#39;t ever say &#39;die&#39;. Ain&#39;t that right, Maxwell?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah! Yeah! That&#39;s me!&quot; said Maxwell, grinning broadly. Owen flicked a piece of his last Pokй puff towards Maxwell, who leapt and twisted in midair to catch it in his mouth. <br><br>Benoоt smiled as Maxwell rushed over to Owen to try and beg for more food. &quot;So, what about you? Did you have a trainer or did you come from the wilds?&quot;<br><br></p>

Apparently, I actually came from a Pokйmon game my current partner once played. A... a Nuzlocke, I think she called it.&quot;<br><br>He took a deep breath. &quot;It&#39;s kind of funny, really. I can&#39;t remember much of my old trainer except her name. Bree. Other than that, nothing. It must be some kind of side effect of being the player character.&quot; He gave a small laugh.

            <p>&quot;I do know a lot about the Kalos region, though, as well as most of Pokemon X and Y in general - courtesy of a neat little thing called the Internet. I&#39;m Falchion, by the way.

            <p>&quot;Falchion? Oh, god. That means you&#39;re with <i>her</i>. Is it true that she... y&#39;know, killed an agent?

            <p>&quot;And yeah, that sourpuss is my partner, unfortunately. I don&#39;t know the specifics myself, but I did meet a friend of hers a while ago, and he was one of the witnesses. From what he told me, she didn&#39;t actually kill another agent - but she totally annihilated a character replacement who&#39;d done so.&quot;<br>The Skarmory let his head droop. &quot;Rosie never was the same after what happened, for all I know. She&#39;s been really shut in ever since I moved in with her. I can live with her guidance because she knows what she&#39;s doing, but my adopted sister had to transfer to another department because of a really bad argument with her a while back.&quot;<br>He sighed sadly, the memory of Sarah&#39;s departure still fresh in his head.

            <p>Benoоt sighed. &quot;Like I said, we busted a Shaymin cloning op in the Courtyard earlier today. A group of agents went into one of the Pokйmon films and took DNA samples from a load of Shaymin. They then dug a big underground hideout in some remote location of the Courtyard and got their hands on some cloning equipment.&quot; The DIA officer rubbed his eyes. &quot;These guys had made about a hundred artificially bred Legendaries and were trying to pass them off as another species of Pokйmon minis-- yours for twelve easy under-the-table payments. We got wind of the entire affair when one of our Patrol Division officers came into the office a few days ago with his new &#39;pet&#39; in his arms. An investigation was launched, the seller stopped for questioning, and a search party formed to find the clone lab.&quot; Benoоt took a sip of his ale. &quot;Meryem-- my partner-- my &#39;mons, and I are assigned the Courtyard beat so we started our search there. We found the place all right-- but the breeders had booby-trapped nearly all the entrances. Long story short: I fell into a bear trap, all hell broke loose, Maxwell went nuts with his Thunder Wave, two of the ten smugglers got away but we managed to shut down the lab and secured of all the cloned Legendaries. Not bad for a day&#39;s work.&quot;<br><br>Benoоt took another sip of his drink. &quot;Yeah, so that&#39;s my story. How about you? Got any good ones?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I mean, getting caught in a trap and being forced to watch all of that. At least there aren&#39;t gonna be any more cloned Shaymins, right?... right?...&quot;<br>Deciding he had nothing better to do, he flagged down the waiter who had taken the pizza order for Chris and Ami&#39;s table and requested some Unfezant Parmesan and a bowl of Mago Berries.<br>&quot;Funny you should ask,&quot; he said to Benoоt once the waiter had left. &quot;I think I just heard my new angel friend bring up my very first mission. Yeah, like he said, eleven different continua at once isn&#39;t my idea of a good time. But that&#39;s not all...&quot;<br>He looked around to make sure nobody was hearing, and then leaned his armored head in a little closer. &quot;My author was the one who wrote that guano-fest, though in his defense, it was a couple of years ago, and it took a lot of people calling him out on all the Tauros-dung he was producing over the years to get him to stop and think about what he was doing.&quot;<br>He sighed and preened his bladed wing. &quot;Too bad that didn&#39;t happen in time to save the badfic. The ending especially was just horrible - I mean, I had no idea it would end up becoming so gruesome. I&#39;ll never forget the sight of that one villainous character replacement getting torn to bits by the baby <i>T. rex</i>es from the third <i>Ice Age</i> movie.&quot;</p>

She was the most practical choice to help me out when Rosie got sent to medical due to a stress overload, and getting her to sign up was pretty easy compared to killing off a character replacement who could turn into a T. rex.&quot;<br>He went silent for a few moments, instantly regretting what he&#39;d just said...</p>

            <p>&quot;...into that one horrifying MLP fic involving a homicidal replacement of Big Mac. Again, Rayner was the one who was there and not me, but yeah. I guess that experience alone must&#39;ve been truly horrible if it led to Rosie deciding to call it quits for that department and find a safer place to lair in.&quot;<br>He paused again, wondering if he should just flag another waiter and get a cola right now. &quot;I wonder what happened to that Metamorphmagus Sue. Given her motives, I doubt there would have been any other option aside from killing her. Of course, that option was too risky for Rayner&#39;s current partner - you know, that Ficubus that got dropped on the Sunflora Official&#39;s bloom last year. Two-way life connection and whatnot.

            <p>&quot;And it&#39;s not the &#39;distract yourself&#39; tip that everyone seems to give around here. If you walk around HQ long enough, you&#39;ll find that there are patterns that start to emerge: elevators between floors are always at T-shaped intersections in the halls.

            <p>&quot;The more you notice the pattern, the more you move along only one of HQ&#39;s six dimensions,&quot; said Victoria. &quot;In other words, you just keep going around and around and around until you distract yourself.

            <p>Zeb resisted the urge to look away. &quot;I would like to learn how to read. Properly learn, I mean. It&#39;s probably a bad idea to rely on my Universal Translator all the time.&quot; <br><br>He thought for a moment. &quot;And I still haven&#39;t properly learned how to use my knives, now that I think about it, though the DoO might not cover that.&quot; He looked curiously at Victoria. &quot;Have you utilized their services before?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;But <i>some</i> of us have trouble actually showing up to class.&quot; The Gardevoir glowered at Maxwell, who smiled broadly. &quot;We learnt a good deal about basic reading, writing, and mathematics. It&#39;s absolutely worth it, trust me. As for combat training...&quot; she turned to Owen. The Lucario crossed his arms over his chest.<br><br>&quot;If you&#39;re looking for lessons on how to fight, go to the Department of Personnel and request the services of an Agent Trainer. Osbert is the best of the lot but considering you&#39;ve got the same amount of guts as a bacteria... Hm. Ask for Instructor Tansi. If you don&#39;t have the time for a full-on training program, then just swing by to DIA Central and ask to see me.&quot; Owen rubbed his paws together. &quot;It&#39;ll be my pleasure to turn you from a cowering pile of nerves into a finely-tuned killing machine.&quot;<br><br>Victoria stared at Owen in silence for a few seconds. &quot;You&#39;re absolutely ridiculous, you know that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;If you say so, madam.&quot;<br><br>Buck woke from his catnap again and rose his head. &quot;Uhh... question for Zeb. How exactly does a Universal Translator, uh, translate writing if you can&#39;t read? What do you see? Pictograms? Are the words beamed into your head or something?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;But not actually hear them... It&#39;s like I hear it in my head. It&#39;s very odd.&quot; Zeb thought about it for a second. &quot;Almost like telepathy, I suppose.&quot;<br><br>He smiled somewhat nervously at Owen. &quot;I&#39;ll, erm, think about the offer.&quot; He paused. &quot;Wait, they have agent trainers here? I was under the impression that there weren&#39;t; my partner told me when she and her old partner first started, they was simply told what each device did, and that they couldn&#39;t let the Sues see them, and to make a charge list.&quot; He shook his head in disbelief. &quot;Unless that is what the agent trainers do. Which, well, pardon me if I am rude, but that seems like a very poor way of preparing new agents for this job.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Besides, I think minimal training is the perfect way to prepare agents for the job.&quot; The Lucario smiled, exposing a row of sharp teeth. &quot;You either die ignominiously in the field or you prove your superiority over your quarry by ending its life. If you come back alive from your first missions then you&#39;re worth <i>something</i>, no? Trainers will then help you expand on that.&quot;<br><br>Buck laughed. &quot;He&#39;s being dramatic about it, Zeb. Trainers are available to anyone-- total newbies included. It&#39;s just that Upstairs doesn&#39;t tell them right away because there&#39;s a backlog of badfic to be killed. Besides, you can learn practically everything there is to know by sticking close to your partner. Er, ideally that partner should be more experienced than you... If you&#39;re both total newbies... Uh... Yeah.&quot;<br><br>Maxwell cocked his head and looked at the Luxray. &quot;Yo, Zeb. I&#39;m noticing that your eyes keep wandering to me.

            <p>Printworthy took a sip from his cider. &quot;Back when I was living in Equestia, I was the author of the Daring Do adventure seres. Ah, I see you have heard of it. Yes, well, back then, I had the extraordinary privilege to travel with several archeological teams across Equestia, and beyond, exploring ruins of ancient civilizations for inspiration for my novels.&quot; He sighed, taking a somewhat larger gulp of cider. &quot;Sadly, canon has since decided that&#39;s not who I am anymore. Now, I&#39;m just a writer.&quot;<br><br>Printworthy shook his head slightly, chuckling. &quot;However, I doubt you wanted to hear those stories. You were more interested in the stories involving Pinkie Pie, I am sure. Well, to be perfectly honest, there is not all too much to tell, really. I was in Ponyville one day for a book signing at the Golden Oaks Library. <br><br>&quot;The turnout was far higher than I ever anticipated, and I was comming off of a long night&#39;s worth of writing. I was dog tired, battling the urge to slump over on a limited edition of <i>Sapphire Stone</i> and let the inevitable chores of disappointed cries drift me to sleep. At that point the act of signing became a mere reflexive act. However, when I drug forward the next item to carve my signature into, I found myself scribbling on a gigantic pink mug! Startled, I looked up to see Pinkie Pie. &#39;You look like you need this,&#39; she said, nudging the mug ever closer. &#39;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s on the house. Gummy&#39;s special blend!&quot; Before I could say a word in thanks, off she went, bouncing around the library from pony to pony!&quot;<br><br>Printworthy laughed. &quot;Most of our interactions were like that. Short, yet strange little interactions that brought me immense joy.&quot;<br><br>Printworthy smiled towards Rina, slyly. &quot;Are you sure you told Alex everything? Including from our last mission?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Never heard of The Culture. I have heard of Nanoha, but when I asked Valon about it, he said he&#39;d never seen it. Anyway, I&#39;m from Monster Musume, and Valon says he&#39;s from World One.&quot; She snapped her pincers a few times. &quot;I actually don&#39;t know too many continua. Valon&#39;s the canon expert, and he knows just about everything within the canons he is familiar with. I really only know Metal Gear, and that only because my world&#39;s author is a huge fan, so Valon thought I should learn.&quot;<br><br>(OOC: I don&#39;t know how to do formatting like italics in this interface...)</p>

            <p>&quot;I can guess. A lot of liminals from my world have traits of animals they resemble. The author does a lot of biology research for the manga, and it&#39;s very accurate. Did you know, for instance, that carnivores have less sensitive taste buds than humans, and herbivores more sensitive? The lamia character has no sense of taste, while the centaur goes into &#39;I can&#39;t stop eating&#39; mode for carrots.&quot;</p>

            <p>“Do I look like a biologist to you?” he asked, amused. “I’m a soldier. I know how to perforate Stus with magic bullets, not how different species taste things.” He looked at his partner, who was still communicating via its effector. “Amris could, probably, tell you a lot more about that despite lacking taste buds or, indeed, a mouth.”<br>“That said, you said you needed contacts?” Navare said, a serious expression on his face. “Both I and Amris pack quite a lot of firepower; in fact, we are going to be transferred to the Eclectic Subdivision of Advanced Species in a short while. If you two” — the mage shot Valon a look — “need help taking an over-powered Sue, drop us a call. We’re currently operating from RC 3^3.”<br></p>

            <p>&quot;Considering the Stu that Valon and I had to get rid of, help would be greatly appreciated. Apparently, he was a replacement of the main character from a game called Prototype. I got bored and dragged Valon here before I got too far in, but from what I understand, the main character is <i>canonically</i> a godplayer, and Valon said that he survived a nuke.&quot; <br><br>She waved her tail around as she recalled the Stu!Alex. &quot;Granted, judging from what Valon said during the mission, we did make use of his weaknesses to get rid of him.&quot; She looked at Navare, obviously very angry. &quot;You wanna know the worst part? The fic was a crossover, and the other continuum was <i>my home.</i>&quot;</p>

            <p>Kala&#39;s tail stopped moving. &quot;Valon said that my home continuum is probably the only one where I don&#39;t need a disguise, which gives me full access to my normal abilities. It&#39;s common for liminals to be stronger than humans, but I also have a paralytic stinger. Not that it would have helped in our last mission, Valon said that the Stu wouldn&#39;t have been affected.&quot; <br><br>She turned her attention to Amris. &quot;Have you ever been in a human disguise? If you have, is walking with two legs difficult? I&#39;m used to having twelve limbs, so I don&#39;t know what to expect from being eight short.&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve had some experience with programming and whatnot. I know how much work that must have been. Most work in that field still confuses me.  Still, I&#39;m taking my first programming class next year and I&#39;m planning on going into computer programming. Congratulations on such a great achievement.</p>

            <p>It is my pleasure to announce that the PPC New Year&#39;s Gift Exchange RP is complete, and I&#39;m compiling it into a document as we speak! Unfortunately, most of my beta-readers are busy with their own things, so I wonder if anyone would be willing to look over it for SPaG and stuff?<br><br>Additionally, I have a new mission ready (Hunger Games, only 11 pages), as well as a new interlude, but again, my usual beta readers are busy so... yeah.<br><br>My e-mail is skarmorysilver (at) gmail (dot) com, so feel free to send me a message if you&#39;re interested! :)</p>
