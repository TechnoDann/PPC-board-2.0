I know very little about Naruto, and eight out of the 12 MonMusu crossovers are with that series.<br><br>So. Could I request the aid of a Naruto canon expert?

            <p>I&#39;m working on a little thing, and I&#39;ve hit a bit of a snag, so I thought I&#39;d ask you guys to help out.<br><br>Can a character be replaced by giving them an uncanonical backstory? And additionally, can a replacement be possessed by a Sue-wraith? Like, say, if the replacement starts remembering memories that aren&#39;t canonical, could that be caused by a Sue-wraith or something implanting them into him or her rather than just part of their character?<br><br>I remember reading on the Wiki that replacement and possession are different from one another, but I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re mutually exclusive and can&#39;t happen at the same time...</p>

            <p>I mean, if you&#39;ve got a character replacement, it&#39;s essentially an original character pretending to be a canon character. There&#39;s nothing stopping it from being as uncanonical and illogical as any other bad OC. I dunno why it would need to be possessed as well.<br><br>The difference between regular OOCness, possession, and replacement is mostly a matter of degree, so whether or not an uncanonical backstory would create a character replacement depends on how OOC the character is. If they behave in the story how they likely would if they really had that backstory, that might not be bad at all—exploring that sort of thing could easily be the subject of a good AU. If it&#39;s so terribly written that their characterization doesn&#39;t even make sense with the altered backstory, that&#39;s another matter.<br><br>... I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m making sense, so let me know if I need to clarify what I&#39;m trying to say here. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

            <p>Like Voyd said, Florestan and Eusabius ran into a possessed Ike replacement in a Super Smash Bros fic, so at least doing both at once can be done. The replacement stated that the Sue-wraith used him as a tool, so maybe that could be the case with what I&#39;m doing as well.<br><br>What I was thinking was that the character replacement occurred when the character was given a new name and a backstory that&#39;s completely inconsistent with canon. I guess I&#39;ll have to spoil this to you guys in that case - my next solo mission concerns a Kid Icarus badfic (which I&#39;m pretty sure I linked on the Board a very long while ago) in which Pit was given a full name (Pit Edward White) and a backstory in which he was formerly a World One human who was murdered at the age of 13, and turned into an angel. Which doesn&#39;t make sense at all in context. There&#39;s a brief shot of him as a young angel in one of the animated shorts for Uprising, which implies that he was born an angel and not created from a dead person as the fic suggested.<br>As for the possession bit, in the original fic, Pit had his human memories suppressed for his own safety, and ended up having them restored to him later on. Until then, though, he got &quot;memory sick&quot; - and the results weren&#39;t pretty, to say the least. The idea I had in mind was that while the replacement of Pit was harmless even with the altered origin, the Sue-wraith would attempt to enforce OOC behavior anyway to progress the story, and the agents would have to get rid of it to restore order.<br><br>And speaking of which, is there anyone familiar with the Kid Icarus continuum who would like to beta-read this mission once I&#39;m done? Iximaz has agreed to help but she knows very little about it, so...</p>

            <p>That doesn&#39;t mean they were all good ideas. {= P<br><br>(And yes, full disclosure, I beta&#39;d that mission of Herr&#39;s, but that doesn&#39;t mean I agree with all of his choices. As I recall, he really wanted to recruit not!Ike <s>who hasn&#39;t turned up since</s> and introduce a shiny new kind of wraith <s>that will probably never be seen again</s>, so yeah.)<br><br>Anyway: the entire point of a character replacement is that the character is so incredibly OOC that it might as well be someone else entirely. It doesn&#39;t need a wraith to make it <i>more</i> OOC; that&#39;s redundant.<br><br>On the flip side, the entire point of Sue-wraiths is that they go after canon characters and force them to behave like Mary Sues. A non-canon character that behaves like a Mary Sue is simply a Mary Sue.<br><br>If what you want is to give your agents a heck of a mess to clean up, I&#39;d simply go with possession. Then they have to exorcise the poor guy <i>and</i> get rid of all his non-canon memories <i>and</i> any extra abilities he might&#39;ve picked up <i>and</i> mop up any other non-canon stuff that&#39;s been introduced to the continuum along the way, without any cathartic killing to let them blow off steam.

            <p>My motives were actually fairly similar to Herr Wozzeck&#39;s - I really want to recruit not!Pit, though I&#39;m not planning to introduce a new kind of author wraith like Herr did (to be fair, an Impetus miserablis did show up in one of Anneli, Xanthus, and Cindy&#39;s missions too). So I&#39;m probably going to go with him being a replacement. The problem is that I needed a way to distinguish him from canon!Pit, and I figured that recoloring his wings would be a good idea. What I was thinking was that the Sue-wraith possessing him and making him OOC would be indicated by his wings turning increasingly pink, and by the time the agents rescued him, the wings would be permanently stained. (I&#39;m not kidding when I say that I also considered explaining the recoloring by making the Sue-wraith venomous, but in hindsight I have a feeling that may not fly with some of the more experienced Boarders.)<br><br>If there&#39;s another way that I could recolor the replacement that would be more consistent with PPC lore, though, I could use that instead. Recoloring him after the fic has been killed specifically to distinguish him from canon!Pit feels like a bit of a cop-out, though, so something that could be feasibly integrated into the mission as a story element would be better for me personally.<br><br>Another idea I had prior to the whole possessed!replacement!character thing was that when the exorcism occurs, it splits the replacement in the same way that the original canonical character was split. The massively OOC characterization could break off into something that could be destroyed, and what&#39;s left is a &#39;blank slate&#39; character who could start from scratch. It&#39;s a bit like how Huinesoron accidentally wiped Not!Arwen&#39;s memory (and thus made her into her own character) in &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot;. In this case, Not!Pit would retain his origin story, but his behavior would be more consistent with it rather than what his homefic had stated originally.<br><br>Incidentally, I wonder if you&#39;re familiar enough with the Kid Icarus continuum to beta-read the mission once it&#39;s ready...</p>

            <p>You want to recruit Pit, but with slightly different coloration so you can pretend to not be recruiting a canon character.  In order to accomplish this, you want to have the character be possessed and, at the same time, a character replacement; two things that are functionally identical.  What I mean is, they are both methods of explaining the phenomenon of why a character is not behaving in-character.<br><br>This all strikes me as really complicated and unnecessary.  Let me illustrate what I mean:<br><br>You want to make fried chicken (not!Pit).  There are two good methods to make that happen; you either pan fry it (character replacement) or you deep fry it (possession).  Both methods will give you fried chicken that you can eat and enjoy.  However, you decide that in order to get the chicken the way you want it, you need to deep fry and pan fry.  That being the case, you will end up with over-cooked, burnt chicken that will be unpalatable. It just doesn&#39;t make any sense to do both methods together.  You get no added benefit, and quite possibly make the whole thing inedible.<br><br>Pick a method and simplify.<br><br>-Phobos, Zinc Saucier</p>

            <p>Spicy Angel Wings, anybody? XD But anyway, yeah, you&#39;re right about a Sue-wraith possessing a replacement being way too much. I&#39;ve ultimately decided to go with the replacement approach, without any Sue-wraiths involved.<br><br>Granted, the whole business about not!Pit being replaced *and* possessed didn&#39;t come up until quite late in the mission, and I got stuck before I could go any further than that discovery, which is why I took this to the Board in the first place. If I&#39;d gone ahead with doing both like Herr did with not!Ike, I don&#39;t think that would have gone over so well. The thing is, though, I haven&#39;t gotten to the point where the agents step in just yet, so it&#39;s not going to hurt very much to simply go in a different direction than what was originally planned. So yeah, pan-fried spicy angel wings it is, then.<br><br>Of course, this leaves the question of how to recolor him without making it sound cheap. A Sue-wraith can definitely change the physical characteristics of a person, as was the case with Cadmar, but I&#39;m not sure how to recolor a replacement in a similar way. I was thinking that Pit&#39;s OOC behavior was what caused his wings to change color, like an indicator of Sueness, but I&#39;m not sure how that would work out, because there was no mention of his wings changing color in the badfic itself. Maybe it&#39;s an unintended side-effect of the climactic exorcism?</p>

            <p>Other than, as Phobos suggested, so you can pretend you&#39;re not recruiting a canon character. You&#39;ve already mentioned <s>not!Arwen</s> Hypatia - she looks exactly like Arwen (and/or Luthien, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/8/PPC-Driftwood">depending on whether you ask Kaitlyn</a>), the difference is in her personality.

(Though, honestly, given that non-Dafydd Maglor was OOC levels of nice in his origin story, it&#39;s entirely possible Dafydd is just straight Maglor and no-one&#39;s ever noticed)<br><br>So why not just... leave him as he is? It lets you run gags about people recognising him in HQ, and about him running into problems on missions - in fact, I&#39;m having a hard time seeing a, y&#39;know, downside.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>To settle the question of possession or replacement, I&#39;ve ultimately decided to go with possession, since it does provide a bigger mess to clean up; however, instead of just getting rid of a Sue-wraith, I had the idea that Palutena, being the one who &quot;created&quot; Pit in the badfic, splits off &quot;Pit&quot; from the canon version in the same fashion as the Mirror of Truth creating Dark Pit in Uprising.<br><br>The biggest deciding factor in my decision to recolor the guy is that I wanted the canon characters to be able to distinguish &quot;Pit&quot; from Pit. One of the ideas I had was that Pit and Palutena both know about the PPC (which is based on the fact that both of them practically obliterate the fourth wall in Kid Icarus: Uprising, that and Palutena&#39;s a freaking goddess for crying out loud), and the plan was for &quot;Pit&quot; to encounter them again at a later time. What would Palutena think if she saw two Pits, rather than Pit and a Dark Pit-esque copy? As tempting as it is to use the jokes about &quot;Pit&quot; being mistaken for the real deal, I would prefer having Palutena be able to tell the difference right away, so she could change his wing color when she removes the AU version of Pit and makes him into his own character.<br><br>As you and Iximaz noted, though, the jokes related to &quot;Pit&quot; getting glomped would be a pretty interesting idea. I&#39;ve decided that only his wings would need to be changed - that way, we could compromise and have people still mistake him for Pit and ask if he had his wings dyed. XD</p>

            <p>The whole thing about recruitment was admittedly for Sarah&#39;s sake. While writing the mission, I slowly started to realize that it wouldn&#39;t be healthy for her to continue working with Rashida, since their personality differences would lead to nonstop violence and not many people would like that. Sarah needs an official RC and for that she needs a partner of her own, so I felt it would be best for her to be involved with him prior to being assigned.<br><br>When I first posted my bios for my first agents, they were originally planned to be in DIC prior to being moved to Floaters, so since both Sarah and not!Pit are from crossover fics it would make sense to put them there. I have a few crossovers I plan to spork, so it makes sense to have a team there. I will probably have to stop at three agent teams, though, since it would be better for me to not overload myself in terms of PPC stuff. <sup><sup>;</sup></sup></p>

            <p>Still, you don&#39;t need to change not!Pit&#39;s wing color, like you said; Palutena is a <i>goddess</i>, she can see beyond his appearence and reconigze him, even if he looks the same as Pit. Also, remember that upon joining the PPC, not!Pit will use different clothes, a different name, and like others have said before me, he will have a wildly different personality. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know what key shortcut sequence I did to post that, but I&#39;m not going to try it again anytime soon. What I meant to say was that I plan for the agents to split the replacement into two different entities: an AU version of Pit with the history specified in the fic whose character is built more realistically around it, and the OOC personality traits that can be destroyed. I may or may not structure it like an exorcism, but it&#39;s not exactly the same as banishing a Sue-wraith, that&#39;s a given.</p>

            <p>Do we need and/or want some?<br><br>On the one hand, while we have a pretty large number of PGs still in the PPC, very few of us are active on the Board. The last five or so Permission requests have all been answered by me (I think), for instance. And we&#39;ve all had the position a fairly long time, and been around for even longer - the &#39;youngest&#39; PG is Phobos, and hands up if you remember <i>him</i> joining. (The hands are rhetorical)<br><br>But on the other hand, there <i>aren&#39;t</i> many Permission Requests at the moment; I can easily stay on top of them by myself if I need to, and I know Nesh and Phobos at least will jump in if they see a need. And since the only role PGs have is granting Permission, it&#39;s not like we need an excess, or have a quota, or anything. We&#39;re not leaders or moderators, it&#39;s not a reward or mark of honour - it&#39;s a job that, right now, doesn&#39;t really need many people in it.<br><br>So I&#39;m pretty much on the fence as to whether it&#39;s desirable/necessary to vote in more. What do <i>you</i> think? Feel free to debate/argue/anything. Hopefully a vague community consensus will emerge as to what we should do/not do.<br><br>And to save space and time, if you think we <i>do</i> need new PGs, go ahead and nominate. Nominees should have been an active member of the PPC community for the last six months minimum, and should have Permission themselves. No self-nominations, please; and if you <i>get</i> nominated, please either accept or refuse the nomination. (And this isn&#39;t the place for voting; that&#39;ll be a later thread, if it turns out the community wants to go ahead with it)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Mostly because he&#39;s a darn good beta reader, and a great member of the community. What I could say, others have said much better.<br><br>...What?

            <p>The knight glanced up from the missive she was writing. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br><br>The dusty and disheveled messenger held up a scroll. &quot;The petition for aid!&quot; he cried. &quot;Sir Jumper has agreed to an alliance!&quot;<br><br>Lady Iximaz took the offered parchment and unfurled it, her brow furrowing as she read.<br><br>&quot;Excellent,&quot; she declared at last, letting go of the parchment and allowing it to roll up on its own. &quot;In the event that the Baron Huinesoron does not agree to peacefully cede some of his lands, Sir Jumper will be a great ally.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Of course, I hope it does not come to that.

Send word to the rest of the barons and the other would-be barons. I have yet to formally announce to them my desired lands.

Thanasius Ampelius is a prominent candidate, and he dwells in the heart of Ozerbord. The Lady Iximaz is making noises in our direction as well. The only one I don&#39;t fear will try to divide the Refuge is the Poor Cynick - but even is rumoured to have grand ideas.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The division of the realm is beyond our power,&quot; Kaitlyn reminded him gently. &quot;The Edict of Bast will be followed to the letter - and not an inch more.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know - I know.&quot; The Baron folded his arms across his chest and stared out into the darkening sky. &quot;But still, I fear the consequences - for the people, what few of them we have.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmm.&quot; Kaitlyn turned to look out over Ozerbord, then leant back against the rail and smiled at her husband. &quot;You know, I rather think I have an idea about that...&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>And no, it&#39;s not &quot;If the Baronial Council wants a war, we&#39;ll give them one.&quot; ;) As I said, all new PGs (once we get to the voting stage) will be given a chunk of land corresponding with their desired countries of residence, and I&#39;ll do my best to be fair about it.

            <p>As of last time, we let people cast as many votes as they liked, then gave out PG hats to the top... well, I think it was &#39;two but the third place is joint with the second&#39;. My thought is that a couple of votes either way isn&#39;t really a significant difference, so I&#39;ll probably give a little leeway on that score. I&#39;ll be starting that thread when I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve had all the nominations we&#39;re going to - probably after the weekend.<br><br>(Oh sweet Kanun and Spelin, she&#39;s after Critta-Kalthin, isn&#39;t she? That&#39;s the only usable coastline I&#39;ve got - and I just spent six months building a proper port there!<br><br>But yeah, I tend to draw boundaries along geographical features, so northern Barony Huinesoron is a prime candidate for splitting off. So is southern Phobos, eastern Neshomeh, and, uh, northern Araeph and Cassie, though both their castles are in that region. Oh, and it looks like eastern Dann could go, if we have someone who wants to set up shop in Iric.<br><br>But really, it all comes down to where people say they&#39;re living. If necessary, I could chop off the southern half of Ozerbord, or massive chunks of Wechi, or even split Barony Araeph in half along the Hyparlink road. No-one&#39;ll get short changed - at least not until the Council convenes)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;Not just them, my Lady. Not just them.&quot;<br><br>From out of the darkness came a voice like a winter&#39;s wind in springtime, biting through lamb&#39;s wool and freezing the good seed. It was accompanied by a tallish woman dressed as a tatterdemalion, the only colour the gaudy yellow of an old paper crown atop her head.<br><br>&quot;There are those who dwell upon the road, Lady, away from high castles and high politics. The Gone-Away-Queen and her Lurking Court will run for you. Aye, run, for no beggar or wanderer or homeward-bounder stays to fight, but none do see them, fair Lady mine, none have a care to look upon them. An idly tossed ha&#39;penny and a kick from the guards for free, and we are put from their minds like filth for a midden. But we see, so we do, oh yes, we see...&quot;<br><br>The figure walked forward, gait knock-kneed and stiff with cold, every movement jerky as a badly-made puppet&#39;s. &quot;We do see all, fair Lady mine, and we are not seen. Tha&#39;s seen me afore today, mark you well, when I were a bright an&#39; shiny little harlequin fer the merriment o&#39; children and the like, but tha&#39;s not seen me since. My Court looks and sees and will report, in writin&#39; for them as can read. I&#39;ll tell &#39;em to, fer I&#39;m their Queen, a queen of rats and rottenness, a queen of the midnight alley, a queen of those who hide and are hidden.<br><br>&quot;Tha knows me by another name, and tha&#39;ll remember if you dare. But now, my fairest Lady, tha&#39;ll call me by my deeds. Tha calls me liar and cheat and, yes, vagabond, as befits my Court. Tha calls me beggar and scrounger and mendicant, parasite and plague-bringer and drug-addled caitiff, an&#39; all is true for it&#39;s a Lady as does the telling of it. Call me this, highborn.&quot;<br><br>The woman smiled, yellow in the candlelight.<br><br>&quot;Call me Scapegrace.&quot;</p>

            <p>I blame Real Life—I accepted a leadership role I shouldn&#39;t have, it&#39;s been a source of a lot of stress, and as a result I&#39;ve been feeling fairly allergic to anything that resembles committees and small-group politics.

I&#39;m not against the idea of new PGs. I don&#39;t know if we <i>need</i> them, but as others have pointed out, new blood and representation of newer generations of Boarders is probably a good idea.<br><br>To that end, I fully support the nomination of Iximaz, and I also nominate PoorCynic and doctorlit. They&#39;ve both been around a good while, they know what&#39;s what, and they have shown themselves to be leaders in the community, IMO. (Sorry, hS, but I&#39;m pretty sure we lead by example, if nothing else, what with PGs needing to be knowledgeable, trustworthy, active, good at what we do, etc.) In addition to writing great spin-offs, PC and doclit are some of the best reviewers we&#39;ve got, PC has his excellent series of workshops, and doclit has done great work on the wiki and in preserving old PPC works for posterity. Plus they&#39;re just good guys, which is at least as important as all the rest put together. {= )<br><br>So there&#39;s that, if they accept and we go ahead with this.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... I do have a plan for Plort. ;) Essentially, I&#39;m going to ask any new PGs we get which country they want to live in, and then arbitrarily cut a chunk out for them. <sup>_^</sup> In-universe, I imagine there&#39;s a ridiculously complicated formula defining the creation of new baronial territories, laid down by GreyLadyBast before she left. Then, naturally, there will be negotiations over the borders during the next Baronial Council (which I&#39;m planning for June, if anyone&#39;s wondering, to with the March and September dates of the Shipfest and the Badfic Game), which may get quite heated, or even conceivably lead to war.<br><br>And, of course, Knights and Civilians can rise up and demand that their homes switch baronies - but, again, that&#39;ll be in the thread in June. (Which I have quite a lot planned for... :D)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I may not be around to post much, but this is something I need to chime in about. I believe that Iximaz would make a fantastic Permission Giver, and I am glad to see that I am not alone in this sentiment. She&#39;s the one that got me into the PPC community, and she&#39;s often one of the first members to interact with newbies. She&#39;s passionate about everything the PPC stands for, and I know without a doubt that she wants the best for the PPC as a whole. This would mean a lot for her, and Iximaz would ensure that Permission is granted to those who can bring the best quality of writing into the community. Iximaz has shown maturity and responsibility, and I believe that she would be a perfect fit for the role.</p>

            <p>That silly little song Pinkie sang in a commercial a few years back? I did not really think of it as canon, but if it is, OK. Nothing really changed, in my view. It&#39;s not like it created a alternate universe made of humans, where every single Equestrian is in High School for some reason, and Twilight Sparkle gets flustered over some dude named Brad for no reason. That would just be stupid.<br><br>Seriously though, while EQG is stupid as all heck, I have to admit, the Dazzlings were not that bad. I mean, pony sirens? I&#39;m down. And the songs were a lot better in Rainbow Rocks too. Do I like EQG? No. Are some parts done well? Yes. Do I think it should be considered canon. OH, Celestia, no. Sadly, I have to, for PPCing&#39;s sake. *grumble dumb Brad, ruining everything grumble*</p>

            <p>Maybe it&#39;s because I was homeschooled and never experienced high school, but why would you even want to put characters from a non-high school setting into what you, the teenage author, probably experience every day?

            <p>I mean, it seems as if, in fanfic, the only kinds of schools in existence are Boarding schools or High Schools, the latter always being of the American variety. I&#39;ve seen High School AU&#39;s for Harry Potter (unnessecary in and of itself, <i>as Hogwarts is a school as well</i>), written by pepople who, by virtue of geography, never set foot in one. <br><br>They&#39;re basically taking every clichй from fiction and take it for real.* So, for what it&#39;s worth, I would say such a Division could be fun. Perhaps in the Department of Improbbable AU&#39;s?<br><br>*Note: I have never lived in the US or went to an American High School, so in case all clichй&#39;s from fiction happen to be true, I retract my statement.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve had to add a fairly long exchange to preserve narrative flow in the middle, and there&#39;s a couple of lines with no speaker assigned; if someone can pin a name on them, it&#39;d be great.<br><br>For Adam-12 (I don&#39;t know what that is, but I know the scene <sup>_<sup>),</sup></sup> I&#39;m thinking we should make a &#39;between videos&#39; chapter out of it and my Detritus scene; sort of a bonus extra scene. That keeps them out of the main narrative (which should after all be all about Rory and her mess), but lets them get a decent scene in. Then they can be referenced in the main stories.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I did a full edit-run over Chapter 1, but stopped to let DawnFire sort out the punctuation across the whole thing. I don&#39;t know if that ever happened...

What I&#39;m doing is standardising the punctuation, and editing for consistency. Jokes which have lost their references through too many interjections will be tweaked, and narrative passages which don&#39;t need to be there, or are too long, will be removed. Anything more complex than that, I&#39;ll comment rather than adding/deleting.<br><br>Once I&#39;ve finished #2, I&#39;ll move onto #3, and so on and so on.

            <p>Assuming we&#39;re talking about Iluvatar before the &#39;Old Hope&#39; comes true, his opponents would be thwarted by his complete lack of corporeal existence. On the other hand - okay, let&#39;s do this.<br><br>Scenario: the history of Middle-earth happened ~6000 years ago. After the Eldar departed forever, the Valar pretty much left the mortal lands to govern themselves. As part of that, a rash of new gods sprang up - how, doesn&#39;t matter, they just did. (Hey, it&#39;s a crossover! Don&#39;t like don&#39;t read etc) Said gods run their various classical realms, fade into the background, and recently experience a resurgance due to a bunch of demigods/magicians/people surnamed Chase running around.<br><br>Around about, oh, three hours from now, Zeus finally sits down and reads that &#39;Lord of the Rings&#39; book he&#39;s been meaning to get round to. (Actually, the book Hades recommended was <i>Lord of the Flies</i> - &#39;reminds me of our family gatherings&#39; - but Lord Zeus wasn&#39;t really listening). When he gets to the end, he realises two things:<br><br>1/ It&#39;s true.<br><br>2/ That means he is <i>not</i> the supreme deity.<br><br>Breaking with tradition, Zeus goes to visit the other pantheons - the demonesque Egyptians in their underworld and/or wanderings, and the Asgardians in... wherever they are, the book&#39;s not out yet. Through flattery, argument, and shameless bribery, he convinces them to join him in overthrowing Iluvatar once and for all. &quot;After all,&quot; he says, &quot;I did it to <i>my</i> father...&quot;<br><br><u>Round One</u><br><br>The pantheons (panthea?) try to go to the Timeless Halls. Being a part of the world, they can&#39;t.<br><br><u>Round Two</u><br><br>The pantheons (pantheii?) try to travel to Aman. Since the Straight Road has long since been severed, and it&#39;s not a mystical realm - just Elsewhere - they can&#39;t.<br><br><u>Round Three</u><br><br>Set (of course) suggests rounding up rabid <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fans, brainwashing them into wanting to kill Iluvatar, then killing them and - on the principle of &#39;you get the afterlife you expected&#39;, which seems to apply since the Kane Chronicles - getting them sent beyond the circles of the world. The others reject this.<br><br><u>Round Four</u><br><br>Set does it anyway, because he&#39;s Set.<br><br><u>Round Five</u><br><br>Iluvatar idly notes that some of his arriving Children are a bit messed up in the head. He asks Manwe what&#39;s going on.<br><br><u>Round Six</u><br><br>Manwe and the other Valar have a council. They bicker and get nothing done.<br><br><u>Round Seven</u><br><br>Ulmo (being Ulmo) pops across to the mortal lands to have a look. He runs into Poseidon, and they share a goblet of wine (since it turns out that Poseidon&#39;s palace is built on the site of Ulmo&#39;s old house, they hit it off immediately; neither of them are particularly prone to vengeance or warlike behaviour in this crossed-over verse). During their chat, Poseidon explains what&#39;s going on.<br><br><u>Round Eight</u><br><br>Ulmo heads back and lets Manwe know what&#39;s happening. At this point, there are two options.<br><br><u>Round 9A</u><br><br>The Valar point out that mortals are always killing each other, and that - much like Sauron - getting involved isn&#39;t their Thing. It&#39;s a shame, true, but it&#39;ll die down soon enough. LotR fans are driven underground, and the PPC becomes a secret-refuge-cum-guerilla-organisation.<br><br><u>Round 9B</u><br><br>The Valar get seriously upset - enough that (noting as they have before that directly confronting the enemy would risk destroying the world, &#39;and the Children are kind of using it&#39;) they lay down their guardianship of Arda for a time.<br><br><u>Round 10 (only after 9B)</u><br><br>Iluvatar hits New York with a tsunami beyond anyone&#39;s imagination, destroying the current site of Olympus; the East Coast of America is under 100 meters of water, permanently, stretching in to the Appalachians. He also hits the original Mount Olympus with a gigantic earthquake, reducing it (and most of Greece) to rubble. To follow up, he enacts a &#39;change in the world&#39; - this time, he causes the Seen and Unseen worlds to merge, permanently. The Mist vanishes. The Duat goes with it. All the metaphysical domains visited by Greek and Egyptian alike go <i>poof</i>. Transit to extra-dimensional realms becomes impossible. Oh, and whatever the Norse have going on is hit by massive natural disasters and/or the Change.<br><br><b>Result:</b> The remains of the USA splinter, and Western Civilisation falls - which, since that&#39;s what both sets of deities have been worried about, pretty much knocks them on the head regardless. Africa descends into universal warfare, what with the lack of incoming relief, trade, or anything else. The Olympus Quake sends massive tidal waves across the entire Mediterranean coastline, so there&#39;s no Italy, Egypt, Israel, southern Spain, southern France... you name it, it&#39;s gone. The New York Tsunami was probably caused by a mid-Atlantic quake, so the rest of Spain and France also go under, along with most of the UK and Ireland. The Caribbean islands all sink.<br><br>Global tensions rise (there&#39;s an understatement for you). China is now the dominant power on the planet. Assuming humanity survives (which shouldn&#39;t be presumed, what with all the nuclear weapons and suchlike), we&#39;ll all be speaking Mandarin.<br><br>The Timeless Halls get a whole bunch of new, and very confused, mortal residents. Iluvatar makes them all feel better. Awww.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s great that you&#39;re excited about this, but I&#39;m a little uncomfortable with your looking to deliberately find minis just because. As the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini">Mini</a> page on the wiki says:<br><br><i>The creation of new mini types is reserved for either a) the creator of the OFU in that continuum, or b) if there is no OFU, the first person to write about them in a mission to that continuum. The reason for this is that, while it&#39;s fun to dream up mini types, it isn&#39;t fair to the people actually writing in a new continuum if the perks of doing so are gone when they get there.</i><br><br>You should be writing missions because you can make something entertaining out of the original badfic, not out of some desire to &quot;catch &#39;em all.&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;d be a massive douche and point out that the entirety of Rick Riordan&#39;s... <i>work</i> features a gaggle replacements of existing canon characters (i.e. the Greek and Roman pantheons), glossing over the less savoury aspects of certain among their number for reasons of kid-friendliness (cf. turning shapeshifting serial rapist Poseidon into someone&#39;s Grandad on a fishing holiday somewhere warm) and generally being about as accurate a representation - and interesting a use - of classical mythology as a Suefic is of a canon source... or possibly Stufic, since whether or not Percy Jackson (teenager with sword) is capable of defeating Ares (turned a teenager into a chicken once because he was moderately annoyed at him) without the aid of Because I Said So Of God, so to speak, I leave to more experienced members&#39; discretion.<br><br>But I&#39;m not a douche, so I won&#39;t. =]<br><br>Seriously, though, this is eminently missionable and I wish you the very best of luck. Despite what I said above, I do think the series has some potential and interesting ideas. I just wish they explored some other pantheons as well, like the Chinese or the Kuba ones.

            <p>he had to change some aspects to make it kid-friendly. I don&#39;t think parents want kids want to read about the gods&#39; more *ahem* questionable interactions with mortals, or how some (like Artemis) demanded human sacrifice at some temples, or how Apollo and Artemis together killed fourteen kids because Queen Niobe insulted their own mother, Leto. And don&#39;t get me started on Artemjs turning her most loyal follower into a bear because said follower had the audacity to get raped by Zeus.<br><br>And the recently-published <i>Percy Jackson&#39;s Greek Gods</i> is a lot more accurate to the source material, and even calls rape by name. It doesn&#39;t dance around much, to be honest.<br><br>I will agree with the whole &#39;Percy beating Ares&#39; thing; that was not one of the canon&#39;s better moments.<br><br>Have you read <i>The Kane Chronicles</i>? It&#39;s set in the same universe, but about Egyptian mythology, and he has another series coming out later called <i>Gods of Asgard</i> or some such, also set in the same universe.</p>

            <p>What, like pretty much every other fantasy series in need of mystical powers and a dash of vaguely-educational cultchaa so parents don&#39;t feel as bad about buying them for their kids?<br><br>My point is, we see pantheons like that all the time. It&#39;s usually just Greco-Roman stuff, but there are so many other legendaria from outside the Scanditerranean Mythological Co-Prosperity Sphere that have fantastic stories! Go all out!

Actually, that&#39;s a point, this is all set in the continental US so... why on Earth hasn&#39;t he done anything from a Native American/First Nations religion?

            <p>I&#39;ve loved the series for a long time, and if you don&#39;t, that&#39;s fine. I won&#39;t argue with you about it. I just think it was a nice modern adaptation of Greek mythology, and it&#39;s just as important to my childhood as Harry Potter. <br><br>The reason why his books are about &#39;classical&#39; mythology is probably because he used to teach that. Still, that&#39;s not to say he&#39;ll never write about less well-known mythologies in the future; he made allusions to Native American (namely Cherokee) and Chinese mythology in his <i>Heros of Olympus</i> series, and from what little prior knowledge I had, it seemed fairly accurate. And yes, his writing has definitely gotten better in the later books. Or at least, I think so.<br><br>But hey, if you have a sporking of it, I&#39;d read it! I&#39;d like to see some non-fan&#39;s perspective of it.</p>

            <p>Like I said when beta-reading this, I&#39;m kinda glad you picked something pretty short to work with. If I had to pick a favorite part, it would definitely be the death of the replacement. A dramatic fight scene would only put the agents on the losing side, and special note goes to this instance because of how powerful Prototype characters usually are. Using Suu to get rid of him was so unexpected that it just works, for both the agents and the readers.<br><br>And just FYI, I&#39;d actually be interested in a collab with you sometime.

            <p>Hi everyone of the PPC! I have finally work up the courage to post in the board, and I can say I love the place! (Thank then gods that TVTropes brought me here!) I&#39;m a 20-something male from Mexico,  Iґm currently studying Visual Arts, I would love to become a comic-book writer and illustrator, I have read both the Constitution and The Original Series, and no, English is not my native language, sorry for any weird grammar and syntax. <br><br>My favorite fandoms are (oh boy!): <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and Tolkienverse in general, <i>Frozen</i>, <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> and spin-offs, <i>The Elder Scrolls</i>, <i>Star Wars</i>, The DC Universe, Marvel Universe, and superheroes, sci-fi and fantasy in general, with a little anime/manga mixed in.<br><br>I also love to read a lot, play videogames, create OCs and conlags, as well as researching about History and Linguistics for fun. Also I&#39;ve trying to learn for a while Japanese, Sindarin, Ancient Greek and Latin.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure if this thread would be the most correct one to make some questions to those who are better versed than me in the Tolkienverse, but here goes:<br><br>How much of a breach in canon would be a reddish-blonde-haired, green-eyed elf? Could be justified? And if is a big breach and cannot be justified; how can the character be twisted to conform to canon?</p>

            <p>Red hair does turn up rarely, at least among the Noldor—three of Fлanor&#39;s children were redheads or auburn-haired, so it could crop up in others of his line. Blonde hair was common among the Vanyar, and may appear in elves of partially Vanyarin descent, such as Galadriel.<br><br>Reddish-blonde (strawberry blonde?) is another matter, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s not entirely impossible with the right genetic background assuming elven genetics work the same way as human genetics.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>And thanks for the welcome too!<br><br>Now back to the matter of the OC in construction; the that was given following the same logic of human-like genetics for elves, and cross-referencing it with the green eyes genetic distribution for Real World humans; I gotta say that the OC would need to have a very, very <i>tangled</i> family tree, requiring Noldorin, Sindarin, and Silvan/Avarin ancestors, making the OC in question quite likely one random subject of Lord Thranduil of Northern Mirkwood, for the Third Age timeline required for the proyected fic.<br><br>Now, why would one of the elves of Mirkwood make all the journey <i>past</i> the Misty Mountains and into Eriador, is an entirelly different matter that myself would have to deal with.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t recall any elves with green eyes at all, and if there aren&#39;t any, it would be impossible regardless of the OC&#39;s background.

            <p>Eye colour... actually, green is more feasible than you might think! Virtually all elves with defined eye colour have grey, of course. A handful have blue (notably, in one instance, Olwe king of Alqualonde), but it&#39;s pretty much grey throughout. The only green-eyed character I know of in the Legendarium is Gollum. ;)<br><br><i>But</i>... what colour is that &#39;grey&#39;? In several instances, it&#39;s sea-grey, and to my mind, that speaks more of a washed-out (ha ha) green than of pale blue. So you could definitely argue for a &#39;sea-green&#39;-eyed elf, of any kindred. You&#39;d have a hard time pushing for &#39;grass-green&#39;, though.<br><br>Hair colour is... heh. As Nesh said, the only red-haired house is that of Mahtan, and through his daughter some of House Feanor. But that&#39;s fine, we don&#39;t know where Mahtan got his colouration from, he could have relatives dotted around all over the place. But aside from that... hair colour among the Eldar seems to be metaphysically linked to their attributes. Mahtan the smith has fiery red hair; three of his grandchildren share it, of which two (Maedhros and Amrod) died in fire; in fact, their whole house has a fire link. Similarly, the &#39;holy&#39; Vanyar are blonde, with that light-connection; Elu Thingol, the king of the starlight, has silver hair; Thranduil is a gold-crowned king. Etc etc etc. So, annoyingly, in Middle-earth, the cliche &#39;fiery redhead&#39; might actually make sense.<br><br>Coming back to the eyes: I&#39;d trust the Nandor about the sons of Dior, since they&#39;ve got a long tradition of accurately transmitting spoken history. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;d help. Beren had blue-grey eyes and somewhat fair hair (due to looking exactly like Tolkien), Luthien had black hair and grey eyes (of course); Beren descended from both House Beor and House Hador, but all known descriptions give them grey and blue eyes respectively, and dark and blond hair.<br><br>There just... aren&#39;t any green or brown eyes among the Quendi or the Edain. Everyone who reached Beleriand had grey or blue eyes, despite those both being recessive. For brown (and therefore &#39;grass-green&#39; and related colours), you&#39;d have to look at the races of Men who spread south from Hildorien rather than west, or who stayed put: the Varags of Khand, the Haradrim, the Easterlings and the like.<br><br>(There are two exceptions to my blanket statements above, and they&#39;re both hilarious:<br><br>1/ The Hobbits seem to have been of &#39;eastern&#39; stock, making them browner than the Edain, and probably brown-eyed. Apparently they fled the East around the beginning of the Third Age - probably when Sauron&#39;s spirit fled from the Last Alliance in defeat and set up a long way to the east.<br><br>2/ The Druedain/Wild Men/Woses had, apparently, glowing <i>red</i> eyes. They&#39;re the only non-blue-grey race who reached Beleriand - oh, except for Ents, who had brown/gold eyes. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s helpful, though)<br><br>So, uh... are you trying to <i>make</i> a red/green OC (and if so, why?), or to <i>justify</i> one, or to <i>denounce</i> one? It&#39;s kind of hard to tell.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Darn, now I&#39;m going to end up analysing why there are so many varieties of short people in Arda. Hobbits, Dwarves, Petty-dwarves, Druedain...</p>

            <p>This is exactly the information I was looking for!!! Thank you very much! It actually simplifies my work, because allows me to get rid of the convoluted family tree and remove the OC from the House of Thingol, reducing speshulness levels.<br><br>Regarding the eye-color, I don&#39;t care about the particular shade of green, as long is a shade of green; had it been impossible, I could have used gray or light blue, which aren&#39;t unheard of with this particular OC archetype. Also, I got to same shade of green with the character creation of LOTRO. Same with the hair color.<br><br>And the idea that the hair color is metaphysically linked to the atttributes of the character just gives me more options to torture and humilliate the OC exploiting its flaws. <br><br>Finally, about the last sentence; I&#39;m trying to <i>make</i> and <i>justify</i> and red-haired/green-eyed OC. Why? Well that&#39;s a complicated question. My answer would be, that those characteristics are due to the derivation from one of the three OC archetypes that I use, this specific one usually used for protagonists. This starting archetype, is a female with strawberry-blonde hair and heterochromia (one eye blue the other green), this archetype is nothing but a clean slate that then I twist and change until it comforms to the canon and/or other specific needs for the character, and then I give a personality, derived from the keywords &quot;creativity&quot;, &quot;ingenuity&quot; and/or &quot;imagination&quot;. Trust me, this can get to many wildly different personalities, and different ways to exploit the flaws derived from them. I hope that answers your question.<br></p>

            <p>Maeglin, for one—he&#39;s a mix of Vanyarin, Noldorin, and Telerin blood, but he&#39;s described as resembling the Noldor most. What exactly &quot;dark&quot; means is open to debate.

            <p>Yeah, probably as an elf would impossible, but there&#39;s a possible workaround, if the green eyes were to be considered a <i>Edain</i>-only characteristic; the OC could be  Half-Elven, a faaaar descendant of Elurйd or Elurнn, since no one knows what happened to the twins; but Nandor tradition sustains (according to the <i>Quenta Silmarillion</i>) that they survived &quot;led to the safety of the woodlands by birds and beasts&quot;.<br><br>Yes, I&#39;m aware of the implications, I don&#39;t like them much either, I will have to look for other ways to crush the Sue-ness before it gets worst.</p>

            <p>I’ve finally got myself to join the PPC and waved goodbye to the last vestiges of my sanity. So, hello everyone!<br>I’m a twenty-something guy from the Netherlands, currently working on my MA in History. I’ve been reading PPC missions for the past three months as a distraction while on international exchange in India, where they served as safe little havens of insanity when the culture shock became too much.<br>With two librarians in the family I’ve been brought up with reading, and my personal favorites include <i>Harry Potter</i>, <i>Discworld</i> (although I am just getting started in the series) and the works of David Eddings and Tonke Dragt. I’ve struggled through <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and while enjoyable, I prefer the films. I’m also a bit of a connoisseur of video games, although i’m behind the times by roughly five years (due to a combined lack of time and money: the two curses of the university student).<br>While I like history in general, my heart skips a beat whenever I get to do something with the history of technology, especially (military) aviation. So if someone happens to do a mission that involves things like that, I’m always available for a friendly discussion or for fact-checking.<br>I’m fluent in Dutch, and fairly good in English (thanks, bi-langual education!). I am also able to &quot;communicate&quot; with people in French and German, but only as a last resort. My math is horrible, though...<br>Thank you all for reading!<br></p>

            <p>I do have the basics of Roman history down, and we had to study his work as one of the first Roman historians during historiography class last year, but other than that my Roman history is as rusty as an artefact pulled from the wells in Bath.<br>basicaly, our Uni splits the history students in two groups at the end of the first year, some going to the department of antiquities (and are hardly ever seen again) and the majority moving into what’s called &quot;medieval to present”. I’m one of the last group (to be exact, department of contemporary history, unit of colonial history). The antiquities are compelled to take Latin and Ancient Greek, and I couldn’t handle those languages...<br></p>

            <p>I have a friend in classical studies - what you&#39;d call antiquities, I guess - and he&#39;s ecstatic. Then again, he&#39;s weird like that.<br>I myself enjoy reading Roman history for fun; I doubt I&#39;ll go and study history once I&#39;m done with my military service, though, because that&#39;s not something you can make a living from.</p>

            <p>If you enjoy history, go for it! You’d be supprized how much you can do with it. The advantage (and disadvantage) of a history degree is that you are not taught one job, but a skill that is needed in many jobs: to analyze, organize and synthesize information quickly. A history degree can get you many places; Our current Prime Minister, for example, has one.</p>

Twu wuv, a distinct lack of sense and logic, a ballroom full of gravestones, it&#39;s all there!<br><br>As a direct consequence of the events of that mission, a <s>lucky</s> scientist in the PPC Medical Research Division was able to write <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zjuWXOOKCygKRjiurR775NAnYeKUNpZ0IPfDqpgL_AI">a very interesting paper</a> about what could well be a brand-new Suvian affliction.<br><br><br>P.S. The <a href="http://www.quotev.com/story/5842191/Frozen-To-You/">original fic</a> in the Circle of Lemmings seems to be down at the moment. It disappeared and reappeared several times while I was writing the mission (completely unchanged each time as far as I could tell), so I imagine it&#39;ll pop its head out again soon.<br><br>P.P.S.

            <p>A very creative way to kill a fairly mediocre fic. Well done, fun to read!<br><br>So... does this mean we need to start worrying about the various ex-Sues and Replacements in the PPC? If one of them gets into a relationship - even a temporary one - with an &#39;abnormal&#39; agent, and they come into contact with glitter, we could see Reason #43 Cascades springing up across HQ. I realise we haven&#39;t <i>before</i>, but that doesn&#39;t mean anything where Legal are involved.<br><br>Hmmm... I don&#39;t think Constance was a Maglor fangirl, so she should be safe. Can&#39;t think of any other ex-badfic characters in my works. I&#39;d worry about Sergio Turbo and Nikki Cherryflower, though... looks like Sergio might even have the slightly &#39;abnormal&#39; anatomy needed to pull it off.<br><br>As for Morgan&#39;s reaction, it goes something like this.<br><br>Ahahahahahahahahahaha!<br><br>Pause for breath.<br><br>Ahahahahahahahahahaha!<br><br>Reader, have we forwarded a copy to the Guardsman and Ceka? Good. And can we see about informing HQ&#39;s former Replacements what they need to look out for? Great, thanks. Where was I? Oh yes.<br><br>Ahahahahahahahahahaha!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s especially funny because I used to love the ever-loving shiitake mushrooms out of that movie, and I was wondering how long it would be before somebody tried tackling badfic of it. Though objectively I now feel that there are better-written flicks out there, I personally think it&#39;s not the worst thing Disney has to offer - it&#39;s just so overrated it&#39;s not even funny. *shudders at the memory of all the Olaf merchandise I see at, oh, every single store ever*<br><br>Opinions aside, though, it was about time that Evie and Fish did a new mission. I personally like the original lyrics of &#39;Let It Go&#39; better, and man, I feel sorry for the Fisherman after what happened.

            <p>I only watched it relatively recently, and I actually really like it.

            <p>I love reading the Fisherman, and seeing what happens to him at the end was absolutely priceless. I also like his optimism in the face of canon butchering - though I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t make the leap that Elsa&#39;s ability to create sentient life might actually be hijacking sentient beings from parallel universes and shoving their consciousnesses in ice sculptures-<br><br>Oh. That&#39;s... that&#39;s a bit dark for him, now that I say it out loud. Ignore me then.<br><br>Also:<br><br>---<br><br>The strange, unnatural, wheezy-sounding noise billowed out from RC 1875 like a cloud of mustard gas. Its cause was a video, currently playing on the ruggedized Control Panel bolted securely to the room&#39;s wall. Wobbles had a quick look inside, saw the Notary with tears streaming down her face and rolling on the floor, assumed there wasn&#39;t a medical emergency, and bounced in.<br><br>&quot;Heya, Agent Holy See! Glad to see you&#39;ve cheered up!&quot;<br><br>The Notary just pointed at the screen before collapsing into gales of something I will call, for lack of a better option, laughter. Somewhere in the distance a glass shattered.<br><br>&quot;Huh. Oooh, did he get Suviated? Wowzers. That&#39;s... that&#39;s a class 4 FGE at least, goodness golly gracious, I had one of them once time and it was just the <i>worst</i>. I wonder if they voltage-calmed him - nope, nope, just the happy juice. Say, I&#39;ve got an errand to run, so, uh, you okay down there?&quot;<br><br>There was something that sounded like a hoover struggling manfully against the attentions of a lascivious pufferfish, so Wobbles just strolled out of the room again, heading down to the A/V Department. It was a fairly long walk, since she&#39;d been banned from using the lifts on account of her condition, but hey, it was good exercise, right? She got there eventually. It wasn&#39;t like there was any rush.<br><br>&quot;Heya, gangeroos!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hi, Wobbles,&quot; chorused the various techies. &quot;What do you need? Can we have the scripts for the next week&#39;s Wobblevision?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. Well, uh, maybe. I... kinda need a favour, <i>please</i> don&#39;t tell Adam, I&#39;d never hear the gosh-darn-diddly end of it. See, there&#39;s this video...&quot;<br><br>A few minutes of negotiation and some hastily transferred scripts later, the technicians got to work, and Wobbles bounced out the room just in time to see the video of her roomie&#39;s encounter with herself that one time play over the broadcast screens dotted around Headquarters.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not nice to laugh at the misfortune of others, is it?&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Yes, Wobbles is kind of a douche.</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t imagine the Notary will be particularly pleased, though... :P<br><br>As for the consciousness-transplant, it&#39;s a nice idea and probably the kind of theory Fish would actually come up with if someone suddenly acquired the ability to create sentient life.

            <p>Around Christmas, the BBC aired a radio play of <i>Good Omens</i>, the Pratchett-Gaiman novel. Has anyone else listened to this? It&#39;s available online <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04knt4h/episodes/guide">here</a> for the next week or so, though I can&#39;t promise the BBC link will work in America; I suspect there&#39;s other sources out there, though.<br><br>It&#39;s... really good, actually. They&#39;ve put virtually all of the book dialogue in, and most of the stuff they&#39;ve added is from the book too; the neat thing about <i>Good Omens</i> is that a lot of the best &#39;narrative&#39; passages are presented as third-person internal monologues - which means they can become first-person speech very easily. About all they&#39;ve had to add from scratch is the usual radio play &#39;now I shall mutter my actions/question yours&#39; stuff.<br><br>For the voices - well, Newt is voiced by Merlin (the one from, uh, <i>Merlin</i>), and Crowley is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Serafinowicz">Peter Serafinowicz</a>, who people know from all sorts of things but I mostly remember from &#39;Look Around You&#39;. Pretty much all the voices are good fits, though I find Anathema to be far less frumpy than she should be.<br><br>The story mostly focusses on Crowley and Aziraphale for the first part (<a href="http://www.blastr.com/2015-12-30/now-you-can-listen-neil-gaiman-and-terry-pratchetts-good-omens-radio-play-full">oh, hey, in-character picture, neat</a>), then switches over to a full ensemble. They managed to make most of the characters easily distinguishable - the Four Horsemen in particular are very distinct - though I&#39;m not even trying to remember which is which between Brian and Wensledale.<br><br>They&#39;ve thrown in a couple of lines to bring it into the present - there&#39;s a <i>Doctor Who</i> name-drop, and a reference to smart phones - but mostly just haven&#39;t bothered, and it doesn&#39;t seem to hurt anything. There&#39;s also rather more radio announcers than I remember - I think the BBC presenters wanted to get in on the act! There&#39;s always a couple credit &#39;as themselves&#39; by the end of an episode.<br><br>It runs to six episodes, which are half an hour each (though the finale is a full hour), and I think it&#39;s well worth a listen. It also gives me hope that it might eventually become a movie - if they keep the dialogue this intact <i>without</i> visuals, it should be even easier - and better - <i>with</i> them.<br><br>(Apologies for any mini-Hellhounds in there; I dirrent mean to!)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I left under a bit of a cloud. This is because I was being an angry, strident little blob of dog vomit to longstanding members of the Board for no reason other than my own arrogance. It became clear that I needed to change, and it rapidly became clearer that I couldn&#39;t change without breaking links with my old username.<br><br>Besides, I&#39;ve grown rather attached to Scapegrace as a moniker. Over on CivFanatics, I&#39;m an upstanding member of the community and part of one of the bigger modding groups for Civ V. It&#39;s making me think more and deeper about both the world and my own small place in it, and it&#39;s... it&#39;s been good for me. I&#39;ve got something I can be legitimately proud of that&#39;s all my own work, which I only had in sporadic bursts before - and even then they were decidedly few and far between. I don&#39;t make a secret of the fact that I have a slew of mental health issues, but chief among them is anhedonia. I don&#39;t feel pleasure in pleasurable activities (minds out of the gutter, you lot), and when I do feel a bit, it&#39;s fuzzy and out of focus and the colours of it seem washed out, if that makes any sense. As Scapegrace, over there, I&#39;ve had something that makes me happy and makes other people happy.<br><br>It&#39;s all I&#39;ve really ever wanted to do, tbh.</p>

            <p>This is a short, non-PPC story set in the OFUM of the present day. It&#39;s pretty much a reaction to the <i>Hobbit</i> trilogy, and more particularly to <i>The Battle of the Five Armies</i>. So yeah, spoilers for all of those.<br><br>And yes, it&#39;s a bit cheeky writing an OFUM fic, but I hope Miss Cam will forgive me. <sup>_<sup><br><br>&lt;a</sup></sup> href=&quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDisY6ny1PXNIN6SpfY8NE5PA16E7BhWKeCPQHRIOho/pub%22%3EInterlude">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aDisY6ny1PXNIN6SpfY8NE5PA16E7BhWKeCPQHRIOho/pub&quot;&gt;Interlude</a> at OFUM</a><br><br>(And in fine fanfic tradition: if anyone can think of a better title, please let me know.

            <p>This actually hit me kind of hard.  I hadn&#39;t stopped to think about how the adaptation&#39;s changes would affect Legolas as a character.  I mean, I see it as two different versions of him from two different Middle-earths, but . . . it was still an interesting examination of how it might have affected him.  I&#39;m still glad you ended it on a lighter note, though.<br><br>Some possible titles:<br><br>&quot;An Unexpected Adaptation&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Desolation of Jackson&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Battle of the Two Backstories&quot;<br><br>&quot;A Change in the Stars&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit will eventually read the original OFUM, probably</p>

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t normally view the movies as modifying the original character of Legolas either - for instance, I wouldn&#39;t consider his mother&#39;s new history to be canon with the Legendarium - but that emphatically doesn&#39;t hold true for OFUM. That&#39;s why I set this piece there, in fact: I needed a Legolas who could know about both angles, and OFUM fit the bill. The fact that it let me muck about with Lina and Gimli a bit was an added bonus. <sup>-<sup><br><br>From</sup></sup> the titles: thank you! I really like &#39;A Change in the Stars&#39;, and actually, I like it more the more I think about it. I see at least three layers of meaning in there... yes, I&#39;ll go with that.

This Prince sees the mortal realm of Nirn as his personal plaything, made to be bent to his dark whims. Molag Bal covets the souls of the dead, wanting to drag all of Mundus into his plane of Oblivion: Coldharbor. It was in Coldharbor that this artifact was crafted. At first, it seems nothing more then a small, hollow rod. So unassuming it is, most would think it a simple drinking straw. Yet, do not underestimate the danger it poses, nor the power it possess. Like its master&#39;s children, the vampires, this straw sucks the life from mortals, transferring it to the wielder, closing wounds and reversing age. Beware, however, those who would wield such a force against their fellow man: with each life consumed, your overall constitution weakens, leaving you vulnerable to those who would strike back.<br><br>Yes, I just gave you the Vampire&#39;s Straw. Use it wisely.<br><br>...What? Molag Bal is an evil Daedra, even by Daedric standards! You can&#39;t expect everything to be funny all the time.</p>

            <p>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is World-Jumper. I found the PPC through TV Tropes, after looking for multiversal organizations to get inspiration for a character I was writing. My fandoms are: Doctor Who (though I have not been able to watch it in a while), Percy Jackson, Elder Scrolls, Portal, Dragon Age (I have only played Origins though), and my largest fandom, My Little Pony. I am a die-hard brony, so much so that my first agents will likely work exclusively in the MLP universe. But, I ramble. I am super excited to be part of this community!<br><br>...What was that? I already am in the community? I have permission? And two stories out too? Wow. It&#39;s been so long, I plum forgot.<br><br>Jokes aside, hello again PPC! Man, it has been a while, hasn&#39;t it? Last I checked in, I was working on a campaign! My guy lost. Let&#39;s... lets move on. I would rather not rage on the board.<br><br>So, what has happened while I was gone? Again? I know I supposedly came back several months ago, but life caught back up to me. Now I am in college, and shockingly, find myself with more free time! In fact, enough free time to work on a certain story I was supposed to be working on for half a year. Yes Iximaz, I have started working on it officially. I have already made some changes, though I would like it if you looked them over. We will have to organize some times we can edit together. I want to bounce some ideas off of you, and see where we want to go from where we are.<br><br>Well, enough of that. Let me say, it feels good being on the board again. Let&#39;s see if I can get stories out any faster this time around!</p>

            <p>First: Coolest. Feather quill. Ever. It&#39;s so shiny, like the finest crafted piece of silver.

I needed something to write with anyway.<br><br>Thanks! I&#39;m glad you liked the mission. Looking back, there are a couple scenes I could probably shore up a little, but I think I am just going to leave it be. I am still very proud if it, and do intend to do more with them. Do you have any scenes you loved from it? Any you thought could be done a bit better? I like feedback on my works, so please, let me know what you like or don&#39;t like about the mission. Especially what you don&#39;t like. I like to know my weaknesses, so I can improve.<br><br>She is really good. I think our styles are going to mesh well. She keeps me restrained, and I flesh out the badfic a little. Her biting sarcasm helps a lot too. I am looking forward to when it is complete.</p>

There&#39;s also a big New Year Chat thread that&#39;s probably buried by now, and a gift exchange event running on the other board.<br><br>Iximaz has definitely been busy: she released three or four missions while you were gone, mostly in Harry Potter. I released my first mission to overall positive reviews, and my one-time coauthor SkarmorySilver released the first one under his new DMS team (but someone probably told you about that already). <br><br>Good luck with that thing you and Iximaz are doing! :)</p>

I&#39;ve rather missed seeing the plovers fluttering around.<br><br>I&#39;ll have to look into that New Year&#39;s chat thing. It&#39;s rather... Extensive though. Might take a while to get through, but I&#39;ll do it!<br><br>Oh, fantastic! Congradulations on your first mission! Would you kindly drop a link to it for me? I would love to read it, and I will be sure to give feedback afterwards. <br><br>Iximaz has been a busy one, hasn&#39;t she? Just wish I had the same amount of drive to get my own missions out. Still, hopefully I can crank out a Marvin and Printworthy short, or a Jumper interlude, or something. First priority, however, is... well, school, but <i>second</i> is that crossover with Iximaz. I have been putting that off for far too long.<br><br>Thanks man. I think I&#39;ll need it.</p>

            <p>Think about it. If they call Celestia in, the plot would be over before it began. She could fly in, grab the flower, fly out. So, for the sake of plot, she needs to stay out of it. <br><br>Also, know how I said it was rather Tolkien like?  That definately includes the tremendous strengths of his writings, but also his weaknesses. The exposition and world building can get in the way of the main story at times. However, when Jet decides to show rather then tell, his imagery is nothing less then breathtaking. More then worth your time, I assure you.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s see, what else... How about <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/20685/sunny-skies-all-day-long">Sunny Skies All Day Long?</a> A short slice-of-life that I think would work wonderfully as an episode of the show.<br><br>Or, is crossovers are your thing, <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/400/binky-pie">Binky Pie?</a> A crossover with MLP:FiM and Discworld. The author captures the writing style of Terry Pratchett so well, I&#39;m half convinced he <i>is</i> Pratchett! While admittedly the Ponyville sections are a little flat, the Discworld chapters are nothing short of brilliant.<br><br>Finally, because I feel I must, the only fanfic I have read that did the alicorn OC well (well, save Past Sins, but that&#39;s debatable): <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/20069/order-and-chaos">Order and Chaos.</a> This fic tells the origin story of Discord. While not one of the best fanfics around, it gets points for making a sympathetic alicorn OC. The use of memes can get annoying at times, but on the whole, is written rather well. Note that it was set late season 2, so some things have changed since then.<br><br>...You know, I should probably just start a fanfic rec list. </p>

            <p>Four things we look for in Permission requests: community wossname, character, understanding of the PPC, and writing.<br><br><b>Community</b><br><br>Well, I can hardly say we don&#39;t know you! I&#39;m still not entirely confident in your intentions, given statements like &#39;back to waiting and community-ing&#39; which imply that you see interacting with the community as a hurdle on the way to getting Permission, rather than, y&#39;know, the whole reason the Board is here, but I&#39;ll give you a tentative pass on this one.<br><br><b>Characters</b><br><br><u>Valon</u> - Fairly inoffensive, really. Your samples represent the &#39;chaotic&#39; aspect of his personality fairly well. Hopefully you&#39;ll also remember to keep track of &#39;poor fighter&#39;, rather than having him murder his way through the multiverse. The shovel I... don&#39;t really care about either way? It&#39;s good if you use it well, pointless if you just give him guns instead/let Kala do the fighting. It depends how you write it.<br><br>One thing: hi there, mostly-accurate description of my own colour-blindness! Are you colour-blind yourself? If so, or if you&#39;ve talked to someone to get the details, fine. If not, from personal experience I&#39;d say that Valon would probably see urple as pink, not purple; purple is pretty much a non-colour for me, with pink running straight into blue. It&#39;s mostly etymology at that point, but I thought I&#39;d mention. (Also, please remember that brown is a shade of yellow, so yellow-lime green is just as indistinct as brown-dark green)<br><br><u>Kala</u> - On appearance, the Romani/Roma ethnic type tends to be somewhat darker than you&#39;ve drawn her. They also tend towards dark hair, so I&#39;m curious as to why she dyes (or bleaches) hers. Cultural conflict, or just felt like it?<br><br>I&#39;m not really seeing the characteristics in her bio carried over to the samples. Sadonic, irritable, troublemaker? The only one that comes across is irritable, and that only around the Marquis. Valon sexually assaults her and accuses her of a crime she didn&#39;t commit, and she takes both of them really calmly. It doesn&#39;t really gel with how I&#39;d imagine &#39;has been transferred out of three different homes&#39; would leave you.<br><br>Purely from her bio, though, she seems okay. I&#39;m trusting that you know the canon well enough to not have anything unrealistic from that angle.<br><br><b>PPC understanding</b><br><br>Ehh... yeah, fine. Nothing coming up as &#39;wait, that&#39;s not the PPC&#39;. I don&#39;t think Makes-Things would just shove her into the Marquis&#39; office without a word, and I&#39;m certain the Marquis would recognise him, but fine. Equally, the Marquis doesn&#39;t sit - he&#39;s a giant Daisy - but again, that&#39;s a &#39;little details&#39; sort of thing that a beta should catch, and/or you could tweak after publication (which is a thing that we shouldn&#39;t be afraid of). The idea of the Marquis checking the Words around a recruit for her details is new as far as I know, but I quite like it.<br><br>As to the RC decor... okay, that&#39;s weird, but it&#39;s weird in an interesting way. Again, though, make sure you don&#39;t forget about it. (And... why is there chicken in the walls?)<br><br>Oh, yeah: &#39;ZEEN!&#39;? That&#39;s not a normal console noise. Unless you&#39;ve got an explanation, it&#39;d be best to change that back.<br><br><b>Writing</b><br><br>The big one. Okay:<br>-Spelling, punctuation, grammar - check.<br>-Sueish characters - uncheck (which is good).<br>-Consistent characters - mostly check (see the comments about Kala above)<br>-Writing style - ... writing style. Yeah.<br><br>I have to agree with TheShyIon here - it&#39;s trying too hard. Comments like &#39;What did you think would happen?&#39; or &#39;You might be surprised by which one was the first to turn bright red and scream.&#39; are basically highlighting the humour, which you don&#39;t need to if it&#39;s funny. A simple &#39;naturally, the device was broken on impact&#39; works just fine.<br><br>Equally (and still on the &#39;trying too hard&#39; front), you&#39;ve got some pretty overwrought descriptive phrases. &#39;Valon heard the girtablilu speak, and grinned&#39;? We can tell from the fact that he&#39;s replying to her that he heard her speak. Two paragraphs above, everything up to &#39;Kala just stood there&#39; is redundant: we can see from the description of his rambles that it&#39;s confusing and impossible to keep up with.<br><br>What this comes down to is that your writing is a really good example of the conflict in &#39;show, don&#39;t tell&#39;. You&#39;re currently doing both: telling, then showing. And you don&#39;t need to; the showing is fine by itself. We, the readers, are capable of spotting why it&#39;s funny that Valin jumps away first, without you highlighting it. We&#39;re capable of understanding that someone going on about the Magic School Bus is funny and confusing. And yes, there are a lot of other examples of the same thing.<br><br>On the other hand... your <i>second</i> sample barely does any of this, and you actually allow the dialogue to take centre-stage (though, still, we can guess from &quot;... what?&quot; that Kala looked confused, and with only two characters we can keep track of who&#39;s speaking). So I&#39;m wondering whether you were trying to show off too much of the details in the first story.<br><br>Eh.<br><br>Ehh.<br><br>Ehhhhhhh I hate making decisions. This is why I didn&#39;t want to be a Permission Giver.<br><br>Arright, fine. I&#39;m going to put a bit of faith in you and say Permission Granted. Please, please take on board everything I&#39;ve said here, and everything that&#39;s been said to you before, and use it to continually improve your writing.<br><br>(Also, given that both eatpraylove and SkarmorySilver <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=266292;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=50">offered to beta for you previously</a>, and both provided their emails, I&#39;ve got no idea why you didn&#39;t email them rather than asking twice more. It&#39;s quite rude to ignore someone&#39;s offer like that, really)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Allow me to clear up a few things.<br><br>I still have &quot;New Lodgings&quot; as canon for Valon (the Response Center of Terror, as you called it.). In that, he accidentally changes the console&#39;s BEEP to Psycho strings.<br><br>Yes, I am colorblind. I&#39;m not sure exactly what kind, though. And thanks for clearing up the urple bit.<br><br>Writing style... wellll, I was trying to mimic Terry Pratchett.<br><br>Kala dyes her hair out of personal preference.<br><br>Kala DID kinda turn Valon upside down and smack his head on the floor after being accused of eating his ice cream. Her method of calming him down when he&#39;s freaking out about physical contact also involves bashing him in the head. And hey, she&#39;s from a universe where accidental pervert moments happen all the time. I imagine she&#39;s used to it, and can tell when it&#39;s an accident and when to sting somebody.<br><br>As for her home canon, I&#39;ve read Monster Musume every way possible, and tried to make a girtablilu the way Okayado would write one.<br><br>I don&#39;t think MT himself would have ushered her to the Marquis&#39;s office. The agent pushing her in is just a random agent.<br><br>Finally, I consider all of my writing to eternally be works in progress. If I find mistakes or oddments, it gets tweaked.<br><br>I thank you muchly for the Permission, though! Frabjous day, callooh, callay!<br><br>(also you made a mini-Agent.

Not that I think that&#39;s a bad thing, I hasten to add; it&#39;s always good to have nonstandard equipment on one&#39;s agents and a spade&#39;s a spade in pretty much any canon.

            <p>Hi, everyone! I&#39;m not sure if this is exactly the right time to introduce myself since I probably won&#39;t be able to post on the Board next week and I think I&#39;m gonna have to go to bed soon, but I&#39;d rather do it now for... Some reason I don&#39;t even really know.<br><br>So... I&#39;m a French (well, Corsican) guy (probably). I&#39;ve known of the PPC for about two years (I found it via TV Tropes), but I had only read missions and the wiki. I finally found enough motivation to actually read the Constitution and join the Board, so... Well, here I am!<br><br>As for my fandoms... Honestly, I&#39;m not really sure. Not counting French stuff you&#39;ve probably never heard of, I&#39;d say there are at least: Harry Potter (though I read it in French), Warriors (Also read it in French, and only until Dark River), MLP:FiM (watched until &quot;Pinkie Pride&quot;, stopped because I started to find it boring), KSP, and, uh... Hatoful Boyfriend. ._.<br><br>I don&#39;t really think I&#39;m going to write missions or anything like that, since I&#39;m still not 100% sure of my English, and I have some difficulties creating non-self-insert characters with three-dimensional personalities. At some point, I wanted to translate some missions in French, but I realized the translations would lose too much of the humor of the original version.<br><br>I can&#39;t think of anything else to say, so, uh... I think I&#39;ll stop here. Looks like I&#39;m still not good at concluding introduction posts. <sup>^</sup></p>

            <p>Cool, a frenchman! I don&#39;t think we have any other french on the board. Glad to see you aboard!<br><br>Hatoful Boyfriend. Oh man, that is the strangest little universe I have ever seen. I can definitely see the appeal for it though. I don&#39;t think there is any badfic for it though, so that&#39;s good.<br><br>OOH, another pony fan! Cool! I am the proud owner of the only agents in the All-Purpose MLP Division! Sad to see you got board of it. Hard to think that anybody would not love Pinkie Pride though. Quick question, do you know who Weird Al is? If not, that might be part of why it was not absolutely amazing. Unless it was, and you were just tired of the show before then, and decided to stop despite the amazingness that was Pinkie Pride.<br><br>Hey man, don&#39;t worry, missions are not necessary to be a member of this community. Laugh, have a good time, and we are all good here!<br><br>So, a gift. I know you drifted away from the show, but every MLP fan gets one of these, so deal with it! You get your choice of any one small crystal statue of your favorite character from MLP:FiM. Be careful though, evil shadow kings may want to get their hooves on it!</p>

            <p>I&#39;d say Hatoful Boyfriend probably has at least some badfic, since some fans are... Kinda weird. I mean, it&#39;s mostly a pigeon dating sim, it&#39;s not exactly surprising.<br>I&#39;ve actually had an idea about a character from that continuum: a former &quot;just misunderstood&quot; replacement of Shuu Iwamine that has been recruited and works in the Medical department.<br><br>Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that. Even though I&#39;m currently not planning on getting Permission and writing missions, I&#39;ve still got some ideas for my potential characters, just in case I end up wanting to write some PPC stuff. That&#39;s definitely gonna be in a long while if it even happens, though.<br><br>Oh, and, if anyone wants to use this character, go ahead, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to write him correctly anyway.</p>

            <p>But being a native speaker, I can’t resist krautpicking (nah, it isn’t French).<br><br>&quot;<i>Aus</i>&quot;may be a typo, it translates to &quot;out&quot;, not to &quot;in&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, or &quot;to&quot;.<br><br>&quot;<i>Den</i>&quot; is the wrong case (accusative, used with prepositions for target location), it should be &quot;<i>dem</i>&quot; (dative, used with prepositions for current location). But since &quot;<i>den</i>&quot; would also be the wrong grammatical gender (male) referring to the grammatical neutral noun &quot;<i>Forum</i>&quot;, it may be just another typo.<br><br>&quot;Welcome to the Forum&quot; should probably translate to &quot;<i>Willkommen im Forum</i>&quot;, shortened from &quot;<i>Willkommen in dem Forum</i>&quot;. This assumes that the Forum is considered to be an enclosed space in the world-wide web. But considering that the original Forum Romanum was an open-air place, &quot;<i>Willkommen auf dem Forum</i>&quot; would not be wrong. Surprisingly, the most literal translation, &quot;<i>Willkommen zu dem Forum</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>Willkommen zum Forum</i>&quot; implies that the Forum is an event of limited duration.<br><br>Also, we usually only capitalize nouns and the first letter of a sentence, but capitalizing every word in a subject/title for emphasis is neither wrong nor necessary.<br><br>Bienvenue, domirossi.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>No, it’s not like &quot;this here and that over there&quot;; the example just coincidentally looks like it might be. <br><br>Essentially, it’s more than a dozen variations of the article &quot;the&quot;, depending on grammatical gender and depending on whether the article is applied to the subject or to the object – and which kind of object – of a sentence.<br><br>Firstly, we have three grammatical genders, which may or may not correspond to biological gender:<br>The man – <i><b>der</b> Mann</i> (definitely male)<br>The woman – <i><b>die</b> Frau</i> (definitely female)<br>The child – <i><b>das</b> Kind</i> (gender is unknown, irrelevant or just not specified)<br>The men – <i><b>die</b> Mдnner</i> (the plural form of the article looks like the female form, but is something different and doesn’t depend on gender)<br><br>Secondly, these are only the nominative forms of the article; there are also:<br>The man’s coat – <i>der Mantel <b>des</b> Mannes</i> (male subject, male genitive object, genitive objects are generally an answer to the question &quot;whose?&quot;)<br>The woman’s coat – <i>der Mantel <b>der</b> Frau</i> (the female genitive article looks like the male nominative article, but is something different)<br>The child’s coat – <i>der Mantel <b>des</b> Kindes</i> (the neutral genitive article looks like the male genitive article)<br>The men’s coat – <i>der Mantel <b>der</b> Mдnner</i> (the plural genitive article looks like the female genitive article, and this single coat is collective property because I don’t want to bother you with another plural)<br>The coat belongs to the man – <i>Der Mantel gehцrt <b>dem</b> Mann</i> (male subject, male dative object, dative objects are generally answers to the question “to whom?”)<br>The coat belongs to the woman – <i>Der Mantel gehцrt <b>der</b> Frau</i> (the female dative article again looks like the male nominative article, but is something different)<br>The coat belongs to the child – <i>Der Mantel gehцrt <b>dem</b> Kind</i> (the neutral dative article again looks like the male dative article)<br>The coat belongs to the men – <i>Der Mantel gehцrt <b>den</b> Mдnnern</i> (the plural dative article looks like the male accusative article shown below)<br>Ginny kissed the man – <i>Ginny kьsste <b>den</b> Mann</i> (male accusative object, accusative objects are generally answers to the question “whom?”)<br>Harry kissed the woman – <i>Harry kьsste <b>die</b> Frau</i> (the female accusative article looks like the female nominative article)<br>Molly kissed the child – <i>Molly kьsste <b>das</b> Kind</i> (the neutral accusative article looks like the neutral nominative article)<br>Molly kissed the children – <i>Molly kьsste <b>die</b> Kinder</i> (the plural accusative article looks like the plural nominative article)<br><br>So these are the basics, and then some confusion arises, because many animals of unspecified biological gender acquire a default grammatical gender, like:<br>The dog – <i><b>der</b> Hund</i> is always male, unless she is <i><b>die</b> Hьndin</i> (specifically female, not a slur in German)<br>The cat – <i><b>die</b> Katze</i> is always female, unless he is <i><b>der</b> Kater</i> (specifically male)<br>But the pig – <i><b>das</b> Schwein</i> is grammatically neutral, unless it is either the boar – <i><b>der</b> Eber</i> (specifically male) or the sow – <i><b>die</b> Sau</i> (specifically female).<br><br>To increase confusion, things and abstract concepts aren’t all neutral; their grammatical gender is quite arbitrary, like:<br>The exit – <i><b>der</b> Ausgang</i> (male)<br>The door – <i><b>die</b> Tьr</i> (female)<br>The gate – <i><b>das</b> Tor</i> (neutral)<br><br>And there are additional rules and exceptions I habitually apply, but don’t remember exactly, like the usage with certain prepositions indicating current location or target location in the original example.<br><br>There is a lot to learn. I hope I didn’t discourage you.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>That is a lot more information than I was expecting. It&#39;s interesting, though, so thanks! A guy I&#39;m beta-reading for told me that German is fairly easy to learn if you can figure out the articles, and I see what he was talking about. It doesn&#39;t help that there aren&#39;t that many distinct words, but learned as a progression through the cases for each gender, it should be possible to keep them straight until one gets a feel for it.<br><br>I am not discouraged.

            <p>I studied German for six years straight; I had to commit &#39;der-die-das-die, den-die-das-die&#39; etc to memory. (We learnt nominative and accusative first, because it means you can construct simple sentences - &#39;Die Frau kьsste den Mann&#39; - and we were doing verbs and nouns at the same time. Dative I also remember learning, though bizarrely genitive has completely slipped from my mind. We must have used it, right? You... you can&#39;t go six years without anyone owning or having anything, right?)<br><br>German has always struck me as a nice, sensible language. The cases are all distinct (none of this &#39;oh, yeah, accusative is merged with nominative, and everything else is expressed through extra words&#39;, yes, I&#39;m looking at you, <i>English</i>), and helpfully, it&#39;s almost entirely phonetic. I have a soft spot for words I can read and pronounce without having to randomly drop letters everywhere (yes, I&#39;m looking at you, <i>French</i>).<br><br>That said: stars above, I&#39;m glad English got rid of grammatical gender. Best move we ever made.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>In some parts of Germany the genitive is unknown, and is replaced by a dative construct, like you would say &quot;the coat of the man&quot; instead of &quot;the man’s coat&quot;. Apparently this habit is spreading all over Germany these days. The dative is the Death of Genitives. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>No offense to any French speakers on the Board, of course, but dang, your words are hard to tell how to pronounce just by looking at them. *noms bologna*<br><br>I enjoyed Spanish and am liking Latin; phonetic languages take a nice bit of work off thanks to not worrying about pronunciation (though there are still kids in my Latin class who don&#39;t know a V is pronounced like a W... *sigh*).  Anyhow, I&#39;d like to take German in college since I couldn&#39;t fit it in my schedule this year. My dad is fairly fluent since he used to make frequent stops in Cologne, but I never picked up more than a smattering of words here and there.<br><br>Also, how much harder do you think the English language would be if it included gender differentiations? It&#39;s already weird enough... <br><br>Another thing: Why don&#39;t we learn about the different cases in English class? Is it just because we&#39;re too bust arguing with the teacher about why Robert Frost used a specific bit of imagery in a certain poem? It seems like I&#39;ve gotten a better understanding of English from studying foreign languages. Merica, ur doin sumthin rong.</p>

            <p>Hello, I stumbled upon this lovely place by searching My Immortal and came upon your wiki. After spending about half an hour reading random pages I&#39;ve read the Original Series, The Constitution and some of the newer missions. I am a woman and prefer she/her pronouns. My fandoms are Marvel comic and movies, Lord Of The Rings, random plays/musicals and I&#39;m slowly getting into Naruto. I like to play video games and write. I haven&#39;t written fan fiction in a while (not since middle school and nobody wants to read those.)  Though I have written some original fiction. I&#39;m in high school but I want to become a translator so right now I&#39;m learning a lot of languages. Thank you for reading this and hopeful I&#39;ve included everything. </p>

            <p>The first one was... eh, not that creepy in my opinion, but I don&#39;t get a lot of subtext when I read things.<br>The second one- oh Goddess, I was almost shaking. It was literally the scariest thing I&#39;ve read since Parasite, and that&#39;s saying something. (Did I catch a Doctor Who reference there in paragraph 4?)

            <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m quite smart/knowledgeable enough to understand that first one.  I think it&#39;s implying the artist made paint using human brains, and the paint produced imagination-born monsters?<br><br>I love the second one, though!  The lead-in with the simple, common phrase as the title threw me way off-guard for what was coming.  You did a fantastic job of communicating to the reader what was going on without ever explicitly stating it.  The tone is horrifying, and you made excellent use of abusing the mechanics of writing to get the point across.  Well done!</p>

            <p>Please accept this fine supply of a new product:<br><br>Bleeport, the new Bleeprin-laced synthetic fortified wine. Should you wish to forget the inevitable passage of time as the gases your body requires to function continue to burn said flesh from the inside, this will allow you to do so in a more refined manner, with a rich, plummy nose, a full body, the slow loss of feeling in any and all extremities, and an air of cultured nonchalance, <i>sprezzatura</i> if you will.<br><br>Now, I haven&#39;t tested this batch yet, but the last one didn&#39;t blow up for ages and even then I&#39;m pretty sure I know what went wrong.
