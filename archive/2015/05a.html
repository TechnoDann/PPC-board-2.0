            <p>Almost entertainingly bad. Have any of you ever read something so bad, that it was almost funny, but fell just short of that, and it&#39;s even worse because of it? This is that. I would love to see this get taken down, but I&#39;m afraid any agent sent into this would go so far beyond insanity, they would almost come right back around to being sane. Which, while entertaining, may not exactly be the best thing for the agent. Still, if anyone tackles this, I&#39;d love to see the result.</p>

            <p>In that case, I guess now would be a good time to announce that I am now officially a total loser who has no respect for his responsibilities, sleep hours, or time-management skills.

Two words, just two little words: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2053520/1/Latias-Journey">&quot;Latias&#39; Journey.&quot;</a><br><br>&quot;With her home destroyed, Latias sets out on a journey to protect herself from the mysterious Ghost King. On the way, she encounters new friends and adventures, and wonders if perhaps the one who destroyed her city is really all that he seems.&quot; Rated: Fiction M - English - Adventure - <b>Chapters: 67 - Words: 1,237,300</b><br><br>That&#39;s right - it&#39;s ridiculously long, and more than that, it&#39;s extremely grimdark, surreal, horrifically gruesome, and so full of disturbing content that I don&#39;t think even MTV would air it if some bizarre twist of fate led to it being made into an epic TV miniseries. And yes, it&#39;s based on the Pokemon anime. <b>THE ANIME.</b> Which, IIRC, is supposed to be a <i>children&#39;s cartoon!</i> Seriously, it makes the entire Cori Falls anthology look like <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> for all I know!<br><br>I don&#39;t plan to spork this abomination immediately - an Endeavor this epic needs a metric crackton of preparation, after all - but it will be slain. Someday. I promise!</p>

            <p>Hey everyone, I&#39;m Alleb. To get right down to business, I&#39;m trying to write a realistic Tenth Walker. As a very quick rundown, my OC is named Amy, she can use a sword (fairly well, but not at the level of any of the non-hobbit Walkers, or most Rangers for that matter), has the advantage of bringing a full camping backpack to Arda, and knows Sindarin and some Quenya (what we have of either, anyway). I&#39;m trying to figure out how she will effect the plot- I really have only two solid ideas so far; she goes with Sam and Frodo when the Fellowship breaks, but remains with the Ithilien Rangers due to the temptation of the Ring, or she is captured with Merry and Pippin. I&#39;m not sure how well either thought will work- any suggestions on how she might otherwise derail the plot?</p>

Don&#39;t have her say lines that the characters use in either the books or movies. It&#39;s incredibly annoying.<br><br>Also, be careful with how she could share her knowledge of the Fellowship&#39;s future. If she does, there must be consequences. One OC I read about went with Gandalf to see Saruman, and Saruman read the girl&#39;s mind, finding out about the movies. The catch was that she wasn&#39;t sure how much he&#39;d seen, and Elrond worried that there might not even be a Fellowship.</p>

            <p>It definitely is! Awesome story- so thankful you wrote it! Feel free to write as much as you want; spiels are appreciated! The way it goes is she arrives on Weathertop a year before the Fellowship sets out, meets Kali in Bree, and everything is fine for several months. Kali falls ill a few weeks before the date of the Fellowship&#39;s departure, and Halbarad (who Amy met soon after arriving in Arda) rushes her and Amy to Rivendell. Elrond knows the sickness, and then Aragorn says that Minas Tirith has the cure- or, as Iximaz suggested, Dol Amroth does. As to how she got there, that&#39;s a little involved and I would appreciate help working out the MANY kinks. So, after Sauron was defeated in the War of the Ring, he was permanently unbodied. As this is, technically speaking, an AU, he finds an unguarded door into the Void, finds Morgoth, and the two immediately set to scheming. They are, of course, geniuses, and they realize as you did that throwing a random person into the Quest will derail everything. Now, as the Void is said to be outside time, it makes some sort of sense that one can enter, say, in the Third Age, and exit in modern day, using the Earth is an older Arda hypothesis. </p>

            <p>I’ll wander through your outlined plot in rough order. So, the arrival: surprisingly, I have no problems with it! Sauron is explicitly <i>not</i> dead after the Ring is destroyed (though he is permanently depowered). The idea that over the next six thousand (per Tolkien) years he could sneak out into the Void, and figure out a way for Melkor to get a tiny tendril of power into Arda to drop Amy back in time – sure, why not? It’s about Sauron’s level of sneakiness, too – he likes to use stealth as a blunt instrument. ‘I shall sneak my Nazgul into the Shire, then have them run around hissing at people in black cloaks! I am a <i>genius</i>!’<br><br>There’s a glorious quote from Tolkien about Sauron: <i>Gandalf he did not understand. But certainly he had already become evil, and therefore stupid, enough to imagine that his different behaviour was due simply to weaker intelligence and lack of firm masterful purpose.</i> That… really does sum the Dark Lord up.<br><br>Language is a problem. You say Amy ‘knows’ Sindarin and Quenya. For the sake of argument, I’ll assume <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">Ardalambion</a> S/Q, though any reconstruction will handle the same. The problems are three:<br><br>-While reconstructed Quenya is reasonably coherent, there are <i>no</i> native speakers of Quenya outside Valinor in the Third Age. The only person Amy will meet who grew up with it is Galadriel (and possibly Elrond, depending on what Maglor decided to raise him on). Of the Fellowship, we know Frodo has enough to say ‘hi’; Aragorn probably reads it fairly well, but may not speak it (apart from rote phrases); actually there’s a decent change that Boromir knows a little – but on the other hand, those sound like the lessons he would have ignored in favour of useful military stuff! Betcha Faramir speaks the ‘Elf Latin’. But it’s not a tongue you could use to communicate in the Third Age, is my point.<br><br>-The Dunedain speak Sindarin, as does Legolas – but <i>we don’t</i>. Sindarin is very fragmentary. Ardalambion has an article consisting basically of guesses at the verb system; we have no verb ‘to be’. Amy could probably communicate with Halbarad using nouns (<i>’I mass’</i> for ‘bread’, for instance), but that’s about it.<br><br>-And the main one… people in Arda don’t speak English! They speak Westron, and that’s going to be <i>horrendous</i> for Amy. For starters – the names are all different! She could maybe get Halbarad to take her to the Prancing Pony by asking (in Sindarin) for ‘<i>roch ylf sвd</i>’, ‘horse tankard place’, though since ‘ylf’ also means ‘brand’ she might end up at a stable which brands horses instead! But the Pony wouldn’t have a name she could understand, Bree wouldn’t be called Bree, even Barliman would actually be called something incomprehensible (‘Butterbur’ is a translation of ‘Zilbirвpha’) – she’d have no way of knowing she was in the right town! (A list of all known Westron words is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDxxk9NpuwEYZjXh-TNMsAKT8-IIF7_zkZvnhgfEklY/preview">here</a>, if you want it.)<br><br>For that matter, once she joins the Fellowship (oh yes, we’ll get there) – she’ll have very little chance of working out which is Merry and which is Pippin. Unless Razanur ‘Raz’ Tыk happens to mention his surname, how would she know?<br><br>Speaking of Westron: Kali is a boy’s name. In fact, it’s Merry’s name (and has the same meaning).<br><br>So, how to get out of this bind? Obviously you could have Sauron magically let her understand Westron, but that’s… pretty boring. So… why not learn <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/adunaic.htm">Adыnaic</a>? That’s the language Westron (Adыni, technically) is descended from; with a grasp of Adыnaic (as much as that’s possible), she could probably make herself understood – insofar as you could understand someone from the time of Chaucer. (It’s also a good language to raid for ‘Kali’s’ name – it could be an old family name. Though Bree-folk used floral words… ‘Kulbо’ means, roughly, ‘Potatoes’, if you like. Or ‘Inzil’ means ‘Flower’.)<br><br>I’ll move on from language now <sup>_<sup>.</sup></sup> If Halbarad struck up a friendship with Amy, he might well take her and ‘Kali’ to Karningul (sorry, that’s ‘Rivendell’ in the translation). And since elves aren’t magic, it’s entirely possible Elrond couldn’t cure whatever the problem is, and that there might be a southern plant that could help.<br><br>You seem to be implying Amy leaves Bree after Frodo (sorry, Maura) reached Rivendell. That should be okay; while Sauron’s got his eye on the West, he has no reason to care about Amy, ‘Kali’, and a random Dunadan. So she should be fine. The Fellowship wasn’t chosen until shortly before departure, either, so that’s okay.<br><br>(As to where the herb is found: the idea of it as a Haradrim plant is nice. Either Minas Tirith or Dol Amroth could have a stock; the Houses of Healing in M-T presumably get supplies from all over Gondor. Boromir might be a better person to say they have it – while Aragorn <i>did</i> spend time in Gondor, it was a long time ago.)<br><br>Mm… how did she get into the Fellowship? The answer has to be ‘Elrond chose to put her there’, but why? I’m going to go with ‘Boromir’; he’s the best person to escort her to Minas Tirith (and bless the Gondorians for using Sindarin names!), and he’s already said he’ll travel with the Fellowship until it’s time to break off. The idea of sending Amy along with them makes as much sense as sending Boz – this isn’t a war-party, after all! Aragorn, Legolas, and Elrond would have no problem with the fact that she was female, and in fact would be baffled at the suggestion that there <i>could</i> be a problem. Not sure about Boz or the hobbits, and I know Gimli (for <i>his</i> name, see <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Deep16.htm">here</a>) would have issues – the dwarves protect their women (because there’s less of them).<br><br>But of course, that messes with the ‘Nine’. In this case, I suggest my ‘Tenth Walkers’ Pippin idea – Elrond toyed with the idea of sending Pip (Raz) back to the Shire as a messenger, so in this case, he should do it! Only this is Pippin we’re talking about – he would absolutely chase after the Fellowship anyway. And I doubt Gandalf (no Westron name, ‘Mithrandir’ is ever-useful) would send him back once he’d arrived…<br><br>So, how could she impact the plot? She’s read the book, right? Here’s some ideas:<br><br>-Tell Gandalf what’s in Moria. There’s… not really an alternate path to take (Caradhras rejected them, the High Pass is full of orcs, the Gap of Rohan is full of Saruman), so I suspect Gandalf would still go through. He might even still die – I mean, knowing there’s a balrog doesn’t do you a lot of good when <i>it’s a balrog</i>. But it’s something she might well do.<br><br>-If she <i>doesn’t</i>… well, Galadriel can read minds! She can also speak Quenya, which means that unless Amy is very good with languages (ie, she’s picked up more than just very rudimentary Westron), Galadriel is one of the few people she can hold an actual conversation with. The Lady of Lorien would probably take the time to do so, as well – she’s pretty nice like that. Though don’t expect her to try and make Amy feel <i>better</i> - if she deserves to feel guilty, the woman whose mother named her ‘Man-Maid’ is going to make sure she <i>does</i>. Nicely, of course. <sup>_~<br><br>-The</sup> reason the Fellowship sailed down Anduin was to avoid making a decision as where to go. The reason Boromir didn’t go off by himself was that he wanted to take the Ring to Minas Tirith, though he didn’t really talk about that much. If Boz fastened his hopes onto something else – say, Amy, who’s given away several times that she <i>knows the future</i> - he might well have gone straight from Lorien to Gondor. Then the Fellowship would be able to… let me check a map.<br><br>Right, the best route if you’re <i>not</i> hesitating about where to go is across Anduin as high up as possible, then down through the Brown Lands to the northern Ash Mountains. With Aragorn in charge, they probably wouldn’t aim for the Black Gate – and with Gimli on hand, they might well be able to find a way through the northern mountains. With the Fellowship on a different path, and Boromir back in Gondor with a genuine Seer (and there’s precedent for those – Glorfindel prophesied the Witch-King’s manner of death, and Malbeth the Seer predicted Aragorn’s trip through the Paths of the Dead) – but with no March of the Ents – it’s anyone’s guess how the War of the Ring would fall out.<br><br>But let’s say you don’t want to do that (you should, though!). You’ve got your Amelia!Sue available to meddle things back into line, so you can use that to drive the Fellowship down to Rauros. Then what happens?<br><br>Um… Amy doesn’t go with Frodo. Sam only manages because, well, he’s Sam, and Frodo needs him. Unless Amy somehow kept track of him in the forest (and she wouldn’t, he’s a hobbit), she’d have no chance of catching him at the boats. Unless, I guess, she used her foreknowledge and went straight there? But Frodo wouldn’t have taken a boat if he was being watched, and I don’t know what he’d’ve done instead.<br><br>She also doesn’t get captured with M&amp;P. Why would she? The orcs were looking for <i>halflings</i>. They’d just kill her.<br><br>Which means she’s there with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli when everything’s over. And <i>that</i> could be quite a change: with four people, Aragorn would be able to split the team up. Two could go after Frodo and Sam, and two after Merry and Pippin. I think he probably would, too, though what the divisions would be, I’m not sure.<br><br>Alternately, he might still deem the Ring beyond their help – but decide to set out for Minas Tirith directly himself. I believe he says in canon that he’ll take up Boromir’s responsibility to defend the city. That would mean a trip directly down Anduin – and he would probably take Amy with him (since that’s where <i>she’s</i> heading), leaving Legolas and Gimli to hunt Merry and Pip.<br><br>At that point, the story is pretty stable – most of the actors are in the right places. Aragorn wouldn’t look in the Palantir, so Sauron wouldn’t attack as early, which would mean that Mordor wouldn’t empty as Frodo and Sam arrived. You also wouldn’t have the Paths of the Dead – which means the Corsairs would reach Minas Tirith. But they’d do so long before Sauron’s army did, and could probably be defeated.<br><br>But let’s say you didn’t want to do <i>that</i>… and this is the thing. We could keep rejecting possible changes until the cows come home, but ultimately, you <i>want</i> to change the plot. The only question is where.<br><br>(That was three pages. En… joy?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m SO thankful you like her method of transport- I was quite nervous about that. Actually, Amy *is* learning Westron. The Professor said in one of his letters that the language of the hobbits was very similar to English, and since I don&#39;t have any form of grammar I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s mostly the same (albeit with a few quirks) and an entirely different vocabulary. So far, I&#39;ve written it as if the names were English simply because we don&#39;t have all the names in Westron. I really like Inzil! Thank you so much- the word list I used didn&#39;t have that on there. Kali&#39;s real name is actually Hamanullas (small white flower), but everyone just calls her Kali. I know it&#39;s Merry&#39;s name, but since it&#39;s just a nickname I thought it might work- but I like Inzil much better. (On a sidenote, when I was first read Lord of the Rings, I had NO idea Merry was a boy until Crickhollow. I thought all along it was &quot;Mary.&quot;)<br>So, up until now my thought was that Amy&#39;s memories of the plot were erased when she arrived, but if you don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good plan it can very easily be tweaked. My idea had been that the only being other than Eru who really knows the future (beyond predictions and visions) is Mandos; and he&#39;s meant to be the only one. So it would make some sense that she would loose these memories when she arrived. <br>Okay.. I left something big out. I really shouldn&#39;t have, and I apologize- Amy is mute. I feel that&#39;s her most Suish characteristic, and I sort of hesitate to bring it out. She&#39;s teaching Inzil sign language, of course. So when she meets Halbarad, she&#39;s actually communicating in broken tengwar on a notepad she brought and bad Sindarin that she barely remembers from learning it as a teenager; I said &#39;know&#39; because she remembers most of it later on, and I didn&#39;t know how fractured the language was. I actually thought we had a lot less of Quenya- grammar and vocabulary both -than we did of Sindarin. <br>Oh, another thought- Amy hasn&#39;t read the books for roughly ten years. So she might remember a couple things,or accidentally give false information, or any other host of possibilities. Speaking of possibilities, I had planned for there to be some hints of romance between Boromir and Amy- and in some of these plot ideas, he would live, and it could be given lots of time to mature, which I like. What do you think? <br>I love the three pages! Thank you so much! Your knowledge is awesome, and I doff my cap to you *bows*. I plan to implement quite a few of these ideas. You&#39;ve been immensely helpful!</p>

            <p>(Btw, it would help with reading your posts if you double-space your paragraphs. Ta.)<br><br>Westron... um... well, the grammar <i>might</i> be the same as English, I guess. But the vocab is wildly different - it bears literally no resemblance to English. So I&#39;m not sure that&#39;d help!<br><br>Inzil is, I hope I made clear, an Adunaic name - it would be a <i>very</i> old name in the Third Age. Sort of like calling your kid... um... okay, &#39;any name out of the Bible&#39;, I suppose. <sup>_^</sup> We know that Westron retains the &#39;z&#39; sound, so it&#39;s probably a valid word in Westron. (Nicknaming her Kali - well, why not? Will probably cause confusion when she meets Kalimac the Hobbit.)<br><br>I would definitely use &#39;actual&#39; names if you possibly can - we&#39;ve got more of them than you might think! The only lands you&#39;re spending time in that don&#39;t use an elvish language are Bree and Rohan (if you go there). Bree itself might be tricky to name (or just call it &#39;the village&#39;), or she could simply use the English name in narrative out of habit. The Pony is an actual translation, so it&#39;s okay to re-translate to English. And Rohan - well, we actually have Theoden&#39;s real name, Tыrac!<br><br>(You know, many years ago, I&#39;m pretty sure I thought Merry was a girl. You can imagine my surprise when Bombadil told them all to strip! Not sure where I caught on, actually...)<br><br>I think wiping Amy&#39;s memory is... mm, dubious. For one, surely Sauron would <i>want</i> her to keep it? For two, knowing the future changes it - so the &#39;future&#39; Amy knows isn&#39;t the one she&#39;ll encounter. For three... it removes any justification I can come up with for Elrond to send her along. Every one of the Nine Walkers has a good reason to be there - Amy wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>I&#39;ve <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Beyond5.htm">speculated here</a> about how a girl who knows (partly!) the book could interact with Middle-earth. Feel free to crib anything you like from it. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Mute</sup></sup> is an... interesting character trait. Certainly gets round the pronunciation problem! I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d think it&#39;s particularly Suish, though - yes, it&#39;s unusual, but unusual doesn&#39;t have to be bad. Just make sure you give her both the positives and the negatives, and she&#39;ll be fine.<br><br>Well, &#39;fine&#39;, at least. Tengwar are, again, moderately obsolete - Frodo recognises them as letters on the Ring, but doesn&#39;t even try to translate them even phonetically. Most people (including Gandalf) use the runes of Daeron - and no-one bothers to learn them at this end of time, because they&#39;re boring. ;) But sign language... I understand the &#39;words&#39; are ideagraphic, rather than phonetic in any sense. So yes, Inzil/Kali could probably understand a sign for chicken just as well (or badly) as an English speaker. Um... might make things difficult when she&#39;s with the Fellowship, though.<br><br>The thing about Quenya and Sindarin is that, um, Tolkien preferred Quenya. He wrote poems in it; he didn&#39;t do that much in Sindarin. So we have a lot more Quenya to hand, though I think (may be wrong) the longest single passage is the Sindarin <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/King%27s_Letter">King&#39;s Letter</a>. The one people learn is usually Quenya, though that said, there&#39;s a few books about Sindarin; maybe she had a copy of David Salo&#39;s <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/A_Gateway_to_Sindarin">A Gateway to Sindarin</a>!<br><br>Ultimately, the plot is up to you (obviously!). My main piece of advice is to consider the consequences of what you&#39;re doing! If Amy breaks her leg in Moria, the Fellowship is slowed down, don&#39;t get to Balin&#39;s Tomb before the orcs catch them, and have to fight in the open - even when the balrog arrives. If Amy urges them to bypass Lorien, the whole story takes place a month sooner - so they probably don&#39;t get ambushed at Rauros. Heck, if Amy&#39;s chatting with Boromir while Frodo&#39;s off thinking, Boromir wouldn&#39;t go after him, and Frodo would come to a decision of his own. You could even start the story <i>right there</i>, with no earlier changes, and fill in her backstory along the way!<br><br>(And what would Frodo decide? Very difficult to say. He&#39;s avoided making decisions at all previous points, though he <i>has</i> shown a tendency towards self-sacrifice. He might well slip off by himself while the others wait - but with eight members of the Fellowship still behind, and the fact that Frodo wasn&#39;t the one who thought of breaking the boats, at least some of them could go after him. Call the chapter &#39;The Parting of the Fellowship&#39; and send Boromir and Amy off to Minas Tirith - see where <i>that</i> gets you.)<br><br>I have no problems with a well-done Boromance (though Acacia probably would have!). Remember that a deadly hike probably isn&#39;t the best place for it to get serious, though! Letting the Quest portion be her slow (sloooow) growth in admiration for him, and its development into something more - and working out a reason for <i>him</i> to like <i>her</i> - is probably the best way to go, yes.<br><br>I think this version was less than three pages? Noooot sure...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>In regards to the names, I think I might have her give the Westron name, if she can, but then use the English afterwards. It&#39;s what she would be most comfortable with (me too),  and my keyboard can&#39;t make the punctuation needed for Westron, so it would be very time consuming to have to copy paste practically everything. <br><br>You&#39;re right, the memory wipe was rather dubious. I&#39;ll change it, although that also impacts how she&#39;ll meet Halbarad; originally, he came across her on Wethertop after her memory was erased; she was lying in a sort of daze, remembering her life slowly. It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to fix though. <br><br>I really, really like your piece on Lucy- Amy is similar, but she&#39;ll probably remember even less. And you&#39;re right, Sauron would want her to keep her knowledge of the future; he and Morgoth picked her partially for her pride, and I can easily see her trying to &quot;fix&quot; things like Gandalf&#39;s death, Boromir&#39;s sacrifice, and the Breaking of the Fellowship, thinking she&#39;s doing exactly what&#39;s needed.<br><br>Also, I need your advice on another aspect of her muteness; how would Elves react to her? I mean (correct me if I&#39;m wrong) the early Elves differentiated themselves from animals by their ability to speak- calling themselves the Quendi and all. So far, I think pity would be pretty prevalent- language is dear to them, after all. But I think there might be some squeamishness (if Elves get squeamish.)<br><br>*yelps and hides from Acacia* <br><br>Deadly hike.. That&#39;s incredibly accurate, actually. Um, could I use that? <br><br>Just as a test scenario, let&#39;s say Amy (after proving her Seer status) warns Elrond and Gandalf that the latter will die in Moria, and they can&#39;t go over Caradhras. She forgets about Sauraman, and the two Wise ones conclude that the Fellowship must travel through the Gap of Rohan (Gandalf of course knows that Sauraman is a bad egg, but for the purposes of the test scenario let&#39;s say they go through the Gap anyway). Because their trajectory is altered, they don&#39;t see any crebain, and they try to sneak past Isengard. Plot twist; Merry and Pippin are captured by Orcs. The Fellowship breaks right there, with Gandalf still alive. Without seriously analyzing the situation, I would say that Gandalf takes Aragorn and Legolas with him and attempts to sneak in and rescue the hobbits. The other five can&#39;t dither, so they set off for Rohan. What do you think?<br></p>

            <p>... I tend to forgive missing accents. It&#39;s not like people are going to actually be pronouncing things! But I see your point, and if it&#39;s narrative voice, that&#39;s excusable. Dialogue... eh, I suppose since the whole thing&#39;s translated into English anyway, you can probably get away with it. Makes me twitchy though.<br><br>As a general rule, anything I&#39;ve presented as an <i>idea</i> is there for anyone to use; I&#39;m not possessive. Nicking entire chunks of story, yes, that&#39;s bad, but ideas are free from me. (As are turns of phrase, so yes, you can have &#39;deadly hike&#39;. <sup>_<sup>)<br><br>Very</sup></sup> interesting thoughts about &#39;Quendi&#39;; you&#39;re kind of right. I think you&#39;d get pity, definitely, but with an undercurrent of... something between shock and horror. Not <i>at her</i>, but at the idea that <i>that can happen</i>. Remember, Arda was created out of a song; the most &#39;holy&#39; thing elves do is sing hymns to Elbereth; they (Legolas) <s>anthropo</s>eldathromorphisise things to the extent that he speaks of stones talking to him. Someone without a voice is... yeah, that could hit them hard. (Of course, on the flip side, they will be <i>delighted</i> by sign language; it&#39;s a sort of &#39;even one without a voice can still speak by the skill of her hands&#39; thing. If you go for a lighthearted tone, I can imagine it becoming something of a fad in Imladris - only, of course, the elves will improve it rapidly beyond Amy&#39;s understanding!)<br><br>The Saruman scenario: well, given that Gandalf&#39;s been locked up by Saruman, it&#39;s hard to imagine why he&#39;d do that. But suppose he does. The <i>crebain</i> are a misdirection; they knew they were being watched anyway! I think the movieverse suggests they were aiming for the Gap of Rohan until the crows changed their mind, but the book is quite clear about what the plan was.<br><br>So, they sneak across Dunland, which is hostile to, um, everyone, but particularly blondes. <sup>_~</sup> They reach the Gap. They can basically be invisible in the open countryside - but they have to cross the Fords of Isen. That&#39;s the only choke-point in the entire plan. Heck, after that, they&#39;re home free in Rohan! But...<br><br>... y&#39;know, if you fiddle the timeline a little (maybe they leave Rivendell later, or they have a lot of trouble in Dunland), you could get them there juuuust before the Battle of the Fords of Isen on February 25th. So they reach the fords, meet Theodred (crown prince of Rohan, still alive!)... and then the &#39;fighting Uruk-hai&#39; descend.<br><br>So you have the fellowship at the BFI. They probably contribute a great deal, especially with Gandalf present. And, yeah, I can see Merry and Pippin getting taken. Gandalf/Aragorn would be keeping an eye on Frodo, and Sam wouldn&#39;t leave his side, but the other two might stray into the path of the orcs. And if Saruman&#39;s told his leaders to take any halflings (to figure out what Gandalf&#39;s up to with them and the Ring)... yes, it works.<br><br>But... I don&#39;t think Gandalf would go after them. For that matter, I don&#39;t think there&#39;d be a stealth mission - you&#39;ve got a victorious army of Rohan close at hand, and Saruman&#39;s armies have just been wiped out!<br><br>I think Gandalf, Frodo, and Sam (at least) would head for Edoras - quite possibly on Shadowfax, since they&#39;re in his area now. Aragorn and Boromir would team up with Theodred to try and take out Isengard (they both feel loyalty to Rohan as an ally of Gondor). Legolas would go with them for the sake of the hobbits. Gimli... well, it&#39;s a coin toss. And Amy... depends whether she cares more about Boromir or Kali, really. She might stick with Boz, on the principle that Gandalf won&#39;t be stopping at Minas Tirith (though he&#39;ll have to pass pretty close).<br><br>As to whether they&#39;d succeed... uh, probably yes. Saruman&#39;s just thrown away his army. But the Rohirrim would have to occupy Isengard - they can&#39;t get into Orthanc to drag him out - and they need a leader who can resist the Voice of Saruman. That might be Theodred, or it might have to be Aragorn or Legolas. It might even be Boromir - but we know he <i>is</i> susceptible to temptation, so that&#39;s only a good choice if you (the writer) want things to go wrong. <sup>_<sup><br><br>(As</sup></sup> ever, these are just ideas. You can take them or leave them as you please - it&#39;s not <b>my</b> story!)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll include Westron names as much as I can, but in the long run I think it&#39;ll just be too time consuming. <br><br>I had actually thought of something really similar with the &quot;sign language fad&quot; in Imladris. I really like the fast advancement; I knew they&#39;d learn it quickly, but the improvement idea is really cool. I can easily imagine, a few days after teaching them the really basic grammar and a few signs, she&#39;s walkng around and she realizes that they&#39;ve made up their own home signs, their own, more advanced grammar, and they&#39;ve nuanced the facial expressions to such an extent that she can barely understand what they&#39;re saying. Perfect. That&#39;ll also be handy during the Quest, as Legolas will be able to translate what Amy is signing. I can see different members of the Fellowship having their own interest in it too- like Aragorn would want to learn some basic signs to use, say, while hunting, so as not to scare the game. I think the hobbits might try it, and Frodo might even pursue if a little, but the rest would probably fall off the bandwagon. The dwarves, of course, have their own hand gestures, if I remember correctly.<br><br>Speaking of, how would you handle Gimli&#39;s reaction to Amy&#39;s going on the quest? I don&#39;t want him to come across as that one mysoginistic (I hope I spelled that correctly) character, but he would definitely have some objections. <br><br>Which reminds me, what term would everyone use for Amy? Most of the fics I&#39;ve read use &quot;Lady,&quot; but it seems distinctly WRONG to use the same honorific for Lady Galadriel and a random OC. Just.. No. Mistress sounds off, Madame doesn&#39;t sound plausible. Miss, maybe? The hobbits might use that one. <br><br>Man, your knowledge of Tolkien is seriously impressive. I apologize for my mistake with the crebain; I&#39;ve seen the movies more recently than I&#39;ve read the books, so they&#39;re a lot closer to mind. The test scenario would be interesting, although you&#39;re probably right to assume that Gandalf wouldn&#39;t  want to go through the Gap, despite what Amy says. Like what you mentioned of Elrond- if Imladris fell but the Ring was destroyed -I wonder if Gandalf might still view it as a victory if he died but the Fellowship got through Moria safely. <br><br>Ooh, I just realized- if the Fellowship doesn&#39;t go through Moria and then Lorien, both Sam and Frodo will probably die in Mount Doom. If they just went through Moria, they&#39;d pick up Gollum but not Eдrendil&#39;s light. Thus, Gollum would lead them to Shelob and they probably wouldn&#39;t be able to fend her off. If they don&#39;t go through Moria Gollum won&#39;t be there to lead them through Shelob, so they&#39;ll avoid her, but when it comes time to destroy the Ring, who will get it done? IF Frodo can do it on his own, somehow, they&#39;d be fine- but he couldn&#39;t do that. Sam would have to do it, or push him in, probably killing himself in the process. Goodness. Things certainly do snowball, don&#39;t they?<br><br>Oh, also, I had a question about Amy&#39;s life after the War. (And if I&#39;m talking too much or bothering you, please tell me- you&#39;ve  been incredibly helpful and I don&#39;t want to blather on if you&#39;re getting tired of me. You seem like a very important person within the PPC, and I&#39;m quite a newbie.)<br>My current idea is that she becomes a guard to the newly crowned Queen. Other than that, I had in mind maybe a few mysteries playing out in Minas Tirith, with Amy playing the part of detective. What do you think?</p>

            <p>You seem to have things well in hand.<br><br>Aragorn learning simple signs is probably fair (and Legolas learning them to talk to Amy is a great idea). You&#39;re right about the hobbits, too. As for Gimli: yep, they have, though we don&#39;t know them and I doubt they share. Which would kind of add to Gimli&#39;s discomfort with Amy - she&#39;s just going to <i>use</i> this stuff? Like, out in the <i>open</i>?<br><br>I think to handle Gimli, you need to let his objections be those of a <i>dwarf</i>, not a misogynistic human. He&#39;s not going to go on about how Amy&#39;s weak, or how it&#39;s indecent for her to fight, or how she should be in the kitchen. He&#39;s not going to say she should be &#39;seen and not heard&#39; - we&#39;ve never seen any hint that that&#39;s true of dwarves.<br><br>Actually, he probably won&#39;t <i>object</i>, per se. He knows that other races don&#39;t do things the same. But it would be like... oh, if you were a Christian who prays over every meal, before every serious discussion, and as a household three times a day. You wouldn&#39;t <i>tell off</i> your non-Christian friends for not doing those things while you were staying over - but it would make you feel kind of uncomfortable to have things change like that. Depending on what sort of person you were, you might end up praying more yourself, for comfort of a sort - or praying more loudly so they can all hear it.<br><br>I don&#39;t see Gimli as the passive-aggressive sort, so I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s more likely to just... act &#39;more dwarvish&#39;. Maybe he could get really into examining rocks as they walked. <sup>_<sup><br><br>So</sup></sup> yes: I&#39;d make him kind of twitchy around Amy (and the sign language would only make that worse!), and quick to assume people were making fun of dwarvish customs - but not liable to grunt &#39;well, you&#39;d expect that of a <i>female</i>&#39; or whatever. (It might make him less likely to befriend Legolas, though...)<br><br>Honorifics... hmm.<br><br>-Legolas probably wouldn&#39;t use one. He doesn&#39;t call anyone else by an honorific, and elves in general don&#39;t go much in for them. Note that Legolas isn&#39;t called, say, &#39;Prince Legolas&#39; at any point.<br>-Neither would Gandalf, for much the same reasons.<br>-Aragorn... hrm. He does call Eowyn &#39;Lady&#39;, I think, but she&#39;s nobility... as a better guide, how does he address Ioreth in the Houses of Healing? If he uses something like &#39;Mistress&#39;, then yes, &#39;Miss&#39; is possible. Or, again, just don&#39;t use them.<br>-Boromir... what does he do with the hobbits? Just call them by name? The same, then. Since he does say &#39;the halflings&#39; on occasion, I can see him using &#39;the woman&#39; about her - but equally &#39;the elf&#39;, &#39;the dwarf&#39;, and &#39;the wizard&#39;.<br>-Gimli would probably <i>want</i> to use &#39;daughter of&#39; or &#39;mother of&#39; (note that the only named female dwarf is known solely as Fili and Kili&#39;s mother), but he doesn&#39;t know them. <sup>_^</sup> I&#39;d look to how he addresses Merry and Pippin for guidance, here.<br>-The hobbits... well, Sam would use &#39;Miss&#39;, or even &#39;Lady&#39; if he thinks she&#39;s impressive. <sup>_~</sup> Frodo would probably call her by name. Merry and Pippin... I&#39;m guessing would follow his lead.<br><br>(I try my best to be impressive. <sup>_^</sup> No need to apologise for mistakes, though - we all make them!)<br><br>Snowballs - yes, definitely. Essentially, any successful quest needs to give Frodo both a guide and a helper: a guide to actually get him into Mordor, and a helper to get him to the Cracks and help him throw the Ring away. Without those two, he wouldn&#39;t make it. In the books, that&#39;s Gollum and Sam (or Gollum again!); in an AU, it could be anyone. Perhaps Gimli guides them in, then Frodo knocks Merry into the fire and Pippin gets the Ring while he&#39;s distraught over it; perhaps Gandalf sneaks them through the mountains, and Boromir fights with Frodo for the Ring, sending them both over. One thing is certain: most scenarios require at least one person to die on Mount Doom.<br><br>(The one that doesn&#39;t? Sam carries the Ring to the mountain. He&#39;s the only person on the Quest who willingly gave the thing up. He could do it. Sam is awesome.)<br><br>Assuming the Quest completes at all, Amy as a guard/companion to Arwen makes sense - and solving mysteries could be really fun to read. <sup>_^</sup> Though bear in mind that the snowball effect is still in play; if Boromir lives, he&#39;ll become a major player in Gondorian politics - and if <i>Denethor</i> lives, you&#39;ve got a whole new dynamic, with the established ruler feeling very threatened by the upcoming war-hero king. Yikes. (That could make for some conflict between Amy and Boz - he&#39;s very like his father, and if Denethor is moderately anti-Elessar... yup.) But yes, as long as you keep the snowball in mind, it could work well.<br><br>(&#39;Important person within the PPC&#39;... heh. I prefer to think of myself as important <i>to</i> the PPC, given that I&#39;m the mostly-self-appointed keeper of traditions. But I&#39;m not an important person - just a walking encyclopaedia. <sup>_^</sup> And one who never minds talking LotR, so you&#39;ve nothing to fear on that score.)<br><br>hS<br><br>(I didn&#39;t say less, did I? Oops.)</p>

            <p>:D Yay! I&#39;m glad you think so; I hope I do. I VERY much want this story to be good. I think &#39;more dwarvish&#39; is perfect— but I really don&#39;t want to interfere with the friendship between Legolas and Gimil. In my opinion, it&#39;s one of the most beautiful things Tolkien wrote, and I&#39;d like to keep it intact. So.. How about this? My Sue shows up, violently switching everything to movie verse. Amy had a bubble of book verse, but it&#39;s not as strong, so she can&#39;t turn any one back if Amelia is focused on them. But, as per the usual, the Sue has ignored Gimli. As long as he and Amy are within seeing distance (barring unusually good conditions or very flat ground) he remains his book self. This forces them to band together. Over the course of their adventure within an adventure, he realizes that Amy really needs the sign language to communicate, and that there&#39;s no viable alternative. He&#39;s still not totally comfortable with it, or with the fact that she&#39;s female, but it should open the door back up for friendship with Legolas, I think. <br><br>Thanks for the help with the honorifics! I&#39;ll look up all the necessary exchanges. Just calling her &quot;Lady Amy&quot; all the time didn&#39;t seem right, but I like the idea of Sam being impressed and calling her that. If they go through Lorien he&#39;d probably stop though. I doubt it&#39;s possible to look at Lady Galadriel and then go on calling Amy the same thing. <br><br>Hmm.. I think I&#39;ll just have to firm up the alternate route before I figure out who dies. I wonder.. The movies are messing up my memory. In the book, did the Orcs simply find the Fellowship, or did Pippin accidentally alert them? If it&#39;s the latter, and Amy warns them of the balrog, they might be able to go through Moria undetected. That would leave Gandalf alive, most likely preventing Boromir from attacking Frodo, and then more of the Fellowship might head to Mount Doom. They&#39;d still have Gollum, so none of the Fellowship would have to die at the Cracks, although someone might along the way. <br><br>I&#39;m glad you like my after-the-War idea; most of these stories just end when Aragorn is crowned king, but I want to go beyond. Yes, I&#39;d thought about that; it&#39;d be very interesting to have Denethor alive, and I think he would be if Boromir lived. I hadn&#39;t considered the tension between Amy and Boz, but I like it; life isn&#39;t all sunshine and fluffy one-shots, after all! They&#39;re bound to butt heads sometime. <br><br>I dunno, I&#39;ve looked at the lore some and you and your agents have done some pretty big stuff. Not to mention helped with various FAQs and guides, which were VERY useful to me, I might add; it really helped assuage some of my nervousness, knowing what to expect and what I might want to start off by saying in the community. <br><br>Awesome! I just wanted to make sure, because I&#39;ve been asking question after question after question, which could get really old after a while. I also have a penchant for talking too much, which can be quite annoying.</p>

            <p>Amelia as a way of making Gimli and Amy get on: sounds good to me.<br><br>Moria: Pip threw stones down the well in the guardroom and woke Something - the orcs and the balrog. It&#39;s quite possible they could&#39;ve crept through had he not.<br><br>The Fellowship would probably part in Lorien, with Aragorn and Boromir going directly to Minas Tirith; the others might well all go with Frodo to Mordor.

            <p>I actually do have a question. So, as I mentioned before, I have a thing with language. I&#39;d really like to just dive in and read all the missions I can, but it&#39;s hard to tell on most if there will be any cursing or not (at least as far as my experience has gone, that is the case). Do you have any suggestions? I&#39;d like to read in the LotR continua, and HP is good too. For a bit of a threshold, I started reading the Original Series a while back, and stopped because I felt that it cursed too much. I&#39;ve recently picked it back up again, although it&#39;s still a *little* heavy for my tastes. </p>

            <p>You&#39;ll find very little cursing in <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Agents.htm">any of my missions</a>.

            <p>I just think it&#39;s really great what you all have made the PPC. Originally, when I first found it, I was rather unsure of it for one reason- I thought you were all united by the hate of Mary Sues. Since then, I&#39;ve come to realize it&#39;s practically the opposite. You&#39;re united by the love of good writing, and I think that makes all the difference. The Sib Houses are a prime example. It&#39;s a really cool system for helping the newbies feel at home; very awesome! </p>

            <p>*ties urple bow around wrist* I have read Huniesoron&#39;s awesome piece- it inspired me quite a bit. My original idea was basically one of those copy-paste plot stories- Amy was actually sent to Arda to *keep* the plot from derailing. I realized what a waste that was after reading Tenth Walkers, for which I am immeasurably grateful. I do like the idea of his unbroken Fellowship, but I don&#39;t think Amy could (or would) keep the Walkers together; her ultimate goal is to get to Minas Tirith. Her friend (and basically adopted daughter) Kali is sick, and the only known cure is an herb that grows in Harad. Minas Tirith keeps a small store of it, which Amy knows thanks to Aragorn. So the real question would be, how would the Fellowship break?</p>

            <p>I do have a question that sort of ties into that. So, in my story, I have an idea that I plan to implement- a meddling Mary Sue. Her name is Amelia, and she&#39;s basically a completely Sueified version of Amy. She pops in every so often and creates a bubble of movie verse around her, bigger and more powerful than Amy&#39;s book verse influence. After the events of the War of the Ring, Amelia still appears once in a while, but instead of simply trying to get almost every male character to fall at her feet, she whisks Amy off to other universes, such as Harry Potter, PotC, etc. Amelia is also an inveterate shipper, so she tries to set Amy up with different characters, a la fangirl writers pairing off their OC and favorite character. What do you think?</p>

            <p>On a side note, I find it interesting how many people know that verse. No point to that, just wanted to note it.<br><br>Anyway, yes, I do. Technically, it was an order to the Israelites in particular, to set them aside. It may apply to Gentile believers, but if I remember correctly it doesn&#39;t really say. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t wear things of blended material. I don&#39;t really know. I&#39;m told to give reason for the light inside me, so maybe I should dress differently, so more people ask. And your complaint is entirely valid; the Bible is not a bag of trail mix. You were completely  courteous, and feel free to ask me such questions anytime.</p>

            <p>(Or madam - you didn&#39;t mention your preferred pronoun?)<br>Anyway, to add some context to that verse - sh&#39;atnez, or the prohibition on wearing clothes from two or more kinds of fabric, is not one of the Seven Precepts of the Sons of Noah which also apply to gentiles - it&#39;s a strictly Israelite thing. (Incidentally, this precept has some interesting derivatives, such as a prohibition on mixed dishes, but that&#39;s outside the scope of this discussion.)<br>Anyway, since you&#39;re a Christian, this precept doesn&#39;t apply to you. <i>However</i>, logic dictates that if you believe everything written in the Bible is the word of God and should be followed to the letter, then you shan&#39;t wear mixed fabrics anyway.<br>...<br>That sounded much more coherent in my head.<br>Anyway, I salute you - you&#39;ve kept a chill, even amiable head where many people would have blown their top off.</p>

            <p>With my personal pronoun.. Hrm.. I&#39;m really sensitive about putting any information about myself on the Internet. And I know I am being super paranoid for not even sharing something so basic, but for now you can call me whatever.<br><br>Wow, I&#39;m very impressed! I didn&#39;t know the technical names at all, I shall file that away, as it&#39;s very useful. Yeah, I&#39;ve always been a bit murky on the subject. I know the clothing law wasn&#39;t specifically lifted, like the dietary ones, but it doesn&#39;t seem like general church principle to follow it.

            <p>But your thinking that is quite natural. I don&#39;t think mainstream Christianity puts enough emphasis on witnessing to those around you, but I try to. I don&#39;t really identify with a single denomination yet; for now, I believe the Bible, and unless it&#39;s the Church of Me there&#39;s no denomination I&#39;ll totally agree with on everything. If I somehow wound up in a room with a Baptist and a Nazarene, there&#39;s nothing that would stop me from worshipping with them, so.. Yeah. I don&#39;t really agree with what the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses believe, as far as I know of it.  <br><br>That&#39;s really interesting, that most Jews would say it wouldn&#39;t apply to me. Very useful to know; thank you!</p>

            <p>I actually was born and raised Roman Catholic (though I wasn&#39;t <br> really fussed about religion) and attended a Catholic school which was my own personal hell on earth thanks to an entire grade made of bullies. So I already had fairly good knowledge of various Bible verses, but I learned quite a bit when I did a project, erm, two years ago, pointing out how so many people cite the Bible as a reason homosexuality is evil while not adhereing to other things like the &#39;no clothing of mixed fibers&#39; or &#39;no touching a woman on her period&#39; or &#39;being allowed to sell your daughter into slavery&#39;. *shrugs*</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry your school was so bad :( I&#39;ve never had to deal with bullies, but it&#39;s got to be awful. I&#39;m not very good with the Old Testament- not as good as I should be, anyway. Books of law, like Leviticus and such, have always been a bit hard for me. I&#39;d like to say that it&#39;s actually impossible to always follow everything the Bible says, simply because we are flawed beings. I can&#39;t always be patient, loving, kind, gentle, and without pride; I&#39;m human. I&#39;m sinful. If I may ask, what was the general conclusion of your paper? (I promise I won&#39;t be offended, even if I may not agree)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m quite new here, of course, but everyone so far has been very nice. Picking and choosing is never good, I agree. The only way to truly understand a verse is to understand its context; and how do you do that if you keep yanking the verse out of place? </p>

            <p>For whatever reason, I only found the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Assassination_Methods">Assassination Methods</a> page now, and I must ask: must it note every single assassination method? It has entries like &#39;head shot&#39; and &#39;decapitation with a sword&#39;, and those aren&#39;t special or interesting.<br>Is there any reason not to clean those up and only leave the interesting methods (thrown into the Crucible&#39;s energy core, being left with an Assassin&#39;s Guild receipt, being left to be eaten by Thread)?</p>

            <p>... to have the page at all?<br><br>Non-interesting assassination methods don&#39;t need to be listed anywhere, really. Interesting ones would probably be better listed under the canon in question, no? Having a section for methods (including body disposal, which was where the whole idea started) on each canon page seems more... unified?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I know that I&#39;d look for assassination methods in such a page and not under specific canons.<br>Also, some methods are problematic - if you blew a Dalek up in the <i>Harry Potter</i>-verse, do you list it under <i>Doctor Who</i>? <i>Harry Potter</i>? Both? Neither?</p>

            <p>So, a few days ago, my mom demanded I show her some of my PPC work to make sure I wasn&#39;t lying when I said we weren&#39;t &quot;ripping on other people&#39;s stories&quot;. I decided to show her &quot;Two Sues for the Price of One&quot;, and unexpectedly, she not only approved of it, she liked it.<br><br>Liked it a little too much. Now she wants to see <i>other</i> people&#39;s stories, as well as more of my own. I&#39;m in a bit of a bind, guys, because if she sees anything with more than minorly offensive swearing or a passing reference to sex, I&#39;m in deep sh*t. <br><br>So, if you guys have any tamer missions you can think of, I&#39;m in desperate need of suggestions. Before you recommend, just... pretend like you&#39;ll give it to a very fussy granny to read.<br><br>Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ll be copying some of my missions into a duplicate document and performing cosmetic edits. :/</p>

            <p>Most of my stuff should be okay, but I don&#39;t know if you can show her only some of my stuff without her wanting to read everything on my site. &quot;Blood Raining Night&quot; is on my site, and I know that&#39;s right out. Everything up to that point <i>should</i> be okay, I think... except maybe &quot;Ring Child.&quot; Nume drops the F-bomb a lot in that one. Oh, and &quot;Cosmic Love,&quot; because slash and Mpreg. Everything comes with a helpful rating, though, so maybe you can persuade her that you never read the &quot;bad&quot; ones?<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely second the recommendation of &quot;Brown DragonRider&quot; and raise with &quot;Harry Potter and the Dragonriders of Pern,&quot; though, because I know she likes Pern. {= ) HPDroP contains mild references to sexual things, but no actual sex, so hopefully that&#39;s all right.<br><br>All of my DMS missions ought to be all right, probably... and following Derik&#39;s adventures gets &quot;Gestalt Therapy&quot; into the mix.<br><br>Phobos&#39; stuff should be okay, too, as long as you avoid the DBS one. The &quot;Going Postal&quot; stories are particularly on the &quot;good clean fun&quot; side of the spectrum.<br><br>I&#39;ll think some more about other stories that might be good to share.

            <p>As for stuff I&#39;d recommend to Iximaz&#39;s mom... well... I don&#39;t know if any of my solo missions are exactly kid-friendly. The only one that stands well on its own is my very first one and we all know how THAT went down... *shudders*<br><br>Honestly, I think the ONLY one of my missions that can be considered work-safe may be the Minecraft one (I&#39;d link to it but I&#39;m on mobile), and that was a relatively minor endeavor. Maybe my co-writes would stand a better chance - probably not the one with Iximaz&#39;s but definitely the one with eatpraylove, and probably my recent one with Voyd as well if she doesn&#39;t mind jumpscares and the like.</p>

            <p>(Moms can surprise you, huh? :))<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily include my Blackout Interlude, both because it&#39;s currently unfinished and because if it <i>was</i> finished it would have...well, not particularly offensive swearing, but perhaps a little more of it than would be preferred (I blame the Winchesters. And Meg).<br><br>However: April Fool&#39;s Day stories are fun, funny, and not quite the usual sort of PPC writing, which could be pretty interesting and help give a broader view of what we&#39;re about! <s>We&#39;re totally all about rabbit!agents, shhh</s>. However, I would <i>not</i> link your mom to my lj account, mainly because it&#39;s also rehosting Deleterius material, which is...not even remotely always worksafe, unfortunately. I really should have put it in a different journal, but...ooh. Maybe I can somehow repost it to one that&#39;s actually called &#39;deleterius&#39;? It&#39;d make it much easier to find, and it would make my journal worksafe again...that&#39;s a thought.<br><br>Anyway. Fortunately, I have a worksafe alternative (er, so long as you don&#39;t then browse the site, though that&#39;s also true of FFN to a slightly milder degree): AO3, or Archive of Our Own. For some reason, they have a tool that converts LJ posts into AO3 stories. It&#39;s kind of useful. To my sorrow, it doesn&#39;t work with FFN, which is where most of my fics are actually posted, but what can you do?<br><br>So. <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/3794707">April 2013 AFD mission</a>, wherein agents are cats and a Disentangler is called in. The only swearing there is one instance of &#39;Flaming Denethor&#39;, as far as I can see. No sexual references that I remember seeing, either.<br><br>Next, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T4HjrpXRvcwIfTbQssYIQxlSSlfHerSNPv4i0MtYKT8/edit">T&#39;Zar&#39;s Reassignment</a>, which is the 2014 AFD interlude and also links to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HKcP0mWHg1CFPvUeB99cRav_KVoKa7SYk9H_KnI60vo/edit">real interlude</a> (very worksafe, just has two agents meeting each other for the first time). It has one mild swearword and...Captain Jack Harkness, so there&#39;s your passing reference to sex /sigh/. It&#39;s basically an...implication? A mild suggestion? It&#39;s not crass or overt, just him being a flirt, which...yeah, more or less unavoidable. He does then make out with Ianto for a while, which then becomes a bit of a running joke. It&#39;s not described in detail, though.<br><br>And then we have this year&#39;s AFD story, which is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pnegAqyLC0mKqux-Lj-FJEOTuPESsE1P8MgpynP0zmQ/edit">Carrot Juice Shop AU</a> (and should probably be put on the wiki). No swearing, I don&#39;t remember or see any references to sex, and this is literally just fluff.<br><br>I&#39;d also add the next interlude I post, which I shall do reasonably soon. It&#39;s also extremely worksafe, hopefully funny, and not exactly the usual sort of PPC story...well, no, it sort of is, but...well, you&#39;ll see. It&#39;s inspired by something hS said, and is not a mission. It&#39;s also got the continuity of using agents who appear in the AFD stories :)<br><br>Hope that helps!<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I did on opening night.  While I liked the party scene at Stark Tower, the rest of the movie frightened me; Ultron in particular.  Even though it is not a movie that I really like, it is very well-crafted and the dialogue is superb.  <br><br>(I also suspect that there will be huge number of Hulk/Black Widow badfics.)  <br></p>

            <p>There was stuff I liked about and stuff I didn&#39;t. In some places it was as good as the first Avengers, but I can&#39;t think of a single moment where it was actually better. And the ending felt to me, like the whole movie was just a set-up for the next Avengers movie. I don&#39;t mind a bit of sequel bating, but it felt rather obvious.</p>

            <p>Age of Ultron has to set up Civil War, at least hint at Ragnarok, and do at least some of the ground work for Infinity Wars.  I know where in the MCU it was going to fit, so I was expecting it to be really geared at setting things up for Phase 3.  And part of that is strategy.  Look at it this way, Phase 1 ended with Avengers, so everything was leading up to that.  Phase 2 ends with Ant-Man, and almost immediately after Phase 2 ends you get Phase 3 starting with Civil War and Ragnarok.  And those two films are going to be massive in scope, so to actually get them to fit in a reasonable time, you need to do set up prior.  We might get some in Season 3 of Agents of SHIELD, but most of the heavy lifting had to be done in the films, because not everyone follows Agents of SHIELD.   </p>

            <p>The plot was really rushed, and it would have at least been nice to see Tony and Bruce discussing the Ultron project in one of the previous movies, so it didn&#39;t come so completely out of left field.  But, it was still an enjoyable story.<br><br>I liked that Natasha and Bruce became the official couple.  Much better than pairing her with one of the more stereotypical male leads.  I also like that they&#39;re diversifying the Avengers team immensely for future movies.  Vision I&#39;m rather meh about—he worked as an adversary to Ultron, but I can&#39;t really see him doing much from this point.  He&#39;s so inhuman, it feels rather dull.  I like all the other new Avengers, though.<br><br>BUT<br>(rant inbound)<br>They are missing an obvious one, and it legitimately makes me angry that they passed up the opportunity!  <i>Iron Man 3</i> gave them the perfect chance to leave Pepper Potts with permanent super-powers from her Extremis exposure.  We already saw from Boring White Bad Guy Whose Name I Can&#39;t Be Bothered to Look Up that it was possible to safely control the Extremis heat powers, and didn&#39;t they flat-out say Tony had come up with an equation to stabilize the formula?  It would have been a fantastic opportunity to elevate one of the designated love interests into a more active role.<br><br>I think, in my head canon, Pepper still has her powers, and is just too cool to hang out with the Avengers.  *pout*</p>

            <p>Gwyneth Paltrow does not, at least to me, seem like she has the presence to really be an action hero, not like Scarlett Johansson does.  I think it would really be forcing it to put the MCU&#39;s Pepper into anything really more than her previous roles.  Marvel has better female characters that they could add instead of Pepper.  Like Scarlet Witch, and that was one of my favorite things about Age of Ultron.<br><br>I also heard a rumor that after Thor:  Ragnarok we might see the recent Female Thor.  Which could be interesting.  Then again the other rumor is that we might see Beta Ray Bill, which that is a bridge too far right now.  Personally I&#39;m waiting to see X-23 in the X-Men films.  </p>

I don&#39;t really follow actory people (didn&#39;t realize that was Gwyneth Paltrow; I recognize the name, but that&#39;s all), but I&#39;m sure she can act whatever.<br><br>As for Marvel having &quot;better&quot; female characters, I&#39;m sure they do, but that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t improve on an older character to <i>make</i> them better.  I mean, let&#39;s face it: the comics industry has a lot of bland female love interest-type characters.  Making Pepper an Avenger with her Extremis powers would have helped update her character to have more of an active role in the setting.</p>

            <p>I just would personally rather them focus on Scarlet Witch.  I just think she gives them a whole lot more potential to work with.  Elizabeth Olsen just seems like she can carry the action hero role better.  Scarlet Witch is also one of the most intriguing characters Marvel has.  I also think she is hard to do right.  I have seen some good stories with her and some good adaptations, but I have also seen less than fantastic ones as well.  Scarlet Witch just has so much more potential.  Pepper Potts/Rescue is basically just a female Iron Man.  </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know, I see it as very similar to Guardians of the Galaxy.  It can go really well, but it can also get messed up very badly.  In fact much of Phase 3 is really high risk-high reward.  Black Panther facially seems like it could go well, but need I remind people of the Daredevil film?  Doctor Strange could work, but it could just as easily fall into Ghost Rider territory (mediocre at best).  Captain Marvel could also go either way.  Not to mention Spiderman, seeing as they have now had five films and none have quite gotten it right.<br><br>Then you have Civil War which might be trying to do too much.  Same goes for Ragnarok, and Infinity Wars.  Frankly I see a lot of risk and a lot of payoff, but Phase 2 really only has two questions, Guardians (which was far better than I thought it could be) and Ant-Man (the premise is hard to sell to me, but it looks good so far).  The only guarantee about Phase 3 is that the films will do well.  Whether they are good, I do not know.    </p>

            <p>Good job on the mission!  Like I mentioned, I don&#39;t actually know either of the canons, though I have been looking up FNaF.  It seems interesting, but I&#39;m kind of wuss when it comes to horror stuff.  You did a good job making both halves of the crossover comprehensible to an outsider. <br><br>As an AoT fan, I have to ask - what was the context for the reference to Eren?  Was it intentional on the part of the Suethor, or just the result of a typo?<br><br>I do have two minor criticisms.  First, there are quite a few unattributed lines of dialogue, which can get a little hard to follow with as many characters as there are.  Second, it seemed a little heavy on references to past missions.  They made sense from an in-universe perspective, so I&#39;m not sure if my criticism is exactly fair, but I felt like they slowed the story down a bit.  Other than those things, I thought it was really good.</p>

However, they come with some disclaimers, which I will reproduce here for clarity:<br><br>---<br><br><b>DISCLAIMER [1]:</b> These instructions are intended for Beginners, and for those looking for a few short-cuts to jump-start their writing. If this advice does not agree with your style of writing, by all means, take what you can use and ignore the rest.<br><br><b>For the record...</b><br>-- The description word counts limits I include in here are meant to be GUIDELINES not exact amounts, &#39;kay?<br><br><b>DISCLAIMER [2]:</b> As with all advice, take what you can use and throw out the rest. As a multi-published author, I have been taught some fairly rigid rules on what is publishable and what is not. If my rather straight-laced (and occasionally snotty,) advice does not suit your creative style, by all means, IGNORE IT.<br><br>---<br><br>I&#39;ll also add a note that reading the whole thing is necessary to get the whole picture. She sometimes clarifies things she says later on in the article, such as the bit about using purple prose. What she actually means by that is that using lavish description SPARINGLY is good, and that sometimes otherwise dry scenes can be punched up with a well-chosen bit of description. It would be easy to miss that if you stopped at the header &quot;Making the Reader FEEL the Passion -- Make the prose PURPLE!&quot;<br><br>So, yeah. Check it out, but use your own discretion, too. If it helps, great! If not, that&#39;s okay, too! {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Right, whichever one of you lot nicked my camera, send it back <i>right now</i>, or I&#39;m siccing Kaitlyn on you.<br><br>With that out of the way... thanks once again to KittyEden for organising the trip! I mean, it was still a bit obnoxious asking us all to come to Australia, but at least I didn&#39;t have as bad a trip as Desdendelle. I didn&#39;t even know there <i>were</i> direct flights from Israel to Antarctica...<br><br>I&#39;m seriously disappointed in the lot of you, by the way: not <i>one</i> of you thought to bring any sandwiches to the PGs. Is it any wonder PoorCynic nearly dropped us down the Marianas Trench? We were all nearly starving! And it&#39;s not like you can just reach out and catch some fish to eat <i>yes I&#39;m looking at you Darkotas</i>.<br><br>(Confession time: it wasn&#39;t just the shark. Nesh didn&#39;t manage to get a picture of the Colossal Squid... which is probably a good thing. Nightmare fuel, I&#39;m telling you.)<br><br>I still think it&#39;s hilarious that we <i>all</i> forgot the tents. I know son<em>of</em>heaven176, World-Jumper, and Tira were all adamant that they were going to bring them – what happened, guys? Were you too distracted by dramaticsoprano&#39;s Interpretive Departure Dance to pack them? Seriously. But props to Silenthunder for the marquee, and to doctorlit for the spare sleeping bags.<br><br>The ISH virus... yikes. Hieronymus was particularly hard hit – that German accent didn&#39;t do him any favours, remember Kaitlyn deciding he had a mutation called &#39;the ICH strain&#39;? I was impressed by radioactiveSue&#39;s attempts to communicate in ISHMorse code – it&#39;s just a shame only AdmiralSakai understood! I admit that watching radioactiveSue getting more and more angry with AdmiralSakai&#39;s mistranslations was hilarious, though.<br><br>Fred! Fred was awesome. Kitty, please tell me you left him a laptop and the Board&#39;s address – he totally need to join the PPC. Though admittedly the part where he pushed the van across two miles of dunes, not so cool.<br><br>The night was... um... let&#39;s go with &#39;interesting&#39;. Apologies if Kaitlyn and I kept anyone awake! <sup>_~</sup> Sometimes there&#39;s nothing for it but a game of Midnight Munchkin.  (Was quite surprised no-one tried to join in, though – did you maybe think we were up to something else?) As for Scapegrace&#39;s &#39;eldrich ritual&#39;... okay, in spite of your &#39;vows of eternal secrecy on pain of&#39; whatever, I have to tell you that <s>Voyd</s> someone I won&#39;t name talked. And yes, I admit that it all sounds very impressive... until I realised the whole thing was a colossal pun about dunes in June. Not very subtle, Scape. (Apparently Omega <i>really</i> got into it, though...)<br><br>Breakfast was really lovely (if cold!). I&#39;m sorry Kaitlyn and I sparked the &#39;everyone vanish into the dunes&#39; debacle – sorry, Edhelistar, hope you like Pretoria!<br><br>Rock-Paper-Scissors was heaps of fun. I beat DawnFire with a well-timed Overhand Meteorite, and managed to block SeaTurtle&#39;s Origami Throw with a Edward Reversal, but ultimately lost to Ekyl&#39;s Million Dollars. I admit that seeing him win the entire contest with a Rocks Fall, Everybody Dies made me feel a <i>bit</i> better.<br><br>I enjoyed the little bit of Darkotas&#39; Rettop Yrrah I ended up taking part in; in retrospect I shouldn&#39;t have picked Dumbledore! I mean, it would&#39;ve been all right if we&#39;d got back further than Sirius&#39; death – incredibly well acted by Sergio and Calista, by the way – but the Golden Trio&#39;s &#39;little accident&#39;... yes, I know it wasn&#39;t your fault, firemagic, but it <i>did</i> rather make playing on impossible.<br><br>The talent show... oh, the talent show. Best acts, for my money, were Seafarer&#39;s &#39;Les Mis in a minute&#39;, and Iximaz and Darkotas&#39; &#39;instant tumbleweed bunkbed&#39; – though the latter, admittedly, mostly for the looks on their faces when they fell through! Apologies to anyone who was looking forward to my promised <i>Lay of Leithian</i> two-person play – TheShyIon backed out at the last minute (yes, I know you had your reasons), and I couldn&#39;t bully Kaitlyn into taking her place. Shame – she would&#39;ve made a wonderful Luthien.<br><br>I&#39;m, er, not really sure what was going on with Lady Liberty – Pretzel, why <i>did</i> you think that was a good idea? For that matter, I&#39;m not sure how you managed to fit her in the van – never mind &#39;bigger on the inside&#39;, she shouldn&#39;t have gone through the <i>doors</i>! Oh, wait – didn&#39;t domirossi say something about finding Fred some company? I&#39;m not sure the elephant wanted a statue, mate! (Also, was anyone else totally freaked out by waking up to see the giant silhouette framed against the sun? Anyone besides Voyd, obviously, we all know how <i>you</i> felt.)<br><br>You&#39;ve covered the play and the sand-sculptures very well (but unaccountably didn&#39;t mention Superfluity&#39;s hundred-odd tiny sand orcs – is that possibly because of the way you sat on them, Kitty?), so I&#39;ll skip straight to the last day – and the excuses.<br><br>No, I&#39;m not going to blame the Agents&#39; loss on KandleKitty – I know quite a few people did, but while letting Iximaz into our camp because &#39;I thought she was on our team&#39; was pretty egregious, it was <i>far</i> from the only disastrous mishap. Scapegrace&#39;s half-mile tumble down the dune, anyone? Desdendelle&#39;s &#39;camouflage&#39; that consisted of a handful of sand in his hair? Neshomeh&#39;s attempt to dual-wield longbows?<br><br>So what was the problem? It wasn&#39;t my leadership – well, I <i>hope</i> it wasn&#39;t my leadership. Personally, I suspect Darkotas and Iximaz of tampering with the Agents&#39; water supply – I definitely detected a trace of cactus in there. That&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it. (Also, &#39;stop complaining&#39;? As <i>if</i>!)<br><br>Not that I&#39;m complaining about cactus juice <i>in general</i>, mark you. It went very well with the closing meal – and massive huge thanks to Seychelles and Silenthunder for all the effort they put into that. It was ridiculously nice.<br><br>(I&#39;d like to emphasise that it was entirely Phobos&#39; fault you got left behind. He managed to abandon Voyd in Sri Lanka on the way back, too! Also, the ScarfBlanket? <i>Definitely</i> not me this time. Honest)<br><br>Overall, it was a fantastic, awesome time, and I&#39;m already looking forward to next year. Big thumbs up all round, and Matt Cipher – &#39;Clock down on Napoleon!&#39; <sup>_~<br><br>But</sup> I&#39;m not joking about the camera.<br><br>((Heaps of fun again, Kitty – thanks! If it helps, pretty sure this was more worthwhile than French... <sup>_<sup>))<br><br>hS</sup></sup></p>

            <p>I&#39;m telling you, fish are best when fresh. They were right there!

            <p>So, way back in December of 2012, I suggested a sort of random cowrite game, in order to encourage PPCers to write with new people and get involved in new fandoms! And, well, I figure now&#39;s a good time to try it again.<br><br>Here are the rules/guidelines:<br><br>Every person who wants to play makes a short list of the fandoms they really love and want to write in - three, four entries or thereabouts. Then, that person is matched up with someone that they&#39;ve never written with, don&#39;t know too well, and whose fandoms they don&#39;t know themselves. Then, those two people write a crossover fic together, and hopefully make a new friend and get a new fandom to enjoy. (The fandom matchups don&#39;t have to be entirely random, by the way - last time I mentioned that I kind of wanted to write a Nanoha/Sherlock fic when I knew nothing about Sherlock, and ended up doing that with LilyWinterwood. The important part is you only know one of the fandoms involved.)<br><br>So, yeah! <br><br>My own list is as follows:<br><br>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha<br>Steven Universe<br>Puella Magi Madoka Magica<br>Homestuck<br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking I might want to possibly maybe ask for permission soon, but I&#39;d like to hear about your experiences first. Partly out of curiosity, and partly because I&#39;d like to prepare the best. I have read the guide, but sharing funny stories is always good. Also, I would like to know if I&#39;ve been here long enough to ask permission. I know you guys generally don&#39;t give it if someone has only been here a short time.</p>

            <p>Raven Firedragon and I came up with the idea for a new department - the Department of Geographical Aberrations. We wrote up a description, and posted it to the Board asking if it was good and we could write it. GreyLadyBast said &#39;sure&#39;, and away we went!<br><br>Yeah, I... don&#39;t recommend trying that nowadays.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;Why not? Why not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because if you do/The Big Bad Mouse will come after you.&quot;<br><br>No, seriously. The reason we don&#39;t do it that way any more is pretty much twofold:<br><br>1/ We like the idea of a single, unified PPC canon these days. Back then? Not so much. You could pretty much write anything you wanted, and no-one cared. These days, we PGs want to know that you know your way around.<br><br>2/ Back in the day, the Permission Givers <i>knew who everyone was</i>. You were probably on either Cam or Bast&#39;s LJ; there was a good chance you&#39;d chatted with Thalia on AIM; everyone was a fanwriter, and you&#39;d probably been reviewed by at least one of them. If Miss Cam saw Lacksidacksical asking to write a spinoff (all that capital-P Permission business came later), she&#39;d go &#39;oh, yes, Lacksi, wrote that fic about Legolas getting trapped in the Glittering Caves, and isn&#39;t she the one who knows all that trivia about medieval weapons?&#39;.<br><br>Nowadays? It&#39;s partly our fault as PGs, it&#39;s partly the way the internet has changed, it&#39;s partly the makeup of the community, it&#39;s partly the slowdown of the Board, it&#39;s all sorts of things... but I haven&#39;t a clue who you are. I mean, I vaguely recognise your name, which puts you at least at Level Two, but... that&#39;s pretty much it.<br><br>Yes, I can <i>check</i> (and if I was handling a Permission request you can bet I would), but I don&#39;t <i>know</i>. And that makes the old way of things... pretty darn hard.<br><br>(Also: when we started asking for writing samples, they were almost universally your other fanfic, which was probably in one of maybe five fandoms. Then more and more people didn&#39;t <i>have</i> recent fanfic, and those who did usually had it in Obscure Fandom #97001, so the practice of writing a PPC sample came in. The current prompts are just a way to quantify that. Just a random thought.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Third time was the charm, although hS was actually pretty reluctant to give me Permission. He wasn&#39;t too sure about my writing style.<br><br>I think it paid off, though. I&#39;ve discovered four new minis (well, five if you count my cowrite with SkarmorySilver, still in progress I swear), I&#39;ve ventured into quite a few new continua, I&#39;m trying to show that there are good parts of the job (please see RC 211 mission 3, the moment with Valon and Yuu), and I even managed to set up the appearance of one of the biggest and baddest dragons in history.<br><br>I&#39;m not a <i>great</i> writer by any stretch of the imagination; for instance, it&#39;s pretty clear that Gabby still doesn&#39;t have a personality. I&#39;m getting there, though, and the best part of working with the PPC is that we support each other. Advice is exchanged, lessons are taught and learned, and we all improve each other&#39;s writing.</p>

            <p>It was right before the current Permission system was put in place; the PGs were still using the old system of &#39;give us a description of your agents and write a short story of them&#39;. We didn&#39;t get no stinkin&#39; prompts like you whippersnappers and we got on just fine! *brandishes cane*<br><br>Joking aside, I remember spotting a typo in my request <i>right</i> after posting it and panicking because ZOMG TYPO I&#39;M RUIIIINED. <sup><sup>;</sup></sup> hS seemed to like it alright, though, so it was fine. :P <br><br>Wait, right, moral. *clears throat* While you should definitely present the best request you can, don&#39;t panic if you have a few minor slip-ups. It happens to the best of us.<br><br>As for if you&#39;ve been around long enough... *scratches head* Well, I definitely recognize your name (it&#39;s rather distinctive!), but if anyone asked me what you were like, Iunno what I&#39;d say. Might have to let someone else make the call on that. It&#39;s not so much &#39;have you been here long enough?&#39;, more like &#39;have you been a part of the community?&#39; Someone who lurks for years and only shows up occasionally to post once before vanishing is less likely to get Permission than someone who posts more frequently, I would think.</p>

            <p>After much tweaking, I present the link that has the two story samples necessary for Permission.

            <p>I&#39;ll right now restrict it just to Za&#39;kiir&#39;s character.  I may go back with a metaphoric fine tooth comb later.  <br><br>1.  Khajiit are never unarmed.  Their claws are always available.  And further in the game mechanics of Skyrim a Khajiit unarmed build is fully viable.  <br><br>2.  Under the conventions I remember, it is probably better to keep referring to himself as Khajiit rather than some form of me/I.  Even the Khajiit companions in Skyrim refer to themselves in the third person.  <br><br>Those were the biggest things I noticed.  I did not notice anything especially glaring with Za&#39;kiir. </p>

            <p>Well, we are probably not related. I don’t even know what &quot;Skyrim&quot; is, but I already like Za’kiir.<br><br>(I’m doing this wrong. For proper beta reading, I should have your e-mail address and send you my comments, or I should be able to comment on the Gdoc that shouldn’t be visible to anybody who is not your beta reader. I hope you don’t mind me putting this up here.)<br><br><b>Sample #1 (Control prompt: &quot;The agents first meet&quot;):</b><br><br>As I already said, I like how you introduce the Khajiit who isn’t eager to become an assassin. We don’t see much of Natalie, but I think it’s enough to get a mental image.<br><br>There are two sentences you may want to reconsider:<br><br><i>He dimly recalled being told <b>that was</b> going to be assigned a “partner,” and that he was going to train to become an assassin.</i><br>There is a pronoun missing, and &quot;that he was going [...] that he was going&quot; looks a bit repetitive. Can you find another way to say it? <br><br><i>She looked back at him, studying him for a few moments before seeming to come to some internal agreement.</i><br>I’m not a native speaker, but this sounds weird to me, probably because there are too many &quot;ing&quot;s. Something like &quot;She looked back at him, studying him for a few moments, then she seemed to come to some internal agreement&quot; may work better.<br><br><b>Sample #2 (Random prompt is random):</b><br><br>Yeah, that’s the main problem I have there. You are supposed to roll dices to select a prompt from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IE81HONRJnp0IaK92GvzyL00CZYNZG_pvdo93gRMIhY/pub">table</a>, and to tell the Permission Givers what you got. Since you didn’t tell, I can’t figure out what this sample should be about. It works mostly well as the finishing part of a mission (and I didn’t see any technical problems), but the end is a bit disappointing, because it’s too abrupt. <br><br>The two agents had made a quick plan of their own and suddenly rushed the possessed canon character. So, did they discuss their plan and he didn’t notice because he was too distracted by his own speech? Did they use sign language to communicate? Is this their twenty-seventh mission and they know each other so well that they don’t need words to synchronize their actions? Glossing over this may be excusable if the story’s focus has actually been elsewhere and you just need to end it now, keeping it short. I just don’t know.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Gay guys are rarer than straight guys, and more stigmatized. Most fan writers have had less interaction with gay guys than with straight guys, and gay guys in many places still can&#39;t be as open about being romantically involved. That means a straight or female writer usually has fewer real-life observations to draw from. Even a gay male writer might have seen more straight romance in his life than gay male romance.<br><br>Many slash writers are cis female. They don&#39;t have guy genitalia. If the slash gets explicit, that means they&#39;re not writing about something they have daily experience. They simply don&#39;t know how things work and, if unwilling (or too young) to do the research, can end up writing things that would make any male reader cringe in sympathetic pain.<br><br>The lack of experience with guy/guy relationships, plus the lack of knowledge about mechanics, can lead writers to try to squeeze a guy/guy relationship into a girl/guy stereotype. So one guy becomes &quot;masculine&quot; and the other &quot;feminine&quot;, and their personalities change, and explicit scenes are written almost as though one of them were female. Sometimes one partner even gets pregnant. (By masculine I mean male-stereotype--the cultural idea of male, you know, rough and tough and muscular.)<br><br>Sure, there are gay guys that are feminine in personality and dating/married to a much more masculine guy, but they&#39;re still two guys, and anyhow, there&#39;s no unwritten gay rule that one partner has to be more feminine.<br><br>But regardless of the existence of such couples in real life, when this masculine/feminine stereotype is imposed on couples in fiction with pre-established personalities, it can throw them way out of character. Characters written as a slash couple are often not written as themselves, but as a seme/uke stereotypical gay couple.<br><br>That really bugs me. It&#39;s as though these writers think that just because a guy is written as gay, his personality must change to a &quot;gay&quot; personality. But gay people have the same wide range of personalities as anybody else; they&#39;re just attracted to the same gender. And if I&#39;m reading romance between, say, Aragorn and Legolas, doesn&#39;t it make sense that I&#39;d want to read about Aragorn and Legolas, not two stereotyped cardboard cutouts with name-tags reading &quot;Aragorn&quot; and &quot;Legaolas&quot;?</p>

            <p>I wonder if the reason Bad Slash is a separate category at the PPC is because of our LotR origins.  LotR has a lot more male characters than female ones, so if you&#39;re a badfic writer interested in het you&#39;re more likely to create a Sue than write about a canon character.  On the other hand, there are enough popular male characters that badfic writers interested in slash can just write about them.  The Original Series is also somewhat low on Character Replacements, I&#39;ve noticed, with Loli!Arwen being the only one I remember off the top of my head.  I&#39;m not really familiar enough with LotR to say whether it&#39;s a difference between it and fandoms like Harry Potter that are rife with them, or if it&#39;s just a case of evolution within the PPC.  So the line between Mary Sues and Bad Slash mainly seems to be the presence of a poorly-written OC.<br><br>To be honest, most slash I&#39;ve seen that I&#39;d consider mission-worthy is OoC enough that at least one of the characters is replaced.  But I&#39;m not a big fan of slash in general, so it&#39;s possible I&#39;m just being overly lenient.  I have seen some pretty bad het fics that aren&#39;t really Sueish, but most of them don&#39;t strike me as good mission material; they&#39;re mostly short, sappy, and unmemorable. </p>

            <p>that the two types are written in, when looking at fanfiction overall.  Why that&#39;s the case I don&#39;t know.  Perhaps heterosexual pairings have been prevalent in mainstream media for so long, fandom got bored and went in another direction in their own stories?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t often write romance, but when I do, it tends to be of the Slash variety. I just find it easier to write, for some reason. But if the stereotype about all fanfic writers being teenage girls has any truth to it, it might be because two hot guys is better than one hot guy. Still doesn&#39;t explain why I can write it better, though.</p>

We&#39;ve already sold the Royal Mail and the National Health Service... can we sell some more schools to corporations next? Ooh! Could we <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Government">sell workers to their employers?</a>&quot; - David Cameron, in a policy planning meeting.<br><br><b>The Labour Party</b><br><br>&quot;What if, right, you&#39;ll like this, what if we take all the crazy that the other parties are spewing, <i>water it down slightly</i>, and make that our ideology? Eh? Eh? Whaddaya think?&quot; - Ed Milliband, on the phone to Ed Balls.<br><br><b>The UK Independence Party</b><br><br>&quot;If UKIP is elected, taking the UK out of Europe will only be the first step. By the end of my term, I plan for the British race to stand tall and proud in its new home: the planet Venus.&quot; - Nigel Farage, campaign speech.<br><br><b>The Liberal Democrats</b><br><br>&quot;But I don&#39;t understand <i>why</i> we&#39;re doing so badly in the polls! All we did was ally with our ideological enemies, spit all over our voters, and shoot ourselves in the literal foot with an actual gun! It&#39;s just not fair!&quot; - Nick Clegg, campaign speech.<br><br><b>The Green Party</b><br><br>&quot;What about... could we stand trees as candidates? That would make a statement, wouldn&#39;t it?

Also, no, sadly the SNP aren&#39;t standing candidates in England.)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Right now, the polls are close enough that it looks like no one party will take a majority. With that in mind, let&#39;s run through the possibile governments the UK could have for the next five years, in rough order of likelihood.<br><br>1/ Labour minority government, with SNP support. Will probably result in another Scottish independence referendum. Still, overall it&#39;s the best option going, since the SNP is the most left-wing party we&#39;ve got (and, for the record, are currently looking to be the third-largest party, after the Conservatives and Labour).<br><br>2/ Conservative/Lib Dem coalition. A continuation of what we&#39;ve currently got, though probably as a minority coalition. Not keen on this.<br><br>3/ SNP government. Sure, they&#39;re the third party, but if the two largest refuse to form a government, <i>someone</i> has to. This would be hilarious and I desperately wish it would happen. Nicola Sturgeon for Prime Minister!<br><br>4/ National government, AKA Conservative/Labour coalition. Hey, it worked for Churchill!<br><br>5/ Simultaneous meteor strike against all candidates, resulting in a second election. Look, it could happen!<br><br>6/ The Queen gets so ticked off with the whole thing that she reasserts her traditional rights, seizing power for herself. We probably go on to declare war on France &#39;just because&#39;.<br><br>7/ UKIP/Green coalition. This government would have the goal of getting the UK <i>out</i> of the EU and <i>into</i> a forest.<br><br>8/ SNP/Sinn Fein/Plaid Cymru/UKIP/Mebyon Kernow/Wessex Regionalist/Yorkshire First coalition. AKA &#39;the Coalition for Independence from Everything&#39;. After five years, the formerly-United Kingdom would be a patchwork of city states.<br><br>9/A sane government which actually puts the people of Britain and the world first. Pffffffft yeahright.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: I&#39;m trusting here that the PPC is capable of having a reasonable conversation about even a hot-button issue such as this. Please don&#39;t prove me wrong, guys. ~hS)</p>

            <p>Every seat except St. Ives has reported (apparently they&#39;re waiting on the ballot papers from the Scilly isles or something), and the Conservatives have won: 330 seats, over half of the 650 available. The Tories have an absolute majority.<br><br>On the plus side, Nigel &#39;UKIP&#39; Farage didn&#39;t get elected (and has now resigned, along with Clegg and Milliband), and Natalie Bennett strengthened the Green Party&#39;s hold on Brighton Pavilion.

They&#39;ve already sold the Royal Mail and half the National Health Service - I guess the next public service to be sold to the highest bidder is, what, schools?

            <p>It was never going to be enough. The right-wing press in this country hates the thought of someone who&#39;s not a Murdoch stooge in power, largely because the Dirty Digger tells them to hate it. Ed&#39;s too left of centre, by which I mean he&#39;s marginally to the left of Attila the bloody Hun. We get five years of Tories forcing more misery on the poor and disabled and disadvantaged because it&#39;s easier that actually sorting out the nation and making it work, and we had a chance to stop it, and even if it was never going to be enough we could have tried.

That could always change by amendment, but if any candidacy amendment would be made it would be to allow non-Natural Born Citizens run for presidency.  But that isn&#39;t likely to happen.

            <p>There&#39;s a highly active <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30528918">neo-Nazi</a> movement in Sweden and it&#39;s really, really troubling. <br><br>In fact, it seems that Europe in general is being swept by anti-islamization / anti-immigrant movements. France has been subject to  anti-islamic protests ever since the Charlie Hebdo incident (not to mention the Front National), Greece has the Golden Dawn party which is so far to the right that it&#39;s been described as outright fascist and Nazi-like, UKIP is a thing now, and the recent refugee troubles from the conflict in Syria and North Africa are polarizing people on the immigration issue. <br><br>Europe&#39;s political tendencies are shifting towards the right. In this climate of economic troubles and conservatism, it looks like it&#39;s going to stay that way for some time.<br><br><br>Sadly, Canada isn&#39;t better off. Our current conservative government is turning us into an economic, political, and cultural annex of the US. Harper is trying to kill the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Radio Canada-- the organizations set in place to distribute Canadian culture to avoid this very situation. He also passed a bill that allows CSIS and the RCMP to mess around in the affairs of ordinary Canadians in the name of &quot;national security&quot;. What are we? A police state? I guess we can kiss privacy goodbye because Big Brother is watching now. Let the paranoia and fear-mongering begin.<br><br><br>I should move to Antarctica.

            <p>Hey, guys, sorry I wasn&#39;t active last week but I got sick. Luckily, I&#39;m a bit better now and can actually focus my thoughts (that&#39;s actually pretty difficult, when I&#39;m sick). <br><br>Now, as you may or may not remember, I asked you before about creating a magic-user as my agent. Yeah, I pretty much got the personality, overall design and all the necessary stuff, all I need now is a wrapping. Now, I have three possible outcomes for the character, so I am here to ask for help:<br><br>#1 - a Homo Magi from DC Universe. In case you don&#39;t know, the Homo Magi are a sub-species of humans who are capable of using magic. Most famous example would be Zatanna Zatara, who uses Backwards Magic. This is kinda risky, since I couldn&#39;t notice clear limitations and boundaries of this type. Any DC experts and fans are more than welcome to help me! :)<br><br>#2 - something for my Whovian brethren. If you remember &quot;The Shakespeare Code&quot;, you know what I&#39;m talking about. This option features a Human/Carrionite hybrid. Again, a quick summary: You know how we use numbers for our science? Well, the Carrionites do the same thing using words, therefore it is easy to mistake it for magic. Again, I&#39;m counting for the Whovians&#39; help.<br><br>Option no. 3 is <i>The Secrets of Immortal Nicolas Flamel</i> and, so far, it&#39;s the most probable one. I mentioned it before.<br><br>So, yeah, I&#39;m counting on you guys. Apologies, if you find this annoying, or thinking that it&#39;s some kid trying to do a BAMF character, because it really isn&#39;t :). <br><br>Also, by the time you read this (probably), it&#39;ll be my one-month-anniversary on the Board. Yay me~ :D</p>

            <p>. . really interesting, I agree with Des: don&#39;t write a character from a canon you don&#39;t feel you know well enough or don&#39;t feel you could get around not being a complete expert in by careful research. For example, I have a Klingon agent, but while I know Star Trek pretty well, a lot of the material on Klingons and Klingon society is in the series that I haven&#39;t seen very much of. Since my Klingon is from the original series (which I have seen), I rely only partially on my memory of TOS, which is mainly outsider POV anyway, and make sure to boost my knowledge with close reading of the Memory Alpha wiki articles on Klingons. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself an expert on Klingons...but I do feel confident writing one!<br><br>That&#39;s not to say that research doesn&#39;t apply even with characters you know more about. I also look at wiki articles for Vulcans (T&#39;Zar) and Time Lords (the Reader), though not as often since I know and remember more about them without the extra research. Elves probably get the most infrequent amount of extra research, if you take out anything to do with researching names, looking up bits of languages, or checking bits of history.<br><br>Basically, writing characters from canons that provide anything more than &#39;this is its name, its function, and the basic way people react to it&#39; will generally involve at least a little bit of research at some point. How intense or intensive the research gets... well, that&#39;s up to you and it&#39;s up to the canon. Also, your memory of the canon.<br><br>So yeah. Feel better, and also don&#39;t worry about how frequently you&#39;re on or off the Board--people tend to drift in and out a bit, especially around exam times. We&#39;ll often give a warning if we&#39;re about to disappear for a month or so and know in advance, or do some sort of welcome back post if it&#39;s been a long while since we were last on (or even a returnbie post, if it&#39;s been a longer while), but generally speaking, things are fairly casual.<br><br>So don&#39;t stress about how active you are or aren&#39;t able to be. Just focus on getting better :) As you can see, we&#39;re still here!<br><br>Also, hurrah, one month anniversary! *throws confetti* Did you know that in Italian &#39;confetti&#39; actually has something to do with almonds? Sergio Turbo can tell you more, if he&#39;s around...I, unfortunately, have forgotten and am not Italian.<br><br>Good luck with the agent!<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>It&#39;s time for your resident Italian Boarder to start Sergio Turbo&#39;s Italian Lessons!<br><br>&quot;Confetti&quot; is indeed the (plural. Singular is &quot;confetto&quot;) term that designates sugared almonds or similar candies with an hard sugar coating. The Italian term for the small bits of paper thrown around is another - &quot;coriandoli&quot; (singular: coriandolo, though it is rarely used as you rarely need to refer to a single one).<br><br>Another similar case is &quot;pepperoni&quot;: if you think it refers to sausages in Italy, you&#39;re so off-road you&#39;re going to need high-lift suspensions and mud tyres.<br>&quot;Peperoni&quot; (Yes, you also use one &quot;p&quot; too many in America. And what&#39;s with always using the plural even when referring to single things?), singular &quot;peperone&quot;, is actually the term for bigger, sweeter peppers.<br>Since I see &quot;pepperoni&quot; used mainly when referring to pizza toppings, though, I might have an idea about how the slip-up happened. Here in Italy a popular pizza topping is peppers and spicy sausages, so whoever tried importing that to the US probably thought &quot;peperoni&quot; referred to the sausages instead.</p>

            <p>The OED attests &#39;peperoni&#39; in English in 1888, in <i>The Times</i>:<br><br><i>There were peperoni, sometimes called diavolini, and poponi.</i><br><br>And then, unusually, they have a note:<br><br><i>Although quot. 1888 suggests an Italian origin, the Italian word is apparently not attested in this sense.</i><br><br>So yeah.

            <p>...it doesn&#39;t hurt to do at least a bit of research on them. While I&#39;m pretty well-versed in <i>Doctor Who</i>, I still wanted to make sure there weren&#39;t any details on Time Lord physiology and post-regeneration symptoms that I might not have known because it came from an episode of Classic <i>Who</i>, or the Expanded Universe, or maybe a detail I just missed.

            <p>I find it so interesting how we have taken the exact same word, applied similar context, and yet have vastly differing reactions to it.<br><br>Now, perhaps I&#39;m just a dumb American, but to me, spastic is just acting in a rapid, clumsy manner. Arms flailing about, tripping over things, is the image that comes to mind. It&#39;s not just being clumsy, but the extreme speed at which it occurs. That, or extreme hyperactivity. Kid hopped up on <i>way</i> too much caffeine, for instance. A rather silly image, that has come to be used as a minor insult, usually for self deprecation. Very similar to nerd, in that respect. Was somewhat offensive, now not even the tiniest bit offensive, even to the perpetually offended.<br><br>However, in the UK, it is one of the most insulting words possible. For fellow dumb Americans, note how Scape felt the need to self-censor, even when using the word to say don&#39;t use it again. Over there, it is second only to retard in terms of insulting for disabled folks, and with very similar meaning.<br><br>To put this in proper context for both sides, I am going to apply the same treatment to another word that offends everybody,  the word that I would never use outside of discussing the word itself, and even then would seek to avoid: nigger. I sat for a solid two minutes steeling myself before I wrote that word. That is how offensive it is in my culture. Even now, I am contemplating scrapping this entire analogy, but it is the only word I can think of that is heavy enough to shock people into thinking about this.<br><br>So. Let&#39;s say that there is a culture that uses the word nigger. In that context, it is a word used for black people. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes, it is even used as the color black itself, in very specific contexts. They use nigger as greetings, use it in products, have it used on the television all the time. How angry would you be if you saw this culture? You would be furious! No, that word does not mean what you think it does! Stop using it, now and forever!<br><br>&quot;But why? It&#39;s not offensive! Our definition is not yours! Why should we be offended for you?&quot;<br><br>And here is the rub. It is not offensive to them. Not at all. But for us, it is. So, who is in the right? Should the other culture censor the word in recognition of a definition they do not share, or should we just accept that it means something else over there and leave them alone? I, personally, while feeling uncomfortable, would say they have the right to their definition. The word is not inherently offensive. String those letters together, not every living thing is repulsed by the sound. What makes a word offensive is the context and definition we give it. I would even accept it&#39;s use on, say, a posting board if used by those people. That does not mean I would cringe any less, and would probably contemplate telling them that they should stop using it for my emotional state. But I would not, because respecting differing cultures is important, and if we can make more words less offensive, the better.<br><br>Now, if you excuse me, I have to wash my mouth out with soap.  </p>

            <p>I think its also being culturally self-centered to  think it is offensive.  From what research I did, it appears that it did not really become a derogatory term until the early 80s in the UK, when it had been used to mean hyperactive, etc., and ultimately uncool since the early 50s in the US.  And my question is why should one interpretation be forced to control?  Why should the offensive definition be forced over the unoffensive one?   </p>

            <p>You not being able to say a given word is incredibly minor in the English language, which has a dozen synonyms for everything. Someone being offended by a given word has a far bigger impact and longer-lasting effect.

            <p>Primum non nocere - first, do no harm. Using another word instead of an insulting one - especially in the case where you have other synonyms and the word is obscure anyway - is preferred to hurting other people who might find it offensive.</p>

            <p>There are going to be situations like this, no matter how much you try. One group will find a word completely inoffensive; another group will feel as though it&#39;s a personal attack. It&#39;s an inevitable result of living in a world where different cultures often communicate, and for obvious reasons it&#39;s very common on the Internet.<br><br>I don&#39;t think we can solve this problem either by banning all words that are offensive to someone hearing them. Nor can we solve it by allowing all words that are not offensive to the person speaking them. Neither one works because by the nature of different cultures, people will simply not be able to keep track of every word that every culture they come in contact with would consider offensive.<br><br>And yet it is a problem. So let&#39;s look at our goals: Neither side intends an insult, and our goal is to communicate clearly.<br><br>Both sides have to compromise here. If you are in the group that uses a word like &quot;spastic&quot; as a neutral descriptive term, and you discover that some people see it as an insult, you put it in your mental dictionary of things not to say to those particular people. On the other hand, if you are in the group that sees &quot;spastic&quot; as an ablist slur, when you hear someone using it, you need to look at the context and see what that person&#39;s intent might be, asking them directly if you are unsure, and take their intended message into account.<br><br>If they did not mean it as a slur, then you can either let it pass, or you can inform them how you see that particular word--and I do mean inform, with the intent to educate rather than shame, because no one should have to be ashamed of an insult that was never intended to be one.<br><br>The critical point here is that both sides need to listen to each other. If they don&#39;t, unintended insults can turn into intended insults.<br><br>I&#39;m autistic. I suck at social skills and I find, a lot of the time, that I&#39;ve said something that insulted someone unintentionally. If they tell me that I have hurt them, I add it to my mental file of things not to say and go on. But I need to be told. It&#39;s just so frustrating when people keep it to themselves, expecting me to understand without being told that they have been insulted, and becoming angrier and angrier. If there&#39;s no communication, there can be no understanding. If you&#39;re not willing to try to understand the other person&#39;s perspective, then you will forever be butting heads and insulting each other by accident.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know of any words or phrases which are acceptable in the UK but insulting or offensive in the US. I&#39;m sure there are some, but I don&#39;t personally know what they are.<br><br>So if I were to use one - let&#39;s imagine the word &#39;mardy&#39; is a heinous insult over there (it&#39;s a Northern dialect term for &#39;grumpy&#39;, for the record) - and one of our American Boarders said they were offended by it, do you know what I&#39;d do?<br><br>The answer is &#39;do my best to stop using it on the Board&#39;. Not &#39;argue that people shouldn&#39;t be offended by it because it&#39;s not offensive to me&#39;.

            <p>My original intent was to look at and discuss how it is that we could take the same word and have some people look at it as the most minor poke possible, and another the most ablest phrase possible. However, at the time, I just came out of a class where we were discussing words and their power. In the class, it was hammered in how much words only mean what you let them mean. Which then got me thinking, &quot;Why should we assign this horrid connotation to this word? Especially when there is a much less offensive version out there. Why can&#39;t we all use the less offensive one?&quot; This became translated into, &quot;I have the right to say what I want, your feelings be darned!&quot; which was not what I meant to say. It is what I said, I will not try and claim you all misunderstood, but it was not what I meant. An error of communication on my part.<br><br>Yes, you are right. If somebody said a term was horribly offensive, and explained why, I would avoid it for the future. And, in this case, I will. It may slip though, just because of how we use it here, but call me out on it if i do accidentally use it. I only wanted to look at why it is offensive, and see if we could possibly loosen some of it&#39;s offensive power by not associating it with the negative aspects. However, I see that this is a gradual change that must happen. Blame academia for my ignorance. </p>

            <p>Because inevitably if it gets drawn out the odds of me unintentionally offending someone will likely skyrocket.  First and foremost, I will start by saying I have absolutely no intention of offending anyone, if I do I am preemptively apologizing.  Now on to my point.<br><br>I think the real crux of the issue is not the word itself.  It is the intent.  See it is something that I have noticed clearly in the US.  In this current era there is a cultural consensus to treat everything with &quot;kid gloves&quot; so to speak.  We are too afraid of offending anyone that it really ascribes more power to the word than it otherwise would have.  A perfect example of this is the reaction of a great many people in the United States around the time Djano Unchained was released.  There were a great many people up in arms over the repeated use of the N-word in the film.  Now for those of you that do not know, that refers to the word &quot;nigger&quot;.  To provide some more context, it seems to me that the use of that word, in the US at least, is perfectly acceptable for African Americans to use, but often times the moment a, usually European-American, mentions the word, people lose their minds over it. I also remember, how I was terrified in one of my classes years back, and we were reading Huck Finn.  The word comes up repeatedly throughout the story, and I had to read it aloud.  I was terrified because of the stigma attached to the word.  And there is the rub.  A word itself only has the meaning which humans give it.  I do not think a word itself should be considered offensive.  It, in my view, is restricted to the intent.  For example returning to the particular word at issue, spastic, has (some evidence suggests) been used to mean hyperactive and the other things World Jumper mentioned previously since the 1950s.        I understand that it is considered offensive in the UK, but to that I ask, why should that particular world view be foisted upon everyone else?  Frankly if we use words that might be offensive, the overall language that can be used will be limited.  There are too many words that are innocuous to one culture, but highly offensive to another.  Taking an example going the other way, the word &quot;fag&quot;.  From what I understand in the British Isles, it is a largely innocuous word for cigarette.  But in the US, it has most recently become a highly offensive word for a homosexual, do I think that the use of that word should be banned, because it is offensive?  No.  Because I think it really does come down the intent.  It is clear that the OP had no intention of offending anyone.  I think the better approach is to focus on the intent.<br><br>Now again I did not intend to offend anyone, and if I did I am sorry.  And that is the point.  I think the focus should not be on the word itself, but on the intent.  To kind of close it let us say that a group of One Eyed, One Horned, Flying Purple People Eaters arrive on Earth.  Lets say that a group of people then create the word Smerple to refer to those Purple People Eaters, that word should not be offensive just because it exists, but the offense should only be attached if there is rancor, hatred, derision, etc. attached to that word.  And that&#39;s where I am going to end, because I can already tell where this would go if I continue.  So again, I mean no offense, and I think intent should be the focus.  Not the word itself.</p>

And therefore you should apologise to me for being offended by something I said, because the fact that my language is offensive doesn&#39;t mean you should be offended by it. That&#39;s what freedom of speech means, right? Right?&quot;<br><br>To which I can only respond thus:<br><br>You&#39;re being offensive. Maybe you&#39;re not being deliberately offensive, but that doesn&#39;t mean the square root of sod-all. Don&#39;t be offensive. Don&#39;t use offensive language. And for the love of whichever god you hold dear, don&#39;t try and justify being offensive on the grounds that not everyone finds what you&#39;re saying offensive, because that&#39;s about as completely beside the bloody point as it&#39;s possible for a thing to be. You&#39;re just arguing the toss, and talking a load of it while you&#39;re at it. So please: don&#39;t bloody do that.</p>

            <p>The way I saw it, now part of this is my own world view.  I am an ardent supporter of the First Amendment of the United State Constitution.  I have even written on it, unpublished, but that&#39;s not relevant here, and I see this whole ideology in the US of political correctness as a very real threat to what has been enshrined in the US Constitution.  I despise any form of censorship, and to me this is using offensiveness as a shield to censor.  And I see the slippery slope that can too easily be crossed.  <br><br>Now also to me it seemed like you were essentially jumping down the OP&#39;s throat.  Specifically when you said &quot;it does not mean what you think it means.&quot;  That&#39;s a false statement.  In American English is does mean exactly what he thought it meant.  So the way I look at both of what you and Huinesoron are saying, is that British English is appropriate and should control.  It is like you are saying our interpretation is the only appropriate interpretation.  Which, with all due respect I vehemently disagree with.  And further as to the derogatory part of your comment, our point is that in American English, it is <b>not</b> derogatory and to my knowledge it never has been.  This is again getting to the point that it seems that British English is the only appropriate interpretation.<br><br>Frankly for me I take Voltaire&#39;s &quot;I do not agree with what you have to say, but I&#39;ll defend to the death your right to say it,&quot; to its logical extreme.  Someone could come up with the most offensive thing in the universe for someone like me and repeatedly use with all the hatred there could be, and I still would not argue that they should stop using it.  Because to me, that&#39;s what Freedom of Speech means.  This may well be irreconcilable between us, because the European and American views on free speech are different.  The US has interpreted our Freedom of Speech to be incredibly broad, much more so than what European Courts have done with their respective free speech provisions.  And that&#39;s where the real divide seems to come from here.<br><br>I know that at least French Courts, and I believe the ECJ have both held that offensive language can be restricted, no such ruling would survive the US Supreme Court.  Perhaps that helps show where my arguments are coming from.  </p>

            <p>First and foremost, I do not belong to the right wing political philosophy.  I am actually an Independent with some Libertarian Leanings.  Second pap?  As in &quot;reading matter or entertainment that is worthless or lacking in substance?&quot;  In other words it seems you are equating a &quot;Right Wing&quot;, though I prefer the term Conservative Ideology to garbage?  I am not offended, but really?  Discounting an entire ideology just because you do not agree with it?  That seems more than a little provincial.

            <p>There are different kinds of it.  I do not subscribe to the Libertarian Party in the US.  In the US Libertarian Leanings also constitute small government.  And that is were I fall in in.  I am not in any one party.<br><br>Each party has a very large platform.  I take from all major groups.  What I take from Libertarian is also what I predominately take from Conservatives.  When in doubt, small government.  This is also a Libertarian Perspective.  That&#39;s all I take from them.  My theory of Constitutional Interpretation is also Conservative.  Social Policies on the other hand are a full mix for me.  Generally I am more in line with US Democrats, though I think several of our social policies need considerable work. Unlike Libertarians I do not want to dismantle them.  Environmentally I am more of a Moderate Liberal.  <br><br>So a better way to describe it would be an Independent who defaults to Small Government unless I think there is good reason for large government.   </p>

            <p>And while it is true you can sue for slander and libel, a very few of them ever succeed.  I am using this as perspective.  The OP said they were American, I am saying that under controlling US Doctrine, the OP&#39;s applicable law, that is not reason for censorship.  It seems my point got buried.  <br><br>Let me rephrase to what I was trying to say prior to going off on a pseudo-legalese analysis.    My real issue was the comment that Scape made saying that &quot;it does not mean what you think it means.&quot;  Which is a false statement.  In the US where both the OP and I are from the context the word was used is not only acceptable, but is the controlling definition of that word.    It almost seemed to me that Scape was suggesting that the British Interpretation is the appropriate interpretation.  I have a very fundamental disagreement with that.<br><br>And you are actually not fully correct about the US Constitution not applying to private individuals.  I forget the name off the top of my head, but there was a case involving the Elks Lodge Organization, where in the US Supreme Court extended the 14th Amendment (Race Discrimination) to apply to a private organization.  There was also Sullivan v. NY Times case which on the libel end, makes it very difficult for a private party to succeed in a libel claim due to Freedom of Speech and Press Claim.  The US&#39;s protections are far more broad than the EU.  Here the trend has been along the lines of &quot;You can say what you want unless it fits into one of very few narrow exceptions.&quot;  <br><br>And that gets back to the point where I think the analysis should be on intent not the word itself.  My over-saturated brain turned off its filter and I had a poorly thought out visceral reaction.  For that I do apologize.   </p>

            <p>The point is that Scape is right and the word has additional meanings - ie, not what you think it means; in this case, it&#39;s offensive. In our current case, it doesn&#39;t really matter which definition is &#39;appropriate&#39;, since we&#39;re not arguing about the meaning of the word, we&#39;re arguing whether it&#39;s acceptable to use it.<br>Maybe an example will help: suppose I&#39;ll come and tell you that you&#39;re a son of a bitch. You&#39;d be offended, right? The fact that in Hebrew it is also used as a compliment is irrelevant; you&#39;d still be offended and you&#39;d probably ask that I will apologise, no? Free speech isn&#39;t free beer, &#39;do whatever you want&#39;. Having a right to free speech doesn&#39;t mean you have a right to offend other people, and other people can and will tell you to stop it. Free speech doesn&#39;t protect you from the consequences of what you say.<br>Anyway, dealing with the US legal system (which is, admittedly, very different from the Israeli system to which I am used), you&#39;re missing <i>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc.</i> (1985) which basically says that no, you can&#39;t slander people, even if you&#39;re not malicious.<br><br>I hope I didn&#39;t miss anything in here, I tend to lose myself in my argumentation process.</p>

            <p>First I actually would not be offended.  Words do not offend me, I cannot conceive a situation where I would be actually offended.  There are multiple forms of liable.  There is libel against private persons, which as a rule is easier to prove.  Though the trend in the past 15-20 years has also made that more difficult to prove.  Then there is public figures or public controversies which is Sullivan v. Time which do require actual malice are virtually impossible to prove.  The recent trend has extended this to private parties.  Especially if the Media is one of the parties.  If the Media is involved it is virtually impossible to recover for defamation.  Defamation itself is a very complicated issue that includes exceptions to exceptions and so on.  I do concede that if it a defamation suit between to private individuals the odds of recovery are much greater.  But here is the main way it works.  Sullivan&#39;s Actual Malice standard only must apply to public individuals, but subsequent trends have indicated that without malice it can get difficult to prove damages.  Further Defamation itself is an intentional tort.  That means that it requires intent to defame.  In order to prove the cause of action there must be a materially false statement of fact made about the party seeking to recover.  Even under the basic definition of Defamation, there are massive exceptions.  For example: opinions will not be defamation  (see virtually every case involving tabloids, there is a reason most suits against tabloids occur in the UK, much easier to prove their equivalent cause of action), further, truth is also an absolute defense.  And if the defendant can prove there was no intent to cause harm, most courts will also dismiss.    In the US there are dozens of Supreme Court decisions that support virtually every possible interpretation.  There is a reason most lawyers in the US get paid very well.  The majority trend that I have seen looking through the Court&#39;s precedents since Sullivan is that it is very hard to succeed on a defamation claim unless the plaintiff can prove either actual malice or willful disregard of the truth of the fact asserted.  It seems that the exceptions in this case have swallowed the rule.  That is the trend that I have seen in recent years.  Though that does not take into account that there are 50 different States that are allowed some degree of wiggle room on what Defamation is and how to prove it.  </p>

            <p>1) Assuming people won&#39;t get offended when you say something offensive is detached from reality. People do get offended and assuming otherwise is simply wishful thinking.<br>2) My point isn&#39;t that it&#39;s easy to get damages via a defamation suit in the States. My point is that, even in the States, the freedom of speech isn&#39;t absolute.

            <p>First, some background:<br><br>The term &quot;Mary Sue&quot; is considered a misogynist slur by some groups. I don&#39;t think you were around when we were pretty much flat-out told by one of them to stop using it for that reason; I&#39;m guessing not. We decided to keep it on the grounds that we&#39;d never used it that way and indeed had never even considered that it <i>could</i> be used that way, considering we&#39;re always talking about fictional characters when we use it, never real women. Plus, we have a wiki that carefully explains what we <i>do</i> mean to avoid confusion.<br><br>Your view would seem to make us all horrible jerkwads in this case, since we&#39;ve continued using a term that we have been informed is offensive to some.

            <p>I think you&#39;re being intentionally thick. It&#39;s obvious why people think the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot; is sexist; they think it&#39;s applying a derogatory term to exactly the same kind of power fantasies that get a free pass from men.<br><br>The problem is that nobody in the PPC actually <i>does</i> that, and by dragging out this argument you&#39;re denigrating the community. A Mary Sue is an anti-feminist character, because a Mary Sue is a <i>bad</i> character, of the kind that is brought up relentlessly as an example of why women shouldn&#39;t be writing in X, Y, or Z by sexist dickless wit-vacuums too busy picking bits of Dorito out of their neckbeard to actually think critically.<br><br>That&#39;s what you&#39;re doing, as far as I&#39;m concerned: not thinking critically. And therefore, since this is a serious bloody topic, I <i>will</i> brush you off, because you&#39;re not treating it with the gravity it deserves. </p>

            <p>Because that <i>is</i> actually a very good point to raise in this conversation. And my personal answer is three- or fourfold:<br><br>1/ I don&#39;t use it around the people who are offended by it - or even could potentially be. I&#39;ve never (I don&#39;t think) left a review calling someone&#39;s character a Mary-Sue. I use it in stories which, ultimately, are meant for people who already agree with me. <sup>_~<br><br>2/</sup> The presence of that explanation on the Wiki - and in my head - is important to me; it&#39;s designed to be the first port of call when the question of whether &#39;Mary-Sue&#39; is appropriate comes up. In a way, actually, the term itself becomes a teaching tool - we say &#39;Mary-Sue&#39;, Suesette says &#39;that&#39;s offensive!&#39;, and I say &#39;actually, this is what we mean - and this is why the characters we say it about are <i>actually</i> bad&#39;.<br><br>3/ In my series designed to be the face of (my idea of) the PPC - <i>Driftwood</i>, the one I posted on Fanfiction.net - I don&#39;t use the phrase &#39;Mary-Sue&#39; at all. I substituted &#39;Suvian&#39; as a generic, gender-neutral term. It seems to work. I did that deliberately to avoid causing offense.<br><br>And the reason for all of the above:<br><br>4/ We use &#39;Mary-Sue&#39; for historical reasons - it&#39;s what Jay and Acacia used. We have a department named after them, and no real justification in-universe for changing it. If the offensive word being discussed in this thread was &#39;alcoholic&#39;, and someone was trying to talk about &#39;Alcoholics Anonymous&#39;, then yeah, that would be analogous. But... it&#39;s not.<br><br>Like I say, this is a hS response. At least one of my reasons doesn&#39;t apply to anyone else, and potentially all of the first three don&#39;t apply to any given person. But it&#39;s what <i>I</i> think.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Anyone want to beta a bit of nonsense that I&#39;m most definitely blaming on hS?<br><br>Okay, let me explain. As happens more often than I&#39;m going to admit, Huinesoron made a comment that inspired me to write something. Surprisingly, this time it&#39;s both longer than 500 words (803 at last count) and complete. And, as it&#39;s both not quite a drabble and at least borderline canon, I&#39;d like it to be betaed before I post it.<br><br>The only canon it involves is the general PPC canon, although some vague knowledge of how Vulcans behave might be useful. (<i>Naruto</i> canon is also briefly involved, but I wasn&#39;t really trying to get it perfectly correct--it&#39;s as accurate as the knowledge of the agent in question, which is very minimal). I mainly just want a second opinion on the agent interactions, and to know if any of the wording turned out odd.<br><br>Anyone interested?<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: This can also become a general thread for beta-searching, if anyone else has something they want betaed.

            <p>I will admit that the Hulk stories have been somewhat... lacking, as of late. But you really can&#39;t blame Disney for merging the MCU with the animated canon. It was a brilliant business move, and I&#39;m surprised it took them as long as it did to thaw out Walt Disney so he could make that call. The Hulklings are the best interpretation of Huey, Duey, and Louie I&#39;ve seen in years! <br><br>As for Clone Saga 2, I agree. They really jumped the shark with with that one. ...speaking of sharks, have you heard from World-Jumper? I haven&#39;t seen him since the wedding at SeaWorld...</p>

There are currently (at least) two PPC timelines which take place in the timeframe of that &#39;Real World&#39;.<br><br>Whether Alby <i>actually</i> gets any books, of course, is something none of us can know... yet.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hey! :&gt; I&#39;d very much like to join the PPC. Your little(Or, not-so-little) community seems so cool! And, because I have no idea how else to introduce myself, here are the answers to the questions on the wiki!<br><br>-Have you read the PPC Constitution, the Original Series, this FAQ, and/or the variety of other helpful materials we have prepared for you? <br>~I&#39;ve read the Original Series and the Constitution, as well as the Board FAQ and the article on Permission, along with other assorted PPC Wiki articles.<br><br>-What are your fandoms?<br>~ Mainly Homestuck, (Yes, I&#39;m Homestuck Trash /shame/ ) Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, Doctor Who and Merlin.<br><br>-How did you find the PPC?<br>~I googled &#39;Tenth Walker&#39; (I was bored) and found the article. Then I got sucked into the cavernous black hole that is the PPC Wiki, and decided to join the community instead of just being a creepy stalker-gal!<br><br>-What&#39;s your favorite spin-off?/Who are your favorite agents?<br>~I like Acacia. She&#39;s like me when I get grumpy.<br><br>-What else do you do for fun?<br>~Whoa, this is a toughie. (Lel nope) I love drawing, and I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m pretty good at it. (/shameless advertising/ /follow me on instagram/ /username Kandlekitty/ /I&#39;m so sorry/) I also enjoy cooking (Sadly, I adore eating just as much- I&#39;m slightly overweight), swimming, ice-skating and long walks/hikes in the great outdoors. And cats. Cats are fabulous.<br><br>Extra details about me: I&#39;m a girl, I&#39;m 14, I live in Singapore (No, that&#39;s NOT in China. It&#39;s a small island off the coast of Malaysia. One of our Founding Fathers just died, Mr Lee Kuan Yew) I&#39;m half Chinese and half Greek. I can&#39;t speak Greek though. I&#39;ve only ever lived here. (I pretty much look Asian though ;-; /wait is that a bad thing/ /I don&#39;t even know anymore/)<br><br>So...Nice to meet y&#39;all?<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Welcome aBoard! You might want to leave your sanity in that bin over there, it will be safely disposed of later.<br>I&#39;ve tried reading Homestuck, but I had an issue with my computer and I didn&#39;t want to either start over or find back where I was (somewhere in Act 2, I think?). *shrugs*<br><br>Anyways, uh, I don&#39;t really have any questions to ask, so... Take this plush Eldritch Abomination! I&#39;ve been trying to find which one it&#39;s actually supposed to represent, but the seven-dimensional geometries and severe impact on sanity inflicted by merely thinking about it make it kinda hard. It&#39;s pretty cute, though. And fluffy. And my brain is melting. Have fun!</p>

            <p>Whoa, so how was your pie? Baking&#39;s a bit too tedious and not hands-on enough for me :( Singapore&#39;s pretty cool. There are 4 main races here, (Pretty cool right? We&#39;re so multiracial :p) namely Chinese(the main one), Malays, Indians and Eurasians(That&#39;s me! :p) People here mainly speak English as a whole, but we&#39;re a bilingual country(It&#39;s compulsory and a bit of a pain in the arse :c) so Chinese learn Chinese, Malays learn Malay, Indians mostly learn either Tamil or Hindi and a few other dialects. Eurasians have to learn whichever language their Asian parent learned. Seriously though Chinese it the WORST LANGUAGE there isn&#39;t even an ALPHABET you literally have to memorise symbols for every single word-<br><br>(Mini -Balrog, cat, what&#39;s the difference? And I lost my sanity a looooong time ago, so I&#39;ll just fit right in I guess!)</p>

            <p>I must admit, I&#39;m a little curious to see if they&#39;re actually going to do anything. So far they&#39;ve just created an account with &quot;F*** you!&quot; as the content, which I personally find more amusing than annoying. (I worked in customer support; I&#39;ve been sworn at with <i>far</i> more malice and laughed about it.) And, er... how much of a TOS violation is that? As you may recall, I am unfamiliar with the exact rules as pertains to user pages.<br><br>I suppose they could be waiting out the new-account latency period, if they intend to go after protected pages, but that&#39;s mere suspicion. If they actually commit some sort of vandalism, then we&#39;ll have a solid reason to block them. And possibly an entertaining story to tell, too.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...then wouldn&#39;t they be of different genera, rather than different species?<br><br>I do not wish to be demeaning in any way, but I believe your logic behind grouping the two species in the <i>Trollus</i> genus would be akin to grouping humans and chimpanzees under the genus <i>Homo</i>. Trolls are active and systematic in their dismantling of their prey, while those who merely produce profane expectoration would be more properly called &quot;Flamers&quot;.<br>Of course, it may also be possible that we have identified the two species as being anatomically similar for so long that they were classed in the same genus, in a similar manner to <i>Brontosaurus</i> being equated with <i>Apatosaurus</i> <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-brontosaurus-is-back1/">until recently.</a><br><br>So in much the same way as <i>Brontosaurus</i> being given its own genus once again, I propose that <i>Trollus vulgaris</i> shall be reclassified as <i>Flammasermonis vulgaris</i>. The genus name means &quot;flame speech&quot; in Latin, referring to its incessant habit of regurgitating inflammatory snippets of dialogue. From personal observation, <i>Flammasermonis</i> also has less developed and dextrous forelimbs, a smaller braincase, and a tendency to attack even innocent parties without provocation. <i>Trollus malevelous</i>, of course, shall remain within the <i>Trollus</i> genus.</p>

            <p>... the vague meaning of the cladistics comment. Though that does require &#39;troll&#39; to either be non-monophyletic (a group that aren&#39;t all more closely related to each other than anything else), or a very high-level term (like &#39;mammal&#39; rather than &#39;dog&#39;).

            <p>The prequel trilogy gets a lot more flak than it it deserves, IMO. They were good, just... not AS good as the originals. They were trying too hard. The special effects are pretty cool, though. Also, how much you like or dislike Jar-Jar is dependent on your age and which movies you saw first. I grew up with the prequels first - I liked him when I was little, but dislike directly correlates to each year of age. He went from &quot;haha, that guy is funny!&quot; to &quot;HOW HAS HE NOT GOTTEN HIMSELF AND EVERYONE ELSE KILLED BY NOW?!?&quot; &gt;:( He should have been squashed by the tank.</p>

            <p>This way you get the original uninterrupted first to get the exposure.  Then you get the prequels.  I would then recommend after finishing them start over with 1,2,3,4,5,6.  And in my opinion Empire is by far the best of the six.  And I think that Attack of the Clones is the weakest in the series.  One is definitely the most kid friendly of them though.  Because at the time I saw it originally 1999 I kind of liked Jar Jar.  Now looking back on it Jar Jar just kind of irks me.  But he is definitely a kid friendly character.  </p>

            <p>Fanfic makes up the great majority of fanworks, but it isn&#39;t all of it. There are a such thing as fancomics, fan movies, and other such nonstandard fan-ishness. Some of these qualify as badfic. <br><br>So, what alternations would be needed for a mission to fit into that medium? Has it been done before? How would the agents fit in? Would it even work? <br><br>I have a few ideas, but I&#39;d like some input for a more cohesive set of rules.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if anyone else here plays Star Trek Online (usually just called STO) but I&#39;ve seen some really bad foundry missions. The foundry is basically a thing that allows you to make your own missions. A... startlingly high amount of them are good, but that just means the bad ones stand out more. It might be possible to make a foundry mission that parodies another really bad mission, but without railroading, I&#39;m not completely sure how this would work. I&#39;m sure it could, but it would take some effort. Who knows, when I ask for Permission, I might try this out.<br><br>And fan comics would be easy enough, if you can match the art style of the badcomic author. Fan films aren&#39;t worth your time. Most of them are just really short flash animations drawn by a five-year-old. The big, long films tend to either be really good, or never completed. But I do encourage you to explore these mediums. It might end up as something wonderful. Or awful. Hopefully the former.</p>

            <p>I think that would be an amazing (although time consuming )idea!<br>And I just think it would be utterly fabulous if Agents had panel-ladders for comics that they can lay across the page and crawl up, skipping a few panels and maybe cover more distance? Or maybe the spaces between panels could be wormhole-like and send them to another panel. Oh gosh there are so many possibilities- <b>*Fangirls*</b></p>

            <p>The thing with the comic is that the art is really just the same views of all of the characters copy and pasted over and over. It would actually be pretty easy to fake it and add in agents. The jarring factor of the comic already exists. <br>Another way to distinguish the agents, in this comic in particular, would be to draw them in black and white or have some sort of &quot;plot hole&quot; within the story that they could be looking in and out of. <br>The entire mission could be told in comic format, with the style of the agents established early on and carried through the comic. I know that this is kind of different than how written missions work but maybe comic works call for different protocols. </p>

I suppose one could take the actual panels and edit agents and events into them, but I have a feeling it would be more trouble than its worth. It would likely be awkward at best, and actively jarring at worst.</p>

            <p>Well, I was thinking of just using a lot of screencaps in a regular PPC story, but with the added caveat that they could not appear in the actual art, because then they&#39;d be noticed. They could mingle with background crowds, hide behind trees,  and so on, but they couldn&#39;t be in the shot, nor do anything that would affect it (speaking loudly enough that they would get speech bubbles, for example) until it was time to kill/exorcise the Sue, at which point they&#39;d use something like Peruvian Instant Darkness powder to conceal their actions from the audience.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t count if it&#39;s a character point of view (for example, a character looks directly at the metaphorical camera, and the (disguised) PPC agents are behind that viewpoint), unless the character would react strongly to their presence (say, if they were in orc disguise in a Lord of the Rings comic).</p>

            <p>For one thing, you could mock its shameless attitude to content creation by having them literally stitched onto a crappy bargain-bin background. For another, you can draw parallels to Time Lord art if you&#39;ve got an agent familiar with Doctor Who. For a third, screw this thing up the hole it uses to micturate with an angry ferret covered in razor wire.</p>

            <p>... For someone who can at least decently draw. Making a mission in comic form would be pretty cool, IMO. You could have the pre- and post-mission in text, with the medium changing when the agents enter the badcomic. They could even complain about being badly drawn, if you can/want to (at least temporarily) draw them in roughly the same style as the badcomic. (There could even be a CAD setting for fixing that, as with tense shifts)<br>(I&#39;m not gonna do that, though. I can&#39;t even draw a stickman properly.)<br>As for fan movies... Yeah, missioning them in the same medium would be much harder. Which is a pity, because some of this stuff definitely is mission material. (*cough* Dusk&#39;s Dawn *cough*)</p>

            <p>To me, great parts of a mission’s appeal are the hilarious scenes the agents experience when the world interprets words that are ambiguous or just incomprehensible or don’t mean what the suethor believes them to mean. You obviously can’t do this in a visual medium. Can agents missioning a fanfilm read the words? Probably not, unless the sporker actually has access to the script, so there’s no reading ahead. In a comic, it may be fun to watch the agents stumble from panel to panel, but the inherent discontinuity is not a problem specific to badcomics.<br><br>I don’t know how to make it work; I only see problems there.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Not so much for live-action work (although there could be crappy visual effects), but for comics, art, most games, and animated fanfilms I&#39;d say there&#39;s potential for badly-drawn things (especially those rendered symbolically) to cause problems, either because they are so badly-drawn it is impossible to figure out what they <i>are</i>, or because they retain their wonky shapes/colors/whatever when Agents manipulate them or move them into another environment or perspective.<br><br>Since somebody else already mentioned it, take Dusk&#39;s Dawn as an example: the Agents could wind up physically bumping into those floating evil Dusk heads, or the way the stretcher doesn&#39;t change position at all when dropped could cause the entire thing to actually manifest as a rigid object.<br><br>In general, distorted perspective could actually make things huge/tiny/lopsided, characters could keep their mutant proportions when seen from a different angle in assassination/otherwise-non-in-work scenes, etc. I remember from by aborted <i>Sonichu</i> &#39;fic that I planned to have this car brought out of the comic and become a three-dimensional object, whereupon it would constantly drift left (<a href="http://www.sonichu.com/w/images/6/60/Son-ChuVehicle.jpg"><a href="http://www.sonichu.com/w/images/6/60/Son-ChuVehicle.jpg">http://www.sonichu.com/w/images/6/60/Son-ChuVehicle.jpg</a></a>).</p>

            <p>That&#39;s either a really good or a really bad idea. I mean, aside from the fact that the author is autistic, his self-insert Stu character is so overpowered that taking him down would be almost impossible...<br>But it&#39;s just so <i>bad!</i> And a really good opportunity to try a mission in comic form.

            <p>I recall that my original reservations towards missioning Sonichu had less to do with how the author would react (I doubted he would ever even know about it) but more because the <i>content</i> of the comic was so objectionable in places (Issue 8, anyone?) that I was reluctant to even deal with the issues it raised.</p>

            <p>Yeah, a mission to Sonichu would pretty much have to consist of the agents covering only the very general ideas (all the Gary Stus, the plagiarism, the protagonist-centered morality, the bigotry, the science and history fail, and the general terribleness of the everything) before portaling in a black hole and spaghettifying everything (I do have a suitable black hole in mind for the job if it ever comes to that).<br><br>Otherwise, not only would we be there for months and probably mishandle a lot of things (he deals with a lot of things that people have very strong opinions on), but the agents would go insane from prolonged exposure to horrific writing without some soothing destruction. Also, we&#39;d discover if it was possible to die from bleeprin overdose, because I&#39;m pretty sure whichever unlucky agents were assigned to the job would be trying for that.<br></p>

            <p>Looks like most of the really objectionable/divisive content is located later in the comic&#39;s run. I think it would actually be possible to do a mission that skipped most of it provided that the world died some time around Issue 7.</p>

If you&#39;re using it to give your characters an advantage over the Sues (like it&#39;s some sort of special anti-Sue weapon), that would be a bit more questionable in my eyes.<br><br>Also, come up with a good in-universe reason as to why your agents might have such a thing.

            <p>As before, all my earlier points stand: You have interesting characters, you&#39;ve been around long enough that I feel I have a good idea of what you&#39;re like, and you can tell a story. As for your SPaG? <br><br>Very good this time. I did notice a few minor typos, but it&#39;s infinitely much better than last time. One thing I will flag up is that you seem to like bolding words when your characters speak to add emphasis. You might want to try avoiding that, but otherwise well done. So, it is my pleasure to say <b>Permission granted</b>!</p>

            <p>Congrats on getting Permission, Edhelistar! I should probably start writing my request, since I&#39;ve got my agent concepts pretty much figured out...

            <p>Very well done! I look forward to seeing your agents in action.<br><br><br>I have but one nitpick: you mention a NATO-standard pistol as Yuna&#39;s weapon. NATO doesn&#39;t actually have a standard issue pistol-- ammunition is standardized (9x19mm Parabellum for pistols, 5.56x45mm or 7.62x51m for rifles) but not weapons. A quick look at Wikipedia&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_pistol#Issue_by_nation">list of service pistols</a> suggest that most NATO countries equip their soldiers with HK, SIG Sauer, or Glock 9mm pistols (with the notable exception of Belgium, which uses Fabrique Nationale&#39;s Five-seveN and its weird, tiny  bullet).</p>

            <p>... the more of it the better. And it seems we aren&#39;t the only ones:<br><br><i>&quot;The Glock 19 is effectively a reduced-size Glock 17, called the &quot;Compact&quot; by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement.&quot;</i><br><br>Quote from Wikipedia. It seems also the guys that made <i>The Avengers</i> love their little details too. <br><br>And although Yuna doesn&#39;t come from the same continuum,  the use of that weapon would make sense, so I&#39;m going to keep it.</p>

            <p>I think every companion comes to love the Doctor, in different ways, because there&#39;s a lot of different kinds of love. Hell, the smartest thing Homestuck ever did was recognise that there&#39;s at least four (and it cribbed that from a GCSE RS lesson). It&#39;s there when they keep coming back to him, it&#39;s there when Sarah Jane and Jo waited and waited, it&#39;s there in people who barely even met him want to come away with him. You live him. And if the stars are coming right, and the wind&#39;s in the west, then he might just love you back.<br><br>Time Lords touch the world lightly. They have to. They&#39;re like Tolkien&#39;s elves; immortal, save by the hand of another or themselves. They&#39;re also like Greek gods, in a way; proud and strong, but flawed, and not always right, and not always even good. We&#39;re all aware of what Greek gods did repeatedly to mortals (in a variety of positions and with dubious regard for consent), too, so it fits that way as well. The Doctor needed someone to love, because a pet theory of mine is that he sees Earth as a Gallifrey that doesn&#39;t have to go wrong, even more so in NuWho; he fell in love with the planet, and especially after losing everything, he wants to love someone. That someone is Rose, and I can&#39;t think of anyone more suitable.<br><br>Of course it doesn&#39;t last. Things don&#39;t. But things aren&#39;t always beautiful because they last, to correct the line from Age Of Ultron. Sometimes they&#39;re beautiful because they&#39;re a girl stuck in a loop waiting for something to happen, and then it does. Rose is <i>normal</i>. Rose is a London girl who worked in a department store. Rose is just as messed up as the rest of us, and she&#39;s needy, and a little clingy at times... and she&#39;s smart, and she&#39;s courageous, and she wins. In a small way. She gets the life she wants.<br><br>Time Lords touch the worlds they visit only lightly.<br><br>Worlds are allowed to touch them back.</p>

            <p>You have a very good point about love and the Doctor&#39;s relationship with Earth and its inhabitants. I never thought about it that way. <br><br>It&#39;s more of a personal thing. Whenever I see love or romance or something on TV or in a book my brain just disconnects and I can&#39;t really relate to the situation. It really sucks because a) love is everywhere and b) not even my favourite TV show is safe from this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGelJhg4B9Q">The concept of love is not even logical, either.</a></p>

            <p>Your little logic puzzle approach to love is immensely disrespectful to people who are asexual or aromantic. You&#39;re reducing them to the level of the damned Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma, and while this may not have been your intent, I&#39;m not of a mind that that makes it okay.<br><br>I also get that human speech in any language isn&#39;t especially good at expressing really complex stuff about... well, about much of anything, when you get down to it. That&#39;s why we have to invent new words all the time.

            <p>...and come back to me being disrespectful towards asexuals. I&#39;m not too sure about that: they&#39;re not looking to pursue relationships so they don&#39;t have to deal with the Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma model, right?<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;d just like to clear up my logic to prevent any further misunderstandings: I don&#39;t get why people pursue romantic relationships because it&#39;s far too easy to get hurt. Seriously: the odds are stacked against you. That&#39;s why I&#39;m saying that it&#39;s not logical-- why are people fighting battles where they almost certainly won&#39;t win? Mad props to those who succeed, though: they&#39;re the real heroes here. <br><br><br>...aaaaaand that&#39;s pretty much all I have to say on the issue. Let&#39;s wrap it up here and move on.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s a risk you take in a relationship. Yes, the odds are stacked against you. Yes, you will probably go through some very difficult things. But finding the right person and making it work, even if it is short-lived, can be the most wonderful feeling in the world. It&#39;s a deep connection unlike anything else in the world, and while it may be illogical and baffling to explain, it&#39;s just another aspect of life. <br><br>If you go into a relationship with a mindset of &quot;this may be doomed to fail&quot; or &quot;everything will be perfect&quot;, you just end up sabotaging yourself. Simply enjoy the time you have with that person. Even if it doesn&#39;t work out, chances are you&#39;ll learn from the experience and be more prepared for the next time.<br><br>People fight these battles because of the potential for a lasting connection. Some risks are worth taking.<br><br>Anyway, just my two cents on this. I hope this won&#39;t reignite the issue... I just wanted to say something.</p>

            <p>Well... Witty, really really funny with a dry, sarcastic humor, though his face would say otherwise. His face is too cheery for the character&#39;s type of humor, but I don&#39;t know wether that&#39;s good or bad. He smiles so much it&#39;s clear he&#39;s having a blast in the role. But when he&#39;s serious, get out of the way, people. He murders with angry eyes... Or at least his funny completely vanishes.<br><br>And he looks kinda cute, in my opinion.<br><br>But anyway, yeah, he&#39;s a good actor. If he&#39;s the tenth, then I&#39;m interested in how the rest of the Doctors will be like, how he&#39;ll be potrayed down the line.<br><br>Whatever happened to that poor alien janitor? I liked her. :( I know, I know, she most likely died. So good thing to know: There are aliens who have European ancestry in the future. But none of the other aliens sounded British/English/whatever the term is, I honestly don&#39;t know what the proper label is.</p>

The conceit for the story you&#39;ve got is inventive and has a lot of potential, and your writing style tells me you can deliver on the promise. Weird gun trivia and politics aside, your characters are decent people who I think could do well, and I look forward to seeing your mission completed!<br><br>This is also one of the few times I&#39;ve been interested in anything regarding Attack On Why Is Everything Brown?, so kudos for that too. =]</p>
